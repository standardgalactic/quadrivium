Introduction
You’re going to la belle France. Let us be the first to commend you on
your choice. France is a traveler’s dream, with so many places to
visit, sights to see, and things to do and with so much fabulous food and
wine to savor. It’s old Europe with cobblestone streets and soaring Gothic
cathedrals mixed with new Europe’s contemporary art and architecture.
The French have mastered — and in some cases invented — the art of
living well, and, as a visitor, you get to discover some of their tricks,
such as loitering in sidewalk cafes and lingering over five-course meals.
You probably want to start with Paris, one of the world’s most romantic
and sophisticated cities. But then you have to make some choices. Will it
be the castles of the Loire Valley, the chic towns of the French Riviera, or
the historic sites in Normandy? Will you be spending time in the dappled
sunshine of Provence or along the rocky coast of Brittany? This book
helps you make those choices and nail down all the details for a perfect
trip.
About This Book
France For Dummies, 4th Edition, is a reference book, a critical tool for
the first-time traveler and a useful guide for those who’ve visited France
before. There’s no need to read it from front to back — just dive in wher-
ever you want details on hotels, restaurants, sights, or travel tips. It
would take a lifetime of travel to see all of France, so this book helps 
you make choices and narrow down your itinerary. In addition, it gives
plenty of insider advice (the kind you’d get from a good friend) about
the best places to visit, hotels to stay in, restaurants to try, and some
pitfalls to avoid.
We tell you which fancy hotels and restaurants are worth a splurge and
which cheap ones will do in a pinch. Planning a trip can be loads of fun,
but we think the actual travel part is the best. So this guide is full of
hints that help you with the nitty-gritty reality of travel, including some
of those unexpected events that can’t be planned for ahead of time.
Likewise, we don’t bog you down with unimportant details or mediocre
sights; we give you just the good stuff — really the best of France.

Conventions Used in This Book
Because we’ve designed France For Dummies, 4th Edition, to be read in
any order you want, we use some standard listings for hotels, restau-
rants, and sights. These listings enable you to open the book to any
chapter and access the information you need quickly and easily.
Other conventions used in this book include the following:
 The abbreviations for credit cards: AE (American Express), DC
(Diners Club), MC (MasterCard), and V (Visa).
 Hotels, restaurants, and sometimes attractions are listed in alpha-
betical order so that moving among the maps, worksheets, and
descriptions is easier.
 Street abbreviations used throughout the book include rue (street),
bd. (boulevard), and av. (avenue).
 The Paris arrondissement, or administrative district, is included 
in each address to give you a better idea of where each place is
located. Paris is divided into 20 arrondissements, which are indi-
cated by an ordinal number from 1st (in the very center of Paris,
abbreviated 1er in French) to 20th (on the outer edges of the city,
abbreviated 20e in French). They appear after the street address in
each citation in this book. For example, “123 bd. St-Germain, 6e,”
indicates building number 123 on boulevard St-Germain in the 6th
arrondissement. To get an idea of where each arrondissement is
located, consult the “Paris Arrondissements” map in Chapter 11.
 For orientation in the Paris section, we list the nearest subway (or
Métro) stop for all destinations (for example, Métro: Pont Marie).
 All prices in France are provided in euros (€). Be sure to check the
exchange rate for any fluctuation before you leave. (A good Web
site to check for currency exchange rates is www.oanda.com.)
When converting euros to U.S. dollars in this book, we’ve assumed
that 1€ equals US$1.30.
All hotels and restaurants in this book are rated with a system of dollar
signs to indicate the range of costs for one night in a double-occupancy
hotel room or a meal at a restaurant, from “$” (budget) to “$$$$”

Dummies Post-it® Flags
As you read this book, you may find information that you want to reference as you plan
or enjoy your trip — whether a new hotel, a must-see attraction, or a must-try walk-
ing tour. To simplify your trip planning, mark these pages with the handy Post-it® Flags
included in this book.

(splurge). Rates for hotels are based on double occupancy unless other-
wise indicated. Restaurant prices include the average price for an appe-
tizer, main course, and dessert. The cost of beverages, particularly wine
and beer, is extra. Exact prices are listed in the guide for every establish-
ment, attraction, and activity, but of course, these are subject to change
and should be used only as guidelines. Check out the following table to
decipher the dollar signs.

Foolish Assumptions
We’ve made some assumptions about you and what your needs are as a
traveler. Maybe this is your first trip to France. Or maybe you’ve been to
France but don’t have much time to spend on trip planning and don’t
want to wade through a ton of information. Perhaps you’ve been frus-
trated with other guidebooks that bore you with background but don’t
give enough of the helpful information you really need. If any of these
apply, then France For Dummies is the guide for you.
Dummies travel guides appeal to a variety of audience segments, 
including
 Travelers looking for do’s and don’ts from an expert who has 
visited the destination
 Travelers who want “best of” information presented in bite-size
pieces
 Travelers who don’t have much time for travel planning and who
don’t want to wade through a more comprehensive guidebook
 Travelers wanting tips on experiencing the “essence” of a 
destination — the places, events, and/or people that make 
it unique
 Travelers who want to discover a destination’s history and 
culture — presented in an easy-to-understand and -digest format
Introduction 3

How This Book Is Organized
France For Dummies, 4th Edition, is divided into seven parts. The first
two cover everything you need to plan your trip. Part III covers Paris
and its environs. Parts IV through VI tackle the top regions of France,
with all the best sights. And, as with any For Dummies book, Part VII
offers the whimsical Part of Tens. You can read these parts independ-
ently if you want to zero in on the areas that interest you. Following are
brief summaries of each of the parts.
Part I: Introducing France
The four chapters that comprise Part I introduce France and touch on
everything you need to consider before planning a trip. This part leads
you to the best in several categories, ranging from the best travel experi-
ences to the best small towns, from the most romantic inns to the best
restaurants, from the best castles to the best vineyards. We also present
easy-to-digest cultural information, including culinary tidbits, local lingo,
and recommended reading and films. You also will find out the pros and
cons of each season and region, and we suggest some itineraries that
help you see some of France’s highlights.
Part II: Planning Your Trip to France
In Part II, you find the nuts and bolts of trip planning to help you answer
questions such as these. How do you develop a realistic budget? How do
you find the best flight to France? What’s the best way to get around the
country? What kind of accommodations should you use in France? We
also advise you on how to tie up those frustrating last-minute details
that can unnerve the most seasoned traveler.
Part III: Paris and the Best of the Ile de France
Part III guides you through Paris, this most magical of cities, and its sur-
rounding area. After exploring all the ins and outs of Paris, we take you
on day trips to Versailles, Fontainebleau, and Chartres.
Part IV: Tours and the Loire Valley Châteaux
In Part IV, we visit this beautiful region full of history and enchantment.
Chapter 14 explores Tours, a lively university town and a good base for
exploring the region. Chapter 15 visits eight château towns: Azay-le-
Rideau, Chinon, Ussé, Chenonceaux, Chaumont, Blois, Amboise, and
Chambord, with tours of the royal residences. Finally, we call on charm-
ing Orléans, another good base for exploring the region.
Part V: Normandy and Brittany
Part V is a tour of these authentic regions on the western coast of
France. In Normandy, we visit Rouen, a city of half-timbered houses rich
France For Dummies, 4th Edition

in history; Bayeaux, the site of the famous tapestry telling the adven-
tures of William the Conqueror; the D-day beaches, where Allied forces
dared to invade the Nazi-held mainland in 1944; and Mont-St-Michel,
Europe’s most famous abbey. In Brittany, you’ll find Quimper, home of
famous pottery; Carnac, site of France’s most extensive Neolithic remains;
and Nantes, a historic center between Brittany and the Loire Valley.
Part VI: Provence and the Riviera
We cover two of France’s best-loved regions in this part. In Provence, we
visit the famous towns of Avignon, Arles, and Aix-en-Provence, and the
quaint village of St-Rémy. We also take a quick, safe look at Marseille.
Along the Riviera, we make quick stops in ten towns: St-Tropez, Cannes,
Biot, Antibes, Vence, St-Paul-de-Vence, Nice, St-Jean-Cap-Ferrat, Beaulieu,
and deluxe Monaco.
Part VII: The Part of Tens
And no For Dummies guide would be complete without The Part of Tens,
a quick collection of fun tidbits, including a list of French foods you’ll
want to try and recommendations for the best gifts to buy in France.
You’ll also find one other element near the back of this book. We’ve
included an appendix — your Quick Concierge — containing lots of
handy information you may need when traveling in and around France,
such as phone numbers and addresses, emergency personnel or area
hospitals and pharmacies, lists of local newspapers and magazines, pro-
tocol for sending mail or finding taxis, and more. Check out this appen-
dix when searching for answers to lots of little questions that may come
up as you travel.
Icons Used in This Book
Throughout this book, you’ll notice in the margins little pictures called
icons. Consider them signposts or flags to alert you to facts or informa-
tion of particular interest.
This icon pegs the best bargains and juiciest money-saving tips. You may
find a particularly value-conscious choice of hotel or restaurant, a dis-
count museum or transportation pass, or simply a way to avoid spending
more than you have to.
This icon highlights the best the destination has to offer in all categories —
hotels, restaurants, attractions, activities, shopping, and nightlife.
When you need to be aware of a rip-off, an overrated sight, a dubious
deal, or any other trap set for an unsuspecting traveler, this icon alerts
you. These hints also offer the lowdown on the quirks, etiquette, and
unwritten rules of the area — so you can avoid looking like a tourist and
get treated like a local.
Introduction 5

This icon, in addition to flagging tips and resources of special interest 
to families, points out the most child-friendly hotels, restaurants, and
attractions. If you need a baby sitter at your hotel, a welcoming and
relaxed atmosphere at a restaurant, or a dazzling sight that delights your
child, look for this icon. We include information regarding larger, family-
sized rooms at hotels and restaurants that serve meals that go easy on
your little one’s tummy.
This icon is a catchall for any special hint, tip, or bit of insider’s advice
that may help make your trip run more smoothly. Really, the point of a
travel guide is to serve as one gigantic “tip,” but this icon singles out the
nuggets o’ knowledge you may not have run across before.
Sometimes a great hotel, restaurant, or sight may be located in a town or
area that we don’t have the room to include in this book. We let you in
on these secret finds, and you can rest assured, we don’t include any
spots that aren’t truly worth the energy.
Where to Go from Here
To France, of course. And France For Dummies takes you there. If you’re
at the beginning of planning for your trip, you’ll want to dig into the first
part for tips on when and where to go. If you’re ready to start picking
hotels, skip right over Part I and jump into the rest of the book. To brush
up on your French, flip to the Quick Concierge appendix in the back of
this book, where you’ll find a glossary.
As the French say, bonne continuation.

Part I
Introducing France

In this part . . . 
P
lanning the perfect trip to France is easy, especially if
you answer a few basic questions. Where do I go to ﬁnd
the best France has to offer? When should I go? These open-
ing chapters help you answer these questions so that you 
can ﬁne-tune plans for your trip. Think about what you’re
most interested in seeing and experiencing. If it’s French 
culture, you may want your trip to coincide with a festival or 
celebration. If it’s contemporary art, you’ll want to hit the
Riviera, which has the country’s best selection of modern art
museums.
Chapter 1 is an overview of the best France has to offer, so
you can choose what you like most and focus your trip.
Chapter 2 is a cultural catch-all, giving a rundown of the
major historical events, the building blocks of local architec-
ture, the native lingo, recommended books and ﬁlms, and a
taste of French cuisine. Chapter 3 outlines the regions and
seasons and then gives a list of the country’s best annual fes-
tivals and events. Those who need help planning an itinerary
can check out the four suggestions in Chapter 4.

Chapter 1
Discovering the 
Best of France
In This Chapter
 Embracing France’s outstanding travel experiences
 Savoring some of the best of France’s hotels and restaurants
 Finding the best museums in France
 Making your way to France’s most intriguing castles and cathedrals
 Exploring France’s premier shopping areas
F
rance is one of the most popular vacation sites for people traveling
abroad. Its reputation for combining sophistication and the art of
fine living is unmatched. The country long has been at the heart of
European culture, with its elegant language, excellent cuisine, and old-
world charm. Traveling through France is like taking a crash course in
European history, because you encounter everything from Roman ruins
and medieval villages to Gothic cathedrals, Renaissance castles, and
early-1900s villas. You can visit vineyards where the world’s most presti-
gious wines are made, or you can travel along the fabled French Riviera,
a region long frequented by the rich and famous.
Many travelers to France start with Paris and then, via planes or the
French rail system, visit areas such as the Riviera or the Loire Valley.
France has such a diversity of sites and regions that many French people
spend every vacation exploring their own country. However, as a typical
visitor with only one or two weeks of vacation time, you’ll want to maxi-
mize the experience. This chapter offers a handful of essential aspects of
France that you won’t want to miss on your trip, whether it’s a long week-
end in Paris or two weeks traveling around the country. You can find more
details about the best-of-the-best accommodations, restaurants, and activ-
ities that we recommend here — just check out the paragraphs marked
with the “Best of the Best” icon in the destination chapters of this book.
The Best Travel Experiences
Although it may be true that any experience in France is a top travel
experience, here are a few of our favorites.

 Dining out: The art of dining is serious business in France. Food 
is as cerebral as it is sensual. Even casual bistros with affordable
menus are likely to offer fresh seasonal ingredients in time-tested
recipes that may add up to a memorable meal. We offer our favorite
restaurants in the destination chapters of this book.
 Shopping in Parisian boutiques: The French guard their image as
Europe’s most stylish people. The citadels of Right Bank chic lie on
rue du Faubourg St-Honoré and its extension, rue-St-Honoré. The
most glamorous shops sprawl along these streets, stretching east
to west from the Palais Royal to the Palais de l’Elysé. Follow in the
footsteps of Coco Chanel, Yves Saint Laurent, and Karl Lagerfeld on
the shopper’s tour of a lifetime. See Chapter 12.
 Exploring the Loire Valley: An excursion to the châteaux dotting
this valley’s rich fields and forests will familiarize you with the
French Renaissance’s architectural aesthetics and with the
intrigues of the kings and their courts. Nothing conjures up the
aristocratic ancien régime better than a tour of these legendary
landmarks. See Chapter 14.
 Biking in the countryside: The country that invented Le Tour de
France offers thousands of options for bike trips. For a modest
charge, trains in France can carry your bicycle to any point. Euro-
Bike & Walking Tours of DeKalb, Illinois (% 800-321-6060; www.
eurobike.com), offers some of the best excursions. The company
features both walking and cycling tours of regions, including the
Loire Valley and Provence. See Chapters 14 and 18.
 Climbing to the heights of Mont-St-Michel: Straddling the tidal flats
between Normandy and Brittany, this fortress is the most spectacu-
lar in northern Europe. Said to be protected by the archangel
Michael, most of the Gothic marvel stands as it did during the
1200s. See Chapter 16.
 Paying tribute to fallen heroes on Normandy’s D-day beaches: On
June 6, 1944, the largest armada ever assembled departed from
England in dense fog and on rough seas. For about a week, the future
of the civilized world hung in a bloody and brutal balance between
the Nazi and Allied armies. Today you’ll find only the sticky sands
and wind-torn, gray-green seas of a rather chilly beach. But even if
you haven’t seen Saving Private Ryan or The Longest Day, you can
picture the struggles of the determined soldiers who paid a terrible
price to establish a beachhead on the continent. See Chapter 16.
 Marveling at the Riviera’s modern-art museums: Since the 1890s,
when Signac, Bonnard, and Matisse discovered St-Tropez, the
French Riviera has drawn artists and their patrons. Experience an
unforgettable drive across southern Provence, interspersing
museum visits with wonderful meals, people-watching, lounging 
on the beach, and stops at the area’s architectural and artistic 
marvels. Highlights are Aix-en-Provence (Cézanne’s studio), Biot
(the Léger Museum), Cagnes-sur-Mer (the Museum of Modern
Part I: Introducing France 
10

Mediterranean Art), and Cap d’Antibes (the Grimaldi Château’s
Picasso Museum). Nice, St-Paul-de-Vence, and St-Tropez all have
impressive modern-art collections. See Chapters 20 and 21.
The Most Romantic Inns
Traveling to France without kids? One of these destinations just may end
up being the romantic topper to your trip.
 Hotel de l’Abbaye St-Germain: In Paris, this is one of the Left
Bank’s most charming boutique hotels, built as a convent in the
early 18th century and successfully converted. Touches of a
sophisticated flair abound and are enhanced by a small garden and
a verdant courtyard with fountain and flower beds. Some of the
original oak ceiling beams still are in place. See Chapter 11.
 Le Choiseul: In Amboise in the Loire Valley — in the town where
Leonardo da Vinci died — this inn was formed when a trio of build-
ings from the 1700s were seamlessly blended and joined by Italianate
gardens. The modernized guest rooms are luxurious, and the formal
dining room, serving a superb cuisine, opens onto views of the Loire
River. On the grounds is a garden with flowering terraces. See
Chapter 15.
 Hostellerie du Vallon de Valrugues: In the ancient Provençal town
of St-Rémy-de-Provence stands this exquisite hotel, lying in a beau-
tifully landscaped park. Constructed in the 1970s, it evokes a fan-
tasy version of an ancient Roman villa. Beautifully decorated rooms
and suites are rented, along with luxurious marble-clad bathrooms.
A large heated swimming pool can be enjoyed by all guests, although
one private suite has its own pool. See Chapter 18.
 Hotel La Voile d’Or: In the fishing port of St-Jean-Cap-Ferrat, one of
the poshest villages along the French Riviera, this inn, which also is
known by its English nickname, the Golden Sail, is installed in a
converted 19th-century villa at the yacht harbor, opening onto
panoramic views of the water. Guests live in style in the individu-
ally decorated bedrooms, enjoying one of the area’s most refined
cuisines. See Chapter 20.
 La Réserve de Beaulieu: Between Monaco and Nice, opening onto
a beautiful Mediterranean beach, this small Relais & Châteaux is
an Italianate rose-pink villa from 1881 that was successfully con-
verted, with many of its bedrooms opening onto balconies with
panoramic sea views. Individually decorated bedrooms are super-
deluxe, with bathrooms to match. The inn also is celebrated for its
restaurant, one of Les Grandes Tables du Monde, an organization of
the world’s top restaurants. See Chapter 20.
 Hotel Byblos: In chic St-Tropez, at the western fringe of the Riviera,
this luxurious hideaway is the choice of visiting celebrities and one
of the most exclusive inns west of Cannes. Its owner wanted to
Chapter 1: Discovering the Best of France 11

create an “antihotel, a place like home.” In that, he succeeded, if
your home resembles a Middle Eastern palace. On a hill above the
harbor, it offers deluxe rooms, each one unique, along with some of
the finest nightclubs and dining choices in the west. If Julia Roberts
were to appear in St-Tropez, this, no doubt, would be her hotel. See
Chapter 21.
The Best Restaurants
For the finest in haute cuisine, where else do you turn but where cuisine
first became haute. Expect no surprises when looking for a five-star meal
at one of these restaurants.
 L’Ambroisie: In the Marais district of Paris (4e), this citadel of haute
cuisine opens onto one of Paris’s most beautiful squares, Place des
Vosges. One of the most talented chefs of Paris, Bernard Pacaud
cooks with vivid flavors and gastronomic skill, reaching a culinary
perfection at this 17th-century town house that evokes an Italian
palazzo. His faithful devotees always are thrilled to find where
Monsieur Pacaud’s imagination carries him next. See Chapter 11.
 Les Nymphéas: In the ancient capital of Normandy, the city of
Rouen, this grand restaurant bears the name of a painting by Monet
(Water Lilies). The setting is a 16th-century half-timbered house
near the landmark square in the old town of Rouen. A savory,
sophisticated cuisine is served with style and grace, and ingredi-
ents are first-rate and often from the Norman countryside. The sig-
nature dessert is a warm soufflé flavored with apples and Calvados.
See Chapter 16.
 Christian Etienne: In the once papal city of Avignon, capital of
Provence, the city’s grandest restaurant is in a stone house with
origins dating back to 1180. Near the Palais des Papes, or former
papal palace, this citadel of wondrous cuisine always relies on the
best produce of any given season. Sometimes the fixed-price menus
are theme-based, such as many variations on the theme of lobster.
See Chapter 18.
 Lou Marquès: In the Provençal city of Arles, this swank restaurant
is part of the deluxe hotel Jules-César. Serving a Provençal cuisine
based on market-fresh ingredients, Lou Marquès is part of a Relais
& Châteaux property. The cuisine features creative twists on long-
established recipes. You’ll experience delight when you order such
dishes as breast of guinea fowl stuffed with olive paste and spit-
roasted. See Chapter 18.
 Chantecler: In Nice, capital of the French Riviera, this posh dining
room holds forth at the Hotel Negresco, in the heart of the city. 
The most prestigious — and the best — restaurant in the city, it
serves a top-notch cuisine in refined surroundings, which include
16th-century paintings. Top-quality ingredients such as foie gras, black
truffles, and giant prawns are used in abundance. See Chapter 20.

 Louis XV: This golden palace — and one of the best restaurants 
in the world — is found at the swanky Hotel de Paris at Place du
Casino, in the heart of Monte Carlo. Chef Alain Ducasse, “the world’s
greatest” (at least in his opinion), is the inspiration behind the
Provençal and Tuscan cuisine. It’s strictly a posh haven pour les 
gourmands — and rich ones at that. If your dream is of luxury 
dining and a sublime cuisine, you are more likely to encounter 
both here, more so than at any other restaurant along the Riviera.
See Chapter 20.
The Best Museums
You can find the best of the best museums on and around the banks of the
Seine, but you also can expect to find a few nice surprises outside of Paris.
 Musée de Louvre: In Paris’s 1st arrondissement (1er), the largest
palace in the world houses one of the great treasure troves of art
on the planet at its location on Rue de Rivoli. Impressive, even
exhausting, you can see so much here: everything from da Vinci’s
Mona Lisa to the supple statue of Venus de Milo. You’ll stand in awe
at The Winged Victory with its cloak rippling in the wind. Get a free
map of the Louvre at the information desk to set out on a voyage of
artistic discovery. See Chapter 12.
 Musée d’Orsay: Paris’s other great art museum stands in the 7th
arrondissement, and it has the greatest collection of Impressionist
masterpieces spread across three floors of exhibits. The neoclassi-
cal Gare d’Orsay train station was transformed into this unique
museum, which is devoted mainly to art from 1848 to 1914. Be 
prepared to encounter everything from the Symbolists to the
Pointillists, from Monet to Manet, and from van Gogh to Renoir. 
See Chapter 12.
 Centre Georges Pompidou: Also in Paris is yet a third museum that
also is one of the world’s greatest depositories of art (in Paris, you
quickly get used to saying “the world’s greatest”). Open since 1966,
this cultural center is called “the most avant-garde building in the
world” because of its radical exoskeletal design. Parisians are more
likely to refer to the painted pipes and ducts as “the refinery.” Even
so, its Musée National d’Art Moderne contains one of the world’s
finest collections of modern art — and there are so many other
treasures besides. The location is in the Marais (in both the 3rd and
4th arrondissements) at Place Georges-Pompidou. See Chapter 12.
 Villa Kérylos: In the exclusive coastal resort of Beaulieu, between
Monaco and Nice, this dream house lies at the tip of a rocky pro-
montory jutting into the Mediterranean. The villa is a replica of an
ancient Greek residence, and it was designed and built by archaeol-
ogist Theodore Reinach, who filled it with treasures from the ancient
world, including mosaics, frescoes, and reproductions of Greek
works. A special feature is his galleries of antiquities containing,
Chapter 1: Discovering the Best of France 13

among other delights, copies of famous statues such as the Venus de
Milo and the Discus Thrower. See Chapter 20.
 Musée Picasso: In the ancient French Riviera town of Antibes,
Pablo Picasso came to live and work in the Château Grimaldi (then
an art museum) in the autumn of 1946. In gratitude for setting up a
studio and residence for him in this town-owned villa, Picasso
donated the 181 works he completed during his stay here — not
just paintings, but also ceramics and sculpture — to Antibes. The
museum was renamed in honor of Picasso upon his death. If you
wander its sculpture gardens, you’ll be rewarded with a view of the
Mediterranean. See Chapter 21.
 Foundation Maeght: At St-Paul-de-Vence, the most charming of all
Riviera hill towns, home to many artists, stands the premier art
gallery of the Riviera, lying just outside the walls. In an avant-garde
building, it is a showcase for some of the greatest modern art with
both a permanent collection — Calder, Chagall, Bonnard, Matisse,
and more — to changing special exhibitions. See Chapter 21.
The Best Castles and Palaces
From massive — and intimidating, to those who approached them
unawares — protective structures to ornate châteaux that housed
France’s rich and powerful, visiting the country’s best castles and
palaces offers a studied glimpse into France’s history.
 Musée Jacquemart-Andre: In Paris, in the swank 8th arrondisse-
ment district near the Champs-Elysées stands a mansion that’s like
a jewel box. With its gilt salons and elegant winding staircase, it con-
tains one of the best small collections of 18th-century decorative art
in Paris. A rare collection of French decorative art is exhibited,
along with paintings and sculpture from the Dutch and Flemish
schools, including objets d’art from the Italian Renaissance. You’ll
see works by Rembrandt, Van Dyck, Rubens, Tiepolo, Carpaccio,
and the beat goes on. See Chapter 12.
 Château de Versailles: Just 21km (13 miles) southwest of Paris
delivers you to the town of Versailles and a palace in the center of
town that, even though unbelievably vast, is as ornately artificial as
a jewel box. The kings of France built a whole glittering private
world for themselves here, until the French Revolution sent many
of the inhabitants of this palace to the guillotine. Go on one of the
grandest tours of your life, taking in the Hall of Mirrors where the
Treaty of Versailles was signed and the apartments where such mis-
tresses as Madame de Pompadour once romped. It’s a moving spec-
tacle. See Chapter 13.
 Château de Fontainebleau: Seven centuries of French royal history
spin around this castle in the town of Fontainebleau, 60km (37
miles) south of Paris. Surrounded by a superb forest, Fontainebleau
is more intimate than Versailles and a product of the Renaissance

14

movement in France in the 16th century. Napoléon later added
many of the furnishings you’ll see here. The Mona Lisa once hung
here. François I, who transformed the site in 1528, purchased the
painting from the artist Leonardo da Vinci. See Chapter 13.
 Château de Chambord: In the little town of Chambord, 191km (118
miles) south of Paris, stands the largest castle in the Loire Valley,
created by some 2,000 workers between 1519 and 1545. The build-
ing represents the pinnacle of the French Renaissance. Set in a park
of more than 5,260 hectares (3,000 acres), it is enclosed by a wall
stretching for 32km (20 miles). See Chapter 15.
 Château d’Azay-le-Rideau: This Renaissance masterpiece dominates
a little village of the same name. The castle lies 261km (162 miles)
southwest of Paris and has a faux defensive medieval look to it. It was
occupied by nobles instead of royalty, and construction was ordered
in 1515 by Gilles Berthelot, finance minister to François I. Its Renais-
sance interior is a virtual museum of architecture. See Chapter 15.
 Mont-St-Michel: Massive walls — more than half a mile in 
circumference — enclose one of the greatest sightseeing attrac-
tions and one of the most important Gothic masterpieces of Europe.
Mont-St-Michel, lying at a point 324km (201 miles) west of Paris,
can be seen for miles around, a rock rising 78m (260 ft.) high. The
tides around Mont-St-Michel are notorious, having claimed count-
less lives. A Benedictine monastery was founded on this spot in 966
by Richard I, Duke of Normandy, although an earlier monastery was
located here from A.D. 708. See Chapter 16.
The Best Churches and Cathedrals
Any trip to France requires visits to its impressive cathedrals, often
more for the views than for their places in French history.
 Cathédrale de Notre-Dame: In the Ile de la Cité (4e) in the heart of
Paris, this fabled cathedral is one of Western civilization’s greatest
edifices. It is a piece of Gothic architectural perfection — not
merely in overall design but in every detail, including the rose
window above the main portal. More than any other building in
France, Notre-Dame represents the history of a nation. Here, for
example, Napoléon took the crown out of the hands of Pope Pius
VII and crowned himself. See Chapter 12.
 Sacré-Coeur: In the 18th arrondissement of Paris, dominating Paris’s
highest hill, this basilica — once called “a lunatic’s confectionary
dream” — has outlived its critics and remains an enduring monu-
ment on the city’s skyline. Built in an oddly oriental neo-Byzantine
style, the church, from its white dome, offers the single greatest
view of Paris that extends over and far beyond “the mountain of
martyrs” (Montmartre). See Chapter 12.
Chapter 1: Discovering the Best of France 15

 Sainte-Chapelle: In the 4th arrondissement of Paris, this church at
Palais de Justice is one of the oldest, most beautiful, and oddest in
the world. It was constructed in 1246 for the express purpose of
housing the relics of the Crucifixion, which had been sent from
Constantinople. The relics later were transferred to Notre-Dame.
What keeps the chapel on the tourist map are its 15 stained-glass
windows, among the greatest ever created. They flood the interior
with colored light — deep blue, ruby red, and dark green — and
depict more than 1,000 scenes from the Bible. See Chapter 12.
 Cathedrale de Notre-de-Dame-de-Chartres: This cathedral is one 
of the world’s greatest Gothic cathedrals and one of the finest
achievements of the Middle Ages. The cathedral, completed in
1220, is celebrated for its stained-glass windows, which cover an
expanse of some 2,508 sq. m (27,000 sq. ft.), the peerless ensemble
is truly majestic. Most of the glass dates from the 12th and 13th
centuries. See Chapter 13.
 Cathédrale Notre-Dame: Yet another Notre-Dame stands in the city
of Rouen, capital of Normandy. It dominates a town known as the
“hundred-spired city.” Its spirit was captured in a series of paint-
ings by Monet. The cathedral originally was constructed in 1063,
but it has seen many building crews through the centuries. It’s dis-
tinguished by two soaring towers. See Chapter 16.
 Notre-Dame de la Garde: Marseille’s Notre-Dame doesn’t even com-
pare to the artistic style of the great Gothic churches in the north of
France, including Paris. Instead, it holds a bizarre fascination and
once was fortified. The style is a kind of Romanesque Byzantine, with
domes, multicolored stripes of stone, and plenty of gilt, marble, and
mosaics. The views from its terrace are panoramic, and it’s worth the
trek over to see this curious architectural assemblage. See Chapter 18.
The Best Gardens
The French are quite justifiably proud of their carefully cultivated gar-
dens. Make sure to schedule a few of these favorites into your France
itinerary.
 Jardin des Tuileries: In Paris, these famous gardens in the 1er
stretch along the Right Bank of the Seine from the Place de la
Concorde to the courtyard of the Louvre. Spread across 29 hec-
tares (63 acres), Paris’s most formal gardens are exquisite and laid
out as a royal pleasure park back in 1564. The denizens who fought
the French Revolution threw open the gardens to the general popu-
lace. Filled with statues, fountains, and mathematically trimmed
hedges, the Tuileries offer amusement-park entertainment in the
summer. See Chapter 12.
 Jardin du Luxembourg: In the St-Germain-des-Prés area in the 6th
arrondissement on Paris’s Left Bank, these once-royal gardens are
entered on the corner of boulevard St-Michel and rue des Médicis.
Part I: Introducing France 
16

A masterpiece of Renaissance landscaping with a jewel of a central
pond, the gardens face the Palais de Luxembourg, former abode of
Marie de Médici, queen of Henri IV. Throngs of university students
are especially fond of these grounds. See Chapter 12.
 Bois de Boulonge: Covering some 890 hectares (2,200 acres), this
sprawling park and gardens is Paris’s favorite outdoor amusement
zone. Fabled as a playground since the “Gay Nineties,” it borders
the northwestern edge of the city. Once a royal forest and hunting
ground, it is known today for its race days at Longchamp, when you
still can admire the best-dressed women in Paris in their finest
dresses. Families love the lakes, waterfalls, and discreetly hidden
glens. See Chapter 12.
 The Gardens of Versailles: Spread across 101 hectares (250 acres),
these gardens, former stamping ground of royalty, represent the
ultimate in French landscaping perfection. Every tree, shrub,
flower, and hedge is disciplined into a frozen ballet pattern and
blended with soaring fountains, sparkling little lakes, grandiose
steps, and hundreds of marble statues. It’s more like a colossal
stage setting than a park — even the view of the blue horizon
seems embroidered on. It’s a Garden of Eden where you expect the
birds to sing coloratura soprano. See Chapter 13.
 Monet’s Garden at Giverny: Visitors by the thousands flock to
Giverny, 81km (50 miles) northwest of Paris, to see where Claude
Monet lived and worked. You can stroll in the garden where he
painted his famous water lilies. These gardens usually are at their
best in May, June, September, and October. The Japanese bridge,
hung with wisteria, leads to a setting of weeping willows and rhodo-
dendrons. Monet’s studio barge was installed on the pond. See
Chapter 13.
 Jardin Exotique: In the principality of Monaco on the French
Riviera, these royal gardens are built on the side of a rock and cel-
ebrated for their famous cactus collection. They were begun by
Prince Albert I, who was a naturalist and scientist. He spotted some
succulents growing in the palace gardens and created this garden
from that humble beginning. Of course, the gardens have greatly
expanded through the years, with more succulents being added
from around the world. One giant cactus is more than a century
old. See Chapter 20.
The Best Destinations for Serious Shoppers
France is second to none when it comes to pleasing sophisticated shop-
pers. Start in the fashion capital of the world (Paris), and work your way
around to some of the other shopping destinations in the country.
Chapter 1: Discovering the Best of France 17

 Paris: Not to be ignored is the joy of bringing “something back from
Paris,” a reminder of your stay. There can be no substitute for
memories of strolling along one of the chic boulevards of Paris,
browsing in the smart boutiques, and finally purchasing — say, a
scarf or handbag. Paris is one of the great shopping meccas of the
world, the rival of New York and London. Shopping surrounds you
on every street. Right Bank shops are centered in the 1st and 8th
arrondissements, and Left Bank shopping uses the hubs of the 6th
and 7th arrondissements. See Chapter 12.
 Quimper: The capital of Brittany is celebrated for its hand-painted
pottery, which has been made here since the early 1600s. In your
search for faïence, you can take a factory tour, explore a museum
devoted to pottery, and spend time in local shops that hawk this
exquisite merchandise. See Chapter 17.
 St-Rémy-de-Provence: Our favorite town in the province also is a
center of home decorating, and antique shops and fabric stores
abound in the old town. Walk its narrow streets and shop, shop,
shop, choosing from a wide array of merchandise from antiques to
flea-market discoveries, along with faïences and fabrics. The town
is filled with collectibles, including santons (hand-painted clay fig-
urines). See Chapter 18.
 Aix-en-Provence: Some of the best markets in all of Provence focus
on this town, famous for its fruit and vegetable market, which is
open every morning. Even if you don’t buy anything (it’s likely that
you will), you can wander among stall after stall, looking at the
products Provence is known for, everything from local cheeses to
fresh produce — and most definitely olives and lavender. Seek out
some of the specialty stores selling classic Provence sweets, such
as almond-paste cookies, or else craft shops hawking their beauti-
ful handmade baskets. See Chapter 18.
 Nice: This city is known throughout Europe for its celebrated
flower market, Marché aux Fleurs — open Tuesday to Saturday
beginning at 6 a.m. Chances are, the actual visitor will patronize
these markets mainly to sightsee. But Nice also offers plenty of
shops where you may want to make more serious purchases,
including glassware from Biot, pottery from Vallauris of Picasso
fame, and, most definitely, perfumes from Grasse. See Chapter 20.
 Cannes: This posh Riviera resort is known for both its markets and
its specialty shops. The biggest market is Marché Forville, which
you may want to treat as a sightseeing attraction, and dozens of
specialty shops will entice you, too. Cannes, attracting yachties,
also is known for its high-fashion designer shops, including Chanel
and Dior. These pockets of posh lie on or in the vicinity of La
Croisette. See Chapter 21.

F
rance is one of the world’s most talked-about and most written-
about destinations. It’s packed with diversions and distractions of
every sort: Cultural, culinary, sensual, you name it. From its extraordi-
narily complex and fascinating history to its architectural legacy, from
its trend-setting culinary standards to its role in literature and film of
today and yesterday, this chapter helps you discover why France has
been called le deuxième pays de tout le monde, or everyone’s second
country.
History 101: The Main Events
France — influenced by its centuries of monarchies, its fiery Revolution,
its native son trying to conquer all of Europe, its role in two world wars,
and its countless influential artists, writers, and philosophers — has a
culture that is one of the most sophisticated and one of the most tradi-
tional of Western nations. This section helps you sort out just who did
what to whom and when. Or, if you’d rather peruse a quick-and-dirty
dateline of events, look for the nearby sidebar, “Significant dates in
France’s history.”
The area now known as France originally was called Gaul. In the 1st 
century B.C., it was conquered by the powerful Romans, led by Julius
Caesar, and was ruled from Rome for 400 years. During that time, the
Romans established their colony of Lutetia on the Ile de la Cité, an
island in the Seine River in the center of what’s now Paris. The French
language evolved from the Latin of these early invaders. For the next 500
years, the barbarians, who were Germanic tribes, invaded Gaul and
eventually settled there. One of these tribes, known as the Franks, gave
its name to France.

Reigning over France
Clovis I (reigned A.D. 481–511) is considered the first king of France,
though his influence was strongest in the north of the country. He con-
verted to Catholicism, united territories, and selected Paris as the capital.
Charlemagne came along a couple hundred years later, reigning (A.D. 768–
814) over an area that extended from the Baltic to the Mediterranean seas
and included parts of France, Germany, and Italy. Now here was a king the
people could rally behind, a great general and bold ruler. The pope in Rome
crowned Charlemagne Holy Roman Emperor in 800, giving a spiritual legit-
imacy to his rule. These times were good for scholarship and the arts.
France and Germany didn’t become separated until 843, when Charle-
magne’s grandsons — Louis, Lothair, Pepin, and Charles — split the
kingdom. Charles the Bald got France. He and Louis united against
Lothair by taking the Oath of Strasbourg, the first known document writ-
ten in French and German instead of the usual Latin. Charles, who ruled
over a region whose borders resembled the France of today, developed a
complex feudal system.
In 1066, William, duc de Normandie, known in history as William the
Conqueror, began a campaign to conquer England, and the Bayeux
Tapestry in Normandy tells the dramatic tale. In 1152, Eleanor of
Aquitaine stirred things up again between France and England when she
divorced the king of France (Louis VII) and married the king of England
(Henry II), placing western France under English rule. War between the
two countries continued on and off for hundreds of years.
During the Middle Ages, the Catholic church was a powerful force in
France. Holy men preached the Crusades in the 12th and 13th centuries,
inciting armies of men to journey to foreign lands in the name of the
church. These so-called holy armies set off to conquer lands for the
Holy Roman Emperor.
Throughout the next 700 years, five dynasties held the French crown
and built the monarchy into one of Europe’s most powerful. Of these
kings, several stand out for their achievements in bringing about the
France of today. An especially long and fruitful reign was that of Louis IX
(1226–70), called St-Louis. During his reign, Ste-Chapelle and Cathédrale
Notre-Dame were built on the Ile de la Cité in Paris. The arts of tapestry
weaving and stone cutting flourished.
Philippe IV (the Fair), who reigned from 1285 to 1314, was instrumental
in France gaining its independence from the pope in Rome. Philippe 
had a French pope elected, Clement V, who transferred the papacy to
Avignon, where it remained from 1309 to 1378. For a brief period, two
popes — one in Rome and one in Avignon — jockeyed for power. Rome
eventually won out. In 1348, the bubonic plague, called the Black Death,
wiped out a third of Europe’s population. Meanwhile, the Hundred
Years’ War between France and England waged from 1337 to 1453.

Things looked bad for the French until 1431, when a peasant girl named
Joan of Arc led an army to take back Orléans and then accompanied
Charles VII to Reims, where he was crowned king. In revenge, the English
burned Joan at the stake in Rouen, a town they controlled, in 1431.
François I (1515–47) brought the Italian Renaissance to France by becom-
ing a patron of Leonardo da Vinci and other great Italian artists and archi-
tects. Around this time, the Protestant religion was gaining popularity,
which led to discrimination by the ruling Catholics against the Prote-
stants. From 1559 to 1598, the Wars of Religion pitted Catholics against
the Protestant minority, reaching a climax when Catherine de Médici,
widow of Henri II, ordered the St. Bartholomew’s Day massacre, killing
hundreds of Protestants on August 14, 1572. Henri IV (1589–1610) earned
a place in the history books by signing the Edict of Nantes that guaran-
teed religious freedom to Protestants. The edict was revoked in 1685.
The sinister Catholic-cardinal-turned-prime-minister, Cardinal Richelieu,
gained power from 1624 until his death in 1642 and paved the way for
the absolute monarchy. Louis XIV, who had the longest reign in the his-
tory of France (1643–1715), became one of its greatest kings, expanding
the kingdom and amassing great wealth. In 1664, he began construction
of the Château de Versailles. During his reign, great writers (Pierre
Corneille, Molière, and Jean Racine) and architects (François Mansart)
were celebrated. During the long reign of his great-grandson, Louis XV
(1715–74), such great thinkers and philosophers as Voltaire, Jean-
Jacques Rousseau, Montesquieu, and Denis Diderot voiced their opin-
ions in the period known as the Age of Enlightenment.
Louis XV’s grandson, Louis XVI (1774–91), married Marie Antoinette of
Austria in 1770, and their ostentatious manners proved to be the down-
fall of the French monarchy. From 1776 to 1783, following the maxim “the
enemy of my enemy is my friend,” France supported the North American
colonists’ quest for independence from England.
On June 20, 1789, representatives of the National Assembly met in the
Versailles tennis court and swore “The Tennis Court Oath” to put
together a Constitution for France with a legislative government. But
impatient for reform, the people of Paris stormed the Bastille prison on
July 14, 1789. The Declaration of the Rights of Man and the Constitu-
tion were drawn up later that year, and these documents are still cited
as models of democratic values. But the mob couldn’t be stopped. They
arrested Louis XVI in 1791 and put him on trial. He was executed in 1793,
the year France was declared a republic, and Marie Antoinette was
beheaded later that same year. The dreaded Revolutionary radical
Robespierre led this Reign of Terror, in which more than a thousand
people were beheaded, which finally ended in 1794.
It took the short but powerful Corsican-born general Napoléon Bona-
parte (reigned 1804–15) to restore order to France after the Revolution-
ary fervor. In a 1799 coup d’état, Napoléon was named one of three in a
Chapter 2: Digging Deeper into France 21

ruling consulate, but, by 1802, he was made First Consul for life. In 1804,
Napoléon crowned himself emperor and his wife, Joséphine, empress as
the pope looked on. The following year, he was crowned king of Italy. By
1808, having occupied Vienna and Berlin and having invaded Portugal
and Spain, Napoléon seemed on his way to conquering Europe and
brought great pride to the French. But after his disastrous retreat from
Moscow in 1814, he abdicated and was exiled to Elba. Napoléon returned
to power the following year and was defeated at Waterloo on June 18,
1815. After that defeat, Napoléon was deported to the island of St.
Helena in the South Atlantic and died there in 1821.
The monarchy was restored with Louis XVIII (1814–24) and then 
Charles X (1824–30). In 1830, Louis-Philippe I, descended from a branch
of the Bourbons that had ruled France on and off since the 16th century,
was called king of the French, not king of France, under a more liberal
constitution, but he was forced out of office in 1847. During these politi-
cally tumultuous but fairly prosperous years, Victor Hugo, Stendhal, and
Honoré de Balzac wrote great novels. In 1848, Napoléon’s nephew, Louis-
Napoléon Bonaparte, was elected president of the Second Republic. In
1852, he assumed the title of emperor as Napoléon III and, with the help
of Baron Haussmann, designed Paris’s grand boulevards. In July 1870, a
dispute over a telegram escalated into France declaring an ultimately
unsuccessful war on Prussia. As a result of the military defeats and inva-
sion of France by Prussia, Napoléon III was removed from office. The
period of 1875 to 1940 is known as the Third Republic. Meanwhile, on
the cultural scene, the artists known as the Impressionists scandalized
the French Academy and forever changed art. And, in 1889, at Paris’s
Universal Exposition, the Tour Eiffel was unveiled. Many Parisians hated
it at first, but now it’s the universally beloved symbol of Paris.
Creating a nation
World War I (1914–18) was devastating for France. The worldwide eco-
nomic depression that followed severely weakened the government
while Germany gained power under the charismatic and acquisitive
Adolf Hitler. France declared war on Germany in 1939, following the
Nazi invasion of France’s ally, Poland. In 1940, the German army invaded
France; the French army rapidly collapsed, and the Germans occupied
the country. The period called the Collaboration is one of France’s most
shameful. The government was transferred first to Bordeaux and then,
under the Nazi-approved President Pétain, to Vichy. French General
Charles de Gaulle refused to accept the armistice with Germany and
Italy and broadcast a call for resistance from London on June 18, 1940.
However, everything changed on June 6, 1944, when thousands of Allied
troops from the United States, the United Kingdom, Canada, and exiles
from the invaded nations landed on the wind-swept shores of Normandy
in the D-day invasion. Brilliant Allied military maneuvers led to the even-
tual surrender of Germany on May 8, 1945.

After the war, the Fourth Republic was set up in 1946. Insurrection in
France’s African and Asian colonies caused huge problems for the gov-
ernment. After suffering great losses, France withdrew from most of its
colonies, including Indochina in 1954 and Algeria in 1962. In 1958, General
de Gaulle returned to power with the Fifth Republic. In May 1968, uni-
versity students joined with workers in uprisings that paralyzed Paris,
spread through the country, and led to de Gaulle’s resignation in 1969.
Georges Pompidou became president in 1969, followed by Valéry Giscard
d’Estaing in 1974. In 1981, the left came to power with the election of
François Mitterrand, the first Socialist president since World War II.
Mitterrand served two terms and bestowed on Paris famous grands 
projets such as the Louvre pyramid, Opéra Bastille, and Grand Arche 
de la Défense.
During the past decade, France has been heavily involved in the devel-
opment of the European Union, the 12 countries that have banded
together with a single currency and no trade barriers. In 1993, voters
ousted the socialists and installed a conservative government that’s
headed by Jacques Chirac as president. A decade of bombings, strikes,
and rising unemployment all faded into the background on December 31,
1999, as Paris’s salute to 2000 with spectacular fireworks over the Tour
Eiffel was one of the world’s most spectacular celebrations.
In the postmillennium, political headlines in France have centered on 
its continuing deterioration of relations with its former ally, the United
States. The problem centers on Iraq. Most French people bitterly resent
the war in Iraq and were extremely critical of George W. Bush during his
first four years in office.
On another, more ominous note, attacks against Jews in postmillennium
France reached their highest level since World War II. An increase in anti-
Semitic acts coincided with heightened tensions in the Middle East.
Jewish schools, temples, and cemeteries were attacked.
Late in 2005, decades of pent-up resentment felt by the children of African
immigrants exploded into an orgy of violence and vandalism. Riots began
in the suburbs of Paris and spread around the country. Throughout
France, gangs of youths battled the French police, torched schools, cars,
and businesses, and even attacked commuter trains. Rioting followed in
such cities as Dijon, Marseilles, and Rouen. Horrible incidents were
reported, including a woman on crutches who was doused with flam-
mable liquid and set fire. Most of the rioters were the sons of Arab and
black African immigrants, Muslims living in a mostly Catholic country. 
The reasons for the protests? Leaders of the riots claimed they live 
“like second-class citizens,” even though they are French citizens.
Unemployment is 30 percent higher in the ethnic ghettos of France.

Building Blocks: Local Architecture
During the heyday of the Roman Empire, only the southernmost region
of France was viewed as having any artistic merit in architecture. This
region became familiar with the architectural sophistication of the
Mediterranean through trade. Provence was quick to adopt the building
techniques common in the Roman world, including triumphal arches,
massive aqueducts, and mausoleums.
Little remains from the Roman period, roughly from A.D. 125 to 450. Most
of the treasure trove you’ll see today — engraved weapons and tools,
bronzes, statues, and jewelry — is found in museums, no finer collection
than that of the Musée de Cluny in Paris. For actual Roman ruins and
remains, the best town in the south that’s covered in this book is the
city of Arles, with its amphitheater and reconstructed theater, and the
Glanum excavations outside the charming little Provence town of St-
Rémy-de-Provence.
Romanesque rigidity
The classical Roman period, in time, gave way to the coming of an archi-
tectural form called Romanesque (it wasn’t known as that back then).
This roughly covers the period from 800 to 1100, its rise coming about
because of the growing religious power of the church at this time.
The earliest manifestations are thick-walled fortresses that served as
refuges during times of invasion. At first these structures were not

embellished, relying on load-bearing rounded arches and windows for
ornamentation. By the end of the period, around 1100, the facades and
interiors of some churches were being covered with sculptures designed
to highlight architecture instead of separate works of art.
Many pieces of Romanesque sculpture are solid, rigid, unyielding, and
lifeless, yet the capitals of the columns often are charming and decora-
tive. Bas-reliefs, especially those depicting the Last Judgment, came 
into vogue. Reliefs enveloped column capitals and were used to adorn
tympanums — arched spaces over doorways or portals. To see the true
remains of the Romanesque style, you’d have to go into remote France,
beyond the province of this guide. A prime example would be the Abbey
of Fontenay in Burgundy.
The Gothic cathedral: Awe of the Middle Ages
Of far more interest to the average visitor is the coming of the French
Gothic style to all the land. This late medieval period, roughly from 1100
to 1500, still centered on the church, where artisans created stained
glass, statues, choir screens, and elaborate, dramatic facades. Gothic fig-
ures were more realistic than Romanesque ones but still highly stylized,
with exaggerated gestures and features.
The wide Gothic churches and cathedrals included a choir, a circular
ambulatory, radiating chapels, pointed arches that carried more weight
than rounded ones, clustered (rather than monolithic) columns, cross
vaults, and ribbed ceilings. Wide, soaring windows are the most salient
Gothic advance. In a Romanesque church the space would have been
devoted to thick stone walls. The new Gothic design required the addi-
tion of exterior flying buttresses to support the weight of the very heavy
roof and ceiling.
In this book, we preview some of the greatest achievements of the
Gothic era, none more glorious than the Cathédrale de Notre-Dame in
Paris with its flying buttresses, rose windows, and gargoyles. For stained
glass, Saint-Chapelle, near Notre-Dame, is reason enough to fly over. Of
course, the 150 glorious stained-glass windows of the Cathédrale of
Chartres are another great blooming of this art form.
When the 14th-century papal schism encouraged many bishops of
Europe to recognize Avignon instead of Rome as the legitimate seat of
the papacy, this capital of Provence became a virtual building site. A
fortress was required that would also be a palace, and the Gothic Palais
des Papes fit the bill.
The coming of the Renaissance
The French invasion of Italy in 1494 brought the ideals and aesthetic of
the Italian Renaissance to France. This form of art and architecture
reached its peak under the reign of François I, a true Renaissance prince
who invited not only Cellini but also Leonardo da Vinci to his court at
Part I: Introducing France 
26

Amboise in the Loire Valley. The Renaissance lasted roughly from 1500
until 1630.
New political and social conditions encouraged aristocratic residences
to be filled with sunlight, tapestries, paintings, and music. Adaptations
of Gothic architecture, mingled with strong doses of Italian Renaissance,
were applied to secular residences more suited to peace than to war.
This is particularly evident at Azay Le Rideau, one of the loveliest of the
Loire châteaux. Begun in 1518, its Italian influences are clearly visible,
and it is obvious that this castle was built for pleasure living — not as a
fortress to protect its inhabitants.
The artists of the School of Fontainebleau blended late Italian Renais-
sance style with French elements when redecorating the Château de
Fontainebleau. Foremost among Renaissance châteaux in France is the
Château de Chambord in the Loire Valley. Launched in 1519, it is the
largest château in the Loire Valley and was the abode of the likes of
Henri II and Catherine de Médici along with Louis XIII.
Renaissance architectural features relied on symmetry and a sense of
proportion, with steeply pitched roofs often studded with dormer win-
dows projecting from their sloping roofs. Classical capitals such as
Doric, Ionic, and Corinthian came back into vogue.
From classicism to decorative rococo (1630–1800)
In the early 17th century, many of Paris’s distinctive Italianate baroque
domes were created. Louis XIV employed Le Vau, Perrault, both Mansarts,
and Bruand for his buildings, plus Le Notre for the rigidly intelligent lay-
outs of his gardens at Versailles. Meanwhile, court painters, such as
Boucher, depicted allegorical shepherds and cherubs at play, while
Georges de la Tour used techniques of light and shadow garnered from
Caravaggio during a sojourn in Italy. Châteaux designed in this era
included the superexpensive Vaux-le-Vicomte and the even more 
lavish royal residence at Versailles.
But by the 18th century, French architects returned to a restrained and
dignified form of classicism. Public parks in Paris and other leading
cities were laid out, sometimes requiring the demolition of acres of
twisted medieval sectors. Roman styles of painting, sculpture, and dress
became the rage.
From the 1800s to the modern era
The 19th century gave rise to the First Empire, with its tasteful neoclas-
sical buildings, which prevailed during the reign of the dictator Napoléon
Bonaparte. These buildings were followed by the buildings of the Second
Empire, during the reign of the vain Napoléon III. Between 1855 and
1869, Napoléon III and his chief architect, Baron Haussmann, demolished
much of the crumbling medieval Paris to lay out the wide boulevards
that still connect the various monuments in broad, well-proportioned
Chapter 2: Digging Deeper into France 27

vistas. New building techniques were developed, including the use of
iron as the structural support of bridges, viaducts, and buildings — such
as the National Library, completed in 1860.
Following the Second Empire, the coming of the Third Republic brought
the Industrial Age to French architecture. The Paris Exposition in 1878
launched this revolution. But it was the Exposition of 1889 that stunned
the world when Alexandre-Gustave Eiffel designed and erected the most
frequently slurred building of its day, the Eiffel Tower, for the Paris
Exposition that year.
As a direct rebellion against this industrial architecture, the Art Nouveau
movement came into being with its asymmetrical and curvaceous designs,
using stained glass, tiles, wrought iron, and other materials. Art Nouveau
was more a decorative movement than an architectural one. French for
“New Art,” Art Nouveau peaked at the turn of the 20th century, having
been launched in the 1880s. One of the most important characteristics of
this style is a dynamic, undulating, and flowing curved “whiplash” line of
syncopated rhythm. Hyperbolas and parabolas were used in this expres-
sion, and conventional moldings sprang to life and just seemed to “grow”
into plant-derived forms.
At the dawn of the 20th century, the Beaux Arts style of architecture
was all the rage, the name coming form the École des Beaux Arts in
Paris. Exquisite Beaux Arts buildings with ornate facades were erected
throughout Paris, most of the structures at the same height, giving the
city an evenly spaced skyline and justifying its claim as the most beauti-
ful city in the world. This new movement added garlands of laurel and
olive branches to the gray-white stone of elegant apartment buildings
and hotels throughout France.
At the time of the World’s Fair in Paris in 1925, Art Deco was a move-
ment in decorative arts that also affected architecture. Art Deco quickly
modulated into the 1930s Moderne, the decade with which the concept is
most strongly associated today. It is characterized by the use of such
materials as sharkskin and zebra skin, zigzag and stepped forms, bold
and sweeping curves (in contrast to the sinuous curves of Art Nouveau),
chevron patterns, and sunburst motifs. Art Deco was popular, and in
France everything from the interiors of movie houses to ocean liners
evoked this style. The enduring edifices of this Art Deco architecture are
not found in Paris today but in New York, as exemplified by the Empire
State Building and the Chrysler Building.
The latter 20th century was marred by controversy, as the late François
Mitterrand launched his grands projets to change the face of Paris. A tra-
ditionalist like Prince Charles, living across the Channel from France,
found much of this new architecture offensive. But the most cutting-edge
of French architects had high praise for such works as the controversial
Centre Pompidou, that modern art museum launched in 1977 with its
“guts” showing, including steel supports, plastic tube escalators, and
exposed pipes.

A Chinese American architect, I.M. Pei, added glass pyramids to the
17th-century courtyard of the Louvre in 1989, drawing screams of
protest. That same year Paris opened a curvaceous, dark glass mound
called Opera Bastille.
Taste of France: Local Cuisine
The French pride themselves on their food and wine, and you’ll have a
great time eating and drinking in the country. The first thing you may
notice is how fresh everything is. Perhaps it’s the soil (le terroir, as the
French call it) that seems to invest all produce with rich flavor. Almost
every town holds a daily fruit-and-vegetable market, so chefs throughout
France have an abundance of fresh produce at their disposal. And that
means you can stop at any market to soak in the atmosphere and gather
the fixings for a memorable pique-nique.
While in France, you’ll learn how to pace yourself through multicourse
meals, to look forward to the cheese course, and to never skip dessert.
With virtually no turnover of tables in French restaurants, customers are
expected to settle in for at least a two-hour meal. Service usually moves
at a leisurely pace because the idea is not to rush through the meal but
to linger and enjoy the experience.
Each province has its own distinctive cuisine. Of course, the rich and
varied restaurants of Paris showcase all of France. Every province of 
the country is represented by some bistro — often dozens of bistros —
serving the foodstuffs of each region.
Throughout this book, we provide recommendations on top restaurants
and medium-priced places that offer good value so that you can enjoy
this most special cuisine. We also highlight the rich and specialized cui-
sine of specific regions in this book’s destination chapters.
Then there’s the wine. First made by monks in wineries in the south,
French wine is big business, yet it’s still essentially controlled by rela-
tively small-time farmers. Most restaurants have a good selection of
local vintages on hand, and you may be surprised at how reasonable the
prices are compared to what you’d be charged for a similar bottle at a
restaurant outside France. House wines, available by the glass and the
carafe, tend to be reasonably priced as well.
French cookery achieves palate perfection only when lubricated by wine,
which is not considered a luxury or even an addition, but rather an inte-
gral part of every meal. Certain rules about wine drinking have been long
established in France, but no one except traditionalists seems to follow
them anymore. Those “rules” would dictate that if you’re having a roast,
steak, or game, a good burgundy should be your choice. If it’s chicken,
lamb, or veal, you’d choose a red from the Bordeaux country, and cer-
tainly a full-bodied red with Camembert (a cheese) and a blanc de blanc
Chapter 2: Digging Deeper into France 29

with oysters. A light rosé can go with almost anything, especially if
enjoyed on a summer terrace overlooking a willow-fringed riverbank.
Let your own good taste — and sometimes almost equally important, your
pocketbook — determine your choice of wine. Most wine stewards, called
sommeliers, are there to help you in your choice, and only in the most dis-
honest of restaurants will they push you toward the most expensive selec-
tions. Of course, if you prefer only bottled water or perhaps a beer, then
be firm and order either without embarrassment. In fact, bottled water
might be a good idea at lunch if you’re planning to drive on the roads of
France later. Some restaurants include a beverage in their menu rates
(boisson compris), but that’s only in the cheaper places. Nevertheless,
some of the most satisfying wines we’ve drunk in France came from unla-
beled house bottles or carafes, called a vin de la maison. In general, unless
you’re a real connoisseur, don’t worry about labels and vintages.
When in doubt, you can rarely go wrong with a good burgundy or
Bordeaux, but you may want to be more adventurous than that. That’s
when the sommelier can help you, particularly if you tell him or her your
taste in wine (semidry or very dry, for example). State frankly how much
you’re willing to pay and what you plan to order for your meal. If you’re
dining with others, you may want to order two or three bottles with an
entire dinner, selecting a wine to suit each course. However, the French,
at even the most informal meals, and especially if there are only two per-
sons dining, select only one wine to go with all their platters, from hors
d’oeuvres to cheese. As a rule of thumb, expect to spend about one-third
of the restaurant tab for wine.
Word to the Wise: The Local Lingo
You’re going to France, so why not try to learn a little of the language? At
the very least, try to learn a few numbers, basic greetings, and — above
all — the life raft, parlez-vous anglais? (Do you speak English?) As it
turns out, many people do speak passable English and will use it liber-
ally if you demonstrate the basic courtesy of greeting them in their lan-
guage. Bonne chance.
The Cheat Sheet at the front of this book has a list of many of the
common words, phrases, and numbers you’ll have a chance to use while
in France. And the Quick Concierge appendix at the end of this book
offers a few more specific phrases to keep in mind while in France.
Taking it one step further, you may even want to invest in a copy of
French Phrases For Dummies (Wiley Publishing, Inc.), by Dodi-Katrin
Schmidt, Michelle M. Williams, and Dominique Wenzel.

Background Check: Recommended 
Books and Movies
You can find numerous books on all aspects of French history and soci-
ety, ranging from the very general, such as the section on France in the
Encyclopedia Americana, International Edition (Grolier), which presents
an illustrated overview of the French people and their way of life, to the
specific, such as Judi Culbertson and Tom Randall’s Permanent Parisians:
An Illustrated Guide to the Cemeteries of Paris (Chelsea Green), which
depicts the lives of many famous people who are buried in Paris.
 History: Two books that present French life and society in the 17th
century are Warren Lewis’s The Splendid Century (William Morrow),
and Madame de Sévigne’s Selected Letters, edited by Leonard W.
Tancock (Penguin), which contains witty letters to her daughter
during the reign of Louis XIV. Simon Schama’s Citizens (Alfred A.
Knopf) touts itself a “a magnificent and very electrifyingly new his-
tory of the French Revolution” — long, but enjoyable.
Moving into the 20th century, Pleasure of the Belle Epoque:
Entertainment and Festivity in Turn-of-the-Century France, by Charles
Rearick (Yale University Press), depicts public diversions in the
changing and troubled times of the Third Republic. Paris Was
Yesterday, 1925–1939 (Harcourt Brace Jovanovich), is a collection of
excerpts from Janet Flanner’s “Letters from Paris” column of The
New Yorker. Larry Collins and Dominique Lapierre have written a
popular history of the liberation of Paris in 1944 called Is Paris
Burning? (Warner Books).
Two unusual approaches to French history are Rudolph Chlemin-
ski’s The French at Table (William Morrow), a funny, honest history
of why the French know how to eat better than anyone, and Paris: A
Century of Change, 1878–1978, by Normal Evenson (Yale University
Press), a study of the urban development of Paris.
 Autobiography: You can get a different look at history by reading
memoirs of writers’ experiences in France. Among the best are 
A Moveable Feast (Collier Books), Ernest Hemingway’s recollections
of Paris in the 1920s, and Morley Callaghan’s That Summer in Paris:
Memories of Tangled Friendships with Hemingway, Fitzgerald and
Some Others, an account of the same period. Another interesting
read is The Autobiography of Alice B. Toklas, by Gertrude Stein
(Vintage Books). It’s an account of 30 years in Paris and the biogra-
phy of Gertrude Stein.
 The arts: Much of France’s beauty is expressed in its art. Three
books that approach France from this perspective are The History
of Impressionism, by John Rewald (Museum of Modern Art), a col-
lection of documents (both writing and quotations by the artists)
illuminating this period in the history of art; The French Through
Their Films, by Robin Buss (Ungar), an exploration of the history
Chapter 2: Digging Deeper into France 31

and themes of more than 100 films; and The Studios of Paris: The
Capital of Art in the Late Nineteenth Century, by John Milner (Yale
University Press). Milner presents the forces that made Paris one of
the most complex centers of the art world in the early modern era.
Nightlife of Paris: The Art of Toulouse-Lautrec, by Patrick O’Connor
(Universe), is an enchanting 80-page book with lively anecdotes
about the hedonistic luminaries of Belle Epoque Paris, with paint-
ings, sketches, and lithographs by the artist. Olympia: Paris in the
Age of Manet, by Otto Friedrich (HarperCollins), takes its inspira-
tion from the artwork in the Musée d’Orsay. From here the book
takes off on an anecdote-rich chain of historical associations, trac-
ing the rise of the Impressionist school of modern painting but
incorporating social commentary too, such as the pattern of prosti-
tution and venereal disease in 19th-century France.
 Fiction: The Chanson de Roland, written between the 11th and 14th
centuries, is the earliest and most celebrated of the “songs of
heroic exploits.” The Misanthrope and Tartuffe are two masterful
satires on the frivolity of the 17th century by the great comic
dramatist Molière. François-Marie Arouet Voltaire’s Candide is a
classic satire attacking both the philosophy of optimism and the
abuses of the ancient régime.
A few of the masterpieces of the 19th century are Madame Bovary,
by Gustave Flaubert (Random House), in which the carefully wrought
characters, setting, and plot attest to the genius of Flaubert in pre-
senting the tragedy of Emma Bovary; Victor Hugo’s Les Misérables
(Modern Library), a classic tale of social oppression and human
courage set in the era of Napoléon I; and the collection Selected
Stories by the master of short stories, Guy de Maupassant (New
American Library).
Honoré de Balzac’s La comédie humaine depicts life in France from
the fall of Napoleon to 1848. Henry James’s The Ambassadors and
The American both take place in Paris. The Vagabond, by Colette,
evokes the life of a French music-hall performer.
Tropic of Cancer is the semiautobiographical story of Henry Miller’s
early years in Paris. One of France’s leading thinkers, Jean-Paul
Sartre, shows individuals struggling against their freedom in No Exit
and Three Other Plays (Random House).
 Films: The French are credited with technical inventions that made
film possible. French physicists laid the groundwork for the movie
camera as early as the mid–19th century. The world’s first movie
was shown in Paris on December 28, 1895, the creation of the
Lumière brothers. Charles Pathé and Leon Gaumont were the first
to exploit filmmaking on a grand scale, and by the 1920s the French
began to view filmmaking as an art form, infusing it with surreal
and Dada themes. French films — good or bad — continue to be
made today, although American movies dominate the market.

32

The biggest worldwide postmillennium hit was Amélie (2002), 
witnessed by millions across the globe. In the film, Amélie is an
attractive but introverted woman from a dysfunctional family. In
flashbacks we witness scenes from a troubled life. That old classic,
still widely shown, An American in Paris (1951), stars Gene Kelly at
his dancing best. The cinematography captures some of the most
enchanting sights of postwar Paris. The latest version of Moulin
Rouge (2001) starred Nicole Kidman in this pop-culture movie that
re-created Paris of the 1890s, with its cancan dancers and Toulouse-
Lautrec characters.
The big and most publicized French film of 2006 was Marie
Antoinette, directed and written by Sofia Coppola. It is a highly styl-
ized account of a naïve Viennese girl who, in 1774, became the
queen of France at age 19 — and it’s a sensory delight.

his chapter helps you decide which parts of France you want to visit
and when to go. We give you the pros and cons of each season so
that you can time your trip to make the most of your visit. We also pro-
vide a calendar of the most memorable annual events in France — you
may want to consider planning your trip to coincide with (or avoid) one
of these festivals, sporting events, or celebrations.
Going Everywhere You Want to Be
France For Dummies, 4th Edition, is a book of highlights, so you won’t
find a review of all of France’s regions (shown in the upcoming map,
“The Regions of France”). What follows are short sketches of each of the
regions covered in this book to help you choose where you want to go.
These locales are the ones with the best and most interesting sites —
the blockbusters of France.
Falling in love with Paris: From 
the Tour Eiffel to Montmartre
France’s capital, as you’ve probably heard, is one of the world’s most
beautiful, romantic, and exciting cities. Paris is so full of things to see
and do that you can’t possibly cover everything in one trip, even one
long trip. So don’t even try. You may have to limit your sightseeing to the
greatest hits — Tour Eiffel, Cathédrale Notre-Dame and Sainte-Chapelle,
Musée du Louvre, Musée d’Orsay, and Montmartre and Sacré-Coeur —
to leave plenty of time for strolling, shopping, and enjoying cafe life. If
you start to become overwhelmed by all the choices, chill out with a

boat ride on the Seine or a picnic in the Jardin du Luxembourg. One
thing to consider about Paris: Expect rain every day, and you won’t be
disappointed. (See Chapters 11 and 12 for details on Paris.)
Don’t forget the famous sights just outside the city (see Chapter 13),
such as Louis XIV’s Château de Versailles, the Cathédrale Notre-Dame in
Chartres, the Renaissance castle of Fontainebleau, Monet’s house at
Giverny (with its famous waterlily pond), and even Disneyland Paris.
Exploring the Loire Valley châteaux
The Loire Valley, an hour’s train ride from Paris, is where France’s 
royalty lived for hundreds of years, and their castles — many of them
Renaissance masterpieces — are a thrill to visit. Because more than a
dozen famous châteaux are within about 97km (60 miles), this region is
easy to explore. You’ll even see plenty of people biking from castle to
castle. We give you the lowdown on eight “fairytale” castles, including
Chambord, the largest, and Chenonceau, the most beautiful (see Chapter
15). Two to four castles in one trip are about right before châteaux
fatigue kicks in. We also introduce you to Tours (see Chapter 14) and
Orléans (see Chapter 15), cities that bookend the region and are good
bases from which to explore the Vallée de la Loire.
Traveling through Normandy and Brittany
Normandy and Brittany, two regions on the west coast, offer a wealth 
of historic sites and captivating coastal views. Rouen, a little less than
an hour from Paris by the fast train, is a good place to see the Norman
architecture that many people think of as quintessentially ye olde world:
half-timbered houses on cobblestone pedestrian-only streets. In Rouen,
you also find several interesting museums and historic sites, many relat-
ing to Joan of Arc, who was burned alive at the stake in the central
square. And fans of Impressionism will enjoy seeing the elaborate
Cathédrale Notre-Dame in Rouen, which Monet, fascinated by its 
intricate facade, painted countless times.
Normandy also is the place to view two of France’s most famous historic
sights (see Chapter 16): the Bayeux Tapestry, in the charming village of
Bayeux, and Mont-St-Michel, the most famous of all abbeys set high on a
rock just off the coast. (Mont-St-Michel is very popular with visitors, so
we give you hints on how to avoid being trampled.) Many sightseers go
to Normandy just to see the D-day beaches, where thousands of American,
British, and Canadian troops bravely made their way on shore, paving
the way for the Allied defeat of the Nazis in World War II. The soldiers’
graveyards, white crosses stretching as far as the eye can see, may be
the most moving site in the area. The best season to see Normandy is in
spring, when apple orchards are in bloom, weather is fairly mild, and
fewer visitors are around.
Brittany’s rocky coast juts out along France’s western edge, and the
region is proud of its unique culture and language, which actually is

closer to Welsh than French (see Chapter 17). The coast is dotted with
fishing villages and pricey resorts. In Brittany, we take you to Quimper,
home of the famous pottery; Carnac, which has thousands of aligned
stones dating to Neolithic times; and Nantes, a lively city between
Brittany and the Loire Valley. Brittany is a more remote region, a little
harder to get to, which for some people makes it all the more attractive.
Coastal towns in Brittany are popular summer resorts, and if you want
to swim in the ocean, you’ll need to go during the height of summer
when the waters are warm enough. The fall and spring can be desolate
but appealing times to see this area — the crowds are few and villages
more peaceful.
Seeing the best of Provence and the Riviera
Provence and the Riviera are France’s most popular regions. That’s
because these areas are lovely places to visit, full of interesting sites, a
grand cuisine, and people who have a bit of Italian joie de vivre mixed in
with the classic French hauteur. And of course there’s the weather: mar-
velous sunny days with sea breezes year-round. In Provence, you can 
visit the great French towns of Avignon, home of the Palais des Papes;
Arles, with Roman ruins and memories of the artist Van Gogh; and Aix-en-
Provence, a beautiful city full of sparkling fountains. You can also explore
the quaint village of St-Rémy, with more Roman ruins and more memories
of Van Gogh. In Chapter 18, we also make a quick tour of Marseille, a
bustling metropolis and a major transportation hub in the south.
The Riviera has so many intriguing and chic resorts that it’s hard to
choose which one to visit (see Chapters 19, 20, and 21). We guide you
through the ten top French towns to visit plus the tiny principality of
Monaco. Along the coast from west to east are St-Tropez, Cannes,
Antibes, Nice, St-Jean-Cap-Ferrat, Beaulieu, and Monaco. In the hills
are Biot, Vence, and St-Paul-de-Vence. You can hang out at the most
fashionable beaches, stroll through cobblestone villages, see some of
France’s best modern art museums, and participate in the glamorous
nightlife. From the Monte Carlo Casino to the beaches of St-Tropez, this
slice of France is a slice of heaven.
Scheduling Your Time
When visiting France, a large country with so many diverse sights, the
biggest challenge may be deciding what regions you want to visit. You
can’t do it all, but you can see and do quite a bit in just a week. Here are
some things to keep in mind when planning your trip.
 Make choices. Choose one region or at most two adjoining regions
to visit in addition to Paris, unless you’re planning a long trip. You’ll
get a much better feel for the region you visit, and you won’t spend
so much time en route to places. Good regions to combine are Nor-
mandy and Brittany or Provence and the Riviera. Chapter 4 has
some good tips for combining these regions.
Part I: Introducing France 
38

 Take the train. France’s train system is exceptionally fast and effi-
cient. The best way to travel to the regions described in this book is
to catch a train from Paris and then either rent a car or rely on public
transportation to get around. That way, you’ll at least avoid driving
in and out of Paris, which can be a nightmare. If possible, you also
want to avoid driving in and out of other large cities such as Nantes,
Rouen, and Nice. The outskirts of these cities aren’t at all scenic, and
the complex highways and tailgating drivers can make you loony.
In contrast to city driving, you’ll find that driving along country
roads in France can be a real pleasure. Roads are well marked and
often uncrowded. For more information about riding the rails and
other ways to get around France, check out Chapter 7.
 Avoid disappointment and book ahead. Many people visit France
regularly to stay at the top hotels and dine in the top restaurants. If
you’re planning to splurge on an expensive hotel or a gourmet meal,
book well ahead of time. A week or two in advance isn’t too early to
make a reservation for France’s top restaurants. Booking a couple
months in advance is a good idea for the best hotels.
 Expect strikes. France is infamous for its strikes, and the French
have a very blasé attitude toward what can be a major inconven-
ience. The more common strikes usually have to do with transporta-
tion. Railroad pull men on strike means no food or water on long
train rides. Air traffic controllers on strike leads to canceled flights
into, out of, and around the country. Gas delivery trucks on strike
means . . . well, you get the point. Our advice: Don’t cut it close with
travel plans. If you absolutely must be at a meeting back home on
Monday morning, you’d better plan to leave Saturday, not Sunday.
 Enjoy the lifestyle. One reason French people may not be as
annoyed by strikes as people of other nationalities is their fairly
laid-back attitude toward life. To the French, certain pleasures —
such as great food, fine wines, and beautiful art — make life worth
living. How does that affect you, the visitor? Instead of filling every
second of your day running from sight to sight, try to slow down a
little and appreciate the details. Spend an afternoon writing post-
cards in a cafe or strolling through a historic neighborhood. Amble
through a village market or visit an unusual monument.
 Adjust to French mealtimes. The French eat a light continental
breakfast, and you can learn to love a scrumptious pain au chocolat
and café au lait first thing in the morning. You’ll find that many
places are closed between noon and 2 p.m., when millions of French
people have a long lunch. Although you can probably find a museum
or a shop open during this time, in most of the country, do yourself
a favor and have lunch then, too. Although dinner starting after
7:30 p.m. may sound late, that long lunch tides you over until then.
The more you fit yourself into the French timetable, the more you’ll
enjoy your trip and feel like one of the natives.
Chapter 3: Deciding Where and When to Go 39

Revealing the Secrets of the Seasons
As in much of Europe, high season in France is summer, and low season
is winter, leaving the shoulder seasons of spring and fall as good times to
visit (fewer crowds, decent weather). One exception to this rule is winter
on the Riviera, which is popular with retirees. Paris is a rainy city much
of the year and quite cold and bleak during winter, but in those dark
days of February, the crowds are low and so are the airfares.
The French government has mandated that store sales happen semi-
annually in January and in late June/early July. The sales (solders) last
for several weeks; you find the most frenzied activity in the north (Paris
and environs) and in the south (the Riviera and environs). Every French
person takes a vacation in August, so you find the biggest crowds that
month and a number of closings at restaurants, particularly in Paris.
Many stores, restaurants, and hotels throughout the country also close
for a few weeks in December or January. But one of the best things about
a summer visit is that you can bask in daylight that lasts until 10 p.m.
Tables 3-1 and 3-2 give you an idea of what the temperature and rainfall
are like in Paris and Nice throughout the year.

Spring
Cole Porter wrote “I love Paris in the springtime,” and with good reason.
The parks and gardens of Paris (and those at Versailles, Fontainebleau,
and Claude Monet’s Giverny) are at their colorful, fragrant best in early
May.
 Spring is off season, so you’ll be blessed with short lines for sights
and museums.
 You may also be able to get reservations in the country’s top
restaurants, which are fully booked come summer.
But keep in mind that April in Paris isn’t as temperate as Porter would
have you believe.
 Nearly every Monday in May is a holiday in France, so stores may
be closed and other venues affected.
 Unless you’re a racecar fanatic, don’t go anywhere near Monaco
during the Grand Prix in mid-May. Hotel prices in Monaco and sur-
rounding towns are at their highest and booked well in advance.
 Count on the weather being very fickle, so pack for warm, cold,
wet, dry, and every other eventuality (bring layers, and don’t even
think about coming without an umbrella).
Summer
High season in France can mean the best of worlds and the worst of
worlds. But the best are really great, making summer a fabulous time of
year to visit France.
 Wonderfully long and sultry days are summer’s hallmark — we’re
talking 6 a.m. sunrises and 10 p.m. sunsets — so you’re afforded
additional hours to wander and discover. Historic sites, museums,
and shops keep longer hours and usually are open during lunch,
unlike the rest of the year.
 You can find discounts of 30 percent to 50 percent in most stores
during late June and early July, one of the two big months for shop-
ping sales (Jan is the other).
 In areas such as Provence and the Riviera, cultural calendars are at
their fullest, including Nice’s Grand Parade du Jazz and the Festival
d’Avignon and Festival d’Aix-en-Provence. (Summer also is the time
to attend cultural festivals through the rest of the country. And the
great bike race, Le Tour de France, takes place in July.)
 Although the celebration of Bastille Day (July 14) through most of
France means that stores and most attractions are closed, in Paris,
festivals are held and panoramic fireworks take place at Tour Eiffel.
Chapter 3: Deciding Where and When to Go 41

If you’re concerned about costs and convenience, a summer visit defi-
nitely offers greater costs and less convenience.
 The influx of visitors during summer means long lines at museums
and other attractions throughout the country.
 The top restaurants and the best or most affordable hotels may be
booked. And airfares reach their peak.
 Expect traffic-clogged highways, especially in Provence and the
Riviera.
 Because most French people take their vacations in August, you’ll
find tourist areas packed throughout the country.
 In Paris, the city’s cultural calendar slows down, and some shops
and restaurants close for the entire month of August.
Autumn
Fall is a mellow time to visit France, and the days often are clear and
crisp.
 The wine harvest starts mid- to late September, and by mid-
October the country’s vineyards are a golden color.
 Paris crackles back to life come September, one of the most excit-
ing times of the year, when important art exhibits open along with
trendy new restaurants, shops, and cafes.
 Airfares drop from their summertime highs.
During the fall months, you may find yourself jostling with a more decid-
edly business-oriented crowd returning from a late-summer respite.
 Finding a hotel at the last minute can be difficult because of the
number of business conventions and trade shows happening in
Paris and other cities such as Orléans, Tours, Rouen, Nantes,
Cannes, and Nice.
 Transportation strikes of varying intensities traditionally occur
during fall — some may go virtually unnoticed by the average trav-
eler, but others can be a giant hassle.
 In some seashore areas, such as Brittany, certain restaurants close
for a couple of weeks in October to take a breather from the busy
summer.
Winter
Back in the ’50s, you didn’t go to France in winter unless you had busi-
ness there. That has changed, and a winter vacation in France can seem
almost . . . well, profitable.
Part I: Introducing France 
42

 Look for bargain airfares and various discounts. Airlines and tour
operators offer unbeatable prices on flights and package tours.
 Lines at museums and other sights mercifully are short.
 Shoppers can save up to 50 percent during the January sales.
Of course, winter weather may be enough to dampen the spirits of some
warm-blooded travelers.
 In Paris, winter is gray (sometimes the sun doesn’t shine for
weeks), dreary, and often bone-chillingly damp.
 Look out for those wind tunnels that lash up and down the grand
boulevards in all French cities. (Bring a warm, preferably water-
proof, coat.)
 You’ll miss the wonderful cafe life that takes place in France in fair
weather.

July
Les Baroquiales is a cultural festival that spotlights the baroque style,
the 17th-century mode of art and architecture that features elaborate
ornamentation. Events are presented cooperatively by tourism bureaus
with music, theater, and dance concerts joining walking tours and village
fairs. Because this annual event is relatively new, you won’t find as many
crowds or problems with reservations. For details, call % 04-93-04-92-
05. Early July; towns near the French Riviera and Italian border.
The biggest party on Bastille Day takes place in Paris. Citywide festivi-
ties begin the evening of July 13, with street fairs, pageants, and feasts.
Free bals (dances) are open to everyone and held in fire stations all over
the city. (Some of the best bals are in the fire station on rue du Vieux-
Colombier near place St-Sulpice, 6e; rue Sévigné, 4e; and rue Blanche,
near place Pigalle, 9e.) On July 14, a big military parade starts at 10 a.m.
on the Champs-Elysées; get there early if you hope to see anything. A
sound-and-light show with fireworks takes place that night at the Tro-
cadéro. Rather than face the crowds, many people watch the fireworks
from the Champs de Mars across the river, from hotel rooms with views,
or even from rue Soufflot, in front of the Panthéon. July 14; countrywide.
The most famous bicycle race in the world, Le Tour de France covers
more than 2,000 miles throughout France and always ends on the Champs-
Elysées in Paris. Spectators need special invitations for a seat in the
stands near place de la Concorde, but you can see the cyclists at street
level farther up the Champs-Elysées and, depending on the route (which
changes each year), elsewhere in the city. Check the newspapers the day
before. For details, call % 01-41-33-15-00 or visit www.letour.fr. First
three weeks of July; countrywide.
The Orangerie in the Bagatelle gardens on the edge of the Bois de
Boulogne is the backdrop for the much-loved Festival Chopin à Paris,
an annual series of daily piano recitals. For details, call % 01-45-00-
22-19; www.frederic-chopin.com. Early July; Paris.
Inspired by the great American jazz performers, the Nice Jazz Festival
(Grand Parade du Jazz) is one of the Riviera’s biggest annual events.
This international jazz festival attracts famous soloists and bands to the
spectacular site of the Roman Amphitheater and gardens of Cimiez, the
hill north of the city. In the past, performers such as Dizzy Gillespie and
Chapter 3: Deciding Where and When to Go 45

Herbie Hancock have brought down the house. For details, call % 04-92-
14-46-46 or visit www.nicejazzfest.com. Mid-July; Nice.
As a world-class cultural event, the Festival d’Avignon presents works
in theater, dance, and music from international troupes. The focus of
this prestigious festival usually is on the avant-garde; tickets are pricey.
During the same period as the festival, another festival called Festival

expensive events and less established performers. For details, call 
% 04-90-27-66-50 or visit www.festival-avignon.com. Three weeks in
July; Avignon.
Although primarily a music festival with a wide range of styles, from
medieval to contemporary, the events of the Festival d’Aix-en-Provence
are more affordable than the one in the previously described neighbor-
ing festival at Avignon. For details, call % 04-42-17-34-34 or visit www.
festival-aix.com. Four weeks in July; Aix-en-Provence.
September
Off-limits palaces, churches, and other official buildings throw open

music. For details, call % 01-46-06-00-32. First or second Saturday of
October; Paris.
Les Voiles de St-Tropez is a regatta for antique wooden sailboats in St-
Tropez on the Riviera. It’s a tossup whether the most beautiful sight is
when all the boats are under full sail in the bay or when they’re all

hulls. During the weeklong festival, the town is full of youthful sailors
from around the world, and evenings are very lively. For details, call

Chapter 4
Four Great France
Itineraries
In This Chapter
 Touring France in one or two weeks
 Visiting France with your kids
 Taking a tour for art lovers
I
n this chapter, we put together several itineraries to help you plan
your trip to France. If you’re a first-time or time-pressed traveler with
one or two weeks to spend in France, you may find it helpful to have
some premier destinations and sights laid out in an easy-to-follow order.
Or if you’ve been to France before, perhaps you’d like to concentrate
your upcoming visit on food and wine or great art. You can have an
extraordinary taste of the country in just one or two well-planned weeks.
Most of the regions we describe in this book are within a short train ride
of Paris. That means you can easily combine a few days in the capital
with visits to the highlights of Normandy and the Loire Valley, both only
one or two hours away by train. Brittany and Provence are slightly longer
trips by train (three to four hours). If you’re traveling from Paris to Nice
on the Riviera (six-and-a-half hours), you may want to take a very early
train, so you don’t spend the whole day traveling.
Be flexible while traveling: If you end up loving a town that you were
supposed to stay in for just one night, you can change things around and
stay for two nights or more. We once ran into a couple in St-Tropez who
were scheduled to be traveling all along the Riviera but decided to stay
anchored at the resort in St-Tropez for their entire trip.
The following itineraries take you through some wonderful towns and
past some major sights (see the map of “Four Great France Itineraries”
later in this chapter). The pace may be a bit breathless for some people,
so be sure to skip a sight occasionally to have some down time. Of
course, you can use any of these itineraries as a jumping-off point to
develop a sojourn of your own that matches your personal interests.

Seeing France’s Highlights in One Week
Use the following itinerary to make the most of your week in France, but
feel free to leave out a sight or two to explore a charming village or to
save a day just to relax. One week is far too rushed, of course, but if it’s
all that you can schedule during this trip, this itinerary at least gives you
an introduction to Paris and a chance to see some of the sights of
Normandy, a region on the west coast of France not too far from Paris.
 Take a flight that arrives in Paris as early as possible on Day One.
Check into your hotel and hit the nearest cafe for a pick-me-up café
au lait and a croissant before sightseeing. Try to see one major and
one minor (that is, one that’s less time-consuming) attraction your
first day in Paris. Major sights include Musée du Louvre, Tour
Eiffel, Musée d’Orsay, and Cathédrale Notre-Dame. Not-so-major
attractions include Arc de Triomphe, Sainte-Chapelle and the
Conciergerie, Musée National Auguste-Rodin, Centre Pompidou,
Jardin des Tuilleries and Jardin du Luxembourg, and Montmartre
and Sacré-Coeur. Buy and send postcards if you like and wander
around a bit to get your bearings. That night, enjoy dinner at the
famous brasserie Bofinger or one of the many restaurants in the
increasingly stylish Marais district.
 On Day Two, try to see one major and two minor sights. Of course,
on the way to these sights, in particular Notre-Dame and Sainte-
Chapelle, you’ll inevitably have quintessential Paris experiences
such as walking along the quais of the Seine and visiting the St-
Germain-des-Près neighborhood on the Left Bank. For more infor-
mation on the attractions of Paris, refer to Chapter 12.
 On Day Three, take an early morning train to Versailles (see
Chapter 13). You need several hours to tour the palace and the 
gardens. Return in the afternoon for tea at Angelina, shopping at
the fancy-food shop Fauchon, and a late dinner.
 On Day Four, take an early train to Rouen in Normandy (see
Chapter 16), check your bags at the Rouen train station, and walk
around the city for a couple of hours, looking at the half-timbered
buildings. After lunch, head back to the train station, rent a car
(and don’t forget to pick up your bags!), and drive to Bayeux,
where you’ll spend the night. On the way, you can stop to explore
the beautiful Abbaye de Jumièges.
 On the morning of Day Five, see the Bayeux Tapestry and then
drive to the D-day beaches, stopping at the American Cemetery
and the Caen Memorial. That evening, drive to Mont-St-Michel
(less than two hours), and stay overnight in the pedestrian village
on the rock. If it’s summer, you can take an illuminated night tour of
the abbey — after most of the other visitors have gone home. See
Chapter 16 for more details.
Chapter 4: Four Great France Itineraries 49

 Or you can do the first tour in the morning on Day 6 before all the
buses arrive. Then drive back to Rouen, and catch a train back to
Paris and your flight home.
Seeing France’s Highlights in Two Weeks
With two weeks to explore France, you have some breathing room — 
but not that much. If you don’t mind the rush, you can also see several
regions: Paris (Chapter 12), two Loire Valley castles (Chapter 15), a
couple of towns in Provence (Chapter 18), and several towns on the
Riviera, including Monaco (Chapter 20).
 You can spend Days One, Two, and Three in Paris, as covered
under “Seeing France’s Highlights in One Week.”
 On Day Four, leave Paris on an early train to Orléans (trip time:
one-and-a-quarter hours). Rent a car in Orléans, and drive to the
Château de Chambord, the largest and most impressive of Loire
Valley castles. That afternoon, drive to Amboise to stay overnight
and visit the Château d’Amboise and Leonardo da Vinci’s former
residence. (See Chapter 15 for more on the Loire Valley.)
 On Day Five, get an early start, and return the rental car in Orléans.
You face a choice now: You can take a morning train from Orléans
to Paris’s Gare d’Austerlitz and then catch the Métro or a taxi to
the Gare de Lyon, where you’ll hop on a TGV (fast train) to Avignon
(3 hours, 20 minutes). Or you can board a train from Orléans to
Lyon and change to a train for Avignon. Check into your hotel in
Avignon. You should have time to wander through the town to get
your bearings, buy some colorful Provençal fabrics, and see one of
the smaller sights, such as the Pont St-Bénézet (also known as the
Bridge of Avignon) or the Musée du Petit-Palais. (See Chapter 18
for details on Provence.)
 On the morning of Day Six, visit the Palais des Papes. After lunch,
rent a car and drive to St-Tropez, where you can wander around
the village and people-watch from a cafe along the harbor. Spend
the night in St-Tropez. See Chapter 21 for more details.
 On Day Seven, hit the beach in St-Tropez or visit the Musée de
l’Annonciade, with its selection of Impressionist paintings — 
perhaps both. In the afternoon, drive to Nice (108km/67 miles).
Check into your hotel, wander through the old town, stroll on the
promenade des Anglais, lie on the beach, walk through the Marché
aux Fleurs, or visit one of the less time-consuming sights, such 
as the Palais Lascaris, Musée International d’Art Naïf Anatole-
Jakovsky, Musée des Beaux-Arts, Cathédrale Orthodoxe Russe St-
Nicholas à Nice, Musée d’Art Moderne et d’Art Contemporain, or
Musée d’Art et d’Histoire (Palais Masséna). During the day, stop
for a snack of socca, a round crepe made with chickpea flour that’s
sold steaming hot by street vendors. Have dinner at one of the

charming restaurants in Nice’s old town. You can also take the
Train Touristique de Nice for a 40-minute sightseeing ride past the
major sights. (For detailed information on towns along the Riviera,
go to Chapters 20 and 21.)
 On Days Eight and Nine, explore more of Nice, and head up to the
suburb of Cimiez to see the Musée Matisse, Monastère de Cimiez,
and Roman ruins, all next to one another, and the Musée National
Message Biblique Marc Chagall, a short drive away. On Day Ten,
drive to Monaco. On the way, stop in Beaulieu for lunch and to see

the Villa Kérylos, a replica of an ancient Greek residence that over-
looks the sea. Arrive in Monaco, check into your hotel, get decked
out, have dinner at the Café de Paris, and head to the Monte Carlo
Casino for some glamorous gambling.
 On Day Eleven, explore Monaco’s many sights, such as the chang-
ing of the guards in front of the Palais du Prince (and the interior,
called the Grands Appartements du Palais); the Jardin Exotique,
a cactus garden built into the side of a rock; the Musée Océano-
graphique, which includes one of Europe’s best aquariums; the
Collection des Voitures Anciennes de S.A.S. le Prince de Monaco,
Prince Rainier’s personal antique-car collection; and the Musée
National de Monaco, with a large antique-doll collection.
 On Day Twelve, head back toward Avignon to return the rental car,
stopping for an overnight on the way in one of three towns: St-Paul-
de-Vence, a hilltop village of art galleries; Grasse, an ancient town
and the perfume capital of France; or Aix-en-Provence, one of
France’s most beautiful cities.
 After your stay in one of these charming towns, drop off the car in
Avignon on Day Thirteen and then take the rapid TGV train back to
Paris for your return flight home.
Discovering France with Kids in One Week
France offers many attractions that kids enjoy. Perhaps your main con-
cern with having children along is pacing yourself with museum time.
Some sights you see may not interest children. Make a deal with them:
Promise to take them to where they want to go if they agree to accom-
pany you to what you want to see.
 For Day One, two of the major attractions of Paris for children and
adults alike are Tour Eiffel (kids love the elevator) and Notre-Dame
(be sure to point out the gargoyles at the top). You can work in
both of these attractions and perhaps take them on a boat ride
along the Seine.
 For Day Two, spend as much time as you can at the Musée du
Louvre. Your kids may also find objects here to fascinate them. But
break up this museum tour by taking advantage of some of the city’s
parks and gardens with playgrounds for children. Two favorites are
Jardin du Luxembourg, with a popular playground and puppet
shows, and Jardin des Tuilleries, with a fountain used for toy boats
and, in summer, a grand toue (Ferris wheel). Take the kids for a stroll
along one of the Left Bank neighborhoods at night, stopping in at a
bistro patronized by French families. See Chapters 11 and 12 for
more details about Paris.
 On Day Three, head for Disneyland Paris, which needs no intro-
duction to most kids. You can spend the night here, of course, or
you can return to Paris by fast train that night to avoid the trouble
Part I: Introducing France 
52

of switching hotels. See Chapter 13 for more details about
Disneyland French style.
 Because most kids love a beach vacation, and almost everyone
appreciates the charms of the French Riviera, fly from Paris to the
airport at Nice for Day Four. You can also take the high-speed TGV
train south from Paris to Nice. The Riviera, and Nice in particular,
have much to entertain you and your brood. Instead of heavy sight-
seeing the first day, take the kids to the beach in the afternoon. The
people-watching alone is likely to leave them wide-eyed (be aware
that they’ll see plenty of skin; topless bathing is rampant). You can
always find plenty of free entertainment along promenade des
Anglais (the boardwalk) in summer in Nice. Dine that night in a typi-
cal family restaurant in the old town. See Chapter 20 for more details.
 On Day Five, rise early in the morning, and take the fast train link-
ing Nice with the tiny principality of Monaco. Kids enjoy the formal
changing-of-the-guard ceremony at the palace and the tour of the
interior apartments. But the best part of Monaco for kids is the
Musée Océanographique, one of Europe’s best and biggest aquar-
iums, with lots of sharks and other exotic sea creatures. Monaco
also has the Collection des Voitures Anciennes de S.A.S. le Prince
de Monaco, Prince Rainier’s personal antique-car collection, and
the Musée National de Monaco, with a large antique-doll collec-
tion. Return to your hotel at Nice for the night.
 On Day Six, we recommend that you rent a car and drive (carefully,
of course) along the Grande Corniche of the Riviera. For example,
if you head east to Menton, near the Italian border, you’re treated
to one of the most spectacular scenic drives in France. The morn-
ing route along the loftiest highway, the Grande Corniche, includes
stopovers at La Turbie and Le Vistaero, the principal towns along
this 32km (20-mile) stretch. In the afternoon you can meander much
more slowly on the way back by taking the lower road (the same
distance), which is called Corniche Infèrieure. You’ll pass through
the ports of Villefranche, Cap-Ferrat, and Beaulieu, among others.
Carry your bathing suits to get in at least two hours of beaching it
before your return to Nice that night. See Chapter 20 for more
details.
 On Day Seven, you can leave Nice by plane, flying back to Paris,
where you can take a late-afternoon stroll along the Seine and its
bridges. After a final French family-style meal, plan to return to
your destination in the morning.
Taking the Art Buff’s Tour
The art lover’s tour of France begins, quite naturally, in the city of Paris.
We probably don’t really need to tell you that Paris is one of the great
cities for art.
Chapter 4: Four Great France Itineraries 53

 You can spend two weeks at the Musée du Louvre and still not see
everything. But count on spending at least half of Day One here.
Save the city’s other great museum, Musée d’Orsay, for another
day; the Louvre and d’Orsay are a bit much to tackle on the same
day. Instead, visit one of the minor Left Bank museums. We recom-
mend a blissful afternoon spent at the Musée de Cluny.
 On Day Two, tackle the Musée d’Orsay for its Impressionists. For
the afternoon head for the Musée Picasso.
 On Day Three, your final look at Paris, visit the Centre Pompidou
in the morning and explore the National Auguste-Rodin Museum in
the afternoon. If you have time, check out what’s happening at the
Grand Palais, which usually has a blockbuster art exhibit going on,
for which you’ll need to reserve a ticket in advance.
For details on these attractions of Paris, refer to Chapter 12.
 On Day Four, after you’ve had a taste of the art offerings of Paris,
take a day trip to the town of Giverny (easily reached by train).
Here you can visit Monet’s house and gardens, where you can
ponder the famous lily pond. Return to Paris for one final night. See
Chapter 13 for details.
 On Day Five, fly to Nice on the French Riviera or else take a high-
speed TGV train south. Because you’ll spend most of your day in
transit, you may have time on your first day only to see the museums
of Matisse and Chagall in the suburb of Cimiez. See Chapter 20 for
more details.
 While still based in Nice for Day Six, easy day trips west by car
rental take you to the Chapelle du Rosaire, designed by Matisse in
Venice, and the prestigious Fondation Maeght in St-Paul-de-Vence.
These two towns are the most famous hill towns of the Riviera.
When not exploring the chapel or the foundation, you can wander
about on foot, taking in their treasures. See Chapter 20 for more
details.
 On Day Seven, hop in your rental car, and head west again. This
time you can visit some of France’s best modern art collections,
spending the morning at Musée National Fernand-Léger at Biot 
followed by Musée Picasso at Antibes. Return to Paris for the night
and your flight home.

Part II
Planning Your 
Trip to France

In this part . . . 
P
art I covers the basics, but this part gets down to
speciﬁcs: the detailed information you need to book
your trip. Chapter 5 covers how to plan a realistic budget,
how to cut costs, and how to handle money, among other
subjects. Chapter 6 covers the various ways of getting to
France and saving some money in the process. Chapter 7
gives you information about getting around France after you
arrive. Chapter 8 discusses different styles of accommoda-
tions to choose from and how to book a room. Chapter 9
caters to special needs with advice to senior citizens, fami-
lies, and others. Chapter 10 takes care of details that many
people all too often leave until the last minute, including get-
ting a passport, thinking about medical and travel insurance,
and packing.

Chapter 5
Managing Your Money
In This Chapter
 Developing a workable budget
 Cutting costs
 Dealing with the local currency and taxes
S
oit raissonable (be reasonable), the French say, and being reason-
able is key to budgeting for a trip to France. Mentally walking
through what you’ll be spending on your trip from the moment you
leave to the minute you get back home is a good way to figure out a
budget (don’t forget to figure in your transportation to and from the air-
port). Then add in the flight cost (see Chapter 6 for tips on how to fly to
France for less), the price of getting from the airport to your hotel, your
hotel rates per day, meals, public transportation costs, admission prices
to museums and the theater, other entertainment expenses, and sou-
venir costs. Afterward, add 15–20 percent for good measure.
Planning Your Budget
Cities rarely are cheap or expensive across the board; Paris tends to be
pricey for dining but slightly more affordable for accommodations. Out-
side Paris, your euro goes further. For example, a four-course dinner in
provinces such as Normandy or Brittany costs the same as a two-course
dinner in Paris. Prices for historic sites are similar across the country.
This section covers some guidelines for what you’re likely to spend
while in France. For information about taxes, see the “Taking taxes into
account” section later in this chapter.
Table 5-1 gives you a taste of what things cost in Paris, while Table 5-2

Transportation
The biggest item in your budget probably will be your airline ticket to
France, and that is likely true even with those great deals that pop up in
winter. Every bargain hunter dreams of that one-way $99 fare from the
United States to a European capital such as Paris. And deals like that
occasionally appear. However, the more likely scenario is that you’ll get
differing results, which demonstrates the confusion of airline pricing
that can change from one hour to the next. Within a 48-hour period, calls
to Air France produced these results: The cheapest one-way fare from
New York to Paris was $1,925. Two hours later, the cheapest round-trip
fare from New York to Paris was $400. The least expensive fare on the
Internet was $262 NYC/Paris/NYC round-trip. Make sure that you check
out the money-saving tips in Chapter 6 before buying your airline tickets.
You have many options for transportation within France. You can get to
almost every town mentioned in this book by public transportation,
either train or bus. If you’re traveling long distances by train (say from
Paris to the Riviera), consider buying a France Railpass (see Chapter 7).
In Paris, the Métro has been the model for subways around the world
since its inauguration in 1900. It’s one of the best transit systems in
terms of price and efficiency. Getting across town in less than half an
hour is no problem, and the cost is lower when you purchase one of sev-
eral discount tickets, such as a carnet of ten (see Chapter 11 for options
and prices).
Renting a car gives you more flexibility than using public transportation,
but it’s expensive, mainly because of the high cost of gasoline, or petrol,
in Europe. For a medium-sized car holding 15 gallons, expect to pay at
least 79€, or $95, to fill up your tank. Because of uncertainty in the Mid-
dle East and other oil-producing regions, these figures can change radi-
cally overnight. You also must pay to park a car in most French cities and
towns. That said, several regions lend themselves to driving, including
the Loire Valley. And if you want to see some of the smaller towns on the
Riviera, a rental car is the best way.
As for cars in Paris, well, expect your heart to be in your throat the entire
time you drive in the city — unless, of course, you thrive on dealing with
labyrinthine one-way streets, a dearth of parking spaces, hellish traffic,
and the statistically worst drivers in Europe. If you want to rent a car to
see other parts of France or make a day trip outside Paris, do it on your
way out of the city (see Chapter 11 for addresses and phone numbers of
Paris car-rental agencies).
Lodging
Before you start shelling out money for lodging, think about how much
time you’ll actually spend in your room. For 75€ to 100€ ($98–$130) in
Paris, and slightly less in the rest of the country, you can rent a clean but
functionally furnished hotel room with a private bathroom and cable TV.
Though these kinds of budget rooms normally are comfortable and have
Chapter 5: Managing Your Money 59

basic furnishings and décor, they’re supplied with thin but serviceable
towels and a less-than-stellar array of toiletries (often just a bar of soap).
For 130€ ($169) and up — and we do mean up — the upper-tier hotels
offer bigger rooms and more services, such as room service and air 
conditioning.
Hotel rates can vary regionally, from the most popular areas to the least
visited. In addition, hotels in virtually all regions covered in this book
charge higher rates during summer. The prices are highest in Paris,
especially compared with what you can get for the same price in other
regions. Expenses also are high on the Riviera, which has some of
France’s most famous palace hotels. Nevertheless, you can find medium-
priced and even cheap hotels in every town in this book, and we give
you a wide range of choices. You may want to plan to splurge one or two
nights, just to get a feel for how wonderful the service is and how exqui-
site the accommodations are in France’s top hotels.
You can certainly save money by not having breakfast at your hotel,
which normally runs 12€ ($16) for a continental breakfast (hot bever-
age, bread, croissant) at medium-priced hotels. You can get the same
food for less by bellying up to the counter at a cafe nearby and thus feel
more like a resident.
Dining
Unless you like expensive hotels, expect to pay more for dining in France
than for lodging. The French consider dining out one of the finer joys in
life, although they pay dearly for it, you still can get a memorable five-
course meal with wine at a medium-priced restaurant anywhere in
France, except Paris, for about 35€ to 65€ ($46–$85) per person. In
Paris, that amount gets you a decent three-course meal. Paris also has a
wide range of cheaper dining options (in addition to the most expensive
restaurants in France). For example, you can find restaurants serving
satisfying two-course meals for as little as 30€ ($39) and good-tasting
ethnic food and sandwich shops that help you save even more money.
The best way to save money on meals in France is by choosing what’s
called le menu or prix fixe, a fixed-price meal with two or three choices
for each course (first course, main course, dessert). The prix fixe menu
often includes a cheese course or a choice between a cheese course and
a dessert course. At better restaurants, the prix fixe menu includes two
main courses: a fish course and a meat course. At top restaurants, you’ll
see a very expensive menu dégustation, or tasting menu, which includes
a selection of the chef’s specialties. Choosing a prix fixe menu always is
cheaper and a much better value than ordering à la carte.
Alas, le menu is less common at restaurants in Paris than it is outside
Paris, where you can find at least two and sometimes five or six menus
to choose from. If you choose a medium-priced menu (not the cheapest,
not the most expensive), you usually get an excellent meal, which often
includes chef’s specialties and high-quality items such as the catch of
Part II: Planning Your Trip to France

the day. Sometimes menus include a glass of wine with one or more
courses, and some even feature coffee at the end of the meal.
If your budget is limited, consider buying a picnic lunch or dinner at a
town or village market. You’ll be wowed by the selection of fresh pro-
duce, breads, meats, and cheeses on display. Purchase a bottle of wine
at a grocery store, and you’re all set for an idyllic French meal. For this
type of meal, a Swiss army knife with corkscrew comes in handy.
Don’t think a cafe is a cheaper alternative to a restaurant. A simple meal
of croque-monsieur and pommes frites (a toasted ham-and-cheese sand-
wich with french fries) accompanied by a beer or soda can set you back
20€ to 25€ ($26–$33). You can get a much tastier meal for the same
price or less at a restaurant.
Sightseeing
Entry fees at museums and other sights can add up quickly. Refer first to
the money-saving advice in the upcoming section, “Cutting Costs — but
Not the Fun,” and then make a list of must-dos to get a feel for how much
money you need to set aside. Many towns in France, including Paris,
offer special museum passes that save you money if you plan to see
more than two attractions. These passes always are available at tourist
offices and sometimes even at the museums or historic sites. Through-
out this book, we let you know whether these passes are available. Keep
in mind that some sights are free on certain days (such as the first Sun
of every month). You can get this information at the local tourist office.
Shopping
France, especially Paris, is a shopper’s mecca, and shopkeepers arrange
their wares in windows so enticingly that you’ll be tempted to splurge.
Shopping is the most flexible part of your budget, and you’ll certainly
save plenty of money if you skip a few excursions. But France has mar-
velous things to buy, and in each chapter, we list some special shops in
which to look for souvenirs. You can find deals during semiannual sales
held in January and July, but remember that a steep 19.6 percent tax
(VAT or value-added tax) is added to most goods. If you live outside the
European Union, you’re usually entitled to get back part of the tax, if you
meet certain requirements (see the upcoming “Taking taxes into account”
section for more information).
Nightlife
Budget big if you plan to visit clubs and other nightspots. Clubs and
bars aren’t cheap in France, because cover charges and drinks really
add up. But nightlife also is one of the great pleasures of France, particu-
larly in Paris and other larger cities. So don’t forgo the spectacles at the
Moulin Rouge or Folies Bergère in Paris if you’ve always wanted to see
them. Just know beforehand that they charge a hefty fee for entry and
for alcoholic beverages. Plan on seeing the show without dinner, and
you’ll save some money.
Chapter 5: Managing Your Money 61

Some cities have free nightlife, such as street performers and musicians
along the beach promenade in Nice. In fact, just wandering around the
old cobblestone streets of most French towns in the evening is entertain-
ment enough.
Taking taxes into account
The price of all goods in France includes a 19.6 percent sales tax called
the détaxe, or value-added tax (VAT). If you live outside the European
Union, you can be reimbursed for part of the VAT you paid, but as always,
a catch is involved: You have to spend at least 184€ ($239) in the same
store on the same day. The amount of the refund varies from store to
store but generally comes out to about 13 percent of the price you paid
on the item. The Paris department stores, Au Printemps and Galeries
Lafayette, have special détaxe desks where clerks prepare your sales
invoices, but small shops don’t always have the necessary paperwork.
Cutting Costs — but Not the Fun
The small things are what tend to add up and burst your budget, but if
you keep the following common-sense travel tips in mind, you can avoid
some of the more common money-wasting traps.
 Go during the off season. If you can travel at nonpeak times
(Oct–Mar, for example), you’ll find hotel prices almost half the
price of peak months.
 Travel midweek. If you can travel on a Tuesday, Wednesday, or
Thursday, you may find cheaper flights to your destination. When
you ask about airfares, see whether you can get a cheaper rate by
flying on a different day. For more tips on getting good fares, see
Chapter 6.
 Try a package tour. For many destinations, you can book airfare,
hotel, ground transportation, and even some sightseeing just by
making one call to a travel agent or packager, for a price much less
than if you put the trip together yourself. (See Chapter 6 for more
on package tours.)
 Always ask for discount rates. Membership in travel associations,
frequent-flier plans, trade unions, seniors organizations, or other
groups may qualify you for savings on car rentals, plane tickets,
hotel rooms, and even meals. Ask about everything; you may be
pleasantly surprised.
 Find out whether your kids can stay in the room with you. A
room with two double beds usually doesn’t cost any more than one
with a queen-size bed. And many hotels won’t charge you the addi-
tional person rate if the additional person is pint-size and related to
you. Even if you have to pay extra for a rollaway bed, you’ll save
hundreds by not taking two rooms.
Part II: Planning Your Trip to France 
62

 Try expensive restaurants at lunch rather than dinner. Lunch
tabs usually are a fraction of what dinner costs at top restaurants,
and the menu often boasts many of the same specialties.
 Get out of town. In many places, big savings are just a short drive
or taxi ride away. Hotels just outside the city, across the river, or
less conveniently located are great bargains. Outlying hotels often
have free parking, with lower rates than centrally located hotels
that offer amenities you may never use. See Chapter 8 for more
about choosing and booking hotels.
 Walk. A good pair of walking shoes can save you plenty of money
in taxi and other local transportation fares. As a bonus, you get to
know your destination more intimately, as you explore it at a
slower pace.
 Skip the souvenirs. Your photographs and memories can be the
best mementos from your trip. If you’re concerned about money,
you can do without the T-shirts, key chains, salt-and-pepper 
shakers, mouse ears, and other trinkets.
Here are some other cost-cutting strategies, specifically related to travel-
ing in France, to keep in mind.
 Take the cheapest way into Paris from the airport. You can save
around 43€ ($56) by taking a train or bus in place of a cab from
Charles de Gaulle and about 20€ ($26) from Orly. Both airports are
located in Paris.
 Negotiate the room price, especially during the low season. Ask
for a discount if you’re a student or older than 60; ask for a dis-
count if you stay a certain number of days.
 Try ethnic neighborhoods in Paris or the larger cities. In Paris,
you can get terrific Chinese food in the 13e arrondissement (neigh-
borhood) between place d’Italie and porte de Choisy; and the 10e,
18e, and 20e offer North African, Turkish, Vietnamese, and Thai
cuisines. (For more information about Paris neighborhoods, check
out Chapter 11.) Couscous is on the menu at many restaurants and
usually is an inexpensive offering. Throughout the book, we list less
Chapter 5: Managing Your Money 63
Tipping tips
In restaurants, the tip already is included (service compris — the 15 percent is already
figured into the bill); however, although technically unnecessary, a small additional tip
for satisfactory service (2€/$2.60 per person for a moderately priced meal) still is appro-
priate. Don’t tip a bartender for each round of drinks — instead leave 1.50€ ($1.95) at the
end of the night. Hotel service personnel should get 1.50€ ($1.95) per luggage item or
service performed, and taxi drivers generally are tipped 10 percent of the fare.

expensive restaurants and neighborhoods where you can find
cheap ethnic meals in larger cities.
 In Paris, use the Métro. A carnet of ten Métro tickets costs 9.60€
($13), a savings of 3.40€ ($4.40) over ten tickets at 1.30€ ($1.70)
each. Better yet, if you’re in Paris from one to five consecutive
days, buy a Paris Visite pass, good for unlimited subway and bus
travel (see Chapter 11).
 If you plan to visit two or three museums a day in Paris, buy the
Paris Museum Pass. The pass costs 30€ ($39) for two days, 45€
($59) for four days, and 60€ ($78) for six days. Chapter 12 has the
details.
Most cities in France have similar museum passes. Check the indi-
vidual destination chapters in this book for details.
 Take advantage of reduced admission fees at museums. The dis-
count prices usually apply after 3 p.m. (daily) and all day Sunday.
 For discounts on fashion in Paris, try rue St-Placide in the 6th
arrondissement. Look for stylish, inexpensive clothes at chain 
boutiques — Monoprix or Prisunic are two common ones —
located across the city.
 In Paris, buy half-price theater and other performance tickets.
You can find them at one of the kiosks by the Madeleine, on the
lower level of the Châtelet–Les Halles Métro station, or at the Gare
Montparnasse.
 Avoid weekends at clubs. You also can save money by sitting at
the bar rather than at a table. Some clubs are cheaper than others,
and some are less expensive during the week.
Handling Money
You’re the best judge of how much cash you feel comfortable carrying 
or what alternative form of currency is your favorite; that isn’t going to
change much during your vacation. True, you’ll probably be moving
around more and incurring more expenses than you generally do (unless
you happen to eat our every meal when you’re at home), and you may
let your mind slip into vacation gear and not be as vigilant about your
safety as when you’re in work mode. But those factors aside, the only
type of payment that won’t be quite as available to you away from home
is your personal checkbook.
Understanding the euro
The year 2001 was the last in which local commerce in France was con-
ducted in the famous franc. After January 2002, most countries in the
European Union — Great Britain a major exception — began using the
banknotes and coins of the euro, the single monetary unit that makes it
possible to travel in Europe without continually changing currencies.
Part II: Planning Your Trip to France 
64

The euro comes in note denominations of 5, 10, 20, 50, 100, 200, and 500,
and coin denominations of 1 euro and 2 euros and 1, 2, 5, 20, and 50
cents. Coins have a common face on one side. The opposite face has a
design chosen by the issuing country.
For more information and pictures of the 21st-century currency, check
online at the official site of the European Union: www.europa.eu.int.
Converting your dollars
The figures reflected in Table 5-3 were valid at the time of this writing,
but they may not be valid by the time of your departure. Nevertheless,
the table is useful for giving you an approximate idea of what your dollar
(or pound) will likely be worth by the time you arrive in France. For
prices in this book, we’ve converted the euro at $1.30 in U.S. dollars,
rounding to the nearest dollar (or euro) for amounts of more than $10
(or euro).

Try to get a small amount of euros before you leave, perhaps 100€ or so,

Chapter 5: Managing Your Money 65

your area. If you’re unable to arrive in Paris with euros in hand, however,
you can avail yourself of ATMs at the airport.
Using ATMs and carrying cash
The easiest and best way to get cash when you’re away from home is
from an ATM (automated teller machine). The Cirrus (% 800-424-7787;
www.mastercard.com) and PLUS (% 800-843-7587; www.visa.com)
networks span the globe; look at the back of your bank card to see
which network you’re on and then call or check online for ATM locations
at your destination. Be sure you know your personal identification
number (PIN) and your daily withdrawal limit before you leave home.
You’ll also want to keep in mind that many banks impose a fee every
time your card is used at a different bank’s ATM, and that fee can be
higher for international transactions (up to $5 or more) than for domes-
tic ones (where they’re rarely more than $2). On top of these fees, the
bank from which you withdraw cash may charge its own fee. To compare
banks’ ATM fees within the United States, use www.bankrate.com. For
international withdrawal fees, ask your bank.
Money makes the world go ’round, but dealing with an unfamiliar cur-
rency can make your head spin just as fast. When it comes to getting
cash in France, you’re probably wondering whether you should bring
traveler’s checks or use ATMs, or how easy it is to pay with a credit
card. The answers are in this section.
Before you leave, check out the ATM locator feature at the Web sites of
Visa (www.visa.com) and MasterCard (www.mastercard.com), where
you can identify the locations of cash machines across France. Most of
the major banks in France — such as Crédit Lyonnais, Crédit Agricole,
Banque Nationale de Paris (BNP), Banque Populaire, Crédit Commercial
de France (CCF), and Crédit du Nord — and even some branches of the
post office have automatic cash distribution machines. But you won’t be
able to check your balance or transfer funds, so keep track of your with-
drawals while you travel. These banks are in all major cities, and most
towns included in this book have at least one major bank. But note that
some small villages do not have any major banks.
In major cities, ATMs are never far away, so you can walk around with
100€ ($130) in your pocket and have enough for eating and most activi-
ties. However, before going on a driving tour of the countryside, such as
in Brittany or the Loire Valley, which have many small towns and vil-
lages, make sure you have a good stock of cash in your wallet.
Charging ahead with credit cards
Credit cards are a safe way to carry money: They also provide a conven-
ient record of all your expenses, and they generally offer relatively good
exchange rates. You also can withdraw cash advances from your credit
cards at banks or ATMs, provided you know your PIN. If you’ve forgotten
yours or didn’t even know you had one, call the number on the back of
Part II: Planning Your Trip to France 
66

your credit card, and ask the bank to send it to you. It usually takes five
to seven business days, though some banks will provide the number
over the phone if you tell them your mother’s maiden name or some
other personal information.
Keep in mind that when you use your credit card abroad, most banks
assess a 2 percent fee above the 1 percent fee charged by Visa, Master-
Card, or American Express for currency conversion on credit charges.
But credit cards still may be the smart way to go when you factor in
things like exorbitant ATM fees and higher traveler’s check exchange
rates (and service fees).
Some credit-card companies recommend that you notify them of any
impending trip abroad so they don’t become suspicious when the card
is used numerous times in a foreign location and end up blocking your
charges. Even if you don’t call your credit-card company in advance, 
you can always call the card’s toll-free emergency number if a charge is
refused — a good reason for carrying the phone number with you. But
perhaps the most important lesson here is to carry more than one card
with you on your trip. For any number of reasons, a card may not work,
so having a backup is the smart way to go.
You can use credit cards to buy virtually anything in France, as long as it
costs a minimum of 15€ ($20). You can also get cash advances from your
Visa and MasterCard at any bank. You’ll need a PIN for withdrawing cash
with a credit card, and remember, hefty interest fees are charged from
the moment you withdraw the money.
American Express and Diners Club are not widely accepted at small
restaurants, shops, and budget hotels in France. And many credit-card
companies now tack on additional fees for foreign currency transactions
— sometimes up to 4 percent on top of the 1 percent service charge
they already take. Worse, according to Lee Dembart, a writer for the
International Herald Tribune, credit-card companies don’t expect you to
notice the charge. “Recognizing the additional fee requires that the con-
sumer know what the exchange rate was on the day the charge came
through and then do the math,” he writes, “steps most people don’t
take.” You can find the official rate for dates in the past at www.oanda.com.
Toting traveler’s checks
These days, traveler’s checks are less necessary because most cities
have 24-hour ATMs that enable you to withdraw small amounts of cash
as needed. However, keep in mind that you probably will be charged 
an ATM withdrawal fee if the bank is not your own. So if you’re with-
drawing money every day, you may be better off with traveler’s 
checks — provided that you don’t mind showing identification 
every time you want to cash one.
Chapter 5: Managing Your Money 67

You can get traveler’s checks at almost any bank. American Express
offers denominations of $20, $50, $100, $500, and (for cardholders only)
$1,000. You pay a service charge ranging from 1 percent to 4 percent.
You can also get American Express traveler’s checks over the phone by
calling % 800-221-7282; AmEx gold and platinum cardholders who use
this number are exempt from the 1 percent fee.
Visa offers traveler’s checks at several locations nationwide. The serv-
ice charge ranges between 1.5 percent and 2 percent; checks come in
denominations of $20, $50, $100, $500, and $1,000. Call % 800-732-1322
for information. AAA members can obtain Visa traveler’s checks for a
$9.95 fee at most AAA offices or by calling % 866-339-3378. MasterCard
also offers traveler’s checks. Call % 800-223-9920 for a location near you.
If you choose to carry traveler’s checks, be sure to keep a record of their
serial numbers separate from your checks in the event they are stolen or
lost. You’ll get a refund faster when you know the numbers.
You can exchange traveler’s checks for euros at the following places in
Paris: American Express, 11 rue Scribe, 9e (% 01-47-77-79-28; Métro:
Opéra, Chaussée-d’Antin, or Havre-Caumartin; RER: Auber); Barclays, 6
Rond-Point des Champs-Elysées, 8er (% 01-44-95-13-80; Métro: Franklin-
D-Roosevelt); Citibank, 125 av. Champs-Elysées, 8e (% 01-53-23-33-60;
Métro: Champs-Elysées); or Travelex, 194 rue de Rivoli, 1er (% 01-42-
60-37-61; Metro: Tuileries).
Dealing with a Lost or Stolen Wallet
Be sure to contact all of your credit-card companies the minute you 
discover your wallet has been lost or stolen and file a report at the near-
est police precinct. Your credit-card company or insurer may require a
police report number or record of the loss. Most credit-card companies
have an emergency toll-free number to call whenever your card is lost 
or stolen; they may be able to wire you a cash advance immediately or
deliver an emergency credit card in a day or two.
If you need emergency cash over the weekend, when all banks and
American Express offices are closed, you can have money wired to you
via Western Union (% 800-325-6000; www.westernunion.com).
Identity theft and fraud are potential complications of losing your 
wallet, especially if you’ve lost your driver’s license along with your cash
and credit cards. Notify major credit-reporting bureaus immediately;
placing a fraud alert on your records may protect you against liability
for criminal activity. The three major U.S. credit-reporting agencies are
Equifax (% 800-685-5000; www.equifax.com), Experian (% 888-397-
3742; www.experian.com), and TransUnion (% 800-680-7289; www.
transunion.com). Finally, if you’ve lost all forms of photo ID, call your
airline and explain the situation; they may allow you to board the plane

if you have a copy of your passport or birth certificate and a copy of the
police report you’ve filed.
Call % 08-00-90-11-79 if you lose or have your Visa card stolen. Ameri-
can Express card and traveler’s check holders can call international col-
lect (% 0800-99-00-11 for an AT&T operator; % 0800-99-00-19 for MCI;
% 336-393-1111 for money emergencies or to report lost cards). For
MasterCard, call % 08-00-90-13-87.
Replacing your bank ATM card can take weeks, usually with a fee. How-
ever, larger credit-card companies can replace a card in a day or two at
no charge. A bank card has the added disadvantage of enabling a thief to
empty out your bank account, if he or she can figure out the PIN.

P
lanning a trip abroad used to be a science so exact that only travel
agents, with their numerous contacts and extensive experience,
could get you fantastic trips at low prices. These days, the Internet —
with its online travel agents; airline, lodging, and car-rental Web sites;
and myriad information about your destination — has changed travel
planning drastically. You need to decide what kind of travel best suits
you — are you an independent traveler, or do you prefer the comfort of
a tour group where everything is planned for you? In this chapter, we
show you how to get to France simply and easily — regardless of
whether you do it yourself or have someone do it for you.
Flying to France
Flying to Paris takes about seven hours from New York, nine hours from
Chicago, 11 hours from Los Angeles, eight hours from Atlanta, eight-and-a-
half hours from Miami, and seven-and-a-half hours from Washington, D.C.
The two Paris airports — Orly and Charles de Gaulle — are almost equal
in terms of convenience to the city’s center, but taxi rides from Orly may
take a bit less time than those from de Gaulle. Orly, the older of the two,
is 13km (8 miles) south of the center, and Charles de Gaulle is 23km (14
miles) northeast. Air France’s flights from North America fly into de
Gaulle (Terminal 2C). U.S.-based airlines fly into both airports.
You also can fly from major U.S. cities to Nice on the Riviera, which takes
about an hour longer than flying to Paris and costs about the same.
Flights from Paris to Nice are very frequent. Air France flies 30 flights per
day. They take one hour and twenty minutes and can cost about $300.
Most airlines offer the cheapest fares between November 1 and March 13.
Shoulder seasons, offering slightly more expensive fares, are mid-March

to mid-June and all of October. From mid-June to September, airfare rates
to France are at their highest.

Getting the Best Deal on Your Airfare
Competition among the major U.S. airlines is unlike that of any other
industry. Every airline offers virtually the same product (basically, a
coach seat is a coach seat is a . . . ), yet prices can vary by hundreds of
dollars.
Business travelers who need the flexibility of buying their tickets at the
last minute and changing their itineraries at a moment’s notice — and
who want to get home before the weekend — pay (or at least their com-
panies pay) the premium rate, known as the full fare. But if you can book
your ticket far in advance, stay over Saturday night, and are willing to
travel midweek (Tues, Wed, or Thurs), you can qualify for the least
expensive price — usually a fraction of the full fare. On most flights, the
full fare is usually more than $1,000, but a 7- or 14-day advance-purchase
ticket may cost less than half of that amount. Planning ahead obviously
pays.
The airlines also periodically boost their sales by lowering prices on
their more popular routes. These fares have advance-purchase require-
ments and date-of-travel restrictions, but you can’t beat the prices. As
you plan your vacation, keep your eyes open for these sales, which tend
to take place during seasons of low travel volume — November to mid-
March. You almost never see sale prices during the peak summer vaca-
tion months of July and August or around Thanksgiving or Christmas,
when many people fly regardless of the fare they must pay.
Consolidators, also known as bucket shops, are great sources for inter-
national tickets, although they usually can’t beat the Internet on fares
within North America. To find one, look in Sunday newspaper travel sec-
tions. U.S. travelers can focus on the New York Times, the Los Angeles
Times, and the Miami Herald. For less-developed destinations, small
travel agents who cater to immigrant communities in large cities often
have the best deals.
Bucket shop tickets usually are nonrefundable or rigged with stiff cancel-
lation penalties, often as high as 50 percent to 75 percent of the ticket
price, and some put you on charter airlines with questionable safety
records.
Part II: Planning Your Trip to France 
72

Several reliable consolidators, however, are worldwide and available on
the Internet. STA Travel (% 800-781-4040; www.statravel.com), the
world’s leader in student travel, offers good fares for travelers of all
ages. ELTExpress (% 201-541-3826; www.flights.com) started in
Europe and has excellent fares worldwide but particularly to that conti-
nent. Flights.com also has “local” Web sites in 12 countries. FlyCheap
(% 800-FLY-CHEAP; www.lowestfare.com) is owned by package-holi-
day megalith MyTravel and so has especially good access to fares for
sunny destinations. Air Tickets Direct (% 888-858-8884 or 514-694-3447;
www.airticketsdirect.com) is based in Montréal and leverages the
weaker Canadian dollar for low fares. Cheap International Flights
Network (% 888-239-6148; www.cheapinternationalflights.net)
offers heavily discounted fares between New York and Paris.
Booking Your Flight Online
The big three online travel agencies — Expedia (www.expedia.com),
Travelocity (www.travelocity.com), and Orbitz (www.orbitz.com) —
sell most of the air tickets bought on the Internet. (Canadian travelers
can try www.expedia.ca and www.travelocity.ca, and U.K. residents
can go for expedia.co.uk and opodo.co.uk.) Each has different busi-
ness deals with the airlines and may offer different fares on the same
flights, so shopping around is wise. Expedia and Travelocity will send
you an e-mail notification when a cheap fare becomes available to your
favorite destination. Of the smaller travel agency Web sites, SideStep
(www.sidestep.com) receives good reviews from users. It’s a browser
add-on that purports to “search 140 sites at once” but in reality beats
competitors’ fares only as often as other sites do.
Great last-minute deals are available through free weekly e-mail services
provided directly by the airlines. Most of these deals are announced on
Tuesday or Wednesday and must be purchased online. Most are valid
only for travel that weekend, but some can be booked weeks or months
in advance. Sign up for weekly e-mail alerts at airline Web sites or check
megasites that compile comprehensive lists of last-minute specials, such
as Smarter Travel (smartertravel.com). For last-minute trips, www.
lastminute.com in Europe often has better deals than the major-label
sites.
The iTravelnet travel directory (www.itravelnet.com) lists bargain
travel Web sites and airlines around the world.
If you’re willing to give up some control over your flight details, use what
is called an “opaque” fare service such as Priceline (www.priceline.
com; www.priceline.co.uk for Europeans) or its smaller competitor
Hotwire (www.hotwire.com). Both offer rock-bottom prices in exchange
for travel on a “mystery airline” at a mysterious time of day, often with a
change of planes en route. The airlines are all major carriers. Hotwire
tells you flight prices before you buy; Priceline usually has better deals
Chapter 6: Getting to France 73

than Hotwire, but you have to play their “name our price” game. If you’re
new at this, the helpful folks at BiddingForTravel (www.biddingfor
travel.com) do a good job of demystifying Priceline’s prices and strate-
gies. Priceline and Hotwire are great for flights between the U.S. and
Europe. Priceline has added nonopaque service to its roster. You now
have the option to pick exact flights, times, and airlines from a list of
offers—or opt to bid on opaque fares as before.
Enticing last-minute deals are also available directly from the airlines
through a free e-mail service called E-savers. Each week, the airline
sends you a list of discounted flights, usually leaving the upcoming
Friday or Saturday and returning the following Monday or Tuesday. 
You can sign up for all the major airlines at one time by logging on to
Smarter Travel (www.smarterliving.com), or you can go to each indi-
vidual airline’s Web site. Airline sites also offer schedules, flight booking,
and information on late-breaking bargains.
Arriving by Other Means
You can take trains into Paris from any other major city in continental
Europe. France is linked to fast train connections from cities in Italy and
Germany, and many routes provide night trains. Many passengers take
an overnight train for the route from Rome to Paris, for example.
You can also arrive in France by ferry from Italy or England. The ferry
service from Italy is out of Genoa. From Dover, England, a ferry lands in
Calais, France. But the Chunnel train (see below) is so convenient for
this route, there’s little reason to take the ferry.
If you like driving long distances and have plenty of time, you can drive
into France. Be aware that the routes around the Alps can be either
scary or exhilarating, depending on your disposition.
The Eurostar train (% 0870-518-6186 in London, 01-23-36-17-575 in
Paris, and 800-EUROSTAR in the U.S.; www.eurostar.com) runs through
the Channel Tunnel (Chunnel) and connects London’s Waterloo Station
with Paris’s Gare du Nord and Brussels’s Central Station. Both trips take
about three hours (you arrive four hours later with the time change).
Because the old train-ferry-train route (through Dover and Calais) takes
all day and costs almost the same, the Eurostar option is a great deal.
Reserving a seat on the Eurostar always is a good idea. Tour groups and
England’s frequent bank holidays (three- or four-day weekends) book
the train solid, because many Londoners take short vacations to Paris.
The Eurostar leaves exactly on time, and passengers are not let on less
than 15 minutes before departure.

74

Joining an Escorted Tour
You may be one of the many people who love escorted tours. The tour
company takes care of all the details and tells you what to expect at
each leg of your journey. You know your costs upfront, and in the case of
the tame ones, you don’t get many surprises. Escorted tours can take
you to the maximum number of sights in the minimum amount of time
with the least amount of hassle.
If you decide to go with an escorted tour, we strongly recommend pur-
chasing travel insurance, especially if the tour operator asks to you pay
upfront. But don’t buy insurance from the tour operator. If the tour opera-
tor doesn’t fulfill its obligation to provide you with the vacation you paid
for, there’s no reason to think that it’ll fulfill its insurance obligations
either. Get travel insurance through an independent agency.
When choosing an escorted tour, along with finding out whether you
have to put down a deposit and when final payment is due, ask a few
simple questions before you buy.
 What is the cancellation policy? Can a tour operator cancel the
trip if it doesn’t get enough people? How late can you cancel if you
are unable to go? Do you get a refund if you cancel? Do you get a
refund if the operator cancels?
 How jampacked is the schedule? Does the tour schedule try to 
fit 25 hours into a 24-hour day, or does it give you ample time to
relax by the pool or shop? If getting up at 7 a.m. every day and not
returning to your hotel until 6 or 7 p.m. sounds like a grind, certain
escorted tours may not be for you.
 How large is the group? The smaller the group, the less time you
spend waiting for people to get on and off the bus. Tour operators
may be evasive about this, because they may not know the exact
size of the group until everybody has made reservations, but you
should be given a rough estimate.
 Is there a minimum group size? Some tours have a minimum
group size and may cancel the tour if they don’t book enough
people. If a quota exists, find out what it is and how close the tour
company is to reaching it. Again, tour operators may be evasive in
their answers, but the information may help you select a tour that’s
sure to happen.
 What exactly is included? Don’t assume anything. You may have 
to pay to get yourself to and from the airport. A box lunch may 
be included in an excursion, but drinks may be extra. Beer may be
included but not wine. How much flexibility do you have? Can you
opt out of certain activities, or does the bus leave once a day, with
no exceptions? Are all your meals planned in advance? Can you
choose your main course at dinner, or does everybody get the
same chicken cutlet?
Chapter 6: Getting to France 75

Depending on your recreational passions, we recommend one of the fol-
lowing tour companies:
 Trafalgar Tours, 29–76 Northern Blvd., Long Island City, NY 11101
(% 800-854-0103; www.trafalgartours.com), offers a 14-day 
Best of France trip starting and ending in Paris, with stops on the
Riviera and in Lourdes, Nice, Monaco, and other cities. Most meals
and twin-bed accommodations in first-class hotels are part of the
package, which is $2,199 per person for the land portion only. Its
nine-day, Treasures of France tour, also beginning and ending in
Paris, has similar meal and accommodation offerings and costs
$1,350 per person for the land portion only. Call your travel agent
for more information.
 Another good choice is Globus/Cosmos Tours, 5301 S. Federal
Circle, Littleton, CO 80123 (% 800-276-1241; www.globusand
cosmos.com). Globus offers first-class escorted coach tours of vari-
ous regions of France lasting from 7 to 15 days. Cosmos, a budget
branch of Globus, offers escorted tours of about the same length.
You must book tours through a travel agent, but you can call the
800 number for brochures.
 Tauck World Discovery, 10 Norden Place, Norwalk, CT 06855 
(% 800-788-7885; www.tauck.com), provides superior first-class,
fully escorted coach grand tours of France and one-week general
tours of specific regions. Its 13-day tour covering the Normandy
landing beaches, the Bayeux Tapestry, and Mont-St-Michel, among
other places of historic interest, costs $4,750 per person, double
occupancy (land only); a 12-day trip beginning in Nice and ending
in Paris costs $4,860 per person, double occupancy (land only).
Choosing a Package Tour
For many destinations, package tours can be a smart way to go. In many
cases, a package tour that includes airfare, hotel, and transportation to
and from the airport costs less than the hotel alone on a tour you book
yourself. That’s because packages are sold in bulk to tour operators,
who resell them to the public. It’s kind of like buying your vacation at a
buy-in-bulk store — except the tour operator is the one who buys the
1,000-count box of garbage bags and resells them ten at a time at a cost
that undercuts the local supermarket.
Package tours can vary as much as those garbage bags, too. Some offer
a better class of hotels than others; others provide the same hotels for
lower prices. Some book flights on scheduled airlines; others sell char-
ters. In some packages, your choice of accommodations and travel days
may be limited. Some let you choose between escorted vacations and
independent vacations; others enable you to add on just a few excur-
sions or escorted day trips (also at discounted prices) without booking
an entirely escorted tour.
Part II: Planning Your Trip to France 
76

To find package tours, check out the travel section of your local Sunday
newspaper or the ads in the back of national travel magazines such as
Travel & Leisure, National Geographic Traveler, and Condé Nast Traveler.
Liberty Travel (call % 888-271-1584 to find the store nearest you; www.
libertytravel.com) is one of the biggest packagers in the Northeast
and usually boasts a full-page ad in Sunday papers.
Another good source of package deals is the airlines themselves. Most
major airlines offer air/land packages, including American Airlines
Vacations (% 800-321-2121; www.aavacations.com), Delta Vacations
(% 800-221-6666; www.deltavacations.com), Continental Airlines
Vacations (% 800-301-3800; www.covacations.com), and United
Vacations (% 888-854-3899; www.unitedvacations.com). Several 
big online travel agencies — Expedia, Travelocity, Orbitz, Site59, and
Lastminute.com — also do a brisk business in packages. If you’re unsure
about the pedigree of a smaller packager, check with the Better Business
Bureau in the city where the company is based, or go online at www.
bbb.org. If a packager won’t tell you where it’s based, don’t fly with it.
Here are some package tour operators with specific French connections.
 The French Experience, 370 Lexington Ave., Room 511, New York, NY
10017 (% 800-283-7262 or 212-986-3800; www.frenchexperience.
com), offers several fly-’n’-drive programs through regions of France
(the quoted price includes airfare and a rental car). You can specify
the type and price level of hotels you want. The agency arranges
the car rental in advance, and the rest is up to you. Some staff can
seem unfriendly, but persevere for good deals.
 The two largest tour operators conducting escorted tours of France
and Europe are Globus/Cosmos Tours (% 800-276-1241; www.
globusandcosmos.com) and Trafalgar (www.trafalgartours.com).
Both have first-class tours that run about $100 a day and budget
tours for about $75 a day. The differences are mainly in hotel loca-
tion and the number of activities. There’s little difference in the
companies’ services, so choose your tour based on the itinerary
and date of departure. Brochures are available at travel agencies,
and all tours must be booked through travel agents.

T
his chapter gives you the details you need for traveling within France.
Your best bet for getting around the country is via the speedy and
efficient train system, especially the superfast TGV. If you’re pressed for
time and need to cover a large distance, then opt for a plane. But if you
have sufficient time, you can rent a car and tour the countryside.
Normandy and the Loire Valley are within a couple of hours of Paris, so
taking the train from the capital makes sense. But if you want to explore
the countryside, rent a car from a city within the region. Brittany and
Provence are three to four hours by train from Paris, so the train still
makes sense. However, if you’re going all the way south to the Riviera,
consider flying.
Traveling by Plane
The French national airline is Air France (% 800-237-2747 in the United
States, 0870-142-4343 in London; www.airfrance.com), which offers
domestic flights to every major city in France (though to get to some
cities, you have to fly through Paris or Lyon). Although you may con-
sider flying from Paris to Nice, you need to know that flights within
France occasionally are delayed or canceled because of strikes. You can
take 1 of 30 flights a day from Paris to the Aéroport Nice–Côte d’Azur,
which is an easy shuttle from the center of Nice. The flights take one
hour and twenty minutes, and the average fare is $300 or more one way
(subject to change). The train to Nice takes six hours and forty minutes.

Taking the Train
Train travel in France is a relative bargain, and the trains are known for
being on time. You can go almost anywhere in the country by train —
service covers more than 38,000km (about 24,000 miles) of track and
about 3,000 stations. The superfast TGVs (pronounced tay-jay-vay, mean-
ing Trains à Grand Vitesse), servicing 50 French cities, continually are
being improved.
Most trains are clean and comfortable. On all TGVs and some other
trains, you have a choice of first- and second-class seating. First class is
cleaner and quieter, with slightly larger chairs, and is occupied mainly
by businesspeople. Trains traveling long distances have couchettes
(sleepers), and most contain snack bars. (Always bring bottled water
and a snack on a French train. You never know when a strike is going to
mean a closed snack bar.)
Make sure that you get on the right car, not just the right train. Check
your ticket for the voit (car) and the place (seat). Individual train cars
may split from the rest of the train down the line and join a different
train headed to a different destination. Making sure that you’re on the
right car is especially important when taking a night train (if you have a
reserved spot, you needn’t worry). Each car has its own destination
placard, which may also list major stops en route. Always check with 
the conductor.
If you’re at a rail station, and someone at the ticket window tells you that
a train you want to take is booked, always ask the conductor. The ticket
Chapter 7: Getting Around France 79

window computers include bookings for possible no-shows, so a fully
reserved train can actually have many seats available.
If you want to bypass Paris entirely or visit the city at the end of your
trip, consider taking a train directly from Charles de Gaulle Airport to
your destination. You’ll find direct trains from the airport to Avignon,
Dijon, Marseille, Nantes, and St-Pierre des Corps (just outside Tours),
among other cities.
Getting more information
To obtain more information and to buy rail passes before you leave,
check out www.raileurope.com, from which you can access rail travel
information for travelers from the United States, Canada, and the United
Kingdom. Or call one of the following numbers for more information.
 In the United States: Contact Rail Europe (% 877-257-2887; www.
raileurope.com).
 In Canada: Contact Rail Europe (% 800-361-RAIL [7245]).
 In the United Kingdom: Contact National Rail Enquiries
(% 08457-48-49-50; www.nationalrail.co.uk).
To get train information or to make reservations after you get to Paris,
call SNCF (Societé Nationale des Chemins de Fer, the French National
Railroad) at % 08-36-35-35-39 for English-speaking operators and % 08-
36-35-35-35 for French-speaking operators (some of whom may speak a
little English). You’re charged 0.30€ (40¢) per minute to use this service.
You can also go to any local travel agency, of course, and book tickets. 
A simpler way to reserve tickets is to take advantage of the billetterie
(ticket machines) in every train station. If you know your PIN, you can
use American Express, MasterCard, or Visa to purchase your ticket. You
can also find out schedule information on the Web at www.sncf.com.
If you plan on much rail travel, obtain the latest copy of the Thomas
Cook European Timetable of Railroads. This comprehensive 500-plus-
page book is published monthly and documents all Europe’s mainline
passenger rail services with detail and accuracy. You can purchase the
book online at www.thomascooktimetables.com.
Buying French rail passes
Working cooperatively with SNCF, Air Inter Europe, and Avis, Rail Europe
offers two flexible cost-saving rail passes that can reduce travel costs
considerably.
 The France Railpass provides unlimited rail transport throughout
France for three days within one month, costing $238 in first class
and $202 in second class. You can purchase up to seven or more
days for an extra $36 per person per day. Children ages 4 to 11
travel for half price.
Part II: Planning Your Trip to France 
80

 The France Rail ’n Drive Pass, available only for North American
travelers, combines good values from both rail travel and Avis car
rentals and is best used by arriving at a major rail depot and then
renting a car to explore the countryside. The best part is that you
don’t pay a surcharge for dropping off the vehicle at another loca-
tion, so you don’t have to retrace your steps. The offer includes the
France Railpass, along with unlimited mileage on a car rental. The
costs are lowest when two or more adults travel together. You can
use it during two nonconsecutive days in one month, and it includes
three days of travel on the train and two days’ use of a rental car. 
If rental of the least expensive car is combined with first-class rail
travel, the price is $265 per person. Cars can be upgraded for a 
supplemental fee. The prices above apply to two people traveling
together. Up to three additional rail days can be purchased for $30
per day, and unlimited additional car days can be purchased from
$45 per day.
Other passes for France from Rail Europe include
 The France Saverpass, offering a discount for two or more people
traveling together ($204 first class, $173 second class).
 The France Seniorpass, giving a discount to people older than 60
traveling in first class. Prices start at $218 for first-class seating.
 The France Youthpass, providing a discount for youth ($177 first
class, $149 second class).
Even if you’re the holder of a rail pass, you’ll need to make a reservation
for a specific seat within TGVs and some other trains. When you make
the reservation, you need to specify that you have a rail pass, but remem-
ber that only a limited number of seats are available for travelers with
passes. If first class is booked, a seat in second class probably will be
available. Be aware that because TGVs move at great speed, every pas-
senger must be associated with a seat (that is, no standing in the aisles
for long distances is allowed) and as such, advance reservations are
required. The fee for this seat assignment is 8.50€ ($11), and can be paid
in U.S. dollars if you pre-reserve your seat through the North American
Rail Europe facilities (% 800-438-7245) or in euros if you pre-reserve
your seat at any SNCF railway station within France.
Getting Around by Bus
The bus system in France, which is separated into about a hundred 
different small companies, can take you to most out-of-the-way places
not reachable by train. The hill towns of the Riviera are particularly 
well serviced by bus. You can pick up local schedules at tourist offices.
Remember that bus service is severely reduced on Sundays. For many
routes in France, you pay the driver for the trip. Throughout the book,
we provide numbers for bus companies that service individual towns.
Chapter 7: Getting Around France 81

As in most countries, French bus stations tend to be a little less safe
than train stations, and you need to keep a close watch on your luggage.
Driving Around France
Many of France’s most luxurious accommodations lie off the beaten
track, so you need a rental car (or a taxi) to get there. And nothing beats
the flexibility of a rental car for exploring certain regions of France, par-
ticularly Brittany and the Loire Valley. Driving times vary depending on
traffic near the major cities and how fast you want to go. Paris to Rouen
is about two-and-a-half hours, Paris to Nantes is three-and-a-half hours,
and Paris to Marseille can be seven-and-a-half hours. (The new fast TGV
gets you to Marseille in only three-and-a-half hours.)
Understanding the rules of renting a car
Renting a car in France is easy. You need to present a passport, a valid
driver’s license, and a valid credit card. You also need to meet the mini-
mum age requirements of the company (for Hertz, 21; for Avis, 23; for
Budget, 25 — more expensive cars at these companies require at least
age 25). Being asked for an International Driver’s Permit is highly unusual
in France, but to be safe, you can get one at your nearest AAA office for
$10. Here are a few other things to keep in mind before renting your car.
 Save the most money by reserving the car before you leave home.
Remember, though, that all car-rental bills in France are subject to
a 19.6 percent government tax.
 Comparison shop using the Internet. As with other aspects of plan-
ning your trip, using the Internet can make comparison shopping
for a car rental much easier. You can check rates at most of the
major agencies’ Web sites. Additionally, all major travel sites —
Travelocity (www.travelocity.com), Expedia (www.expedia.com),
Orbitz (www.orbitz.com), and Smarter Travel (www.smarter
living.com), for example — have search engines that can dig up
discounted car-rental rates. Just enter the car size you want, the
pickup and return dates and location, and the server returns a
price. You can even make the reservation through any of these
sites.
 Automatic transmissions are a luxury in Europe, so if you want 
a car with one, you’ll have to pay about double the cost of the
rental car.
In addition to the standard rental prices, other optional charges apply 
to most car rentals (and some not-so-optional charges, such as taxes).
The Collision Damage Waiver (CDW), which shifts liability for collision
damage from the person renting the car to the car rental company, is
covered by many credit-card companies. Check with your credit-card
company before you go so you can avoid paying this hefty fee — as
much as $20 a day, maybe even more.

Car rental companies also offer additional liability insurance (if you harm
others in an accident), personal accident insurance (if you harm yourself
or your passengers), and personal effects insurance (if your luggage is
stolen from your car). Your insurance policy on your car at home prob-
ably covers most of these unlikely occurrences. However, if your own
insurance doesn’t cover you for rentals, or if you don’t have auto insur-
ance, definitely consider the additional coverage (ask your car rental
agent for more information). Unless you’re toting around the Hope dia-
mond, and you don’t want to leave something like that in your car trunk,
you probably can skip the personal effects insurance, but driving around
without liability or personal accident coverage never is a good idea.
Even if you’re a good driver, other people may not be, and liability
claims can be complicated.
Here are the contact numbers for the big car-rental companies.
 Avis (% 800-331-1212 in the United States and Canada; www.avis.
com) has offices at both Paris airports and an inner-city headquar-
ters at 5 rue Bixio, 7e (% 01-44-18-10-50; Métro: Ecole-Militaire),
near the Tour Eiffel. Avis also operates offices in most major French
towns.
 Budget (% 800-472-3325 in the United States and Canada; www.
budget.com) maintains about 6 locations in Paris, with a branch at
86 av. Des Ternes (% 01-58-05-36-00; Métro: Pte Mailot). Budget
also has offices in Tours, Orléans, Rouen, Nantes, Avignon, Aix,
Nice, Marseille, and Cannes, among other cities.
 Hertz (% 800-654-3131 in the United States and Canada; www.
hertz.com) maintains about ten locations in Paris, including
offices at the city’s airports. The most central office is 99 rue de
Rivoli, 1er (% 01-45-74-97-39; Métro: Concorde). Hertz also has
offices in most major French towns. If you’re in France and want 
to rent a car for anywhere in France outside of Paris, call % 01-39-
38-30-00.
 National, which is called National Citer in France (% 800-CAR-
RENT in the United States and Canada; www.nationalcar.com), is
represented in Paris by Europcar, whose largest office is at 165 bis
rue de Vaugirard (% 01-44-38-61-81; Métro: St-Sulpre). It has offices
at both Paris airports and at about a dozen other locations, includ-
ing Tours, Nantes, Avignon, Aix-en-Provence, Nice, and Cannes.
Knowing the rules of the road
Using a car, of course, brings the greatest freedom of all, but you have to
know French rules of the road. Here are some things to keep in mind as
you traverse the cities and countryside.
Chapter 7: Getting Around France 83

 Seat belts: Everyone in the car — in both the front and back 
seats — must wear seat belts.
 Kids in the car: Children ages 11 and younger must ride in the back
seat.
 Yield: Drivers are supposed to yield to the car on their right,
except where signs indicate otherwise, such as at traffic circles.
 Speed limits: If you violate the speed limits, expect a big fine. Those
limits are about 130kmph (80 mph) on expressways, about 100kmph
(60 mph) on major national highways, and 90kmph (56 mph) on
small country roads. In towns, don’t exceed 60kmph (37 mph).
 Defensive driving: The French are known as the most dangerous
drivers in Europe — with even worse reputations than the Italians
or Portuguese — because of the speeds at which they drive. As a
result, the French have one of the highest per capita death rates by
auto in Europe. Expect to be tailgated.
 Gas: Known as essence, gasoline in France is very expensive for
drivers used to U.S. prices. At press time, the most widely used
type of unleaded gasoline is super sans plomb. Depending on the
size of the tank of your European car, filling it up usually costs
between 40€ ($63) and 60€ ($95).
Sometimes you can drive for miles in rural France without coming
upon a gas station, so try not to let your tank get dangerously low.

Accommodations
In This Chapter
 Knowing what’s available
 Surfing the Web for hotel deals
 Landing a room when you arrive without a reservation
A
fter you decide where in France you’re heading, you need to get
down to the nitty-gritty of choosing the type of lodging you want
and finding a suitable room at the right price. France tends to charge
reasonable hotel rates; many of its hotels offer additional special deals,
and this chapter tells you how to find them. Use the money you save on
your room for dinners in quality restaurants, spectacular entertainment,
or gifts for family and friends (or yourself).
Getting to Know Your Options
Hotels in France have their own set of quirks that you may not be famil-
iar with if you’re used to hotels in the United States. Things you may
take for granted in U.S. hotels — such as closets, shower curtains, wash-
cloths, and window screens — may not always be there for you in France.
Many medium-priced hotels don’t have air-conditioning, and their bath-
rooms usually are quite small. Likewise, many charming French hotels
are in ancient buildings and don’t have elevators. Sometimes, the stair-
ways are steep, narrow, winding stone passageways. Forewarned is fore-
armed. Pack light and consider the inconvenience part of the old-world
charm.
Because hotel offerings vary greatly, if some particular amenity is very
important to you — air-conditioning, elevator, whatever — ask about it
when you’re reserving your room.

Hotels
Even the most basic hotel rooms in France have telephones and televi-
sions. But only the higher-priced hotels offer satellite televisions that
receive English-language stations.
As a rule, basic and medium-priced French hotels offer fewer amenities
than their American counterparts, but they’re also far cheaper than
medium-priced hotels in similar resort areas. For example, a medium-
priced hotel room on the Riviera will cost around 130€ ($169) per night
in season; a medium-priced hotel room on the island of Nantucket in
Massachusetts in season will cost around $235. On the high end of the
scale, you’d be hard-pressed to find a hotel in the United States that has
as much elegance and glamour as some of France’s top hotels, mainly
because the United States doesn’t have 300-year-old palaces and other
such grand historic locales.
Fortunately, most towns in France offer a wide range of hotel choices,
from unassuming hostelries with small, simple rooms to world-famous
palaces with superdeluxe suites. Many travelers want a medium-priced
hotel, perhaps with some historic charm, that’s in a good location,
within walking distance of sights, shopping, and restaurants. So we
include those types of places throughout the book, along with inexpen-
sive choices for people who want to save a few euros and expensive
places for travelers looking to splurge.
Chain hotels often are concrete block structures on the outskirts of
cities. Their bargain rates for standard amenities are popular with busi-
ness travelers. The big chains are Mercure (% 800-MERCURE or 800-
221-4542 in the United States and Canada; www.mercure.com), which
has medium-priced rooms, and Formule 1 (% 01-69-36-75-29 in France;
www.hotelformule1.com), which has inexpensive rooms.
French hotels are government-rated by stars, which always are indicated
on the exterior of the building on a plaque and in all brochures for the
hotel. The ratings from highest to lowest are four-star deluxe (the best),
four-star (excellent), three-star (very nice), two-star (good quality), and
one-star (budget). No-star hotels, which don’t have the minimum ameni-
ties to receive one star, also are available, but you probably want to
avoid them, because they often have shared bathrooms in the hallways.
Two-star and three-star hotels are the midrange options, and although
the quality and comfort of these accommodations can range quite a bit,
they always have a clean room with a simple bathroom (sink, toilet,
shower and/or tub, and a bar of soap).
All the hotel reviews in this book list the high-season rack rates (the rate
the hotel quotes you) and use a specific number of dollar signs to indi-
cate the general price range. Table 8-1 presents the dollar-sign break-
down that we use in this book.

These top-rated accommodations come with 
($391– and up)

Keep in mind that hotel prices can change quite a bit. For example, what
was $$$ at press time may be $$$$ when you arrive in France, because
the hotel may have completed a renovation and raised its prices. Or the
exchange rate, or the value of the euro relative to the dollar, can change
in the future.
Relais & Châteaux and Logis de France
Relais & Châteaux is a marketing organization for some of the most
deluxe privately owned hotels in France and around the world — France
has about 150 of them. To qualify for the organization, hotels must
adhere to strict hospitality standards, so you’re pretty much guaranteed
a grand room at a Relais & Châteaux hotel, usually occupying a historic
building such as a former castle, abbey, or mansion. But these hotels are
always very pricey, and some insist on half or full board, meaning you
have to take one or two meals at the hotel, which also is very expensive
but probably very tasty, considering that the restaurants attached to
these hotels usually are the best in town.
An illustrated catalog of these establishments can be obtained online for
$20. These booklets are available free at all Relais & Châteaux establish-
ments and online at www.relaischateaux.com. For information or to
Chapter 8: Booking Your Accommodations 87

book a Relais & Châteaux hotel, you can call the hotel directly or the
organization headquarters at % 800-735-2478 (Fax: 602-735-8359).
Establishments with the Logis de France designation are usually medium-
priced, family-owned hotels that offer good value and standard ameni-
ties. You purchase a booklet listing these hotels by contacting the
French Government Tourist Office, 444 Madison Ave., New York, NY
10022 (% 212-838-7800); the booklet costs $7.80. Or you can contact the
Fédération Nationale des Logis de France, 83 av. d’Italie, 75013 Paris
(% 01-45-84-83-84; www.logis-de-france.fr).
Bed-and-breakfasts
The term for a bed-and-breakfast in France is gîte or chambre d’hôte, and
these accommodations usually are on a farm or in a village home and
very inexpensive. Many of them offer a meal of the day, such as lunch or
dinner.
At least 6,000 of these accommodations are listed with La Maison de
Gîtes de France et du Tourisme Vert, 59 rue St-Lazare, 75439 Paris 
(% 01-49-70-75-75; www.gites-de-france.fr). Sometimes these
accommodations are quite nice; you can be in a privately owned castle
in the countryside, and madame may let you prepare a meal in her
kitchen. In the United States, a good source is The French Experience,
370 Lexington Ave., Room 511, New York, NY 10017 (% 800-283-7262 or
212-986-3800; Fax: 646-349-3276; www.frenchexperience.com), which
also rents furnished houses for as short a period as one week.
Condos, villas, houses, and apartments
For longer-term stays in condos or apartments where you don’t mind
cooking your own meals and cleaning the house, you can obtain a list of
real estate agencies from the French Government Tourist Office, 444
Madison Ave., New York, NY 10022 (% 212-838-7800). One of the best
French real estate groups is the Fédération Nationale des Agents
Immobiliers, 106 rue du L’Université, 75007 Paris (% 01-47-05-44-36;
www.fnaim.fr).
If you want to rent an apartment in Paris, the Barclay International
Group, 6800 Jericho Turnpike, Syosset, NY 11791 (% 800-845-6636 or
516-364-0064; Fax: 516-364-4468; www.barclayweb.com), can give you
access to about 3,000 apartments and villas scattered throughout Paris
(plus 39 other cities in France), ranging from modest modern units to
the most stylish. Units rent for one night to six months and start at
around $85 per night, double occupancy. You pay through Barclay in
advance of your trip for these units.
At Home Abroad, 405 E. 56th St., Suite 6H, New York, NY 10022-2466 
(% 212-421-9165; Fax: 212-533-0095; www.athomeabroadinc.com), spe-
cializes in villas on the Riviera and in the Provençal hill towns. Rentals
Part II: Planning Your Trip to France 
88

are usually for two weeks. For no fee, At Home Abroad sends you photo-
graphs of the properties and a newsletter.
Renting a private residence may help you save money on your food
costs. Breakfast at a medium-priced hotel normally runs 12€ ($16) for a
continental breakfast (hot beverage, bread, croissant). Instead, make use
of whatever kitchen facilities your rental may have to prepare the occa-
sional meal. Or do what the locals do and search the neighborhood for a
nearby cafe.
Finding the Best Room at the Best Rate
The rack rate is the maximum rate that a hotel charges for a room. It’s
the rate you get if you walk in off the street and ask for a room for the
night. You sometimes see these rates printed on the fire/emergency exit
diagrams posted on the back of the door to your room.
Hotels are happy to charge you the rack rate, but you almost always can
do better. Perhaps the best way to avoid paying the rack rate is surpris-
ingly simple: Just ask for a cheaper or discounted rate. You may be
pleasantly surprised.
Searching for the best rates
In all but the smallest accommodations, the rate you pay for a room
depends on many factors — chief among them is how you make your
reservation. A travel agent may be able to negotiate a better price with
certain hotels than you can get by yourself. (That’s because the hotel
often gives the agent a discount in exchange for steering his or her busi-
ness toward that hotel.)
Reserving a room through the hotel’s toll-free number may also result in
a lower rate than calling the hotel directly. On the other hand, the cen-
tral reservations number may not know about discount rates at specific
locations. For example, local franchises may offer a special group rate
for a wedding or family reunion, but they may neglect to tell the central
booking line. Your best bet is to call both the local number and the toll-
free number and see which one gives you a better deal.
Room rates (even rack rates) change with the season as occupancy
rates rise and fall. But even within a given season, room prices are sub-
ject to change without notice, so the rates quoted in this book may be
different from the actual rate you receive when you make your reserva-
tion. Be sure to mention membership in any travel associations, seniors
organizations, frequent flyer programs, any other corporate rewards
programs you can think of — or your Uncle Joe’s Elks lodge in which
you’re an honorary inductee, for that matter — when you call to book.
You never know when the affiliation may be worth a few dollars off your
room rate.
Chapter 8: Booking Your Accommodations 89

Throughout France, as in many tourist centers worldwide, hotels rou-
tinely overbook, so booking by credit card doesn’t automatically hold
your room if you arrive later than expected or after 6 p.m. The hotel
clerk always asks when you expect to arrive, and the hotel usually holds
the room until that time. Always pad your expected arrival by a few hours
to be safe. But all bets are off after 7 p.m., and the hotel is likely to give
away your room to someone off the street unless you call and specifi-
cally ask them to hold it. A credit-card number does, however, hold a
room better than just your word over the telephone that you will show
up. If you’ve made a reservation very far in advance, confirm within 24
hours of your expected arrival. If you’re experiencing a major delay, alert
the hotel as soon as you can.
Keeping your lodging costs down
Bartering for a cheaper room isn’t the norm in France’s budget hotels.
Most establishments are small and privately owned; they post their
rates in the reception area and may not be willing to negotiate. To be
fair, they may not be able to afford to let rooms go for less.
Here’s some advice to keep in mind when trying to save money on a
room.
 Don’t forget that your travel agent may be able to negotiate a better
price at top hotels than you can get by yourself.
 Always ask whether the hotel offers any weekend specials, which
typically require you to stay two nights (either Fri and Sat or Sat
and Sun). In Paris, you can find this kind of deal from September to
March at almost all price levels.
 Forfaits (fohr-feh) are discounts that require you to stay a certain
number of nights — perhaps a minimum of three or five nights.
Sometimes something else is thrown in (such as a bottle of cham-
pagne) to sweeten the deal. If you’re going to be in a city for more
than three days, always ask about a forfait and then pick the hotel
with the best deal.
 Visit Paris during the summer low season. That’s no typo. Room
rates in Paris tend to be lower in July and August, which, though
big tourist months, are considered low season by Paris hoteliers.
November and December also are low season, while October is
heavy with conventioneers, making it difficult to find a room.
 Visit regions outside of Paris during the shoulder seasons of spring
and fall when prices can be considerably lower, particularly along
the Riviera.
 In hotels outside of Paris, the best room in a medium-priced hotel
usually is much better than the worst room at a high-priced hotel,
and it’s usually cheaper. Ask for the price of the best room, the
room with the best views, or the quietest room.
Part II: Planning Your Trip to France 
90

 Don’t forget about package deals (see Chapter 6) that include air-
fare, hotel, and transportation to and from the airport.
 Look on the Internet for deals (see the following section, “Surfing
the Web for hotel deals”).
 If you’re a risk taker, stop in at the Office de Tourisme de Paris, 18
rue de Dunkerque, 10e (% 08-92-68-30-00), during July and August
or November and December — slow seasons for Paris hotels. At
these times, hotels with unsold rooms often sell to the tourist office
at reduced rates, and you can stay in a three-star hotel at a two-star
price. During the summer slow season, however, you have to wait
in a long line and are not guaranteed a room.
Surfing the Web for hotel deals
Shopping online for hotels generally is done one of two ways: by booking
through the hotel’s own Web site or through an independent booking
agency (or a fare-service agency such as Priceline). These Internet hotel
agencies have multiplied in mind-boggling numbers of late, competing
for the business of millions of consumers surfing for accommodations
around the world. This competitiveness can be a boon to consumers
who have the patience and time to shop and compare the online sites
for good deals — but shop they must, for prices can vary considerably
from one site to the next. And keep in mind that hotels at the top of a
site’s listing may be there for no other reason than that they paid money
to get the placement.
Of the big three sites, Expedia offers a long list of special deals and vir-
tual tours or photos of available rooms so you can see what you’re
paying for (a feature that helps counter the claims that the best rooms
are often held back from bargain-booking Web sites). Travelocity posts
unvarnished customer reviews and ranks its properties according to the
AAA rating system. Orbitz features a handy tool that enables you to
search for specific amenities in which you may be interested. Also reli-
able are Hotels.com and Quikbook.com. An excellent free program,
TravelAxe (www.travelaxe.net), can help you search multiple hotel
sites all at once — even ones you may never have heard of — and con-
veniently lists the total price of the room, including taxes and service
charges. Another booking site, Travelweb (www.travelweb.com), is
partly owned by the hotels it represents (including the Hilton, Hyatt, and
Starwood chains) and therefore is plugged directly into the hotels’ reser-
vations systems — unlike independent online agencies that have to fax
or e-mail reservation requests to the hotel (a good portion of which get
misplaced in the shuffle). More than once, travelers have arrived at their
hotels only to be told that they have no reservations. To be fair, many 
of the major sites are undergoing improvements in service and ease of
use — none of which can be bad news for consumers. Expedia, for exam-
ple, soon will be able to plug directly into the reservations systems of
many hotel chains. In the meantime, getting a confirmation number and
making a printout of any online booking transactions are good ideas.
Chapter 8: Booking Your Accommodations 91

In the opaque Web site category, Priceline and Hotwire are even better
for hotels than for airfares. With both, you’re allowed to pick the neigh-
borhood and quality level of your hotel before offering up your money.
Priceline’s hotel product covers Europe, but it’s much better at getting
five-star lodging for three-star prices than at finding anything at the
bottom of the scale. On the downside, many hotels stick Priceline guests
in their least desirable rooms. Be sure to go to the BiddingForTravel Web
site (www.biddingfortravel.com) before bidding on a hotel room on
Priceline; it features a fairly up-to-date list of hotels that Priceline uses 
in major cities. For both Priceline and Hotwire, you pay upfront, and the
fee is nonrefundable. Note: Some hotels do not provide loyalty program
credits or points or other frequent-stay amenities when you book a room
through opaque online services.
Reserving the best room
After making your reservation, asking one or two more pointed ques-
tions can go a long way toward ensuring that you get the best room in
the house. Always ask for a corner room. They’re usually larger, quieter,
and have more windows and light than standard rooms, and they don’t
always cost more. Likewise, ask whether the hotel is renovating; if it is,
request a room away from the renovation work. Inquire, too, about the
location of the restaurants, bars, and discos in the hotel — all sources 
of annoying noise. And if you aren’t happy with your room when you
arrive, talk to the front desk. If the hotel has another room, it should be
happy to accommodate you, within reason.

W
hether it’s the food, the history, the stunning art and architec-
ture, or that inimitable French joie de vivre (joy of living), France
ranks among the most visited of all tourist destinations, and more
resources than ever make it available — and enjoyable — to all. This
chapter covers the how-to guides, tour companies for travelers with 
disabilities, and English-speaking baby sitters that are only some of 
the ways travelers with special needs are making the most of France
these days.
Traveling with the Brood: Advice for Families
France has a very family-oriented culture, so feel free to bring your kids
along. They’ll undoubtedly be wide-eyed at the cultural differences and
interested in the unusual historic sights. However, you may want to
reconsider taking younger children to the fanciest hotels and restau-
rants unless your kids are very well behaved. Some of these establish-
ments have a somewhat inhospitable reaction to screaming tots.
Throughout the book, the Kid Friendly icon lets you know which hotels
and restaurants are best for kids. Your best indication for kid-friendly
restaurants is whether they have enfant (child) menus posted outside.
Many historic sights and museums are free or half-price for kids.
Paris, the City of Light, is full of attractions worthy of your children’s
attention, and the kids can only benefit from the experience. Parks and
playgrounds and kid-specific sights and museums abound, along with

interesting boat rides and bike tours. Paris also is safer than most big
cities.
Teenagers are fascinated by the beach scene on the Riviera or by any
other beach scene in France. In addition, older children may enjoy some
of the more spectacular attractions such as the Palais des Papes in
Avignon and the Château de Chambord in the Loire Valley. Teens also
seem to love France’s cafe society, where you can find a central spot to
sit and people-watch for hours on end.
Getting kids ready for France
If you plan your trip well in advance, your kids may get a kick out of
learning the language from one of the many French-language books and
videotapes on the market. Stories such as Ludwig Bemelmans’s Madeline
series, Albert Lamorisse’s The Red Balloon, and Kay Thompson’s Eloise
in Paris are great for kids younger than 8. You can order them from the
Librairie de France, 610 Fifth Ave., New York, NY 10020 (% 212-581-
8810). Older teens may appreciate Ernest Hemingway’s A Moveable
Feast, Victor Hugo’s Les Misérables, Rose Tremain’s The Way I Found Her,
and Peter Mayle’s books about Provence.
Preview museums and other sights that you want to visit by checking
out their Web sites (start with the sidebar “Going online to introduce
your kids to France” later in this chapter). Children younger than 18 are
admitted free to France’s national museums, but not necessarily to
Paris’s city museums. (No consistent rule exists to help you distinguish
between a national and a city museum — unless “Nationale” is part of
the museum’s name — though national museums tend to close on Tues
and Paris city museums tend to close on Mon.) If you stay long enough,
consider a day trip to Disneyland Paris, easily accessible by public
transportation (see Chapter 13 for more about Disneyland Paris).
If your children are younger than 12 and you’re traveling by rail through
France, check out the Carte Enfant Plus (www.enfantplus-sncf.com).
Available at any SNCF (French National Railroads) station, it offers a 50
percent discount for the child and up to four adult travel companions.
The card costs 65€ ($85) and is good for a month, but only a limited
number of seats are available, and discounts aren’t offered for periods 
of peak travel or during holidays. Reserve in advance.
Although the French love kids and welcome them just about every-
where, they do expect them to be well mannered. Proper behavior is
expected, especially in restaurants and museums. French children are
taught at an early age to behave appropriately in these settings, and
French adults expect the same from your kids.
Bringing along baby
You can arrange ahead of time for such necessities as a crib, bottle
warmer, and, if you’re driving, a car seat (small children are prohibited
Part II: Planning Your Trip to France 
94

from riding in the front seat). Find out whether the place where you’re
staying stocks baby food; if not, take some with you for your first day
and then plan to buy some. Plenty of choices are available. Transpor-
tation in Paris isn’t as stroller-friendly as it is in the United States. Be
prepared to lift your child out of the stroller to board buses and climb
up and down stairs and/or walk long distances in some Métro stations.
The upside to being in Paris is that you and your child can stroll in some
of the world’s prettiest parks and gardens.

Making Age Work for You: Advice for Seniors
While in France, always carry a form of ID that shows your date of birth,
mention that you’re a senior when you first make your travel reserva-
tions, and don’t be shy about asking for senior discounts. People older
than 60 qualify for reduced admission to theaters, museums, and other
attractions and for other travel bargains, such as the 53€ ($69) Carte
Senior, which entitles holders to an unlimited number of train rides and
reductions of 25 percent to 50 percent on train trips (except during holi-
days and periods of peak travel). The Carte Senior also offers some dis-
counts on entrance to museums and historic sites. It’s valid for one year,
and you can buy one at any SNCF station anywhere in France. Be pre-
pared to show an ID or a passport as proof of age when you buy 
the card.

Accessing France: Advice for 
Travelers with Disabilities
Alas, features that make French towns so beautiful — uneven cobble-
stone streets, quaint buildings with high doorsills from the Middle Ages,
and sidewalks narrower than a wagon in some areas — also make using
a walker or a wheelchair a nightmare. According to French law, newer
hotels with three stars or more are required to have at least one wheel-
chair-accessible guest room. (See Chapter 8 for more about the French
government’s hotel ratings.) However, most of the country’s budget
hotels, exempt from the law, occupy older buildings with winding stair-
cases and/or elevators smaller than phone booths and are generally not
good choices for travelers with disabilities. On the brighter side, many
hotels have at least one ground-floor room, which may suffice. In addi-
tion, the tourist office in the town you’re visiting will be able to give you
information about hotels with facilities for people with disabilities.
In Paris, the public transportation system isn’t the most accessible to
folks with mobility problems. Few Métro stations have elevators, and
most feature long tunnels, some with wheelchair-unfriendly moving side-
walks and staircases. Escalators often lead to a flight of stairs, and many
times when you climb up a flight of stairs, you’re faced with another set
of stairs leading down. Wheelchair lifts currently are not standard equip-
ment on city buses; nor do buses “kneel” closer to the curb to make the
first step lower.
But don’t let these inconveniences change your mind about visiting
France.
French resources for travelers with disabilities
Before your trip, contact the French Government Tourist Office, 444
Madison Ave., New York, NY 10022 (% 212-838-7800) for the publication
(with an English glossary) Touristes Quand Même. It provides an overview
of facilities for persons with disabilities in the French transportation
system and at monuments and museums in Paris and the provinces. You
can also obtain a list of hotels in France that meet the needs of travelers
with disabilities by writing to L’Association des Paralysés de France, 17
bd. Auguste-Blanqui, 75013 Paris (% 01-40-78-66-00).
You can contact the Groupement pour l’Insertion des Personnes
Handicapées Physiques (Help for the Physically Handicapped), Paris
Office, 10 Georges rue de la Port Riche, 75014 Paris (% 01-43-95-66-36),
and Les Compagnons du Voyage of the RATP (% 08-92-68-77-14; www.
ratp.fr) for help in planning itineraries using public transportation.
In Paris, the modern line 14 of the Métro is wheelchair accessible, as are
the stations Nanterre-Université, Vincennes, Noisiel, St-Maur–Créteil, Torcy,
Auber, Cité-Universitaire, St-Germain-en-Laye, Charles-de-Gaulle–Etoile,
Nanterre-Ville, and several others. Bus no. 91, which links the Bastille
Chapter 9: Catering to Special Travel Needs or Interests 97

with Montparnasse, is wheelchair accessible, and so are new buses on
order. Some high-speed and intercity trains are equipped for wheelchair
access, and a special space is available in first class (at the price of a
second-class ticket) for wheelchairs, though you must reserve well in
advance.
Other resources for travelers with disabilities
A good English-language guide for travelers with disabilities is Access in
France, which you can obtain by calling % 020-7250-3222, visiting www.
radar.org.uk, or writing to RADAR, Unit 12, City Forum, 250 City Road,
London EC1V 8AF. It costs approximately $20.
More options and resources for travelers with disabilities are available
than ever before. Check out A World of Options, a 658-page book of
resources for travelers with disabilities, which covers everything from
biking trips to scuba outfitters around the world. The book costs $18
online and can be ordered from Mobility International USA, 132 E.
Broadway, Suite 343, Eugene, OR 97440 (% 541-343-1284, voice and
TYY; www.miusa.org).
Many travel agencies feature customized tours and itineraries for 
travelers with disabilities. Flying Wheels Travel (% 507-451-5005;
www.flyingwheelstravel.com) offers escorted tours and cruises that
emphasize sports and private tours in minivans with lifts. Access-Able
Travel Source (% 303-232-2979; www.access-able.com) provides
extensive access information and advice for traveling around the world
with disabilities.
Organizations that offer assistance to travelers with disabilities include
the MossRehab (% 800-CALL-MOSS; www.mossresourcenet.org),
which provides a library of accessible-travel resources online; SATH
(Society for Accessible Travel and Hospitality; % 212-447-7284; www.

Following the Rainbow: Advice 
for Gay and Lesbian Travelers
France is one of the world’s most tolerant countries toward gays and les-
bians, with no laws discriminating against them. In fact, many French
cities — including Paris, Nice, and St-Tropez — are meccas for gay trav-
elers. In Paris, where famous gay people such as Oscar Wilde, James
Baldwin, Alice B. Toklas, and Gertrude Stein once lived, same-sex cou-
ples are treated with polite indifference by everyone from hotel clerks 
to waiters.
In Paris, the gay center is the Marais neighborhood, stretching from the
Hôtel de Ville to place de la Bastille. The biggest concentration of gay
bookstores, cafes, bars, and clothing boutiques is here, and so is the
best source of information on Parisian gay and lesbian life, the Centre
Gai et Lesbien, at 3 rue Keller, 11e (% 01-43-57-21-47; www.cglparis.
org; Métro: Bastille), open daily from 2 to 8 p.m.
Another helpful source in Paris is La Maison des Femmes (163 rue
Charenton, 12e; % 01-43-43-41-13; www.maisondesfemmes.free.fr;
Métro: Charonne), which has a cafe and a feminist library for lesbians
and bisexual women. It holds meetings on everything from sexism to
working rights and sponsors informal dinners and get-togethers. Call
Monday to Friday, 9 a.m. to noon or 3 to 5 p.m., for more information.
In Paris, gay magazines that focus mainly on cultural events include
Illico (free in gay bars). Lesbia is a magazine that caters to lesbians, of
course. You can find these magazines and others at Paris’s largest and
best-stocked gay bookstore, Les Mots à la Bouche (6 rue Ste-Croix-la-
Bretonnerie, 4e; % 01-42-78-88-30; www.motsbouche.com; Métro: Hôtel-
de-Ville). Open Monday to Saturday 11 a.m. to 11 p.m. and Sunday, 2 to 8
p.m., the store carries both French- and English-language publications.
Most large cities in France have gay bars, and we’ve listed those in the
nightlife sections of the appropriate chapters.
For advice on HIV issues, call F.A.C.T.S. (% 01-44-93-16-32) Monday,
Wednesday, and Friday 7 to 9 p.m. The acronym stands for Free Aids
Counseling Treatment and Support, and the English-speaking staff pro-
vides counseling, information, and doctor referrals.
The International Gay and Lesbian Travel Association (IGLTA; % 800-
448-8550 or 954-776-2626; www.iglta.org) is the trade association for
the gay and lesbian travel industry and offers an online directory of gay-
and lesbian-friendly travel businesses.
Many agencies offer tours and travel itineraries specifically for gay and
lesbian travelers. Above and Beyond Tours (% 800-397-2681; www.
abovebeyondtours.com) is the exclusive gay and lesbian tour operator
for United Airlines. Now, Voyager (% 800-255-6951; www.nowvoyager.
Chapter 9: Catering to Special Travel Needs or Interests 99

com) is a well-known San Francisco–based gay-owned and -operated
travel service. Olivia Cruises & Resorts (% 800-631-6277 or 510-655-
0364; www.olivia.com) charters entire resorts and ships for exclusive
lesbian vacations and offers smaller group experiences for gay and 
lesbian travelers.
The following travel guides are available at most travel bookstores and
gay and lesbian bookstores, or you can order them from Giovanni’s
Room bookstore, 1145 Pine St., Philadelphia, PA 19107 (% 215-923-2960;
www.giovannisroom.com); Frommer’s Gay & Lesbian Europe, an
excellent travel resource (www.frommers.com); Out and About (% 888-
874-5100; www.outandabout.com), which offers guidebooks packed
with solid information on the global gay and lesbian scene; Spartacus
International Gay Guide (Bruno Gmünder Verlag; www.spartacus
world.com) and Odysseus, both good, annual English-language guide-
books focused on gay men; the Damron guides (www.damron.com), with
separate, annual books for gay men and lesbians; and Gay Travel A to
Z: The World of Gay & Lesbian Travel Options at Your Fingertips by
Marianne Ferrari (Ferrari Publications; Box 35575, Phoenix, AZ 85069), a
very good gay and lesbian guidebook series.
Exploring Your Special Interests
Whether biking or barging, a host of options is available for special-
interest vacations in France. Exploring these options can be a good 
idea if you’re traveling solo — you travel with folks who have similar
interests — or if you’re journeying with a large group — say, a family
reunion — because organizers take care of all the complex details and
itineraries. People who like to travel with lots of luggage may also enjoy
these tours, because they often help you transport your suitcases from
one spot to the next.
Cruising on a barge
Before the advent of railways, many of the crops, building supplies, raw
materials, and finished products of France were barged through a series
of rivers, canals, and estuaries. These passageways are now accessible
for unique travel cruises. On all these trips, you sleep on the barge and
are served first-rate meals.
 French Country Waterways, Ltd., P.O. Box 2195, Duxbury, MA
02331 (% 800-222-1236 or 781-934-2454; www.fcwl.com), leads
one-week tours from $3,095 to $4,995, double occupancy.
 Le Boat, 980 Awald Rd., Suite 302, Annapolis, MD 21403 (% 800-
992-0291 or 410-972-3008; Fax: 410-280-2406; www.leboat.com),
focuses on regions of France not covered by many other barge
operators. The company’s luxury crafts fit through the narrow
canals and locks of Camarque, Languedoc, and Provence. Each 
six-night tour has ten passengers in five cabins outfitted with
Part II: Planning Your Trip to France 
100

mahogany and brass, plus meals prepared by a Cordon Bleu chef.
Prices are highly variable; six nights in Loire begin at $2,790 per
person, rising to $3,590 in summer.
 World Waterways, 494 Eighth Ave., 22nd Floor, New York, NY 10001
(% 800-833-2620 or 212-594-8787; www.worldwaterways.com),
operates one-week cruises starting at $1,990 per person.
Biking
Backroads, 801 Cedar St., Berkeley, CA 94710 (% 800-462-2848 or 510-
527-1555; Fax: 510-527-1444; www.backroads.com), runs bike tours of
Brittany and Normandy, the Loire Valley, and Provence. Per-person rates
are $2,898 for six days or $3,798 for nine days.
Bike Riders, P.O. Box 130254, Boston, MA 02113 (% 800-473-7040; www.
bikeriderstours.com), runs seven-day biking tours of Provence start-
ing at $3,180. Participants can bike 15 to 35 miles per day on gently
rolling terrain, stay at Relais & Châteaux hotels, and dine at several
highly regarded restaurants.
Picking up the language
Alliance Française, 101 bd. Raspail, 75270 Paris (% 800-6-FRANCE
[800-637-2623] in the United States, or 01-42-84-90-00; Fax: 01-42-84-91-01;
www.alliancefr.org), is a state-approved nonprofit organization with
a network of 1,100 establishments in 138 countries, offering French-
language courses to some 350,000 students. The international school 
in Paris is open all year; one-month courses range from 376€ to 800€
($451–$960).
Learning to cook
At the Ritz-Escoffier Ecole de Gastronomie Français, 15 place Vendôme,
75001 Paris (% 01-43-16-30-50; www.ritzparis.com), you can attend a
public demonstration of some of the sophisticated culinary techniques
that have made France and its chefs famous. They’re conducted every
Monday and Thursday from 3 to 5:30 p.m. and cost 55€ ($66) each.
Advance reservations are recommended, and no previous culinary ex-
perience is necessary. Classes are conducted in a mixture of English and
French, often with a French chef whose words are translated progres-
sively as he or she prepares a complicated meal (a starter, a main course,
and a dessert) from beginning to end. The school also conducts classes
aimed at both amateur and professional chefs that last between 1 and 12
weeks each.

Taking Care of Remaining
Details
In This Chapter
 Obtaining a passport
 Deciding on insurance
 Staying healthy abroad
 Staying in touch
 Dealing with airport security
S
ometimes planning a trip abroad seems to last longer than the
actual trip itself. Although this chapter can’t go out and do every-
thing for you, it does give you advice to help organize those innumerable
loose ends and last-minute details that can frustrate even the most sea-
soned traveler.
Traveling to France with a valid passport is the first requirement — that
and your ticket if you’re flying or arriving by boat. But you also need to
know about such all-important items as travel and medical insurance,
which become important only when you really need them.
Finally, we offer tips about staying connected by cellphone or e-mail, and
some words of advice about keeping up with the latest airport security
measures.
Getting a Passport
A valid passport is the only legal form of identification accepted around
the world. You can’t cross an international border without it. Getting a
passport is easy, but the process takes some time. For an up-to-date
country-by-country listing of passport requirements around the world,
go to the “Foreign Entry Requirements” Web page of the U.S. Department
of State at travel.state.gov/visa/americans1.html.

Applying for a U.S. passport
If you’re applying for a first-time passport, follow these steps:
1. Complete a passport application in person at a U.S. passport
office; a federal, state, or probate court; or a major post office.
To find your regional passport office, either check the U.S.
Department of State Web site, travel.state.gov, or call the
National Passport Information Center (% 877-487-2778) for 
automated information.
2. Present a certified birth certificate as proof of citizenship.
Bringing along your driver’s license, state or military ID, or Social
Security card also is a good idea.
3. Submit two identical passport-sized photos, measuring 2-x-2
inches in size.
You often find businesses that take these photos near a passport
office. Note: You can’t use a strip from a photo-vending machine
because the pictures aren’t identical.
4. Pay a fee.
For people 16 and older, a passport is valid for ten years and costs
$97. For those 15 and younger, a passport is valid for five years and
costs $82.
Make sure that you allow plenty of time before your trip to apply for a
passport; processing normally takes three weeks, but it can take longer
during busy periods (especially spring).
If you have a passport in your current name and issued within the past
15 years (and you were older than 16 when it was issued), you can renew
the passport by mail for $67. Whether you’re applying in person or by
mail, you can download passport applications from the U.S. Department
of State Web site at travel.state.gov. For general information, call 
the National Passport Agency (% 202-647-0518). To find your regional
passport office, either check the U.S. Department of State Web site or
call the National Passport Information Center toll-free number (% 877-
487-2778) for automated information.
Traveling with minors
Having plenty of documentation always is wise when traveling with chil-
dren in today’s world. Keep up to date on details of the changing entry
requirements for children traveling abroad by going to the U.S. Depart-
ment of State Web site: travel.state.gov/visa/americans1.html.
To prevent international child abduction, governments in the European
Union (E.U.) have initiated procedures at entry and exit points. They
often (but not always) include requiring documentary evidence of your
Chapter 10: Taking Care of Remaining Details 103

relationship with your children and permission for the child’s travel
from any parent or legal guardian who isn’t present. Having such docu-
mentation on hand, even if not required, facilitates entries and exits. All
children must have their own passports. To obtain a passport, the child
must be present — that is, in person — at the center issuing the pass-
port. Both parents must be present as well if the child is younger than
14. If one or both parents cannot be present, then a notarized statement
from the absent parent or parents is required.
For more information about passport requirements for your children,
call the National Passport Information Center (% 877-487-2778)
Monday to Friday 8 a.m. to 8 p.m. eastern standard time.
Applying for other passports
The following list offers more information for citizens of Australia,
Canada, New Zealand, and the United Kingdom:
 Australians can visit a local post office or passport office, call the
Australia Passport Information Service (% 131-232 toll-free from
Australia), or log on to www.passports.gov.au for details on how
and where to apply.
 Canadians can pick up applications at passport offices throughout
Canada, post offices, or the central Passport Office, Department 
of Foreign Affairs and International Trade, Ottawa, ON K1A 0G3
(% 800-567-6868; www.ppt.gc.ca). Applications must be accom-
panied by two identical passport-sized photographs and proof of
Canadian citizenship. Processing takes five to ten days when you
apply in person or about three weeks by mail.
 New Zealanders can pick up a passport application at any New
Zealand Passports Office or download one from its Web site. For
information, contact the Passports Office (% 0800-225-050 in New
Zealand or 04-474-8100; www.passports.govt.nz).
 United Kingdom residents can pick up applications for a standard
ten-year passport (five-year passport for children younger than 16)
at passport offices or travel agencies. For information, contact the
United Kingdom Passport Service (% 0870-521-0410; www.ukpa.
gov.uk).
Dealing with a lost passport
Always pack a photocopy of the inside photo page of your passport 
separate from your wallet or purse. In the event your passport is lost 
or stolen, the photocopy can help speed up the replacement process.
When traveling in a group, never let one person carry all the passports.
If the passports are stolen, obtaining new ones can be much more diffi-
cult, because at least one person in a group needs to be able to prove
his or her identity so the others can be identified.
Part II: Planning Your Trip to France 
104

If you’re a U.S. citizen and either lose your passport or have it stolen in
Paris, go to the Consulate of the American Embassy at 2 av. Gabriel, 8e
(% 01-43-12-22-22; Métro: Concorde). Canadians in the same circum-
stances need to visit the Consulate of the Canadian Embassy, 35 av.
Montaigne, 8e (% 01-44-43-29-00; Métro: Franklin-D-Roosevelt or Alma-
Marceau). Australians need to go to the Australian Embassy at 4 rue
Jean-Rey, 15e (% 01-40-59-33-00; Métro: Bir-Hakeim). New Zealanders
need to visit the New Zealand Embassy, 7 rue Léonard-de-Vinci, 16e 
(% 01-45-01-43-43, ext. 280; Métro: Victor-Hugo). The embassy of the
United Kingdom, 35 rue du Faubourg St-Honoré, 8e (% 01-44-51-31-00;
Metro: Concorde or Madeleine). If you have your passport stolen any-
where else in France outside of Paris, contact local police (the phone
number for police anywhere in France is % 17), who will direct you on
how to get a new passport.
Playing It Safe with Travel 
and Medical Insurance
Three kinds of travel insurance are available: trip-cancellation insurance,
medical insurance, and lost-luggage insurance. The cost of travel insur-
ance varies widely, depending on the cost and length of your trip, your
age and health, and the type of trip you’re taking, but expect to pay
between 5 percent and 8 percent of the vacation itself. Here is our 
advice on all three.
 Trip-cancellation insurance helps you get your money back if you
have to back out of a trip, if you have to go home early, or if your
travel supplier goes bankrupt. Allowed reasons for cancellation can
range from sickness to natural disasters to a Department of State
declaration that your destination is unsafe for travel. (Insurers usu-
ally won’t cover vague fears, though, as many travelers discovered
when they tried to cancel their trips after the terrorist attacks of
Sept 11, 2001, because they were wary of flying.)
A good resource is “Travel Guard Alerts,” a list of companies con-
sidered high risk by Travel Guard Group (www.travelguard.com).
Protect yourself further by paying for the insurance with a credit
card — by law, consumers can get their money back on goods and
services not received if they report the loss within 60 days after the
charge is listed on their credit card statement.
Note: Many tour operators include insurance in the cost of the trip
or can arrange insurance policies through a partnering provider, a
convenient and often cost-effective way for the traveler to obtain
insurance. Make sure the tour company is a reputable one, how-
ever. Some experts suggest that you avoid buying insurance from
the tour or cruise company you’re traveling with, saying it’s better
to buy from a third-party insurer than to put all your money in one
place.
Chapter 10: Taking Care of Remaining Details 105

 For travel overseas, most medical insurance health plans (includ-
ing Medicare and Medicaid) don’t provide coverage, and the ones
that do often require you to pay for services upfront, reimbursing
you only after you return home. Even if your plan covers overseas
treatment, most out-of-country hospitals make you pay your bills
upfront and send you a refund only after you’ve returned home and
filed the necessary paperwork with your insurance company. As a
safety net, you may want to buy travel medical insurance, particu-
larly if you’re traveling to a remote or high-risk area where emer-
gency evacuation is a possible scenario. If you require additional
medical insurance, try MEDEX Assistance (% 888-MEDEX-00; www.
medexassist.com), Travel Assistance International (% 800-821-
2828; www.travelassistance.com), or Worldwide Assistance

 Lost luggage insurance is not necessary for most travelers. On
international flights (including U.S. portions of international trips),
baggage coverage is limited to approximately $9.07 per pound, up to
approximately $635 per checked bag. If you plan to check items that
are more valuable than this standard liability, find out whether your
valuables are covered by your homeowner’s policy and get baggage
insurance as part of your comprehensive travel-insurance package.
Don’t buy insurance at the airport, because it’s usually overpriced.
Be sure to take any valuables or irreplaceable items with you in
your carry-on luggage, because many valuables (including books,
money, and electronics) aren’t covered by airline policies.
If your luggage is lost, immediately file a lost-luggage claim at the
airport, detailing its contents. For most airlines, you must report
delayed, damaged, or lost baggage within four hours of arrival.
Airlines are required to deliver luggage — once it’s found —
directly to your house or destination free of charge.

Staying Healthy When You Travel
Getting sick will ruin your vacation, so we strongly advise against it (of
course, last time we checked, the bugs weren’t listening to us any more
than they probably listen to you).
For travel abroad, you may have to pay all medical costs upfront and be
reimbursed later. For information about purchasing additional medical
insurance for your trip, see the previous section.
Part II: Planning Your Trip to France

Talk to your doctor before leaving on a trip if you have any serious and/
or chronic illnesses. For conditions such as epilepsy, diabetes, or heart
problems, wear a MedicAlert identification tag (% 888-633-4298; www.
medicalert.org), which immediately alerts doctors to your condition
and gives them access to your records through MedicAlert’s 24-hour
hotline. Contact the International Association for Medical Assistance 
to Travelers (IAMAT; % 716-754-4883, or 416-652-0137 in Canada; www.
iamat.org) for tips on travel and health concerns in the countries you’re
visiting and lists of local, English-speaking doctors. The United States
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (% 800-311-3435; www.
cdc.gov) provides up-to-date information on health hazards by region
or country and offers tips on food safety.
The French government pays 70 percent of the cost of doctor visits, and
its national health insurance covers 99 percent of France’s population.
Visitors needing medical care in France find that doctors almost always
see them the day of the appointment, and patient fees are relatively inex-
pensive. Patients almost always have to pay upfront unless they’re citi-
zens of European Union countries with reciprocal medical arrangements.
Usually, U.S. health insurance companies reimburse most of the cost of
treating illnesses in foreign countries, so be sure to keep all receipts.
One benefit that U.S. citizens will notice in France is that without the
HMOs to keep an eye on costs, doctors are focused on the patient’s com-
fort rather then the bottom line. For example, injuries for which a U.S.
doctor wouldn’t check you into the hospital at all may mean five days in
a French hospital. Socialized medicine in France also means much less
paperwork. As long as you have medical insurance in the United States
that covers you abroad, you don’t have to worry about treatment in
France. The medical establishment is of high quality, with care for
patients the number-one concern.

Avoiding “economy-class syndrome”
Deep vein thrombosis — or “economy-class syndrome” as it’s known in the world of
flying — is a blood clot that develops in a deep vein. It’s a potentially deadly condition
that can be caused by sitting in cramped conditions — such as an airplane cabin —
for too long. During a flight (especially a long-haul flight), get up, walk around, and
stretch your legs every 60 to 90 minutes to keep your blood flowing. Other preventive
measures include frequent flexing of the legs while sitting, drinking lots of water, and
avoiding alcohol and sleeping pills. If you have a history of deep vein thrombosis, heart
disease, or another condition that puts you at high risk, some experts recommend
wearing compression stockings or taking anticoagulants when you fly; always ask
your physician about the best course for you. Symptoms of deep vein thrombosis
include leg pain or swelling, or even shortness of breath.

If you do get sick, ask the concierge at your hotel to recommend a local
doctor — even his or her own doctor, if necessary. In Paris, you can also
call SOS Help (% 01-46-21-46-46; www.soshelpline.org) between 3
and 11 p.m. for help in English and to ask for an English-speaking doctor.
The Centre Médical Europe (44 rue d’Amsterdam, 9e; % 01-42-81-93-33;
www.centre-medical-europe.com) is another good option. A host of
specialists are located here.
Staying Connected by Cellphone
If you don’t bring your cellphone with you, you can rent one for your
stay in France. In the age of terrorism, rentals of cellphones at airports
have been phased out. But you can try Cellhire (% 800-CELLHIRE in
the U.S., or 08-91-70-01-91 in Paris).
For the rest of you who plan to bring your cellphones with you, the 
rest of this section is for you. The three letters that define much of the
world’s wireless capabilities are GSM (Global System for Mobiles), a 
big, seamless network that makes for easy cross-border cellphone use
throughout Europe and dozens of other countries worldwide. In the
United States, T-Mobile, AT&T Wireless, and Cingular use this quasiuni-
versal system; in Canada, Microcell and some Rogers customers are
GSM, and all Europeans and most Australians use GSM.
If your cellphone is on a GSM system, and you have a world-capable
multiband phone (such as many Sony Ericsson, Motorola, or Samsung
models), you can make and receive calls across civilized areas on much
of the globe, from Andorra to Uganda. Just call your wireless operator
and ask for international roaming to be activated on your account.
Unfortunately, per-minute charges can be high — usually $1 to $1.50 
in France.
That’s why buying an unlocked world phone from the get-go is so impor-
tant. Many cellphone operators sell locked phones that restrict you from
using any other removable computer memory phone chip (called a SIM
card) other than the ones they supply. Having an unlocked phone enables
you to install a cheap, prepaid SIM card (found at a local retailer) in your
destination country. (Show your phone to the salesperson; not all phones
work on all networks.) You’ll get a local phone number — and much, much
lower calling rates. Getting an already locked phone unlocked can be a
complicated process, but it can be done; just call your cellular operator
and say you’ll be going abroad for several months and want to use the
phone with a local provider.
For many, renting a phone is a good idea. (Even world-phone owners
have to rent new phones whenever they’re traveling to non-GSM
regions.) Although you can rent a phone from any number of overseas
sites, including kiosks at airports and at car-rental agencies, we suggest
renting the phone before you leave home. That way you can give loved
ones and business associates your new number, make sure the phone
Part II: Planning Your Trip to France 
108

works, and take the phone wherever you go, which is especially helpful
for overseas trips through several countries where local phone-rental
agencies often bill in local currency and may not let you take the phone
to another country.
Phone rental isn’t cheap. You’ll usually pay $40 to $50 — maybe more —
per week, plus airtime fees of at least a dollar a minute. If you’re travel-
ing to France, though, local rental companies often offer free incoming
calls within their home country, which can save you big bucks. The
bottom line: Shop around.
Two good wireless rental companies are InTouch USA (% 800-872-7626;
www.intouchglobal.com) and RoadPost (% 888-290-1606 or 905-272-
5665; www.roadpost.com). Give them your itinerary, and they’ll tell you
what wireless products you need. InTouch also will advise you for free
on whether your existing phone will work overseas; simply call % 703-
222-7161 between 9 a.m. and 4 p.m. EST, or go to intouchglobal.com/
travel.htm.
Accessing the Internet Away from Home
Travelers have any number of ways to check their e-mail and access the
Internet on the road. Of course, using your own laptop — or even a PDA
(personal digital assistant) or electronic organizer with a modem — gives
you the most flexibility. But even if you don’t have a computer, you still
can access your e-mail and even your office computer from cybercafes.
It’s hard nowadays to find a city that doesn’t have a few cybercafes.
Although no definitive directory exists for cybercafes — these are inde-
pendent businesses, after all — two places to start looking are www.
cybercaptive.com and www.cybercafe.com. The latter site, for 
example, lists some 150 cybercafes in France alone.
Aside from formal cybercafes, most youth hostels nowadays have at
least one computer on which you can access the Internet. And most
public libraries across the world offer Internet access free or for a small
charge. Avoid hotel business centers unless you’re willing to pay exorbi-
tant rates.
Most major airports have Internet kiosks scattered throughout their
gates. These kiosks, which you’ll also see in shopping malls, hotel lob-
bies, and tourist information offices around the world, give you basic
Web access for a per-minute fee that’s usually higher than cybercafe
prices. The clunkiness and high price of these kiosks mean they should
be avoided whenever possible.
To retrieve your e-mail, ask your Internet service provider (ISP)
whether it has a Web-based interface tied to your existing e-mail account.
If your ISP doesn’t have such an interface, you can use the free mail2web
service (www.mail2web.com) to view and reply to your home e-mail. For
Chapter 10: Taking Care of Remaining Details 109

more flexibility, you may want to open a free, Web-based e-mail account
with Yahoo! Mail (mail.yahoo.com). (Microsoft’s Hotmail is another
popular option, but Hotmail has severe spam problems.) Your home 
ISP may be able to forward your e-mail to the Web-based account 
automatically.
If you need to access files on your office computer, look into a service
called GoToMyPC (www.gotomypc.com). The service provides a Web-
based interface for you to access and manipulate a distant PC from 
anywhere — even a cybercafe — provided your “target” PC is on and 
has an always-on connection to the Internet (such as with Road Runner
cable). The service offers top-quality security, but if you’re worried
about hackers, use your own laptop rather than a cybercafe computer 
to access the GoToMyPC system.
In addition, major ISPs have local access numbers around the world,
enabling you to go online simply by placing a local call. Check your ISP’s
Web site or call its toll-free number, and ask how you can use your cur-
rent account away from home and how much it will cost. If you’re travel-
ing outside the reach of your ISP, the iPass network has dial-up numbers
in most of the world’s countries. You’ll have to sign up with an iPass
provider, which then tells you how to set up your computer for your
destination(s). For a list of iPass providers, go to www.ipass.com and
click “Individuals Buy Now.” One solid provider is i2roam (% 866-811-
6209 or 920-233-5863; www.i2roam.com).
Wherever you go, bring a connection kit of the right power and phone
adapters, a spare phone cord, and a spare Ethernet network cable — or
find out whether your hotel supplies them to guests.
In general, the electricity in France is 200 volts AC (60 cycles), though
you’ll encounter 110 and 115 volts in some older establishments. Adapters
are needed to fit sockets. Asking at your hotel before plugging in any
electrical appliance is always a good idea.
Keeping Up with Airline Security Measures
With the federalization of airport security, security procedures at U.S.
airports are more stable and consistent than ever. Generally, you’ll be
fine if you arrive at the airport two hours before your international
flight; if you show up late, tell an airline employee, and she’ll probably
whisk you to the front of the line.
Bring a current, government-issued photo ID such as a driver’s license
or passport. Keep your ID at the ready to show at check-in, the security
checkpoint, and sometimes even the gate. (Children younger than 18
don’t need government-issued photo IDs for domestic flights, but they
do for international flights to most countries.)
Part II: Planning Your Trip to France 
110

In 2003, the TSA phased out gate check-in at all U.S. airports. And 
e-tickets have made paper tickets nearly obsolete. Passengers with 
e-tickets can beat the ticket-counter lines by using airport electronic
kiosks or even online check-in from your home computer. Online check-
in involves logging on to your airlines’ Web site, accessing your reserva-
tion, and printing out your boarding pass — and the airline may even
offer you bonus miles to do so. If you’re using a kiosk at the airport,
bring the credit card you used to book the ticket or your frequent-flier
card. Print out your boarding pass from the kiosk and simply proceed to
the security checkpoint with your pass and a photo ID. If you’re check-
ing bags or looking to snag an exit-row seat, you’ll be able to do so using
most airline kiosks. Even the smaller airlines are employing the kiosk
system, but always call your airline to make sure these alternatives are
available. Curbside check-in also is a good way to avoid lines, although
a few airlines still ban curbside check-in; call before you go.
Security checkpoint lines are getting shorter, but some doozies remain.
If you have trouble standing for long periods of time, tell an airline
employee; the airline will provide a wheelchair. Speed up security by not
wearing metal objects such as big belt buckles. If you’ve got metallic
body parts, a note from your doctor can prevent a long chat with the
security screeners. Keep in mind that only ticketed passengers are
allowed past security, except for folks escorting children or passengers
with disabilities.
Federalization has stabilized what you can carry on and what you
can’t. The general rule is that sharp things are out, nail clippers are
okay, and food and beverages must be passed through the X-ray
machine — but that security screeners can’t make you drink from 
your coffee cup. Bring food in your carry-on rather than checking it, 
as explosive-detection machines used on checked luggage have been
known to mistake food (especially chocolate, for some reason) for
bombs. Travelers in the United States are allowed one carry-on bag, plus
a “personal item” such as a purse, briefcase, or laptop bag. Carry-on
hoarders can stuff all sorts of things into a laptop bag; as long as it has a
laptop in it, it’s still considered a personal item. The Transportation
Security Administration (TSA) has issued a list of restricted items; check
its Web site (www.tsa.gov/public/index.jsp) for details.
Because of increased security measures, the TSA has made changes to
the prohibited items list. Liquids and gels—including shampoo, tooth-
paste, perfume, hair gel, suntan lotion, and all other items with similar
consistency may now be transported in your carry-on. However, each
item must be in containers no larger than 3 ounces in size, and all of
them must be packed in a single zipper-locked plastic bag, which can be
pulled from your carry-on for ease of inspection at the security check-
point. Note that toothpaste tubes cannot be rolled up. 
Chapter 10: Taking Care of Remaining Details 111

Airport screeners may decide that your checked luggage needs to be
searched by hand. You can now purchase luggage locks that enable
screeners to open and relock a checked bag if hand-searching is neces-
sary. Look for Travel Sentry certified locks at luggage or travel shops
and Brookstone stores (you can buy them online at www.brookstone.
com). Approved by the TSA, these locks can be opened by luggage
inspectors with a special code or key. For more information about the
locks, visit www.travelsentry.org. If you use something other than
TSA-approved locks, your lock will be cut off your suitcase if a TSA agent
needs to hand-search your luggage.

Getting There by Plane
It’s easy to get to Paris. As France’s capital, the major auto routes con-
verge here, trains arrive here from all parts of France and Europe, and
the city is served by two airports, Aéroport Charles-de-Gaulle and
Aéroport d’Orly. This section covers getting to Paris by plane.
Getting oriented at CDG
Most visitors to Paris land at Aéroport Charles-de-Gaulle (% 01-48-62-
22-80), the larger, busier, and more modern airport — commonly known
as CDG and sometimes called Roissy–Charles-de-Gaulle — which is 23km
(15 miles) northeast of downtown Paris. Nearly all direct flights from
North America arrive at CDG, which is laid out in an orderly fashion. The
airport is well signposted and is a fairly easy adjustment as your entrance
into France.

Bilevel Terminal 1 (Aérogare 1) is the older and smaller of CDG’s two
terminals and is used by foreign airlines; narrow escalators and moving
sidewalks connect its podlike glass terminals. The bright and spacious
Terminal 2 (Aérogare 2) is used by Air France, domestic and intra-
European airlines, and some foreign airlines, including Air Canada. It’s
divided into halls A through F. A free shuttle bus (navette) connects the
two terminals. Signs in French and English direct you to customs, bag-
gage claim, and transportation to the city. Staff at information desks also
are on hand to answer questions in both terminals.
Find ATMs in the arrival areas of the airports along with bureaux de
change, where you can exchange dollars for euros, but you’re better off
buying and bringing 200€ from your bank at home. Airport ATMs are
notorious for being broken when you need them most, and the airport
bureaux de change are just as notorious for their bad rates of exchange.
Navigating your way through 
passport control and customs
Don’t anticipate any great problems when you pass through passport
control or customs. France is a fairly welcoming country, and unless you
arouse undue suspicion, you’ll pass rather smoothly through the receiv-
ing lines. You may — or may not — be required to open your luggage for
a customs inspection.
Most items brought into France for your personal use (firearms and
drugs excluded, of course) pass through without challenge. In other
words, two tubes of toothpaste are okay. A half-million dollars in dia-
monds and rubies may arouse suspicion.
If you’re traveling to France from another country, remember that goods
and gifts purchased duty free, which means that you need not pay tax in
the country of purchase, are not necessarily duty free on their arrival in
France. However, unless a traveler is bringing in large amounts of goods
and gifts, fellow members of European Union countries travel rather
freely between member nations.
Before getting in a passport or custom control line, have all necessary
documents handy, including a valid passport, which you need to enter
France. You must also produce a visa and work permits, if you fall into
that category, when demanded. Most travelers pass through the lines
without challenge. In these days of increased terrorism alerts, however,
you may be asked questions to ensure that you’re entering France
legally.
Getting from CDG to your hotel
You can get to and from the airport in several different ways, and they’re
all easy.
Part III: Paris and the Best of the Ile de France 
116

 By taxi: Probably the easiest, but certainly not the cheapest, mode
of transportation to your hotel from the airport is by taxi. A cab
into town from Charles-de-Gaulle takes 40 to 50 minutes, depending
on traffic, and costs about 50€ ($65) from 7 a.m. to 8 p.m. and
about 15 percent more at other times. Taxi drivers are required to
turn the meter on and charge the price indicated plus 0.90€ ($1.15)
for each piece of luggage stowed in the trunk. If your French is poor
or nonexistent, write down the name and full address of your hotel.
The five-digit postal code is the most important bit of information,
because it tells the driver to which arrondissement (numbered dis-
trict, pronounced ah-rohn-deez-mahn) to take you. Check the meter
before you pay — rip-offs of arriving tourists are not uncommon.
Whenever you strongly think that you may have been overcharged,
demand a receipt (un réçu; ray-soo), which drivers are obligated to
provide, and contact the Paris Préfecture of Police (% 01-53-71-
53-71).
The following taxi stand locations at Charles-de-Gaulle were cor-
rect at press time, but due to airport construction, these locations
are subject to change. In CDG Terminal 1, you can find them at Exit
20 in the arrivals level; in CDG Terminals 2A and 2C, go to Exit 6 in
either terminal; in CDG Terminals 2B and 2D, go to Exit 8 in either
terminal; and in CDG Terminal 2F, go to Exit 0.10, arrivals level.
 By shuttle: If you don’t want to schlep your bags through Paris’s
streets and Métro, an airport shuttle is the way to go. Though more
expensive than airport buses and trains, shuttles are cheaper and
roomier than a taxi. And you can reserve in advance and pay by
credit card. World Shuttle, 13 rue Voltaire, 94400 Vitry-sur-Seine
(% 01-46-80-14-67; www.world-shuttles.com), costs 26€ ($34)
for one person, 17€ ($22) per person for two or more from Charles-
de-Gaulle and Orly. Before 5:30 a.m., it’s 70€ ($91) for two to four
people.
PariShuttle (% 01-53-39-18-18; www.parishuttle.com) offers a
similar service. You’re picked up in a minivan at Orly or Charles-de-
Gaulle and taken to your hotel for 25€ ($33) for one person, 19€
($25) per person for groups of two to four people, and 16€ ($21)
per person for five to eight people. The cost for children ages 3 to
10 is 10€ ($13).
 By train: A good option when you’re not overloaded with baggage
and want to keep your expenses down is to take the suburban com-
muter train to the Métro. RER (Réseau Express Régional) Line B
stops near Terminals 1 and 2. Easy, cheap, and convenient, you can
ride both to and from the airport from 5 a.m. to midnight Monday
through Friday, and 7 a.m. to 9 p.m. weekends.
Free shuttle buses connect terminals CDG 1 and CDG 2 to the 
RER train station. In CDG Terminal 1, follow RER signs to exit on
arrivals level to find the shuttle bus; in CDG Terminal 2A, use Exit
A8; in CDG Terminal 2B, use Exit B6; in CDG Terminal 2C, use Exit
Chapter 11: Settling into Paris, City of Light 117

C8; in CDG Terminal 2D, use Exit D6; and in CDG Terminal 2F, use
Exit 2.06.
You can also take a walkway to the RER station — ask an airport
employee or look for the round RER logo. (RER is pronounced air-
uh-air in French.)
Buy the RER ticket, which costs 12€ ($16) for adults and 5.55€
($7.20) for children, at the RER ticket counter and hang onto it in
case of ticket inspection. (You can be fined if you can’t produce
your ticket for an inspector.) In any case, you need your ticket later
to get off the RER system and onto the Métro.
Depending where your hotel is located, you exit either on the Right
or the Left Bank. From the airport station, trains depart about
every 15 minutes for the half-hour trip into town and stop on the
Right Bank at Gare du Nord and Châtelet–Les Halles, and on the
Left Bank at St-Michel, Luxembourg, Port-Royal, and Denfert-
Rochereau, before heading south out of the city.
 By bus: A bus is better than the RER if you’re heading into Paris
during off-peak driving hours, and you’re not in a hurry or if your
hotel is located near one of the drop-off points. Note: The bus is
most convenient for the hotels we recommend in the 2e and 8e
arrondissements. If you’re staying outside these arrondissements,
you can take a taxi from the shuttle drop-off point or board the
closest subway if you aren’t loaded down with luggage. If a bus isn’t
convenient, check out the door-to-door airport shuttle services in
the earlier “Taking a shuttle” section.
If your hotel is located on the Right Bank, in the 8e, 16e, or 17e
arrondissements, take Air France coach Line 2, which stops at rue
Gouvion St-Cyr at Porte Maillot before ending up at 1 av. Carnot at
place Charles-de-Gaulle–Etoile, the name for the huge traffic round-
about at the Arc de Triomphe. The bus costs 10€ ($13) one-way
and runs every 15 minutes from 5:45 a.m. to 11:30 p.m. You do not
have to be a passenger on an Air France flight to use the service.
Tickets are available in an Air France office next to the bus stop
(both tellers and ticket machines are available). The trip from the
airport into the city and vice versa takes about 40 minutes in light
traffic, such as on weekend mornings. During weekday morning
rush hour, however, the same trip can take twice as long, if not
longer. From CDG Terminal 2A, pick up the coach from Exit 5; in
Terminals 2B, 2C, and 2D, pick up the coach from Exit 6; and in
Terminal 2F, pick it up at Exit 0.07, arrivals level. Note that due to
construction at CDG bus terminals are subject to change.
If your hotel is located on the Right Bank near the Bastille (11e or
12e) or on the Left Bank in Montparnasse (14e), take the Air France
Line 4 coach, which stops at boulevard Diderot in front of the Gare
de Lyon before ending up on rue du Commandant Mouchotte near
the back of the Gare de Montparnasse. The bus costs 12€ ($16)
one-way and runs every 30 minutes from 7 a.m. to 9:30 p.m. both to
Part III: Paris and the Best of the Ile de France 
118

and from the airport. It takes about 50 minutes to get from the air-
port into the city in light traffic. Catch this coach in CDG Terminal
1 at Exit 34 (arrivals level); from CDG Terminals 2A and 2C, use
Terminal 2C’s Exit 2; from CDG Terminals 2B and 2D, use Terminal
2B’s Exit 2; and from CDG Terminal 2F, use Exit 0.07 (arrivals level).
Take the Roissybus if your hotel is on the Right Bank near the
Opéra (2e or 9e). It costs 8.30€ ($11) and leaves every 15 minutes
from the airport between 6 a.m. and 11 p.m. (from 5:45 a.m. to 11:46
p.m. back to the airport). The drop-off point is on rue Scribe, a
block from the Opéra Garnier near American Express. You can get
to your destination in 45 to 50 minutes in regular traffic. Buy your
tickets in the small office next to where the bus is parked. For CDG
Terminal 1, pick up this coach from Exit 30, Level 5 (arrivals level);
for CDG Terminals 2A and 2C, use Terminal 2A’s Exit 9; for CDG
Terminal 2B, use Exit 12; for CDG Terminal 2D, use Exit 11; and for
CDG Terminal 2F, use Exit 0.08 (arrivals level).
Getting oriented at Orly
Intra-France and continental flights make the most use of Aéroport
d’Orly (% 01-49-75-15-15), 14km (81⁄2 miles) south of the city, although
overseas flights also land here. Orly airport has two terminals — Ouest
(West) and Sud (South) — and the terminals are easy to navigate. French
domestic flights land at Orly Ouest, and intra-European and interconti-
nental flights land at Orly Sud. Shuttle buses connect these terminals,
and other shuttles connect them to Charles-de-Gaulle every 30 minutes
or so. You can pick up city maps and other visitor essentials at a nearby
tourist information desk. You also can find ATMs in Orly’s terminals.
Getting from Orly to your hotel
Orly offers a number of transportation options to get you from the air-
port to your hotel.
 By bus: The cheapest trip into town is on the Jetbus. You take this
bus from Orly to Métro station Villejuif–Louis-Aragon in south Paris
(13e). It costs 5.15€ ($6.70) for the 15-minute journey. Beginning at
6:34 a.m., the bus leaves every 15 minutes from Orly Sud, Exit H, and
Platform 2 and from Orly Quest at Exit C on the arrivals level. The
bus departs Paris for Orly from 6:15 a.m. to 10:15 p.m. An Orly bus
also operates from 6 a.m. to 11:30 p.m. from Exit J, arrivals level at
Orly Ouest, and from Exit H Platform 4 at Orly Sud to the Left Bank’s
Denfert-Rochereau station. It costs 5.80€ ($7.50) for the 25-minute
journey. It departs Paris for Orly from 5:35 a.m. to 11:00 p.m.
Another bus option involves taking the Air France coach Line 1
if your hotel is located on the Left Bank near Les Invalides (7e).
Buses leave Orly Sud at Exit K, and Orly Ouest at Exit D, arrivals
level every 12 to 15 minutes. The trip takes 30 minutes and costs
7.50€ ($9.75). You can request that the bus stop at Montparnasse-
Duroc (14e).
Chapter 11: Settling into Paris, City of Light 119

 By taxi: A cab from Orly into Paris costs about 35€ ($46), depend-
ing on traffic, and takes anywhere from 25 minutes to an hour. The
taxi stand at Orly Sud is just outside Exit L; at Orly Ouest it’s at 
Exit I. The same advice as when taking a taxi from Charles-de-Gaulle
holds true here: Write down the full name and address of your hotel
for the driver. And remember that cabs charge 0.90€ ($1.15) for
each piece of luggage put in the trunk.
 By train: You can also take the RER C line, which is a bit of a hassle.
You catch a free shuttle bus from Exit G, Platform 1, at Orly Sud and
Exit F on the arrivals level at Orly Ouest to the Rungis station, where
RER C trains leave every 15 minutes for Gare d’Austerlitz (13e). A
one-way fare is 5.25€ ($6.85), and the trip into the city takes 30 min-
utes, making various stops along the Seine on the Left Bank.
If you’re staying on the Right Bank, you can take the RER B line to
Châtelet Métro station. From Orly Sud, it departs from Exit K near
the baggage-claim area; from Orly Ouest, it leaves from Exit D on
the departures level. You connect at the Antony RER station, where
you board the RER B train to Paris. Hold on to the ticket, because
you’ll need it to get into the Métro/RER system. A trip to the Châtelet
station on the Right Bank takes about 30 minutes and costs 7.50€
($9.75).
Getting There by Land or Sea
If you’re embarking on your Paris trip from elsewhere in Europe, you can
also get to Paris by train, bus, car, or even hovercraft.
Arriving by train
Paris has many rail stations, but most international trains arrive at one
of four places. The Gare du Nord serves northern Germany, Belgium,
the Netherlands, Denmark, and London. It’s the destination for both the
Eurostar direct train that uses the Channel Tunnel (aka Chunnel) — a
dozen trains daily for a three-hour trip — as well as trains arriving on
the last leg of the old-fashioned and highly discouraged route: London to
Dover by train; Dover to Calais by ferry; and Calais to Paris by train (ten-
and-a-half long hours for the trip). Trains from the southwest (the Loire
Valley, Pyrénées, Spain) arrive at the Gare d’Austerlitz near the Jardin
des Plantes, 13e. Those from the south and southeast (the Riviera, Lyon,
Italy, Geneva) pull in at the Gare de Lyon. Trains coming from Alsace
and eastern France, Luxembourg, southern Germany, and Zurich arrive
at the Gare de l’Est. All train stations connect to Métro stations with 
the same name. All Paris train stations are located within the first 15
arrondissements, and are easily accessible.
If you’re considering traveling to Paris from the United Kingdom, prob-
ably the easiest route is to take a train through the Channel Tunnel. The
tunnel (or Chunnel as it’s fondly called) opened in 1994, and the popular-
ity of its Eurostar train service has had the happy effect of driving down
Part III: Paris and the Best of the Ile de France

prices on all cross-channel transport. This remarkable engineering feat
means that if you hop aboard Le Shuttle in Britain, you can be eating a
meal in France two to four hours later. You can purchase tickets in
advance or at the tollbooth. Eurostar tickets start at US$70 one-way, off
season if you book seven days in advance. Prices rise in April and in
June. Eurostar transports passengers only (no vehicles) between London
or Ashford in Kent and Paris, Brussels, Lille, and beyond. For more infor-
mation on Eurostar, including online booking, go to www.eurostar.com.
For special packages information in the U.S., visit RailEurope (www.
raileurope.com) or the TravelPro Network (www.travelpro.net).
A separate company known as Eurotunnel (% 08-05-35-35-35 in the
U.K.; www.eurotunnel.com) can transport passengers with their cars
between Folkestone in the United Kingdom and Calais in France. Car
prices start at £ 49 ($88) for a round-trip day trip and rise to £180 ($324)
for a round-trip journey longer than five days. One-way prices start at
£49 ($88).
Arriving by bus
Buses connect Paris to most major European cities. European Railways
operates Europabus and Eurolines. The companies don’t have American
offices, so you must make bus transportation arrangements after arriv-
ing in Europe. In Great Britain, contact Eurolines (% 08-705-80-80-80
[7.90p/15¢ per minute]). In Paris, contact Eurolines (at their Latin
Quarter agency at 55 rue St Jacques, 5e; % 43-54-11-99). International
buses pull into the Gare Routière Internationale (International Bus
Terminal) in the suburb of Bagnolet, just across the périphérique (ring
road) from the Galliéni Métro station. To go into Paris proper, take Line 3
and change buses according to your final destination.
Arriving by ferry and tunnel
About a dozen companies run hydrofoil, ferry, and hovercraft across the
English Channel, or La Manche (“the sleeve,” pronounced la mahnsh), as
the French say. Services operate daily and most carry cars. Hovercraft
and hydrofoils make the trip in 40 minutes; the shortest ferry route
between Dover and Calais is about one-and-a-half hours. The major
routes are between Dover and Calais, and Folkestone and Boulogne
(about 12 trips a day). Depending on weather conditions, prices and
timetables can vary. Making a reservation always is important, because
ferries are crowded.
For information stateside, call BritRail (% 866-BRITRAIL; www.
britrail.com) or Britain Bound Travel (% 800-805-8210). In Britain,
contact Hoverspeed (% 870-240-8070; www.hoverspeed.co.uk).
Special fares are offered, but they change frequently. A good travel agent
in London can help you sort out the maze of ferry schedules, find a suit-
able option, and book your ticket.
Chapter 11: Settling into Paris, City of Light 121

About a dozen companies run hydrofoil, ferry, and hovercraft across
the English Channel. Services operate daily and most carry cars. Hover-
craft and hydrofoils make the trip across the Channel in about 40 min-
utes; the shortest ferry route between Dover and Calais is about one-
and-a-half hours. The major routes are between Dover and Calais and
Folkestone and Boulogne (about 12 trips a day). Depending on weather
conditions, prices and timetables can vary. This is not the best way to
get to Paris from the U.K.; the entire trip from London to Dover by train,
then from Dover to Calais by ferry, and Calais to Paris by train takes
about ten-and-a-half hours. You can check schedules and reserve space
on ferries on Ferrybooker.com (www.ferrybooker.com). Special fares
at press time included Dover to Calais for 60€ ($78) per car with up to
five passengers. It’s important to make reservations because ferries are
crowded.
Arriving by car
If you drive, remember that the périphérique circles Paris — and its exits
aren’t numbered. The major highways are the A1 from the north (Great
Britain and Belgium); the A13 from Normandy and other points in north-
west France; the A109 from Spain and the southwest; the A7 from the
Alps, the Riviera, and Italy; and the A4 from eastern France. Avoid rush
hours (weekdays 7:30–9:30 a.m. and 5:30–7:30 p.m.) and the days before
long weekends and holidays.
Orienting Yourself in Paris
The Seine River divides Paris into two halves: the Right Bank (Rive
Droite) on the north side of the river and the Left Bank (Rive Gauche)
on the south side. The larger Right Bank is where the city’s business
sector, stately monuments, and the high-fashion industry are located.
The Left Bank has publishing houses, universities, and a bohemian repu-
tation because students, philosophers, and creative types have been
congregating there for centuries. Two of the city’s tallest monuments are
on the Left Bank — the Tour Montparnasse (that lonely tall black build-
ing hovering on the edge of the city) and the Tour Eiffel.
The city is divided into 20 numbered arrondissements (ah-rohn-deez-
mahn). The layout of these districts follows a distinct pattern. The 1st
(abbreviated 1er for premiere) arrondissement is dead-center Paris, com-
prising the area around the Louvre. From here, the rest of the districts
spiral outward and clockwise, in ascending order. The lower the arron-
dissement number, the more central the location. To get a better idea,
consult the “Paris Arrondissements” map in this chapter.
Arrondissement numbers are key to locating an address in Paris. We list
addresses the way they appear in Paris, with the arrondissement number
following the specific street address (for instance, 29 rue de Rivoli, 4e, is
in the 4th arrondissement). Arrondissement numbers are on street signs
and indicated in the last two digits of the postal code; for instance, an
Part III: Paris and the Best of the Ile de France 
122

address with the postal code 75007 is in the 7th arrondissement (7e).
When you know the arrondissement in which an address is located, find-
ing that spot is much easier. Numbers on buildings running parallel to
the Seine usually follow the course of the river east to west. On north–
south streets, numbering begins at the river.
Paris by arrondissement
This section gives you a quick run through Paris. Neighborhoods are
listed first by arrondissement and then by neighborhood name. Only the
best-known arrondissements — meaning the ones that you’re most likely
to stay in or visit — are mentioned.
On the Right Bank
Your tour of Right Bank arrondissements starts with the central one: the
1er arrondissement.
 Ile de la Cité is connected to the nearby posh residential island of
Ile de St-Louis. Traditionally, people consider the Right Bank to be
more upscale, with Paris’s main boulevards such as Champs-Elysées
and museums such as the Louvre. One of the world’s greatest art
museums (some say the greatest), Musée du Louvre, lures visitors
to Paris to the 1er arrondissement (Musée du Louvre/Palais-Royal/
Les Halles). You can see many of the city’s elegant addresses along
the rue de Rivoli and arched arcades under which all kinds of
touristy junk is sold. Walk through the Jardin des Tuileries, the
most formal garden of Paris, or take in the classic beauty of the
place Vendôme, opulent, wealthy, and home of the Hôtel Ritz.
Browse the arcaded shops, and view the striped columns and sea-
sonal art on display in the garden of the Palais Royal, once home
to Cardinal Richelieu. The sketchy Forum des Halles, an above-
and below-ground shopping and entertainment center, also is here.
This arrondissement tends to be crowded, and hotels are higher
priced during Paris high tourist season (in early fall) because the
area is so convenient.
 Often overlooked, the drab 2e arrondissement (La Bourse) houses
the Bourse (stock exchange) and pretty 19th-century covered
shopping passageways known as arcades. The district, between the
Grands Boulevards and rue Etienne Marcel, is home to the Sentier,
where the garment trade is located and wholesale fashion outlets
abound. Sex shops and prostitutes line parts of rue St-Denis.
 The 3e arrondissement (Le Marais) is one of Paris’s hippest neigh-
borhoods and hosts one of the city’s most popular attractions, the
Musée Picasso, and one of its most interesting museums, Musée
Carnavalet. Paris’s old Jewish neighborhood is here around rue
des Rosiers, and rue Vieille-du-Temple is home to numerous gay
bars and boutiques.
 Aristocratic town houses, courtyards, antiques shops, flower mar-
kets, the Palais de Justice, Cathédrale Notre-Dame, Ste-Chapelle,

Chapter 11: Settling into Paris, City of Light 125

the Centre Georges Pompidou, and the place des Vosges — they’re
all here on the two islands of the 4e arrondissement (Ile de la
Cité/Ile St-Louis/Centre Pompidou). The islands located in the
middle of the Seine compose one of the prettiest, and most crowded,
of Paris’s arrondissements. The area around the Centre Pompidou
is one of Paris’s more eclectic; you see everyone from pierced and
goth-style art students to chic Parisians sipping coffee at Café
Beaubourg to visitors buying football shirts from one of the many
souvenir stores.
 The 8e arrondissement (Champs-Elysées/Madeleine) is the heart
of the Right Bank, and its showcase is the Champs-Elysées. The
fashion houses, the most elegant hotels, expensive restaurants and
shops, and the most fashionably attired Parisians are here. The
Champs stretches from the Arc de Triomphe to the city’s oldest
monument, the Egyptian obelisk on place de la Concorde.
 Everything from the Quartier de l’Opéra to the strip joints of
Pigalle falls within the 9e arrondissement (Opéra Garnier/Pigalle),
which was radically altered by Baron Haussmann’s 19th-century
redevelopment projects; his Grands Boulevards radiate through the
district. You’ll probably pay a visit to the 9e to shop at its infamous
department stores, Au Printemps and Galeries Lafayette. Try to
visit the swanky Opéra Garnier (Paris Opera House), which has
been beautifully restored.
 In the movie Amélie, the young heroine Amélie likes to skip stones
on the Canal St-Martin, located here in the 10e arrondissement
(Gare du Nord/Gare de l’Est). Although most of this arrondisse-
ment is dreary (Gare du Nord and Gare de l’Est are two of the
city’s four main train stations), the canal’s quai de Valmy and quai
de Jemmapes are scenic, tree-lined promenades. The classic movie
Hôtel du Nord was filmed here.
 The 11e arrondissement (Bastille) has few landmarks or famous
museums, but the area is a mecca for young Parisians looking for
casual, inexpensive nightlife. Always crowded on weekends and in
summer, the overflow retires to the steps of the Opéra Bastille,
where in-line skaters and skateboarders abound and teens flirt.
 The 16e arrondissement (Trocadero/Bois de Boulogne) is where
the moneyed live. Highlights include the Bois de Boulogne, Jardin
du Trocadéro, Musée de Balzac, Musée Guimet (famous for its
Asian collections), and Cimetière de Passy, resting place of Manet,
Talleyrand, Giraudoux, and Debussy. One of the largest arrondisse-
ments, the 16e is known today for its exclusivity, its BCBG residents
(Bon Chic Bon Genre), its upscale rents, and some rather posh
(and, to some, rather smug) residential boulevards. The arrondisse-
ment also embraces what some consider the best place in Paris
from which to view the Tour Eiffel, place du Trocadéro.
 Montmartre, Moulin Rouge, Basilica of Sacré-Coeur, and place du
Tertre are only some of the attractions in the 18e arrondissement
Part III: Paris and the Best of the Ile de France 
126

(Montmartre). Take a walk through the winding old streets here,
and you feel transported into another era. The city’s most famous
flea market, Marché aux Puces de la Porte de St-Ouen, on the
arrondissement’s outskirts, is another landmark, as is the Bateau-
Lavoir, where Picasso had his studio.
On the Left Bank
The following are neighborhoods you’re likely to visit on the Left Bank:
 Bookstores, schools, churches, night clubs, student dives, Roman
ruins, publishing houses, and expensive boutiques characterize the
5e arrondissement (Latin Quarter), called “Latin” because stu-
dents and professors at the Sorbonne, located here, once spoke
Latin. Stroll along quai de Montebello, inspecting the inventories
of the bouquinistes (booksellers), and wander the shops in the old
streets of rue de la Huchette and rue de la Harpe — but don’t eat
here; other neighborhoods in the 5e offer much better options. The
5e also stretches down to the Panthéon and to the steep cobble-
stone rue Mouffetard behind it, where you can visit one of the
city’s best produce markets, eat at a variety of ethnic restaurants,
or raise a glass in très cool Café Contrescarpe.
 The art school that turned away Rodin, École des Beaux-Arts, is in
the 6e arrondissement (St-Germain-des-Près/Luxembourg), and so
are some of the chicest designers around. But the secret of the dis-
trict is in its narrow streets and hidden squares. Everywhere you
turn in the district, you encounter famous historical and literary
associations. For instance, the restaurant Brasserie Lipp, located
here, is where Hemingway lovingly recalls eating potato salad in A
Moveable Feast, and the Café les Deux Magots is depicted in The
Sun Also Rises. The 6e takes in the rue de Fleurus, where Gertrude
Stein lived with Alice B. Toklas, and down the street is the wonder-
ful Jardin du Luxembourg, Parisians’ most loved park. (Note: Try
to find the Statue of Liberty here.)
 The city’s most famous symbol, Tour Eiffel, dominates the 7e
arrondissement (Tour Eiffel). Part of the St-Germain neighbor-
hood is here, too. The Hôtel des Invalides, which contains both
Napoléon’s Tomb and the Musée de l’Armée, is also in the 7e, as
are Musée Rodin and Musée d’Orsay, the world’s premier show-
case of 19th-century French art and culture. The Left Bank’s only
department store, Le Bon Marché, is here, and so are streets sell-
ing beautiful shoes, clothing, and objects for the home.
 Although high-rise buildings dominate much of the 13e arrondisse-
ment (Chinatown/Butte-aux-Cailles), a nightlife scene is emerging
on the dance barges along the quai Tolbiac (where the Bibliothèque
François Mitterand sits) and in the cozy network of winding streets
making up the Butte-aux-Cailles (literally, “hill of pebbles”) neigh-
borhood. The 13e also is a lively hub for Paris’s Asian community,
with Vietnamese and Chinese restaurants along av. d’Ivry and av.
Chapter 11: Settling into Paris, City of Light 127

de Choisy next to stores selling items from France’s former
colonies in Southeast Asia. The Chinese New Year Parade takes
place here in late January or February.
 The 14e arrondissement (Montparnasse) is the former stomping
ground of the “lost generation”: Writers Gertrude Stein, Ernest
Hemingway, Edna St. Vincent Millay, Ford Madox Ford, and other
expatriates gathered here in the 1920s. After World War II, it ceased
to be the center of intellectual life in Paris, but the memory lingers
in its cafes. Some of the world’s most famous literary cafes —
including La Rotonde, Le Select, La Dôme, and La Coupole — are
in the northern end of this large arrondissement, near the Rodin
statue of Balzac at the junction of boulevard Montparnasse and
boulevard Raspail. Some of the literary giants (most notably Jean-
Paul Sartre and Simone de Beauvoir) are buried nearby, in the
Cimitière du Montparnasse. At its southern end, the 14e contains
pleasant residential neighborhoods filled with well-designed apart-
ment buildings, many built between 1910 and 1940.

Getting Around Paris
Getting around Paris on foot is the best way to really appreciate the city’s
character. Some of the best walking neighborhoods are St-Germain-des-
Prés on the Left Bank and the Marais on the Right Bank, both of which
are filled with romantic little courtyards, offbeat boutiques, and con-
genial cafes and watering holes. The quais of the Seine and its bridges
also are lovely, especially at sunset, when the sun fills the sky with a pink
glow that’s reflected on the water. Try not to miss the pretty Canal St-
Martin with its arched bridges and locks in the 10e, featured in the movies
Amélie and Hôtel du Nord. If your itinerary takes you to Montmartre, add
in some extra time just to stroll; this is a village within the city, and the
hilly streets with old lampposts evoke another rich era.
By Métro and RER
Open from 5:45 a.m. to 12:45 a.m., the Métropolitain (the Métro) is an
efficient, quick, cheap, and safe way to get around — pretty spry for a
105-year-old. Don’t be afraid to use it. The only times you may want to
avoid it are during rush hour, generally between 7 to 10 a.m. and 6 and 8
p.m. weekdays. Operated by the RATP (Régie Autonome des Transports
Parisiens), as are city buses, the Métro has a total of 16 lines and more
than 360 stations, making it likely that one is near your destination. 
The Métro is connected to the suburban commuter train, the Réseau
Express Régional (RER), which connects downtown Paris with its air-
ports and suburbs.
You can recognize a Métro station either by an elegant Art Nouveau gate-
way reading METROPOLITAIN or by a big yellow M sign. Unless otherwise
marked, all Métro stations have a ticket booth, where you purchase a
single ticket (1.40€/$1.80) or a group of ten tickets called a carnet (kar-
nay; 11€/$14) from an attendant or, in most stations, from a machine
that accepts only bills and coins (no credit cards). Every Métro stop has
maps of the system; you can get portable maps by asking at a ticket
booth for une carte (oon kart). Near the exits, you can find a plan du
quartier, a very detailed pictorial map of the streets and buildings sur-
rounding the station, with all exits marked. A good idea is to consult the
plan du quartier before you exit the system, especially at very large sta-
tions. You may want to use a different exit to reach the other side of a
busy street or wind up closer to your destination.
Boarding the Métro
Navigating the Métro is easy, and you’ll be a pro in no time. Here’s what
you do:
1. Using this book, figure out what station is the closest to where
you are.
For example, if you want to go to the Louvre and are in your hotel
in the Latin Quarter — say, the Familia — check the listing in this
Chapter 11: Settling into Paris, City of Light 129

book for your hotel. It gives the nearest Métro station, your starting
point — in this case, Jussieu. Look at the Métro map on the inside
front cover of this book for the line that the Jussieu station is on.
(Each end of the lines on the Métro map is marked with the number
of the line.) The Jussieu station is on Line 7.
2. Look for your destination station — for example, the Louvre.
You’ll find two stops for the Louvre: the Palais Royal–Musée du
Louvre station on Line 7 and the Louvre Rivoli station on Line 14.
Choose the Palais-Royal–Musée du Louvre station, and you won’t
have to change trains.
3. Walk to the Métro station; you will recognize it by its Art Nouveau
gateway reading METROPOLITAIN or by a big yellow M sign.
Unless otherwise marked, all Métro stations have a ticket booth,
where you purchase your tickets. Most stations have automated
ticket machines as well.
4. When you get beyond the ticket booths, you enter the Métro
system through a turnstile with two ticket slots. Insert your ticket
into the nearer slot with the magnetic strip facing down.
The ticket pops out of the second slot. Remove it, and then either
walk through a set of rubberized doors that briskly open on each
side or push through a turnstile. Keep your ticket with you until
you exit the station. At any point while you’re in the Métro, an
inspector may ask to see your ticket. If you fail to produce it, you
are subject to a steep fine. When you ride the RER, you must keep
your ticket because you have to insert it in a turnstile when you
exit the station.
After you’re past the Métro’s entrance, you need to make sure that you
take the train in the right direction. Look at your subway map, and trace
the line past your destination to its end. The name of the station at the
end of the line is the name of the subway train on which you’ll be travel-
ing; in the case of Line 7, the train is La Courneuve. Follow the signs
directing you to the platform where this train stops. To get back to your
hotel from the Louvre, you take the train marked Villejuif Louis Aragon
and exit at the Jussieu station.
Transferring Métro lines
Suppose, however, that the Métro line nearest to you doesn’t go directly
to your destination. For example, you want to go to the Arc de Triomphe
from Jussieu, and the stop is Charles-de-Gaulle–Etoile. Find the Charles-
de-Gaulle–Etoile stop on the Métro map. You see that Charles-de-Gaulle–
Etoile can be reached by Line 6 or Line 1. But you are on Line 7. You have
to change trains, an action that is called a correspondance, or transfer.
On your map are blank white circles where a number of lines intersect,
indicating where the transfer stations are, where you change subway
trains. To figure out where you need to change trains to get on Line 1 or
Part III: Paris and the Best of the Ile de France 
130

Line 6, use the map to see where Line 7 and Line 1 or Line 7 and Line 6
intersect. Line 7 and Line 6 intersect at Stalingrad, opposite from where
you want to go. But Line 7 and Line 1 intersect at Concorde, very close
to Charles-de-Gaulle–Etoile. To make sure you go in the right direction
on Line 1, look on your map for the name of the station at the very end
past Charles-de-Gaulle–Etoile. It is Grande Arche de La Défense, and your
train will be marked with this name.
You get out at Concorde and look for the bright orange Correspondance
sign above the platform and the white sign that shows the number 1 in a
circle. This number refers to the line you want, so go in the direction the
sign indicates. You eventually come to two stairwells leading to the plat-
forms. The stairwells are marked by navy blue signs that indicate the
direction of the train. The signs also list all the stops the train makes.
Make sure you choose the stairwell leading to the train going in the
direction of Grande Arche de La Défense. Then board the train and exit
at Charles-de-Gaulle–Etoile. Blue signs reading “sortie” mark all exits.
The distances between platforms at the correspondance stations can 
be very long. You may climb stairs and walk a short distance, only to
descend stairs to walk some more. Châtelet is particularly long. Some
lines are connected by moving sidewalks that seem to do nothing but
make a very long walk only a little less long. People with limited mobility
may want to take the bus or a cab.
The Métro connects with the suburban commuter train, the RER, at sev-
eral stations in the city. The RER operates on a zone fare system, but
Métro tickets are valid on it within the city. You probably won’t go past
the first two zones, unless you visit Disneyland on the A4 or Versailles
on the C5. When you ride the RER, it is important to keep your ticket,
because you will need to insert it into a turnstile to leave the station.
The doors on most Métro cars do not open automatically. You must lift a
door handle or press a button.
After the subway shuts down around 1 a.m., the RATP operates Noctilien,
night buses that run on the hour from 1:30 a.m. to 5:30 a.m. from Châtelet-
Hôtel de Ville, but they don’t cover every arrondissement. Check the
maps at the entrance to Métro stations to determine if a Noctambus
services your destination. (If your hotel isn’t in a Noctambus zone, con-
sult the sidebar “Top taxi stands” later in this chapter for the one near-
est you and queue up with all the others who are trying to get home.)
The bus has a distinctive yellow-and-black owl symbol, and tickets cost
2.70€ ($3.50).
By bus
The bus system is convenient and can be an inexpensive way to sightsee
without wearing out your feet. Most Parisian buses run from 6:30 a.m. to
8:30 p.m.; a few run until 12:30 a.m. Each bus shelter has a route map,
which you want to check carefully. Because of the number of one-way
Chapter 11: Settling into Paris, City of Light 131

streets, the bus is likely to make different stops depending on its direc-
tion. Main stops are written on the sides of the buses, with the end-
points shown on the front above the driver.
Métro tickets are valid for bus travel, and although you can buy single
tickets from the conductor, you can’t buy carnets on the bus. Board at
the front of the bus. If you have a single-trip ticket, insert it into the slot
in the small machine right behind the driver; the machine punches your
ticket and pops it back out. If you have a pass, show it to the driver. To
get off at the next stop, press one of the red buttons on the safety poles;
the ARRÊT DEMANDE (stop requested) sign lights up above the driver.
The downside of taking the bus is that it often gets mired in heavy Paris
traffic, so we don’t recommend it if you’re in a hurry. And, like the Métro,
it’s better to avoid riding the bus during rush hours when it seems le
monde (the world) is sharing the bus with you.
Bus routes that are great for sightseeing include Bus 69 (Tour Eiffel,
Hôtel des Invalides, Musée du Louvre, Hôtel de Ville, place des Vosges,
Bastille, and Cimetière du Père-Lachaise), Bus 80 (department stores on
bd. Haussmann, Champs-Elysées, av. Montaigne haute-couture shopping,
and Tour Eiffel), and Bus 96 (St-Germain-des-Prés, Musée de Cluny, Hôtel
de Ville, and place des Vosges).
By taxi
When it comes to hiring a taxi in Paris, you have three options. We rank
them here in order of how successful they are.
 The best way to find a cab is by phoning Alpha Taxis (% 01-45-85-
85-85) or Taxis G7 (% 01-47-39-47-39). Keep in mind, however, that
phoning ahead is more expensive because the meter starts running
as soon as the driver commences the journey to get you.
 You can also wait at a taxi stand (station de taxis; see the nearby
“Top taxi stands” sidebar); a blue TAXI sign denotes the stands.
Depending on the time of day, however, you may wait in a long line
of people, or a very limited number of cabs stop.
 Finally, you can hail a cab, as long as you’re not within 200 feet of a
taxi stand. Look for a taxi with its white light illuminated, which
means the cab is available. An orange light means the cab is occu-
pied or on the way to a pickup. You may get a cab driver who
refuses to take you to your destination; by law, a driver can do this
only during his or her last half-hour at work. Be prepared, as well,
for the selective vision of drivers, especially when you hail a cab.
Don’t be surprised to see a free taxi or two pass you by.
By car
Streets are narrow; parking is next to impossible; and nerve, skill, ruth-
lessness, and a knowledgeable copilot are required whenever you insist
Part III: Paris and the Best of the Ile de France 
132

on driving in Paris. We strongly recommend that you do not. (If you must
drive in Paris, do it in Aug, when traffic is lighter.) If you do decide to
drive, these tips may make your experience a bit less horrific.
 Get an excellent street map, and ride with another person. 
Traffic moves so lightning-fast that you don’t have time to think 
at intersections.
 For the most part, you must pay to park in Paris. Depending on the
neighborhood, expect to pay 1.80€ to 2.30€ ($2.35–$3) an hour for
a maximum of two hours. Place coins in the nearest meter, which
issues you a ticket to place on your dashboard. You can also buy
parking cards at the nearest tabac kiosk for meters that accept only
cards. Parking is free on Sundays, holidays, and for the entire month
of August.
 Drivers and passengers must wear seat belts. Children younger
than 12 must ride in the back seat. You are supposed to yield to a
car on the right unless signs indicate otherwise, as at traffic circles.
 If you want to rent a car to explore the Ile de France or travel on
from Paris, try Avis, Gare d’Austerlitz, arrivals gate,13e (% 01-45-
84-22-10; www.avis.com). A compact car, such as a Renault Megane,
that seats four runs about 64€ ($83) per day unlimited mileage
before tax. You can find the Hertz France office at Tare de l’Est, 10e
(% 01-42-05-50-43; www.hertz.com), where a compact car such as
an Opal Corsa costs about 92€ ($120) per day with limited mileage,
but with tax included.
 Watch for gendarmes (police officers), who lack patience and who
consistently contradict the traffic lights. Horn blowing is frowned
upon except in emergencies. Flash your headlights instead.
By bicycle
City planners have been trying to encourage more cycling by setting
aside 62 miles of bicycle lanes throughout Paris. The main routes run
north–south from the Bassin de La Villette along the Canal St-Martin
through the Left Bank and east–west from Château de Vincennes to the
Bois de Boulogne and its miles of bike lanes. The RATP (which runs the
city’s buses and subways), in partnership with the mayor’s office, rents
bikes through its Roue Libre program (www.rouelibre.fr). To rent a
bike, you need to leave a 200€ ($260) deposit per bike and show a pass-
port or driver’s license. Bike rentals are 9€ ($12) Monday through
Friday, 15€ ($18) Saturday and Sunday, and 32€ ($42) for eight days. A
Roue Libre location is at 1 passage Mondétour, in front of 120 de la rue
Rambuteau, 1er (% 08-10-44-15-34; Métro: Les Halles); it’s open daily 9
a.m. to 7 p.m. Roue Libre also offers three-hour guided tours of Paris in
English for 25€ ($33).

Where to Stay in Paris
Rooms in Paris tend to be smaller than you may expect, even in expen-
sive places (unless you opt for a modern chain hotel or such palaces as
the Ritz). Parisian doubles almost never are big enough to hold two
queen-size beds, and the space around the bed probably won’t be big
enough to put more than a desk and perhaps a chest of drawers.
Welcome to Europe; the story is the same in London, Rome, and most
other continental capitals where buildings date back two, three, or
sometimes four centuries, when dimensions — and people — were
smaller.
Parisian hotels also vary widely in plumbing arrangements. Some units
come with only a sink; others are equipped with a toilet and either a
shower or tub. Private bathrooms with tubs often have handheld shower
devices; pay attention to where you aim — shower curtains are a rarity.
Good news, though: The trend is upward these days; many small-hotel
renovations are putting a small shower, toilet, and sink in each room.
Acoustics also tend to be unpredictable in old Parisian hotels. Your
quarreling neighbors may be as annoying as street noise, so bring
earplugs or ask for a room at the rear of the hotel. Also, most budget
hotels in Paris do not have air-conditioning, but fortunately, their solid
stone walls tend to keep out the summer heat.
In compiling this list of hotels, we first considered the average traveler’s
wish list. And for most of you, that’s location. Thus, the first criterion,
though ruthless, was simple: If the hotel isn’t located in the first eight
arrondissements, it isn’t recommended in this book. To be sure of the
location of hotels you consider, see the “Paris Accommodations” map.
Prices for recommended hotels are designated with dollar signs — the
more you see, the more expensive the hotel. Check the chart on p. 3 in
the Introduction for an explanation of how the dollar-sign system works.

Familia Hôtel

Latin Quarter (5e)
In this hotel owned by the Gaucheron family, flowers spill out of window
boxes; the stone walls in some of the bedrooms have been painstakingly
restored or have had provincial-inspired wallpaper added. In other rooms,
artists from l’Ecole des Beaux-Arts (Paris’s best art school) have painted
sepia-toned murals of Parisian scenes. The cozy lobby exudes the atmos-
phere of a tiny castle with rich tapestries, a winding staircase, and fres-
coed walls. Some rooms have balconies (numbers 22, 23, 52, 53, 61, 62, 65)
with captivating views of the Latin Quarter. From the fifth and sixth floors,
you can see Notre-Dame. Bathrooms are small but modern and tiled. All
rooms have cable TV and hair dryers. The staff provides kid-friendly serv-
ices (such as bottle heating) and larger rooms for the weary traveler who
requests ahead. Take note that most rooms in the hotel are on the small
side, and the least expensive doubles in the corners are tiny. And with no
air-conditioning, it can get hot during Paris heat waves. Located on rue

can see classic cinema of both France and America). Rue des Ecoles boasts

What to do when every room seems full
If you arrive in Paris without a reservation — not something we strongly recommend —
you have two choices. You can pick up a phone and start dialing; that is, after you pur-
chase a phone card for public phones at the nearest tabac, a cafe or kiosk that sells
tobacco products. Or you can walk in to one of the branches of the Paris Convention
and Visitors Bureau and let the multilingual staff make you a reservation. The main
switchboard for any branch is % 08-92-68-30-00 (.35€ [45¢] per minute). Hotels with
unsold rooms offer them through the Paris Convention and Visitors Bureau at rock-
bottom prices, so you may get a three-star hotel at a two-star price. The staff will make
a reservation for you on the same day that you want a room, free of charge, but the
room must be paid for on a credit card or check card (which will act as a credit card
while in a foreign country).
Or walk into one of the following three branches where the staff will make a reserva-
tion for you while you wait (Note: These centers are closed on May 1):
 The Opéra-Grands-Magasins welcome center, 11 rue Scribe, 9e; open Monday
through Saturday 9 a.m. to 6:30 p.m. The main entryway is on the corner of a build-
ing. The center shares space with an American Express office; use the building’s
corner entrance and look for the AMERICAN EXPRESS sign on the door (Métro:
Chausée d’Antin La Fayette or Opéra; RER: Auber).
 The welcome kiosk beneath the modern glass roofed terminal of the Gare du Nord,
18 rue Dunkerque, 10e; open daily 8 a.m. to 6 p.m. (Métro and RER: Gare du Nord).
 The welcome kiosk at the Gare de Lyon, 20 bd. Diderot, 12e; open Monday through
Saturday 8 a.m. to 6 p.m. (Métro and RER: Gare de Lyon).

Grand Hôtel des Balcons
$$
St-Germain-des-Prés (6e)
Steps from Théâtre de l’Odéon is this gracious and comfortable hotel with
balconied rooms, modern light oak furnishings, bright fabrics, 19th-cen-
tury stained-glass windows, and Art Nouveau lobby furnishings (look for
the voluptuous statue of Venus in the breakfast room). Although most
rooms and their wrought-iron balconies are small, clever use of space
allows for large closets and full-length mirrors. Bathrooms are also small
but well designed and come equipped with a clothesline. The higher-
priced doubles, triples, and quads are big and luxurious; some have
double-sink bathrooms. All rooms have satellite television and Internet
access. If you’re celebrating your birthday while in Paris, treat yourself to
a stay here; the sumptuous and filling breakfast buffet (which includes
sausage and eggs) is free for the birthday boy or girl. The Jardin du
Luxembourg is a five-minute walk south.

Grand Hôtel de Suez
$–$$
Latin Quarter (5e)
Guests return for this hotel’s 49 good-sized rooms at great prices in a great
Latin Quarter location. Beds are firm, storage space is ample, and the
modern bathrooms have hair dryers. Décor is typical modern hotel: a com-
fortable mirrored lobby furnished with couches and Art Nouveau lamps,
rooms with striped or flowered bedspreads and curtains with color-coor-
dinated artwork and blonde furniture. Each room has satellite TV with 30
channels and Wi-Fi is available throughout the whole building. But you
may want to keep the windows to the street-side balconies shut — the
Boulevard St-Michel can be very noisy way past midnight on weekends.
The hotel is near Musée de Cluny, Jardin du Luxembourg, and the
Panthéon. The Seine and Notre-Dame are a ten-minute walk away. You can
find a high-speed Internet access terminal in the salon.

Hôtel Agora
$–$$
Louvre (1er)
Don’t worry about the ugly entryway here; it’s a disguise for a very good
find. This two-star hotel on a busy pedestrian street near Les Halles has a
traditional French air once you mount a curved staircase (after the initial
climb an elevator leads from reception to upper floors) to its eclectic
reception area. Rooms have antique furniture, marble mantelpieces, floral
prints, and old-fashioned wallpapers. The windows are double-glazed,
thankfully, which helps muffle the outside noise. The bathrooms are of a
decent size, some have bathtubs and even bidets (an often confusing
French charm which is rarely offered at hotels with such reasonable
prices). Fifth-floor rooms have balconies with views of the impressive St-
Eustache Church.

Hôtel Alison

Madeleine (8e)
Located between the Madeleine and the Elysée Palace and near the
Champs-Elysées and rue Faubourg St-Honoré, this hotel has a retro 1970s
ambience that somehow manages to be perfectly in tune with the classy
neighborhood. The large, well-appointed rooms are furnished in modern
style, with black furniture and light walls; in-room amenities include plenty
of storage space, a safe, minibar, trouser press, satellite TV, Internet
access, and double-glazed windows. Hair dryers and Roger & Gallet toi-
letries grace gleaming, tiled bathrooms with wall-mounted showers. You
can relax on couches in the plush lobby or enjoy a drink in the vaulted
brick lounge. Breakfast is served under a vaulted stone ceiling, a signature
of historical Parisian buildings.

Hôtel Claude-Bernard

Latin Quarter (5e)
This highly recommended hotel keeps very high standards and wins much
repeat business. The red exterior is chic without pretension; inside fea-
tures a lobby bar (you have to ask at reception if you want to be served),
a lounge area with comfortable chairs, and a two-person elevator. The
decent size rooms have warm and tasteful wallpaper, sleek bathrooms,
minibars, Wi-Fi, satellite TV, decorative balconies with flowers, and often
a well-preserved piece of antique furniture. Some particularly attractive
suites come with couches and armchairs. A sauna is available for guests

Hôtel de Fleurie
$$–$$$
St-Germain-des-Prés (6e)
Just off place Odéon on a pretty side street, the Fleurie has all the com-
forts, including air-conditioning, marble bathrooms with heated towel
racks, quality toiletries, Oriental carpets, high-speed Internet connections,
and satellite TV. The jewel-toned rooms are small but comfortable, and all
are furnished in a modern or classic style with such touches as fresh flowers,
pretty gingham curtains, and wood-paneled accents. Book at least six
weeks in advance for one of the chambres familiales — two connecting
rooms with two large beds in each room. A continental breakfast is served
in the cozy vaulted stone cellar dining room. The superb location near the
church of St-Germain-des-Prés, the historic Café de Flore, Café les Deux
Magots, and Brasserie Lipp, can’t be beat; and it’s just a few blocks from
the Seine and the Jardin du Luxembourg. Check the Web site for specials,

Hôtel de l’Abbaye
$$$
St-Germain-des-Prés (6e)
This former convent is one of the Left Bank’s most delightful and cozy
hotels — a popular stop for travelers who have a taste for chic surround-
ings on a budget. You enter through a courtyard and check in at the recep-
tion desk, which is in the convent’s original vault. Some of the rooms have
their original oak ceiling beams, and all are air-conditioned and have 19th-
century-style furnishings and damask upholstery. The standard rooms are
a good size for Paris, and the duplex suites are spacious. Some first-floor
rooms open out onto a vine-covered terrace. Rooftop suites have terraces.
In summer, you can have breakfast — included in the price of your room —
in the flower-filled courtyard; in winter, you can lounge in front of the lobby
fireplace.

Hôtel de la Place des Vosges
$$
Le Marais (4e)
The entrance to the place des Vosges is only steps away from this hotel
which used to be the stables of King Henri IV. Now the exposed stone walls
and beamed ceilings complement a plush, antiques-filled lobby. Each of
the small guest rooms has been renovated within the last two years and
boasts beamed ceilings, satiny sheets, and tiled bathrooms; other in-room
amenities include satellite TV and Wi-Fi. Breakfast can be served in you
room (if desired). The larger top-floor room (no. 10) has a pretty view over
the Right Bank and a Jacuzzi, but the elevator stops a floor down, some-
thing to consider if you travel with a lot of luggage.

Hôtel de L’Elysée
$$$
Champs-Elysées (8e)
Wallpaper of stamped 18th-century etchings, built-in closets, half-head-
boards and stuccoed ceilings are just some of the Restoration touches
added to this hotel during a recent renovation. The wonderful, but small
mansard suite no. 60 features wood beams overhead and skylights set into
the low, sloping ceilings that provide peek-a-boo vistas of Parisian
rooftops, including a perfectly framed view of the Eiffel Tower. All fifth- and
sixth-floor rooms enjoy at least rooftop views, the former from small bal-
conies (nos. 50–53 offer glimpses of the Eiffel Tower).

Hôtel des Deux-Iles
$$
Ile St-Louis (4e)
This appealing jewel box of a hotel is superbly located on the Ile St-Louis,
practically in Notre-Dame’s backyard. The owners are interior decorators,
and it shows; the 17 rooms have exposed oak ceiling beams and provin-
cial upholstery, and the lobby is a warm and cozy gem with fresh flowers
and bamboo furniture. Off the lobby is a garden that some of the rooms
overlook and a basement breakfast room with a fireplace. Although ameni-
ties include bathrooms, hair dryers, cable TV, Wi-Fi and air-conditioning,
rooms run from tiny to small, so if you have a large amount of luggage, you
may want to look elsewhere. Paris’s best ice cream shop, Berthillon
(closed in Aug), is just around the corner, and you can find Berthillon ice
cream in nearby brasseries, too. So much is nearby — the Memorial de la
Déportation, which commemorates the French Jews sent to Auschwitz;

Ste-Chapelle; the Conciergerie; and the bird and flower markets on Ile de
la Cité, to name only a few — you may not know where to begin. Hint: Start

Hôtel du Champ de Mars

Tour Eiffel (7e)
A country house tucked away on a colorful street near Tour Eiffel, the
Champ de Mars is a bargain that’s hard to beat. Its 20 rooms have flowing
curtains, fabric-covered headboards, throw pillows, and cushioned high-
backed seats. Bathrooms are in mint condition with hair dryers, large
towels, and good lighting, and those with tubs have wall-mounted showers.
A cozy breakfast room is in the remodeled basement. Reserve at least four
months in advance. In the summer, the best two rooms are on the ground
floor and open onto the leafy courtyard; they stay cool despite the lack of
air-conditioning. A Franprix grocery store is two doors down.

Hôtel du Vieux Saule
$$
Le Marais/Bastille (3e)
This hotel in the Marais near place de la République offers not only air-
conditioning but a free sauna, too. Ironic, perhaps, considering the giant
display of cacti and other desert plants in the lobby — a welcome, unique
feel compared to other Paris hotels. The cheerful, but small, rooms have
tiled bathrooms, hair dryers, safes, double-glazed windows, luggage racks,
Wi-Fi, satellite TV, trouser presses, and even small irons and ironing
boards. The rooms on the fifth floor tend to be bigger. Breakfast is a buffet
served in the original 16th-century, cozy vaulted cellar accessed by a wind-
ing staircase (no elevator). Check online for promotions.

Hôtel Esmeralda

Latin Quarter (5e)
The Esmerelda is offbeat and ramshackle with creaky wood floors and
cramped hallways (and even dusty in some places), but its superior loca-
tion steps from the Seine and Notre-Dame and its prices — a budget trav-
eler’s dream — make this a favorite of many travelers, and you may have

to book as far in advance as three months. It may not be good for you, how-
ever, if you crave amenities such as satellite TV and space or if you might
have trouble maneuvering an old, winding wooden staircase (there’s no
elevator). The front rooms (make sure to specify when you reserve) offer
outstanding views of Notre-Dame and the Seine while East rooms overlook
St-Julien-le-Pauvre and square Viviani. Shabby-chic velvet coverings and
antique furniture create a homey warmth that almost makes up for the dis-
appointingly dark rear rooms. The front rooms with a view have modern
bathrooms with tubs, and some are exceptionally large for the location
and relative size of this hotel, making them perfect for travelers with children.

Hôtel Henri IV
$
Louvre (1er)
This place is old. It doesn’t have an elevator; only five rooms have showers
or tubs, only two have toilets, and none have phones. The stairs are
creaky, and no matter how old you may be, this place will make you feel
young in comparison. But this super-budget hotel is one of Europe’s most
famous and nearly always is full. It occupies a dramatic location on place
Dauphine — the northernmost tip of Ile de la Cité, across the river from St-
Germain and the Louvre and a few steps from pont Neuf. The 17th-century
building houses cozy rooms that are past their prime, though many find
them romantically evocative (others think they’re just rundown). Each
room has a sink, but guests share the spotless toilets and showers on each
of the five floors. One of the communal bathrooms has an enormous tub,
and a few rooms have beautiful views of place Dauphine. All in all, staying
here is an adventure. Book far in advance.

Hôtel Jeanne d’Arc

Le Marais (4e)
Reserve well in advance for this great budget hotel on a pretty little street
just off the place St-Catherine. The outside facade has classically beauti-
ful Parisian lanterns to light the way in. Full of eccentric furniture and
countryside touches, the managers insist that it is unique among Parisian
hotels. Soft tangerine colored wallpaper decorates the halls of the ground
floor, except for the fresh white dining area with billowing white curtains
and the blue sitting area directly down the hall from the entrance.
Reception is through a door on the right where I was delighted to see hang-
ing on the wall the hotel’s signature mosaic mirror tribute to French pride.
Chapter 11: Settling into Paris, City of Light 143

Rooms are small to decent-sized with large windows, card-key access, and
large bathrooms, but storage space is a bit cramped. Other room features
include direct-dial telephones, cable TV, and bedside tables. If a view is
important, make sure you request one because some rooms don’t have
one. The hotel is in the center of the Marais, and it can be a little noisy,
but you’re near the Musée Picasso, place des Vosges, and the Bastille, and
the fabulous Au Bistro de la Place cafe is in the square next door.

Located just steps behind Les Invalides, this wonderful restored mansion
can be addictive. It boasts a four-star rating: You receive almost all the
amenities of a pricier hotel — Roger & Gallet toiletries, hair dryer, air-
conditioning, chic décor with antiques — for rates miraculously below
four-star prices. Rooms are decorated in soft yellows, pink, or sand, with
crisp white damask upholsteries, antique bureaus and lamps, fabulously
mismatched old mirrors, and marble bathrooms. Rooms also have satellite
TV and 24-hour room service. You may want to ask for one of the four mag-
nificent rooms with walk-out vine-draped terraces or a junior suite with
whirlpool bath. The staff is wonderfully helpful and polite. A grocery store
a few doors down is open until 10 p.m., and a tabac is right next door.

Hôtel Louvre Forum

Louvre (1er)
For a truly central, reasonably priced hotel just steps from the Louvre, it’s
difficult to beat this comfortable modern hotel. The brightly colored
rooms have tiled bathrooms (with hair dryers) and furniture including
writing tables and a small armoire with hanging space and shelves. (Rooms
on the lower floors are a bit cramped.) Service is a bit chilly, but it’s a small
price for such a great location. The hotel is only a short walk from the el-
egant Jardin du Palais Royal.

Hôtel Louvre Richelieu
$
Louvre (1er)
This is a very basic hotel with good-sized rooms and a great location —
halfway between the Louvre and the Opéra, but without that touristy hustle-
and-bustle. Enter through a corridor with restored stone walls; the pleasant
reception area, with helpful staff, and the lobby are on the second floor. The
two-bed double rooms are dark, but spacious with high ceilings; we think
it’s worth the extra 12€ ($10) for a private bathroom. Each room has a writ-
ing table and a small closet. The lack of an elevator here means that you
may want to book elsewhere if you’re loaded down with luggage. Reserve
at least two weeks in advance for summer. A bakery is right next door.

Hôtel Marignan
$
Latin Quarter (5e)
Manager Paul Keniger is proud to tell you that he is the third generation
of his family to care for this very warm establishment, which opened in
the ’30s. The owners welcome families, don’t mind if you bring your own
food into the dining room, and even make the kitchen available during the
low season. You also have a washer/dryer and iron at your disposal. Signs
in English recommend neighborhoods to visit and tours to take, and you
can always ask one of the Kenigers for recommendations. The hotel is very
close to the Sorbonne — it’s around the corner from the Panthéon, near
the outdoor green market on rue Mouffetard — and its good rates attract
students. The Marignan maintains one of the best organized Web sites for
a hotel we’ve seen; check it out for individual floor plans of each room, as
well as the ever-present promotions. Rooms fill up quickly in July and
August, so if you plan to travel then, book well in advance.

Hôtel Minerve
$–$$
Latin Quarter (5e)
The owners of the Familia Hôtel (reviewed earlier in this section), Eric and
Sylvie Gaucheron, also own this more upscale residence. Rooms are larger
and have wood-beamed ceilings, exposed stone walls, carved mahogany
wood furnishings, and expensive wallpaper (the quality decorations, some
of which have been more recently renovated are amusingly described as
“materiaux nobles,” or “noble materials”). Pretty hand-painted sepia frescos
can be found in several of the rooms, as well as provincial fabrics. All have
modern bathrooms with hair dryers, satellite TVs, Internet access via Wi-Fi,
and air-conditioning. Ten rooms have large balconies with a table and chairs
overlooking the street. The Minerve is as welcoming to kids as the Familia.
If you’re craving an American breakfast, head just a few blocks down to the
delicious fare at Breakfast in America at 73 rue des Ecoles. The Minerve
offers airport transportation using Parishuttle, a van-transportation serv-
ice. Visit the Web site (www.parishuttle.com) or contact the hotel for
details.

The big splurge
If you want only the best, plushest hotels Paris has to offer, look no further. These
hotels give you more than a room — they give you an experience. Service is impec-
cable, décor features quality to the last antique knickknack, and rooms are enormous
compared to the typical European standard. The hotel’s restaurant may be overseen
by a renowned chef, and the fare often is excellent and pricey. Usually a spa, fitness
center, and/or pool are available for guests. These hotels do everything with more
style than their less-expensive counterparts, which is why they play host to many
celebrities.

Hôtel Montpensier
$
Louvre (1er)
Supposedly the former residence of Mademoiselle de Montpensier, cousin
of Louis XIV, this hotel’s high ceilings and windows, the stained-glass ceil-
ing in its lounge, and its grand staircase create a sense of faded grandeur.
Many rooms on the first two floors, which date from the 17th century, are
either drab or have a faded elegance (depending on your point of view),
while rooms on the fifth floor (an elevator is available) have attractive
slanted ceilings and good views over the rooftops. They are smaller than
the first and second floor rooms, but all the room sizes here are impressive
given the rates. Most rooms are comfortably outfitted with easy chairs,
ample closet space, and modern bathrooms with hair dryers. Reserve at
least a month in advance for July. The prices are terrific for this location,
just 2 blocks from the Jardin du Palais Royal and right down the street from
the Louvre and the Jardin des Tuileries. In August 2006, there were many
Web-only promotions for a few euros off the price of rooms.

full bath; 137€–149€ ($178–$194) quad with full bath.
Hôtel Prince
$
Tour Eiffel (7e)
Just a ten-minute walk from the Tour Eiffel, the Prince is a good value for
the location. Its rooms are modern and soundproofed and have exposed-
brick walls, matching curtains and bedspreads, and big bathrooms with
fluffy towels. Though they vary in size, all units are pleasant, comfortable,
and well kept with double-glazed windows, luggage racks, TVs, minifridges,
and ample closets; some have hair dryers and safes. Not all rooms come
with a full bathroom; if it’s important to you, ask. A ground-floor room is
available with facilities for travelers with disabilities. If you’re too worn
out from sightseeing to stagger out the door to the two downstairs cafes
(not part of the hotel), the hotel manager will arrange for a local restaurant
to deliver a meal.

Hôtel St-Jacques
$$
Latin Quarter (5e)
This building was designed by Baron Haussmann (architect of modern
Paris and its grand boulevards) and has been beautifully preserved.
Several of its 35 rooms have restored 19th-century ceiling murals, and
most of the high ceilings have elaborate plasterwork, giving the décor an
old-Paris feel that is accentuated by traditional furniture and fabric-covered
walls. The owners have added their own touches in the hallways, with
stenciling on the walls and trompe l’oeil painting around the doors and
walls and ceiling murals in the breakfast room and lounge. Modern com-
forts include generally spacious rooms, an elevator, immaculate tiled bath-
rooms with hair dryers and toiletries, double-glazed windows, ample
closet space, fax and computer outlets, safes, and satellite TV. Although
they aren’t accessible by elevator (which stops a floor down), the rooms
on the top floor are less expensive and have great views (be sure to ask for
them specifically). The hotel is in a good location near the Sorbonne,
Panthéon, and the Musée de Cluny, and a short walk from boulevard St-
Germain, boulevard St-Michel, and rue Mouffetard.

DC, MC, V.
Hôtel St-Merry
$$–$$$
Le Marais (4e)
The prices have not changed in several years at this Gothic hotel to the
delight of regular visitors, but don’t worry — the service is as good as ever!
Located on a pedestrian-only street in the Marais, the hotel was formerly
the 17th-century presbytery of the Church of St-Merry next door (and was
once a brothel as well), and it retains a medieval atmosphere. Beds have
wood screens for headboards, except for Room 9, in which the bed has
flying buttresses on either side (easy to trip over in the dark, but original,
nonetheless!) that make you feel as if you’re sleeping in Notre-Dame. The
rooms are dark with beamed ceilings, stone walls, wrought-iron chande-
liers, sconces, and candelabras. Fabrics are sumptuous; rugs are Oriental;
and bathrooms are pleasantly modern, fully tiled, and equipped with hair
dryers. Staff is very helpful and friendly. Higher prices are for larger rooms
with views. In keeping with its medieval-church-like feeling, the phone in
the lobby is in a confessional, and you won’t find an elevator in the build-
ing. TVs are in suites only. The hotel location is a few short blocks from
the Seine and Hôtel de Ville, and the Louvre is about a 15-minute walk
down nearby rue de Rivoli.
See map p. 136. 78 rue de la Verrerie. % 01-42-78-14-15. Fax: 01-40-29-06-82. www.
hotelmarais.com (for booking only). Métro: Hôtel-de-Ville or Châtelet. Rack rates:
160€–230€ ($208–$299) double or room with twin beds; 205€–275€ ($267–$358)
triple; 335€–407€ ($436–$529) suites. In-room breakfast: 11€ ($14). AE, V.

Hôtel des Saints-Pères
$$
St-Germain-des-Prés (6e)
The late poet Edna St. Vincent Millay loved the garden filled with camellias,
and travelers make this romantic hotel one of the Left Bank’s most popu-
lar. Designed in the 17th century by Louis XIV’s architect, the hotel is fur-
nished with antiques, old paintings, tapestries, and gilt mirrors, but its 39
rooms have modern amenities such as TVs and minibars. The most
requested room is the chambre à la fresque, which has a 17th-century
painted ceiling. Breakfast is served in the garden in good weather. The hotel
is a stone’s throw from Brasserie Lipp, Café de Flore, and the Deux-Magots.

280€ ($364) duplex with twin beds; 295€ ($384) suite; and 345€ ($449) for la cham-
bre à la fresque. Rates include breakfast. AE, MC, V.
Hôtel Vivienne
$
Louvre/Opéra (2e)
Hôtel Vivienne is well located between the Louvre and the Opéra and
offers comfortable rooms at a good price. Accommodations are simply
decorated and very clean, are updated every year; they come with satel-
lite TV and Internet access. They have the traditional molding found in
classic Parisian apartments; and have soundproofing, something lacking in
most Parisian apartments. The bathrooms vary in size from adequate to
huge, and all have hair dryers and wall-mounted showers in the tubs. Some
of the rooms have adjoining doors, perfect for families; others have small
terraces. A few have views of the Eiffel Tower. The staff is extremely warm
and welcoming. Before venturing from the neighborhood, explore the
Galeries Vivienne and Colbert, gorgeous historic covered passageways
with pretty shops, intimate restaurants, and art galleries. There’s an
entrance at 6 rue Vivienne down the street.

room. MC, V.

memory long after the dishes are cleared away. But who can eat multi-
course meals twice a day for days on end? So we also list cafes, tea-
rooms, wine bars, and sandwich shops for when you’re in the mood 
for a lighter bite.
The list here concentrates on moderately priced establishments from
homelike neighborhood favorites to chic “in” spots. Also included are
some bargain eateries and a few of the city’s most sumptuous restau-
rants where haute cuisine is an art form. For locations, check out the
nearby “Paris Dining” map.
Restaurants are listed alphabetically for easy reference, followed by
price range, neighborhood, and type of cuisine. Price ranges reflect the
cost of a three-course meal for one person ordered a la carte featuring
an appetizer, main dish, dessert, and coffee. (See the Introduction of this
book for more about price ranges.)
Don’t make price your only criteria for choosing a restaurant. Most
establishments offer fixed-price menus (also called formules or prix fixe)
that can bring the cost down one whole price category. Also, if you’re
eager to try a place that’s above your budget, visit it at lunch, when
meals are cheaper.
The top restaurants
Auberge de Jarente
$$$
Le Marais (4e)
BASQUE
When you’ve had enough of cream sauces, come here for the taste of south-
west France, where cooks use olive oil, tomatoes, and all kinds of peppers.
While the management has changed since the place opened in 1964, the
Basque genius has not. The 30€ ($36) prix fixe menu may include starters of
timbale de calamars and chorizo (calamari and chorizo sausage cooked in a
molded pan), or escargot in a thick soup of sea salt and puréed vegetables—
snails so fresh you can crunch on the sand, or try l’escalope de saumon au
piment d’espelette (salmon cutlet spiced with Basque hot pepper), and for a
main course, such Basque-influenced dishes as sliced duck breast in a barely
sweet honey-lemon sauce, served with potatoes. Top it off with a massive
crème brûlée and sheep’s cheese with jam. Order this menu because a half-
bottle of wine is included — this is rare! Choose from smooth Basque wines
such as Irrouleguy and Madiran. The rustic décor includes a cavelike, cozy
downstairs, and service is downright familial.
See map p. 150. 7 rue de Jarente (between rue de Sevigné and rue de Turenne, just
west of place des Vosges). % 01-42-77-49-35. Métro: Bastille or St-Paul. (Take rue
de Turenne and follow it 1 block to rue de Jarente.) Prix fixe: 30€ ($39). AE, V. Open:
Tues–Sat noon–2:30 p.m. and 7:30–11 p.m.
Part III: Paris and the Best of the Ile de France

Au Bon Accueil
$–$$$$
Tour Eiffel (7e)
MODERN BISTRO
The menu here changes daily according to what owner Jacques Lacipière
finds in the markets. If you’re ordering from the prix fixe menu, you may
start with filets de sardines mi-cuites à l’huile et romarin méli mélo de
legumes provencaux (sardines lightly grilled in oil with a blend of vegeta-
bles from Provence) followed by steak de thon poélé et son caviar
d’aubergine aux olives (seared tuna steak with eggplant “caviar” and olives).
Main dishes are divine and can include rognon de veau au vin (veal kidney
in a red wine sauce) or whole lobster from Brittany roasted in herbs and
tomatoes. Fantastic desserts include fig tart and crème brûlée made with
walnuts. The dining room only seats 25, so reserve in advance.
See map p. 150. 14 rue de Monttessuy. % 01-47-05-46-11. Métro: Alma Marceau.
(Exit the station, cross the Pont l’Alma and the quai Branly, and turn onto av. Rapp;
follow av. Rapp 2 blocks to rue de Monttessuy and turn right.) Reservations strongly
recommended. Main courses: 15€–52€ ($20–$68); three-course prix fixe 27€ ($35).
MC, V. Open: Mon–Fri noon–2:30 p.m. and 7:30–10:30 p.m.
Au Pied de Cochon
$–$$$
Les Halles (1er)
CLASSIC FRENCH
Halles opened in 1946 and has played a vibrant part of the history of this
old market neighborhood. With marble, murals, elaborate sconces, chan-
deliers, and plenty of tourists, the restaurant provides great fun at man-
ageable prices. The waitstaff is exceptionally friendly and open. You can
have a goat cheese and tomato millefeuille (thin-layered pastry dough) or
onion soup to start. Follow with grilled salmon with two kinds of rice or an
entrecôte maître d’hôtel (rib steak in a rich red wine sauce) or their spe-
cialty and namesake, pied de cochon (pigs’ feet). Or, if you’re daring — and
hungry — have the plateau rouge: half a Canadian lobster, crayfish, shrimp,
crabs, and other red fish served on a towering pile of shaved ice. Finish
with mouth-watering profiteroles (cream puffs).
See map p. 150. 6 rue Coquillière (between rue du Jour and rue Jean-Jacques
Rousseau on the northwest side of the garden of the Forum des Halles shopping
center). % 01-40-13-77-00. Métro: Châtelet–Les Halles. Main courses: 14€–30€
($18–$39). AE, DC, V. Open: Daily 24 hours.
Au Poulbot Gourmet
$$$
Montmartre (18e)
CLASSIC FRENCH
Photos of old Montmartre and original drawings by illustrator Francisque
Poulbot adorn the walls, and chic burgundy leather banquettes usually are
filled with a local crowd savoring moderately priced classic cuisine. Chef
Jean-Paul Langevin brings tremendous finesse to the preparation and pres-
entation of dishes such as noisette d’agneau (lamb slices), served with deli-
cate splashes of mashed potatoes and spinach, and marmite de poissons,
assorted fresh fish in a light saffron sauce. Desserts are made on the prem-
ises and have a tendency to change often, however you can count on a
Chapter 11: Settling into Paris, City of Light 153

moelleux aux chocolat (chocolate cake with a wonderfully liquid center)
served with an orange puree, or a light custard cream. The coulis de fruits
rouges (red fruit purée) is also very refreshing during summertime.
See map p. 150. 39 rue Lamarck. % 01-46-06-86-00. Métro: Lamarck-Caulincourt.
(Follow rue Lamarck from Sacré-Coeur; the restaurant is about a third of the way
down the hill.) Three-course lunch (Mon–Fri) 18€ ($23); three-course dinner 35€
($46). MC, V. Open: Mon–Sat noon–1:30 p.m. and 7:30–10 p.m.; Oct–May lunch served
Sun noon–1:30 p.m.
Bofinger
$$
Le Marais (4e)
ALSATIAN/BRASSERIE
Though Bofinger is owned by the Flo brasserie chain, which means you’ll
see similar menus in the chain’s other restaurants, this is still one of Paris’s
best-loved restaurants. Dark wood, gleaming brass, bright lights, curved
and painted glass ceiling, and waiters with long white aprons delivering
good food all make dining here a wonderful experience. The downstairs
dining room is ornately decorated with Art Nouveau flourishes and a glass-
domed ceiling. Upstairs is cozier with wood paneling and separate rooms
for smokers. The 24€ ($31) lunch menu may feature Brittany oysters to
start, Langoustine royale (king crayfish) roasted with olive oil and herbs
and accompanies by mashed potatoes garnished with fleur de sel (salt
flower), and floating island (soft custard with mounds of beaten egg whites
or whipped cream floating on its surface) for dessert. The 30€ ($39) Ménu
Bofinger may start with homemade duck foie gras, breast of chicken
served Suprème style (in a white gravy with cream) and a cherry clafoutis
(a baked pancake with cherries). We suggest the jumbo shrimp fried with
anis seed, served with zucchini and saffron risotto. The restaurant is
renowned for its oysters and foie gras. Best of all: The prices are actually
quite moderate for Paris. Children younger than 12 can get the prix fixe
for 14€ ($18). The more intimate Le Petit Bofinger is directly across the
street; prices and fare are similar.
See map p. 150. 5–7 rue de la Bastille. % 01-42-72-87-82. Métro: Bastille. (Exit the
station at bd. Beaumarchais and turn left at rue de la Bastille.) Main courses:
14€–39€ ($18–$51); lunch and dinner prix fixe only on weekdays 24€ ($31) and 31€
($40), respectively (there is also a faim de nuit [night hunger] menu, which is the same
price as the first menu, offering a starter and entree after 11 p.m.). AE, MC, V. Open:
Daily noon–1 a.m.
Brasserie Balzar
$–$$
Latin Quarter (5e)
ALSATIAN/BRASSERIE
Brasserie Balzar is always full of rich yuppies, even during off hours. The
brasserie was the center of a controversy a few years ago when a group of
regulars, including Adam Gopnik of the New Yorker, fought but ultimately
failed to keep the Flo chain from buying it (see Mr. Gopnik’s account in
Paris to the Moon, Random House). Nothing obvious has changed, how-
ever. People still stop into this brasserie that opened in 1898 for coffee and
pastries between lunch and dinner and drop in for drinks in the evening.

Regulars go for such hearty French classics as poulet rôti avec frites (roast
chicken with french fries) or choucroute garni (sauerkraut garnished with
cuts of meat [usually ham]) but you can also get a good foie de veau (veal
liver), steak au poivre (steak with crushed peppercorns), and a few fresh
fish dishes. Portions are copious, French fries are parfait, crunchy and with
just enough salt.

Ile St-Louis (1er)
ALSATIAN/BRASSERIE
Brasserie Ile St-Louis is always loud and bustling, even though the food is
not all that it used to be (but the sauerkraut is pretty good). Still, it will
leave you feeling full and satisfied. So if their true-to-tradition brasserie
food (from the Alsace region of Eastern France) doesn’t completely sat-
isfy, the location will: directly off the footbridge from Ile de la Cité to Ile St-
Louis with an unparalleled view of the eastern tip of Ile de la Cité (including
the back of Notre-Dame). The food is quintessentially Alsatian, including
choucroute (heaps of tender, biting sauerkraut and meaty slices of ham);
the hearty cassoulet, laden with rich beans and tender pieces of lamb and
pork; and ham shank atop a bed of lentils.

Louvre/Ile de la Cité (1er)
CLASSIC FRENCH
Located in the heart of the charming, tree-lined place Dauphine, a secluded
little park nestled at the tip of Ile de la Cité, is this pretty little restaurant
serving excellent food at reasonable prices. Try the house’s special côte
de boeuf, grilled giant ribs prepared for two. The confit de canard et
pommes Sarladaise, duck served with crispy potato bits sautéed in foie
gras drippings, is another enticing dish. Have a look at the original art on
the walls; the owners display the work of up-and-coming artists.

AUVERGNE
The door normally “moos” for arriving and departing customers — this
summer, during mid-July, the cow was mostly likely on vacation, like every-
one else. Don’t be surprised by any other wildlife noises, such as birds,
crickets, babbling brooks, or even the (albeit slow) movements of the
restaurant’s enormous and affectionate black cat. There’s a high-walled
Chapter 11: Settling into Paris, City of Light 155

backyard garden that children will love, and parents can appreciate an
atmosphere that literally reeks of the Auvergne, the rugged south-central
region of France. (The area by the cash register sells products from the
region including tiny bottles of essential oils made from native plants and
wines.) The delicious peasant food is presented in good-sized portions,
and appetizers may include a torte aux poireaux gratinée (leek torte topped
with breadcrumbs) or oeuf pochés à la fourme d’Ambert (poached eggs
with regional cheese). Main courses include a tender magret de canard au
miel de Montagne et à la fleur de thym (duck filet cooked in mountain honey
and thyme blossom) or a truffade (a casserole of thinly sliced potatoes
cooked in cream, with smoked ham in the center). Although most dishes
use ham or pork, vegetarians (though not vegans) enjoy the delicious
croustade forestière Julia: assorted mushrooms and eggs poached with
Fourme d’Ambert cheese. The best Auvergne wine is the Chateaugay, a
fine fruity red. The restaurant is a block from the Panthéon.

Gare du Nord (10e)
CLASSIC FRENCH
Book well in advance for this restaurant far from the more touristy sides
of Paris, which packs in loyal customers. It’s on the same street as another
restaurant well worth the trip, Chez Michel (reviewed below). Chef
Philippe Tredgeu works magic in his kitchen, cooking with ingredients he
finds at the market that morning or the night before. The cuisse de lapin
aux jus avec pommes de terres sautées aux sorrells (leg of rabbit cooked in
its own juices with potatoes sautéed in sorrel leaf) is fantastic, and the tete
de veau is a French comfort-food classic (meat from the head and neck
region of a young calf). For dessert, indulge in clafoutis aux prunes rouges
(baked pancake with red plums). The wine list is highly affordable with
prices starting at 7.50€ ($9) for half a bottle.

Montmartre (18e)
CLASSIC FRENCH
At the base of the steps heading to the Place de Tertre, you can find some
of the cheapest eats in this neighborhood, which is not exactly known for

they welcome children in their humbly decorated cozy dining room with
wood benches, red and white picnic tablecloths, and wallpaper in the style

BRETON
Crowds of Parisians come here for excellent, unusual food at very fair
prices. Look for succulent scallops, hand picked by scuba divers, served
with truffles in the winter. The menu may include crème d’homard Bréton
(cream of lobster soup topped with shaved Parmesan cheese) or beef
cheeks served atop a ficelle (small, thin baguette) with fresh young veg-
etables, or it may venture South to Nîmes with such local specialties as a
brandade de morue legerment gratinée au parmesan, or a salt-cod casse-
role, baked lightly with Parmesan cheese. A nougat ice cream with spiced
honey and thin almond cookies makes a satisfying dessert (ask if they have
kouign amann, a Breton pastry made of layers of brioche dough, butter,
and caramelized sugar). You can choose to sit in the more casual cellar at
wooden tables and eat all the shellfish, pâtés, and salads you can fit into
your stomach — which we guarantee will be stretched by the end of the
night! Choose from more than 100 different wines at retail cost, a truly

creations may include starters of Paimpol coco beans prepared in poached

eggplant layered pastry with tomato and ricotta cheese. Main dishes may
include roast quail in its own juices, served with a mushroom and
Reggiano Parmesan risotto, or a thick, grilled tuna steak served with wok-

La Cigale allows for elegant outdoor dining during the warm weather.
Serving its delicious soufflés (among other specialties) to a sophisticated
clientele, the food is simply some of the best you can get in Paris for these
prices. The delicate soufflés are beaten high and brim with Camembert or
tarragon cream. Try the Henri IV with regional cheese and a sauce volaille
(chicken gravy), one made of goat cheese and fresh artichoke, or perhaps
Camembert and morels, a seasonal luxury. If you’re not in the mood for a
soufflé, other tempting entrées include steak au poivre (steak with
coarsely ground peppercorns) or filet de dorade (filet of sea bream). For
dessert try — you got it! — a soufflé made with, among other things, pis-
tachios or melt-in-your-mouth chocolate (with a chocolate fondue!) or
Grand Marnier or almonds with rhubarb marmalade.

HAUTE CUISINE
This gorgeous, three-Michelin-starred, spare-no-expense restaurant
located in a 17th-century town house is one of the best in France. It counts
among its diners former U. S. President Bill Clinton, who ate here as a guest
of Jacques Chirac. Chef Bernard Pacaud creates exquisite food with an
emphasis on perfection. Served in two mirrored and frescoed high-
ceilinged dining rooms and a cozy back room (in summer there is an out-
door terrace), the seasonal specialties may include an anise-flavored cold
fennel soup with crawfish, or young preserved pigeon stuffed with savory
leaves. For dessert, try Pacaud’s tarte fine, which has won awards: It’s a
chocolate pie served with bitter chocolate and mocha ice cream. If you
don’t like chocolate, opt for another cold soup, such as one made from
local white peaches and accompanied by pain de genes, a spectacular
almond poundcake. If you can afford it, this restaurant just begs to be the
setting for marriage proposals, anniversaries, and other special and
romantic events.

La Poule au Pot

Les Halles (1er)
CLASSIC BISTRO
When Les Halles still was Paris’s marketplace, its workers came to La Poule
au Pot to share this signature dish, an old French recipe of chicken stewed
with broth and vegetables, which has been served here since 1935 (in 2006
they celebrated their 71st birthday with a reduced-price menu) with much
success if the livre d’or (a gold book filled with the names of visiting
celebrities) means anything. After the market’s demise, visits from such
celebrities as Maurice Chevalier, Miou Miou, the Rolling Stones, and Prince
kept this Parisian bistro on the map. The atmosphere created by the long
zinc bar, pots of wine, red leather banquettes, wood paneling, and waiters
in long aprons transports you to another era. How can the menu serve any-
thing other than traditional French fare? Begin with foie gras maison cuit au
torchon (house goose liver pâté cooked with a torch) or oeufs cocotte à la
crème (eggs baked with cream), then try the rognons de veau à la graine de
moutarde (veal kidneys cooked with mustard grains), or the succulent
house poule au pot (33€/$40) with a tureen of the broth on the side. Finish
with a velvety crème brûlée.

L’Atelier de Joël Robuchon

Tour Eiffel (7e)
MODERN FRENCH
This is still a bonne addresse among the dining chic. Joël Robuchon,
arguably the most famous chef in France when he retired in the 1990s,
came out of retirement in 2004 to open this chic red-and-black lacquered,
sushi bar–type restaurant that serves simple French and Asian fusion food
in which the ingredients are the real stars. Seating is at a 40-person sushi
bar that wraps around the open kitchen. The idea is to give diners a
“behind the line” experience, so you may see Robuchon giving orders,
sous-chefs saucing main dishes, or a pig being roasted on a spit. The menu
continually changes. Instead of starters, Robuchon offers 22 small tasting
plates that diners are encouraged to share. Main dishes can include sushi
(served with delicious sourdough bread), steak tartare in a creamy morel
sauce and hand-cut fries. Robuchon has a no-reservations policy, so get
here early.

Bastille (12e)
BISTRO
Tucked into a part of the Bastille often overlooked by visitors, this restau-
rant is well worth the trek. A mural pays homage to the working-class roots
of the neighborhood, and the space is just large enough to render dining
here a bit noisy. Friendly waiters rush to show diners the day’s offerings
written on a tall chalkboard. Once you sample lunch or dinner, you’ll find
the superb food more than makes up for the decibel level. Diners may be
offered appetizers of gazpacho and tuna tartare, and entrées such as a
homemade terrine of goat cheese and sardines (a house specialty), or a
deliciously spicy cod in Spanish-style sofrito. The head waiter insists on
their wine list made of “vins d’auteurs” inexpensive wines made from small
vineyards. For dessert, the specialty is a rice-cake façon grandmère (made
like Grandma would) with chocolate ice cream, or rose-flavored maca-
roons served with litchi ice cream.

Champs-Elysées (8e)
HAUTE CUISINE
We’ve been raving about this place since 2000 and still find it a heavenly
experience. Chef Phillippe Legendre has earned his three Michelin stars:
Here, every element is in place, from the stately yet serene dining room
with its high ceilings and overstuffed chairs to the Limoges porcelain and
Riedel stemware created for the restaurant to the perfect waitstaff serv-
ing Le Cinq’s sumptuous food. The inventive cuisine may start with
coquilles St Jacques et palourdes à la tartare et au caviar Osciètre (scallop
and clam tartare served with Osetra caviar from the Caspian Sea), and con-
tinue with côtelette de veau de lait poêlé aux capres Pantelleria (pan-
sautéed milk-fed veal chop with Pantelleria Capers), or the 200€ ($240)
for two poulette de Bresse et homard George V en cocotte lutée (young
Bresse chicken and lobster cooked George V style). For dessert, you may
choose from soufflé chocolat de la Caraîbe parfumé de basilic avec un coulis
de gelée de poivron rouge (Caribbean Chocolate Soufflé flavored with basil
and served with a red-pepper-preserve purée) or ananas Victoria rôti,
coeur glacé au gingembre (roasted Victoria pineapple with ginger ice
cream) or the chef’s choice of assorted chocolate desserts. The wine list
here is magnificent; make sure to consult the sommelier, Enrico Bernardo,

VEGETARIAN
This cozy two-level restaurant near Notre-Dame blooms with live plants
hanging from the ceiling and decorating the spiral staircase. The food is
good, filling, and nearly all vegetarian (but not vegan as eggs, cheese, and
some fish are used here). Especially recommended is the miso soup with
tofu and seaweed, the vegetable pâté served with warm toast, les lasagnes
végétarienne (with eggplant, onions, tomatoes, cheese, tofu, and mush-
rooms), and the enormous portions of lentil moussaka made with lentils,
white cheese, egg, tomatoes, and eggplant. Le Grenier has a well-deserved
reputation for desserts, such as the hot apple tart with caramel and vanilla
ice cream and a homemade chocolate cake with orange sauce. The wine
list includes a variety of organic offerings.

Le Kokolion
$–$$
Montmartre (18e)
CLASSIC FRENCH
Tucked away on quiet rue d’Orsel in Montmartre is this hidden gem with
its red facade, colored lights illuminating the entrance. Atmosphere is key
here: Funky glass spheres hang from the ceiling and provide some dim
lighting, and posters of old movies and recent local plays are also on dis-
play, along with the occasional kitschy photograph. Open only for dinner,
service can be slow once it gets crowded, but be patient: The food quality
is higher than the prices you pay. A 24€ ($31) dinner menu can start out
with an os à moelle gratiné avec sel du cuve ronde et toast (beef bone-
marrow casserole made with reservoir salt), followed by half a rooster
roasted in tarragon gravy served with homemade potato purée as your
entrée. And if you opt for a la carte, you can treat yourself to foie gras in
Armagnac with Espelette hot pepper, and then abrandade de morue
nîmoise, a specialty of smoked cod pounded with olive oil, garlic, cream,
saffron, and Parmesan. Their wine list is great and inexpensive: Ask the
Kevin Spacey–look-alike waiter for recommendations (he may be the only
one present). The desserts will unfortunately leave something to be
desired (at these low prices you can’t have everything!) so think about
that before you decide on a prix-fixe menu that includes dessert. The
Kokolion starts late, and ends late, as it serves as an after-theater dinner
Chapter 11: Settling into Paris, City of Light 161

for the nearby Théâtre de l’Atelier. You can start dining as late as midnight,
but be warned that by 10 p.m., though patrons’ excitement is high, reac-
tion time is decidedly lower for the waiters.

Michel Rostang
$$$$
Ternes (17e)
CLASSIC FRENCH
Sampling a menu de dégustation, a tasting menu made up of five to nine dif-
ferent courses, each with its own wine selected to taste (courses are usu-
ally small) is a wonderful way to experience a celebrated chef’s specialties,
and Michel Rostang’s flagship restaurant is an ideal place to have such an
experience. Four different rooms offer four different themes (one features
Art Nouveau, another mimics the interior of the famous Orient Express),
and the décor is pleasing and beautiful. The dishes are meticulously pre-
pared, and their tastes and textures are unique and outstanding — at 175€
($228) a head, they better be! Ordering a la carte can be equally reward-
ing, however. Start with araignée de mer décoritiquée dan sa coque (de-
shelled spider crab served in its shell), or a gratin de queues d’Écrevisses
en cassoulet (casserole of crawfish tails cooked in a bean stew). For dinner
you may have a quenelle de Brochet soufflé à la crème d’homard (pike
cooked into a soufflé with lobster crème), and perhaps a carré d’agneau
“Allaiton de’Aveyron” jus au vinaigre de vin vieux (a rack of the highest
quality lamb from Aveyron in a gravy made from aged wine vinegar). This
is also an opportunity to try some fowl that rarely make it to American
tables: la pintade dermiere roti en fois gras de canard poivré (guinea fowl
roasted with peppered duck fois gras). Desserts change daily and are pre-
pared on the spot. One should dress nicely for this place; a jacket and tie
for men is highly recommended. Tip: If this spot is beyond your budget,
down the street you can find M. Rostang’s “baby bistro,” le Bistro d’à Côté,
which is also delicious and more normally priced.

The elegant arcade that encircles the gardens inside the Palais-Royal also
surrounds this restaurant, making it one of the most romantic locations in
Paris. Service is lacking during midday, as it is a favorite lunch-spot for
professionals working the area; better to eat dinner here and avoid over-
worked waiters and waitresses. Sit at the terrace on warm, sun-filled days
and begin your meal with starters such as escargot with chives or duck
liver terrine with red onion. Main dishes vary with the season but may
include lamb roasted with rosemary and a side of creamy polenta or a

tartare of red tuna during the summer. They have a special risotto section
on their menu and promise smooth and buttery results. Try the good
house red wine, served Lyonnais-style in thick-bottomed bottles. The
desserts are delicious; the pistachio and chocolate millefeuille (puff
pastry) are divine. Whenever dining outside just isn’t an option, enjoy the
recently renovated dining room that shines in tones of gold, silver, and
warm red.

Sitting down to tea in Paris can be an elegant and refined undertaking, or
a relaxing break between bouts of shopping and musée-hopping. The tea
salons have a wide range of blends, steeped to perfection, and the
pastry selections are usually excellent (Ladurée’s macaroons are world-
famous). Save your full meals, however, for a restaurant because tea
salons tend to be expensive.

Experiencing the Parisian cafe
Here are some of Paris’s best places to read the paper, write postcards,
people-watch, and soak up the city’s atmosphere while relaxing with a
cup of coffee, a glass of wine or beer, or a sandwich, salad, or traditional
French specialty such as pot-au-feu (beef boiled with vegetables). Cafes
are generally open from about 8 a.m. until 1 a.m., and most take Master-
Card and Visa.
Au Bistro de la Place
This square on the place du Marché Ste-Catherine is a pedestrian zone on
the site of an 18th-century market, and this bistro is prettiest of all on the
outdoor terrace here. The food also is the best here; you may find fresh
vegetable soup served hot or cold or fresh goat cheese marinated in olive
oil with salad. If you don’t come here for a meal, visit during off-peak hours
to enjoy a leisurely drink or pastry on the terrace.
See map p. 150. 2 place du Marché Ste-Catherine, 4e. % 01-42-78-21-32. Métro: 
St-Paul.
Café Beaubourg
This hip, but dark, bilevel cafe is cool and elegant, with large circular
columns that soar to an illuminated ceiling. The walls are filled with books,
and a small wooden bridge spans the upper part of the cafe and leads to
quieter, artistically designed tables. The bathrooms are attractions in
Part III: Paris and the Best of the Ile de France

themselves; they have the serenity of Zen gardens. Simple food may
include a smooth gazpacho, salmon club sandwich, or goat cheese salad.
The outside terrace is in a strategic spot overlooking the Centre
Pompidou, and you’ll become a main attraction yourself as passersby cast
curious glances at the people chic enough to eat here.
See map p. 150. 100 rue St-Martin, 4e. % 01-48-87-63-96. Métro: Rambuteau or Hôtel-
de-Ville.
Café de Flore
In the heart of St-Germain-des-Prés, this cafe is still going strong, even
though the famous writers have moved on — and you now pay high prices.
Sartre is said to have written Les Chemins de la Liberté (The Roads to
Freedom) at his table here, and he and Simone de Beauvoir saw people by
appointment here. Other regulars included André Malraux and Guillaume
Apollinaire. Paris’s leading intellectual bookstore, La Hune, is right next door.
See map p. 150. 172 bd. St-Germain, 6e. % 01-45-48-55-26. Métro: St-Germain-des-
Prés.
Café de la Place
This old-fashioned cafe overlooking small, tree-lined place Edgar-Quinet
has become a popular spot for young neighborhood residents. Browse the
menu of inexpensive bistro specialties, or opt for a simple sandwich and
a glass of wine. If you’re lucky, you’ll see a brocante (flea market) or crafts
fair in the square. Café de la Place also is a good place to stop before any
trips from the Gare du Montparnasse, which is around the corner and just
down the street.
See map p. 150. 23 rue d’Odessa, 14e. % 01-42-18-01-55. Métro: Edgar-Quinet.
Café de L’Industrie
This popular bar and cafe is young, friendly, and casual. Plants, wooden
floors, and wooden Venetian blinds lend the two spacious rooms a vaguely
colonial flavor. Hip Bastille denizens drift in and out all day, and after 9:30
p.m., the place is mobbed. Bartenders specialize in rum drinks.
See map p. 150. 16 rue St-Sabin, 11e. % 01-47-00-13-53. Métro: Bastille.
Café des Deux Moulins
Amélie was a quirky low-budget film that was nominated for five Oscars
and was seen by more than 25 million people around the world following
its release in 2001. The film was set in Montmartre, and this, the cafe fea-
tured in the film, has developed into a mandatory stopping-off place for
the constantly arriving “cult of Amélie.” In the film, Amélie worked as a
waitress here. The musty atmosphere, with its 1950s décor, mustard-col-
ored ceiling, and lace curtains, has been preserved, even the wall lamps
and unisex toilet. The menu is much the same as it has always been —
escalopes of veal in a cream sauce, beef filets, calf’s liver, green frisée salad
Chapter 11: Settling into Paris, City of Light 165

with bacon bits and warm goat cheese, and pig’s brains with lentils. The
kitchen serves hamburgers, but with an egg on top. The classic dish is a
demi-Camembert with a glass of Côtes du Rhône.
See map p. 150. 15 rue Lepic, 18e. % 01-42-54-90-50. Métro: Blance.
Café les Deux-Magots
Like its neighbor, Café de Flore, les Deux-Magots was a hangout for Sartre
and Simone de Beauvoir. The intellectuals met here in the 1950s, and Sartre
wrote at his table every morning. With prices that start at 4€ ($4.80) for
coffee and 2.20€ ($2.65) for a croissant, the cafe is an expensive place for
literary-intellectual pilgrims, but an idyllic spot to watch the nightly prom-
enade on boulevard St-Germain. Service can be snippy.
See map p. 150. 6 place St Germain, 6e. % 01-45-48-55-25. Métro: St-Germain-des-
Prés.
Café Mabillon
Welcome the dawn at Café Mabillon, which stays open all night. During the
day, contemporary rock music draws a young, hip crowd to relax on the
outdoor terrace or in the ultramodern interior. At night, the music changes
to techno, and the bordello-red banquettes fill with a wide assortment of
night owls. As dawn approaches, the sound drops to a level just loud
enough to keep you from dozing off in your seat.
See map p. 150. 164 bd. St-Germain, 6e. % 01-43-26-62-93. Métro: Mabillon.
Café Marly
This stunning cafe at the Musée du Louvre has a gorgeous view of the glass
pyramid that is the museum’s main entrance. With high ceilings, warmly
painted pastel walls, and luxurious red sofa chairs, the rooms could house
the museum’s latest art collection. Don’t let the elegant ambience intimi-
date you; there’s good food to be had. Choose from the carefully selected
wine list, sit on the balcony, and enjoy the exquisite lighting on the pyra-
mid and surrounding 18th-century facades. After 8 p.m., seating is for
dinner only.
See map p. 150. 93 rue de Rivoli, cour Napoléon du Louvre, 1er. % 01-49-26-06-60.
Métro: Palais-Royal–Musée du Louvre.
Fouquet’s
Not far from the Arc de Triomphe, the early-20th-century Fouquet’s is a
Champs-Elysées institution. Patrons have included James Joyce, Charlie
Chaplin, Marlene Dietrich, Winston Churchill, and Franklin D. Roosevelt.
You pay dearly for the glitzy associations and nostalgia, however.

La Chaise au Plafond
Tucked away on a pedestrians-only side street in the heart of the Marais,
this friendly, stylish place is a perfect spot for a time-out after visiting the
Musée Picasso. It serves enormous salads, imaginative sandwiches, and
thick tarts. A weekend brunch (about 17€/$22) is served, but the tiny cafe
tables aren’t designed to hold the assortment of dishes, so you may feel
squeezed.
See map p. 150. 10 rue Trésor, 4e. % 01-42-76-03-22. Métro: Hôtel-de-Ville.
La Chope
This cafe is worth a stop for its location on top of rue Mouffetard, right on
place de la Contrescarpe. The square centers on four lilac trees and a foun-
tain. It can get rowdy at night.
See map p. 150. 9 rue Mouffetard, 5e. % 01-43-54-06-81. Métro: Cardinal Lemoine.
La Coupole
La Coupole has been packing them in since Henry Miller came here for his
morning porridge. The cavernous interior is always jammed and bristling
with energy. Japanese businesspeople, French yuppies, models, tourists,
and neighborhood regulars keep the frenzied waiters running until 2 a.m.
You won’t know which is more interesting, the scene on the street or the
parade that passes through the revolving doors. The food is good, too, but
prices are high.
See map p. 150. 102 bd. Montparnasse, 14e. % 01-43-20-14-20. Métro: Vavin.
La Palette
Students from the nearby Ecole des Beaux-Arts, artists, and gallery owners
linger and watch the life of the Left Bank flow by. The interior is decorated
with colorful murals, and a palette hangs over the bar. The fare is open-
faced sandwiches and salads at reasonable prices. Service can be snippy.
See map p. 150. 43 rue de Seine, 6e. % 01-43-26-68-15. Métro: Mabillon.
Les Comptoirs du Charbon
In the heart of trendy rue Oberkampf, this turn-of-the-20th-century dance
hall is one of the hottest spots in Paris for people who like people and don’t
mind being crowded. The stunning Art Nouveau interior has high ceilings,
and walls covered with mirrors, wood, and hand-painted murals — which
you can barely perceive through the bustle and haze. During the day or
early evening you can relax, hang out, chat, or read a newspaper. After
about 9 p.m., the music gets louder, the long wood bar and banquettes fill
up, and you are lucky to get in, let alone get a seat.
See map p. 150. 109 rue Oberkampf, 11e. % 01-43-57-55-13. Métro: Parmentier.

L’Eté en Pente Douce
To escape the shoulder-to-shoulder tourists on place du Tertre, head down
the eastern steps under Sacré-Coeur to this popular cafe situated in a leafy
square. The terrace here faces the stairs and iron lamps painted by Utrillo,
and someone is always performing for the captive audience. The interior
is brightly decorated with mosaics, unusual objets d’art, and a lovely
painted ceiling. Between lunch and dinner, the restaurant serves a tempt-
ing array of pastries and sandwiches.
See map p. 150. 23 rue Muller, 18e. % 01-42-64-02-67. Métro: Chateau-Rouge.
Pause Café
Featured in the French hit movie comedy, Chacun Cherche Son Chat (Each
Looks for Her Cat), this cafe has become one of Paris’s hottest. Its hip clien-
tele are denizens of the club scene (flyers inside give dates for upcoming
events) or cool neighborhood residents. A groovy distressed interior fea-
tures paintings of big-eyed worried women, while outdoors is made trop-
ical with cloth-and-bamboo umbrellas and potted palms. You can get a
tasty 8€ ($10) quiche of the day or bowl of gazpacho soup for 5€ ($6.50),
as well as beer and drinks.
See map p. 150. 41 rue de Charonne, 11e. % 01-48-06-80-33. Métro: Lédru-Rollin.
Wine bars
With good selections of wines by the glass and tasty light meals served
all day in pleasant surroundings, the Paris wine bar is often a cozy and
sophisticated alternative to the cafe.
À la Cloche des Halles
This tiny bar and cafe is crowded at lunchtime with people dining on plates
of ham or quiche, accompanied by a bottle of wine. It’s convivial and fun,
but noisy and crowded. If you can’t find a seat, you can usually stand at the
bar and eat.
28 rue Coquillière, 1er. % 01-42-36-93-89. Métro: Les Halles or Palais-Royal–Musée
du Louvre. Mon–Fri 8 a.m.–9 p.m.; Sat 10 a.m.–6 p.m.
Aux Négociants
The photographer Robert Doisneau came here often (his picture is on the
wall), but today a discerning crowd of regulars keeps this tiny, unpreten-
tious wine bar near Montmartre humming. The excellent pâtés and ter-
rines are homemade and served with fresh, chewy bread.
27 rue Lambert, 18e. % 01-46-06-15-11. Métro: Château-Rouge or Lamarck-
Caulincourt. Mon–Fri noon–2 p.m.; Tues–Fri 6:30–10:30 p.m.
Part III: Paris and the Best of the Ile de France 
168

Bistro du Peintre
Painters, actors, and night crawlers hang out here nightly. The zinc bar,
large terrace, and superb Belle Époque style would make this wine bar a
highlight even if the wine selection were not so reasonably priced.
116 av. Ledru-Rollin, 11e. % 01-47-00-34-39. Métro: Ledru-Rollin. Daily 7 a.m.–midnight.
Clown Bar
You may just stand shoulder to shoulder with a real clown from the nearby
Cirque d’Hiver. The bar is decorated with a mélange of circus posters and
circus-themed ceramic tiles. The wine list features an extensive selection
of French offerings.
114 rue Amelot, 11e. % 01-43-55-87-35. Métro: Filles du Calvaire. Mon–Sat noon–2:30
p.m. and 7 p.m.–1 a.m., Sun 7 p.m.–1 a.m.
La Tartine
This is the wine bar that time forgot — pure unsophisticated prewar Paris,
from the nicotine-browned walls and frosted globe chandeliers to the worn
wood furniture. The ambience is funky and working-class, but a broad seg-
ment of society savors glasses of wine at the bar or lingers over a news-
paper and a tartine (open-face sandwich).
24 rue de Rivoli, 4e. % 01-42-72-76-85. Métro: St-Paul. Tues–Sat 7 a.m.–11:30 p.m.;
Sun–Mon 10 a.m.–10 p.m.
Le Griffonnier
A first-rate kitchen is here, and so is a terrific wine cellar. Sample bistro
specialties such as confit de canard maison, or try a hearty plate of char-
cuterie, terrines, and cheese, usually from the Auvergne region of central
France, and ask your waiter to recommend the wine. Hot meals are served
only at lunchtime and Thursday evenings.
8 rue des Saussaies, 8e. % 01-42-65-17-17. Métro: Champs-Elysées–Clemenceau.
Mon–Fri 7:30 a.m.–9 p.m. Closed on major holidays.
Le Sancerre
This quiet place is great for relaxing with a light meal or glass of wine after
visiting the Tour Eiffel. Loire wines are the specialty, including, of course,
Sancerre. Le Sancerre serves typically French items, such as omelets of all
varieties with a side of fried potatoes, and duck-liver terrine. The more
adventurous can sample the ubiquitous andouillette, sausage that is decid-
edly an acquired taste.
22 av. Rapp, 7e. % 01-45-51-75-91. Métro: Alma Marceau. Mon–Fri 8 a.m.–10 p.m.;
Sat 8:30 a.m.–4:30 p.m.
Chapter 11: Settling into Paris, City of Light 169

Mélac
Owner Jacques Mélac has an excellent selection of wine from nearly all the
regions of France, which he dispenses to a lively crowd of regulars. Usually
a hot plat du jour is available for lunch, but you can feast on a selection of
first-rate pâtés, terrines, charcuterie, and cheeses all day.
42 rue Léon Frot, 11e. % 01-43-70-59-27. Métro: Charonne. Mon–Sat 9 a.m.–3 p.m.
and 7:30–10 p.m.
Taverne Henri IV
Although on the expensive side, the wine and food are excellent at this
authentic, old-fashioned bar where regulars, mostly male, read the news-
paper, discuss the news of the day, and smoke nonstop. The variety of
wines by the glass can accompany open-faced sandwiches (including
warm goat cheese), pâtés, and such cheeses as Cantal and Auvergne blue.
13 place du Pont Neuf, 1er. % 01-43-54-27-90. Métro: Pont Neuf. Mon–Fri noon–10
p.m.; Sat noon–4 p.m.
Willi’s Wine Bar
Willi’s has become a Paris institution since it opened in 1980. You can
sample 250 different varieties of wine while sitting at the polished oak bar
or have dinner in the high-ceilinged oak beamed dining room from a full
menu of main courses costing 25€ to 35€ ($33–$45). Each year, the owners
commission an image relating to wine from an artist, and the colorful paint-
ings are available for sale as prints for 38€ to 200€ ($49–$260).
13 rue des Petits-Champs, 1er. % 01-42-61-05-09. Métro: Bourse or Pyramides.
Mon–Sat noon–2:30 p.m. and 7–11 p.m.; bar open Mon–Sat noon–midnight.

I
n Paris, you are never at a loss for something to see. In this chapter,
we review 21 of the best of Paris’s many attractions, but that’s still
probably more than you’ll be able to visit in a single trip (without pass-
ing out from fatigue and missing dinner in one of Paris’s terrific restau-
rants). If you plan to visit two or three museums a day, purchase the
Paris Museum Pass, on sale at most major museums and Métro stations.
It provides for free entry to 60 attractions and monuments in and around
Paris, including the Musée du Louvre and the Musée d’Orsay. (Note: The
Tour Eiffel does not accept it.) The pass costs 30€ ($39) for two days,
45€ ($59) for four days, and 60€ ($78) for six days. Another benefit?
When using the pass, you don’t have to stand in line at attractions, a dis-
tinct plus on a hot day in the Louvre’s courtyard, where the sun reflects
off the cobblestones and there’s nary a tree in sight.
You may see advertisements for the Paris Visite card, available at most
Métro stations and good for unlimited travel for one, two, three, or five
days. Although it has discounts for some museums and monuments,
unless these are sights you want to see (a brochure lists discounted
sights), the card turns out to be quite expensive. Cost of the card ranges
from 8.50€ ($11) for one day to 27€ ($35) for five days.
The Top Attractions: From the Arc to the Tour
In addition to the top attractions listed here (and shown on the “Paris’s
Top Attractions” map), make time for a cruise on the Seine River. For
details, check out the “Cruising the Seine” section later in this chapter.

Chapter 12: Exploring Paris 173

Arc de Triomphe
Champs-Elysées (8e)
The Arc de Triomphe was commissioned to honor the 128 victorious bat-
tles fought by Napoléon’s army. Although the Arc has witnessed the agony
of defeat, as in 1871 when Paris was seized by the Prussians during the
Franco-Prussian War, and in 1940, when Nazi armies marched through the
arch and down the Champs-Elysées, it better symbolizes the thrill of vic-
tory: De Gaulle striding through the Arc to symbolize Paris’s liberation in
1944 is one of the country’s most cherished memories. Today the Arc
houses the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier, which was dedicated in 1921 to
honor the 1.5 million French soldiers who died during World War I; every
evening, at 6:30 p.m., the flame is symbolically relit. The panoramic view
is the real attraction for visitors to the Arc de Triomphe, however. From
the top, 49m (162 ft.) up, you can see in a straight line the Champs-Elysées,
the obelisk in the place de la Concorde, and the Louvre. That big cube at
the far end is the Grande Arche de la Défense in St-Denis, built to be the
modern equivalent to this arch. Allow an hour to visit, an hour and a half
in high summer.
See map p. 172. Place Charles-de-Gaulle, 8e. % 01-55-37-73-77. www.monum.fr.
Métro: Charles de Gaulle–Etoile. Bus: 22, 30, 31, 52, 73, 92. Admission: 6.40€ ($8.30)
adults, 3.60€ ($4.70) ages 12–25, free for kids younger than 12. Open: Daily Apr–Sept
9:30 a.m.–11 p.m.; Nov–Mar 10 a.m.–10:30 p.m. Closed major holidays.
Basilique du Sacré-Coeur
Montmartre (18e)
The white Byzantine–Romanesque basilica dominating Paris’s highest 
hill — the one that you can see from all across the city — is Basilique du
Sacré-Coeur, built from 1876, after France’s defeat in the Franco-Prussian
War, to 1919. The best reason to come here is for the city-spanning views
from its dome — visibility is nearly 50km (about 30 miles) across the
rooftops of Paris on a clear day. The climb from church floor to dome, how-
ever, is on a flight of nail-bitingly steep corkscrew steps. A better idea, and
one that kids enjoy, is to conserve your pre-Dome climbing energy by
taking the Métro to the Anvers station, then taking its elevator to the exit
and walking the short distance from rue Steinkerque. Turn left onto rue
Tardieu, where, for the price of a Métro ticket, a funiculaire (a cable car)
whisks you from the base of the Montmartre butte (hill) right up to the
Part III: Paris and the Best of the Ile de France 
174
Avoiding traffic around the Arc de Triomphe
After you arrive at the Arc, you don’t want to tangle with the traffic that zips around the
circle. To reach the stairs and elevators that climb the Arc, take the underpass using
the white Métro entrances. Don’t try to cross on surface streets. Attempting to dodge
the warp-speed traffic zooming around the circle spells certain serious injury.

outside of the church. The church’s interior is not as striking as its exterior
and is, in fact, vaguely depressing.
See map p. 172. 25 rue du Chevalier-de-la-Barre. % 01-53-41-89-00. www.sacre-

Cathédrale de Notre-Dame
Ile de la Cité (4e)
Crusaders prayed here before leaving for the holy wars. Napoléon
crowned himself emperor on site and then crowned his wife, Josephine,
empress. When Paris was liberated during World War II, General de Gaulle
rushed to this cathedral to give thanks.
Construction of Notre-Dame (see the nearby “Notre-Dame de Paris” map)
started in 1163 when Pope Alexander III laid the cornerstone, and was com-
pleted in 1330. Built in an age of illiteracy, the cathedral windows tell the
stories of the Bible in its portals, paintings, and stained glass. Angry citi-
zens pillaged Notre-Dame during the French Revolution, mistaking reli-
gious statues above the portals on the west front for representations of
kings and beheading them. (To see the statues removed by revolutionar-
ies visit the Cluny Museum.)
Nearly 100 years later, when Notre-Dame had been turned into a barn,
writer Victor Hugo and other artists called attention to its dangerous state
of disrepair, and architect Viollet-le-Duc began the much-needed restora-
tion. He designed Notre-Dame’s spire, a new feature, and Baron Haussmann
(Napoléon III’s urban planner) tore down the houses cluttering the views
of the cathedral.
Before entering, walk around to the east end of the church to appreciate
the spectacular flying buttresses. On a sunny morning, catch the giant rose
windows — which retain some of their 13th-century stained glass — in all
their glory. The highlight for kids is undoubtedly climbing the 387 narrow
and winding steps to the top of one of the towers for a fabulously
Quasimodo view of the gargoyles and of Paris. Word of advice: If you plan
to visit the tower, go early in the morning. Lines stretch down the square
in front of the cathedral in the summer.

Centre Georges Pompidou
Le Marais (3e, 4e)
Brightly colored escalators, elevators, air conditioning, and tubular pas-
sages run along this building’s facade, but the inside is a wonderfully
spacious haven in which to view, touch, or listen to modern art and
artists. The newer of Paris’s two modern art museums, the Centre
National d’Art et de Culture Georges Pompidou includes two floors of
work from the Musée National d’Art Moderne, France’s national col-
lection of modern art. The Centre Pompidou also houses a cinema and
a huge public library; spaces for modern dance and music; temporary

exhibits that often include video and computer works; and nearly 150 draw-
ings, paintings, and other works by Romanian sculptor Constantin Brancusi
in the Brancusi Atelier, a small building near the museum’s entrance.
British architect Richard Rogers and Italian architect Renzo Piano
designed the building in the late 1960s as part of a redevelopment plan for
the Beaubourg neighborhood. The nearby Igor Stravinsky fountain (infor-
mally la Fontaine des automats) has fun sculptures by Tinguely and Niki de
Saint Phalle that include red lips spitting water, a mermaid squirting water
from “strategic” body parts, and a twirling grinning skull.
It is no longer free to ride the escalators to the top of the Pompidou; you
must purchase a ticket to the museum to take in the rooftop panorama. If
visiting the museum just doesn’t appeal, consider stopping at the Pompi-
dou’s ultrahip top-floor Restaurant Georges (you will need reservations).

Champs-Elysées
Champs-Elysées (8e)
This isn’t just a boulevard, it’s where Parisians go to celebrate victory and
freedom. When close to a million singing, flag-waving Parisians spilled into
the avenue after the French Bleues worn the World Cup in 1998, it was said
that the country hadn’t experienced such group euphoria since the days
following the Liberation of Paris by the Allies in 1944. The Champs also
overlooked the city’s biggest New Year’s party; in 2000, crowds of people
gathered here to watch astonishing fireworks and cheer in the new cen-
tury. The scene on France’s most famous street is liveliest at night, with
people lining up for the numerous cinemas (see English-language films
here by looking for v.o. for version originale on schedules and movie
posters), and floodlights illuminate the Arc de Triomphe and place de la
Concorde. Restaurants consist mainly of standard chain cafes (Chez
Clément, Hippo) and American-style fast food (McDonald’s, Planet Holly-
wood), although good restaurants abound on the streets surrounding the
avenue (see Chapter 11). You can shop at reasonably priced stores, such
as Zara, get good deals on T-shirts at Petit Bateau, pick up what all of
Europe is listening to at FNAC or Virgin, wander the very luxe Louis Vuitton
(whose flagship “cultural space” and store opened in 2006), and pass chain
stores that you’d see in any American mall (the Disney Store, Quiksilver).
Some of the stores are open on Sunday. Allow an hour to walk from top to
bottom, longer if you want to shop, eat, or dawdle.

ceau, Franklin-D-Roosevelt, George V, Charles de Gaulle–Etoile. Bus: Many lines

Cimitière du Père-Lachaise
Montmartre and Beyond (20e)
Cresting a high hill overlooking Paris, the world’s most visited cemetery is
more outdoor museum than place of mourning. No wonder Parisians have
always come here to stroll and reflect; with its winding, cobbled streets,
park benches, and street signs, the 44.5 hectare (110-acre) Père Lachaise
is a minicity unto itself. Many visitors leave flowers or notes scrawled on
Métro tickets for their favorite celebrity residents, who include Isadora
Duncan, Edith Piaf, Oscar Wilde, Chopin, Jim Morrison (you can be sure
to run across aging hippies here), Modigliani, Molière, Pissarro, Proust,
Sarah Bernhardt, and Gertrude Stein. If you’re interested in nothing else,
go for the striking and often poignant statuary: the boy who seems to sit
up in bed as if he’d heard a noise; the young woman who’s frozen, mid-
dance, as if turned to stone without warning. The 18th-century bronze
tomb of murdered journalist Victor Noir is reputed to make women fertile
when rubbed (the polished sheen of certain parts of his statue is testa-
ment to the lore!). Oscar Wilde’s impressive Art Nouveau tomb here,
carved by Sir Jacob Epstein, is covered with lipstick-spots from the kisses
of his admirers. You can obtain a free map from the gatekeeper at the main
entrance, but a better map is sold outside the entrance for 2€ ($2.60).
Allow at least two hours to visit.

Hôtel des Invalides (Napoléon’s Tomb)
Tour Eiffel and Invalides (7e)
Louis XIV, who liked war and waged many, built Invalides, one of Europe’s
architectural masterpieces, as a hospital and home for all veteran officers
and soldiers “whether maimed or old or frail.” It still has offices for depart-
ments of the French armed forces, and part of it is still a hospital. The best
way to get the sense of awe that the Hôtel des Invalides inspires is to walk
to it by crossing the Alexander III Bridge. The dome of its Église du Dôme
(gilded with 12kg/27 lb. of real gold) is one of the high points of classical
art, rising 107m (351 ft.) from the ground. Sixteen green copper cannons
point outward in a powerful display.
Most visitors come to see the Tomb of Napoléon, where the emperor is
buried in six coffins, one inside the other, under the great dome. The first
coffin is iron, the second is mahogany, the third and fourth are lead, the
fifth is ebony, and the outermost is oak. The emperor’s remains were trans-
ferred here 20 years after his death in 1820 on the island of St. Helena,
where he was exiled following his defeat at Waterloo. Buried along with
Napoléon in smaller tombs are the emperor’s two brothers, his son
Napoléon II of France, Claude Rouget de Lisle (author of La Marseillaise,
the French national anthem), and Henri de la Tour d’Auvergne, Viscount de
Turenne — one of France’s greatest military leaders. 
Part III: Paris and the Best of the Ile de France 
178

Enemy flags captured during the military campaigns of the 19th and 20th
centuries hang from the rafters in two impressive rows at the Invalides’s
other church, the Église de St-Louis, known as the Church of the Soldiers.
And one of the world’s greatest war museums can also be found here, the
Musée de l’Armée — admission is included when you buy your ticket for
Napoléon’s tomb. It features thousands of weapons from prehistory to
World War II, such as spearheads, arrowheads, maces, cannons, and guns,
in addition to battle flags, booty, suits of armor, and uniforms from all
around the world. The De Gaulle wing tells the story of World War II on
touch screens, with videos, a decoding machine, and other artifacts. Set
aside two hours for a complete visit or a half-hour to see the tomb.

Jardin and Palais du Luxembourg
St-Germain-des-Prés (6e)
No matter which entrance you walk through, you will fall in love with the
Jardin du Luxembourg, a beloved park not far from the Sorbonne (a
branch of the Université de Paris) and just south of the Latin Quarter.
Children love it for its playground, toy-boat pond, pony rides, and puppet
theater. Besides pools, fountains, and statues of queens and poets, the park
has tennis and boules courts. The park was commissioned by King Henri
IV’s queen, Marie de Médici, who also had the Palais du Luxembourg built
at the northern edge of the park. The Palais resembles the Palazzo Pitti in
Florence, where Marie spent her childhood and for which she was home-
sick. When the queen was banished in 1630, the palace was abandoned until
the Revolution, when it was used as a prison. It is now the seat of the French
Senate and is not open to the public. Orchards in the park’s southwest
corner contain 360 varieties of apples, 270 kinds of pears, and various
grapevines. Members of the French Senate get to eat the fruit, but leftovers
go to a soup kitchen. Walk north, and you come across a bevy of beehives
behind a low fence. A beekeeping (apiculture) course is taught here week-
ends. Try to find the Statue of Liberty tucked away nearby.

Jardin des Tuileries
Louvre (1er)
Come for a stroll here either before or after visiting the Louvre. Once a
fashionable carriageway, today the Tuileries is Paris’s most visited park
and a great place to rest your feet and catch some rays on conveniently
placed metal chairs surrounding the garden’s fountains. In keeping with
the French style of parks, trees are planted according to an orderly design
Chapter 12: Exploring Paris 179

and the sandy paths are arrow straight. Spread out across 25 hectares (63
acres), the gardens were originally laid out in the 1560s for Queen Mother
Catherine de Medici in front of the Tuileries Palace which was burned down
during the 1871 Paris Commune. The Orangerie (which has finally reopened;
see below) and the Jeu de Paume are at the garden’s western edge, and to
the east you’ll find 40 beautiful Maillol bronzes scattered among the trees,
as well as four sculptures by Rodin, and works by Jean Dubuffet, Alberto
Giacometti, David Smith, Max Ernst, Henry Moore, and Henri Laurens You
can get a light snack at one of the outdoor cafes. During the summer, a car-
nival features an enormous Ferris wheel (with panoramic views of the city),
a log flume, a funhouse, arcade-style games, snacks, and soft-serve ice cream
(but the best is the homemade ice cream sold from a stand beyond the Arc
de Triomphe du Carrousel at the entrance to the Tuileries).

Jardin du Palais-Royal
Louvre (1er)
In past centuries, gamblers and those seeking more lascivious pleasures
flocked to this garden where Cardinal Richelieu ordered the Royal Palace
built in 1630 as his personal residence, complete with grounds landscaped
by the royal gardener. Today the palace is no longer open to the public,
but its statue-filled gardens, including Daniel Buren’s wonderful prison-
striped columns of staggered heights built in 1986 (which make for a great
photo op), remain one of the most restful places in the city. 
The square is also ringed by restaurants, art galleries, and specialty bou-
tiques, and is home to the Comédie Française.

Le Musée du quai Branly
Eiffel Tower/Invalides (7e)
This stunning museum is the newest art museum in Paris, just a block from
the Eiffel Tower. Opened in June 2006 to much fanfare (it’s not often that
new art museums open up here; the last was the Musée d’Orsay in 1986),
it was designed by Jean Nouvel, who also designed the Fondation Cartier
and the Institut du Monde Arabe, and there is plenty of glass to let in the
light. Housed in four spectacular buildings with a garden walled off from
the quai Branly, are the art, sculpture, and cultural materials of a vast range
of non-Western civilizations, separated into sections that represent the tra-
ditional cultures of Africa, East and Southeast Asia, Oceania, Australia, the
Americas, and New Zealand. The pieces here come from the now defunct
Musée des Arts Africains et Océaniens, from the Louvre and the Musée de
l’Homme. Temporary exhibits are shown off in boxes all along the 600-foot
exhibition hall. Incredible masterpieces are on display made by some very

advanced traditional civilizations: Some of the most impressive exhibits
present tribal masks of different cultures, some of which are so lifelike and
emotional in their creation that you can feel the fear and elation involved
in their use, which is well documented in descriptions in French and
English. Allow two hours for a full visit; also take a stroll in their carefully
manicured garden, or have a café in their small cafeteria across from the
main building. There are numerous entrances to the museum grounds from
the area near the Eiffel Tower, the main entrance is on quai Branly.

before closing.
Musée de l’Orangerie des Tuileries
Louvre (1er)
Finally! The newly renovated Musée de l’Orangerie has reopened after
nearly seven years. The highlight of the Orangerie is most definitely its
two oval rooms wrapped nearly 360 degrees with Monet’s Nymphéas, the
water lily series he painted especially for the Orangerie, and these rooms
were the primary focus of the renovations. The immense and awe- inspir-
ing murals simply pop from their spotless cream-white walls, lit brightly
enough to accentuate all of the beautifully emotional colors while the
rounded corners of the two oval rooms give admirers of Monet’s works a
calm and pleasant space to enjoy the art. Since 1984, the museum has also
housed the remarkable John Walter and Paul Guillaume art collection,
comprising works by Cézanne, Renoir, Rousseau, Matisse, Modigliani,
Dérain, Picasso, and Soutine, among other artists. Due to its popularity,
there may be a wait of up to a half-hour here.

Musée d’Orsay
Tour Eiffel and Invalides (7e)
Most visitors to Paris go to the Musée d’Orsay because they want to, and
not out of obligation like certain other ones we could name (but won’t).
It’s a wonder. Take a moment at the top of the central staircase to envision
where the trains once pulled into this former train station under the
curved roof. Then enjoy the Musée d’Orsay’s real claim to fame — its
unsurpassed collection of Impressionist masterpieces. The museum has
three floors of exhibits. On the ground floor are Ingres’s La Source, Millet’s
L’Angelus, the Barbizon school, Manet’s Olympia, and other works of early
Impressionism. Impressionism continues on the top level, with Renoir’s Le
Moulin de la Galette, Manet’s Déjeuner sur l’Herbe, Degas’s Racing at
Chapter 12: Exploring Paris 181

Longchamps, Monet’s cathedrals, van Gogh’s Self-Portrait, and Whistler’s
Portrait of the Artist’s Mother. Also included are works by Gauguin and the
Pont-Aven school, Toulouse-Lautrec, Pissarro, Cézanne, and Seurat.
Symbolism, naturalism, and Art Nouveau are represented on the middle
level; the international Art Nouveau exhibit is worth a look for its furni-
ture, objets d’art, and Koloman Moser’s Paradise, a beautiful design for
stained glass. Give yourself three hours, including a lunch break in the
museum’s gorgeous, turn-of-the-20th-century Musée d’Orsay restaurant on
the middle level. For less expensive and quicker light bites, try the Café
des Hauteurs on the fifth floor (with a view of the Seine through its clock
window) or the snack bar on the mezzanine.

The scoop on Paris ice cream
Rhubarb, plum, cassis, honey nut . . . if Paris doesn’t have the best ice cream in the
world, it must run a close second. Such flavors, such creaminess! Ask for a cornet
seule (single-scoop cone) or cornet double (double-scoop) — even the cone is deli-
cious. Prices range from 3€ ($3.90) for a single to 5€ ($6.50) for a double-scoop cone.
Most places open daily around 10:30 a.m. and close around 8 p.m. Remember, though,
that sitting down to order ice cream is always more expensive; it can be twice as much
as ordering your cone to go. Historically, the best ice cream has been found at
Berthillon (31 rue St-Louis-en-l’Ile, 4e; % 01-43-54-31-61; Métro: Cité). Though
Berthillon closes from July 15 through the first week in September, a note on the door
directs customers to other nearby shops that sell its ice cream. The now-popular chain
Amorino (4 rue de Buci, 6e; % 01-43-26-57-46; Métro: Odéon) has also gained much
popularity and in well-visited areas stays open as late as the cafes. The following also

month of visits to see it all (see the sidebar “How to Love the Louvre” for
tips to de-stress your visit). The Louvre is organized in three wings — Sully,
Denon, and Richelieu — over four floors exhibiting art and antiquities from
Oriental, Islamic, Egyptian, Greek, Etruscan, Roman, Oceanic, European,
and North and South American civilizations, as well as sculpture, objets
d’art, paintings, prints, drawings, and the moats and dungeon of the
medieval Louvre fortress.

How to Love the Louvre 
A visit to the Louvre doesn’t have to be overwhelming. Follow these four steps to
ensure an enjoyable Louvre experience. 
1.
Buy your tickets in advance. Visitors from the U.S. and Canada can pur-
chase tickets online from www.ticketweb.com and have them deliv-
ered to their homes before departure. Visitors from other countries can use
www.fnac.com or www.ticketnet.com. In France, some Métro sta-
tions have tickets for sale at the window, or you can order tickets by phone
from electronics store FNAC (% 08-92-68-36-22; 0.34€/40¢ per minute),
and pick them up at any FNAC store (except FNAC photo shops). A 1.50€
($2) commission is charged by FNAC. A nearby branch is at Forum des
Halles, 1 rue Pierre Lescure. You can also buy Louvre tickets at Le
Printemps, Galeries Lafayette, Le Bon Marché, and BHV; ask at the infor-
mation desks in these stores.
2.
Avoid the main entrance for quicker entry. The main entrance to the Louvre
is through I.M. Pei’s glass pyramid in the courtyard; pregnant women, vis-
itors with children in strollers, and travelers with disabilities have priority.
You’ll almost always find a long, slow line here, and you can get in faster at
one of the Louvre’s other entrances: at 99 rue de Rivoli, where you take an
escalator downstairs through the Carrousel du Louvre passage filled with
stores; through the Jardins du Carrousel entrance near the Arc de Triomphe
du Carrousel off the courtyard; or the Porte des Lions entrance between
the Jardins du Carrousel and the quai des Tuileries.

Take a guided tour. You can try a 90-minute tour by a museum guide 
(% 01-40-20-52-63) that covers the most popular works and gives you a
quick orientation to the museum’s layout. Times and prices vary, gener-
ally a tour of the most celebrated works is 6.50€ for adults and 4.50€ for
students younger than 26 years of age ($8 and $5). A four-hour audiotour
(5€/$6) can be rented at the entrance to any of the wings.

wing, first floor). On the same floor nearby are two more of the Louvre’s
most famous French paintings: Géricault’s The Raft of Medusa and
Delacroix’s Liberty Guiding the People. Next, visit the Winged Victory and
Michelangelo’s Slaves (both Denon wing, ground floor) before seeing The
Venus de Milo (Sully wing, ground floor). After that, let your own interests
guide you. Consider that only Florence’s Uffizi Gallery rivals the Denon
wing for its Italian Renaissance collection, which includes Raphael’s
Portrait of Balthazar Castiglione and Titian’s Man with a Glove. The
revamped Egyptian-antiquities department is the largest exhibition of
Egyptian antiquities outside Cairo.
Tickets are valid all day so you can enter and exit the museum as many
times as you prefer. Admission is reduced after 6 p.m. on Wednesday and
Friday, and free the first Sunday of each month.

Musée Jacquemart-André
Champs-Elysées (8e)
The combination of an outstanding art collection and a gorgeous 19th-
century mansion makes this museum one of the jewels of Paris and a para-
dise for Renaissance art fans. It’s worth visiting as much for a glimpse of how
filthy-rich Parisians lived in the 19th century as for its Italian and Flemish
masterpieces by Bellini, Botticelli, Carpaccio, Uccello, Rubens, Rembrandt,
and van Eyck. Edouard André, the heir of a prominent banking family, and
his wife, Nélie Jacquemart, a well-known portraitist, commissioned architect
Henri Parent to build their “house” and then set about filling it with French,
Flemish, and Italian paintings, furniture, and tapestries. Highlights of the col-
lection include Rembrandt’s Docteur Tholinx, Van Dyck’s Time Cutting the
Wings of Love, a fresco by Jean Baptiste Tiepolo, Fragonard’s naturalistic
Portrait d’un Vieillard, and a portrait of Catherine Skavronskaia by Elisabeth
Vigée-Lebrun, one of Marie Antoinette’s favorite artists and a fascinating
person in her own right. As you wander the ornate gilt-ridden rooms, pause
in the “winter garden,” a tour de force of marble and mirrors flanking an
unusual double staircase. Adults can take advantage of the free audio narra-
tive that guides you through the mansion. For children, the museum has
organized a special activity: At the beginning of the visit they receive a free
booklet with word mysteries. Using the contents of the museum to solve the
puzzles, aided by clues spread throughout the museum, children will find
the game worthwhile, especially for the surprise! Allow an hour for your visit,
and then take a break in what was Madame Jacquemart’s lofty-ceilinged
dining room, now a tearoom serving light lunches and snacks.

Musée Nationale d’Auguste Rodin
Tour Eiffel and Invalides (7e)
This is one of Paris’s more relaxing museums, a large house with just 16
rooms, surrounded by bucolic gardens. Auguste Rodin, regarded by many
as the greatest sculptor of all time, lived and worked here from 1908 until
his death in 1917. His legendary sensuality, which outraged 19th-century
critics, is expressed here in this collection that includes all of his greatest
works. The Kiss immortalizes in white marble the passion of doomed 13th-
century lovers Paolo Malatesta and Francesca da Rimini. In the courtyard,
Burghers of Calais is a harrowing commemoration of the siege of Calais in
1347, after which the triumphant Edward III of England kept the town’s six
richest burghers as servants. Also in the courtyard is The Thinker. The
Gates of Hell is a portrayal of Dante’s Inferno. Intended for the Musée des
Arts Decoratifs, the massive bronze doors were not completed until seven
years after Rodin’s death. The museum is in the 18th-century Hôtel Biron,
which was a convent before it became a residence for such writers and
artists as Matisse, Jean Cocteau and the poet Rainer Maria Rilke. Spend at
least 90 minutes in the museum. If you don’t have a lot of time or money,
pay the 1€ ($1.30) admission to visit just the gardens, where Rodin’s works
stand among 2,000 rosebushes. Allow at least an hour to visit the garden,
longer if you want to break for coffee in the garden cafe.

tance 1 hour before closing.
Musée Picasso
Le Marais (3e)
This mansion in the Marais houses the world’s largest collection of
Spanish master Pablo Picasso’s art, and you can pay a visit here on each
trip to Paris and see something different each time because the works are
constantly rotated. Located in the renovated Hôtel Salé, which was built in
the mid–17th century for a salt-tax collector (hence the name which trans-
lates as the salted mansion), the museum was created in 1973 by Picasso’s
heirs, who donated his personal art collection to the state in lieu of paying
outrageous inheritance taxes after his death. The spectacular collection
includes more than 200 paintings, almost 160 sculptures, 88 ceramics, and
more than 3,000 prints and drawings — every phase of Picasso’s prolific
75-year career is represented. Works can be viewed chronologically;
budget at least two hours here, if not more. The museum also displays
works by other artists collected by Picasso, including Corot, Cézanne,
Part III: Paris and the Best of the Ile de France 
186

Braque, Rousseau, Matisse, and Renoir. It is best to go early in the morn-
ing, as the narrow corridors in parts of the museum get particularly
crowded during the afternoon.

Panthéon
Latin Quarter (5e)
The Panthéon is to France what Westminster Abbey is to England: a final
resting place for many of the nation’s greatest citizens. Inside the domed
church’s barrel-vaulted crypt are the tombs of Voltaire, Rousseau, Marie
Curie, Hugo, Braille, and Zola. André Malraux was the last to be entombed
here in 1996. Louis XV originally built the Panthéon as a church in thanks-
giving to St-Geneviève after his recovery from gout. Construction started
in 1755, but after the French Revolution, the church was renamed the
Panthéon, in remembrance of ancient Rome’s Pantheon, and rededicated
as a burying ground for France’s heroes. All Christian elements were
removed, and windows were blocked. From 1806 to 1884, officials turned
the Panthéon back into a church two more times before finally declaring
it what it currently is today.

Place des Vosges
Le Marais (4e)
The most beautiful square in Paris sits right in the middle of Le Marais — a
symmetrical block of 36 rose-colored town houses, nine on each side, with
handsome slate roofs and dormer windows. At ground level is a lovely
arcaded walkway that’s now home to galleries, cafes, antiques dealers, and
smart boutiques. In the early 17th century, Henri IV transformed this area
into the most prestigious neighborhood in France, putting his royal palace
here, and the square quickly became the center of courtly parades and fes-
tivities. After the Revolution, it became place de l’Indivisibilité and later place
des Vosges, in honor of the first département in France that completely paid
its taxes. Victor Hugo lived at no. 6 for 16 years. Allow 30 minutes to walk all
the way around the square under the arcades and for a brief stroll in the park.

Ste-Chapelle
Ile de la Cité (4e)
If you save Ste-Chapelle for a sunny day, its 15 perfect stained-glass win-
dows soaring 15m (50 ft.) high to a star-studded vaulted ceiling will take
Chapter 12: Exploring Paris 187

your breath away. You may think you’ve stepped into a kaleidoscope by
mistake. Louis IX, the only French king to become a saint, had Ste-Chapelle
(“Holy Chapel”) built as a shrine to house relics of the crucifixion (includ-
ing the Crown of Thorns that he bought from the Emperor of
Constantinople for a sum more than three times the cost of building the
church itself). It is said that the very expensive relic was acquired at the
Crucifixion and now resides in the vault at Notre-Dame.
Built between 1246 and 1248, Ste-Chapelle has two chapels, one on top of
the other. Palace servants used the chapelle basse (lower chapel), orna-
mented with fleur-de-lis designs. The chapelle haute (upper chapel,
accessed by 30 winding steps) is one of the highest achievements of
Gothic art. If you spend the time (which can take hours or even a day),
you would see that the 1,134 scenes in the stained glass of the 15 windows
trace the Biblical story from the Garden of Eden to the Apocalypse. The
first window to the right represents the story of the Crown of Thorns; Saint
Louis is shown several times. Some evenings, when the upper chapel
becomes a venue for classical-music concerts, the effect of its chandelier
lights dancing off the windows is magical.

Tour Eiffel
Tour Eiffel and Invalides (7e)
Did you know the Tour Eiffel has its own post office? Anything you mail
from here is postmarked with a Tour Eiffel stamp. Did you know the tower
is lit up at night by 336 projectors with bulbs ranging from 150 to 1,000
watts? (Parisians often comment that the final lighting hour is the best one,
because the yellow ambient lighting on the tower’s structure is turned off,
and only the sparkling white lights can be seen.) Gustave Eiffel beat 699
others in a contest to design what was supposed to be a temporary mon-
ument for the Exposition Universelle (World’s Fair) in 1889. Upon com-
pletion, the Tour Eiffel was the tallest human-built structure in the world.
Praised by some and damned by others, the tower created as much con-
troversy in its time as I.M. Pei’s pyramid at the Louvre did 100 years later.
We could fill an entire page with trivia about Paris’s most famous symbol.
(Did you know that it weighs 7,000 tons, soars 321m/1,056 ft., and is held
together with 2.5 million rivets?) But what you really want to know are the
practicalities: Do I have to climb stairs? Do elevators go to the top? Are there
bathrooms? Are there snacks? Can I ascend in a wheelchair?
The tower has three levels that are all accessible by elevator. No elevator
goes directly from ground level to the top; you must change elevators at the
second level. Though you can take stairs from the ground to the first and
second levels, you cannot take stairs from the second level to the top. Most
likely you’ll wait in a roped-off line for elevators on the first and second
levels. In high season, the wait can sometimes be as long an hour — for each
Part III: Paris and the Best of the Ile de France 
188

line. Bathrooms are on each level, and snack bars and souvenir stands are
on the first and second levels. Wheelchair access is available for the second
level but not to the top.
Word of advice: Six million people visit the Tour Eiffel each year. To avoid
loonnnggg lines, go early in the morning or during the off season. If that
isn’t possible, allow at least two hours for your visit: one hour to line up
for tickets and another just to access the elevators on levels one and two.
Food is available at the Altitude 95 restaurant on the first floor, which is
simply gorgeous but overpriced for the quality of its meals. A first-floor
snack bar and a second-floor cafeteria also do not offer the best values.
The best food at the tower is also its most expensive, without a doubt —
the Jules Verne, one of Paris’s most celebrated restaurants, is on the Tour
Eiffel’s second level. If you can get a reservation here, you’ll have spec-
tacular views, exquisite food, and a private entrance to the tower. 
You won’t be able to avoid pesky (and illegal) vendors trying to cajole you
into buying everything from tower key chains to postcards to mechanical
butterflies; they constantly approach tourists standing in line for the Tour
Eiffel admission tickets. Be very attentive — some of these vendors work
in tandem with pickpockets who will rip you off while you’re busy looking
at the displays. As for the quality of the merchandise, it’s pretty bad; buy
your souvenirs from shops and licensed vendors.

Enjoying Paris’s Parks and Gardens
Paris has so many green spaces to visit, from parks for flowers and
plants to parks for admiring views. The beauty and serenity of planted
gardens, splashing fountains, and arrow-straight paths are relaxing, and
your kids will love the puppet shows and pony rides (Jardin de Luxem-
bourg, Bois de Boulogne, Bois de Vincennes). Most parks are open daily
until sunset unless otherwise noted.
The legendary Bois de Boulogne in western Paris (16e) once was a royal
forest and hunting ground. Napoléon III donated it to the city, and Baron
Haussmann transformed it, using London’s Hyde Park as his model. Today
the Bois is a vast reserve of more than 2,200 acres with jogging paths,
bridle trails, bicycling (bike rental available Apr–Oct near the Les Sablons
entrance to the park) and boating on its Lac Inférieur and Lac Supérieur
(boat rental available at the northern edge of the Lac Inférieur). The Long-
champ and Auteuil racecourses are here, and so is the beautiful Pré
Catalan, a garden containing many of the herbs and plants mentioned in
Chapter 12: Exploring Paris 189

Shakespeare’s plays. The rose gardens at the Parc de la Bagatelle are
gorgeous, and the thematic gardens reveal the art of gardening through
the centuries. A water-lily pond even pays homage to a certain famous
painter. The château here, which you can view only from the outside,
was built by Comte d’Artois in 1775, after he made a bet with his sister-
in-law, Marie Antoinette, that he could do it in fewer than 90 days. It took
66 days. Under Napoléon, it was used as a hunting lodge. Take the Métro
to Porte Maillot.
The Bois de Vincennes, on Paris’s far eastern side, was also once a hunt-
ing ground for kings. Today it’s the largest green space in Paris. You can
rent a boat at the two lakes here: Lac Daumesnil, on the west side of the
park has two islands connected by a bridge; Lac des Minimes is located
on the northwestern edge of the Bois. The Bois de Vincennes is home to
the parc Zoologique; a Buddhist center right next to the bridge at Lac
Daumesnil, complete with temple and Buddha effigy; and the Château
de Vincennes, in which early monarchs Charles V and Henri III sought
refuge from war and where Mata Hari was executed in 1917. The Bois de
Vincennes houses the spectacular Parc Floral de Paris, the Hippodrome
de Vincennes for harness racing, and the Aquarium Tropicale de la
Porte Dorée. You can spend an entire afternoon enjoying this park.
The Bois de Boulogne’s Jardin d’Acclimatation (% 01-40-67-90-82) has
an amusement park loved by Parisian children. To get there, take Métro
Line 1 to Les Sablons, and exit on rue d’Orléans; the entrance is about
15m (50 ft.) away. Or take bus No. 43, 73, 82, or 174, or the open-air “Petit
Train,” from the Bois de Boulogne’s Porte Maillot entrance (5.20€/$6.75
round-trip adults, 3.85€/$5 round-trip children and students). Admission
to the Jardin d’Acclimation is 2.70€ ($3.50), free for kids younger than 3.
Open daily 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. (until 7 p.m. June–Sept).
The Parc de Belleville, though a bit out of the way, is a tranquil place to
watch the sun set over western Paris and has one of the best panoramic
views of the city — without the lines. Topped by the Maison de l’Air, a
museum with displays devoted to the air that we breathe, you can enjoy
fountains, a children’s play area, and an open-air theater with many con-
certs during the summer. Rock formations and grottoes evoke the days
when the hill was a strategic point for fighting enemies such as Attila the
Hun. Access the park by taking the rue Piat off rue de Belleville and
enter through an iron gate spelling out the words VILLA OTTOZ. A curved
path leads you to tree-lined promenades (more than 500 trees are here),
with the first of the magnificent Left Bank views peeping through the
spaces between pretty houses. Beds of roses and other seasonal flowers
line walks, and views of the Left Bank become more pronounced the
higher up the terraced pathways you go.
You can also take the Métro to Courrones, cross boulevard de Belleville,
and turn left onto rue Julien Lacroix, where you find another entrance.

Seeing Paris by Guided Tour
If you’re a newcomer to the wonders of Paris, an orientation tour can
help you understand the city’s geography. But even if you’ve been coming
to Paris for ten years or more, one of the various tours can introduce
you to sides of the city you never knew existed. Being lucky enough to
be shown around by guides whose enthusiasm makes the city come to
life can be the high point of your entire trip.
Cruising Paris 
One of the most romantic and beautiful ways to see Paris is to take a
sightseeing cruise up and down the Seine. Ignore too-expensive lunch or
dinner cruises: The food won’t be very good. Instead, opt for an evening
cruise. With its dramatically lit monuments and romantic bridges, Paris
is truly breathtaking at night. And if you really get bitten by the bateaux
bug, additional on-water Paris adventures are available.
Along the Seine
Three companies offer similar tours in the same price range with
recorded commentaries. Perhaps the most well known are the Bateaux-
Mouches that sail from the Right Bank and have huge floodlit boats.
Bateaux-Parisiens sail from the Left Bank, while Vedettes Pont Neuf sail
from the Ile de la Cité. Vedettes boats are smaller, more intimate, and not
all of them are covered. 
 Bateaux-Mouches, pont de l’Alma, Right Bank, 8e (% 01-42-25-96-
10; www.bateaux-mouches.fr; Métro: Alma Marceau). Departures:
In summer high season (approx. Apr–Oct) every 30 minutes from
10 a.m. to 11 p.m.; in winter (Oct–Mar) departures leave from 11
a.m. to 9 p.m. Rates: 8€ ($10) for adults, 4€ ($5.20) for seniors (65
and older) and kids ages 4 to 12, younger than four ride free. 
 Bateaux-Parisiens Tour Eiffel, port de la Bourdonnais, Left Bank,
7e (% 01-44-11-33-44; www.bateauxparisiens.com; Métro: Bir-
Hakeim). Departures: April through September every half-hour
from 10 a.m. to 11 p.m.; October through March every hour from 10
a.m. to 10 p.m. No tours at 1:30 p.m. Rates: 10€ ($13) adults; 5€
($6.50) children ages 4 to 12; free younger than age three.
 Vedettes du Pont-Neuf, square du Vert-Galant, 1er (% 01-46-33-98-
38; www.vedettesdupontneuf.com; Métro: Pont-Neuf), sail from
the riverside where the Pont Neuf crosses the Ile de la Cité. Depar-
tures: March to October at 10 a.m., 11:15 a.m., noon, and then every
half-hour from 1:30 p.m. to 10:30 p.m.; November to February every
45 minutes Monday through Thursday from 10:30 a.m. to noon and
2:00 to 6:30 p.m., and at 8 p.m. and 10 p.m. Saturday and Sunday
tours leave every 45 minutes from 10:30 a.m. to noon, every half
hour from 2:00 p.m. to 6:30 p.m., and at 8 p.m., and every half hour
from 9 p.m. to 10:30 p.m. Rates: 10€ ($13) adults, 5€ ($6.50) chil-
dren younger than age 12. Adult tickets purchased online are dis-
counted 20 percent (8€/$10). 
Chapter 12: Exploring Paris 191

For a boat ride without commentary, take one of the Batobus shuttles
that stop every 25 minutes between 10 a.m. and 4, 7, or 9:30 p.m. depend-
ing on the season. A one-day ticket costs 11€ ($14) adults and 5€ ($6.50)
for children younger than 16, and you can jump off and on when you want.
Through the canals
In addition to the Seine River cruises, try a longer and more unusual
tour with Paris Canal (% 01-42-40-96-97; www.pariscanal.com; Métro:
Bastille). Its three-hour cruises leave the Musée d’Orsay at 9:30 a.m. and
end at Parc de la Villette. The boat passes under the Bastille and enters
the Canal St-Martin for a lazy journey along the tree-lined quai Jemmapes.
You cruise under bridges and through many locks. The boat leaves the
Parc de la Villette at 2:30 p.m. for the same voyage in reverse, in front of
the sign that says FOLIE DES VISITES DU PARC. Reservations are essential. The
trip costs 16€ ($21) for adults, 13€ ($17) for ages 12 to 25 and older
than 60, and 9€ ($12) for children ages 4 to 11.
Canauxrama (% 01-42-39-15-00; www.canauxrama.com; Métro: Jaurès)
offers two-and-a-half-hour tours similar to Paris Canal’s at 9:45 a.m. and
2:30 p.m., leaving from Port l’Arsenal in the 12e and ending at the Parc
de la Villette in the 19e. The cost is 14€ ($18) for adults, 11€ ($14) for
ages 12 to 25, 8€ ($10) for children ages 6 to 11, and free for children
younger than 6. Reservations are required.
Motoring around by bus
Paris’s biggest bus tour company for years has been Cityrama (4 place
des Pyramides, 1er; % 01-44-55-61-00; www.cityrama.fr; Métro: Palais-
Royal–Musée du Louvre). Its 90-minute orientation tour costs 17€ ($22),
8.50€ ($11) for children ages 4 to 11 (children younger than 4 ride for
free). A variety of partial-day and full-day tours also are available, includ-
ing full-day art or history tours (the major artistic and historic sights
including a Seine cruise) for 76€ ($99) adults, 38€ ($49) children. Tours
to Versailles (starting at 39€/$50 adults, 20€/$24 children) and to Chartres
(55€/$72 adults, 28€/$36 children) are a better bargain because they
take the hassle out of visiting these monuments. Nighttime illumination
tours include a Seine boat cruise and start at 32€ ($42) adults and 16€
($21) for children younger than age 12.
Paris l’OpenTour (% 01-42-66-56-56; www.paris-opentour.com), from
Paris’s public transportation system, the RATP, is beginning to give
Cityrama a run for its money. Its bright yellow-and-green convertible
double-decker buses take you to three different areas while you listen to
recorded commentary in English through a set of headphones that are
given to you when you board the bus. The Paris Grand Tour covers
Paris’s most central sights, minus the islands; the Montmartre tour goes
to the Montmartre funiculaire and points north; and the Bastille–Bercy
tour goes east. The OpenTour makes its stops at regular city bus stops
marked with the OpenTour logo. You can board at any of these stops
and buy the pass right on the bus. The pass is also on sale at the Paris
Part III: Paris and the Best of the Ile de France

Tourist Office, at l’OpenTour kiosks near the Malesherbes (8e) and
Anvers (9e) bus stops, at the RATP office at place de la Madeleine (8e),
at the Montmartre tourist office (21 place du Tertre), at some hotels, and
at the main Batobus docks on the Seine. A two-day pass costs 28€ ($36)
adults, 12€ ($16) children ages 4 to 11, and 20€ ($26) for holders of the
Paris Visite pass; you can get on or off the bus as many times as you
want, which, in our opinion, makes this the more worthwhile tour. The
buses run daily every 15 to 30 minutes throughout the year from around
9:15 a.m. to 6:30 p.m.
The RATP also runs the Balabus (% 01-58-76-16-16; www.ratp.fr), a
fleet of orange-and-white buses that operate only on Sundays and holi-
days, noon to 8 p.m. from April to September. Routes run between the
Gare de Lyon and the Grand Arche de La Défense, in both directions, and
cost you just one Métro ticket. The bus has a “Bb” symbol across its side
and on bus stops along its route.
Walking the city streets
French Links (% 01-45-77-01-63; www.frenchlinks.com) is run by
Rachel Kaplan, author of numerous guidebooks about living in Paris,
including the Paris Insider Guides. With French Links, trained, experi-
enced guides with degrees in art and history lead you on such walks 
as “Paris in a Basket Gourmet Market Tour,” “Parisian Art Nouveau,”
“Photographer’s Walking Tour,” and many others; the talks are entertain-
ing and fun. As well, Kaplan can customize a tour for you — anything
from a two-hour walking tour to a full-day cultural extravaganza. Tours
start at $375 for one to six people for two and a half hours. All tours
must be prebooked and prepaid (U.S. bank check or credit card).
Moveable Feast (% 06-66-92-34-12) offers offbeat two-hour guided
walks, such as “Paris is a Woman,” which takes visitors to the haunts
and former residences of some of Paris’s most famous women (Colette,
Josephine Baker, Sarah Bernhardt, Janet Flanner, Gertrude Stein, and
Coco Chanel). “The Belly of Paris” takes aspiring gourmands to Les
Halles (called “the Belly of Paris” by writer Émile Zola), where they
explore restaurants, markets, and the culinary history of Paris. Another
itinerary includes sites from “Medieval Paris.” Tours are 12€ ($16)
adults and 10€ ($13) students and seniors. Call to reserve a place and
find out starting points.
Paris à Pied (% 800-594-9535 in the United States, 01-46-27-11-56 or 06-
64-77-11-56 in Paris; www.parisapied.com) has three-hour tours geared
to first-time visitors. The Minneapolis-based company offers tours that
cost $59 and are limited to eight people. Tours include “The Heart of Old
Paris,” “The Latin Quarter,” “Montmartre,” and “The Marais.”
Paris Walks (% 01-48-09-21-40; www.paris-walks.com) was founded
by Peter and Oriel Caine and has become a popular English-language
outfit supplying guided walks that cost 10€ ($13) for adults, 8€ ($10) for
students younger than 25, and 5€ ($6.50) for children. Specific tours
Chapter 12: Exploring Paris 193

concentrate on a single neighborhood (such as “The Village of Mont-
martre” or “The Historic Marais”), a particular theme (such as “Heming-
way’s Paris”), or a single sight (such as “Les Invalides” or “The Paris
Sewers”). Call for the designated meeting place. Private tours are also
available.
Cycling around Paris
The banks of the Seine are closed to cars and opened to pedestrians and
cyclists March to November each Sunday from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. It may
not make much of a dent in the air quality, but bicycling is a fun and
healthy way to do some sightseeing. For a bike map of Paris, pick up the
Plan Vert from one of the branches of the Paris tourist office.
The RATP (which runs the city’s buses and subways), in partnership
with the mayor’s office, rents bikes through its Roue Libre program. To
rent a bike, you need to leave a 200€ ($260) deposit per bike by trav-
eler’s check or with cash and show a passport or driver’s license; or you
can leave your passport or drivers license with the office as a guarantee
of returning the bike. Without reservations you can show up to the office
and rent a bike for one hour at a rate of 4€ ($5.20), for four hours at a
rate of 10€ ($13). With advance reservations, you can rent by the day
(10€–15€/$13–$20), weekend (27€/$35), or longer. A Roue Libre location
is at 1 passage Mondétour, in front of 120 de la rue Rambuteau, 1er 
(% 01-44-76-08-60-43; Métro: Les Halles); open daily 9 a.m. to 7 p.m.
Three-hour guided bike tours are offered for 25€ ($33), or 20€ ($26) 
for ages 25 and younger. 
Paris à Vélo C’est Sympa (% 01-48-87-60-01; www.parisvelosympa.com;
Métro: Richard Le Noir; meeting place: 22 rue Alphonse-Baudin) offers
three-hour “Heart of Paris” tours at 10 a.m., Friday to Monday from April
to October and on Saturday and Sunday at 10 a.m. November to March.
Reservations are required, and most tours are in French (call or stop in
for times of English-speaking tours). The company also has night (noc-
turne) bike tours Saturday at 8:30 p.m., May to September. Other tours
include “Paris Contrasts,” “Unusual Paris,” and “Paris at Dawn.” Prices
for all tours are 34€ ($44) adults, 28€ ($36) ages 12 to 26, 18€ ($23) ages
10 and 11. Children must be at least 53 inches tall to use the bicycles.
It’s not just bike tours you can take with Fat Tire Bike Tours (24 rue
Edgar-Faure, 15e; % 01-56-58-10-54; www.fattirebiketoursparis.
com), formerly Mike’s Bike Tours. This American-accented outfit con-
ducts tours on the Segway scooter, the first of its kind in Paris (70€/$91
for a four-hour day or night tour). Check the separate Web site (www.
citysegwaytours.com) for details; the company and contact informa-
tion remain the same. Day tours leave daily February 15 through Novem
ber 30 at 10:30 a.m. Night tours run from April 1 through October 31 at
6:30 p.m. There are no tours on the final day of the Tour de France, and
no night tours on June 21 and July 14.

Suggested One-, Two-, and Three-Day
Sightseeing Itineraries
If you’re short on time or have young children with you, you want to
maximize your opportunities to see the best Paris has to offer in the
most efficient way possible. The following itineraries can help you figure
out where to start and what to do. But please feel free to branch out, get
lost (it happens to everyone!), and explore those interesting alleyways
and pretty green spaces you encounter all around you. That’s what’s so
much fun about Paris — it reveals itself in all kinds of ways, making the
trips of each independent visitor different and special.
If you have one day
On Day One, start early by having coffee and croissants at a cafe, or
pick up a pastry at a boulangerie near your hotel to eat on the run. Then
begin at the true center of Paris: Notre-Dame, on the Ile de la Cité. The
cathedral is a great starting point for any tour, and it’s also Paris’s start-
ing point: You are at Kilometre Zéro, from which all distances in France
are measured. From there, take a short walk west to the island’s other
Gothic masterpiece, St-Chapelle, in the Palais de Justice. Afterward,
cross the Seine to the Musée du Louvre on the Right Bank. Select just a
few rooms in a particular collection for your first visit — this is one of
the world’s largest and finest museums, and it would take months to see
everything. Take a well-deserved lunch break in the museum’s comfort-
able Café Marly (see Chapter 11).
From the museum, stroll west through the beautiful Jardin des Tuileries
to the place de la Concorde, with its Egyptian obelisk and fountains.
Continue west up the Champs-Elysées browsing the stores (FNAC and
Virgin Megastore are good places to buy music, and each has a cafe on
the premises if you want to take a break; Zara is good for the latest fash-
ion at low prices) on either side of the avenue until you come to the Arc
de Triomphe. Pay it a visit, then walk south on avenue Marceau on the
south side of the Arc and walk south, or take bus 92 to Alma Marceau,
and board the Bateaux-Mouches for a Seine boat ride. Go back to your
hotel to freshen up for dinner at the restaurant of your choice.
If you have two days
On the first day, follow the itinerary for one day but spend a longer time
at the Louvre. Explore the Left Bank on Day Two. Take the Métro to La
Motte-Picquet-Grenelle, and stop into Monoprix just across the street
for cheap picnic food. Walk northwest along avenue de Suffren until you
reach the Ecole Militaire. Facing the Ecole Militaire is the Eiffel Tower
and its front lawn, the Champs de Mars, where you can spread out to
have a picnic before visiting the Tower. After you climb the tower, head
east on the quai Branly and pay a quick visit to the new Musée du quai
Branly if you’d like to experience the art of traditional cultures of Africa,
East and Southeast Asia, Oceania, Australia and New Zealand, and the
Chapter 12: Exploring Paris 195

American continents. Afterward continue east on quai Branly which
turns into quai d’Orsay until you reach the grounds of Invalides and visit
the gold-topped Église du Dôme (which contains the Tomb of Napoléon).
Admission also includes entrance to the Musée de l’Armée. Across
boulevard des Invalides is the beautiful Musée Nationale d’Auguste
Rodin, where you can enjoy a slow walk around the beautiful gardens
before gazing at the artwork inside. Still have energy? Then walk north
along boulevard des Invalides to the Seine, and head east for quai Ana-
tole France (this is a long walk) and the Musée d’Orsay (you can also
hop on the Métro at Varenne, at the corner of boulevard des Invalides
and Varenne, change to RER Line C, and get off at Musée d’Orsay) to
spend a few hours with the Impressionist masters. Afterward, walk over
to the Métro’s Assemblée Nationale station at the intersection of boule-
vard St-Germain and rue de Lille. Take the Métro two stops to rue du
Bac, and exit onto boulevard St-Germain, making sure to walk in the
direction traffic is heading, all the while browsing in upscale shops and
art galleries. At place St-Germain, look for one of the famous cafes, Café
de Flore or Les Deux Magots (see Chapter 11), and have a well-deserved
drink. When you’ve finished, take rue Bonaparte south (which intersects
St-Germain-des-Près) to Parisians’ favorite park, Jardin du Luxembourg.
Stroll through the park, and exit on the park’s east side at the boulevard
St-Michel gates. Walk north on boulevard St-Michel toward the river. You
will be in the Latin Quarter. The Panthéon is at the top of the hill on rue
Soufflot. Many inexpensive and good restaurants are behind the
Panthéon on rue Mouffetard.
If you have three days
On Day Three, get up early and take the Métro to St-Paul, in the heart 
of the Marais. Head east on rue St-Antoine, then turn north onto rue de
Birague which will take you right to Paris’s oldest square, the aristo-
cratic place des Vosges, bordered by 17th-century town houses. Exit on
rue des Francs-Bourgeois, then turn north onto rue Vieille du Temple
until you see the Musée Picasso. Try to be here when it opens at 9:30,
and allow two hours for your visit. Afterward, double back on rue du
Vieille du Temple to rue des Rosiers, and pick up lunch from Jo Golden-
berg (see Chapter 11). Browse the stores here and head west on rue 
des Francs Bourgeois, which turns into rue Rambuteau. Follow rue
Rambuteau west to rue Beaubourg, where you’ll face the back of Centre
Georges Pompidou. Spend two hours exploring it. Afterward, jump on
the Métro at the Rambuteau station and head for Cimitière Père Lachaise.
Spend the afternoon searching out Père Lachaise’s famous residents
with the 2€ ($2.60) map (it’s the best one) sold outside the gates on
boulevard de Ménilmontant. Afterward, take the Métro’s Line 2 to the
Anvers station. Walk north on rue Tardieu to the base of Sacré-Coeur.
Take the funiculaire (one Métro ticket) to the top, and spend 15 to 20
minutes inside Sacré-Coeur before climbing to its dome. After climbing
down, head behind the church to place du Tertre, which still looks like
an old-fashioned Parisian square, despite artists begging to paint your
picture (some can be quite persuasive, but they’re too expensive, and
it’s better to just politely tell them “non, merci”). Even though the cafes
Part III: Paris and the Best of the Ile de France 
196

are picturesque — and more expensive — save your appetite for Au
Poulbot Gourmet; follow rue Lamarck down the hill to the restaurant.
Shopping the Local Stores
Every first-time visitor to Paris should set aside a little time for shopping
in one of the best shopping cities in the world! Even the window-shopping
is exquisite: Enticing goods are arranged just so in windows — and the
prices are listed! Believe it or not, bargains do exist here. From the toni-
est haute couture shop, to the hidden dêpot-vente (resale shop) selling
last year’s Yves Saint Laurent at fabulously reduced prices, even non-
shoppers find something. We give you an overview of the Parisian shop-
ping scene, providing hints about where to find the bargains, and even
how to get some of your money back.
Taking a look at the shopping scene
The cost of shopping in Paris doesn’t have to be jaw-droppingly expen-
sive. If you plan to spend only at couturiers, then yes, you will be paying
top price. But Paris has many stores selling clothing and goods at prices
comparable to what you’d pay in North America. And you can find items
cheaper in Paris than they are in your hometown: some French and Euro-
pean brands of perfume and cosmetics, shoes, clothing from French-
based companies such as Petit Bateau and Lacoste, French-made porce-
lain, cookware, and glassware. Obviously, you’ll pay more for any name
imported from the United States, such as Donna Karan and Calvin Klein,
and for any souvenirs in areas heavily frequented by tourists. Keep the
following tips in mind for happy hunting.
 Remember the VAT. A 19.6 percent value-added tax (VAT) has been
tacked onto the price of most products, which means that most
things cost less at home. (For details on getting a VAT refund, see
the following section “Getting a refund on the VAT.”)
 Practice selective shopping. Appliances, paper products, house-
wares, computer supplies, electronics, and CDs/DVDs are notori-
ously expensive in France, though the cost of computers is beginning
to come down. To recognize a bargain, it helps to check out the
prices of French products before your trip.
 Christmas (shopping) in July (and Jan). Probably the best time to
find a bargain in Paris is during the government-mandated twice-
annual sales (soldes) in January and July, when merchandise gets
marked down 30 percent to 50 percent or more. (Parisians line up
outside their favorite stores the first days of these sales.) If you can
brave the crowds, you just may find the perfect designer outfit at a
fraction of the retail price.
 Save Sundays for sightseeing. Store hours are Monday through
Saturday from 9 or 9:30 a.m. (sometimes 10 a.m.) to 7 p.m., later on
Thursday evenings, without a break for lunch. Some smaller stores
Chapter 12: Exploring Paris 197

are closed on Monday or Monday mornings and break for lunch for
one to three hours beginning at around 1 p.m., but this is becoming
increasingly rare. Small stores also may be closed for all or part of
August and on some days around Christmas and Easter. Sunday
shopping is gradually making inroads in Paris, but it is limited
mostly to tourist areas. Try the Carrousel du Louvre at the Louvre,
rue de Rivoli across from the Louvre, rue des Francs-Bourgeois in
the Marais, and the Champs-Elysées.
 Be on your best behavior. Politeness is imperative when you shop
in Paris. Always greet the salespeople with “Bonjour, madame” or
“Bonjour, monsieur” when you arrive. Whether you’ve bought any-
thing or not, say, “Merci, au revoir” (thank you, goodbye) when
you’re leaving.
Getting a refund on the VAT
Whenever you spend more than 175€ to 182€ ($228– $237) in a single
store, you’re entitled to a partial refund on the value-added tax (VAT),
also referred to in France as TVA. The refund, however, isn’t automatic.
Food, wine, and tobacco don’t count, and the refund is granted only on
purchases that you take out of the country — not on merchandise that
you ship home. The amount of the refund varies; it’s 12 percent in
Galeries Lafayette and Au Printemps, and it may be anywhere from 15
percent to 18 percent at smaller boutiques.
When applying for a refund, you must show the store clerk your pass-
port to prove your eligibility. You’re then given an export sales docu-
ment (in triplicate — two pink sheets and a green one), which you must
sign, and usually an envelope addressed to the store.
Two private tax refund companies operate in Paris, the bigger Global
Refund (www.globalrefund.com) and Premier Tax Free (www.premier
taxfree.com). When you spend more than 175€ ($228) in a store that
participates in Global Refund’s Europe Tax-Free shopping program (indi-
cated by the Tax-Free sticker in the store’s windows), you’re given a Tax-
Free Shopping Cheque that shows the amount of refund owed to you
when you leave the country. Have this check stamped by a customs offi-
cer in the airport, and then take it to the special Global Refund counter
for an instant refund. Global Refund offices are located within depart-
ment store Galeries Lafayette and in the men’s boutique, Madelios, at 23
bd de la Madeleine, 1er (Métro: Madeleine), in Charles de Gaulle airport
at Terminal 1 departures level, Gate 26, Terminal 2A Gate 5, Terminal 2B
Gate 7, Terminal 2C Gate 5, Terminal 2F Gate 11, and in Terminal 3 on the
Departures level. In Orly Airport, there is only one Global Refund office in
Orly South near the international baggage claim on the departures level. 
It works the same way with Premier Tax Free. Look for Premier Tax Free
stickers in the windows of stores participating in this program, and
spend more than 175€ ($228) to get your refund. Premier Tax Free offices
are located at American Express, 11 rue Scribe, 9e (Métro: Opéra);
Part III: Paris and the Best of the Ile de France 
198

Travelex Opéra, 45 ave de l’ Opéra (Métro: Opéra); at two Travelex
Champs-Elysées locations: 73 and 125 (Métro: Franklin-D-Roosevelt and
Charles de Gaulle–Etoile respectively), in Charles de Gaulle Airport
Terminal 1, Gate 26; and in Orly South on the departures level.
Department stores that cater to foreign visitors, such as Au Printemps
and Galeries Lafayette, have special détaxe areas where clerks prepare
your invoices for you. You must present your passport. Otherwise, when
you leave the country, bring all documents to the airport’s détaxe booth
and have a Customs official stamp them. Enclose the appropriate docu-
ment (the pink one) in the store envelope the clerk provided when you
bought your merchandise, and mail it from the airport from which you
are leaving the European Union. The wait for a refund is anywhere from
one to six months. Travelers leaving from Charles-de-Gaulle Airport can
visit the détaxe refund point in Terminal 1 on the departure level between
Gate 14 and 16; in Terminal 2, Hall B between Doors 6 and 7 near the bag-
gage claim area or in Hall A between Doors 5 and 6; and in Terminal T9,
near the departure gates. At Orly, the détaxe booth is in Orly West
between Halls 3 and 4 on the departures level.
If you’re traveling by train, go to the détaxe area in the station before
boarding because you can’t have your refund documents processed on
the train. Give the three sheets to the Customs official, who stamps
them and returns a pink and a green copy to you. Keep the green copy
and mail the pink copy to the store.
Your reimbursement is either mailed as a check (in euro) or credited to
your credit-card account, which is better, as you may find it difficult to
cash a check for euro in your own country. If you don’t receive your tax
refund within six months, write to the store, giving the date of purchase,
and the location where the forms were given to Customs officials.
Include a photocopy of your green refund sheet.
Visiting the great shopping neighborhoods
The shopping in Paris is among the finest in the world, and you don’t
need beaucoup bucks to afford it. You’ll latch on to great finds for every
taste and dollar amount. Read this section to get a significant head start
on where to go to begin the hunt.
The land of luxe: The 8e
Head for the 8e to see why people around the world in need of a luxury
shopping spree jet to Paris. Nearly every French designer is based on two
streets — avenue Montaigne (Métro: Alma-Marceau, Franklin-D-Roosevelt)
and rue du Faubourg St-Honoré (Métro: Concorde) — where prices of
more than 1,000€ ($1,300) are normal, and snooty sales clerks are par for
the course. You can still have a good time window-shopping here (and get
an idea for what’s in style), even if you don’t have a platinum card. 
Although avenue Montaigne and rue du Faubourg St-Honoré boast 
some of the same big designer names, they are completely different in
Chapter 12: Exploring Paris 199

temperament. Avenue Montaigne is wide, graceful, lined with chestnut
trees, and undeniably hip, attracting the likes of Dolce & Gabbana at no.
22 (% 01-42-25-68-78) and Prada at no. 10 (% 01-53-23-99-40). Other
designers on this street include Céline, 36 av. Montaigne (% 01-56-89-07-
92); Chanel, 42 av. Montaigne (% 01-47-23-74-12); Christian Dior, 30 av.
Montaigne (% 01-40-73-73-73); Escada, 53 av. Montaigne (% 01-42-89-83-
45); Ferragamo, 45 av. Montaigne (% 01-47-23-36-37); Gucci, 60 av. Mon-
taigne (% 01-56-69-80-80); Ungaro, 2 av. Montaigne (% 01-53-57-00-00);
and Valentino, 17 av. Montaigne (% 01-47-23-64-61).
Rue du Faubourg St-Honoré is jammed with shoppers walking along the
small, narrow sidewalks. Begin at the rue Royale intersection and head
west. Prada is located at no. 6 (% 01-58-18-63-30); Yves St-Laurent for
women is at no. 38 (% 01-42-65-74-59), men at no. 32 (% 01-53-05-80-80).
Other designer stores you run across here include Ferragamo, 46 rue 
du Faubourg St-Honoré (% 01-43-12-96-96); Gianni Versace, 54 rue du
Faubourg St-Honoré (% 01-47-42-55-31); La Perla, 20 rue du Faubourg St-
Honoré (% 01-43-12-33-60); Chloé, 56 rue du Faubourg St-Honoré (% 01-
44-94-33-00); Sonia Rykiel, 70 rue du Faubourg St-Honoré (% 01-42-65-
20-81); Pierre Cardin, 59 rue du Faubourg St-Honoré (% 01-42-66-92-25),
and Missoni, 1 rue du Faubourg St-Honoré (% 01-44-51-96-96).
Arty and individual: The 3e and 4e
There’s something for everyone in the Marais: Divide your time between
culture (15 museums are here alone) and commercialism in this beauti-
ful neighborhood crammed with magnificent Renaissance mansions,
artists’ studios, secret courtyards, and some of the most original shops
in the city. Rue des Francs-Bourgeois (Métro: St-Paul or Rambuteau), the
highlight of the area, is full of small shops selling everything from fash-
ion to jewels. And many of its stores are open on Sunday! Rue des Rosiers
(Métro: St-Paul) is a fashion destination in its own right, with hot design-
ers standing shoulder-to-shoulder with Jewish delis. Everything is really
close in the Marais, so don’t be afraid to ramble down the tiniest lane
whenever whim dictates. Part of the fun of this neighborhood is that it’s
such a mixed (shopping) bag.
Marais highlights include Paule Ka, 20 rue Mahler (% 01-40-29-96-03),
for the sort of 1960s clothing made famous by Grace Kelly, Jackie Ona-
ssis, and Audrey Hepburn; Jacenko/Seducteur, 38 rue de Poitou (% 01-
42-71-80-38) for unique menswear, mostly cotton or cotton blend materi-
als that are beautifully tailored and soft to the touch (fitted sport jack-
ets, shirts, and sweaters by the British cotton experts of John Smedle
are just some items); Autour du Monde, 12 rue des Francs-Bourgeois
(% 01-42-77-16-18), a clothing/housewares store with everything from
relaxed and sporty cotton dresses by Bensimon to delicate linen sheets
and inventive tableware; Antik Batik, 8 rue Foin (% 01-48-87-95-95), a
French company just making inroads in the U.S. and featuring clothes
inspired by numerous cultures. You can find African prints and wood
beaded shirts and necklaces, as well as Chinese silk outfits and Indian-
inspired scarves and long-shirt and pants ensembles; Issey Miyake, 3
Part III: Paris and the Best of the Ile de France 
200

place des Vosges (% 01-48-87-01-86), for loose, structured clothing that
screams “artist.” Jean-Claude Monderer, 22 rue des Francs Bourgeois
(% 01-48-04-51-41), sells stylish men’s and women’s sneakers, loafers,
and sleek and often-pointy going-out shoes for both sexes (pointed
shoes have been à la mode in Paris in the last few years). Also check out
Zadig et Voltaire, 16 rue Pavée (% 01-44-59-39-06), for casual clothes
with a flair from new and established European designers.
BCBG bourgeois chic: The 6e
Stylish young professionals with old family (called Bon Chic Bon Genre
or BCBG) call this, one of the prettiest areas in Paris, home. Here you
can shop with the BCBG amid bookstores, art and antiques galleries,
high-end designer-clothing shops, decently priced shoe and accessories
stores, and sophisticated and trendy boutiques. You won’t go thirsty
with famed literary hangouts such as Café de Flore, Les Deux Magots,
and Brasserie Lipp nearby, and you may not even go broke — all price
ranges are represented here.
Louis Vuitton has a huge store behind Les Deux Magots on 6 place St-
Germain (% 01-45-49-62-32), and Christian Dior is nearby at 16–18 rue
de l’Abbaye (% 01-56-24-90-53). Giorgio Armani is at 149 bd. St-Germain
(% 01-45-48-62-15); Céline, 58 rue de Rennes (% 01-45-48-58-55); Chris-
tian Lacroix, 2 place St-Sulpice (% 01-46-33-48-95); or Prada, 5 rue de
Grenelle (% 01-45-48-53-14). Much more pleasing price-wise are Stefanel,
54 rue de Rennes (% 01-45-44-06-07); Comptoir des Cotonniers, 59 rue
de Bonaparte (% 01-43-26-07-56); Et Vous, 69 rue de Rennes (% 01-40-49-
05-10); and Tara Jarmon, 18 rue de Four (% 01-46-33-26-60). If you love
things of the sea, check out Blanc et Bleu, 28 rue de Bonaparte (% 01-44-
07-38-54); their fairly expensive but unique clothing evokes the yacht
club and sailing for anyone who loves boats. 
Gap and other international chain stores have taken up residence in the
Marché St-Germain, at 14 rue Lobineau, a modern shopping mall that’s a
bit out of place in a neighborhood known for bookstores and upscale
boutiques. Visit if you need to experience air-conditioning and use the
restrooms, otherwise don’t waste your time; prices are higher, and the
styles are the same at home.
Young and branché: The 2e
Branché means “plugged in” or “hip” to Paris’s younger fashion crowd and
the 2e is where you head if you are. The area sells a mix of high-fashion
and discount, with Jean-Paul Gaultier in the pretty Galerie Vivienne on one
end and Kookaï Le Stock on the other. The cheapest shopping is in the
Sentier area, around the Sentier Métro stop, which is Paris’s garment dis-
trict, overlapping parts of the 3e and 1er. Prostitutes frequent the area
later in the day and evening. The best, but not the cheapest, shops are
found within a square formed on the south by rue Rambuteau, on the west
by rue du Louvre, on the north by rue Réamur, and on the east by rue St-
Martin. This is where you can find hip secondhand clothes, funky club-
wear, and “stock” boutiques selling last season’s designs at a discount.
Chapter 12: Exploring Paris 201

For last year’s unsold stock of women’s and teen’s clothing visit Kookaï
Le Stock, 82 rue Réamur, 2e (% 01-45-08-93-69). Kiliwatch, 64 rue Tique-
tonne, 2e (% 01-42-21-17-37), sells the cool looks of up-and-coming
designers mixed in with vintage clothing, though none of it is a bargain
in this large and spread-out space, while the Paris branch of London
store Kokon To Zai, 48 rue Tiquetonne, 2e (% 01-42-36-92-41), sells
funky designerwear in a small store that dazzles with mirrors and neon.
Le Shop, 3 rue d’Argout, 2e (% 01-40-28-18-38), sells two floors of club-
wear, skateboards, and CDs — all to tunes spun by a DJ. Those with a
more sophisticated palate can go to Barbara Bui, 23 rue Etienne-Marcel,
1er (% 01-40-26-43-65), for elegant, contemporary fashion. Youthful and
fresh, but still respectably fashionable for men is Chevignon, 26 rue
Etienne Marcel, 1e (% 01-42-33-60-20). For sophistication with an edge,
head to Jean-Paul Gaultier, 6 rue Vivienne (% 01-42-86-05-05). Find
men’s, women’s, and children’s clothes at agnès b at 2, 3, 6, and 19 rue
du Jour (% 01-40-39-96-88, 01-42-33-04-13, 01-45-08-56-56, and 01-42-33-27-
34 respectively). The stores are minimalist and designs are timelessly
chic with plenty of black clothes for the whole family (the men’s store is
at no. 3, children’s at no. 2, women’s at no. 6, and accessories at no. 19).
Sampling the city’s department stores
Two of Paris’s major department stores, Au Printemps and Galeries
Lafayette, offer visitors a 10 percent discount coupon, good in most
departments. If your hotel or travel agent doesn’t give you one of these
coupons (they’re sometimes attached to a city map), you can ask for
them at the stores’ welcome desks; the clerks speak English.
Le Bon Marché (24 rue de Sèvres, 7e; % 01-44-39-80-00; Métro: Sèvres-
Babylone) is Paris’s only Left Bank department store, and it’s a wonderful
respite from the multibuilding, crowded shopping experience of Au
Printemps and Galeries Lafayette. Elegant, but small enough to be man-
ageable, much of this store’s merchandise is exquisite and includes
designers such as Vivienne Westwood, Burberry, and Yohji Yamamoto.
The third floor is particularly renowned for its large shoe selection and
grand lingerie department (where dressing rooms have phones to
summon your salesperson). The basement features a beautiful bookstore
and upscale toys as well. Nothing here is cheap. Make sure to visit Le
Grand Épicerie next door (is there anything you can’t get at Le Bon
Marché?), where you can buy everything from toilet paper to truffles.
Upstairs at Le Grand Épicerie, a cafe, Delicabar, offers a menu divided into
tasty sweet and salty offerings, while the Café de la Grand Épicerie on the
second floor in the home décor section, features selections chosen by the
gourmet grocery store’s food, wine, and pastry professionals.
Au Printemps (64 bd. Haussmann, 9e; % 01-42-82-50-00; Métro: Havre-
Caumartin) is one of Paris’s largest department stores, and a recent 
renovation costing millions of euros has made it into one of Paris’s best.
Merchandise is sold in three different buildings: Printemps de l’Homme
(menswear), Printemps de la Maison (furniture and accessories), and
Printemps de la Mode (women and children’s fashion). Designers
Part III: Paris and the Best of the Ile de France 
202

include Dolce & Gabbana, Armani, and Burberry. Fashion shows are
staged under the 1920s glass dome at 10 a.m. every Tuesday year-round.
Near the Marais, BHV (Bazar de l’Hôtel de Ville; 52 rue de Rivoli, 1er; 
% 01-42-74-90-00; Métro: Hôtel de Ville) sells the usual clothing, cos-
metics, luggage, and leatherware at decent prices, but it’s really worth 
a visit for its giant basement-level hardware store with everything you
need to fix up your home and a cafe (decorated like a tool shed) 
serving light bites.
Of the three major Paris department stores, Galeries Lafayette (40 bd.
Haussmann, 9e; % 01-42-82-34-56; Métro: Opéra or Chaussée-d’Antin) is
probably the most-visited by a hair due to its prolific advertising. In fact,
it gets downright crowded, and if you visit during the sales, you’ll be
thoroughly fatigued. Fortunately, choices for refreshment abound from
Ladurée tea salon to burgers to the self-serve Lafayette Café on the sixth
floor, which also has panoramic views of Paris. Merchandise runs from
good quality to couture, and excellent deals can be had during the sales:
Look for women’s clothing from Comptoir des Cotonniers, Escada, and
agnès b and for the gourmet grocery store, Lafayette Gourmet, in the
men’s store.
Alas! Parisians have been upset for over a year now at the temporary
closing of their beloved shopping destination, La Samaritaine (19 rue de
la Monnaie, 1er; % 08-00-01-00-15; Métro: Pont-Neuf or Châtelet–Les
Halles), with its arguably perfect rooftop view of Paris, and an important
1920s architectural monument in its own right. The store closed in June
2005 after its president announced that the building had become, in its
advanced age, a serious fire risk. It will remain closed for around five
more years (estimates and official announcements dance around four to
six years); all of the electrical systems, plumbing, and fire system will be
completely renovated. 
Clothing is low-priced and stylish at Monoprix (various locations; % 08-
10-08-40-00), and the stores also are good for accessories, low-priced
cosmetics, lingerie, and housewares. Many locations also have large gro-
cery stores.
For the most part, Tati (4 bd. Rochechouart, 18e; % 01-55-29-50-00;
Métro: Barbés-Rochechouart) is tacky. But you never know what you
may find here if you dig; the occasional gem awaits those who are per-
sistent. Other branches are located at 68 av. du Maine (% 01-43-57-92-
80; Métro: Gaîté), 30 av. d’Italie (% 01-56-80-06-80; Métro: Place d’Italie),
and 76 av. Clichy, 17e (% 01-58-22-28-90; Métro: La Fourche).
Checking out the city’s flea and flower markets
The prettiest of the markets is the Marché aux Fleurs, 4e (Métro: Cité),
the flower market on place Louis-Lépine on Ile de la Cité. Visit Monday
to Saturday to enjoy the flowers, even if you don’t buy anything. On
Sunday, the market becomes the Marché aux Oiseaux, selling birds and
Chapter 12: Exploring Paris 203

more unusual creatures, including hedgehogs, skunks, raccoons, ferrets,
mice, guinea pigs, and rabbits. If you don’t mind seeing creatures in
cages, it can be quite interesting.
An option for Saturday, Sunday, or Monday (open 9 a.m.–8 p.m.), the huge
Marché aux Puces de la Porte de St-Ouen, 18e (Métro: Porte-de-Clignan-
court), is said to be the largest flea market in the world. It features sev-
eral thousand stalls, carts, shops, and vendors selling everything from
vintage clothing to antique chandeliers, paintings, furniture, and toys. 
It’s a real shopping adventure, and you need to arrive early to snag the
deals — if you can find any. The best times for bargains are at opening
time and just before closing.
Don’t pay the ticketed price or the price the vendor first quotes you;
always haggle. You can usually get at least 10 percent off. Most flea 
markets accept cash only, and you don’t have to pay any VAT on your
purchases.
You’ll see stalls selling cheap junk starting at the underpass just past 
the Clignancourt Métro stop. Watch out for pickpockets, and don’t stop
here. Turn left onto rue des Rosiers, the market’s main street.
Visitors to Paris usually choose the Clignancourt market over the con-
vivial market at Porte de Vanves, 14e (Métro: Porte de Vanves), a gem
waiting to be discovered. Probably the smallest of the fleas, and a bit
more upscale (so are its prices), it’s a good place to browse among
friendly dealers. Open Saturday and Sunday 8:30 a.m. to 1 p.m.
What to look for and where to find it
From antiques to wine (okay, so not quite A to Z), here are some great
stores representing both economy and first-class shopping in Paris.
Antiques
Le Louvre des Antiquaires (2 place du Palais-Royal, 1er; % 01-42-97-27-
27; Métro: Palais-Royal–Musée du Louvre) is an enormous mall filled
with all kinds of shops selling everything from Jean Cocteau sketches to
silver cutlery. Items are pricey, but some good deals exist here. A cafe
and toilets are located on the second floor.
Le Village St-Paul (23–27 rue St-Paul, 4e; no phone; Métro: St-Paul), a
secluded 17th-century village (it’s in a courtyard) has been turned into
an indoor-outdoor arts and antiques fair with shops that display paint-
ings, antiques, and other items both inside and in the courtyard. It’s
easy to walk past the entrances, so look for the signs just inside the
narrow passageways between the houses on rue St-Paul, rue Jardins St-
Paul, and rue Charlemagne. Keep in mind that this is a very popular des-
tination on the weekend. Closed Tuesday and Wednesday.

Books
Les Bouquinistes are the booksellers hawking posters, postcards, and
used books from green wooden boxes on some of the Seine’s quays.
Many of these merchants come from a long line of booksellers dating
back to the time of Henri IV in the 17th century and their merchandise is
definitely worth a browse.
Gibert Joseph (26, 30 bd. St-Michel, 6e; % 01-44-41-88-88; Métro: Odéon
or Cluny–La Sorbonne) is the Parisian students’ bookstore, selling new
and secondhand books, records, videos, and stationery on several floors
and in several branches on boulevard St-Michel. If you’re looking to
learn some basic French vocabulary or grammar, there are small prac-
tice textbooks for English-speakers at rock-bottom prices. Late September
can get very crowded when students at some of the nearby colleges
come to buy their textbooks.
Librarie La Hune (170 bd. St-Germain, 6e; % 01-45-48-35-85; Métro: St-
Germain-des-Prés) is sandwiched between cafes Les Deux Magots and de
Flore. This bookstore has been a center for Left Bank intellectuals since
1945, when Sartre was among its clients. Most books are in French. It’s
open until midnight every night but Sunday.
Founded by Canadian bookseller Penelope Fletcher Le Masson in 2001,
The Red Wheelbarrow (22 rue St-Paul, 4e; % 01-48-04-75-08; Métro: St-
Paul) is a cozy English-language bookstore not far from Le Village St-Paul
(see “Antiques,” above) that stocks primarily contemporary and classic
literature, with novels translated from French, general nonfiction, includ-
ing a wide range of Paris- and France-related titles, and an extensive chil-
dren’s section. They also carry some French-English bilingual books and
stories set in France.
Shakespeare and Company (37 rue de la Bûcherie, 5e; % 01-43-26-96-
50; Métro or RER: St-Michel). No, this isn’t the original (that was on rue
l’Odéon), but English-speaking residents of Paris and backpackers still
gather in this wonderfully dark and cluttered store, named after Sylvia
Beach’s legendary literary lair and run more and more these days by
owner George Whitman’s daughter, Sylvia Beach Whitman. There is a
selection of new books, but most books are used. Backpackers and will-
ing travelers can sleep in beds among the stacks, while working during
the day to pay for a good night’s sleep.
Quality fiction in English is the highlight of the Village Voice (6 rue
Princesse, 6e; % 01-46-33-36-47; Métro: Mabillon or St-Germain-des-
Prés), a small two-level store in St-Germain-des-Prés, along with an excel-
lent selection of poetry, plays, nonfiction, and literary magazines. Owner
Odile Hellier has played host to free poetry and prose readings with
authors and poets since 1982.
Chapter 12: Exploring Paris 205

Children’s clothing
Du Pareil au Même (168 bd. St-Germain, 6e; % 01-46-33-87-85) is the
store to buy clothes for every child on your list — apparel is practical,
très mignons (very cute), and reasonably priced. Other branches include
1 rue St-Denis, 1er (% 01-42-36-07-57), and 14 rue St-Placide, 6e (% 01-
45-44-04-40).
When BCBG women (see “BCBG bourgeois chic: The 6e,” earlier in this
chapter) have kids, Jacadi (256 bd. St-Germain, 7e; % 01-42-84-30-40) is
where they buy their very proper children’s clothes. Many branches are
located all across the city, including 1 bd. des Capucines, 2e (% 01-44-
51-76-41).
Part of a French chain with a dozen stores in Paris, Natalys (92 av. des
Champs-Elysées, 8e; % 01-43-59-17-65; Métro: Franklin-D-Roosevelt)
sells children’s wear, maternity wear, and related products. Other
branches include 69 rue de Clichy, 9e (% 01-48-74-07-44) and 47 rue 
de Sèvres, 6e (% 01-45-48-77-12).
Petit Bateau (24 rue Cler, 7e; % 01-47-05-18-51. Métro: La Tour-
Maubourg) is a widespread children’s brand (that adult females have
discovered in droves — their teen-size T-shirts are form-fitting and
preppy-cute). The brand features very cute (and somewhat expensive)
clothing using simple patterns and color pairings to give a sense of
delightful and well-made simplicity. 
Tartine et Chocolat (105 rue du Faubourg St-Honoré, 8e; % 01-45-62-
44-04; Metro: St-Philippe du Roule) has typically French, precious, and
pricey clothes. Another branch is located at 266 bd. St-Germain, 7e 
(% 01-45-56-10-45).
Crystal and glassware
Baccarat (11 place des Etats-Unis, 16e; % 01-40-22-11-10; Métro: Bois-
sière) crystal has been world-renowned since the 18th century. Although
the prices are too high, feel free to browse the collections that include
perfume bottles, 19th- and 20th-century glassware, and coats of arms.
La Maison Ivre (38 rue Jacob, 6e; % 01-42-60-01-85; Métro: St-Germain-
des-Prés) carries an excellent selection of handmade pottery from
across France, with an emphasis on Provençal and southern French
ceramics. You can find splendid pieces of ovenware, bowls, platters,
plates, pitchers, mugs, and vases here.
Lumicristal (22 bis rue de Paradis, 10e; % 01-47-70-27-97; Métro:
Château-d’Eau, Poissonnière, or Gare-de-l’Est) discounts crystal by
Daum, Limoges, and Baccarat.

Housewares
Find bright and affordable kitchen implements, such as magnetized salt-
shakers, pepper shakers, and wine openers that look a tad, well, human,
at Alessi (31 rue Boissy d’Anglas, 8e; % 01-42-66-14-61; Métro: Madéleine
or Concorde). You’ll also find some cutlery, dishes, and linens.
Cedre Rouge (116 rue du Bac, 6e; % 01-42-84-84-00; Métro: Sèvres-
Babylone or rue du Bac) sells that urban rustic look made with natural
materials for apartment, country home, and garden. It isn’t cheap, but
you’ll find some unusual gifts. Finds include Tuscan pottery, Irish linen
tablecloths and napkins, Murano glass, teak and wicker furniture, and
beeswax candles.
Conforama (2 rue de Pont-Neuf, 1er; % 01-42-33-78-58; Métro: Pont-
Neuf) is a giant seller of everything for your home at reasonable prices:
furniture, appliances, garden tools and accessories, and everyday china
and glass.
Cooks love Déhillerin (18–20 rue Coquillière, 1er; % 01-42-36-53-13;
Métro: Les Halles), with its discounted prices for high-quality copper
cookware, dishes, china, gadgets, pots, and appliances.
Verrerie des Halles (15 rue du Louvre, 1er; % 01-42-36-80-60; Métro:
Louvre-Rivoli) sells china and glassware made for restaurants at dis-
count prices.
Jewelry and collectibles 
Biche de Bère (16 rue des Innocents, 1er; % 01-40-28-94-47; Métro:
Châtelet) has chunky and unusual jewelry in sterling silver and gold plate.
Bijoux Burma (50 rue François, 1er, 8e; % 01-47-23-70-93; Métro:
Franklin-D-Roosevelt) has some of the best costume jewelry in the city,
the secret weapon of many a Parisian woman. It also has a branch at 8
bd. des Capucines (% 01-42-66-27-09).
Eric et Lydie (7 passage du Grand Cerf, 2e; % 01-40-26-52-59; Métro:
Etienne-Marcel), in the arty Passage du Grand Cerf, contains unusual,
beautiful, and reasonably priced costume jewelry, hair ornaments, and
other accessories.
Kazana (15 rue Vielle du Temple, 4e; % 01-42-78-20-38; Métro: Hôtel de
Ville) will undoubtedly provide something fun and colorful for the funky,
big-earring-wearing, fashionable pseudo-hippie in your life. This small
fashion accessory shop sells colorful scarves (some handmade in Central
America) and a huge assortment of large and small dangly earrings made
from wood, metal, and shiny seashells, among many other items.
Monic (5 rue des Francs-Bourgeois, 4e; % 01-42-72-39-15; Métro: St-
Paul) in the Marais — open Sunday afternoons — sells a wide range of
affordable costume jewelry and designer creations.
Chapter 12: Exploring Paris 207

Pylones (57 rue de St-Louis-en-l’Ile, 4e; % 01-46-34-05-02; Métro: Pont-
Marie) offers collectibles from The Simpsons, children’s umbrellas that
stand on their own, bicycle bells shaped like ladybugs, pastel colored
toasters, and a variety of other unusual gift items. It’s a fun place to
browse. Also at 7 rue Tardieu, 18e (% 01-46-06-37-00).
Men’s clothing 
Celio (66 bd. du Montparnasse, 14e; % 01-45-38-90-03; Métro: Montpar-
nasse-Bienvenue), is facetiously called “the French Gap,” a reference to
both their prices and menswear styles — shirts, polos, button-fly pants,
etc. — basically everything that Gap sells but with a French twist (the
pants are tighter, for starters). Celio has over 20 locations in Paris, but
some carry limited lines of their wares. Listed here are two of the bigger
ones: 65 rue de Rivoli, 1e (% 01-42-21-18-04), and 4 rue Halèvy, 9e 
(% 01-42-68-30-60).
With quality shirts in nearly every color imaginable, Façonnable (9 rue
du Faubourg St-Honoré, 8e; % 01-47-42-72-60; Métro: Madeleine) also
sells casual pants, jackets, suits, and other men’s furnishings (all a bit on
the conservative side). Another branch is located at 174 bd. St-Germain,
6e (% 01-40-49-02-47).
Madelios (23 bd. de la Madeleine, 1er; % 01-53-45-00-00) offers one-stop
shopping for men, selling everything from overcoats to lighters. If com-
panions get bored waiting, the store is part of a small mall that has some
pleasant shops for browsing.
Specialty foods
Fauchon (26 place Madeleine, 8e; % 01-70-39-38-00; Métro: Madeleine)
is a large gourmet store stocked with signature pink-labeled cans of
coffee, caviar, foie gras, biscuits, wines, oils, candy, and pastries. Split
into two parts, one section carries the many prepackaged gourmet
delights, clearly meant to be gifts; the other carries staples. It isn’t nec-
essarily a good value, but visiting is worth it if only for the store’s long
history. 
Hediard (21 place Madeleine, 8e; % 01-43-12-88-88; Métro: Madeleine),
with branches all across the city, is Fauchon’s rival; it sells most of the
same products, though slightly cheaper than Fauchon, and has good hot
and cold prepared food.
La Grande Epicerie de Paris (at Le Bon Marché, 38 rue de Sèvres, 7e; 
% 01-44-39-81-00; Métro: Sèvres-Babylone), although not cheap, is one
of the best luxury supermarkets in Paris and a great place to look for
gourmet gifts, such as olive oils, homemade chocolates, fresh pastas and
wine. Food is artfully arranged in glass cases and the produce is some of
the freshest around. It makes for wonderful one-stop picnic shopping,
too, offering a wide array of prepared foods and cheeses and terrific
snack food, some of it from the U.S.

208

Each candy at La Maison du Chocolat (225 rue du Faubourg St-Honoré,
8e; % 01-42-27-39-44; Métro: Ternes) is made from a blend of as many as
six kinds of South American and African chocolate, flavored with just
about everything imaginable. We feel guilty even referring to it as candy.
All the merchandise is made on the premises. If the smell doesn’t lure
you in, the windows will. During the summer, ice cream is served in front
of the store by a young guy in a full suit and tie.
La Maison du Miel (24 rue Vignon, 9e; % 01-47-42-26-70; Métro:
Madeleine or Havre-Caumartin) sells varieties of honey you never
dreamed possible (pine tree, for example), identified according to the
flower to which the bees were exposed.
Toys and games
For more than 150 years, Au Nain Bleu (408 rue St-Honoré, 8e; % 01-42-
60-39-01; Métro: Concorde or Madeleine) has been selling toy soldiers,
stuffed animals, games, and puppets. More modern toys also are on
hand, including airplanes and model cars.
In addition to the books, videos, and music for children, FNAC Eveil &
Jeux (19 rue Vavin, 6e; % 01-56-24-03-46; Métro: Vavin) has story hours
and activities for its young guests.
Floor 4 of the Galeries Lafayette main store (40 bd. Haussman, 9e; % 01-
56-24-03-46; Métro: Havre-Caumartin, Chaussée-d’Antin-La Fayette,
Opéra, Trinité) is devoted to toys and children’s clothing. And you’ll 
find a play area that your kids will love.
Wines
Legrand Filles et Fils (1 rue de la Banque, 2e; % 01-42-60-07-12; Métro:
Bourse) stocks fine wines, brandies, chocolates, coffees, and oenophile
paraphernalia and conducts wine tastings one night a week.
Les Caves Augé (116 bd. Haussmann, 8e; % 01-45-22-16-97; Métro: St-
Augustin), the oldest wine shop in Paris, has a sommelier on site.
The flagship store of the Nicolas chain (31 place de la Madeleine, 8e; 
% 01-42-68-00-16; Métro: Madeleine), with more than 250 branches in
and around Paris, offers good prices for bottles you may not be able to
find in the United States.
Women’s clothing
1-2-3 (146 rue de Rivoli, 1er; % 01-40-20-97-01; Métro: Louvre-Rivoli)
sells stylish women’s suits, blouses, and sweaters, most in synthetics,
and accessories at moderate prices. Other branches include 30 av. Italie,
13e (% 01-45-80-02-88).
Cacharel (64 rue Bonaparte, 6e; % 01-40-46-00-45) is known for its
beautiful and reasonably priced women’s, children’s, and men’s clothes,
some in pretty Liberty of London flower-printed fabrics.
Chapter 12: Exploring Paris 209

Colette (213 rue St-Honoré, 1er; % 01-55-35-33-90; Métro: Tuileries) has
some of the city’s most cutting-edge fashion in très artistic displays.
Bring your platinum credit card.
Merchandise is mostly made from synthetic or synthetic blend fabrics at
Etam (9 bd. St-Michel, 5e; % 01-43-54-79-20; Métro: St-Michel), but the
fashions are recent, and the stores are everywhere. The Etam lingerie
store at 135 rue de Rennes, 6e (% 01-45-44-16-88), has some pretty and
affordable nightclothes and underwear.
You can find some nice young and modern styles at La City (37 rue
Chaussée d’Antin, 9e; % 01-48-74-41-00; Métro: Chaussée d’Antin), and
though everything is synthetic, the prices are reasonable. Other
branches are located in the Les Halles shopping mall, 1er (% 01-40-
13-00-83), and 5 bis rue St-Placide, 6e (% 01-42-84-32-84).
Shoe Bizz (42 rue Dragon, 6e; % 01-45-44-91-70; Métro: St-Germain-des-
Prés) carries the latest fashions for your feet at budget-friendly prices.
Another branch is at 48 rue de Beaubourg, 3e (% 01-48-87-12-73).
Young adult clothing
Brightly painted Antoine et Lili (95 quai Valmy, 10e; % 01-40-37-41-55;
Métro: Gare de l’Est) is a good place to stop if you’re strolling the quays
of the Canal St-Martin; it sells fun bohemian-style clothes and accessories
and decorations. A garden and a small “canteen” are also here. Another
branch is at 51 rue des Francs Bourgeois, 4e (% 01-42-72-26-60). 
Cop-Copine (80 rue Rambuteau, 2e; % 01-40-28-49-72; Métro: Les Halles;
RER: Châtelet–Les Halles) sells cutting-edge and flattering fashion. Its
youthful clothes look good on everyone.
H & M (120 rue de Rivoli, 1er; % 01-55-34-96-86; Métro: Hôtel-de-Ville,
Louvre-Rivoli), the Swedish “IKEA of fashion,” has a large selection of up-
to-the-minute men’s and women’s fashions at low prices.
Mango (82 rue de Rivoli, 1er; % 01-44-59-80-37; Métro: Hôtel-de-Ville,
Louvre-Rivoli), with stores all across Paris, is popular with young Parisian
women for its inexpensive, fashion-conscious, body-hugging clothes.
Zara (128 rue de Rivoli, 1er; % 01-44-54-20-42; Métro: Hôtel-de-Ville,
Louvre-Rivoli) offers well-made copies of today’s hottest styles for
women, men, and children at extremely low prices. Locations are all
over the place, including 45 rue de Rennes, 6e (% 01-44-39-03-50), and
44 av. Champs-Elysées (% 01-45-61-52-81).
Living It Up after Dark
Paris may not be a city that never sleeps, but it’s just as fabulous after
the sun sets as it is during the day. Take your pick of French-language,
Part III: Paris and the Best of the Ile de France 
210

English-language, and avant-garde theater productions or ballet, opera,
and symphony. But keep in mind that events can sell out quickly.
Whether you want to spend the evening talking over cocktails, chatting
up the beautiful people, or dancing till you drop, Paris affords plenty of
opportunities to paint the town rouge. Clubs are everywhere, in old wine
cellars to barges on the Seine. You can always check out the overpriced
cancan cabaret spectacles at venues such as the Moulin Rouge, the Lido,
and the Crazy Horse — though Parisians wouldn’t be caught dead at
’em, they still draw plenty of healthy business from visitors.
This is the city that nurtured expats James Joyce, Eugene Ionescu and
Samuel Beckett, gave the world playwrights Molière, Victor Hugo, Pierre
Corneille, and Jean Racine, and produced actors Sarah Bernhardt and
Antonin Artaud. Fortunately for visitors, you don’t need to understand
French to take in an evening of culture here. There’s a flourishing
English-language theater scene, and cutting-edge theater productions
with scope and visuals that make language secondary!
The performing arts
Several local publications provide up-to-the-minute listings of perform-
ances and other evening entertainment. Pariscope: Une Semaine de Paris
(.40€/50¢) is a weekly guide with thorough listings of movies, plays,
ballet, art exhibits, clubs, and more. It can be found at any newsstand.
L’Officiel des Spectacles (.35€/45¢) is another weekly guide in French.
Paris Nuit (3.05€/$4) is a French monthly that contains good articles 
and listings. You can pick up the free music monthlies, La Terrasse and
Cadences, outside concert venues. The Paris Free Voice is a free monthly
publication that spotlights events of interest to English speakers, includ-
ing poetry readings, plays, and literary evenings at English-language
bookstores and libraries. You can find it at cybercafes and English-
language bookstores, or at www.parisvoice.com.
Classical and organ concerts
More than a dozen Parisian churches regularly schedule relatively inex-
pensive organ recitals and concerts. The most glorious, where the music
is nearly outdone by the gorgeous stained-glass windows, is Ste-Chapelle,
4 bd. du Palais, 1e (% 01-44-07-12-38; Métro: Cité). Concerts take place
every day at 7 p.m. and 8:30 p.m. You can also hear music at St-Eustache,
1 rue Montmartre, 1er (% 01-42-36-31-05; Métro: Les Halles); St-Sulpice,
place St-Sulpice (% 01-46-33-21-78; Métro: St-Sulpice), which has an
amazing eight-columned pipe organ, concerts on most Sundays at 4 p.m.;
St-Germain-des-Prés, place St-Germain (% 01-55-42-81-33; Métro: St-
Germain-des-Prés); the Madeleine, place de la Madeleine (% 01-42-64-
83-16; Métro: Madeleine); and St-Louis en l’Ile, 19 rue St-Louis-en-l’Ile
(% 01-44-62-00-55; Métro: Pont-Marie). In a less magnificent setting, the
Sunday concerts at the American Church, 65 quai d’Orsay (% 01-40-62-
05-00; Métro: Invalides or Alma-Marceau), are friendly and inviting and
take place at 5 p.m. from September to June. Maison de la Radio, 116 av.
Chapter 12: Exploring Paris 211

du President-Kennedy, 16e (% 01-56-40-12-12; Métro: Kennedy–Radio
France), offers free tickets to recordings of some concerts. Tickets are
available on the spot an hour before the recording starts. The Conser-
vatoire National Superieur de Musique at the Cité de la Musique, 
209 av. Jean Jaurés, 19e (% 01-40-40-45-45; Métro: Porte de Pantin), 
also stages free concerts and ballets performed by students at the 
conservatory.
Paris’s main concert hall is the Salle Pleyel, 252 rue du Faubourg-St-
Honoré, 8e (% 01-42-56-13-13), home to the Orchestre de Paris, and
gives 50 concerts in its programming. The orchestra is directed by
Christoph Eschenbach. Tickets range from 10€ to 130€ ($13–$169);
senior citizens and people younger than 27 can get go an hour before
and fill in any free seats for just 10€ ($13). Reservations are best made
by phone, Monday to Friday 10 a.m. to 6 p.m.
Opera and ballet
At Châtelet, Théâtre Musical de Paris, 1 place du Châtelet, 1e (% 01-
40-28-28-00; www.chatelet-theatre.com; Métro: Châtelet), tickets for
opera and ballet are 10€ to 120€ ($13–$156). The box office is open
daily from 11 a.m. to 7 p.m. To make reservations by phone, call between
10 a.m. and 7 p.m. daily. There is a 2.50€ ($3.25) surcharge for Internet
and phone reservations.
You can see the national opera and ballet troupes perform at both the
radiant Palais Garnier, place de l’Opéra, 9e (% 01-72-28-35-35 from
abroad or 08-92-89-90-90 [.35€/40¢ per minute] for reservations; www.
opera-de-paris.fr; Métro: Opéra; RER: Auber), and the ultramodern
Opéra National de Bastille (see below). The Palais Garnier conducts
more ballet performances, and the Opéra Bastille puts on more opera.
Tickets at the Palais Garnier are priced from 7€ ($8.40) for seats that
have little or no visibility to 300€ ($360) for the first row of the balcony.
Reserve by phone up to four weeks in advance, and buy at the ticket
windows for same-day and performances up to 14 days in advance. A 3€
($3.90) surcharge is added for reservations made online and by phone.
The box office is open Monday to Saturday 9 a.m. to 6 p.m.
The Opéra National de la Bastille, 120 rue de Lyon (% 08-92-89-90-90;
Fax: 01-40-01-25-60; www.opera-de-paris.fr; Métro: Bastille), offers
first-class comfort and splendid acoustics at each level of the auditorium,
though Parisians still think the building is a badly designed eyesore. The
opera house is located at the place de la Bastille; at night, young adults
crowd the steps, showing off skateboard moves, talking on cellphones,
and flirting. Tickets cost between 5€ ($6.50) for reduced and no-visibility
seats to 150€ ($195) for the front rows of orchestra and balcony seating.
Reserve by phone up to four weeks in advance, and buy at the ticket win-
dows for same-day and performances up to 14 days in advance. Expect a
3€ ($3.90) surcharge for reservations made online and by phone. The
box office is open Monday to Saturday 11 a.m. to 6:30 p.m.

Opéra-Comique, place Boieldieu, 2e (% 01-42-44-45-47 for reservations;
Fax: 01-49-26-05-93; www.opera-comique.com; Métro: Richelieu Drouot),
offers wonderful musical theater in the Salle Favart, a more intimate
venue (the auditorium is so small you can hear people whispering on
stage) than its opera-hall counterparts. Tickets are priced from 7€ to
100€ ($9–$130), depending on the performance. The box office is open
Monday through Saturday from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m., and Sunday from 11
a.m. to 7 p.m.
Theater
The theaters listed here are “national theaters,” supported by the gov-
ernment, but many private ones also exist. For full listings, consult
Pariscope.
A good mix of modern and classic tragedies and comedies comes alive in
performances in the Salle Richelieu of the Comédie Française, 2 rue de
Richelieu, 1er (% 01-44-58-15-15; Fax: 01-44-58-15-00; www.comedie-
francaise.fr; Métro: Palais-Royal–Musée du Louvre). Performances
are in French. Tickets are 11€ to 35€ ($14–$46); 9€ to 20€ ($12–$26)
ages 27 and younger. Last-minute seats for ages 27 and younger are on

Reduced-visibility seats are 5€ ($6.50). To make a reservation up to 14
days in advance, phone daily from 11 a.m. to 6 p.m. To order tickets 15
days to two months in advance, fax your order or purchase online; no
phone reservations are accepted.
In 1996, the Comédie Française took over the Théâtre du Vieux
Colombier, 21 rue Vieux-Colombier, 6e (% 01-44-39-87-00 or 01-44-
39-87-01; Fax: 01-44-39-87-19; www.comedie-francaise.fr; Métro: St-
Sulpice), an intimate 300-seat venue where mostly modern works are
performed. Tickets cost 8€ to 28€ ($10–$36) for adults, 6€ to 13€
($7.80–$17) for people younger than 27, and 6€ to 21€ ($7.80–$27) for
seniors. To make a reservation up to 14 days in advance, call Tuesday to
Saturday 11 a.m. to 6:30 p.m. or Sunday and Monday 1 to 6 p.m. To order
tickets 15 days to two months in advance, fax your order or purchase
online; no phone reservations are accepted.
Comédie Francaise also has a workshop in the Carrousel du Louvre,
Studio Théâtre (% 01-44-58-98-58; www.comedie-francaise.fr;
Métro: Palais Royal–Musée du Louvre/Louvre-Rivoli), where actors per-
form one-hour plays and readings. Video projections of plays and films
also are shown here. Tickets are sold at the ticket window one hour
before the performance and cost 7€ to 16€ ($9–$21) for adults, 5€ to
12€ ($6.50–$16) for seniors, and 4€ to 8€ ($5.20–$10) for people 27 and
younger.
For popular, contemporary plays, the Théâtre National de Chaillot, 1
place du Trocadéro, 16e (% 01-53-65-30-00; www.theatre-chaillot.
fr; Métro: Trocadéro), is your place. Part of the Art Deco Palais de
Chaillot, the theater is located directly across the Seine from the Tour
Chapter 12: Exploring Paris 213

Eiffel. Tickets are 27€ to 33€ ($35–$43) for adults, 21€ to 27€ ($27–$35)
for seniors and per person for groups of ten or more, and 12€ to 17€
($16–$22) for people 26 and younger.
Théâtre National de la Colline, 15 rue Malte-Brun, 20e (% 01-44-62-
52-52; www.colline.fr; Métro: Gambetta), has modern drama from
around the world, and its Petit Théâtre, located upstairs, has short 
plays and offerings from international theater’s less famous and up-and-
coming playwrights. Arrive early to have a glass of wine and admire the
view from the Café de la Colline in the lobby. Tickets cost 27€ ($35) for
adults, 22€ ($29) for seniors, and 13€ ($17) for people younger than 
30. On Tuesdays, adults and seniors pay 18€ ($23).
Cabaret
When seeing a Parisian cabaret show, have dinner somewhere else and
save yourself some cash. For the money you’d spend at the cabaret, you
can have a fabulous meal at one of the pricier suggestions in Chapter 11.
Be aware that none of the cabaret shows is suitable for children and that
every other member of the audience may be from another country —
these are some of the least “Parisian” experiences you can have while
still being in Paris.
The sexiest acts are at Crazy Horse Paris, 12 av. George V, 8e (% 01-47-
23-32-32; www.lecrazyhorseparis.com; Métro: Alma-Marceau). Dancers,
who have names such as Chica Boum, Pussy Duty-Free, and Zany Zizanie,
appear on swing seats or slithering and writhing in cages — you get the
picture. Pay 50€ ($65) for a seat at the bar and one drink (35€/$46 if
you’re younger than 26) or upgrade to the orchestra and a half-bottle 
of “Grand Marque” champagne for 110€ ($132). Crazy Horse has two
shows nightly at 8:30 and 11 p.m.; Saturday nights, April through June,
there are three shows, at 8 p.m., 10:15 p.m., and 12:15 a.m.

English-language shows
Summer is a good time to catch English-language shows in Paris. Your options include
the following venues.
 Théâtre de Nesle, 8 rue de Nesle, 6e (% 01-46-34-61-04; Métro: St-Michel) or the
Théâtre des Déchargeurs, 3 rue des Déchargeurs, 1er (% 01-42-36-00-02; Métro:
Châtelet) sometimes stage English-language plays.
 For comedy in English, try Laughing Matters, which has recently moved to a new
location in the salsa club La Java, 105 rue Faubourg du Temple, 10e (% 01-53-
19-98-88; www.anythingmatters.com; Métro: Goncourt-Hôpital St-Louis).
This company is thriving; the lineups always are terrific, featuring award-winning
comics from the United States, the United Kingdom, Ireland, and Australia. Shows
start at 8:30 p.m.; admission costs 20€ and 25€ ($26 and $33) at the door.

At the Lido, 116 av. des Champs-Elysées, 8e (% 01-40-76-56-10; www.lido.
fr; Métro: George V), there is a team of 35 sous-chefs and pastry chefs,
and the result is a pretty good meal, but one that still doesn’t justify the
prices. The Lido’s revue, C’est Magique, offers “flying” dancers and an
ascending stage that periodically delivers feathered women, fountains,
an ice rink, high-tech laser lighting, and video projections. Other acts
include a magician who performs rabbit tricks. The show with dinner
and a half-bottle of champagne costs 140€ to 210€ ($182–$273); with
just drinks, the show starts at 80€ ($104) for the later show at 11:30
p.m., and 100€ ($130) for the earlier show at 9:30 p.m.
The most famous of the cabarets is the Moulin Rouge, place Blanche,
Montmartre, 18e (% 01-53-09-82-82; www.moulinrouge.fr; Métro:
place-Blanche). The place has been packing in crowds since 1889, and
singers such as Edith Piaf, Yves Montand, and Charles Aznavour made
their reputations here. Even Frank Sinatra performed here. The show,
Féerie, features comedy, animals, and magic acts, with the requisite
scantily clad women bumping and grinding around the stage. A bar seat
and two drinks cost 97€ ($116) for the 9 p.m. show, 87€ ($104) for the 11
p.m. show. Dinner followed by the 9 p.m. show costs 140€ to 170€
($168–$204); you must arrive for dinner by 7 p.m.
Gustav Eiffel designed the building of the Paradis Latin, 28 rue Cardinal-
Lemoine, 5e (% 01-43-25-28-28; www.paradislatin.fr; Métro: Cardinal-
Lemoine), the club that’s the most French of the cabarets. A genial master
encourages audience participation during a show that’s less gimmick-
filled than the others. To save money, forego dinner for the lower-priced
Champagne Revue, which includes a half bottle of bubbly and costs 80€
($104); dinner-plus-show packages range from 114€ to 200€ ($148–$260).
Performances are Wednesday to Monday, with a 9:30 p.m. showtime.
Jazz
Today, the Paris jazz scene still is vibrant, as new generations develop a
taste for the sound. Look through the current Pariscope for the artists
you admire. If you don’t care who’s playing, and you’re just out for a
night of good music, you can stop by any of the following clubs.
You’ll have a great time jitterbugging with the noisy crowd of foreigners
and locals at the cozy and cavelike Caveau de la Hûchette, 5 rue de la
Hûchette, 5e (% 01-43-26-65-05; Métro or RER: St-Michel), a legendary
club that has been welcoming jazz bands for more than 50 years. Cover
is 11€ ($13) Monday through Thursday; Friday through Sunday and the
eve of a holiday it’s 13€ ($16) between 9 p.m. and 1 a.m. Those younger
than 25 pay 9€ ($11) every night. Music starts at 9:30 p.m.
The crowd is casual and down to earth and the jazz is some of France’s
most interesting at Duc des Lombards, 42 rue des Lombards, 1er (% 01-
42-33-22-88; Métro: Châtelet–Les Halles). Cover is 16€ to 25€ ($21–$33). 
Chapter 12: Exploring Paris 215

The 1961 film featuring Louis Armstrong, Paris Blues, was shot in Le
Bilboquet, 13 rue St-Benoit, 6e (% 01-45-48-81-84; Métro: St-Germain-
dès-Pres). Concerts start at 8:30 p.m. from Sunday to Thursday and at 9
p.m. on Fridays and Saturdays. There is no cover but drinks can be
expensive at the bar (around 10€/$13). 
Anything goes at Les 7 Lézards, 10 rue des Rosiers, 4e (% 01-48-87-08-
97; www.7lezards.com; Métro: St-Paul), the more experimental, the
better. Depending on the performer, entry can be free or up to 16€ ($21).
This is the place where jazz musicians go to wind down.
Your best deal at Le Petit Journal St-Michel, 71 bd. St-Michel, 5e (% 01-
43-26-28-59; www.petitjournalsaintmichel.com; Métro: Cluny–La
Sorbonne, RER: Luxembourg), is the 50€ ($65) menu, which includes
cover charge, three-course meal, and a drink. For 45€ ($59) you can get
a similar deal with two courses, or just pay a 17€ or 20€ ($22 or $26)
cover for entry with a drink included (the cheaper entry is for nonalco-
holic drinks). It’s a warm and relaxed French atmosphere. Open Monday
to Saturday at 7 p.m. with concerts starting around 9:15 p.m. Check out
its sister club, Le Petit Journal Montparnasse, 13 rue de Commandant-
Mouchotte, 14e (% 01-43-21-56-70; Métro: Gaîté). 
New Morning, 7–9 rue des Petites-Ecuries, 10e (% 01-45-23-56-39;
Métro: Château-d’Eau), is one of Paris’s best jazz clubs, and the best
artists from around the world perform here. Covers start from 17€
($22), depending on the act. 
Classy cocktails 
If you’re looking for a quiet, romantic place to unwind with a drink — 
or if you’re on the prowl for where the hip, hot, cutting-edge folks hang
out — these places should fit the bill. Most bars and lounges in Paris
open daily at 9 p.m., but no one arrives until after midnight. They 
generally close around 4 a.m.
At Alcazar, 62 rue Mazarine, 6e (% 01-53-10-19-99; Métro: Odéon), el-
ements of traditional brasserie style, such as banquettes and mirrors,
are slicked up and mixed with innovations such as a glassed-in kitchen
theatrically installed along the left wall. The comfortable upstairs bar 
is ideal for a view over the downstairs restaurant, once one of Paris’s
hottest eateries. Alcazar is located in the same building as Wagg, a 
popular dance club.
The atmosphere at the China Club, 50 rue de Charenton, 12e (% 01-43-
43-82-02; Métro: Bastille), is one of hushed elegance. The Colonial-
decorated restaurant just a few steps from the Bastille is a popular 
nighttime attraction. If you hate cigars, avoid the trendy upstairs fumoir
(smoking room). Eclectic jazz music can often be heard wafting up the
basement stairs. All cocktails are well made (8€/$9.60), but the Chinese
food is overpriced.
Part III: Paris and the Best of the Ile de France 
216

Fubar, 5 rue St-Sulpice, 6e (% 01-40-51-82-00; Métro: Odéon), is a two-
level bar with lots of seating. The upstairs is more conducive to talking
than at the main bar, which tends to get very crowded. The décor is
pretty simple, the music is danceable and not too out there. So what
makes this place so great? The martinis. These are some of the best mar-
tinis you can get in Paris, even if they do cost 9€ ($12). The green apple
martini is especially refreshing. Open every day from 5 p.m. to 2 a.m.
It isn’t hip, it isn’t even new, but Harry’s New York Bar, 5 rue Daunou,
2e (% 01-42-61-71-14; Métro: Opéra), definitely serves a classy cocktail.
In fact, it’s one of Europe’s most famous bars and is as popular today 
as it was in the time of that notorious lost generation of writers who
really knew how to ring up a bar tab. It is said that the Bloody Mary was
invented here, and the selection of whiskeys is amazing. Visit the down-
stairs if only to look at the 1930s piano bar, resembling the inside of a
cozy yacht. It isn’t cheap, of course — the lowest-priced drink is a beer
at 6.60€ ($8.60) a glass. Open every day from 10:30 a.m. to 4 a.m.
Sit outside for fantastic people watching, or choose from three floors of
funky art-covered walls and sit wishfully in antique chairs at Les Etages, 5
rue de Buci, 6e (% 01-46-34-26-26). Popular among young professionals,
the cocktails list here is extensive and complete: Try all sorts of cham-
pagne-mixed fruit cocktails, or trust their bartenders to mix you some-
thing stronger but with just as much flavor. You can eat as many of their
fantastic honey-roasted peanuts as you want, but after two refills, they
definitely give a judgmental glare. Open every day from 11 a.m. to 2 a.m.
At The Lizard Lounge, 18 rue du Bourg-Tibourg, 4e (% 01-42-72-81-34;
Métro: Hôtel-de-Ville), the music is loud, but the heavy-gauge steel bal-
cony overlooking the main bar offers a chance for quieter conversation.
This stylish but easygoing bar is a pleasant place to hang out with an
arty, international crowd. You also can come early in the evening for a
reasonably priced light meal prepared in the open kitchen. Wednesday
to Saturday, a DJ spins dance music in the basement.
In a neighborhood juxtaposed with chic and grunge, Café Etienne Marcel,
34 rue Etienne Marcel (% 01-45-08-01-03; Métro: Etienne Marcel), is
another funky Paris hangout under the care of the experts of chic, the
Costes Brothers. White plastic seats coupled with bold colors and
grafitti art make a fine place to order a complicated drink. The music
playing is from the yearly released Hôtel Costes CDs. Open every day, 11
a.m. to 2 a.m.
The huge downstairs restaurant at Mandala Ray (formerly Man Ray), 34
rue Marbeuf, 8e (% 01-56-88-36-36; Métro: Franklin-D-Roosevelt), is
dominated by statues of two winged Asian goddesses who appear 
concerned — possibly about the food. But don’t visit for dinner; have a
drink at the upstairs bar while listening to jazz. Take note that as the
restaurant winds down around 11 p.m., the music takes on a harder
edge, and a sleek international crowd stands shoulder to shoulder along
the curving bar. American artist and photographer Man Ray’s photos
Chapter 12: Exploring Paris 217

adorn several walls. Celebrity owners include Sean Penn, Johnny Depp,
and John Malkovich. Drinks start at 10€ ($13).
Dance clubs
You can always find someplace to dance the night away in Paris — and
legions of Parisians eager to dance — if not with you, then with their
mirrored reflections! Paris clubs change their programming from night to
night, with house music de rigeur at many places. If you don’t like house,
try one of the barges along the Seine in the 13e, which attract a good mix
and play everything, and you can have a fine, though often crowded,
time right on the river. Check Pariscope magazine for barge concert
schedules. Salsa, the hottest trend a few years back, is still going strong
as is techno, house, world, classic rock, or swing.
To club on a budget, go out during the week, when cover charges may
be (officially or unofficially) waived. Yes, it’s sexist, but women often get
in free, especially if they’re dressed in something slinky, low-cut, or
short (or all three). Black is the color of choice for men’s and women’s
clothing, and the later you go — or earlier in the morning, as the case
may be — the more fashionable.
Many nightclubs accept reservations, so if you’re worried about getting
past the bouncers, give your club of choice a call.
If you ever wanted to dance in a basement that is essentially under the
Louvre, it doesn’t get much classier than Cab (formerly Caberet), 2 place
du Palais Royal, 1er (% 01-58-62-56-25; www.caberet.fr; Métro: Palais
Royal–Musée du Louvre). Also a restaurant until 11 p.m., here you can
rub shoulders with French models, businessmen and women, and the
BCBG children of rich and old-name families. Dim indigo lighting illumi-
nates black leather furniture that looks like it was grown and not assem-
bled. There are two bars with shiny black or glass surfaces, and three
different seating areas (not counting the VIP section!). Music is usually
house and electro, with various hip-hop songs and other American hits
mixed in. Later at night (or the morning), you may hear classic R&B hits
like Aretha Franklin’s “Think.” A 20€ ($26) entry gets you in with one
drink, and cocktails remain pricey, starting around 10€ ($13). The
bouncers are picky and won’t let you in if you’re not properly dressed
(women, trendy clothes with hair and makeup done, guys in shirts 
and trendy jeans at the least, slacks or a jacket can help; above all, no
sneakers!). Open Wednesdays, and Friday through Sunday, from 11:30
p.m. until 4:30 a.m.
The Irish light ship (a boat that lights the path for other ships) Batofar,
11 quai François Mauriac, 13e (% 01-56-29-10-00; Métro: Bibliothèque
François Mitterand or Quai de la Gare), has concerts Monday to Sunday,
and the party can go on all night. With reasonably priced drinks (4€–8€/
$5.20–$10) and a 20-something clientele, it can get crowded, but it’s still
a lot of sweaty fun. Music can be anything from drum-and-bass to British
pop. Hours vary (check listings in Pariscope), but things usually start
Part III: Paris and the Best of the Ile de France 
218

around 7 p.m. Cover ranges from free to 15€ ($18) depending on the
band or DJ for the night. A small snack bar is onboard.
You can catch a monthly bal (dance) and have a ball at Elysée Mont-
martre, 72 bd. de Rochechouart, 18e (% 01-44-92-45-36; Métro: Anvers),
a club that serves the dual function of disco and major concert hall.
Illustrious past acts included Björk, U2, and the Red Hot Chili Peppers.
Dance music is usually house; the monthly bals usually have live local
bands. Check Pariscope for events and prices. Dances are open 11 p.m.
to 5 a.m. Cover charges vary from 12€ to 20€ ($16–$26) for dancing and
more for concerts.
La Coupole, 102 bd. du Montparnasse, 14e (% 01-43-27-56-00; Métro:
Montparnasse–Bienvenüe), has a basement dance hall — a retro venue
with plush banquettes and old-fashioned sounds that’s a big draw for
out-of-towners. Tuesdays and Fridays are salsa nights, with dance
classes starting at 7:30 p.m. for 10€ ($13; including a drink) and lasting
two hours, after this it becomes a regular salsa club. Brazilian music is
played on Thursdays, and Saturday nights vary. Regular cover is 12€
($16) on Thursdays and Saturdays. During the week the club shuts down
between 2 and 3 a.m., and Fridays and Saturdays it lasts from midnight
to 5:30 a.m. 
The huge trilevel La Loco, previously La Locomotive (90 bd. de Clichy,
18e (% 01-53-41-88-88; Métro: Blanche), is popular with American stu-
dents and is especially busy on Sundays. People dance to rock and
techno, though occasionally metal concerts are staged. La Loco is a very
big place, and in the sous-sol (basement, the coolest of the three levels),
you can even see the remnants of an old railway line (hence the name).
The Bar Americain looks more Roman, with fake statuary and columns
crowned by lions. Mixed drinks start at 9€ ($12), beer at 7€ ($9.10).
Cover ranges from 12€ to 20€ ($16–$20), depending on the night of the
week and whether you buy a drink with your admission fee. Free admis-
sion for women on Sundays until 1 a.m. (although it is not stated, women
will generally get in for half-price or free at other times as well). Open 11
p.m. to 5 a.m. 
Hugely popular Le Mix, 24 rue de l’Arrivée, 15e (% 01-56-80-37-37;
www.mixclub.fr; Métro: Montparnasse–Bienvenue). Groove with the
fashionistas at both of these clubs on Fridays and Saturdays until 5 a.m.
to house and “tek-house” beats. The Mix also has a varying cover —
many nights are free to get in before midnight, always check on the Web
beforehand. Sundays from 6 p.m. to midnight at le Mix is their popular
gay Tea Dance. 
Unpretentious and branché all at the same time, le Triptyque, 142 rue
Montmartre, 2e (% 01-40-28-05-55; www.letriptyque.com; Métro:
Grands Boulevards or Bourse) hosts clubbing nights and live music 
by music groups or hot and up-and-coming DJs in the American and
European music scene. Music ranges from soul, reggae, and disco to
electro, house, and techno sounds. Nights are often themed; check
Chapter 12: Exploring Paris 219

online to find the latest updates. Unlike some snooty nightclubs in Paris,
Triptyque is very much “do-your-own-thing” and no bouncers should
give any trouble. Entry changes based on who is performing, but many
nights are free, and paid nights are usually between 5€ and 8€ ($6.50–
$10). Open on the weekends (Sun is house night) and most Wednesday
nights, club nights start at 11 p.m. while concerts start at 8 p.m. 
One of the best things about Le Wax, 15 rue Daval, 11e (% 01-40-21-16-
16; Métro: Bastille), is the price — free. You have to really like house
music; the club is the premier place for DJs who spin it all night long.
Décor is very Clockwork Orange, with plastic bubbles on the walls,
yellow plastic couches, and lots of crimson and orange. Open 6 p.m. 
to 2 a.m. Tuesday to Thursday; 6 p.m. to 5 a.m. Friday to Saturday.
Red Light, formerly L’Enfer (34 rue du Départ, 15e; % 01-42-79-94-53;
www.enfer.fr; Métro: Montparnasse–Bienvenue), just around the
corner from the equally popular Le Mix (above), is a medium-sized club
that welcomes a maximum-sized crowd, and it is one of the best places
to go clubbing. Cover can vary, usually it starts around 15€ ($20), but
some nights are free: Check the Web site to see if reduced or free passes
can be printed out (usually you have to show up before a certain hour). 
Queen, 102 av. des Champs-Elysées, 8e (% 01-53-89-08-89; Métro:
George V), is one of the hottest clubs in town, with nightly crowds so
thick you can find it difficult to get a drink. The clientele is about two-
thirds gay, but having a beautiful face and body, or at least the ability to
disguise your faults with great clothes, are no longer necessary to help
you get past the door. Monday night is “straight” night, and is the most
tame of the nights. Cover (including one drink, with or without alcohol)
is 10€ ($13) Sunday to Thursday, 20€ ($26) on Friday and Saturday.
Open daily midnight to 7 a.m., 8 a.m. on weekends. Cover (including one
drink, with or without alcohol) is 15€ ($20) during the week and 20€
($26) on weekends. Open daily from 11 p.m. to 7 a.m., until 8 a.m. on
weekends.

American Express
The big Paris office, 11 rue Scribe, 9e (% 01-
47-77-79-28; Métro: Opéra Chaussée-d’Antin
or Havre-Caumartin; RER: Auber), is open
weekdays 9 a.m. to 6:30 p.m. The bank is
open 9 a.m. to 6:30 p.m. on Saturday, but the
mail pickup window is closed.
ATM Locators
ATMs are widely available, with banks on
many Paris corners. Before you leave
home, ask your bank to print out a list of
ATMs that accept your bankcard or Master-
Card or Visa cards. Or check out the follow-
ing sites: www.visaeurope.com or www.
mastercard.com.
Business Hours
The grands magasins (department stores)
generally are open Monday to Saturday
9:30 a.m. to 7 p.m.; smaller shops close for
lunch and reopen around 2 p.m., but this is

rarer than it used to be. Many stores stay
open until 7 p.m. in summer; others are
closed on Monday, especially in the morn-
ing. Large offices remain open all day, but
some close for lunch. Banks are normally
open weekdays 9 a.m. to noon and 1 or 1:30
to 4:30 p.m. Some banks also open on
Saturday morning.
Currency Exchange
Banks and bureaux de change (exchange
offices) almost always offer better
exchange rates than hotels, restaurants,
and shops, which should be used only in
emergencies. For good rates, without fees
or commissions, and quick service, try the
Comptoir de Change Opéra, 9 rue Scribe, 9e
(% 01-47-42-20-96; Métro: Opéra; RER:
Auber). It is open weekdays 9 a.m. to 6 p.m.,
Saturday 9:30 a.m. to 4 p.m. The bureaux de
change at all train stations (except Gare de
Montparnasse) are open daily; those at 63
av. des Champs-Elysées, 8e (Métro: Franklin-
D-Roosevelt), and 140 av. des Champs-
Elysées, 8e (Métro: Charles-de-Gaulle–
Etoile), keep long hours. Despite disadvan-
tageous exchange rates and long lines,
many people prefer to exchange money at
American Express (see the listing earlier in
this section).
Dentists
You can call your consulate and ask the
duty officer to recommend a dentist. For
dental emergencies, call SOS Urgences
Stomatologique Dentaire (% 01-45-35-
41-41) daily from 8:30 a.m. to midnight.
Doctors
Call your consulate and ask the duty officer
to recommend a doctor, or call SOS Méde-
cins (% 01-43-37-77-77), a 24-hour service.
Most doctors and dentists speak some
English. You can also call for an appoint-
ment at the Centre Médicale Europe, 44 rue
d’Amsterdam (% 01-42-81-93-33).
Consultations cost about 20€ ($26), and
specialists are available.
Embassies/Consulates
If you have a passport, immigration, legal,
or other problem, contact your consulate.
Call before you go: They often keep strange
hours and observe both French and home-
country holidays. Here’s where to find them:
Australia, 4 rue Jean-Rey, 15e (% 01-40-
59-33-00; Métro: Bir-Hakeim); Canada, 35
av. Montaigne, 8e (% 01-44-43-29-00;
Métro: Franklin-D-Roosevelt or Alma-
Marceau); New Zealand, 7 ter rue
Léonardo-da-Vinci, 16e (% 01-45-00-24-11;
Métro: Victor-Hugo); Consulate of Great
Britain, 35 rue Faubourg-St-Honoré, 8e 
(% 01-44-51-31-00; Métro: Madeleine);
Embassy of Ireland, 4 rue Rude, 16e (% 01-
45-00-20-87); and United States, 2 rue St-
Florentin, 1er (% 01-43-12-22-22; Métro:
Concorde).
Emergencies
Call % 17 for the police. To report a fire,
dial % 18. For an ambulance, call % 15.
The main police station, 7 bd. du Palais, 4e
(% 01-53-71-53-71; Métro: Cité), is open 24
hours a day.
Hospitals
Two hospitals with English-speaking staff
are the American Hospital of Paris, 63 bd.
Victor-Hugo, Neuilly-sur-Seine (% 01-46-
41-25-25), just west of Paris proper (Métro:
Les Sablons or Levallois-Perret), and the
Hôpital Franco-Brittanique, 3 rue Barbes
Levallois-Perret (% 01-46-39-22-22), just
north of Neuilly, across the city line north-
west of Paris (Métro: Anatole-France). The
American Hospital charges about $677 a
day for a room, not including doctor’s fees.
The emergency department charges more
than $100 for a visit, not including tests and
X-rays.
Chapter 12: Exploring Paris 221

Information
Before you go: French Government Tourist
Office (www.francetourism.com), 444
Madison Ave., 16th floor, New York, NY
10022-6903. This office does not provide
information over the phone. When you
arrive: Office de Tourisme de Paris, 11 rue
Scribe, 9e (% 08-92-68-30-00; .35€/45¢ per
min.; www.paris-touristoffice.com).
Internet Access
Cybercafe de Paris, 11 and 15 rue des
Halles, 1er (% 01-42-21-11-11; Métro:
Châtelet), charges 4€ to 7€ ($5.20–$9.10)
per hour for internet access.
Laundry and Dry Cleaning
The more expensive your hotel, the more it
will cost to get your laundry or dry cleaning
done there. Instead, find a laundry near 
you by consulting the Yellow Pages under
Laveries pour particuliers. Take as many
coins as you can. Washing and drying 6kg
(131⁄4 lb.) usually costs about 3.50€ to 5.50€
($4.55–$7.15). Dry cleaning is nettoyage à
sec; look for shop signs with the word
PRESSING, and don’t expect to have your
clothes back within an hour; you may be
able to get them back the next day if you
ask nicely. The dry cleaning chain 5 à Sec
has stores all across Paris.
Mail
Large post offices are normally open week-
days 8 a.m. to 7 p.m., Saturday 8 a.m. to
noon; small post offices may have shorter
hours. Many post offices (PTT) are scat-
tered around the city; ask anybody for the
nearest one. Airmail letters and postcards
to the United States cost .90€ ($1.20); within
Europe .50€ (60¢); and to Australia or New
Zealand, .90€ ($1.20).The city’s main post
office is at 52 rue du Louvre, 75001 Paris
(% 01-40-28-76-00; Métro: Louvre-Rivoli).
It’s open 24 hours a day for urgent mail,
telegrams, and telephone calls. It handles
Poste Restante mail: sent to you in care of
the post office and stored until you pick it
up; be prepared to show your passport and
pay 0.60€ (80¢) for each letter you receive.
If you don’t want to use Poste Restante,
you can receive mail in care of American
Express. Holders of American Express
cards or traveler’s checks get this service
free; others have to pay a fee.
Maps
Maps printed by the department stores
usually are available free at hotels, and
they’re good for those visiting Paris for 
only a few days and hitting only the major
attractions. But if you plan to really explore
the city, the best maps are those of the
Plan de Paris par Arrondissement, pocket-
sized books with maps and a street index.
They’re extremely practical, and prices
start at around 9€ ($12). You can find them
in Paris bookstores, Monoprix, and some of
the bigger newsstands. Most Parisians
carry a copy because they, too, get lost 
at times.
Police
Dial % 17 in emergencies; otherwise, call
% 01-53-71-53-71.
Restrooms
Public restrooms are plentiful, but you usu-
ally have to pay for them. Every cafe has a
restroom, but it is supposed to be for cus-
tomers only. The best plan is to ask to use
the telephone; it’s usually next to the toi-
lette. For a .50€ (65¢) coin, you can use the
street-side toilets, which are automatically
flushed out and cleaned after every use.
Some Métro stations have serviced rest-
rooms; you are expected to tip the atten-
dant .50€ (65¢).
Safety
Paris is relatively safe; your biggest risks
are pickpockets and purse snatchers, so be
Part III: Paris and the Best of the Ile de France 
222

particularly attentive on the Métro and on
crowded buses (especially in the confusion
of getting on and off), in museum lines,
popular shopping areas, and around tourist
attractions. Popular pickpocketing tactics
include: someone asking you for directions
or bumping into you while an accomplice
takes your wallet or bands of children sur-
rounding and distracting you and then
making off with purchases and/or your
wallet. Women should be on guard in
crowded tourist areas and on the Métro
against overly friendly men who seem to
have made a specialty out of bothering
unsuspecting female tourists. Tricks include
asking your name and nationality, and then
taking advantage of your politeness by
sticking like a burr to you for the rest of the
day. They’re usually more harassing than
harmful, but if you’re too nice, you may be
stuck spending time with someone with
whom you prefer not to. A simple “leave me
alone” (laissez-moi tranquille [“lay-say
mwa tran-keel”]) usually works.
Taxis
Taxis Bleues (% 08-25-16-10-10), Alpha
Taxis (% 01-45-85-85-85), or G7 (% 01-47-
39-47-39). Be aware that the meter starts
running as soon as you call a cab, so they’re
more expensive than regular cabs. You can
hail taxis in the street (look for a taxi with a
white light on; an orange light means it’s
occupied), but most drivers will not pick you
up if you are in the general vicinity of a taxi
stand (look for the blue TAXI sign).
Telephone/Telex/Fax
Most public phone booths take only tele-
phone debit cards called télécartes, which
can be bought at post offices and at tabacs
(cafes and kiosks that sell tobacco prod-
ucts). You insert the card into the phone
and make your call; the cost is automati-
cally deducted from the “value” of the 
card recorded on its magnetized strip. The
télécarte comes in 50- and 120-unit denomi-
nations, costing about 10€ and 15€ ($13
and $20), respectively, and can be used
only in a phone booth. Cashiers will almost
always try to sell you a card from France
Télécom, the French phone company, but
cards exist that give you more talk time for
the same amount of money. Instead of
inserting the card into a public phone, you
dial a free number and tap in a code. The
cards come with directions, some in
English, and can be used from public and
private phones, unlike France Télécom’s
card. Look for tabacs that have advertise-
ments for Delta Multimedia or Kertel, or ask
for a télécarte international avec un code.
For placing international calls from France,
dial 00 and then the country code (for the
United States and Canada, 1; for Britain, 44;
for Ireland, 353; for Australia, 61; for New
Zealand, 64), the area or city code, and the
local number (for example, to call New
York, you’d dial 00 + 1 + 212 + 000-0000). 
To place a collect call to North America,
dial 00-33-11, and an English-speaking
operator will assist you. Dial 00-00-11 
for an American AT&T operator; MCI
0800-99-00-19; Sprint 0800-99-00-87. For
calling from Paris to anywhere else in
France (called province), the country is
divided into five zones with prefixes 01, 02,
03, 04, and 05; check a phone directory for
the code of the city you’re calling.
If you’re calling France from the United
States, dial the international prefix, 011;
then the country code for France, 33; fol-
lowed by the city code and the local
number, but leave off the initial zero (for
example, 011 + 33 + 1-00-00-00-00). Avoid
making phone calls from your hotel room;
many hotels charge at least .30€ (40¢) for
local calls, and the markup on international
calls can be staggering.
Chapter 12: Exploring Paris 223

Trains
The telephone number for reservations on
France’s national railroads (SNCF) is simply
% 36-35 (.35€/min. [45¢/min.]). Open 7 a.m.
to 10 p.m. daily. Remember, you must vali-
date your train ticket in the orange ticket
composteur on the platform or pay a fine.
Water
Tap water in Paris is perfectly safe, but if
you’re prone to stomach problems, you may
prefer to drink mineral water.

Traveling Beyond Paris:
Five Great Day Trips
In This Chapter
 Enjoying Marie Antoinette’s former home(s) at Versailles
 Discovering where Napoléon said goodbye at Fontainebleau

 Hanging out with Mickey at Disneyland Paris
 Visiting Monet’s gardens in Giverny
D
id you know you can take some fascinating trips outside Paris —
and still be back in time to have a nightcap in a Paris cafe? The
sights in this chapter are the most widely visited attractions in the Ile de
France, the suburbs and countryside surrounding Paris, as shown in the
map “The Ile de France.”
Château de Versailles: Enjoying the Excesses
There’s more to Versailles (% 01-30-83-77-88; www.chateauversailles.
fr) than its incredible château, of which the words “awe-inspiring” don’t
begin to do justice. This is literally a small city on more than 2,000 acres
that houses formal and fanciful gardens, meadows (with sheep), a mile-
long Grand Canal modeled on the one in Venice, the Grand and Petit
Trianon mansions, a hamlet where Marie Antoinette played peasant, the
restored royal stables, a coach museum, fountains, and woods. All this
attests to the power royalty once had and to one king who truly believed
he deserved it: Louis XIV, also known as the Sun King. The king hired the
best to build Versailles: Louis Le Vau and Jules Hardouin-Mansart, France’s
premier architects; André Le Nôtre, designer of the Tuileries gardens;
and Charles Le Brun, head of the Royal Academy of Painting and Sculp-
ture, who fashioned the interior. Construction got underway in 1661.
In 1682, Louis XIV transferred the court to Versailles to live with him to
prevent plots against him (because his citizens’ taxes paid for Versailles,
he was a little paranoid that an angry mob might come for him in the
night. They waited, instead, for his great great-grandson, Louis XVI and

his wife, Marie Antoinette). Historians estimate that anywhere from
3,000 to 10,000 people, including servants, lived at Versailles, and court
etiquette grew to be absurd (including the occasional power struggles
between attendants over who ranked high enough to dress Marie
Antoinette while the young queen waited, shivering). When you see all
this over-the-top magnificence and try to estimate the cost, you may
understand better the anger of the revolutionaries a century later.
Louis enjoyed an incredibly long reign — 72 years. When he died in 1715,
he was succeeded by his great-grandson, Louis XV, who continued the
outrageous pomp and ceremony and made interior renovations and
redecorations until lack of funds forced him to stop. His son and daugh-
ter-in-law, Louis XVI and Marie Antoinette, had simpler tastes and made
no major changes at Versailles, but by then it was too late. On October 6,
1789, a mob marched on the palace and forced the royal couple to
return to Paris. This was the beginning of the French Revolution. The
royal family eventually lost their lives, save one daughter (though some
report that the young dauphin, or heir to the throne, never really died in
prison, but was spirited away from the country). The monarchy was
reinstated in 1830, and Louis-Philippe, who reigned from 1830 to 1848,
prevented Versailles’s destruction by donating his own money to con-
vert it into a museum dedicated to the glory of France. In the mid–20th
century, John D. Rockefeller also contributed to the restoration of
Versailles, and the work from that contribution continues to this day.
The nearby “Versailles” map shows the current configuration.
Seeing the sights
More than three million tourists visit Versailles each year, so arrive
early; you’ll want to have as much of a head start as possible to make
sure you cover the grounds (shown in the nearby “Versailles” map).
Note: For those with limited mobility, electric cars are available at the
south entrance (% 01-39-66-97-66).
Highlights of the castle and gardens
The first rooms you see in the palace are the six Louis XIV–style Grands
Appartements, which kings used for ceremonial events, and the Petits
Appartements, where they lived with their families. Louis XV stashed
his mistresses, Madame du Barry and Madame de Pompadour, in his
second-floor apartment, which you can visit only with a guide. Attempts
have been made to restore the original décor of the Queen’s bedcham-
ber, which Marie Antoinette renovated with a huge four-poster bed and
silks in patterns of lilacs, her favorite flower, and peacock feathers. Look
for the secret door through which she attempted to escape.
Other magnificent rooms include the Salons of War and Peace, which
flank the palace’s most famous room, the 236-foot-long Hall of Mirrors.
Hardouin-Mansart began work on the hall in 1678, and Le Brun added 17
large windows and corresponding mirrors. The ceiling paintings repre-
sent the accomplishments of Louis XIV’s government. Jacques-Ange

The Ile de France
Chapter 13: Traveling Beyond Paris: Five Great Day Trips 227
Gabriel designed the Library with its delicately carved panels. The
Clock Room contains Passement’s astronomical clock, which took 20
years to make; it’s encased in gilded bronze.
Gabriel also designed the Royal Opéra for Louis XV. Try to imagine it the
way it used to be during a concert — bearskin rugs underfoot and the
light of 3,000 powerful candles. Hardouin-Mansart built the gold-and-
white Royal Chapel between 1699 and 1710. After his father’s death,
Louis XVI and Marie Antoinette prayed for guidance here, fearing they
were too young to run the country.

After you see the château, plan to spend at least an hour strolling
through the Formal Gardens, spread across 250 acres. Here Le Nôtre
created a Garden of Eden, using ornamental lakes and canals, geometri-
cally designed flowerbeds, and avenues bordered with statuary. Louis
XV, imagining he was in Venice, would take gondola rides with his lover
of the moment on the mile-long Grand Canal. The restored vegetable gar-
dens (le Potager de Roi) are here, as well. If you visit on a weekend in the
summer, try to take in The Grands Eaux Musicales, a show in which the
fountains move in time to the classical music of Bach, Mozart, or Berlioz.
Cost is 7€ ($9.10) adults, 5.50€ ($7.15) ages 10 to 26 and seniors, free for
children younger than 10. 
The underrated treasures
Because of the crowds and long lines, most guests are content to visit
only the château and gardens, but you can see much more at Versailles if
you have the stamina. The most important of the remaining sights are
the Grand Trianon and the Petit Trianon. Trianon was the name of the
town that Louis bought and then razed in order to construct a mansion,
Le Grand Trianon, where he could eat light meals away from the palace.
Designed in 1687, again by Hardouin-Mansart, the Grand Trianon has 
traditionally served as a residence for the country’s important guests,
although former President Charles de Gaulle wanted to turn it into a
weekend retreat for himself. Napoléon I spent the night here, and U.S.
President Richard Nixon slept in the room where Madame de Pompadour
(Louis XV’s mistress) died. Gabriel, the designer of the place de la Con-
corde, built the Petit Trianon in 1768 for Louis XV, who used it for trysts
with Madame du Barry, his mistress after La Pompadour. Marie Antoinette
adopted it as her favorite residence, where she could escape the con-
straints of palace life.
Behind the Petit Trianon is the Hamlet, a collection of small thatched
farmhouses and a water mill, a setting where Marie Antoinette pre-
tended she was back at her family’s country retreat in Austria. Near the
Hamlet is the Temple of Love, built in 1775 by Richard Mique, Marie
Antoinette’s favorite architect. In the center of its Corinthian colonnade
is a reproduction of Bouchardon’s Cupid shaping a bow from the
Hercules’ club.
Louis XIV’s stables, Le Grande Ecurie, are newly restored and open to
the public. Also designed by Hardouin-Mansart, the stables held as many
as 600 horses owned by the king. These days, you’ll see 20 ivory-colored
Lusitanian horses from Portugal. A morning tour here includes a dres-
sage demonstration with riders in costume on horses performing to
music. Near the stables is the entrance to the Coach Museum, which
houses coaches from the 18th and 19th centuries, among them one 
used at the coronation of Charles X and another used at the wedding 
of Napoléon I and his second wife, Marie-Louise. One sleigh rests on 
tortoiseshell runners. A ticket to the Petit Trianon also admits you to
this museum.

Chapter 13: Traveling Beyond Paris: Five Great Day Trips 229

Admission to Le Grande Ecurie is 7.50€ ($9.75) adults, 3€ ($3.90) 17 and
younger. Open Tuesday to Friday 9 a.m. to 1 p.m., weekends 11 a.m. to 
3 p.m. Admission to the coach museum is 2€ ($2.60), free for children
younger than 18. It’s open every weekend from April to October 9 a.m. to
6:30 p.m. and the first two weekends in November 12:30 to 5:30 p.m.
The particulars
Admission to the palace is 14€ ($18) for adults, 10€ ($13) for ages 18 to
24 and older than 60. It’s free for those younger than 18 and for all on
Sunday. Combined admission to the Grand and Petit Trianons is 9€ ($12)
for adults during the high season, and 5€ ($6.50) during low season, and
free for those younger than 18. Admission to the gardens is free except
for the days of Grands Eaux Musicales (see earlier in this chapter for
prices).
One-hour audio tours of the King’s Chambers are 14€ ($18) for adults
and include admission to the chateau; these tours are free for children
younger than 18. Lecturer-led one-hour tours of the palace are admis-
sion price plus 4€ ($5.20), 3€ ($4) ages 10 to 17 and seniors; one-and-a-
half-hour tours are admission plus 6€ ($7.80), 4.50€ ($5.85) ages 11 to 17
and seniors; two-hour tours are admission plus 8€ ($10) for adults, 6€
($7.80) ages 10 to 17. Tours are free for children younger than 10.
You can also take advantage of the Versailles Passeport (% 01-30-83-77-
88), a one-day pass to visit the entire Château de Versailles and its sur-
rounding attractions within the city. The Passeport includes audio-
guided visits in the château, including the Chapel and opera house, the
King and Queen’s Grand Apartments, the Dauphin’s (Crown Prince)
Apartments, and the “Appartements de Mesdames” (ladies-in-waiting,
only open on weekends). After this massive opulent castle visit, you
have free reign of the parks, gardens and forest groves, Domaine de
Marie-Antoinette (Marie Antoinette’s private fields), and all of the tem-
porary exhibits. If you use the Passeport during the high season, the
Coach Museum and the spectacle of Les Grands Eaux Musicales are also
included. The tickets cost 25€ ($33) during high season and 16€ ($21)
during low season — a fair price as seeing each attraction separately
would cost much, much more. You can purchase the Passeport at any
FNAC ticket booth or an SNCF ticket booth. 
From May to September, the palace is open Tuesday through Sunday
from 9 a.m. to 6:30 p.m. The rest of the year, the palace is open Tuesday
through Sunday from 9 a.m. to 5:30 p.m. From May through September
the Grand Trianon and Petit Trianon are open daily noon to 6:30 p.m.;
from October to April, the Grand Trianon and Petit Trianon are open
daily noon to 5:30 p.m. The park and the gardens are open every day
except in bad weather from 7 a.m. in summer, 8 a.m. in winter, until
sunset (between 5:30 and 9:30 p.m. depending on the season).

Getting to Versailles
Catch the RER line C to Versailles from one of the stops at the Gare
d’Austerlitz, St-Michel, Musée d’Orsay, Invalides, Ponte d’Alma, Champ
de Mars, or Javel and take it to the Versailles Rive Gauche station (take
the train marked “direction Versailles-Rive-Gauche-Château”). Round-trip
tickets cost 5.40€ ($7) and the trip takes about 35 minutes. At the sta-
tion you can board a shuttle bus to the château. Or, you can take the 
15-minute walk through the pretty town itself. Note: Eurailpass holders
travel free on the RER, but must show their Eurailpass at the kiosk near
any RER entrance to receive a ticket that opens the turnstile leading to
and from the RER platforms. 
You can also reach Versailles from central Paris via regular SNCF trains,
which make frequent runs from two railway stations — Gare St-Lazare
and Gare Montparnasse — to Versailles. Trains departing from Gare St-
Lazare arrive at the Versailles Rive Droit railway station; trains departing
from Gare Montparnasse arrive at Versailles Chantiers. Both stations lie
within a ten-minute walk of the château, which is a wonderful way to
orient yourself to the town, its geography, its scale, and its architecture.
If you’d rather not walk, you can take bus B, bus H, or (in midsummer) a
shuttle bus marked CHÂTEAU from any of the three stations directly to the
château for a fee of 2.50€ ($3.25) each way per person. Because of the
vagaries of the bus schedules, it may be easier to walk. Directions to the
château are clearly signposted from each railway station.
To reach Versailles by car, drive west on the A13 highway from Porte
d’Auteuil toward Rouen. Take the Versailles-Château exit, about 14 miles
from Paris. Park in the visitors’ parking lot at place d’Armes for 4.50€
($5.85) Monday through Friday, 5.50€ ($7.15) on weekends. The drive
takes about a half-hour, though in traffic it can take more than an hour.
Don’t want the hassle of getting to Versailles yourself? You can also take
a tour bus there. Cityrama, 2 place des Pyramides, 1er (% 01-44-55-61-
00; www.cityrama.fr), offers trips to Versailles ranging from 39€ to
92€ ($51–$120) for adults, 20€ to 43€ ($25–$56) children (the higher-
priced tickets also include trips to Fontainebleau and Barbizon). Paris
Vision, 214 rue de Rivoli, 1er (% 01-42-60-30-01; www.parisvision.com),
offers bus excursions starting from 39€ to 145€ ($51–$189), half price
for ages 4 to 11.
Dining locally
The town of Versailles has no shortage of lunch spots, but after you’re
on the palace grounds, it’s infinitely more convenient to just stay put;
otherwise, you have to hike back into town and back out to the palace
again. You have several choices at the attraction itself: In the château,
you can eat at Le Café, a snack bar just off the Cour de la Chapelle. In
the Formal Gardens is an informal restaurant, La Flotille, on Petite
Venise. (To get there from the château, walk directly back through the
gardens to where the canal starts. Petite Venise and the restaurant are to
Chapter 13: Traveling Beyond Paris: Five Great Day Trips 231

your right.) La Petite Venise, a wood-beamed restaurant, brasserie, and
tea room with outdoor seating is located between the Grand Canal and
the Apollo Fountain. Finally, several snack bars and fresh-squeezed
orange juice stands are located in the gardens near Quinconce du Midi
and the Grand Trianon.
Château de Fontainebleau: Napoléon’s Lair
You can combine culture and outdoor activities at Fontainebleau, a ter-
rific day trip from Paris: After you tour the castle, you can hike the trails
or rent bikes to ride in the nearly 17,000-hectare (42,000-acre) Forêt
(forest) de Fontainebleau. The Palais de Fontainebleau (% 01-60-71-
50-60) is probably most famous as the site of Napoléon’s farewell to his
imperial guard before he went into exile, but it actually contains more
than 700 years of royal history from the enthronement of Louis VII in
1137 to the fall of the Second Empire in 1873. And Leonardo da Vinci
played a small role in its history.
Seeing the sights
In 1528, François I transformed a run-down royal palace into Fontainebleau
for his mistress, and his successor, Henri II, left a beautiful memorial to
the woman he loved, a ballroom decorated with the intertwined initials
of his mistress, Diane de Poitiers, and himself. The Mona Lisa once hung
here, and it is said that its creator, Leonardo da Vinci personally brought
the painting to its buyer, his friend François I. (The Mona Lisa remained
in the royal family for years before it was donated to the Louvre.) Stucco-
framed paintings now hanging in the Gallery of François I include The
Rape of Europa and depict mythological and allegorical scenes related to
the king’s life.
Make sure to see the racy ceiling paintings above the Louis XV Staircase.
Originally painted for the bedroom of a duchess, the stairway’s architect
simply ripped out the duchess’s floor and used her bedroom ceiling to
cover the stairway. One fresco depicts the queen of the Amazons climb-
ing into Alexander the Great’s bed.
When Louis XIV ascended the throne, Fontainebleau was largely neglected
because of his preoccupation with Versailles, but it found renewed glory
under Napoléon I. You can walk around much of the palace on your own,
but most of the Napoleonic rooms are accessible only by guided tours,
which are in French. Napoleon had two bedchambers; mirrors adorn
either side of his bed in the grander chamber (look for his symbol, a bee),
while a small bed is housed in the aptly named Small Bedchamber. A
red-and-gold throne with the initial N is displayed in the Throne Room.
You can also see Napoléon’s offices, where the emperor signed his 
abdication, though the document exhibited is only a copy.
After a visit to the palace, wander through the gardens, paying special
attention to the lovely, bucolic carp pond, and take caution while walking

by some of the fearless swans. If you’d like to promenade in the forest, a
detailed map of its paths is available from the Office de Tourisme, located
near the palace at 4 rue Royale (% 01-60-74-99-99; www.fontainebleau-
tourisme.com). You can also rent bikes nearby from À la Petite Reine,
32 rue des Sablons (% 01-60-74-57-57), for about 5€ ($6.50) an hour, 15€
($20) a half day, 19€ ($23) a full day, with a credit-card deposit. The Tour
Denencourt, about 5km (3 miles) north of the palace, makes a nice ride
and has a pretty view. Other mapped-out walking and bike tours of the
city and environs can be downloaded from the Tourist Office Web site.
The Palais de Fontainebleau is open Wednesday through Monday, and is
closed on New Years Day, Christmas Day, and the first of May. The open-
ing hours October through May are from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m.; from June to
September the hours are 9 a.m. to 6 p.m. Admission to the Grands
Appartements is 6.50€ ($8.50) for adults, 4.50€ ($5.90) for ages 18 to 26
and older than 60, free for those younger than 18. Free for all on the first
Sunday of the month.

Getting to Fontainebleau
By train, the SNCF Montargie line to Fontainebleau Avon station departs
hourly from the Gare de Lyon in Paris. The trip takes 35 to 60 minutes
and costs 9€ ($12). Fontainebleau Avon station is just outside the town
in Avon, a suburb of Paris. From the station, the town bus (direction
Château) makes the 3km (2-mile) trip to the château every 10 to 15 min-
utes on weekdays, every 30 minutes on weekends. 
If you’re driving, take the A6 south of Paris, first in the direction of
Nantes/Bordeaux/Aéroport Orly/Rungis/Évry/Lyon for about 9km (51⁄2
miles) and then continuing south toward Évry/Lyon/Chilly Mazarin for
about 35km (22 miles). Follow the N37 exit toward Fontainebleau/
Montargis Par Fontainebleau/Milly-La-Forêt in the direction of Fontaine-
bleau for 7km (5 miles), and then take the N7 in the direction of
Fontainebleau for 6km (4 miles) and exit at Fontainebleau.
Cityrama, 4 place des Pyramides, 1er (% 01-44-55-61-00; www.cityrama.
fr), offers bus tours combining both Fontainebleau and Barbizon (see
the next section) for 61€ ($79) per adult, 31€ ($40) per child.
Dining locally
If you’re arriving by train and plan to visit only Fontainebleau, consider
bringing a picnic from Paris. In fine weather, the château’s gardens and
nearby forest beckon. 
If you stay in Fontainebleau for lunch, try Le Table des Maréchaux (in
the Hôtel Napoléon; 9 rue Grande; % 01-60-39-50-50). Its 35€ ($46)
three-course Ménu de l’Empereur may include goat cheese and Gorgon-
zola profiteroles sprinkled with almond, or a wildfowl terrine with a sun-
dried tomato and onion spread accompaniment. Move on to main courses
of roasted pork served with pan-fried fennel in curry sauce, or a breast
of duckling served with honey and dried fruits. Finish up with a puff
pastry of honey ice cream and chestnut cream, or ice cream–stuffed
French toast made with pain d’épices (spiced bread). In warm weather,
diners can eat on the outdoor terrace.
On the western edge of France’s finest forest lies the village of Barbizon,
home to a number of noted landscape artists — Corot, Millet, Rousseau,
and Daumier. The colorful town has a lively mix of good restaurants,
boutiques, and antiques shops — the perfect place to while away an
afternoon. For lunch, try the Relais de Barbizon, 2 av. Charles-de-Gaulle
(% 01-60-66-40-28). The three prix-fixe menus at 19€, 30€, and 64€
($24, $39, and $83) may feature such hearty home-style dishes as duck-
ling in wild cherry sauce and tarte au citron (lemon pie). The restaurant
is open Thursday through Monday noon to 2:30 p.m. and 8 to 10 p.m.,
Tuesday noon to 2:30 p.m. only.

Cathedral at Chartres: Checking 
Out the Stained Glass
Cathédrale de Notre-Dame-de-Chartres (% 02-37-21-59-08), one of the
world’s greatest Gothic cathedrals and one of the finest creations of the
Middle Ages, comes second in importance to a majority of its visitors.
Instead, a small scrap of material — said to be worn by the Virgin Mary
when she gave birth to Jesus — draws the masses. This sacred scarf was
supposedly a gift from the Empress Irene of Byzantium to Charlemagne,
and has been resting in the cathedral of Chartres since A.D. 876 (at first
preserved in a previous incarnation of today’s Chartes cathedral). 
Seeing the Cathedral
The cathedral that you see today (see the map “Notre-Dame de
Chartres”) dates principally from the 13th century, when it was built
with the combined efforts and contributions of kings, princes, church
officials, and pilgrims from all across Europe. This Notre-Dame was
among the first to use flying buttresses.
Take one of Malcolm Miller’s excellent guided tours of Chartres
Cathedral (% 02-37-28-15-58; Fax; % 02-37-28-33-03; E-mail: miller
chartres@aol.com) at a cost of 10€ ($13) adults, 5€ ($6.50) students.
He gives fascinating tours at 11 a.m. and 2:45 p.m. Monday to Saturday
from Easter through November. If you can’t get in touch with Miller, call
the cathedral Welcome Center (% 02-37-21-75-02) about tours.
A good time to visit the cathedral is on Sunday afternoons, when free
organ concerts (4:45–5:45 p.m.) and the filtered light coming in from the
western windows make the church come wonderfully alive.
Begin at the beginning — with the entryway. People say that Rodin sat
for hours on the edge of the sidewalk, contemplating the portal, spell-
bound by its sculptured bodies draped in long, flowing robes, with amaz-
ingly lifelike faces. Before entering, walk around to both the north and
south portals, which date from the 13th century. The bays depict such
biblical scenes as the expulsion of Adam and Eve from the Garden of
Eden and episodes from the life of the Virgin.
Next, just inside, are the Clocher Vieux (Old Tower), with its 106m (350-
ft.) steeple dating from the 12th century, and the Clocher Neuf (New
Tower). Originally built in 1134, the new tower’s current elaborate orna-
mental tower was added between 1507 and 1513 following one of the
many fires that swept through the cathedral.
You can climb to the top of the Clocher Neuf, but make sure your shoes
aren’t slippery — parts of the tower are without a railing and are quite
steep and narrow.
Chapter 13: Traveling Beyond Paris: Five Great Day Trips 235

The cathedral also is known for its celebrated choir screen. Don’t let the
term fool you; this is a carved wood structure that took nearly 200 years
to complete. The niches, 40 in all, contain statues illustrating scenes
from the life of Mary. The screen is in the middle of the cathedral toward
the back. Sancta Camisia, the holy relic that some people believe Mary
wore during the birth of Jesus, is behind the choir screen in a chapel to
the left of the church’s treasury.
Few of the rushed visitors ever notice the choir screen; they’re trans-
fixed by the windows. Bring a pair of binoculars to better focus on the
panes covering more than 2,500 sq. m (more than 26,900 sq. ft.). The
glass is unequaled anywhere in the world and is truly mystical. It was
spared in both world wars because of a decision to remove it — piece 
by piece.
Most of the stained glass dates from the 12th and 13th centuries. Many
visitors find it difficult to single out one panel or window of particular
merit; however, the oldest is the 12th-century Notre Dame de la belle
verrière (Our Lady of the Beautiful Window, sometimes called the Blue
Virgin) on the south side. Its colors are such a vibrant, startling blue,
many find it hard to believe that the window is 1,000 years old.
Look down in the nave — the widest in France — at the 13th-century
labyrinth. It was designed for pilgrims to navigate on their hands and
knees as a form of penance, all 304m (1,000 ft.) of it. These days, much 
of it is covered with folding chairs for Mass.
The cathedral is open daily April to September 8:30 a.m. to 8 p.m.;
October to March 9 a.m. to 7 p.m. Ask at the Chartres tourist office 
(% 02-37-18-26-26) outside the cathedral for information about tours in
English and a schedule of Masses that are open to the public. Visits of
the North tower take place May through August from 9:30 a.m. to 12:30
p.m., and then from 2 to 5 p.m. (Sun 2–5 p.m. only). Admission to the
tower is 4€ ($5.20) for adults, 3€ ($3.60) for seniors and students; free
for children younger than 12. Roof structure tours (this is a great way to
learn about how intricate gothic architecture is) are at 3 p.m. May
through August, and in September through April on Saturdays and
Sundays, not counting school holidays, starting as late as 5 p.m.
Other diversions
If you have extra time, spend it by exploring the medieval cobbled
streets of the Old Town. At the foot of the cathedral are lanes with
gabled and turreted houses and humped bridges spanning the Eure
River. The turreted Norman house (it’s the oldest-looking one there) on
rue Chantault, dates back nine centuries.
Stop in to the Musée de Beaux-Arts de Chartres, 29 Cloître Notre-Dame
(% 02-37-90-45-80), to see paintings by old masters such as Watteau,
Brosamer, and Zurbarán and admire the museum’s architecture, some of
which dates back to the 15th century. The museum is open Wednesday

through Monday, 10 a.m. to noon, and from 2 to 5 p.m. (Sun 2–5 p.m.
only). It is closed on November 1, November 11, and December 25.
Admission is 2.70€ ($3.50), 1.40€ ($1.80) for children younger than 12
and senior citizens; students are admitted free. 
Getting to Chartres
To reach Chartres by train, pick up one of the hourly SNCF trains from
Paris’s Gare Montparnasse to the town of Chartres. A round-trip ticket
costs about 23€ ($30); the trip takes an hour.

If you’d like to drive to Chartres, take the A10/A11 highway from Porte
d’Orléans and follow the signs to Le Mans and Chartes. The drive takes
about 75 minutes.
Traveling to Chartres by tour bus is another option. Cityrama, 4 place
des Pyramides, 1er (% 01-44-55-61-00; www.cityrama.fr), offers five-
hour excursions from Paris every Tuesday, Thursday, and Saturday for
58€ ($75) per adult, 39€ ($51) per child. Paris Vision, 214 rue de Rivoli,
1er (% 01-42-60-30-01; www.parisvision.com), offers the same tour,
the same days, for the same rate. 
Dining locally
Restaurants, cafes, and snack bars abound around town, but just a
stone’s throw from the cathedral is Le Café Serpente, 2 Clôitre Notre-
Dame (% 02-37-21-68-81). Facing the south side of the cathedral with
outside tables, this restaurant serves traditional French fare at reason-
able prices, with lunch priced between 10€ and 20€ ($13–$26) for two
courses that may start with a dish of leeks and asparagus with foie gras
and include a main course of filet de rouget (red fish filet). If you’re just
there for a snack or light meal, the requisite salade composée (large meal
salads) or some tasty omelets are available. The restaurant is open daily
for lunch, and Monday through Saturday for dinner.
On the other side of the cathedral is the Jardin Gourmand du Pres-
bytère, 21 Cloître Notre-Dame (% 02-37-21-27-02), a charming and inex-
pensive restaurant that feels positively homey and will make you feel
like you’re eating in someone’s French kitchen with kitschy decorations.
Here you can get simple entrees for 5€ ($6.50) such as a pea-mint soup
or a spinach pastry, and for a main course they have a great pan-fried
salmon with perfumed rice. Even just a coffee here is worth the stop:
You face a shady and cool side of the cathedral and you can study the
intricate statues and stonework as you dine. The restaurant is open
Monday through Saturday noon through 2 p.m., and opens again around
7 p.m. for dinner.
Disneyland Paris: A Welcome from Mickey
Disneyland Paris, known locally as Le Parc Disneyland (% 08-25-30-02-
22; www.disneylandparis.com), is France’s number-one attraction,
with more than 50 million visitors a year. When it opened in 1992 the
French were dead set against it; now 40 percent of its visitors are French,
and half of those are Parisian. Set on a 5,000-acre site (about one-fifth the
size of Paris) in the suburb of Marne-la-Vallée, the park incorporates the
elements of its Disney predecessors but gives them a European flair.
Allow at least a full day to see Disneyland Paris.
Part III: Paris and the Best of the Ile de France 
238

Exploring the theme parks
Disneyland Paris resort has two theme parks: the Disneyland Park and
the newer Walt Disney Studios Park. Disneyland Park is a total vacation
destination, clustering together five “lands” of entertainment (Main
Street, U.S.A., Frontierland, Adventureland, Fantasyland, and Discovery-
land); six massive and well-designed hotels; a campground; a nightlife
center (Le Festival Disney); swimming pools, tennis courts, a 27-hole golf
course; and dozens of restaurants, shows, and shops.
Walt Disney Studios Park is a movie studio come to life, where children
can participate in the process. The entrance (the Front Lot) resembles
the Hollywood Disney studios — water tower, gates, and all. You can
visit a film studio that resembles a street; as they walk around the park,
kids can become a part of the filming of impromptu comedy sketches
and get to see themselves on screen later in the day. In the Animation
Courtyard, cartoon characters come to life via black light and mirrors,
and children can play at being animators at interactive displays. The
French Disney Channel has its studios here, in the Production Courtyard;
children get to see how a TV studio really works and may be asked to be
extras.
For sustenance, the En Coulisse restaurant serves the kind of food kids
like and Americans are known for — hamburgers, pizza, salads, and ice
cream. Other choices include an international buffet, Rendez-Vous des
Stars, and the Backlot Express Restaurant, serving sandwiches and
other quick fare. Food kiosks selling popcorn, ice cream, hot dogs, and
so on are located throughout the park.
If your kids are younger than seven, they’d be best suited for Main
Street, U.S.A., Fantasyland, Sleeping Beauty’s Castle, and the afternoon
parade. Children ages 7 through 12 will enjoy Frontierland, the Phantom
Manor ghost house, the Big Thunder Mountain roller coaster, Adventure-
land, the Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom roller coaster, and the
Pirates of the Caribbean ride. Teens will like Discoveryland, the Space
Mountain roller coaster, and the Star Tours simulated spacecraft ride.
Admission (subject to change) to either Disneyland Park or the Walt
Disney Studios Park for one day is 43€ ($56) for visitors 12 and older, 35€
($46) for children ages 3 to 11 years, and free for children younger than 3.
Admission for a one-day Everywhere Pass (called the Passe-Partout) good
for unlimited access to both the theme park and the studios park costs
53€ ($64) for adults, 45€ ($54) ages 3 to 11; a two-day pass is 96€ ($115)
for adults and 79€ ($95) ages 3 to 11, the three-day pass is 115€ ($138)
for adults and 95€ ($114) for children ages 3 to 11. Entrance to Le
Festival Disney (a consortium of shops, dance clubs, and restaurants) is
free; there’s usually a cover charge for the dance clubs. Disneyland Paris
is open from the middle of June to the middle of September daily from 9
a.m. to 11 p.m.; off-season hours vary but are generally Monday to Friday
10 a.m. to 8 p.m., and Saturday and Sunday 9 a.m. to 8 p.m. From Septem-
ber to December, the scheduling hours become erratic during certain
Chapter 13: Traveling Beyond Paris: Five Great Day Trips 239

weekends due to various school holidays, and also vary with the
weather; definitely call or check online before you go.
A guide for visitors in wheelchairs gives important information about
access to rides and other attractions all across the park. You can pick up
a copy at City Hall in the Disneyland Park or call to get a copy sent to
you (% 01-60-30-60-30).
Avoid waiting in long lines with the free Fast Pass. You present the pass
at the ride you want, are given a time frame of when to come back, and
get to board the ride first when you return. Ask for it at the ticket booth
or City Hall.
Getting to Disneyland Paris
To reach Disneyland Paris by train, take the RER Line A from the center
of Paris (Invalides, Nation, or Châtelet–Les Halles) to Marne-la-Vallée/
Chessy, a 35-minute ride. Trains run every 10 to 20 minutes, depending
on the time of day. The station is at the entrance to the park.
Avoid lines at the resort by buying Disneyland passes (individual day
passes for either Disneyland Park or Walt Disney Studios, no Everywhere
Passes) at all RER A stations except Marne-la-Vallée and at Métro sta-
tions including Charles-de-Gaulle–Etoile, Franklin-D-Roosevelt, Gare de
Lyon, Porte Maillot, Esplanade de la Défense, Anvers, Père Lachaise,
Place de Clichy, Gallieni, Havre-Caumartin, Villiers, Alésia, Barbès-
Rochechouart, Châtelet, Denfert-Rochereau, and Gare de l’Est. 
Shuttle buses connect the resort’s hotels (except the Davy Crockett
Ranch) with Orly Airport (every 45 minutes daily between 9 a.m. and 
7 p.m.) and Roissy–Charles-de-Gaulle (every 45 minutes daily between 
8 a.m.–8 p.m.). Within the park, a free shuttle bus connects the various
hotels with the theme park, stopping every 6 to 15 minutes, depending
on the time of year. Service begins an hour before the park opens and
stops an hour after closing.
By car, take the A4 highway east and exit at Park Euro Disney. Guest
parking at any of the thousands of spaces costs 8€ ($10). A series of
moving sidewalks speeds up pedestrian transit from the parking areas to
the theme-park entrance.
Spending the night
If you want to stay at Disneyland overnight or for a few days, you need
to book well in advance. Plenty of hotels are available at different price
levels, and you can explore the options and book accommodations on
the park’s Web site at www.disneylandparis.com.

Giverny: Monet’s Gardens
Monet moved to Giverny (% 02-32-51-28-21, www.fondation-monet.
com, for Fondation Claude Monet, which runs the museum) in 1883, and
the water lilies beneath the Japanese bridge in the garden and the flower
garden became his regular subjects until his death in 1926. In 1966, the
Monet family donated Giverny to the Académie des Beaux-Arts in Paris,
perhaps the most prestigious fine-arts school in France, which subse-
quently opened the site to the public. Giverny has since become one of
the most popular attractions in France, inspiring millions with its land-
scape and provençal-themed house, but even the crowds can’t com-
pletely overwhelm the magic.
Even before you arrive at Giverny, you likely already have some idea of
what you’re going to see. The gardens are usually at their best in May,
June, September, and October. Should you yearn to have them almost to
yourself, plan to be at the gates when they open. Try to spend at least a
half-day at Giverny, longer if you plan to eat lunch and visit the American
Museum.
Admission to the house and gardens is 6.60€ ($8.60) for adults, 4€
($5.20) for students, and 3€ ($3.90) for ages 7 to 12 (children younger
than 7 get in free); admission to only the gardens is 4€ (5.20), and admis-
sion to only the house is 1.50€ ($1.95). No advance tickets are sold.
Getting to Giverny
To reach Giverny by train, pick up an SCNF train at Gare St-Lazare in
Paris; one leaves approximately every hour for the 45-minute trip to
Vernon, the town nearest the Monet gardens. The round-trip fare is
about 23€ ($30). From the station, buses make the 5km (3-mile) trip to
the museum for 2€ ($2.60), a taxi ride will cost 5€ to 8€ ($6.50–$10), you
Chapter 13: Traveling Beyond Paris: Five Great Day Trips 241
Giverny: It isn’t just for Monet anymore
It’s estimated that at one point, more than 50 American artists lived in Giverny with
their families, and you can see much of their work at the Musée d’Art Américain
Giverny (% 02-32-51-94-65; giverny.org/museums/american), a little more
than 90m (295 ft.) from Monet’s house and gardens. Some say Monet’s influence was
responsible for the influx of American artists into the village of Giverny in the late 1880s.
Others claim that Monet had little contact with the Americans and that it was Giverny’s
beauty that captured the hearts of painters such as John Singer Sargent and William
Metcalf, who began spending summers there. The museum is open April to November,
including Easter Monday and Whit Monday (51 days after Easter), Tuesday to Sunday
10 a.m. to 6 p.m. Admission is 5.50€ ($7.20) adults, 4€ ($5.20) students and seniors, 3€
($3.90) children ages 12 to 18 and free for ages younger than 12. Admission also is free
the first Sunday of every month.

can rent a bike in Vernon, or you can even go on foot — the route along
the Seine makes for a nice walk.
By car, take Autoroute A13 from the Porte d’Auteuil to Bonnières and
then D201 to Giverny. The whole trip takes about an hour.
Traveling to Giverny by tour bus is another option. Cityrama, 4 place
des Pyramides, 1er (% 01-44-55-61-00; www.cityrama.com), has two
trips to Giverny: a five-hour trip on Tuesday through Saturday for 63€
($82) adults, 32€ ($41) children 4 to 11 (children younger than 4 ride
free); and an all-day Giverny–Auvers-sur-Oise trip on Sunday or
Wednesday for 105€ ($137) for adults, 95€ ($123) for children, which
includes lunch at the American Museum. Call for specific dates. Paris
Vision, 214 rue de Rivoli, 1er (% 01-42-60-30-01; www.parisvision.
com), offers two trips: a Versailles–Giverny all-day trip on Tuesday,
Thursday, and Saturday that includes lunch at the Moulin de Fourges
and a visit to the American Art Museum for 152€ ($198) for adults, 109€
($142) for children; and a trip without the museum and lunch in the city
of Versailles on Tuesday through Sunday for 116€ ($151) for adults and
85€ ($111) for children.
Dining locally
Your entry ticket is no longer valid once you leave Monet’s home, so
think ahead about whether you want to eat lunch before or after your
visit. Most people arrive in early afternoon, so crowds are slightly lighter
in the mornings.
The square directly across from Monet’s house and the adjacent street
have many little cafes and creperies. But a short walk from the gardens
is Les Jardins de Giverny, 5 Chemin du Roy (% 02-32-21-60-80). This
beautiful and tranquil restaurant opens its doors onto a rose garden in
warm weather and serves delicious regional specialties. A trou Normand
(cider and Calvados sorbet) aids digestion between courses that may
include an asparagus-filled puff pastry and warm oysters cooked in
beurre blanc and cider with a frothy sorrel sabayon (sauce made of
whipped eggs and wine), or baby duck filet prepared with in-season
fruits. Main courses cost between 19€ and 28€ ($25–$36). The 27€ ($35)
and 37€ ($48) menus are better deals. Open Tuesday to Sunday noon to
3 p.m. and 7:30 to 10 p.m. Closed in winter.
Another good restaurant in town is Le Relais Normand (11 place
d’Evreux; % 02-32-21-16-12) in the Hôtel d’Evreux, an old Norman manor
house with a fireplace and terrace. It serves delicious dishes like roasted
Normandy oysters with a nut and mushroom filling, beef filet with Livarot
cream cheese, and duck filet with caramelized red fruit. The three prix-
fixe menus cost 22€, 28€, and 32€ ($29, $36, and $42). The restaurant is
open for lunch Tuesday through Sunday from noon to 3 p.m.

Part IV
Tours and the Loire
Valley Châteaux

In this part . . . 
T
he Loire Valley is France’s most romantic region, where
some two dozen of the most impressive châteaux in
Europe are contained within a 113km (70-mile) radius. In
Chapter 14, we take you to Tours, the valley’s principal city
and the traditional place to base yourself for an exploration
of the castles. The other good base city is Orléans, covered in
Chapter 15 along with the eight most impressive châteaux.
The Loire Valley is where the kings and nobles of France
chose to live for several centuries, and each castle has wit-
nessed its share of bliss and bloodshed. You can visit two or
three castles in one day or spend a week exploring the region
and visiting a dozen or more. This area dazzles with examples
of the ﬂowering of Renaissance architecture in France, and
the images of ﬁerce medieval battlements set against soaring
Renaissance turrets and towers will stay with you for years 
to come.

 Doing Tours by night
W
riter Honoré de Balzac once proclaimed that Tours, 232km (144
miles) southwest of Paris, was “laughing, loving, fresh, flowered,
and perfumed better than all the other cities of the world.” We can’t
vouch for the perfumed part, but we can say that the city feels espe-
cially lively, perhaps because of the 32,000 students who call it home
along with the 135,000 other residents. Above all, Tours is the ideal base
for an exploration of the Loire Valley’s châteaux (see Chapter 15).
At the junction of the Loire and Cher rivers, Tours is the capital of the
Touraine region, which was France’s political and religious capital for 
80 years during the 15th and 16th centuries. As a result, the region 
near Tours is a showcase of royal and noble residences built during 
the Renaissance. Writers such as François Rabelais, Balzac, and Réné
Descartes lived here, and artists from Leonardo da Vinci to Alexander
Calder have drawn inspiration from the area.
Getting There
Tours is an hour from Paris by TGV, the fast train, departing from Gare
Montparnasse. About six trains per day make the trip, costing 28€ ($36)
each way. Contact the national train company, SNCF, at % 08-92-35-
35-35 or 3635 within France (www.sncf.com) for schedules and reserva-
tions. Trains arrive in Tours at the splendid beaux-arts Gare SNCF, 3 rue
Edouard-Vaillant. A suburban train station is at St-Pierre-des-Corps, 5km
(3.1 miles) from Tours, where you may need to change trains.

The bus station, Gare Routière, is on place du Général-Leclerc. For bus
schedules (an information kiosk is on rue de la Dolve in Tours), call 
% 02-47-66-70-70. The Aéroport de Tours is 6km (3.7 miles) northeast
of the city; for information, call % 02-47-49-37-00. If you’re driving
from Paris, you can take A10 southwest to Tours; it’s about a two-and-
a-quarter-hour trip.
Getting Information and Getting Around
You exit the train station at Tours onto wide place du Général-Leclerc,
planted with lilac trees. Across the street is a modern conference center,
and next door, on the right, is the tourist office (78–82 rue Bernard-
Palissy; % 02-47-70-37-37; www.ligeris.com), with maps, details on
guided tours of the city and nearby châteaux, and other useful informa-
tion. In addition, the office’s staff can book a hotel room for you. From
mid-April to mid-October, the office is open Monday to Saturday 8:30 a.m.
to 7 p.m. and Sunday 10 a.m. to 12:30 p.m. and 2:30 to 5 p.m. From mid-
October to mid-April, hours are Monday to Saturday 9 a.m. to 12:30 p.m.
and 1:30 to 6 p.m., Sunday 10 a.m. to 1 p.m. The office is closed January 1,
May 1, and December 25.
Walking from one end of central Tours to the other is an easy trek (see
the nearby “Tours” map), and most of the good hotels are about a ten-
minute walk from the train station. For taxi service, call Taxi Radio at 
% 02-47-20-30-40. Several car-rental offices are in or near the train sta-
tion, including Avis (inside the station; % 02-47-20-53-27), open Monday
to Friday 8 a.m. to 12:30 p.m. and 1:30 to 6:30 p.m., and Saturday 8 a.m.
to noon and 2 to 6 p.m.; and Hertz (57 rue Marcel-Tribut; % 02-47-75-
50-00), open Monday to Saturday 8 a.m. to noon and 2 to 6:30 p.m. You
can rent a bike at Vélomania (109 rue Colbert; % 02-47-05-10-11) for
15€ ($20) per day. The shop is open Monday 3:30 to 7:30 p.m., Tuesday
to Friday 10:30 a.m. to 1:30 p.m. and 3:30 to 7:30 p.m., Saturday 10:30 a.m.
to 7:30 p.m., and Sunday 6 to 6:30 p.m. (for return of bikes).
Spending the Night
If you want to experience life on a 17th-century country estate, think
about staying and/or dining at the government-rated three-star Château
de Beaulieu (67 rue de Beaulieu; % 02-47-53-20-26; Fax: 02-47-53-84-20)
in Joue-les-Tours, 7.2km (41⁄2 miles) southwest of Tours. Another tony
hotel-restaurant option is the Château Belmont (see “Dining Locally,”
later in this chapter).

a double curving stairway leads to the reception hall. Guest rooms feature

ing. Try to snag one of the nine rooms in the château; the others, a bit more
sterile, are in a turn-of-the-20th-century pavilion a stone’s throw away.

Tours
This 85-room hotel was erected in 1853, making it the oldest in town. Its
midsize rooms have been upgraded and redecorated and its bathrooms
renewed, earning it new status as a government-rated four star. On week-
days, the hotel is favored by business travelers; on weekends, it plays 
host to many area brides and grooms. Amenities at this air-conditioned
hotel, however, are limited to the basics, such as room service and laun-
dry service.

Langlois. This hotel, one of the oldest in Tours, is located in a landmark
18th-century building on a quiet side street near the center of town. While
all rooms are decorated in a simple contemporary style, accommodations
on the lower floors are much larger — and a bit more expensive — than
those above.

near antiques shops, restaurants, and museums. The 20 rooms, which vary
in size, are simple and homey — not to say homelike — and are well main-
tained and often quite sunny. Some rooms contain showers and toilets, but
most require you to use the bathrooms in the halls.

Dining Locally
A number of gastronomic specialties of the Loire Valley go particularly
well with the region’s wines. While exploring, look for menu items such
as rillons or rillettes (cooked pork chunks), geline (traditional free-range
chicken), coq au vin (chicken stewed in wine), writer François Rabelais’s
favorite fouaces (traditionally prepared bread rolls), and poires tapées
(dried pears steeped in wine). A special cheese of the region is Ste-
Maure-de-Touraine. Local wines to taste include Vouvray, Montlouis-
sur-Loire, Amboise, Azay-le-Rideau, Chinon, Bourgueil, and St-Nicholas-
de-Bourgueil.

grand home is also a fine hotel, offering doubles for 140€ to 400€ ($182–

watched and analyzed; critics can’t find much to fault here other than the
stuffy service endemic to fancy French restaurants. Bardet’s dramatic
menus feature liberal doses of foie gras and truffles, and vegetables and
herbs from his own gardens. One favorite of his is a lobster dish prepared
with Vouvray wine and spiced fresh ginger.

Chez Jean-Michel, Le Charolais
$$
Tours
FRENCH
This restaurant in the antiques quarter specializes in pairing local cuisine,
such as coq au vin and matelote d’anguille (stewed eel), with fine Loire
Valley wines (the owner is a former sommelier, so he knows his vintages).
This is one of those small, well-priced restaurants where you may end up
having one of your trip’s most memorable meals; the management is
clearly keeping an eye on the details while turning out sophisticated fare.
See map p. 247. 123 rue Colbert. % 02-47-20-80-20. Reservations recommended. Prix

La Roche le Roy
$$$
St-Avertin
FRENCH
One of the hottest chefs in town, Alain Couturier, blends new and old tech-
niques in a gabled 15th-century manor south of the town center.
Couturier’s repertoire includes scalloped foie gras with lentils, cod with
saffron cream sauce, pan-fried scallops with truffle vinaigrette, and
matelote of eel with Vouvray wine. His masterpiece is suprême of pigeon
with “roughly textured” sauce. For dessert, try a slice of warm orange-
flavored chocolate served with coffee-flavored sherbet.
To find La Roche le Roy, take avenue Grammont south (following signs to
St-Avertin-Vierzon) from the center of town. The road crosses a bridge but
doesn’t change names. The restaurant is beside the road on the southern
periphery of Tours.

Tours
FRENCH
This restaurant has been a local favorite since shortly after World War II.
In the commercial heart of Tours, it has two dining rooms and an outdoor
terrace for warm-weather dining. The ever-changing menu may include
homemade foie gras and whitefish caught in the Loire served with beurre
blanc (white butter). Regional ingredients mix well with the local wines, as
exemplified by pikeperch with sabayon and magret de fillet de canard
(duckling) served with a “jam” of red Chinon wine. Other well-prepared
menu items include a small filet of fried foie gras served with baked apples
and grapes soaked in Calvados; and strips of beef cooked in port, served
with fried cèpes (flap mushrooms). In summer, strawberry parfait with
raspberry coulis is a perfect finish.

Exploring Tours
You may notice right away that Tours is a college town, with a hip young
populace strolling the avenues and hanging out in cafes and bars with
names such as Mr. Cool, Route 66 Café, and Le Fly.
Seeing Tours by shoe leather
For a short walking tour of the town, begin in front of Cathédrale St-
Gatien. Continue north on rue Lavoisier and make a left on rue Colbert,
where you pass old cafes and shops, and 15th- and 16th-century homes.
Two blocks up on your right is the passageway Coeur Navre, which was
used to lead the condemned to the place of public execution. Fans of
antiquarian books and antiques will enjoy rue de la Scellerie, a block
south of rue Colbert; this antiques quarter also is home to the Grand
Théâtre, built in 1869. Continue west on rue de la Scellerie to wide rue
Nationale, a main boulevard containing every shop you could want,
including major department stores such as La Samaritaine and Au
Printemps. Turn left on rue Nationale and walk south. In 1 block, rue
Nationale becomes a pedestrian-only street with boutiques and outdoor
Chapter 14: Tours: Gateway to Châteaux Country 251

cafes. In a few more short blocks, you reach the base of rue Nationale
and the heart of town, place Jean-Jaurès, where you can see the impos-
ing 19th-century façades of the law courts and town hall. Retrace your
steps back up rue Nationale to rue du Commerce and take a left. In sev-
eral blocks, you reach the restored medieval district, place Plumereau,
called “place Plume” by locals. This area is characterized by cobble-
stone pedestrian streets surrounded by half-timbered buildings. You can
find a host of fine boutiques and small shops on rue du Grand-Marché,
just south of place Plume. Rue du Grand-Marché leads to place de la
Victoire, the location of an antiques/flea market.
Between April and November, the tourist office also choreographs
guided walking tours of the old town in French and English. Each
departs from the tourist office, usually at either 10 a.m. or 2:30 p.m.,
according to a frequently changing schedule that varies randomly; each
lasts about two hours. Advance reservations are important. The cost is
5.50€ ($7.15) for adults, 4.50€ ($5.85) for children younger than 12. For
reservations and a schedule of the day’s departure times, contact the
tourist office (see “Getting Information and Getting Around,” earlier in
this chapter).
Seeing Tours by diesel power or by horsepower
One of the best ways to obtain a commentary-filled overview of Tours,
its monuments, and its layout involves participating in a 50-minute ride
aboard a simulated train through the streets of the city. Running on
diesel-powered rubber wheels and resembling the kind of choo-choo
promoted in The Little Engine That Could, it operates between April and
October, daily at 10 and 11 a.m., and again on the hour between 2 and 
6 p.m., for a per-person price of 5€ ($6.50) for adults and 2.50€ ($3.25)
for children younger than 12. Rides last about 50 minutes and incorpo-
rate the city’s historic core and exterior views of its cathedral. The
“train” departs from and returns to a spot directly in front of the city’s
tourist office. You can purchase your tickets either at the tourist office
or directly aboard the train.
An alternative way of seeing the city that’s a bit more old-fashioned 
and a bit more kitsch is aboard one of the horse-drawn carriages (les
Calèches) operated by a local outfit known as Fil Bleu (% 02-47-66-70-
70). Each carriage is a wagonlike affair, suitable for up to ten passengers,
pulled through the city’s medieval neighborhoods by a pair of slow-
moving workhorses. No commentary is associated with these excur-
sions, which cost 1€ ($1.30) per person. Carriages depart between May
and September only, every Sunday at 3, 4, and 5 p.m., and Tuesday to
Saturday at 10 and 11 a.m. and 3, 4, and 5 p.m. (no tours on Monday).
In July and August, you can take a horse-and-buggy tour through the
ancient city center. For details, contact Touraine en Roulotte at % 02-
47-55-04-06.

Experiencing the top sights
In this section are the best sights, but you can find a half a dozen other
attractions in Tours. If you’re interested in seeing everything, you’ll find
it cost effective to stop at the tourist office to purchase the 7€ ($9.10)
Carte Multi-visites, which gets you into several sights (Musée des Beaux-
Arts, Musée St-Martin, Musée du Compagnonnage, Musée d’Histoire
Naturelle, Musée des Vins de Touraine, and Centre de Création Contem-
poraine) and on a guided city tour. Call % 02-47-70-37-37 for details.
Cathédrale St-Gatien
Tours
Soaring up to a clerestory and three rose windows, this flamboyant Gothic
cathedral took 300 years to construct, beginning in 1236. Before entering
the cathedral, take note of the gorgeous stained-glass windows, which have
been compared to those of Paris’s Sainte-Chapelle (see Chapter 12). An
explanation of the images represented on the windows is given in several
languages, including English; this explanation can be found on the right as
you enter. A sculpted tomb containing the children of Charles VIII and Anne
de Bretagne (Anne of Brittany) is in the chapel, and in the church’s north-
east corner is a remarkable spiral staircase similar to one at the Château de
Blois (see Chapter 15). The cloisters were built from 1442 to 1524, and you
can visit with or without a guide. During August and September, free clas-
sical music concerts are performed on Sundays at 5 p.m.

after trade apprenticeships. Mid-September to mid-June, the
museum is open Wednesday to Monday 9 a.m. to noon and 2 to 
6 p.m.; late June to early September, hours are daily 9 a.m. to

 You can’t help but notice the beautiful Renaissance residence that
houses the Musée Archeologique de l’Hôtel Gouin (25 rue du
Commerce; % 02-47-66-22-32). Inside are archaeological displays
of every period of Tours history, from prehistoric and Gallo-Roman
times through the medieval and Renaissance periods to the 18th
century. The museum is open year-round Tuesday to Sunday 10
a.m. to 1 p.m. and 2 to 6 p.m. Admission is 4.50€ ($5.85) for adults,
3€ ($3.90) for students, and free for children younger than 12.
Living It Up after Dark
Just follow the crowds to “place Plume,” where you can find densely
packed cafes and bars, frequented especially by students. In summer,
everyone sits outdoors in the square and then hits the post-11 p.m. club
scene.
The best of the clubs is the cover-free Le Louis XIV (37 rue Briçonnet;
% 02-47-05-77-17), for cocktails and karaoke. Nearby L’Excalibur (35
rue Briçonnet; % 02-47-64-76-78) offers the best disco scene (cover
10€/$13), but Le Trois Orfevres (6 rue des Orfevres; % 02-47-64-02-73)
is the place to go for live music (cover 8€–10€/$10–$13). Another fun
club is Le Florida, 40 Febrotte (% 02-47-20-65-52), a disco with a 10€
($13) cover. Irish-pub fans can head to Buck Mulligan’s (38–39 rue du

Chapter 15
The Best of the Loire Valley 
In This Chapter
 Exploring the finest châteaux
 Learning about kings, queens, and mistresses
 Discovering medieval villages
L
ying two hours southwest of Paris is the Loire Valley, a region
famous for its crisp wines, pastoral countryside, and glorious cas-
tles. Besides Paris, the area offers the most historic sites, in the closest
proximity to one another, in the whole of France. Among the countless
châteaux in the Loire Valley are about 20 that are worthy of a visit; for
this chapter, we’ve chosen the eight châteaux that are the most beautiful
and interesting. Die-hard French history buffs can certainly visit more —
or even all of them (for additional choices, see the sidebar “Other Loire
Valley favorites” later in this chapter). For most people, four places will
be sufficient before châteauxphobia (extreme fear of turrets and audio-
guides) kicks in.
Because châteaux locations are so concentrated (about a dozen within a
976km/60-mile radius), you can easily visit four of them in a two-day trip.
In high season, you may see plenty of bus-tour groups doing just that.
The short distances also mean that biking enthusiasts can have fun ped-
aling from one town to the next. If you have the time, you may want to
visit one château per day for three days, giving yourself the leisure to
explore the towns and surrounding countryside, too.
If your time is limited to just one château, choose either Chenonceau
(the most beautiful) or Chambord (the largest).
The cities of Tours (see Chapter 14) and Orléans (see the end of this
chapter), 113km (70 miles) apart, serve as convenient boundaries to the
district — to the west and east, respectively — and you’ll enjoy spend-
ing a night in either of these lively centers.

What’s Where? — The Loire Valley 
and Its Major Attractions
The Loire region is the “Valley of Kings,” where a thousand years of
French monarchs feasted and entertained, seduced and betrayed, and
schemed and plotted. Major events of French history have occurred at
these sites, from marriages to births to infidelities to murders. Each
castle has a juicy story to tell, and all have tours (guided or self-guided
with English audioguides) so that you can get the most from the 
experience.
The Loire Valley is crossed by half a dozen rivers, and the castles sit
beside them, between them, high above them, and (in the case of
Chenonceau) over them. The countryside is filled with medieval villages
and small towns connected by uncrowded country roads. Although the
castles are undoubtedly the stars of these towns, some towns (such as
Amboise and Blois) are larger and provide other diversions, and some
(such as Chenonceaux and Chambord) are tiny, without much to offer.
The region is celebrated for its wines, and most restaurants have a good
selection of local vintages on hand.
Southwest of Tours are the castles of Azay-le-Rideau (20km/13 miles
from Tours), Chinon (48km/30 miles from Tours), and Ussé (34km/21
miles from Tours). Between Tours and Orléans are the castles of
Chenonceau (26km/16 miles from Tours, 87km/54 miles from Orléans),
Amboise (35km/22 miles from Tours, 77km/48 miles from Orléans),
Chaumont (40km/25 miles from Tours, 72km/45 miles from Orléans),
Blois (60km/37 miles from Tours, 53km/33 miles from Orléans), and
Chambord (77km/48 miles from Tours, 18km/11 miles from Orléans). 
See the map, “The Loire Valley,” for a visual reference.
Although you can get to almost all the châteaux by public transportation
(with the exception of Ussé), the most efficient way to explore the region
is by rental car. With a car, you can give a smaller sight a quick once-
over in a couple of hours and spend half a day or longer exploring some
of the more interesting towns and châteaux. If you want to drive from
Paris, see Chapter 11 about where to rent a car; if you want to drive from
Tours, see the rental information in Chapter 14. If you want to set out
from Orléans, see the rental information near the end of this chapter.
Azay-le-Rideau: A Renaissance Masterpiece
The only attraction in the pretty little village of Azay-le-Rideau (with
houses from the tenth century onward) is the castle, and it’s one of the
Loire Valley’s most beautiful, nestled between two branches of a sleepy
river. The château presents a dramatic sound-and-light show in summer.
It takes about an hour to explore the village — a brochure, in French,
with a map showing the route of a self-guided walking tour is available

The Loire Valley
Chapter 15: The Best of the Loire Valley 259
from the tourist office (place de l’Europe; % 02-47-45-44-40). The tour
leads you past half-timbered medieval houses, an 11th-century church,
and an ivy-covered mill along the slow-moving Indre River. July and
August, the office is open Monday to Saturday 9 a.m. to 7 p.m. and
Sunday 10 a.m. to 8 p.m.; May, June, and September, the hours are Mon-
day to Saturday 9 to 1 p.m. and 2 to 6 p.m., Sunday 10 a.m. to 1 p.m. and
2 to 5 p.m.; October to April Monday to Saturday 9 a.m. to 1 p.m. and 
2 to 6 p.m. Because Azay is only 21km (13 miles) from both Tours and
Chinon, many people bike to this site.

Getting there
If you’re driving from Tours, take D759 southwest, 21km (13 miles) to
Azay-le-Rideau. You can catch a bus or train from Tours or Chinon (see
“Chinon: Three Castles in One” later in this chapter). The train from
Tours (six per day) takes 30 minutes and costs 4.60€ ($6); the bus takes
45 minutes and costs 4.60€ ($6). From Chinon to Azay, the train and bus
take 20 minutes and cost 4.10€ ($5.35). For train and bus schedules, call
% 08-92-35-35-35 or 3635 for English-speaking assistance.
Azay-le-Rideau is 261km (162 miles) from Paris, and the drive takes three
to four hours. If driving from Paris, follow A10 to Tours and then D759 to
Azay-le-Rideau. You can take an express train from Paris to Tours and
change to a local train or bus that travels to Azay-le-Rideau. The trip
from Paris to Tours takes about one hour and costs 39€ ($51).
Getting around
Everything you want to see in Azay-le-Rideau is within walking distance
of the center. The bus stop is across from the tourist office, which is
next door to the town’s most historic hotel. Several other hotels and
restaurants are within a few blocks. The castle is a three-minute stroll
from the tourist office.
Be forewarned that the Azay train station is a 25-minute walk (2.5km/
12⁄3 miles) from the center of town, and no taxi service exists. Head to Le
Provost (13 rue Carnot; % 02-47-45-40-94) for bike rentals, which cost
8€ ($10) for half a day and 12€ ($16) for a full day. During July and
August, it’s open Tuesday to Saturday 9 a.m. to noon and 2 to 7 p.m.;

Spending the night
If you’re looking for ultra-upscale country house experience, reserve a
room at the Château d’Artigny, along D17 (% 02-47-34-30-30; Fax: 02-47-
34-30-39; www.artigny.com), near Azay-le-Rideau in the hamlet of Mont-
bazon. The castle was built in the early 1900s for perfume/cosmetic king
François Coty and now offers 65 gorgeous rooms (160€–410€/$208–$533)
and serves superb food.

This hotel is the town’s most modern accommodation, and although it’s

safes, and minibars) in its 27 generic but comfortable rooms. An elevator
takes you to the higher floors. The hotel is on the main road into town and
only a few minutes’ walk from the castle, so rooms in the front are noisy.

Seeing the castle
Nestled on an island between two branches of the slow-moving Indre
River, Château d’Azay-le-Rideau, in the center of town a few blocks from
the tourist office (% 02-47-45-42-04; www.monum.fr), is a Renaissance
masterpiece. Unlike some of the other châteaux, Azay was built and
occupied by nobles rather than royalty, so it’s less a fortress than a
grand home. The castle was begun around 1515 by Gilles Berthelot,
François I’s finance minister, in part to display his social ascension.
When Berthelot eventually fell out of favor, François seized the castle
but allowed it to remain empty. In the late 18th century, Charles de
Biencourt, a liberal-minded aristocrat, bought the property and restored
it to its former glory. At the beginning of the 20th century, the French
government purchased the property from an impoverished marquis, the
last of the Biencourts.
Before entering, circle the château to admire its perfect proportions.
Highlights are the Grand Staircase and the Biencourt drawing room,
decorated in 19th-century style. Among many interesting artworks in 
the castle is a copy of the painting Bathing Lady, a seminude portrait
believed to be of Diane de Poitiers, the mistress of Henri II.
A leisurely visit to the castle and grounds will take about one-and-a-half
hours. The castle offers no tours in English, but audioguides (4€/$5.20)
and free brochures are available in English. Admission is 7€ ($9.10) for
adults and 4.50€ ($5.85) for young people ages 18 to 25; free for children
younger than 18. The castle is open daily (except Jan 1, May 1, and Dec
25): April, May, June, and September 9:30 a.m. to 6 p.m.; July and August
9:30 a.m. to 7 p.m.; October to March 9:30 a.m. to 12:30 p.m. and 2 to 5:30
p.m. The last entrance is 45 minutes before closing.
Between May and September, the château is the venue for a sound-and-
light display, Songes et Lumières, where the romantic majesty of the
castle’s history is emphasized and celebrated. Performances begin,
depending on a complicated schedule of seasonal changes, between 9:30
and 10:30 p.m., last for two hours, and make frequent references to the
Part IV: Tours and the Loire Valley Châteaux 
262

glories, ghosts, and deceptions of the ancien régime. During July and
August, performances take place nightly; during September, they’re
staged only Friday through Saturday. Tickets to the event cost 9€ ($12)
for adults and 5€ ($6.50) for young people ages 12 to 25; children
younger than 12 are free. Tickets for the castle and the nighttime per-
formance cost 12€ ($16) for adults, 7€ ($9.10) ages 12 to 25; free for 
children younger than 12.
Chinon: Three Castles in One
The small town of Chinon is home to one of the oldest châteaux in
France and boasts a good number of medium-priced hotels and restau-
rants, and a restored medieval quarter. A number of interesting sights
are within biking distance of the town (such as the Château d’Ussé), so
this area is a good base. Chinon’s château, perched on a bluff high above
the town, is actually the ruins of three fortresses. Although the château
is mainly ruins, it offers plenty to see, so you need to allow a couple of
hours to explore the site.
You can best appreciate the beauty of Chinon by viewing it from across
the river Vienne, where you can see how the castle ruins rise above the
town. Another great view is from high up on the castle ramparts, where
you can look out over the town rooftops (all pointed spires like in a
fairy-tale village) and just beyond the town to the acres of vineyards
where workers harvest grapes for the famous red Chinon wine (you can
try this wine at any of the area cafes or vineyards).
Chinon’s medieval quarter has cobblestone streets and well-restored
half-timbered buildings. If you wander around, you may happen on rue
de la Lamproie and the 16th-century house where Chinon’s most
famous son, humanist writer François Rabelais, was reared. On rue
Voltaire, a sign explains that Joan of Arc arrived in Chinon on March 6,
1429. Joan is honored in town by various plaques, a small museum (on
the castle grounds), and a waxworks representation of that famous
moment in history. The tourist office is at place Hossheim (% 02-47-93-
17-85; www.chinon.com). May to September, it’s open daily 10 a.m. to 
7 p.m.; October to April, hours are Monday to Saturday 10 a.m. to noon
and 2 to 6 p.m. You can find the usual brochures, and the staff will help
you map your bike route or direct you to the best restaurants.
Getting there
Because Chinon’s train station handles only slow local trains, the fastest
way to get to Chinon from Paris is to take the speedy TGV (6–11 times
daily from Paris’s Gare Montparnasse) to Tours (see Chapter 14) and
then another train from the Tours station to Chinon. Trains linking Tours
and Chinon depart at the rate of ten per day, taking 45 minutes and cost-
ing 7.70€ ($10). For information and reservations, call % 08-92-35-35-35
or 3635 within France. The train station is 0.8km (a half-mile) walk from
town, so you may want to take a taxi.
Chapter 15: The Best of the Loire Valley 263

If you’re driving from Tours, take D759 southwest for 48.3km (30 miles);
the trip takes about 40 minutes. To drive the 283km (176 miles) from
Paris, which requires about three to four hours, follow A10 to Tours and
then D759 southwest to Chinon.
Getting around
Exploring Chinon on foot is easy, including the old section of town on
the far east side. You’ll find a number of places to see that are not far
from town if you have a rented car or bike. The place to rent bikes is
from the Bréhémont Agency positioned in front of the tourist office at
place Hossheim (% 08-03-89-23-14). Hours are daily 8 a.m. to noon and
2 to 8 p.m. (subject to change). A full day’s rental costs 15€ ($20). You
need to remind the pleasant staff here to give you a lock and a helmet.
The route out of Chinon is very steep, and you may have to walk your
bike for the first 15 minutes. It’s about an hour bike ride (14.5km/9 miles)
to Ussé, passing several other châteaux, attractive villages, and wine-
tasting opportunities.

Seeing the castle and more
Getting to the Château de Chinon (% 02-47-93-13-45) is a steep walk.
Actually the ruins of three castles going back to the Middle Ages, this
site is definitely worth seeing. From 1427 to 1450, Charles VII lived here
almost continually, and Chinon briefly became his capital city and the
most important castle in France. But the most famous event to occur
here was in 1429, when a peasant girl named Joan arrived at the castle
and inspired Charles to drive the English out of France.
Château du Milieu, at the center of the site, includes the reconstructed
royal apartments, with tapestries, antique furniture, illuminated manu-
scripts, and a waxworks tableau of the fateful meeting between Joan of
Arc and Charles VII. Courtiers tried to test Joan by asking her to pick the
disguised Charles out of the crowd. When she chose correctly, Charles
was so impressed that he agreed to attempt to recapture his kingdom
from the invading English. As presented here, Joan’s choice doesn’t
appear too miraculous: Dopey-looking Charles is the one in the purple
tunic and the pointiest shoes. The actual place of the meeting, the Main
Hall, is a roofless ruin next to the restored building.
At the far western end of the site is what’s left of the Château de Cou-
dray: several towers and dungeons, including the cylindrical Tour de
Coudray, one of the best-preserved examples of a keep in France.
Donjon de Coudray is where members of the order of Templars were
imprisoned in 1308. The Templars were a wealthy community of military
monks — yes, you read that right — founded to protect Christian realms.
You can visit the dungeon if you don’t mind going down about five flights
of steps into the moldy depths of a cellar.
At the entrance to the site, the clock tower contains the Joan of Arc
museum — three floors and seven small rooms of Joan collectibles, such
as postcards, dinner plates, and posters. It’s a bit scattershot but still
mildly interesting. All that remains of Château de St-Georges, built in the
12th century, are ruins near the entrance to the site. After touring the
buildings and towers, you may enjoy the view over the steeply pitched
slate roofs in town to the vineyards beyond.
Allow yourself an hour to see the site and wander the grounds. Admis-
sion to the site is 6€ ($7.80) for adults and 4.50€ ($5.85) for children 7 
to 18. The château has no audioguides, but tours are given in English at
9:45 a.m., 11:25 a.m., 2:25 p.m., 3:50 p.m., and 5:15 p.m. Tour times may
change, so call the castle at % 02-47-93-13-45 to confirm. The château is
open daily (except Jan 1 and Dec 25): April to September 9 a.m. to 7 p.m.,
October to March 9:30 a.m. to 5 p.m.
In town, the musty Musée du Vieux Chinon (44 rue Haute St-Maurice; 
% 02-47-93-18-12) has rather extensive and interesting collections
Chapter 15: The Best of the Loire Valley 267

detailing the history of Chinon. The museum is housed in a 15th-century
building containing the Salle des Etats-Générale, the grand room where
the Estates General met in 1428. In this second-floor room, you can pay
homage to Chinon’s favorite son, François Rabelais, at his 1833 portrait
by Delacroix, which was restored by the Louvre. On the first floor,
chained leopards face off on the cape of St. Mexme, part of a 12th-
century silk fabric that’s the largest textile from this period in France.
The top floor displays the work of compagnonnage (master craftsmen)
from the town. On view are decorative parts of two porcelain heating
units from the end of the ancien régime. Explanatory brochures, written
in English, are available at the entrance. Admission is 3€ ($3.90) for
adults and 1.50€ ($1.95) for children. June to September daily 2 to 6 p.m.;
October to May Monday to Friday 2 to 6 p.m. (more hours available 
with appointment).
Nearby, between Chinon and Ussé, is the 15th-century Château de la
Grille (% 02-47-93-01-95), a 50-hectare (125-acre) winery owned by the
Gosset family, who have been winemakers for 14 generations. Free tast-
ings of the special Chinon wine are offered in July and August Monday to
Saturday 10 a.m. to 6:30 p.m., and September to June Monday to
Saturday 9 a.m. to noon and 2 to 6 p.m. English is spoken here.
Living it up after dark
La Licorne (15 rue Rabelais; % 02-47-93-94-94) is a large brasserie and
English pub where everyone hangs out. A quarter-size of Chinon wine
goes for 3.50€ ($4.55), which you can sample with all the typical cafe
fare served here.
Ussé: Fit for Sleeping Beauty
The tiny village of Ussé, near the intersection of the rivers Indre and
Loire, is home to the privately owned château that was supposedly the
inspiration for the story of Sleeping Beauty, written by Charles Perrault
(rumor has it that he stayed here in the 17th century). The French call
the castle, with its glistening white stone and soaring turrets and towers,
Château de la Belle au Bois Dormant (Castle of the Beauty of the Sleeping
Woods). You can easily picture beautiful ladies and brave lords strolling
through the long halls and monumental stairways. While Ussé itself is a
blink-and-you-miss-it kind of place, the château is worth a visit, particu-
larly for children, who may enjoy the waxworks reconstruction of the
Sleeping Beauty story that’s set up in a tower.
Getting there
If you’re driving, take D7 southwest from Tours, following it for about 30
minutes. From Chinon, follow the signs north out of town. Ussé is about
a five- to ten-minute drive from Chinon. If you’re coming from Paris, take
A10 to Tours and then D7 to Ussé (about a three-hour drive). Ussé is a
flat and easy 14.5km (9-mile) bike ride from Chinon; the tourist office in

Seeing the castle
The privately owned Château d’Ussé (% 02-47-95-54-05) is set on a hill
overlooking the River Indre. The Blacas family has lived here since the
19th century, occupying the left wing. Work began on the castle in 1455
on the foundations of an 11th-century fortress, but the castle today
reflects its 16th-century conversion into a country château for gentry.
You can see Gothic (15th-century), Renaissance (16th-century), and clas-
sical (17th-century) architectural influences. The grounds are beautifully
landscaped, with formal 17th-century gardens designed by Le Nôtre,
who created the gardens at Versailles. Among other century-old trees is
a majestic cedar of Lebanon that was a gift in 1808 from writer
Châteaubriand, a friend of the castle owner.
Though the castle has no audioguide, brochures in English are available
at the beginning of the tour. A French guide (three to five guided tours
are offered per day) starts the tour at the small 1528 chapel, which has a
pretty Renaissance porch with 12 carved apostles. The stone used in the
chapel is from the region and retains its sparkling white color without
restoration. Among the exterior’s decorative elements are two gargoyles.
Inside the chapel are ribbed vaulting and 16th-century carved wood
choir stalls and a collection of Luca della Robbia ceramics from Florence.
The écurie, close to the chapel entrance, is a garage-type building hold-
ing six antique vehicles, including a dog chariot, a 1920s horse-drawn
car, and a 19th-century wicker carriage. Behind the chapel, caves used
to store wine are set up with wax figures in a basic and somewhat
humorous explanation of winemaking at the castle.

The guide leads you through half a dozen castle rooms fully decorated
with interesting antiques. More than other Loire Valley châteaux, Ussé
feels “lived in,” as the owners have restored period details such as the
18th-century silks on the walls and 17th-century oak parquet floors.
Most of the original 18th-century furniture was made for the château.
You’ll also find collections owned by the resident marquis de Blacas,
including weaponry and oriental objects from the Far East, brought
home by Comte Stanislas de Blacas. Mannequins in several of the rooms
display items from the family’s extensive antique clothing collection.
After the tour, you can climb the round tower on your own to see the
elaborately set up waxworks of the Sleeping Beauty story, featuring the
Wicked Fairy, as well as rooms displaying 19th-century children’s toys

Chenonceau: Château des Dames
The small village of Chenonceaux consists of about half a dozen hotels,
a few restaurants, a couple of shops, and the most beautiful castle in the
Loire Valley, the Château de Chenonceau (note that the town’s name
ends with an x but the château’s doesn’t). You won’t soon forget your
first image of this grand edifice, with its graceful arches creating a cov-
ered bridge over the pastoral Cher River. After spending a couple of
hours exploring the castle and gardens, you can wander a few blocks to
your hotel and enjoy the serenity of Chenonceaux after the tour buses
have left. Better yet, wander back to the castle for the nighttime sound-
and-light show, which takes place daily in summer (see “Seeing the
castle” later in this section for details). The tourist office is at 1 rue
Bretonneau (% 02-47-23-94-45). Mid-April to October, it’s open Monday
to Saturday 10 a.m. to 1 p.m. and 2 to 7 p.m.; November to early April,
hours are Monday to Saturday 10 a.m. to noon and 2 to 6 p.m. and
Sunday 2 to 6 p.m.
Getting there
Six trains per day and a couple of buses travel from Tours to Chenon-
ceaux. The train trip from Tours takes 30 minutes and costs 5.50€
($7.15) each way. For information and reservations, call % 08-92-35-
35-35 or 3635 from within France. The train stop is located a block from 
the center of the village, next to the château entrance. Buses traveling
between Tours and Chenonceaux cost 5.50€ ($7.15) and take an hour.
The drive from Paris takes about two-and-a-half hours: follow A10 
past Blois, then D31 south past Amboise to N76 east, which leads to
Chenonceaux. From Tours, take N76 east to Chenonceaux; it’s about a
half-hour drive.

Seeing the castle
The “château des dames,” the 16th-century Château de Chenonceau
(% 02-47-23-90-07; www.chenonceau.com), is the Loire Valley’s most
beautiful castle, set on graceful arches above the River Cher. Because
this is everybody’s favorite, it’s always very crowded, but even with 30
buses full of tourists swarming around, it’s still a magical place. You
enter by walking down a long tree-lined path passing though a grand
entrance framed by sphinxes and then down another long path lined by
orange trees. In front of the castle are two lush formal gardens, one
commissioned by Henri II’s queen, Catherine de’ Medici, and the other
by her rival and Henri’s mistress, Diane de Poitiers.
About a dozen castle rooms are open, all decorated with elaborately
painted beams, period antiques, and an extensive collection of Flemish
tapestries. Downstairs, you can visit the kitchens and pantry. In other
rooms, you’ll see a number of fine paintings, including Virgin with
Child by Murillo and Archimedes by Zurburan, and works thought to be
by Rubens, Van Dyck, and Poussin. You’ll even find a dour portrait of
Catherine de’ Medici, who brought her Italian influence to the architec-
ture of the castle. Originally, Henri II gave Chenonceau to the enchanting
Diane, 20 years his senior; but after the king’s death in a 1559 jousting
tournament, Catherine forced her husband’s “favorite” to move to the
less desirable Chaumont (see the next section).
Chapter 15: The Best of the Loire Valley 273

The castle contains Diane’s bedroom, an alluring portrait of her as Diana
the Huntress, and a case containing a copy of her signature. After oust-
ing Diane, Catherine moved into Chenonceau and brought workmen
from Italy to embellish it with Renaissance style. The château’s signature
Gallery, with its dramatic arches over the river, was built at this time; in
Catherine’s day, it was used as a ballroom, but today it’s sometimes used
to display the works of contemporary artists.
The Galerie des Dames, a waxworks museum, is in the former royal sta-
bles on the castle grounds. The exhibits feature the women who lived at
Chenonceau, with special attention to fabrics and costumes. Also on the
grounds are a cafe, a restaurant, a 16th-century farm with a tiny duck
pond, a playground, and a flower shop, where you can buy one of the
special rosebushes grown in the gardens. The castle property also fea-
tures 40 hectares (98 acres) of grapevines that are handpicked. You can
buy the wine produced from these grapes at a wine shop on site.
To avoid the scores of tour buses, try visiting the castle very late in the
day, very early in the day, or at lunchtime.
Allow a couple of hours to see the château and wander the glorious 
gardens. The château is open March 1 to September 16, daily 9 a.m. to 
7 p.m.; closing hours vary from 4:30 to 6 p.m. during the rest of the year.
Admission is 9€ ($12) for adults, 7.50€ ($9.75) for children ages 7 to 18
and for students up to age 27; admission to the waxworks museum is an
additional 1.50€ ($1.95) per person. July and August, a sound-and-light
show called Les Dames de Chenonceau is presented nightly 9:30 to 
11 p.m., costing 5€ ($6.50). The castle is illuminated, and music, 
singing, and historic commentary are broadcast over loudspeakers.
Chaumont: Exile of Diane de Poitiers
High above the Loire, with sweeping views of the countryside,
Chaumont is one of Europe’s greatest castles. However, the tiny village
really has nothing but the château, so you’ll probably want to hit this
one as a half-day stop on the way to Amboise (to the west) or Blois (to
the east). Built as a fortress in the Middle Ages, the castle was rein-
vented as an aristocrats’ manor house in the 19th century, and the in-
teriors reflect this use. In between, it witnessed a lot of history, including
the banishment of Diane de Poitiers, the mistress of Henri II. Henri’s wife,
Catherine de’ Medici, forced Diane to move out of Chenonceau (see the
previous section) and into Chaumont after Henri’s death in 1559. The
most unique part of this site is the luxurious stables.
The tourist office is on rue du Maréchal-Leclerc (% 02-54-20-91-73); it’s
open daily 9:30 a.m. to 12:30 p.m. and 1:30 to 7 p.m.
Part IV: Tours and the Loire Valley Châteaux

Getting there
If you’re driving, follow A10 from Blois or D751 from Amboise (about 20
minutes from either). From Paris, take A10 to Blois, and continue for
another 24km (15 miles) until you see signs for Chaumont. It’s about
two-and-a-half hours from Paris by car. You have to park in the village
and walk quite a distance up a tree-lined hill to the château.
Seven daily trains travel from Tours or Blois to Onzain, about 2.5km (11⁄2
miles) north of the château, located on the other side of the Loire. You
have to walk from the train station to the château. For information and
reservations, call % 08-92-35-35-35 or 3635 from within France. Trip time
from Blois to Chaumont is 15 minutes, costing 2.90€ ($3.75) one way; trip
time from Tours is 45 minutes, a one-way fare going for 6.90€ ($8.95).

Seeing the castle
Château de Chaumont (% 02-54-51-26-26) is a delightful residence set
high above the Loire. Its clear strategic position, with views to the east
and west, betrays its original use as a fortress stronghold constructed at
the end of the Middle Ages. The original building was burned to the
ground, and construction on the present château, with its battlements
and turrets, began in 1465 and ended in the 16th century.
This château’s most famous occupant was Diane de Poitiers, beautiful
mistress to Henri II. When Henri II died, his powerful and embittered
wife, Catherine de’ Medici, forced Diane to give up the exquisite Château
de Chenonceau in exchange for exile at Chaumont, a lesser residence.
During the 18th and 19th centuries, various aristocrats used the château
as a private residence; it maintains that air today. Most notably, Princesse
Marie-Charlotte de Broglie, the heiress to the fortune of the Say (a huge
Chapter 15: The Best of the Loire Valley 275

sugar importer), supervised extensive restorations to the château in
1875 with her husband, Prince Amedée de Broglie. Marie-Charlotte, one
of two daughters of an extremely wealthy sugar importer, first bought
the castle and then married the prince. She commissioned the architect
to turn it into a luxurious home. But the life of splendor caught up with
her, and after the prince died, she lost her fortune in the stock market
crash of 1929. The French government bought the castle in 1938. In the
center of the library is a display case containing notable terra-cotta
medallions by potter Jean-Baptiste Nini, who lived at Chaumont from
1772 to 1786. These medallions depict famous guests of the castle,
including Benjamin Franklin, and royalty of the period, such as Louis XV,
Louis XVI, and Marie Antoinette. The Ruggieri Chamber is where
Catherine de’ Medici’s royal astrologer, Cosimo Ruggieri, stayed; a sinis-
ter portrait of him is near the door. The Broglies commissioned the 
elaborate stables on the property, which were equipped with the latest
equine amenities. Prince and Princesse de Broglie were also responsible
for laying out Chaumont’s elaborate park. At one time covering more
than 2,400 hectares (about 6,000 acres), the park now encompasses 21
hectares (52 acres) on the plateau surrounding the castle.
Allow yourself an hour to see the castle and stables. The château is open
daily (except Jan 1, May 1, Nov 1 and 11, and Dec 25): June to August
9:30 a.m. to 6 p.m.; September to March 10 a.m. to 5 p.m.; April to May
10:30 a.m. to 5:30 p.m. Admission is 6.50€ ($8.45) for adults and 4.50€
($5.85) for students; free for children younger than 18. Brochures, writ-
ten in English, are available for self-guided tours.
From late April to late October at the château, the annual Festival
International des Jardins presents the best of contemporary garden
designers and attracts visitors from all across France. Admission is
8.50€ ($11) for adults and 4€ ($5.20) for children ages 8 to 12. For more
information, call % 02-54-20-99-22.
Blois: Château of Royalty
Blois is a good-sized town with wide shop-lined boulevards and winding

Blois
TOURAINE
Get ready for a delightful evening at this seafood restaurant, down a
narrow winding road on the far west end of town. Chef/owner Christophe
Cosme greets you at the door, takes your order, and bids you adieu at the
end of your meal. That service and consideration would be enough to
bring us back, but it’s the outstanding, creative food that makes this place
most memorable. Order the market menu, for which the chef uses the
freshest products to concoct superb dishes. Two highlights are the flan
d’écrévisses (freshwater crayfish tart with Vouvray wine) and the pairing
of dos de cabillau (cooked codfish) with sausage and black olives. Although
the specialty is seafood, meat eaters will find a few choices on the menu.

Seeing the castle and town
Murder, mayhem, and intrigue — it all took place at the Château de
Blois (% 02-54-90-33-32), which 400 years of royalty called home. You’ll
have plenty to see here, including the history of French architecture
from the Middle Ages to the 17th century. The château, constructed in
the 10th century, is made up of four stylistically distinct wings joined by
a large courtyard.
Located in the château is the medieval Salle des Etats-Généraux, a 13th-
century Gothic construction containing a grand conference room and a
lapidary museum with original carvings and sculptures from the castle.
Aile de Louis XII was built from 1498 to 1503 in the Flamboyant Gothic
style; a fine arts museum is in the former royal apartments located in
this wing. For fans of the grotesque: Don’t miss the portrait L’Hirsutism
Part IV: Tours and the Loire Valley Châteaux 
280

of Antoinetta Gonsalvus; this young girl was the victim of a horrible
hereditary disease that causes long hair to grow on the face. You can
also find a fine collection of ironwork and a display of keys and locks.
Architectural historians call the Aile de François I, built from 1515 to
1524, a French Renaissance masterpiece, particularly for its exterior
spiral staircase tower. François I was a king of extravagant tastes; he had
the immense Château de Chambord (see later in this chapter) built to
prove the supremacy of the monarchy. This wing at Blois contains apart-
ments once lived in by François; his daughter-in-law, Catherine de’
Medici (wife of Henri II); and his grandson, Henri III. Catherine’s study
contains hidden cabinets where she stored her poisons. The third floor
contains the room where the infamous murder of the duc de Guise took
place in 1588. Henri III, who wanted to prevent a coup attempt by the
powerful duke, planned the murder. A whole room is devoted to paint-
ings of the dastardly deed, and it’s explained in detail in a brochure.
Galerie Gaston d’Orléans, built from 1635 to 1637, is a tour de force of
French classical architecture designed by François Mansart. Gaston
d’Orléans was Louis XIII’s brother and a powerful member of the court 
of Louis XIII.
Allow a couple of hours for your visit. The château is open daily (except
Dec 25 and Jan 1): April to September 9 a.m. to 6:30 p.m. and the rest of
the year 9 to 12:30 p.m. and 2 to 5:30 p.m. Last admittance is at 5 p.m.
Admission is 6.50€ ($8.45) for adults, 3€ ($3.90) for students ages 12 
to 17, and 3€ ($3.90) for children ages 6 to 11. Brochures, written in
English, are available for a self-guided tour. Parking is available on
avenue Jean-Laigret across from the tourist office.
From mid-April to late-September (except June 21 and July 13), a sound-
and-light show takes place nightly 10 to 10:30 p.m. at Château de Blois;
the show is presented in English on Wednesday in May, June, and
September. The show costs 6.50€ ($8.45) for adults and 3€ ($3.90) for
children ages 6 to 20. For more information, call % 02-54-90-33-32.
In the town of Blois, Cathédrale St-Louis, built from the 12th to the 17th
centuries in a predominantly Gothic style, is a handsome church with a
stormy history. It’s the fifth church built on the site; the others were
destroyed by one disaster after another. In 1678, a hurricane left the
building in ruins. Underground, the 11th-century Carolingian crypt St-
Solenne is worth seeing — it was built to house the tomb of the saint, and
enlarged several times to accommodate the numerous pilgrims who
wanted to visit the site. As a result, it’s one of France’s largest medieval
crypts. The cathedral is open daily 9 a.m. to 6 p.m., and admission is free.
Also worth a visit is the 12th-century Eglise St-Nicolas on rue St-Laumen
in the medieval section of town, where you can see modern stained-glass
windows in an ancient edifice. The old windows were destroyed during
bombing in 1940. The brochure tactfully says that “this modern lighting
plan is a subject open to discussion.” We bet it caused quite a bit of dis-
cussion, but the windows are quite glorious, forming Cubist-type patterns

admission is free.
Shopping
You’ll actually find some good shopping opportunities in Blois, particu-
larly on rue St-Martin and rue du Commerce. The best toy store is Du
Coté du Bois (19 rue Porte Côté; % 02-54-56-84-83), which specializes in
wooden toys and puppets. Antiques buffs should try Langlois Tapisseries
(1 rue de la Voûte du Château; % 02-54-78-04-43). Chocoholics flock to
Jeff de Bruges (77 rue du Commerce; % 02-54-74-26-44) and Max Vauché
(50 rue du Commerce; % 02-54-78-23-55), who elevate chocolate-making
to a fine art. On Saturday mornings, a food market is open on rue 
St-Lubin, lining several blocks in the center of town at the foot of the
château.
Living it up after dark
The town’s cybercafe is L’Etoile Tex (7 rue du Bourg-Neuf; % 02-54-78-
46-93), which serves Mexican and Italian food. Other fun bars include
Au Bureau (1 rue du Chant des Oiseaux; % 02-54-56-81-81), an old-
fashioned pub. The nearest disco (10km/61⁄4 miles from Blois) is Le
Charleston on Route de Nozieux (% 02-54-20-61-06).
Amboise: A Fortified Château 
and Leonardo’s Mansion
One of the most charming towns in the Loire Valley is Amboise, with a
stately fortified château perched above the village and antique cobble-
stone streets made just for strolling. This town is also the town where
Leonardo da Vinci spent his last years; you can visit his manor house,
which remains pretty much as he left it when he died here in 1519. The
tourist office (7 quai du Général-de-Gaulle; % 02-47-57-09-28) has a
good walking-tour map and can help you plan day trips to nearby sites.
During July and August, the office is open Monday to Saturday 9 a.m. to
8 p.m. and Sunday 10 a.m. to 6 p.m.; September to June Monday to
Saturday 9:30 a.m. to 1 p.m. and 2 to 6:30 p.m. and Sunday 10 a.m. to 
1 p.m. and 3 to 6 p.m.; October to May, hours are Monday to Saturday 
10 a.m. to 1 p.m. and 2 to 6 p.m. and Sunday 10 a.m. to 1 p.m.
Getting there
Amboise is centrally located between Tours and Blois, with 14 trains per
day making the trip from each town, taking about 20 minutes and costing
about 4.50€ ($5.40). Trains also arrive in Amboise from Paris’s Gare
d’Austerlitz, taking two-and-a-half hours and costing 25€ ($30). For
schedules and information, call % 08-92-35-35-35 or 3635 from within
France.

The driving route to Amboise from Tours or Orléans is N152 east or
west, respectively; the trip takes about 45 minutes from either town.
From Paris, it’s a two-hour drive, taking A10 to the exit for Château-
Renault and then D31 to Amboise.
Getting around
You can rent bikes by the day or the week at Loca Cycle (2 bis rue Jean-
Jacques-Rousseau; % 02-47-57-00-28), open daily 9 a.m. to 12:30 p.m.

Seeing the castle and Leonardo’s home
Six successive kings of France, from Charles VII to Henri II, lived at and
modified the glorious Château d’Amboise (% 02-47-57-00-98; www.
chateau-amboise.com), set on a rock high above the town. Perhaps the
most influential was François I, who befriended master artist Leonardo
da Vinci and set him up domestically just down the road at Le Clos Lucé.
(An underground tunnel united the two residences so that the king could
visit his court’s genius, and vice versa, without mixing with the common
people.) As originally built, the heavily fortified castle was a massive
tower of stone evoking the Dark Ages, but it fell victim to successive
attacks over hundreds of years. In the 15th century, French kings
brought Renaissance improvements and embellishments, and renova-
tions in the 16th century created a castle five times bigger than what
exists today. But 400 years of battles and neglect left it a shadow of its
former glory, and it was used mainly as a jail. France’s last king, Louis-
Philippe, presided over much the same edifice we see today.
The castle has been the setting for a host of historic events, including
the rather undignified death of Charles VIII, who in 1498 fatally hit his
Part IV: Tours and the Loire Valley Châteaux 
284

head on a low doorway. His widow, Anne de Bretagne, didn’t miss a 
beat — she married his successor, Louis XII, the following year. Then
came the Amboise Conspiracy in 1560, when Protestants stormed the
castle in the name of reform. Leaders of the movement were hanged or
beheaded within the château walls. And the St. Bartholomew’s Day
Massacre in 1572 involved more bloody violence toward Protestants.
A brochure, written in English, assists you in a self-guided tour of the
castle, where you’ll wander through 11 rooms filled with an impressive
collection of armor, tapestries (don’t miss the tributes to Alexander the
Great), paintings (note the portraits of Louis XIII and Henri IV), and
antique furniture. The third floor features rooms with Restoration and
First Empire antiques from the time Louis-Philippe spent at the château.
You can find a portrait of Louis-Philippe in the music room. After wan-
dering through the castle, head to the far northwest corner of the
grounds near the entrance ramp to check out the beautiful Flamboyant
Gothic Chapelle de St-Hubert, built in 1496, where it is alleged that
Leonardo da Vinci is buried.
Allow yourself at least an hour to see Amboise. The château is open
daily (except Dec 25 and Jan 1): January 2 to January 31 9 a.m. to noon
and 2 to 4:45 p.m.; February 1 to March 15 9 a.m. to noon and 1:30 to

Leonardo da Vinci lived out his final four years about a kilometer (half-
mile) from the castle at Le Clos Lucé (% 02-47-57-00-73; www.vinci-
closluce.com), a brick-and-stone mansion given to him by François I.
He died at the house on May 2, 1519. The house contains Leonardo’s fine
Louis XV furniture, including the bed where he drew his last breath. The
basement is the attraction’s highlight: 40 models based on Leonardo’s
drawings of airplanes, helicopters, parachutes, tanks, and other machines
of war. You can sit in the Italian Renaissance rose garden behind the
house and sip tea at the cafe. The house is open daily (except December
25 and January 1): January 10 a.m. to 5 p.m.; February to March 9 a.m.

Chambord: The Loire’s Largest Château
Most people’s jaws drop when they first see the château at Chambord, a
fantastic jumble of soaring turrets and belfries, graceful arches, and
dormers. And that’s just what François I wanted: the most impressive
château ever built. Allow yourself plenty of time to explore the interior,
with its refined Renaissance spaces, which are in stark contrast to its
colossal opulent facade. The pièce de résistance is the monumental
double staircase, with a design helped along by Leonardo da Vinci. Next
to the castle you won’t find anything but a hotel/restaurant and a few
little tourist shops. Chambord also claims Europe’s largest enclosed
forest, stretching for more than 5,200 hectares (13,000 acres). This castle
is our pick for best château — if you can visit only one. The small tourist
office (place St-Michel; % 02-54-33-39-16) is open mid-June to October
daily 10 a.m. to 5:30 p.m.
Getting there
Buses (% 02-54-58-55-44) make the circuit from Chambord to Blois
(20km/121⁄2 miles) three times a day. The trip takes 45 minutes and costs
3.75€ ($4.90).
If you’re driving from Paris, follow A10 south to Orléans and then D951
southwest from Orléans (about two hours). From Blois, take D951 east
(about 15 minutes). If you’re driving from Orléans, take D951 southwest
(about 35 minutes) and follow the signs to Chambord.
Getting around
The castle is just about the only thing of interest in the tiny village of
Chambord. The village’s only hotel/restaurant is a former outbuilding of
the castle and is just a hop, skip, and a jump from the castle entrance.
The bus company (% 02-54-90-41-41) gives tours of Blois, Chambord,
and Cheverny, with buses departing from the train station in Blois. From
June to early September, tours depart daily at 9:10 a.m., 11:10 a.m. and
1:40 p.m., and return four hours later. The cost is 11€ ($14) for adults
and 8.60€ ($11) for children. You can buy tickets at the Blois tourist
office.

Seeing the castle
Château de Chambord (% 02-54-50-40-00; www.monum.fr) is the
region’s largest and most elaborate castle (with 440 rooms, 365 chim-
neys, and 84 stairways). François I, the last of the kings from the Age of
Chivalry, built it. After a decisive military battle, François was crowned
king in 1515; he believed the best way to show the power of the monar-
chy was through extravagance, so his castles overflowed with riches and
courtiers (more than 1,800 at Chambord). Constructed between 1519
and 1545, Chambord was François’s hunting lodge, a kind of country
house used for sporting activities of all kinds — including amorous pur-
suits. Some of the château’s most innovative elements came from the
king’s pal, Leonardo da Vinci (see the preceding section on Amboise),
and you’ll see the innovative Italian’s ideas reflected in the castle’s sym-
metry, in its domes, and particularly in the double spirals used in its
famous central staircase.
The castle’s interior offers much to explore, including a luminous
chapel, designed partly by Jules Hardoin-Mansart. You first enter the
keep, where you’ll see the famous double spiral “corkscrew” staircase, a
masterpiece of the French Renaissance — one person can descend and
another ascend, and they won’t ever meet. Three levels of royal apart-
ments are filled with important paintings, tapestries, sculpture, and fur-
niture that are original to the residence. The third floor contains a
museum of hunting and animal art, which plays up Chambord’s history
as a hunting lodge. Finally, you may want to climb up to the roof to see
elements of the audacious architecture up close and to catch the
panoramic views of the canals and forests of Chambord.
Chapter 15: The Best of the Loire Valley 287

Long after François made Chambord his dream house, other powerful
and rich men upheld its traditions. In the early 18th century, Stanislas
Leszczynski, king of Poland, lived there. After him, well-connected
Maurice de Saxe owned the residence for a couple of years. Saxe was
chummy with Louis V and managed to receive items from Versailles 
(various paintings and a marble fireplace) as gifts to decorate the
château. France eventually bought the property for 11 million francs 
and still plays host to official hunts for wild boar on the grounds. In
1983, the property was designated a World Heritage site.
You’ll have fun exploring the site, so allow yourself at least a couple of
hours to do so. The château is open daily (except Jan 1, May 1, and Dec
25) April to mid-July and late August to September 9 a.m. to 6:15 p.m.;
mid-July to late August 9 a.m. to 7:30 p.m.; October to March 9 a.m. to

ages 18 to 25. The audioguide costs 4€ ($5.20), and brochures, written in
English, are available. You can rent bikes and boats, next to the castle, to
explore the grounds and waterways.
Les Ecuries du Maréchal de Saxe, an equestrian spectacle, takes place
May, June, and September Monday to Friday at 11:45 a.m. and Saturday
and Sunday at 11:45 a.m. and 4:30 p.m. and daily July to August 11:45 a.m.

younger than 12.
Orléans: Saved by Joan of Arc
Orléans, sitting beside the mighty Loire River, is one of the oldest cities
in France. French kings established their dynasties in Orléans in the
Middle Ages before deciding to make Paris their capital. Royals in the
15th and 16th centuries were particularly fond of the Loire Valley, because
it was only two days’ ride on horseback from Paris. The city has also
had its share of misfortune through the ages. Attila the Hun came to
Orléans to make mischief in 451. Although that siege was unsuccessful,
many more were to come. The city’s heroine is the Maid of Orléans, Joan
of Arc, who saved it from a seven-month siege by the English on May 8,
1429, a major turning point in the Hundred Years’ War. Several sites are
devoted to Joan, and the city commemorates her bravery annually at
the Jeanne d’Arc Festival on May 7 and 8.
The primary tourist office is at 2 place de l’Etape (% 02-38-24-05-05;
www.tourisme-orleans.com). The office is open October to March
Monday to Saturday 10 a.m. to 1 p.m. and 2 to 6 p.m.; April to May
Monday to Saturday 9:30 a.m. to 1 p.m. and 2 to 6:30 p.m.; June to
September Monday to Saturday 9 a.m. to 1 p.m. and 2 to 7 p.m.; July to
August Monday to Saturday 9 a.m. to 7 p.m. and Sunday 10 a.m. to 1 p.m.

Getting there
The one-way train fare from Paris’s Gare d’Austerlitz is 17€ ($22), and
the trip can be as short as an hour nonstop or as long as one-and-three-
quarter hours with many stops. Another 12 trains per day travel from
Tours, taking about one-and-a-half hours and costing 15€ ($20). For
information and reservations, call % 08-92-35-35-35 or 3635 within
France.
Don’t get off the train one stop too soon at Les Aubrais Orléans — it’s
the suburban stop about 11.3km (7 miles) from the city.
If you’re driving, the trip takes about one-and-a-half hours from Paris on
A10. From Tours, head east on A10 for about one-and-a-half hours.
Getting around
You can rent a car near the train station at Avis (91 av. Andre-Desseaux;
% 02-38-62-27-04). Ecoto has an office nearby at 19 av. de Paris (% 02-
38-77-92-92). The Hertz office (248 bis Faubourg Bannier; % 08-25-86-
18-61) is several miles from the train station and the center of town, so
you’ll have to take a cab to get here. For a cab, call Taxi d’Orléans at 
% 02-38-53-11-11. To help get your bearings, see the nearby “Orléans” map.

Orléans
This 31-room hotel near the train station is a little worn at the seams, but
it has a lot of style, from the lobby with a terra-cotta Joan of Arc statue
and Art Deco posters to the individually decorated rooms. The same
family has run it since 1919. Most rooms are recently renovated, and some
have French balconies fronting this busy section of town (those in the back
are much quieter). Even the tiny units may have an added touch such as
a marble fireplace. Beware of the steep staircase (there’s no elevator).

accommodations on the second and third floors are more commodious
than the simpler rooms on the first floor, and those on the upper floors
open onto city views. The hotel’s location on the market square isn’t 
bad — it’s fairly quiet. The owner is gracious.

Exploring the town
Orléans is an easily navigated metropolis with several Romanesque
churches and a score of Renaissance buildings. The city’s train station is
located in a modern shopping mall. When you exit the shopping mall,
you can look down the impressive rue de la République, a wide boule-
vard (laid out with cable-car tracks in the 18th century) that leads down
to the Loire River. Walk a few blocks down rue de la République to place
du Martroi, where you’ll find a large 1855 statue of Joan of Arc (her
exploits are carved in bas-relief on the statue base). Beyond place du
Martroi, rue de la République becomes rue Royale, which has many fine
shops. Most of the city’s interesting sites and museums are on the left
side of rue de la République/rue Royale if you’re facing the river.
Cathédrale Ste-Croix (place Ste-Croix; % 02-38-77-87-50) was built
between 1607 to 1829 in a neo-Gothic style. Look for the 17th-century
organ and early 18th-century woodwork (some by Mansart) in the chan-
cel. The church is open daily 9:30 a.m. to 6 p.m., and admission is free.
Across the street is the Musée des Beaux-Arts (1 rue Fernand-Rabier; 
% 02-38-79-21-55), with five stories of 16th- to 19th-century French,
Dutch, and Flemish works, plus a very fine 20th-century art collection in
the basement. The museum also has a Velasquez painting, Apostle St.
Thomas. The fine arts museum is open Tuesday to Saturday 9:30 a.m. 
to 12:15 p.m. and 1:30 to 5:45 p.m., Sunday 2 to 6:30 p.m. (closed Jan 1, 
May 1, Nov 1, and Dec 25), and admission is 4€ ($5.20) for adults and 2€
($2.60) for students, free for children younger than 12.
Part IV: Tours and the Loire Valley Châteaux 
292

Around the corner from the fine arts museum is the Renaissance Hôtel
Groslot, the former city hall on place de l’Etape just north of the cathe-
dral. Built in 1550, the structure has been considerably altered through
the years and is now used for receptions and weddings. The interior deco-
ration is known as “Gothic Troubadour” style (try throwing that phrase
around at a cocktail party). In November 1560, François II, the 17-year-
old king of France, died in this mansion after suffering a “fainting fit”
during vespers at the nearby Eglise St-Aignan. Admission is free, and the
house is open Sunday to Friday 9 a.m. to 7 p.m. and Saturday 5 to 9 p.m.
You can also stroll through the harmonious and romantic gardens,
where fragments remain of a 15th-century chapel.
After visiting the Groslot, you can backtrack to the cathedral square and
walk down rue Jeanne-d’Arc, across rue Royale, to see a small museum
dedicated to Orléans’s favorite mademoiselle. Maison de Jeanne-d’Arc
(3 place de Gaulle; % 02-38-52-99-89) is a 20th-century reproduction of
the 15th-century house where Joan of Arc, the liberator and patron of
Orléans, stayed during her local heroics. The original house was much
modified and then destroyed by bombing in 1940. The first floor has tem-
porary exhibitions, and the second and third floors contain Joan-related
models and memorabilia. The house is open Tuesday to Sunday May to
October 10 a.m. to 12:30 p.m. and 1:30 to 6:30 p.m. and November to April
1:30 to 6 p.m. Admission is 2€ ($2.60) for adults, free for children.
You may gain a better appreciation of Orléans with a self-guided tour of
some of the city’s historic sites and gardens. At the tourist office, pick up
a brochure in English called the Orléans Architectural and Historical
Trail. Two of the forty-three sites on the trail — Louis Pasteur Park on
rue Jules-Lemaitre and the gardens of the Vieille Intendance at the
corner of rue Alsace-Lorraine and rue des Hugenots — are great places
that you may not stumble across if you wandered around without 
guidance.
Shopping for local treasures
One of the city’s main industries, from the Middle Ages to well into the
21st century, is vinegar making. You can buy some of the famous Orléans
vinegar north of Orléans at Vinaigre Martin Pouret (236 Faubourg
Bannier in Fleury-les-Aubrais; % 02-38-88-78-49). Carrying on his
family’s business founded in 1797, owner M. Pouret is the only person
left carrying on the slow, traditional vinegar-making method in the
region. You can do a wine tasting at the Cave de Marc & Sebastien
(7 place du Châtelet; % 02-38-62-94-11), which is located just north 
of the Loire, west of rue Royale.
Living it up after dark
Everyone feels at home at the Havana Café, 28 place du Châtelet (% 02-
38-52-16-00), which is packed most nights and stays open later than most
clubs (until 3 a.m. nightly). Bel Air, 44 rue du Poirier, a block south of
rue de Bourgogne (% 02-38-77-08-06), is a hip cocktail bar near the
Chapter 15: The Best of the Loire Valley 293

Halles Châtelet, the old market building. Nearby is Le Ka, alongside the
Halles Châtelet (% 02-38-53-08-79), with a DJ and small dance floor
(cover: 11€/$14). Paxton’s Head (264 rue de Bourgogne; % 02-38-81-
23-29) has live jazz on Saturday nights. To check your e-mail while you
sip a café, Médiathèque, place Gambetta (% 02-38-65-45-45), offers 
a trio of free computers with Internet access. Open year-round 
Tuesday, Wednesday, Friday, and Saturday 10 a.m. to 6 p.m., and
Thursday 1 to 8 p.m.

Part V
Normandy and
Brittany

In this part . . . 
T
ouring Normandy and Brittany on France’s west coast 
is a way to see some quintessential French countryside,
charming towns, and famous sights. In Chapter 16, we cover
the highlights of Normandy: rolling green hills, farmland, half-
timbered houses, medieval churches, and even the D-Day
beaches where 135,000 brave troops from the United States,
Canada, and Great Britain managed against all odds to charge
ashore and save Europe from the Nazis. It’s a dramatic story
that’s told and retold in small and large monuments and
museums along the coastline. Perhaps the most moving site
is the 70 hectares (173 acres) of simple white crosses at the
Normandy American cemetery near Omaha Beach. Nearby
you can see the renowned Bayeaux Tapestry, the medieval
scroll telling the story of when William the Conqueror of
Normandy invaded England and was crowned king. One of
France’s most famous sights is also in Normandy: Mont-St-
Michel, an abbey built on a rock just off the coast, has been a
pilgrimage site for more than a thousand years.
When French people talk of going to the shore, they often
mean the rugged coast of Brittany on the Atlantic Ocean. In
Chapter 17, we explore this ﬁercely proud, independent
region, which has its own language, and folk customs and cos-
tumes. A region of ﬁshermen and artisans, Brittany is a place
to eat oysters, buy Quimper pottery, and appreciate the tradi-
tions of a distinct community. Also in Brittany are France’s
largest prehistoric rock formations, hundreds of huge stones
aligned like obedient soldiers in Carnac, which also is a sea-
side resort.

 Following the footsteps of Joan of Arc in Rouen
 Deciphering the medieval Bayeux Tapestry
 Paying homage at the D-day beaches of World War II
 Climbing Mont-St-Michel to see one of Europe’s great marvels
O
ne of France’s most appealing regions, Normandy is less than two
hours from Paris by car or train. The capital is charming Rouen,
where half-timbered houses and ancient churches line pedestrian streets
paved with cobblestone. This was also the final resting place of France’s
favorite teenager, Joan of Arc, who was burned at the stake here by the
English; her ashes were thrown in the Seine. In the town of Bayeux, you
can find the famous tapestry that tells the story of how France came to
rule England for a brief time in the 11th century. Nearby are the D-day
beaches, where on June 6, 1944, about 135,000 soldiers from England,
the United States, and Canada landed in preparation for the seminal
battle of World War II. The ensuing Battle of Normandy, of course, led to
the liberation of Europe from the Nazis. Normandy also boasts one of
France’s most popular attractions, the abbey at Mont-St-Michel. Known
for years by pilgrims journeying to the site as La Merveille (The Marvel),
the abbey is set high on a rock just off the coast of Normandy.
Rouen: Capital of Normandy
Rouen, the ancient capital of Normandy, has been rebuilt after suffering
extensive bombing during World War II. But even if some of the half-
timbered houses are “merely the mock,” this remains a charming town
with offbeat museums and historic sites. The lively center is filled with
pedestrian streets lined with shops and restaurants. The 14th-century
Gros Horloge is a big clock set in a Renaissance gateway that straddles
the main pedestrian thoroughfare. Nearby is the Cathédrale Notre-Dame,
which Impressionist Claude Monet painted many times. The cathedral
and the impressive Gothic churches of St-Maclou and St-Ouen form a tri-
angle of spires that dominate the town. In the ancient market square, a
modern church was built in memory of Joan of Arc; its clever design
incorporates a market, a monument to St. Joan, and the ruins of a
church that stood on the site but was destroyed during World War II.

Getting there
Trains leave hourly from Paris’s Gare St-Lazare for Rouen’s Gare SNCF at
place Bernard-Tissot at the end of rue Jeanne-d’Arc. The trip takes from
70 minutes to one-and-three-quarter hours and costs 19€ ($25). For train
information, call % 08-92-35-35-35 or 3635 from within France. Gare
Routière (bus station) is at 25 rue des Charrettes. CNA buses (% 08-25-
07-60-27) travel from Rouen to the Abbaye de Jumièges (see “Exploring
the town,” later in this chapter). The trip takes 45 minutes and costs
around 3.40€ ($4.40).
Aéroport de Rouen is in Boos, 10km (6.2 miles) southeast of Rouen 
(% 02-35-79-41-00; www.rouen.aeroport.fr). No direct flights are
scheduled from Paris to the Rouen airport, although you can get direct
flights from Marseille, Nice, and Bordeaux. To get to the center of the
city from the airport, you need to take a taxi (% 02-35-61-20-50), costing
about 15€ to 17€ ($20–$22).
If you’re driving from Paris, take A13 west for 133km (84 miles). The trip
from Paris to Rouen is one-and-a-half hours.
Getting around and getting information
If you want to rent a car, try Avis at the Gare SNCF (place Bernard-Tissot;
% 02-35-88-60-94) next to the info counter; it’s open Monday to Satur-
day 8:15 a.m. to 12:15 p.m. and 2 to 6:30 p.m. Avis’s main booking number
is % 08-02-05-05-05. Hertz is across the street at 130 rue Jeanne-d’Arc
(% 02-35-70-70-71) and is open Monday to Saturday 8 a.m. to noon and
2 to 7 p.m. You can rent a bike at Cycles 76, 11 rue Lorraine-Alsace 
(% 02-35-71-52-69), for 11€ ($14) per half-day or 19€ ($25) for a whole
day. For a taxi, call % 02-35-88-50-50.
The tourist office is at 25 place de la Cathédrale (% 02-32-08-32-40; Fax:
02-32-08-32-44; www.rouentourisme.com). Housed in a magnificent
Renaissance building across from the cathedral, this office offers hotel
booking, money exchange (no commission), and guided two-hour walk-
ing tours (6.50€/$8.45). To check on or send e-mail, head to Place Net

Hôtel de Dieppe
$–$$
Rouen
Across from the train station, this reasonably priced Best Western is one
of Rouen’s best lodging options. It’s on a busy road, so request a room on
an upper floor in the rear. Some rooms are small, but all have modern
décor and are comfortable. The wonderful, attached restaurant, Les
Quatre Saisons, is the pride and joy of the Guéret family, who have been
running it and the hotel for five generations. The chef’s favorites are sole
Michel à la arête (sole prepared on the bone in the chef’s style) and cane-
ton Rouennais à la presse “Félix Faure” préparé devant le client par un
maître canardier (pressed duckling prepared tableside). For dessert, noth-
ing is finer than soufflé du Président (apple soufflé).

Hôtel de la Cathédrale
$
Rouen
The Cathédrale, an 18th-century house tucked into a narrow pedestrian
side street paved with cobblestone, really feels like old Rouen; this is defi-
nitely the most charming medium-priced hotel in town. The hotel, located
in an area that’s quiet at night, is built around a beautiful interior court-
yard filled with flowers and surrounded by half-timbered facades. (The
courtyard serves as a tearoom in good weather.) The 26 cheerful rooms,
painted in bright colors, are comfortable, although some are small.

Hôtel le Cardinal
$$
Rouen
This is a hotel for sound sleepers or those who want to admire the beau-
tiful cathedral all night: It’s on the cathedral square, and most rooms over-
look the ornate facade, which is brightly lit at night. But be aware that the
cathedral bell chimes every 15 minutes (and more jubilantly on the hour),
and the square is noisy with late-night cafes on the first floor of the hotel
building. The 18 rooms are fairly spacious, comfortable, and decorated in
a plain contemporary style. The staff can be rather brusk, and parking is
somewhat of a problem in this busy area.

Chapter 16: Normandy 301
Dining locally
Dishes you’ll find frequently on Rouen menus include duck pâté,
Normandy sole, pressed Rouen duck, Rouen sheep’s foot, local cheese,
apple tart, and apple soufflés. To drink, locals favor bottled cider and
Calvados apple brandy. One of Rouen’s best restaurants is Les Quatre
Saisons at the Hôtel de Dieppe (see the preceding section).
La Marmite
$$$
Rouen
FRENCH
This romantic fine-dining restaurant establishment is tucked into a side
street just north of the Vieux Marché (old market) square. Elegant service
and beautifully presented plates of traditional foods combine to assure a
delightful meal. The menu includes regional specialties such as foie gras 
de canard (duck foie gras), marmite de pomme (apple casserole), and

camembert rôti (roasted camembert). The wine list offers a range of afford-
able options.
See map p. 301. 3 rue Florence. % 02-35-71-75-55. Reservations recommended. Main
courses: 22€–24€ ($27–$31); prix fixe: 25€–50€ ($33–$65). AE, MC, V. Open:
Wed–Sun noon–2:30 p.m.; Tues–Sat 7:30–9:30 p.m.
Les Nymphéas
$$$$
Rouen
FRENCH
Set in an ancient half-timbered house near Vieille Marché, Les Nymphéas
is one of Rouen’s top restaurants, decorated with stylish contemporary
flair. Chef Patrice Kukurudz prefers combinations of subtle flavors. His sig-
nature dishes are foie gras chaud de canard au vinaigre de cidre (hot duck
foie gras with cider vinegar), civet de homard au Sauternes (lobster stew
with sweet white wine), and soufflé chaud aux pommes et Calvados (hot
apple soufflé with Calvados). In summer, lunch is served on a terrace.
See map p. 301. 7–9 rue de la Pie. % 02-35-89-26-69. Reservations required. Main
courses: 23€–50€ ($30–$65); prix fixe: 27€–63€ ($35–$82). AE, MC, V. Open:
Tues–Sat noon–2 p.m. and 7:30–9:30 p.m. Closed mid-Aug to mid-Sept.
Maison Dufour
$$$
Rouen
FRENCH
Occupying a restored half-timbered corner building, this softly lit restau-
rant feels snug and cozy. The décor is rustic, with stone walls, beamed ceil-
ings, hanging copper pots, and intimate rooms off the main room. The
service is exceptional under the stern eye of Madame Dufour, whose family
has run the restaurant since 1904. The food is high quality, especially at
these reasonable prices. Besides the usual Normandy favorites, the restau-
rant features moules de Bouchots à la crème (mussels in cream sauce) and
sole frit, citron et persil (sole fried with lemon and parsley). The perfect
dessert is the soufflé au Calvados.
See map p. 301. 67 bis rue St-Nicolas. % 02-35-71-90-62. Reservations required. Main
courses: 13€–20€ ($17–$26); prix fixe: 25€–38€ ($33–$49). AE, MC, V. Open:
Tues–Sun noon–2 p.m.; Tues–Sat 7:30–9:30 p.m.
Pascaline
$$
Rouen
FRENCH
This informal bistro often is filled with regulars, a tradition dating from its
opening in 1880. The décor hasn’t changed much since then. The least
expensive prix fixe menus are some of the best values in town. The best
items on the menu are seafood, such as a pavé of monkfish with a roughly
textured mustard sauce, or a savory pot-au-feu maison, navarin of monk-
fish, or a cassoulet toulousain. Don’t come for a refined cuisine — instead,
you can expect hearty and time-tested old favorites. On Thursday night,
you can catch live jazz from a swing band.

In a sleek modern dining room on the busy road beside the Seine, Gill is
Rouen’s top restaurant, enjoying two Michelin stars. Expect to pace your-
self during an elaborate multicourse meal. Delightful specialties of Chef
Gilles Tournadre are salade de queues de langoustines poëlées, chutney de

pepper chutney), dos de cabillaud rôti, pommes et onion rouge (roasted
cod with apples and red onions), pigeon à la Rouennaise avec sa raviole de

Exploring the town
The petit train (% 02-32-18-40-21) runs 40-minute tours through the
city, leaving daily April to October from in front of the tourist office (25
place de la Cathédrale), at 10 and 11 a.m., noon, 2, 3, 4, and 5 p.m. It
costs 6€ ($7.80) adults, 3.80€ ($4.95) children.
Rouen is fairly compact — it’ll take you about 20 minutes to walk from
one end of the old center to the other. Rue Jeanne-d’Arc is the main
thoroughfare, leading from the train station to the center. Not far from
the station are some of Rouen’s top museums:
Chapter 16: Normandy 303
Sampling the region’s cuisine
Traveling through Normandy, you see the sleepy-eyed cows that produce some of this
region’s renowned dairy products: cream, milk, and cheeses. Of the many special
cheeses from Normandy, Camembert is the most famous, but Livarot and Pont-
l’Evêque also are from here. When food is prepared à la normande, it usually means
the meat or seafood is cooked with cream, cider, or Calvados. Befitting Normandy’s
coastal location, menus often include Norman sole, Courseulles and Isigny oysters,
Grandcamp scallops, and Honfleur prawns and cockles. Special meats to look for are
Vallée d’Auge chicken, andouille sausage from Vire, and Isigny lamb. The region also
is known for apples, so local cider, the apple-based aperitif called pommeau, and
Calvados (an apple brandy) are venerated drinks. For dessert, an apple tart is the per-
fect ending to any meal.

 Musée des Beaux-Arts (square Verdrei; % 02-35-71-28-40; www.
rouen-musees.com) contains a fine collection of paintings, draw-
ings, and sculptures from the Middle Ages to the 20th century,
including works by Caravaggio, Velasquez, Delacroix, Géricault
(born in Rouen), Monet (Rouen Cathedral in Gray Weather), and
Helen Frankenthaler. Impressionist paintings are particularly well
represented. The museum is open Wednesday to Monday 10 a.m. to
6 p.m. Admission is 3€ ($3.90) for adults, 2€ ($2.60) for students,
and free for children younger than 18.
 The entertaining Musée le Secq des tournelles (2 rue Jacques-
Villon; % 02-35-88-42-92; www.rouen-musees.com) displays 
the greatest European collection of ironworks, including signs,
tools, and keys and locks from the 3rd to the 19th centuries. 
The collection — housed in the former Eglise St-Laurent — was
donated to the city by one collector in 1920. The museum is open
Wednesday to Monday 10 a.m. to 1 p.m. and 2 to 6 p.m. Admission
is 2.30€ ($3) for adults and 1.55€ ($2) for students. Children
younger than 16 are admitted free.
 Walking south down rue Jeanne-d’Arc from the train station, you’ll
first come to an interesting little museum that specializes in the
most famous craft of the region: faïence (painted pottery). Musée
de la céramique (1 rue de Faucon; % 02-35-07-31-74; www.rouen-
musees.com) is dedicated to Rouen faïence and ceramics from the
16th to the 18th centuries, when Rouen was a major pottery center.
The collection is housed in an elegant mansion, Hôtel d’Hocque-
ville, and is open Wednesday to Monday 10 a.m. to 1 p.m. and 2 to 6
p.m. Admission is 2.30€ ($3) for adults and 1.55€ ($2) for students.
Free for children younger than 18.
Down rue Jeanne-d’Arc and right on the main street of the pedestrian
shopping district, rue de Gros Horloge, you can admire its many half-
timbered buildings on your way to place du Vieux-Marché, the market
square surrounded by cafes and restaurants. The ancient church on the
square (Eglise St-Vincent) was destroyed during World War II bombing
and replaced in 1979 with a remarkable modern building that’s a church
(Eglise Ste-Jeanne-d’Arc), a market with food shops, and a monument to
Joan of Arc. The building’s north side features a large cross on the site of
the stake where Joan was burned to death for alleged heresy. The
church boasts many echoes of the sea, including scalelike roof tiles in
slate and copper, fish-shaped windows, and a wooden boat-shaped ceil-
ing. The 16th-century stained-glass windows from the former church
were saved and installed in the new church.
Devotees of Joan of Arc flock to the Musée Jeanne-d’Arc, located in a
cellar off the central square (33 place du Vieux-Marché; % 02-35-88-
02-70; www.jeanne-darc.com), just steps from the spot where she was
burned alive at the stake on May 30, 1431. This musty place is filled with
cheesy waxworks, but it’s hard not to be moved by Joan’s story. With a
Part V: Normandy and Brittany 
304

recorded commentary in English, the museum is open daily: May to
September 9:30 a.m. to 1 p.m. and 1:30 to 7 p.m. October to April 10 a.m.
to noon and 2 to 6:30 p.m. Admission is 4€ ($5.20) for adults, 2.50€
($3.25) for children and students.
Continue west along rue de Crosne, which turns into avenue Gustave-
Flaubert. Several more blocks (a 15-minute walk from place du Vieille-
Marché) take you to a museum devoted to author Gustave Flaubert.
Musée Flaubert et d’Histoire de la Médecine, in the Hôtel-Dieu at 51 rue
de Lecat (% 02-35-15-59-95), displays souvenirs of the Madame Bovary
author and Rouen native. In December 1821, Flaubert was born in this
hospital, where his father was the resident surgeon. The museum fea-
tures the tools of Flaubert’s father, including medical and surgical instru-
ments, documents, and hospital furnishings. Admission is 2.20€ ($2.85)
for adults and 1.50€ ($1.95) students and children. The museum is open
Tuesday to Saturday 10 a.m. to noon and 2 to 6 p.m. Closed the second
and fourth Saturdays of every month.
On the other end of rue de Gros Horloge is the famous Cathédrale
Notre-Dame (place de la Cathédrale; for information, call the tourist
office at % 02-32-08-32-40). Its complex asymmetrical facade just barely
escaped total destruction during World War II bombing. The Flamboyant
Gothic tower (with flamelike shapes) on the left is known as Tour de
Beurre and contains a carillon of 55 bells. Legend has it that the money
for the tower came from wealthy residents willing to pay for the privi-
lege of eating butter during Lent. Added in the 19th century, the Tour
Lanterne contains a spire made of cast iron and copper. It’s the tallest in
France. Impressionist Claude Monet painted the harmonious west facade
countless times in inclement weather. Inside is stained glass from the
13th to the 16th centuries and the Renaissance tombs of Cardinals
d’Amboise and Louis de Brézé. The church is open Monday to Saturday
8 a.m. to 7 p.m. and Sunday 8 a.m. to 6 p.m. Guided visits to the crypt
(built in A.D. 1000 and containing a well that’s nine centuries old) and the
14th-century Chapel of the Virgin (which has a medieval nativity paint-
ing and numerous magnificent tombs) take place June to August daily at
4 p.m. and September to May Saturday and Sunday at 2:30 p.m.
Chapter 16: Normandy 305
Why all the half-timbered houses?
Those old buildings you see with visible wood framing filled in by masonry are half-
timbered houses. Of the approximately 1,000 half-timbered houses (from the 14th to the
19th centuries) in Rouen’s center, about 200 have been restored since World War II
bombings. This style of building was popular because builders didn’t have access to
much stone, the most common building material, but they had access to plenty of oak in
surrounding forests. After the war, the city used extensive records to restore buildings,
and builders researched ancient construction methods to be as authentic as possible.

Behind the cathedral is the Flamboyant Gothic Eglise St-Maclou (% 02-
35-71-28-09). The unusually elaborate entrance, with five porches con-
taining five doors, is covered with Renaissance carvings. The church
was badly damaged by a World War II bomb; photos inside detail the
destruction. It’s open Monday to Saturday noon to 6 p.m. and Sundays 3
to 5 p.m. (closed Jan 1, May 1, July 14, and Nov 11). East of the cathe-
dral, Abbatiale St-Ouen (once part of a major Benedictine Abbey) was
built from the 14th to the 16th centuries and is one of France’s most
beautiful churches. It’s notable for its unity of the Flamboyant Gothic
style, a refined architecture that incorporates lots of light. Inside are
18th-century wrought-iron choir gates and a superb 1630 organ with
more than 3,000 pipes (renovated in the 19th century). St-Ouen is where
Joan of Arc was sentenced to life imprisonment, though that sentence
was later altered to death. Mid-March to October, the church is open
Tuesday to Saturday 9 a.m. to 12:15 p.m. and 2 to 6 p.m.; November to
mid-December and late January to mid-March, hours are Tuesday,
Saturday, and Sunday 10 a.m. to noon and 2 to 6 p.m. For more informa-
tion on the Abbatiale St-Ouen, call the tourist office at % 02-32-08-32-40.
Mont-St-Michel (see “Mont-St-Michel: Medieval Marvel,” later in this
chapter) isn’t the only famous abbey in these parts, but the others draw
far fewer visitors. Route des Abbayes, a 140km (87-mile) driving route
that roughly follows the Seine, passes half a dozen abbeys. The two
most interesting are less than 65km (40 miles) from Rouen. Leave Rouen
west on D982 and then south on D65 to reach the first abbey.
 Many say France’s most beautiful ruin is Abbaye de Jumièges
(% 02-35-37-24-02), 11th-century remains surrounded by ancient
yew trees. The Romanesque nave and two pillars, along with 16th-
century chapels and stained glass, are all that’s left from the Eglise
St-Valentin. The abbey is open daily (except Jan 1, May 1, Nov 1,
Nov 11, and Dec 25): late April to mid-September 9:30 a.m. to 6:30
p.m. and late September to mid-April 9:30 a.m. to 1 p.m. and 2:30 to
5:30 p.m. (last ticket sales are half an hour before closing). Admis-
sion is 5€ ($6.50) for adults and 3.50€ ($4.55) for anyone 18 to 25.
 Another 16km (10 miles) down D982 is the Abbaye St-Wandrille de
Fontenelle (% 02-35-96-23-11), built in the 13th and 14th centuries.
The Gothic cloisters from the 14th to the 16th centuries are the
highlights. Guided tours are given October to April on Saturdays at
3:30 p.m. and Sundays and holidays at 11:30 a.m. and 3:30 p.m., and
April to October Wednesday to Monday. Gregorian chant services
take place on Sundays at 10 a.m. and weekdays at 9:45 a.m.
Admission is 3.50€ ($4.55).
Shopping for local treasures
A food and produce market is open at place St-Marc on Tuesday, Friday,
and Saturday 8 a.m. to 6:30 p.m. On Sundays 8 a.m. to 1:30 p.m., place St-
Marc becomes a flea market. At place du Vieux-Marché, you find a food
Part V: Normandy and Brittany 
306

market Tuesday to Sunday 8 a.m. to 1:30 p.m. Place des Emmurées plays
host to a food market on Tuesdays and Saturdays and a flea market on
Thursdays 8 a.m. to 6:30 p.m.
Rouen has long been famous for its faïence (painted pottery); many of its
shops and antiques stores sell fine pieces. Be aware that antique faïence
is expensive, but contemporary versions are affordable and abundant.
For antiques, check out rue St-Romain, rue Damiette, and rue Eau-de-
Robec, an area that plays host to an antiques fair on the first Saturday of
every month. Michel Carpentier (26 rue St-Romain; % 02-35-88-77-47)
sells high-quality contemporary faïence made in his shop.
Living it up after dark
Most of Rouen’s nightlife is centered on place du Vieux-Marché. Le
Scottish (26 Bis quai Gaston Boulet; % 02-35-71-58-37) has live jazz and
no cover. A popular beer pub is La Taverne St-Amand (11 rue St-Amand;
% 02-35-88-51-34). You can find highbrow entertainment at Théâtre des
Arts (7 rue du Docter Rambert; % 02-35-98-50-98), with classical music
concerts, opera, and ballet. For plays, check out the Théâtre des Deux
Rives (48 rue Louis-Ricard; % 02-35-70-22-82).
The brochure Cette Semaine à Rouen, available free from the tourist
office, lists all current events.
Bayeux and the Famous Tapestry
The town of Bayeux is famous for displaying the tapestry that tells how
the French conquered England in 1066. With a story line like that, you
know this display is set to impress — and indeed it does. But Bayeux is
also a pleasant place to stay, with a number of fine hotels and restau-
rants and handsome cobblestone streets for strolling. At fewer than
20km (12 miles) from D-day beaches, the town is a good base for tours.
The first weekend in July is Fêtes Médiévales, a lively two-day affair 
with costumed entertainers, parades, large markets, and late-night par-
tying. The streets in the center of town are blocked off to cars during 
the festival.
Getting there
Trains traveling from Paris’s Gare St-Lazare to Bayeux take two-and-a-
half hours and cost 31€ ($40). Six to twelve trains make the journey
each day, and most stop in Caen, where you may have to change trains.
Twelve trains per day travel from Caen to Bayeux, with the trip taking 20
minutes and costing 5.20€ ($6.75). The Bayeux train station, at place de
la Gare, is about a 15-minute walk from the center of town. For train
reservations and information, call SNCF at % 08-92-35-35-35 or 3635
within France.
Chapter 16: Normandy 307

To drive from Paris to Bayeux, take A13 to Caen and E46 west to Bayeux.
It’s about a three-hour trip.

Exploring other Normandy favorites
If you have some additional time, check out these interesting spots.
 Caen: This mostly modern city, 103km (64 miles) from Rouen, serves as a conven-
ient transportation hub and is the capital of Lower Normandy. The bustling city is
about a 15-minute drive from the D-day beaches. The World War II Mémorial de
Caen, at esplanade Dwight-Eisenhower, is the region’s most impressive. The city
also has a pair of noteworthy medieval abbeys: Abbaye aux Dames on place de
la Reine-Mathilde and Abbaye aux Hommes on esplanade Jean-Marie-Louvel.
 Deauville: A stylish seaside resort since the mid-19th century, Deauville, 71km (44

 Etretat: This seaside village, 87km (54 miles) from Rouen, is the site of the unusual
cliffs that Monet painted many times. The wide pebbly beach is accessed via a
long concrete boardwalk. You can walk along the grassy tops of the cliffs and
explore the tiny 19th-century Chapelle Notre-Dame de la Garde on top of the cliff
on the east side of the beach. Etretat is an idyllic place to eat crepes or moules
frites (mussels and french fries) at one of its beach cafes.
 Honfleur: This fishing village at the mouth of the Seine, 66km (41 miles) from Rouen,
is completely charming. Sit at a cafe by the harbor, take a spin on the carousel,

art galleries on the streets near the port.
 Pont de Normandie: Drive across the spectacular cable bridge Pont de Normandie
(5€/$6.50), which connects Le Havre to Honfleur across the Seine estuary. The
bridge, completed in 1995, is 856m (2,807-ft.) long.

Bayeux
The Churchill, in a handsome 19th-century stone building, claims an ideal
location on the main street, a cobblestone pedestrian way lined with shops
and restaurants. The property is well run and recently has undergone
extensive renovations. The 32 rooms offer a cheerful décor along with some

one of the handsome suites. The hotel is in a fine location, facing central
place St-Patrice. Rooms in the back are quiet and look out on pretty gar-
dens, but units in the front, though set back from the street by a court-
yard, can be noisy. The staff is English-speaking and helpful, and the
continental breakfast is particularly good.

The unusual aspect (for France) of this quaint restaurant is that the entire

visitors, who can order from an English menu. Depending on availability,
the restaurant has local meats and fresh fish, such as Honfleur prawns and
salt meadow Isigny lamb. The wine list offers many reasonably priced

FRENCH
One of the most appealing restaurants in Bayeux’s historic zone occupies
an antique building whose three dining rooms contain ceiling beams, stone
ceiling vaults, and exposed masonry. The venue is devotedly Norman, with
cuisine that reflects the region’s long tradition of baking with apples (the
restaurant’s name translates as “the apple tree”) and limited amounts of
cream. Sauces are served on the side, and the health-conscious staff is
proud of the way their dishes “aren’t drowned in gravies and sauces.”
Menu items evolve with the seasons and the availability of ingredients, but
you usually can usually expect dishes such as foie gras of duckling pre-
pared house-style, rabbit stew braised in cider, and a platter that contains
two kinds of fish served with chitterling sausage with a sauce made from
cream and drippings from the chitterlings.

Exploring the town
Bayeux is compact and easy to walk. The main road through the center
is the pedestrian rue St-Jean. The tapestry and several smaller museums
are south of rue St-Jean, as is the 11th-century Cathédrale Notre-Dame
(rue du Bienvenu; % 02-31-92-01-85). The cathedral was consecrated in
1077 but partially destroyed in 1105. Romanesque towers from the origi-
nal church rise on the western side. The central tower is from the 15th
century, and the nave is a fine example of Norman Romanesque style.
Rich in sculpture, the 13th-century choir, a perfect example of Norman
Gothic style, has Renaissance stalls. The crypt was built in the 11th cen-
tury and then sealed, its existence unknown until 1412. Admission is
free; the cathedral is open daily from 8:30 a.m. to 6 p.m. (until 7 p.m.
July–Aug).
The 11th-century Tapisserie de Bayeux is displayed in the Centre
Guillaume le Conquérant (rue de Nesmond; % 02-31-51-25-50). The 
58 panels of the Bayeux Tapestry (actually an embroidery in wool on a
background of linen), measuring 70m (230 ft.) long and 50cm (20 in.)
high, tell the story of the Norman Conquest — when William the Con-
queror invaded England, resulting in the Battle of Hastings on October
14, 1066 — and William’s being crowned king of England. Born Billy the
Bastard, William rose from ignoble beginnings to rule England, along
with Normandy, until his death in 1087. The story involves the hapless
Prince Harold, a Saxon earl, who tried to crown himself king of England
against the wishes of the previous ruler, Edward the Confessor, who had
promised the throne to William. It’s believed that the tapestry was com-
missioned in 1077 by William’s half-brother Odon, the bishop of Bayeux,
for display in his cathedral.
The tapestry’s survival is a story in itself. The first historical mention of
the tapestry was in 1476, when it was said that the canons of the Bayeux
Cathedral would unroll it every year for display. The tapestry may have
been stolen during the French Revolution in 1789. In 1792, a local man
was using it as a tarp to hold down the belongings in his cart. A lawyer,
sensing the value of the piece, traded some rope for the tapestry, saving
it from certain destruction. Thankfully, the tapestry eventually ended up
back in the hands of town authorities.
After viewing much preliminary material to the tapestry (including a full
copy with play-by-play translation, interpretation, and analysis), you’ll
get to see the real thing, behind thick glass in a dark tunnel-like room.
Everything has English translations — an audioguide is available in
English, and a 14-minute film is shown in English and French. Admission
is 7.60€ ($9.90) for adults and 3€ ($3.90) for children and students.
Open daily 9 a.m. to 6:30 p.m.
Southwest of the cathedral, at the Musée Mémorial de la Bataille de
Normandie 1944 (boulevard Fabian-Ware; % 02-31-51-46-92), Bayeux
commemorates its role as the first French town liberated from the Nazis.
The startlingly modern building looks like a UFO bunker and uses soldier
Chapter 16: Normandy 311

waxworks, weapons, military equipment, and memorabilia to outline 
all aspects of Operation Overlord (the code name for the invasion of
Europe) and the Battle of Normandy, the decisive military operation of
World War II. Admission is 5.50€ ($7.15) for adults and 3€ ($3.90) for
children and students. The museum is open daily May to mid-September
9:30 a.m. to 6:30 p.m., and late September to April 10 a.m. to noon and 2
to 6 p.m.
The D-Day Beaches
Some of World War II’s most dramatic events took place on the coast 
of Normandy. On June 6, 1944, code-named D-day, the Allied troops
invaded Normandy and put in motion the liberation of the European
continent from the Nazis. More than 100,000 soldiers were killed in the
ensuing battles. Today not many reminders are left on the beaches of
these dramatic events besides some German bunkers. However, small
museums and memorials are placed all along the coast, explaining in
detail each critical event and battle.
Off the coast of Arromanches, you can see the remains of an artificial
harbor that was constructed by the allies and code-named Mulberry
Harbor. And, of course, the cemeteries with their acres of white crosses
remind us of the heavy cost of freedom. The Battle of Normandy contin-
ued until August 21. Soon Paris was liberated, and a year later, when
Allied troops entered Berlin, Germany surrendered.
Getting there
If you’re driving from Paris to the D-day beaches, take A13 to Caen and
E46 to Bayeux and then go north on D6 to the coastal road D514; the trip
takes about three hours. Following coastal D514 takes you past the rele-
vant D-day sites. You can also drive Voie de la Liberté, which follows
the path of General Eisenhower and his troops as they liberated one vil-
lage after another, from Utah Beach all the way to Belgium.
Bus Verts du Calvados (% 08-10-21-42-14) runs buses that travel to
many of the villages along the coast. Carte Liberté, a day pass allowing
unlimited travel on the buses, costs 18€ ($23). From July to September
1, bus no. 75 runs a tour that leaves from Caen’s Gare Routière (bus sta-
tion) at 9:30 a.m. and travels to Arromanches (the Musée du Debarque-
ment, artificial harbor, and 360-degree film), Omaha Beach (the American
Cemetery), and Pointe du Hoc (the place of the daring feat by Lt. Col.
James Rudder’s American Rangers, who took this German strongpoint
on June 6), returning to Caen at 6 p.m.
Getting around and getting information
To rent a car, head to Lefebvre Car Rental (boulevard d’Eindhoven,
Bayeux; % 02-31-92-05-96). To hire a bike, go to Le Verger de l’Aure 
(5, rue Larcher, Bayeux; % 02-31-92-89-16); rental rate is 10€ ($13) for a
Part V: Normandy and Brittany 
312

half day and 15€ ($20) for a full day. Although distances are short, bikers
need to be aware that travel along the D-day beaches coastal route is a
hilly and windy trek.
If you don’t have access to a car, the best way to see the D-day beaches
is by tour. Normandy Tours, at the Hôtel de la Gare in Bayeux (% 02-31-
92-10-70), runs tours (in English) to Arromanches, Omaha Beach, the
American Military Cemetery, and Pointe du Hoc for 34€ to 39€ ($44–
$51) per person. D-Day Tours, 52 Route de Port (% 02-31-51-70-52),
picks you up at your Bayeux hotel for English-speaking tours of the 
D-day beaches. A half-day trip costs 45€ ($59) for adults and 40€ ($52)
for students and a full-day trip goes for 75€ ($98) for adults, 65€ ($85)
for students.
The tourist offices in Bayeux and Caen have information about visiting
the beaches. The Caen tourist office is on place St-Pierre (% 02-31-27-
14-14). July and August, the office is open Monday to Saturday 9:30 a.m.
to 7 p.m. and Sunday 10 a.m. to 1 p.m. and 2 to 5 p.m., and September to
June its hours are Monday to Saturday 9:30 a.m. to 1 p.m. and 2 to 6 p.m.
and Sunday 10 a.m. to 1 p.m. The Bayeux tourist office is on Pont St-
Jean (% 02-31-51-28-28; Fax: 02-31-51-28-29; www.bayeux-tourism.com).
You can pick up a brochure called The D-Day Landings and the Battle
of Normandy at all local tourist offices.
Exploring the beaches
The beaches’ code names, from west to east, are Utah and Omaha
(where the Americans landed), Juno (where the Canadians landed), and
Gold and Sword (where the British landed). Ste-Mère-Eglise, the first vil-
lage liberated, has installed on the roof of the church a model of a U.S.
paratrooper who became entangled in the steeple. The village’s museum,
which honors the paratroopers, is the Musée des Troopes Aéroportées
(14 rue Eisenhower; % 02-33-41-41-35). It’s open daily April 1 to Septem-
ber 30 9 a.m. to 6:45 p.m. and October to March 9:30 a.m. to noon and 2
to 6 p.m. (closed Dec and Jan). Admission is 6€ ($7.80) for adults and 3€
($3.90) for students. The American Cemetery (% 02-31-51-62-00), with
9,000 headstones (white crosses and stars of David), is located near
Omaha Beach at Colleville-sur-Mer. The cemetery is open daily year-
round from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m.
The most impressive contemporary D-day museum/monument is the
Mémorial pour la Paix, at esplanade Eisenhower in Caen (% 02-31-06-
06-44; www.memorial-caen.fr). This comprehensive museum explains
the major battles and explores themes, such as German Fascism, the
French Resistance, and French collaboration. The museum is open
February to September Tuesday to Sunday 9 a.m. to 7 p.m.; October to
December Tuesday to Sunday 9:30 a.m. to 6 p.m. Last entrance is an
hour before closing. Admission is 18€ ($23) for adults, 16€ ($21) for
children. June to September, the museum runs tours (in English) of the
beaches. A tour to the beaches leaves daily at 9 a.m. and again at 2 p.m.,
costing 68€ ($88) per person.

Mont-St-Michel: Medieval Marvel
One of France’s most popular attractions, the medieval abbey of Mont-
St-Michel rises 79m (260 ft.) from the primordial quicksands of the bay,
just off the coast of Normandy. A causeway allows the steady stream of
visitors to walk to the village, which doesn’t allow cars. A steep road
leads past souvenir shops and restaurants to the abbey, with its flower-
filled cloister and soaring chapel perched close to heaven at the top of
the rock. Despite all the visitors and hype, this site is awe-inspiring.
Mont-St-Michel is also famous for having the highest tides of continental
Europe. The tides can rise as high as 15m (50 ft.) in a few hours; at its
fastest, it’s said to be the speed of a galloping horse.
Getting there
From Paris’s Gare Montparnasse, fast TGVs run frequently to Rennes in
Brittany (two hours; 50–64€/$65–$83). For reservations and information,
call SNCF at % 08-92-35-35-35 or 3635 within France. You can then take
a bus (75 minutes) to Mont-St-Michel. For bus information, call Les
Courriers Bretons at % 02-99-19-70-80. The nearest train station (slow
trains only) is at Pontorson, 9km (51⁄2 miles) from Mont-St-Michel; a con-
necting bus (2€/$2.60) makes the ten-minute trip to the abbey.
Driving is the most convenient way to get to Mont-St-Michel. From Paris,
take A13 to Caen and then N175 southwest to Pontorson and D976 to
Mont-St-Michel (four-and-a-half hours). From Rouen, drive to Caen on
A13 and follow directions from Paris. From Bayeux and the D-day
Part V: Normandy and Brittany 
314

beaches, head briefly southeast to Caen on E46 and then southwest to
Mont-St-Michel. Try to park (4€/$5.20) as close as possible to the abbey,
because you have a long walk ahead of you. Be aware that the spaces
just below the abbey entrance are covered by water at high tide.
Announcements warn motorists to move their cars in time.
Crowds gather in the North Tower of the abbey after the last tour of the
day to watch the tide creep and then rush in. The fastest tides take place
during the equinoxes in March and September.
Seeing 75 tour buses parked in the lots at Mont-St-Michel isn’t unusual.
To avoid the crowds, arrive late in the day. Visitors staying overnight on
the Mont are allowed to park in the best spots, closest to the entrance,
and they have the additional luxury of visiting the abbey after all the
others have left. In summer, the last regular tour of the abbey is at 5 p.m.,
and nighttime visits start at 6 p.m. Avoid Mont-St-Michel in August, when
crowds are at their worst.
Getting information
The Mont-St-Michel tourist office is on the left as you enter the fortified
gate of the Mont (% 02-33-60-14-30; Fax: 02-33-60-06-75; www.ot-mont
saintmichel.com). From late June to mid-September, the office is open
daily 9 a.m. to 6 p.m.; late September to mid-June, hours are daily 9 a.m.
to noon and 2 to 6 p.m. Check with the office for the times of English-
language tours of the abbey. Next to the Mont-St-Michel tourist office 
are public toilets and a fountain where lines of hearty pilgrims washing
thick gray mud off of their legs can be seen.

fast at the hotel’s restaurant, a little farther up Grande Rue. Alas, tables

Is La Mère Poulard a tourist trap best avoided or a restaurant serving the

the most expensive and most famous on Mont-St-Michel, located in the
busiest square, right at the entrance into town. The omelets, made in long-
handled copper skillets and served by women in Norman costume, are
indeed fluffy and delectable. The menu also features agneau du pré salé

you enter the island of Mont-St-Michel (see the “Mont-St-Michel” map)
through the Porte Bavole, built in 1590, and follow Grande Rue, a steep
and narrow pedestrian street up to the abbey. As you pass through the
gate, on your left is the Corps de Guard des Bourgeois, a 15th-
century building that now houses the tourist office.
A seemingly endless series of steep stone steps lead up to Mont-St-
Michel, so you need to be well rested and in good shape to make the
trek. This attraction is definitely not for travelers with disabilities.
If you think Mont-St-Michel is crowded now, you should’ve seen it in
5000 B.C., when the dramatic pointed rock just off the coast was a pagan
place of worship. The site was first consecrated in A.D. 708 and dedi-
cated to the archangel Michael, who’s considered the protector of faith
and the one who weighs the souls. His job of weighing the souls made
Michael one influential archangel, explaining why pilgrims risked their

lives walking through the patches of quicksand in the bay, braving the
deadly tides, through thick fog and heavy rains, to visit the abbey.
Building and rebuilding the abbey (after several collapses) took about
500 years, so the site combines architectural styles from the Middle
Ages to the 16th century. Construction began in the 8th century, when
Aubert, a bishop of Avranches, claimed the archangel told him to build a
monastery here. In 966, Richard, duc de Normandy, agreed to construct
a Benedictine monastery over a set of crypts built at the peak of the
rock, but it partially burned down in 1203. Later that century, Philippe
Auguste of France made a donation that enabled the work to begin on
the abbey’s Gothic section, the part of the complex known to countless
pilgrims as La Merveille. The two three-story buildings, crowned by the
cloister and the refectory, are a marvel. In the 14th century, during the
Hundred Years’ War, fortifications were built to protect the abbey during
a 30-year siege. The fortifications came in handy during World War II,
when the Mont was the only part of France that didn’t to fall to the
Germans. In the 15th century, a Flamboyant Gothic chancel was built for
the abbey church. The abbey was used as a prison during the French
Revolution and was finally turned over to France’s Historic Monuments
department in 1874. The steeple, spire, and bronze statue of the
archangel were added in 1897. On the abbey’s 1,000th anniversary in
1966, a monastic community moved back into it; a Benedictine Mass is
celebrated daily at 12:15 p.m.
Among the highlights of the site is the 13th-century cloister, with its deli-
cate zigzagging granite columns. The center courtyard has been planted
with a medieval herb garden. Also interesting is the 13th-century réfrec-
toire, a large dining room with Romanesque and Gothic elements, where
30 monks would eat daily in silence. While exploring the abbey, you can
occasionally get a glimpse of the actual rock, which is green with
lichens. Don’t miss the huge 19th-century treadmill that was manned by
six prisoners and used to bring supplies up to the site. Admission to the
abbey is 8€ ($10) for adults and 5€ ($6.50) for ages 18 to 25. It’s open
daily (except Jan 1, May 1, and Dec 25): May to August 9 a.m. to 7 p.m.
and September to April 9:30 a.m. to 6 p.m. Most days in summer, hour-
long tours are given (in English) at 10:30 and 11:30 a.m. and 2, 3, and 
4 p.m. The tour is included with the price of admission.
Musée Maritime (Grande Rue; % 02-33-60-85-12) bills itself as a Science
and Environment Center and actually contains some interesting informa-
tion about Mont-St-Michel Bay and the work being undertaken to pre-
vent it from silting up. A major engineering project is set to tear down
the causeway and turn Mont-St-Michel back into an island, reachable by
bridge. The museum is the best of the ancillary attractions on the Mont.
Admission is 9€ ($12) for adults and 4.50€ ($5.85) for children ages 10
to 18. July to August, it’s open daily 8:30 a.m. to 7:30 p.m.; September to
Part V: Normandy and Brittany 
318

June, hours are Tuesday to Sunday 9 a.m. to 6:30 p.m. You can skip 
the waxworks museum and the 15-minute French film hosted by the
archangel.
Mont-St-Michel is a sore subject in Brittany, and you’re better off not
bringing it up if you plan on visiting that region (see Chapter 17).
Ancient Bretons coined the verse, “The River in its folly gave the Mont to
Normandy,” referring to the fact that the Selune River changed beds in
A.D. 933, making Mont-St-Michel fall within the boundary of Normandy
instead of Brittany. Bretons still are peeved about it.

T
he rugged coast of Brittany is lined with seaside resorts and
windswept cliffs overlooking the Atlantic. Brittany is a proud region
with its own culture and traditions. More than 200,000 people speak the
Breton language, which is more similar to Welsh than to French. Thanks
to hearty Breton fishermen, you find excellent seafood in the region, par-
ticularly Belon oysters, which are world famous. Brittany also is home to
hand-painted Quimper pottery, which features bright colors and simple
patterns and is made in the small town of Quimper, near Brittany’s west
coast. Brittany’s earliest residents were Neolithic tribes who left their
megaliths behind. You can see these ancient stone formations in Carnac.
The Celts first arrived in the 6th century B.C., and Brittany’s separate
identity evolved from those tribes from the British Isles. The region
didn’t become part of France until 1532 — it has been fiercely guarding
its independence ever since.
Bretons love it when you acknowledge their language, which is closer to
Welsh than it is to French. Here are three common words.
 Hello: brav an amzer (brahv-ahn-ahmzer)
 Goodbye: kenavo (cay-nah-voh)
 Thank you: trugarez (true-gahr-ez)
Nantes: Brittany’s Ancient Capital
With a half million residents, Nantes, the former capital of Brittany, is a
handsome and bustling town at the intersection of three rivers: the
Loire, the Erdre, and the Sèvre. Though officially part of the Loire region,
Nantes has always been historically linked to Brittany. The town gained
a place in history books with the 1598 Edict of Nantes, in which Henri IV
granted religious freedom to France’s Protestant minority (however,

Chapter 17: Brittany 321
Louis XIV revoked the edict in 1685). The huge château where the edict
was signed (Château des Ducs de Bretagne) still occupies a central
place in the city. Nantes today is a lively college town with about 30,000
students, offering plenty to see and do, including excellent shopping and
hopping nightlife, and it’s a fine first stop on the way to exploring the
region.
Getting there
The TGV (fast train) from Paris’s Gare Montparnasse takes about two-
and-a-quarter hours to get to Nantes and costs 53€ ($69). Beware of

slow trains that can take up to five-and-a-half hours. For information, call
% 08-92-35-35-35 or 3635 within France. Nantes’s Gare SNCF (train sta-
tion) is at 27 bd. de Stalingrad, a five-minute walk from the town center.
Trains from Nantes to Quimper (only two or three per day) take two-and-
three-quarter to four hours (depending on how many stops the train
makes) and cost 30€ ($39). See “Quimper and Its Hand-Painted Pottery,”
later in this chapter.
If you’re driving, take A11 for 385km (239 miles) west of Paris. The trip
takes about four hours.
Aéroport Nantes-Atlantique is 12km (7.5 miles) southeast of town 
(% 02-40-84-80-00), and Air France (% 02-92-44-21-00) offers daily
flights from Paris. A shuttle bus between the airport and the Nantes 
train station takes 25 minutes and costs 6€ ($7.80). If you take a taxi
from the airport, it costs from 20€ to 25€ ($26–$33), and the ride lasts
about 15 minutes.
Getting around and getting information
Nantes has an extensive bus system, in addition to a bus and tram
system, but all the major sights, restaurants, and hotels are within walk-
ing distance of the center of town. The tourist office offers public trans-
portation maps and schedules.
If you want to rent a car, note that Budget, Hertz, and Europcar have
offices inside the train station. You can also find a taxi stand at the sta-
tion. Call Allô Taxi at % 02-40-69-22-22 to order a cab.
The tourist office, 3 Cour Olivier de Clisson (% 08-92-46-40-44; Fax: 02-
40-89-11-99; www.nantes-tourisme.com), is open daily 10 a.m. to 6 p.m.
The office changes money on days when banks are closed and organizes
walking tours of the city (7€/$9.10) for adults and 4€/$5.20) for students
and children). An annex at the château is open Tuesday to Sunday 10 a.m.
to 1 p.m. and 2 to 6 p.m. You can check your e-mail at either Cyber Kebab,
rue de Verdun (% 02-40-47-09-21), open daily 9:30 a.m. to 2 a.m., or Cyber
City, rue de Strasbourg Z (% 02-40-89-57-92), open daily 10 a.m. to 1 a.m.
Both places charge 3€ ($3.90) for the use of their equipment.

At this gorgeous 1895 Art Nouveau brasserie, the dining rooms boast
elaborately painted, towering ceilings, multicolored tile arches, stained
glass, and huge gilt-framed mirrors. Try to get one of the booths, and settle
in for a fun evening. This is a great place for sampling Brittany’s famous 
oysters — you can get a platter with six different kinds. Chef Gilles Renault
changes the menu daily, but he always offers good-tasting seasonal soups,
such as the soupe crémeuse de potiron aux coques (creamy pumpkin soup
with cockles) in fall. One of the classic brasserie dishes is the magret de
canard rôti au miel, pommes sautées persillées (roasted duck with honey
and sautéed apples). The star among the homemade desserts is the Black
Forest cake.

Sampling the region’s cuisine
Besides oysters, lobsters, scallops, and other fresh fish, Bretons love to eat gallettes,
buckwheat pancakes rolled around vegetables, cheese, meat, or fish. The galette
complète contains ham, cheese, and egg. The perfect drink to accompany galettes is
local cider. Cornouaille cider from the Cornouaille region in Brittany is the highest qual-
ity. A bolées is a traditional large mug of cider. Breton beer also is a popular beverage
in the region. The best-known brands are Coreff from Morlaix, Lancelot barley beer,
and Telenn Du buckwheat beer. The most basic ingredient in Breton cooking is salted
butter. Breton cows graze on the lush fields and marshes near the Atlantic Ocean,
which gives the butter an innate saltiness. For dessert, try the far Breton, a prune tart
with the consistency of a sturdy custard. You can find the famous Brittany butter cookies
with the brand name Traou Mad in stores throughout the region.

rôti aux rattes et coques du croisic (thick slices of turbot fish roasted with
potatoes and cockles). The best dessert is the petit banane rôti leger
(lightly roasted banana). The wine list is exemplary.
See map p. 323. 16 quai Ernest-Renaud. % 02-40-73-23-23. www.restaurant-
atlantide.net. Reservations required. Main courses: 24€–37€ ($31–$48); prix
fixe: 28€–110€ ($37–$114). AE, MC, V. Open: Mon–Fri noon–2:30 p.m.; Mon–Sat 8–10
p.m. Closed the first 4 weeks of Aug and Dec 24–Jan 2.
Exploring the city
The Nantes Decouvertes, good for one day (14€/$18), two days (24€/
$31), or three (30€/$39), gives you admission to all the major museums
and free access to all the bus and tram lines. The pass is available at the
tourist office on place du Commerce. For info, call % 08-92-46-40-44.
Occupying the symbolic center of the city is the Château des Ducs de
Bretagne (4 place Marc-Elder; % 02-51-17-49-00), where the Edict of
Nantes was signed in 1598. François II, duc de Bretagne, built the
château in 1466, and his daughter, Anne de Bretagne, was born here in
1477. Protected by a moat and thick fortified walls, the château is an
imposing edifice. Through the years, it has served as a prison, and its
most famous prisoner was Gilles de Retz, known more infamously as
Bluebeard, the 15th-century mass murderer. You’re free to walk around
or picnic on the grounds, and usually a temporary exhibit is on display
at the museum inside the walls. The museum is open daily 10 a.m. to
noon and 2 to 6 p.m.; admission is free.
Just north of the castle, past a large public park, is the grand 15th-
century Flamboyant Gothic Cathédrale St-Pierre (place St-Pierre; 
% 02-40-47-84-64). Inside is the ornate Renaissance tomb of François II,
duc de Bretagne, who ruled from 1458 to 1488. From the cathedral
square, you can stroll down Nantes’s best shopping streets to the com-
mercial center. Take rue de Verdun to rue de la Marne to rue d’Orléans
to place Royale. Continue on rue Crébillon to place Graslin, with its
magnificent Grand Théâtre. Along the way, walk through the beautiful
19th-century shopping arcade passage Pommeraye. Heading toward the
Loire River brings you to place du Commerce, with its lively cafe scene.
One block east of the cathedral in a belle-époque building, the impressive
Musée des Beaux-Arts (10 rue Georges-Clemenceau; % 02-51-17-45-00)
contains sculptures and paintings from the 12th through 19th centuries
Among the highlights are Nymphéas by Monet, Madame de Senonnes by
Ingres, and Le Joueur de Vielle by Georges de la Tour. The most bizarre
work is an 1887 statue of a gorilla carrying off a damsel. The museum is
open Wednesday to Monday 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. Admission is 3.10€ ($4.05)
for adults and 1.60€ ($2.10) for students and children; entrance to the
museum is free on Sunday.
If you walk 2 blocks east, you can visit one of France’s most beautiful
botanical gardens, Jardin des Plantes (% 02-40-41-90-09). The northern
Chapter 17: Brittany 325

entrance to the park is close to the Musée des Beaux-Arts, and the
southern border is across from the train station. Admission is free, and
it’s open daily April to October 8 a.m. to 8 p.m.; November 9 a.m. to 6:30
p.m.; December to March 8 a.m. to 5:30 p.m.
On the west end of town, 2 blocks from place Graslin, is the Musée
Thomas-Dobrée (18 rue Voltaire; % 02-40-71-03-50), housed in a 15th-
century palace. The museum displays a collection of Roman antiquities,
medieval paintings, and Renaissance décor. It’s open Tuesday to Sunday
1:30 to 5:30 p.m., with an admission of 3€ ($3.90) for adults and 1.50€
($1.95) for students and children. Walking south to the Loire River and
another half-mile west takes you to the Musée Jules-Verne (3 rue de
l’Hermitage; % 02-40-69-72-52), with documents relating to the life of
the 19th-century author, born in Nantes, who wrote 20,000 Leagues
Under the Sea and other classics. The museum is open Wednesday to
Monday 10 a.m. to noon and 2 to 6 p.m. Admission is 3€ ($3.90) for
adults, 1.50€ ($1.95) students ages 18 to 26, and free for ages 17 and
younger.
Shopping for local treasures
One of France’s most beautiful shopping plazas is the enclosed early
1900s trilevel passage Pommeraye at rue Crébillon and place Royale,
decorated with statuary, gilded columns, gas lamps, and elaborate mold-
ings. The Pommeraye is open Monday to Saturday 8 a.m. to 8 p.m. and
Sunday 9 a.m. to 7 p.m. Nearby are the wide pedestrian shopping streets:
rue de la Marne, rue d’Orléans, and rue Crébillon. The market is held
at the Marché de Talensac and at place du Bouffay, Tuesdays to
Saturdays 8 a.m. to 1 p.m.
Living it up after dark
You find many bars on place du Bouffay and on the ancient streets near
the château, including Buck Mulligan’s (12 rue de Château; % 02-40-20-
02-72). A great piano bar with a dance floor and occasional jazz concerts
is Le Tie Break, 1 rue des Peties-Ecuries (% 02-40-47-77-00). The disco
scene reigns at L’Evasion (3 rue de l’Emery; % 02-40-47-99-84). Check
out what’s happening in the free brochure, Le Mois Nantais, from the
tourist office.
Quimper and Its Hand-Painted Pottery
Set in a valley where the Odet and Steir rivers meet, the traditional town
of Quimper (pronounced cam-pair) is the capital of the Cornouaille area
of Brittany. Quimper’s claim to fame is its brightly colored hand-painted
pottery, which has been made here since the 17th century. Quimper is
also the oldest Breton city — it was settled between A.D. 400 and 700.
The medieval section of town, west of the cathedral, is a maze of cobble-
stone pedestrian streets lined with pricey boutiques.
Part V: Normandy and Brittany 
326

Quimper is a fairly quiet town. A lively time to visit is during the week-
long Festival de Cornouaille in late July. Book your hotel well in advance,
because the festival is one of Brittany’s largest events, celebrating
music, dance, and storytelling. For details, call the tourist office at 
% 02-98-53-04-05.
Getting there
TGVs from Paris’s Gare Montparnasse make the trip to Quimper in four-
and-a-half hours and cost 80€ to 90€ ($104–$117). Four trains per day
travel from Nantes, taking two-and-three-quarter to four hours (depend-
ing on how many stops the train makes) and cost 30€ ($39). For train
information call % 08-92-35-35-35 or 3635 from within France. Quimper’s
Gare SNCF (train station) is on avenue de la Gare, 1km (a half mile) east
of the town center.
Quimper is 570km (354.2 miles) from Paris, and the drive takes five to
six hours. If you’re driving, follow A11 to A81 west to Rennes. From
Rennes, take E50 west to Montauban and continue west on N164 to
Châteaulin and then south on N165 to Quimper. Driving from Rennes to
Quimper takes two to three hours.
Getting around and getting information
To rent a car, try the Hertz branch across from the train station 
(19 av. de la Gare; % 02-98-53-12-34). Nearby is Europcar (16 av. de la
Libération; % 02-98-90-00-68). An Avis office is inside the train station

Monday to Saturday 9 a.m. to 12:30 p.m. and 1:30 to 6 p.m.
Spending the night
A fancy option about 13km (8 miles) north of Quimper is the Manoir 
du Stang in La Forêt-Fouesnant, off N783 (% 02-98-56-97-37). May to
September, this 16th-century manor rents 24 rooms, decorated with
antiques, for 99€ to 140€ ($129–$182) double. Credit cards aren’t
accepted.

Quimper
This rather bland member of an international chain has emerged as the
top choice in town. It stands in a garden about a mile southwest of the
town center. Follow the signs to route Pont-l’Abbé. Built in the 1980s with
comfortable, standardized bedrooms, it boasts a Breton slate roof and is
ideal for motoring families (the pool is a magnet in summer). Each room
has lots of space, a writing desk, and a midsize bathroom with tub and
shower. On site are a good restaurant and a bar if you don’t want to go into
Quimper at night.

This attractive restaurant near the cathedral gets the best reviews in 
town — and they are deserved. The dining room is certainly lovely, with
large paintings of Breton scenes. Chef Guyon prides himself on a “light and
sophisticated” touch, and the menu is filled with intriguing Breton dishes
with a contemporary twist — such as blé noir (crab rolled in buckwheat
crepes), sauté de langoustines aux artichauts (sautéed prawns and arti-
chokes), and filet St-Pierre (John Dory fish). They serve smooth chocolate
desserts here and, in summer, fraises de Plougastel (local strawberries).

BRETON
On lively rue Ste-Catherine, Rive Gauche stands out for its excellent prices
matched with good food. The décor is hip and modern, and the waitstaff
has a sense of fun and a hint of attitude. Many of the products used in the
dishes come from local farms, and fishermen bring in fresh oysters. Many
Bretons wisely start their meal with a dozen oysters served on seaweed
and accompanied by a vinegar sauce. As a main course, we recommend
thin slices of salmon served in a light cream sauce. If you want to go really
local, order squab with French peas.

Exploring the town
Cathédrale St-Corentin (place St-Corentin; % 02-98-95-06-19) sits at the
center of town. A stone equestrian statue of King Gradlon (legendary
founder of Quimper) is set between the two 76m (250-ft.) spires. Built
between the 13th and 15th centuries, the cathedral has recently under-
gone extensive renovations of its stonework, paintings, and 15th-century
stained-glass windows. Admission is free, and the church is open daily
8:30 a.m. to noon and 2 to 7 p.m. To the west, you find a maze of pedes-
trian streets with some of the best shopping in Brittany. Cross the river
on one of the tiny pedestrian bridges to reach the tourist office. Another
five minutes by foot brings you to faïence heaven, with a museum, tours,
and shops devoted to this local pottery.
For a good introduction to the Breton way of life, the Musée des Beaux-
Arts (40 place St-Corentin; % 02-98-95-45-20) has a large collection of
paintings of the Brittany countryside and genre scenes of the Breton
people. The museum also has a fine collection of paintings from the 16th
through 20th centuries, including works by Rubens, Boucher, Fragonard,
and Corot. A room is devoted to the Pont-Aven school, made famous by
Gauguin; another room is devoted to Max Jacob, born in Quimper. July
and August, the museum is open Wednesday to Monday 10 a.m. to 7 p.m.;
September to June, hours are Wednesday to Monday 10 a.m. to noon and
2 to 6 p.m. Admission is 4€ ($5.20) for adults, 2.50€ ($3.25) for students

Shopping for local treasures
If you’re looking to immerse yourself in the world of Quimper pottery,
you can take a factory tour, see the museum, and spend time in shops
devoted to this local craft.
The main factory/faïence store is HB Henriot (16 rue Haute; % 02-98-
90-09-36). All year, 30-minute guided visits in English (3.50€/$4.55 for
adults, 2€/$2.60 for children) take place Monday to Friday 9:15 to 
11:15 a.m. and 2 to 4:45 p.m. After the tour, you can visit the factory
store with the largest selection of Quimper pottery in town.
Other good shops for Breton wares are Bed Keltiek (2 rue de Roi Gradlon;
% 02-98-95-42-82), which sells pottery, jewelry, and books; and located
next door, François Le Villec (4 rue de Roi Gradlon; % 02-98-95-31-54),
which offers traditional faïence. Heoligou (16 rue du Parc; % 02-98-95-
13-29) has Brittany sweaters and other clothing. The food market is
open at Halles St-François on rue Astor, Monday to Saturday 7 a.m. to 
8 p.m. and Sunday 7:30 a.m. to 1 p.m.
Living it up after dark
Check out rue St-Catherine for a good sampling of bars. St. Andrews
Pub (11 place Stivel; % 02-98-53-34-49) attracts an English-speaking
crowd that enjoys the 45 kinds of beer available here. Café des Arts (on
the corner of rue St-Catherine and boulevard Dupleix; % 02-98-90-32-06)
is a nightclub with a huge drink menu and no cover.
Carnac and Its Prehistoric Stones
Carnac boasts France’s biggest prehistoric site, where thousands of
huge stones stand sentinel over miles of rolling fields near the seaside.
The site has three major groupings, all within a mile of one another:
Alignements du Ménec, Alignements de Kermario, and Alignements de
Kerlescan. Estimated to be from 4500 to 2000 B.C., the stones predate
Stonehenge and even the Egyptian pyramids. Carnac also is a popular
seaside resort; most visitors combine sun and fun with rock-gazing.
Carnac is very quiet from October to May, making it the best time to
wander around the ancient rocks without the distraction of crowds.
Getting there
The best way to get to Carnac is by driving. From Quimper, take N165
east to Auray and then D768 south to Carnac. Driving the 486km (302
miles) from Paris to Carnac takes about five hours. Follow A11 south-
west from Paris to Le Mans and then A81 west to Rennes. From Rennes,
take N24 and then N166 southwest to Vannes. Drive west on E60 to
Auray and south on D768 to Carnac.

Other Brittany favorites
In addition to the major destinations discussed in this chapter, Brittany offers a few
other worthy stops that are not so far off the beaten path.
 Belle Ile: This rustic island lies 15km (9 miles) off the southern coast of Brittany and
is reachable by a 45-minute ferry (26€/$33) for adults, 16€/$21) for children,
120€/$156) for cars round-trip). For information call % 08-20-05-60-00. The island
is the place to try thallasotherapy, a seawater therapy popular at coastal resorts.
Treatments lasting a half-day cost 105€ ($137). The island’s top place to try a treat-
ment and spend the night is the Castel Clara. This hotel (% 02-97-31-84-21; Fax:
02-97-31-51-69; www.castel-clara.com), a Relais & Châteaux establishment
overlooking the sea, has 26 rooms and half board costing 149€ to 310€ ($194–
$403) per person for a double. The restaurant is very expensive and has an excel-
lent reputation. The hotel is closed from mid-November to mid-February.
 Presqu’île de Crozon: A drive around the Crozon Peninsula (58km/36 miles from
Quimper, 261km/162 miles from Nantes) on Brittany’s west coast offers wild and
quintessential Brittany landscapes and seascapes. You’ll find jagged cliffs at
Chèvre, an ancient stone church at Rocamadour, grottoes at Morgat, and prehis-
toric stone alignments at Camaret.
 Pont-Aven: Fans of painter Paul Gauguin will want to visit this pretty little village,
32km (20 miles) from Quimper and 174km (108 miles) from Nantes. Stone houses
and mills along the river Aven make a colorful scene. The small Musée de l’Ecole
de Pont-Aven (% 02-98-06-14-43) displays a couple of Gauguin prints, paintings
by less well-known artists of the time, and many photos of the artists’ colony that
formed in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Artistic types still are drawn to this
village, whose streets are lined with galleries. Pont-Aven also is home to the
cookie company Traou Mad (% 02-98-06-01-03; www.traoumad.com), which
makes the famous Brittany butter cookies.
 St-Malo: This walled town is on the northern coast of Brittany, 171km (106 miles)
from Nantes. The charming town, with its pricey boutiques and lively cobblestone
streets, is popular with day-trippers and tour buses. You can walk all the way
around the town’s ramparts and sunbathe on the brown-sand beaches below.
Children in particular enjoy frolicking in the shallow warm waters surrounding 
St-Malo.

Exploring the town and the mysterious stones
Carnac is divided into two sections: Carnac Plage is the beachfront
resort with modern hotels lining the coast, and about 2.4km (11⁄2 miles)
inland is Carnac Ville, with shops, restaurants, and several nightclubs.
The prehistoric rock formations are on the north side of the city, a few
miles from the beach. A Celtic burial chamber dating from 5000 B.C., the
Tumulus St-Michel, is on rue de Tumulus, just 1.5km (1 mile) east of
Carnac Ville. Built above the chamber is a 16th-century church. The
chamber is closed indefinitely for excavations.
While the purpose of the Alignements de Carnac (% 02-97-52-89-99)
remains a mystery, they can be dated to Neolithic times. Over thousands
of years, villagers have used the rocks as a quarry, so it’s impossible to
know what the original formation was. What’s visible now are rows of
about 2,000 standing stones, some as high as 18m (60 ft.) and weighing
many tons. The most common hypotheses about the stones are that
they marked burial sites, charted the course of the moon and planets, or
were part of a religious ritual. Legend has it that the rocks represent a
Roman army turned to stone.
The three major sites from west to east are the Alignements du Ménec,
Alignements de Kermario, and Alignements de Kerlescan. At Ménec,
the site that’s on route des Alignements to the west of rue des Korrigans,
most of the 1,100 stones are less than 1m (3.2 ft.) high. About a mile east
on route des Alignements is the Kermario site, with about 1,000 stones
in ten lines; this site has a viewing platform. About half a mile farther is
Kerlescan, with 555 stones in 13 lines.
Because of the sheer number of visitors trampling and damaging the
site, the area is fenced off, and access is restricted. October to April,
admission is free, and visitors can walk through the site. But May to
Chapter 17: Brittany 333

September, admission is limited to 25 people at a time (180 per day maxi-
mum), and 90-minute tours cost 5€ ($6.50). The visitor center at the
Alignements de Ménec is open daily 9 a.m. to 6 p.m. To reach the center
from the direction of Carnac, take a right off rue des Korrigans onto
route des Kerlescan.
Musée de Préhistoire (10 place de la Chapelle; % 02-97-52-22-04) dis-
plays interpretations of the alignments and Paleolithic and Neolithic arti-
facts dating back to 450,000 B.C. It also offers a helpful English-language
brochure. Late June to mid-September, the museum is open daily 10 a.m.
to 6 p.m.; late September to mid-June, hours are daily 10 a.m. to 12:30 p.m.
and 1:30 to 7 p.m. Admission is 5€ ($6.50) for adults and 2.50€ ($3.25)
for students.
Living it up after dark
Les Chandelles (avenue de l’Atlantique; % 02-97-52-90-98) is the most
popular disco in these parts, with a 9.10€ ($12) cover. Nearby, the
Whiskey Club (8 av. des Druides; % 02-97-52-10-52) has live music and
dancing. At Le Petit Bedon (106 av. des Druides; % 02-97-52-11-62), a
30-something crowd dances to oldies.

Part VI
Provence and 
the Riviera

In this part . . . 
P
rovence and the French Riviera are sun-kissed regions in
the southeast corner of France, where the air is perfumed
by lavender and fresh herbs and the countryside is dotted with
olive groves and vineyards that you may remember seeing in
van Gogh and Cézanne paintings. In Chapter 18, we explore the
top towns of Provence — Arles, Aix-en-Provence, Avignon, and
St-Rémy-de-Provence — and show you how to stay safe in wild
Marseille. This is France’s most written-about region; its warm,
dry weather and scenic countryside offer an idyllic vacation.
You’ll come across ancient Roman ruins, medieval towns, and
sophisticated cities. The region’s food and wines are famous,
and you’re sure to enjoy some of your most memorable meals
here, enlivened by the colorful Provençal herbs and olive oil.
Beginning with Chapter 19, we move along to where the
coastline meets the warm Mediterranean near the border of
Italy — the part of Provence known as the magical French
Riviera, also called the Côte d’Azur. With many beaches,
charming hill towns, hot nightlife, stunning art museums,
glamorous casinos, and seaside boardwalks, the Riviera is a
festive playground where artists such as Picasso, Matisse,
Léger, and Renoir chose to work and live, and the region’s
museums are full of their colorful canvases.
In Chapter 20, we take you to Nice, the region’s largest city,
and the tiny principality of Monaco, where Grace Kelly once
reigned at the side of Prince Rainier III. Now, gamblers head
here to try their luck at its famous casino, and visitors go to
see the royal palace. Chapter 20 also covers the small but
chic towns of Beaulieu and St-Jean-Cap-Ferrat.
Chapter 21 offers a stop for fun and sun in St-Tropez and 
for the frenetic nightlife of Cannes. The beautiful ports of 
St-Tropez and Antibes are a contrast to the hill towns of Biot,
Vence, and St-Paul-de-Vence.

Chapter 18
The Best of Provence
In This Chapter
 Discovering the historic towns of Provence
 Exploring Avignon’s Palais des Papes
 Following in the footsteps of van Gogh and Cézanne
P
rovence, with its ancient towns, verdant countryside, and mild cli-
mate, is one of the most popular regions of France for visitors.
Whether idling away sun-baked afternoons in picturesque cafes and
shops or seeking out major attractions such as the grand Palais des
Papes in Avignon or the impressive Roman ruins of Glanum in St-Rémy,
your time in Provence is bound to be among the most memorable of
your trip. This region has long been popular with artists, and you can
follow the footsteps of van Gogh in Arles and St-Rémy or seek out the
favorite landscapes of Cézanne in and around Aix-en-Provence. Aix is
one of France’s most beautiful cities, where 18th-century mansions of
golden-colored stone line cours Mirabeau, a magnificent boulevard, and
sculpted fountains gurgle around seemingly every corner.
The fastest TGV train service to France’s south coast made its debut in
June 2001: from Paris to Avignon in two hours and 38 minutes, Paris to
Marseille in three hours, and Paris to Aix in three hours.
Avignon and the Palais des Papes
The walled city of Avignon, capital of Christianity in the 14th century
and home of the regal Palais des Papes, is a good base from which to
tour the region. Because of its strategic site in the Rhône Valley, the city
became a Roman outpost and major stop on trading routes. It rose to
prominence until reaching its pinnacle in the 14th century. Instability in
Rome made Pope Clement V move to France, and for the next 65 years,
Avignon became the papal seat and capital of the Christian world. Seven
French popes ruled over Christendom from the Palais des Papes, and
the city’s diplomatic, artistic, and commercial life prospered. Then,
during the Great Schism (1376–1417), French cardinals decided to make
trouble by continuing to elect French popes even after the papacy had
returned to Rome. Soon all was sorted out, and Rome was back on top.

The period of prosperity forever changed Avignon, which, with its sump-
tuous mansions, grand squares, and towering palace, retains a look of
pride and strength. But Avignon also has a resolutely modern side. In
fact, the city is most famous today for its summer arts festival, which
has helped turn Avignon into a year-round cutting-edge arts community.
Avignon was named a European City of Culture in 2000 (along with eight
other cities). Because of that designation, the city tackled a number of
projects that post-2000 visitors can enjoy: a Museum of Contemporary
Art that houses works from the 1960s to the present (see “Exploring the
town and environs,” later in this chapter), a walking path along the
former boat-towing path on Ile de la Barthelasse, a riverboat shuttle to
Ile de la Barthelasse, the renovation of place Pie, and improvements to
the train station.
Festival d’Avignon (% 04-90-27-66-50; www.festival-avignon.com) is
one of France’s premier arts festivals — officials claim it’s the world’s
biggest theater festival — and the events at this festival aren’t as expen-
sive as those at the arts festival in nearby Aix-en-Provence. Created in
1947, the Festival d’Avignon features performances of theater, music,
and dance, typically during the last three weeks in July.
Getting there
Trains arrive at Avignon’s Gare SNCF on boulevard St-Roch, just outside
the old city ramparts and a ten-minute walk from most hotels and the
center of town. If you have a lot of luggage, a taxi stand is in front of the
train station. If you’re traveling from Paris, TGVs depart from Paris’s
Gare de Lyon. New trains and tracks have cut the trip time to Avignon
from three hours and 20 minutes to two hours and 38 minutes. One-way
trips from Paris to Avignon cost 92€ ($120) in second class and 127€
($165) in first class. From Avignon, frequent trains travel to Marseille (30
minutes, 21€/$27) and Arles (30 minutes, 7.70€/$10). For train reserva-
tions and information, check the Web site at www.sncf.com; dial % 3635
within France.
Avignon is infamous for attracting pickpockets and thieves. Keep a close
eye on your bags, particularly at the train and bus stations.
Aéroport Avignon-Caumont (% 04-90-81-51-51) is 8km (5 miles) south-
east of Avignon, with hour-long direct flights from Paris’s Orly Airport.
To get from the airport to town, a taxi costs 20€ ($26), depending on
traffic. At the airport, you can find rental car offices for Hertz, Europcar,
Avis, Budget, and National Citer.
Avignon’s seedy Gare Routière (bus station) is on boulevard St-Michel,
next to the train station (% 04-90-82-07-35). The information desk is
open Monday to Friday 10:15 a.m. to 1 p.m. and 2 to 6 p.m., and Saturday
9 a.m. to noon. Buses connect to Aix (one hour, 14€/$18), Arles (one
hour, 7€/$9.10), and Pont du Gard (45 minutes, 6.50€/$8.45).

Chapter 18: The Best of Provence 339

If you’re driving from Paris, take A6 south to Lyon and A7 south to
Avignon. Avignon is 683km (425 miles) south of Paris. From Nice,
Marseille, or Lyon, follow A8 and A7 to Avignon. Orange is 30km (19
miles) away from Avignon, St-Rémy 20km (12 miles), Les Baux 25km (16
miles), Arles 35km (22 miles), Aix 60km (37 miles), and Marseille 99km
(62 miles).
Getting around and getting information
Walking from one end of the walled city of Avignon to the other (see the
“Avignon” map) is easy. Many hotels, restaurants, and historic sites,
including the famous Palais des Papes, are clustered in the center of the
city. However, you need to use some sort of public transportation or a
car to get to the nearby walled suburb of Villeneuve-lez-Avignon, a lovely
medieval village with several interesting historic sites.
To reach the walled suburb of Villeneuve-lez-Avignon (about ten min-
utes), catch a no. 10 or 11 bus (Villeneuve puis Les Angles) from the
main post office or the porte de l’Oulle on the west side of the city
(Sundays and holidays it’s the no. 10D bus). Buses run every 20 minutes
(less frequently on Sun) 7 a.m. to 8 p.m. and cost 7.50€ ($9.75). The 100-
seat Les Grands Bateaux de Provence (% 04-90-85-62-25) goes from
Avignon to Ile de la Barthelasse and then to Villeneuve six times per day
in July and August (one-and-a-quarter-hour round-trip). Tickets are
7.50€ ($9.75) for adults (6.75€/$8.80) with the tourist pass called
Avignon Passion — see “Getting to know Avignon,” later in this section
for details) and free for children younger than age eight.
Pick up city bus information and tickets across from the train station at
the TCRA (% 04-32-74-18-32).
You can rent a car at Hertz (816 rue Aulaniere; % 04-90-89-23-60).

Sampling the region’s cuisine
Avignon is capital of the Côtes du Rhône region, in which fine wines have been culti-
vated for 2,000 years. The famous grand crus (top wines) are Châteauneuf-du-Pape,
Gigondas, Vacqueyras, Lirac, Tavel, and Côtes du Rhône.
Regional food specialties include friandise composée de chocolat fin, sucre et liqueur
d’origan (petit fours of chocolate, sugar, and liqueur), fruits confits d’Apt (fruit pre-
served in sugar, a specialty of Apt), berlingots de Carpentas (soft candy, a specialty of
Carpentras), riz et sel de Camargue (rice and salt from the Camargue region), nougat
de Sault (nougat from Sault), and calissons d’Aix (almond-paste candy from Aix). Other
food specialties include olive oil pressed in the village of Les Baux, miel de Ventaux
(honey from Ventaux), olives, ail (garlic), fromage de chèvre (goat cheese), pastis
(anise-flavored liqueur), fougasse (flavored bread), and of course herbes de Provence.

Hôtel Clarion Cloître Saint Louis
$$
Avignon
One of Avignon’s best hotels, this is a pleasing combination of modern and
antique styles. Located just inside the south city walls (close to the train
station), the hotel was built as a Jesuit school in 1589 and became a mili-
tary hospital during the Revolution. The lobby ceiling is constructed of
ancient vaulting, and the furniture is black and sleek. The 80 spacious
rooms and suites are decorated in a contemporary style and come with
minibars, safes, and hair dryers. Their large windows overlook either the
cloister courtyard or the hotel gardens. The big modern wing, with tinted
windows, looks like a Manhattan office tower; rooms in this wing have bal-
conies. On top of the modern wing are a pool and sun deck, open from May
to September. The restaurant serves all meals under the ancient cloister
vaults or in the garden.

Avignon
This 39-room hotel is a little far from the action, in the southwest corner
of the city, not far from the train station and tourist office. The standard
contemporary rooms are comfortable and well maintained — if on the
small and plain side. The building, built around 1929 in the Art Deco style,
has four floors. A tasty continental breakfast is served next to the lobby.
The English-speaking staff will cheerfully recommend a restaurant or
describe an attraction.

Hôtel de la Mirande
$$$–$$$$
Avignon
The beautiful Mirande, occupying a Renaissance palace near the Palais des
Papes, is the top lodging choice, if you have a few euros to spend. Each of
the 20 rooms is individually decorated in grand style; a famous Paris deco-
rator had unlimited resources to search out the most exceptional antiques,
oriental rugs, handmade wallpapers, and damask curtains. The hotel has
a highly regarded restaurant, as well as a cooking school. The inner court-
yard, a secret garden, is lush with plants and sculpture.

Hôtel de l’Horloge

Avignon
Just off place de l’Horloge and close to the Palais des Papes, this hand-
some 67-room hotel is part of a large French chain. The classical 19th-
century facade belies the unabashedly modern guest room décor. The
high-ceiling accommodations come with minibars and hair dryers; the
more expensive ones open onto terraces overlooking the square. Because
the hotel is located in a busy area, the rooms facing the street have sound-
proof windows. A continental breakfast buffet is served on the glassed-in
veranda.

Hôtel de Mons

Avignon
On a quiet street off place de l’Horloge, this family-run hotel, with its 11
simple and odd-shaped rooms, is the best of Avignon’s inexpensive lodg-
ings. An atmospheric 13th-century chapel has been converted into a
Chapter 18: The Best of Provence 343

rough-around-the-edges hotel that nevertheless possesses a homelike
charm. The real treat is the ancient building with its vaulted ceiling and
old stone staircase winding up to the beamed rooms. Breakfast is served
in a vaulted nook off the lobby.

The Europe caters to patrons that appreciate overstated elegance. Built
in 1580, the mansion of the marquis de Graveson has been a hotel since
1799. Guests have included Napoléon, Châteaubriand, Victor Hugo,
Tennessee Williams, Salvador Dalí, and Picasso. The 44 spacious rooms
feature antiques, oriental rugs, chaises, and chandeliers, and boast marble
fireplaces, paneled walls and doors, and classical moldings. The top-floor
suites open onto balconies: two with views of the Palais des Papes, one
with a river vista. La Vieille Fontaine restaurant is decorated with tapes-
tries. In summer, meals are served on the terrace near a fountain.

Considering the location and amenities, this hotel is a great deal in
Avignon. For those who like to be in the heart of the city, the location
couldn’t be better — across the square from the Palais des Papes. (Keep
in mind, however, that it’s a half-mile walk from the train station.) The 25
rooms are charming and stylish, with antique fixtures and stone walls.
Some have a view of the Palais des Papes, which is particularly magnifi-
cent at night. Breakfast can be served in the room. The hotel also has a
reasonably priced Provençal restaurant.

This flower-filled, air-conditioned restaurant is in the heart of Avignon.
Managed by the Brunel family, it offers such delectable specialties as warm
pâté of duckling and breast of duckling with apples. The chef prepares a
superb plate of wild-mushroom-stuffed ravioli with roasted foie gras. The
grilled John Dory is accompanied by artichoke hearts, and even the lowly
pigs’ feet emerge with a sublime taste. The excellent desserts are prepared
fresh daily. Feel free to order house wines by the carafe.

Avignon
PROVENÇAL
This is dining at its most opulent. About half the tables are out on a narrow
street near the Palais des Papes, but the atmospheric frescoed interior of
this 12th-century building is almost worth the (very steep) price. Daring
chef Christian Etienne specializes in tomatoes, truffles, and fish: He bases
entire menus on tomatoes in summer, creates wondrous truffle-studded
concoctions in winter, and prepares fresh fish with imagination. A typical
first course is bouillon de lentilles aux saucisses de couenne (lentil-and-
sausage soup). Main dishes include tronçon de baudroie poêlé au vin rouge
des Côtes du Rhône, poire aux épices (monkfish slices pan-fried with red
wine and spiced pear) and caille farcie d’une brunoise de céleri, ragoût de
muscat aux lardons (celery-stuffed quail with bacon ragout). A homemade
ice cream or sorbet with an unusual flavor is the perfect way to round out
a rich meal.

Avignon
MEDITERRANEAN
This lovely restaurant is set in a secluded courtyard in the center of town,
but you can also dine inside, where the modern décor blends with the
ancient building. The cuisine is Mediterranean with Italian influences. For
the first course, try the excellent antipasto, a sampling of succulent meats
and vegetables, or the légumes grillés à la mozzarella (grilled vegetables
with mozzarella). As a main dish, look no further than the homemade
pastas, served Provençal style with understated sauces containing herbs
from the region. The hip waitstaff, looking for a chuckle, is likely to take
your order with a Cockney accent.

La Fourchette

Avignon
PROVENÇAL
Long a favorite with locals, attracted by the relatively low prices for the
high-quality cuisine, this intimate restaurant fills up early, so reservations
are a must. Expect updated bistro fare prepared with finesse. You get more
choices on the prix-fixe menu than at most restaurants, and the dishes are
quite elaborate for the price. A good first-course choice is the sardines mar-
inées à la coriandre (sardines marinated in coriander); for a main course,
look for the special agneau grillé au romarin (grilled lamb with rosemary).
See map p. 341. 17 rue Racine. % 04-90-85-20-93. Reservations necessary. Main
courses lunch: 23€–25€ ($30–$33); 28€ ($36) at dinner. MC, V. Open: Mon–Fri

Le Venaissin

Avignon
PROVENÇAL
Of the many terrace restaurants and cafes on place de l’Horloge, this one
fills up first. That’s because it has the most varied menu and the lowest
prices. The square is beautiful, particularly at night, when the city hall’s
beaux-arts facade is lit up and the nearby carousel spins to calliope tunes.
Expect faster-than-usual service, tables crammed so tightly you’re likely
to compare dishes with your neighbors, and English menus and English-
speaking waiters. A popular appetizer is the salade mistral, a chef-concocted
mélange that includes melon, crab, and avocado. As a main course, the
loup au safran, courgette provençal (sea bass with saffron and eggplant
Provençal style) and éstouffade de noix de joue de boeuf à la provençal riz
pilaf (beef stew Provençal style with rice pilaf) are standouts. For dessert,
try the crème caramel or compote de pêche à la menthe fraîche (peach com-
pote with fresh mint). Kids will enjoy popular choices such as steak frites
(steak with french fries).

Avignon
PROVENÇAL
From the outside, this looks like a small nothing-special restaurant; but
when tables fill up by 7:30 p.m., you know something wonderful is hap-
pening in the kitchen. It has two floors, so you need to inquire even when
it looks full (better yet, make a reservation). The décor is understated el-
egance lit by romantic candles. The menu, with English translations, high-
lights seafood. Your best bet is the “catch of the day,” usually prepared
with Provençal herbs in a light sauce. The presentation of this dish is
always artistic, with the chef creating patterns from the colors and tex-
tures of fresh vegetables and sauces.

Exploring the town and environs
Avignon itself has a host of intriguing sights, including one of France’s
biggest attractions, the Palais des Papes. Nearby is Villeneuve-lez-
Avignon, a medieval walled city where the wealthy cardinals affiliated
with the Pope’s Palace had their homes.
Getting to know Avignon
The main road through the city center, cours Jean-Jaurès, becomes rue
de la République and leads from the train station outside the city’s
14th-century ramparts to the Palais des Papes about a half-mile away. In
summer, musicians and other entertainers perform on the cobblestone
squares, particularly place du Palais (in front of the Palais des Papes).
Next to the palace is the 12th-century Cathédrale Notre-Dame des
Doms. From the back exit of the cathedral, you find the Promenade du
Rocher des Doms, a lovely garden with views of Villeneuve-lez-Avignon
across the river. Just south of place du Palais is place de l’Horloge (a
handsome square with outdoor cafes), the imposing Hôtel de Ville
(which houses town offices), and the beaux-arts Opéra d’Avignon. In
the area west of here, you can patronize exclusive stores such as
Christian Lacroix and Hermès, along with excellent houseware, pottery,
and antiques stores. Avignon also has good bargain-clothing and gift
shops, particularly in the funky area of rue de la Bonneterie near Les
Halles. Farther east is rue des Teinturiers, where many of the city’s
ethnic restaurants, bars, and nightclubs are located.
Just 3km (2 miles) west of the city, across the Rhône River, is Villeneuve-
lez-Avignon, a walled suburb of Avignon (where the court of the pope
and the cardinals lived). The best way to reach Villeneuve is to drive
Chapter 18: The Best of Provence 347

across the Rhône (and Ile de la Barthelasse) on pont Edouard-Daladier
and head north. Several interesting sights are here, including one of the
biggest Carthusian monasteries in Europe.
At the first attraction you visit (or at the tourist office), pick up a special
free pass called Avignon Passion. You pay full price for the first site and
then you get reduced rates on all the other attractions and tours.
From April to October, three-hour guided walking tours of Avignon
leave daily at 10 a.m. from the tourist office (41 cours Jean-Jaurés; % 04-
90-27-50-53). The tours cost 10€ to 15€ ($13–$20), or 10€ ($13) with the
Avignon Passion pass. During July and August, two-hour guided tours of
Villeneuve-lez-Avignon (% 04-90-25-61-33) leave Tuesday and Thurs-
day at 5 p.m. from the tourist office and cost 6€ ($7.80), or 4€ ($5.20)
with the Avignon Passion pass.
From mid-March to mid-October, the tourist train (% 06-11-35-06-66)
takes in the old city, with main roads and famous monuments, and
lesser-known roads that lead to more remote parts of the ancient city. It
departs every 35 minutes daily (10 a.m.–7:30 p.m.) from place du Palais
and costs 7€ ($9.10). The train travels one of two routes: through the
old town or through the Rocher des Doms gardens.
Visiting Palais des Papes and other Avignon sites
The world’s most important Gothic palace, Palais des Papes (place du
Palais; % 04-90-27-50-73; www.palais-des-papes.com), is certainly
monumental. It’s one of the most visited historic sites in France. In the
14th century, popes ruled Christendom from this palace and caused a
crisis in the Catholic Church, as Avignon and Rome competed for domi-
nance. Rome won, but Avignon got to keep the palace, though Rome
owned the site until the French Revolution. Allow at least an hour to see
everything (you have 25 rooms to visit), and special exhibits are often
set up (for example, during the July arts festival, the Grande Chapelle is
used for an art show). Of the many sections of the palace, the standouts
are the Chapelle St-Jean, on the ground floor, with beautiful 14th-century
frescoes; the pope’s bedroom (chambre à coucher), on the first floor,
decorated with murals of birds and foliage; and the adjacent Studium,
also known as the Stag Room, which is a pope’s study with frescoes of
hunting scenes. Take a look at the large central courtyard known as the
Grande Cour or the Cour d’Honneur, where plays are performed during
the Avignon Festival. The palace doesn’t have much décor, because the
townspeople stripped the decadent interiors during the Revolution. So
you mainly get to see large-scale spaces and frescoes while hearing
about the exploits that took place here. Visits are by free guided tour or
self-guided tour using an audioguide; the audioguide is your best bet as
the tour guide tends to hurry you through. Although the audioguide
doesn’t dwell on scandalous papal activities, it does include plenty of
tidbits. Admission is 9.50€ ($12) for adults and 7.50€ ($9.75) for stu-
dents and children. Combined admission for the palace and pont St-
Bénezet is 12€ ($15) for adults and 9.50€ ($12) for students and

children. The palace is open daily July to September 9 a.m. to 8 p.m.,
April to June and October 9 a.m. to 7 p.m., and November to March 
9:30 a.m. to 5:45 p.m. Last entry is one hour before closing.
Located in the 14th-century Palais des Archevêques, next to the Palais
des Papes, is Avignon’s best art museum, Musée du Petit Palais (place
du Palais; % 04-90-86-44-58). This huge collection of medieval and
Renaissance paintings focuses on Italian paintings from the 13th through
the 16th centuries, Roman and Gothic sculpture from Avignon, and
paintings of the school of Avignon from the 14th through 16th centuries.
A highlight is Botticelli’s Virgin and Child. The palace windows offer
scenic views of Villeneuve-lez-Avignon across the river. The museum is
open Wednesday to Monday (except Jan 1, May 1, July 14, Nov 1, and
Dec 25) June through September 10 a.m. to 1 p.m. and 2 to 6 p.m. and
October to May 9:30 a.m. to 1 p.m. and 2 to 5:30 p.m. Admission is 6€
($7.80), or 3€ ($3.90) with the Avignon Passion pass.
Musée Angladon (5 rue Laboureur; % 04-90-82-29-03; www.angladon.
com) features a small collection of minor Impressionist paintings by
major painters. It’s worth a look for fans of the genre and for those who
enjoy seeing works in situ — that is, in the grand mansion of collector
Jacques Doucet, the flamboyant Parisian fashion designer. Artists repre-
sented include Degas, Daumier, Manet, Sisley, van Gogh, Cézanne,
Picasso, and Modigliani (usually one painting apiece). Most of these
works are on the ground floor. On the second floor are 18th-century-
style salons with antique furniture and artworks from various periods.
It’s open Wednesday to Sunday 1 to 6 p.m., and admission is 6€ ($7.80)
for adults, 4€ ($5.20) for students and children with the Avignon 
Passion pass.
Musée Calvet (65 rue Joseph-Vernet; % 04-90-86-33-84; www.musee-
calvet.org) is Avignon’s fine arts museum set in a magnificent 
18th-century mansion. It displays a broad collection of paintings and
sculptures from the 15th through the 20th centuries, and faïences (pieces
of hand-painted pottery from the region), silverware, and bronzes. The
modern art room has works by Soutine, Manet, Sisley, and Camille Claudel.
Admission is 6€ ($7.80), or 3€ ($3.90) with the Avignon Passion pass. It’s
open Wednesday to Monday 10 a.m. to 1 p.m. and 2 to 6 p.m. In the 17th-
century baroque chapel of the College of Jesuits is Avignon’s archaeolog-
ical museum, the Musée Lapidaire (27 rue de la République; % 04-90-
85-75-38). The exquisite antique sculpture collection includes Egyptian,
Etruscan, Greek, Roman, and Gallo-Roman works, plus antique vases,
bronzes, and glassware. Admission is 2€ ($2.60), or 1€ ($1.30) with the
Avignon Passion pass. It’s open Wednesday to Monday 10 a.m. to 1 p.m.
and 2 to 6 p.m. The town’s decorative arts museum, Musée Louis-Vouland
(17 rue Victor-Hugo; % 04-90-86-03-79; www.vouland.com), features a
superb collection of 17th- and 18th-century works, including tapestries
and faïences, and has a beautiful garden. Admission is 4€ ($5.20), or
2.50€ ($3.25) with the Avignon Passion pass. The museum is open May to
October Tuesday to Saturday 10 a.m. to noon and 2 to 6 p.m., and Sunday
2 to 6 p.m.; November to April it’s open Tuesday to Sunday 2 to 6 p.m.

Medieval people had a funny saying about the pont St-Bénezet (rue
Ferruce; % 04-90-27-51-16; www.palais-des-papes.com): When cross-
ing the bridge, you’d always meet two monks, two donkeys, and two
prostitutes. The saying offers a glimpse into the medieval world, a heady
mix of the sacred and the profane. Legend and lore whirl around this
12th-century bridge that leads to nowhere, with a Romanesque chapel
perched over the raging river. Because of constant flooding by the
mighty Rhône, the bridge was destroyed many times during the Middle
Ages and finally abandoned in the 17th century. It’s said that Louis XIV
was the last to cross the bridge. What’s left are just 4 of the bridge’s origi-
nal 22 arches that stretched across the river, once leading conveniently
to Villeneuve-lez-Avignon. The bridge was built because of the insistence
of the shepherd Bénezet, who allegedly received word from on high that
a bridge should be constructed here. Locals laughed until the scrawny
shepherd suddenly turned into Charles Atlas and started lifting boulders
over to the riverside. The bridge’s Chapelle de St-Nicolas is dedicated 
to the patron saint of bargemen: Bargemen have long plied the river’s
banks. The little museum below the bridge contains photos of paintings
and engravings that have to do with the history of the bridge and what it
looked like in the 18th and 19th centuries. An entertaining audioguide
recounts the bridge’s history. Admission is 4€ ($5.20) for adults (3.30€/
$4.30 with the Avignon Passion pass) and 3€ ($3.90) for students and
children. It’s open daily: April to July 9 a.m. to 7 p.m.; August to Septem-
ber 9 a.m. to 8 p.m.; October to mid-March 9:30 a.m. to 5:45 p.m.; March
15 to 31 9:30 a.m. to 6:30 p.m. Last entry is a half-hour before closing.
The Collection Lambert at the Musée d’Art Contemporain (5 rue
Violette; % 04-90-16-56-20; www.collectionlambert.com) features art
from the 1960s to the present. The museum is in a former private man-
sion, the Hôtel de Caumont, in the center of Avignon, and the 400 works
on display had been in storage for 20 years. The collection includes min-
imal art, conceptual art, photography, and video, with the work of artists
such as Brice Marden, Carl Andre, Anselm Kiefer, Cy Twombly, Andres
Serrano, and Nan Goldin. Admission is 5.50€ ($7.15) for adults and 4€
($5.20) with the Avignon Passion pass and for students and children 4€
and 2€ ($5.20 and $2.60) with pass. The museum is open Tuesday to
Sunday 11 a.m. to 6 p.m.
Seeing Villeneuve-lez-Avignon
Only 3km (2 miles) from Avignon, this suburb is a long walk or a quick
bike ride across the river. You can also take a city bus (see “Getting
around and getting information,” earlier in this chapter) or a taxi.
Founded in the 14th century by Innocent VI (the fifth pope of Avignon),
Chartreuse du Val de Bénédiction (60 rue de la République; % 04-90-
15-24-24) is one of the biggest Carthusian monasteries in Europe, hous-
ing a church, three cloisters (typically public areas with arches, columns,
and artifacts), a chapel full of frescoes, gardens, and 40 monk cells.
You’re free to walk around and take in the atmosphere without a tour
guide. Don’t miss Pope Innocent VI’s Gothic tomb inside the church. The
Chapter 18: The Best of Provence 351

monastery is the location of the Centre National des Ecritures du
Spectacle and provides a lodging retreat for writers. Admission is 6.50€
($8.45) for adults (4.50€/$5.85 with the Avignon Passion pass) and free
for children younger than 18. It’s open daily April to September 9 a.m. to
6:30 p.m. and October to March 9:30 a.m. to 5:30 p.m.
The 14th-century Gothic Fort St-André (Mont Andaon; % 04-90-25-45-
35) was built to protect the city of Villeneuve and show the popes in
Avignon a little French muscle. The fort, ordained by Phillippe le Bel,
once sheltered a 10th-century abbey but now displays pretty gardens
with a grand view of the Rhône Valley and Avignon. Admission is 5€
($6.50) for adults (3.50€/$4.55 with the Avignon Passion pass) and 3.50€
($4.55) for children. It’s open daily April to September 10 a.m. to 12:30 p.m.
and 2 to 6 p.m. and October to March 10 a.m. to noon and 2 to 5 p.m.
When the pont St-Bénezet stretched all the way across the Rhône River,
Tour Philippe le Bel (rue Montée-de-la-Tour; % 04-32-70-08-57) stood at
the base of the bridge, marking the entrance to the Gothic town of Ville-
neuve. The guardians of the citadel effectively controlled access to the
bridge for all those approaching Avignon from the north in the 14th 
century. Climb the steep spiral staircase for the best view of Avignon
and the Rhône Valley. Admission is 1.80€ ($2.35) for adults and 1€
($1.30) with the Avignon Passion pass and free for students and children
younger than 17. It’s open Tuesday to Sunday 10 a.m. to 12:30 p.m. and 
2 to 6:30 p.m. Closed February.
Shopping for local treasures
Most markets in Avignon are open 7 a.m. to 1 p.m. The big covered
market is Les Halles on place Pie, open Tuesday to Sunday. Smaller food
markets are on rue du Rempart St-Michel on Saturdays and Sundays, and
on place Crillon on Fridays. The flower market is on place des Carmes on
Saturdays, and it becomes a flea market on Sundays. A more upscale
antiques market fills up rue des Teinturiers all day on Saturdays.
Living it up after dark
Avignon sports a lively nightlife, with the young and restless strolling up
and down rue de la République deciding where to make a night of it.
Try the Auberge de Cassagne (450 allée de Cassagne; % 04-90-31-04-18)
and Brasserie Le Cintra (44 cours Jean-Jaurès; % 04-90-82-29-80; www.
le-cintra.com). The Red Zone (27 rue Carnot; % 04-90-27-02-44)
offers live concerts featuring rock, country, and jazz. Le Woolloomooloo
(16 rue des Teinturiers; % 04-90-85-28-44) is a funky place featuring
“food of the world” and live music with no cover.

St-Rémy-de-Provence and Its Roman Ruins
At the foot of the Alpilles mountains, ancient St-Rémy-de-Provence
retains a soupçon (a tiny bit) of the small-town flavor of Provence that
some of the more touristy towns have lost. The downside is that you
won’t find much to see or do, and it’s difficult to get here by public
transportation (the town has no train station). The main attraction is
just outside town: The Ruines de Glanum — extraordinary Roman ruins
that are still being excavated — include finds dating to the first millen-
nium B.C. Famous residents of St-Rémy have included French astrologer
Michel de Nostredame (better known as Nostradamus), whose enigmatic
predictions have been a source of debate for centuries. Dutch artist
Vincent van Gogh checked into a mental hospital in St-Rémy in 1889 and
painted some of his most famous works here. St-Rémy has become a
destination for shopping for the home, with many antiques and interior
decorating stores.
An idyllic time to visit St-Rémy is during the Fête de la Transhumance.
On Whit Monday (around June 5), shepherds from the surrounding area
march their flocks into town, arriving around 10:30 a.m., and drive them
twice around the center for about two hours. On August 15, Carreto
Ramado, 50 horses pull an enormous cart loaded with local produce
into town. Around that same date, the Feria Provençale de St-Rémy fea-
tures bullfights in which the bulls aren’t killed.
Chapter 18: The Best of Provence 353
Beyond Avignon
Try the famous Châteauneuf-du-Pape wine at the Musée des Outils de Vignerons
(avenue Bienheureux-Pierre-de-Luxembourg; % 04-90-83-70-07). It’s open daily 9 a.m.
to noon and 2 to 6 p.m. for a visit and “free and tutored tasting” of the Laurent-Charles
Brotte and Père Anselme cuvée. Of course, you can also buy wine here. You can catch
a bus from Avignon to Châteauneuf-du-Pape or drive 13km (8 miles) north on A9.
One of Provence’s top sights is a great Roman aqueduct, pont du Gard (% 04-66-37-
51-12), about 20km (12 miles) from Avignon and 23km (14 miles) northeast of Nîmes,
with its triple row of arches spanning the Gard River. You can walk across the aque-
duct, built in 19 B.C., and around a nearby arboretum. Bring a picnic and a bottle of
wine, or you can find restaurants nearby. Parking is free. The visitor centers on either
side of the bridge show films. The center on the east side, called Le Portal, also has
children’s activities and an exhibit about the bridge. From Avignon, exit the city from
the southwest on the pont de l’Europe on A9 and head toward Nîmes. Take N100 to
N86, and cross the Gard River. Follow D981 north to the parking area for the pont du
Gard. Several buses depart Avignon each day and arrive at a stop that’s about a ten-
minute walk from the pont du Gard (45 minutes, 6.50€/$8.45).

Getting there
Buses arrive at and depart from St-Rémy’s place de la République, near
the large fountain just outside the old town center on the west side.
Buses to and from Avignon take 40 minutes and cost 4€ ($5.20; % 04-
90-92-05-22). From Avignon, you can get bus or train connections to
most other major Provence towns. The nearest train station is Avignon
Gare. For information, call % 08-92-35-35-39 or 3635 within France.
The nearest airport is the Aéroport Avignon-Caumont (% 04-90-81-
51-15), which is 18km (11 miles) from St-Rémy. Aéroport Nîmes-Arles-
Camarque (% 04-66-70-49-49) is 40km (25 miles) away, and the
Aéroport Marseille-Provence (% 04-42-14-14-14) is 85km (53 miles)
away. With no buses from these airports to St-Rémy, you’ll need to rent 
a car if you arrive by air. All three airports have rental car offices for
Hertz, Avis, Europcar, National Citer, and Budget.
St-Rémy is 705km (438 miles) from Paris and 18km (11 miles) from
Avignon. To drive from Paris, follow the directions to Avignon; then take
D571 to St-Rémy. From the direction of Nice, follow A8 to A7 and the
signs to St-Rémy. From the direction of Nîmes and Arles, take A9 to 
St-Rémy. St Rémy is centrally located in Provence. Aix is 50km (31 miles)
from St-Rémy, Marseille 90km (56 miles), Avignon 21km (13 miles), Les
Baux 10km (6 miles), and Arles 22km (14 miles).
Getting around and getting information
Abrivado (Zone Activites La Gare, 6 Traverse Meicocouliers; % 04-90-
92-06-34) is the location for Budget and National rental cars. For a cab,
call Taxi E. Grimauld at % 06-09-31-50-38 or Dalgon Taxi at % 06-09-
52-71-54.
The tourist office is on place Jean-Jaurès (% 04-90-92-05-22; Fax: 04-
90-92-38-52; www.saintremy-de-provence.com). Late June to mid-
September, it’s open Monday to Friday 9 a.m. to noon and 2 to 7 p.m.,
and Saturday and Sunday 9 a.m. to noon. The office also has a wide
range of brochures, including self-guided tours of locations where van
Gogh painted. Ask about walking tours (in English) of the town center.
You can send e-mail at Compo Secretariat Services (6 bis bd. Marceau;
% 04-90-92-48-11), open Monday to Friday 9 a.m. to noon and 1:30 to
6:30 p.m.
Spending the night
Just outside the medieval walls of Les Baux (a pedestrian-only hilltop 
village 13km/8 miles from St-Rémy) is a fancy Relais & Châteaux hotel,
L’Oustau de Beaumanière (% 04-90-54-33-07; Fax: 04-90-54-40-46),
known for serving some of the best food in the region. Don’t be fooled
by the bland exterior — the rooms are opulent, renting for 245€ to 390€
($319–$507) double and 360€ to 490€ ($468–$637) apartment.

Château de Roussan
$
St-Rémy (west of town)
Set in a large landscaped park with sculpture gardens and fountains, this
quirky manse, about a mile from St-Rémy, is for those who want to pay bar-
gain rates to stay in a château with an amusing down-on-its-luck quality.
The elegant neoclassical facade belies the neglected interior, and the
atmosphere is casual to the extreme. The upside is that the toys belong
to a cute family of black labs; a family of cats lives on the second floor. The
21 rooms are decorated with an unusual combination of interesting
antiques and flea market finds, and the housekeeping is somewhat hit and
miss. The common room has a billiards table, piano, and many board
games. You can rent bikes for 16€ ($21) per day. The restaurant serves
average, if pricey, fare.
See map p. 355. Route de Tarascon. % 04-90-92-11-63. Fax: 04-90-92-50-59. www.
chateau-de-roussan.com. Rack rates: 60€–102€ ($78–$133) double. Breakfast:
9.50€ ($12) in restaurant or room. Half board: 29€ ($38). AE, DC, MC, V.
Hostellerie du Vallon de Valrugues
$$–$$$$
St-Rémy (east of town)
An exquisite hotel east of the old town, Vallon de Valrugues is one of the
region’s top choices, featuring a blend of modernity and tradition on a
large estate. The 34 spacious rooms and 18 grand apartments offer moun-
tain views (Alpilles, Lubéron, and Mont Ventoux), deluxe amenities such as
bathrobes and fine toiletries, safes, and minibars; 11 rooms contain
Jacuzzis. The prestige suite has its own pool. Also on site are a large
heated pool, a driving range and putting green, a sauna, a billiards table,

Hôtel les Ateliers de l’Image

St-Rémy
Near the tourist office and a short walk from the old town’s center, this hip
hotel with a photography theme includes an art gallery, a photo lab, and a
photo shop. The owners converted the old St-Rémy music hall into a very
contemporary hotel with 32 rooms. Although it’s on a busy street, this hotel
is set back from the road down a narrow alley and is surprisingly tranquil.
In the front terrace, you find a small heated pool. The glass-fronted lobby
is all about light and space, with soaring ceilings and lots of glass. The
rooms are simple, modern, and stylish, with personal fax machines, modem
sockets, and hair dryers; some open onto mountain views. There’s a bil-
liards table, a bar, and bike rentals. The English-speaking staff is friendly
and will pick you up at the Avignon train station or airport.

La Maison du Village

St-Rémy
Our favorite nest in the über-Provençal town is this meticulously restored
18th-century townhouse in the center of St-Rémy. Warm and welcoming,
each of the five units is a suite with a big sitting area and a luxurious bath-
room. They’re decorated in soft colors, with tasteful fabrics and wrought-
iron beds. The old-fashioned, free-standing bathtubs are large enough for
a romantic duo. On request, the innkeepers serve organic meals in the
family-style dining room or the little “secret garden” out back. Drinks are
served and soft music plays in the communal lounge.

Le Resto Bar/Le Provence/Le sushi Bar

St-Rémy
FRANCO-JAPANESE
This is a three-in-one dining choice: Le Resto Bar is mainly for informal
snacking, Le Provence for reginal specialties, and Le Sushi—well, it’s obvi-
ous what is served here. Thanks to this place’s minimalist décor and
unusual hybrid cuisine, you may imagine that you’ve been suddenly trans-
ported back to Paris, except for the view of the Alpilles, the olive trees, and
the nearby presence of a swimming pool within the surrounding park. The
cuisine mingles Asian and European food seamlessly and with creativity.
You may begin a meal with giozan, Japanese ravioli stuffed with crayfish,
Part VI: Provence and the Riviera

or a block of foie gras studded with truffles. Main courses include tourne-
dos Rossini (filet layered with foie gras), ravioli stuffed with lobster and
served with a sake and herb sauce, and calamari that’s artfully shaped into
replicas of miniature pine cones and served with risotto flavored with
algae and squid ink. A wide selection of sushi and sashimi also is offered.
Despite the implications of trendiness and high fashion, the dress code
here is very relaxed.

Exploring the town
St-Rémy walking tours (% 04-90-92-05-22) leave the tourist office at
place Jean-Jaurès Fridays at 2:30 p.m.; with a minimum of ten people, 
the tours last one-and-a-half hours and cost 6.50€ ($8.45) for adults and
3.65€ ($4.75) or ages 12 to 18 and students. Van Gogh tours (% 04-90-
92-05-22) departs the tourist office every Tuesday, Thursday, and Friday
at 10 a.m. and last one-and-a-half hours; the cost is 6.50€ ($8.45) for
adults and 3.70€ ($4.80) for ages 12 to 18 and students. The cost of the
van Gogh tour includes reduced admission to the Centre d’Art Présence
van Gogh and St-Paul de Mausolée (see later in this section). Guides take
you to the locations painted by van Gogh in the St-Rémy area. You can
arrange your own self-guided tour of locations painted by van Gogh by
picking up a brochure with map from the tourist office.
One of southern France’s major classical sites, the Ruines de Glanum
(avenue van Gogh; % 04-90-92-23-79) is about a mile south of St-Rémy.
The earliest findings from the ruins date to the Iron Age, during the first
millennium B.C., when a fortified settlement likely occupied this site.
Later the Celts arrived, and the ruins eventually came under Greek influ-
ence, turning Glanum into a religious and commercial center. It later fell
under Roman rule, which explains the characteristic thermal baths,
villas, basilica, and temples. Wander through the ruins of the first-cen-
tury Roman town, complete with a main street and house foundations.
Ongoing excavations began in 1921. Archaeologists believe the site is
actually about six or seven times the size of what has been uncovered 
so far. Many of the findings from Glanum are displayed at the Musée
Archéologique (see later in this section). The site is open daily (except
Jan 1, May 1, Nov 1 and 11, and Dec 25) April through August 10 a.m. 
to 6:30 p.m. and September to March 10:30 a.m. to 5 p.m. Admission is
6.50€ ($8.45) for adults and 4.50€ ($5.85) for ages 18 to 25.
Monastère de St-Paul-de-Mausolée (av. Edgar-le-Roy off av. Van Gogh; 
% 04-90-92-77-00) is the 12th-century monastery where van Gogh
checked himself in for mental health reasons from May 1889 to May
1890. He loved the place and painted prolifically there, completing more
Chapter 18: The Best of Provence 359

than 150 paintings, including his famous Starry Night. The ancient build-
ing still serves as a psychiatric hospital, but you can walk around the
chapel and cloisters. It’s open April to October Sunday to Friday 9:30 a.m.
to 7 p.m. and Saturday 10 a.m. to 7 p.m.; November to March Tuesday to
Sunday 10:30 a.m. to 5 p.m. Admission is 3.80€ ($4.95) for adults and
2.80€ ($3.65) for students and children.
Occupying a beautiful old mansion, Centre d’Art Présence van Gogh
(8 rue Estrine; % 04-90-92-34-72) is a small art museum that hosts three
or four exhibits per year. The permanent collection is diverse, with works
from ancient Egypt and Rome, and paintings from the 17th through 19th
centuries. A room devoted to van Gogh has reproductions of some of the
works he painted in the region. A few contemporary artists also are rep-
resented in the museum. A French film about the artist Poussin is shown
a few times daily. Late March to December, it’s open Tuesday to Sunday
10:30 a.m. to 12:30 p.m. and 2:30 to 6:30 p.m. Admission is 3.20€ ($4.15)
for adults and 2.30€ ($3) for children.
If you’re looking for more Roman ruins, you can check out Les Antiques,
the name given to two ancient sculptured monuments marking the
southern entrance to St-Rémy on avenue Van Gogh across from the
entrance to Glanum. Mausolée des Jules is a funerary monument from
30–20 B.C. and the triumphal arch next to it, the Arc de Triomphe, is
from around 20 B.C.

Other Provence favorites
If you have the time and the interest, you can extend your exploration of Provence
with the following sites.
 Apt: Centrally located in the hilly Lubéron region (54km/33 miles from Avignon),
Apt is worth a visit particularly for its Saturday market, which features itinerant
musicians in addition to the usual fresh produce, cheeses, and meats from the
region. The town’s 11th-century cathedral is famous for a relic known as the veil
of St. Anne. The nearby Parc Naturel Régional du Lubéron is well suited for hiking
and biking.
 Cavaillon: Home of famous melons, Cavaillon (21km/13 miles from Avignon) is an
ancient town that’s now an important farming area. Neolithic remains have been
found on St-Jacques hill, which overlooks the town and provides panoramic
views of the Lubéron region. The two Roman arches that sit on place François-
Tourvel represent the Roman roots of the town.
 Châteauneuf-du-Pape: Grapes for one of the most famous wines of France are
grown around the medieval village of Châteauneuf-du-Pape (13km/8 miles from
Avignon), which was the summer home of the popes of Avignon. You can see the
ruins of the 14th-century Château des Papes, from where you can find panoramic
views of the valley. You can taste the famous wine at Père Anselme’s cellar and
Musée des Outils de Vignerons.

Chapter 18: The Best of Provence 361
 Grand Canyon du Verdon: The gorges of the Ardèche in the Rhône Valley (40km/
25 miles from Avignon), known as the Grand Canyon of France, is nature at its
wildest and most beautiful — 289m (950-ft.) canyons dotted with grottoes and
caves. The scenic D290 runs along the rim of the canyon, with spectacular views
and plenty of places to park near well-marked footpaths. The north part of the
canyon is less touristy than the southern section.
 Les Baux: Most people take a day-trip to Les Baux (13km/8 miles from Avignon),
a pedestrian-only village perched on the white rocks of the Alpilles and capped
by castle ruins. You can visit 13th-century castle ruins; troubadour concerts are
played in the church at the top of the hill in July and August.
 Orange: Take in an outdoor concert, perhaps Pavarotti, at the impressive Roman
Théâtre Antique. For ticket information, call % 04-90-34-24-24. Mid-July to mid-
August, a theater, music, and dance festival is held here. Nearby is a Relais &
Châteaux property, Château de Rochegude (% 04-75-97-21-10; www.chateaude
rochegude.com), with tennis courts, a pool, and a gourmet restaurant. Orange
is 26km (16 miles) from Avignon.
 Roussillon and Bonnieux: These two quaint hilltop villages (both about 40km/
25 miles from Avignon) are quintessential Provence. Roussillon is well known for
the ochre-colored rock surrounding the area, which boasts 17 shades from golden
yellow to bright red. Bonnieux still has parts of its ancient ramparts surrounding
the town. Both villages offer extraordinary views of the countryside. Near
Bonnieux is a well-preserved Roman bridge called the pont Julien, with three
arches spanning the Calavon River.
 Tarascon: This town on an island in the center of the Rhône River (23km/14 miles
from Avignon) is worth a visit to see the most impressive Gothic castle in
Provence, the 15th-century Château de Tarascon. Sitting on the edge of the river,
the heavily fortified structure has a medieval apothecary, a collection of tapes-
tries, and a Provençal garden. From the terrace are sweeping views of the sur-
rounding countryside. Tarascon’s most famous legend concerns a sea monster
that was tamed by St. Martha. The town celebrates an annual festival in honor of
the legend on the last weekend in June.
 Toulon: This bustling town (68km/42 miles from Marseille) is the headquarters of
a French naval base. Hills topped with forts surround a large pretty harbor. Near
the harbor are traditional markets and the Cathédrale Ste-Marie-Majeure, built
in the Romanesque style in the 12th century. Two interesting museums are the
Musée de la Marine, with figureheads and ship models, and the Musée de Toulon,
with artworks from the 16th century to the present, including a good collection of
Provençal and Italian paintings.
 Uzès: The center of this medieval village (38km/24 miles from Avignon) is the 13th-
century castle called Duché, with apartments decorated in a Renaissance style.
Nearby is the unique Tour Fenestrelle, a 42m (138-ft.) round tower with six levels
of windows that used to be part of an early Romanesque cathedral. Seventeenth-
century playwright Jean Racine lived here for a short time, and the village and
countryside influenced him.

Shopping for local treasures
St-Rémy is a center of home decorating, with many antiques shops and
fabric stores on the boulevards surrounding the old town and on the old
town’s narrow streets. You can find a couple of good antiques stores on
the outskirts of town: Au Broc de St-Ouen (route d’Avignon; % 04-90-
92-28-90) has several dealers, and Portes Anciennes (route d’Avignon;
% 04-90-92-13-13; www.portesanciennes.com) sells a good selection of
antiques and flea-market finds.
Pierre Leron-Lesure has devoted his life to making what he calls
sylvistructures (sculptures from juniper-tree trunks). You can see these
unique sculptures in the workshop, on the marble spiral staircase, and
in the garden of the Chimères du Bois, a gallery in an ancient mansion
on rue de Parage (across from the archaeological museum; % 04-90-92-
02-28). Open by appointment only.
St-Rémy is known for having great markets. On Wednesday mornings on
the streets of the old town, vendors spread out their wares, including
spices, olives, fabrics, and crafts. On Saturday morning, a small market
is open near the Eglise St-Martin on boulevard Marceau.
Arles: Following in the Steps of van Gogh
Boasting Roman ruins, medieval churches, 18th-century mansions, and
tributes to 19th-century painter Vincent van Gogh, Arles is rich with 
history. Its strategic position on the Rhône has long made it popular.
Greeks first settled in the area around the 6th century B.C. In the 1st cen-
tury B.C., Julius Caesar gave the city prominence in his empire after the
citizens of Arles assisted the Romans in their capture of Marseille. It
experienced a Golden Age when it was known as Rome of the Gauls.
In the early years of Christianity, Arles became a great religious center,
but invasions throughout the Middle Ages ravaged the town. It was
revived in the 12th century, and you can see a number of impressive
Romanesque buildings from that period, including Eglise St-Trophime,
which once was a cathedral. In the 17th and 18th centuries, noblemen
built mansions in the city center; the mansions surrounding place du
Forum are now elegant hotels. Today, Arles is most famous for being one
of the final homes of Impressionist painter Vincent van Gogh. Fans of the
tormented artist will find many reminders of him.
Getting there
Trains leave from Paris’s Gare de Lyon and arrive at Arles’s Gare SNCF
(avenue Paulin-Talabot), a short walk from the town center. One high-

Méditerranée (CTM) runs buses between Arles and the airport. Buses
arrive at, and leave from, boulevard Clemenceau near the tourist office
(see “Getting around and getting information,” later in this chapter).
Aéroport International Marseille/Provence is 70km (44 miles) from

lead to Arles. From Avignon, take A7 to A54 to N113. Driving time from
Avignon to Arles is about 25 minutes. Driving from Paris to Arles takes
about seven hours. Arles is 740km (450 miles) from Paris and 35km 
(22 miles) from Avignon.
Getting around and getting information
All of the major sites in Arles are within walking distance from the center
of town. The only site that’s inconvenient to walk to is the Musée de
l’Arles Antiques (about 15 minutes away); it’s an awkward walk past
major roadways (with sidewalks).
For a rental car, try Avis (avenue Paulin-Talabot; % 04-90-96-82-42),
Hertz (boulevard Victor-Hugo; % 04-90-96-75-23), or Europcar (boule-
vard Victor-Hugo; % 04-90-93-23-24). You can rent bikes at Europbike
Provence (1 rue Philippe Lebon; % 04-90-49-54-69) for 13€ ($17) for a

ancient hotel has sections built in the 12th and the 15th centuries. Access
to the rooms is up a steep, narrow, winding stone stairway. The 18 rooms
are on the small side, but they’re brightened by Provençal fabrics on the
bedspreads and curtains. Fans help to alleviate the summer heat.
Breakfast is served on the terrace in front of the hotel.

Arles
Although this is one of Arles’s most elegant hotels (right on the central
square), the reasonable rates make it a great value. The 38 spacious and
attractive rooms are decorated with antiques and luxurious fabrics. The
windows are soundproof, but if you like it extra quiet, request a room in
the rear. The commons rooms are comfortable. The hotel also has a bar

A welcoming English-speaking couple runs this cozy, but difficult-to-find
hotel; it’s tucked away on a steep side street between the Roman Theater
and a medieval cloister. One side of the hotel is held up by 13th-century
vaults from the adjacent cloister. The rooms in the back of the hotel have
views of the cloister garden, while the other units offer views of the
Romanesque Eglise St-Trophime. The 30 accommodations boast antique
details such as beamed ceilings and stone walls.

Arles
FRENCH/PROVENÇAL
Named after its founder, who, according to local legend, grew to resemble a
wolf as he aged, this cozy, well-managed restaurant occupies a stone-fronted
antique house in the historic core of Arles, near the ancient Roman arena.
Today it’s owned by members of the Allard family, who prepare serious gour-
met French food that’s more elaborate than the cuisine at many competi-
tors. The best examples include hearty filet of bull braised in red wine,
monkfish in saffron sauce, roasted cod with sweet green and red peppers in
saffron sauce, and superb duckling cooked in duck fat and served with flap
mushrooms. Reservations are important — the room seats only 30.
See map p. 365. 39 rue des Arènes. % 04-90-96-96-69. Reservations recommended.

Arles
PROVENÇAL
A short walk from the old town center, this traditional restaurant with
garden seating provides solid fine dining in an attractive setting filled with
locals. The menu features Provençal specialties served with the freshest
ingredients. The best main course is the millefeuille de brousse et tomate
confit basilic (pastry of goat’s cheese and tomato-basil confit). As a meat
dish, the chef recommends suprême de poulet farci à la tapenade, roti à la
broche (guinea fowl breast stuffed with olive paste and spit roasted). For
dessert, try the special croustade de poire amande (pear-and-almond
pastry).

Arles
PROVENÇAL
Here you can dine alfresco across from the majestic Roman Amphitheater.
The simple Provençal fare is served by friendly English-speaking waiters,
and the prices are low considering the quality. Locals know about the good
value here, so the small restaurant frequently needs to turn diners away
as the night wears on. Recommended are the salade Arlesienne, with
salmon, pine nuts, cucumbers, and olives, and the superbe bouillabaisse,
fish-and-shellfish stew. The dishes are presented with a flourish and sides
such as ratatouille. For dessert, try the crème caramel.

on the terrace. The cuisine features creative twists on Provençal special-
ties. A first course could be queues de langoustine en salade vinaigrette d’a-
grumes et basilic (crustacean and a salad with citrus-and-basil vinaigrette)
or risotto de homard aux truffes (lobster risotto with truffles). As a main
course, try pavé de loup en barigoule d’artichaut et à la sauge (a thick slice
of wolf fish with sage-stuffed artichokes) or filet mignon de veau et ragoût
fin de cèpes et salsifis (veal with a stew of mushrooms and oyster plant).
For dessert, you can’t go wrong with biscuit glacé au miel de lavande (a

Exploring the town
The historic center of Arles is place de la République, with a monumen-
tal obelisk towering over a fountain. Facing the fountain are the ornate
17th-century Hôtel de Ville, the town hall, and the Romanesque Eglise
St-Trophime. A block east are the first-century ruins of the Théâtre
Antique and, close by, the even more impressive first-century
Amphithéâtre (also called the Arènes), where bullfights are held. All
that remains of the old Roman forum in place du Forum are a couple 
of columns (part of the Hôtel Nord-Pinus), but the area is now a pretty
square filled with cafes and surrounded by deluxe hotels.
Easter to October, the Petit Train d’Arles (% 04-93-41-31-09) tours the
town in 35 minutes at a cost of 6€ ($7.80) for adults and 3€ ($3.90) for
children ages 3 to 10. The train leaves from the Arènes entrance daily 
10 a.m. to 7 p.m.
If you plan to see a lot of sights, you can save money by purchasing a spe-
cial ticket at the first museum you visit or at the tourist office. The Villet
Global pass (14€/$18 for adults, 12€/$16 for students and children 12 to
18 and free for children younger than 12) gets you into the Amphithéâtre,
Théâtre Antique, Cryptoportique, Thermes de Constantin, Cloitre St-
Trophime, Les Alyscamps, Musée Reattu, Musée de l’Arles Antique, and
Musée Arlatan.
Many of the sights in Arles (including Théâtre Antique and Les
Alyscamps) follow these daily hours: 10 to 11:30 a.m. and 2 to 4:30 p.m.;
March to April and October 9 to 11:30 a.m. and 2 to 5:30 p.m.; May to
September 9 to 11:30 a.m. and 2 to 6 p.m. The Thermes de Constantin
and the Cloitre St-Trophime are also open daily: November to February
10 to 4:30 p.m., March to April 9 a.m. to 5:30 p.m.; May to September 
Part VI: Provence and the Riviera 
368

9 a.m. to 6 p.m.; and October 9 a.m. to 5:30 p.m. All four of these sights
share the same admission: 4.50€ to 5.50€ ($5.85–$7.15) for adults and
2.50€ to 4.50€ ($3.25–$5.85) for students and children younger than 18.
The A.D. 80 Amphithéâtre (Arènes; rond-pont des Arènes; % 04-90-49-
36-86) is Arles’s most dramatic Roman ruin. The space was used in
Roman times for brutal gladiator-type sporting events (using wild ani-
mals). In the Middle Ages, the Arènes became a fortress and later a
squatters’ camp. Though the steps and seats have been ravaged by time,
the theater, built for 20,000 spectators, can still hold about half of its
original capacity. Today, the city uses the space to host the Arles version
of a bullfight (which is not bloody like the Spanish version) during Les
Dix Jours du Toro from mid- to late April and the Fêtes d’Arles in early
July and mid- to late September. (Occasionally, Spanish-style bullfights
take place during these festivals. If you don’t want to see the occasional
Spanish-style bullfights where the bull is killed, avoid events with the
description “mise-à-mort.”) The most popular bullfighting event in Arles

In search of van Gogh
In February 1888, Dutch artist Vincent van Gogh (1853–1890) took the train to Arles to
escape dreary Paris. Although he arrived to find snow and ice, he decided to stay.
That fall, his friend and fellow artist Paul Gauguin visited, but the two had a terrible
falling out, and Gauguin left. A drunken van Gogh then cut off his own left earlobe and
presented it to a prostitute at a nearby brothel. The townspeople were concerned
about this “lunatic from the North,” so van Gogh allowed himself to be hospitalized at
the Hôtel Dieu in Arles. He continued to paint prolifically but soon transferred to a rest
home in St-Rémy. In July 1890, van Gogh attempted suicide and died two days later.
However, during those 18 months in Arles, he produced more than 200 paintings and
more than 100 drawings and watercolors, including some of his most famous works
(The Yellow House, The Bedroom at Arles, Vincent’s Chair, The Night Café, and Café
at Night, Place du Forum). He also wrote hundreds of letters.
Though you won’t find any van Gogh paintings in Arles, fans of the artist enjoy seeing
some of the sites he painted and some of the tributes to him. A statue of the artist with
one ear is in the Jardin d’Eté, just south of the Théâtre Antique. The Hôtel Dieu where
van Gogh was institutionalized is now a cultural center called the Espace Van Gogh
(place Félix-Rey; % 04-90-49-39-39). In this center, you can admire the flower-filled
cloister he painted. The building also houses a library and an art gallery and shows free
films. Admission is free to the Espace Van Gogh, which is open daily 10 a.m. to 7 p.m.
True van Gogh fans should visit Les Alyscamps, the Roman cemetery that the artist
painted several times. The cafe made famous in the painting Café at Night is in the
southeast corner of place du Forum. Perhaps the most rewarding site for van Gogh
buffs is the Fondation Van Gogh next to the Arènes, displaying homages to van Gogh
by artists such as David Hockney, Jasper Johns, and Roy Lichtenstein (see later in the
chapter for more details).

is more of a pageant-type spectacle in which bulls raised in the nearby
Camargue region are taunted but not harmed. In this event, called a
cocarde, the bull is outfitted with colorful ribbons tied to its horns, and
the razeteurs are the men in the ring who try to remove the ribbons. For
details on the events held here, call % 04-90-96-03-70. See earlier in this
section for hours and admission.
Fans of van Gogh and contemporary art may enjoy the Fondation Van
Gogh (24 bis rond-pont des Arènes; % 04-90-49-94-04; www.fondation
vangogh-arles.org). The homages to van Gogh are conceived in paint-
ings, sculptures, photos, mixed media, letters, and musical scores — all
loaded with van Gogh colors and motifs, such as ragged shoes, cane
chairs, sunflowers, cypresses, and ears. Artists represented include Alex
Katz, Francis Bacon, Larry Rivers, David Hockney, Jasper Johns, Robert
Motherwell, and Roy Lichtenstein. The works contemplate his sorrow
and solitude and pay tribute to his energy and his vision’s intensity.
English translations are available throughout. The museum is open April
to June, daily 10 a.m. to 6 p.m.; July to September, daily 10 a.m. to 7 p.m.;
October to March Tuesday to Sunday 11 a.m. to 5 p.m. Admission is 7€
($9.10) for adults and 5€ ($6.50) for students and children.
When the Théâtre Antique (rue de la Calade; % 04-90-49-36-25) was
built in the 1st century B.C., it could hold 10,000 spectators. Alas, all that
remains are lots of ancient rubble and two sad-looking Corinthian
columns nicknamed the Deux Veuves (two widows). For hundreds of
years, beginning in the 5th century, the theater was used as a rock
quarry, helping to build churches, homes, and fortifications. But the
space is now back to its original use as an open-air theater: July brings a
performing-arts festival and a costume festival called the Festival of the
Queen of Arles. See earlier in this section for hours and admission.
Built from the 12th through the 14th centuries, Eglise et le Cloitre 
St-Trophime (place de la République; % 04-90-49-36-36), with its elabo-
rately carved facade, is one of the most beautiful Romanesque churches
in Provence. A famous Last Judgment image is sculpted above the
imposing brick-red doors. The most beautiful part of the church is the
cloister, with evocative stone carvings and two Romanesque and two
Gothic galleries. See earlier in this section for hours and admission.
The entire family may enjoy the comprehensive Museon Arlaten (29 rue
de la République; % 04-90-93-58-11), a museum of Provençal culture
(the name is in the Provençal language) founded in 1896 by Nobel
Prize–winner Frédéric Mistral. The large museum, staffed by costumed
docents, contains clothing, furniture, toys, ironworks, guns, farm equip-
ment, photos, paintings, pottery, musical instruments, and model ships.
Seek out the two 19th-century iron bikes (velocipedes) or the thrones for
Napoléon III and his empress, Eugénie (circa 1860). The Dodekatheion,
the ruins and statuary of a Roman temple, are in the central courtyard.
The museum is open daily (except Jan 1, May 1, Nov 1, and Dec 25) 
June through August 9:30 a.m. to 1 p.m. and 2 to 6:30 p.m.; April, May,
Part VI: Provence and the Riviera 
370

and September daily 9:30 a.m. to 12:30 p.m. and 2 to 6 p.m.; and October
through March daily 9:30 a.m. to 12:30 p.m. and 2 to 5 p.m. Admission is
4€ ($5.20) for adults and 3€ ($3.90) for students and children younger
than 18.
You have a long, dusty walk on major roadways and past a skateboard
park to get to the Musée de l’Arles Antiques (avenue de la 1ère Division
Française Libre; % 04-90-18-88-88; www.arles-antique.cg13.fr),
about half a mile from town, but it’s well worth it. This modern air-condi-
tioned museum contains the extraordinary archaeological finds of Arles
from prehistory to the 6th century, with a large collection of sculptures,
sarcophagi (elaborate tombs), and amphorae (double-handled jars), in
addition to scaled models of all of Arles’s Roman monuments, including
the extraordinary circus (currently being excavated next door) where
chariot races were held. Catwalks hover over ancient mosaics so that
you can see them in their entirety. The museum is open daily (except
Jan 1, May 1, Nov 1, and Dec 25): April to October 9 a.m. to 7 p.m. and
November 2 to March 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. Admission is 5.50€ ($7.15) for
adults and 4€ ($5.20) for students and children younger than 18.
Les Alyscamps (avenue des Alyscamps; % 04-90-49-36-87), an ancient
necropolis, is really a unique site and well worth the ten-minute walk
southeast of the city center. The area has been an inspiration to many
artists, including van Gogh, who described Les Alyscamps in a letter to
his brother, Theo; the text is reproduced at the site. Van Gogh and
Gauguin both painted Les Alyscamps several times. Alyscamps was used
as both a Roman burial site and an early Christian cemetery from the 4th
through 12th centuries. By the Middle Ages, 17 churches were here; now
all that remains are the ruins of one Romanesque chapel — St-Honorat.
During the Renaissance, royals, nobles, and even monks were in the
habit of giving away the most beautifully sculpted sarcophagi as gifts, so
only the plainest of stone coffins line this sacred path. See earlier in this
section for hours and admission.
In the 15th-century priory of St. Gilles (Knights of Malta), you can find the
Musée Réattu (10 rue du Grand-Prieuré; % 04-90-49-38-34), which fea-
tures the paintings of local artist Jacques Réattu, drawings by Picasso,
and a collection of 16th-century Flemish tapestries. The museum also
houses Henri Rousseau drawings of the region (including images of the
Arles arena), a collection of paintings by 19th- and 20th-century artists,
and temporary exhibits of photography. Hours are daily as follows:
November to February 1 to 6 p.m.; March to June and October 10 a.m. 
to noon and 2 to 6:30 p.m. and July to September 10 a.m. to 7 p.m.
If you haven’t had your fill of Roman ruins, here are two more: the
Thermes de Constantin and the Cryptoportique. The Thermes de
Constantin (rue Dominique-Maïsto next to the Rhône River) are the ruins
of a huge bathhouse and are all that remains of the Emperor Constantine’s
4th-century palace. The Cryptoportique (next to the Arlaten Museum) are
double underground galleries in the shape of a U dating from 30–20 B.C.
See earlier in this section for hours and admission.

Shopping for local treasures
A colorful market takes place Wednesdays 8 a.m. to 1 p.m. on boulevard
Emile-Combes and Saturdays 8 a.m. to 1 p.m. on boulevard des Lices. For
Provençal fabrics and gifts, head to Le Comptoir du Sud (2 rue Jean-
Jaurès; % 04-90-96-22-17), and Souleiado (4 bd. des Lices; % 04-90-
96-37-55).
Aix-en-Provence and the Cours Mirabeau
Writers and artists drawn to Aix-en-Provence have long heralded this
exquisite place, calling it the “Queen of Sweet Provence” and the “Athens
of Southern France.” This cosmopolitan city, founded in 122 B.C., is distin-
guished by its sculptured fountains, its golden-hued mansions, its regal
cours Mirabeau (and the town’s main boulevard), and the winding streets
of the old town. Its cafes are packed with students, and its markets over-
flow with colorful produce. These qualities are quintessentially Aix (pro-
nounced simply as “ex”). It’s a town rich with discoveries — every corner
you turn, you see an intriguing shop, a new restaurant, and a gurgling
fountain. Aix’s favorite painter is Paul Cézanne, who loved to paint the
countryside around Aix and whose last studio is just outside town.
Aix is also a major university town (the Université Aix-Marseille, founded
in the 15th century) and home to the famous Festival d’Aix-en-Provence
(% 04-42-17-34-34; www.festival-aix.com), a deluxe fête in July, fea-
turing classical music, opera, and ballet. Ancillary festivals and many
street musicians fill the town from late June to early August, so summer
is a fun time here. Because Aix doesn’t have the “must see” sights of
some other towns, you can relax into Provence time here and spend a
day or two wandering this lovely town that seems kissed by the sun.
Getting there
Two viable railway stations service Aix: the older, somewhat outmoded
station (Aix-Centre-Ville) in the heart of town, and a newer one, specifi-
cally designed for the TGV trains, in Vitroll, about 14km (9 miles) to the
west. Know in advance that if you’re coming from relatively long dis-
tances, including Paris, you’ll almost invariably arrive at Vitroll, from
which a bus — marked simply Compagnie Autocars de Provence —
departs every 30 minutes for the short ride, priced at 5.20€ ($6.75) each
way, to the center of Aix. Most trains arriving at Aix-Centre-Ville origi-
nate in other nearby towns of Provence, including Marseille. Most of 
the TGV trains from Paris travel directly from the Gare de Lyon to Aix,
making a stop, but no change of equipment, in Avignon. Other (non-TGV)
trains from Paris may or may not make several stops en route, including,
among others, in Marseille. Transit from Paris, depending on the route
and the train, takes between three and five hours, and costs around 96€
($125) each way.
Part VI: Provence and the Riviera

Saturday 6:30 a.m. to 7 p.m., and Sunday 6:15 a.m. to 12:30 p.m. and 1:30
to 6 p.m.
If driving to Aix from Avignon or other points north, take A7 south to
RN7 and follow it into town. From Marseille or other points to the south,
follow A51 north into town.
Getting around and getting information
Aix is a great town for strolling, so be sure to give yourself some free
time. Of special interest are the medieval walkways, such as passage
Agard off the east end of the cours Mirabeau.
You can rent a car at National Citer (Avignon train station; % 04-42-69-
06-63), Budget (Avignon train station; % 04-90-82-97-92), and Avis (11

Hôtel Cardinal
$
Mazarin
Natalie Bernard has owned this 18th-century town house for years, and
every year she renovates and restores several of the 29 units (23 rooms,
six suites). The restored rooms tend to be more exactingly decorated, but
all of the units, with fireplaces and cozy sitting areas, have a certain
bohemian charm and are larger than those in comparable hotels. The
suites contain kitchenettes. The Cardinal, across from the house where
writer M. F. K. Fisher lived in the 1950s, has been an address for writers
and artists for decades. The windows give you a view of this pretty resi-
dential area, where the aristocracy of Aix built their mansions. Just a few
blocks away is the cours Mirabeau.

Hôtel des Augustins
$–$$$
Vieil Aix
Because of its historic atmosphere (it occupies a 15th-century convent
that once hosted Martin Luther King), central location, and sound man-
agement, this hotel is a pricey favorite in Aix. It has been a hotel since 1892,
although it was fully restored in 1984. The careful restoration kept many
historic details, such as the stone walls and vaulting, stained glass, and
wood paneling. The 29 rooms are spacious and soundproof — crucial for
this busy part of town — and come with minibars; some have Jacuzzis and
terraces. The décor is Provençal, with colorful bedspreads, curtains, and
wallpapers. The hotel offers views of the rooftops of Aix and the famous
cours Mirabeau.

Hôtel des Quatre Dauphins
$
Mazarin
A charming small hotel in the quiet residential Mazarin district, Quatre
Dauphins is a solid choice. This hotel is named after one of Aix’s most
memorable fountains, located nearby, which has water cascading from the
mouths of four finely carved dolphins. Set on a quiet street, the hotel is a
short walk from the train station and cours Mirabeau. The 13 rooms, some
on the small side, are decorated in a contemporary style with Provençal
fabrics; all have minibars.

Vieil Aix
This hotel is a real value considering you’re staying in a 14th-century clois-
ter on a quiet street in the heart of the old town, near rue Tanneurs — a
street lined with a large number of inexpensive restaurants. The 40 rooms
are attractive and decorated with contemporary or antique furniture. The
rooms have high ceilings (some with beams); ancient vaulting is evident
throughout the hotel. Most accommodations look out on the quiet interior
garden courtyard. The staff is exceedingly friendly.

See map p. 375. 8 rue d’Entrecasteaux. % 04-42-26-27-20. Fax: 04-42-27-17-97. www.

Breakfast: 7€ ($9.10). AE, DC, MC, V.
Dining locally
Aix is a great restaurant town, with lots of ethnic choices — along with
the typical mouth-watering Provençal cuisine. On place Ramus in the
old town, you can find Cuban, Thai, Japanese, Senegalese, and Chinese
restaurants. Other good restaurant streets are rue de la Verrerie and
rue des Tanneurs. Aix is also an idyllic town for cafe-lingering. The king
of all cafes is Les Deux Garçons (53 cours Mirabeau; % 04-42-26-00-51).
You can sit outside and people-watch along the avenue, but don’t forget
to check out the beaux-arts interior of this classic establishment.
Chez Maxime
$–$$
Vieil Aix
PROVENÇAL
This long-running hit with locals and visitors alike is set on bustling place
Ramus. Most people sit on the square, but the inside is attractive and 
cozy — especially the tables by the front windows. This restaurant spe-
cializes in meats, thickly sliced and prepared with Provençal herbs. A
popular main course is terrine de légumes rôti au provençal (vegetable ter-
rine that’s served with tapenade, an olive paste that’s a regional specialty).
The best main courses are the pavé d’agneau aux herbes provençal (lamb
with fresh herbs) and pavé de boeuf à la fondue de foie gras et au cêpes
(beef served with foie gras and white mushrooms). For dessert, look no
farther than the parfait glacé au fruit confit (ice cream parfait with fruit).
See map p. 375. 12 place Ramus (a couple blocks north of cours Mirabeau). % 04-
42-26-28-51. Reservations recommended. Main courses: 9.70€ ($13) prix fixe: 12€
($16) lunch, 15€–30€ ($20–$39) dinner. MC, V. Open: Tues–Sat noon–2 p.m.; Mon–Sat
7–10 p.m. Closed mid- to late Jan.
Le Clos de la Violette
$$$$
Northern Aix
PROVENÇAL
This restaurant, located on the northern edge of town, is Aix’s best. To get
here from the center of town, you can take a long walk or a short taxi ride.
In this cozy yet elegant setting, you can sample innovative cuisine. The
menu changes depending on the season and best market fare. Two of the
chef’s favorites are the queues de langoustines rôti ravioli fourré au corail
(roast langoustine tails with ravioli stuffed with shellfish eggsack) and
carré d’agneau rôti en croûte au chevre frais et champignons (roast rack of
lamb with a pastry of goat cheese and mushrooms). For dessert, you may
choose a platter of cookies such as the gros calissons d’Aix (large almond-
paste cookies) or biscuit friable aux noisettes et brousse battue à la vanille,
aux longs copeaux de chocolat (vanilla-nut cookies with chocolate shav-
ings). The complete wine list boasts unusual and special selections from
exclusive small wineries in the region.

Le Refuge
$–$$
Vieil Aix
SMOKED MEAT AND FISH
Although Le Refuge is a specialized place, if you like smoked salmon
and/or smoked duck, you’ll be in heaven. Most of the seating is on hip
place des Cardeurs, and the setting inside the tiny restaurant is après-ski,
with snowshoes hanging on the wood-paneled walls. As the cheerful waiter
explained to me, “We are in a mountain cabin.” Whatever. The menu is very
limited, but what they do, they do well. You choose from prix fixe menus
that include salad, main course, dessert, and a glass of wine. Basically, you
have a choice among salmon, lobster, and duck, mostly smoked. The duck
also comes barbecued, and there’s homemade foie gras, too. The meals
are served with fries, salad, creamy homemade coleslaw, and a cup of hot
mulled wine. Jazz and blues play on the tape box, and the atmosphere is
very relaxed and fun.
See map p. 375. 13 place des Cardeurs. % 04-42-96-17-23. Reservations recom-
mended. Main courses: 10€–24€ ($13–$31). MC, V. Open: Tues–Sat noon–2 p.m. and
7:30–11:30 p.m., July–Aug daily 7:30–11:30 p.m.
Yoji
$$–$$$
south of Cours Mirabeau
JAPANESE
Yoji is the best Japanese restaurant in Aix — an excellent alternative for
those looking to escape from French cuisine for a night. Although the
restaurant is on busy avenue Victor-Hugo, the dining room has a calm
aura, with a sleek décor and low lighting. It serves authentic Japanese and
Korean cuisines, including enticing combinations of sushi and sashimi that
are reasonably priced.
See map p. 375. 7 av. Victor-Hugo. % 04-42-38-48-76. Reservations recommended.

Mon–Sat 7–11 p.m. and Tues–Sat noon–2 p.m.
Exploring the town
The recently renovated cours Mirabeau, a gorgeous wide boulevard lined
with lush 150-year-old plane trees, is the main intersection of town. Cafes,
shops, and hotels line the north side of the street, while 18th-century
mansions stand on the south side. The boulevard is bookended by two
huge fountains. The 1860 Fontaine de la Rotonde, on the west end of
the street, has statues representing Justice (facing cours Mirabeau),
Agriculture (facing Marseille), and Fine Arts (facing Avignon). On the
east end of the street, the 19th-century Fontaine du Roi René shows the
medieval King René (who brought the Muscat grape to Provence) with a
bunch of grapes in his hand. Also on the cours Mirabeau are the 1691
Chapter 18: The Best of Provence 377

Fontaine des Neuf Canons, displaying nine cannons, and the 1734
Fontaine d’Eau Chaude, which, it is said, is fed by thermal sources.
The neighborhood south of the cours Mirabeau is the quartier Mazarin,
designed in the 17th century with streets in a grid pattern. It’s where the
aristocracy of Aix lived. Walk down rue 4 Septembre to see place des
Quatre Dauphins, with its whimsical dolphin fountain. On the way, you
pass the Musée Paul-Arbaud, displaying faïence. A left at the fountain
down rue Cardinale brings you to the Eglise St-Jean-de-Malte, a fortified
12th-century Gothic church, and the Musée Granet, with works by
Cézanne and other artists upstairs, and Roman excavations, including
mosaics and statuary, in the basement. North of cours Mirabeau is Vieil
Aix, the old town, with its maze of semipedestrian streets and large
squares. Take spooky passage Agard at the east end of cours Mirabeau
to reach the 19th-century Palais de Justice on place de Verdun, where
the flea market is held three times a week. Two blocks north and 1 block
west is the 18th-century Ancienne Halle aux Grains (the old Corn
Exchange, now a post office) on place Richelme, where a fruit-and-
vegetable market is open every morning on the square. Two blocks up
rue Gaston de la Saporta is the Musée du Vieil Aix, displaying a history
of the town. Place de l’Archevêché is where you find the 17th-century
Palais de l’Archevêché, a grand residence where the prestigious music
festival called Festival International d’Art Lyrique (% 04-42-17-34-34;
www.festival-aix.com) is held every year in July. On the first floor of
the palace is a Musée des Tapisseries displaying beautiful tapestries.
Just beyond is the Cathédrale St-Sauveur, unique because it contains
architectural styles from the 5th through 17th centuries.
The tourist office runs a free two-hour walking tour (in English) of the
city from mid-October to mid-May on Wednesday and Saturday at 10 a.m.;
mid-May to mid-October Wednesday, Thursday, and Saturday at 10 a.m.
and Tuesday at 8:30 p.m. Theme tours of Aix (literature, architecture,
Cézanne, Zola, fountains, history) are given on other days depending on
the time of year. Check with the tourist office at % 04-42-16-11-61. The
office also organizes full-day and half-day tours of the region costing 26€
to 55€ ($34–$72). Among the tours are Lavender Roads, Marseille, Les
Baux and St-Rémy, Arles, and Cassis and its deep rocky inlets.
If you want to follow in the footsteps of painter Paul Cézanne, who was
born and who died in Aix, walk along the Circuit de Cézanne; the side-
walk markers bearing his name begin at the tourist office. The walk high-
lights the places Cézanne used to frequent, the school where he studied,
images he painted, and the shop where his father worked. The tourist
office has a free accompanying brochure called “In the Footsteps of Paul
Cézanne.” Another choice is driving or walking the route de Cézanne
along D17 (Route de Tholonet), which leaves Aix from the southeast 
and travels for about 6km (4 miles) toward Mont St-Victoire (Cézanne’s
favorite peak). The route shows images that Cézanne painted and places
where he used to set up his easel.
Part VI: Provence and the Riviera 
378

Paul Cézanne was an artists’ artist. At the Atelier de Cézanne (9 av.
Paul-Cézanne; % 04-42-21-06-53), about a mile north of town, you’re
likely to encounter artists making the pilgrimage to see the painter’s
milieu, motifs, and the views of the countryside he painted continuously.
Cézanne’s last studio was built on a hill outside Aix, in 1901, in full view
of Mont St-Victoire — one of his favorite subjects. In 1906, Cézanne died
of pleurisy contracted while painting outdoors. The studio is set up as
though Cézanne had just stepped out — with paints, a glass of wine, and
a pipe perched near an easel. It’s a place to “witness the unfolding of his
sensations,” according the curator of the space. The studio is open daily
(except Jan 1, May 1, and Dec 25): April through May 10 a.m. to noon and
2 to 6 p.m., July to September 10 a.m. to 7 p.m., and October to March 
10 a.m. to noon and 2 to 5 p.m. Admission is 5.50€ ($7.15) for adults 
and 2€ ($2.60) for students and children. To get here, take the no. 1 bus,
leaving from La Rotonde (place Général-de-Gaulle) in Aix every 20 min-
utes, to stop Cézanne.
Located on the first floor of the grand Archbishop’s Palace, Musée des
Tapisseries (28 place des Martyrs de la Résistance; % 04-42-23-09-91)
contains a rich collection of textiles from the 17th and 18th centuries.
Highlights are “The Grotesque,” a 17th-century theatrical series depict-
ing musicians, dancers, and animals, and “The History of Don Quixote,”
a series of ten works showing scenes from the Cervantes story. The con-
temporary art section displays colorful abstract and figurative tapes-
tries by living artists. It’s open Wednesday to Monday 10 a.m. to 6 p.m.
(closed Jan 1, May 1, and Dec 25). Admission is 2.50€ ($3.25) for adults
and free for students and children.
Set in the 18th-century Hôtel d’Estienne de St-Jean, the Musée du Vieil
Aix (17 rue Gaston-Saporta; % 04-42-21-43-55) displays a mildly inter-
esting collection of ephemera relating to Aix, including early maps and a
large collection of santons — the folklore doll figures popular in Provence.
It’s open Tuesday to Sunday April through September 10 a.m. to noon
and 2:30 to 6 p.m. and October through March 10 a.m. to noon and 2 to 
5 p.m. Admission is 4€ ($5.20) for adults and 2.50€ ($3.25) for students
and children, and free for children 14 and younger.
Many people head to the Musée Granet (place St-Jean-de-Malte; % 04-
42-52-87-80), which occupies a 17th-century Knights of Malta palace, to
see the only Cézanne works in town. The museum also has an interesting
collection of 18th- and 19th-century paintings, including works by Van
Dyck, David, Delacroix, and Ingres, and many paintings by its namesake,
the academic Provençal painter François Marius Granet. In the basement
is perhaps the most interesting part of the museum: archaeological finds
from the area, including glorious Roman statues and mosaics. It’s open
daily 9 a.m. to 7 p.m., and 11 p.m. on Thursdays. Admission is 12€ ($15)
for adults and free for students and children up to age 5.
Fans of faïence, locally made hand-painted pottery, should head to the
quartier Mazarin to check out the Musée Paul-Arbaud (2 rue du 4
Septembre; % 04-42-38-38-95). This 18th-century mansion houses an
Chapter 18: The Best of Provence 379

interesting collection of Provençal earthenware, paintings, illuminated
manuscripts, and other rare books. The museum is open Monday to
Saturday 2 to 5 p.m. (closed Jan). Admission is 3€ ($3.90) for adults and
1.50€ ($1.95) for students and children.
Shopping for local treasures
Aix offers the best markets in the region. Place Richelme is filled with 
a fruit-and-vegetable market every morning; go here to buy the exqui-
site products of Provence, such as olives, lavender, local cheeses, and
fresh produce. A flower market is at place des Prêcheurs on Monday,
Wednesday, Friday, and Sunday mornings, and on Tuesday, Thursday,
and Saturday mornings it’s at place de l’Hôtel-de-Ville. The fish market is
open Monday, Wednesday, and Friday mornings on place Richelrue.
Good shops to visit include La Cure Gourmande (16 rue Vauvemarques;
% 04-42-21-26-48), which stocks classic Provence sweets, such as
provençaux biscuits (Provence cookies), artisanaux chocolats (handmade
chocolates), calissons d’Aix (almond-paste cookies), caramels à l’anci-
enne (old-fashioned caramels), and confiseries traditionelles (traditional
sweets). Another excellent candy shop is Calissons du Roy René (rue
Clemenceau; % 04-42-26-67-86), specializing in calissons — those
yummy almond-paste sweets. And Papiers Plumes (8 rue Papassaudi; 
% 04-42-27-74-56) is a stationery shop selling papers, pens, and stylish
notebooks.
Living it up after dark
A student town, Aix is lively at night. You may see roving groups of
young people looking for the nearest hot spot. Forum des Cardeurs, a
bustling square in the center of Old Aix, has a high concentration of bars
attracting students and 30-somethings. Le Scat (11 rue de la Verrerie; 
% 04-42-23-00-23) is a good jazz club with a 13€ ($17) cover. Also, the
dance club Le Mistral (3 rue Mistral; % 04-42-38-16-49) imposes a 15€
to 18€ ($20–$23) cover. Musicians entertain strollers on summer
evenings — look for them on the cours Mirabeau and place d’Albertas
west of the Palais de Justice in the old town.
Marseille: Crime and Bouillabaisse
Most people steer clear of Marseille because of its reputation as a
seething haven of iniquity. Alas, this city’s bad reputation, which has
existed for at least 2,000 years, is highly deserved. Visitors tend to be
those looking for drugs and/or sex, or young people into adventure-type
tourism — where they go to dangerous places and look for trouble.
They’ll probably find it in Marseille, its streets crawling with shady 
characters. It’s all a shame, really, because some interesting historic
sites are here.
Part VI: Provence and the Riviera 
380

If you’re determined to brave Marseille, you need to be on guard at all
times. Tourism literature claims that Marseille (like Naples in Italy) is
experiencing a renaissance and has improved much over the last few
years. To some extent, this is true, but do keep your guard up.
Marseille is both an ancient city and a thoroughly modern one — a cos-
mopolitan center and a huge metropolis of a million residents. The city’s
center is the Vieux Port, the old port claimed by Greek sailors in 600 B.C.
Romans took over in 49 B.C. Staunchly independent, Marseille didn’t
become a part of France until 1660. The Black Plague in 1770 decimated
the population, but by 1792, residents rose to prominence when they
marched into Paris singing what’s now called La Marseillaise (the French
national anthem). Today, Marseille is looking boldly into the future while
planning the celebration of its 26th centennial.
Marseille is a town of intriguing religious pilgrimage festivals. Here are
the major dates and locations: February 2 at St-Victor, June 18 at Sacré-
Coeur, August 15 at Notre-Dame de la Garde, and September 8 at Notre-
Dame de Galine. Pastoral festivals take place from the end of December
to the end of January.
Getting there
The grand Gare St-Charles train station (place Victor-Hugo; % 08-92-
35-35-39 or 3635 within France; www.sncf.com) is at the top of a huge
stone staircase. If you have a lot of luggage, it’s best to take a cab to
your hotel. The information and ticket windows are on the lower level of
the station. Ten to twelve fast TGVs travel from Paris to Marseille each
day, costing 75€ to 127€ ($978–$165). Trip time from Paris (Gare de
Lyon) to Marseille is three hours. Hourly trains to Nice take two-and-a-
half hours and cost 27€ to 30€ ($35–$39). Trains also go to Avignon 
(40 minutes, 21€ to 25€/$27–$33) and Aix (30 minutes, 6.40€/$8.30).
If you’re walking from the train station, go down the huge staircase and
walk straight on boulevard d’Athènes to the McDonald’s. Then take a
right onto La Canebière, which leads to the old port, the location of the
largest concentration of hotels, restaurants, and shops, as well as the
tourist office. It’s a ten-minute walk.
Aéroport Marseille-Provence (% 04-42-14-14-14; www.marseille.
aeroport.fr), is 28km (171⁄2 miles) northwest of the city. A shuttle bus
(8.50€/$11) between the airport and the Gare St-Charles departs every
20 minutes daily from 6 a.m. to 10 p.m. (later if late flights come in). You
can buy tickets at the ticket office in the airport between terminals 1 and
2. For information, call % 04-42-14-31-27. The shuttle bus leaves the
Gare St-Charles for the airport every 20 minutes daily 5:30 a.m. to 
9:50 p.m.
Gare des Autocars (bus station) is on place Victor-Hugo (% 08-91-02-
40-25). The station has frequent buses to Aix (40 minutes, 4.40€/$5.70),
Chapter 18: The Best of Provence 381

Avignon (one hour, 18€/$23), Cannes (two-and-a-half hours, 24€/$31),
and Nice (three hours, 25€/$33).
If you’re driving from Paris, follow A6 south to Lyon, then continue
south along A7 to Marseille. The drive takes about seven hours. From
towns in Provence, take A7 south to Marseille.
Don’t plan on bringing a car to Marseille; it’ll likely be broken into or
stolen. Your best bet is to take the train into town and rely on public
transportation.
Getting around and getting information
This town is one where you feel practically obligated to rely on the tourist
train (see “Exploring the city” later in this section) because walking
around Marseille isn’t that safe, and the attractions are quite spread out.
You can also take local buses and subways. Information and maps for 
the public transportation system are available at Espace Info (6 rue des
Fabres; % 04-91-91-92-10). Tickets for the bus and subway system, avail-
able at the tourist office, are 1.70€ ($2.20); day passes are 4.50€ ($5.85).
Two rental-car agencies near the train station are Europcar (Square
Nourvik; % 04-91-50-12-76) and Thrifty (8 bd. Voltaire; % 04-91-95-
00-00). For a cab, call Radio Marseille Taxi at % 04-91-02-20-20, Taxi
Blanc Bleu at % 04-91-51-50-00, or Radio Taxi France at % 04-91-05-
80-80.
The tourist office is at 4 La Canebière (% 04-91-13-89-00; Fax: 04-91-13-
89-20; www.marseille-tourisme.com). It’s open year-round Monday to
Saturday 9 a.m. to 7 p.m. and Sunday and holidays 10 a.m. to 7 p.m. This
large office has a souvenir shop, runs guided tours, and sells bus and
Métro passes. To check or send e-mail, head to Info Web Café (1 quai 
de Rive-Neuve; % 04-91-33-74-98), a hip cafe/bar on the north side of
the old port; it’s open Monday to Saturday 9 a.m. to 7 p.m. and Sunday
2:30 to 7:30 p.m.
Spending the night

“Marseille” map.
Hôtel Kyriad
$
Old Port
The least expensive of the many standard hotels on the old port, the
Kyriad formerly was part of the Climat franchise, so the rooms still have
a chain-hotel quality. The location is good — on the border of the old port
and the historic center of Marseille. The 49 rooms have radios and hair
dryers, and the hotel also has a bar.

Hôtel Petit Nice
$$–$$$$
7e Arrondissement
This Relais & Châteaux member is the top lodging choice. The Passédat
family has turned two Greek villas on the coast into a luxurious destination
and an oasis of tranquility in hectic Marseille. The 13 light and airy rooms
are all individually decorated in a modern style with deluxe amenities. The
hotel has a large pool and a terrace where meals are served in good
weather. Gérald Passédat runs the kitchen — the best in Marseille — and
serves specialties from the region. Diners have views of the coast.

Mercure Beauvau Vieux Port
$$–$$$$
Old Port
This classic hotel, part of the Mercure chain, has undergone a renovation
to restore some of its former grandeur. Most of the 73 rooms open onto
port views, and some contain balconies. All have large windows that let in
lots of light and air. The lobby is attractively decorated with antiques and
oriental rugs.

New Hotel Vieux-Port
$$
Old Port
Part of the New Hotel chain, this high-rise has 42 rooms — most with ter-
races overlooking the old port. The terraces are shared by several rooms.
The room décor is uninspired and generic, with stucco walls and maybe a
tired print or tourist poster; some units are quite large, with high ceilings.
All accommodations have minibars and hair dryers. The hotel is in a busy
part of town, but the soundproof windows make the rooms fairly quiet. A
large buffet breakfast is served in the breakfast room (with port views).

Dining locally
Marseille is the birthplace of bouillabaisse. The city’s pride in this clas-
sic fish stew has necessitated the bouillabaisse contract — a guarantee
of quality and authenticity that many chefs who make the soup have
signed. The other famous dish here is pieds et paquets (literally, “feet and
packages”). To make this dish, small squares of lamb stomach are rolled
into packets; garnished with bacon, garlic, and parsley with lamb “trot-
ters” (feet); and cooked in a sauce of white wine and tomatoes.
Part VI: Provence and the Riviera 
384

Le Miramar
$$$–$$$$
Old Port
PROVENÇAL
This restaurant is the best in Marseille. Le Miramar is set on the north side
of the old port, with views of the hilltop Notre-Dame de la Garde. Prepare
for a hearty meal, especially if you order the restaurant’s special bouilla-
baisse, which comes in two courses and is exquisitely prepared with fresh
herbs and fish. The restaurant also has succulent lobster preparations,
including the fricassée de homard (lobster stewed Provençal-style with
fresh herbs).
See map p. 383. 12 quai du Port. % 04-91-91-10-40. Reservations necessary. Main
courses: 31€–48€ ($40–$62); bouillabaisse 55€ ($72). AE, DC, MC, V. Open: Tues–Sat
noon–2:30 p.m. and 7–9:30 p.m.
Les Mets de Provence, Maurice Brun
$$$–$$$$
Old Port
PROVENÇAL
At this family-run dining spot, a meal is still an event that takes up the
better part of the day — the entire day, if digestion is included — so don’t
plan on rushing through a meal here. The basic five-course menu includes
a platter of grilled fish prepared Provençal style, as well as a serving of
chicken or other meat with seasonal vegetables, a cheese course, and
dessert.
See map p. 383. 18 quai de Rive-Neuve, 2nd Floor. % 04-91-33-35-38. Reservations
necessary. Prix fixe: 40€ ($52) lunch, 60€ ($78) dinner. MC, V. Open: Tues–Fri 
noon–1 p.m.; Mon–Sat 8–10 p.m. Closed Aug 10–24.
L’Oliveraie
$$
Old Port
PROVENÇAL
You can expect a warm welcome here. The waitstaff is happy to recom-
mend or explain dishes. L’Oliveraie is a busy place, and the atmosphere
can be somewhat frantic, but diners usually enjoy sitting by the window
and watching the strollers on the busy square. All the specialties of the
region are offered, and so is bistro fare. Good choices are any of the
regional fish dishes like baked cod or grilled red mullet, served with
market fresh vegetables and herbs. The reasonably priced wine list fea-
tures wines of the region.
See map p. 383. 10 place aux Huiles. % 04-91-33-34-41. Reservations recommended.
Prix fixe: 14€ ($18) lunch, 24€ ($31) dinner. MC, V. Open: Mon–Fri noon–2:30 p.m.;
Mon–Sat 7:30–11 p.m.
Une Table, au Sud
$$–$$$
Marseille
PROVENÇAL
Some of the most creative cuisine in Marseille is served one floor above
street level, within a south-facing, hypermodern dining room whose win-
dows encompass views of the Old Port. You’ll recognize the historically
important 19th-century building in which it’s located because of the
Chapter 18: The Best of Provence 385

sculpted lion heads that embellish its facade. Lionel Levy (chef de cuisine)
and his wife, Florence (maître d’hotel), are the creative forces here, serv-
ing cuisine that changes daily according to the ingredients available at the
local markets. The best menu items we’ve seen include rack of Provençal
lamb stuffed with white beans and a confit of lemons; mullet served with
a saffron and herb risotto; and a succulent version of roasted squab whose
juices are flavored with Arabica coffee. Your meal may begin with an octo-
pus artfully layered with grilled fennel and Nyon olives. Desserts may
include, depending on the mood of the chef, a pineapple dacquoise served
with vanilla-flavored whipped cream.
See map p. 383. 1 quai du Port. % 04-91-90-63-53. Reservations recommended. Main
courses: 35€–45€ ($46–$59); prix fixe: 48€–88€ ($62–$114). AE, MC, V. Open:
Tues–Sat noon–1:30 p.m. and 7:30–10 p.m. Closed Aug.
Exploring the city
Like Paris, Marseille is divided into arrondissements (Marseille has 16).
La Canebière, nicknamed Can o’ Beer by World War II GIs, is the main
intersection, leading to the old port with its many hotels and restau-
rants. Just east of the old port is the huge covered shopping mall Centre
Bourse. The streets you find a block in from the port on the port’s south
side are lined with restaurants with outdoor terraces. The old quarter,
called Panier, is on the north side of the port.
Petit Train de la Bonne Mère (tourist train) makes two circuits around
town. January to November, train no. 1 makes a 50-minute round-trip to
Notre-Dame de la Garde via the old port and the St-Victor Abbey. Easter
through October, train no. 2 makes a 40-minute round-trip of old
Marseille via the cathedral, Vieille Charité, and the Quartier du Panier.
The trains depart from quai des Belges and cost 5€ ($6.50) for adults
and 3€ ($3.90) for children for one trip, or 10€ ($13) for adults and 6€
($7.80) for children for both trips. For details, call % 04-91-25-24-69.
The tourist office can arrange a taxi tour for two-and-a-half hours
(66€/$86). A taxi tour is a great way for three adults, or two adults and
two children, to see the major sights.
Exercise caution in Marseille, and follow these safety tips: Stay near the
old port; travel in groups of at least two if possible; avoid deserted
streets; avoid the Panier district at night; and take taxis to tourist 
destinations.
Just 4.8km (3 miles) from the port of Marseille, the small rocky island of
If (pronounced eef) contains an imposing fortress prison, the Château
d’If (% 04-91-59-02-30). François I built this fortress off the coast in
1524. The fortress became a prison soon after it was built. The prison
has harbored many unfortunate souls — many jailed on political and
religious grounds. Château d’If has become especially famous for the fic-
tional prisoner, the Count of Monte Cristo, from the novel by Alexandre
Dumas. Depending on the weather, the château is open daily (except 
Part VI: Provence and the Riviera 
386

Jan 1 and Dec 25) April to August 9:30 a.m. to 6:30 p.m. and September 
to March 9:30 a.m. to 5:30 p.m. Admission is 5€ 5($6.50) for adults, 3.50€
($4.55) for children. You can get to the château by taking a 20-minute
boat ride that departs from the quai des Belges. Round-trip fare is 
10€ ($13).
The basilica Notre-Dame de la Garde (% 04-91-13-40-80) was con-
structed on the highest point in the city in 1853. With its strategic loca-
tion, the site always has been a lookout post, fortification, and a place of
worship all rolled into one. It’s also a popular pilgrimage site. The church
is Romanesque Byzantine style, with domes; multicolored stripes of stone;
and lots of gilding, marble, and mosaics. The lower church features the
vaulted crypts; the upper church houses the sanctuary. You can find
panoramic views of the city from the garden in front of the church. It’s
open daily: May to October 7 a.m. to 8 p.m. and November to April 7 a.m.
to 7 p.m. Admission is free. Café Lo Vive is on the premises for snacks. To
get to Notre-Dame de la Garde, take bus no. 60 or the tourist train (see ear-
lier in this section), or walk through the Jardin de la Colonne at the top of
the cours Pierre-Puget (about a half-hour walk).
Shopping for local treasures
Here’s a sampling of the best markets in Marseille (unless indicated,
they’re open Mon–Sat): The Capucins Market on place des Capucins is
open daily 8 a.m. to 7 p.m. This market has fruit, herbs, fish, and food
products. Quai des Belges is a fish market on the old port, open daily 
8 a.m. to 1 p.m. Allées de Meilhan on La Canebière is where you can
find flowers on Tuesday and Saturday 8:30 a.m. to 1 p.m.; it has vendors
selling santons daily from the last Sunday in November to December 31 
8 a.m. to 7 p.m. On cours Julien near Notre-Dame du Mont, you’ll find a
market with fruits, vegetables, and other foods.
Marseille is the place to buy santons — clay Nativity figurines that are
popular throughout Provence. The elaborately decorated figurines,
many of which are villagers outfitted for the common trades and profes-
sions of the Middle Ages, are highly collectible. You’ll find countless
stores along La Canebière selling these colorful dolls. Another good
santon store is Ateliers Marcel Carbonel, 47 rue Neuve-Sainte-Catherine
(% 04-91-54-26-58), near the old port. You can also find a famous soap
made in Marseille, which is stamped with the city’s name. The soap is
sold in all the city’s large department stores, in the Centre Bourse, or at
La Savonnerie du Sérial (50 bd. Anatole de la Forge; % 04-91-98-28-25).
Living it up after dark
A good late-night cafe/bar near the old port is Pêle Mêle (8 place Aux
Huiles; % 04-91-54-85-26). A popular and reasonably safe disco is Café
de la Plage in Escale Borély, a mall on avenue Mendès-France (% 04-91-
71-21-76).

Chapter 19
Introducing the Riviera
In This Chapter
 Discovering the Riviera’s major destinations
 Getting to the French Riviera
 Finding other Riviera gems
B
esides Paris, France’s most popular draw for visitors is the French
Riviera, known as Côte d’Azur. And it’s no wonder. Sophisticated
resorts lined along the Azure Coast boast top-notch amenities and cul-
tural activities, and miles of warm-water beaches beckon sun worshipers
of all ages. In fact, these chic seaside towns and charming hillside vil-
lages have been attracting sunbathers, socialites, and artists for more
than a century. Artists have left their legacy in the many top-notch
museums focusing on 20th-century works and featuring artists such as
Picasso, Matisse, Léger, Chagall, and Renoir. With so much to see and do
on the Riviera, you can easily spend two weeks here — and we set out to
provide you the basics in the next two chapters.
For the Eastern Riviera, you can make Nice your base, taking day trips to
nearby attractions, including hill towns such as St-Paul-de-Vence or even
the Principality of Monaco. The easiest way to do this is rent a car that
you can drive from village to village along the coast or explore hill town
to hill town in the hinterlands.
For exploring the Western Riviera, the best bases are the resorts of
Cannes or St-Tropez. The drawback, however, is that neither resort is
centrally located; St-Tropez lies in the far western corner of the Riviera,
and Cannes is in the east. St-Tropez is almost a destination unto itself.
Anchor here to enjoy its hedonistic lifestyle. If touring is part of your
plan, then base in Cannes. From Cannes, you can visit offshore islands,
St-Paul-de-Vence or Vence, or the port of Antibes of Picasso fame.
What’s Where: The French Riviera 
and Its Major Attractions
The Riviera occupies the southeast corner of the country, near where
France meets the border of Italy. This section offers you just a brief taste

of what you find in this region, which is shown in the nearby map, “The
French Riviera.”
 Antibes: A lively town between Nice and Cannes, Antibes is a yacht-
ing base, with two major summer events: Les Voiles d’Antibes in
June and the Antibes Cup in July. South of Antibes at the tip of a
peninsula is Cap d’Antibes, an exclusive beach area with private
estates and fancy hotels. See Chapter 21.
 Beaulieu: Nestled into a coastal inlet between Nice and Monaco,
this village is a luxe beach resort with some welcoming lodging
alternatives to some of the busier destinations. See Chapter 20.
 Biot: Famous for crafts such as glass-blowing and pottery, this tiny
inland village west of Nice also features a museum devoted to the
cubist Ferdinand Léger. See Chapter 21.
 Cannes: To the west of Nice, Cannes also is a place to avoid during
its famous annual Film Festival. Visit the flamboyant Cannes at
other times of the year, however, for shopping, sun-worshipping,
strutting your stuff, and exploring the city’s historic Le Suquet (Old
Town). See Chapter 21.
 Monaco: East of Nice, this glamorous principality occupies a small
slice of mountainous coastline close to the Italian border. A tiny
country, actually, it may be best known for cars (the Monaco Grand
Prix takes place in May) and casinos and for a “once-upon-a-time”
princess named Grace. See Chapter 20.
 Nice: The Riviera’s capital city, Nice also is the gateway to the
Riviera. Most transportation to this area makes its way through
Nice. A multifaceted seaside city, Nice is a good choice if you’re
looking for a base location from which to explore the Eastern
Riviera. Nice is a premier destination for art aficionados, with
nearly 20 galleries and museums. See Chapter 20.
 St-Jean-Cap-Ferrat: An exclusive peninsula south of Beaulieu that’s
really a small fishing port, St-Jean-Cap-Ferrat is the home of the
grandest of the grand hotels in the Riviera: Grand Hôtel du Cap-
Ferrat. See Chapter 20.
 St-Paul-de-Vence: A pedestrian-only village built on a steep rock,
this village is much more touristy than its neighbor Vence, but
worth a stop if for nothing else than the Fondation Maeght, one of
the best modern art museums in France. See Chapter 21.
 St-Tropez: The most famous village on the Riviera, this beach and
sun mecca is for anyone in search of the hectic heart and sassy
soul of this region. See Chapter 21.
 Vence: This circular cobblestone village is best known for the
Chapelle du Rosaire, designed in 1949 by Henri Matisse. See
Chapter 21.

Getting there
To get to the Riviera, you can catch one of the frequent daily flights from
Paris to Marseille (see Chapter 18) or Nice (see Chapter 20), or hop on
one of the fast TGV trains leaving several times daily from Paris’s Gare
de Lyon to Marseille (three-and-a-half hours), to Cannes (five-and-three-
quarter hours — requires a change in Toulon), and to Nice (six-and-a-
quarter hours — requires a change in Toulon).
You also can reach the region through Marseille, renting a car after arriv-
ing by air from Paris or by train from Paris’s Gare de Lyon. Getting from
Marseille to Nice (190km/118 miles) takes you about three hours, depend-
ing on traffic. See Chapter 18 for details about getting to Marseille.
Pokey regional trains run along the coast from Marseille all the way to
Italy, making stops at St-Raphaël (where you can take boats to St-Tropez

from the village), Nice, Beaulieu, and Monaco, and a dozen other towns.
For details on getting to each town on the Riviera, see the individual
town sections in Chapters 20 and 21.
When taking trains and buses on the Riviera, sit on the right side if
you’re going east and on the left side if you’re heading west to better
take in the panoramic coastal view.

Searching for Some Other Riviera Gems
If you happen to have some extra time and a deep interest in this region,
the Riviera has additional intriguing places you can visit.
 Grasse: This town, 23km (14.5 miles) from Antibes, is called the
“Perfumed Balcony of the Riviera” for good reason: It’s the center
of the region’s perfume business. Three factories are open for tours
(Molinard, Gallard, and Fragonard, named after painter François
Fragonard, who was born in Grasse), and 70 others operate in
town. An old city surrounded by ramparts, Grasse is a bustling
place, with 45,000 residents and a 12th-century cathedral boasting
a painting by Rubens.
 La Napoule-Plage: This secluded resort (8km/5 miles from Cannes)
has a beige sandy beach. Also here is the Musée Henry Clews
(% 04-93-49-95-05; www.chateau-lanapoule.com), with collec-
tions and works of an eccentric American sculptor who died in 1937.
 Menton: Very close to the border of Italy, Menton (8km/5 miles
from Monaco) enjoys more sunshine than any other town on the
Riviera. Menton has pretty — though very crowded — beaches,
and the old town close to the shore is charming with cobbled wind-
ing streets and intriguing boutiques. Musée Jean-Cocteau (% 04-
93-57-72-30) features works and memorabilia of the artist. Menton
is particularly popular with retirees, who have apartments in many
of the large residential hotels lining the shore.
Part VI: Provence and the Riviera 
392
Sampling the region’s cuisine: 
French meets Italian
The Riviera’s cuisine is certainly one of the high points of a visit. Here you can dine on
classic French fare prepared in the light and flavorful Provençal manner, with liberal
use of olives and olive oil. You can also find authentic Italian cuisine — you can’t go
wrong by making a beeline to any restaurant advertising pate fraîche (fresh home-
made pasta).
As befits such a sophisticated region, many towns on the Riviera boast a range of good
ethnic restaurants, including Asian and African cuisines. And it’s no coincidence that
the birthplace of the thong offers the best selection of vegetarian restaurants in
France. The region’s proximity to the Mediterranean means fish always is on the menu:
Plan to feast on steamy fish stews such as bourride and bouillabaisse, sauces such
as tapenade (olive paste) and aïoli (a garlic mayonnaise), and lots of freshly caught
fish and shellfish.

 Mougins: The hilltop medieval village of Mougins, the longtime
home of Picasso, contains one of the Riviera’s most famous restau-
rants, Le Moulin de Mougins (% 04-93-75-78-24; www.moulin-
mougins.com) — reserve far in advance. A photography museum
at the top of the hill features candid photos of Picasso.
 Roquebrune and Cap-Martin: These two resorts, one a hill town
and one shoreside, are close to the border of Italy. Roquebrune is
26km (16 miles) east of Cannes, and Cap-Martin is 24km (15 miles)
east of Nice. Roquebrune is accessed by the Grande Corniche, the
mountain road that runs along the eastern part of the French
Riviera. It’s a charming village where cobblestone streets are lined
with boutiques, gift shops, and galleries. You also find the Château
de Roquebrune (% 04-93-35-07-22), a 10th-century castle that
houses a museum. Cap-Martin once was popular with celebrities,
royalty, and politicians, and still attracts a wealthy crowd. The
beach is rocky but scenic. A walking path here, Promenade Le
Corbusier, named after the architect who used to come to the
resort, is one of the finest on the Riviera for coastal views.

T
his chapter covers the area of the French Riviera that extends 35km
(22 miles) west from the border with Italy to Nice. We start with
Nice, the Riviera’s largest city, because it serves as kind of a gateway 
to the region. If you’re traveling to the Riviera via almost any kind of
public transportation, you’ll go through Nice. And with the exception of
St-Tropez (about 100km/62 miles from Nice), every Riviera destination
discussed in this book is within a 35km (22-mile) radius of Nice.
Although you’ll find plenty to see and do in Nice, we suggest a few other
regions to visit, including the opulent Monaco, actually a tiny country
surrounded by French countryside and the Mediterranean Sea, and two
small but luxurious resort villages in between Nice and Monaco:
Beaulieu and St-Jean-Cap-Ferrat.
Nice: A Study in Contrasts
The seaside city of Nice (the Riviera’s largest) is at once sophisticated
and giddy, regal and honky-tonk, and dignified and disorderly. With a
population of 485,000, Nice is large enough to offer many contrasting 
elements. You may be struck by the grace of the city, its buildings deco-
rated with filigreed wrought-iron balconies and multicolored shutters,
and by its boisterous energy. The Promenade des Anglais, along the 
crescent-shaped Baie des Anges, is the Riviera’s most beautiful beach-
front boardwalk. The Old Town, a maze of winding narrow streets
crowded with vendors, is the heart of a city that cherishes its unique-
ness. Street names in the Old Town are written in French and Nissart.
Nissart is not a dialect but a real language that is closer to Italian than it
is to French. Because Nice still holds tight to its traditions and history of
independence, elderly Niçoise still speak the language, and some young
people learn it in school.

You’ll find many interesting sights in Nice. With 19 galleries and mu-
seums, Nice is a city of art. One of the country’s foremost modern art
museums, Musée d’Art Modern et d’Art Contemporain, occupies a dra-
matic contemporary building in the center of town. The city has mu-
seums devoted to Henri Matisse (who lived in Nice for many years and 
is buried here) and Marc Chagall, in addition to the Museum of Fine Arts
(in a building formerly owned by Russian aristocrats); the Museum of
Naïve Art; a museum of decorative art (the Musée d’Art et d’Histoire
Palais Masséna); and the Palais Lascaris, with baroque art.
Getting there
Nice is a major transportation hub and a convenient base from which to
explore the region. Aéroport International Nice Côte d’Azur (% 08-20-
42-33-33; www.nice.aeroport.fr) is France’s second-busiest airport,
with up to 45 planes per day flying from Paris to Nice and a flight from
New York to Nice five days a week. The airport, with two terminals, is
7km (4 miles) from the city center. Terminal 1 is used for international
flights. For information about public transportation and to summon a
taxi to any point within Nice, call % 0820-423-333. A taxi to the city
center takes 20 minutes and costs 25€ to 35€ ($33–$46). Buses leave the
airport every 30 minutes for the town center, the SNCF train station, and
the Gare Routière (municipal bus station); each bus costs 4€ ($5.20)
and takes 30 minutes.
From Paris’s Gare de Lyon, the rapid TGV train takes six-and-a-half
hours to get to Nice’s Gare SNCF and affords panoramic views along the
coast — particularly from Cannes to Nice. Trains run every hour in the
summer, but only once per day in the winter. The train from Paris costs
90€ to 110€ ($117–$143). The slow trains that travel along the coast of

A Nice history
Nice didn’t actually become a part of France until 1860, when a treaty between
France’s Napoleon III and Italy’s Victor Emmanuel sited it distinctly within France. The
city’s history stretches back to the 4th century B.C., when the Greeks settled on the
Colline du Château (known as just Le Château). In 100 B.C., Romans built a town called
Cemenelum on the hill of Cimiez. Barbarians and Saracens subjected the town to six
centuries of invasions until the counts of Provence resettled the Colline du Château in
A.D. 500. In the 14th century, the Niçoise agreed to be under the sovereignty of Italy’s
House of Savoy. But between 1691 and 1731, and 1792 and 1814, Nice fell briefly under
French rule. In 1704, Louis XIV, annoyed with the Niçoise because they wanted their
independence from France, destroyed all buildings on the Castle Hill. Finally, in 1860,
Napoléon III and King Victor Emmanuel II of Sardinia signed the Treaty of Turin, which
made Nice a part of France again and paved the way for it to become a popular winter
resort during the early 1900s — and what is now the capital of tourism on the French
Riviera.

the Riviera stop in Nice, so you’ll find frequent service to Cannes,
Monaco, and Antibes, among others places. For train information, call
% 08-92-35-35-39. Trains arrive in the center of the modern part of the
city on avenue Thiers.
Gare Routière de Nice (bus station) is at 5 bd. Jean-Jaurès (% 04-93-
85-61-81). Buses are a cheap and practical way to visit nearby villages
and towns. For instance, a one-way trip by bus to Monte Carlo is only
3.80€ ($4.95); a bus ticket to Cannes is 5.90€ ($7.65).
If you’re driving to Nice, you can get there via A8; the Route Napoléon;
or the national highway 7, 98, or 202. Nice is 931km (579 miles) from
Paris and 190km (118 miles) from Marseille. Driving from Paris to Nice
takes about ten hours. The trip from Marseilles to Nice takes about three
hours, depending on traffic.
Getting around and getting information
You don’t need a car in Nice, as the Old Town and many attractions are
within walking distance (see the nearby “Nice” map). City buses are a
convenient way to see the museums in Cimiez, a suburb of Nice. The bus
company is Ligne d’Azur (10 av. Félix-Faure; % 08-10-06-10-06), open
Monday to Friday 7:15 a.m. to 7 p.m. and Saturday 8 a.m. to 6 p.m. You
can pick up route maps in the office. Tickets, which you can buy on the
buses, cost 4€ ($5.20) for unlimited rides all day. A single ride goes for
1.30€ ($1.70). With the Sun Pass, you can travel freely on all regular bus
lines in Nice and the hills of Cimiez for seven days (15€/$20).
You can rent a car at the airport and at other city locations. Avis is at
the airport (% 04-93-21-36-33 Terminal 1 or 04-93-21-42-80 Terminal 2) or
at the SNCF train station (% 08-20-61-16-31). You can also find Budget at
the airport (% 04-93-21-36-50 Terminal 1 or 04-93-21-42-51 Terminal 2)
and across the street from the SNCF train station at 23 rue de Belgique
(% 04-93-87-45-37). Hertz is represented in Nice by an affiliate known as
Nicea Location Rent, with headquarters at 12 rue de Belgique (% 04-
93-82-42-71); a branch office directly within the railway station at 9 av.
Thiers (% 04-97-03-01-20); and with additional branches at the Nice 
airport (% 04-93-21-36-72).
You can rent a bike at Nicea Location Rent (12 rue de Belgique; % 04-
93-82-42-71).
The main taxi stands are located at esplanade Masséna, Promenade des
Anglais, place Garibaldi, rue Hôtel des Postes, the SNCF train station,
Nice’s airport, and Acropolis, which also is known as the Palais des
Congrès and is located a half-mile north of the center of town. To
summon a cab, call Allo Taxi Riviéra at % 04-93-13-78-78. (Prepare 
to pay a higher rate from 7 p.m.–7 a.m.)

This Mediterranean-style hotel, part of the Tulip chain, claims an ideal
location, a few blocks from the beaches and a short walk to the Old Town,
and features a memorable garden with a fountain and statuary. In the 
colonial-style sitting room, the hotel staff is available to answer questions
or help with special requests. Many of the 58 rooms are filled with light,
and those looking out over the garden are the most desirable. All rooms
have the usual amenities; some contain French balconies with intricate
wrought-iron work. The hotel offers a reasonably priced restaurant, in
addition to a sauna, gym, and solarium.

West of Center
An architectural and decorative statement, this 38-room hotel occupies a
former boardinghouse. Spearheaded by Matali Crasset, a former colleague
of Philippe Starck, a team of architects and engineers created one of the
most aggressively avant-garde hotels in the south of France. The angular
seven-story hotel opened in 2003. Each of the nine high-tech room con-
cepts is different. They range from hospital white-on-white, to birchwood
veneer and acid green, to cool violet and gray. As an example of the uncon-
ventional layouts of the rooms, consider the bathtubs, which may be
tucked behind a screen of potted plants or elevated to a position of

Center
This small hotel, built around 1900, is in a calm and quiet area about
halfway between the train station and the beach. It is indeed an oasis, set
in a lush garden and boasting an outdoor pool. The 38 rooms are small,
but they’re clean and comfortable, and the rates are reasonable. Ask about
the hotel’s most famous guests: Chekhov and Lenin apparently stayed here
during the Belle Epoque era, when, because of its large community of expa-
triate Russians, Nice was called “Moscow-by-the-Sea.”

decorated with museum-quality furniture and artwork, and many have bal-
conies facing the sea. Each floor features rooms in a different style, from
Louis XV to Empire to Napoléon III. The Salon Royal, with its glass dome,
is where you will have a drink before dining at the acclaimed Chantecler

Régence is situated on one of the busiest pedestrian streets in the modern
part of Nice but within easy walking distance of the Old Town and beaches.
The central location means street life goes on outside your window until
the wee hours, with a major strolling scene, street performers, and musi-
cians. Fortunately, the 60 rooms, which are small but immaculate, have
soundproof windows. Breakfast is served in a sunny room or on a small

Center
This transformed 19th-century hotel near the Promenade des Anglais is a
celebration of contemporary art. Local and nationally recognized artists
decorated the 57 rooms with murals, paintings, and sculptures, and the
result is sometimes ravishing, sometimes startling, but always unique. One
room is decorated with works by Henri Olivier, who makes “living still-
lifes,” and another features the conceptual poetry of Lawrence Wiener (his
poem about dreams is written in bright colors on the wall above the bed).
Breakfast is served in the attractive dining room or the exotic garden. The
fitness area offers a sauna and massage room. You can enjoy swimming in
the pool, surrounded by tropical plants and listening to piped-in bird
songs. The hotel has a very fine restaurant and an attractive bar with live
piano music some nights.

fast room or an American breakfast brought by room service. You need to
book early for this one; it’s become a hip place to stay.

Dining locally
The Niçoise pride themselves on their cuisine, which features a number
of unique specialties. Socca is a steaming crepe made of chickpeas that’s
sold from street vendors in the heart of the Old Town. Pissaladière (onion
tart) and les petite farcis (stuffed vegetables) are favorite appetizers.
Beignets de fleurs de courgettes are fried zucchini flowers, and tarte de
blettes is a tart garnished with Swiss chard. Visitors have a hard time
ordering merda de can, which translates literally as dog excrement, but
it’s actually very delicious gnocchi with spinach. Small local olives, pou-
tine (fried little fish), and preserved fruits are also specialties of Nice.
Last, but not least, is the famous salade niçoise, made with tuna, pota-
toes, tomatoes, olives, anchovies, green beans, and capers.

This restaurant, established in 1927 by the grandmother of the kindly
owner, is where you can find one of the cheapest good meals in town. It’s
a small, unpretentious place in the Old Town that attracts locals and visi-
tors alike. Patrons tend to wander in after perusing the inexpensive menu.
Specialties are fish soup, homemade ravioli, les petis farcis niçoises (a
medley of stuffed vegetables), minestrone, and fresh pastas. Your best bet
is the copious proportioned plat du jour, which is bound to be a hearty tra-
ditional dish.

The Turin, a bustling brasserie on place Garibaldi, is known for a menu
that includes virtually no meat, lots of fish, and some of the best shellfish
in Nice. Its solid reputation has borne the test of time, and since 1908,
locals and visitors have come here for towering seafood platters with oys-
ters, clams, shrimp, and other shellfish. Although this place is popular for
before-dinner drinks or apéritifs, it’s never easy to find a table.

For the best and perhaps most expensive meal in Nice, head to the exqui-
site Chantecler. The setting is palatial — the ornately carved wood panel-
ing was purchased from a château, as were many of the antiques. Chef
Bruno Turbo uses top-quality ingredients such as black truffles, foie gras,
giant prawns, and lobster to create enchanting dishes. Many of the culi-
nary specialties here are presented as tapas, delicate morsels bursting
with flavor. The menu changes according to the freshest produce and
meats, but a first-course highlight is pommes de terre nouvelles poêlées,
anchois marinés et brochette de suppions (pan-fried new potatoes, mari-
nated anchovies, and skewered cuttlefish), and a main-course highlight is
épigrammes d’agneau de lait (breaded, braised, and grilled lamb).
Sommelier Patrick Millereau can help you select the perfect wine, though
you may have trouble finding one for a reasonable price.

VEGETARIAN/ITALIAN
The chef at this popular harborside restaurant is hailed as the best Italian
chef in Nice. That this honor should go to a vegetarian restaurant is the
most startling part of the news. Chef Marco, who opened his restaurant in
1997 after cooking for many years in Rome, certainly has a fine pedigree —
he’s a relative of Luciano Pavarotti. He serves refined cuisine at reason-
able prices, using recipes from Italy’s Piedmont region, updated without
meat or fish. The pink-and-green décor puts you in the mood for the creative
cuisine. You’ll have to trust Marco, though, because everyone is served
the same meal. You can count on savory cuisine using lots of herbs, Italian
cheeses, beans, and pasta. Lasagna is a specialty.

Arrive at Le Safari before 9 p.m. if you don’t want to wait for a table. The

the prices are reasonable, and the food is good. The waiters must train like
Olympic athletes, the way they speed around the huge terrace. The restau-
rant also has seating inside, but you won’t be able to enjoy the free enter-
tainment from traveling musicians, who tend to pause to play some tunes
in front. The menu emphasizes pastas and grilled fish. The Niçoise merda

A fine restaurant on the border of old Nice, the dining room’s décor is
deceptively simple, considering the complex tastes being devised in the
kitchen. Wrought-iron chairs surround glass-topped tables in the center of

better for watching the gourmets of Nice come and go. The most famous
dish here is the red mullet with asparagus. Other good choices are the
summer special, fried calamari and morue fraîche aux artichauts (fresh cod
with artichokes). The restaurant offers a succulent strawberry tart for

Exploring Nice
Nice is divided into two distinct parts. The modern area in the center of
the city and to the west of the Old Town boasts the famous Promenade
des Anglais, hands-down the Riviera’s best beach boardwalk. Hotels in a
wide range of price categories line the promenade. Vieille Ville, on the
east side, is home to Old Town, a magical place with winding ancient
streets leading to charming cafes, markets, and unique shops. You can
always find a lively street life here. While passing colorful markets, you
may see a hurdy-gurdy player or other street performers along cours
Saleya. Between the Old Town and the harbor is the Colline du Château,
also known as just Le Château. This hill no longer has a castle, but it
does offer a panoramic view over the bay. An elevator takes you to the
top, or you can ride the tourist train to the top.
Chapter 20: Nice, Monaco, and Beyond 405
Whatever happened to the lunch bell?
Hear that cannon shot from the Colline du Château every day at noon? You can thank
one hungry Englishman for the lunchtime reminder. In the late 19th century, Lord
Coventry retired from the army and came to live in Nice. He had an absent-minded
wife, so he built a cannon on Castle Hill and fired it every day to remind her to prepare
lunch for him.

Within the core of central Nice, you find two different tourist trains, each
painted in cheerful colors and each rolling on rubber tires through the
city’s historic core. The less comprehensive of the two is Le Petit Train
Touristique de Nice (% 06-16-39-53-51), which travels around the Old
Town as far as the panoramic summit of Castle Hill, taking 40 minutes
and costing 6€ ($7.80). A more comprehensive option is offered by the
Bus-Le Grand Tour (% 04-92-29-17-00). Priced at 17€ ($22) per person,
its tours last an hour and a half and include a greater number of sights.
Both trains depart from the esplanade Albert 1er, across from the Hotel
Méridien, allow children younger than 4 to ride free with their guardians,
and operate daily as follows: June to August 10 a.m. to 7 p.m.; April to
May and September 10 a.m. to 6 p.m.; October to March 10 a.m. to 5 p.m.
On a hill north of town is the suburb of Cimiez, which also has a rich
historical record, as is evident from the Roman ruins. Next to the ruins
is the famous Musée Matisse, the most popular museum in Nice.
Nice’s wild Carnaval takes place the last two weeks in February and fea-
tures parades, concerts, balls, fireworks, and general merriment. The
Mardi Gras Parade goes from place Masséna down avenue Jean-Médecin,
and the flower processions are on Promenade des Anglais. The other big
annual event is the Festival du Jazz, which takes place in July under the
olive trees of the Cimiez Gardens and in the nearby Roman Arenas, on
three stages simultaneously. For the event, the city plays host to more
than 200 musicians from around the world. Call the tourist office for
details.
Beware of pickpockets in Nice, particularly near the train station and in
the Old Town.
Walking around Nice
If you want to follow your own walking tour, begin on Promenade des
Anglais, which was the grand idea of a vacationing Englishman who saw
many beggars here after the harsh winter of 1820–21 and set them to
work building the boardwalk. The promenade follows the Baie des Anges
along 15 pebbly private beaches, which are crowded with restaurants
and concessions. On the other side of the boulevard, grand seaview
hotels line the road; check out one of the Riviera’s top hotels, the
Négresco, with its whimsical pink dome. In the evening, jazz, salsa,
swing, and classical musicians perform along the promenade.
Then it’s on to Vieille Ville, where the streets are lined with cafes, bars,
and shops. Begin on cours Saleya, which, depending on the hour and
day, is filled with a market of vegetables, flowers, or antiques. On the
north side of the street is the Chapelle de la Miséricorde, a small 18th-
century church with a jewel box of an interior.
Farther up cours Saleya, take a left on rue de la Poissonerie. Near the
tops of buildings throughout the Old Town are interesting architectural
flourishes, such as multicolored murals, stucco friezes, and trompe l’oeil.
Part VI: Provence and the Riviera 
406

For instance, on a building on the right side of rue de la Poissonerie is a
1584 fresco of Adam and Eve. Nearby is a lintel from the Middle Ages
inscribed with the name of the family that lived in the house. Soon you
reach the Eglise Ste-Rita de l’Annonciation (open daily 7 a.m.–noon and
2:30–6:30 p.m.), built in the Middle Ages but “baroquialized” in the 18th
century. This popular church is devoted to St. Rita, the patron saint of
desperate causes. It’s the most visited chapel in the Old Town and one
of the oldest churches in Nice.
Take a left on rue de la Préfecture to reach the early-17th-century Palais
de la Préfecture, formerly the residence of the governors and princes of
Savoy. Now it contains the office of the president of the General Council
and the prefect of the Alpes-Maritimes region. Retrace your steps back
on rue de la Préfecture to rue Droite, an ancient street used in medieval
times to cross the Old Town from one city gate to the other. Turn left
onto rue Droite and look for the Eglise St-Jacques Le Majeur ou du
Gésu. After the Jesuits built this church in 1650, many wealthy families
constructed palatial homes nearby. The beautiful church facade was
used as a model for baroque churches throughout the region. The
church is infrequently open, so seeing the facade will have to suffice.
Rue de Gésu, across from the church, leads to place Rosetti, which is
the largest square in Old Town thanks to Monsieur Rosetti, a local who
gave money to destroy all the buildings in front of the cathedral in order
to improve the view from the cathedral steps. Rue Rossetti off the
square leads again to rue Droite. Take a left onto rue Droite to see the
Palais Lascaris, a museum of decorative arts (see later in this section for
details). A cannonball embedded in the corner building near the Palais
Lescaris is from a 1543 siege of the town. Follow rue Droite to rue St-
François and place St-François, where a fish market is open on Tuesday
to Sunday mornings.
Beyond the square is rue Pairoliere (“cauldron”), “the belly” of Nice,
lined with food shops such as charcuteries (pork butchers) and
boucheries (butchers). A shortcut on tiny rue du Choeur leads to place
St-Augustin, with the Eglise St-Martin et St-Augustin, a baroque church
with a fine Pietà attributed to Ludovic Brea (a famous Niçoise artist of
the Middle Ages). Rue Sincaire runs to rue Catherine-Ségurane, which
leads to the harbor; the flea market; and a monument to Catherine
Ségurane, Nice’s most beloved heroine. This washerwoman became
famous during a 1543 siege of Nice by the Turks. She climbed to the top
of the ramparts that surrounded the town back then, pulled up her
dress, and mooned the advancing Turks, thus allegedly slowing down
the enemy (and/or boosting the morale of the Niçoise).
Seeing the top sights in Nice and Cimiez
You can get a Passe-Musées for museums in Nice or for the region. A
one-week pass for all Nice museums is 6€ ($7.80).
Chapter 20: Nice, Monaco, and Beyond 407

In the Old Town, a fine art collection is housed in the Palais Lascaris
(15 rue Droite; % 04-93-92-01-35), a 17th-century Genoese-style palace
with a grand central staircase and baroque staterooms. The palace was
the home of the Lascaris-Ventimiglia family, which in 1648 combined four
houses to make the residence. The family sold the palace in 1802, and 
it became a rabbit warren of squalid apartments until the city of Nice
came to the rescue in 1942, purchasing the building and restoring it. On
display are 17th- and 18th-century objects, including Flemish tapestries,
faïence (colored pottery) vases, and displays of crafts such as weaving
and pottery making. Year-round, it’s open Wednesday to Monday 10 a.m.
to 6 p.m. Admission is free.
Built from 1650 to 1680, the baroque Cathédrale Ste-Reparate, in the
heart of the Old Town (place Rossetti; % 04-97-13-42-01), is devoted to
the patron saint of Nice, St. Reparate. Legend has it that her body was
put on a barge out to sea, arriving back in the bay escorted by angels
and doves (thus the name of Nice’s bay, Baie des Anges, or Bay of
Angels). The church’s 12 chapels, which belonged to wealthy families
and corporations, are decorated in rich stucco and marble. The bell
tower was added in the 18th century. The cathedral also has the desig-
nation “basilica,” meaning a very important cathedral that hosted cardi-
nals and bishops. It’s open daily 7:30 a.m. to noon and 2 to 6 p.m. and
admission is free. Tuesday afternoons from 2 to 5 p.m., a staff person
leads free guided tours of the cathedral, following a vague, unstructured
schedule that usually requires an advance telephone call and which is
most willingly configured for groups of six participants or more.
Built in 1990, the enormous and daring Musée d’Art Moderne et d’Art
Contemporain (Promenade des Arts; % 04-93-62-61-62; www.mamac-
nice.org) is highly entertaining as it follows the history of European
and American avant-garde painting, starting in the 1960s. Quite a bit of
space is devoted to the works of Yves Klein, a Niçois who made a big
splash in the 1960s with his famous blue paintings and his happenings.
The museum also has a large collection of American pop art, with works
by Warhol, Rauschenberg, and Lichtenstein. It’s open Tuesday to Sunday
10 a.m. to 6 p.m.; it’s closed January 1, Easter Sunday, May 1, and
December 25. Admission is 4€ ($5.20) for adults, 2.50€ ($3.25) for stu-
dents, and free for children younger than 18.
The beautiful Musée Matisse (164 av. des Arènes de Cimiez; % 04-93-81-
08-08; www.musee-matisse-nice.org), situated in an Italianate villa
high above Nice, houses a wonderful collection of monographs, draw-
ings, and engravings by Matisse, in addition to personal items of the
artist, including sculptures, paintings he cherished, furniture and vases
that appear in his paintings, and even a huge kouros (an ancient Greek
statue) he owned. The museum also owns Matisse’s first painting, a dour
1890 still life, and one of his last gouaches from 1953. Matisse lived in
Nice from 1917 until his death in 1954 and is buried in the cemetery
nearby. To get to the museum, take the no. 15, 17, 20, or 22 bus to
Cimiez, and get off at the Arènes stop. The museum is open year-round
Part VI: Provence and the Riviera

Wednesday to Monday 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. It’s closed January 1, May 1, and
December 25. Admission is 4€ ($5.20) for adults; 2.50€ ($3.25) for stu-
dents; and free for children younger than 18.
Nice even has Roman ruins. Next to the Musée Matisse in Cimiez is the
ancient Baths of Cemenelum, founded in 14 B.C. by Augustus. Admission
is 4€ ($4.80) for adults, 2.50€ ($3.25) for students, and free for children
younger than 18. To find out more, visit the Musée Archéologique de
Nice-Cimiez, at 160 rue des Arènes on the western boundary of the ruins
(% 04-93-81-59-57). The collections range from the Metal Ages (1100
B.C.) to the Middle Ages and include ceramics, glass, coins, jewelry, and
sculptures. Hours and admission for both are the same as for the nearby
Musée Matisse.
While in Cimiez, you can peer into the Monastère de Cimiez (place du
Monastère; % 04-93-81-00-04). The convent embraces a church that
owns three of the most important works from the primitive painting
school of Nice by the Bréa brothers. See the carved and gilded wooden
main altarpiece. In a restored part of the convent where some
Franciscan friars still live, Musée Franciscain is decorated with 17th-
century frescoes. Some 350 documents and works of art from the 15th
through 18th centuries are displayed, and a monk’s cell has been re-
created in all its severe simplicity. The gardens offer panoramic views 
of Nice and the Baie des Anges. Matisse and Dufy are buried in the cem-
etery. Admission is free; the museum is open Monday to Saturday from 
10 a.m. to noon and 3 to 6 p.m., the church daily from 9 a.m. to 6 p.m.
While living in nearby Vence between 1960 and 1966, artist Marc Chagall
worked on his Bible paintings. His paintings form the core of the collec-
tion at the Musée National Message Biblique Marc Chagall, on avenue
du Docteur-Menard, at the corner of boulevard de Cimiez (% 04-93-53-
87-20). The museum’s collection, which is the largest public Chagall col-
lection, spans the artist’s life with works from the 1930s to his death in
1985 — paintings, drawings, engravings, mosaics, glass windows, and
tapestries. The stark modern building that houses the works is set in a
park in Cimiez, about a five-minute drive or short bus ride (no. 15) north
of the center of Nice. The museum is open year-round Wednesday
through Monday 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. Admission is 6.50€ ($8.45) adults,
4.50€ ($5.85) for students, children younger than 18 free. Entrance is
free on the first Sunday of every month.
Nice’s Musée des Beaux-Arts (33 av. des Baumettes; % 04-92-15-28-28;
www.musee-beaux-arts-nice.org) is housed in an early-1900s
Italianate mansion on the west side of town, the former residence of the
Ukrainian Princess Kotchubey. The fine-arts museum covers the 17th
century to early 20th century, with a collection of more than 6,000
works. The 17th-century section includes Italian paintings and Dutch
landscapes. The late-19th- and early-20th-century collection features
works by Dufy, Van Dongen, Monet, Degas, and Renoir. The large sculp-
ture gallery presents works by Rodin and others. The museum is open

A donation by art critic Anatole Jakovsky enabled the Musée Inter-
national d’Art Naïf (av. de Fabron, at the corner of avenue Val Marie; 
% 04-93-71-78-33; Bus: nos. 9, 10) to open in the early 1980s in the
attractive Château Ste-Hélène. The collection of 700 paintings, drawings,

18th century to the present. The museum is open Wednesday to Monday
10 a.m. to 6 p.m. Admission is 4€ ($5.20) for adults, 2.50€ ($3.25) stu-
dents; children younger than 18 visit for free.
In the late 19th century, the Russian aristocracy began wintering on the
Riviera and transformed Nice in the process. You can’t miss the soaring
ornate onion domes at the top of the Cathédrale Orthodoxe Russe 
St-Nicolas, on avenue Nicolas II off boulevard du Tzarévitch (% 04-93-
96-88-02). Built from 1902 to 1912, this magnificent church houses a
large collection of icons, elaborate woodwork, and frescoes. The cathe-
dral is open daily May to September 9 a.m. to noon and 2:30 to 6 p.m.
and October to April 9:30 a.m. to noon and 2:30 to 5:30 p.m. Entrance

olives, fruits and vegetables, and herbs and spices.
Special items to look for in Nice include glassware from Biot, pottery
from Vallauris, perfumes from Grasse, faïence from Moustier, wine from
nearby Bellet, and fougasse à la fleur d’oranger (local bread made
with orange blossoms).
You’ll find the best olive oil at the Maison de l’Olive (18 rue Pairolière;
% 04-93-80-01-61) and the most enticing candied fruit at the Confiserie
Florian du Vieux Nice (14 quai Papacino; % 04-93-55-43-50). The Caves
Caprioglio (16 rue de la Préfecture; % 04-93-85-66-57) is the oldest wine

Boucherie; % 04-93-85-85-19) and Les Olivades (8 av. de Verdun; % 04-
93-88-75-50), you can browse through a great collection of Provençal
fabrics in Riviera colors and motifs.
If you’re looking for arts and crafts, visit Atelier Contre-Jour (3 rue du
Pont Vieux; % 04-93-80-20-50) for handcrafts in painted wood, painted
furniture, picture frames of painted wood, and silk lampshades. Many
artists’ studios/galleries are located on side streets near the cathedral
in the Old Town.
Living it up after dark
Nice offers some of the best nightlife on the Riviera. You can go to the
opera, hang out in an Irish pub, party at a disco, or wander along the
Promenade des Anglais, where itinerant musicians jam ’til the wee
hours. For happenings about town, check out the free guides Le Mois 
à Nice and L’Exés and also La Semaine des Spectacles and L’Officiel
des Loisirs Côte d’Azur (all are available at newsstands).
For highbrow entertainment, attend the Opéra de Nice (4 rue St-François-
de-Paule; % 04-92-17-40-00), an early-1900s palace designed by Charles
Garner, architect of Paris’s Opéra Garnier. Opéra de Nice presents a full
repertoire of opera and concerts, with tickets ranging from 7€ to 85€
($9.10–$111). On the other end of the scale are the 10 p.m. Vegas-style
shows on Fridays and Saturdays at the Casino Ruhl (1 Promenade des
Anglais; % 04-97-03-12-22). The casino is open for slot-machine gam-
bling 10 a.m. to 4 a.m.; the more formal gaming rooms are open Monday
to Thursday 8 p.m. to 4 a.m., Friday and Saturday 5 p.m. to 5 a.m., and
Sunday 5 p.m. to 4 a.m. Entrance to the formal rooms is free. If you play
the slot machines, you don’t need a passport, but for the formal gaming
rooms, you do. Men are not required to wear a jacket and tie, but sneakers
are frowned upon.
Nice has many bars in the Old Town where Americans will feel right at
home, including the Scarlett O’Hara Irish Pub, located on the corner 
of rue Rosetti and rue Droite % 04-93-80-43-22; Wayne’s (15 rue de la
Préfecture; % 04-93-13-46-99); and William’s Pub (4 rue Centrale; 
% 04-93-62-99-63), which has live music. If you’d rather hang out with
French people, try La Civette, a popular spot for apéritifs (29 rue de la
Préfecture; % 04-93-62-35-51).
Nice also has a big gay scene — the most popular club is Blue Boy (9
rue Spinetta; % 04-93-44-68-24). One of Nice’s most in-vogue nightspots
is Le Klub (6 rue Halévy; % 04-93-16-27-56), where gays, straights, and
hipsters of indeterminate gender and sexual preferences congregate,
dish, dance, flirt, and create a brouhaha.
Chapter 20: Nice, Monaco, and Beyond 411

Monaco: Big Money on “The Rock”
Visitors flock to the principality of Monaco to ogle the ultrarich gam-
blers, watch the changing of the guard at the Grimaldi Palace, and 
stroll through the exotic gardens. Looking for a quaint little place on a
sliver of coast near the border of Italy, most people are struck by the
overdevelopment — particularly the densely packed skyscrapers. This
tiny country, with 40,000 residents and 150 hectares (371 acres — the
size of a small town), is built into the side of a steep ridge. The roads
and streets are in vertical layers that are difficult to navigate, so eleva-
tors take people from one level to the next. But most people don’t
bother to use them — they drive. Monaco and its Monégasques
absolutely adore the automobile (the famous Grand Prix in late May or
early June is the year’s biggest event). The town is crisscrossed by fast
roads with no sidewalks or very narrow ones. If you don’t have a car, the
best way to get around is by bus.
Besides cars, the other thing worshiped in Monaco is money. The
Monégasques don’t pay income tax, and the whole principality, with its
wall-to-wall condominium towers and casino culture, seems obsessed
with lucre — filthy or otherwise. Two-thirds of its hotel rooms are con-
tained within government-rated four-star deluxe hotels, so Monaco has
always been a destination for the rich and famous.
You can find pockets of beauty here and a number of interesting sights.
Orange trees line rue Grimaldi, the main road through the region’s
center, and you can catch a glimpse of the yacht-filled harbor from
almost anywhere in Monaco. The Old Town surrounding the palace has
narrow cobblestone streets and charming restaurants and shops. The
parks and gardens of the principality, especially the Jardin St-Martin
with views out to sea, are spectacular. And if you’re willing to scrub up
and plop down a 10€ ($13) cover charge, you can wander around the
famed Monte Carlo Casino, with its gilded columns and frescoed ceil-
ings, or have a drink at the terrace bar in the Hôtel Hermitage with
breathtaking views.
The Grimaldi family, originally from Genoa, acquired the lordship of
Monaco in 1308, and since then, the title Prince de Monaco has been
bestowed on the heirs. Prince Albert II is the current head of the family.
His father married American actress Grace Kelly in 1956. She died in a
car crash here in 1982. The European tabloid press follows closely 
the exploits of Albert and Grace’s other two children: Caroline and
Stephanie. Many visitors go to Monaco’s cathedral (4 rue Colonel
Bellando de Castro; % 93-30-87-70) to pay homage at Princess Grace’s
burial site. Monaco has a heavy police presence, and rowdiness isn’t tol-
erated in the principality. You can assume that most men you see riding
scooters in Monaco are police. The benefit of that, of course, is that
Monaco is the safest place in Europe. Lots of security forces are around
to protect everyone’s money, and the streets are safe at all hours.
Part VI: Provence and the Riviera 
412

Children take buses alone. It’s also one of the cleanest places in Europe,
and you’ll rarely see litter on the ground.
Monaco’s telephone numbers have eight digits, as opposed to France’s
numbers with ten digits. When calling Monaco from France, dial % 00-
377 plus the eight-digit number. To dial Monaco from the United States,
dial % 011-377 plus the eight-digit number. To call a number in France
from Monaco, dial % 00-33 plus the last nine digits of the number.
Getting there
With no border formalities, Monaco is easy to get to by car, bus, or train,
with frequent train service (every half-hour) to and from Cannes, Nice,
Antibes, and Menton. Trips from Nice to Monaco cost 2.70€ ($3.50) and
take 25 to 30 minutes. From Paris, at least two trains per day depart from
Gare de Lyon, each requiring between six and six-and-three-quarter hours
one-way, and sometimes requiring a change of equipment and a brief
stopover in Nice. One-way fares cost around 92€ to 107€ ($120–$139) per
person. For train schedules, call % 93-10-60-01 in Monaco or 3635 in
France.
Monaco’s enormous train station has three exits on three levels, and if
you don’t know which exit to use, you may have trouble finding your
hotel. Monaco is a confusing place to navigate, so you may want to pick
up a free map at the station’s tourist office (open Mon–Sat 9 a.m.–7 p.m.).
Arriving at the Monaco train station after 9 p.m. is like arriving on Wall
Street after 9 p.m. — it’s desolate, and there’s not a soul on the street.
On the bright side, Monaco restaurants serve dinner late, so you can
usually get a full meal at least until 11 p.m.
Monaco has frequent bus service (every 15 min.) to Nice, Beaulieu, and
Menton on line no. 100 of the French bus company Rapides Côte d’Azur
(% 04-93-85-64-44). The trip from Nice to Monaco by bus takes half an
hour and costs 3€ ($3.90) round trip or one way (your choice). The
times and prices are the same to Menton. The easiest place to catch a
bus is in front of the gardens that face the Casino, but it also stops in
front of the port (on boulevard Albert-1er at the Stade Nautique stop)
and at several other spots around town.
If you’re driving from Nice to Monaco, take N7 northeast. The 12-mile
(19 km) drive takes about 35 minutes because of heavy traffic; Cannes 
to Monaco requires about 55 minutes. If driving from Paris, follow A6 to
Lyon. In Lyon, take A7 south to Aix-en-Provence and A8 to Monaco.
Getting around and getting information
The best way to get around Monaco is by bus, and you can buy bus
cards, which cost 1.50€ ($1.95) per ride, directly on the bus. Stops are
set up every few blocks on the main streets in town, including boulevard
Albert-1er, avenue St-Martin in Monaco Ville, and boulevard des Moulins
Chapter 20: Nice, Monaco, and Beyond 413

in Monte Carlo. Buses go to the major tourist sights; the front of the bus
shows the destination.
For a taxi, call % 93-15-01-01 or 93-50-56-28. Taxi stands are in front of
the Casino on avenue de Monte-Carlo, at place des Moulins in Monte
Carlo; at the Port de Monaco on av. Président J. F. Kennedy; and in front
of the Poste de Monte-Carlo on avenue Henry-Dunant. A Hertz car-rental
office is at 27 bd. Albert-1er (% 93-50-79-60), and an Avis office at 9 av.
d’Ostende (% 93-30-17-53).
The Corniches are the three major scenic coastal highways of the
Riviera stretching from Nice to Menton and passing around Monaco. 
The lower road is called the Corniche Inférieure; the middle road is the
Moyenne Corniche, which runs through the mountains; and the Grande
Corniche is the highest road over the top of the mountains bordering
the Riviera.
If you’re driving around Monaco, be very careful on the wicked curves of
the corniches. The changing of the palace guard (La Releve de la Garde
del Palais des Grimaldi) takes place at 11:55 a.m., which creates a major
traffic jam in Monaco between 10:30 and 11:30 a.m. If you’re driving in or
around Monaco during that time, you’ll have major delays.
The tourist office is at 2A bd. des Moulins, Monte Carlo (% 92-16-
61-16), and is open Monday to Saturday 9 a.m. to 7 p.m., Sunday 10 a.m. 
to noon.
Spending the night
Columbus Monaco Hotel
$$$–$$$$
Fontvieille
In the modern Fontvieille sector of Monaco is a stylish and contemporary
181-unit hotel. This hotel is the harbinger of a hotel chain launched by
Scotsman Ken McCulloch. McCulloch is called the “champion of high style
at low prices.” He says he believes that low prices don’t have to mean low-
brow. Facing Princess Grace’s former rose garden and the sea, this first-
class hotel is open year-round. Bedrooms are done in what McCulloch calls
“Hybrid Hip,” evocative of both Miami and London at the same time.
Among the disadvantages, the pool is shared with residents of the condo
complex in which the hotel is situated. But as a grace note, guests are car-
ried in a boat shuttle to a tranquil sandy beach nearby. The on-site
brasserie serves a fabulous antipasto buffet along with savory pastas and
pizzas; and the bar, Downstairs, is lively with lounge music. A hip crowd
of locals and visitors are attracted to it, including Prince Albert.

Hôtel Alexandra
$$
Monte Carlo
Close to the casino, the early 1900s Alexandra has an idyllic corner loca-
tion. The friendly reception makes you feel right at home. A recent reno-
vation cleaned up the beautiful facade and spruced up the 56 rooms, which
are spacious and comfortable, although some are dark. They include
modern modular wall units forming desks and closets and extras such as
soundproof windows, minibars, and hairdryers. The rooms with French

balconies open onto street views. The continental breakfast is served only
in the rooms.

Hôtel de France
$
Monte Carlo
Not all Monégasques are rich, as a stroll along rue de la Turbie will attest:
On this street are some of the cheapest eats and sleeps in the high-priced
principality. The 19th-century Hôtel de France, just three minutes from the
rail station, offers 26 rooms, modestly furnished, but well kept and com-
fortable. The guest rooms and bathrooms are small, and each unit has a
shower.

Hôtel de Paris
$$$$
Monte Carlo
One of Europe’s grandest hotels, Hotel de Paris, built in 1864, sits beside
the famous casino on Monte Carlo’s central square. The elaborate facade
is a beaux-arts wonder surpassed only by the gilded lobby with marble
columns, classical statuary, crystal chandeliers, and frescoes. The 191
high-ceilinged accommodations are individually decorated with antiques
and stylish accessories, and many have balconies. The hotel features four
restaurants: Alain Ducasse’s Louis XV, the Grill, the Restaurant Salle
Empire, and the Côté Jardin. Le Bar Américain is a sophisticated piano bar.
The hotel is connected to Thermes Marins, an ultramodern seawater ther-
apy spa. The hotel also offers an indoor pool, saunas, and a fitness center.
Guests are given a gold card allowing free access to the casino and the
Monte Carlo Beach Club, with its private pool and beach. The card also
offers a 50 percent discount at the Monte Carlo Country Club, with 23
tennis courts and the golf club.

La Condamine
Hôtel Helvetia is the best inexpensive hotel in Monaco, with a good loca-
tion just steps from rue Princesse-Caroline, a 4-block-long cafe-lined pedes-
trian street leading to the port. The hotel also is only a short walk from
place d’Armes, where Monaco’s outdoor food market is open Saturday
mornings. Of its 25 rooms, 19 have private bathrooms. For breakfast in the

pleasant street-front dining room, you can choose from a continental or

Hôtel Hermitage
$$$$
Monte Carlo
Second only to the Hôtel de Paris (see earlier in this section), the
Hermitage is a glistening beaux-arts palace, with a location high on the
precipice. Like the Paris, the Hermitage is owned by the Société des Bains
de Mer, an organization founded in 1863 to develop Monte Carlo. The
facade, facing the port and the sea, has an Italian-style loggia and vaulting
with ceiling frescoes. Inside is a Winter Garden, built by Gustave Eiffel, with
a Tiffany-type stained-glass dome. The lovely 280 rooms, including 20
suites, are decorated in period décor in the central part or in a cheerful
contemporary style in the newer wings. Many of the rooms have balconies
with wicker furniture. You have access to the attached seawater therapy
spa (also attached to the Paris), with a large pool. The restaurant and bar
Le Vistamar opens onto a beautiful terrace that is the best place to have
a drink in Monaco. Guests are given a gold card allowing free access to the
casino and the Monte Carlo Beach Club, with its private pool and beach.
The card also offers a 50 percent discount at the Monte Carlo Country
Club, with 23 tennis courts and the golf club.

Le Fairmont Monte Carlo
$$$–$$$$
Monte Carlo
In a feat of daring engineering and questionable aesthetics, the 619-room
Grand was built over the water at the edge of Monte Carlo. To fit six floors
of rooms, the ceilings are on the low side, particularly in the lobby, so the
impression of grandness is limited. Nevertheless, this is a top-notch hotel
with a down-to-earth quality and a friendly staff. A country French décor
and a liberal use of wicker brighten up the rooms, many of which have bal-
conies overlooking the sea. The hotel contains two restaurants:
l’Argentine, serving Italian food, grilled steaks, and seafood; and Le Pistou,
an upscale Provençal restaurant. On the premises also are the Sun Casino;
a patisserie; a cafe; a fitness center; and, on the rooftop, a heated fresh-
water pool.

Dining locally
The national dish of Monaco is stocafi, a heavy stockfish dish prepared
with olive oil, onions, tomatoes, white wine, potatoes, black olives, and
cognac. Pissaladière is a pizza with onions, and barbagiuan is a stuffed
dumpling with rice, squash, leeks, eggs, and cheese. Beignet de fleur de
courgettes are batter-fried zucchinis stuffed with veal and cheese. And a
special Monaco aperitif is pastis Casanis, a local brand of pastis, which is
an anise-flavored liqueur.
Baccarat
$–$$$$
Monte Carlo
ITALIAN
Established late in 2002 as one of Monaco’s most upscale and elegant
restaurants, Baccarat is a sedate testimonial to the flavors and presenta-
tions of Italy, with a special emphasis on Sicily, birthplace of owner and
chef Carmelo Gulletta. In a vaguely Art Deco ambience with high-backed
cardinal-red chairs, a not particularly riveting view over the street, and off-
white walls lined with the avant-garde paintings of Monégasque painter
Clérissy, you’ll enjoy a cuisine that the owners say is more Italian, and less
Monégasques, than anything else in Monaco. The dining room is super-
vised by Guletta’s France-born, English-speaking wife, Patricia. The
antipasto selection is the best in the principality, ranging from steamed
asparagus with hollandaise to an Andalusian gazpacho. The chefs turn out
risottos as good as any found in Italy, along with Monaco’s most enticing
pastas, especially a savory spaghetti with baby clams. Fish dishes such as
sole meunière are generally better than the meat and poultry offerings.

Café de Paris
$–$$$
Monte Carlo
FRENCH
Its plats du jour are well prepared, and its location, the plaza adjacent to
the casino and the Hôtel de Paris, provides you with a front-row view of the
comings and goings of the nerve center of Monte Carlo. But to our tastes,
this 1985 re-creation of old-time Monaco is a bit too theme-ish, a bit too
enraptured with the devil-may-care glamour of early-1900s Monte Carlo.
Despite that, Café de Paris continues to draw patrons who appreciate the
razzmatazz and all the glass and chrome. Menu items change frequently,
and local office workers appreciate the platters, because they can be
served and consumed relatively quickly, with dishes such as fresh grilled
sea bass and steak tartare with matchstick frites. Adjacent to the restau-
rant, you’ll find (and hear) a jangling collection of slot machines and a
cliché-riddled cluster of boutiques selling expensively casual resort wear
and souvenirs.

several large tables of Italians. The movie theme extends to the interior
walls, which are painted with names of classic movies. Most of the seating
is outside, where you can sit on director’s chairs under brightly colored
umbrellas and enjoy a cool breeze blowing off the port. Skip the fish
dishes, and stick with the specialty: homemade pasta. The restaurant also
serves good pizza priced at 11€ ($14), made the Italian way with thin
crust, easy on the tomato sauce, and lots of garlic.

This restaurant near the palace has been serving hearty Italian home cook-
ing since 1973. The owner, Enzo, displays a certain sang-froid, not to say
crankiness, but he means well. The restaurant has tables outside, under
awnings, on the narrow street; inside seating is cozy, with tables forming
two long rows along the walls. The specialties of the chef (whose ingredi-
ents are the freshest) are risotto, ravioli Pinocchio (homemade and stuffed
with meat), and spaghetti with shrimp.

Louis XV
$$$$
Monte Carlo
PROVENÇAL/TUSCAN
This golden palace is one of the best restaurants in the world. The restau-
rant offers haute cuisine in a resplendent if imposing setting, and that
means astronomical prices. Chef Alain Ducasse, who has his hand in many
other restaurants in Paris, London, New York, and Japan, is the maestro
behind the operation. He calls the cuisine “southern flavors and
Mediterranean cuisine.” You can choose from two menus at every meal or
order à la carte: The more expensive menu, “Pour les Gourmets,” offers
meat and fish choices, and the “Jardin de Provence” is closer to a veg-
etarian menu. The menus change seasonally to reflect the freshest ingredi-
ents. A typically delectable first course is légumes des jardins de Provence
mijotés à la truffe noire rapée (garden vegetables of Provence simmered
Chapter 20: Nice, Monaco, and Beyond 419

with grated black truffles). For a main course, the chef recommends

La Condamine
BRASSERIE
Artists and creative types hang out at this Parisian-style bar/brasserie/
restaurant on the west side of the harbor. Not surprisingly, the restaurant
offers lots of outdoor seating, so you can watch the yachts come and go.
The inside is sleek and stylish, with a long inviting bar. Standouts include
the special preparation of suprême poulet fermier (tender breast of farm-
raised chicken roasted with lemon verbena and crisp young leeks) and the
carpaccio of tuna Japanese style, served with eggplant caviar. For dessert,
try the homemade sorbets, with raspberry being the most popular flavor.

Exploring the principality
Monaco has five sections. Monaco Ville is the charming Old Town up on
“The Rock,” to the west of the harbor. Here you find the palace (where 
the changing of the guard takes place), the Oceanographic Museum and
Aquarium, the cathedral, the St-Martin Garden, and lots of shops and
restaurants. Monte Carlo, to the east of the harbor, is home to the famous
casino; fancy shops; and luxury hotels such as the Paris, the Hermitage,
and the Monte Carlo Grand. West of Old Town, Fontvieille is an industrial
suburb that was created by filling in a marshy area. Monaco’s car museum
is located in this neighborhood. La Condamine, the center of Monaco in
front of the Port d’Hercule, boasts lots of shops and restaurants, and
some inexpensive hotels. Larvotto, on the far east end of the principality,
has a good stretch of public beach called Plage du Larvotto and the
Grimaldi Forum, where conferences and events take placed.
With commentary in English, the red-and-white tourist train Azur
Express (% 92-05-64-38) winds through the Old Town and travels to
Monte Carlo in 30 minutes round-trip. From April to mid-November (no
service rest of year), the train arrives at and departs from the Musée
Océanographique in Monaco Ville every half-hour daily 10 a.m. to 5 p.m.
The fare is 7€ ($9.10) adults, and 4€ ($5.20) children ages 2 to 8.

Monaco’s royal palace
Palais du Prince (place du Palais; % 93-25-18-31), got a new ruler in
2006 upon the death of Prince Rainier who had lived here for so many
years with Grace Kelly. Upon his father’s death, Prince Albert became
the reigning prince. The palace has a defensive appearance, betraying its
beginnings as a 13th-century fortress. In the 15th century, the Grimaldis
transformed it into a royal palace, and in the late 16th century, they
hired Italian artists to decorate the property (the courtyard and interior
still bear this heavy Italian Renaissance influence). A guide leads you on
a half-hour tour through a dozen finely furnished rooms, including the
throne room. You can see marble floors and stairways, 16th-century fres-
coes, paneled walls, and even a hall of mirrors (a smaller version of the
one at Versailles). The large official portrait of the present-day Grimaldis
is in one of the last rooms on the tour: Albert wears a tennis sweater,
while Caroline and Stephanie are in ballgowns; the painting within the
painting is a larger-than-life portrait of Princess Grace, looking super-
naturally serene. These days Albert occupies the palace, as Caroline and
Stephanie make their homes elsewhere. In season, you may find long
lines here daily. The Palais is open daily: April 10:30 a.m. to 6 p.m.;
October 10 a.m. to 5:30 p.m.; May to September 9:30 a.m. to 6:30 p.m.;
closed November to December.
The best time to visit is early or late in the day, and the worst time to
visit is after the changing of the guard, when crowds are at their peak.
Crowds form early for the 11:55 a.m. changing of the guard in front of the
palace, which lasts less than ten minutes. For a good view, arrive at least
20 minutes before the event.
In another wing of the palace, Musée des Souvenirs Napoléoniens et
Archives (% 93-25-18-31) is a small museum containing some interest-
ing Napoléon materials, such as the hat he wore on Elba (the site of
Napoléon’s first exile), a piece of mahogany from his coffin, and his
death mask in bronze. An entertaining description by Napoléon of the
harrowing birth of his son also can be seen. While his second wife,
Marie-Louise, endured 26 hours of hard labor, she shouted at Napoléon,
“You want to sacrifice me for the sake of my son?” The museum also fea-
tures exhibits about the history of Monaco. Most exhibits have English
translations.
Admission to the palace is 7€ ($9.10) for adults, 3.50€ ($4.55) ages 8 to
14, and free for those younger than age 7. Admission to the museum is
4€ ($5.20) for adults, 2€ ($2.60) for children 8 to 14, and free for children
younger than 8. The palace is open June to September daily 9:30 a.m. to 
6 p.m.; October daily 10 a.m. to 5 p.m.; closed otherwise. The museum is
open May to September daily 9:30 a.m. to 6:30 p.m., and December to
May 10:30 a.m. to 12:30 p.m. and 2 to 5 p.m. English-speaking tours are
available.

Museums and other sights
Built on the edge of a cliff overlooking the sea, Musée Océanographique
(av. St-Martin; % 93-15-36-00; www.oceano.mc) occupies a beautiful
beaux-arts building and includes one of Europe’s largest aquariums.
Prince Rainier I, great-grandfather of the present ruler, built this museum
in 1910 to house his extensive collections from sea travels and explo-
rations. The aquarium has 3,000 fish, including many rare species and a
coral reef from the Red Sea. Don’t miss the elegant polka-dot grouper
named after Grace Kelly (merou de Grace Kelly), the aquarium’s oldest
fish (a fierce moray eel caught off Antibes in 1968), or the decisive
Napoléon fish. The whale room shelters whaling boats and skeletons of
their victims. One skeleton is from a fin whale that washed up on the
Italian coast some months after the prince harpooned him in 1896. Other
interesting exhibits are the “first submarine,” a tortoise-shaped vessel
built by American David Bushnell and used during the American
Revolution. The museum also shows fun 19th-century films of the
research ship Princesse Alice and its crew (the prince is the one in the
straw boater and walrus mustache). The exotic fish and the incredible
history displays are sure to keep every member of your family enter-
tained. The museum is open daily (except the Sun of the Grand Prix
race) April through September 9 a.m. to 7:30 p.m. and October to March
10 a.m. to 6 p.m. Admission is 11€ ($14) for adults and 6€ ($7.80) for
children from 6 to 18 years old and students.
Two attractions are on the side of a rocky cliff on the west end of
Monaco: the Jardin Exotique and the Musée d’Anthropologie
Préhistorique de Monaco (62 bd. du Jardin-Exotique; % 93-15-29-80). 
In 1912, Prince Albert I created, in the Jardin Exotique, a strange world
with thousands of blooming cacti, including rare species and giant cacti
more than 100 years old. You wander over paths and bridges with
panoramic views of Monaco and the sea. Among other unusual plants is
the elephant-eared kalanchoe, with large velvety leaves used by mothers
in Madagascar to carry their babies. Near the bottom of the gardens are
caves reachable by 300 steps. You can visit the caves, filled with stalac-
tites and stalagmites forming natural sculptures, by guided tour, on 
the hour daily 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. Also on the property is the Musée
d’Anthropologie, with more collections of the intellectually curious
Albert I. These anthropology exhibits prove that even Cro-Magnon man
liked the Côte d’Azur. Apparently, archaeologists found prehistoric skele-
tons, including two people embracing, in the nearby caves, as well as
cave paintings. The museum also houses taxidermy of bear, bison, and
moose. Scientists discovered evidence that bears and panthers lived in
the caves on the rocks. The garden and museum are open daily (except
Nov 19 and Dec 25) mid-May to mid-September 9 a.m. to 7 p.m. and late
September to early May 9 a.m. to 6 p.m.
Built in 1875, the Cathédrale de Monaco at 4 rue Colonel Bellando 
de Castro in Monaco-Ville (% 93-30-87-70) is where Princess Grace is
buried. You can pay homage at her tomb, marked by an inscribed stone
Part VI: Provence and the Riviera 
422

(Gracia Patricia Principis Rainerii III) and bushels of roses. The cathedral
was built in 1875 in a part-Romanesque, part-Byzantine style.
The tiny Musée de la Chapelle de la Visitation (place de la Visitation;
% 93-50-07-00) contains the personal collection of Barbara Piasecka
Johnson: 17th-century paintings, about 20 of them, including works by
Rubens, Zubaran, and Ribera. The works are exhibited in a baroque style
17th-century chapel, a brightly lit room with marble floors and columns.
The museum is open Tuesday to Sunday 10 a.m. to 4 p.m., and admis-
sion is 3€ ($3.90) adults, 1.50€ ($1.95) children ages 6 to 18.
The late Prince Rainier’s antique car museum, Collection des Voitures
Anciennes de S.A.S Prince de Monaco (Les Terrasses de Fontvieille; 
% 92-05-28-56), contains about 105 shiny vehicles, including the 1956
Rolls-Royce Silver Cloud that Prince Rainier and Princess Grace rode on
their wedding day. The museum is open daily 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. (except
Dec 25). Admission is 6€ ($7.80) for adults and 3€ ($3.90) for children 8
to 14 and students.
Musée National de Monaco (17 av. Princesse-Grace; % 93-30-91-26) dis-
plays a large collection of dolls and automatons made in Paris in the late
19th century. The dolls are presented in showcases with period furni-
ture, chinaware, and other items of daily life. A dollhouse villa designed
by Charles Garnier, the architect who designed the Paris and Monaco
opera houses, also is displayed. The museum also plays host to tempo-
rary exhibitions that are sure to please kids of any age — one recent
show featured Barbie dolls wearing dresses created by international
designers. The museum is open daily (except Jan 1, May 1, Nov 19, and
Dec 25) April through September 10 a.m. to 6:30 p.m. and October to
Easter 10 a.m. to 12:15 p.m. and 2:30 to 6:30 p.m. Admission is 6€ ($7.80)
for adults and 3.50€ ($4.55) for children 6 to 14 and students.
Shopping for local treasures
Monaco’s food market takes place daily 7 a.m. to noon on place d’Armes
(6 Le Marché de la Condamine) at the top of rue Grimaldi. A flea market
is open Saturdays from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. at the Port de Fontvieille. All the
designer boutiques — including Cartier, Louis Vuitton, Yves St-Laurent,
Chanel, and Gucci — are located in Monte Carlo in the rue des Beaux-
Arts near the grand hotels. The best shopping street, with unique stores,
in La Condamine is pedestrian rue Princesse-Caroline, starting at rue
Grimaldi and stretching 3 blocks to the port.
The best of the small boutiques are Sorasio Fleurs, an elegant flower
shop at 6 av. des Beaux-Arts in the Hôtel de Paris (% 93-30-71-01);
Boutique du Rocher, at 1 av. de la Madone (% 93-30-91-17) and 11 rue
Emile de Loth (% 93-30-33-99), the official store of the Princess Grace
charitable foundation, selling art and handcrafts; and Yves Delorme, at
Centre Commercial le Métropole (% 93-50-08-70), for luxurious house-
wares, linens, clothing, gift objects, and fashion.
Chapter 20: Nice, Monaco, and Beyond 423

Living it up after dark
Casino de Monte Carlo (place du Casino; % 92-16-20-00) was once a
very formal place (you may remember its cameo appearance in the I
Love Lucy episode where Lucy wins a fortune here by accident). Today,
busloads of disheveled visitors trip up the marble steps to play the one-
armed bandits. But the casino does have more formal private rooms,
where you won’t find electronic gaming, and a jacket and tie are required
after 10 p.m. for men. To enter the gaming rooms, you must be 18, pre-
sent a passport or driver’s license, and pay 10€ ($13) for the Salons
Européens (opening at noon) or 20€ ($26) for the Salons Privés (opening
at 4 p.m.). Salons Privés are extraordinary, with muraled walls and fres-
coed ceilings; it’s actually worth going in and gawking. The casino’s Les
Monte Carlo Follies Cabaret (% 92-16-36-36), around the left side of the
building, plays host to Vegas-style nightclub shows from mid-September
to the end of June, Wednesday to Saturday 10 to 11:30 p.m. Admission is
40€ ($52) and includes one drink; dinner plus the show costs 62€ ($81).
If you prefer more sophisticated entertainment, the place to see con-
certs, ballet, and opera is the Opéra de Monte-Carlo, a beaux-arts opera
house that’s also part of the casino building. For tickets and information,
call Atrium du Casino at % 92-16-22-99 or stop by the box office daily 
10 a.m. to 5:30 p.m. Tickets run 35€ to 115€ ($46–$150).
Fun bars in Monaco include Sass Café (11 av. Princesse-Grace; % 93-25-
52-00), which has a piano bar, and Quai des Artistes (4 quai Antoine-1er
on the port; % 97-97-97-77), attracting a young after-dinner crowd to
the large bar area (see “Dining locally,” earlier in this section).
Finally, for insight into the terribly fashionable, terribly blasé, and terri-
bly jaded nocturnal pleasures of the Monégasques, consider dropping
into Jimmy’z, in Le Sporting Monte Carolo, 26 av. Princesse-Grace 
(% 92-16-22-77). Acquired by Monaco’s Société des Bains de Mer, it
boasts metallic walls, dozens of potted plants, deep upholsteries, a 
decorative lagoon, and a roof that opens wide during warm weather for
a view of the moon and stars. Entrance is free, but once you’re inside,
you’ll be strongly encouraged to order a drink, or perhaps several, with
whisky priced at 39€ ($51) each. It’s open nightly from 11 p.m. to around
4 a.m. From October to May, it’s closed Monday and Tuesday. Men are
encouraged to wear jackets or at least long-sleeved shirts.
St-Jean-Cap-Ferrat and the Rothschild Villa
You may equate the name “Cap-Ferrat” with images of extreme opulence,
but the village of St-Jean-Cap-Ferrat is really just a small touristy fishing
port with a dozen reasonably priced restaurants bordering the harbor
and a handful of little boutiques nearby. The real estate on this lush
peninsula is among the Riviera’s priciest. At the tip of the peninsula, 3km
(2 miles) from the port, is one of the area’s most expensive and luxurious
Part VI: Provence and the Riviera 
424

hotels, Grand Hôtel du Cap-Ferrat. The Rothschild villa, on the highest
and most central spot on the peninsula, is a fascinating museum that
illustrates life in the Belle Epoque era and is surrounded by magnificent
French gardens.
Getting there
The village of Cap-Ferrat is about a mile from the nearest train station at
Beaulieu (see “Beaulieu and the Villa Kérylos,” later in this chapter); it’s
a scenic walk along the bay. For train information, call % 08-92-35-35-39
or 36-35. With no bus service available from the center of Beaulieu to the
village of Cap-Ferrat, you need to take a taxi (11€/$14), if you don’t have
a car.
Nice is about 4km (6 miles) away, and buses frequently make the half-
hour trip at a cost of 1.30€ ($1.70). The bus between Nice and Cap-
Ferrat, the no. 81, runs from Monday to Saturday (not holidays).
Aéroport Nice Côte d’Azur is 20 minutes (21km/13 miles) from Cap-
Ferrat. You can rent a car from the airport or take a shuttle bus to the
center of Nice and pick up a bus to Cap-Ferrat from the Nice bus station.
Monaco is 16km (10 miles) away from Cap-Ferrat, while Cannes is 40km
(26 miles) away. To drive to Cap-Ferrat from Nice, take N7 east.
Getting around and getting information
You really need a car for Cap-Ferrat — mainly to arrive and depart from
the peninsula. Villa Ephrussi de Rothschild is technically within walking
distance (about 20 minutes) from the village, but access is from a busy
road with a narrow sidewalk and then up a long winding driveway with
no sidewalk. If you stay at a hotel near the harbor, you can walk to
restaurants and shopping, but the car still comes in handy to explore
the peninsula by driving through the steep residential area, out to the
Grand Hôtel. You can also take long walks along coastal paths on Cap-
Ferrat. The tourist office is at 59 av. Denis-Séméria (% 04-93-76-08-90;
www.ville-saint-jean-cap-ferrat.fr). During July and August, 
the office is open daily 9 a.m. to 7 p.m.; September to June, hours are
Monday to Friday 9 a.m. to noon and 1 to 5 p.m. The tourist office offers
free trail maps for exploring the peninsula on foot.

One of the Riviera’s grandest hotels is Grand Hotel du Cap-Ferrat. As
reflected in its name and prices, they don’t nickel and dime you here:
Admission to the pool is included. It’s a mirror of heated salt water that
seems to float just above the Mediterranean (pool admission is charged
at the Eden Roc in Antibes; see Chapter 21). And the staff is quite friendly.
All is palatial at the Grand, from the lobby, with its inlaid marble floor and

Hôtel Brise Marine

St-Jean-Cap-Ferrat
By virtue of its location in the Old Town, a few blocks up from the harbor,
this is the best choice for a medium-priced hotel. The 17-room circa 1870
Brise Marine is a very attractive pale-yellow villa set high, with panoramic
views of the Riviera coast all the way to Italy. It’s also quite near Paloma
Plage, one of the two public beaches. The high-ceilinged rooms are pretty
and fresh, some with balconies; the eight rooms with views are more
expensive. Breakfast is served in the large stone courtyard overlooking
the sea. The same family has owned and operated the hotel since 1945.

St-Jean-Cap-Ferrat
This 16-room hotel is a lovely, very large early-20th-century villa with two
outbuildings (one originally constructed as a garage). The location, high
in the central part of the peninsula in a residential area, means you’re
somewhat isolated. The walk to town or the beaches is long, so access to
a car is critical if you stay here. The rooms range in size: A modern 1970s-
era annex has simple smaller rooms, and the pavilion has the largest
rooms, such as Hibiscus, with a balcony and huge bath. The hotel is sur-
rounded by a dense canopy of trees, so is has no water views.

Hôtel La Voile d’Or

La Voile d’Or is luxurious and down-to-earth — perhaps it’s the sight of
the gregarious owner, who has run the hotel for nearly 50 years, walking
around in casual clothes and checking on the comfort of guests. Or it could
be the dining room, which, though lovely, has a distinct beachy-ness. The
45 rooms, perched above the harbor, actually have more interesting views
than those at the Grand Hôtel (see earlier in this section); they look out
over the sweep of coastline from Beaulieu to Monaco. The rooms are the
height of elegance and comfort — all have Florentine-inspired furniture,
and most have French doors leading to terraces. You can easily walk to
the village and portside restaurants. The hotel offers garden terraces for
dining, in addition to a cheerful dining room with wraparound windows.
The heated pool is above the harbor and sea, and a private beach is a
short walk down the embankment.

The restaurant here is extravagance defined, and the stellar service can’t

or inside in the lavishly decorated dining room. Chef Jean-Claude Guillon
has a solid reputation, and you’ll have to put yourself in his hands,
because the menu detailing unusual ingredients and preparations is likely
to leave even an expert translator perplexed. The famous lamb for two,
carré d’agneau des Alpes du sud rôti et gratinée au pistou (rack of lamb from
the Alps roasted and browned with basil-and-garlic sauce), is delectable,
as are the tournedos of beef, layered with foie gras façon Rossini. Especially
charming is a platter containing three separate salads, each concocted
from some combination of freshwater crayfish and Canadian lobster.

St-Jean-Cap-Ferrat
PROVENÇAL
Of the dozen or so restaurants next to the harbor, this one gets the most
favorable reviews year after year. It’s a favorite of many guidebooks and
Gourmet magazine — so it tends to fill up first. The décor is yacht-club
attractive, with blue-and-white chairs and awning, and the waiters are
snappily dressed in black and white. Not surprisingly, fish is the thing here.
The delightful quenelle de sole (sole dumpling) is often on the menu, as is
the whole roasted turbot with mushroom sauce. For dessert, the restau-
rant features homemade ice cream.

Exploring the villa and beaches
Villa Ephrussi de Rothschild (rue Ephrussi de Rothschild; % 04-93-01-
33-09; www.villa-ephrussi.com) is one of the Riviera’s most beautiful
villas. In 1912, the highly eccentric Béatrice Ephrussi, baronne de
Rothschild (1864–1934), built this pink-and-white Italianate mansion,
with Italian Renaissance influences, at the peninsula’s highest point and
named it Ile de France after her favorite ship. Béatrice, born a Rothschild, 
was the daughter of a Banque de France director and wife of the wealthy
banker Maurice Ephrussi. She discovered Cap-Ferrat in 1905 and bought
about 7 hectares (18 acres) on which to build her dream villa. The proj-
ect took seven years, involving 20 to 40 architects. The baronne pur-
chased exquisite antiques, memorabilia from the ancien régime,
frescoes, and artwork from all around the world. Equally remarkable are
the property’s seven themed gardens: Spanish, Florentine, lapidary,
Japanese, exotic, Provençal French, and the rose garden (which is at its
best in May). Ironically, Béatrice, with homes in Paris and Monaco (her
preferred home), never spent much time here. She left the villa, along
with its collections, to the Académie des Beaux-Arts de l’Institut de
France, which now runs the museum. You can have lunch or a snack in
the tearoom, with views of the port of Villefranche, or on a terrace sur-
rounded by the gardens. You can tour the downstairs with a brochure in
English, but the upstairs rooms require a guide and cost an extra 2€
($2.60). Mid-February through October, hours are daily from 10 a.m. to 
6 p.m. (until 7 p.m. July–Aug); November to mid-February, hours are

children younger than 7 free. Guided tours of the second floor (in
French) are given at 11:30 a.m. and 2:30, 3:30, and 4:30 p.m. and cost an
extra 2€ ($2.60).
Take your kids to the Grand Hôtel du Cap-Ferrat’s pool for the day,
open daily 2:30 to 7 p.m. for outside guests. The daily rate is 60€ ($78)
for adults and 40€ ($52) for children, while the half-day rate (charged
after 2 p.m.) is 45€ ($59) for adults and 25€ ($33) for children. Day rates

with two beds; a massage is 95€ ($124), and a swimming lesson is 95€
($124). Club Dauphine is the poolside restaurant.
It’s difficult to actually see the sandy beaches of Cap-Ferrat, because
almost every inch of sand is taken up by the beach chairs lined up by
the beach concession. Nevertheless, these attractive warm-water
beaches have views of the sweeping coastline and mountains. Plage de
Passable (chemin de Passable; % 04-93-76-06-17) is on the west side of
the peninsula, less than a mile from the village. Concessions include a
bar, a restaurant open for lunch and dinner, and an ice-cream stand.
Plage Paloma (route de St-Hospice; % 04-93-01-64-71) is in a pretty spot
on the east side of the island just past the port (a five-minute walk from
town), with views of the coastline and Beaulieu. Restaurants and conces-
sions are beachside. Both beaches have free parking.
Beaulieu and the Villa Kérylos
Beaulieu, between Monaco (4km/6 miles east) and Nice (4km/6 miles
west), is a small beach resort that features side-by-side Relais &
Châteaux deluxe hotels. Although there’s not much to do in Beaulieu
besides enjoy the beautiful Mediterranean beaches, it has one sight
worth a special trip: the faux-Greek Villa Kérylos. The Berlugans (people
from Beaulieu) are a friendly crowd, so this is a nice place to base your-
self for day trips to Monaco, Nice, and Cap-Ferrat.
Getting there
Beaulieu is a stop on the Riviera’s main train line, which has frequent
service to Nice and Monaco. The train station, Gare SNCF, is located at
place Georges-Clémenceau in the center of town. For train information
or reservations, call % 08-92-35-35-39. Buses traveling a coastal route to

Exploring the villa and beaches
Théodore Reinach (1860–1928) created his dream house at the tip of a
rocky promontory jutting into the sea and named it the Villa Kérylos
(rue Gustave-Eiffel; % 04-93-01-01-44; www.villa-kerylos.com). An
archaeologist, man of letters, and scholar of ancient Greece, Reinach
wanted his home to replicate a Greek villa from the 2nd century B.C. So
the house, built from 1902 to 1908, is a completely unique mingling of
early-1900s techniques with ancient Greek sensibility; it’s a fun and fasci-
nating combination. Reinach wanted to eat, sleep, and party like the
Greeks, so his dining room chairs are vertical chaise longues for reclin-
ing next to three-legged tables. His bed is framed by fluted columns, and
his marble bathtub can fit ten men. The villa has mosaics, frescoes, and
reproductions of artworks from Pompeii and ancient Greece. A gallery of
antiquities is in the stone basement, which is surrounded by windows
Chapter 20: Nice, Monaco, and Beyond 433

level with the sea. You can watch windsurfers while admiring copies of
famous statues such as the Venus de Milo and the Discus Thrower. After
touring the house, stroll through the garden, and have a bite to eat at
the cafe. From February 11 to November 3, the villa is open daily 10 a.m.
to 6 p.m.; July and August, hours are daily 10 a.m. to 7 p.m.; November 4
to January 1, hours are Monday to Friday 2 to 6 p.m., Saturday and
Sunday 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. Admission is 8€ ($10) for adults and 6€ ($7.80)
for students and children ages 7 through 18.
The two beaches with concessions are Plage Petite Afrique off
Promenade Pasteur (no phone) and La Calanque at Baie des Fourmis
(% 04-93-01-45-00). These are attractive, if crowded, beaches. Plage
Petite Afrique, the easternmost, is a crescent-shaped beach dotted with
palm trees and lush vegetation.

 Walking the cobblestone streets of Vence and St-Paul-de-Vence
W
est of Nice, the French Riviera offers travelers seaside and inland
opportunities, from the Mediterranean sands near Cannes, Cap
d’Antibes, and St-Tropez to the quaint villages of Biot and Antibes to the
pedestrian-only hamlets of Vence and St-Paul-de-Vence. This chapter
explores the diversity of the western Riviera.
St-Tropez: Sun and Fun
Forget all the hype about topless bathing, hedonistic bar scenes, and
preening celebrities — St-Tropez is hands down the Riviera’s most
charming town, a pastel-colored fishing village that happens to be one of
the most glamorous spots on earth. Just don’t come in July or August,
when dense crowds make even a stroll in front of the yacht-filled harbor
nearly impossible. Unlike other Riviera towns, St-Tropez has a perfectly
preserved center — a colorful port unmarred by high-rise hotels and vir-
tually unchanged for more than a century. (For evidence, visit the port-
side Impressionist museum L’Annonciade to see the early-20th-century
images of St-Tropez.) Bustling cafes crowd the old port, and behind
them, the winding village streets beckon with exclusive boutiques and
romantic restaurants. All paths lead up to the citadel, a 16th-century fort
perched at the top of the town.
The beaches of St-Tropez are a lively scene — an integral part of the
Tropezienne experience. The most famous beaches are located several
miles from town and lined with restaurants and clubs. Pampelonne
Beach, on the peninsula’s southeast coast, is the most famous (or 

notorious) stretch of sand on the Riviera. After a day on the beach, it’s
time to gear up for a memorable dinner and a taste of St-Tropez after
dark. The crowd is young and starts out late: Dinner is at 10 p.m., and
bar hopping begins shortly thereafter. If you aren’t into the bar scene,
you may enjoy strolling along the old port or people-watching from one
of the portside cafes.
Getting there
St-Tropez is difficult to get to without a car (no trains stop there) or
even with a car. Plan on at least a half-day of travel to reach the resort.
Summer traffic onto the peninsula can be bumper-to-bumper for miles.
The closest major bus-and-train hub is St-Raphaël, 38km (24 miles) east
of St-Tropez. Bus fares from Cannes to St-Raphaël require a change at the
agrarian hamlet of Le Trayas, take about 70 minutes of travel time, and
cost 6.80€ ($8.85) each way. Continuing on by bus from St-Raphaël to 
St-Tropez costs an additional 3€ ($3.90). For information and schedules,
call either Raphaël Bus at % 04-94-83-87-63 or Société beltrame at 
% 04-94-95-95-16.
St-Raphaël is on the main coastal train line for the Riviera. A train from
Nice to St-Raphaël takes between 50 and 75 minutes and costs 10€ to
12€ ($13–$16); trains from Cannes to St-Raphaël take 22 minutes and
cost 6€ to 8€ ($7.80–$10). Other nearby train stations are at Toulon
(60km/37 miles) and Marseille (134km/83 miles). For train information,
call % 08-92-35-35-39 or 3635 within France.
Transports Maritimes Raphaëlois (% 04-94-95-17-46) runs a shuttle
boat service between St-Raphaël and St-Tropez. Boats run daily (July
and Aug), taking one hour and costing 12€ ($16) one-way. From April 
to June and in September and October, only two shuttle boats travel
between St-Raphaël and St-Tropez each week. St-Tropez is about 20 min-
utes by boat from St-Maxime (14km/9 miles east of St-Tropez), and two
companies make shuttle boat trips between them daily (in season):
Transports Maritimes (% 04-94-55-09-92), running from April to
November 4, and Les Bateaux Verts, which run year-round (% 04-94-
49-29-39). Both charge 12€ ($15) for adults and 6.30€ ($8.20) for chil-
dren ages 4 to 12.
The major airports (and distances) nearest St-Tropez are the Aéroport
Toulon-Hyères (56km/35 miles), Aéroport International de Nice Côte
d’Azur (91km/57 miles), Aéroport International de Marseille-Provence
(115km/72 miles), and Aeroport St-Tropez-La Môle (15km/9 miles). La
Môle, located to the northwest of St-Tropez is a relatively new landing
strip, suitable only for small planes whose arrival and departure rituals
may remind you of equivalent small-plane “puddle jumps” throughout the
Caribbean. The airports have offices for all major car-rental agencies. A
taxi from the Nice airport to St-Tropez costs a whopping average of 180€
to 225€ ($234–$293) each way for up to four passengers. The distance
from the other airports to St-Tropez makes a rental car your best option.
Part VI: Provence and the Riviera 
436

A good time to visit St-Tropez is during the Voiles de St-Tropez, a week-
long competition in late September and early October, when a flotilla of
antique sailboats — some of them among the most photographed in the
Mediterranean — sail furiously around an obstacle course defined by a
network of carefully positioned buoys anchored offshore. For details,
contact the tourist office or the Société Nautique de St-Tropez (% 04-
94-97-30-54; www.snst.org).
Getting around and getting information
The area around St-Tropez is hilly, but you can bike to most of the
beaches on the peninsula. A scooter is a good way to get to the beaches
of Pampelonne, which are further away. You can rent bikes, scooters, and
motorbikes at Holiday Bikes (14 av. du Général-Leclerc; % 04-94-97-
09-39); Espace 83 (2 av. du Général-Leclerc; % 04-94-55-80-00), scooters
and motorbikes only; or Location Mas (3 rue Quaranta; % 04-94-97-00-60).
Rentals start at 12€ ($16) per day for bikes; motorbikes and scooters
start at 34€ ($44) per day. These shops usually are open daily 9 a.m. to 
7 p.m. from June to September. They don’t close for a lunchtime break.
You can rent a car, scooter, or bike at Locazur, located at 9 route des
Plages, near the Plage de Bouillabaisse (% 04-94-97-57-85). Car rentals
start at 69€ ($90) per day, scooters from 52€ ($68) per day.
About every half-hour daily 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. in summer, and mornings
only during the off season (Oct–May), beach shuttles, costing 2€
($2.60), leave from place des Lices to the beaches of Pampelonne and
Salins. If you drive to the beaches, you’ll have to pay around 3.50€
($4.55) for parking. Bear in mind that taxi fees in St-Tropez are very high.
The tourist office is at quai Jean-Jaurès (% 08-92-68-48-28; www.ot-
saint-tropez.com). It’s open daily July and August 9:30 a.m. to 8 p.m.,
April, June, and September 9:30 a.m. to 12:30 p.m. and 2 to 7 p.m., and
January to March and October 9 a.m. to 12:30 p.m. and 2 to 6 p.m. You
can pick up your e-mail and also enjoy a drink at La Girafe, 36 rue du
Portail neuf (% 04-94-97-13-09), which boasts six computers, costing
2.50€ ($3.25) for 15 minutes. Only a two-minute walk from the tourist
office, it is open daily from 10 a.m. to midnight.

St-Tropez
This government-rated four-star hotel, a cluster of stucco buildings
painted in cool Mediterranean colors and situated high above the village

The complex includes boutiques; restaurants; a bar; and the Caves du Roy

Hôtel de La Ponche

St-Tropez
Composed of four interconnected and luxuriously appointed fishermen’s
cottages, this is the smallest government-rated four-star hotel in St-Tropez,
with 18 rooms. On a narrow winding street in the heart of historic St-
Tropez, the rear overlooks the fishermen’s port, and the simple cottages
are imbued with an authentic charm. The pretty rooms sport designer
linens and antique lamps, and many have large private balconies with sea
views; others look out over the church tower and tiled roofs of the village.
The hotel has five suites that are ideal for families and a popular restaurant
on site with a large terrace overlooking the harbor. The Ponche is popular
with Americans, who seem to prefer its understated elegance to the more
ostentatious luxury at the Byblos. The hotel offers an unusual amenity for
late sleepers: Breakfast is served until 3 p.m.

Hôtel Ermitage
$–$$
St-Tropez
The most common comment about this hotel is that the 27 rooms are too
small. Nevertheless, the English-speaking staff is welcoming; the prices are
good; and the hotel, in business since the 1930s, is well situated at the top
of the hill, with views sweeping out over the village and the sea near the
exclusive Byblos. Some rooms have views over the gardens and out to sea;
others look toward the citadel, past a noisy road. All units are simple and
well maintained; the larger ones light and airy, with arched windows look-
ing out over rooftops to the sea. The hotel has an attractive garden, a
pretty bar area with a stone fireplace, and a patio overlooking the harbor.

Information
St-Tropez
Chapter 21: The Western Riviera: From St-Tropez to Cannes 439
from the center of town. Don’t let the bland exterior fool you: The high-
ceilinged rooms are cheerful, with tile floors, large windows, and wrought-
iron chandeliers. The units in the front of the hotel face the harbor and
have balconies with bay views. But despite soundproof windows, these
rooms are definitely noisier, as the hotel is on the main road into town.
The accommodations in the rear look onto the palm-tree-lined courtyard
where breakfast is served in good weather.

Hôtel le Baron Lodge
$–$$
St-Tropez
This 11-room hotel at the top of the hill near the entrance to the citadel
gardens has an ultracool feeling about it. The building also houses a cafe
and bar with African-themed décor, including wooden sculptures and
paintings on elephants. The rooms are light and airy, though small, and
some have French doors leading to tiny balconies. The location is good,
with a number of little restaurants, shops, and galleries on the nearby old
winding streets.

Hôtel Le Yaca
$$$–$$$$
St-Tropez
This quintessentially Mediterranean hotel, which is elegant yet cozy, has
28 rooms and suites in four adjoining historic houses, one of which was
occupied by Colette in 1827. All rooms are individually decorated in a
modern style, with touches such as marble fireplaces; some have terraces
or balconies with water views; others overlook St-Tropez’s winding streets
or an interior courtyard dotted with flowers. The least expensive rooms
are small but just as pretty as the expensive rooms. A fine Italian restau-
rant with terrace seating in summer is on site, and so is a good bar.
Breakfast is served in the poolside garden in summer. The English-speaking
management is extra-accommodating and professional.

Hôtel Sube
$$–$$$
St-Tropez
You can’t get any more centrally located than this 28-room second-floor
hotel on the old port behind the bronze statue of Vice-Admiral Pierre
André de Suffren. The rooms are simple and small, with perfect harbor
views. Dashing young sailors hang out in the nautical-themed bar, where
the balcony has a panoramic bay view. Alas, you won’t get a room here
unless you book way ahead. And don’t plan on getting to sleep until the
wee hours; your fellow guests like to party.

La Mistralee
$$–$$$$
St-Tropez
This ten-room hotel is one of the special boutique hotels of St-Tropez, con-
verted from a private manor into a luxury hotel in 2000. This 1850 villa is
the former vacation home of Alexandre, a famous Parisian hairdresser
born and reared in St-Tropez. His tastes ran to the baroque (the home is
full of opulent details), from elaborate ceiling moldings to festive wall
murals to gilded paneled walls. The rooms are spacious and decorated
with unusual antiques. The grounds are inviting: You follow a series of red-
ochre columns through a lush garden to a tiled pool with chaises under
Japanese umbrellas. Thick pool towels are stacked in wicker baskets in
the Roman villa-style pool house.

Dining locally
Auberge des Maures
$$
St-Tropez
PROVENÇAL
The seating capacity of this restaurant more than double in fair weather
when table are set up in the garden within sight of splashing fountains and
ornamental shrubbery. Adding to the drama is the dining room’s view of
a hardworking kitchen, where the staff wears black and churns out tempt-
ing platters completely based on fresh, seasonal ingredients. Starters,
including deep-fried zucchini blossoms; hearts of artichoke barigoule
(stuffed with mushrooms); and a medley of petits farcis (stuffed vegeta-
bles), are followed up by a menu of grilled fish and meats.
See map p. 439. 4 rue du Docteur-Boutin. % 04-94-97-01-50. Reservations recom-
mended. Main courses: 12€–25€ ($16–$33); prix fixe: 45€ ($59). AE, DC, MC, V. Open:
Daily 7:30 p.m.–1 a.m. Closed Dec–Mar.
Chez Joseph/Le Petit Joseph
$$–$$$$
St-Tropez
PROVENÇAL
These side-by-side restaurants are serviced by the same kitchen, and the
menus are quite similar. Le Petit Joseph is quieter and more romantic, with
low beamed ceilings, an Asian décor, and cozy banquettes. Chez Joseph,
where you sit with other patrons at long tables, tends to be completely
booked and packed at 10 p.m. Both restaurants offer outdoor seating, but
Le Petit has just a few tables; Chez features a large terrace. The traditional
yet creatively presented cuisine emphasizes fish; and the menu changes
often. For dessert, the parfait léger is a treat — vanilla custard with choco-
late powder on a cherry crumble with a scoop of cherry-vanilla ice cream
and fresh fruit.

Chez la Thailandaise
$$$
St-Tropez
THAI
For something a little different, try this atmospheric restaurant on the
harbor. The entrance is flanked by little stone elephants, and the décor
includes plenty of Asian touches, such as bamboo chairs. House special-
ties include sautéed duck with mushrooms and oyster sauce, chicken
salad with fresh ginger, and fresh squid and prawns with Thai herbs and
garlic. You also find the usual Thai dishes, such as crispy spring rolls and
pad Thai. Dessert is a plate of exotic fruit.

La Ponche
$$–$$$
St-Tropez
PROVENÇAL
This stylish restaurant in the chichi Hôtel de La Ponche boasts exceptional
food, service, and views — and it’s actually not as expensive as it may
seem. Located on the city’s ancient ramparts next to an old stone city gate,
it overlooks the sea and fishing port. Chef Christian Geay highlights sum-
mery dishes such as salade de crustaces à la vinaigrette de truffes (seafood
salad with truffles) and moules à la marinière (mussels with red sauce).
Filet de boeuf layered with foie gras is an enduring specialty. A favorite
dessert is nougat glace au coulis de framboise (nougat ice cream, which has
almonds and honey, with puréed strawberries).
See map p. 439. 3 rue des Ramparts (in the Hotel de La Ponche). % 04-94-97-02-53.
Reservations recommended. Main courses: 23€–36€ ($30–$47); prix fixe: 24€ ($31)

La Table du Marché
$$$
St-Tropez
PROVENÇAL/JAPANESE
This restaurant skillfully combines a Parisian-style bistro and tearoom,
replete with red-velvet banquettes and mirrors. Chef Christophe Leroy dis-
plays the day’s pastries in the window for those who drop in during the
morning or afternoon for coffee or tea; then he transforms the site into a
bustling restaurant during the lunch and dinner hours. Specialties include
spit-roasted organic chicken served with a rich and flavorful gratin of 
macaroni and cheese, or pan-fried red snapper with flap mushrooms.

St-Tropez
PROVENÇAL
Chef Laurent Tarridec runs the fanciest and most expensive restaurant in
town. It’s set on the second floor of a port-side building, and all tables open
onto harbor views. One prix fixe menu features an upscale version of a
bourride, a fish soup that’s a meal in itself, but slightly less lavish than a
full-fledged bouillabaisse. Other recommendable dishes are grenouilles
menunière (frogs’ legs) and épaule de lapin (rabbit), but preparations of
fresh fish, locally caught, are the specialty. The Grand Marnier soufflé is a
delight. In good weather, terrace seating is available.
See map p. 439. Tour du Portalet (on the old port). % 04-94-97-29-00. Reservations

Le Petit Charron
$–$$
St-Tropez
PROVENÇAL
Anne Violaine and Christian Benoit own this intimate, charming nautically
decorated restaurant. The small menu is not so much limited as it is
focused on a few items, each prepared perfectly. The fish soup and gaz-
pacho with mussels and herbs are fine summer fare. The main courses
always include freshly caught fish of the day, simply prepared, in addition
to a scallop risotto with truffles. If you’re looking for heartier fare, try the
lamb, beef, or duck served with delicacies such as cèpe mushrooms and
homemade gnocchi.
See map p. 439. 6 rue des Charrons. % 04-94-97-73-78. Reservations recommended.
Main courses: 18€–22€ ($23–$29). AE, MC, V. Open: Daily 7:30–9:30 p.m. Closed mid-
Nov to Dec 1, Jan 15–30, Feb 15–28, and Aug 1–15.

St-Tropez
PROVENÇAL
Fish lovers will be attracted by the sight of the live fish and lobsters in
tanks at the entrance. Most of the seating at this large harborside restau-
rant is in a glass-enclosed terrace, so you can do some people-watching in
any weather; however, the banquettes and wicker chairs are packed close
together. Try one of the multitiered seafood plates — the three-tiered
seafood plate (loaded with oysters, shrimp, clams, mussels, lobster, and
more) is an excellent choice. It is priced at 56€ ($73) per person, and
served to a minimum of only two diners at a time. You can get the famous
tarte tropezienne here, made just down the street at Sénéquier. And for
after your meal, the restaurant offers special coffees from New Guinea,
Ethiopia, Guatemala, and Haiti.

Spoon Byblos
$$$
St-Tropez
FRENCH/INTERNATIONAL
The creation of Alain Ducasse, considered by some the world’s greatest
chef, Spoon originally was launched in Paris and since has opened loca-
tions from London to the Riviera. It serves the cuisine of many cultures,
with produce mainly from the Mediterranean, but draws special inspiration
from the food of Catalonia, Andalusia, and Morocco. The restaurant opens
onto a circular bar made of blue-tinted glass and polished stainless steel.
Main courses include shrimp and squid consommé with a hint of jasmine
and orange, spicy king prawns on a skewer, delectable lamb couscous, or
spit-roasted John Dory. Top off a meal with the chef’s favorite cheesecake
or a slice of neapolitan with the taste of strawberry, vanilla, and pistachio.
The restaurant offers more than 300 wines from around the world.
See map p. 439. In the Hotel Byblos, av. Paul-Signac. % 04-94-56-68-20. Reservations
required. Main courses: 30€–38€ ($39–$49). AE, DC, MC, V. Open: June–Sept 
8 p.m.–12:30 a.m., off-season daily 8–11 p.m.
Exploring the town and the beaches
After you stroll around St-Tropez’s old port, head to the beautiful small
L’Annonciade, Musée de St-Tropez (place Grammont; % 04-94-17-
84-10) to find out how artists painted this port 75 years ago. The museum
is housed in a former chapel, an austere church built next to the port 
in 1568. The highlights among the colorful, cheerful collection of
Impressionist and fauvist works are paintings by Derain, Seurat, Braque,
Matisse, Signac, Bonnard, Utrillo, and Dufy. It’s open Wednesday to
Monday July through September 10 a.m. to noon and 3 to 7 p.m., and
October through June 10 a.m. to noon and 2 to 6 p.m. (closed the month
of Nov and Jan 1, May 1, and Dec 25). Admission is 5.50€ ($7.15) for
adults and 3.50€ ($4.55) for children 4 to 15.
Walk past the old port and up quai Jean-Jaurès, and you soon come to
the Château Suffren, built in 980. The building now houses an attractive
art gallery with large plate-glass windows overlooking the port. Pass
through place de l’Hôtel de Ville to rue de la Ponche and follow it for
several blocks. Take a right on rue des Remparts, which turns into rue
Aire du Chemin and eventually ends at rue Misericorde. Turn left and
walk 2 blocks to reach the Chapelle de la Miséricorde, which has a
brightly colored tile roof.
Port Grimaud, 6km (4 miles) northwest of St-Tropez, is an attractive vil-
lage made to look old, where stone houses sit beside canals and people
moor their boats practically right outside their doors. The village has a
number of fine shops and restaurants. You can get there by driving 5km
(3 miles) west on A98 and 1.6km (1 mile) north on route 98.
In St-Tropez, and along most of the French Riviera, going to the plage
(beach) means setting up camp at a concession location that provides
beach chairs, umbrellas, snacks, a restaurant, a bar, and sometimes
Part VI: Provence and the Riviera 
444

water sports. When you choose a beach, you’re choosing a business 
to patronize for the day. The most popular St-Tropez beaches are
Bouillabaisse, Graniers, Salins, Pampelonne, and Tahiti.
 Bouillabaisse: An easy walk from town, this beach offers Golfe
Azur (% 04-94-97-07-38), a restaurant that specializes in grilled
fish. A section of beach at Bouillabaisse, just west of town, has
clean shallow waters, making it a good choice for kids. Parking
costs 3.50€ ($4.55) per day.
 Graniers: This beach is one of the best for families and is within
walking distance of town. There’s free parking and Les Graniers
(% 04-94-97-38-50), the main restaurant at the beach, is one of the
better beach concessions. It serves the usual Provençal cuisine,
lots of grilled fish, and moules frites (mussels and french fries). Its
20€ ($26) plat du jour is reasonably priced when compared to most
restaurants.
 Pampelonne: Here you find about 35 businesses on a 4.8km (3-mile)
stretch, located about 10km (61⁄4 miles) from St-Tropez. You need 
a car, bike, or scooter to get from town to the beach. Parking is
about 3.50€ ($4.55) for the day. Famous hedonistic spots along
Pampelonne include the cash-only club La Voile Rouge (% 04-94-
79-84-34), which features bawdy spring-break-style entertainment.
Also thriving are Le Club 55 (% 04-94-55-55-55) and Nikki Beach
(% 04-94-79-82-04). Plage des Jumeaux (% 04-94-79-84-21) is
another actively patronized beach spot but with a large percentage
of families with young kids because it has playground equipment.
Marine Air Sports (% 04-94-97-89-19) rents boats; Team Water
Sports (% 04-94-79-82-41) rents Jet Skis, scooters, water-skiing
equipment, and boats.
 Salins: Located just north of Pampelonne and 3km (2 miles) from
St-Tropez, the popularity of this wide sandy beach is evident by
how fast the parking lot fills up. Arrive early to get a good spot on
the sand. Parking costs 3.50€ ($4.55). The most popular restaurant
on Salins beach is Leï Salins (% 04-94-97-04-40).
 Tahiti: This wild spot permits topless, and even nude, sunbathing.
Tahiti beach is 5km (3 miles) from St-Tropez, and parking costs
about 3.50€ ($4.55). Known as the region’s most decadent beach,
Tahiti tends to attract a young crowd interested in cruising.
The gulf of St-Tropez is so beautiful that you may be tempted to take a
boat ride. Captain Henri (% 06-84-07-41-87) has been offering harbor
cruises on his classic 1936 gaff-rigged wooden sailboat Thule since 1993.
The 60-minute cruise, with narration in English and other languages,
costs 8€ ($10) for adults and 4€ ($5.20) for children younger than ten.
From April to early October, tours leave daily at 11 a.m. and 4:30 p.m.,
cruising past oceanfront houses of celebrities such as George Michael,
Arnold Schwarzenegger, and Sylvester Stallone. From your waterside
perch, you float past the medieval ramparts surrounding old St-Tropez,
Chapter 21: The Western Riviera: From St-Tropez to Cannes 445

and the beaches — Plage des Graniers and Plage de la Cannoubière
included — many of which, at least in high season, are jam-packed with
scantily clad sunbathers. If you’d like, you can help to haul the sails as
the boat cruises around the gulf.
Shopping for local treasures
When strolling in St-Tropez, check out the pedestrian alleys, which are
usually lined with exclusive shops. A rough guide: Shops on the harbor
sell cheap sexy clothes, and shops a few blocks from the harbor feature
expensive sexy clothes. Hermès (% 04-94-97-04-29) is tucked into an
old building on rue de la Ponche. The best shoe store (selection and
price) is Les Sandales Tropeziennes (Rondini) at 16 rue Georges-
Clémenceau, near place des Lices (% 04-94-97-19-55). You also find a
number of good housewares stores, such as HM France (12 rue Georges-
Clémenceau; % 04-94-97-84-37), a chain specializing in fine linens.
Jacqueline Thienot (10 rue Georges-Clémenceau; % 04-94-97-05-70), 
situated down a medieval-looking alley, is a very fine antiques shop whose
proprietor speaks English. Perhaps the most surprising store in St-Tropez
is Le Jardin de Zita (12 aire du Chemin; % 04-94-97-37-44), a sort of high-
class junk shop filled with odds and ends for decorating your bohemian
yet stylish home. You can find a large selection of beautiful pottery at
Poterie Augier (19 rue Georges-Clémenceau; % 04-94-97-12-55).
The fish, vegetable, and flower market is located down a tiled alley
(Place aux Herbes) behind the tourist office. It operates daily 8 a.m. to
noon in summer and Tuesday to Sunday 8 a.m. to noon in winter. On
Tuesday and Saturday mornings on place des Lices, you can find an 
outdoor market with food, clothes, and brocante (flea-market finds).
Living it up after dark
St-Tropez is famous for its nightlife. From partying at bars and clubs to
people-watching at cafes along the old port, there’s something for every-
one. The key words are loud and late, so take a disco nap and get ready
to hit the town. In addition to the in-town venues, the beach clubs also
stay rowdy until the wee hours (see “Exploring the town and the
beaches,” earlier in this chapter).
Live music adds to the merriment at the friendly Kelly’s Irish Pub (quai
F. Mistral; % 04-94-54-89-11), which serves Guinness and Irish whiskey,
among other beverages. Papagayo (in the Résidence du Port, next to 
the harbor; % 04-94-79-29-50) is where the yachting crowd gathers for
drinking, dining, meeting, and greeting. At the well-established and very
visible Hôtel Sube, partyers practically hang off the balcony of the
second-floor Bar Sube (15 quai Suffren; % 04-94-97-30-04). Stop by The
Strand (2 rue du Petit Bal; % 04-94-97-43-22) during its cozy 7 to 9 p.m.
happy hour for cocktails and tapas. L’Esquinade Bar de Nuit (3 rue du
Four; % 04-94-56-26-31) can be a lot of fun, if you don’t mind the empha-
sis on the staff deciding who is hip and who might not be.
Part VI: Provence and the Riviera 
446

Intensely swank — a nighttime staple in St-Tropez for many years — is
Les Caves du Roy, in the Hôtel Byblos (% 04-94-56-68-00), where the
crowd is chic and a bit jaded, and where drinks are far from cheap
(about 20€/$26 each). Le Pigionnier (13 rue de la Ponche; % 04-94-97-
84-26) is a popular gay club, as is Chez Nano (17 rue Sybille; % 04-94-
97-72-59). The VIP Room (in the Résidence du Port; % 04-94-97-14-70)
is a bar and lounge next to the new port, and it attracts all ages. A cen-
tral cafe on the old port, Sénéquier (quai Jean-Jaurès; % 04-94-97-
00-90) offers prime people-watching and serves famous desserts. Café
de Paris (15 quai Suffren; % 04-94-97-00-56) is a popular brasserie/sushi
bar beneath the Hôtel Sube. And Café des Arts (place des Lices; % 04-
94-97-02-25) is one of St-Tropez’s most famous cafes.
Cannes: More than Just the Film Festival
Cannes, famous for the annual International Film Festival, is the Riviera
at its gaudiest and most banal — for some, that’s reason enough to stop
here. Overdevelopment has erased much of this seaside city’s beauty,
but it certainly has a fun quality, and offers unrivaled people-watching
and excellent shopping. The famous La Croisette boardwalk along the
beach is lined with “palaces,” the government-rated four-star grand
hotels that have long attracted the rich and famous.
Most visitors make a beeline for the Film Festival palace, a huge con-
crete monstrosity set on the beach. During the festival in May, images of
stars walking up the steps on the red carpet, surrounded by paparazzi,
are projected around the world. The city also spreads out the famous
carpet in July, August, and December, so visitors can pose for photos.
Handprints of directors and actors line the square near the steps.
We suggest that you avoid Cannes during the ten-day Film Festival in 
May. You can’t attend any of the fabulous events, and the crush of media
people is overwhelming. If you must visit during the festival, your best bet
for celebrity spotting is to eat lunch or dinner at one of the beach restau-
rants owned by the grand hotels. The best time to visit Cannes, a city of
60,000 people, is April, May (not during the festival), June, September, and
October. July and August are so crowded, it’s difficult to find a square of
sand or a cafe table.
Getting there
Cannes is a major Riviera hub, with frequent train and bus service. From
Paris, the fast TGV train to Cannes takes about five hours and costs 90€
to 150€ ($117–$195). The Cannes Gare SNCF (train station) is on rue
Jean-Jaurès (% 3635 within France). For train schedule information and
reservations, call % 08-92-35-35-39.
The focal point for bus transits into, out of, and within Cannes is the
Gare Routière (bus station), on place Bernard Cornut-Gentille. For infor-
mation about municipal buses that operate within 4.8km (3 miles) of the
Chapter 21: The Western Riviera: From St-Tropez to Cannes 447

city limits, call % 08-25-82-55-99; for information about buses coming in
from farther away, call Voyages Phocéens, 5 square Mérimée (% 04-93-

Trans Côte d’Azur (% 04-92-98-71-30; www.trans-cote-azur.com)
runs boats to and from Monaco (37€/$48 round-trip) between mid-June
and mid-September, and to and from St-Tropez (36€/$47 round-trip)
between July and mid-October. They arrive and depart from Cannes’s
quai St-Pierre, at the port, near the terminus of the rue Maréchal-Joffre,
close to the Hotel Sofitel.
The Aéroport International de Nice Côte d’Azur (% 08-20-42-33-33) is
27km (17 miles) from Cannes. Rapides Côte d’Azur (% 08-20-48-11-11)
runs from the airport to Cannes for 14€ ($18) and takes 30 minutes. A
taxi from the Nice airport to the center of Cannes takes half an hour and
costs 60€ ($78).
Getting around and getting information
You don’t need a car to get around Cannes; the city is quite compact
(see the “Cannes” map). Allo Taxi (% 08-90-71-22-27) will drive you
from one end of town to the other or make pickups at Nice’s airport.
Cannes is a good base for exploring the region. It’s 9km (6 miles) from
Antibes, 25km (16 miles) from St-Paul-de-Vence, 32km (20 miles) from
Nice, 50km (31 miles) from Monaco, and 79km (49 miles) from St-Tropez.

Albe-Hôtel
$
Cannes
This 24-room hotel is a budget alternative in Cannes. The location is good;
it’s situated opposite the main post office, close to place de Gaulle, and
just a few short blocks from La Croisette (the waterfront boardwalk). The
rooms are simple and small, but comfortable, and come with the usual
stable of amenities.

double. Breakfast: 7€ ($9.10). MC, V.
Hôtel Albert-1er
$
Cannes
Originally conceived as a private villa, the 11-room Albert-1er (1er is pro-
nounced premier) is a good budget choice. The hotel is on the far side of
the main highway into Cannes. Although it isn’t an ideal location, it’s con-
venient, a ten-minute walk directly uphill from the city’s old port, and you
won’t find a better price for a decent room. Some third-floor rooms have
distant water views of the old port, and all rooms have soundproof win-
dows. The hotel also provides a bowl of fruit in the rooms (which is
unusual for a two-star hotel).
See map p. 449. 68 av. de Grasse. % 04-93-39-24-04. Fax: 04-93-38-83-75. Parking:

Hôtel Carlton Inter-Continental
$$$$
Cannes
One of the famous palace hotels on the waterfront (its two shapely domes
make it an unmistakable landmark), the Carlton has long been popular
with Americans. The grand entrance and the lobby, with its marble
columns and frescoed ceiling, wowed the upper classes in 1912, when the
hotel opened, and continue to do so. The 338 rooms and suites are as luxu-
rious as any on the Riviera, and a number have balconies with sea views;
the 12-room imperial suite boasts its own elevator and butler. In high
season, the hotel maintains three separate restaurants: La Brasserie; a
more upscale restaurant called La Côte; and a beachfront snack bar, La
Plage, open only for lunch. In winter, only La Brasserie is open. The hotel
also has a hot tub and a health club. The beach across from the hotel is
rather narrow and composed of gravel and small, water-worn pebbles, but
it’s often the place for celebrity sightings.

Hôtel de Provence
$
Cannes
Located behind a private garden, this 30-room hotel is a good choice if
you’re looking for a relatively inexpensive hotel. The location isn’t bad
either: It’s in a relatively quiet neighborhood, only a few blocks from La
Croisette. The hotel has a homelike feel to it — in the public rooms and in
the guest rooms. Accommodations are decorated simply, but with atten-
tion to detail, and include safes. All doubles open onto terraces that offer
views of the garden, with its century-old palm trees.

Breakfast: 8€–9€ ($10–$12). AE, DC, MC, V.
Hôtel Majestic Barrière
$$$$
Cannes
Its bright-white undulating facade distinguishes the Majestic from the
other grand hotels along La Croisette. The hotel also boasts a classically
inspired lobby with immense Greek-style statues, a casino, and a garden
courtyard. In 2002, each of the 305 rooms and suites underwent renova-
tions. The hotel’s beach is known for its watersports program, with
instructors and rentals available. The hotel also boasts a pool, health club,
and tennis court. The fancy restaurant, La Villa des Lys, has a hot young
chef, Bruno Oger, who has received a number of accolades. In 2002, a
branch of a luxurious and upscale brasserie restaurant in Paris (Fouquet’s)
opened on site, adding touches of Belle Epoque glamour and a dining
venue that manages to be both elegant and relaxed.

Hôtel Martinez
$$$–$$$$
Cannes
The largest of the grand palaces along La Croisette, this 413-room Art Deco
1930s hotel is also the site of Cannes’s most famous deluxe restaurant, La
Palme d’Or. But because the Martinez has become popular with group
tours and conventions, it feels less elegant than the other hotels along La
Croisette, even though it offers the same deluxe room amenities, such as
high-quality linens and marble baths. The hotel also has a pool, a hot tub,
and tennis courts.

Hôtel Renoir
$–$$
Cannes
Originally conceived as a private villa and transformed into a hotel in the
early 1990s, this stylish 27-room hotel is a good medium-priced choice,
offering big hotel amenities. The rooms are cheerfully decorated in
Provençal style, with colorful bedspreads and painted furniture. Although
the hotel is a three-minute walk from the public beach, Plage Publique du
Festival (Festival Beach), it has a private beach, and south-facing units on
the upper floors have distant water views. But ask for a room facing north,
because the south accommodations face a busy highway (although they
do have double soundproof windows to temper the noise). Each room has
a kitchenette.

($117–$207) double, 98€–268€ ($127–$348) suite. Breakfast: 13€ ($17). AE, DC, MC, V.
Hôtel Splendid
$–$$
Cannes
The Splendid is for people who want a grand waterview hotel but don’t
want to splurge on the famous palace hotels blocks away. Originally built
in 1871 as a private home, it has been transformed into a hotel and
enlarged in several different stages to the point where today it contains 62
rooms. It has an excellent location, just a block from the Palais des
Festivals. The pretty Belle Epoque facade gives you a good idea of the
rooms, which are beautifully decorated and full of luxurious touches.
Considering the location and amenities, this is good-value lodging for
Cannes, particularly as many of the units open onto water views. The hotel
is next to place de Gaulle, one of the busiest squares in Cannes, but rooms
have soundproof windows, so it’s quiet. The hotel has no parking on site,
no restaurant, and no pool.
See map p. 449. 4 rue Félix-Faure (across from the port). % 04-97-06-22-22. Fax: 04-
93-99-55-02. www.splendid-hotel-cannes.fr. Rack rates: 124€–244€
($161–$317) double, 202€–264€ ($263–$343) suite. Rates include breakfast. AE, MC, V.
Dining locally
Cannes’s small romantic restaurants are clustered in Le Suquet, the 
Old Town. In fact, on rue St-Antoine (the Old Town’s main street), about
70 percent of the businesses are restaurants. The top luxury restaurants
can be found in the grand hotels along La Croisette.
La Brouette de Grand-mère
$$
Cannes
PROVENÇAL
Locals love this old-fashioned restaurant (the name means “grandmother’s
wheelbarrow”) that serves homelike, traditional food. The restaurant is
very small, and you must make reservations. The only option is a set
Part VI: Provence and the Riviera 
452

menu. It may seem expensive, but it’s actually a real bargain because wine
and an apéritif (premeal drink) are included. The few seats on the outdoor
terrace fill up first. The menu is loaded with regional dishes that include
pot-au-feu; roasted quail in cream; chicken stew cooked slowly in beer and
herbs; grilled beefsteaks; and andouillettes, the earthy specialty of the
mountainous region of central France, made from pork intestines (aka 
chitterlings).

mid-Dec.
La Canna Suisse
$–$$
Cannes
SWISS
Two sisters own this small-scale 1970s restaurant in Old Town, decked out
like a Swiss chalet and specializing in the cheese-based cuisine of the Swiss
Alps. Because its cuisine is so closely geared to cold-weather dining, the
restaurant wisely opts to close during the crush of Cannes’ midsummer
tourist season, although doing a landmark business in autumn, winter, and
early spring. The menu features only two kinds of fondue — a traditional
version concocted from six kinds of cheese and served in a bubbling pot
with chunks of bread on skewers, plus another that adds either morels or
cèpes (flap mushrooms) to the blend, depending on your wishes. The only
other dining options here include raclette and tartiflette (an age-old recipe
that combines boiled potatoes with fatback, onions, cream, herbs, and
Reblochon cheese). A long list of (mostly white) French and Swiss wines
usually taste wonderful when served with any of these ultratraditional
dishes.
See map p. 449. 23 rue Forville (Le Suquet). % 04-93-99-01-27. Reservations recom-

La Mère Besson
$$
Cannes
PROVENÇAL
The candlelit tables under the awning at La Mère Besson, located on a
quiet street just a few blocks up from La Croisette, are among the best
places to dine in Cannes. This classic restaurant has been dishing out
homecooking to families since the 1930s. The daily specials here are like
a course in Provençal cuisine, featuring osso bucco (veal braised with
tomatoes) and lapereau farci aux herbes de Provence (baked rabbit stuffed
with meat and Provençal herbs), and shoulder of Provençal lamb studded
with garlic cloves and herbs and slowly roasted in its own juice.

Cannes
PROVENÇAL
The oldest restaurant in town, L’Auberge Provençal opened in Le Suquet
in 1860 and has been serving traditional regional dishes ever since. The
25€ ($33) menu, which has six main dish choices, is a good value.
Although the cooking can be inconsistent, several dishes are always good,
including bouillabaisse (the rich fish stew); filet de boeuf aux foie gras; and
carré d’agneau de Sisteron (rack of lamb), a regional specialty. For dessert,
try le petit crêpe flambé à la liqueur d’orange (a flaming crepe with orange
liqueur). A terrace provides outdoor seating in summer.
See map p. 449. 10 rue St-Antoine. % 04-92-99-27-17. Reservations accepted. Main

Le Bâoli
$$–$$$$
Cannes
FRENCH/JAPANESE
One of the ultimate hip joints in Cannes occupies a waterfront site outfit-
ted like a temple garden in Thailand, complete with lavishly carved door-
ways, potted and in-ground palms, and hints of the Spice Trade scattered
artfully in out-of-the-way corners. (“Le Bâoli” derives from a well in
Indonesia with reputed mystical powers.) The restaurant has room, either
indoors or on a terrace overlooking the twinkling lights of La Croisette, for
up to 350 diners at a time, and plenty of room after the end of the dinner
service for a dance club venue (midnight–4 a.m.; no cover) where at least
some of the clients may dance frenetically, in scantily clad giddiness, on
the tables. Menu items include Japanese-inspired teppanyaki dishes pre-
pared tableside by a samurai-style chef. The French dishes include tartare
of tuna spread on toasts, crisp ravioli stuffed with shrimp, lobster in citrus
sauce with a confit of tomatoes, filet of sea wolf with fennel, and a particu-
larly elegant version of macaroni that’s “perfumed” with an essence of lob-
ster. Vegetarians appreciate the availability of such dishes as risotto with
green asparagus, broccoli, and fava beans.

Le Comptoir des Vins
$–$$
Cannes
PROVENÇAL
This wine bar/restaurant in an atmospheric cellar is a favorite hangout for
oenophiles and a lively scene on most nights. Every day, a changing array
of about ten France-derived wines are sold by the glass, always including
a champagne and a sweet dessert wine; about 250 wines are sold by the
bottle. Menu items focus on hearty, savory, and flavorful food that makes
the wine taste even better. These include fresh pastas, blanquettes de veau,
a variety of estouffades (slow-cooked cuts of meat, sometimes known in
Part VI: Provence and the Riviera 
454

Provence as a daube); and platters of marinated salmon, pâtés, terrines,
and cheeses.
See map p. 449. 13 bd. de la République. % 04-93-68-13-26. Reservations not needed.
Main courses: 12€–15€ ($16–$20); prix fixe: 23€ ($30). MC, V. Open: Mon–Sat noon–
2 p.m. and 7:30–10 p.m.
Le Harem
$$–$$$$
Cannes
MOROCCAN/MEDITERRANEAN
Set in the heart of Cannes, midway between rue d’Antibes and La Croisette,
this is the hippest, most popular, and most sought-after Moroccan restau-
rant in Cannes, as proven by the bevy of soccer, pop music, and cinema
stars who have visited it since its opening in May 2002. It contains a trio
of dining rooms, each lavishly outfitted, à la marocaine, with chastened
brass coffeepots, tribal carpets from the Sub-Saharan Desert, geometri-
cally carved panels, and leatherwork. If you opt for a meal here, don’t
expect just another ethnic restaurant, as this one contains a well-defined
postmodern twist, both in its décor and in its cuisine. The menu acknowl-
edges the cuisines of Morocco, Tunisia, Algeria, Spain, and Italy. There are
at least a half-dozen tagines (clay pots in which chicken, lamb, fish, and
vegetables are spiced, slow-cooked, and made savory) and at least three
different versions of couscous (such as a traditional version with only
lamb; a royale version containing merguez sausage, chicken, lamb, and
beef; and a super-deluxe seafood version, priced at 70€/$91 per person,
that’s loaded with lobster and shellfish). Other dishes, not deriving from
North Africa, include tuna fried with Iberian cured ham in the Basque style,
a salad of chickpeas with coriander and mint, and an Andalusia-inspired
tomato-based gazpacho.
See map p. 449. 15 rue des Frères Pradignac. % 04-93-39-62-70. Reservations rec-

Cannes
PROVENÇAL
A set menu is the only option for dining here, but the price is so reason-
able, and the choice so varied, that the place is genuinely popular not only
with locals but also with out-of-towners. The well-crafted three-course
menu is described in English and French, with a choice (that changes
every two weeks) of eight starters and eight main courses. Possibilities
include a terrine of foie gras of duckling, served with a sweet-and-sour
onion jam; herb-infused rack of lamb; scallops served with mashed pota-
toes, garlic, and parsley; and fried John Dory with tomatoes and aromatic

scheme of terra cottas and ochres inspired by Provence.

Le Moulin de Mougins
$$$–$$$$
Mougins
FRENCH
In 2004, Alain Llorca took over the celebrated inn, until recently the king-
dom of Roger Vergé, a maître cuisinier de France and one of the country’s
top three chefs. After seven years as chef of the fabled Négresco Hotel in
Nice, Llorca has turned out to be just the man to succeed Vergé. He
employs market-fresh ingredients in his “cuisine of the sun,” a reference to
Provence’s light-drenched countryside. If our first meal at this former 16th-
century olive mill is any indication of Llorca’s talent, he’s going far to retain
Vergé’s most loyal clients. Roast flank of beef, in red wine and its own
juices, was a delectable choice. Provençal lamb came with oranges en
confit, fresh spinach, and a fondant of carrots. And roasted turbot with
braised celeriac and flap mushrooms deserves an award. Llorca’s brother,
Jean-Michel, is the extraordinarily talented pastry chef.

Le Tantra/Le Loft
$$–$$$
Cannes
FRENCH/ASIAN
An enduring favorite on the city’s dine-and-then-dance circuit, this duplex-
designed restaurant and disco is on a side street that runs directly into La
Croisette. On the street level, you find a Tao-inspired dining room, artfully
simple and outfitted in a way that, if it wasn’t filled with chattering and
gossiping diners, might inspire a meditation or a yoga class. Menu items
focus on a French adaptation of Asian cuisine, with lots of sushi; tempura
that includes a succulent combination of deep-fried banana slices, 
zucchini flowers, shrimp, and lobster; a Japanese-style steak of Kobe beef
marinated in teriyaki, soy, and garlic; and deep-fried noodles dotted with
chunks of shrimp and lobster. The 9 p.m. seating is relatively calm, but the
11 p.m. seating is more linked to the disco madness upstairs. Here, until 
4 a.m. (no cover), in a venue lined with plush, scarlet sofas and exposed
stone, you witness the gyrations and mating games of a scantily clad
crowd of all kinds of hipsters from across the wide, wide range of social
types inhabiting (or visiting) Cannes.
See map p. 449. 13 rue du Dr. Monod. % 04-93-39-40-39. Reservations strongly rec-
ommended. Main courses: 18€–38€ ($23–$49). AE, DC, MC, V. Open: Mon–Sat seat-
ings at 8 and 11 p.m.
Exploring the town and the beaches
One of the best ways to get your initial bearings in Cannes (and to get an
idea of the difference between the city’s new and old neighborhoods) is
to climb aboard one of the white-sided Petits Trains Touristiques de
Cannes. Diesel-powered, and rolling on rubber tires through the streets
of the city, the trains operate year-round (except Nov) every day from 
Part VI: Provence and the Riviera 
456

10 a.m. to between 7 and 11 p.m., depending on the season. Two itiner-
aries are offered.
 For views of glittery modern Cannes, board the train at a desig-
nated spot in front of either of the town’s two casinos for rides
along La Croisette and its side streets.
 For a ride through the relatively narrow streets of Vieux Cannes 
(Le Suquet), board the train at a clearly designated site along La
Croisette on its seaward side, immediately opposite the Hôtel
Majestic Barrière.
Both tours depart every hour, and each lasts between 30 and 40 min-
utes, depending on traffic, and costs 6€ ($7.80) for adults and 3€ ($3.90)
for children younger than 10, depending on the tour. (The tour of Vieux
Cannes is the less expensive of the two.) A combination ticket granting
access on both tours (which can be enjoyed on separate days, if you
prefer) goes for 9€ ($12) for adults and 5€ ($6.50) for children younger
than 10. For details, call % 06-11-57-06-01.
You may want to explore Cannes on your own and not on a formal walk-
ing tour. You get the best feel for the city by exploring the narrow streets
of Le Suquet (the Old Town), which most evokes the walled town turned
fishing village that rose up here in the Middle Ages. Just past the small
restaurants and boutiques on rue St-Antoine, you can climb the ancient
steps to a square where you find the impressive Musée de la Castre
(% 04-93-38-55-26), housed in a 12th-century former priest dormitory.
The museum contains collections donated by 19th-century explorers
and ethnographers, with a focus on Mediterranean and eastern archaeol-
ogy and indigenous art. The museum’s Eskimo art collection is growing.
An interactive exhibit of musical instruments from around the world
enables you to hear the sounds of the instruments. On the second floor
is a collection of paintings by artists from Cannes and the region. In the
painting Le Suquet au coucher du soleil, vu du Nord, which shows Cannes
in 1864, the sky is the only thing that still looks the same. The museum is
open Tuesday to Sunday as follows: October to March 10 a.m. to 1 p.m.
and 2 to 5 p.m.; April, May, and September, 10 a.m. to 1 p.m. and 2 to 
6 p.m.; June to August 10 a.m. to 1 p.m. and 3 to 7 p.m. Admission costs
3€ ($3.90) for adults. Entrance is free for students and for persons
younger than 18. From the ramparts surrounding the museum, you have
a panoramic view over the city, the old harbor, and the sea. Even in high
season, you may be the only one enjoying this peaceful and romantic
place — everyone else will likely be at the beach.
After exploring Le Suquet, you can check out one of Cannes’s famous
markets. Marché Forville on rue Meynadier (near to Le Suquet, just 
off rue St-Antoine) is the largest fruit, vegetable, fish, and cheese (and 
to a lesser extent, meat) market in Cannes. Keep walking east on the
pedestrian-only rue Meynadier, where you’ll find some of the best shops,
everything from bargain clothing stores to fancy food stores. Afterward,
Chapter 21: The Western Riviera: From St-Tropez to Cannes 457

you can walk south a few blocks to the old port, where luxury yachts 
tie up next to local fishing boats. Next to the old port is the Palais des
Festivals, which houses the tourist office (just left of the grand steps)
and is the venue for the Film Festival events. When the Film Festival isn’t
in session, it serves as a conference hall year round. Now you’re on La
Croisette, Cannes’s boardwalk, officially known as boulevard de la
Croisette, which stretches 3km (2 miles) and is lined with grand hotels.
Feel free to wander into a lobby, plop down on a plush wing chair, and
watch the local comings and goings.
Cannes has more than 30 public and private beaches, and most are a
combination of sand with pebbles. But going to the beach in Cannes 
isn’t a back-to-nature experience. In fact, you can’t really see the sand
because the beach chairs cover almost every square inch of it. An
important part of the beach scene here involves posing and checking
out the poseurs. Entrance to one of the private beaches requires pay-
ment of an entrance fee, which entitles you to the use of a parasol and 
a mattress and/or lounge chair. A full day’s use, with wide variance
depending on the facilities and the degree of exclusivity of the beach,
costs from 25€ ($33) to as much as 45€ ($59), usually with a 40 percent
discount if you arrive after 2 p.m. Private beaches almost always have at
least one food-and-drink concession and, at the fancier ones, a full-
fledged restaurant. Some of the best-established private beaches are the
ones associated with the town’s palace hotels. They include the Carlton
(% 04-93-06-40-06), Majestic Barrière (% 04-92-98-77-00), Martinez
(% 04-92-98-73-00), and Noga Hilton (% 04-92-99-70-00). The private
beaches of other hotels charge a little less for half-day and full-day rates
at the beach. The beach restaurants associated with the palace hotels
usually have a dish of the day on a set-price lunch menu that’s not too
expensive (25€/$33). The palace hotel beaches also have the best water-
sports concessions.
For a beach with lifeguards, head to Plage de Midi (% 04-93-39-92-74),
on the west side of the old port. The beach also has a restaurant with
reasonable rates serving lunch, dinner, and snacks.
Shopping for local treasures
Most stores in Cannes are open Monday to Saturday 10 a.m. to 7:30 p.m.
in summer (in winter, 10 a.m.–6:30 or 7 p.m.).
Cannes is famous for its food, flower, and flea markets, open in various
squares all across town. The biggest market is the Marché Forville, just
a few steps east of the Vieux Cannes or Le Suquet and a few blocks north
of the old port. This colorful market features produce and fish in a block-
long covered building. Restaurateurs and other gourmands come from
all over the region to buy fish here from the fishwives selling their hus-
bands’ catch of the day. It’s open Tuesday to Sunday 5 a.m. to 3 p.m. On
Mondays, a flea market takes over the space (Oct–June 8 a.m.–6 p.m.
and July–Sept 3–6 p.m.).
Part VI: Provence and the Riviera 
458

From July to September, a flower market is open daily at the Allées de 
la Liberté 7 a.m. to 1 p.m.; October to June, the hours are Tuesday to
Sunday 7 a.m. to 1 p.m. Several markets specializing in clothes are open
on Saturday 8 a.m. to 12:30 p.m. at place Gambetta and place de Cannes
la Bocca.
The pedestrian rue Meynadier has the best selection of specialty food
shops. Ernest Traiteur (52 rue Meynadier, at the corner of rue Louis-
Blanc; % 04-93-06-23-00) is a famous pâtisserie specializing in cakes and
deli that handles Film Festival receptions; the prepared foods are expen-
sive but good. Ceneri (22 rue Meynadier; % 04-93-39-63-68) is a famous
third-generation cheesemaker that sells to the region’s most famous
restaurants.
The town’s best candymaker is Maiffret (31 rue d’Antibes; % 04-93-68-
95-45), making bonbons since 1885. The chocolate laboratory on the
second floor is open to visitors Tuesday to Friday 2 to 3 p.m. The other
top chocolatier is Bruno (13 rue Hoch; % 04-93-39-26-63), which also
makes enticing gelée de fruits.
The wine store La Cave du Marché (5 place du Marché Forville; % 04-
93-99-60-98) carries, among other fine vintages, La Vendage des Moines
(Monks’ Vintage), the wine made by monks on the nearby island of 
St-Honorat. Cannelle, in the Galerie Grey-d’Albion (32 rue des Serbes; 
% 04-93-38-72-79), adjacent to the Hotel Grey d’Albion, is a deluxe spe-
cialty grocery store that’s similar to Fauchon in Paris. It doubles as a
salon du thé, serving delectable teacakes at noon on the terrace Monday
to Saturday from 9 a.m. to 7 p.m.
If you are shopping for clothing, rue Meynadier is known for its inexpen-
sive shops, while rue d’Antibes has middle-range prices. The high-end
designer shops (including Chanel, Dior, and St-Laurent) are on or near 
La Croissette.
Living it up after dark
Public perception of Cannes is invariably associated with permissive-
ness, filmmakers celebrating filmmaking, and gambling. If gambling is
your thing, a couple of world-class casinos are in Cannes, each loaded
with addicts, mere voyeurs, and everyone else in between.
 Casino Croisette, in the Palais des Festivals (1 Jetée Albert-
Edouard; % 04-92-98-78-00), is the better established of the two.
It’s run by the Lucien Barrière group and a well-respected fixture 
in town since the 1950s.
 Palm Beach Casino, place F-D-Roosevelt (pointe de la Croisette; 
% 04-97-06-36-90) lies on the southeast edge of La Croisette.
Originally inaugurated in 1933, and rebuilt in 2002 by the Partouche
group, it features three restaurants, an Art Deco décor, and a
format that’s glossier, newer, and a bit hungrier (and trying harder)
for new business.
Chapter 21: The Western Riviera: From St-Tropez to Cannes 459

Both casinos maintain slot machines that operate daily from 10 to 5 a.m.
and suites of rooms devoted to les grands jeux (blackjack, roulette, and
chemin de fer) that are open nightly from 8 p.m. to 5 a.m.
The hippest club is Le Life, 22 rue Macé (% 04-93-99-94-86), where a
multicultural crowd of night owls, mostly younger than 35, come to
dance, drink, talk, and flirt. It opens every night 11:30 p.m. to 4 a.m., 
and charges 16€ ($21) for admission.
The aptly named bar des Stars, in the Restaurant Fouquet’s in the Hôtel
Majestic Barrière, 14 la Croisette (% 04-92-98-77-29), is where deals go
down during the film festival. Directors, producers, stars, press agents,
screenwriters, and wannabes crowd in here at festival time. Even when
there’s no festival, it’s a lively place for a drink; its scarlet décor evokes
an Art Deco Asian fantasy.
Gays and lesbians will feel comfortable at Le Vogue, 20 rue du Suquet
(% 04-93-39-99-18), a mixed bar open Tuesday to Sunday from 7:30 p.m.
till 2:30 a.m. Another gay option is Disco Le Sept, 7 rue Rouguière 
(% 04-93-39-10-36), where drag shows are held nightly at 1:30 a.m.
Entrance is free, except on weekends, when there’s a 16€ ($21) cover
(includes a drink). A lot of straights go here, too. At the Casino Croisette
is the nightclub Jimmy’s de Régine (% 04-92-98-78-78), with a 12€ to
18€ ($14–$22) cover.
Zanzibar (85 rue Félix-Faure; % 04-93-39-30-75) is not only a gay bar,
but a gay bar with a past, both scandalous and literary. Established in
1885 as a mainstream bar and cafe, it experienced a shift in its clientele
around 1925, when it evolved into something more distinctly lavender.
Since then, it has welcomed most of the seminal figures in the history 
of the French gay movement, including Jean Cocteau; Jean Genêt; and
Jacques Charron, one of the premier actors in the Comédie Française
during the late 1950s and 1960s. Expect a one-room venue layered with
maritime (nonerotic) frescoes and a mostly male clientele of virtually
every physical and sexual persuasion. It’s open daily year-round from 
6 p.m. until dawn. Entrance is free; beer costs 4€ ($5.20).
Biot and the Léger Museum
In the tiny hilltop village of Biot, craftspeople specializing in pottery and
glassmaking ply their ancient trades. Romans first settled the village in
154 B.C. In the Middle Ages, the Black Plague wiped out the population of
Biot, and 50 families resettled it in 1470. Many current residents of the
village are descendents of these early settlers.
Because Biot is so small and offers just one hotel in the Old Town, many
people make this destination a half-day trip from Cannes or Nice. A walk
Part VI: Provence and the Riviera 
460

from one end of the village to the other takes about ten minutes. The
renowned Musée Fernand Léger is located 3km (2 miles) from the vil-
lage, with signs that direct you to it.
At Biot’s pottery and glass-blowing studios, you can watch the pieces
being made. Most of the artisan studios are on the highway on your way
to the village, so a car is helpful here. Because Biot is set on a hill, walkers
have to trudge up very steep steps to get to town. Although the old 
village itself is pedestrian only, a parking lot is at the top of the hill near
the village center.
Getting there
Biot is 8km (5 miles) inland from Antibes, 9km (6 miles) from Cagnes
(2€/$2.60 by bus), 15km (9 miles) from both Nice and Cannes. If driving,
take N7 east from Antibes or west from Nice.
The Biot train station lies on the main coastal rail route, though the
actual village is inland. Biot has frequent service each way from Nice 
(30 minutes, 3.50€/$4.55) and Antibes (15 minutes, 1.30€/$1.70). For 
rail information and schedules, call the railway station in Nice directly
(% 04-97-03-80-80), and if they don’t answer (and sometimes they
won’t), try % 08-92-35-35-39 or 3635 within France. The Biot train sta-
tion is located about 8km (5 miles) from the actual hilltop village of Biot.
Between the station and the village is an unattractive highway with no
sidewalks — not a pleasant walk. Bus service from the railway station to
the heart of the village of Biot is via line 10A; the fare is 1.10€ ($1.45) per
person, each way, for the five-minute ride.
Buses depart every 20 to 90 minutes, depending on the season and the
day of the week, with the least frequent service occurring Sunday in mid-
winter. La Sociéte Sillages (% 04-93-34-37-60) runs buses between Biot
and Antibes; trips take 20 minutes and cost 1.10€ ($1.30). Monday to
Saturday, 20 buses leave every thirty minutes 7:20 a.m. to 6 p.m.; Sunday
and holidays, eight buses per day depart from 8 a.m. to 6 p.m. Buses
leave from place Guynemer, the square at the entrance to town near the
post office. Buses also stop at Musée Fernand Léger and La Verrerie de
Biot (glass-blowing studio).
Getting around and getting information
The local taxi service is Central de Taxis (% 08-20-90-69-60).
The tourist office is located at 46 rue St-Sebastien (% 04-93-65-78-00;
www.biot.fr). From September through June, the office is open Monday
to Friday 9 a.m. to noon and 2 to 6 p.m. and Saturday and Sunday 2 to 
6 p.m.; July and August, hours are Monday to Friday 10 a.m. to 7 p.m. and
Saturday and Sunday 2:30 to 7 p.m.

Under the medieval arches on the village’s main square, this 12-room hotel,

tobacconist, art gallery, and a hangout for locals. Alas, it’s tough to get a
room here because it’s the only game in town and fills up fast. To reach
the rooms in this ancient stone house, you climb a curving tiled stairway;
the stairway’s walls are covered with original abstract art. The rooms,
which vary in size, are cheerfully decorated in a simple and artsy style (a
tapestry may be used to cover the bath area) and have views over the
rooftops. Some rooms open onto terraces or small balconies. The bistro is
known for excellent homecooking. The Brothier family has run the hotel
for half a century.

Chapter 21: The Western Riviera: From St-Tropez to Cannes 463

The tradition of glassmaking in Biot began only in 1956, when ceramic
engineer Eloi Monod opened the Verrerie du Biot glass studio and
museum (Chemin des Combes; % 04-93-65-03-00; www.verreriebiot.
com), which still is the largest and oldest glass studio in town. Admission
is free. Open May through September Monday to Saturday 9:30 a.m. to 
8 p.m., Sundays and holidays 10 a.m. to 1 p.m. and 2:30 to 7:30 p.m.;
October through April Monday to Saturday 9:30 a.m. to 6 p.m., Sundays
and holidays 10:30 a.m. to 1 p.m. and 2:30 to 6:30 p.m.
Since Monad opened his studio, eight glass artists have opened their
own galleries, including Jean Claude Novaro at place des Arcades 
(% 04-93-65-60-23), and Jean-Michel Operto at Silice Creation (173
Chemin des Combes; % 04-93-65-10-25). Each artist offers his own take
on the contemporary stylings of glass, and it’s fascinating to watch
them, lit by flaming ovens, as they create the glassware.
For centuries, Biot has been associated with pottery — mainly large
earthenware amphora containers called Biot jars. You’ll find them at 
La Poterie Provençale (1689 Route de la Mer; % 04-93-65-63-30).
Musée National Fernand-Léger, located at chemin du Val de Pome, on
the eastern edge of town (% 04-92-91-50-30), houses an impressive col-
lection devoted to the beloved Cubist; people who aren’t familiar with
Léger’s vibrant works are in for a treat. The building is an immense con-
temporary structure built after Léger’s death and designed especially to
highlight his oeuvre. Huge colorful mosaics, stained-glass windows, and
giant metal sculptures decorate the exterior. Inside, the building’s large
spaces give ample room for Léger’s monumental paintings, drawings,
ceramics, and tapestries executed between 1905 and 1955. This is excit-
ing, life-affirming work. A French film about Léger runs hourly, and a
brochure in English is available. The ground floor plays host to changing
exhibits. The museum is open Wednesday to Monday as follows: July to
September, 10:30 a.m. to 6 p.m.; October to June 10 a.m. to 12:30 p.m.
and 2 to 5:30 p.m. Entrance to the permanent collections costs 5€
($6.50) for adults, and entrance to temporary exhibitions costs an addi-
tional 6.20€ ($8.05) for adults. Students and persons younger than 18
receive discounts of about 40 percent, and children younger than 6 enter
free. Entrance is free for everyone the first Sunday of every month.
Antibes and Cap d’Antibes
The town of Antibes manages to blend its ancient past and jazzy present
in an appealing way. Antibes has a historic center of pedestrian streets
ringed by a newer section of town, attractively laid out with smart shops
and handsome squares, including place Général-de-Gaulle, where you
can find the tourist office. As the unofficial capital of the yacht industry,
Antibes is full of young people — mainly Brits, Americans, Australians,
and Kiwis (New Zealanders) — looking to be crewmembers on yachts
and giving the town an anglicized feel. This youthful populace also dis-
tinguishes Antibes from some of the other Mediterranean towns that are
Part VI: Provence and the Riviera 
464

popular with retirees. The town’s two big yachting events are Les Voiles
d’Antibes in June and the Antibes Cup in July. The Jazz Festival, which
takes place for three weeks in July, is one of the more famous in France.
Antibes is actually one of the region’s most ancient cities, founded by
Greek seafarers around 400 B.C. as a convenient stopover between
Corsica and Marseille. The original city was called Antipolis (“opposite”)
because it was opposite Corsica. The region became a Roman province,
and Antipolis was again an important stop along a trade route. When
Nice and Cannes were only villages, the people of Antipolis erected tem-
ples, public baths, aqueducts, a triumphal arch, and large fortifications.
In the 11th century, the name of the city was changed to Antibes.
The old port of Antibes, with its ancient ramparts, is next to the new
Port Vauban, where most of the colossal yachts are moored. Antibes is
quite lively in season, and those wandering around town may be treated
to impromptu entertainment, such as a Dixieland jazz band playing on
place Nationale. Cap d’Antibes (the tip of the peninsula) is an isolated
residential area, with private estates and fancy hotels, located about
5km (3 miles) uphill from town. Crowded sandy beaches are near town,
but the Garoupe beaches, 3km (2 miles) from town toward the tip of the
peninsula, are the preferred spot for sunbathing or strolling along the
beachfront pedestrian path.
Getting there
Antibes is 11km (7 miles) east of Cannes and 21km (13 miles) west of
Nice. The bus station, Gare Routière, is centrally located on place
Guynemer (% 04-93-34-37-60). It takes about 30 minutes (3.80€/$4.95)
by bus from Cannes or Nice. The train station, Gare SNCF, is at place
Pierre-Semard north in the Old Town. Trains, running every half-hour to
and from Cannes, take 10 minutes and cost 3.30€ ($4.30); trains that run
every half-hour to and from Nice take 20 minutes and cost 3.70€ ($4.80).
For information and reservations, call % 08-92-35-35-39.
If you’re driving from Nice, take N98 west for about 15 minutes; from
Cannes, it’s an even quicker trip, about 10 minutes east on A8.
Aéroport de Nice Côte d’Azur (% 08-20-42-33-33) is 23km (14 miles)
from Antibes. For information on flights, call % 08-92-69-55-55. A bus
(“Tam Zoo”) to town costs 5€ ($6.50) and takes 40 minutes. A taxi takes
about half an hour and costs 41€ to 61€ ($53–$79).
Getting around and getting information
Frequent local bus service no. 2A (% 04-93-34-37-60) loops all the way
out to the tip of the peninsula and back to town, costing 1€ ($1.30) per
ride. You can pick up the bus at Gare Routière (bus station), or along
boulevard Albert-1er, where several stops are marked along the wide
sidewalk. The bus takes about 20 minutes to travel from the bus station
to the Eden Roc hotel at the tip of the peninsula.

This family-run inn, located on the Old Town’s busy place Nationale, has
seven very basic rooms at bargain prices. The centrally located hotel and
restaurant (popular and reasonably priced; see “Dining locally,” later in
this chapter) is about a two-minute walk from the port and beaches. This
area stays loud late at night, as late diners mingle with bar hoppers. The
inn does not employ the most refined staff — so be duly warned.

Set on a parcel of land that’s unusually large (about 0.8 hectares/2 acres)
for overcrowded Antibes, this circa-1968 hotel resembles a privately
owned Provençal mas (private farmhouse) set amid a luxuriant garden of
parasol pines and trailing bougainvillea. Bedrooms are average in size, 24
of them with private verandas, all of them with wall-to-wall carpeting,
white walls, and tile-sheathed bathrooms, each with tub and shower com-
binations. The hotel offers a swimming pool, tennis court, and even a ping-
pong room — great for the kids. It’s only 54m (180 ft.) from the sea, across
the busy coastal highway (boulevard de la Garoupe), and has a particu-

(never formal dinners) all day until 10 p.m.

chandeliers, and upholstered armchairs. The guest rooms are among the
most sumptuous on the Riviera, with deluxe beds. Bathrooms are spacious
with brass fittings and tub and shower combinations. Even though the
guests snoozing by the pool, which was blasted out of the cliffside at enor-
mous expense, may appear artfully undraped during the day, evenings
here are upscale, with lots of emphasis on clothing and style. The world-
famous Pavillon Eden Roc, near a rock garden apart from the hotel, has a
panoramic sea view. Venetian chandeliers, Louis XV chairs, and elegant
draperies add to the drama. Lunch is served on an outer terrace, under
umbrellas and an arbor.

Hôtel Mas Djoliba

Antibes
Named after a tributary of the Niger River in the 1920s by a doctor, fresh
upon his return from a research trip to Africa, this pretty 13-room hotel is
located in a kind of nowheresville (a steep residential area on the edge of
town); it isn’t too far from the beach, with about a 10-minute walk to the
historic center. Mas means farmhouse, but this hotel, surrounded by lush
foliage, feels more like a private villa. Some of the charming rooms offer
distant sea views, and one has a balcony; all rooms are relatively spacious.
The top-floor two-bedroom suite can sleep five people and has a terrace
and sea view. Families seem particularly at home at Djoliba, with the
heated pool supplying hours of distraction for kids. The staff is particu-
larly friendly. Between mid-May and the end of September, the hotel
requires half board.

Antibes
This former coaching inn, originally built 150 years ago where stage
coaches picked up and dropped off weary travelers, is a rarity in Antibes:
a medium-priced hotel centrally located in the old city, with an excellent
restaurant. Though the sheets and towels are very thin, the 16 rooms are
pretty, with attractive bedding and curtains, and some have terraces facing
the square. The rooms are definitely a good value, though they vary con-
siderably in size. For instance, the room called Malte is a large and well-
decorated room on the top floor with a balcony overlooking the square,
while La Valette and Berlin are both small but charming rooms facing the
rear of the building. Newest of the lot is Capri. Cozy and a bit cramped, it
sits on the ground floor and has its own expansive terrace.

The creative preparations may be fricassée de rougets (braised red mullet
in red wine sauce) or chapon en papillote (chicken — young rooster, 
actually — baked in parchment). But the restaurant prides itself on its
preparation of that regional specialty, boullabaisse — and it works; we
think it’s the best on the entire Riviera. For dessert, a selection of fresh
tarts and other delicacies always are available.

Exploring the town and the beaches
The peninsula containing the towns of Antibes on the east, Juan-les-Pins

Antibes has an easy layout. From central place Général-de-Gaulle, rue
de la République (a pedestrian street) leads to the Old Town, with its
cobblestone pedestrian streets, and ends at place Nationale, the liveli-
est square in the Old Town. Rue Sade, on the south side of place
Nationale, a street loaded with restaurants, leads to Cours Massena,
which is set up for several blocks with a covered market. One block
south is the Château Grimaldi, housing the Musée Picasso and the
Cathédrale d’Antibes (see later in this section for details on both). Just
beyond the ramparts of Château Grimaldi is the old port, crowded with
pleasure yachts. To get to Cap d’Antibes at the tip of the peninsula, you
need to drive or take a city bus. Several bus stops are along bd. Albert-
1er, stretching from place Général-de-Gaulle to the beach. Antibes’s
Provençale Market, with food and flowers, is open in the covered
market building on Cours Massena daily, except Monday, 6 a.m. to 1 p.m.
In the afternoon, crafts are displayed in the market building. A good flea
market is open every Thursday and Saturday 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. on place
Audiberti.
Le Petit Train d’Antibes (% 04-93-67-43-59) runs frequent half-hour
tours of Antibes and Juan-le-Pins. In Antibes, the train leaves from place
de la Poste and passes by the pedestrian streets, Provençal market, Old
Town, port Vauban, and ramparts. Tickets are 7€ ($9.10) for adults and
4€ ($5.20) for children 3 to 10. The train operates between March and
October only, originating from a well-marked spot on the Cours Massena
and rumbling down, among others, rue de la République. During July and
August, it operates daily from 10 a.m. to 11 p.m.; from March through
June and during September and October, it runs daily from 10 a.m. to
noon and from 2 to 6 p.m.
You can also tour Antibes on foot as part of a guided tour. Gérard
Lavayssière (% 06-14-13-73-60) organizes two-hour walking tours of the
town’s historic core if he has a minimum of eight participants. Tours cost
7.50€ ($9.75) per person and originate every Monday at 5:30 p.m. on the
sidewalk in front of the tourist office and every Tuesday at 9:30 a.m. in
front of the Musée d’Archéologie. Reservations are important.
In the old stone Château Grimaldi, sitting high on a bluff overlooking the
sea, Musée Picasso (place Mariéjol; % 04-92-90-54-20) is one of Riviera’s
loveliest museums. Prolific artist Pablo Picasso spent the fall of 1946
painting at the villa, which was owned by the town; in gratitude he
donated to Antibes the 181 works he completed there, as well as ce-
ramics and sculpture. The museum, which frequently plays hosts to
themed exhibits of modern and contemporary art, has a large collection
of works by 20th-century artists. The sculpture garden opens onto a 
terrace with a panoramic view. The museum is open Tuesday to Sunday
as follows: June through September 10 a.m. to 6 p.m.; October through
May 10 a.m. to noon and 2 to 6 p.m. Admission costs 6€ ($7.80) for
adults, 3€ ($3.90) for students and persons 18 to 26. Children younger
than 18 enter free.

Cathédrale d’Antibes, on place Mariéjol (% 04-93-34-06-29), is one of
the Riviera’s most beautiful cathedrals — it’s a baroque church with a
graceful facade that boasts stripes of burnt orange and yellow. The
cathedral was built on the site of a Roman temple dedicated to Diana.
Inside, you find a 12th-century Roman choir, an 18th-century baroque
nave, and the famous Brea altarpiece painted in 1515. It’s open daily 
9 a.m. to 6 p.m., and admission is free.
The imposing Musée d’Archéologie, on Bastion St-André, just southwest
of the Picasso Museum (% 04-93-34-00-39), contains an impressive col-
lection of antiquities found in Antibes and in shipwrecks nearby (some
dating back to 1200 B.C.). This museum tends to put on “fun” exhibits,
such as images on ceramics of Dionysus (Greek god of wine) from the
6th to 3rd centuries B.C. It’s open Tuesday to Sunday June through
September 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. (Fri ’til 10 p.m.), and October through May
10 a.m. to noon and 2 to 6 p.m. Guided visits are given on Friday at 3 p.m.
Admission is 3€ ($3.90), 1.50€ ($1.95) for students, children younger
than 18 free.
At Cap d’Antibes, next to the Hôtel du Cap-Eden-Roc and surrounded 
by a 5-hectare (12-acre) park, Musée Naval et Napoléonien (avenue
Kennedy; % 04-93-61-45-32) contains Napoleonic memorabilia and is
worth the trip for military history buffs. The museum also has a fine col-
lection of model ships, paintings, and marine objects. Year round, the
museum is open Tuesday to Saturday from 9:30 a.m. to noon and 2:15 
to 6 p.m. and Saturday from 9:30 a.m. to noon. Admission is 3€ ($3.90)
adults, 1.50€ ($1.95) students, and children younger than 18 are free.
Marineland, on route de Biot (RN7), just east of Antibes center (% 04-
93-33-49-49), is Europe’s largest marine zoological park and is home to
killer whales, dolphins, sea lions, seals, penguins, sharks, and aquariums
of exotic fish. You can watch the frequent feeding of seals and sea lions.
It’s open year round daily 10 a.m. to 5 p.m., but the last admission is at 
4 p.m. Admission is 34€ ($44) for adults and 25€ ($33) for children ages
3 to 12.
Antibes has some of the best beaches on the Riviera, in terms of sand
and cleanliness. The entire peninsula with Antibes and Juan-les-Pins has
25km (16 miles) of coastline and 48 beaches. The ones at the Cap are the
prettiest and have the best sand. Plage de la Salis is located just south
of town, within walking distance. On the eastern neck of the cape are the
Plages de la Garoupe, which are the peninsula’s nicest beaches, a long
stretch of 3km (2 miles). All beaches have concessions with chairs and
umbrellas to rent, and variety of water sports. And a restaurant is
always nearby, serving snacks and full meals.
Living it up after dark
You find much more nightlife in nearby Juan-les-Pins, a suburb of Antibes
reachable in a few minutes by car, but Antibes does have its share of good
Part VI: Provence and the Riviera

bars, especially on boulevard d’Aguillon near the port. The Hop Store
(38 bd. d’Aguillon; % 04-93-33-15-33) is a good Irish pub. La Siesta (route
du Bord de Mer; % 04-93-33-31-31) is a disco, piano bar, casino, and
restaurant that’s open Friday and Saturday only from September through
May (daily July–Aug).
Vence and the Matisse Chapel
Most visitors come to Vence to see a masterpiece by Matisse — the
Chapelle du Rosaire, the Dominican chapel he designed in the hills just
outside the town center. But the town itself is a suitable stop for lunch
and a stroll. Vence, with a population of 15,000, has a pedestrian-only
medieval center surrounded by ramparts. Along the Old Town’s narrow
cobblestone streets are cafes, galleries, and small shops. Vence is much
less touristy than neighboring St-Paul-de-Vence (see later in this chap-
ter), but it offers its own understated charms.
Getting there
Buses travel frequently between Nice and Vence, and the one-hour
(24km/15-mile) trip costs 1.30€ ($1.70). Buses arrive and depart from
place du Grand Jardin, near the tourist office. For bus schedules, call
Bus SAP (Societe Automobile de Provence) at % 04-93-58-37-60. Vence
has no train station, but the nearest train station is in Cagnes-sur-Mer
about 7km (5 miles) away. From there, you can take an SAP bus.
To drive from Nice to Vence, take N7 west to Cagnes-sur-Mer and then
D236 north to Vence.

Hôtel Le Provence
$
Vence
To reach Margaretha and Francis Sobata’s simple 16-room hotel, you pass
through a garden courtyard filled with roses and climbing bougainvillea —
and that’s perhaps the most memorable thing about this unassuming place.
Originally built as a villa, it was transformed into a hotel in the 1950s. The
hotel is situated in a fine location, across from the circular ramparts to the
Old Town. The Sobatas, a young friendly couple who speak English, pur-
chased the property and have slowly renovated each room in progression.
The rooms vary from quite small to medium size; some rooms have private
balconies, and most offer views of the garden or the village rooftops and
the distant sea.

At this rustic 17th-century hotel/restaurant, once a part of the nearby

hams are roasted on spits. The combination of atmosphere and reason-
able prices is popular with visitors. The decorative theme of the restau-

quintessential Renaissance-era monarch. In addition to the roasted

Exploring the town
Place du Peyra, inside the ramparts, contains the Vieille Fontaine, a
huge urn-shaped fountain, and a 10th-century cathedral decorated with
a Chagall mosaic on the left as you enter. Near the town’s west gate, the
15th-century Château Villeneuve (place du Frene; % 04-93-24-24-23)
houses a private modern art museum; the permanent collection includes
works by Matisse, Dufy, Dubuffet, and Chagall. It’s open Tuesday to
Sunday 10 a.m. to 12:30 and 2 to 6 p.m. Admission is 5€ ($6.50) adults,
2.50€ ($3.25) for students with ID and children 12 to 18, free for children
younger than 12.
In 1947, at age 77, Henri Matisse agreed to create a Dominican chapel in
the hills near Vence. Two years later, after hundreds of preparatory
drawings and many sleepless nights, Matisse had designed one of his
most unusual works, the Chapelle du Rosaire, 466 av. Henri-Matisse
(Route de Saint-Jeannet), 1.5km (1 mile) east from the center of town 
(% 04-93-58-03-26). On the building’s completion, he said, “I want those
entering my chapel to feel themselves purified and lightened of their
burdens.” The building is owned today by a community of nuns, the
Dominican Sisters of the Rosary (les Dominicaines du Rosaire), who live
in the community nearby. It is somewhat of a pilgrimage site for thou-
sands of Matisse-ophiles, who visit the chapel in different seasons and
times of day to see the changes sunlight makes on the stained-glass
reflections. Matisse designed every aspect of the building — not only 
the stained glass and tiles, but also elements such as the altar and the
priests’ vestments. When driving or walking toward the building from
Vence, you first notice the 12m (40-ft.) wrought-iron cross on a low-lying,
unassuming whitewashed building. Inside, down a flight of stairs, the
chapel is a luminous space with bright stained-glass windows and black-
and-white-tiled walls, with three minimalist tile designs: a powerfully
executed Stations of the Cross, an immense Madonna and Child, and a
portrait of a faceless St. Dominic (to the right of the altar). Outside the
chapel, an exhibit area, L’Espace Matisse, displays Matisse’s drawings
and samples of vestments in bright colors and starbursts designed by
the artist. A brochure is available in English. Admission to the chapel is
2.50€ ($3.25) for adults, 1€ ($1.30) for children younger than 16. From
December through September, the chapel is open Tuesday and
Thursday 10 to 11:30 a.m. and 2 to 5:30 p.m. and Monday, Wednesday,
and Saturday 2 to 5:30 p.m. (closed Oct–Nov). Sunday Mass starts at 
10 a.m. and is followed by a visit at 10:45 a.m.
Living it up after dark
The most popular bars and cafes are clustered around the main squares
of the village. Le Clémenceau (% 04-93-58-24-70) is a cafe on place
Clémenceau; Henry’s Bar tends to have patrons spilling out onto place
de Peyra; and La Régence is always full on place du Grand Jardin.

St-Paul-de-Vence and the Fondation Maeght
St-Paul-de-Vence, one of the most beautiful villages in France, is a small
pedestrian-only medieval burg built into a steep hill, with dozens of art
galleries lining the cobblestone streets. St-Paul-de-Vence is popular with
visitors making a day trip of strolling the narrow, steep streets and walk-
ing around the ramparts of this fortified town. After the day-trippers
leave, the village is peaceful in the evenings.
St-Paul’s history can be traced back to the 6th century B.C., when a forti-
fied enclosure was built here. The site came under Roman rule in 154 B.C.
and prospered as a key stop on an east–west trading route. The castle on
the top of the hill was built in the 12th century, as was the Romanesque
church nearby. In the 15th and 16th centuries, the village became pros-
perous as a provincial capital and took on the look it retains today. In the
20th century, celebrities discovered St-Paul, and artists, writers, and film-
makers flocked to the village. Expensive hotels and restaurants soon fol-
lowed. A short walk from the entrance to the village is the Fondation
Maeght, one of the best modern art museums in France.
Getting there
The best way to get to St-Paul is to drive. From Nice, take A8 to Cagnes-
sur-Mer and then follow the signs and the Route de la Colle (RD 436) to
St-Paul-de-Vence. The drive from Nice takes about 35 to 40 minutes.
The nearest bus stop is located on the Route de Vence, 0.5km (1⁄4 mile)
from the town ramparts. Buses leave frequently from Nice (31km/19
miles from St-Paul) and the neighboring town of Cagnes-sur-Mer (6km/
4 miles from St-Paul). The bus from Nice (no. 400 or no. 410) costs 4.20€
($5.45), and the bus from Cagnes-sur-Mer costs 2.10€ ($2.75). Call the
bus company Cie SAP (% 04-93-58-37-60) for the schedule. The closest
train station is in Cagnes-sur-Mer, 6km (4 miles) away. The train from
Nice to Cagnes-sur-Mer takes about 7 minutes and costs 2.50€ ($3.25).
For train schedules, call % 3635 within France.
Getting around and getting information
St-Paul is small and easy to walk through. No cars are allowed within the
ramparts, except for people who have reservations at one of the hotels.
If you have a reservation, you can drive in and park at your hotel. The
town has two local cab companies: Taxi Daniel at % 04-93-73-64-30 and
Taxi Jean-Luc at % 06-08-26-11-72.
The tourist office is at 2 rue Grande (% 04-93-32-86-95; Fax: 04-93-32-60-

Chagall. Although it owns an important collection of works (by artists
such as Bonnard, Braque, Calder, Chagall, Giacometti, Matisse, and
Miró), the museum is usually filled with special exhibits drawn from
public and private collections. This museum is large, so you may need to

west of St-Paul. The wine from Le Mas Bernard is very good and unavail-
able in the United States because of the small production.

 Learning breakfast basics

 Negotiating the cheese chariot
T
asting the amazing cuisine of France is one of the best reasons for
visiting the country. Being adventurous is key: Many of the best
foods in France are rarely seen in the United States — and if they are,
they taste better in France. You can put your trust in French chefs
because they take great pride in the freshness and preparation of their
food. Restaurant meals, with five to seven courses, last several hours, so
you’ll need to pace yourself (and don’t fill up on bread, no matter how
wonderful it is).
For more details on French cuisine and many great recipes to try before
and after your trip, see the French cooking section in Cooking Around the
World All-in-One For Dummies (Wiley Publishing, Inc.).
Café au Lait (ca-fay oh LAY)
Café au lait is espresso with steamed milk (similar to a latté you’d order
at any American coffee bar), and it’s the perfect eye-opener for the
morning or pick-me-up for the afternoon. It’s sometimes called a café
crème. No, it isn’t American coffee — it’s much better. What many
French people drink for a quick pick-me-up during the day and also after
meals is un espresso, a tiny cup of very strong . . . well, espresso. For
decaffeinated, ask for café decaffeiné or un déca.

Croissant (kwah-SAWN)
These popular breakfast rolls are pretty much available around the
world now, but if you think you know all about croissants, think again.
Croissants in France, a staple at every bakery in the country, taste very
different from ones you get in other countries. They’re light, flaky, and
irresistibly buttery.
Pain au Chocolat (PAN o shawk-oh-LAH)
A kids’ favorite, this delicious breakfast pastry is a square croissant
filled with dark chocolate, and you’re likely to find one at any bakery
(pâtisserie) in the country. The French eat a light (continental) breakfast
of a croissant and pastry with coffee. That way, they save up big
appetites for lunch and dinner, which are multicourse extravaganzas.
Croque-Monsieur (croak mis-SYER)
Croque-monsieur is ham and melted cheese on a croissant, usually
served open-faced. Available at most cafes, it’s the perfect light lunch
sandwich. A croque madame is the same but with a grilled egg on top.
Escargots (es-car-GO)
Yes, like Lucy Ricardo (remember that episode of I Love Lucy?), while in
France you need to try snails, served in their shells with lots of butter,
garlic, and parsley. They’re luscious, tender little treats, but what you’ll
taste most is garlic. Snails are a true French delicacy.
Bouillabaisse (booh-ya-BESSE)
This hearty fish stew, a meal in itself, is the specialty of Provence (espe-
cially Marseille) and the Riviera. At some restaurants, the fish — many
types — is served separately from the broth. When you’re served the
soup, you may also be served round, toasted pieces of bread and a hot
peppery sauce called rouille. What you do is spread the sauce on the
bread and plop the bread into the stew or pour the broth over the
bread. Then you can add the fish or consume it separately. A cousin of
bouillabaisse is bourride, another authentic fish soup in vogue along the
Mediterranean.
Part VII: The Part of Tens 
484

Cuisses de Grenouilles (cweess 
duh gre-NOO-yuh)
Frogs’ legs do taste a little like chicken, but they’re more delicate and salty.
You’ll find the best examples of this classic French dish in the Loire Valley.
Pâté de Foie Gras (pat-ay duh fwoh GRAH)
A staple of every fancy restaurant in France is goose liver pâté, which is
often à la maison (homemade) and poêlé (pan-fried). Rich and creamy,
with dense flavor and a delicate texture, pâté de foie gras is a quintessen-
tial French food.
Des Truffes (des TROOF)
France’s most expensive food, delectable truffes (truffles) are a rare kind
of black fungus (like mushrooms) that need to be dug out of the ground
by special dogs or pigs trained for the task of locating them. Truffle
season is November to March. Truffles appearing on any dish (aux
truffes) up the price of the meal by 25 or more euros ($30). Look for
them particularly on omelets and pasta.
Chariot de Fromage (chair-ree-aht 
duh frwoh-MAZH)
Ah, the chariot of cheese: brie, camembert, Roquefort, chèvre, Gruyère,
and so on. At the best restaurants, the selection of cheeses is so enor-
mous, it must be wheeled to you on a trolley. When the waiter brings it
over, ask which are the best cheeses of the region (“Les fromages de la
region?”), and choose which ones you want by pointing to several. The
waiter will serve them, and you can eat them with a knife and fork.
Tarte Tartin, Soupe de Fraises, Ile Flotant,
Crème Brûlée, Mousse au Chocolat (tart tah-
TIHN, soup duh FREZ, eel flo-TAHNT, krem
bruh-LAY, moose oh shawk-oh-LAH)
Apple tart, boozy strawberry soup, floating island (meringue with a cus-
tard sauce), custard topped with caramel, chocolate mousse . . . and the
list goes on. Having dessert in a French restaurant is reason enough to
visit the country. C’était bon!

any people come to France specifically to shop (you know who
you are), but this list is more for travelers who, in the midst of
exploring this most special country, want to bring home a gift or two for
those less fortunate. These gift givers often need a bit of direction, so
here are ten perfect gifts that whisper “France.”
If you’re a serious shopper, you may want to buy a copy of Born to 
Shop Paris or Born to Shop France, by Suzy Gershman (both Wiley
Publishing, Inc.).
Scarves in Paris
The first thing you notice about Parisian women is that they’re very styl-
ish. The second thing you notice is that they all wear scarves. So buy a
few for yourself or your significant other. And while you’re at it, buy them
for all your female friends and family. They come in all price ranges —
from the priciest at Hermès to the best bargains at street vendors. And
they’re easy to pack. While searching for the perfect scarves, you may
want to pick up a few neckties for the men on your list, assuming your
male acquaintances still wear them. Once again, a wide range of prices
and styles is available, from vibrant silk Hermès ties to whimsical Tour
Eiffel–patterned ties available at street vendors near — where else? — the
Tour Eiffel.
Stationery in Paris
Although the art of the snail-mail letter is fading fast, you still can find
exquisite papers and stationery sets in Paris’s fine shops, including the

big department stores such as Au Printemps, Au Bon Marché, and
Galeries Lafayette. You’ll find the most original selections at boutiques
on the Left Bank and the least expensive selection in the student area 
of St-Germain-des-Prés.
Quimper Pottery in Brittany
Quimper pottery has been a famous collectible for antiques buffs for
many years. You can buy contemporary examples of the hand-painted
craft at several shops in the town of Quimper, including the premier
maker, H. B. Henriot, which also offers factory tours.
Fishermen’s Sweaters in Brittany
After a day or two on the blustery coast of Brittany, you may be looking
to buy one of those bulky fishermen’s sweaters. The most common
types have blue-and-white or red-and-white horizontal stripes. The best
brands are St. James and Tricommer. These rugged sweaters will last a
lifetime.
Santons in Provence
Made of clay or wood, santons often are hand-painted and highly indi-
vidualistic renderings of ordinary townspeople and their professions
and of saints and nativity cast members. These highly popular collectible
figurines are available throughout Provence and the Riviera.
Fabrics in Provence
Nothing says “Provence” like those brightly colored cotton fabrics sold
all across the south of France. You’ll see the Soulëiado brand and store
name in most towns in Provence and the Riviera. Though the style is imi-
tated heavily, the designs were originated in the 18th and 19th centuries.
They make great tablecloths and napkins, as well as dresses and purses.
You can find them at discount prices at markets in Provence and at
department stores in Paris.
Perfume in Grasse
The town of Grasse on the Riviera is the perfume-making capital of
France. After touring one of the three factories open to tourists —
Molinard, Galimard, and Fragonard — you can sign up for a class to
make your own perfume or buy some of the specially packaged wares. In
Paris, head to rue de Rivoli across from the Louvre for the best perfume
Chapter 23: The Art of the Souvenir: Ten Gifts to Buy in France 487

shops, including those offering discounts. You can find all the top names
here, in addition to some boutique French perfume not easily found in
the United States.
Lingerie on the Riviera
It’s no surprise that the Riviera offers the best lingerie shops anywhere.
You can buy a wide range of top-of-the-line teddies, nightgowns, and
underwear for relatively good prices. Swimsuits (maillot de bain) also
are fun to shop for here, and you’ll find a variety of daring styles.
Because the French practically invented sex appeal and spare no
expense to achieve it, expect to splurge.
Handmade Glass Objects in Biot
The tiny hilltop village of Biot, located between Cannes and Nice on the
Riviera, is France’s capital of glass. You can watch about a dozen top arti-
sans blowing and sculpting exquisite glass objects in its many studios
and galleries. Among the names to look for are Novaro, Saba, and Pierini.
Most of Biot’s galleries will pack and ship their wares internationally.
Cider and Calvados in Normandy
The apple orchards throughout Normandy’s rolling green landscape are
known for producing the exceptional fruits Normans use for a variety of
beverages. They traditionally drink with their meals a light, refreshingly
fizzy cider instead of wine. Bringing a bottle of this cider home will
immediately transport you back to the region’s half-timbered houses.
And after a meal, Normans enjoy Calvados, a fiery brandy served with 
or in coffee. It takes 12 to 15 years to bring this famous liqueur to term.

American Express
American Express’s Paris office (11 rue
Scribe, 9e; % 01-47-77-79-28; Métro:
Opéra, Chausée-d’Antin, or Havre-
Caumartin; RER: Auber) is the largest
American Express office in France, and the
place where lesser branches of American
Express sometimes refer their problems. It
maintains a travel agency and facilities for
resolving problems with stolen or over-
their-limit American Express cards, open
Monday to Saturday 9 a.m. to 6 p.m. Also
on-site is a currency exchange, mail
deposit and pickup, and traveler’s check
service, open Monday to Saturday 9 a.m.
to 6 p.m.
The Nice office (Nice airport; % 04-93-21-
59-79) is open Monday to Friday 7 a.m. to
8:30 p.m.
The Monaco office (35 bd. Princesse
Charlotte; % 93-25-74-45) is open for cur-
rency exchange, traveler’s checks, and
credit-card issues Monday to Friday 9 a.m.
to 5 p.m.
Banks or currency exchange offices in
other cities throughout France act as semi-
autonomous representatives of American
Express, performing limited functions
related mostly to traveler’s checks and
currency exchange. The tourist office in
any French town will be able to direct you
to such an office, if it exists, or to an equiva-
lent bank, travel agent, or currency
exchange office.
ATM Locators
ATMs are widely available throughout the
country. For a list of ATMs that accept
MasterCard or Visa, ask your bank or go to

com.
Business Hours
In Paris, the grands magasins (department
stores) are generally open Monday to
Saturday 9:30 a.m. to 7 p.m.; smaller shops
may close for lunch and reopen at 2 p.m.,
but this schedule is rarer than it used to
be. Many stores stay open until 7 p.m. in
summer; others close on Monday, espe-
cially in the morning. Large offices remain
open all day, although some close for
lunch. Throughout the country, banks are
normally open weekdays 9 a.m. to noon
and 2 to 5:30 p.m. Some banks also open
on Saturday morning. Some currency-
exchange booths are open very long hours
(see “Currency Exchange”). In the rest of
the country, most stores are open 9:30 a.m.
to noon and 2 to 6 p.m., with later hours in
summer.
Credit Cards
Visa, MasterCard, American Express, and
Diners Club are all accepted throughout
the country, but the most commonly
accepted are Visa and MasterCard. See
also “Lost Property.”

Currency Exchange
Banks and bureaux de change (exchange
offices) almost always offer better
exchange rates than hotels, restaurants,
shops, and even American Express
offices, which you should use only in
emergencies. You’ll find exchange offices
in central commercial areas of all towns
and cities in France.
Customs
Non-E.U. nationals can bring the following
items into France duty-free: 200 cigarettes
or 100 cigarillos or 50 cigars or 250 grams
of smoking tobacco; 2 liters of wine and 
1 liter of alcohol more than 38.80 proof; 50
grams of perfume, .25 liter of toilet water;
500 grams of coffee, and 100 grams of tea.
Travelers ages 15 and older can also bring
in 175€ ($228) in other goods; for those 14
and younger, the limit is 90€ ($117). E.U.
citizens may bring any amount of goods
into France, as long as it’s for their per-
sonal use and not for resale.
Returning U.S. citizens who’ve been away
for 48 hours or more are allowed to bring
back, once every 30 days, $800 worth of
merchandise duty-free. You’ll be charged 
a flat rate of 10 percent duty on the next
$1,000 worth of purchases; on gifts, the
duty-free limit is $100. You cannot bring
fresh foodstuffs into the United States;
tinned foods, however, are allowed.
Citizens of the U.K. who are returning from
a European Union country have no limit on
what can be brought back, as long as the
items are for personal use (this includes
gifts), and the necessary duty and tax 
has been paid. Guidance levels are set at
3,200 cigarettes, 200 cigars, 3kg smoking
tobacco, 10 liters of spirits, 90 liters of
wine, and 110 liters of beer.
Canada allows a $750 exemption (which
can be used only once a year), and you’re
allowed to bring back the following items
duty-free: 200 cigarettes, 1.5 liters of wine
or 1.14 liters of liquor, and 50 cigars. In
addition, you may mail gifts to Canada from
abroad at the rate of C$60 a day, provided
they’re unsolicited and don’t contain alco-
hol or tobacco or advertising matter. Write
on the package “Unsolicited gift, under $60
value.” All valuables should be declared
on the Y-38 form before departure from
Canada, including serial numbers of valu-
ables you already own, such as expensive
foreign cameras.
The duty-free allowance in Australia is
A$400 or, for those younger than 18, A$200.
Personal property mailed back from
France needs to be marked “Australian
goods returned” to avoid payment of duty.
Upon returning to Australia, citizens can
bring in 250 cigarettes or 250 grams of
loose tobacco, and 1.125 liters of alcohol. If
you’re returning with valuable goods you
already own, such as foreign-made cam-
eras, you need to file form B263.
The duty-free allowance for New Zealand
is NZ$700. Citizens older than 17 can bring
in 200 cigarettes or 50 cigars or 250 grams
of tobacco (or a mixture of all three if their
combined weight doesn’t exceed 250
grams), plus 4.5 liters of wine or beer or
1.125 liters of liquor.
Dentists
Call your consulate and ask the duty offi-
cer to recommend a dentist. For dental
emergencies in Paris, call SOS Dentaire
(% 01-43-37-51-00) daily 7 a.m. to 8 p.m. If
you’re not in Paris, go to the nearest hospi-
tal, which will have a dentist on duty or
know how to reach one.
Doctors
Call your consulate and ask the duty offi-
cer to recommend a doctor. In Paris, call 
France For Dummies, 4th Edition 
490

SOS Médecins (% 01-47-07-77-77), a 24-
hour service. If you are not in Paris, go to
the local hospital or ask at the police sta-
tion for the number of a doctor who speaks
English. Remember: You need to have your
health insurance card with you unless you
want to pay cash for the services.
Drugstores
Marked with green crosses, pharmacies
are often upscale affairs that sell toiletries
in addition to prescription drugs and over-
the-counter remedies. If you’re shopping
for products other than drugs, it’s almost
always cheaper to buy them elsewhere,
such as a supermarché (supermarket).
Electricity
The French electrical system runs on 220
volts. Adapters to convert the voltage and
fit sockets are cheaper at home than in
Paris. Many hotels have two-pin (in some
cases, three-pin) sockets for electric
razors. It’s a good idea to ask at your hotel
before plugging in any electrical appliance.
Embassies/Consulates
If you have a passport, immigration, legal,
or other problem, contact your consulate.
Call before you go: They often keep
strange hours and observe both French
and home-country holidays. Each of the
following is in Paris: Australia, 4 rue Jean-
Rey, 15e (% 01-40-59-33-00; Métro: Bir-
Hakeim); Canada, 35 av. Montaigne, 8e 
(% 01-44-43-29-00; Métro: Franklin-D-
Roosevelt or Alma-Marceau); New
Zealand, 7 ter rue Léonardo-da-Vinci, 16e
(% 01-45-01-43-43, ext. 280 from 9 a.m.–
1 p.m.; Métro: Victor-Hugo); United
KIngdom, 35 rue Faubourg St-Honoré, 8e
(% 01-44-51-31-00; Métro: Madeleine);
United States, 2 av. Gabriel, 1er (% 01-43-
12-22-22; Métro: Concorde).
Emergencies
Call % 17 for the police. To report a fire,
dial % 18. For an ambulance, call % 15,
or call % 01-45-78-74-52 or 01-45-67-50-50
outside Paris for SAMU (Service d’Aide
Médicale d’Urgence). In Paris, for help in
English, call SOS Help (% 01-46-21-46-46)
between 3 and 11 p.m. The main police sta-
tion (9 bd. du Palais, 4e; % 01-53-71-53-71;
Métro: Cité) is open 24 hours.
Information
Before you go, contact the French
Government Tourist Office at 444 Madison
Ave., 16th Floor, New York, NY 10022-6903
(% 212-838-7800; Fax: 212-838-7855;
www.francetourism.com). Of the
many locations in Paris, try the Office de
Tourisme de Paris at Carrousel du Louvre,
Place de la Pyramide Inversée 99 rue de
Rivoli, 1e (% 08-92-68-30-00 at .34€/45¢
per minute). Each town in France has its
own tourist office, which are listed in the
appropriate chapters of this book.
Internet Access
To surf the Net or check your e-mail, open
an account at a free e-mail provider, such
as Hotmail (www.hotmail.com) or
Yahoo! Mail (www.yahoo.com), and all
you need to check e-mail while you travel
is a Web connection, available at Net
cafes in almost every town in France.
Check with the local tourist office for loca-
tions. After logging on, just point the
browser to your e-mail provider, enter your
username and password, and you have
access to your mail. In addition, you can
open up an e-mail account for reasonable
fees at many post offices in larger towns in
France, because they offer computers for
e-mail and Internet access.
Laundry and Dry Cleaning
To find a laundry, ask at your hotel or con-
sult the Yellow Pages under Laveries pour
Appendix: Quick Concierge 491

particuliers. Take as many 1 or 2€ coins as
you can. Washing and drying 6kg (13 lb.)
costs about 6€ ($7.80). Dry cleaning is net-
toyage à sec; look for shop signs with the
word pressing.
Liquor Laws
Supermarkets, grocery stores, and cafes
sell alcoholic beverages. The legal drink-
ing age is 16. Persons younger than 16 can
be served an alcoholic drink in a bar or
restaurant if accompanied by a parent or
legal guardian. Wine and liquor are sold
every day of the year. Be warned: France
is very strict about drunk-driving laws. If
convicted, you face a stiff fine of 4,500€
($5,850) and a possible prison term of two
months to two years.
Lost Property
Lost property (objets trouvés) offices are 
in most big cities; ask the tourist office for
the location. In Paris, the central office is
Objets Trouvés (36 rue des Morillons, 15e;
% 08-21-00-25-25; Métro: Convention), at
the corner of rue de Dantzig. The office is
open Monday, Wednesday, and Friday 
8:30 a.m. to 5 p.m. and Tuesday and
Thursday 8:30 a.m. to 8 p.m.
If you lose your Visa card, call % 08-92-
69-08-80; for MasterCard, call % 01-45-67-
53-53. To report lost American Express
cards, call % 01-47-77-72-00.
Luggage Storage/Lockers
Most Paris hotels store luggage for free, 
a good idea if you plan to return to Paris
after a tour of the provinces. Also try the
consignes, the luggage offices at large
railway stations. Otherwise, you have to
lug your luggage with you — pack light.
Mail
Every substantial town in France has at
least one post office. Large post offices
tend to be open Monday to Friday 8 a.m. to
7 p.m., and Saturday 8 a.m. to noon; small
post offices may have shorter hours.
Paris’s main post office is at 52 rue du
Louvre, 75001 Paris (% 01-40-28-76-00;
Métro: Louvre-Rivoli). A complete roster of
its services is available at the hours noted
above, but it remains open 24 hours a day
for a limited roster of services that include
buying stamps; weighing and depositing
letters and packages; and handling urgent
mail, telegrams, and telephone calls. It
stores Poste Restante mail sent to you in
care of the post office until you pick it up;
be prepared to show your passport and
pay .45€ (60¢) for each letter you receive.
If you don’t want to use Poste Restante,
you can receive mail in care of American
Express. Holders of American Express
cards or traveler’s checks get this service
free; others have to pay a fee.
Airmail letters and postcards of less than
20 grams (about 3⁄4 ounce) cost .90€ ($1.15)
for destinations in North America, .46€
(60¢) for anywhere within Europe, and .79€
($1.05) for Australia and New Zealand.
Maps
Maps of Paris, printed by the department
stores, are usually available for free at
hotels. The maps are good if you’re visiting
Paris for only a few days and hitting the
major attractions. But if you plan to really
explore all the nooks and crannies of Paris,
the best maps are those of the Plan de
Paris par Arrondissement, pocket-sized
books with maps and a street index, avail-
able at most bookstores. They’re extremely
practical, and prices start at around 8€
($10). Free maps of other French cities,
towns, and villages are available at local
tourist offices.
Newspapers and Magazines
In major cities, newsstands carry the latest
editions of the International Herald Tribune
France For Dummies, 4th Edition 
492

and the major London papers. Time and
Newsweek are readily available. So is USA
Today’s International edition. The weekly
entertainment guide Pariscope, which
comes out on Wednesday, has an English-
language insert that gives you up-to-the-
minute information on the latest cultural
events. You can also get the New York
Times in some of the bigger English-
language bookstores.
Police
Dial % 17 in emergencies.
Restrooms
You can find public restrooms at train sta-
tions, airports, tourist sites, and often
tourist offices. Every cafe has a restroom,
but it’s supposed to be for customers only.
The best plan is to ask to use the tele-
phone; it’s usually next to the toilette. For
.40€ (50¢), you can use the street-side toi-
lets, which are automatically flushed out
and cleaned after every use. Some Métro
stations have serviced restrooms; you’re
expected to tip the attendant .30€ (40¢).
Safety
France, particularly in the provinces, is
safe. Exceptions are the heavily touristed
areas of Provence and the Riviera, which
tend to attract thieves, particularly at train
and bus stations. Paris is a relatively safe
city, and violent crime is rare. Your biggest
risks are pickpockets and purse snatchers,
so be particularly attentive on the Métro
and on crowded buses, in museum lines,
and around tourist attractions. Women
need to be on guard in crowded tourist
areas and on the Métro against overly
friendly men who seem to have made a
specialty out of bothering unsuspecting
female tourists. Tricks include asking your
name and nationality, then sticking like a
burr to you for the rest of the day. They’re
usually more harassing than harmful, but if
you’re too nice, you may be stuck spending
time with someone with whom you prefer
not to. A simple “leave me alone” (laissez-
moi tranquille [“lay-say-mwa tran-keel”])
usually works. Special mention should be
made of Marseille, which is a rough-and-
tumble town. The very high unemployment
means there seem to be a large number of
men loitering around looking for someone
to rob. Watch your back.
Smoking
Restaurants are required to provide no-
smoking sections, though you may sit next
to the kitchen or restrooms. Even here,
your neighbor may light up and defy you to
say something about it. Large brasseries,
expensive restaurants, and places accus-
tomed to dealing with foreigners are likely
to be the most accommodating. Warning:
An impending law may ban smoking from
any public location within Paris.
Taxes
Watch out: You can get burned. As a
member of the European Union, France
routinely imposes a standard 20.6 percent
value-added tax (VAT, in France known as
the TVA) on many goods and services. The
tax on merchandise applies to clothing,
appliances, liquor, leather goods, shoes,
furs, jewelry, perfume, cameras, and even
caviar. You can get a refund — usually 13
percent — on certain goods and merchan-
dise, but not on services. To get a refund,
the minimum purchase is 182€ ($237) in
the same store for nationals or residents of
countries outside the European Union.
Telephone/Telex/Fax
Public phone booths take only telephone
debit cards called télécartes, which can
be bought at post offices and at tabacs
(cafes and kiosks that sell tobacco prod-
ucts). You insert the card into the phone
and make your call; the cost is automati-
cally deducted from the “value” of the
card recorded on its magnetized strip. The
Appendix: Quick Concierge 493

télécarte comes in 50- and 120-unit
denominations, costing 7.45€ and 15€
($9.70 and $20), respectively, and can be
used only in a phone booth.
Cashiers will almost always try to sell you
a card from France Télécom, the French
phone company, but cards exist that give
you more talk time for the same amount of
money. Instead of inserting the card into a
public phone, you dial a free number and
tap in a code. The cards come with direc-
tions, some in English, and can be used
from public and private phones, unlike
France Télécom’s card. Look for tabacs
that have advertisements for Delta
Multimedia or Kertel, or ask for a télécarte
international avec un code.
To place international calls from France,
dial 00, the country code (for the United
States and Canada, 1; for Britain, 44; for
Ireland, 353; for Australia, 61; for New
Zealand, 64), the area or city code, and
then the local number (for example, to call
New York, you’d dial 00 + 1 + 212 +
000-0000). To place a collect call to North
America, dial 00-33-11, and an English-
speaking operator will assist you. Dial
0800-99-00-11 for an AT&T operator; World
Phone 0800-99-00-19; Sprint 0800-99-00-87.
To call from France to anywhere else in
France (called province), always dial ten
digits. The country is divided into five
zones with prefixes of 01, 02, 03, 04, and 05;
check a phone directory for the code of
the city you’re calling.
If you’re calling France from the United
States, dial the international prefix, 011;
then the country code for France, 33; fol-
lowed by two-digit city code and the eight-
digit local number, but leave off the initial
zero on the two-digit city code (for exam-
ple, 011 + 33 + 1-0-00-00-00-00).
Avoid making phone calls from your hotel
room; many hotels charge at least .30€
(40¢) for local calls, and the markup on
international calls can be staggering.
You can send telex and fax messages at
the main post office in any town, but it’s
often cheaper at your hotel or at a neigh-
borhood printer or copy shop.
Time
Paris is six hours ahead of eastern stan-
dard time (EST); noon in New York is 6 p.m.
in France.
Tipping
Service is supposedly included at your
hotel, but the custom is to tip the bellhop
about 1€ ($1.30) per bag, more in expen-
sive hotels. If you have a lot of luggage, tip
a bit more. Don’t tip housekeepers unless
you do something that requires extra work.
Tip a few euros if a reception staff member
performs extra services.
Although your addition or note (restaurant
bill) or fiche (cafe check) bear the words
service compris (service charge included),
always leave a small tip (5 percent is
acceptable).
Taxi drivers appreciate a tip of at least
.50€ (65¢). When the fare exceeds 15€
($20), a 5-percent to 10-percent tip is
appropriate. At the theater and cinema, tip
.50€ (65¢) if an usher shows you to your
seat. In public toilets, a fee is often posted.
If not, the maintenance person expects a
tip of .30€ (40¢), usually in a basket or
plate at the entrance. Porters and cloak-
room attendants are usually governed by
set prices, which are displayed. If not, 1€
to 1.25€ ($1.30–$1.65) per suitcase, and
.30€ to 1€ (40¢–$1.30) per coat is fine.

Trains
The telephone number for reservations on
France’s national railroads (SNCF) is 
% 08-36-35-36-35, or to get an English-
speaking operator % 08-36-35-35-39 (.30€/
40¢ per minute). The service is available
within France every day from 6:30 a.m. to
10 p.m., and telephone wait times can be
interminable. A more convenient, and less
expensive, means of gathering railway
schedules and fares, buying tickets, and
reserving seats is the SNCF’s Web site at
www.sncf.com. Remember: Depending
on the train, you’ll validate your train ticket
in the orange composteur (ticket validator)
on the platform, or (in the cases of long-
distance rides beyond the limits of greater
Paris) have it validated manually by an
onboard conductor.
Water
Tap water in France is perfectly safe, but if
you’re prone to stomach problems, you
may prefer to drink bottled water.
Weather Updates
Call % 08-99-70-12-34 (.30€/40¢ per
minute) for France and abroad; % 08-92-
68-02-75 (.30€/40¢ per minute) for Paris
and the Ile de France.
