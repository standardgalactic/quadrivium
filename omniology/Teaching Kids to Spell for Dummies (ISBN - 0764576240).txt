About the Author
Tracey Wood was born in England. She went to teachers college in Leeds and
graduated with an honors degree in Psychology and Education. She taught in
a special school for four years and loved it. But sunnier climes called and she
left England for a backpacking vacation in Australia. Twelve years later, she
was still enjoying the warmth of Australia and had traded her backpack for a
husband and two kids. 
In Australia, Tracey earned a Diploma in Special Education and a Master’s
degree in Education. For several years she ran a high school special educa-
tion unit and then started her own reading clinic. In the 90s, Tracey moved to
the San Francisco Bay Area, where she  set up a reading and writing clinic,
helped in her kids’ school, led two scouting troops, instructed for the Red
Cross, created her Web site (www.readingpains.com) and wrote her first book,
See Johnny Read! — The 5 Most Effective Ways to End Your Son’s Reading
Problems.
Still on the move (with her husband’s job), Tracey relocated to Toronto and
wrote her second book, Teaching Kids to Read For Dummies (Wiley). Tracey is
now a literacy consultant, writer, and public speaker. She’s the kids’ reading
and writing expert on www.LDonline.com and www.kidslinktoronto.com, she
contributes articles to magazines like Big Apple Parent and Teachers of Vision,
and she’s committed to steering (albeit unsteadily) her two children through
childhood with all their limbs and faculties in tact.


Dedication
When I asked my youngest child what she’d like me to say about her if I were
to mention her in my book, she said I should say, “Her beauty is greater than
the golden sun high above.” When I asked my oldest child the same question,
she said, “Say I’m more beautiful than her.” So there you are, I said it.  This
book is for both of you, so utterly and equally amazing!

Introduction 
W
ant to steer rather than drag your child through words like beautiful
and they’re? Mystified that she can read the entire works of Tolkien
(if she really wanted to) but can’t spell throat? Hoping to preempt spelling
saboteurs like meny and untill? Have I got great news for you!
Ta-da! The cavalry has arrived! This book gives a resounding boot to the typi-
cal tedium of spelling lessons and champions the cause of concerned but
busy people like you (who can easily doze off at the mere hint of blah, blah,
blah). Teaching Kids to Spell For Dummies is exactly right for you. It gives you
practical activities that really work. It’s easy to follow, pick and choose from,
and come back to. It doesn’t ask you to buy extras, and all you really need for
an immediate start is paper and pen. Oh, and there’s an added bonus. Right
here in these pages I put jokes that are, let’s just say, acute.
But what about your child, what’s in this book for him or her? I can almost
hear that devilish groan, so just for your child, I’ve packed this book with
memory joggers and appetizing, bite-sized pieces of information. If your child
makes careless spelling errors, this book can sharpen his eye with the proof-
reading and dictation activities that I dole out in The Part of Tens. If she can’t
write long-vowel sounds, she’ll make quick progress with the easy rules I pro-
vide in Part III. If he’s been making basic mistakes for a while, he can rebuild
his skills from the short-vowel sounds that I give you in Part II.
To help your child get a solid grasp of spelling, you need practical, good
sense information. And that’s exactly what you find here in these pages.
Welcome!

Teaching Kids to Spell For Dummies 
About This Book
Regardless of whether you’re a shaky speller or friends marvel at your
adverbs, whether your child’s a beginner or practically a veteran, or whether
you’re apprehensive about teaching or can’t wait to begin, this book is for you.
That’s because you can surf through it or immerse yourself chapter by chap-
ter, as you need. So much spelling information is here in this book that you’re
assured of getting the guidance you’re looking for, whatever your needs. And
you’ll love “The Part of Tens” at the end of this book, where you get quick
lists, each of ten items, of all the really handy stuff.
Foolish Assumptions
Because you’re reading this book I’m assuming:
 You’d like to help a child become a better speller but need cheerful,
plain-talking guidance.
 You have interest and enthusiasm but not unlimited time.
 You’d like pointers as you go so you know whether you’re doing 
things right.
What You’re Not to Read
Many books about spelling are full of forced rules. They have you making
strange pronunciations and give you rules that hardly ever work even after
you’ve stretched and rolled your tongue obligingly. This book isn’t like that. 
It gives you a few rules that really work, and if I use jargon, I warn you in
advance so you can skip it if you want to. In addition to a few bits of jargon, 
I spice up each chapter with sidebars. Sidebars offer bonus or additional
information that may be anything from a cute story to illustrate a point to a
quick detour into an extra activity you may think you’d like to try out. In
other words, you can skip the sidebars if you’re in a rush; but if you like
quirky stuff and diversions, you’ll definitely enjoy them.

Introduction
Conventions Used in this Book
To “he” or not to “he?” In this book I clean up that sticky dilemma by using
“he” and “she” interchangeably. You can be sure that this book is for and
about all kids, and after you’re used to switching between he’s and she’s,
you’ll probably think all other books should do the same.
How This Book Is Organized
This book has six parts:
Part I: Understanding the 
Basics of Good Spelling
Some kids seem to have an amazing-speller gene. Most kids have to work at
it. Your child probably thinks twice about how to spell twice and scrabbles
for scrap paper to figure out probably. The good news is that the tips, rules,
and activities in this book can help your child. This part of Teaching Kids To
Spell For Dummies outlines them for you along with the best ways to teach
them. You get a lightning tour of stuff like digraphs, letter orientation, and
phonemic awareness, so you don’t feel like you never got the memo when
you read more about them later.
Part II: Getting Easy Words onto Paper
You’re going to hear quite a bit about short vowels in this book. Short vowels
are solid and predictable letters that your child writes in an awful lot of words,
putting them into words like put and can and stringing them into big words
like introduction. Part II shows you how to take your child carefully through
the short-vowel words and spelling chunks to build a set of spelling skills on
a strong foundation.

4
Teaching Kids to Spell For Dummies 
Part III: Getting to Grips 
with Long Vowel Sounds
This part of the book shows you how to make short work of spelling long-
vowel sounds. Long-vowel sounds are a definite problem area for kids, but
this section gives you three simple rules to make things easy. In addition, 
you find out the ins and outs of sight words or most common words. You’re
told why teachers fuss so much about sight words, and how to get one step
ahead. I give you a list of 220 sight words that comprise a whopping 70 percent
of all the words in regular text. When you explain how to spell these words,
you iron out any frequent errors that your child makes.
Part IV: Using Word Families
Words are easier to remember when you classify or group them. All, for
example, is a forgettable word until you show your child that it fits snuggly
inside a whole army of words like ball, call, tall, and small. Words like right
belong with fight, might, and tight, and there’s no end to the words your child
can make from a spelling chunk like ou. Part Four shows you these word 
families.
Part V: Spelling Words in Chunks
Part V shows you how to make sure that your child figures out words
methodically, starting at the beginning, moving to the middle, and finishing
up at the end. Here you show your child how to gain control of even the
longest of words. I talk about contractions in this section, too. Not the stork-
visiting-in-the-middle-of-the-night kind, but rather the ones that squeeze
words like has not into hasn’t. You see how syllables and contractions work
and how to steer your child past the pitfalls that kids often fall into.
Part VI: The Part of Tens
The Part of Tens is where I boil down heaps of useful information into super
easy lists. Here you get “Ten Word Families,” “Ten (or More) Group Activities
that Rock,” and “Ten (Okay, Eleven) Spelling Games for Car Trips.”

Icons Used in This Book
You see this icon whenever I give information that’s really worth hanging onto.
Here’s something you DON’T want to do. It’s easy to make mistakes, so this
icon warns you about land mines that cause them.
Here’s your jargon alert. Skip ahead or brace yourself for the particulars!
This icon means I’m offering a golden nugget of handy advice that I’ve 
probably learned firsthand.
This handy icon helps you spot the fun activities that appear throughout 
the book.
Where to Go from Here
If you’re ready to leap straight into action, go to Chapter 4. This chapter
shows you how to muster a firm grip on short vowels not just so you can
spell easy words, but so your child can spell the small chunks found inside
big words later on. If you’re working with a child who’s already good with
short-vowel sounds, go to Chapter 7. Long-vowel sounds also can trip up
your child, so this chapter shows you exactly how to make the long-vowel
thing clear. In Chapters 8 and 9, I continue talking about long vowels, because
there’s plenty to find out about them. From Chapter 10 onward, I explain stuff
like word families and sight words, but don’t worry, I inject fun into every
task so you won’t start off enthusiastically only to wake up with a stiff neck
an hour later. If you’re not in that much of a rush, you can enjoy the traditional
journey through this book. Start at Chapter 1 and take a straight path all the
way through the book. Although this book is arranged so you can pick and
choose topics, it also follows a logical progression.

Teaching Kids to Spell For Dummies 

Part I
Understanding the
Basics of Good
Spelling

In this part . . . 
You’re going to help a child spell better. Do you need
to focus on single letters? Do you need to know about
phonics? Do you need a new dictionary? Part I answers all
of these questions and much more. It tells you why
chunks of sound are key, what a good eye is, and why you
need to encourage your child to always “have a go” at
spelling unfamiliar words.

Chapter 1
Thinking Like a Spelling Teacher
In This Chapter
 Introducing the cornerstones of good teaching
 Getting ready, getting set
 Making an early start
 Busting through the jargon
G
reat teachers take care of all kinds of kids. They climb aloft to reach 
the highly strung, fix their acts for the divas, and tread warily around
kids who rule their parents with iron fists. They seem to have every kind of
book and brainstorm at their fingertips and manage to serve it all up with a
generous dollop of Zen. What’s their thing? Can anyone else get some of it?
Can others do effective work without piercing their tongues and going back
to college to learn it? Of course! This book piles you up with easy, practical
strategies and awfully shrewd insights. Although you may not get the whole
Zen thing, and, of course, you miss out on tongue piercing, you nevertheless
get a down-to-earth spelling plan. And to add to all that, you get quick yet
constructive stuff to do while chugging the kids off to soccer or coercing a
cart of chicken noodles and ice cream (you made the mistake of shopping
with the kids) through that traitorous slowest-of-all checkout line.
For now, though, don’t worry too much about the details, because this is
your introductory overview. 
In this chapter, I start you gently on your spelling journey by taking a look 
at learning principles, which are otherwise known as all that stuff that great
teachers have on their minds before they even get your child to take his 
coat off.
Understanding How Learning Works
Great teachers are nice people. They know that your child learns best when
he’s happy and actively engaged, so they find cool kid things for him to do.
They’re flexible. They try to think from your child’s perspective and inject

fun into every activity. And they see your child and everyone else’s pretty
much as family — quirky, often difficult, and excitable for sure, but family
nevertheless. So, you’re asking, what, specifically, do great teachers advise?
Read on.
Showing and practicing
You can’t just pile information onto your child and expect it to stick. 
Instead, you need to help him become active and involved in learning — as
soon as possible. To help you do that, here’s a three-step guide for getting
your child actively engaged:
1. Show your child what to do.
2. Give your child plenty of assistance as you practice whatever it is 
you’re doing.
3. Watch and applaud whenever your child independently engages in a
learning activity.
Sharing
Sharing also is an important part of learning. Your child thrives on your com-
pany, attention, and (deserved) praise. Whenever you can, join in your child’s
learning. When he’s figuring out spellings (that is the entire idea, right?), hang
with him and give him your support. A number of good ways to do your part
in supporting your child include
 Showing that spelling in chunks (as in ac-count) makes more sense than
spelling in single letters. I talk more about spelling in chunks in Part V.
 Showing that some sounds are spelled with single letters (like t) but
others are spelled with two or more letters (like ch, ou, and eigh).
 Letting your child know that most words are spelled in logical chunks of
sound (that match, or sort of match, the spelling chunks), but that odd
words, like who, aren’t worth sounding out. In those cases, your child
just needs to get to know how they look.
 Writing common word families on a poster for your child to refer to (like
the ight family: light, sight, and might) and telling your child about any
new families whenever he comes across them. I deal with word families
in Chapters 10 and 11.
 Taking time to check that your child writes all the sight words easily. If a
few of them happen to get away, have him jot them down and focus on
them for a few days. You can find all the ins and outs of sight words in
Chapter 12.
10
Part I: Understanding the Basics of Good Spelling 

 Explaining how some sounds are spelled in more than one way (like bait
and bay; sent and cent).
 Explaining that vowels always represent a few sounds (like in mat 
and mate).
 Walking your child through common spelling chunks (like ou and oi).
 Explaining that developing a good eye for correct spellings is as much a
part of being a good speller as knowing all the rules. (Which word looks
right, they or thay?)
 Showing your child that sometimes a letter is written when there’s no
sound at all (like in gnat and silent e on the end of words like cute). In
Chapter 13, I delve into silent letters, and you can find out about the
silent-e-on-the-end rule in Chapter 7.
 Making sure that you tell your child that proofreading is really important.
Knowing when to back off
Have you ever had someone show you a photo album by holding onto it 
possessively while pointing out each shot? You know, someone who’s so
interested in the photos that she doesn’t realize how irritating it is for you.
Hanging onto stuff while showing it also switches off your child’s interest.
Just like you, your child wants to be the one doing the holding and showing.
She wants to get that cool feeling of being in control. Whenever you can, let
your child hold the book, the pens, or the worksheet. Having ownership and
control means she can learn much more than if she thinks she’s learning only
your stuff. Make your child a willing and engaged learner by backing off and
giving her a lead role. Your role needs to be that of facilitator, supporter, and
guide — not hog-everything, bossy-britches.
Solving problems
You can help your child figure out spellings in different ways. If he’s stuck on
the word “library,” for example, you can tell him, “Library’s spelled l-i-b-r-a-r-y,”
or you can say something like, “Library can be tricky, because it’s spelled li-
bra-ry. Jot all of that down, and see what you get.” The first option works, but
the second works better. It makes your child do the things that good spellers
do. A good speller:
 Says the word to herself
 Breaks the word into chunks
 Jots down the chunks
 Looks to see whether the finished word looks right
11
Chapter 1: Thinking Like a Spelling Teacher

When your terrific speller has done all of that, something occurs to her. She
mentally notes that, yes, she can figure out spellings by going through logical
steps. Even if her very last step is to ask you to correct her word, that’s still
fine. She’s gone through the whole process by herself up to that point, so she’s
actively learning. In the process, she’s remembering the spelling a zillion times
better than when her very first step was to give no thought to the word other
than to try to weasel the spelling out of you.
Have your child figure out as much of the word as possible before asking you
for help finishing it off, but bear in mind that some words really try a child’s
patience. Take the word patience. If you insist that your child figure it out
alone, you may just be driving him into a frenzy. Cut him some slack. Adopt a
general policy of having your child take a try before demanding satisfaction,
but give her help with words whose parts he isn’t yet familiar with.
Having a reason to spell well
Your child likes to have a genuine reason to spell. Ask your child to write lists
and notes as often as you can so he sees that spelling isn’t just a classroom
thing but rather is a necessity, or at least an asset, in the real world. If your
child isn’t convinced, you may want to run these reasons why kids need to
learn to spell well past him:
 Teachers and classmates expect good spellers to be pretty clever 
all-round.
 Good spellers are more likely to be called upon by teachers to do
responsible jobs that require some writing (like making posters to 
advertise school performances).
 Good spellers get better grades for written work.
 Computer spell-checkers don’t catch all spelling errors.
 Job applications with spelling errors get rejected.
 People judge you by your spelling (and that includes friends, boyfriends
and girlfriends, and people in workplaces).
Having your child say 
and then spell words
You’re going to hear a lot about the importance of having your child say words
in chunks and then jot down those chunks. Even when this habit sounds down-
right obvious to you, your child may not do it instinctively and instead may
need you to make things clear. After you do, your child will be off and running.
To quickly take your child through the saying-in-chunks part of spelling, lead
her through the “What’s in a word?” activity.
12
Part I: Understanding the Basics of Good Spelling 

Activity: What’s in a word?
Preparation: Open your copy of Teaching Kids to Spell For Dummies to the list
of words in this activity. 
Follow these steps:
1. Read these words out loud to your child.
2. Ask your child to tell you what chunks of sound she hears in them.
Demonstrate by saying, “Inside is made of in-side.”
I talk about breaking words into chunks in Chapter 15. I tell you the rules
for breaking words into chunks but let you know that it really doesn’t
matter where your child breaks words as long as she says all the bits. In
this activity, don’t worry about where those breaks go (your child may
say di-no-saur or din-o-saur); just listen to make sure your child gets the
basics of chunking.

Chapter 1: Thinking Like a Spelling Teacher
And the winner is . . . 
This kind of conversation usually strikes a chord with parents:
You: It’s not a competition.
Your child: I know, but if it was, I’d win.
You: Yes, but it isn’t.
Your child: But I’d win.
You: It is not a competition!
Your child: I’d still win.
Your child likes to win. Build some healthy competition into spelling
activities whenever you can. Lose competitions to your child if
you want to (after all, you are the adult), but be convincing. Your
child won’t like being patronized.

Keeping things short and sweet
Sometimes you see a fixed look in your child’s eyes and know that he isn’t lis-
tening to a word you’re saying. You’re telling him stuff that you already said a
thousand times before (“Put your shoes in the closet”), but you’re using 60
words rather than 6 (“Shoes get in the way and people trip over them. They
bring dirt in and . . . “). That, or he has far more interesting things on his
mind. To save yourself disappointment, get real. Your child has a short atten-
tion span and is easily distracted. It isn’t his fault when he gets that fixed
stare, and in any case, he’s the kid, and you’re the grown-up. Keeping things
short and sweet is up to you.
Lightening up
When you teach your child how to spell you have to be organized and 
authoritative, but other factors are just as important. When kids are asked
what they want in a new teacher, they say that they want the teacher to:
 Like them
 Care about them
 Be nice to them
14
Part I: Understanding the Basics of Good Spelling 

 Smile at them
 Be happy
 Not yell
 Look nice
 Understand what a kid’s life is like
So maintain a warm and happy tone. That way you keep your child equally as
sweet-tempered.
A kitchen timer can come in handy for taking breaks. Have your child set the
timer for a 10-minute break so she knows what’s happening and when and that
she has plenty of control.
Making a big deal about motivation
When the word “motivation” crops up, most people think of tangible rewards.
Tangible rewards (like toys, candy, and extra TV) do, of course, motivate, but
rewards that involve your child’s feelings and perceptions are even better. If
your child wants to please you or feel proud, she’s naturally motivated, and
15
Chapter 1: Thinking Like a Spelling Teacher
Mood lifters
To ward off that heinous “How much longer?”
question, try these temper-sweetening tactics:
 Change scenery. Move onto the floor, into
another room, or onto the porch.
 Have a snack. Give your child’s spirits and
blood sugar a lift with high-protein snacks
like peanut butter on toast.
 Take a break. Your child’s best attention
span is pretty short, and yours probably isn’t
as long as you’d think.
 Get moving. A few shots at the hoop or a
walk around the block can get all those
feel-good chemicals whizzing around in
your brains.
 Put on your child’s favorite CD. Soft or
familiar music is soothing and helps your
child focus better.
 Give your child a hug. Touch is a natural
calmer.
 Offer your child incentives. Avoid giving
food and TV time if you can. Opt instead for
games together, outings to the playground,
and extra bedtime reading.
 Have timeout for you. If you get tense and
frazzled, your child will. too, so don’t let
things go that far.
 Give your child choices. Let your child
decide when he does his activities and
takes breaks. (“You have a violin lesson at
4:30, do you want to do your 30 minutes of
spelling before then or after dinner?”)

you don’t have to buy new toys and videos in the process. Natural (or inter-
nal) motivation is inexpensive, wholesome, and enduring. In practical terms,
your child gets a natural boost when you’re with her when she does her
spelling. The same is true when you offer helpful suggestions (without steam-
rolling her) and when you comment on her perseverance, neatness, and clev-
erness. Praising her correct spellings and sympathizing with her when she
struggles, having her take breaks and change activities frequently, and singing
her praises to friends and family also are as beneficial as hanging with her
after spelling sessions to shoot basketballs, throw a baseball, or simply chat.
The kinds of comments that count as downers or mood busters include ones
like these:
 “I told you already to get your book!”
 “We looked at that word yesterday; you must know it!”
 “You’re not trying.”
 “Think!”
 “Look at the word!”
 “Concentrate!”

Charts — The vital measurements
I know, I know, I just wrote, “I won’t bore you
with the details,” but a thought just occurred to
me. What if you actually haven’t heard much
about making charts? Well, this sidebar is for
readers who want or don’t mind checking out a
few pointers:
 Phrase your points in positive (rather than
negative) terms. Instead of using phrases
like, “Don’t yell at your sister (or one day I
swear I’ll crack!),” make points like, “Talk in
a polite way.”
 Limit points to only three or four; otherwise,
your child (an you for that matter) may find
remembering everything she’s supposed to
be doing a hard thing to do.
 Get maximum input from your child. Discuss
why you need a chart, what she’ll gain from
it, and what information needs to be listed.
Have her make final decisions (after you
artfully elicit what you want, of course).
Have her write the chart, decorate it, and
post it where she wants it to be (again after
you’ve steered things in the right direction).
 Figure out a manageable rewards system.
Start with things like play dates or sleep-
overs for 20 points rather than a holiday for
two in Barbados.
 Never, ever take points away.

Charts
Small kids like points charts (one point for nice manners, one point for a tidy
room, and so on). If you get your child to make his own chart, he’ll probably
like it even better. I won’t bore you with the details of allocating points for
good behavior and limiting yourself to only three or four sought-after behav-
iors, because you’ve probably already heard that to death, but remember to
include charts in your mental list of cool writing tasks.
Gathering Your Tools
A friend of mine once told me that his personal, all-to-himself space steadily
diminished from the time his kids were born. Before kids, he said, his whole
house was his personal space, give or take a few square feet for his wife.
When his kids were toddlers his personal space was a room. When his kids
were mobile, but still small, his space became a desk. At the time of our con-
versation, with school-age kids, he maintained that his personal space was

Points and profanity
My youngest child recently discovered the joys
of expressing herself with profanities. It flum-
moxed me. If I ignored her, I ran the risk of the
neighbors hearing. If I responded, well then
she’s gotten the attention she’s after. It was 
a delicate situation, so I responded with a wal-
loping heavy hand. I presented my daughter
with a three-checks-and-you’re-out system. 
An expletive earned her a check, and three
checks meant no Girl Scout camp. The system
was airtight. She soon got three checks and
sobbed. . .and sobbed. I had a new dilemma 
on my hands. Was she truly remorseful? Does
remorse excuse past indiscretions? How come
I’d been fool enough to deprive myself of pos-
sibly the only peaceful weekend that I’ll get 
this year? Well anyway, I don’t want to use you
readers as my personal psychotherapists, so 
I’ll cut to the chase. Out of this whole sorry busi-
ness came a new chart. My daughter asked if
she could write a positives chart (like we used
to use in the days when I still had a heart). She
scurried off with markers and poster paper and
surfaced with a new system. She explained it 
to me, asked if she could start her good behav-
ior immediately (like I’d say, “Uh no, maybe you
should stick with the bad behavior for a few
days”) and went off to sweep and dust my base-
ment, organize the new bookshelf, bring fire-
wood in, and clean the windows. When my
house looked like someone else’s, I fetched 
her chart. Putting past differences behind me
(pretty graciously I thought), I awarded her four
whole points. (Oh, and at the time of this writing,
camp’s still on.)

one drawer that he, luckily, still had the key to. I know just what that friend
feels like. My kids frequently lose their own scissors, tape, and erasers and
have no compulsion about pilfering my desk. “But I have to hand this report
in tomorrow,” or “I’ll put it back,” they say. Yeah, right! Gather (and hide) your
personal items, and organize and stow safely away the pens and paper that
you need. Achieve this state of grace through iron resolve and a keep-your-
thieving-hands-off policy (or by squirreling these items away under sofas and
piles of socks just before spelling time).
Kits
Scour your toyshop, and you’re sure to find some kind of word-building kit.
Often it’s a nifty case in which letter tiles and activity cards all fit snuggly. Kids
love kits and do miles of spelling with them. They like fitting tiles into their
right places, getting the better of whole stacks of work cards, and carrying
the case around. Add a kit to your games stash, and you’ll be glad you did.
Don’t forget to admire the case and it’s owner; otherwise, with no one to notice
it, the ensemble (and its benefits) won’t be half as attractive to your child.
For educational games you can view and buy on the Internet, check out
www.EducationalLearningGames.com. A particularly good spelling kit for
beginning spellers is Spell Time by Cadaco, which has the Parenting Center
seal of approval, and a favorite spelling game for the entire family is Quiddler.
To view both games and many more, click on the “Spelling” option in the menu.

good spelling resources and games. The reviewers do their reviewing consci-
entiously and with fervor.
Flashcards
Flashcards sometimes get a bad rap. People grab handfuls of cards from
boxes they buy at the store, wave them at their child and wonder why she
goes off to watch TV instead of getting caught up in the excitement.
Flashcards aren’t a substitute for absent adults, but they’re great learning
tools when you use them with your child in a systematic and interactive way.
The trick is to take part but not take on too much in one go. If you’re showing
your child how to spell ain words, a bunch of ain flashcards are all that you
need. Two hundred mixed spellings, all flashed at your child in one sitting,
won’t help him much. That said, here are some terrific, inexpensive sets of
flashcards. They come in sturdy boxes that you can take with you every-
where, and you can pick them up at any good school supplies store.

Hands-on with flashcards
Not sure what to do with the flashcards you
bought? First, select from your cards only the
ones that you want your child to focus on for
now. Then:
 Have your child look at one word at a time,
cover it, and either spell it out verbally to
you or write it down. (The verbal response
is good for in the car.)
 Have your child spread the words face
down on the floor, pick out one word at a
time, peek at it, and then spell it verbally to
you.
 Have your child write or verbally spell the
words that you read out loud.
 Have your child look at ten words for one
minute then spell them (in writing or ver-
bally) as you call each one out.
 Have your child look at ten words and then
spell them back to you as you read them out
in clue form. (“This word starts with st.”)
 Have your child spread ten words face up
on the floor and study them for one minute.
Take a word away, have him guess which
word’s missing, and then have him spell it
out. To make this task more challenging, mix
up the cards after he’s had his first look.
 Have your child look at ten words from a
word family (all, call, ball, and so on) and
then spell out as many of the words as he
can remember.
 Give your child rhyming clues for spellings.
(“This word rhymes with pear.”)
 Get your child to spell homonyms (“What’s
the other way to spell s-o-n?”). For this you
can use Homonyms Match flashcards by
Judy/Instructo.
 Have your child spell words from picture
clues. A good set of cards for this is Easy

some smart newspaper article and hit a word like ontologism. You do? He does?
That’s great. Regular, routine habits like these influence your child the most.

The computer spell-checker
When my husband first plunked a computer down in our spare room, I was
skeptical. Did we really need to fancy up our lives quite so dramatically. That
was a long time ago, and now I’m practically tethered to my computer. And I
get more and more dependent on the spell-checker. Your child will too (if it
hasn’t happened already), so now you see where all that proofreading that I
talked about earlier comes into its own. Is your child’s proofreading keeping
pace with his lightning-fast reflex for clicking on the spell-checker?
Watching for Readiness
When it comes to spelling, what’s normal comes in a wide range. Your child
develops prespelling skills, such as hearing the parts inside of words and

Let’s hear it for the boys
By now you’ve all heard that boys lag behind
girls in picking up books and jotting down sto-
ries. Boys consistently score lower in reading
tests than girls, and when they’re asked about
books and libraries, they say that they’re really
not all that interested. The good news is that
much more is now known about making read-
ing better for boys. Many of the things that we
know about boys and reading also apply to boys
and spelling, including that boys like:
 Information in short blasts
 Nonfiction
 Searching for information to solve real
problems
 Comics, magazines, sports pages, and com-
puter games
Ah ha. Computer games. You can make the most
of that. A study of boys’ spelling in the United
Kingdom found that computers actually help
boys with their spelling. When groups of boys
spelled words and then fixed them either with
pen and paper and a dictionary or a com-
puter spell-checker, the spell-checker kids
made spectacular gains. How so? Research-
ers believe that using the spell-checker doesn’t
imprint spellings on boys’ minds, but rather 
it engages kids in active inquiry. The spell-
checker kids had to put their words into the
checker and then consider whether the an-
swers they got applied. Whenever the answers
didn’t apply, they had to resort to paper and pen.
All the problem solving and figuring out fired up
the boys’ interests so that their answers were
best. The message for parents: Don’t fight your
son’s computer worship, tap into it.

drawing circles and lines, at around age 2. Later, when your child starts kinder-
garten or school, she brings home never-ending strings of writing with no
spaces between words. In the next few paragraphs, I take a look at the pieces
that come together to set your child securely on the path to spelling well.
Getting an early start
Plenty of the things that you do with your preschooler set the stage for your
child gaining spelling prowess. You probably don’t even realize that you’re
already doing a great job of preparing your child to spell. In fact, take a look
at this list and for every activity that you get your child to do, give yourself a
pat on the back.
 Bats, balls, and bicycles: Toys like these, which make your child move,
help develop gross motor coordination. You may not think these skills
have much bearing on your child’s future spelling, but studies show that
when kids go through a course of motor skill development, their acade-
mic performance also improves. Some learning centers make the most 
of this benefit by having kids bounce on trampolines or jump rope for a
while before settling down to write.

35 percent satisfaction guaranteed
You can find this poem on a zillion Web sites. It
shows just how wrong your child’s writing can
be even after she’s run it through a spell-
checker. If she hasn’t already come upon the
poem in school, find out whether she can cor-
rect the mistakes now. Moral: Don’t dispense
with the noble practice of proofreading just yet.

— Sauce unknown

 Modeling compound (Play Doh), beads and thread, LEGOs, puzzles,
and blocks: When you provide all this nice stuff for your child to play
with, you’re not just giving him fun things to do, you’re also helping 
his fine-motor coordination. Be especially conscious of your son’s fine-
motor coordination because it lags a little behind his sister’s.
 Pens, pencils, markers, crayons, paper, whiteboards, blackboards,
and paint: These media encourage creativity, something that your child
can never have too much of.
 Rhymes, songs and poems: Nice-sounding rhymes, songs, and poems
get your child listening to sound chunks. Later, your child starts to spell
by repeating those sound chunks either out loud or to herself.
 Listening and word games (like “I Spy” and “Going to Aunt Maud’s,”
described in Chapter 21): Again, the hearing part of spelling is impor-
tant, and these kind of games home in on that.
 Educational TV and CDs: Fun, clever and easy avenues for your child to
discover spelling techniques.
 Books, comics, magazines and posters: With short blasts of text that need
to be watched especially closely, these works help your child develop an
ever-so-helpful good eye for spelling. An extra bonus that accompanies
comics and magazines is that they usually include word games.
 Cards, letters, and notes: Again, reading and writing these items makes
your child looking closely at spellings, and that’s always good.
Kids love to have their own space stocked with pencils, paper, glue, scissors,
and markers. Regardless of whether it’s a cardboard box or a real desk, a
messy or tidy zone, or whether it’s situated in the kitchen or in your child’s
own room, it can be a creative haven.
Paying attention to posture 
and pencil grip
Are you amazed by how your 9-year-old still starts a meal with his chair at a
45-degree angle about a foot away from the table? I am. It isn’t just meals that
can send your child into a daze; the same thing can happen when he writes.
When your child gets ready to put his pen to paper, make sure that his chair
is pulled comfortably to the table and he looks relaxed but not on the verge
of snoozing. Teachers typically tell beginning writers these kinds of things:
 Hold your pencil between your thumb and pointer finger and then let it
rest on the third finger.
 Hold the pencil on the paint, not on the exposed wood near the point.
22
Part I: Understanding the Basics of Good Spelling 

A few of the things you can do to help your child keep this hold are
• Put a rubber band on the pencil above the exposed wood near the
point so your child’s fingers touch it and she remembers where to
hold on.
• Put a pencil grip on the pencil.
• Push the pencil through a practice golf ball (the kind with lots of
holes).
• Put clay around the pencil.
• Have your child use long (not short) pencils (throw out the short
pencils).
 Have your bottom (yes your rear end, caboose, or tushie) to the back of
your chair.
 Put your feet flat on the floor.

Chapter 1: Thinking Like a Spelling Teacher
Finger Olympics
If you think that your child’s fine-motor skills can
use a workout (so your child holds and guides a
pencil better), try some of these finger Olympics.
Have your child:
 Turn a pencil over again and again, eraser
end up then lead end up, using only one
hand.
 Pick up small objects, like LEGO blocks,
using only one hand and keeping them in
that hand until it’s full. Then have your child
put the blocks back down, one at a time,
and still one-handed.
 Pick up small items, like dried beans or
pasta shells, with tweezers. For an easy
start use cotton balls.
 Draw around stencils and templates.
 Put some tape on the bottom line of the
page to help remember not to write on it.
 Use a finger or Popsicle stick to help
remember to leave spaces between words.
 Trace many shapes and objects. Make lam-
inated sheets by covering regular sheets 
of letters and words with transparent ad-
hesive book covering (which you can buy 
at stationary stores). Pick up some eras-
able whiteboard markers and a cloth to
complete the kit.
 Draw between lines (draw parallel lines 
like roads).
 Use dot-to-dot activity sheets.
 Warm up her hands before writing by shak-
ing them, clasping them together, and then
stretching her arms up and overturning her
hands, and by rubbing her palms together.

 Place your forearms on the writing surface.
 Slant your paper (to the left for right-handers, to the right for left-
handers). Tape the paper to the desk, if that helps.
 Use your helper (or opposite) hand to hold the paper down near to the
top of the sheet.
 Take 2-minute stretch breaks from writing every 20 to 30 minutes.
Keeping an eye on your child’s vision
If you’re worried about your child’s eyesight, have your child’s vision tested,
and don’t hesitate to get second and third opinions. You can keep a watchful
eye on your child’s vision (especially when other family members have vision
problems) by being aware of these indicators of possible vision problems:
 Your child tilts his head.
 Your child squints.
 Your child rubs his eyes, especially after looking at books.
 Your child complains of headaches.
 Your child feels dizzy pretty often.
 Your child seems to tire easily after reading.
 Your child holds books at an unusual angle or distance.
I’m neither a doctor nor an optometrist, so the information that I give you
here is just what parents have told me. It’s always good, though, to hear advice
from people who have overcome problems, so here’s what my sources say:

Part I: Understanding the Basics of Good Spelling 
Oh, my aching back
Does your child carry absurd amounts of who
knows what in his school backpack? If he does,
he can develop a lopsided posture or back and
shoulder pain, and that can make sitting down
and writing for long periods uncomfortable for
him. Here are a few things that your child can
do to keep his back and shoulders in good
shape:
 Get a backpack with wide, padded, adjust-
able shoulder straps.
 Wear the straps tightened.
 Always carry the pack over both shoulders.
 Regularly sort through the contents, and
take out the extraneous stuff.

 If your son seems to lag a little behind where your daughter was with
reading and writing at the same age, don’t jump to the conclusion that
his vision is impaired. Statistically, boys develop language skills later
than girls.
 Roughly gauge whether your child sees letters and symbols clearly by
having him play with activity books that include activities like spotting
the differences between shapes and letters and matching identical
shapes and letters.

Chapter 1: Thinking Like a Spelling Teacher
Making accommodations for your lefty
The world is pretty much made for right-
handers. So if your child is a southpaw, she 
may sometimes need some extra help. This list
offers a few pointers that can make your lefty’s
life more comfortable:
 Give your left-handed child room on her
right, um I mean, left (or strong) side. She
takes up more than the usual space be-
cause of the angle at which she writes. 
If an insensitive, brutish righty plunks down
to your child’s left, elbows bump, and the
jostling begins.
 If your lefty develops an awkward writing
posture, it’s probably to avoid smudging her
work or writing hand or so she can see
what she’s writing — or, more likely, both.
 Your lefty hates conference-style desks
with a right-handed rest. They’re nigh on
impossible for her to use.
 Your lefty may find that leaning on pads and
books makes writing easier than when she
writes on single sheets of paper and that
notebooks with the spiral on top make her
life much easier. And guess what, you can
get specialty notebooks with the spiral bind-
ing on the right but notebook holes on the
left — how cool is that?
 Your left-handed child probably isn’t too
fond of whiteboards. Using erasable mark-
ers makes it awfully easy for her writing
hand to erase what she’s just written.
(Tilting the board can help.)
 Make life easier for your lefty by getting her
left-handed writing tools. Ever seen a left-
handed rule? It has a zero on the right and
numbers running toward the left. Pens with
fast-drying ink (you have to experiment)
also are a good idea.
 Your lefty actually has an easy time with
keyboarding, because, just like you, she
does 50 percent of the typing with her left
hand. The number keypad on the right can
cause her problems, though, but you can
buy a special keyboard.
 The biggest problem your lefty may have
with computers is using a right-handed
mouse. You can either move the mouse to
her left (if no right-handers use the PC or it’s
set up for all household members to switch
back and forth) or buy her a left-handed
mouse. Your child may instead prefer to
simply get used to using the mouse right-
handed. Doing so is easier than making
changes and has benefits. With the rise in
popularity of video games, being able to use
your weak hand is a distinct advantage.

You can easily do your own regular minitests of your child’s vision. 
When you’re waiting for food at your favorite takeout restaurant, ask 
your child to read off a few items. If she’s slow or unable to respond, 
take a trip to the optometrist.
Listening for hints about 
your child’s hearing
Spotting whether your child has a hearing problem can be tricky, because all
kids shout and ignore their parents when it seems like a good idea to them. But
parents whose kids have hearing problems say to watch for these indicators:
 Your child has many ear infections.
 Your child shouts and talks excessively loud just about all the time.
 Your child doesn’t answer you, even when you’re saying good things.
 Your child quite often doesn’t hear words the right way.
Statistically, boys are more prone to ear infections than girls.
Moving in the direction 
of reading and writing
One of the best things that you can show your child when he starts jotting
down spellings is where to lead his pen. He needs to move from top to
bottom with individual letters and from left to right with his words and sen-
tences. Letter shapes go in all directions, but the starting point for printing
always is somewhere at the top. Up-to-down and left-to- right printing doesn’t
directly give your child great spelling skills, but indirectly it makes all the dif-
ference. If your child writes in a smooth flow, he has brainpower to spare to
figure out spellings. If he uses half of his brainpower trying to speed up and
improve his writing, it’s an unnecessary waste of good grey matter.

Jargon Busting
In this book, you come across a smattering of jargon. Most of it is stuff you’ve

Table 1-1
Familiar Terminology
Term
What It Means
apostrophe
This punctuation mark looks like a comma, but sits up 
high rather than down on the line. It’s used to show pos-
session like in “Sally’s book.” Your child can put it in con-
tractions like “It’s Tuesday,” but she mustn’t put it in 
phrases like “Yesterday was its birthday,” because this 
kind of “its” is what technically is called a possessive 
personal pronoun and it doesn’t require an apostrophe.
blends
St and str are blends. When two or three letters blend 
one into the next but each keep their own sound, that’s a 
blend.
comprehension
A fancy word for understanding.
consonants
Letters that aren’t vowels. The five vowels are a, e, i, o, 
and u. The rest of the letters in the alphabet are conso-
nants. Y sometimes functions as a vowel.
contractions
Words (like can’t and I’m) that are made by shortening 
other words (cannot and I am).
dictation
When you say or read text aloud for your child to write.
fine-motor skills
Small physical movements like writing and threading.
gross-motor skills
Big physical movements like kicking and jumping.
homonyms
Words (like sun and son) that sound the same.
learning styles
How each child learns things in a number of ways. A 
child has more than one kind of learning style, so teach-
ers must tap into all of them — seeing (visual), hearing 
(auditory), and doing (kinesthetic).

“there’s a bus in business.”
multisensory learning
Learning that uses as many of your senses as possible. 
Teachers often use it to describe the way they have kids 
look, say, and write.
nouns
Names of actual things (like man, pen, and book).
phonics
Showing your child how letters of the alphabet represent 
sounds.
plurals
More than one. Words like man, pen, and book are singu-
lar, while men, pens and books are plurals.
possessive apostrophe
When your child uses an apostrophe to show possession,
like in “Sharon’s dog” or “The man’s shoe.”
prefixes
A chunk of letters added to the beginning of a root word 
(a root word is a word all by itself). Chunks like un, dis, 
and pre are prefixes. Your child writes them in words like 
uneven, disappoint, and preconception.
proofreading
Looking over what you’ve written to check that it’s right.
proper nouns
Names of specific, not general, things. Words like man 
and book are nouns, but Mr. Brown and Huckleberry Finn 
are proper nouns.
root word
A word that can either stand alone or have prefixes and 
suffixes added onto it. Appoint is a root word, because it 
can become disappoint and appointed.
silent letters
Letters that your child writes even though he can’t hear 
them when he says the word. Silent letters are letters like
k in knee and gh in night.
soft letters
C and g have soft sounds in words like city and gem. The 
soft sound of c is “ss”, the soft sound of g is “j.”
suffixes
A chunk of letters added to the end of a root word (a root 
word is a word all by itself). Ed and ing are suffixes that 
your child uses often in words like spelled and spelling.
syllables
Sound/spelling chunks. The word sound has one syllable 
(you say it in one chunk) whereas spelling has two 
syllables.

I
wouldn’t know a spark plug from a sprocket. That’s okay, though, because
I drive a new car, and the nice dealership people fix stuff that goes wrong
with it — no questions asked. Last week, a red warning light lit up on my
dashboard. Guessing that maybe my spark plugs needed dusting or my
sprockets needed jiggling, I headed to the dealership. It turns out that that
cute warning light signifies that any of about 80 million things can be wrong.
As a result, my car had a sleepover at the dealership so the mechanics could
unravel the problem. When your child learns to spell, he won’t have to
unravel 80 million different options, but he will have to pull apart the sounds
inside of words and match letters to those sounds. To do it, he uses some
skills he already has from reading and writing. This chapter strips down the
parts that keep the whole spelling machine running and explains that, like
you do with your car, you need to keep the whole shebang properly serviced.
Why the Janitor’s Son Is a Genius
Comparing your family to other people’s families is normal. You sometimes
wonder, “Will the kid down the street do better in school than your child,
because in his life, money’s no object?” Will the little girl, new to the block
and the country, and under opposite circumstances, be disadvantaged? Will
your efforts with your child really make much difference? According to the
National Education Association (NEA), whether you’re a jillionaire or a janitor

doesn’t really matter. Whether you’re new to the country or you left school
early yourself doesn’t matter all that much either. The more important ques-
tion to answer is whether you encourage your child’s learning to improve her
chances of success in school.
Reading to Your Child
In this section, I extol the virtues of reading to your child. I tell you that read-
ing to your child makes him comfortable with the look and workings of text. I
tell you that when you read to your child you show him that you’re a partici-
pant in this whole literacy thing and not a do-it-because-I-say-so onlooker.
(And if you are reading, it must be fun, right?) I tell you that people who know
a bunch about this sort of thing (like the NEA) say that reading out loud to
your child is the single most important thing you can do to increase your
child’s chances of being a good reader. But reading isn’t spelling, is it? Nope,
but here’s the thing: When you read to your child a heap of spelling things
happen. Your child scans the words, makes mental images (without even
knowing he’s doing it), and ta-da, has a handy blueprint already in mind when
he jots down words for himself. The system, of course, isn’t foolproof, but
you can be sure of one thing. If you share plenty of text with your child, he’s
much more likely to notice spellings than if you don’t.
An Unequal and Sometimes Lumpy Mix
Your child learns to read, write, and spell in an unequal mix; moreover, she
learns to read quickest of all before getting better at writing, and finally learn-
ing to spell. The mix of learning these three skills can get lumpy. Your child
can be great at reading but weak at writing or spelling or both. You get no
guarantees, either. You can submerge her in stories and bury her under
books but still discover that spelling seems to throw her. The system can
unfair, but regardless of whether your child picks up spelling incidentally or
has to study practically every word she commits to paper, you can help. By
making sure that your child does plenty of reading, writing, and practicing
her spellings from this book, you can see her make marked progress.
Reading with Your Child
Just about everybody tells their children to read. Many people also read to
their children. Not many people, however, read with their children. It’s a pity,
because reading with your child is a cool thing to do. Here’s why:
32
Part I: Understanding the Basics of Good Spelling 

 Sending your child off to read alone can make her think of reading as 
a chore — a bit like making her bed. Reading with your child gives her a
distinct reading-is-so-good-that-I-do-it-too message that can mean the dif-
ference between your child remaining a reader, or not.
 Reading together bridges the gap between your child being a beginning
or reluctant reader and her becoming a fluent, all-by-herself reader.
 Reading together fills in the gaps in your child’s still-developing skills.
When she isn’t sure about a word, she can ask you for help right away,
which, of course, boosts not only her confidence but also her fluency
and comprehension. She keeps plot and meaning in her mind when she’s
fluent. Stop-start readers lose the sense of what they’re reading, because
keeping all that stuff in your head is hard when your concentration’s all
used up trying to figure out a bunch of hard words.
 Reading with a buddy is just plain fun. Snacks and a good range of books
(or magazines and comics) make things even better.
Increase your chances of turning your child into a reader by making sure that
he sees you (and other significant adults and peers) reading. The fancy term
for letting your child see you read is modeling, and even if you’re just skim-
ming through a few work journals in front of him, you’re being a model.

Chapter 2: Understanding the Reading, Writing, and Spelling Mix
Being Nuts About Nuts
On my bookshelf, I have a children’s book of
verse. When I’m feeling wistful about the days
when I could fit both my kids on my lap at the
same time, or just want to take my mind off their
campaign to share nothing, communicate in
yells, and never take turns, I pick it up. Here’s
how some of it goes:
I’m nuts about nuts
nuts are great
crack seven
crack eight
or
pack a packet in your luggage
pack a packet in your pocket
pack a packet in your rucksack
pack a packet in your rocket.
Ah. At one time, my kids loved that rhyme. I still
love it. Substitute “books” for the “nuts” part
(except for the very first one) and there, in a nut-
shell, is sound advice for helping your child soak
up spelling conventions without ever realizing
he’s doing it.
(Nuts About Nuts was written by Michael Rosen
and published by HarperCollins.)

Partners and practices
Now that I’ve extolled its virtues, you’re probably wondering exactly how you
go about reading with your child. Luckily, this question has been answered
by scores of teachers. The three kinds of reading with your child are
 Choral: You and your child read the same text out loud together at the
same time.
 Alternated: You and your child take turns reading text, usually a story,
out loud.
 Interrupted: You read text to your child, usually a story, and stop at an
exciting point in the plot. The hope is that your child becomes so
engrossed that he reads on.
Choral reading is a satisfying thing to do. Your child feels comfortable because
she can listen to you whenever she’s flummoxed by a word, and you get to
discretely listen in to how she’s doing. As you get better at staying in synch,
you can read a hair’s breadth behind your child so that she feels like she’s
taken the lead (which she actually has).
Taking turns reading with your child (alternated reading) is a great way to
nudge her toward reading more for herself. Read to her, of course, but make
deals. You read a page, and she reads a sentence. You read a chapter, and she
reads a page. Start as small as you need to, which may be very small, if your
child is reluctant. Read every night, and gently move your child from sen-
tences to paragraphs to pages.
34
Part I: Understanding the Basics of Good Spelling 
What’s a good book for my child?
A good book to read with your child is one that
doesn’t overwhelm him (or you). The perfect
book is just slightly taxing for him with well-
spaced and appropriately sized text and nice
pictures. Choose books that:
 Interest your child
 Have only a few words that are new and
hard for your child
 Have text that’s easy on the eye and nicely
spaced
 Have an all-round appealing look
If you worry that your child reads stuff that’s
below his grade level, relax. It’s better for him to
read a few easy books confidently, and want to
read more, than it is for him to labor over one
hard book and want to run a mile whenever you
suggest that he read another one.
You and your child can make selecting books
easier by focusing on series. You can get the
lowdown on popular book series by asking at
your child’s school library or at your local public
library. 

Make alternated reading easier for your child by reading text to him and then
having him read the same text back to you.
Interrupted reading is ever so slightly sneaky — Oh my gosh, I’m right out 
of time and can’t possibly read any more — but productive. You usually find
that as long as the story’s good, your child perseveres. When she reads on
for herself, she gains confidence and the nice feeling of being in control.
Listening to your child read to you
Listening to your child read to you is so valuable that you’ve already heard
all about it. You know that it’s important to listen — maybe for the 18th 
time — to his rendition of the classroom text. You know that your child
makes the best progress of all when he reads out loud to you every day. You
know that you have to maintain a you’re-doing-great tone and you’re even
cruising along with his reading log. However, the one thing that you’d like to
get all sewn up are his reading mistakes. Should you correct all of them or
just some of them? Should he sound out the words or can you tell him the
answers? If he walks off after being stuck for half an hour on ought, should
you track down his teacher’s home phone number? Good questions. In the
next section, I give you pointers that should keep you off the teacher’s black-
list of nuisance callers.
Correcting your child’s reading mistakes
When your child starts to read, your life takes on a new dimension. You pre-
pare breakfast while listening to her read. You drive to school while listening
to her read. Afternoon snack time is punctuated by you listening to her read.
Homework means listening to her read. She’s at your side reading as you load
the dishwasher, washing machine, and microwave. Supper is, of course, a
good time for her to read to you (between mouthfuls) and everyone knows
that bedtime reading is practically mandatory. With all that reading going on,
there’s a fair chance your child will make a few reading mistakes that cause
tears to fall, sometimes hers and other times yours. How can you tread lightly
on her ego? How will you make her feel like a winner when she makes a
bunch of mistakes? Does it really matter that you let her read a bunch of gob-
bledygook, because you’re too nervous to correct her errors? In this section,
I help you maintain a relatively normal household and make a few corrections
to her mistakes (unlikely as that sounds). There’s no yadda, yadda, yadda
either, just this handy list of practical tips:
35
Chapter 2: Understanding the Reading, Writing, and Spelling Mix

 You don’t need to correct all of your child’s reading mistakes. If she’s
reading a beginner’s, one-sentence-per-page kind of book, you can cor-
rect all of her mistakes, because errors probably send the meaning of
the text askew. However, with longer text, you can be flexible. If your
child makes a mistake that doesn’t interfere with meaning, and she’s
steaming ahead and enjoying herself, relax. Correct her only on words
that are critical for keeping the meaning intact and let minor errors slide.
An error to let slide may be, “He let her dog run,” instead of, “He let the
dog run.” Errors you’d want to correct are things like “He lost her dogs
rag,” instead of “He let the dog run.”
If you’re wondering why letting some errors slide is okay, you can end
up interfering with the flow of your child’s reading when you interrupt
all the time. He needs to keep the meaning of the text in mind as he reads,
because that’s what gives him clues about what’s coming next in the text.
Another thing about being more discerning with your interruptions is
that beginning readers need to keep a can-do attitude. The more you tell
him that he’s wrong, the less capable he feels, and the more you’re
pretty much caught in a Catch-22.
 Sometimes your child figures out words that she’s stuck on if you draw
her attention to the chunks of sound in the word. Sometimes she can’t.
Say, for example, that she comes across the word enough and has never
seen it before. Furthermore say that she hasn’t been through that partic-
ular incarnation of the “ou” spelling with you. She doesn’t have much
hope of figuring out “enough.” In that case, the sensible thing to do is to
flat out tell your child about the word “enough,” make a note of it, and
then let her move on with the story. You can always show her the back-
ground for words like enough, rough, and country later on. (To read more
about the sounds represented by ou, you can check out Chapter 11).
 You can help your child figure out some words by drawing his attention
to the gist of the text. If he reads ahead and looks at illustrations, he has
a better chance of figuring out unfamiliar words. That’s why teachers
often tell your child to read to the end of the paragraph or chapter, and
then, armed with this extra information, backtrack to the unknown word.
When your child reads around a word by looking at pictures and reading
ahead, she’s using contextual cues. She’s looking at the word in context
and searching for clues (or cues in teacher-talk) from that context.
 When you correct your child’s errors, be kind. Say things like, “That’s
not quite right,” or simply point to the offending words. If your child
can’t fathom the word after a few seconds, tell him what it is and con-
tinue on. You can always go back and focus on a few of the words your
child misread later on in what is known as word study. You can get the
most from word study by putting misread words into word families
whenever possible. A word family is a bunch of words that share a
spelling and sound pattern (like all, call, ball, and tall). I talk more about
word families in Chapter 10.
36
Part I: Understanding the Basics of Good Spelling 

A useful technique for helping your child correct errors is to say, “Can you
read that again? I missed something.” That way your child goes back with 
no worries of having made a mistake already and can get it right second time
around.
Writing to Your Child
Much as I adore my kids, I sometimes avoid them. Maybe they rolled into my
office, clenched in a half nelson just as I was on the phone explaining to an
editor how I have my parenting skills all sewn up. Maybe they drank the last
of the milk, so that I have to delay my caffeine buzz until I’ve manically raced
to the store. Or maybe I just heard them exchange one too many “Well, duh’s.”
Anyway, at times like that, I write them notes. I write things like, “I will check
your room in 15 minutes, please have all your clothes in the right places.” I
calm down. My kids read my note (in case anything good is in it, which some-
times there is) and best of all, clothes often find their way into laundry baskets.
I’m sure that I don’t have to persuade you that writing notes to your child is
an excellent thing to do, but you may find it handy to have a few getting-started
and keeping-going ideas up your sleeve. So here they are:
 Write thank-you notes.
 Write your schedule for today for your child.
 Write a note to let your child know what’s on today’s menu.
 Write to-do notes, which are especially handy when you’re heated up
and don’t trust yourself to ask for things in reasonable tones.
 Write reminders about things like feeding the cat or dog or putting extra
mittens in schoolbags.
 Write “I’m proud of you” notes.
 Write jokes and put them in lunchboxes.
37
Chapter 2: Understanding the Reading, Writing, and Spelling Mix
There’s no “hay” in “they”
When your child picks up a spelling list, he
doesn’t have to park his imagination.
Word study actually is fun. Have your child be
bold with highlighter pens, brazen with circles,
and brash with underlines. Have him draw stuff
in and around words or think up rhymes and
acronyms so he remembers them. I’ve seen kids
draw a worm (wearing a cap) from the eau part
of beautiful and tell me cool stuff like, “There’s
no hay in they.” I guess that imagination was
around long before spelling.

 Write “I love you” notes (of course!).
 Tell your child who called for her. (This suggestion works well with older
girls who can corner you for hours with questions about what tone was
used and whether you’re sure that that was all that was said.)
 Ask your child what he wants you to add to your shopping list.
 Write posters of rules or daily chores.
 Write checklists to keep daily routines running smoothly.
And, of course, after you get all of those notes written, feel free to go to work.
Writing with Your Child
No matter how many bags of stuff I take to donation bins, my house never
seems to stay tidy for more than an hour or two. I mount regular lets-get-
serious campaigns with my kids and have plenty of good ideas, but in real
terms, nothing much changes. One thing that comes out of my sporadic fren-
zies, though, is the occasional poster. The posters are well-intentioned lists
that I write with my kids. Only today my 9-year-old asked what she should 
do with our last poster. It read
Rules
1. No TV talk.
2. Keep your hands on your own body.
3. No answering back.
4. Clean up after yourself.
5. Have fun.
And although I follow the advice in parenting books and encourage my child
to phrase things in positive terms, my child had added a dire postscript:
Whoever breaks these rules WILL be PUNISHED (with a 10- to 30-minute
timeout).
Putting up posters
Kids love making posters of things like rules, friends’ telephone numbers and
to-do lists. You may want to get involved, though, because eager poster-makers
often use up several posters in about two minutes, haphazardly scribbling on
each one. Show him how to use a ruler and pencil to first sketch a rough draft
on paper. When he’s created one great poster idea, consider helping him with
38
Part I: Understanding the Basics of Good Spelling 

a poster of word families that he’d like to get to know (there where; were, her,
or would, could, should, for example). He can also make a “Tricky spellings”
poster and put words like who and because on it. When you’ve got a stack of
finished posters, have your child grab a clump of poster puttyand choose
prominent spots to display them.
Your school supplies store is a good source of inspiration for word-family
posters. Visiting one, you can get really groovy posters listing all kinds of
word types for less than five dollars each — a great investment.
Don’t go broke! Dollar stores have the best prices on poster board and often
drugstores put it on sale. Sides of boxes work well, too
Sharing a journal
Years ago one of my kids had to keep a shared journal with a parent as a
school project. She told me all sorts of things in the journal, and I could
hardly wait to read her entries. I was even able to point out a few spelling
errors to her without having to back nervously toward the door as I did it. I
kept that journal. It moves from one place to another every time I have that
tidy-house fantasy. The “Sharing a journal” activity up next explains the ins
and outs of sharing a journal with your child so you can start making your
own treasured memento.
Activity: Sharing a journal
Preparation: Buy your child a hardback notebook of his choosing and pick
up some nice pens.
Follow these steps:
1. Decide on a journal-writing schedule. Your child can write entries at
the end of a school week, on the weekend, or even daily.
2. Encourage your child to write whatever comes to mind, especially
things he may not have had time to tell you in person.
3. Encourage your child to include requests, such as what he’d like as a
reward for good grades, and to explain things he’s doing, such as
what he’s saving his money for.
4. When your child’s done writing an entry, write your response. Say
things that you may have been too busy to say sooner and fill your
entries with praise and encouragement.
Your child probably will start your shared journal with a burst of enthusiasm
and write entries every day only to find that daily writing becomes a burden.
Advise your child to write only one entry each week, and then if she wants,
decide upon a time for finishing up completely.
39
Chapter 2: Understanding the Reading, Writing, and Spelling Mix

Putting sass into stories
Your child may immediately take to writing stories. He may write reams of
disjointed, waffling text and present it to you proudly. Your job is to be inter-
ested. Take heart. He gets better and better with his stories, because the
more you encourage him, the more he does and the quicker he learns to trim
excess baggage. Letting spelling mistakes slide is the best course of action in
the early days. As your child’s stories grow more sophisticated (and hope-
fully, shorter), you can make the odd but tactful spelling suggestion. When
your child’s about ready to begin his autobiography, you can point out more
errors — maybe even all of them, but again, be sensitive. You can say things
like: “That word doesn’t look quite right,” or “You may want to read this sen-
tence again.” Or you can ask whether he’d like you to put a discreet pencil
mark under the words he may want to revise.
Little kids like to do close activities with favorite stories. A close activity is 
a piece of writing in which words have been deleted for your child to fill 
in. Making a close activity means getting one of your child’s favorite stories,
making a copy of it and blacking out key words. Key words that you black out
for him to fill in can be simple, frequent ones like they and was or harder ones
like followed or proud. An alternative to blacking out words is covering them
with sticky notes so your child can write the missing words on the sticky notes
before peeling them off to see if he was right.
If your child needs inspiration for story writing, go through a few typical story
lines with her (bullied girl finds a hidden talent that attracts friends; boy per-
severes with soccer skills and scores winning goal). Jot down promising words
too so she can use them if she wants to. Boys usually like active, task-based
stories (with words like throw, hurl, compete, champion, and proud) and girls
like to talk about friendships and personal experiences (with words like secret,
lie, loyal, kind, and alone). Animal stories — heroic dogs, talking horses, alien
cats — are popular with most kids.
40
Part I: Understanding the Basics of Good Spelling 
Internet message boards and chat rooms
Your child may know more about the Internet
than you do, and it’s a pretty safe bet that she
knows more than I do. So I don’t to go into much
detail about the whole message board and chat
room thing, except to remind you about it. Climb
aboard the message board/chat room jugger-
naut with your child, because even if she isn’t
yet on it, it’s going to happen. Peek at what she’s
writing but keep a nonjudgmental tone. Oh, and
be ever vigilant about online safety. Tell your
child never to give out her real name, address,
or phone number to strangers (even if they
become online friends) and to exit scary or yuk
stuff ASAP.

Giving a big hand to handwriting
Handwriting drills can feel like one big drag. Your child spends night after
night stretching the lines on t’s to the proper height and shaping o’s into per-
fect spheres. He often lets you know just how resentful he is, and you wonder
whether it’s at all worthwhile. Well, I don’t think that any child needs to labor
over the same ground when he’s already proficient, but smooth handwriting
helps your child spell. When your child writes fluidly, he doesn’t spend so
much time and effort forming his letters properly, and that leaves him with
more brainpower to commit to spelling. That’s why getting your child’s hand-
writing up to scratch is a commendable — if at times a tad dull — pursuit.
Having your child write to you
Oh my gosh. Who doesn’t love getting notes from their children? Some notes
make you cringe (“I’m sorry I was bad.”), some make your knees go wobbly
(“I love you and I always will.”), and some tell you things you might never
have found out otherwise (“I know my manners are bad, but I’m upset about
school.”). Encourage your child to write notes to you and for that matter to
anybody else. Here are some of the many good reasons for having your child
write notes:
 Your child can write notes to say things she can’t say in person like
“sorry” and “I love you.”
 Your child can leave you reminder notes like: “I get cookies in my lunch
on Fridays.”
 Your child can write notes when angry, explaining things that you may
not be aware of, such as “You only told me off, but Shaun laughed at me
and poked his tongue out while you were telling me off.”
 Your child can ask you for special things, giving reasons why she
deserves them or can be trusted. For example, “Ashley’s mom lets her
stay home alone as long as their neighbor is home and she calls her
every half hour. “
 Your child can write you weekly schedules of what she has to do and
what she’d like to do. For example: “Monday: Math homework. Can I play
with Ashley from 6 to 7 p.m.?”
Spelling with your child
Nothing is like having company to make a task go by quicker and easier. As
long as you aren’t stuck with your archenemy, and as long as you aren’t hung
up on being boss, company is great. When you buddy up with your child to
figure out spellings, you can achieve a great deal. You get stuff done in a
41
Chapter 2: Understanding the Reading, Writing, and Spelling Mix

warm, friendly way, and helping your child out is easier when he sees you as
a buddy and not an interference (heaven forbid). Here’s a sketch of how to
get cozy and cooperative with your speller:
Use an inquisitive manner when you spell with your child. You want to convey
the feeling that you’re two supersleuths figuring out how to spell in a partner-
ship. Your child knows that you’re not too bad of a speller, but he won’t care,
because he’s having fun with you. Here are some six steps for accomplishing
these goals:
1. Each of you grabs pen and paper or pen and whiteboard.
2. Try spelling out a word at the same time together, with each of you
writing the word on your own paper.
3. Compare each other’s results as you go.
Talk about what comes next.
4. Sound out chunks of spelling as you go.
Scribble possible spellings at the side of your paper for your child to see
and contribute to.
5. Soup things up by not showing each other your papers until you’re
both done and then comparing answers.
6. Make your child laugh or shift into extraobservant gear by jotting
down a few deliberate mistakes.
Getting the Most from Drills and Drafts
I’m the kind of person who likes routine. I’m agitated when I don’t get my
morning coffee at the same time every day, and buying a new brand of tooth-
paste can throw me into panic. Routines are good things, especially for neu-
rotics like me. Spelling has some routines that you definitely want your child
to get into. I’m not talking about elaborate stuff, like pointing your boots north-
westerly with the laces hanging to the left, but rather easy-to-remember, quick
practices. The practice that you hear most about in classrooms is “Look, Say,
and Write,” which gets stretched into the more descriptive “Looking, Saying,
Writing, and Checking” method.
Looking, saying, covering, 
writing, and checking
When handing out spelling lists, the teacher tells your child to: Look, Say,
Cover, Write, and Check his spellings. This formula means that good spellers
look carefully at a word and then say it to themselves. Then, without peeking
42
Part I: Understanding the Basics of Good Spelling 

at the word again, they write it down in the chunks they’re saying to them-
selves. The cover part of the formula reminds your child not to peek so 
that he develops the look-say-write habit. Good spellers develop this form 
of self-sufficiency without peeking at the word at the drop of a hat. The check
part of the formula reminds your child to check his spelling. When checking
the spelling, your child corrects it against the original word whenever neces-
sary, and remembers better than when you point out any errors. The whole
look-say-cover-write-check formula gets your child actively doing the spelling
for himself and is one of those great multisensory strategies that people rave
about. Your child uses his eyes, ears, mouth, and hands with this strategy,
and what’s more, if he doesn’t, it can set him back. If your child doesn’t 
look carefully at words, doesn’t say words in chunks, doesn’t jot down the
words, and doesn’t check what he’s actually written, he may not gain the 
confidence and skill that he needs to move forward with spelling.
If instead of using the look-say-cover-write-and-check formula your child tries
to learn things by rote, he learns them without any real understanding. Your
child thinks of the information as an isolated chunk of stuff that must be
drummed into his memory. The whole business is inefficient. Your child
learns things much better when he fits them into his own frame of reference,
like when he mentally files a word like fight with might, tight, and sight, to
create a word family. (I talk about word families in Chapters 10 and 11)
Doing dictation
Oh my gosh, here’s my favorite thing. I love dictation. If you regularly dictate
words for your child to write and spell, good things happen. She grows more
confident at spelling, makes fewer silly mistakes (like thay, I’me, and meny),
breaks words into chunks better (because she’s slowing down and really
thinking about each word), and starts habitually checking (or proofreading)
her own writing. These advantages are all great for a budding speller, so who
in their right mind wouldn’t try dictation every night for a few weeks?
What exactly is dictation? What are its pitfalls? What’s the no-fuss way to do
it? Dictation is reading text aloud and having your child write it down. The
factors that you need to consider when giving your child dictation are
 Choosing text that’s at your child’s level (which doesn’t necessarily
mean grade level). The right level is the level at which your child reads
comfortably. You want to give him words that make him really think but
not so many that he gives up. Having your child do several easy dicta-
tions is better than doing only one that’s too hard and switches him
right off spelling altogether.
 Giving your child just one or two sentences to start, especially when
he’s a slow writer. Build up to more dictation over a few days. Gauge 
the level of your child’s cooperation and make your dictations suit his
43
Chapter 2: Understanding the Reading, Writing, and Spelling Mix

mood, energy, and competence. Again, a few easier but successful dicta-
tions are better than one lengthy but coerced dictation.
If your child struggles with writing and does better on a keyboard you
may want him to type the dictation — with the spell-checker turned off!
 Reading the entire text first and then breaking it into bits.
 Speaking clearly and, if you think it’s helpful, exaggerating some pro-
nunciations and offering tips to remind your child of letter sequences.
Words like chocolate warrant this sort of help. Instead of the normal
“choclut” pronunciation, say, “Choclut is spelled choc-oh-late.”
 Helping your child with spelling patterns like tion and ought. You can
have your child jot them on a poster or whiteboard so he can refer back
to them whenever he needs to.
When your child does dictation and wants a perfect score, you need to 
lead him through proofreading and correcting.
You can do dictation in the car. It works especially well when your child 
has a lap desk.
Persevering with proofreading
Some of the things that you do with your child may raise big, fat question
marks in your mind. You pick up her clothes and wonder whether you’re
choosing your battles or raising a messy child, you remind her to do her
homework and wonder whether you’re prioritizing homework or raising a
lazy child, and you let her question you and wonder whether you’re raising
an analytical child or just a rude one. Thank heavens for proofreading.
Regardless of whether you nurture or nag your child to always proofread 
her writing, you can be certain that you’re doing the right thing.
When your child reads her own writing and spots mistakes, she probably can
correct the mistakes on her own (after all, she knows that the offending words
aren’t right). Encourage your child to have a go at jotting down spelling options
on scrap paper. With a word like option, she may try opsion, opcian and option.
If she spots the right word, that’s great, but if she doesn’t, well the more she
gets into the habit of jotting down options and scanning them for the one that
looks right, the better her accuracy becomes. If she can’t fathom the spelling
at all, write it down for her, point out the unique features (op-tion), and have
her write it out for herself a few times. Another way to proofread is to do it
together. Your child spots mistakes but you contribute. You say things like,
“Hmm, this word doesn’t look quite right,” and then give her time to correct
it if she can. One last option that older kids like is correcting the dictation
and then underlining any words with which they’re really having difficulties.
Your child then brings the underlined culprits to you, so you can dole out lib-
eral servings of your wisdom. Alternatively, you can reach for the dictionary
or computer spell-checker.

Take detours away from proofreading to show your child word families. A
word family for option includes words like action, fiction, and inspection. I 
talk about word families in Chapters 10 and 11.
Using memory joggers
Whenever I give talks about kids’ reading, a parent of a little child usually
asks, “Is it okay for my child to parrot a story without really reading it, even
though he thinks that he is really reading? Should I be making him sound out
the words?” The answer is that beginning readers use a few prereading skills.
Parrot reading is one of them, and it’s perfectly okay. In fact, it’s really useful
as long as it’s used as a steppingstone to real reading. When your child spells,
he uses many other steppingstones. Memory joggers, such as “There’s a bus
in business,” and “Friends never end,” are helpful steppingstones. You can
also encourage your child to use rhymes or any other kind of mnemonic that
helps him spell. After a few hundred uses, your child probably will drop
them, but even if he doesn’t, using them isn’t a problem. I still say “i before e
except after c” whenever I write receive, and I’d bet good money that plenty
of other closet mnemonic-users just like me are out there. If you’re bursting
with mnemonics of your own and want to check out my repertoire, skip over
to Chapter 11 and flit through the Cheat Sheet at the front of this book.

Poorfreading for Pros
I don’t go into much detail about style and gram-
mar in this book, but now and then I offer some
style suggestions that I think you’d like to know
about. If your child enjoys proofreading jokes,
and you want to run a few points about style
past her, check out this silly but sophisticated
list of do’s and don’ts. You may have to explain
things like double negatives and metaphors —
told you it was sophisticated.
 Check to see if you any words out.
 Don’t use no double negatives.
 The passive voice is to be avoided.
 Even if a mixed metaphor sings, it should be
derailed.
 Don’t use commas, that aren’t necessary.
 Its important to use apostrophe’s right.
 a sentence should begin with a capital and
end with a period
 In letters compositions reports and things
like that use commas to keep a string of
items apart.

Correcting Your Child’s Mistakes
Uh, oh! Here’s the part about eggshells. You know, those glaring mistakes that
you try to pirouette around whenever you see them in your child’s writing —
because you’re wary of pointing them out to her. Correcting her spelling mis-
takes can be a thankless business. She doesn’t want your input, hates you to
see even a missing comma in her compositions, and if you point out a miss-
ing letter, shrieks with the kind of outrage you’d expect if you’d just sold her
into forced child labor. Are there things you can do to ease the pain? You bet.
You can find heaps of help all through this book, and for starters, here are a
few tips to serve as an immediate analgesic:
 Use an “I think” or “maybe try this” kind of an attitude, and use those
phrases when helping your child, too.
 Ask your child whether she wants your help instead of just barging in 
on her show.
 Tell your child that you’re nearby, if she needs or wants a quick hand
now and then.
 Don’t be shy about saying things like, “Yeah, that word really used to
outfox me, too,” or, “Watch out for the “ough” spelling, it catches every-
body by surprise.”
 Ask your child to pencil in any words about which she’d like 
your advice.
 Let your child know that you think spelling can be a hard nut to crack
but that it’s worth getting right. Tell her the story of the rejected job
application. . . you know, the one where the kid, very much like her,
writes everything beautifully in her job application but (aargh) makes
spelling mistakes.
 Help your child find spelling chunks that match the sounds in her words.
Tell your child that in some words doing so is easy — like in dramatic,
but in others, like ought, she must rely more on her visual memory.
 Help your child cruise through word families (like all, call, ball, and fall)
any time she spells a word that belongs to a family. (Words in a family all
share a common spelling and sound pattern. I tell you more about word
families in Chapter 10.)
 Remind your child, again and again, to proofread.
Keeping Stress at Bay
I wish that I were calmer. I’d like to be one of those composed kind of 
parents — you know, the kind whose kids do what they’re asked and gladly
accept their advice. In the real world, I’m not blessed with vast reserves 
46
Part I: Understanding the Basics of Good Spelling 

of patience and my kids eye me warily much of the time. Neither of my kids 
is the tai chi or meditative type either. They haven’t picked up serenity, or
even forbearance, from any of their teachers, even though I’ve sent them to
school for years. So, in our shut-the-door-so-the-neighbors-don’t-hear-us-yelling
household, I frequently refer to books and lists that reintroduce me to that
concept of being calm. I’m sure that you don’t need more calm, but maybe
you know someone who does. Tell her to read this list:
 Make sure you and your child are fed and watered when you tackle
spellings. This idea sounds obvious right up until you hear your stomach
rumbling louder than your bad temper.
 Provide your child with needed solutions, not blame. If you tell him
that he should’ve listened better or practiced more in class, you create
bad feelings and won’t make headway.
The big thing to remember about having your child spell for you is that
he wants to succeed. If you ask him to spell from a cold start, you may
be setting him up for failure. Before asking him to spell single words or a
list of spellings from school, make sure you run though the words first
and help him break them into chunks and highlight tricky ones.
 Take breaks. Your child’s best attention comes in bursts of about 20
minutes. Of course, he won’t become fatigued after 20 minutes of absorb-
ing Nintendo play, but you can pretty much count on it happening in the
middle of spelling homework. It happens to you, too. Attention spans are
short things, so taking a cookie-and-milk break every now and then is
okay. In fact, it’s best to. When you get 20 minutes of willing effort from
your child, instead of a grueling hour of complaints, you’ll be glad you
listened to me — except that unlike me, you won’t, of course, have the
experience of wading through that bad hour for comparison, so actually
you’ll have no idea what I’m fussing about!
 Delegate. The things that I lead you through in this book are simple. 
If you can pin down your partner, mother, or an older child, and whiz
through the basics with them, do it. Anyone can make a difference to a
child’s spelling and now that you have this book to incite you, maybe
you can harangue a few people into helping you out.
 Help your child to spell words, one chunk at a time. Tell him that some
chunks like atch are easy, some like ight and ow are fairly easy, and some
like eigh take a little ingenuity. Not to worry, though, when he gets a few
spelling chunks under his hat, he can use them to spell masses of words.
 Look for words that are spelled similarly to other words (like should,
would, and could).
Some people swear that their short-term memories (STM) don’t handle any
more than two or three thoughts at a time, but in truth, your short-term
memory typically hangs onto five to ten bits of information. So if your child
tries to memorize random words by sight alone, she can’t store any more
than ten at most. It’s hard for her to remember random, unrelated words that
47
Chapter 2: Understanding the Reading, Writing, and Spelling Mix

don’t follow any pattern. Her brain isn’t fond of that kind of information. It
plunks it in her short-term memory and keeps it there only briefly. If, how-
ever, your child finds tricks for remembering those words, like spelling them
out in chunks and using mnemonics (memory joggers) like i before e except
after c, she remembers more and for longer periods of time. Words that are
drenched in meaning or patterns move into your child’s long-term memory
(LTM). So what I’m really saying is: Show your child how to spell in chunks
and use memory-jogging techniques, and have her focus on getting to know
ten words at a time really well before adding any more. Whenever you help
your child tackle new words, think LTM. (It’s official; STM is so yesterday.)
Make sure that your child knows what a word means before you ask him 
to spell it. Doing so is key to establishing it in his LTM.

W
hen I was a kid, I was impressed by a rhyme about a kingdom that fell
into ruin because of a nail. The rhyme starts out with a horseshoe.
The horseshoe is missing a nail, but no one goes to get one and therein
begins the demise of the entire kingdom. For the want of a nail, the shoe was
lost; for the want of a shoe, the horse was lost; for the want of a horse, the
rider was lost: and, well, I’m sure you get the picture. A battle ensues, the
kingdom falls, and the original lazy culprit no doubt feels pretty stupid. When
you teach your child the skills needed to be a good speller, don’t get caught
in the lurch like the person who wouldn’t go get a nail. Don’t skip the “looking
hard” part — that’s what this chapter is all about.
Listening First
What do you think the most important thing for you to teach your beginning
speller happens to be? The alphabet? The looks of key words? Phonics, maybe?
No. Well, actually, yes and no. All of these things are really handy for begin-
ning spellers, but the first thing that your child needs is phonemic awareness.
I’m beginning to sound technical, right? Phonemic awareness does have a
scary sort of a ring to it, I confess, but I’m not going to give it a technical-stuff
icon, because honestly the term phonemic awareness has so much more bark
than bite.

Phonemic awareness is probably the hottest phrase among teachers of read-
ing, writing, and spelling these days. It gives plain old phonics quite a hefty
boot — meaning you no longer hear many teachers talking about phonics.
They say “phonemic awareness” and leave ordinary, unsuspecting parents
baffled the way you are at this point.
So what on earth are they going on about and how come they think regular
people have heard of it? Don’t worry, teachers often get caught up in their
own jargon simply because it’s so familiar to them. They forget to clue the
rest of us in. After all, parent/teacher conferences are already jam-packed
with other information, but that’s okay, because I give you the lowdown right
here: Phonemic awareness is what your child has when he hears that words
are made of chunks of sound and realizes that those same chunks also pop
up inside of other words. If your child has phonemic awareness, he can hear
the “at” in cat, mat, hat, and fat, or the “buh” at the beginning of boat, brick
brother, and ball. He’s able to finish off the rhyme, “Roses are red, violets are
blue, sugar is sweet, and so are ---.” Phonemic awareness is all about hearing
patterns in words. It’s a hot-button topic in school, and you want your child
to latch onto it!
The key to remember about phonemic awareness is that it follows a horse-and-
cart sort of principle. You want your child to get the hang of sounds before he
starts trying to jot them down on paper, just like you’d put your horse before
your cart or risk an unorthodox, not to mention slow and difficult journey.
What’s the difference between the old phonics and the newer phonemic
awareness? Not much. But never say that to any ferociously adamant devotee
of phonemic awareness, or you’re in for a long-winded explanation. Phonemic
awareness reminds teachers that kids need to understand all about sound
chunks before they begin matching letters to them. Phonics, some say, didn’t
stress sounding out chunks like that. Instead, the theory goes, phonics left the
door open for teachers to just teach kids that “a is for apple” and “b is for bel-
ligerent,” oops I mean “ball.” Phonemic awareness is a really useful term, but 
I seriously doubt that teachers didn’t already know the phonemic awareness

No room for seven
A friend of mine has a son who used to recite
the numbers from one to ten like this: “One, two,
three, four, five, six, eight, nine, ten.” Puzzled,
my friend told him that he’d forgotten seven.
“No,” the son replied, “I don’t like seven.” My
friend still doesn’t know why seven fell from
grace with her son, but she thinks that it has
something to do with the fact that all the other
numbers up to ten are pronounced with only
one syllable. Her son may have decided that the
word “seven,” with its two syllables, just didn’t
sound the same as or even fit in with the other
numbers. With such an attentive ear for word
patterns, chances are that when this little guy
starts school, he’ll breeze happily through his
spelling lists.

stuff before the actual term was invented. Good teachers always have taught
kids all about chunks of sound and moving them around to make new words,
but now everyone has phonemic awareness as a reminder. Whatever you do,
don’t get caught saying “phonics” to the phonemic-awareness watchdogs.
Listening for Chunks of Sound
The kinds of chunks of sound that you want your child to be able to distin-
guish in words are single-letter sounds, blends, digraphs, and rhymes. Table
3-1 gives you an at-a-glance account of what these terms mean and where to
start rustling up a few sounds for your child to tune in to.
Table 3-1
Getting Your Child Used to Sound/Spellings
Sound/Spelling 
Practicing It
Pattern 
single letters
Start your child in spelling by having her write down the first
letter she hears in the words that you say to her. When she
writes t in response to you saying top, b when you say big,
and so on, she’s getting the hang of beginning single-letter
sounds. From there, move her onto ending sounds, and then
finish single-letter spelling by having her jot down short-
vowel middle sounds like the a in cat and the e in hen.
blends
When your child can jot down single letters (first, last, and
middle short vowels), introduce her to blends. Start with
blends at the beginnings of words, like st in step and br in
brown. Read words to her until she’s comfortable with jot-
ting down blends that she hears at the beginning, and then
move her to blends at the end. Read words like ring and
held until she’s jotting down blends like ng and ld almost as
fast as you read them out loud to her.
long vowels
Long vowels are where your child really has to tune in. The
next spellings to show your child are long-vowel spellings.
The first step in mastering long vowels is hearing them. To
spell words like pain and tale, your child must first hear that
ay is different than the a in apple. After that, she can put her
energies into figuring out exactly how to spell long-vowel
sounds because a few different options can be used. At this
point, your job is to give your child plenty of practice spelling
word families like pain, rain, and mail, pale, whale, and stale,
so that she navigates her way through all the spellings of all
the long vowels.
51
Chapter 3: Getting to Know the Pieces and Parts of Spelling

Table 3-1 (continued)
Sound/Spelling 
Practicing It
Pattern 
digraphs
Sooner than you think, your child will come across words
like loud and boil and will see a brand-new kind of spelling
that sits in the middle of words like these — a two-letter
cluster called a digraph. Digraphs result in unexpected
kinds of spellings (why loud and not lawd?), but luckily
digraphs are all around the spelling world, so your child will
encounter plenty of words (like proud, cloud, out, and
shout) to practice. Your job, as usual, is to show her heaps
of ous, ois, and other digraphs.
rhymes
You probably never thought of rhyming as being much more
than a fun thing to do with your child, but rhyming is one of
the more valuable spelling strategies that you teach her.
Rhyming helps your child group words together like lean,
clean, and mean. Groups of similar-sounding (and looking)
words are known as word families (in this case, the ea
family). Word families help your child spell whole bunches of
words. When spelling a word like misdeed, for example, she
can refer to the word families she already has filed away in
her brain (miss and mistake/need, feed, and greed). Even
tricky words like subconscious and numb usually fit into
word families (conscious, delicious, and suspicious/thumb,
comb, and bomb), so you can see how rhyming and making
word families can help your child more than any other
spelling strategy.
Playing with Pronunciation
Any spelling teachers who are worth their salt understand that your child
needs to have a few spelling strategies up his sleeve. Your child has to be
able to hear the chunks in words, jot them down (not be afraid to make
guesses), and check what he’s written. When your child is learning a spelling
list, he must group words into families whenever he can, look for familiar
spelling chunks (like ai or ay), and highlight tricky new spelling patterns (like
the eigh in neighbor). He must jot down his spellings a few times and proof-
read them to see whether they look right. Sometimes he can even overpro-
nounce his spelling, because some words seem to be crying out for a little
phonetic pronunciation.
52
Part I: Understanding the Basics of Good Spelling 

A word like Wednesday is ideally suited to phonetic pronunciation. Your child
says, “Wed-nes-day,” and can spell it. Is overpronunciation a wise thing to do
though? Yes, of course. If overpronunciation helps your child spell certain
words then it’s a useful strategy for her. Researchers say that attention to
detail is a handy trait for your child to have when it comes to spelling, and
they add, phonetic pronunciation of tricky letters is a great way for your
child to fix them in her mind. Relax. Your finicky, strange-talking child may 
be a finely tuned spelling machine in the making.
Looking at Letters
Looking at letters is pretty much the theme for this entire book. Your child
needs to look at letters so that he develops a good eye for telling whether
he’s reproducing the spellings accurately. What kinds of factors help your
child develop a good eye for looking at letters?
53
Chapter 3: Getting to Know the Pieces and Parts of Spelling
Subtle sounds
If you’re not totally convinced that tweaking or
exaggerating the pronunciation of some words
helps your child to spell them, take a look at the
pairs of words in the list that follows. Your child
needs to say each word clearly to himself to get
exactly the right spelling. Even after trying that,
the spelling still can be difficult.
accept and except
affect and effect
advise and advice
belief and believe
choose and chose
diary and dairy
desert and dessert
loose and lose
purpose and porpoise
sense and since
through and thorough
thought and though
quiet and quite
once and ounce
trail and trial
And while I’m on the whole business of your
child overpronouncing or phonetically pro-
nouncing words, consider the words different
and separate. When exaggerating the pronunci-
ations of words like these (“dif-fer-ent” and “se-
par-ate”), your child avoids the spelling pitfall of
leaving out bits and pieces of words. By contrast,
when your child pronounces the words the way
people normally say them, she can be forgiven
for writing diffrunt and seprut.)

Words within words
In this book, you hear plenty about spelling chunks, but here’s another factor
on which you need to have your child focus. Many words contain other smaller
words inside, so when your child spots them, it becomes another feature that
helps him recall the sequence of letters in the word. Sometimes words within
words practically jump out at your child, like in sometimes, but in others, find-
ing the words within isn’t as easy. In the word other, for example, your child can
find the and her, and in feature, he finds eat and at. Those little words may not
always be pronounced as distinct words when they’re inside of a bigger word,
but your child can have fun spotting them all the same.
Activity: Finding three little words
Preparation: Make a copy of the word list that follows.
Follow these steps:
1. Read each word in the list out loud to your child.
2. Have your child find three smaller words inside each word on the list.
The words must already be in the word and may not be rearrangements

Mistakes
Many people say that you learn best when you make mistakes along the way.
When your child learns to spell, he inevitably makes mistakes. Mistakes are a
big part of learning to spell, so encouraging your child always to have a try is
important. If you don’t, these nasty things happen:
 Your child won’t have confidence in himself.
 Your child will limit his writing to only those words he can spell and
thereby gets limited practice on harder spellings and vocabulary.
 You child won’t get to try out and polish up the spelling strategies
you’re showing him.
So now you can see that mistakes are an important part of your child’s nat-
ural development and nothing is wrong with making plenty of them in the
early days. You don’t need to correct your child’s early mistakes at all, and
when you do start pointing out errant capital letters and spellings like thay
rather than they, do it selectively and with sensitivity. Point out only the
errors that you think your child understands and can benefit from seeing. As
your child grows more capable, you can point out more mistakes.
By judiciously correcting your child’s spelling mistakes in the early days, 
you help her gain the confidence to write a lot. When your child reaches the
stage where she’s writing plenty of sentences, correct just enough of her
spelling errors for her to remember them but not feel overloaded. (And after
you’ve achieved this fine balance, award yourself top marks for impeccable
judgment.)
55
Chapter 3: Getting to Know the Pieces and Parts of Spelling

Your child didn’t learn to walk without ever falling down and the same goes
when he’s learning to spell. If you try to make his early writing perfect, he
may end up thinking of writing as drudgery that’s doomed to fail. Focus on
and praise his efforts and ideas. Restrict yourself to one or two spelling sug-
gestions. You need to see steady progress in the amount of words that your
child spells correctly so that by about grade two he can write pretty tidy text.
If it seems that your child’s progress has come to a halt or he’s lagging far
behind his classmates, see his teacher right away. Draw up a plan of exactly
what you’ll do in practical terms that can be measured.
When beginning spellers write sentences like “I lik gwing tow the mwll,” teach-
ers call it emergent writing with invented spellings inside. Emergent writing
and invented spellings are good things, and you need to encourage your child
to do as much of them as she reasonably can. In time, she improves by getting
better at remembering letter sequences, and she makes fewer mistakes. This
abundant warming up at a tender age stands her in great stead for her later
epics.

Confessions in the night
When I went into my child’s bedroom to tuck her
in a few nights ago, she had a furrowed brow
and a guilty conscience. “Mom,” she said, “I did
something pretty bad in school today. I wrote
this really good story in my very neatest joined-
up writing, but the teacher put her red pen on it
in three places. She found these three really,
really small mistakes, and put her red pen on
them. If she’d used a pencil, I could’ve erased
the marks and kept the story. I just couldn’t bear
to look at my spoiled sheet. Mom, I wanted it to
be perfect, and I was so mad at the teacher that
I threw the whole story in the garbage.”
I talked the whole diabolical thing through with
my daughter and then headed to my desk to
move my two red pens out of temptation’s way
and sharpen a few pencils.

Having a Few Tries
When I grew up in England, a very common expression was, “Have a go.” If
ever spectators were urging you to “wallop” a soccer ball or belt out a song on
stage they’d say, “Go on love, have a go!” I still use that expression — even
though my kids give me odd looks — and I want to encourage you to give your
child the same message in whatever terms you like. Encourage your child to
always “have a go,” because when she jots down loose approximations of real
spellings, it gives her a frame of reference to look at and tweak several times
until she arrives at her best shot. Then she can ask you for advice or consult a
dictionary, and that’s okay. Having tried a few times before, she asks for your
help, establishes good habits, and refines that good eye for spelling.
If you read other books about spelling, you may come across the terms homo-
phone and homograph. Homo means same, and phone means sound, so homo-
phone means sounds the same. Words like sun and son are homophones. Graph
means picture or visual representation, so homograph means looks the same.
Words like grave in a cemetery and the grave as in very serious are homographs.
Check out Table 3-2 for more about these and more word-related terms.
Table 3-2
Defining Word-Related Terms
Term
What It Means
homonym
A general term for words that are the same in sound but not spelling
(like son and sun), or the same in spelling but not sound (like bow in
your hair and bow of a ship), or the same in both spelling and sound
(like grave in a cemetery and grave as in serious).
homograph
Words that are spelled the same, like bow in your hair and bow to
the king. Homographs are a subset of the bigger, general group
called homonyms.
homophone
Words that sound the same, like you are nice and the farmer has
a ewe (sheep). Homophones are a subset of the bigger, general
group called homonyms.
antonym
Opposite words in meaning, like big and little.
synonyms
Same words in meaning, like little and small.
Tables 3-3 and 3-4 up next have some tricky words in them. Don’t be scared.
This book doesn’t keep getting harder and harder. In fact, you come to some
easier bunches of words in Chapters 4, 5, and 6, but it just so happens that
many homonyms and homographs are fairly sophisticated words. Remember
that you can skip from one part of this book to another whenever you want.
You can file these words under “things to do” and come back to them after
your child practices spelling words that don’t look quite so serious.

Chapter 3: Getting to Know the Pieces and Parts of Spelling

The words in Table 3-3 are not for the fainthearted, but if you want to crank
up the gears and show your child a few words to test both his spelling and
vocabulary, this is the table to use. All the words in it are homographs —
words that have two distinctly different meanings but nevertheless are
spelled the same.

In case you’re wondering about the dual meaning of some of these words,
here are a few definitions:
 Desert: Either those dry arid places you wouldn’t want to be lost in or
how you can leave or desert a place.
 Grave: Either the kind in a cemetery or the very serious or grave
situation.
 Gross: Either large or yuk or the old-fashioned measure.
 Nail: Either you have one on your finger or you nail down a job.
 Patient: You can be this either when you’re teaching your child to spell
or when you’re confined in a hospital.
Homophones are words that sound the same but usually are spelled differ-
ently and mean different things. Table 3-4 provides quite a few to keep you
going.

Anytime I say “homograph” or “homophone,” I can equally well say “homonym”
instead, because homonym is the general term that incorporates both.

Dictation: Doing It and Doing It Again
Giving your child dictation is a great thing to do, especially when you want 
to iron out those little mistakes like untill, thay, and I’me. Get into the routine
of giving your child weekly dictation, and you give her a time when she can
check her writing for those kinds of mistakes. Keep a cheerful, positive tone,
though, so that your great idea doesn’t turn into a great big drag. Using a
points system can cheer up proceedings, and you don’t have to think up a
59
Chapter 3: Getting to Know the Pieces and Parts of Spelling

bunch of whiz-bang rewards. Instead, try awarding your child three free
points that allow her to make three errors in a paragraph, but if she makes
more than three errors, she must work on another sentence or paragraph.
Activity: Marathon spelling contest
If your child brings spelling lists home every week, you probably find that by
about week four, the novelty wears pretty thin. Try making a spelling chart
that gets harder as your child gets better at spelling and includes all your
kids’ scores (if you have more than one child), so you can extend a spelling
routine’s natural life span.
Preparation: Gather together award certificates, stickers, a bulletin board,
individual photos of your children, and a trophy. You’ll also need several lists
of spelling word equal to the number of weeks you want the contest to con-
tinue, paper, and pens. This activity can last a few weeks to an entire school
year.
Follow these steps:
1. Draw a “Spelling Champion” board.
2. Plan a routine by which the name of the weekly champion gets posted
on the same day every week.
Whoever scores 100 percent has his or her photo posted in the cham-
pion’s spot and receives formal applause from significant family mem-
bers and other participants. For this activity to work, you need to act
duly ceremonious and enlist Dad to shake hands or hug the champion
and siblings to high five her.
3. Read the spelling words for the week out loud to the participants.
4. Determine the scores for the week and who the weekly champion is.
5. Award stickers and prepare to award a grand prize during the next
school break to the child with the most stickers.
6. After winter break, make the contest harder.
Now the spelling champion must score a 100 percent on spelling tests
for two weeks in a row. Every two weeks, the Spelling Champion is hon-
ored for her achievement.
After spring break, increase the difficulty again by determining the
champion via a 100 percent rating for three-week intervals!
7. When the school year ends, you may want to award your grand cham-
pion a trophy or mark his or her effort in some other extraspecial way.

Part I: Understanding the Basics of Good Spelling 

Spelling is a family issue. Your child needs to see you doing all the things that
you tell him to do. If you really plan to help your child, you have to walk the
talk.
Having a Few Spelling 
Rules under Her Belt
Some people dislike spelling rules. I can’t say that I blame them, because they
probably have bad memories of tedious spelling lessons in which they were
drilled in dozens of complex and often convoluted spelling rules. Well, I’m not
about to burden you with a whole heap of rules that have you yearning for a
nap or a call from the telemarketers. However, I am about to tell you about a
handful of the more effective spelling rules.
When your child spells make, he can use the Bossy-e rule to help him do it.
When he spells main, he can think about the when-two-vowels-go-walking-the-
first-one-does-the-talking rule. When he gets on top of those two simple rules,
he adds hundreds of words to his spelling repertoire (like make, take, came,
same, like, life, and pain, rail, nail, trail, sail, and main) and sees that he’s
really moving into superleague spelling. In this book, I walk you and your
child through these two simple, nonthreatening rules and throw in just a
couple more equally nice ones so that your child puts together a simple but
reliable arsenal.
Throw together a five-minute spelling contest by setting up a white board or
poster and having players run to it to write down spellings. Only one player
is the runner, while the others have to figure out the spelling and jot it onto a
slip of paper for the runner. Give teams lists of misspelled words (or ask them
to write homonyms from Table 3-3) and a time limit. 
61
Chapter 3: Getting to Know the Pieces and Parts of Spelling
Remembering to read
If you regularly sit down with your child and look
at spellings, give yourself a great big pat on the
back, and then take a break and put a few books
in front of your child. When you read often and
extensively to your child, or have your child read
on her own, you do as much for her spelling as
you do with your advice and guidance. Every
time that your child looks at written text, she
sees not only individual spellings but also
spelling patterns — typical arrangements and
strings of letters, abundant vowels, and things
like apostrophes and hyphens. Keep your child
reading by taking her to the library, surrounding
her with cool-looking books, and showing her
that you’re a reader, too.

Being Secure with Sight Words
Sight words comprise most of what your child spells. They’re words like they
and were, and your child writes them all the time. Naturally, you want your
child to spell these words with ease. Have your child read and write all the
time (within humane limits), show her spelling patterns, and take her through
the sight-word list in Chapter 12 so you can isolate the words that she hasn’t
yet mastered.
Skimming through Suffixes, Silent
Letters, and Other Stuff
If spelling were a fancy meal, you’d start your child off with sight words. Sight
words would be the perfect appetizer, because your child needs only a small
serving. She probably knows how to spell most sight words already, so you
62
Part I: Understanding the Basics of Good Spelling 
Putting the social into spelling
Because your child is a social creature, just like
everyone else, she likes to do things in company.
Any time you can recruit friends or family into
spelling activities with your child, do it. In case
you’re thinking to yourself right now, “Oh yeah,
right, just like that, huh?” here are a few practi-
cal pointers to set you on your way:
 Ask other people (or older kids, grandpar-
ents, aunts, and uncles) to give your child a
quick dictation. Spice it up by having your
child try to beat the clock. He can get help but
only with yes/no answers to his questions.
 Get interested others to brainstorm with
your child. They can think of Bossy-e words,
or er words, or any other spelling pattern.
 Ask computer-savvy relatives to download
dual copies of word searches for your child
and encourage them to do them together.
 Suggest that long-distance relatives become
your child’s pen pals.
 Suggest that grandparents give your child
the occasional quick lists of ten misspelled
words.
 Have friends ask your child to correct their
misspellings.
 Play team games. Team leaders have ques-
tion sheets to read to their teams. Teams
must answer the questions but can get only
yes/no answers to their questions from their
leader. Write ten questions and see whether
teams can answer them in less than ten min-
utes. (To see more about group activities, flip
to Chapter 20.)
 Remind friends and relatives about favor-
ite old games like Hangman and Scrabble
(Junior version).

serve her only the words that she needs more practice with. For her main
course, you’d dish up some listening-for-chunks-in-words, some jotting-down-
of-those-chunks, and some proofreading so she can see whether those writ-
ten chunks look right. You’d also drizzle some word families onto the chunks
so your child comes to grips with common letter patterns and clusters. For
dessert you’d serve up three or four spelling rules and then finish up with
the equivalent of those small chocolaty or minty things that come with your
coffee. Your child’s chocolaty and minty things in spelling are suffixes, pre-
fixes, silent letters, and soft c’s and soft g’s. She needs to be comfortable with
them, but they’re not on the main menu. You get a calorie and fiber count on
all this nibbly stuff in Chapters 13 (silent letters), 14 (soft-sounding letters),
15 (prefixes), and 16 (suffixes), but for now, the sections that follow provide
a quick preview.
Suffixes
When your child can spell run, you want him to spell running. That’s where
suffixes come in. Suffixes are the endings that your child tags onto words to
make them more impressive. Common suffixes are ed, ing, er, and est, but
your child needs to follow some putting-together instructions before affixing
some of them. Do you remember the drop-the-e-when-you-add-ing (pro-
nounced “eye-en-gee”) rule? No? Well, you can find out more about it in
Chapter 16.
Prefixes
If your child ever tells you about his prespelling tests at school, he’s already
learning about prefixes. Prefixes are little bits of words like pre (meaning at
the front of). Your child puts them at the beginnings of words to make new
words with new meanings. Common prefixes are bi, hyper, mono, and dis, 
and I tell you much more about them in Chapter 15.
Silent letters
Know anything about plumbing? Well, if you don’t (and I’m taking the liberty
of assuming that you don’t), you won’t know any more by the time you finish
this book. But you will know more about silent letters (like the silent b in
plumbing) and so will your child. More silent letters exist than you probably
thought, so in Chapter 13 I bustle you through a whole plague of them.
63
Chapter 3: Getting to Know the Pieces and Parts of Spelling

Soft c’s and soft g’s
The scent that you sent wasn’t worth a cent. Now there’s a few soft c’s, silent
c’s and absent c’s for you! Your child needs to write soft c’s and soft g’s every
once in a while, but probably not as often as she thinks. The softies are fun
for your child to get to know, but you have to be around to make sure that
things don’t get out of hand. Interpretation: Your child will be tempted to slap
soft letters in all sorts of unlikely words, so you have to help her exercise a
measure of restraint. Sure, she can try words like cent and gem, but steer her
clear of bad mixes like cet and gello. In Chapter 14, I help you turn your child
into a responsible and occasional soft-letter user.

Getting Easy
Words onto Paper

In this part . . . 
A
lmost every word contains a vowel, so helping your
child get to know them well makes pretty good sense.
This part of the book introduces you and your child to
short vowels. It shows you blended letters, like st and ng,
too, so that your child can tag them onto short-vowel
words like and and end up with words like standing. It gives
you a tour of consonant digraphs ch, sh, th, ph, and wh, so
that words like chatting, dashing, and whisking come easily
to your child.

“R
umplestiltskin” is a fairy story about a princess who guesses the
name of her captor (Rumplestiltskin) to win her freedom. The 
story culminates with the princess declaring emphatically, “Your name’s
Rumplestiltskin.” Now had that princess smugly declared, “Your name’s
Rumplestinkskin,” she’d have been in big trouble. Hearing, pronouncing, and
ordering sounds were important for the princess, and they’re important for
your child. Your child can spell the short vowels that I tell you about in this
chapter only if he hears, says, and orders them accurately. In this chapter, I
explain how to verify that your child does all those things. I have you move
him from saying to writing, because that’s the path that good spellers follow.
I show you a few common or sight words made from short vowels. Lastly, I
give you long words made from short vowels strung together so that your
child gets a kick from power spelling.
When I say that your child must pronounce short vowels accurately, you don’t
have to worry about whether he rolls his r’s or says the occasional “th” rather
than “s.” You don’t have to worry about accents, either. As long as your child
says a consistent form of each short-vowel sound to himself, he’s doing fine.
Whether he pronounces words in his own unique way or speaks in the queen’s
English won’t matter. Speech therapists can help you whenever your child mis-
pronounces words in a big way or over a long time, but slight deviations from
the typical way most people speak don’t cause problems. If they did, the many
accents that people have would cause mayhem, and second-language kids
would have a hard time learning to use English in school. In fact, kids who use
English as their second language right from an early age use it as competently
(or as poorly) as they use their first language.

Checking on Single Sounds
Because only 26 letters are in the alphabet but hundreds of sounds are in the
English language, it stands to reason that you need to let your child know
how those 26 letters work and combine together to make loads of sounds.
Here are a few hints:
 Most single letters make (or represent) one sound (m, b, and d, for
example).
 Each of the five vowels makes (at least) a short sound and a long sound.
 A few consonants make more than one sound (c and g, for example).
 Certain clusters of letters (like ight, ou, and ar) make unique new
sounds.
 Sometimes you write letters in a word and they make no sound at all
(knee and came, included).
These five points give you a rough sketch of how spelling works, and I dis-
cuss them in much greater detail throughout this book. For now, however, I
home in on regular, single-letter sounds and the short-vowel sounds.
Tackling Letters in the Right Order
The order in which you and your child tackle letters is important. When your
child’s an absolute beginner, you need to show her the easiest letters first, the
ones like m that never change sound. As she starts to string letters together to
spell words, you need to make sure that she jots down the letters in the right
order. When she writes longer words you have to keep her moving from one
sound chunk (or syllable) to the next. I talk about chunks of sounds in the sec-
tion about “Spelling in Chunks” later in this chapter (and all through this book),
but to start with, I talk about single letters. I tell you which letters are the best
ones for absolute beginners to start off with, which consonants do a few things
that your child needs to know about, and why vowels are the most important
letters of all.
Beginning Simply
When starting out with spelling, you first need to introduce your child to
single letters with hard sounds and vowels with short sounds. A hard sound
is the regular, most typical sound that letters make. Short-vowel sounds are
what your child hears in words like mat, pet, ink, hop, and cut. When your
child says short-vowel sounds, they actually sound short when compared
68
Part II: Getting Easy Words onto Paper 

with the long sounds that vowels make in words like mate, Pete, idea, open,
and unicorn. The other single-letter thing to tell your child about is how a few
consonants do some pretty quirky stuff.
With a letter like c, which makes more than one sound, the “cuh” sound, or
hard-c sound, is the one to start with as opposed to the soft, or “ss,” sound
that c makes when you pop an e, i, or y after it (like in ceiling, city, and cycle.
Being Clear about “kuh”
C does quirky stuff. It makes the “kuh” sound even though k does too. Both
letters are used in plenty of words. How will your child know when to use one
rather than the other? Well, I have some suggestions. In fact, they’re more like
set-in-stone rules, which is nice, because you don’t find too many of those in
spelling. Here are ten absolute, always, not open for discussion, never any dif-
ferent, solid rules to tell your child, about using c or k:
 Rule 1: Always ct, never kt. Many words end with ct, and many words
have ct in the middle. Dictate some words from Table 4-1 for your child
to spell and ask him what letters appear in each one. Ask him whether
he can ever write kt. If you feel inspired, jot down some ct words from
the table but put kt, rather than ct, in them. Have your child sort the
words into right and wrong spelling groups.
Table 4-1
ct Words

collect
compact
direct
duct

 Rule 2: ic (not ik) at the end of big words of more than one syllable.
Horrific, now there’s a nice word. Show your child the rich, generous
words in Table 4-2 and explain that alternatives to good and dumb do
exist. Then you may want to try the misspelling routine that I just men-
tioned for Rule 1.

 Rule 3: Write ke and ki to keep the “kuh” sound (not ce or ci). You can
read the details about soft sounds in Chapter 14. For a quick start, here’s
the scoop: When your child writes ce or ci, she makes the soft-c, or “ss,”
sound like in ceiling or city. So if she wants to spell a word like kettle or
kite, she must use k, not c. Have your child check out Table 4-3 so she
sees just what I mean. Dictate a few words for her to spell and then flit
through the other rules, picking and choosing words to suit your child’s
level and schedule. The tables contain easy and hard words to dip into
and so many of them that you may want to pace yourself over a few days.

 Rule 4: When you write ca, co, and cu, you keep that “kuh” sound. If
you think this is too much for your child to remember, don’t worry so
much about detailed explanations. Instead have your child write a few
ca, co, and cu words (see Table 4-4) so she learns by practicing them.
The distinctive thing about using c is that you get the “ss” sound from 
ce (ceiling), ci (excite), and cy (cycle).

 Rule 5: Write ske and ski to keep the “kuh” sound (not sce or sci).
This rule is just an extension of the ce, ci, and cy thing. Your child can
write sketch and skip but not scetch and scip, because ce and ci make a
“ss” sound (not the “kuh” sound you want). Again, you don’t need to bog
your child down with long explanations. Just walk him through a bunch
of words from Table 4-5.

 Rule 7: Write ck immediately after a short-vowel sound. Whenever
your child hears a short-vowel sound in the word she’s spelling, she
uses ck or k after it. To decide which one to use, have your child asks
whether the “kuh” immediately follows the vowel. If the answer is yes,
she jots down “ck.” A whole bunch of words use this rule, and Table 4-7
gives you a sampling of them. You can see that ck words often are short
and very easy to spell.

 Rule 8: k after a short-vowel sound + a consonant. Whenever your child
hears a short-vowel sound in the word he’s spelling, he uses ck or k after
it. To decide which one fits, have your child ask whether the “kuh” imme-
diately follows the vowel or follows the vowel + a consonant (like il or in).
When your child hears a vowel+ a consonant he jots down “ck.”

Here’s a tough question for your child to ponder. Only three consonants
can come before k (not ck) when k follows a short-vowel sound. What
are they? Refer to Table 4-8 for some examples. (Answer: n, s, and l.)
Digraphs like ar and aw appear in front of k in words like park and hawk.
I talk about digraphs in Chapter 10.
 Rule 9: Write ake, ike, and oke to keep the “kuh” sound (not ace, ice,
or oce). Here’s the ce spelling again (only the opposite). Anytime your
child writes ce, she makes the “ss” sound. That’s why she simply can’t
make the “kuh” sound by writing things like mace, lice, and joce, but can
when she writes words like the ones that appear in Table 4-9.

 Rule 10: You can write cc in the middle of words but not kk. The cc-in-

Plenty of words have cc right in the middle, and most of them are long.
Table 4-10 gives you a good selection with which to practice, so get set-
tled in and comfortable and jot some of them down.
Because Table 4-10 is full of lengthy words, you may want to come back
to it later on when your child has practiced with spelling chunks like ai
and er.

What a lot of rules. Did you spot the fake ones? I thought that I’d add them to
the end so that nothing went wrong while you were reading all the other real
rules. The main thing is to take your time with these rules. Have your child
write just a few words in each group. Skip or use the really tricky words, like
succumb, as you like. Words like accolade can lead you into a bit of vocabu-
lary practice. Others, like accent, sound tricky but aren’t so hard after your
child gets the hang of different ways to spell the “ks” sound. To give your
child some word study (or looking hard at words and moving bits of them
around), try out the next three activities.
Activity: Back-to-front syllables
Preparation: You’ll need pen and paper and your copy of Teaching Kids to
Spell For Dummies turned to this activity.
Follow these steps:
1. Have your child write down ten two-syllable words.
2. Take the words and turn them back to front by transposing the last
and first syllables. You end up with words like cesssuc (success) and
takemis (mistake).
3. Have your child fix the jumbled words.
Activity: Filling in missing letters
Preparation: Have pen, paper, and this book ready.
Follow these steps:
1. Have your child write ten words that she thinks are pretty tricky.
2. Delete one or two letters from each of the words your child provides.
3. Have your child fill in the blanks, or missing letters.

Chapter 4: Spelling with Short Vowels

Activity: Cutting extra letters
Preparation: Have this book, a pen, and paper ready for your child 
to use.
Follow these steps:
1. Have your child write ten words that he thinks are pretty tricky.
2. Add one or two extra letters to each of the words your child provides.
3. Have your child cross out the letters that don’t belong.
Surfing the Several-Sounds Consonants
What I tell you in this section isn’t something that you have to study or mem-
orize. It is, however, interesting information for you to refer to as the need
arises. It gives you sort of well-rounded picture of how some of the conso-
nants behave, so you can tell your child that: “Most consonants represent
just one sound and are as easy as pie. You hear them and jot them down.
Some, however, behave in different ways. You jot down those ways and
choose the one that looks right.” Table 4-11 gives you an at-a-glance picture
of the spelling variants that your child will come upon. Remember, it isn’t a
test or something that you have to tattoo on the inside of your arm so that
you never forget; it’s just a handy bit of information.

Dealing with the Doubles
In this section, you get two “nearly always” rules for helping your child deal
with double letters that are easy to remember. Here’s the first:
76
Part II: Getting Easy Words onto Paper 

If a short, one-syllable word ends with the sound s, l, f, or z, your child
(nearly always) writes a double letter.
If you’re thinking something like “But bus only has one s,” you’re spot-on.
Remember that these rules are really handy, but they’re “nearly always”
rules. And if the bus thing drives you crazy, you may want to tell your child
about words like bus, yes, and us. (Other rogue words are quiz and whiz and
nil and pal.) Table 4-12 provides some examples of words with double letters.

A different way to have your child write spellings is to present him with rid-
dles. See how he likes these:
77
Chapter 4: Spelling with Short Vowels

In the “Riddles of things you shouldn’t do” activity up next, I give you riddles
in which your child moves spelling chunks around, an activity that often is
called phonographics or graphophonics.

Answer: Cliff, sniff, and stiff. 
Putting the Vowels into Perspective
When you lead your child through written words, you tell her many things.
The one factor that probably has a wider application than anything else that
you tell her is this:
You need to put a vowel in almost every word there is. In words like why and
cry, y plays the role of a vowel. That’s why teachers sometimes call y the other
vowel. I talk about the y-acting-like-a-vowel rule in Chapter 9. You often put a few
vowels into words, because they make at least two different sounds. The two
sounds that each of the five vowels always make are short and long sounds.
The short sound is in words like mat, pet, ink, hop, and cut. The long sound is 
in words like mate, Pete, like, hope, and cute.
So the perspective that you need to have on vowels is that vowels sure are
important!
79
Chapter 4: Spelling with Short Vowels

Spelling Short Vowels
Nearly any time that your child hears a short-vowel sound, like in apple (not
ape), egg (not eagle), ink (not idol), olive (not open) and up (not universe),
he uses just one vowel to spell it. How easy is that? In Table 4-13, I give you
a glimpse of the trillions of words that your child spells with a short vowel.
(He may think that they’re beneath him now that he’s already trotted through
a whole heap of bigger words.)

If you look closely at Table 4-13, you can see that short vowels follow a pat-
tern. When your child writes a short word (with only one chunk of sound or
one syllable) and puts a single vowel between consonants (or consonant
blends like st and mp), he makes a short-vowel word.
Some of the words that don’t follow this pattern are words like her and stork.
That’s because these words have a vowel+r in them, and that’s a whole differ-
ent ball game. I talk about vowel+r words in Chapter 11. Words like bread and
said defy the rule too, but you can show them to your child later, after he’s
practiced this easier spelling pattern.
Your child uses the same (consonant-vowel-consonant) pattern to write most
short-vowel bits of words like in mid-night, home-less and car-pet.
What’s the best way to get your child spelling smoothly with short vowels?
Have her doodle with word patterns like an, pan, and man; can, cat, and cap;
and hat, hit, and hot. These three kinds of doodling are in the “Changing a
first letter,” “Changing a last letter,” and “Changing a vowel” activities that I
give you next.
Activity: Changing a first letter
Preparation: Cut out small pieces of card or paper (about the size of sticky
notes) and grab your pen and paper — a whiteboard and marker is even
better.
Follow these steps:
1. Have your child write each of the letters that follow on separate
pieces of the paper you just cut out.
b, d, f, g, h, l, m, n, p, r, s, t, and v
81
Chapter 4: Spelling with Short Vowels

2. Have your child write “an” on his paper, and then move the lettered
cutouts, one at a time, in front of an to help him make and then write
words like tan, pan, and man.
3. Follow the directions in Steps 1 and 2, using ap, at, et, and ip in place
of an and pointing out that not all the words your child makes will be
real words. Some will be nonsense words like han, so he can discount
(and not write) them.
All teachers show children word families like the ones in the change-a-letter
activities. A word family is a bunch of words that share a last sound. The
words your child just wrote in the “Changing a first letter” activity were word
families, and I tell you the ins and outs of them in Chapter 10. By the way, a
teacher may talk of other kinds of word families — words that describe feel-
ings is one — but the last-sound kind of word family is a favorite in spelling
programs.
Chunks of sound, like at and ap, go by the names of phonemes, phonograms,
or phonographs among people who like to use technical words. I can give you
the fine details, but really it’s still plain old chunks of sound that I’m talking
about here. (Syllable is the same, a nice word, but again, chunk of sound
pretty much says the same thing.)
Activity: Changing a last letter
Preparation: Cut out small pieces of card or paper (about the size of sticky
notes) and have pen and paper or whiteboard and marker so your child is
ready to write.
Follow these steps:
1. Have your child write each of the letters that follow on separate
pieces of the paper you just cut out.
d, g, n, p, and t
2. Have your child write “bu” on her’s and then move the lettered
cutouts, one at a time, after bu to help her make and then write words
like bug, bus, and but.
3. Follow the directions in Steps 1 and 2, using ba, ta, and pi in place of
bu and pointing out that not all the words your child makes will be
real words.
Activity: Changing a vowel
Preparation: You need this book and pen and paper.
82
Part II: Getting Easy Words onto Paper 

After your child breezes happily through the changing-a-letter activities, she
may feel that a change of direction would be nice. The “Ten words in a chain”
activity stays with short-vowel spellings, but requires a bit more figuring out.
The object is for your child to spell ten different words that follow a formula.
But anyway, read on, you’ll see what I’m getting at.
Activity: Ten words in a chain
Preparation: You need this book (turned to this exercise) and pen and paper.
Follow these steps:
1. Cover the answers on the right of the list of words that follows.
2. Have your child change each word in the list one letter at a time,
trying to make ten different words in all. You’re not allowed to repeat
the same word twice. The starting words are sank, lash, and chap.

17. den
18. sock
19. cup
20. trap
21. hut
22. bog
23. not
24. fat
25. slash
Follow these steps:
1. Have your child change the vowel in each word in the list that follows
into another vowel. Changing the vowels turns the listed words into
new ones.
2. If your child’s feeling smug, I suggest that you time his efforts. Can he
find the answers in three minutes?

3. Have your child write down each listed word.
4. After each word in the list, have your child make the word chains.
Look at the examples that I give to see how it works.
1. Sank (Answer: sink, silk, sulk, hulk, husk, dusk, dust, duct, duck)
2. Lash (Answer: cash, cast, cost, lost, list, mist, most, mast, mask)
3. Chap (Answer: chip, chop, shop, ship, slip, slap, slop, stop, step)
After you finish the chains, let your child use many different colors to high-
light the different short-vowel sounds — pink for u, green for a, and so on.
For a real challenge, you can give your child the first and the last words so
that she has to figure out how to make the changes to get from one word to
the other.
Doing puzzles is so much fun that I have to give you one more. The “Spelling
circle” activity is a word-building puzzle in which you write a common spelling
chunk, like ap or an, in the middle of a circle and then pepper a dozen other let-
ters or blends, like m and st, all around it. You then ask your child to jot down
words by mixing and matching the outside letters with the middle letters.
Activity: Spelling circle
Preparation: All you need is a piece of paper and a pen, and of course, your
copy of this book.
Follow these steps:
1. Have your child draw a large circle.
2. Tell your child to write a nice big “ap” in the center of the circle.
3. Have your child write each of the letters that follow inside the circle
around the ap in the center.
m, t, l, s, c, f, g, n q, sl, and sp
4. Have your child draw lines from the ap to the letters that make words
(this is a nice visual exercise and a break from writing words). How
many words can your child make?
In Chapter 8, you hear about spelling chunks like ea and oa. You can make
great spelling circles with them, too, because your child gets to add letters
and blends to both ends (mean, moat, speak, and so on).
84
Part II: Getting Easy Words onto Paper 

Spelling in Chunks
The best way for your child to spell is in chunks. Single-letter spelling is a 
long and inefficient way of learning to spell, and studies of good spellers show
that they know all about short-vowel chunks like ap, ack, and ell. They’re also
on top of other chunks like ight and eam, but in this chapter, I try to stay with
short vowels. Getting your child really comfortable with short-vowel chunks is
a good idea. Instead of having him spell like this, s-p-e-ll, have him try this, sp-
ell. Have your child practice spelling word families like spell, bell, smell, shell,
and fell to help get him into the habit of spelling in chunks. When you show
him plenty of short-vowel chunks, you find that doing so comes in handy not
only for small words but also for big words. A chunk like ant, for example,
shows up in impressive words like distant, anterior, and cantaloupe. In the next
section, I give you some words that may at first look hefty to your child, but
won’t seem scary at all when she’s breaking them into short-vowel chunks.
Spelling Long Words From Short Sounds
My 9-year-old firmly believes that she’s old enough to wear makeup, shop
alone at the mall, and ride her bike on the road without having me in slow 
pursuit. She wants to do everything now, regardless of whether it’s preparing
for the new century or knitting a sofa. Every now and then I relent. She gets 
to smear hot-pink makeup on her eyelids and cheeks and shop in the small
nearby mall with me patrolling nervously a shop away. When you give your
child a taste of grown-up things, she feels proud (not the least because she’s
browbeaten you into it). The words in Table 4-14 give your child that same sat-
isfaction with her spellings. She can spell every mature word there, because
they’re all made from short-vowel chunks. Show her the lofty words. Dictate
some for her to spell. Let her wallow in torrents of satisfaction. Let her flit clev-
erly through the “Finding the gap” activity to bring her gently back to earth.
Pronounce a few of these words slightly weirdly so that your budding speller
can get her pen around them. Pronounce children, for example, as a clear
“child-ren” instead of saying “childrun” the way you normally would.

Writing Short Vowels Inside Sight Words
My mom uses the expression, “You may as well be hung for a sheep as a
lamb,” and it seems to apply here, because I’m about to give you yet another
big picture (sheep not lamb sized) of sight words (which I explain in nice
easy steps in Chapter 12), because, well, I may as well be hung for a sheep 
as a lamb.
Sight words are really common words, so I spend a considerable amount of
time on them in this book. They crop up again and again in text (any ordinary
text that you care to read or write, for that matter), so naturally your child
must be able to spell them again and again. I have to tell you right now that
some sight words are pretty tricky, but guess what, I just pored through the
220 sight words that I offer up in Chapter 12, and I have some good news.
Sixty of those words are straightforward, made from short-vowel chunks. You
can show them to your child right now in Table 4-15, and he can spell them
right now, unless of course, you’ve been kneeling down to read this lengthy
chapter and you’ve lost all feeling in your legs or you’ve been waiting to go to
the bathroom. In that case, loosen up a little or take that potty break, I’ll still
be here, and when you get back, I’ll show you a novel way to make your child
feel illuminated by flashing forward to the “Words by flashlight” activity.

Activity: Spelling by flashlight
Preparation: Have your child lie in bed in a darkened room with a flashlight
in hand.
Follow these steps:
1. When your child’s lying in bed, and you’re saying goodnight, grab a
flashlight and hop onto the bed with him.
2. Dim the lights, and with the flashlight, print a word on the ceiling or
wall for him to read.
3. Take a couple of turns each (and then act surprised when other family
members complain that you hyped him up and he won’t sleep).
Taking One Vowel at a Time
As you flip through this book, you can find plenty of information about
vowels. Vowels are up to all sorts of mischief. They each make a few sounds,
partner up with some letters (like r) to make new sounds (ar, er, ir, or, and
ur), make vague “uh” sounds in some words (like idea — i-dee-uh) and some-
times are silent like the e on the end of a whole battalion of words (like, note,
and cute). In this section, I give you a quick overview of the kind of things
each vowel can do. Don’t worry about getting an inside-out and back-to-front
understanding because I discuss vowels in detail in Chapters 7 and 8. The
information I give you here is for quick, optional reference, not prolonged,
keep-the-caffeine-coming study.
Attending to the a’s
Your child spells the regular or short sound of a with all-on-its-own a.
He spells the “uh” sound in words like again (“uh-gain”) and banana (“buh-
nan-uh”) with a.
He makes the long-a (“ay”) sound in a bunch of ways:
 ay like in bay
 ai like in pain
 _a_e like in cane
 ei like in eight
 ei like in vein
88
Part II: Getting Easy Words onto Paper 

 ea like in break
 a like in baby
 _e_e like in crepe
Enter the e’s
Your child spells the regular or short sound of e with all-on-its-own e.
She writes a silent e on the end of long-vowel words like cane, pine, and cope.
She writes e after c or g to make the soft-s and j sounds like in cent and gent.
She spells the long-i (“ey”) sound with:
 ee like in been
 ea like in bean
 _e_e like in here
 ei like in either
 ie like in niece
 y like in happy
 ey like in monkey
Including the i’s
Your child spells the regular or short sound of i with all-on-its-own i.
He spells the long-i (“eye”) sound with:
 _i_e like in like
 y like in my
 i like in find
 ie like in pie
 ei like in height
 uy like in buy
 ye like in dye
89
Chapter 4: Spelling with Short Vowels

On the go with o
She makes the regular or short sound of o with all-on-its-own o.
She spells the long-o (“oh”) sound with:
 _o_e like in cone
 o like in no and yolk
 oa like in road
 ow like in low
 oe like in hoe
 ough like in dough
 ew like in sew
 oo like in brooch (the jewelry)
 ou like in soul
Up and away with u
Your child spells the regular or short sound of u (“uh”) with all-on-its-own u.
He spells the long-u (“ewe”) sound with:
 _u_e like in cute
 oo like in moon
 ew like in new
 eu like in feud
 ue like in cue
 ugh like in Hugh
 ie like in view
A word about open syllables
Sometimes your child writes a single vowel at the start of a word, and it
makes a long vowel sound. Although it looks just like a short vowel, because
90
Part II: Getting Easy Words onto Paper 

it’s a vowel all alone and often sits between two consonants, it’s a long vowel
nevertheless. It ends, or makes all by itself, the first syllable (or chunk) in
words like even (e-ven) and reply (re-ply) and because it completes the sylla-
ble and isn’t closed in, so to speak, by the next consonant, the syllable is
called an open syllable. Table 4-16 gives you a bunch of open-syllable words
so that your child can become comfortable with spelling them.
Always familiarize your child with the spelling chunks that he needs before
asking him to go right ahead and spell a word.
Don’t be afraid to skip words in Table 4-16 or any other table in this book.
Even if you skip the whole thing, you can always come back to it later.

Chapter 5
Blending Letters Together
In This Chapter
 Introducing blends
 Getting to know good blends from outlawed blends
 Putting blends in their right places
Your child may write words like pekt and klap. When she does (and even
if she doesn’t), showing her that certain letter combinations simply
aren’t allowed is up to you — the spelling police say so. This chapter helps
you lead your child away from bad blends, like kt and kl, and toward nicer
blends like cr, dr, and str.
Blending Two and Three Letters Together
Look around, and you’ll see blends everywhere. Right at this moment, for
example, I’m sitting at a table with a box of laundry detergent at my elbow.
(It’s reminding me to go get my laundry before I delay anyone else’s use of
the washing machine. Don’t let me forget.) On the detergent box, I see these
words (along with a few hundred others that my morning eyesight isn’t up to
viewing): detergent, product, and plastic. All three words contain a blend —
two (or three) side-by-side consonants that, well, blend together. Each letter
in the blend keeps its own sound, but the first letter blends into the second,
and the second letter blends into the third (if you have one). Your child
writes blends all over the place, at the beginning of words like product(pr)
and plastic(pl), on the end of words like detergent(nt), and in the middle of
words that have endings added on, like milked(lk).
Blends pepper nearly all the spellings that your child uses, so he needs to
spell them smoothly. The great thing about blends is that they’re obliging.
Your child hears them clearly and spells them just as they sound. Don’t let
him become disconcerted by their abundance. Although their numbers may
seem like too much to come to grips with, your child soon will move through
them with ease. In this chapter, I tidy up how blends work and organize them
into manageable groups.

The blends in this chapter are made of consonants. Most teachers mean con-
sonant blends whenever they talk about blends, but sometimes they talk
about vowel blends, too. I discuss pairs of vowels, like ea and ai in Chapter 8.
There’s so much to find out about pairs of vowels (like which letters typically
buddy-up) that they deserve their own chapter.
In Chapter 6, I talk about pairs of consonants called digraphs. The difference
between a blend and a digraph (in case you’re just itching to know) is this:
 A blend is two or three letters that merge into each other but keep their
own individual sounds, like in pr or str.
 A digraph is two letters buddying-up to make a whole new sound that’s
different from the letters’ two individual sounds, like in ch or sh.
Writing Words with Blends at the Front
Right here in the heading to this section, you see two words whose first letters
are blends. The words “blends” and “front” start with the common blends, bl
and fr. Your child needs to be able to write blends like bl and fr effortlessly so
she can give more thought to the other letters in her words. Why, for example,
is it front and not frunt? Hmm, that’s a good question. Your child can either get
all long-winded about “uh” spellings or jot down “front” a few times to fix it in
her mind. (I know which one I’d choose.)
If you’re right in the middle of showing your child blends and come across a
tricky word like “front,” have him jot “front” down a few times. Jotting down a
word is a good way to help your child remember the spelling, and because it’s
quick to do, you stay on track with blends. Later, when you’re done with blends
(for the time being), show him how word families can help fix spellings in his
mind. Show him, for example, that in words like some, come, brother, mother,
and front, he spells the “uh” sound with an o. 
Table 5-1 shows you common front blends. The only blend in the whole bunch
that you may need to clarify for your child is squ (and even that’s pretty easy).
Your child writes “squ” even though she hears only a sq sound in the word
she’s spelling, because, get this, q always brings u along. Whenever your child
hears a q sound, she jots down qu. The u is silent but you’ll always find one
after a q, just the same.
If you’re on the ball, you’ll notice that I’m talking about a consonant and
vowel here, q and u, when I distinctly said I’d talk only about consonants.
Well that’s why the q-u marriage takes a little thought — q is an exceptional
consonant. Because it never goes anywhere without u (except perhaps to
Iraq!), your child treats squ as a consonant blend. The s blends into the qu,
which makes just the “q” sound.

Look over the blends in Table 5-1 with your child, and then rummage through
your recycling. Did you keep that pizza box from the weekend? If you did,
grab it for the game that I tell you about next. If your box went out with the
recycling, or you’re not a pizza-loving family, don’t fret. You can play the
pizza box game by drawing a large, pizza-size circle on paper rather than
using a pizza box.

The pizza game is fun. Anytime your family has pizza, you can use the box for
this game before sending it off for reincarnation. (You may want to get rid of
any lingering bits of pepperoni or bacon first.)
Activity: Making great use of a pizza box
Preparation: Gather together a large pizza box, different colored pens, and
some sheets of regular paper to jot scores onto.
Follow these steps:
1. Have your child draw a 12-slice pizza on the box with a 1-inch circle
in the very center (sort of like a dart board). Use the side of the box
that doesn’t have so much printing.
2. Have your child write a different blend on each slice.
3. Have your child hold a pen in one hand and cover his eyes with his
other hand.
4. As you turn the box in a circle in front of your child, have him point
(with the pen) to a place on the turning box (a bit like the television
spelling game, Wheel of Fortune). If the pen points to the center circle,
your child scores ten points, but if it lands on a line, try again.
96
Part II: Getting Easy Words onto Paper 

5. Whenever your child lands on a slice, have him write a word, using
the blend written on that slice. Award one point for every letter in the
word.
6. Have your child cross off (or otherwise indicate) the slice that already
has been played. Pretend that slice has been eaten so that it can’t be
used for the rest of the game.
7. Keep playing and keeping score. Whenever a player lands on a slice
that’s already been eaten that player loses a turn and play proceeds to
the next player. The first player to score 30 point wins.
Your child will get a kick out of spelling big words in the pizza game. Help her
make words longer by adding suffixes (like ing), and try the same game again
with other kinds of words or blends. A good variant is to mark slices with
pairs of vowels (like ee, ea, oa, and ai), repeating them until all the slices are
marked.
Another simple and fun word-making game, “Seven super shapes,” starts off
with your child drawing seven little shapes.
Activity: Seven super shapes
Preparation: Gather together paper and pen.
Follow these steps:
1. Have your child to draw seven shapes (flowers, hearts, pizzas, cars,
you name it). You can draw them for you child, if you’d prefer.
2. In each shape, have your child write a letter. Make sure that you have
two vowels and five common consonants (so you get a mix like a, e, s, r,
t, n, and d).
3. Ask your child to use the available letters to make more than seven
words from the letters (like rent, sent, send, stand, strand, rest, nest,
tend, and trend). Each word must have a blend, but using a letter twice
is okay. 
Make this activity easier by allowing your child to spell out any kind of word,
not just words with blends.
Choosing between sc and sk
Wouldn’t it be fun if you could whisk me from my desk right now to jet off to
your private island? You could teach me scuba diving, skiing, and skydiving;
rustle me up some scaloppini; leave me in the care of your personal maids
while you scoot off to attend to my kids. Sounds good, right? Alas, I’m sched-
uled for more prosaic things. I have a sc versus sk issue to deal with here.
97
Chapter 5: Blending Letters Together

Your child needs to know when to use sc and when to use sk. Here’s the
scoop: Your child writes “sk” (not sc) before e and i, like in sketch and skin. If
she writes scetch and scin, she makes soft c sounds, like in scene and science.
To keep the hard-c sound in words like sketch, skim, skin, skill and skid your
child must jot down a decisive k. If you want to go get a quick lead on hard
and soft sounds, you can flip over to Chapter 14 (I’ll hang here for a while).
Ske and ski make hard-c sounds but sce and sci, make a soft-c sounds. 
Okay, so now you’re asking, “What about words like scab and skate?” Is there
anything I need to bear in mind about which one my child should look for?
The short answer is, “No.” No hard-and-fast rule exists for choosing between
sca and ska, but I have a sound piece of advice: When you don’t know; have a
go. In fact, I’d say that this piece of wisdom is so darned acute that it needs
to be repeated with a “Remember” icon right after this paragraph. My advice
isn’t in the least bit like rocket science. It may even sound clichéd and worn,
but it works. If you give your child too much “if this, then that” type of
advice, she’ll zone out. If, on the other hand, you encourage her to jot down
all her options (scab/skab, scate/skate), she gets better at spotting the
spelling that simply looks right. So in a nutshell, tell her:
“When you don’t know; have a go.”
Tell your child to jot down the spelling possibilities he thinks of and then opt
for the one that irks him the least. Even if he chooses the wrong spelling, he’ll
probably remember the right one next time, because of the nuisance it caused.
Okay, time for less talk and more action. Table 5-2 lays out sc and sk words for
you to walk your child through. Explain that ke and ki make the hard-c sound
(unlike ce and ci). When he spells words that have sc or sk followed by a, o,
98
Part II: Getting Easy Words onto Paper 
Coping with words like kinder and cinder
Just in case you’d like to know a bit more about
k and c stuff right now, I’ll tell you a little about
words like kinder and cinder. Spellings like ki and
si aren’t blends; blends are consonants like cr
and cl. You can find more about the soft-c sound
in Chapter 14. Anyway, kind, king, kill, and kiss all
start with ki. Ki is a cool letter combination. Ci
won’t give you the same “k” sound, because it
yields a soft-c sound, like in circus.
Kept, keen, kelp, and kettle all start with ke. Ke is
good, too. Like ki, ke gives the “k” sound, but if
you write ce, you make a soft-c sound again, like
in cent.
Something’s happening here, right? Yep. In a
roundabout sort of way, I’m telling you to give
your child this advice: You make the hard “k”
sound, in phrases like “keep kissing,” with k. K
goes in front of e and i. And, on the other hand,
in front of a, o, and u, you nearly always put c,
like in cat, cot and cut.

or u, like scan, score, and skittle, he uses the noble strategy of trial and error,
or “When you don’t know; have a go.”

If your head is reeling with all these c and k quirks, here’s some important
advice: Watch out for c. That’s it. Because c can make a soft sound (ss), just
tell your child to watch out whenever it is paired with e or i. Words like scene
and science show what happens with sce and sci words. Oh, and if another
letter separates the c from the e or i, like in schedule and school, things get
back to normal, and you don’t need to worry about c making it’s “ss” sound.
The same thing applies to scr, which I talk about next (no need to worry
about c making a “ss” sound, because it isn’t right in front of e or i).
Strangled eggs
Oops, I mean “scrambled.” I couldn’t resist using cheap ploys to pique your
interest. Are you piqued? Good. Here are a few words to consider: screw,
scream, and screech (a motley assortment, aren’t they?). Your child can write
scr in front of e and i without a care in the world. In fact, he must use scr,
because the skr blend is an outlawed combination. You don’t see it, write it,
or get caught up with it in any way. Spelling police don’t miss much.
Your child spells many words that start with scr, but he won’t ever spell a
word that starts with skr.
Spelling with cc and x
By now you may be suspicious of c and k. They’re slippery letters that com-
bine in different ways and make different sounds. Don’t worry. In this chapter,
I give you all the permutations of c and k and a bit more besides. This section
99
Chapter 5: Blending Letters Together

is part of that little bit extra. I want to give you a helpful snippet about pop-
ping cc into words like accident and soccer, so here it is:
Your child spells some words with cc more or less in the middle. The sound
she’ll spell with cc is hard-c, like in soccer, or hard-cs, like in access. Lead her
through these spellings because that “cs” sound is just like the sound in exit
or exclude. Your child needs to get to know the look of cc or x words so she
isn’t caught jotting down the wrong one. In Table 5-3, I show you cc and x
words so you can help your child practice spelling them. If you’re steadily
leading your child through this book, you may want to tackle this table
slowly, during the course of a few days. If your child’s setting a fast past and
wants to push ahead, have her take the whole table by storm. The activities
that I give with this table help your child look for similarities in the words so
that they’re easier for her to remember later on.

Activity: Sorting your double-c’s
Preparation: Make a copy of this table and find some color highlighters.
Follow these steps (with dialogue in quotations):
1. Say to your child, “In column one, there are words with two or three
chunks of sound (or syllables). Color the two-chunk words in one
color, and then color the three-chunk words in a new color.”
100
Part II: Getting Easy Words onto Paper 

Help your child break the words into parts by drawing a pen line (or
slash) between the chunks. Break the first chunk after the first c. Point
out spelling features to watch out for, like the ou part of account and the
ai part of acclaim.
2. Tell your child to, “Read the words to yourself,” and after she’s done
that say, “I’ll read them for you to write, now.”
Dictate the six words in the first column of Table 5-3 to your child. These
are tricky words, so when your child has spelled them correctly, be gen-
erous with your praise.
3. Repeat steps 1 and 2, using the words in the second column of 
Table 5-3.
If your child has trouble spelling these words, make the task smaller. Focus
only on the two-syllable words at first (there are four of them). Have your
child say the words in chunks. Have him circle or underline tricky letters.
Have him jot the words down a couple of times. Then dictate the words for
him to spell (and cheer him on). When he’s happy with the two-syllable
words, add accurate and occupy. Break accurate into ac-cu-rate and occupy
into oc-cu-py. Have your child jot down the new words a couple of times.
Dictate all six words and then take a well-earned break. Later, when you’ve
finished your cookies and milk or your two-hour, fully equipped, hike into
town and back (if you enjoy moderate exercise), have one last quick test of
the six words.
Activity: Looking at ex words
Preparation: Make a copy of Table 5-3 and a copy of the list of 23 exercises in
Step 4.
Follow these steps (suggested dialogue is in quotations).
1. Have your child: “Find excited in Table 5-3 and color all the two-sylla-
ble words before “excited” in one color.
2. Have your child: “Draw a line through each word that you colored,
after the ex.”
3. Ask your child: “What’s the same about all these words?” Wait for your
child to answer that they’re all made of two chunks or help her figure
this out.
4. Hand a copy of the list that follows to your child and tell her to:
“Circle the correct words in this list.”
1. explain — explane
2. explode — expload

Activity: Extending yourself with ex words
Preparation: Make a copy of Table 5-3.
Follow these steps:
1. Find excited in Table 5-3 and color it and all the three-syllable words
after it in one color.
2. Read each of the ten questions that follow to your child and write
down, for him to see, the three-syllable ex word he has to find.
3. Have your child write each answer on his own paper and then move
to the next question.
102
Part II: Getting Easy Words onto Paper 

1. Can you find and write down a word with “bit” in it?
2. Can you find and write down a word with “cell” in it?
3. Can you find and write down a word with “cut” in it?
4. Can you find and write down a word with “rat” in it?
5. Can you find and write down a word with “rant” in it?
6. Can you find and write down a word with “mine” in it?
7. Can you find and write down a word with “tin” in it?
8. Can you find and write down a word with “ted” in it?
9. Can you find and write down a word with “ample” in it?
10. Can you find and write down a word with “orb” in it?
If your child’s cruising along with ease, have her give you her paper and dic-
tate the words for her to write from scratch.
Your child probably likes figuring out things side by side with you. By writing
with and being alongside your child, you convey good things. Conversely, if
your child’s the keep-away-I-have-to-do this-myself kind, you can give her all
the words and make yourself scarce.
Writing Words with Blends at the End
Okay, just to show you how frequently your child needs to spell blends, let
me refer you once again to the title bar (the heading above). I typed the title
of this section without thinking about including blends, but guess what, they
turned up anyway. Blends at the end are featured in the words, writing,
blends, words, and end. That’s four words out of seven. That’s how common
blends are (at least in this heading). You can be sure that your child needs to
run his pen smoothly through ngs and nds and other companionable conso-
nants. Table 5-4 shows you the blends your child needs to know and a bunch
of straightforward words for him to practice with. Dictate the words for him
to write and then lead him through the “Always ct (never kt)” activity, which
focuses on the ct blend so he’s not fooled into writing kt.
If you’re wondering why I don’t include th as a blend in this chapter, I deal
with it (along with ch, sh, wh, and ph) as a consonant digraph in Chapter 6.
Remember that a consonant digraph is a special spelling unit made of two
consonants that together make one new sound that isn’t like their individual
sounds blending together.

Doing away with kt
A simple spelling rule for the ct sound is that it’s always ct and never kt. Just
like that bad habit you’re wanting to break, you simply do away with kt, never
to be heard from again.
Activity: Always ct (never kt)
This activity (bidding kt bon voyage — poor girl) is quick and easy and it
helps your child see that the ct blend is the one he needs to write on the end
of words, while the kt blend is just plain weird looking. After your child cir-
cles the answers, you can dictate them back to him so he gets even more
chance to fix ct in his mind.
Preparation: Make a copy of the ten questions in the list that follows.
Follow this step: Have your child to circle each correct spelling.
1. insect — insekt — insect
2. reject — reject — rejekt
3. currect — correct — correkt
104
Part II: Getting Easy Words onto Paper 

4. dierect — direct — direkt
5. fact — fackt — fakt
6. inspect — inspeckt — inspecte
7. pakt — pact — packt
8. duct — duckt — dukt
9. detect — detect — deatect
10. defect — defect — defect
Here’s how you can tell the difference between pact and packed, duct and
ducked, and so on. The ed endings are tagged onto verbs, or doing-type
words like pack and duck — as in watch your head. Pact and duct aren’t
verbs; they’re nouns (things).
Sorting c, ck, and k
Do you have an “ic” sound on the end of a two- or three-syllable word? Spell it
“ic,” like in picnic, panic, and terrific.
Hear “c” straight after a short vowel? Spell it “ck,” like in lick, clock, and neck.
Whenever you hear “nk,” “sk,” or “lk” at the end of a word, spell it with a “k.”
K, which always is accompanied by another consonant, is more common on
the end of a word than c is.
By the same token, whenever you hear “c” after a long vowel sound, spell it
“k” like in cloak and peek or “ke” like in cake, joke, and spike.
A long vowel is a vowel written in the middle of words like mate, Pete, hike,
slope, and cute. It has a distinctly long pronunciation (like the names of the
vowels a, e, i, o, and u) when compared with the pronunciation of the short
vowel in words like mat, met, mit, cot, and cut.
Phew. Did I make that sound hard? If I did, I’m sorry, because after you and
your child get into the swing of things, you find out that it gets easier and
easier for your child to jot down the right spellings. He will see that some
letter combinations just look all wrong from the start. The more words you
have him try out, the better he gets at telling right from wrong. In Table 5-5, 
I lay out plenty of words for your child to peruse. When he’s all perused-out,
point him to the “Making sense of c, k, and ck” activity.

Nosing through ng and nk
Paying extra attention to the ng and nk endings is worth the effort, because
they’re not as clearly pronounced as other blends. They’re called nasal
blends. Apparently everyone makes the sound of these blends in their noses.
I’m not great at telling nose-noises from other kinds of noise (with a few
exceptions), but I know that your child may one day wonder whether to write
somethink or something. He may get tied up with a bunch of ings and inks, so
this section gives you a few to think about. Your child will whiz through Table
5-6, because every word has a dead-easy short vowel in it. Dictate them to
him. For fun, set the timer and find out whether he can write all the words in
less than three minutes.

Hard? Not at all!
After sorting through the many computations of
c and k you may be feeling like you need a rest.
Maybe two weeks at some retreat? Maybe your
own personal masseuse? Or maybe I can cheer
you up by giving you a peek at a kid who tackles
bigger and scarier spellings just for the thrill of it.
Fourteen-year-old David Tidmarsh from Indiana
recently won the 2004 National Spelling Bee.
David outdid 264 rivals (including one who
fainted on stage but recovered to take second
place). David’s winning word was “autochtho-
nous,” which, by the way, means indigenous. His
other spellings included “arete,” “sophrosyne,”
“sumpsimus,” and “serpiginous.” Spellers were
given a set time limit of 2 minutes to spell each
word, followed by a final 30-second period with
a countdown clock. And here you are, miffed
because I threw a few measly c’s and k’s at you.

Chapter 6
Choosing ch (and sh, 
th, ph, and wh, too)
In This Chapter
 Discovering consonant digraphs
 Getting to know the key pairs
 Guiding your child through who, where, and were
A
few days ago, I was idly flicking through the pages of my daughter’s
magazines when a headline caught my eye. It read: “Get a beach-ready
body in just two weeks.” Knowing that I was being duped, but helpless to
resist, I turned to the article. I was reading about the buttock clenching and
belly crunching that I’d be required to do, when I saw an extra paragraph. It
told me not to race off for my new bikini quite yet. To achieve sculpted per-
fection I’d have to do a few hundred hours of intense aerobic activity in
between all that clenching and squeezing.
Don’t you hate hidden extras! You won’t find any of that in this chapter. The
consonant digraphs that I tell you about here are exactly as they seem. You
can give your child a good start with spelling them by helping him through
the activities in this chapter. No extra laps are required.
Delving into Digraphs
Digraph is a scary name for something quite simple. Di means two, and graph
means something drawn or written. Together, they cast no disparaging light
at all on what’s going on here! (A more helpful word would be “di-letters/new-
sound” but I guess that’s never going to happen.) A digraph is two letters that
make their own new sound when put together.

Blends are two letters that keep their individual sounds when put together,
such as st and cl. Find out more about blends in Chapter 5. Digraphs, by con-
trast, make a whole new sound, like ch. The main consonant digraphs are ch,
sh, th, ph, and wh, although to my ear wh sounds just like w.
In this book, I don’t dwell too much on the term “vowel digraphs,” because
when you talk about vowel digraphs you mean reams of spellings. Vowel
digraphs are pairs like ee, ea, ai, oa, oi, and ou and spellings like aw, ay,
and oy, that are made from a vowel and a consonant — because they make 
a sound that also can be made by vowels (au, a, oi). You can see just how
elaborate the vowel digraph group can get, so in this book, I take a few vowel
digraphs at a time and focus on other aspects of them. You see ee, ea, ai, 
and oa in Chapter 8, where I talk about the when-two-vowels-go-walking-the-
first-one-does-the-talking rule, and in Chapter 11, where I talk about many dif-
ferent word families, like aw and au, ou and ow, and oi, and oy. Oh, another
term that you see in some spelling books is diphthong. It’s yet another fancy
term to describe spelling chunks like oi and ou that are technically “gliding
transitions from one vowel sound to another.” With digraphs and diphthongs
overlapping and covering so many spellings, it’s easiest to talk about good
old spelling chunks.
Chewing Your Pencil Over ch
The ch digraph is especially nice. It makes a sound unlike any other and after
a bit of practice your child can easily use it. The words in Table 6-1 give the
easiest ch words of all, the ones that start with ch and have a short vowel in
them. Have your child read the words to you and write out a few that you dic-
tate to her. Do the same with the words in Table 6-2, which are the next easi-
est words of all, the ones that end with ch and have a short vowel. Then play
the Lay-3 card game I describe in “Mastering ch with the Lay-3 card game”
activity.
A short vowel is the vowel your child writes in words like mat, met, mit, cot,
and cut. It has the short pronunciation of a like in ant, e like in egg, i like in
igloo, o like in octopus, or u like in up.

If you’re wondering why I give you more ch endings than ch beginnings, it’s
because I’m using only short-vowel words and there are more of them in the
endings group. I start talking about long-vowel words in Chapter 7.
Activity: Mastering ch with the Lay-3 card game
I adapted this card game from another one called Strip Jack Naked. Don’t tell
Jill. Actually, I played Strip Jack Naked with my grandma when I was a kid, so
it isn’t that bad. I never saw her remove so much as a hair curler, and I know I
was always fully clothed, so the name still intrigues me.
Preparation: With 32 index cards, write the number 3 on 8 of them and write
“ch” on 8 more cards, leaving the remaining 16 cards blank.
Follow these steps:
1. Deal all the cards facedown, splitting them equally between the two of
you.
2. Have your child lay down one card face up from the cards he’s been
dealt.
111
Chapter 6: Choosing ch (and sh, th, ph, and wh, too)

3. Take turns laying cards on the pile until one players lays either a 3 or
a ch card.
When a player lays a 3, the other player gets to lay three of cards down.
However, if that player happens to lay down a 3 in the middle of his or
her turn, play shifts to the other player (who then tries to lay three
cards down).
If a player manages to lay down three cards in a row, finishing with a
blank card, that player picks up the entire stack and adds those cards to
his or her hand.
4. Whenever a player lays down a ch card, the other player must write
down a ch word and then lay one card down as usual.
The first player to win all the cards wins the game, if that player also has writ-
ten down an equal number of or more ch words than his or her opponent. If
not, the players must play another round (and start the word list over).
Okay, here’s the thing. Something is different about Table 6-3. Have a look at
the words with your child and check out the ch and tch endings. “Ah”, you’ll
say, “but there aren’t any tch endings.” And there you have it. Words with
long-vowel sounds nearly always end with ch, but short-vowel words nearly
always end with tch or nch. Glance back to Table 6-2 and note that these traits
are true. Of all the words in Table 6-2, only a handful of words end with just
ch. Ask your child to find them. After that task is accomplished, head to the
“Sorting long-vowel words with ch endings” word-sort activity.
A long vowel is the vowel your child writes in the middle of words like mate,
Pete, hike, slope, and cute. It has a distinctly long pronunciation compared to
the pronunciation of the short-vowel in words like mat, met, mit, cot, and cut.

Activity: Sorting long-vowel words with ch endings
Preparation: Make a copy of Table 6-3, and grab some highlighters.
Follow these steps:
1. Have your child group the words according to vowel or vowel+r com-
binations (like ee or or words).
2. Have your child color the ee words in one color, the oa words in
another color, the or words in another color, and so on.
3. Dictate the words, according to their respective color groupings, or
word families, for your child to write.
Showing Your Child sh
Sh is another great spelling chunk with its own distinctive sound. Tables 6-4
and 6-5 give you some easy, short-vowel words that start or end with sh. Skim
through them with your child and then dictate a few words for him to write.
After that, try your hand at rhyming in the “Rhyming time with sh” activity
that follows.

Thinking About th
The digraph th has a distinctive but changeable sound. Some people describe
the sounds of th as voiced or unvoiced. That explanation’s a bit surreal for 
me, so I give you the two sounds to run through with your child (no theory
needed) so that he gets a practical handle on them. The sounds are “th” like 
in then, the, and this and “th” as in think, through, and three. The difference in
sound is subtle (at least it is to my boorish ears), but with a little practice you
can have your child penning both sounds with ease. Tables 6-6 and 6-7 have
enough words to give your child more than a little practice. Look over the
words with him and then zoom forward to the “Creating th crosses” activity.

Activity: Creating th word crosses
Preparation: You’ll need a pen and paper for you and your child (white-
boards work, too).
Follow this step: Write three word crosses each.
 A word cross is four words that make a cross shape when combined a
certain way. The center of the cross is th (draw a circle around it) and
the words branch to and away from the center.
 Two of the words start with th (the words going from center to bottom
and center to right) and the other two end with th (the words going from
top to center and far left to center).
Passing through a Phase of ph
Not all that many words have ph in them, but the ones that do can look pretty
imposing. Check out Table 6-8 with your child and be prepared to get all deep
and affected with philosophy! Highlight any spelling chunks that seem tricky,
and when you’re done, zip on ahead to the “Cracking the ph cryptic code”
activity.
116
Part II: Getting Easy Words onto Paper 

Whenever I talk about spelling chunks or spelling units, I’m talking about let-
ters that naturally go together in words. Some of them are syllables (like the
two syllables in al-most) and some will be blends (like the str in strong) or
digraphs (like the ou in loud). A spelling chunk is any part of a word that your
child needs to look at more closely or get more practice with.

Activity: Cracking the ph cryptic code
Preparation: Make a copy of the list that follows. If you’re no good at cryptic
clues, don’t worry, neither am I, so the ones in this activity are pretty basic,
but probably not so basic that you won’t need to refer to the table.
Follow this step: Using Table 6-8, solve the following word puzzles.
1. This word appears four times (once on its own, three times inside other
words).
2. This word has a car at the front.
3. A boy’s name that starts with T is at the end of this word.
4. A boy’s name is at the front of this word and it appears on its own, too.
5. A tiny animal is inside this animal.
6. The name of a number is at the end of this word.
7. You may see right through this word.
8. This word has has right in its middle.
9. This word has five letters. Hint: If you took r and h away you’d leave 
a gap.
10. Take the last three letters from this word and find a female chicken.
Answers: 1 — graph, 2 — autograph, 3 — phantom, 4 — philosophy, 5 — 
elephant (ant), 6 — phone, 7 — phantom, 8 — phase, 9 — graph, and 
10 — hyphen.

Chapter 6: Choosing ch (and sh, th, ph, and wh, too)

Asking wh Questions
Wh appears in questions. Why, when, which, what, where, and the odd sound-
ing one, who? Nothing is hard about wh, except that your child may write
where when he actually means were. Show him that were isn’t a question, and
that being so, it starts with w not wh. All the other questioning words, includ-
ing the weird word who, start with wh. (Why who isn’t spelled hoo is one of
life’s many mysteries. My personal belief is that who ranks way up there with
hair combovers (do they really think we can’t tell?) and friends (so called)
who put you on hold when you call them. (Really, is anyone that much of a
VIP?) I digress! Wh is an easy digraph. Run through the questioning words
with your child, point out the hazardous where/were thing and relate your
exasperation with who. That’s really all you need to do. Ask your child ques-
tions like, “Can you think of wh words that ask questions?” Share a white-
board to jot them down. This activity need not take any longer than about
five minutes.

Coming to Grips
with Long Vowel
Sounds

In this part . . . 
L
ittle spelling rules open big doors for your child. This
part of the book shows you three long-vowel rules
that help the two of you uncover hundreds, maybe thou-
sands, of new spellings. You get the cute Bossy-e rule,
which helps your child hear the difference between words
like hop and hope and jot down the long spelling before
it’s forgotten, and you hear the “When Two Vowels Go
Walking, The First One Does The Talking” rhyme, which
helps your child surge forward with words like neat and
nail. Lastly, in words like play, funny and shy, I show you
the different ways your child can jot down y-on-the-end.

lthough some things make life easier, they sometimes have drawbacks.
Take cellphones, for example. They drive you crazy in the theater but,
in general, make life easier. Loud car stereos dull your hearing but help you
forget that all the trucks are passing you on the freeway. Clothes dryers are a
glut on power but who wants to wait three days for a dry shirt or hang out
their undies only to provide comic entertainment for every teenager in the
neighborhood? And then there’s my Bossy-e rule. Unlike these other con-
veniences that make life so much easier, it has no drawbacks. Talk about it;
write it out; add it to words. Nothing goes wrong. You and your child can use
Bossy e with impunity. No one’s going to get crazy, deaf, or wet.
Bearing with Bossy e
When your child spells a word like make or mine, she hears a long-vowel
sound in her mind. She says the word to herself, hears that she needs to
write a long vowel, and then jots it down. One common way of spelling the
long-vowel sound is to tag an e onto the end of words that otherwise have a
short-vowel sound (like kit + e = kite). An easy way to remember how the e
makes the other vowel have a long-vowel sound is to think of it as Bossy e. 
A Bossy e tells or bosses the earlier vowel into saying it’s name, which is 
just another way of saying that the earlier vowel makes a long sound.

A short-vowel sound is the sound you hear in words like mat, met, mit, cot,
and cut. A long-vowel sound is the sound the vowel makes when you pro-
nounce it as its name, like “ay,” “ee,” “eye,” “oh,” and “u.”
Bossy e makes the other vowel say its name.
Your child can spell long vowels in other ways, too. The three most common
ways are
 Using a Bossy e, like in make, hike, and cone.
 Combining two vowels (typically ee, ea, ai, and oa), and relying on the
spelling adage: “When two vowels go walking, the first one does the talk-
ing.” Check out how it works with words like in mean, seem, and loan.
(I explain that adage more in Chapter 8.)
 Behaving like a vowel, like in cry (long i) and happy (long e). I explain
more about y in Chapter 9.
The when-two-vowels-go-walking-the-first-one-does-the-talking rule applies to the
vowel pairs, ee, ea, ai and oa. Some ue and ie words are in that group too,
like cue and tie, but oo doesn’t belong here at all. Words like moon, book, and
floor all use the oo spelling, which I explain in detail in Chapter 11.
Spotting Bossy e Words
The idea of putting an “e” on the ends of words won’t surprise your child. He
sees so many words that end in e that he’s already primed for spelling them.
All that he really needs to remember when he spells Bossy e words is that 
the first vowel he uses is the long sound and the e on the end stays silent. 
(It probably does all it’s bossing by glaring and fuming.) Table 7-1 gives you
and your child an idea of just how prevalent Bossy e words are. Look through
the words with your child and then home in on a column. Give your child a
few minutes to look closely at the column, and then dictate any ten words for
him to spell. Do the same with the other columns. When your child’s done 50
words, I’d say he’s earned a snack break.

Part III: Getting to Grips with Long Vowel Sounds 

Are you back from a break? Feeling refreshed? Good. The “Back to front and
front to back” activity is a good way to ease back into Bossy e words. Your
child has to figure out the word that’s in a bit of a muddle and then write it
out anew.
Activity: Back to front and front to back
Preparation: Grab your copy of Teaching Kids to Spell For Dummies (or make
a copy of the list that follows) and some paper and a pen for your child to
work with.
Follow these steps:
1. Explain to your child that the words in the list are in a muddle. In
each word, the first letter has skipped to the end of the word or the last
letter has skipped to the front.
2. Have your child move either the first or last letters back to their origi-
nal places for each word.
3. Have your child write down each corrected word.

Spelling Bossy e Words
Here are a few ways to get your child to remember spelling patterns. You can
have your child:
 Write words out a few times
 Unjumble the letters inside different words
 Sort words into groups
These methods are good ways to fix spelling images in your child’s mind, but
my favorite spelling practice of all is proofreading. When you dictate words
to your child and get her to check her work or give her a piece of writing with
errors in it to correct, you help her develop a proofreading habit that can
prove useful her entire life. That said, the “Finding 18 errors” activity that fol-
lows is a proofreading exercise that focuses your child on Bossy e.
Activity: Finding 18 errors
Preparation: Teaching Kids to Spell For Dummies is good to have on hand for
this activity.
Follow these steps:
1. Read through “The Gruesome Story of the Greedy Ape” with your
child.
2. Find 18 words that have either an extra e or a missing e.
Give your child help when she needs it, but try not to muscle in when
she can figure things out for herself. If you think this activity is too hard
for your child, you can underline each incorrect word or jot down the
number of errors to the left of the lines that have errors in them.
The Gruesome Story of the Greedy Ape
There once was an ap who likd to tast strang things. At first she loved toe
munche on cak, graps and nutes, but then she wanted to try more foods.
126
Part III: Getting to Grips with Long Vowel Sounds 

She tried milkshaks. She tried chewing gume. She tried hote dogs. All the
food was good. What else should she eat? The ape swallowed a whole
potato. She munched three mangoes. She crunched up several can-
taloupes. She saw a snak slid past her. She grabbed it and gobbled it
down. She caught a pige grunting in the grass and swallowed him down
whole. She chasd a bulle and shoved him down her throat. You cane
guess what happened to her can’t you.
By now, your child has warmed up for writing Bossy e words pretty much
from scratch. In the “Three Bossy e quizzes” activity up next, you ask your
child to spell three groups of words. They are the three most common kinds
of Bossy e words — words that have the a-e, i-e and o-e combinations.
You may be wondering why I don’t include the e-e combination in this activ-
ity. When your child spells the long-e sound, he most often spells it with ee or
ea. I talk more about words with two vowels together in Chapter 8.
Activity: Three Bossy e quizzes
Preparation: Make a copy of this activity or have your copy of Teaching Kids
to Spell For Dummies in front of you along with pen and paper.
Follow these steps:
1. Have your child read the questions in each of the three lists —
“Words with a and Bossy e in them,” “Words with i and Bossy e in
them,” and “Words with o and Bossy e in them.”
2. Have your child write the answers. The first letter of each answer is

Your child never can get too much practice at writing Bossy e words, so
here’s “Thinking in threes,” another spell-a-word-nearly-from-scratch activity.
Your child has to hunt down and write out words from Table 7-1.
Activity: Thinking in threes
Preparation: Have pen and paper for your child to use and copy of Teaching
Kids to Spell For Dummies.
Follow these steps:
1. Have your child read the questions.
2. Have your child write three words that:
1. Start with “pi”
2. Have w in them
3. End with “de”
4. Start with “sh”
5. Have “th” in them
6. Start with “str”
7. Have m in them
8. Have more than six letters
9. Have three letters

Because you can answer the problems above with more than three
answers, an answer key cannot be provided. Use your dictionary if
you’re questioning any of the answers your child provides.
“Joke” is a Bossy e word
“Joke” is a Bossy e word and that’s all the excuse that I need to grace you
with some of my (renowned) jokes in the “Joking around with Bossy e” activ-
ity that follows.
Activity: Joking around with Bossy e
Preparation: Make a copy of the four jokes that follow and have a highlighter
ready for your child to use. The first three jokes have Bossy e words in them.
The fourth joke is there just because I’m indulging myself.
Follow this step: Have your child read the four jokes that follow and highlight
the Bossy e words.
Q: Why did the chicken cross the playground?
A: To get to the other slide.
Q: Did you hear about the two silkworms that had a race?
A: It ended in a tie.
Q: Where do mermaids go to see movies?
A: The dive-in
Q: Why do elephants never forget?
A: Because nobody ever tells them anything
You and your child have just navigated your way through an ocean (or there-
abouts) of Bossy e words. You’re nearly back at the dock, but before you tie
your nautical knots, cast off your reliable galoshes, and do other oceanic end-
of-day stuff, you can coast through the “Forming Bossy e pictures” activity
just for the fun of it. You need a crew for this one but no nets or lifejackets.

Part III: Getting to Grips with Long Vowel Sounds 

Activity: Forming Bossy e pictures
Preparation: Poster paper or whiteboard, pens, and your copy of this book
will do just fine for this activity, but have your copy of this book turned to
Table 7-1.
Follow these steps:
1. Choose up sides so that you have two teams.
2. Each player (in turn alternating between the two teams) selects a
word from Table 7-1 and draws a picture of it (the word) on the paper
or whiteboard for everyone to see.
3. Members of the opposing team try to guess what the player is draw-
ing. The person drawing the word picture is not allowed to talk while
the other players call out what word they think the drawer is drawing.
Correct answers are worth a point. The first team to score ten points wins.
Table 7-1 includes many nouns (things), but you need to leave the ones that
are easiest to draw, like plates, stripes, and a nose, for your child. Draw trick-
ier words, like lame and tame, yourself.

M
y washing machine empties itself into a sink. Today I forgot that and
flooded the entire laundry. I loaded the washing machine, turned the
dial, and headed off, right past the clothes that were soaking in the sink — 
all primed to obstruct the flow from the machine. The sink overflowed and
everything got drenched. The whole soggy mess was dismal. Despite years 
of socks and suds, I still haven’t managed to appreciate the relationship
between my washing machine and that sink. Digraphs are a bit like my laun-
dry duo (machine and sink). They’re pairs of letters (like ai, oa, and ea) that
work together. This chapter helps you show your child the vowel digraphs in
words like drain, soak, and scream.
Explaining the When-Two-Vowels-Go-
Walking . . . Rule
The first thing you need to tell your child about the rule that I’m giving you
here is that it really is useful. It applies to masses of words and comes with
its own little rhyme. The rule is: When your child’s writing a word with a long-
vowel sound in it, one way to spell that sound is to write two vowels side by
side — usually ee, ea, ai, or oa. If your child wants to make a long-vowel
sound in this manner, he writes the vowel-pair:
 That starts with an e for a long-e sound (either ee or ea)
 That starts with an a for a long-a sound
 That starts with an o for a long-o sound

The rhyme for this two-vowel rule is, “When two vowels go walking, the first
one does the talking (and says its name).”
Hearing Long-Vowel Sounds
Table 8-1 gives you examples of many words that use the four main vowel
pairs. Scan through them with your child. Copy the page and have her high-
light the vowels. Then take her through the “Listening up for long vowels,”
activity.

To be able to properly spell these words, your child must first hear the long-
vowel and recognize the spelling chunks associated with that sound. Kids
who write words like slep, in place of sleep, more than likely do it because
they hear that long-vowel sound but don’t know the corresponding spelling
chunk that makes the long-vowel sound. To make sure that your child not
only the hears the long vowel but also uses the right spelling chunk, run
through the “Listening up for long vowels” activity that follows. If she makes
mistakes, continue doing this activity for a few days. Preparing a new list of
words is easy.
135
Chapter 8: Taking Charge of Words with Two Vowels Together

Activity: Listening up for long vowels
Preparation: Make a copy of this list that follows and grab a pen or pencil.
Follow this step: Read the numbered list of words to your child and have her
circle (or tell you) which word of each set of three is the two-vowel (or long-
vowel) word.
1. kick — cream — cut
2. cheat — chin — chat
3. chop — shop — shoal
4. pain — pant — plant
5. stand — slap — sail
6. seed — send — sell
7. sleep — slip — slim
8. toad — tip — test
9. flick — flat — fleet
10. mast — man — main
11. bent — bead — best
12. road — romp — rest
Sorting Through Long and Short Sounds
After your child begins hearing the vowel sounds, it’s time for him to start
penning those pairs. Grab a whiteboard or poster paper, some bright-colored
markers, and maybe some snacks for the “Four pairs of vowels” activity.
Activity: Four pairs of vowels
Preparation: You not only need your copy of this book (turned to Table 8-1)
but also a timer or a watch to time a ten-minute break. You and your child
probably should spend at least half an hour on this activity, but you can set
your own time limit.
Follow these steps:
1. Have your child write the four main pairs of vowels — ee, ea, ai, and
oa — across the top of the whiteboard or paper in big bright letters.
136
Part III: Getting to Grips with Long Vowel Sounds 

2. Have your child write five words under each pair of letters so that she
has four columns of five words each.
3. Have your child turn the paper or whiteboard over and take a ten-
minute break. Be sure to tell your child that you’re taking the break to
find out whether she can keep those vowel pairs in her memory.
4. After the break, dictate random words from Table 8-1 for your child to
spell on the blank side of the paper or whiteboard. She can draw four
columns again if she wants.
If you prefer, you can dictate the same words that your child already wrote
down.
Whenever your child spells words in the course of her normal writing, she
flits between long and short vowels (and other sounds). The “Changing
between short and long vowels” activity up next mixes long- and short-vowel
words so your child gets quicker and more comfortable using the two.
Activity: Changing between short and long vowels
Preparation: Make a copy of the following list of 14 statements.
Follow this step: Have your child find the misspelled word in each statement
and then write the correct word. She needs to change short vowels to long
vowels and vice versa.
1. Monkeys eet bananas.
2. Plants grow from seds.
3. If I kick you, you fel pain.
4. Orange pel doesn’t taste good.
5. Cars drive on rods.
6. On ice, you must watch your steep.
7. Tomatoes are read.
8. You sleep in your bead.
9. Tods are like frogs.
10. A bunch of naval boats is a flet.
11. Flowers have petals and steams.
12. You play soccer on a tem.
13. Water is wheat.
14. I saw the sick lady fant.
137
Chapter 8: Taking Charge of Words with Two Vowels Together

The next “Five up” activity is a nice change, because you need to throw a 
die to play. Each player must write four- and five-letter words, too, and that
means your child probably will write double-vowel words.
Activity: Five up
Preparation: Grab one die and a shaker plus enough pen and paper for every
player.
Follow these steps:
1. Take turns rolling the die. The first person to roll a one starts play.
2. To start play, the player writes a one-letter word and rolls again. If the
player gets:
A two: H writes a two-letter word and rolls the die again.
A number other that a two: Play shifts to the next player.
Players try to roll a one; then two; then three; then four; and then five, in
order. If a player rolls an unwanted number (like three when a four is
needed) play shifts to the next player.
3. When the play comes back to the first player, he continues where he
left off. On second and subsequent turns, you don’t have to start over
and roll a one again.
Some important parts of the game: Each new word that a player writes must
have at least one letter in it from the previous word. Players who roll sixes
get to roll again. The first player to write five words and then roll a six, wins.
Spelling Long Sounds
Throughout this book, I tell you that your child has to hear sounds inside
words, jot down possible spellings, and then recognize the right one. In the
138
Part III: Getting to Grips with Long Vowel Sounds 
Tall, outdoors type
The other day, when I was stuck in traffic, I
noticed a big yellow crane standing outside a
warehouse that had industrial machinery for
hire. On the crane was a large sign. It read, “Tall,
outdoors type seeks relationship.”
Everyone has relationships. The letters that
make a digraph are in a relationship. One letter
is the extrovert, the other is the silent type, but
it works for them. Tell your child about these
vowel relationships. Explain that whenever he
sees the two together (ee, ea, ai, or oa), they’re
interacting. The first one is the talker (it says its
name), and the second one is quiet.

“Sounds right; looks wrong,” activity that follows, your child must choose the
correct spelling from a group of words that all sound out the right way. Some
words (like mane) are Bossy e words. You can flip to Chapter 7 to brush up
on the Bossy e rule.
Activity: Sounds right; looks wrong
Preparation: Make a copy of the list that follows and have a pen or pencil
ready for your child to use.
Follow these steps:
1. Have your child circle or highlight the right spelling.
2. Ask your child (or tell him) what’s so special about questions 11 and
12 (each has two correct spellings with different meanings).
1. creyp — creep — creap
2. cheat — cheet — chete
3. yeer — yere — year
4. seet — sete — seat
5. loaf — lofe — lowf
6. flote — float — flowt
7. fame — faym — faim
8. speek — speak — speik
9. trayl — trail — trale
10. chain — chane — chaen
11. mane — main — mayn
12. lain — lane — layn
ee and ea Words
The sounds of ee and ea are the same. The best way for your child to get
better at choosing the correct spelling is to spell ee and ea words often. The
next “Pairs of vowels” activity asks your child to choose between ee and ea
spellings. If your child isn’t sure which to choose, have her write out the two
options. If she still isn’t sure which is right, tell her the answer and save the
word to look at again later.

the riddle.
3. Have your child tell you why the words from 13 on are special and
what each word means.

Answers: Stream, scream, teach, speech, weed, year, bleach, weep, dream, feel,
green, cream, beech and beach (a tree and a seashore), cheap and cheep 
(inexpensive and a bird noise), real and reel (not fake and a spool of sorts),

together) steel and steal (metal and taking without permission), week and weak
(seven days and not strong), read and reed (what you do with a book and a
hollow grass), and see and sea (what you do with your eyes and a large body of
water).
A Mix of Long Sounds
For a finale of two-vowel words, I’ve put together the “Two-vowel word quiz.”
Have your child grab a watch or timer and try to answer the questions within
five minutes. Tell your child that you’re not sure whether the quiz is a bit
tricky for him, but maybe he’d like to give it a try just the same.
Your child enjoys a little competition. If you talk up the task, he can feel espe-
cially proud when he succeeds at it.
Activity: Two-vowel word quiz
Preparation: Grab some paper, a pen, and make a copy of the questions that
follow.
Follow this step: Leave your child to it! The only instruction is that your
child needs to answer these riddles by writing write single-word answers.
1. Begins with the same four letters as please. Means to beg.
2. An animal. Rhymes with coat.
3. This is in your skull. It controls all that you do.
4. The letters and flyers that are delivered to you.
5. A small stream. Starts with the third letter in the alphabet.
6. You do this in your sleep. Starts with the same letter as dog.
7. You sail in this. Rhymes with oat.
8. This animal moves very slowly.
9. This kind of vehicle runs on tracks.
10. A juicy fruit. Rhymes with teach.
Answers: Plead, goat, brain, mail, creek, dream, boat, snail, train, and peach.

Chapter 8: Taking Charge of Words with Two Vowels Together

Whew! Time for some comic relief. Tell your child this joke and be sure to
cajole him into saying that it’s very funny. (My kids are so ungracious about
my roaringly funny jokes!):
While out shopping, a tortoise has her bag stolen by a snail. A police offi-
cer asks her whether she saw the assailant. “Sorry.” she says, “It all hap-
pened so fast!”
Copy-Cat Vowels
Some spelling chunks are simple. They always look and sound the same.
Others take a bit more getting to know. After your child grows completely
comfortable with the ee, ea, ai and oa spelling chunks, you can show her
spellings that either look the same as those chunks but sound different or
sound the same as those chunks but look different. After you get going, you’ll
see that it isn’t as hard as it sounds (or looks).
When I talk about spelling chunks or spelling units, I’m talking about the
spelling bits that make up words. They can be syllables (like the two syllables
in al-most) or blends (like the str in strong) or digraphs (like ee, ea, ai, and oa).
i before e
The three most common ways for your child to spell the ee sounds are
 ee as in: cheer, heel, weed, peer, sneer, sheer, seem, feet, and seed.
 ea as in: hear, teach, fear, team, year, dear, weak, clear, near, read, plead,
and stream.
 e_e (read e blank e) as in: here, severe, adhere, hemisphere, interfere,
mere, sphere, sincere, these, atmosphere, stratosphere, scene, and Pete.
(I talk about this Bossy e spelling in Chapter 7.)
In words like please, breeze, and cheese, your child uses the ea or ee, and e_e
spellings.
Spellings like meet and meat use the when-two-vowels-go-walking-the-first-
one-does-the-talking rule, and spellings like Pete use the Bossy-e rule. A
fourth way for your child to spell the same sound is with ie, remembered
with the rhythm; “i before e except after c.” Table 8-2 gives you heaps of ie
words. Have your child piece them together, believe in them, and shriek if he
142
Part III: Getting to Grips with Long Vowel Sounds 

likes. Next up I give you the “Spelling buddies activity,” a simple looking-and-
writing activity that goes with Table 8-2 so your child can take a careful look
at how the words are pieced together.

A spelling mnemonic, or memory jogger, that kids like to use for friend is “A

Activity: Spelling buddies
Preparation: Open your copy of Teaching Kids to Spell For Dummies to Table
8-2, and have a pen and piece of paper ready for both you and your child.
Follow these steps:
1. Together with your child, write out the words from Table 8-2.
2. Point out the features of each word so your child remembers them
better.
Let your child do the talking but add your five cents worth whenever
you see something that she misses. Here’s how your dialogue may go for
piece and diesel.
• For piece: “Here’s the ie part, and ce goes on the end to make the s
sound.”
• For diesel: “There’s an s in this word to make the z sound. The
ending is “el” (not al or le).
143
Chapter 8: Taking Charge of Words with Two Vowels Together

With “diesel” the s can make either a z or an s sound depending on your
dialect.
Except after c
The words in Table 8-2 use the i-before-e-except-after-c rule. You probably
learned this rule when you were a kid and still use it today. Table 8-3 shows
words that make use of this really useful rule, but happen to fall under the
except-after-c part of the rule. Do the “Spelling buddies” activity, using the
Table 8-3 words and then dictate a few for your child to spell. Repeat the
same routine with all the tables in this chapter and take a lot of fun breaks.
The nearby “Moving, throwing, and banging” sidebar isn’t a bunch of house-
moving horror stories, but it is a description of neat games you can easily fit
in between your spelling sessions.
Table 8-3
i Before e Except After c
receive
ceiling
receipt
deceit
conceive
conceit
deceive
Words that follow the when-two-vowels-go-walking rule rather than the i-
before-e rule are tie, pie, lie, and die. All have the long-i sound (that you
expect with the when-two-vowels-go-walking rule), rather than the long-e
sound that you hear in words that adhere to the i-before-e-except-after-c rule.
Eight neighbors
After your coming to grips with the i-before-e-except-after-c rhyme and
cadence and how it works, you’ll want to show your child a last addition to
the rhyme:
i before e except after c, except when you hear “ay” like in neighbor
The part about when you hear long-a helps your child spell words like eight,
weigh, and neighbor. Table 8-4 gives you these ay-sounding words.
Table 8-4
Words like Neighbor and Eight
neighbor
eight
reins
reign 
vein
weigh 
144
Part III: Getting to Grips with Long Vowel Sounds 

weight
freight 
beige 
sleigh
e before i
Earlier in this chapter, I said that I’d introduce you to some words that take 
a bit of getting to know. Well here’s the pick of the bunch. Table 8-5 gives you
a group of words that has the ee sound spelled as ei. It reverses the usual i-
before-e rule. Your child must watch out for this weird bunch of words so
have him read through Table 8-5 and home in on the vowels.
Table 8-5
ei Words
seize
weird
neither
either 
leisure
caffeine
A handful of words have their own unique sound for ei and ie. The group that
you’re on your guard for here is: foreign, their, forfeit, soldier, height, and view.
Oh my gosh, these e’s and i’s can get confusing! I’ve given you the rules (and
the words that are outcasts from the rules!), because they’re handy to know.
But remember that it’s easier just to forget the rules and simply give your
child plenty of practice at writing out the words. Writing out words more
often enables your child to get better at jotting down his options (is it soldier
or soldeir?) and spotting the right one.
If your child is grappling with whether to write ie or ei, his best bet is to opt
for ie, because it’s more common.
These games give your child a physical and mental break between bouts of
spelling. You can do any activity to give your child that break, but don’t
forget to do something. Your child’s attention span for serious concentration
is only about 20 minutes (and yours is just about the same).
Dreadful bread
You’re past the tricky part! The next words that I give to you won’t require
any cerebral gymnastics, and none of these words are isolated words either,
so that makes the going much easier. Your child gets to spell word families,
and that’s always a plus for helping her remember the spellings.
145
Chapter 8: Taking Charge of Words with Two Vowels Together

This word family uses the ea spelling chunk to make the short-e sound (like
in bed). Some common words in this bunch are dead, head, and bread. Table
8-6 shows the rest of the family.

Part III: Getting to Grips with Long Vowel Sounds 
Moving, throwing, and banging
When my kids were little, I read them stories by
Enid Blyton. One of the stories featured a fear-
some character called Dame Slap-A-Lot. You
can guess what Dame Slap-A-Lot did to kids who
didn’t use their manners or show her respect.
After that story, I often chased my kids around
the house slapping my hands together menac-
ingly and declaring myself to be Dame Slap-A-
Lot. I miss Dame Slap-A-Lot. Anyway, you may
be wondering where the activities have gone
and why I’m waxing nostalgic about Dame Slap-
A-Lot. The thing is, I don’t give you a lot of
spelling activities in this chapter, because the
best way you can help your child remember
these fairly hard spellings is to have him look
closely at them and write them down several
times. That’s the number one thing to do, and dic-
tating ten words for your child to spell every night
is a great idea, too. But where’s the fun in that
(and there’s still no explanation for Dame Slap-
A-Lot)? Ah ha. I don’t give you a lot of spelling
activities in this chapter, but I do provide you with
games you can play with your child between
bouts of spelling. And I get around to Dame-Slap-
A-Lot right now: Here are two games that will
cast you in the role of Dame Play-A-Lot, who is
much more socially acceptable, but not half as
much fun, as good old Dame Slap-A-Lot. Don’t
forget to include game breaks, because they can
make the difference between your child perse-
vering with spelling exercises, or not.
Beanbag toss
You can set up this throwing game at a
moment’s notice. Use a cardboard box as the
receptacle for your tosses and set a starting line
for each participant. Throw objects into the box
and see who gets the biggest number of hits.
Play three rounds, throwing things like coins,
plastic eggs (left over from Easter), or socks
stuffed with rice. If you want to get really fancy,
you can buy actual beanbags (or use beans in
place of rice). If this game sounds pedestrian,
wait until you’re evenly matched with your
child! You’ll get revved up and demand any
number of bonus rounds and replays. It depends
on how poor of a sport you are.
Bang!
An easy clapping game that girls in particular
love, Bang is a game I play with my daughters
to fill times when we have to wait someplace.
We usually end up showing other entranced
girls how to play. Standing and facing each
other, each player claps four claps at the same
time to begin. Now (together) do two quick
claps (these two immediately follow your initial
four claps, making a total of six beginning claps)
and then choose from one of these hand actions
(similar to the game “Paper, rock, scissors”).
 Point both thumbs up
 Point both thumbs down
 Point both thumbs to your left
 Point both thumbs to your right
If you each chose a different action, keep going
with two claps and then an action. Whenever
both players choose the same action, point your
forefingers at your opponent and shout,
“Bang!” like a gun. You’re trying to be quickest
on the draw, the first to shout “Bang!” Keep
going and get faster!

It just so happens that in this bunch of words are a few homographs — words
that have two meanings for the same spelling. Read is a homograph (you 
can have “I will read” or “I read it yesterday”) and so is lead (you can have
the kind that’s heavy and the lead-role-in-a-play kind). Oh, and breath is a
word that isn’t to be confused with breathe and weather isn’t the same thing
as whether or wether — baah! Did I say there’d be no cerebral gymnastics
involved with this table? Maybe I should’ve allowed for the odd somersault!

complete word air. Table 8-7 shows you the ever-so-easy air family

When your child wants to write air, he probably jots it down with ease. Many
words have air in them, so he’s familiar with that spelling. However, you can
spell the same sound in other ways. The most common alternative to air is
are. Table 8-8 gives you some are words, and after that, I show you two more
options, ear, like in bear, and aer, like in aerosol.

Teachers have things to smile about
You’re nearly halfway through this book. You’ve
spelled many words with your child, and you’ve
put many activities under both of your belts.
You’re doing a good job. You deserve some
teacher perks. Now what in the world can I give
you in this simple book that qualifies as a
teacher perk? Read the rest of this sidebar and
you’ll see. One benefit of teaching is that kids
give you plenty of stuff to smile about.
Kids’ Letters to God:
Dear God . . . 
On Halloween I am going to wear a devil’s
costume, is that all right with you?
Is it true my father won’t get into Heaven if
he uses his bowling words in the house?
Did they really talk that fancy in Bible times?
Is Reverend Coe a friend of yours or do you
just know him through the business?
I know all about where babies come from. I
think. From inside mommies, and daddies
put them there. Where are they before that?
Do you have them in Heaven? How do they
get down here? Do you have to take care of
them all first? Please answer all my ques-
tions. I always think of you.
Please put another holiday between Christ-
mas and Easter. There is nothing good in
there now.
Why is Sunday school on Sunday? I thought
it was supposed to be our day of rest.
I keep waiting for spring but it never comes
yet. Please don’t forget.
If you watch in church on Sunday, I will
show you my new shoes.
We read Thomas Edison made light. But in
Sunday school, they said you did it. So, I bet
he stole your idea.

In This Chapter

W
ithout a shopping list, I may as well not go to the grocery store.
Without one, there’s simply no way that I’ll manage to take back the
library books en route, have my coffee in hand and my sunglasses propped
on my head, mail my letters, pay my bills (at the ATM) and still remember to
pick up whatever it was that prompted me to set off in the first place. Your
child, however, isn’t so memory challenged (or busy!). The very idea of
telling her about the many faces of y may tire you, but she’ll get the hang of it
in a flash and have energy left over. She’ll spell words like cylinder and mys-
tery in no time at all (and still remember to sneak ten feet of bubble gum into
your shopping cart and argue about who steers).
Getting Used to the Different Sounds of y
People call y things like the “other vowel,” the “pretend vowel,” and the
“almost vowel.” When your child spells words like yellow and yam, he hears
the straightforward y sound that he learned when he was first introduced to
letters. When he spells words like play, happy, cry, and system, things are a bit
different; he hears a vowel sound but writes a y. This chapter leads you
through the four “other vowel” uses of y.
Hearing It; Spelling It
Hear it; spell it. That’s what spelling’s basically all about. Your child hears a
word in her head, breaks it into chunks of sound, and if she’s lucky, remem-
bers exactly how to write those chunks of sound. Mostly she tries out a few

ways before she gets it right. Some chunks are easy. She only ever writes the
ch sound as ch, she only ever writes the “tuh” sound as t, and with blends like
str and cl, what she hears is what she gets. Other chunks are more difficult.
Vowel sounds are always tricky, Your child can write the same vowel sound 
in a few different ways. The way that I talk about in this chapter is the y way.
When your child hears the long-a sound in words like play, she spells it as 
ay; when she hears long-e on the end of a word like silly, she spells it with a y;
when she hears a long-i sound on the end of a small word like by, she spells 
it with a y. and when she hears a short-i sound in the middle of a word like
system, she uses a y there, too.
y Sounding Like Long a 
(day, say, and play)
The “ay” family is a cinch. Your child sees ay words all the time, and the sound-
to-spelling step is a straightforward one. He’ll whiz quickly through the words
in Table 9-1. Have him read the words to you, dictate a few for him to spell, and
then zip ahead to Table 9-2.

y Sounding Like Long e (happy, 
funny, and silly)
Okay, it’s this simple: When your child hears “ee” on the end of words of two
syllables or more, she jots down a y. The y makes the “ee” sound. In Table 9-2,
I give phonetically regular words for your child to warm up on. Have her cast
her eyes over them and then move forward with the activities that follow.
152
Part III: Getting to Grips with Long Vowel Sounds 

Phonetically regular words are words that your child spells just the way they
sound. He doesn’t have to play with spelling options, because what he hears
is what he gets. All the words in Table 9-2 have simple short-vowel sounds,
and the only spelling feature that deviates from the rule is double consonants
(in words like bunny and cherry).

153
Chapter 9: Writing y Instead of a, e, or i

Activity: Half and half
Preparation: Have a copy of Table 9-2 and paper and pencil.
Follow these steps (suggested dialog is in quotations):
1. Give your child these instructions: “Find all the words that have a
double letter.”
2. Say, “Draw a line down between the double letters so that you split
each word into two parts.”
3. Say, “Give me your sheet so I can read you the first part of each word.
See if you can write the whole words from hearing just the first parts.”
If all words were made of regular short-vowel sounds, spelling would be a
pretty dull business (and this would be a slim book). But spelling takes some
strategizing. When your child spells, he’ll have stretched-out sounds to figure
out and, at times, some downright strange spellings to get comfortable with.
Table 9-3 leads your child through words that have y on the end and tricky
(but not too tricky) spelling features. I’ve underlined the spelling chunks that
your child needs to watch out for. Have him read through the words, check-
ing out the underlined parts, and then move on to the activity.

Preparation: Open Teaching Kids to Spell For Dummies to Table 9-3.
Follow these steps:
1. Ask your child to read through the words and look at the underlined
parts. 
2. Have her write groups of words in the groups I give, looking at the
numbers in parenthesis to see exactly how many words to find. Do
this activity as a partnership so you make sure that your child succeeds.
The groups include
154
Part III: Getting to Grips with Long Vowel Sounds 

• Long-a sound (3) (Answer: baby, lady, crazy)
• Long-e sound (2) (Answer: creepy, weary)
• Long-i sound (1) (Answer: tiny)
• Long-o sound (1) (Answer: pony)
• ar words (1) (Answer: party)
• ir and er words (3) (Answer: dirty, property, thirsty)
• ou words (1) (Answer: cloudy)
• cy words (1) (Answer: fancy)
• Leftover easy words (1) (Answer: nasty)
• Leftover hard words (4) (Answer: pretty, enemy, many, worry)
For the last two questions your child makes his own decision as to which
word is easy and which four words are hard. It’s fine to arrive at different
answers to the ones I give.
Many of the words that your child finishes off with a y have the -try or -ly
spelling chunks (endings). Table 9-4 gives you a bunch of challenging -try
and -ly words. Look over the words, and then take your child through the 
two activities that follow. The first one is a look-and-spell drill, the second,
because you both deserve it, is pure fun.

Chapter 9: Writing y Instead of a, e, or i

It’s okay for your child to add -ly onto words that already end with l (like gen-
eral) and hence have a word that has two l’s (generally). Words that end with
-ful are the same. Although full gets shortened to -ful on the ends of words like
graceful and helpful, your child uses two l’s again in words like gracefully and
helpfully. Okay?
Activity: See it, say it, spell it
Preparation: Open this book to Table 9-4 and have paper and pen ready.
Follow these steps: 
1. Take a look at Table 9-4 together, noting the underlined spelling fea-
tures (the underline means something tricky is going on). If he wants
to, have your child say the words out loud and comment on the spelling. 
2. Have him jot down any words he thinks are especially prickly. 
3. Have him write a column of numbers from 1 to 20. Dictate random
spellings. If he spells word one correctly, he crosses off number two
(because he won that space). Dictate a random spelling for number 3. 
4. Have your child keep crossing off bonus numbers for correct spelling,
but he must add a number to his list for incorrect spellings. If he
makes no spelling errors, he ends up having spelled ten words.
The next activity is one of my favorites. It’s fun, and if you have other kids
wandering by, they’ll want to offer their spelling suggestions. Your child spells
words to get points, and because long words earn her more points, she’ll want
to collaborate and brainstorm with you or with siblings or friends to spell
words like constitutional. Players compete for points, but even so, you play
this game just for the happy interaction.
Activity: Toothpicks
In this activity, I ask you and your child to shake toothpicks (or golf tees) in a
paper bag. Shake them well so that they lay flat; otherwise, you can end up
with a pricked finger or even a splinter. Ouch!
Preparation: You need a package of colored toothpicks (or cocktail sticks)
and a brown lunch bag. On plain paper write “Toothpicks.” Have pen and
paper for each player.
Follow these steps:
1. In the bag put ten yellow, ten blue, and five red toothpicks. 
2. Take turns picking a toothpick without looking in the bag as your
opponent holds the bag, and vice versa. 
156
Part III: Getting to Grips with Long Vowel Sounds 

• If you choose a yellow toothpick, you score nothing, and it’s your
opponent’s turn. 
• If you choose a blue toothpick, you write a word beginning with
the first t in “toothpick.” Each time you get to write a word, you go
through the letters in “toothpick” in order crossing each letter off
after it’s been used. You score points for your word, according to
the number of letters in the word (five letters equals five points)
you write. 
• If you choose a red toothpick you score five points (and don’t have
to write anything) and play goes to your opponent. 
3. Continue taking toothpicks and spelling the longest words you can,
until all the toothpicks are gone or all the blue and red toothpicks are
used. 
Highest score wins.
This game doesn’t have to be called “Toothpicks.” Use any word that you
want, but make sure that you have the same number of blue toothpicks as
the number of letters in your chosen word. If you have marbles or buttons or
other items that can be used rather than toothpicks, simply make the game
fit your resources. Oh and by the way you can choose your own colors (in
case you think it’s unfair that I left out all the green toothpicks). You can also
use markers on plain wood toothpicks.
Activity: Coffee for the jockey and me
Preparation: Open this book to Table 9-5.
Follow this step: Did you spot it? Three “ee” sounds are in the name of this
activity, and not one of them is spelled with just y. You may think that you
had the whole “ee” thing covered by now. Well you have, almost. Your child
spells the ending “ee” sound with a y most of the time. But sometimes she
uses e, ee, or ey. Table 9-5 gives you a few examples to run through so your
child remains unruffled when dealing with trees or turkeys or any other “ee”
sound at the end of words where y isn’t featured. When you’re ready, have
your child try to spot and circle the correct spellings in this list.
1. agre — agree — agrey
2. mone — monee — money
3. coffe — coffee — coffey
4. me — mee — mey
5. se — see — sey

y Sounding Like Long i 
(my, by, and cry)
This spelling rule is just about as easy as it gets. Your child hears words like
my, by, and cry and spells the long-i part on the end with a y. The only thing
he really has to think about is whether he’s dealing with a y spelling or
another way of spelling that sound, as in the words sigh and lie. Table 9-6
shows short words like my, Table 9-7 has longer words like supply, and to give
your child a challenge, Table 9-8 shows tricky words like cycle in which y fits
in the middle. Look over the tables with your child, and then scoot to the
activity that follows each one.

The words in Table 9-6 are pretty easy. After your child reads them to you,
you may simply want to dictate a few for her to spell. Alternatively, you may
want to stretch your legs. You can play the License plates game by grabbing a
notepad and pen (and by the way, your child) and walking or driving slowly
around the block. If you drive, you need to take at least two kids with you,
because it isn’t safe for you to drive and play at the same time. Okay?
Activity: License plates
Preparation: You need a notepad and pencil for each player.
Follow these steps:
1. On the notepads, draw spaces for ten three-letter words. 
2. For each word, draw three squares, one for each letter of the word
you’re going to write there. 
3. Each player fills in three end squares with a y so that she has to write
a word ending with y there. 
4. Players take turns calling out three letters from a license plate. 
5. Each player writes all three letters in any space on her pad and then
tries to make words. 
The first player to make five words wins, or the player with the most words
when the pads are filled wins. It’s your choice.
You can adapt License Plates in a few ways: 
 Play without filling in the y’s. 
 Make your words four- or five-letters long so your child must spell
blends and long-vowel sounds. 
 Fill in other letters before you start, like ee or ea.
159
Chapter 9: Writing y Instead of a, e, or i

 If the license plates in your state use mostly numbers give your child
free letters or whole endings like ean, eat, ey, and ash that he can add
onto with the few letters that he spots.
After your child gets the idea of words like my, shy, and cry, longer words
with the same long-i endings don’t seem so weird. Have her read through 
the words in Table 9-7 and take down a mental (or paper) note of the harder
words. My choice of hard words includes qualify, unify, and beautify, but your
child may have others in mind. When she’s ready for you to run some words
past her, head to the “Finishing words” activity.

Activity: Finishing words
Preparation: Open Teaching Kids To Spell For Dummies to Table 9-7 and have
pen and paper ready.
Follow these steps: 
1. Spell the first part of each word to your child.
2. Have her guess what the word is and finish spelling it. 
Give clues if you need to, but if the odd word’s too hard to guess, simply tell
your child that word so she can get on with the spelling.
In Chapter 16, I talk about adding endings like -er and -ing to words, but you
may want a quick preview about words that end with y. When your child adds
endings to words that end with y, this spelling rule can help her. She changes
y to i when adding any ending, except -ing. You can see this rule at work in
words like occupied, occupies, and occupying
In Table 9-8, I give you some pretty tricky words. The best thing for your child
to do with long or scary-looking words is to break them into manageable
pieces. I talk about breaking words into syllables in Chapter 15, but for now
160
Part III: Getting to Grips with Long Vowel Sounds 

you just need to help your child chop up the words in Table 9-8 and highlight
the y masquerading as i. The “Marking up words” activity takes you and your
child step by step through this marking and chopping-up process.

Activity: Marking up words
Preparation: Make a copy of Table 9-8, and be ready with highlighter pens.
Follow these steps: 
1. Ask your child to highlight the y that’s making the long-i sound in
each word.
2. Ask him to break every word into parts, or syllables, putting the
breaks where he thinks they need to go. 
3. Ask him to underline, circle, or mark (with a new color), any special
spelling features, such as the soft g and ie in hygiene or the silent p in
psychology. Some words have many marks on them, because they’re
hard. 
4. Have your child grade (or number) the five hardest words, from one
to five, with one being the hardest word. Can he spell them all back to
you without looking at the table again?
When your child identifies hard bits inside a word, it helps her recall the
whole spelling later. Anytime she comes across tricky words, help her break
them up and mark the hard bits (it’s fun to call them “putrid parts” or “barfy
bits,” or any other vile term that helps your child remember).

y Sounding Like Short i 
(Mystery and System)
Here’s the last vowel sound that your child will write with a y — short i. In
words like crypt and cylinder, and in plenty more words, too, she’ll jot down 
a conspicuous y. To get friendly with this kind of word, she needs to get into
a marking and chopping-up mode. If she examines each word in Table 9-9,
breaks it up, and then jots it down again, she soon gains a feel for smooth-
flowing spelling. Help her mark and chop the words, and then dictate a few of
them for her to write from scratch. After all that, present your child with the
quiz that I give you next.

Chapter 9: Writing y Instead of a, e, or i
Shiny and pricey
Strange things happen with the spell-checker
on my computer, especially when I type in
words like “shiney” and “shiny” and “pricey”
and “pricy.” I’m allowed to keep both “pricey”
and “pricy,” they’re both acceptable spellings,
but I can’t have “shiney.” Hmm. How about
“lacey” and “lacy”? My computer hasn’t shown
me a red squiggly line, so I can keep both of
them. How then should you give your child the
scoop on spelling words like shiny, pricey and
pricy, and lacey and lacy? Tell him two things:
1. When you add a y ending to a word that ends
with e (shine, for example), drop the e and
you’ll most likely be right — in other words,
shiny. You can spell some words either way
(pricey pricy; boney bony; nosey nosy; and
whiney whiny) but the y-only way (not the ey
way) is the most common.
2. Whenever you’re not sure of a spelling, any
spelling, try out your options. Write down the
possibilities and go for the one that looks best.
(Or, type it and use your spell-checker or
better still a (much more reliable) dictionary!).
The following table shows a bunch of words that
your child just chops the e off of and adds y onto
to make nice adjectives (describing words).

on’t you just hate spelling books that give lofty, long-
winded accounts of a few hundred rules and a few
(hundred) more exceptions? They talk about things like
“unaccented sounds” and advise you to do all kinds of
nasal gymnastics. Well, if you’ve ever felt suffocated by
that sort of stuff, here’s a breath of fresh air. This part of
Teaching Your Kids to Spell For Dummies tells you all about
word families and sight words and silent and soft letters in
simple terms. I explain everything in down-to-earth, practi-
cal tones and give you so many tips and words to spell
that your child need never, or almost never, go wrong.

I
just spent my first winter in a place that gets plenty of snow. I did pretty
well with boots and gloves and gravel and salt but had a shaky start with
clearing snow from my front path. In fact, it was my husband’s fault. He had
the bright idea that we could buy a garden shovel for use with both winter
snow and summer soil and hence save a hefty five or so dollars on a proper
snow shovel (only wimps need them anyway). Each morning I shoveled.
When I could barely lift my arms and needed help turning my head, I bought
a snow shovel. The spelling information that I provide in this chapter is like
I’m handing you a snow shovel (readers in hot climates may need to visual-
ize). I introduce you to the idea of teaching your child not one word at a time
(that’s the garden shovel way) but whole families (ta-da; the snow shovel!).
Looking at What’s in a Word
Your child must hear words in his mind, and then write them in chunks of
sound to be able to spell words. The more practice he gets at writing chunks
of sound, the better he gets at spelling. After he can spell bank, for example,
he can easily spell thank, sank, and drank. These words form the ank word
family.
When spellings don’t match sounds in the usual way (like in the word who —
which you’d expect to be “hoo”), your child has to recall the visual pattern 
of the word. He has to say the word in his mind, recall that it’s spelled in a
strange way, and then jot down his options. After all that, his visual memory
must kick in so that he recognizes the correct spelling from the possibilities
that he thinks about. I talk more about unusual words like who in Chapter 12.

Introducing Word Families
Word families are groups of similar words. Each word in the family has the
same chunk of sound in it, spelled the same way. When your child is comfort-
able with word families, she builds a bigger repertoire of spellings than she’d
otherwise have if she tried to remember every isolated individual spelling.
There are an awful lot of word families. Words like at, bat, and cat are part of a
family and so are words like pretentious, infectious, and conscientious! This
chapter gets you and your child started on the easier families, the ones that
are spelled in a phonetically regular way (meaning they sound out easily)
with short vowel sounds.
The spelling chunks (like at, ank and ick) that I introduce you to in this chap-
ter have a technical name. They’re called phonograms. Many books give you
word lists of phonograms, and to convince you of how common the phono-
grams are, they offer impressive statistics. They tell you things like 20 phono-
grams appear in a zillion cool words.
Getting Friendly with Simple Families
The tables in this chapter are chock-full of straightforward, one-syllable
words, but here and there you come across a soft or silent letter. You can flip
to Chapter 14 to brush up on soft letters, and Chapter 13 gives you the low-
down on silent letters. You see blends like sn and spl here too and the conso-
nant digraphs (two letters making one new sound) ch, sh, and wh. To delve
deeper into blends you can turn to Chapter 5 and for more on consonant
digraphs you can skip to Chapter 6.
168
Part IV: Using Word Families 
Exploring what’s with wh
Every time I call wh a consonant digraph, I flinch.
You see, most spelling books call wh a digraph,
so I feel obliged to let you to know that. But (and
this is a fairly big but), I personally don’t think that
wh counts as a digraph at all. A digraph is a new
sound made by two letters, like ch, sh, and th. I
simply don’t believe that anyone (except perhaps
flaky time travelers who lurch into the present
from ye olde tymes without first having swatted-
up on the local tongue) says wh any differently
than they say w. That being so, it’s my contention
that wh just doesn’t cut it as a digraph. I hope that
I haven’t completely confused, not to mention
bored you with this sidebar, but the wh digraph
thing grates with me. I’m quite done now, though,
it’s out and I can get on with my life again.

A smorgasbord of spellings is in front of you in the seven upcoming tables
and you’ll want your child to spell words from each of them. Even if you con-
sider the words in these tables easy, making sure that your child can spell
them is a good idea, because big words are made by the joining up of little

Chapter 10: Getting Into Word Family Mode
Wondering about words of Winkdom?
On my gosh! How much fun can one person
stand? I just discovered the North American
Tiddlywinks Association. I’m in a happy daze.
Were you aware that in the United Kingdom
there is an English Tiddlywinks Association and
a tiddlywinks society at each of the la-di-da uni-
versities, Oxford and Cambridge? Hmm, I bet you
weren’t. Neither was I. But now I am and what’s
more, I’ve learned some words that I’m ranking
way up there among my absolute favorites. Who,
for heavens sake, wouldn’t fall in love with tid-
dlywinks terms like squidger, squopping, and
boondocking? Do yourself a favor and log on to
the Internet at home or race to the library and
kick off any users whose intentions are less seri-
ous than your own (being polite about it, of
course), and go to www.tiddlywinks.org.
Ball and Jacks
You need to buy the stuff for this game but it costs
hardly anything. Avid players tell me that metal
jacks are best. Jacks are little three dimensional
stars, and the ball is a little one that fits easily into
your hand. To play, you throw the jacks on to the
playing surface; then bounce the ball, and before
catching it, pick up the jacks. True of all these
games, you have to spend quite a bit of time get-
ting familiar with the moves before you gain an
affection or knack for playing it.
Marbles
Marbles can be played in a few different ways.
The best way to get started is probably to ask a
dad or granddad to demonstrate. If neither is
available, nor ever got recruited into the marble
mob as a kid, you can get information from the
Web site mentioned in the introduction to this
sidebar.
Chinese jump-rope
This game is easy to set up but tricky to explain.
You need three players. Two of them serve
simply as human stands whose job is to stand
facing each other with their legs at hip’s width
apart and a loop of elastic stretched around
them both at their ankles. The third player jumps
on and off the elastic, doing tricks of increasing
difficulty. When the jumper makes a mistake,
she takes over from one of the stands. Entire
books have been written about this game, but
you can get plenty of ideas from the Games Kids
Play Web site.
Hula-Hoop
A girl in my daughter’s class can hula hoop for 19
minutes. She can hula in the usual midriff posi-
tion and on her arms, legs, and neck, too. She
sounds pretty elastic to me, but then I’m a three-
minute hula hooper at best. Hula hooping is
keeping a plastic hoop, about three feet in diam-
eter, twirling around your waist by gyrating your
hips. After you buy a Hula-Hoop, you can use it
for a few different games. Throw it over bottles
and boxes; buy some doweling and run around
the garden doing the hoop and stick thing you
see kids doing in museum videos; sit in the hoop
and tell your kids you’re in quarantine so they
need to keep their distance for an hour or two.
And now, I’m off to assuage my mother-who-lets-
her-kids-vegetate-in-front-of-the-TV guilt by
offering myself up for a strenuous game of
Tiddlywinks. (I’d opt for the jump-rope, but I need
full use of my legs tomorrow).

words or spelling chunks like the one in these tables. How can you stop your
child from thinking it’s all too easy? My solution is to give you a spelling
folder in this chapter. Your child can use the folder with words from this or
any other chapter. Whenever you’re both ready for a change from the
spelling folder, you can play games, such as card games like Go Fish, board
games like Connect Four or Chutes and Ladders, and throwing games, like
launching balls into a hoop, dropping beans into a bottle, or tossing plastic
eggs into a box.
Introducing the Spelling Folder
The spelling folder that I introduce you to now is dear to me. I own several
dog-eared folders, some of which are adorned with photos of the kids to
which they once belonged. The word folder is a neat way to keep track of
your child’s spellings and get him to practice for a short time each day.
Activity: Spelling folder
Preparation: Pick up one manila folder, some sticky tape, scissors, and some
poster paper or thin cardboard (old birthday cards work well). Stickers and
colored markers are optional extras.
Follow these steps:
1. On the front cover of the folder, have your child write “Spelling.”
2. On the inside left cover, have her tape a large pocket and write on it,
“Done”. She makes the pocket by laying down a birthday card (about 6
inches wide and 4 inches high) and taping down three sides of it, leaving
the top open.
3. On the inside right cover, she needs to make six small pockets in two
columns of three. She numbers them 1 to 6 with the bottom left pocket
being number 1, the bottom right pocket being 2, middle left 3, middle
right 4, top left 5 and top right 6. These pockets are sort of a ladder that
your child moves his words (written on small pieces of paper) up. She
plays spelling folder games (which I describe next) with ten words, and
then puts them into pocket 1. Later she takes out the words, plays the
games again and then puts them in pocket 2. Later still (maybe the next
day) she takes the same words out, plays the games with them and puts
them in pocket 3 and so on until all the words have been in all six pocket
s and are done. The big “Done” pocket is the final resting place for your
child’s words after they’ve moved through the six small pockets).
4. When your child makes the folder, she can decorate it. Give her com-
plete charge of the folder, scribbling and drawing on it exactly as she
likes. 
170
Part IV: Using Word Families 

5. When she’s done creating her folder, have her find ten words to use
with it. Find the words from any of the tables in this chapter or from
other chapters. Among those words will be some that she can’t yet spell
(you’ll know from examining the words with her and giving her dicta-
tions). Have her write each of the ten words on a small bus-ticket sized
piece of paper. 
6. Do spelling-folder games with the ten words. The games are as follows:
• First spell: Have your child bring her folder to you. She hands you
the words and you call them out for her to write.
• Random mix spell: She takes the words, spreads them outface-
down and mixes them up. She then hands you one word at a time,
without looking. You call out the word, and she writes it down.
• From the deck spell: She stacks the words in a facedown deck. You
take words from the top of the stack, calling out each of them. She
writes them.
• From the hand spell: You hold the words like a hand of cards. She
pulls words out without looking, and you tell her what she took.
She writes the words.
7. After completing these four spelling games your child has definitely
had good spelling practice. She puts her words into pocket 1 to be used
again the next day. Follow this routine every night for a week, and then
put the words you’ve used into the big “Done” pocket, and get ten new
words. Try a total of about ten weeks of this activity and then give the
spelling folder a break or permanent retirement. 
The spelling folder gives your child an intensive, but fun, blast at tricky
spellings. To be sure that your child doesn’t get through the six pockets only
to forget his spellings later on, ask him every now and then to spell a couple
of words from the “Done” pocket.
Sailing Through One-Syllable 
Word Families
You and your child can zip through the one-syllable word family tables 
(10-1 through 10-7) with relative ease. They’ll take you to the section about
schwas, where things get meaty. Have your child read the words in the tables
and spell a few that you dictate. Pop some of them into the spelling folder 
to practice through the week. When you decide that your child has a good
handle on these words, use the spelling folder with words from any other
table in this book. And, of course, play the regular nonspelling games when-
ever you and your child are feeling perky or in need of a change of pace
before you settle back down to spelling.

Spelling chunks like ell and ill are common. When your child writes a single-
syllable word ending with l, f, or s, he nearly always needs to double that last
letter. You can see this double-letter rule at work in words like hill, bell, doll,
huff, and hiss.

Taking tips from Dr. Seuss
A few lines back, I said that I’d only give you the
spelling folder activity in this chapter. Well I
started off with that in mind, but then other
things, specifically Dr. Seuss-type things, crept
into the picture, too. If you have a young child,
you’ll find that the Dr. Seuss books Hop on Pop-
Up and The Cat in the Hat fit perfectly with
showing him simple word families. In Dr. Seuss
style, you and your child can compose your own
poetry made from simple word families. Here
are some fill-in-the-gaps poems to start you off:

Taking the Stress Out of Schwas 
You’ve probably read this title and thought, “What in the world is a schwa?”
Well a schwa is a pompous sort of a word for a vague sort of a thing. So you
see there’s nothing for you to worry about! Know that a schwa is a vowel. The
word “schwa” is the name given to vowels that make a sort of indistinct “uh”
sound that you barely pronounce. To get the feel of what the indistinct sound
of a schwa is, say these words to yourself, with normal pronunciation, and
listen for that lazy “uh” last sound: doctor, teacher, and collar. Now say again
and around, and listen for the first sound. Do you hear that “uh” sound again?
You do? Great! That sound is a schwa.
The schwa sound “uh” can be spelled and indicated by any of the five vowels.
Whenever your child writes a schwa, it will be in the unstressed part of a
word. Table 10-8 shows you a bunch of words that have schwas in them.
You’ll notice that the schwa u isn’t a big deal, because your child hears and
writes short u (“uh”), but when he hears “uh” in a word like agree, he has to
remember that this particular “uh” is spelled with an a. After Table 10-8, I talk
about ways to tackle the spelling of “uh.”

Chapter 10: Getting Into Word Family Mode

When your child tells you that she “brung” her book home, you probably cor-
rect her, telling her that she brought her book home. That, of course, is helpful
for your child. But what if when she’s writing the word “listen,” she says lis-ten
(pronouncing the silent t) either to herself, or even out loud, to help with
remembering the right spelling. Is that a good thing or not? Some people say
that you shouldn’t encourage kids to purposely mispronounce words just so
they can remember how to spell them. Others say, “What the heck, whatever
works is fine.” As long as your child knows the correct pronunciation of a word
like listen, and what it means, I don’t see anything wrong with her using any
kind of self-talk she wants to make spelling easier. In time, she won’t need to
use those strategies, but until then, she has plenty of words to get used to, so
memory joggers of any kind can make her life easier. With that in mind, read
through the words in Table 10-8 with your child and ask her to break them up
and pronounce them in ways that feel right. Dictate some for her to write and
give her great big hints for spelling the hard words, like genius, if she wants 
you to.
If your child needs help spelling some words, by all means, help him. If you
make him spend ages figuring words out for himself, he’ll feel resentful and
think of spelling as a punishment or endurance test. Let him figure parts of
words out. Tell him the tricky parts that he can’t work out. Have him write
down and save any tricky words. Help him practice spelling them several
more times over the span of a few nights.
In dictionaries, you’ll find that the sound of the schwa is indicated. Look for
an upside down and left facing lower case e, just like this: ∂.
Schwa at the beginning
Thinking about schwa sounds can be mind boggling. I recommend that you
don’t worry so much about the whys and wherefores of the schwa and
instead just point out to your child that some kind pronunciations are fairly
sloppy. The next group of words shows you what I mean. All the words in
Table 10-9 start with schwa a, pronounced as indistinct, indifferent “uh.” Have
your child read the words. She can pronounce that lazy, drawled “uh” sound
as solid, short a, if it helps her remember the spelling. Dictate a few words for
her to spell.

Schwa at the end
Your child will come across a particular bunch of schwa words quite often —
words that are spelled with a schwa a on the end. Words like idea and camera
come under this lazy-a (“uh”)-on-the-end category and a whole bunch of
names of countries do, too. Table 10-10 shows you the words that I’m talking
about. After you’ve looked them over with your child, you may enjoy the geo-
graphical detour that I outline in the next activity.

diversion into labeling maps. Relate places on maps to your ancestors or
living relatives, or describe to your child how other kids live in different parts
of the world. The next activity gives you a chance to flex your latitudes and
wow your child with your worldliness.
Activity: Spelling continents
Preparation: You need an atlas, Internet access, or a good visual memory of
the continents for this activity.
Follow these steps:
1. Draw a simple map of the continents with your child. A good way to
share the drawing chores between you and your child is for you to
pencil in the lines while your child traces over them with markers. 
2. Have your child label the continents and point out the “uh” spellings
on the ends of America, Africa, Asia, Australia, and Antarctica. If your
child enjoys this activity, add the names of the oceans and any other fea-
tures that you feel like including.
A snippet of information that can help your child to grasp the idea of conti-
nents is to tell him that if he flew up in a rocket and looked down on the
earth, he’d be able to see all those shapes that he’s drawing.
A couple of handy Websites for maps, continents, and flags are www.
enchantedlearning.com/geography/continents/ and www.plcmc.org/
forkids/mow/ (mow stands for maps of the world).
Schwa in the middle
The next table is not for the fainthearted. It has big words in it and each of
them has a schwa sound somewhere in the middle. The schwa sound can 
be hard to detect, and you may not think any exists at all, but regardless 
of whether you hear one in there, these words definitely give your child a
challenge. Have your child take a good look at Table 10-11, (I underline the
schwas) and then try putting a few of the words into the back-to-front activity
that I give you next.
If you pronounce the schwas in this table as something other than “uh” don’t
worry; that’s what schwas are like. Some of us pronounce them clearly, just
as they’re spelled, while other of us do the “uh” thing. (You can debate what
counts and what doesn’t count as a schwa for a long and fruitless time!)

The game that I provide for you here works well with any word. Play it any
place, any time, because all you have to do is spell out a word backward to
your child.
Activity: Spelling back to front
Preparation: None
Follow these steps:
1. Spell out a word to your child backward. (d-a-r-w-k-c-a-b) 
2. Do the same thing once more, and then ask him to spell it back to you
in its real, right-way-around form.
Be extra clever with this activity by throwing in a palindrome such as radar
or racecar!
You may be surprised to find (like I have) that you’re not half as good at this
game as your kids are. I was horrified to discover that in back-to-front terms
even simple words are beyond me. My kids (rather heartlessly) exclude me
from this game now because I only hold everyone up.

A
nyone who knows anything about spelling will tell you that word fami-
lies are important. In this chapter I introduce you to the key word fami-
lies. I start you off with the easiest ones, like the alls and alks, move you
through the sound-alikes, like er and ir, and point out the look-alikes, with
words like book and boom. Some of the really tricky words, like thought and
enough are here in this chapter, too. With all these words to choose from,
you’re sure to find some that your child asks questions about at one time or
another.
The Distinctive-Looking 
all and alk Families
After your child has the hang of simple word families, such as the ell (bell,
sell, smell) and ink (brink, shrink, pink) families, she needs to come to grips
with common but more complex word families. Start her off gently with the
distinctive-looking all and alk families that I show you in Table 11-1. She’s
written some of these words hundreds of times already, so you probably only
need to dictate a few of them for her to rev up on.

Renegade words can disrupt your flow. You show your child a bunch of words
that follow a logical, predictable pattern, and you look all knowing, and then
he thinks of a word that’s spelled with the same pattern that you’re showing
him but doesn’t sound a bit like the others. Renegade words of the all family
are shall and balloon. There, now you won’t be caught unaware.
When your child spells words like almost, although, and altogether, he only
has to use one l.
Being Savvy with Vowel+r Words
Okay, this is where you and your child need to roll your sleeves up for vowel+r
words. Here I tell you about a whole bunch of words that fit a vowel+r spelling
pattern. Although the term “vowel+r” may sound cumbersome to you, this
group contains so many words that I have to use the umbrella term “vowel+r”
to fit them all in. Don’t be scared, there are easier and harder ways of looking
at these words and I’m taking the harder, oops I mean easier, way. Here is the
easy explanation of vowel+r:
184
Part IV: Using Word Families 

When you put each of the five vowels in front of r you make five spelling
chunks. Easy so far, right? Your child uses the ar, er, ir, or, and ur spellings all
over the place, and if you’re really on the ball, when you read those chunks,
you notice that or and ar are separate spellings for separate sounds whereas
er, ir, and ur are three separate spellings for the same sound. Which means
that when your child wants to spell a word with the “er” sound in it; she 
has to do a mental, or on paper, check of er, ir, and ur to see which one fits.
The more practice she gets, the better she can remember or spot (from her
jotted-down possibilities) the right spelling. So now, of course, you know 
just what to do: Give your child plenty of practice with plenty of words so 
she can make plenty of progress.
The words in the vowel+r family aren’t all that hard; just wait until you see
what’s coming later! This activity is a plain, practice — and practice — again
one just like you’d see happening in any spelling class. I’m saving quizzes and
stuff for further into the chapter, when the going gets a little harder. For now,
here are some basic spelling routines.
Activity: Looking, marking, and writing (then doing it some more)
Preparation: Open this book to Table 11-2, or make a copy of it so your child
doesn’t mark the book, and grab your highlighting pens, regular pen, and
paper.
Follow these steps:
1. Have your child read the or column and mark any unusual or tricky-
looking spelling chunks. Make sure he includes any words he thinks he
may otherwise forget.
2. Dictate a few words from the column for him to write. Include the
words he’s marked.
3. Repeat Steps 1 and 2 with the next (ar) column, and then dictate a mix
of words for your child to spell from the two columns (or and ar).
4. Explain that the next three columns have different spellings that never-
theless sound the same. Lead your child through each column, just like
you did in the first two steps, and then walk him through a mix of
spellings from all three columns.
5. Take a break! Congratulate yourselves.
You systematically and thoroughly took on a lot of spellings, and should now
be pretty accomplished with your r’s.

Recognizing other ways of using or and ar
Did I mention that you encounter a few thinker spellings in this chapter? I
did? Good. Here’s where they begin. In this section, I show you the other
ways of using or and ar. I give you words like worm and warm. They’re the
kind of thinker spellings that easily trip up your child unless you give him
due warning. Take your child through Table 11-3. Hang out with all those or’s
and ar’s for a while. If you can think of other words that don’t start with w,
you’re way ahead of me.

Chapter 11: Guiding Her Pen to Bigger Word Families

Moving ahead to two vowels+r
Time to turn the heat up a tad. Here I introduce you to not one but two
vowels in front of r. They look a bit much at first, but remember that you
don’t have to race through every table in one go.
This chapter is challenging, so take your time. Have your child spell the same
column (mixed around) a few times before moving forward to the next words.
Make sure he’s good and ready before you progress. Being thorough is better
than being fast, because the last thing you want is your child forgetting words
that he thought he had firmly under his belt.
Table 11-4 shows five bunches of words with two vowels+r. Your child won’t
anticipate these spelling patterns until he ‘s gotten used to using them,
because after all, who expects to write earn for a word that sounds like urn or
heart for a word that should reasonably be hart? Your child obviously needs
to take a good look at these words and put plenty of mileage on his pen. Have
him look at a few words, cover them over one at a time, and jot each one
down for himself. Then direct him to the activity that follows Table 11-4.
When you look at Table 11-4, you see a strange thing going on. Earlier your
child shimmied through different spellings of the “er” sound (er, ir, and ur),
and now, with two vowels+r she’s faced with three different spellings for “or.”
I provide you with pronunciation (in parenthesis) as I hear it. If you pro-
nounce words differently, that’s no problem. Your child attaches spellings to
whatever pronunciation he uses, which is probably the same as yours.

Daffodils and dishes
I don’t lead an edge-of-your-seat sort of a life, so
I look forward to bulb-planting time. This year,
while I was doing my horticultural best, my
daughter invited a friend over. They cooked
muffins, cookies, flavored rice, ravioli, and in fact,
as they pointed out, anything that came in a
packet. They laid the table with several cloths.
They didn’t scrimp on plates. They lighted can-
dles. They used a lot of side dishes, and there
were more than enough wineglasses. It was a
feast. Of course, I really had no business to be
looking at the dirty muffin tins, the pots and pans
with inches of rice stuck to every surface, the egg
shells, oily measuring jugs, and sugary goo hard-
ening on my countertop. The whole scene looked
like one thing to me and something entirely dif-
ferent to those kids. That’s how spelling can be.
Your child doesn’t see spellings like you do,
because she’s had less experience. Until some-
one (like you) shows her words like talk and tight,
she quite reasonably writes things like tawk and
tite. Show her the right spellings. Explain that she
can develop an eye for spotting what’s right. If
you pass the dishwasher or broom, you may want
to casually point them out, too, as equipment to
include in the next kitchen extravaganza.

Igh and ight Words
Words that end in igh and ight can be scary for your child. It’s hard for her to
remember about gh being silent and i making its long sound. You may decide
that if ever there were a good time for a mnemonic (memory jogger), it’s now.
Here’s a mnemonic to help your child remember at least the ght spelling chunk
of words like bright and sight: Words like fight, might, and tight are (in true Harry
Potter style) great hairy twit words. I know that isn’t exactly elevating, but a lot
of the things that your child remembers best aren’t! Run the great hairy twit
sentiment past your child to find out how she feels about it. If she thinks it’ll
stick in her mind, try her on a few dictated words to see if it works. If she isn’t
keen on it, have her think up her own mnemonic. See Table 11-5 for examples.
Giving your child free rein to make up her own mnemonics may not be right
for you. She may discover a knack for finding unsavory phrases that set your
cheeks on fire. If she does, it’s a pretty safe bet that she’ll never forget them
either, and then you’ll have to weigh her improved spelling against the affront
to your sensibilities!

Eight, Ought, and Aught
You simply cannot get away from the fact that the words in this section are
hard. Your child must remember a strange bunch of letters to be able to write
words like taught and weigh and can be forgiven for wondering why they’re
not spelled tawt and way. The explanation for the hardest part of these
words, the gh part, is that gh is a silent spelling chunk. Your child must write
it, but he won’t hear it. Pretty tricky, huh? To make things easier, I suggest a
couple of mnemonics They have sort of medical and moralistic themes, but
hey, here’s your chance to help your child with spelling and get a handle on
his personal hygiene. Besides, you try finding mnemonics for these spellings;
it isn’t easy.
To remember the arrangement of letters in words like eight and weight tell
your child: “Eight itchy gnomes have ticks.” 
For the itchy gnome mnemonic to work, your child needs to remember that
eight starts with e. The payoff is that “eight” reminds him that the words that
fit this mnemonic rhyme with eight. He needs to remember the silent g in
gnome too, but that’s pretty easy if he pronounces the spelling phonetically
as “guh-nome.” (Is there no end to this inventiveness?)
To bring words like thought and brought to mind, tell your child that “Only
ungrateful girls hate toys.” While she has these thought-provoking tick and
toy messages still in her mind, zip ahead to the activities.
Activity: Eight itchy gnomes have ticks
Preparation: Open this book to Table 11-6, and have your highlighter pens,
regular pen, and paper ready.
Follow these steps: 
1. Remind your child that, “Eight itchy gnomes have ticks,” and then ask
her to highlight the eight part of the words in the table. (Tell your
child to just remember that weigh doesn’t need a t on the end, which is
easy to remember because you don’t hear the t.). 
2. Now give your child these clues so that she writes out the words.
1. A number.
2. You see your ____when you stand on scales.
3. You ______yourself when you stand on scales.
4. You ride this on the snow.
5. The goods that boats, trains, and trucks carry.

Part IV: Using Word Families 
Hooked on mnemonics
You can pose the figuring out of mnemonics as a
problem for your child to solve. When I asked my
own daughter to think up a saying for helping
remember ought, she was hooked. She tried new
mnemonics for 15 minutes at the height of birth-
day party preparations. (I’m not obsessive; I
spent an hour, or so, pondering this on the day of
my daughter’s party.) She came up with forget-
table things about gibbons then made a dramatic
exit. “I have to do like a million things because it
is my birthday Mom,” she remonstrated. But, ah
ha, I knew that she really couldn’t think up a
better mnemonic that mine!

And what about taught and caught? Strange words, aren’t they? Tell your 
child that you’d have to be mad not to think these two have a sneaky kind of
spelling. Ask her how she’ll remember them. Will she start off with the “Only
ungrateful girls hate toys,” mnemonic and then remember to change the o to
an a? Or what? 
You’ve probably heard the terms “child centered” learning and “active” learn-
ing. They describe how your child learns best when he actively figures stuff out
for himself. When you get your child to figure out his own spelling mnemonics
you facilitate child-centered and active learning (and he remembers his own
mnemonics better than yours, provided that his make good sense to him.) The
word “facilitate” is apt here. When teachers set up child-centered activities
they describe their role as that of facilitator.
Enough and Some
Just so you know, this chapter gets easier after this section. A few words here
may have your child volunteering to clean her room rather than cranking her
spelling skills up a notch, but reassure her that there’s no need to be rash.
When she breaks these words into chunks, she can speed through them, and
although she may not realize it, she understands a few of those chunks
already. The next activity takes you and your child one step at a time through
the sizzlers in Table 11-7.

Activity: Colors and chunks
Preparation: Make a copy of Table 11-7, and grab some color highlighter
pens.
Follow these steps:
1. Starting with the o words, ask your child to find all the words that
have only one spelling chunk (or syllable). Tell him that he has to find
nine words, and one of them is tricky, so watch out. The words are some,
love, none, dove, front, glove, come, done, and tongue: tongue is the
tricky one. 
2. Have your child color all the words in the same color then dictate
them for him to spell.
3. Tell your child that all the o words that remain have two chunks,
except for one. Ask him which one it is. (The answer is discover.)
4. Have your child color the two-chunk words in a new color, and the
three-chunk word in its own color. 
5. Ask him which words are easy, hard, or strange. Help him take a good
look at the words, and then dictate them for him to spell. Give clues and
help whenever he needs it. Encourage your child to try spelling the
hardest words of all again until he’s conquered them soundly.
6. Go through the same careful, systematic routine with the ou words.
You want your child to get the message that all spellings can be brought under
control. The trick is to group them, tackle a few at a time, and use plenty of
colors! The most important thing of all for you to remember is to keep your
tone positive and your message one of, “Don’t worry, we can crack this.”

Swooping In on the Two oo’s
The oo sound of boot is the easiest oo spelling with which to start your child’s
spelling voyage. Many words are in this group, and your child can easily hear
and then spell that nice long sound. Conversely, the sound in book, look, and
took isn’t a bit like the nice long one in boot, but the words in the book, look,
and took family are just as common, so with a bit of practice, your child can
quickly and easily come to grips with them, too. Have him watch out for words
like door though. Only a handful of door-type words (where the oo spellings has
an aw or or sound depending on your accent) are out there. Lead your child
through all three families in Table 11-8 with the “Colors and chunks” activity.
Remember that speed isn’t important but thoroughness and cheerfulness are.

Choosing from Two Good Spellings
When your child spells, she says the word that she’s spelling in her mind. She
isolates the chunks of sound and then matches letters to the sounds. When I
put it that way, spelling sounds easy, doesn’t it? Well, some of it is. Words like
impossible and dramatic, for example, look hard but are really quite simple to
spell. They have nice regular chunks of sound that belong with nice regular
chunks of spelling. Other words provide your child with choices. Should she
write choice or choyce? Both words are made of good spelling chunks, but
only one is right. The sound of “oy” can be spelled either oy or oi, and your
child needs to recognize which spelling fits neatly in which words. In this sec-
tion, I lead you through three pairs of spellings: oy and oi; ow and ou; and aw
and au. Each member of each pair represents the same sound as the other
member of the pair.
Oy and oi
As a general rule, if your child hears “oy” on the end of a word (or root word),
it’s spelled oy. If he hears “oy” in the middle of a word, he spells it oi.
A root word is a word that your child can add bits and pieces onto. Employ is
a root word. Your child can simply write employ, or he can add to it to make
employment, employing, or employed.
When your child puts a spelling chunk like un at the beginning of a root word;
for example, unemployed, she’s added a prefix. Endings like ed, ing, and er are
suffixes. I talk more about prefixes and suffixes in Chapters 15 and 16.
Give your child a good look at Table 11-9, tell him that he generally writes oy
at the end of a word and oi in the middle, and then let him loose with this quiz.
196
Part IV: Using Word Families 

Activity: oy-oi quiz
Preparation: Make a copy of the quiz that follows, and have your regular
pens standing by.
Follow this step: Have your child circle the right spellings.
1. The boi/boy flipped the coyn/coin.
2. The spoiled/spoyled girl was annoied/annoyed.
3. Roy/Roi heard a noise/noyse.
4. The kids said they’d boil/boyl the oister/oyster in oil/oyl.
5. The boss said she can joyn/join his employ/emploi.
6. He made his joynts/joints click.
7. The man gave the royal/roial princess a toi/toy.
8. She had a loud voyce/voice.
9. She said that he spoiled/spoyled her painting.
10. Ann asked the coy/coi girl to join/joyn her.
When your child’s presented you with his answers, have an “I bet you can’t
do this” finale. Dictate the ten words for him to write (accompanied by your
appreciative or stricken ooh’s).

Ow and ou
Any time your child hears the “ow” sound, like he’d say if someone pinched
him, he has two choices of spellings. He can write “ow” or “ou,” and the only
way he’ll get good at deciding between the two is to get plenty of practice
with them. Table 11-10 shows a hefty collection of words for your child to get
a good start on. Have him go through the “Colors and chunks” routine (from
earlier in this chapter) with this table, because it’s a solid, reliable drill that
feels more like an okay or even fun practice than the usual dull old drill (the
kind you’d find in other spelling books!).

Every now and then I squeeze an extra word table in these pages. It happens
when I think of words that don’t exactly fit in with the theme I’m talking
about but are so irritatingly similar that I can’t leave them out. In this section
that irritant is words like snow and throw. Your child must put the ow spelling
in these words, but it represents a long-o (“oh”) sound. This spelling has
nothing to do with the “Ow, you pinched me” sound that I was talking about,
but you can see why I have to mention it, can’t you? Make sure that your
child is comfortable with the being-pinched sound, spelled ow or ou; then
show him the words in Table 11-11. Have him whiz through the “Colors and
chunks” activity, because, well, you know why.
Watch out for the words bow and sow. They’re homographs — words that
have two different meanings for the very same spelling (“I bow to the queen
and tie her bow.” “I sow the seed and hope the sow doesn’t dig it up.”)

Table 11-12 contains a collection of aw and au words, and these words can
certainly send your child’s head spinning. Following is a silly activity to make
good use of those weird feelings that all those spins might stir up.

Reporting for cleanup duty
Today my kids raced breathlessly into the house
from the school bus. “Did the school phone
you?” they yelled. Hmm!?!? The school hadn’t
phoned me, but obviously things — probably bad
things — had been going on. It took less than two
seconds for the non-offending child to tell me
what my other child had done.
“She buried herself in the sandbox, Mom. She
and Erika got the other kids to cover them up and
then they stayed there. The teachers had to get
them out after all the other kids had gone to
class,” the tattler said.
And so little Miss Daredevil and I had a talk. Sand
is fun. Sand is good. Getting yourself buried in the
schoolyard isn’t good; it’s potentially dangerous.
And making your teacher trek out to get you is
just asking for cleanup duty. What does this
vignette have to do with spelling? Some spellings
test your child’s judgment. She won’t get cleanup
duty if she makes the wrong decision, but she’ll
see as soon as she writes a word like “boyl” that,
like being in the sandbox after hours, it isn’t the
smart choice. The more she views different
options like choice or choyce, coin or coyn,
sandbox or classroom, the better she gets at
plumbing for the right one.

Signing off
I spend quite a bit of time saying things like this
to my kids:
“You need to sort this out with words.”
“No hitting or throwing.”
“If I hear one more put-down from either of you
I turn this car around and we go home.”
All that talk (especially when I’m itching to yell
and do other bad stuff) can leave me quite
drained, and it isn’t unusual for me to hit the sack
at about the time that groovier people are head-
ing out for things like meals without ketchup and
drinks from real glass. Not much fun, huh? Except
that sometimes my kids leave me notes like this:
“I love u, sorry 4 the trouble caused. You’re a
great mom.” — signed Your loving daughter
You’d have to be pretty callous not to go all I-
have-nice-kids-after-all with a note like that. It
looks like she actually hears the stuff that I say
about apologizing. And check out those words.
This child, known for breaking into song or walk-
ing off when I’m right in the middle of explaining
stuff like the “au” spelling, may, incredibly, be
absorbing some of it after all.

Taking Care with are, ear, and air
Remember when your child read about the Care Bears? And you wondered
how on earth you’d help him with all those different spellings of the same
sound? Ah, but somehow he managed to get things right. He read the stories
and cruised through the spellings. But that was reading (and reading comes
easier to kids than spelling). Now it’s time to revisit those Care Bears for the
sake of your child’s spelling. He needs to sort out ares, ears, and airs so he
can strut his stuff on paper. You and Table 11-13 are his allies. Help him check
out all the words and have fun with the two activities.

plant.
2. Stare: Change the last letter so that it means the same as begin.
3. Bare: Change the last letter so you have a place to keep hay.
4. Share: Change the last letter so that it means the opposite of blunt.
5. Pair: Change the last letter so that it means what you’d feel if you were
kicked.

I
’m old enough to remember when average people didn’t own computers. I
learned, fairly begrudgingly, about computers, in adulthood. Now, I can
scarcely believe life went on smoothly before. If your child can handle a
computer, she’s better equipped for writing school reports. But she needs
another skill for every written task she does, in or out of school, with or with-
out a computer. That skill is being able to spell common words quickly. This
chapter tells you how to help your child with “sight” words.
Introducing Sight Words
Some words like they and were, crop up time and time again. Your child needs
to immediately recognize them and be able to spell them as an automatic
reflex. These words are known as sight words. Table 12-1 is a list of the 221
most frequently used sight words. Take a quick look at them and then lead
your child through the activity that follows.

This first activity is your warm-up. Have your child grab some highlighters
and run through the simple coloring task so he gets a good first look at all 
the words.
Activity: Color-coding sight words
Preparation: Make a copy of Table 12-1 and grab some highlighter pens.
Follow this step: Among the words in Table 12-1 are 26 that have only one or
two letters in them. Have your child find and color in all 26.
Skipping through the Families
Many of the 220 words in Table 12-1 belong to word families, groups of 
words that partly spell and sound the same. If your child can spell one family
member, she can probably spell the entire family. Table 12-2 shows word fami-
lies from the 220 sight words with extra words added to some families so you
can clearly see the spelling (and sound) pattern. The “Ten neat word families”
and “Building word families,” activities later in this section can help your child
get into family mode.
When teachers show your child word families they start with families that
have the identical spelling at the end of the words, like in all, call and ball. 
In this table I go a step further. I include the identical spelling, the ones teach-
ers typically use, but I give more advanced ones too where the identical
spelling is between other letters, like in about and found in which the identi-
cal spelling pattern is ou. Show your child the easier families before delving
into the advanced families.
If your pronunciation of words in this table is different from the examples I
give, you can simply exclude the words that don’t seem to fit in with the rest
of the word family.

The question-forming who starts with wh too, but it doesn’t belong in this wh
word family because its wh spelling is pronounced as “h.” Who is a distinctive,
class-of-its-own sort of word.
I’m about to squeeze one more table into this section. I’m not trying to over-
whelm you, but the next bunch of words is one that your child really needs to
have under her belt. This formidable-looking group of words won’t faze your
child after you present them to her in the short-u grouping in Table 12-3,
which has the short-u sound spelled “ou.” When your child gets used to this
spelling version of short u, she’ll find that the words aren’t half as tricky as
they seemed at first.
Take your time with this chapter. Focus on one or two word families for a
week so that your child really masters them and feels confident. A system-
atic, one-step-at-a-time approach brings out the great speller in your child.

If your child pronounces a different sound in some words, like “er” in courage,
and long “o” in thorough (rather than short “u”) have him highlight these
words. They’re ones to watch out for.
The spelling chunk gh says “f” in six common words (you may think of more):
cough, laugh, trough, rough, tough, and enough.
209
Chapter 12: Spelling Sight Words: A Different Family

The “Ten neat word families” activity helps you take your child through the
word families in Tables 12-2 and 12-3. Some tough words are included here, so
encourage your child to use highlighters and scrap paper to mark and jot
down unusual spelling chunks.
Activity: Ten neat word families
Preparation: Equip you and your speller with paper and pens or whiteboard
and markers.
Follow these steps:
1. With your child, look at the word families in Tables 12-2 and 12-3.
2. Have your child sound out the words. 
3. Have her highlight the sound (all, ee and ea, ou, ould, wh, wa, war,
wor, o, and ou) that makes each grouping a word family. 
4. Say the following things and ask her to her write down the answers:
1. “Which word in the all family is hardest?”
2. “Which word in the all family is easiest?”
3. “Number the words in the all family.”
4. “Choose a number and I’ll read out that word for you to spell.”
5. Use this drill with the remaining nine families.
You can find more single words among the 220 sight words in Table 12-1 to
which you can add more words to make more families. Your child can make
easy families, such as and, hand, stand, band, grand, and brand, or harder fam-
ilies, such as saw, paw, law, lawn, fawn, dawn, and awful. In case you don’t
want to find your own words from which to build new families (you want the
full-service option rather than self-serve), I’ve chosen some families for you
in the next activity.
Activity: Building word families
Preparation: Get that paper and those pens or the whiteboard and markers
ready again.
Follow these steps:
1. Tell your child that together you’re going to think up some word 
families. 
2. Have your child write the first word from the next list and then ask
him to think of family members to go with it (without showing him 
the examples I’m giving you in parentheses — they’re the ones he 
can think up).
210
Part IV: Using Word Families 

1. big (Examples: pig, wig, dig, and jig)
2. best (Examples: pest, test, and west)
3. bring (Examples: sing, thing, ring, and wing)
4. be (Examples: he, me, and she)
5. by (Examples: my, fry, cry, and shy)
6. fast (Examples: last, past, and blast)
7. far (Examples: star, start, and smart)
8. away (Examples: may, day, say, pay, stay, play, and delay)
9. or (Examples: for, store, and more)
10. find (Examples: mind, kind, and pine)
11. light (Examples: tight, sight, fight, fright, and slight)
12. soon (Examples: moon, spoon, and booth)
13. down (Examples: drown, frown, clown, brown, bow, and now)
14. walk (Examples: talk, chalk, and stalk)
15. would (Examples: could and should)
If you’re building a family like and, hand, stand, band, grand, and brand, and
your child suggests planned, explain that although this word sounds right, it
has a different spelling. That’s why writing a few spelling possibilities down
(planed, planned, pland) and getting good at spotting the right one is best.
Taking Time with the Individuals
A few paragraphs back, I describe the word who as a “distinctive, class-of-its-
own sort of word.” Because who has such an unexpected spelling, it’s pretty
clear that it doesn’t belong in a family. No other words are like who, so how,
you ask, will your child remember how to spell who and other singular, rene-
gade words?
Table 12-4 gives you the eccentric individuals that I weeded out of the 220
sight words. These words are here because they don’t usually belong to a
word family and don’t sound out easily. Have your child cast his eye over
them and then move on to the “Finding your spelling strategies” activity.
These strategies tell you and your child how to start remembering the words.

Some of the words in Table 12-4 belong to teensy-weensy word families. Word
families, regardless of how small, help your child remember spellings.
Acronyms and rhymes are helpful, too. The next activity takes a look at mini
families and cute anagrams.
Acronyms are letters like P.T.O (please turn over) that are short for a whole
bunch of words. They help you keep things short but can also be your
memory joggers.
Activity: Finding your spelling strategies
Preparation: Grab your paper, pens, scissors, and an envelope, and make a
copy of Table 12-4.
Follow these steps:
1. Tell your child that together (but mostly him), you’re going to think up
some ways to help him remember the tricky spellings in Table 12-4. 
2. Say the following to your child. Some examples are given in 
parentheses.
1. “Write any, and cut it out.”
2. “Write many, cut it out, and put it with any.”
3. “Write give, and cut it out.”
4. “Write which word is almost exactly like give (live), cut it out, and
put it next to . . . give.”
5. “Which word is almost exactly like there? (where)”
6. “Write both words, (there and where) and cut them out.”
212
Part IV: Using Word Families 

7. “Write this silly saying: ‘Big elephants can always understand small
elephants.’”
8. “Write the first letter of each word so you get a word that a lot of
people find hard to spell. (because)”
9. “Write this saying: ‘Laugh and u get happy,’ using the letter u as
shorthand for the real word ‘you.’”
10. “Write each first letter (using u for ‘you’) to make its word (laugh).”
11. “Write the word by like in ‘I stand by you.’ Cut it out.”
12. “When you buy something you get more. Write by with a u in the
middle. (See how u gets more; it’s a bigger word). Cut out buy.”
3. By now, your child has ten words in front of him. Have him turn them
face down, mix them up, and give them to you. Dictate them for him
to spell.
Keep the ten words in the envelope and do this practice every night for a
week. If your child isn’t sure about a word by the end of a week, keep that
word (or words) for practicing through another week.
Having your child do the cutting, holding, and passing of these words puts her
in control. When she thinks she’s learning for herself, and not doing stuff just
because you say so, you and she are experiencing active and child-centered
learning. This kind of learning is what teachers are always aiming for, because
it’s the best kind!
The next list gives you the words in Table 12-4 that I haven’t talked about 
yet. They’re tricky words so I provide you with suggestions for making them
memorable for your child. If you think of other memory aids along the way,
by all means use them. Any way that helps your child fix those visual images
in his mind is a good way.
If you practice ten sight words every week, include only three or four of these
tricky words in that ten. They’re too hard to master in one go.
Remembering unusual words:
1. any: Write this “eny” sound as any (like “Annie”).
2. many: Put m on the front of any.
3. as: Write the “z” sound as s. (You do the same in words like has, does,
pleasure, measure, and treasure, and plurals like stoves, dogs, and sands.)
4. here: Here is a Bossy e word. I explain Bossy e a few lines down.
5. once: Break once into on-ce (what a word!).
6. pretty: Spell the short-i sound with an e.
7. said: Spelled s + aid (like first aid).
213
Chapter 12: Spelling Sight Words: A Different Family

8. their: Write the at the start of both there and their. Both have the in them,
but only there has here inside it, too (there and here are directional
words).
9. use: Use is a Bossy e word. I explain Bossy e a few lines down.
10. were: Break were into w+ er + silent e.
11. who: You’d expect to write hoo but have to start with silent w instead,
and then get even weirder by adding ho!
12. one: Spell on, and then add e.
13. have: Write “hav” just like it sounds, and then put silent e on the end.
14. your: Write you then add r.
Looking for Spelling Rules
Spelling rules are truly helpful. But some books rely too heavily on them,
giving you dozens of rules and then bombarding you with exceptions to the
rules. In this book I keep things simple. I focus on these three main rules that
apply to heaps of words:
 Bossy e at the end of a word makes the vowel long (mat turns into mate).
 When two vowels go walking, the first one does the talking (like in boat).
 Y makes long-e or long-i sounds at the end of words (like in happy and
cry).
The sections that follow explain how to make your child comfortable with
these three rules.
Bossy e
The rule you’ll see at work in words like came and ride is the Bossy e rule.
The Bossy e rule is where e added on to the end of a one-vowel word makes
the vowel have a long sound. A good way to describe this rule to your child is
to say that Bossy e sits at the end of the word and bosses the earlier vowel
into saying its name.
The sight words in which Bossy e is at work are in the minitable that follows.
214

like
these (z sound written as s)
came
live
those (z sound written as s)

here
make
use (z sound written as s)
live (like in alive)
ride
Tell your child to spell the z sound in these, those, and use with s, and then
dictate the words for him to write. Give him as much help as he needs. You
may want to do two dictations, the first for figuring it all out; the second to
get a clean, error-free sweep at the words.
When two vowels go walking
In words like clean and sweep the “When-two-vowels-go-walking-the-first-one-
does-the-talking (and shouts it name)” rule is at work.
This rule means that when two vowels appear next to each other in a word,
the second vowel stays silent and the first vowel takes on a long sound, or
says it’s own name. The sight words in which you see this rule doing its thing
are in the minitable that follows.
Two vowels walking

In normal speech, you usually pronounce again “uh-gen.” However, it’s easier
to spell when pronounced ag-ain (like in pain). The same pronunciation thing
happens in words like the and a. Your child will remember their spellings
more easily when he starts off pronouncing them as “th-ee,” and not “thuh,”
and “ay,” and not “uh.”
The pairs of vowels that you see most in these sight words are ee and ea.
These pairs are common, and the other two pairs that your child will see 
in many words are ai (pain, rain, and train) and oa (boat, soak, and throat).
Point out the “ag-ain” pronunciation of again to your child, and then dictate
the words for him to write.
215
Chapter 12: Spelling Sight Words: A Different Family

Y making long-e or long-i sounds
Y is a letter your child will use quite often. When he’s spelling a word that
ends with the sound of long e or long i, he needs to try out a y for fit. Y makes
the long-e sound on the end of longer words (happy, silly, sunny) and the long
i sound on the end of short words (my, by, and shy). Y is featured on the end
of the sight words in the minitable that follows.
Longing for y

every

Before your child ever tries to spell a list of words, take a look at them with
him. Look for unusual and similar spelling features. If your child is fore-
warned of potential spelling hazards, he won’t get caught by them. In the list
that follows, I give quite a few things for you to point out:
 any and many: “en” is written an
 every: every and not evry like it sounds
 funny and carry: have double letters
 why: is one of the six “wh” question-forming words (why, when, where,
which, what, and who)
When your child has highlighted the tricky words, circled tricky letters, and
scribbled tricky words out a couple of times, you can dictate all the words for
her to spell.
Getting Faster at Spelling Sight Words
Your child has to spell sight words quickly. That’s because sight words crop
up so often that if your child is slow to spell them he’ll be a slow writer. If he’s
fluent and accurate at spelling sight words, he has brainpower in reserve for
thinking of other things, like the flow and sense of his writing, whether he’s
giving the right answer, and how to spell less common words like infrequent.
Help your child cruise through sight words by focusing on up to ten words at
a time. Point out spelling features in those words, like silent or double letters.
Establish a regular routine of spelling the ten words every night for a week (it
takes only ten minutes a night). After a week, get ten new words. Keep going
until your child can spell all 220 sight words quickly and accurately. If he can
write a word already, you don’t have to add it to your ten words to learn. If
after a week he still can’t spell one or two words, put them into the next
batch of ten to run through again.
216
Part IV: Using Word Families 

When your child writes regular text he doesn’t need to worry about getting
every spelling right first time. It’s better that he gets all his thoughts down.
He can underline spellings he’s not sure of and come back to them later.
When children are overly worried about perfect spelling they don’t write as
much and use a limited vocabulary. They don’t reach beyond what they can
already do, so they can’t make much progress.
Having Fun With Sight Words
You and your child can have fun spelling sight words. Write them onto slips
of paper or use commercial flashcards and then use them in “Seeing and writ-
ing” spelling activities. Here are some easy ones to try out:
Seeing and writing
The simplest way for your child to learn to spell is for him to look at a word
and then write it plenty of times. Have him do this by using ten of the sight
words at a time and playing these “See and write” games with them:
 Have ten sight words on ten pieces of paper. Have your child spread
them out facedown and then ask him to turn each word over, take a
quick peek at it, and then write it on his paper.
 Have your child put the ten words into a stack and ask him to turn each
one over, quickly look at it, and then and write it down.
 Holding the words in a fan facing you, ask your child to pick a word,
peek at it, and write it down.
 Holding the ten words in a fan facing you, ask him to select but not look
at, a word and then take three guesses at which word he’s selected. If he
guesses correctly, he takes a peek at it and writes it down. Keep going
until he’s done all ten words.
Hiding and seeking
Most kids like hide and seek, but younger kids, in particular, like to find their
words. Hide the ten words around the house and direct your child to them with
hot and cold instructions. You know, when she’s getting closer to a word, tell
her she’s getting hotter, and when she’s moving away from a word, say she’s
getting colder. When she’s found all the words, dictate them for her to write.
217
Chapter 12: Spelling Sight Words: A Different Family

Racing the clock
If your child wants a challenge, get out your watch or stopwatch. You can
blow a whistle to start him off, too. Setting a time for him to beat, dictate the
ten words for him to write. Or you can time him writing the words on the first
dictation and then have him try to beat his own time with each successive
dictation. You can play any of the “Seeing and writing” or “Hiding and seek-
ing” games against a clock.
Keeping track
Your child wants to know that he’s doing well, wants to feel proud of himself,
and needs you to show that you’re proud of him, too. The best way to track
and acknowledge his progress is with a visual reminder. In other words, you
need a progress chart. You can make a pie chart or line graph, if you’re handy
on the keyboard, or a simple chart onto which your child sticks stickers is just
as good. You can even make copies of the tables in this book and put gold
stars over the words he’s already learned to spell, if you’d like.
A good way to start keeping a track of progress is to have a ten-week plan,
which simply means that you plan to guide your child through ten new words
each week for ten weeks, and then plot those weeks on poster paper. You can
draw ten circles to be filled with ten stickers or stars each week or a bar graph
to be made into ten bars each of ten units. Better yet, try drawing a line reach-
ing to the moon for your child to color or stick stickers onto to see if he can
spell into space. You can even make a picture with 100 segments that need to
be colored in, or have a marble jar to be filled with 100 marbles or get 100
stick-it labels to be stuck onto a door. I’m sure you get the idea that you can
show off your child’s progress in a lot of different ways.
Making the most of mediums
By making the most of mediums, I’m not talking about the kind who sit in
darkened rooms, see the future, and venture into other dimensions. I don’t
know a thing about those mediums, but I do know that everyone knows
something about mediums like paint, wax crayons, and shaving foam. They’re
different substances that you can write words with so that spelling is more
fun. Jazzing up spelling activities by using different mediums is easy and fun.
Get a large tray and reach for some sand, sugar, cream, shaving foam, pud-
ding, mud, or rice. Have your child write his letters in whichever delicious or
dirty medium you choose or have him create the letters to the words from
modeling compound or pastry mix. Last, but not least, I need to mention the
218
Part IV: Using Word Families 

common stuff like pens and markers. Have a selection of colors and types
and branch out into making bubble, rainbow, or shadow letters for effect.
Bubble letters are the fat kind that kids love to doodle, rainbow letters are
letters written in different colors, usually one color after another, and shadow
letters appear three dimensional.
Games to go
The easy activities and games that I give next lend themselves perfectly to
those times when you’re waiting at soccer practice or Brownies. You may
remember some of them from your own childhood. If you want even more
ideas, flip over to Chapter 21.
Straightforward oral spellings
Although not actually a game, you may be surprised to find how much your
child likes straightforward spelling, especially if he’s already practiced the
words and is pretty sure to get them all right. He actually likes you to ask him
to spell them out loud. In the car, at the supermarket, or in the elevator, ask
him to spell a few words for you. Younger, energetic kids will want to get right
into the act, too.
Oral spellings with a theme
Think of a theme like words that end in tion or have more than three syllables,
and take turns saying and spelling them. This activity works well with two or
more children, and you can make the themes easier for the younger kids.
Boxes
I like this game. Boxes is more interactive than some games and the more
your child plays, the better game he can give you. Start by drawing a square
grid of dots, 4 dots by 4 dots (16 dots in all). Take turns drawing individual
lines between two side-by-side dots. You can draw vertically or horizontally
but not diagonally. Your goal is to complete more boxes than your opponent.
Whenever you complete a box by adding the fourth side to a three-sided box,
you put your mark inside your box (usually your initial) and get another turn.
“So,” you’re asking, “where does the spelling fit in?” Give your child five free
turns to start the game off, if he first spells five words correctly.
Words on your back
Have you a child with a vacant back? Write a word onto it with your finger.
Write the first letter a few times until he figures out what it is, and then do the
same with the remaining letters. When your child figures out the entire word,
turn around and offer up your back for reciprocation.
219
Chapter 12: Spelling Sight Words: A Different Family

In Chapter 20, I describe how to play “Boxes” and “Words on your back” with
groups.
Picture words
Words like jump, walk, and eat are good for doodling with. Ask your child to
draw in and around the words to make them look like what they’re saying.
Some letters can jump out of jump, walk can have a pair of feet added to the
bottom of the k; and eat can be put on a plate. Let your child come up with
good ideas for again, around, down, drink, grow, light, little, tent, and two.

Part IV: Using Word Families 
One bite at a time
This week I’ve been consulting my I-will-not-
shout-at-my-kids reminder note. It’s summer
vacation. My kids spend a lot of time trashing
their rooms and thinking up new things to fight
over. Sometimes, though, they want me to take
them shopping, which I dislike, so they offer to
do chores. When they first used this soft-soap
approach, I handled it badly. I said things like,
“Clean your room.” My kids then went about
stuffing their clothes, clean or dirty, into draw-
ers, pushing their toys under their bed and, as
such, pronouncing their room clean. I learned
quickly, and now tell them to do specific things,
such as put their clean clothes in their drawers
or sweep the floor . . . and they do. A job that
looks big, even conceptually, can be off-putting.
That same job, broken into single tasks, looks
doable. When you help your child with sight
words, have him take bite-sized pieces of the
whole job. Have him spell no more than ten new
words at a time. Stick with the same ten words
each night for a week so your child digests the
new information and thus has an appetite for
more, especially if you make spelling tasks fun.

S
ilent letters are like the extra gizmos and whatnots I see on my computer.
Although there are a lot of them, I’m just not sure what they do yet. I
know for sure that even though they puzzle me, they belong there.
Knocking with your Knuckles
Knees, knock, and knew all start with silent k. The silent-k family has many
common words in it, and it’s an easy one for your child to get familiar with,
because that k is so darned odd. Goodness knows why it’s there, but your
child can have fun pronouncing it to remember the spelling. Table 13-1 has a
dozen silent k words for you and your child to pronounce and marvel at.
After your child notices that kn always says n, have her look for any other
spelling features in the words (like oe, ew, edge), and then move straight into
dictating a few of those words for her to spell. If she spells every word right,
rejoice and head to the next table and the “Clever cards” game. If your child
spells some words incorrectly, have her jot those words down a couple more
times to jog her memory.
When your child struggles with a word, write it on a piece of paper and place it
in an envelope. (Younger kids like to decorate their envelopes.) Have him spell
that word every night for a week, but use no more than 10 words each week. If
you include words from the same word family, like knee, knock and knew, the
common feature (silent k) makes them easier for your child to remember.

Plunging into a Sea of Silent Letters
If I asked you to write words like knee and comb, you’d probably write them
quickly. But to your child, they’re not so familiar and most likely perplexing.
In this chapter, I give you a dozen silent-letter families you can lead your
child carefully through.
A word family is a group of words that have a spelling and sound pattern in
common. Every word in the family has an identical part in it, like in sing, sting,
ring, and thing and knee, knot, knew, and knit.
Delighting over your Daughter
The silent part of delight and daughter is gh. Silent gh turns up in a lot of
words. Some of those words are tricky (taught, through, bought), so taking
your time with them is well worth the effort. Scan over Table 13-2, and then
try the five spelling strategies that follow. When you’re ready for something
lighter, have fun with the “Clever cards” activity.
igh always makes the long “eye” sound.

The words in Table 13-2 are tricky. Give your child a few helpful strategies for
remembering how to spell them.
The five best spelling strategies your child can use with hard spellings are
 Spelling words in family groups (tight, fright, light) rather than as 
individuals.
 Highlighting the tricky part within a word to remember the sound and
look of it better.
 Writing out a word five times.
 Spelling the same ten words every night for a week.
 Taping words onto often-seen walls (like bathroom walls).
Your child will come upon the silent gn family at some point. Its words are
resign design, gnaw, gnat, campaign, foreign, and reign. You may not want to
spell these words right now, but I give them to you now so you can refer to
them when you need to.
Activity: Clever cards (two players)
Preparation: Onto each of 26 index cards copy one of the 26 words from the
kn, ight, and aught families in Tables 13-1 and 13-2. Remember only one word
on each separate card. Onto six more index cards write the word “Spell.”
Follow these steps: 
1. Player 1 shuffles all 32 cards together and deals 7 cards each, and
then places the remaining cards in the deck facedown. He turns up
(exposes) the top card on the deck to start a discard stack. 
2. Player 2 starts play by laying one of his cards onto the discard pile. The
card must be either a “spell” card or a card of the same family as the last
card on the discard stack. If he lays a “spell” card, he takes a card from his
opponent and reads out the word for his opponent to spell. 
3. If the opponent spells correctly the card goes on top of the discard
pile and play goes back to Player 2. 
4. If he spells incorrectly, he keeps the incorrectly spelled word and
picks up another card. 
223
Chapter 13: Being Vocal about Silent Letters

5. Play then advances to Player 2 who lays any card he wants (on top of
the “spell” card). The object of the game is to be the first person to play
all of your cards 
If the first card you overturn to start the discard stack is a “spell” card put in
on the bottom of the stack and turn up the next card.
You can play this game with any word families, as long as you end up with a
deck of about 30 cards.
Wriggling your Wrist
Silent w is an important letter. Your child sees it again and again. It’s in the
word write for one thing and in wh words like who and whole. Table 13-3 gives
wr words and I say more about wh words later in this section.
Table 13-3
Silent w
wrist
wrong
wreck
wriggle
wrap
write

wretch
wrinkle

wren

wreath

writhe
wry
The “wr” spelling always says r.
Some of the really important silent w words are: whole, who, whose, and
whom.
One way to sort them is to say that whole is easy because it’s simply a regu-
lar hole with a w in front, and the rest of the words use a single o to make the
oo sound like in moon.
Squealing and Squirming
Tell your child to always jot down a silent u after a q like in quick and quiz.
Table 13-4 shows a lot of qu words. Look out for spelling features like the a in
quad (it sounds like short o) and the or in equator (it’s or not er). When you
224
Part IV: Using Word Families 

and your child have read through the table noting tricky spelling chunks, try
your luck in the next activity, Eight-square bingo.
Very occasionally your child comes upon a word that has a q in it but no u,
like in Iraq and Qatar (words of foreign origin).

q never goes anywhere without u.
The usual sound of qu is “kw” like in liquid but sometimes you hear “k,” like
in liquor.
The words inquire and enquire are interchangeable. But in newspapers an
inquiry is a formal, official looking-into and an enquiry is a more informal
question.
Spend extra time on the two look-alikes; quiet and quite. Have your child pro-
nounce them clearly so he can see that the spelling arrangements make good
sense.
Activity: Eight-square bingo
Preparation: Have your child write eight words from Tables 13-3 and 13-4,
well spaced on a piece of paper and then cut out each word. Each of you also
needs an index card and a pen.
Follow these steps: 
1. Each of you draws eight squares on your card in two rows of four
squares and then writes each of the eight words in any order in the
individual squares. 
225
Chapter 13: Being Vocal about Silent Letters

2. Have your child put the cutout words in a bowl, and without looking,
draw out a word. 
3. Cross off the words as they’re drawn. The first person to cross off a
complete row of four words wins.
Disguising as a Guard
In many words, your child writes gu but says only g. Show your child the
words in Table 13-5 so she isn’t bewildered by this gu spelling. Have her write
the words out a few times to help her remember that this gu isn’t a soft “gee”
sound like in gy, gi, and ge. I talk at length about soft sounds in Chapter 14, but
right now, I have other g spellings to show you. When you and your child have
taken a look at Table 13-5, move to the gue and gn spellings. Between these
two groups, you can see what must be some of the most bizarre spellings in
use. When you’ve cast your beguiled, intrigued or resigned eye over Tables
13-5 through 13-7, be sure to check out the “Looney letter” activity.
Table 13-5
gu Words
guess
guest
guilt
guide

I have a little bunch of words to squeeze in here. It’s the family of words in
which ui is pronounced as short i, like in ink. From the table, you find out
that guitar, guilt, and guinea belong to this family. Other members are biscuit,
builder, built, and build.
Being Vague about the League
Show your child the gue combination that tags onto the ends of words and
keeps that hard “guh” sound. It makes words look fairly ferocious, so you may
want to write them out a few ways in different colors, in bubble letters, or
going vertically. By joining in with your child’s artistry, this basic spelling
practice won’t seem arduous.
A happy, creative attitude distinguishes great teachers from merely okay
teachers. Keep a can-do and upbeat manner for your child as you do the 
226
Part IV: Using Word Families 

spellings together. Use different colored pens to write (and compare) words,
finger-write (no ink) on each other’s backs, and munch on favorite snacks
together.
Table 13-6

An interesting thing about “tongue” is that you pronounce it differently
depending on whether you mean the tongue in your mouth or the tongs you
serve food with.
Gnawing on a Sign
G has dominated two tables already in this chapter, and in Table 13-7, it part-
ners up with n. Show your child that anytime she writes these n-sounding
words, she, in fact, writes gn. That way she’s more at home with the “Writing
a loony letter” activity that comes next.
Table 13-7
Silent g

The time may come when your child writes words that have to do with bodily
stuff, in which she spells silent g followed by m (and has to feature ph, too).
Check out diaphragm and phlegm.
227
Chapter 13: Being Vocal about Silent Letters

Activity: Writing a loony letter
Preparation: Open this book to Tables 13-5 to 13-7, and grab pen and paper.
Follow this step: With your child, write a short letter. Aim to use at least ten
words from the tables. Your letter can be as absurd as you like. Here’s an
example:
Today, I lay in foreign champagne and then listened to a dialogue between
a gnat and a guard. The gnat gnawed on a catalogue, but I left in disguise
to paint my guitar. I didn’t design this letter, but I might sign it.
Guess who?
Combing the Lamb
The words in Table 13-8 aren’t common, but they’re distinctive. There doesn’t
seem to be a reason in the world for b to make an appearance in these words,
but it’s there anyway. Most children seem to remember these spellings best if
they start off by pronouncing that b until they remember to include it without
the whacky pronunciation. The activity that I give for silent-b words gets into
the whole pronunciation thing.
Table 13-8
Silent b
lamb
bomb
thumb
comb

Activity: To b or not to b
Preparation: Open your copy of Teaching Kids to Spell For Dummies to Table
13-8 and have pen and paper ready.
Follow this step: Dictate ten words from the table, but do it with either of
these two quirks:
 Pronounce the b. Ask your child to write the word and tell you how it
should really sound.
228
Part IV: Using Word Families 

 Spell out the word for your child (she can write it down) and ask him
how it’s pronounced.
Walking and Talking
Here’s a group of words to take your time with. You can skim over the less
common words in Table 13-9, but walk and talk and would, could, and should
are words that your child definitely needs to get familiar with. You’ll probably
notice psalm in this group. What a word! I’ve included it for interest, but it
isn’t included as one of the answers that your child needs to know in the
“Which word does this describe?” activity later in this section.

ould Words

One odd word in the silent-l group is salmon. You can’t make a family of
salmon-like words because no other word is very like salmon.
Activity: Which word does this describe?
Preparation: Make a copy of Table 13-9 and give it to your child, and then ask
her the ten questions.
Follow this step: Have your child write the answers to these questions:
1. What’s an eggy word?
2. Which three words rhyme with pud (like in pudding)?
3. What grows on a plant?
4. When you share a pie equally with one friend, how much of the pie do
you get?
5. What’s another word for people?
6. What can you write with?
229
Chapter 13: Being Vocal about Silent Letters

7. Which word has a pal in it (clue: pal)?
8. Which word is a homonym (sounds the same) for “wood?”
9. Which word is Something that can happen to a dead body?
10. Which word means too slow to be a jog?
Answers (in order): yolk; would, could, and should; stalk; half; folk; chalk; palm;
would; embalm; and walk.
Being Honest at the Exhibition
In the silent-h group you find interesting, not to mention hard, words. Ask
your child which ones he likes the look of or doesn’t, and which is the easi-
est, hardest, or most common word. When you and your child have scanned
through the words in Table 13-10, do the “Pictures and mnemonics” activity
at the end of this section and watch as your child’s artistic and cerebral sides
get cozy with one another.
Mnemonics are triggers (usually rhymes and codes) that people use to help
them remember stuff. The saying, “Spring forward, fall back” is a mnemonic
that helps you remember which way to change the setting of your clock in
spring and fall, and if you’re anything like me, you rely pretty heavily on
mnemonics to pass yourself off as someone who knows what he’s doing. 
Your child, pristine as his memory is, can use mnemonics, too. Two of the
words in Table 13-10 have their own mnemonics.
To help your child remember the difference between our and hour tell him
this:
There’s a hand in hour, like the hand on a clock.
This mnemonic is good for teaching your child to tell the time on an analog
clock, but the digital era may soon make it defunct.
To help your child remember how to spell rhythm, tell him this:
Rhythm helps your two hips move.
If your child decides that these mnemonics aren’t for him, that’s okay. In the
“Pictures and mnemonics” activity that follows, he can make up his own.
Activity: Pictures and mnemonics
Preparation: Turn in your book to Table 13-10 and have paper and pencil
ready.
230
Part IV: Using Word Families 

Follow this step: Tell your child about the hour and rhythm mnemonics ear-
lier in this section, and then ask him to think up some memory joggers for
words in the table. Can he draw word pictures (like lJJk!) or think of word-
play to help him remember the spellings of ghost, school, and exhibit?

Listening to Whistles
T is another silent letter that kids like to pronounce at first. You probably did
the same thing when you were a kid and may still say that silent sound in
your head when you’re writing it. Read through Table 13-11 with your child
then adapt the “To b or not to b” activity from earlier in this chapter into a
“To t or not to t” activity.

What should your child do to remember the spelling of the silent-p words?
Ask her. Have her tell you what her strategy is. Will she break the words up?
Will she highlight the tricky parts? Will exaggerated pronunciation help? Have
231
Chapter 13: Being Vocal about Silent Letters

her write the words a few times until she thinks she can remember them, and
then offer to test her in a few hours time to see if she still remembers. Run
through a game of “Eight-square bingo” (explained earlier in this chapter)
and make a bet with her. (You win; you get ice cream. I win; you get ice
cream!) Table 13-12 provides a collection of silent p words.

Feeling Solemn about the Column
This group of words is such a little one that it doesn’t even warrant a table.
But don’t be lulled into a false sense of security. The mn group of words is
definitely no less strange than the bigger groups. Your child won’t use these
words often but she’ll notice them when she does. The mn group is: hymn,
autumn, solemn, condemn, and column.
My guess is that column is the word she’ll have most need of — in math when
she plots graphs, puts numbers in tables, and does all manner of other
impressive math stuff. How will she remember the spellings? Ask her!
232

How many psychiatrists does it take . . .
Ending this chapter with my “Feeling solemn”
heading would be bleak of me, so I’m signing off
on a high note. Here, for your absolute enjoyment,
are two of my hugely funny jokes:
 How many psychiatrists does it take to
change a light bulb? Only one. But the bulb
has to want to change.
 Man to his psychiatrist: I keep thinking I’m
a dog.
 Psychiatrist: Lie down on the couch and I’ll
examine you.
 Man: I can’t. I’m not allowed on the furniture.

Chapter 14
Spelling Some Letters “Softly”
In This Chapter
 Recognizing soft sounds
 Understanding when to use soft spellings
 Distinguishing between soft and hard spellings
Question: Why shouldn’t you tell a pig a secret?
Answer: Because pigs are squealers!
I
’m sure you only entrust your secrets to trustworthy pigs, but have you
shared the soft-letter secret with your child? The secret is this: Only two
letters make a soft sound, and they do it only on occasion. I’m convinced that
this information is kept a secret from a lot of kids, because I see so many of
them writing soft letters all over the place. This chapter shows you how to
help your child ace it with the softies.
Hearing Hard and Soft Sounds
The two letters in the alphabet that make sounds called hard and soft sounds
are c and g. Your child already knows the hard sounds well. He learned them
when he learned his alphabet: “cuh” for the letter c and “guh” for the letter g.
Soft sounds are soft because they have a softer pronunciation than hard
sounds. The soft sound of c, is “ss,” and the soft sound of g is “juh.”
Relaxing with Identical Sounds
Here’s the rub with soft sounds: The sound “ss” is made by either s or c, and
“juh” is made by either j or g. So when does your child use c and not s? And
when does he use g and not j? Just how does it all work?

Ta-da. I come bearing rules! No need to call out the spelling squad or resort
to searching through the dreary dictionary; the next few pages help you tread
lightly, with your child, through soft and simple rules.
Scanning the Soft-c Rule
Words like cot, crate, and actor use hard (or regular) c. Words like receive,
race, and cylinder use soft c (which sounds like “ss”). Tell your child that
when he reads new words, he can tell when a letter is a softy by looking at
the letter right after it. The pattern or rule is:
When c is followed by e, i, or y, it usually says its soft sound.
Recognizing Soft-c Words
Isolated rules are hard to remember, and for that reason, you need to spend
plenty of time practicing these rules with your child. With that in mind, read
through all the words in Table 14-1 with your child and have her highlight the
ce, ci, or cy parts of all of them. When you’re done, zip to the “Spot the right
spelling” activity.

Part IV: Using Word Families 

The words receive, perceive, and niece follow the i-before-e-except-after-c rule.
The “Spot the right spelling” activity (coming up next) is quick and easy. Your
child must sort through words that all are phonetically fine (they sound-out
fine), but aren’t always spelled correctly.
Children’s spelling errors usually are phonetically accurate. Think about it;
they write words like thay and wur, which sound-out fine, but nevertheless
are spelled incorrectly. To be a good speller, your child needs to spot the
right spelling by writing out different possibilities. Seeing the differences in
written words is called visual discrimination, and matching the right sound
with a bunch of letters is called phonographics (or sometimes graphophonics).
Activity: Spotting soft c spellings
Preparation: Make a copy of the list of questions that follows and have a pen
or pencil ready for your child.
Follow this step: Ask your child to circle the right spelling. Give him “you’re
getting warmer (or colder)” hints whenever he needs them.
 fase — faice — face
 prince — prinse — prinss
 fence — fens — fense
 mice — mise — miyse
 surcus — curcus — circus
 spisee — spicy — spisey
 twise — twice — twyce
 circel — circle — sircle
 fansy — fansey — fancy
 spayce — spase — space
 reseve — receve — receive
 chanse — chanes — chance
 niece — neice — neece
 dance — danse — daence
 slise — slyce — slice
If your child wants a challenge, try dictating the correct words for him to
write out.
235
Chapter 14: Spelling Some Letters “Softly”

Writing Soft c Words
The two activities that I offer up next enable your child to practice writing
soft-c words from scratch. They’re basic dictation (reading out words for
your child to write) and proofreading (reading to spot errors) tasks, tweaked
here and there for more interest.
Dictation and proofreading are the mainstays of any spelling program. The
more of them your child does, the better she gets at spelling.
Activity: Dictated spellings
Preparation: Turn in this book to Table 14-1 and have a piece of paper and a
pen or pencil ready for your child to use.
Follow this step: Dictate words from Table 14-1 for your child to write but
vary the way you dictate by:
1. Reading words together in families (ice, mice, and nice).
2. Giving clues rather than words, like, “You put this into your drink to
make it cold.”
3. Acting out or miming some words (dance, face, lice, race, circle, or circus).
Activity: Silly sentences
Preparation: Make a copy of the list of questions that follow, and have some
highlighters on hand for your child to use.
Follow these steps:
1. Have your child read the sentences and highlight the right answer
from the two possibilities. 
2. Have him finger-write five answers on your back for you to figure out.
(Unlike finger painting, finger writing is impressing letters with your
finger, no ink!)
• Give me a second chance — hopping.
• We ate chicken with rice — trees.
• I’ve been to Disneyland cookies — twice.
• The rocket flew into buckets — space.
• The plumber had to fix the cistern — donkey.
236
Part IV: Using Word Families 

• The runner set a fast pace — pumpkin.
• In math, I drew a circle — talking.
• The skater stepped onto the lemon — ice.
• Her birthday cake was fancy — grass.
• I live in the telephone — city.
• Her name was Stacy — book.
• She had pet mice — wheels.
Deciding Whether to Write c or s
The next activity is a fun story for your child to correct. I’ve left s and (soft) c
out all over the place, so your child has to put on his thinking cap and really
get out there!
Activity: Tackling a tampered-with story
Preparation: Make a copy of “Prince Stan and Cindy The Soccer Ace.”
Follow this step: Ask your child to read the story and change every * (aster-
isk) to an s or c to make the missing ss sound. Advise him to use scrap paper
to scribble down the two possible answers when he isn’t sure which one’s
right.
Prince Stan and Cindy The Soccer Ace
Prin*e *tan’s father, King Lee, wanted hi* *on to play *occer *o the
people in his kingdom could *ee him beat other *occer teams and do
*ome fan*y footwork. *o the King *ent Prin*e *tan off to *occer *chool.
But Prin*e *tan was awful at *occer. He lost all the training ra*es and
couldn’t keep up the pa*e. In fact he would much rather have been cook-
ing. Prin*e *tan was a great cook. He cooked ri*e with a lot of ta*ty spi*es
and baked a ni*e cu*tard sli*e too. Cooking was a *inch for the prin*e but
at *occer *chool he was miserable. Then the prin*e met *indy. *indy
loved *occer. She could dan*e the ball around all the other players’ feet
and could run twi*e as fast as any of them. Because *indy was always
playing *occer she was always *tarving. So Prin*e *tan (who thought
*indy was cute) cooked her his famou* cu*tard *li*e. In*tantly she fell in
love with him. You know what happens next don’t you. They got married

Chapter 14: Spelling Some Letters “Softly”

Scanning the Soft g Rule
Words like gum, grate, and aggressive use hard (or regular) g. Words like gem,
giant, and gym use soft g (which sounds like “juh”). The pattern or rule is:
If g says its soft sound, it’s usually followed by e, i, or y. (The same goes for c.)
Recognizing Soft g Words
Read through all the words in Table 14-2 with your child and have him high-
light the ge, gi, or gy parts of each one. When your child’s pretty comfortable
with how that g makes its appearance, speed forward to the “Spotting the
right spelling” activity.
Your child needs to jot down any words he thinks are particularly sneaky 
(I’d opt for giraffe and general). Whenever he writes them out a few times,
he’s more likely to keep them in his mind for future reference.

The activity I provide for you here is another proofreading activity. I include
proofreading all through this book because there’s no better way to help your
child get into the habit of checking his own spelling. Developing a good eye is
a big part of being a good speller, so have your child get down and get
focused!
Activity: Spotting soft g spellings
Preparation: Make a copy of the list of questions that follow, and have a pen
or pencil ready for your child to use.
Follow this step: Ask your child to circle the right spellings.
 page — paje — paydge
 bulge — bulje — buldge

Chapter 14: Spelling Some Letters “Softly”

Writing Soft g Words
The “3 by 3 by 3” activity is a short thinker of an exercise. Although your
child has only a little writing to do, she must get it right.
Activity: 3 by 3 by 3
Preparation: Open your copy of Teaching Kids to Spell For Dummies to this
activity and have paper and pen ready.
Follow these steps:
1. Show your child the three word endings that follow. 
2. Have him write three words in each group in less than three minutes.
1. _age
2. _edge
3. gen_
The “Imagining sentences” activity up next fires up your child’s imagination.
She has to put some soft g words together to make sentences. The sillier or
more impossible the sentence, the better.
Activity: Imagining sentences
Preparation: Have your book open to this page and paper and pen in hand
Follow this step: Ask your child to look at Table 14-2 and make up five
“Imagine . . . ” sentences from the words. For example, you can write:
 Imagine a huge, million-dollar gem.
 Imagine two fragile giraffes.
 Imagine a bag bulging with magic.
If your child groans at the prospect of writing the sentences, offer to be her
secretary. Write the sentences for her, asking her to spell out the soft-g
words.
Deciding Whether to Write g or j
The “Fixing a muddle” activity asks your child to quickly sort through and
write a few words that feature g’s and j’s. The more practice your child gets
at writing g or j, the better he gets.

I’m not totally heartless. I know that the activities in this chapter have leaned
more toward the sit-down-and-write side, so I’m lightening up here. Here’s a
fun game that you and your child can play with soft-c words, soft-g words, or
a mixed bunch of both.
Activity: Chutes and ladders with chances
Preparation: You can use a commercial Chutes and Ladders board or make
your own, along with a cup and a dice. 
1. Write instructions on 20 index cards. 
2. Write five sets of four identical cards with the following instructions
on them: “Miss a turn,” “Move forward five squares,” “Move back five
squares,” “Spell three soft-c words,” and “Spell three soft-g words.” 
3. Shuffle this pack of “Chance” cards at the start of the game.
241
Chapter 14: Spelling Some Letters “Softly”

Follow these steps:
1. Play Chutes and Ladders in the normal way, but mark ten of the
squares on your board as “Chance” squares. Mark random squares
with a sticker, or nominate every tenth square; either way works. 
2. When players land on a chance square, they pick up a chance card
and do what it says. No player can spell the same word twice, and if a
player can’t answer his card, he stays on the chance square and answers
a new card when it’s his turn again.
You can find another version of “Chutes and ladders” in Chapter 20.

Spelling Words 
in Chunks

In this part . . .
G
ood spellers spell words chunk by chunk. But where
are the best places to break words up? That’s the
question. The chapters in this part show you not only
where to put those breaks but also how to avoid doing
bad things to nice suffixes and how to handle your con-
tractions, too.

Chapter 15
Cheerfully Chunking Sounds
In This Chapter
 Developing an ear for chunks of sound or syllables
 Discovering the do’s and don’ts of syllables
 Making friends with popular syllables
C
hildren who struggle with spelling often jumble up their syllables. They
hear sledding and write selding, or solding. It isn’t a big deal if your child
sometimes makes mistakes through rushing (I do it all hte tiem), but it is a big
deal if she can’t hear the sounds in a word and then write them down in order.
In this chapter, I show you how to help your child hear, arrange, and write
down the chunks of sound inside of words. I walk you through the rules of
how to break words up into nice little chunks of sound and let you decide
whether you can use those rules a lot or a little. The rules may make perfect
sense to you, or you may decide to ad lib now and then.
Syllables or Chunks of Sound
Words are made up of chunks of sound called syllables. You and your child
need to spend plenty of time among these chunks, because good spellers
spell in chunks. If you’re not sure which piece of a word is a syllable, remem-
ber that a syllable has to have a vowel in it. That’s all you really need to know
to start with.
The letter y is a special one. When it sounds like a vowel, you count it as a
vowel. Words like myself (my-self) and Sally (Sal-ly) use y as a vowel in one of
their syllables.
Hearing Syllables in Words
The best place for your child to start exploring syllables is in his ears. Your
child must first hear the chunks of sound inside words before he can write

them. Where long words are concerned, he needs to be extra tuned in,
because he needs to hear and correctly write down three or more syllables.
The next activity is every teacher’s warm-up game for syllables — the clap-
ping game. All your child has to do is clap out the number of syllables he
hears in a word.
Activity: Clapping out syllables
Preparation: Open your copy of Teaching Kids to Spell For Dummies to this
activity.
Follow these steps:
1. Describe the following name steps to your child (recommended dialog
is in quotations). When you’re done with the names I give you, use other
names you know.
1. “Listen to this: Ken (Clap once). John (Clap once). Kate (Clap
once). Lynn (Clap once). Ja-son (Clap twice). Sal-ly (Clap twice).
Ash-ley (Clap twice).”
2. Clap your first name, then have your child clap out her own name.
3. Clap three other names that you know, and have your child clap
out names she knows.
2. Take turns clapping out names. Have fun with names like Elizabeth
(“Ee-liz-uh-beth”) and try big words like Mis-sis-sip-pi and tar-ran-tu-la.
Soup up this game by including middle and last names.
Keeping Letter Friends Together
Help your child write down the syllables he hears by pointing out a few spe-
cial characteristics about syllables. First, tell him about the vowel thing: All
syllables have a vowel in them. Next, show your child that when he’s writing
down syllables, some letters are never parted. Buddies like ck and ch are
never apart from each other. They belong together always like milk and cook-
ies, and they count as one letter. The letter friends in this category are:
 ck (tick-et, pock-et, sick-en)
 ex (ex-it, ex-act, ex-am)
 Consonant digraphs (ch, sh, th, wh, and ph)
 Vowel digraphs (like au, ar, and oi)
246
Part V: Spelling Words in Chunks 

 Consonant blends (like bl, pr, and st)
 Whole words inside compound words (like camp-fire, sea-shore, and pan-
cake)
 Prefixes (like dis, re, and un — to name a few)
 Suffixes (like ing, er, and est)
A digraph is simply two letters together making one new sound. All the scary-
sounding terms like prefix, suffix, and diphthong simply describe little chunks
of sound that are common and therefore good to know about. Helping your
child write bunches of ai, au, and oi words and chop words into chunks is
perfectly okay, and probably best, without ever uttering the words “digraph”
or “syllable.”
This keeping-friends-together rule actually looks harder than it really is.
When you start breaking words up, you hear and see that most breaks occur
in pretty obvious spots. If you’re not sure, put the break wherever it makes
sense to you.
I provide you with examples of keeping letter-friends together in two-syllable
words that I examine in the next paragraphs. Before that, though, I talk a bit
about one-syllable words. When your child spells a word comprised of one
syllable, she won’t need to remember much. She doesn’t need to put any
breaks at all in one-syllable words.
One Syllable Is a Cinch
One-syllable words look like this: Sam. Pete, and Tris; green, blue, and pink;
milk, cream, and egg; bat, ball, and net; and crunch, shout, and spin. These
words are made of one straight, unsplit sound. Your child simply says the
whole word and writes it down. What could be easier? Run through one-
syllable words with your child, and if a word has a blend (str, dr) or digraph
(ch, sh, ai, au) in it, point this out to her. You don’t have to say, “Here’s a
digraph,” but just show her that you can see a tricky little part of the word
(that’s really what a digraph is) and what it is. Have your child spot and high-
light that tricky part. To help her remember the digraph better, take time out
and make word families. If your child is writing dream have her highlight the
ea part and take a quick run through the ea word family (mean, cream,
clean). With night have her highlight ight and take a foray into sight, fight, and
might. (You can find the ea word family in Chapter 8 and in Chapter 11 I
tackle the ight family)
247
Chapter 15: Cheerfully Chunking Sounds

Two Syllables Are a Pic-nic
Two-syllable words (or words you break into two chunks) are pretty easy, but
several kinds of them are out there. Take a look at the next bulleted list to 
get the general idea, and then move to the explanations in the sections that
follow. You can store this information in your mind for the next time your
child needs to spell a word like account (ac-count) or lead her through the
exercises that I give you so she’s forearmed. Here they are then, categories 
of two-syllable words that you’ll come across:
 Compound words (nowhere: no-where)
 Words with a double letter in the middle (letter: let-ter)
 Words with two consonants in the middle (picnic: pic-nic)
 Words with first syllables that have open vowels (remind: re-mind)
 Words starting with a prefix (invest: in-vest)
 Words ending with a suffix (spying: spy-ing)
Cruising through compound words
The easiest two-syllable word of all is a compound word. A compound word
is a big word made of two smaller single-syllable words joined together. When
you help your child spell a compound word, all she has to do is write the two
distinct words it’s made of. The two separate words will be obvious to your
child but he may be uncertain of the spelling for each one. Have him cast his
eye over each word’s features. Are any digraphs lurking in there (ch, sh, ea,
ai, aw, or ar)? What about double letters (egg-shell)? Is a y making a vowel
sound (my-self)? Table 15-1 shows the easy breaks in compound words and
the spelling features on which your child can focus. After the table, I give you
a nice quiet activity and then a runaround one.

In the “Spelling compound words” activity your child takes a close look at the
words in Table 15-1 and then breaks them up and spells them for herself.
Always give your child instruction and practice with words before asking him
to spell them for himself
Activity: Spelling compound words
Preparation: Open this book to Table 15-1 and have paper and pen for each
of you (or a whiteboard) and a color highlighter. You’re going to look at the
tricky parts (like ai and ow) in these compound words. If you want to recap
on the when-two-vowels-go-walking rule, flip to Chapter 8. To find out more
about word families, scan Chapter 10.
Follow these steps (recommended dialog is in quotations):
1. On your paper, write the word “bookshelf” for your child to see.
2, Explain that, “Bookshelf is made of two small words.”
3. Tell your child to “draw a line to break bookshelf into two small
words.”
4. Repeat this routine with the remaining seven words (raincoat, tea-
spoon, moonlight, wheelchair, downhill, myself, quicksand).
5. Be sure your child knows to “mark any special letters you see in each
word.” Help your child find the spelling features. (I show them to you
in the third column of Table 15-1.) Talk about why they’re special.
6. Say, “Now I’ll read each word out, and you write it down.” Dictate
each word for your child to write. If he struggles, let him look at the
word before trying again.
Every spelling feature in Table 15-1 belongs in a word family. If your child
can’t spell the hard part (the spelling feature) of a word, have him practice
writing word families. If he writes whealchair, practice a bunch of ee and ea
words so he develops a better eye for picking ee or ea. If he writes moonlite,
write some ight words. And if he’s weak with c’s, k’s, and ck’s, write words
with the “cuh” sound in them and spot any patterns. (When words with one
syllable end with the cuh sound, they’re nearly always spelled ck (brick, sock,
duck, and neck).
249
Chapter 15: Cheerfully Chunking Sounds

Activity: Making sense
Preparation: Print each of the six words from Table 15-1 (in large letters) on
one piece of paper. Cut each word into its two component words. In six differ-
ent places around the room or house, put a mismatched beginning and end,
like rain-self. Make sure that you have a watch or timer.
Follow this step: Ask your child to find the mismatched word parts and
rearrange them into the six real words, all within a time limit perhaps three
minutes.
Dealing with double letters
When you spell a two-syllable word that has a double consonant (ll, tt, or, pp)
in the middle, break the word between those consonants. Table 15-2 gives
you plenty of double-consonant words to read through with your child. When
you’ve had a good look at all the double-letter words, move on to the “Twins
(spelling double-consonant words)” activity.

The “Twins” activity asks your child to find things, and as you know, finding
things is fun, so any time your child dozes while working on a spelling list
(not mine of course!), chop out the words, hide them, and have her run
around finding them so she’s reinvigorated to tackle them again.
Activity: Twins (Spelling double-consonant words)
Do every practical step in this activity with your child, but make sure each of
you is using your own paper so you’re working on “twins.”
250
Part V: Spelling Words in Chunks 

Preparation: Each of you needs paper and pen (or a whiteboard) and a col-
ored highlighter. Neatly print the whole words (not the split-up versions)
from Table 15-2 onto your paper and have your child do the same.
Follow these steps (recommended dialog is in quotations):
1. Ask your child, “What’s the same about every word?”
2. Tell him to: “Break each word between the double letters.”
3. As you do the same, have your child: “Draw a line between the middle
letters.”
4. Next both of you need to: “Look at the word hollow. Highlight the ow
part.”
5. Say, “Highlight two other words that end with the same ow ending.”
Both of you need to highlight pillow and yellow.
6. Say, “Find happen. Highlight en. Find five other words in Table 15-2
that end with en.” Both of you find hidden, kitten, mitten, pollen, and
written.
When your child groups like words together (bitten, kitten, mitten, and
written, for example), he makes a word family. If you buy him several dif-
ferent-colored highlighters, he can highlight each word family in its own
color.
7. Say, “Now we can spell the words for ourselves.”
8. Say, “I’ll read a word out and you write it down. Then you read me a
word and I’ll write it down.”
Read the words with normal pronunciation first, and then as two distinct syl-
lables if your child needs you to.
If your child doesn’t quickly grasp these spellings, repeat the words with her
one or two more times so she gains more confident and fluency. As a rule 
of thumb with any teaching, instruct your child, and make sure you give her
plenty of practice, before testing her.
The “High five” activity that I give next is a quick, fun way to consolidate
what your child has just experienced in the “Twins” activity. It’s a spelling
test turned into a quiz.
“High five” has your child drop coins into a mug whenever he gives correct
answers. If you’d prefer not to use rewards, privileges, and that kind of stuff,
you’ll want to make modifications to this activity. Maybe a star chart suits
you better? Or maybe you plan to do a shared thing like playing ball when
your child does a good job? The key is doing something, anything, to show
your child you’re proud of him (and that spelling can be fun).
251

252
Part V: Spelling Words in Chunks 
Activity: High five
Preparation: Open your book to the list of questions for this activity and
have paper and pen (or a whiteboard) handy for each of you, and a mug or
bowl and some pennies (or marbles).
Follow these steps (recommended dialogue is in quotations):
1. Say to your child: “I’m going to ask you five questions. If you write the
right answer, I’ll tell you, and you get to drop a penny into the mug.
After five correct answers, you choose whether to stop or take three
bonus questions.”
If your child stops after five questions she keeps the coins she’s col-
lected. If she goes on to the bonus questions she gets extra pennies. If
she gives an incorrect answer she simply loses out on that penny.
2. Write down the answer, too, so you can show your child the answer
after each question.
Little kids may simply want to keep the coins at the end of this game. Give
them a piggy bank and start a penny collection. Older kids can trade in their
coins for privileges. Have privileges worked out in advance so you don’t, in
an absent-minded moment, get conned into doling out 3 a.m. bedtimes or 60
bags of candy.
1. This tool is used with nails (hammer).
2. Put this object under your head when you go to bed (pillow).
3. A baby cat (kitten).
4. A color beginning with y (yellow).
5. Wear these to keep your hands warm (mittens).
6. Bees gather this from flowers (pollen).
7. You buy water in this (bottle).
8. The real name for a bunny (rabbit).
Finish this section with the “Right or wrong?” activity, which asks your child
to spot spelling errors. Proofreading is such a great way to improve spelling.
Activity: Right or wrong?
Preparation: Turn your book in to your child for this activity but cover over
the answers at the end of the word list, and give your child a pencil and
paper.
Follow these steps: 

1. Keeping the answers (written at the end of the word list) to this quiz
covered with a sheet of paper, tell your child to find the five errors in
the word list and write the correct words on his paper. 
2. When he’s done, have him move the paper to check his answers.
Word List:
• patern
• bottle
• runner
• willing
• yelow
• cabbage
• errand
• shellter
• pillo
• surffer
Answers: These five spellings are wrong: patern, yelow, pillo, shellter, and surffer
Taking on two consonants
When your child spells out a word with two consonants, side by side in the
middle, she breaks the word into syllables between those consonants (just
like she did with two identical consonants).
The rule about breaking a word into syllables between two consonants is
known as the VCCV rule (V stands for vowel, C stands for consonant). When
you spell a word that has the VCCV pattern in it (starting at the first vowel),
you break it into syllables between the two consonants (VC — CV). Table 15-2
shows you how it works. Don’t stress too much over the VCCV formula,
though, because although it’s important for your child to break words up, it
isn’t important that he always puts the break in the right place.
The VCCV pattern begins with the first vowel in the word.
Table 15-3 gives you a whole bunch of words to look at with your child before
tackling the activities that use them.

Breaking words into syllables is a strategy that helps your child spell. If your
child decides that carp-et works fine for him, don’t insist that he use the
strictly correct break of car-pet. Instead have him practice breaking words up
in ways he chooses for himself and feels comfortable with.
The “Choosing your spelling list” activity is a quiet, straightforward one, but
your child gets to choose her own spelling list and can reduce the number of
words she must spell.
Beware of taking over this activity. Watch out that you don’t slip into the
habit of holding onto lists, books, and pens when you can let your child do so
for himself. Such small acts of ownership are important. Your child needs to
own his learning — so back off!
Activity: Choosing your spelling list
Preparation: Open your book to Table 15-3 and look at it with your child.
Follow these steps (recommended dialog is in quotations):
1. Say to your child: “Choose two columns for a spelling list. You’ll write
those words but you can cut down the total number you have to write
to only one column.”
2. Next tell your child: “If you get all the words in the first column right,
you’re done!”
3. Take away the book and dictate his chosen words to him. Finish up
when he gets the entire first column right, or proceed on to the second
column if he doesn’t.

Chapter 15: Cheerfully Chunking Sounds
Kids, especially younger ones, get upset when they make spelling mistakes. If
you see your child writing the wrong spelling, pronounce the word in an exag-
gerated way that helps him spell it right; write down any distinct sound (like
ou) so he can put it into his word (mountain, for example); focus on success,
and be generous with your help. Oh, and be sensitive. Don’t say things like “Of
course it isn’t spelled like that! Here let me (Ms. I-Know-It-All-And-You-Don’t).
Hearing open vowels
Consider the words direct, reply, and over. They all have an open vowel. An
open vowel is a vowel that stands alone, without a letter following it, after
you’ve put in a syllable break (di-rect, re-ply, and o-ver). You put the syllable
break right after an open vowel and pronounce the vowel in its long form.
Many words have open vowels. Table 15-4 gives you some of them and the
“Easy, medium, and hard” activity that follows goes with it.
The formula for this kind of word is the “VCV” rule. When you see the VCV
combo, starting with the first vowel in the word, break it into V-CV. In words
like apron and maple the consonant blends (in this case pr and pl) are treated
as one consonant.

Read through Table 15-4 with your child. Point out to her that notice, decide,
and replace all use soft c. Notice is tricky, too, because you’d expect the ice
part to sound like the cold stuff, but it isn’t! Next up, the “Easy, medium, and
hard” activity asks your child to look carefully at Table 15-4 and decide for
herself what is tricky and what isn’t.

256
Part V: Spelling Words in Chunks 
Activity: Easy, medium, and hard
Preparation: Make a copy of Table 15-4 and place it in front of you with some
highlighters. (You can quickly write a neat copy; you don’t have to wear a
path to the copy machine at the library.)
Follow these steps:
1. Give Table 15-4 and three highlighters to your child. Her task is to
color the easiest words in one color, medium difficulty words in another,
and the hardest words in the third color.
2. When your child has chosen and colored her three groups, tell her,
“Now I’ll read the words for you to write, but you get to choose which
group (easy, middle or hard) you want to write first.”
3. Have your child write all the words. Give her tips whenever she needs
them. Say things like, “Watch out for the s sound, it can be made by s or
c,” or “Watch out for ee on the end of a word; which letter makes that
sound on the end of words?” or “Take care with pair, that “air” sound
can be spelled ear, are, or air.”
Some word beginnings and endings have vowels in them that are barely pro-
nounced at all or are pronounced as “uh.” The technical word for this pronun-
ciation is the schwa sound. Some words with the “uh” or schwa sound are:
across, ago, again, away, and control.
When you see an a on the end of a word, it’s nearly always pronounced “uh.”
too. Try gorilla, zebra, Canada, Austria, Australia, Uganda, and Nevada, as
examples.
For some of the words in this chapter, you may want to revise the y-behaving-
as-a-vowel rule: When your child hears ee at the end of a word that’s more
than one syllable, it’s written with a y (sto-ny, na-vy). When she hears the long
i sound at the end of words, it’s made with y, too (re-ply).
Putting prefixes first
By now you’ve probably noticed that when you split words up, small prefixes
like dis and re are never broken up; they stay whole. You can hear this undi-
vided sound when you say the words, so teaching your child to break a word
after the prefix is easy. Table 15-5 gives you some examples and the “Sorting
prefixes” activity follows it.
A prefix is a chunk of letters that comes at the front of words. Among the
more common ones are un, dis, and re. A prefix changes the meaning of the
word (or word base).
Part V: Spelling Words in Chunks 

257
Chapter 15: Cheerfully Chunking Sounds
You hear me mention root words now and then. A root word is the original
word to which beginnings and endings have been attached. In discontented,
the root word is content.

Straight spelling tests aren’t hugely fun for your child, but finding and sorting
are fun, and running definitely is fun! The “Sorting prefix” and “Prefix run”
activities ask your child to sort a few words before she spells them. As she
sorts, she’ll look carefully at the words so she’s warmed up for the spelling.
Then, when she needs to stretch her legs, she gets to do a few sprints.
Activity: Sorting prefixes
Preparation: Make a copy of Table 15-5 and have some highlighters ready.
Give the table to your child.
Being a great spelling snoop
Helping your child to spell is all about finding
what he’s shaky at and making things clearer for
him. When you know the rules and tips in this
book (Bossy e; When two vowels go walking, the
first one does the talking; and y behaving like a
vowel), you can remind your child of them when-
ever he needs them. You can run through a few
word families with him so he can practice apply-
ing the rules. You can remind him that when he’s
in doubt, the best strategy is to write the spelling
options he has in mind and try to spot the one
that looks right. And that’s largely what good
spelling is about — trying out the options.

Follow these steps (recommended dialog is in quotations):
1. Say to your child: “Read the words to me.”
2. Explain that: “Each word has two, three, or four syllables (or parts).”
3. Tell him to: “Choose a color for all the words with two syllables and
color them. Use another color for words with three syllables and
another color for words with four syllables.”
Give your child time to finish the 24 words.
4. Say, “Now I’ll read the words for you to write. Which group (two,
three, or four syllable) shall I read out first?”
5. Dictate the words for your child to write.
If your child can’t easily read the words in Table 15-5, sound out each syllable
for and with him and explain and practice any tricky sounds (like the oi in
disappoint).
If your child’s taking these words in stride and you think he’d enjoy a chal-
lenge, ask him to try some of these words: unconstitutional, unconventional,
uninspired, unimpressed, unperturbed, and unintelligible.
Activity: Prefix run
Preparation: Copy the words from Table 15-5 and cut each one out. Put the
words into a bowl. Make three signs with the numbers 2, 3, and 4 (represent-
ing the number of syllables in a word). Make sure you have a watch or timer.
Follow these steps:
1. Put the bowl at one end of a room and the three signs at another. The
bowl is the starting point, and you’ll time your child from the time she
leaves the bowl until she returns to it. 
2. Your child takes a word from the bowl and drops it on the right sign. 
3. If the word has two syllables she runs to the sign marked with a 2,
and so on. 
4. She keeps running back for each word and dropping it onto a number
then when all the words are dropped, she runs to the bowl and takes
it with her to gather up the groups of words. 
5. When she reaches the spot where the bowl sat she’s done . . . except
that you have her take three words, without looking, and spell them
to you! Errors earn her a sprint.

this table is definitely for you. I haven’t included every prefix but pretty
nearly every one.

If your child struggles with spelling, stay calm. Let
her know that nearly everybody struggles with
spelling at some time. Tell her that spelling is like
figuring out a maze. She has to try several routes
to find the right one. After she’s found her way,
though, she can find it easier the next time. If your
child is disheartened or resistant, don’t battle with
her. Keep things sweet; bargain with her; if nec-
essary pay her! Ideals like never bribing your
child (remember vowing that before you had real
live kids?) can be hard on you. Keeping your child
happy and a continued spelling participant, with
a judicious carrot-and-stick approach, is easier,
especially when you know your carrots.

Quickly peering at suffixes
I talk about suffixes (or word endings) in Chapter 16, but here’s a preliminary
peek: Suffixes are word endings like ed, ing, ant, and ness. Your child can
quickly get used to writing them, because they behave predictably. Your child
just has to latch them onto the ends of words, making tweaks now and then,
like when a root word ends in e. Chapter 16 gives you the details and plenty
of activities for your child to run through.
Three or More Syllables 
Are Pre-dict-a-ble
Little kids love to ask you if you can spell supercalafragalisticexpialidoceous.
Thankfully, when I’ve spelled that word for a child, Mary Poppins has been 
so busy getting children to tidy their closets that she hasn’t seen my spelling.
But even if that weren’t so, I wouldn’t be all that worried. Although big words
often look imposing, they’re really no harder than smaller words. The same
breaking-up rules apply, except that you do the breaking-up a few more times.
So, now that you know how easy the big words really are, you won’t be con-
cerned by the ones in Table 15-7 or the “Demon dozen” activity that follows it.

The le ending is grouped with the letter in front of it (ble, dle).
Pronounce tion as “shun.”
Some long vowel sounds inside words are written with only one vowel: di-rec-
tion, con-tam-in-a-tion, com-bin-a-tion, in-fla-ta-ble.
If you like the VCCV and VCV formulas, here’s how they work in big words.
(This stuff is deluxe technical so skip past it unless you’re keen!) Look at the
first vowel in a big word and decide what formula you have (VCCV or VCV).
Break the word into VC-CV or V-CV then start over again at the last vowel of
the first syllable. This comparison chart shows you the steps in breaking up
words, using these two formulas.
Your child doesn’t need to wrestle with these syllables. If prom-o-tion and
sup-er-vise suit her (rather than the linguistically correct pro-mo-tion and su-
per-vise), she need not try to spell according to linguistics books. Whichever
way she achieves the right spelling is the right way for her.
The “Demon dozen” activity eases your child into big words, giving her the
spellings to view, break up, take a good look at, and then write out for herself.
262
Part V: Spelling Words in Chunks 
Part V: Spelling Words in Chunks 

Activity: Demon dozen
Preparation: Make a copy of Table 15-7, and have some highlighters ready for
your child to use.
Follow these steps:
1. Give Table 15-7 to your child and ask her to read the words from any
one column to you. These words are her “demon dozen.” 
2. Listen to your child read the words, and help her sound out any sylla-
bles she doesn’t know. Have her highlight any tricky word parts. 
3. After she’s had a good look at each word, tell her she can practice the
three hardest words with the look, cover, and write routine. Now, can
she spell the demon dozen with a score of at least 10 words spelled cor-
rectly out of the 12? 
4. Dictate the words for your child to write, giving her clues and pro-
nouncing the syllables clearly. You can work on the other two columns
of words later.
Look, cover, and write is a simple routine for remembering spellings. Your
child looks at a word, covers it, and writes it from memory. The trick with
this technique is looking for spelling features, sounding out where you can,
and then writing the word several times.
If your child gets flustered when you time him, forget about racing the clock.
Instead you may like to add some pep by simply saying things like, “Wow,
you’re really taking on a challenge here!” or “You’re doing so well with these
words; even I find them hard.”
Quickly Revising Key Spelling Patterns
When your child breaks words up, she gets to know all sorts of sounds and
rules and becomes a better speller. You’re one step ahead, though. When
she’s stuck, you give her a quick explanation and maybe a word family. If your
child can’t spell explanation, you say: “Ex is easy. Plan in easy, too, and ay is
written with just the letter a. Shun is written tion, just like in action, fraction,
and mention.” This one-step-ahead-of-you version may sound optimistic right
now, but you’ll find on-the-spot instruction easier as time goes by. To inspire
(and calm) you right now, Table 15-8 lists bite-sized pieces of good advice to
give to your child.

Quick and Easy Spelling Tips

How It Works (In Brief)
Open vowels: 
Write the ay sound in the middle of words as a. 
ex-plan-a-tion, o-pen
Long, open vowels start words like a-corn and
o-pen.
Keeping the vowel short: 
In words like hop, double the last letter before 
hopping, skipping
adding an ending (to get hopping not hoping).
Making hoping, latest, 
To add an ending that starts with a vowel to a 
and lovable
word that already ends with e, lop off the e.
tion
It’s sound is shun!
“Uh” on the end: 
“Uh” on the end of words (especially country 
Canada, Austria
names) is written a.
c or ck: brick, clock, picnic
It’s always ck on the end of short vowel words of
only one syllable.
q: queen, quick
q never goes anywhere without u. Handy words
to teach are quiet and quite.
The sounds of s: boys, brushes
The ez sound in words like foxes and finishes
always is written es not ez.
The sounds of ed: lasted, 
Always write ed as though you hear ed (lasted), 
napped, jammed
t (napped), or d (jammed). The family that breaks
this rule is: crept, wept, and slept.
le an al: little, bottle, principal
When it sounds like ul, its written le or al.
The sounds of y: cry, happy
Write y on the end of short words that end in 
(also, short i: mystery, system)
“eye” (cry) and on the end of longer words that
end in “ee” (silly). 
If you don’t know; have a go: 
Jot down the ways that a word might be spelled. 
boyl, boil, boyal, boyle
Choose the version that looks right.
To finish this chapter, I show you a great game for two players — “Mancala
Spellorama!” It takes a bit of preparation, but after that’s done, you’ll love it. If
you’re a teacher, you can send two kids to a corner with this game and know
they’ll be gainfully occupied for at least 20 minutes.
Activity: Mancala Spellorama!
If your kids play Mancala, you’ll probably recognize this game. It’s a spelling
version of Mancala, except that you make your own board and the pieces you
move around are rolled up words.
Part V: Spelling Words in Chunks 

Preparation: Onto a piece of cardboard or poster paper, have your players
draw 12 rectangles in 2 rows of 6. They can color and decorate them, if they’d
like; it’s their game board. Now write 24 words on 24 small pieces of paper
and roll each one up. Give each player a bowl or lunchbox with some of the
rolled up words in it. You’re set!
Follow these steps:
1. Have each player sit at a short end of the board facing each other.
Players put two words in each of the 12 compartments until all 24 
words are on the board, 2 in each rectangle. The players’ homes are
their respective bowls, which are placed directly in front of where 
they are sitting, in view of the board.
2. Player one picks up the two words in any compartment. He moves his
hand to the next compartment, going clockwise, and drops one word in
it. He keeps doing this, dropping a word in each compartment he passes.
When he passes his home spot (after he’s gone all around the board), he
drops a word into the bowl, too. (He doesn’t drop a word into his oppo-
nent’s home spot, because the point of the game is to get the most
words into your own home.)
3. From the last compartment in which he drops a word, he picks up all
the words (three). He keeps moving and dropping words until the com-
partment into which he drops his last word has only that one word in 
it or he’s dropped his last word in his home. Play now moves to player
two.
4. Player two starts with any compartment she wants and moves around
the board in exactly the same way.
5. When all the words are in the two homes, players count their words
without opening them, write down their scores, and then pass their
pile to their opponent.
6. Next, players take turns reading each other’s words out loud for their
opponents to spell. Players write down their spellings, and score 1 point
for each correct spelling.
7. Score this game depending on how old your kids are. Be tough on
older kids and don’t give them second chances. (They usually prefer 
it that way.) Have younger kids simply help each other out when they
make mistakes. They keep giving clues until the right answer surfaces.
Explain the scoring system to your kids so you can avoid disputes. Be clear
that no arguing is allowed (and enforce dire penalties for miscreants!). For
more spice, don’t put words on all 24 pieces of paper; instead, write your own
special instructions, such as “Give yourself two points, or “No spelling =
score 0,” or “Lose 1 point.”

Finishing Off with Suffixes
In This Chapter
 Seeing the big picture of suffixes
 Sorting through similar suffixes
 Adding on and dropping off the right letters
A
dding endings (or suffixes) to words is a bit like adding accessories to
your outfit. If you add the right hat and shoes, you walk with a spring 
in your step. If you’re not sure whether this goes with that, you’re more of a
slouch. When you spell, it’s the same. If you’re not sure whether to finish your
word with able or ible, you’re unsettled. Have you chosen your ending wisely?
Will an error matter very much? Should you get out of your seat right now and
find that dictionary once and for all? This chapter takes you through the suffix
spelling rules so you can help your child spell — with perk, not plod — all the
right word endings.
An Ending by Any Other Name
I am sitting; I sat; I will sit. Remember dozing off when your teacher went over
verb conjugations and tenses in school? You learned plenty of words back
then. Some, like conjunction and preposition, went straight in one ear and
straight out the other (at least they did for me). You were able to get the hang
of what to write, but it wasn’t because of all those terms. In this chapter, I
don’t get caught up with grammatical terms. Instead, I talk about word end-
ings. Strictly speaking, they’re suffixes, and they change according to what
tense you’re using and whether you’re making plurals. Even so, they’re still
word endings. Relax, put drab classroom memories behind you, and skip
among perky little endings like ed, able, and tion.
A verb is a doing word like run. When you change the tense of your words,
you change whether you’re talking about now or sometime in the past or
future: I am running, I ran, I will run. A singular thing is one thing, like a cat,
the plural version of a thing is when you mean more than one thing: the cats.

Playing with Plurals
When your child writes about cats and not a cat, she’s writing about plurals.
Any time she changes the singular form of a thing (cat, dog, or table) into
more than one thing (cats, dogs, or tables), she’s making plurals. Plurals are
easy. Most of the time, your child simply adds an s. She can hear that s, too. It
sounds like s or z (but not ez, which I tell you about in the later “Adding es”
section).
Just now, in the previous paragraph, I said “the singular form of a thing.” That
thing, strictly speaking, is a noun. Nouns are the names of things. All through
this chapter, when I talk about “things,” I’m talking about nouns.
Adding s
Thousands of plurals end with s. Single, no-fuss s. In Table 16-1, I list some
words in singular form for your child to add s onto. Skim through the table,
and then dive into the “Adding s’s quick and easy” activity that follows.

When your child says dogs, he hears z, not s, on the end. Tell your child that
many words end in s but sound like they end in z (stoves, sands, and crabs).
Activity: Adding s’s quick and easy
Preparation: Make a copy of Table 16-1, have a watch or timer handy, and
grab some highlighters for your child to use.
Follow these steps:
1. Have your child read the Table 16-1 words to you. Help her sound out
and spot any tricky spelling features (oa, ow, oo, ir, ea, oy).
268
Part V: Spelling Words in Chunks 

2. Have her highlight the spelling features while she says the word out
loud, and then ask the following questions:
1. “How many words end with er?” 
2. “Can you find the two words that have ir in them (it’s the same
sound)?”
3. “When you add s to each word, what’s special about the sound it
makes?” (Answer: It sounds like “z.”)
3. Dictate the words for your child to write. 
4. Dictate them again with a time limit (maybe three minutes) and
record her actual time.
5. Dictate them once more so she can better her own time.
You can do all the spelling activities in this book quickly and easily, but that
doesn’t mean you can’t be creative. Make spelling more fun for your child by
having him use different colored pens or a whiteboard. Get a tray of cream or
pudding and have him finger write words in it. Between spelling tasks, hula
hoop with him (remember that jiggling a hoop around the waist thing?) or
race him to the end of the block. The neighbors may peg you as eccentric,
but your child will love your version of spelling work.
Adding es
When you don’t add s onto a word to make it plural, you usually add es
instead. The three groups of es words to show your child are
 Words that end with ch, sh, s, x, or z, like bunch, bush, boss, box, and fizz.
 Words that ends in a consonant followed by a y, like lady and baby.
 Words like tomato that end with the long-o sound.
Adding es to words that end with ch, sh, s, x, or z
When a word ends with ch, sh, s, x, or z, your child must add es. This distinct
es sound (pronounced ez) is easy for your child to hear. It’s simple. When he
hears es, he writes es. Table 16-2 makes the es ending clear to see and hear. In
Chapter 3, I describe how to help your child hear the different chunks of
sound inside words.

In the “Taking the word away!” activity, you may recognize a game in which
you put ten small objects on a tray. Your child has a good look at them and
then closes his eyes while you take one away. He then has to guess which
object you’ve taken away. In this version of the game, you do the same thing
with ten words.
Activity: Taking the word away!
Preparation: Turn in your book to Table 16-2 so your child can see it. Have
paper or index cards ready.
Follow these steps:
1. Have your child write any ten words from Table 16-2 onto individual
pieces of paper or index cards. 
2. Tell him to look at all ten words for 30 seconds, because you’re going
to take one away. 
3. Have him close his eyes while you take one of the words away. 
4. He then has to look at the remaining nine words and try to remember
which word is missing. 
5. Try the same thing once more, taking a different word away from 
the ten. 
6. Now reverse roles. Your child takes a word away and you have to
remember which word is missing.
You can liven up this activity by adding a quick physical component to it.
Have your child run a sprint while you take a card away and then let him set
you a breezy 400-meter hurdle or a quick 50 chin-ups! Physical breaks can be
things like running around the house or doing push-ups, or jumping rope
until one of you hyperventilates (only kidding!).

Part V: Spelling Words in Chunks 

Adding es to words that end in a consonant and then a y
When a word ends in a consonant followed by a y, like lady and baby, the 
rule is:
Change the y to i then add e-s.
Put more simply, your child needs to get to know the ending ies, because she
can turn words like baby, lady, and puppy into babies, ladies, and puppies.
Table 16-3 gives you some examples of words that end in a consonant fol-
lowed by a y that can be turned into plurals that end with ies. Look through
the table with your child, paying attention to those endings and any tricky
sound chunks. (Library and secretary look hard but are easy when you break
them up and pronounce each part clearly.) When you’re done, surge forward
to the “Pointing and spelling” activity that comes next.

This game is a bit like pin the tail on the donkey. You have your child point to
a word and then write it in its other form, singular or plural.
Follow these steps (recommended dialogue is in quotations):
1. Say, “Look at this table of words.” (Table 16-3.)
271
Chapter 16: Finishing Off with Suffixes

2. Say, “Write one word from each pair anywhere on the paper.”
(Diagonally and bottom to top is fine.)
3. Say, “Close your eyes and point at the paper.” Have your child point
until he’s touching a word.
4. Say, “Open your eyes, read the word you’re pointing to, and tell me
how to spell the partner to that word.” (Singular or plural.)
Have your child spell out the words to you. She can jot them down if she
prefers.

Are you someone who isn’t sure of your potato and tomato? When I was a kid,
I never could decide between potato and potatoe, so in this section I go over
some tasty words like potato, tomato, and mango, so you can make them clear
for your child. I dig up those potatoes and show you once and for all that it’s
potato in the singular and potatoes in the plural. I get to grips with other
words that end with o, too, like volcano and echo, and show you that each
one turns into an oes plural. The rule is:
When a word ends with long o, add es to make it plural.
Table 16-4 gives a healthy bunch of o-ending words so you and your child can
see at a glance that I’m telling the truth about o turning into oes. Take a good
look at the words with your child, and then lead him to the easy “Sorting
your tomatoes and heroes” activity that comes next.

Part V: Spelling Words in Chunks 

For a few words that end with o, you don’t add es, just s. The ones I can think
of are patios, studios, and a bunch of musical instruments: pianos, banjos, and
cellos. To help her remember them your child may like to think that pianos,
banjos, and cellos can be played in studios or on patios (just a suggestion!).
Activity: Sorting your tomatoes and heroes
Preparation: Make a copy of Table 16-4 for your child.
Follow these steps:
1. With the plurals column covered by a piece of paper, ask your child to
write the right words, in plural form, for the categories you call out
(recommended dialog is in quotations):
• “Write down three foods.” (Answer: tomato, mango, potato)
• “Write down two animals.” (Answer: buffalo, mosquito)
• “Write down a cool person.” (Answer: hero)
• “Write down the load that’s carried in trucks, trains, and boats.”
(Answer: cargo)
• “Write down a sound you hear when you shout down a big
canyon.” (Answer: echo)
• “Write down a land form that can erupt.” (Answer: volcano)
2. Now your child can take the paper away to check his spelling. (And
after that you can tell him the timeless and incredibly funny tomato joke:
Why did the tomato blush? Because it saw the salad dressing.)
Adding to f words
Uh oh, is it time to flip quickly past an unsuitable section? No. Relax those
parenting shackles, because this section is about turning nice words that
happen to end with f into plurals.
In short, when your child hears the f sound at the end of a word, he has two
ways to make that word into a plural. He can simply add s, like in beliefs or
chiefs, or he can make a ves ending, like in loaves and knives. To make the ves
ending, he lops off the f (like in loaf) or fe (like in knife) and then adds ves.
If this rule sounds complicated, don’t worry. When you and your child start
writing down those plurals, you can see how they work. Table 16-5 lists a lot
of words for you and your child to check out so he gets smart at choosing the
right ending for his f words. The “Finding the word” and “Finding, running,
and writing” activities after Table 16-5 show you a couple of different ways to
give your child some practice.

Table 16-5 includes three ie words. Tell your child that some words make the
ee sound with ie or ei. The ie spelling is more common than the ei spelling.
The rule to remember is:
i before e except after c.
The full version of the i-before-e-except-after-c rule is this:
i before e except after c, unless you’re making the “ay” sound as in neighbor.
The last bit of the rule helps you with words like neighbor, eight, and reins,
where you hear the ay sound. If in doubt, opt for ie; it’s more common.
Activity: Finding the word
Preparation: Have this book opened to Table 16-5.
Follow this step: Ask your child to look at Table 16-5 and write the word
that corresponds with the following comments:
 “Use these to cut with.” (Answer: knives)
 “Two animals.” (Answer: calf, wolf)
 “Something you eat.” (Answer: loaf)
 “Three words that have i before e except after c.” (Answer: belief, chief,
thief)

Part V: Spelling Words in Chunks 

Activity: Finding, running, and writing
Preparation: You need Table 16-5, ten index cards or slips of paper and a
watch or timer.
Follow these steps:
1. Write ten singular-form words from Table 16-5 onto ten separate
index cards or slips of paper. 
2. Ask your child to look at Table 16-5 and then do the following:
1. With the words facing away from him, show your child the ten
cards.
2. Tell your child: “These ten words are from the list.”
3. Say, “Close your eyes and count to 100 while I hide them.” (Around
the room, in the garden, in the basement.)
4. Say, “When I come back, you have to find the words then race back
here with them and write down their (plural) partners.” (If the
word is knife, you write knives, if it’s chief, you write chiefs.)
5. Say, “I’ll time you, and then you can pick ten new words for me so I
can to do this activity. I’ll try to beat your time!”
(Did I mention that you may need to work out for a few months before doing
this activity?)
Be enthusiastic in this activity and ham up your performance. And, of course,
let your child beat your time . . . fractionally.
Staying Calm with Tenses
I promised not to bog you down in terminology, and I won’t. Suffice to say,
words change when you shift from talking in the now (I sit; I am sitting) to
talking in the past or future (I sat; I was sitting; I will sit, I may be sitting). For
spelling purposes, all you really need to explain to your child is that the end-
ings ed and ing are important.
The sounds of ed
When your child writes words about things done in the past, like laughed,
skipped, and hunted, he ends those word with ed.
Your child writes ed on the end regardless of whether he hears d (laughed), 
t (skipped), or ed (hunted).
275
Chapter 16: Finishing Off with Suffixes

The ed ending can sound a bit different when used with different words, but
after you alert your child to these sounds (especially the t sound), she shouldn’t
be fooled. Table 16-6 gives you plenty of ed words to run through with your
child. Have her read them out loud and hear the sounds for herself. You’ll come
back to these words in the “Placing your bets” and “Doubling the letter to keep
the vowel short” activities that I include a few paragraphs farther on.

Adding ed to short-sounding words
The simple rule about adding endings onto words that have a short vowel
sound is:
Double the letter to keep (or make) the vowel short.
What this rule means is that your child doesn’t have to battle with words like
hoping and hopping or writing and written. All she has to remember is to say
the word to herself, listening for the vowel. Hearing a short vowel means that
she has to double the word’s last letter before attaching an ending. Hop
becomes hopping, and write becomes written (the vowel sound changes so
the spelling changes). Table 16-7 lists a bunch of straightforward words and
it’s followed by the “Placing your bets” and “Doubling the letter to keep the
vowel short” activities.
The double-the-letter-to-keep-the-vowel-short rule is good for short vowel
words that finish with one consonant (hop, bed, sob). The rule doesn’t apply,
however, to words that end with two consonants (jump, sing, bond).

A root word is a word with no beginnings or endings attached to it. (The root
part of presupposed is suppose, for example.)
Activity: Placing your bets
Preparation: Make a copy of Table 16-7, grab some highlighters and a watch
or timer.
Follow these steps:
1. Have your child highlight the root words. He may want to color-code
the words, using a system that he thinks up. 
2. When he’s highlighted the root words, have him read all of them out
loud as fast as he can. 
3. Now recruit other family members to do the same, but before you
start, have everyone guess who’ll be fastest. 
4. Time everyone and place bets with cookies or small change. 
Make sure all contestants are on even footings by devising handicaps. For
example, you can make any adult who mispronounces a word start over, or
chop ten seconds off the kids’ times.
If you’re thinking this game has nothing to do with spelling, consider this:
Good spellers enjoy figuring out spellings. They see spelling as an interesting
puzzle and are confident enough to try out a few different versions of a
spelling. In this game, you show your child that words can be fun, and you
have him look closely at spellings. The more he looks at how words are put
together, the more information and tools he has at his disposal to help him
crack spelling challenges later on.
277
Chapter 16: Finishing Off with Suffixes

Activity: Doubling the letter to keep the vowel short
Preparation: Bookmark Tables 16-6 and 16-7.
Follow these steps:
1. Dictate root words from both tables to your child. 
2. She has to write the word with ed added on, remembering whether to
double the letter to keep the vowel short. 
3. Spice up this activity by having your child draw ten dots (or smiley
faces or whatever she likes). Tell her that if she spells a word right, she
can cross off a dot. If she spells it wrong, she adds a dot. 
4. When she’s crossed off all ten (or more) dots, she’s done. 
One more variation of this activity is to tell your child that she can win ten
coins (or cookies, jelly beans, or whatever you like) from you. When she
spells a word right, she gets a coin, but if she spells it wrong, you get the
coin. (Drum roll . . . Who gets more coins?)
If cookies and coins leave you cold, award your child points in these games
and keep a tally of them. Have him exchange his points for great things you
think up (maybe special outings or toys).
Adding vowel endings (like ing and ed) 
to words that already end with e
When a word already ends with e and your child wants to add an ending that
starts with e, she doesn’t need two e’s. She drops (throws away, gets rid of,
loses) an e. An easy rhyme that can help you to remember this rule about
adding ing, ed, and all endings that start with a vowel (er, est, ily, and able) is:
Drop the e when you add i-n-g. (or any other ending that starts with a vowel).
Table 16-8 shows how it works, and the “Making a word longer” activity just
ahead, goes with it.

Activity: Making a word longer
Preparation: Open this book to Tables 16-8 and have paper and pencil ready.
Follow these steps:
279
Chapter 16: Finishing Off with Suffixes

1. Dictate 20 root words from the words in Table 16-8 to your child. 
2. Ask your child to make each (root) word longer by adding one of the
endings. 
3. To soup up this activity, do the dots or dimes stuff that I suggest in the
“Doubling the letter to keep the vowel short” activity earlier in this
chapter.
Deciding between able and ible
You may be wondering why I didn’t include the ible ending in Table 16-8. It’s
because ible rarely follows a word that ends with e. Ible usually appears in
words that are words in their own right, rather than root words with a suffix
added on, like legible, possible, and eligible or it attaches onto words that end
in a consonant, like digestible and resistible. 
The simple rule for remembering whether to use able or ible is to try able
first, because it’s more common, especially if the root word makes a com-
plete word The best thing you can do to help your child choose between able
and ible is give him plenty of practice with them. Table 16-9 shows a bunch of
words that go with the “Adding able or ible” activity that follows.

Activity: Adding able or ible
Preparation: Make a copy of Table 16-9 and grab some highlighters.
Follow these steps: 
1. Remind your child about the able/ible rule -try able first, because 
it’s more common, especially if the root word makes a complete word,
and then ask him to look through Table 16-9 armed with colored 
highlighter. 
2. His job is to color the complete words he finds inside able and ible
words, like reason inside reasonable. How many of these words-
within-words are there in the able column? How many are there in the
ible column? Does his answer confirm the rule?
Answers: Able column: suit, reason, depend, prefer, commend, prevent, assess,
laugh, break, compact, forget, predict, remark, transport, question, impression,
absorb =17 words
Ible column: digest, resist, suggest = 3 words
Yes, the rule is confirmed because able words contain complete root words
far more often that ible words do.
Always give your child paper and pen and help him jot down possible
spellings. The more he does this, the better he gets at sounding out syllables,
choosing likely spellings, and opting for the right ones.

Adding to Words That End in y
In this section I give you two rules for adding endings onto words that end
with y. The rules may seem tricky at first but the more your child sees and
practices them for herself, the better her spelling instincts will become. 
With that in mind, take a look at the two rules and then move to the “Ending
for thirty points,” “Finding ten ending mistakes,” and Adding a quick ending”
activities after Tables 16-10 and 16-11. 
Rule 1: For words ending with a consonant followed by a y (like marry),
change y to i, and then add the ending — except when adding ing — in which
case, simply add the ending. The short version of this rule is 
Change the y to i except with ing (married, marrying).
Rule 2: For words ending with a vowel + y (like play), simply add the ending
(playing).

Help your child remember say and pay. They turn into said and paid.
The best way for your child to get the hang of all these words is to see them
and write them often. There’s quite a bit to learn, so the next three activities —
“Ending for thirty points,” “Finding ten ending mistakes,” and Adding a quick
ending” — can be used with of any of the words that you find in this chapter.
Follow the instructions (and dialogue in bold) and use whichever words your
child needs to practice.
Activity: Ending for thirty points
Preparation: With your book open to Tables 16-10 and 16-11, grab a large
piece of paper or whiteboard.
Follow these steps:
1. On your paper, draw a table with five columns and two rows (see the
one I’ve provided). 
2. Inside each square write a word from the tables. 
3. Now write two misspelled words inside each square. Like this:
marryied
flopping
enyoid
driyed
carrier
married
floppying
enjoyed
dried
carryer
marryed

283
Chapter 16: Finishing Off with Suffixes

4. Give the follow instructions to your child:
1. “Look at the words and choose the right spelling.”
2. “If you’re right, you get three points. If you’re wrong, I get three
points.”
3. “If you beat me, you write out each correction only once and get an
ice cream (and a big hug!).”
4. “If I beat you, I get a big hug!”
Keep the game fun with lighthearted consequences. You don’t want your
child seeing spelling as a punishment or something that makes him feel
dumb.
Activity: Finding ten ending mistakes
Preparation: Write out ten sentences with spelling errors. Make the errors a
mix of common words like they and words from the tables. Write clearly or
print or type.
Follow these steps:
1. Give your child the flawed sentences to correct. Tell him to find ten
errors, one in each sentence.
Examples:
• The couple got marryed.
• The girl had neva been happier.
• Thay went on vacation.
• The bags were heavyer than the blankets.
• The little girl cryed.
• The boy was angry becuse he lost his pen.
• I am staing in a motel.
• She enjoyied the music.
• It was the funnyest show.
• It was the windyest day in years.
2. Have him write the correct spellings. 
Tell him that if he gets all the spellings right, you’ll do 20 push-ups or jumping
jacks, or shoot hoops for 20 minutes, or any other creative thing that comes
to you in a moment of folly, oops, I mean inspiration. Better still, tell him that
284
Part V: Spelling Words in Chunks 

your partner or other child or grandmother will do those things, but if he
gets any wrong, he has to do ten push-ups.
When your child proofreads (looks for errors), have him read the whole 
sentence first. After he makes sense of the text, he then goes back to make
corrections.
Activity: Adding a quick ending
Preparation: Open this book to Tables 16-10 and 16-11 and have a watch or
timer.
Follow these steps:
1. Cover the second and third columns of Table 16-10 with a blank piece
of paper. 
2. Ask your child to write on the blank paper the root words of the
words in the first column with any endings. 
3. Give her a time limit of three minutes. 
4. Do the same with Table 16-11, but set the time limit at two minutes.
You can think up rewards to go with these activities, but your child will like
your playful attention even better. Say stupid things like “If you get all these
words right, I won’t have to punch you on the nose.” If he makes mistakes say
something like, “Well, it was only a small mistake, do you think I should step
on your toe instead?” Your (razor-sharp) jokes and lightheartedness tell him
that spelling can be fun and mistakes don’t have to be stressful.
Mixing Suffixes and Endings
So far, you and your child have added suffixes like ing and ed to root words.
Suffixes are great, but your child needs to know about other endings, too. I’m
including a bunch of those other endings in the next few paragraphs. You’ll
spot familiar root words with suffixes added on, like inspection, but also
words, like lotion, that aren’t root words plus suffixes. You’ll see words with
sound-alike endings like uncle and final. These words are worth showing to
your child, because kids often misspell them.
A suffix is an addition to a root word. It adapts the root word so it can be
used in different contexts. Suffixes can turn jump into jumps, jumped, jumping,
jumpy, jumpier, and jumpiest, and direct into directs, directed, directing, direc-
tor, directive, and direction.
285
Chapter 16: Finishing Off with Suffixes

Adding tion, sion, or cian
The ending that often catches kids out to lunch is tion. Kids quite reasonably
expect tion to be written shun. Table 16-12 gives you sion, tion, and cian
words to look at with your child. Both of you need to limber up your writing
hand, because the “Matching up words and endings” activity gives everyone
an active role.

Activity: Matching up words and endings
Preparation: Grab some paper and pens.
Follow these steps:
1. Write the 30 words from Table 16-12 onto a sheet of paper. 
2. Cut out each word and then cut off all the endings. Spread out the root
words (or word parts) and the endings. 
3. Ask your child to match the words to their endings. This activity is a
good one to do together on the floor.
286
Part V: Spelling Words in Chunks 

When you help your child with this activity, don’t take over. Say things like
“Could this be right?” and “Do you think it’s this one?” If your child struggles,
arrange the word parts so they’re close to their partners and so your child
can spot the pairs better.
Adding ent or ant
When endings sound similar, your child has to get to know the looks of them.
She must sharpen her visual memory. Have your child read the words in
Table 16-13. With your help, have her write them out, sounding them out in
chunks. Next you can dictate them to her in random order. Can she spell at
least 12 of the 16 correctly? If she can, celebrate! (Drink hot chocolate
together, award her points, play a game with her). If not, have her write out
the ones that got away (the ones she misspelled) a few times, until they’re
retrieved and snugly held in her memory.
Any time a word or two escapes your child’s memory, have him jot them
down. If he writes them three times a day for a few days, and pins them in
places where he can see them (the bathroom is good), he can get the better
of them.

Make a copy of Table 16-14 and have your child read through the words in it. He
can pronounce a distinct al in the al words, if it helps him remember the right
ending. Have him highlight any tricky letters. After the table, the “Remembering

spelling five words correctly is great, and spelling more than five cor-
rectly is plain brilliant!

Navel and principle are two words that have
practically everyone wondering about al’s and
le’s, so here’s the lowdown:
Your child will find his navel on his stomach, but
his naval project features pictures of ships and
seafaring folk. If your child has to see his prin-
cipal, he may feel nervous. When you talk about
his principles, he may feel nervous, too. Maybe
he needs to examine his principles so that he’s
able to stay clear of his principal? Can’t remem-
ber all that? Don’t worry, remember instead that
“the principal should be your pal” and “in naval
affairs, we’re all on the boat together.”

3. Next give him Table 16-13, and tell him that he can cross off the words
that he spelled correctly and an equal number of other words. (If he
correctly spelled five words, he crosses off those five, plus another five.) 
4. Now dictate the remaining words to him.
Adding full and all
How easy is this? When your child adds full to the end of a word or all to the
beginning, she simply drops one of the l’s. Table 16-15 provides some full and
all words for you to check out. Have your child take a good look at the words
and copy down any that look tricky to her, Then take turns writing the words
with your finger on each other’s back. Your child can use paper and pen, too,
if she wants.

A Grand Finale of Suffixes
Want to lead your child through a different ending each week? At the end of
the chapter, there are 11 add-on tables to feast on (I thought a dozen might
be a bit much!). Look through them and dictate some of the words for your
child to spell. If you can muster up a crowd, use these words with the group
activities that I give in Chapter 20. If you’re feeling dramatic, “Charades” is
absolutely the game for you.

Part V: Spelling Words in Chunks 

Activity: Charades
Preparation: I’m guessing that just about everybody has played charades. All
you need to start is a bunch of words that can be acted out. Here are ten from
the tables in this chapter: beautiful, marriage, private, pirate, affectionate,
mountain, temperature, lecture, secretary, and delicious.
Follow these steps:
1. Have one person (you or your child) silently read a word and then act
it out. This player who’s acting out the word is not allowed to speak. 
2. The player who’s watching must guess the word the other player is
acting out. 
3. When he shouts out the right answer, he must follow through by writ-
ing the word down (with the correct spelling, of course). If your child
spells the word incorrectly, give huge hints to help him out.
When you play charades with your child, you provide the words! You can
probably get away with this activity with little kids; however, you may want
to give them a peek at the words in advance to even the pitch. Older kids
don’t need a peek. Get an independent person to write the words down so
none of the Charades players gets a sneak preview.

Spotting What’s in a Contraction
In This Chapter
 Spelling short and long versions of the same words
 Understanding the possessive apostrophe
 Avoiding common mistakes
T
he saying, “Good things come in small packages,” is pertinent for things
like diamonds and laptop computers, but not much use with things like
scorpions. Some words are a bit like scorpions, small but potentially trouble-
some. The words don’t, it’s, and that’s, for example, rank among the top 25
most misspelled (or misused) words in written English. This chapter helps
your child morph those scorpions into diamonds, at least figuratively.
Disappearing Letters
Like its name suggests, a contraction is one word that used to be more words.
A contraction is two words that have been fused together with a letter or two
taken out and replaced with an apostrophe, or a punctuation mark that looks
like a high-up comma.
Understanding What’s Going 
on with Contractions
Contractions can be confusing for some people. To make them clear for your
child, remind him that the apostrophe in a contraction always replaces miss-
ing letters. Your child will figure out contractions after he thinks about what
he’s literally writing. If, for example, he writes, “he’s,” it’s actually short for, or
a contraction of, he is. If he writes, “it’s,” it’s short for it is. And if he writes
you’re, it’s short for you are.

A word is a contraction only if it has an apostrophe in it and you can expand
it into two words. I explain that a little more in the “It’s versus its” section
later in the chapter.
Getting to Know the 
Words That Contract
Your child will come across plenty of contractions. Table 17-1 gives you the
more common ones. Look through them with your child and then cruise
through the “Count and figure out,” “Listen up,” and “Poem search” activities
that I tell you about next.

Activity: Count and figure out
Preparation: You need your copy of Teaching Kids to Spell For Dummies in
front of you and turned to this page. Make a copy of Table 17-1. Have pen and
paper ready for your child to use.
Follow these steps (suggested dialogue is in quotation marks):
1. Have your child “Look at Table 17-1.”
2. Tell your child to “Cover the right column with a piece of paper.”
3. Have your child “Count to the fifth word in the left column and write
what that word is short for.”
4. Have your child “Count to the tenth word and write what that word is
short for.”
5. Do steps 1 through 4 for the 15th, 20th, and 25th words.
6. Have your child “Take away the paper to check your answers.”
7. Say to your child, “Now put the paper over the left column.”
8. Have your child “Look at the right column, and write the contraction
for every third set of words or word.”
9. Have your child “Take away the paper and check your answers.”
297
Chapter 17: Spotting What’s in a Contraction

Activity: Listen up
Preparation: Open this book to Table 17-1 and have pen and paper ready for
your child to use.
Follow these steps:
1. Dictate any five words (long form) to your child from the right column
of Table 17-1.
2. Have your child write the short form, or contraction, for each one.
3. Reverse the process described in Steps 1 and 2, dictating contractions
from the left column and having your child write the words in long
form.
Activity: Poem search
Preparation: Make a copy of the poem New Boots, which follows and have a
pen ready for your child to use.
Follow these steps:
1. Have your child read New Boots.
2. Have your child find and circle the ten contractions (or maybe I mis-
counted!) in the poem.
New Boots
I don’t trip over

They’re shiny and squeaky.
They’ve got buckles.
My mom tried to make me get another pair
but I said they were too tight.

Possessive Apostrophes
After your child is comfortable working with contractions, she needs to be on
good terms with possessive apostrophes. This section shows you how to
help your child wield her apostrophes wisely, without under- or overusing
them.
When your child writes about people or things (nouns) and describes them
as having (or possessing) something, she needs to use the possessive apos-
trophe. If she writes about John’s ball, Jane’s mom, or the cat’s tail, or writes,
“That ball is Jane’s,” she’s writing about possession and must pop in the pos-
sessive apostrophe.
In general, the two times your child needs to use an apostrophe are
 In a contraction, to replace the omitted letters, like in isn’t
 To show that a thing or person possesses something, like in John’s hat or
the cat’s dish
Never use apostrophes in possessive personal pronouns (hers, his, its, ours,
or yours). Of these words “its” is probably the one your child is most likely to
trip up on, because it’s so much like “it’s.” I talk about “It’s versus its” later in
this chapter.
For nouns that end in s (class, boys, boss), just add the apostrophe, as in:
 It’s my class’ turn.
 It was the boys’ race.
 This is the boss’ pen.
Proper nouns (names of people) are special. You can write “Tess’ doll” or
“Tess’s doll.”
Zip through the “Apostrophes in contractions and possession” and “Who has
what?” activities with your child so he’s sure about using apostrophes.
Activity: Apostrophes in contractions and possession
Preparation: Copy the list of 12 statements that follow and have a pen ready
for your child to use.
Follow this step: Have your child put in 16 apostrophes where they’re
needed in the statements that follow. 
 I went to Janes house. (Answer: 1)
 Shes Pauls sister. (Answer: 2)

Activity: Who has what?
Preparation: Open this book to Table 17-2. You’ll need paper and a pen.
Follow these steps:
1. Have your child match each person or thing in the first column of
Table 17-2 with an object in the second column.
2. Have your child write short possessive sentences like about those
matches she’s made.
She may write: The dog’s ball burst. Jane’s hat fell off. My dad’s sock has a
hole in it.

You can make this activity lively by thinking of real people you know and
matching them with real objects. Spread out small objects on the table, and
ask your child to pretend match them with friends. Make realistic or funny
matches like “This lipstick is my dog’s.” If your child seems to be getting right
into this activity, draw a poster of the matches.
Avoiding Mistakes
People always are misspelling (or to be accurate, misusing) contractions. It’s,
who’s, and you’re are particularly bothersome, so here’s some information
that can help your child straighten out those spellings.
A contraction is a shortened word made from two words joined together. The
apostrophe takes the place of the letter or letters that are missing. Your child
can decide whether he is writing a contraction by asking himself whether his
word can be expanded into two words. If not, he isn’t writing a contraction
(and doesn’t need an apostrophe).
It’s versus its
It’s is the contraction for it is, and it causes heads to ache. When your child is
in the middle of writing a letter, she may not be sure whether to use it’s, the
contraction, or its, the possessive pronoun. Should she write it’s head or its
head? Because you’re talking about a head that belongs to some thing, its
head is the answer.
Your child can write Peter’s head, the dog’s head, and my mom’s head, but not
it’s head. The technical reason: It is not a noun but rather a pronoun.
The simple reason that your child can’t write it’s head is that its never has an
apostrophe unless you’re using it to say it is.
Give your child the simple explanation of “It’s versus its” and then dive into
the “Getting it right with its” activity.
Activity: Getting it right with its
Preparation: Make a copy of the list of the ten sentences in this activity.
You’ll also need a pen or pencil.
Follow this step: Have your child put in 15 apostrophes where they’re
needed in the list of statements that follow. Note: I just wrote apostrophes,
301
Chapter 17: Spotting What’s in a Contraction

and not apostrophe’s. If your child isn’t sure whether to use an apostrophe
with words ending in s, tell her that plurals alone never have apostrophes.
 Its a nice day today isnt it? (Answer: 2)
 It took its bone somewhere else. (Answer: 0)
 I know its late but I cant rush. (Answer: 2)
 Youd be mad to take away its blanket. (Answer: 1)
 Ill be there when its dark. (Answer: 2)
 Wed better get its bottle. (Answer: 1)
 Im sure its okay that hes gone. (Answer: 3)
 Theres a loop on its collar. (Answer: 1)
 Its been a while since youve called. (Answer: 2)
 Therell be trouble about its feed. (Answer: 1)
Your child must think pretty carefully about these sentences. So must I!
Remember to take breaks. Shoot some hoops, grab a snack, see who can throw
raisins in the air and catch them in their mouths. (Throwing raisins or mini-
cookies in the air and catching them in your mouth is a time-honored art that
your child will respect. Show off your forgotten skills; be wicked-awesome!)
Can’t versus can,t
Can’t isn’t a tricky contraction, but I use it here to show you a problem that
your child may have with knowing the differences between apostrophes and
commas. I see some children writing can,t, so I’m alerting you to the dilemma
of “do I put the apostrophe up or down?” If your child isn’t sure where the
apostrophe makes its home, remind him about the differences between apos-
trophes (up high) and commas (down low).
The best-selling book about English usage and grammar, Eats, Shoots and
Leaves, by Lynne Truss, takes its name from this joke (that everyone but me
heard eons ago!).
A comma shows you where to pause as you read.
An apostrophe takes the place of missing letters when you’ve shortened two
words into a contraction.
An apostrophe also shows when a person or thing possesses something
(Sharon’s ball; the dog’s ball; mom’s ball), but you never use an apostrophe in
its, like in its ball.
302
Part V: Spelling Words in Chunks 

Who’s versus whose
Children sometimes write whose rather than who’s. If your child makes this
mistake, tell him that who’s is short for who is or who has, and if he’s saying
“whose” but not meaning who is or who has, the spelling is whose. After he’s
thought about that distinction, help him with the “Who’s or whose” activity
up next.
Activity: Who’s or whose
Preparation: Copy the ten sentences in this activity and make sure you have
a pen or pencil ready for your child to use.
Follow this step: Have your child circle the correct word (whose or who’s) in
each sentence. 
 “Whose/who’s sweater is this?” dad asked. (Answer: whose)
 “That’s the boy whose/who’s on the chess team,” Jeff said. 
(Answer: who’s)
 “Whose/who’s turn is it?” the teacher asked. (Answer: whose)
 “That’s the girl whose/who’s mom baked the cake,” Janet told me.
(Answer: whose)
 “Whose/who’s next in line?” the waiter asked. (Answer: who’s)

Chapter 17: Spotting What’s in a Contraction
Bob’s panda joke
Last week I was sitting in a café, masquerading
as a cool person and typing this chapter, when
a man looked over my shoulder. “What’s all that
about can’t and can,t?” he asked. So I told him.
“Ah, commas,” he said. “Did you hear the one
about the panda who went to the bar?” Here’s
the panda joke that Bob told me:
A panda orders a meal in a bar, eats it, and then
shoots the unlucky fellow sitting next to him. He
turns to leave the bar, but the other patrons appre-
hend him. “Why did you do that?” they ask. “I’m
supposed to,” says the panda, and hands them a
(badly edited) dictionary. They flip to “panda” and
read, “panda: eats, shoots, and leaves.” So you
see, it’s like Bob says, “Those commas sure are
important dudes. (He didn’t really say that “dude”
stuff. Sorry Bob, I got carried away with the
rootin’, tootin’ story.)

 “Whose/who’s got the ball?” Megan shouted. (Answer: who’s)
 “She’s the one whose/who’s lying,” Dan yelled. (Answer: who’s)
 “Whose/who’s in charge here?” my mom asked. (Answer: who’s)
You’re versus your
Is it you’re or your? Help your child distinguish between these two words by
remembering that in contractions an apostrophe takes the place of missing
letters.
If you write about your hat or your mom, no letters are missing. But if you
write that you’re going out, it really means you are going out. Two words (you
are) have been contracted into you’re, with the apostrophe replacing the
missing letter.
The “You’re and your,” “30 proverbs; 20 apostrophes,” “Look who’s talking,”
and “Ha, ha” activities give your child straightforward, change-the-mistakes
practice. Go through them with your child, because basic practice, when all
is said and done, is a good thing to do. Then you can move on. The last three
upbeat activities are proverbs for you to ponder, conversations for you to
construct, and jokes for you to split your sides over!

 Can I have your cake? (Answer: Can I have your cake?)

very day my friend Emma drags me around on what could loosely be
described as a walk. Emma is a beagle. She keeps her nose to the ground
and does disconcerting things when she picks up a scent. I’ve gotten used to
her sudden sprints (since the time she wrapped her lead around my ankles and
yanked me to the ground before my keen reflexes kicked in), but her unearthly
howling is something else. When Emma points her nose skyward and lets rip,
people think unspeakable things are happening.
Emma has instincts. To be a good speller your child needs to form an instinct
for breaking words into sounds. If he gets friendly with the word families in
this chapter, he’s well on his way.
The Easy All and Or Families
The words all and or are great for starting your child off on word families.
After your child can spell these two, he’s off and running and ready to spell a
host of words in the same families (like the ones in Table 18-1), and he’ll feel
pretty darned clever in the process.

suggestion past her to see if it helps her bring the silent gh to mind when she
needs to spell it.

Height is a tricky word. It fits into the ight family but you have to warn your
child about the he beginning. One tip for helping your child remember the
spelling is to tell him that height follows the same spelling pattern as weight
even though they sound out differently.
The oi and oy Families
Here are a couple of families that are worth your child befriending. Although I
know they don’t seem such a big deal here, you’d be surprised how often they
hold up your child’s spelling, if he isn’t wary of them. See Table 18-3.

Many of the member words of the next two families have a lot of personality.
Take growl and slouch, for example. They’re evocative words that can add
pep to your child’s writing. They’re good for your child to learn to spell for
another reason. Because so many ou and ow words are out there, after she

these families will be easy (see Table 18-4).

The er, ir, and ur Families
If your child gets into writing comic strips, she definitely needs to know how
to spell “er.” Comic characters who get biffed, bashed, or bonked almost
always do so with “er” dangling above them in their speech or thought bal-
loons. In the unlikely event that your child doesn’t need an er for her comic
strip, don’t worry, any effort you put into Table 18-5 won’t be wasted. Cast
your eyes over the er, ir, and ur columns, and you’ll see oft needed words like
girl (as in “Go girl!”), purse (as in “Mom where’s your purse?”) and dirt (as in
“Mo-om! Will this dirt come out of my jeans?”).

I
f you’re anything like me you feel as if much of your time goes into coercing
your child to eat healthily and watch TV selectively and the rest goes into
keeping track of your keys. In this chapter, I save you from wasting valuable
time and energy (that you need for accusing loved ones of misplacing your
keys) by giving you all the important spelling stuff you need, in a nutshell.
Seeing and Hearing; Slouching 
and Shifting
If you’re unsettled about your child’s ability to spell, you’ll want to make sure
that she sees and hears words clearly. Use activity books with look-and-search
activities (like “Spot the difference”) to roughly gauge her eyesight and play a
lot of listening games together to get an idea of how well she hears.
You can have your child’s hearing and vision tested too, and if you’re still
worried after that, get a second opinion. To be on the safe side, get a second
opinion anyway. Parents whose children have vision or hearing problems
that slip through the net will tell you to get a few opinions and to watch for
the signs.

Indicators of possible hearing difficulties are:
 Your child has had a lot of ear infections.
 Your child shouts a lot and talks loudly.
 When you ask your child a question, you only sometimes get any answers.
 Your child often mishears things.
Hearing problems are tricky to spot, because kids are good at shouting and
ignoring their parents much of the time. Get professional advice. Then you’re
not always uming and ahing over whether your child hears you.
Indicators of possible vision problems are that your child:
 Tilts his head slightly to look at things.
 Squints.
 Rubs his eyes a lot.
 Gets headaches.
 Sometimes complains of feeling dizzy.
 Feels tired after concentrating or focusing on things, or reading.
 Holds books and other reading material at an unusual angle or distance
when reading or looking at them.
Lightening Up
Doing dreary things is difficult, but it’s even harder for your full-of-fun child.
That’s why I include this subheading. I want to share with you a big lesson
that I learned from teaching hundreds of kids: Be cheerful. Keep an upbeat
pace. Do a variety of activities, and take breaks. When problems surface,
focus on solutions and not blame. There, now you’ve learned in a few sec-
onds all the good stuff that dawned on me over much more than a few years.
Homing in on Handwriting
Handwriting is a funny thing. Some people think that a neat hand is impor-
tant; others don’t. Some of the smartest people around have lazy, barely legi-
ble scrawls, and some of the flakiest or untidiest of folk write neat and even
318
Part VI: The Part of Tens 

words. What’s a parent to think? Well here’s what a great elementary school
teacher once told me: Kids need to develop a smooth and legible hand. They
need to practice their penmanship so they get better and faster at writing.
Why? Because doing so frees them to do other things. If they can read their
own writing (and believe me, plenty of kids can’t), they can proofread their
work and are more likely to spot their errors. If they write fluidly and at a
good pace, they can keep track of their thoughts — and you know how diffi-
cult that is. If they’re not always stopping and starting to think of how to spell
words, they have more time to think of the one or two words that are tricky
to spell.
I just sold you an idea. I said that good handwriting is important. Lest you
think that I’m the kind of person who doesn’t look at things from a few (hun-
dred) different angles, let me tell you about my experience with handwriting
from a parent’s point of view. One of my kids is a seemingly natural speller. I
always thought that the effortless good speller didn’t really exist, so my kid 
is something of a surprise to me. She spells amazingly well and hates being
helped. (I’m hoping for a mellowing-down miracle some time soon.) So how
does Miss Spelling Smarty Pants like handwriting drill? She hates it. So, here’s
where I think the middle ground is between my friend’s and my daughter’s
points of view: Writing fluidly, with letters formed in the proper direction, is
an important skill for your child to have. (I’ve seen kids whose writing was
seriously slowed because they started letters in the wrong places and put
them together any old how.) It’s also important that you don’t switch your
child off writing by nagging him to death about his penmanship. Expect a legi-
ble hand from your child but not necessarily perfection, because some kids
just write more neatly than others. If your child is a Spelling Smarty Pants,
great! You may not have to tut-tut, if he scrawls and scrapes his letters. If
your child is like the rest of us and needs to fix some spelling errors, you 
may want to invest enough time to improve his handwriting so that it’s neat
enough for him to actually see those mistakes.

Chapter 19: Ten Ways to Correct Your Child’s Spelling
Upping the fun side of the equation
My child is at horseback-riding camp. She’s
there for a week and has only completed one day
so far. When I picked her up yesterday, she had
mixed feelings about camp. “I picked these wild
flowers and made this sword and shield,” she
panted. “I can’t wait to be the mayor tomorrow.”
Then she changed her tone. “They made us
clean horse poop for hours,” she complained.
“We’re just kids, why don’t they clean the horse
poop? After all, the horses are theirs.”
This morning my daughter raced back to the
horse poop without complaining. She’ll get
through the stinky, hard-work aspects of being
around horses, because she’ll get to go on trail
rides, gather armfuls of wildflowers and be
mayor. Like all good teachers, her camp leaders
are upping the fun side of the learning equation.
If I were a gambling woman, I’d bet good money
that my child will be eager for more of the same
next summer.

Telling Your Child a Word Versus 
Making Your Child Figure It Out
When your child is stuck with a word, whether you give him the whole spelling
or try to help him to figure it out depends first and foremost on your child’s
personality. Is your child the type of little person who doesn’t mind you help-
ing him or do you have to tread carefully around his fierce sense of indepen-
dence? Your child probably is somewhere in between, so you can deftly skip
between roles of chirpy mentor and wizened old sage without too much of the
wizened and old. And what about the words with which you’re dealing? Are
there words that need to be swiftly and wholly given, or are there words you
need to give out sparingly and with cute or cryptic clues? The answers are 
yes and yes. Some words, like who and any, are hard to clue your child in on.
They’re written differently from the way they sound and any clues you can give
your child are either boring or convoluted ones like, “Who has a silent w, and
then the bit you’d think was spelled hoo is, in fact, spelled ho, like in “Ho ho,
boys and girls, it’s Christmas.” When you come across words like who that are
hard to sound out or apply rules to, don’t try to do either.
Tell your child the complete spelling of difficult words, like who, that don’t
conform to spelling rules and phonetic principles. Have him write them and
hang onto a written copy. You can present the words to him later so he gets
plenty of practice recalling them. Keep practicing for a few days until the
spellings stick in his mind.

Part VI: The Part of Tens 
Oh sleep. Why doth thou elude me?
The other night my youngest daughter played
host to a birthday sleepover. Four giggling,
squealing little girls took their teddies and blan-
kets into one bedroom. They told me they were
going to sleep. When an hour had elapsed, I
went into the bedroom with a gentle reminder,
“Girls, you have a busy day tomorrow (more
birthday things), so you need to be quiet.” When
an hour and 30 minutes had passed, I delivered
a more somber message, “Girls, you need to go
to sleep now, and when I leave this room, I don’t
want to hear any voices.” When two hours had
tick-tocked by, I gave my ultimatum, “Okay, I
hear noise. Whoever I hear when I leave this
room has to sleep in the other room.”
It wasn’t long before I moved my daughter into
that other room. She was heartbroken. “But
Mom, it’s my birthday! I promise I’ll be good, only
please let me go back with the others.” We dried
her tears. She tiptoed back to her friends, and a
wonderful, complete quiet enveloped our house.
When your child struggles with spelling, it’s a bit
like struggling to keep quiet on her birthday
sleepover. It’s hard. The best thing you can do is
be flexible. If one strategy doesn’t work, try
another. When all is said and done, learning to
spell in a happy, unstressed way is best for your
child. (And, of course, it’s best that little friends
on sleepovers, even restless ones, get to lay
their weary heads down together.)

Words that you can help your child with, without giving the complete
spelling, are the ones that belong to word families or that sound out regularly.
Misspellings like vetrenery and throte are the kinds you can nudge your child
into correcting for herself. The word veterinary is easier if your child pro-
nounces it phonetically. Tell her that it’s spelled ve-ter-in-ary. Tell her that the
word throat follows the When-two-vowels-go-walking-the first-one-does-the-
talking rule.
Whenever you can, use spelling rules or word families to help your child spell
entire words or parts of words. When that doesn’t work, however, have your
child jot down the tricky word again a few times over a few days until the
look of the word sticks in his mind.
Looking for Families
I just said that you need to call on word families whenever you’re in their
vicinity. In case you’ve just opened to this chapter or you’ve forgotten every-
thing that you read so far and have no idea what a word family is, here’s a
lightning review.
A word family is a bunch of words that share a spelling and sound pattern.
Words like small, tall, and ball form the all family. Words like sound, round, and
shout are part of the ou family (but know that another small ou bunch has a
different sound, the would, could, and should family), and merrily, happily, and
funnily are in the ily family. You can make dozens of different word families
with your child. A spelling pattern is easier for her to remember when she
sees it in many words, so point her in the direction of a family anytime you
can. This book is full of word families.
Looking for Spelling Rules
Some rules make life hard for your child. She wants to feel the soft grass under
her toes, but the sign says to keep out, or she wants to bomb into the blue
water, but the lifeguard warns her against any kind of jumping. Not so with
spelling rules. Spelling rules help a great deal as long as you don’t overload
your child with them. Three or four rules cover pretty much all the important
spelling factors that your child needs to know and, hardly surprisingly, I give
them to you here in this spelling oracle. You find that I talk about all the rules
in depth in chapters 7, 8, and 9, but here I give you a lightning handy overview.
321
Chapter 19: Ten Ways to Correct Your Child’s Spelling

Rule One: Bossy e
You write Bossy e everywhere. That’s why it’s a great letter for your child 
to get to know. Here’s the rule: Your child spells a word like mate by adding
Bossy e to the end of mat. The e is bossy because it bosses the other vowel 
in the word to make a long sound or to shout out its name. Here are a few
words that show Bossy e doing its thing: plate, mate, lake, Pete, scene, ride,
hide, mine, rode, bone, hope, cute, mule and tune. You get the long tour
through a mountain of Bossy e words in Chapter 7.
When a vowel makes a long sound, it’s the same sound as its name. That’s
why I say that Bossy e makes the vowel (in the word it tags onto) have a long
sound or shout out its name.
Rule Two: When two vowels go walking,
the first one does the talking
Here’s a cute rhyme to help your child remember another way of spelling long
vowel sounds. When spelling words like neat and boat, your child can go over
the when-two-vowels-go-walking-the-first-one-does-the-talking rhyme. Most
long-e sounds fit the two vowels rule. Long e is spelled either with ee, like in
meet, seed, and weed, or ea, like in team, seat, and bead. The two vowels come
side by side, but the first is the one that makes its long sound. A long-o sound
is also often spelled with two vowels. The long o is spelled with oa like in boat,
coat, and loan. A long-a sound can be spelled with side-by-side vowels, too. In
words like pain and rain, your child spells the long-a sound with ai. See how
the two vowels come together? Your child needs to start them with the long
vowel that he hears and then remember the partnership. The promenading
pairs that he must remember are ee, ea, oa, and ai and you can find more
about them in Chapter 8.
Rule Three: y behaves like a vowel
Without a doubt, vowel sounds are tricky to spell. That’s why these four
spelling rules are about them. Every time your child hears a long-vowel
sound, he must run through the options, which explains why he always needs
to use scrap paper when trying to spell them. The third option mostly has to
do with long-e or long-i sounds that your child hears on the ends of words.
The y-behaving-as-a-vowel rule applies to vowel sounds on the end of words
that are spelled with a y. In words like happy and sunny, your child uses y to
sound like long e. In little words like by and shy, he uses it to sound like long i.
What about words like system, cyst, and gypsy? In those words, your child
spells the short-i sound with a y. The words cyst and gypsy are soft-c and 
322
Part VI: The Part of Tens 

soft-g spellings (as well as spellings that use y to make the short-i sound) so,
you may want to flip over to Chapter 14 to read more about those softies.
You use y to make e or i sounds. When your child puts y on the ends of longer
words (like happy), it makes a long-e sound, and when she puts y on the end
of short words (like by), it makes a long-i sound. She uses y in the middle of
some words (like gypsy) to make the short-i sound. When your child gets into
the habit of jotting down her spelling options on scrap paper, she gets better
and better at deciding whether to use y.
Although you may think that I’ve been a bit stingy with my explanation of
when and when not to use y to make the e and i sounds, I have good reason.
I’ve given you only a brief explanation rather than an elaborate one, because
if you get long-winded when explaining these rules, you can send your child
off into a daze. The smarter approach is to give him scrap paper and simply
let him figure out some spellings with an I’ve-got-a-spelling-puzzle-to-solve
attitude.
Rule Four: i before e except 
after c (when you hear ee)
When I told you that vowel sounds are challenging to spell, I wasn’t kidding.
Here is yet another way for your child to spell the long-e sound. All sorts of
words have the long-e sound in them, and the i-before-e-except-after-c rule
gives your child a fourth spelling option. The question becomes: Should 
your child write Bossy e like in Pete, or two vowels walking like in meat and
meet, y as in happy, or ie as in niece? Whew. Where is that scrap paper? With ie
spellings, be sure to help your child learn the first part of the rule — i before e
except after c — before helping her discover the except-when-you-hear-“ay”-
like-in-neighbor part. Practice on words like niece, piece, and receive, and after
she’s at ease with those, tackle the tough words like neighbor and weight. (You
hear ay, so you don’t put i before e.) In Chapter 8, I tell you more about ie and
ei spellings.
Deciding to Remember 
the Look of a Word
Some words have crazy spellings that you can’t find in any other words or
many tricky sound chunks. Here are the kinds of words I’m talking about:
Who, they, because, any, come, some, could, would, should, eight, has,
laugh, work, and want
323
Chapter 19: Ten Ways to Correct Your Child’s Spelling

When a word has so many twists and turns in it that you’d have to be crazy
to try to sound it out completely, your child’s best bet for remembering how
to spell it is remembering how it looks. He can sound out the first letter or a
chunk of sound in the word, and then get used to the look of the rest of it.
How, exactly, does your child get used to the look of words? Teachers have
pondered this question for years and they’ve come up with some pretty neat
answers. I respectfully lay out the four best answers before you now:
 Look, cover, write, and check: This little formula describes four steps
that your child can go through to fix a word in his mind. He looks at the
word (already spelled out), covers it over, writes his own version, and
then checks his copy against the original — look, cover, write, and
check.
 Word folders: A great way to save words so that your child can practice
spelling them regularly is to use a word envelope or folder. In Chapter
10, I explain how to make and use a super-cool spelling folder. You can
use the spelling folder for any words, and if you group words into fami-
lies, they’re that much easier for your child to remember. Look for word
families and spelling chunks. Use up to ten words at a time in your
folder, and spend a few days on the same words before moving on to a
new set.
 Walls and notice boards: How many times does your child use the bath-
room? You may think that I’m asking an impertinent question here, but I
have good reason. Your child probably has to pause, begrudgingly, from
important things like playing and eating, to answer the call of Mother
Nature, at least five times a day. If you stick his words at eye level on the
bathroom wall, hey presto, he gets five looks at those words. Am I making
sense? Teachers adorn their walls with fancy, attractive stuff and words.
Take a leaf out of their book. Capitalize on bodily functions and tape your
child’s words near to the porcelain bowl. If you think I’ve sunk to a dis-
tinct low in this section, or you’re outraged by the thought of mixing
spelling with — well you know — then other good places to go with your
sticky tape are above the kitchen counter or facing your child’s bed.
 Word games: Your child likes you to play board games with her. Choose
kids Scrabble, Boggle, or Hangman. Keep an eye out for fun games at
your school supplies store. Kits of letter tiles, especially in cute cases
with word cards, hold great appeal for your child if only because she
likes fitting the letters in the custom-built spaces (a bit like the way-cool
socket set that I mention in Chapter 18).
Using Spelling Lists
Sometimes your evenings will be bleak. Your child brings a spelling list home
from school and doesn’t want to plow through it. The words on such lists
324
Part VI: The Part of Tens 

usually seem chosen arbitrarily, and your child acts like he’s never seen any
of them before in his life. You try bribery coupled with a sunny can-do atti-
tude, but end up cajoling and threatening. Here’s another way to go:
People classify stuff. They order the information that they get so they can
remember and manage it better. People mentally classify who they like, who
to give a wide berth, what they’ll eat and what they really shouldn’t put in
temptation’s range. They likewise classify what they can do and what activi-
ties, for the sake of groaning knees and temperamental shoulders, are best
avoided. Your child classifies things, too. His spelling list will be easier for
him to remember when you help him put some order to it. At the risk of
sounding repetitive, word families and spelling rules are your best friends in
this situation. Have your child grab a highlighter and go looking for families,
rules, and chunks of sound in his spelling list. Group like words together, and
on a scrap piece of paper, have your child jot down any more like words that
jog his memory and help him recall the spelling-list words.
Lists of random words are hard for your child to learn, so help her out by
finding associations and patterns, breaking words into chunks, and using
word families and spelling rules.
Having Sight Words Down Pat
You can help your child dramatically reduce his spelling errors by making
sure that he can quickly spell the words that he needs to spell most often. I’m
talking, of course, about the 220 sight words that comprise about 70 percent
of all the words that people use. Your child uses words like they and would
time and time again, so do him a favor by helping him make those words flow
easily from his pen. Be sure to devote plenty of time to Chapter 12, because
that’s where I give you the whole list of 220 sight words. Over a few days, dic-
tate the words for your child to spell and be sure to catch the ones that he’s
unsure of. Have him jot them down on separate slips of paper. When you
have ten words on ten bits of paper, pop them into an envelope. Have your
child bring his envelope to you every evening for a week for dictation. If ten
words are a bit much for your child to handle, use five. Make your spelling
time companionable and share a hot chocolate or follow up the ten minutes
of spelling by reading to your child. Your child will have all those important
sight words tucked under his belt in just a few weeks.
Libraries and bookshops stock books that consist entirely of sight words so
you can easily read books together and spot sight words at the same time.
325
Chapter 19: Ten Ways to Correct Your Child’s Spelling

Doing Dictation
I know that I talk a lot about dictation, but dictation is good. Of course, it isn’t
the only good thing you can do to improve your child’s spelling. You also can
 Help your child use word families.
 Show your child how to spell in chunks.
 Explain the spelling rules to your child.
 Encourage your child to proofread his writing for spelling mistakes.
But dictation is my personal favorite, primarily because it’s easy for you to
do and it gives your child that on-the-job-training sort of a feel. How does dic-
tation work? Easy. Here are some tips for getting started and staying with it:
 Develop a routine where you’re giving your child things to write on a
regular, but not overwhelming, basis.
 Choose text that your child is comfortable with. She needs to be able to
easily write most of the words and have to figure out only three or four
more difficult ones.
 Choose text from books that your child’s currently reading or material
that she’s pretty familiar with (like a paragraph from a favorite 
storybook).
 Always make sure your child proofreads what she’s written.
 Always check your child’s writing. If she made too many errors, have her
write the dictation again, quicker and with no spelling mistakes.
In case these five quick guidelines left you in a blur, here’s a bit more informa-
tion: Put your child’s spelling plan on the fast track with a ten-week blast of
activity. Practice some words and do a dictation each night. When you decide
to tackle spelling over so many weeks, you may still want to take an occasional
break. Breaks are great for rejuvenating a spelling program, and besides, you’ll
probably find that your child grows weary from spelling if no holiday is on the
horizon. When you get down to a spelling routine, shorter periods are best.
Little kids may be able to maintain their concentration for only 10 minutes, and
even bigger kids work best in 20-minute blasts.
Rummage through schoolbooks and storybooks for sentences to dictate 
to your child. From them, choose a couple of sentences for little kids and 
a paragraph or two for older kids. Choose easy text with only three or four
taxing words. If your child blitzes one dictation, you can aim a little higher
next time. If the text frustrates him, back off a little the next time.
326
Part VI: The Part of Tens 

Erring on the easy side is better than giving your child words and text that
are too difficult. If your child thinks that dictation is too tough to handle, he’ll
want to protect his pride by feigning an I’m-above-this attitude or giving you
a hard time in other ways.
After your child has written his sentences on paper, remind him to proofread
them. Tell him to read his words and check for the right sound chunks and
whether the words look right. Give him an ample supply of scrap paper so
that he can jot down a few trial spellings. When he’s done, check the work
and explain any mistakes. Use a sympathetic tone when pointing out his mis-
takes and cast a thought for the way you’d like someone to correct you if the
boot were on the other foot.
To finish up, have your child do a quick rerun, but time him this time. Set the
challenge of aiming for an error-free piece of writing. If he doesn’t like the
sound of a rerun, just have him jot down the misspelled words on a clean
sheet of paper. You can use the same sentences for your next dictation and
ask him things like: “Do you remember the tricky words from the last time?
Do you think a 100 percent correct dictation this time will be too hard?”
Before I end this section, I need to show you an easy to harder progression to
take with dictations. What follows is a list of simple sentences that you may
want to lead your child through. They start off very simple and gradually get
harder. By the time your child is comfortable with the last sentences, he’s
ready to tackle paragraphs from reading books.
 A fat cat had a nap.
 Ben fed a red hen.
 A big pig sat on a lid.
 Dot got a hot pot.
 A pup had a nap in a box.
 The cat runs in the sun. It is fun.
 Pam got a pet cat. It is in the bed.
 Dan is big. He can put a mug on the top shelf.
 He had a big drink from Ben’s mug.
 The men cut the tops off the plants.
 All of them ran to get a drink at the well.
 It is as black as can be in this shed.
 Can we stop to pet the animals in the hut?
 Thank you for the drink and candy.
 They went for a short ride. When they come back, we should all go to
the store.

Chapter 19: Ten Ways to Correct Your Child’s Spelling

 What did you do to them? They left so suddenly.
 The chimp was swinging on a thick branch.
 Beth had to bring her sister to the play.
 The children sat on the bench to chat.
 It rained all week so the kids had to stay inside the house. It was very
dull.
 The dogs are so small that we need to keep them in a blanket inside the
crate. I think we should feed them milk.
 When she called yesterday, she said she will visit us in three weeks time.
We will have to fix the house so it is clean and neat.
 The grapes were on top of the crate. Pete had to reach up to get them
for Jean. She was so hungry she said she could eat a horse.
 Steve’s wife liked the gift that he gave her. She said she had always
wanted a coat in that shade, but she didn’t often get time to shop at the
large stores.
When you dictate words to your child say them clearly and over pronounce if
it helps with the spelling (like pronouncing certain, as “sur-tayn”). Explain to
your child that dialect and plain ole laziness creep into people’s everyday
speech so enunciating clearly is useful for figuring out spellings.

Baa, Baa, Who?
When my kids were toddlers, we sang great
songs like “Eensy Weensy Spider” and “Old
MacDonald.” Call me old-fashioned (I can’t hear
you anyway), but “Eensy Weensy Spider” was a
nicer song (by miles) than the pop stuff my kids
sing these days. I was fond of good old Eensy
Weensy. I was even more fond of the black
sheep in the song “Baa Baa Black Sheep.” At
first I didn’t think that those black sheep were
so great, but then I happened to hear my daugh-
ter singing to herself. Not skipping a beat she
was belting out, “Baa Baa Blatchley, have you
any wool? Clearly, she was buying her wool
from Mr. Baa Baa Blatchley, and why not? My
child had heard “Baa Baa Black Sheep,” the
song, many times before she realized that “Baa
Baa Blatchley” should’ve been “Baa Baa Black
Sheep.” When you dictate words to your child,
even though she’s heard them before, speak
clearly. Exaggerate your pronunciation at times,
if it helps her get the spelling. Later she’ll be
able to spell words without your creative help,
and you’ll miss giving it! It was a sorry day for
me when I had to bid Mr. Blatchley farewell.

W
hen I was a college student, I lived in a very small house with a bunch
of other students. Next door lived a man in his 80s, named Alf, whom
we rarely saw. One hot summer day, my household, with sun oil, sodas, and
sound system, squeezed into our tiny yard to catch some rays. Alf came out.
He took in the scene and said, “Nice to be young isn’t it?”
It is nice to be young. It’s especially nice to be a kid with friends and fun things
to do. After you’ve read through lists of words with your child and noted any
weird spellings, rustle up some friends for the fun activities that I give you in
this chapter. If you’re a schoolteacher, you’ll be pleased to find that the first
few activities on my list can be used with large groups of players.
Simple Battleships
You probably remember playing “Battleships” when you were a kid. Here’s a
cute adaptation.
Activity: Battling with simple word ships
Preparation: Have each player draw two grids of 5 squares by 5 squares (or
25 squares in all). Under the bottom line of squares, label the columns A, B,
C, D, and E. On the left of the vertical axis and starting from the bottom row,
label the rows 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5. 

Follow these steps:
1. Have your players each write down the same list of any 10 words.
Have them copy the words inside one of the grids, one word per square,
in any arrangement. 
2. The words are now battleships, and each player tries to sink the other
player’s battleships. Here’s how it works:
1. Player 1: Using your blank grid to mark all your calls, call out a grid
reference like B2 and mark it on your chart as a hit or miss (you
can use the words “hit” and “miss” or symbols like a circle for a hit
and a square for a miss). 
2. Player 2: Tell Player 1 whether she called a hit or a miss. If she
called a hit, cross off your battleship, and wait for her next call
because she gets another call for every hit.
3. Take turns repeating the above steps.
The last player with battleships still afloat wins.
Intense Battleships
Just like it sounds, here is a much more detailed and “intense” version of the
battleships game.
Activity: Battling with intense word ships
Preparation: Have each player draw two grids of 10 squares by 10 squares
(100 squares in all). Under the bottom line label the columns A, B, C, D, E, F,
G, H, I, and J. On the left of the vertical axis, label the rows 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8,
9, and 10.
Follow these steps:
1. Have your players each write the same five pairs of words, plotted on
the grid next to each other like a continuous word and 10 single
words. 
Pairs of words are submarines and must share a common characteristic,
such as coming from the same word family or starting with the same
letter. A sub counts as one unit, so if one square gets hit, the whole sub
is hit. You can add more kinds of words and call them names like heli-
copters and jets, if you want to get really whiz-bang about it. 
2. Have players plot their subs and ships and continue just as you would
in the “Battling with simple word ships” activity.

Part VI: The Part of Tens 

Word Bingo
I probably wouldn’t tell anyone but you this but I adore a good game of
Bingo. Rustle up some friends and simple prizes (like markers, notepads, or
chocolates) and have fun with this easy adaptation.
Activity: Whole-word bingo
Preparation: Make a list of 20 words. Have players make their own bingo
cards, by drawing grids of 5 squares by 4 squares (20 squares in all).
Follow these steps:
1. Ask players to fill their bingo cards with 1 word in each square, from
a list of 20 words that you give them. 
2. From your own copy of the words, call out words for players to cross
off their cards. BINGO can be either a full card crossed out or a line
crossed out (vertically, horizontally, or diagonally).
Bits-of-Words Bingo
I warned you that I’m a closet bingo fan so you’re probably expecting yet
another variation of Bingo. This cute version gets players thinking about a
stack of spelling chunks; in fact, any that you want your child to get more
practice with.
Activity: Word-part bingo
Preparation: Have your copy of this book open to this list of 20 word parts:
ing, ed, le, al, able, ent, ant, tion, cian, sion, tch, all, re, ly, th, wh, ch, sh, ee, and
oa. Have players make their own bingo cards, by drawing grids of 5 squares
by 4 squares (20 squares in all). You’ll, of course, need paper and pens or
pencils.
Follow these step:
1. Read the list of word parts to the players. 
2. Ask the players to make words from each part and then fill out their
bingo cards with the words. 
3. Call out the word parts and check spellings at the end of the game (or
trade cards and have playing partners check each others’ spellings).

Chapter 20: Ten (or More) Group Activities That Rock

Putting Your Hands on the Table
Here’s a really fun activity for a group. You may want to match spelling words
to each player’s ability. Beginners get easier words, like brick, while experts
get words like superstitious.
Activity: Hands on the table
Preparation: Gather a bunch of players, minimum of four so you have two
teams each of two players, and prepare a list of words to read out loud to the
teams. You have access to plenty of them in your copy of Teaching Kids to
Spell For Dummies, so preparation shouldn’t be too difficult. Have paper and
pens and pencils ready for the players or teams.
Follow these steps:
1. Divide players into two or more teams. 
2. Ask one player from the first team to write down a word that you read
aloud. 
3. If the player gets it right, ask a player from the next team to write a
word. 
4. Give each player on the teams a chance to write and spell a word. 
5. Whenever a player gives an incorrect spelling, he puts his hands on
the table, and his question moves to the next player on the opposing
team in the usual order. 
The team whose players all have their hands on the table first loses.
To add spice to the “Hands on the table” activity, try any or all these frills:
 Give each player a set amount of time to answer and ring a bell when the
time’s up.
 Award goodbye gifts when a child puts his hands on the table (jelly
beans, raisins, cookies, and so on).
 Play this game in rounds and play a blast of music at the end of each
round.
 Present a winner’s token: A mug (returnable) filled with marshmallows
to eat in class, a cute or funny soft toy to keep for the day, stickers,
erasers, or pencils.
 Include surprise questions like, “What color of sweater is Mr. Hill wear-
ing today?”

Part VI: The Part of Tens 

Finding Your Family
The “Finding your word family” activity is a fun game when players use
indoor voices and don’t pull cards off players’ backs. Tell your kids this and
compliment players who mingle politely. You’ll soon see why I mention this.
Activity: Finding your word family
Preparation: You need at least 12 players for this activity and space for them
to mill around. Have four or five word families in mind before play begins, with
at least three words in each family (like ball, call, small, and tall; string, thing,
sing, and fling; moon, broom, spook, and food; and meet, seed, wheel, and free).
You need some adhesive tape and each player needs an index card and pen.
Follow these steps: 
1. Divide the group into teams of three or four. 
2. Give each player an index card with tape so that it can be stuck to
someone else’s back. 
3. Name each team with a word family (all, ing, oo, and ee). 
4. Have players on each team write a different word (from their respec-
tive families) on their index cards (players do this together, coopera-
tively). 
5. Next, all players cover their words and find a player from a different
team on whose back they can stick their words so that each one shows
on another person’s back. 
6. After everyone’s back is tagged with a word, players are told to mill
around the entire group trying to find out what words are on their
backs. 
Each player can find out what his word is by asking what the word is or
asking one player to tell him the first letter, another to tell him the
second, and so on until he has the whole word or asking other players
questions that they can only respond to with yes or no (like is there an a
in my word, is the a the first letter, and suchlike). 
7. Players finish the game by joining together with the other members of
their new word-family teams. 
Time the entire group to see how quickly they complete this activity.
Run and Write
The “Racing and writing” activity up next is best for groups of six or more
players. You may want to limber up and don your sneakers for this one.
333
Chapter 20: Ten (or More) Group Activities That Rock

Activity: Racing and writing
Preparation: Divide players up into teams of at least two players. Place 10 or
20 words into a bucket or other container for each team, duplicating the
words so each team gets the same words. Each team also needs either a
whiteboard and marker or poster paper and a marker to play.
Follow these steps:
1. Put the bucket or container of words at one end of a room and the
paper or board at the other end. (You can even span a few rooms if you
want, but if you do, you’ll probably need to designate a referee to keep
watch.) 
2. Team members take turns racing to pick a word from their buckets,
taking it in hand to the board, and writing it. All teams start at the
same time. 
The team that finishes first wins. If the winning team makes any spelling
errors, have a short rematch with five new words.
You may want to set strict rules before you start. For instance, unsporting
behavior from a player earns his entire team 20 push-ups apiece.
For extra hype, play loud, fast music when teams are racing.
To emphasize the look, cover, write method, place a bucket just in front of
the board. Players must drop the word into the bucket before writing it on
the board.
Run and Finger-Write
Your kids need physical movement, and this activity is a good way to get it.
To help them remain quiet during the finger-writing, have them do a small
workout before starting the game. Try ten push-ups, ten high kicks (like the
Can-Can dance), and ten jumping jacks.
The “Racing and finger-writing” activity up next is best for groups of six or
more players.
Activity: Racing and finger-writing
Preparation: Like in “Racing and writing,” divide players in to teams of at least
two players, and have a bucket of the same words for each team. Provide a
whiteboard and marker, or poster paper and marker for each team.
334
Part VI: The Part of Tens 

Follow these steps:
1. Play this game just like “Racing and writing,” but in this game the
runner has to finger-write (no ink, just finger pressure) the word onto
the next player’s back. 
2. The player on whose back the word was written then writes the word
onto the whiteboard (no talking allowed) and then takes his turn run-
ning for a new word. 
3. The last player runs three extra laps (a lap is to the bucket and back),
because he doesn’t get to do any finger-writing. 
If the winning team makes spelling errors, have a short rematch of five new
words.
Run, Figure Out, and Write
Here’s a game that pretty much has it all — movement, mental challenge, and
getting spellings onto paper.
Activity: Racing and defining
Preparation: The preparation for this game is the same as for “Racing and writ-
ing,” but instead of placing words into the buckets, use clues about words. The
clues that I give you here are for the words in Table 20-1, but you can adapt this
activity to virtually any of the tables in this book. Don’t let your kids in on the
answers the way I have for you in parentheses (as my kids would say now,
“Well, duh!”), but give each team a copy of Table 20-1 so they can find the
answers for themselves.
Follow these steps:
1. Put the buckets of clues at one end of a room and the papers or
boards at the other end. 
2. Players have to go in turn to pick a clue from their bucket, race to
their board, and when they’ve cracked the clue, write the right word. 
3. All teams start together. The fastest team wins two points; a correct
answer wins one point. If the winning team makes errors (wrong words
and/or wrong spellings), have a short rematch with five new words.
List of clues:
• Not possible (Answer: impossible)
• Someone who’s in your family (Answer: relation)
• I can count on you; you’re this (Answer: reliable)
• Extremely good or bright (Answer: brilliant)
335
Chapter 20: Ten (or More) Group Activities That Rock

• A competition (Answer: tournament)
• I saw you right away, you’re . . . (Answer: noticeable)
• Where you catch a train (Answer: station)
• You change your mind a lot; you’re this (Answer: changeable)
• Easily seen (Answer: visible)
• You can eat it; it’s . . . (Answer: edible)
• What you see in a mirror or pond (Answer: reflection)
• When someone says something nice about you it’s a (Answer: 
compliment)
• When you agree about something you may sign a written (Answer:
agreement)
• A helper (Answer: assistant)
• Faraway (Answer: distant)
When handing out Table 20-1 to each team, you may want to remind players
about these two rules for adding suffixes:
 Drop the e before you add i-n-g (or any other suffix that starts with a
vowel) with words like make. So why, you’re asking, do you keep the e in
notice when you tack on able to write noticeable? Because the e retains
the soft-c sound. Do the same with soft-g words like changeable.
 Change the y to i and then add ed (or any other suffix that starts with a
vowel — except ing) with words like rely. You can’t have two i’s together,
so to speak, so hang onto the y to turn rely into relying.

Boxes
The “Drawing boxes with words” activity up next is good for three or more
players.
336
Part VI: The Part of Tens 

Activity: Drawing boxes with words
Preparation: Draw a grid of 4 dots by 4 dots (16 dots altogether) on a white-
board or poster.
Follow these steps:
1. If possible, divide the players into two teams. 
2. Players must take turns spelling the words that you give them. 
3. For each correct answer, players get to draw a line between two dots
on the grid — vertically or horizontally. 
4. Teams try to complete boxes, because the player who completes a box
marks it with team’s insignia (or letter) and gets to draw one extra line
and the team that gets most boxes wins. 
The challenging part of Boxes is to win boxes without enabling the opposi-
tion to get boxes. Remember, any time your team fills in the third line of a
box, the opposition gets to fill in the fourth line and claim that box.
You can play “Boxes” with only two players, but more than two is much more
fun, because everyone likes to advise other players where to draw their lines.
If you end up playing with two players, and you’re one of them, give your child
five spellings to start off the game. For each correct spelling, he gets to draw a
line and you wait. This gives him a potential lead over you of five lines. After
his five spellings, take turns drawing a line with no spellings required.
Pictures
Okay, so you caught me; I’ve now reached my quota of ten games. But hey,
everyone loves a good game! So here are three more, and while I’m at it, I’ll
show you a game for a happy duo.

Games for Grandma
I always give a copy of my latest book to my mom
and dad (I’m hopelessly generous!). I don’t really
expect them to read my books, but I know they
like to have them on display. Last week my mom
phoned me. “Your book’s great,” she gushed. I
thought she was just being kind, but then she
explained how the book had actually come in
handy: One of my nieces visits my parents regu-
larly and, of course, likes to play. She doesn’t
have any siblings, though, so my parents often
end up scratching their heads for inspiration
about what to do. During the most recent visit, my
mom was showing off my book, “Teaching Kids
to Read For Dummies,” to my sister-in-law. The
pages fell open at the games, and voilà!
Apparently everyone played nicely for the entire
afternoon and now my mom’s reading the book
from cover to cover. Go Grandma!

The “Drawing pictures with words” activity is an adaptation of the game
Pictionary.
Activity: Drawing pictures with words
Preparation: You’ll need large paper and marker, or even better, a whiteboard
and marker or blackboard chalk. Fill a bowl with words that lend themselves
to drawings (fright, flight, knit, and squash, for example).
Follow these steps: 
1. Divide players into two teams, each with a “scribe” whose job is to draw
and write. Teams with more than two players can rotate this role. 
2. The scribe from one team takes a word from the bowl and must write
one letter on her board and provide lines as spaces for the other let-
ters of the word. 
3. Next she draws a picture of the word (no letters or numbers allowed
in the picture). 
4. While she’s drawing, players call out what they think the word is (no
need to take turns or be civilized, just let rip!) 
5. The player who guesses the word must spell the word without any help
from teammates for the scribe to write (now teammates must be quiet). 
6. Set a time limit of two minutes per word and disallow words when-
ever players talk during spelling time. 
7. The next turn goes to the other team. Every third and fourth turn is
open play, in which the scribe from each team draws the picture for her
team, and both teams race to be the first to guess the word. 
The first team to get ten words (or points) wins.
Modify and tweak “Drawing pictures with words” to suit the players: Set a
three-minute time limit for younger kids. If players are rowdy, award bonus
points for quiet play. Allow younger kids to be given two letters.
Oh No!
The “Oh, no!” activity is an adaptation of the card game Old Maid.
Activity: Oh, no!
Preparation: For all intents and purposes, this game is actually Old Maid (if
you know that game), except that you call the Old Maid card the Oh No card.
Choose eight words and write each one on four separate cards. Make an “Oh
No” card, giving you a total of 33 cards.
338
Part VI: The Part of Tens 

Follow these steps:
1. Shuffle all cards. Deal them all out. 
2. Players have to make sets of four identical words. Starting with the
player to the left of the dealer, players take a card from the players to
their right, and add the card to their packs.(Each time it’s their turn,
players try to make a set of cards, and then fan out their pack for the
player on the left to select another card. 
3. When a player has a set (or four identical cards), he must lay it face
down and spell the word out loud. If he spells the word correctly, he
keeps the set; if he doesn’t it goes into a lost pile that no one can have. 
The player with the most sets wins. The player who ends up with the Oh No
card has to pack away the cards.
To make this game more challenging you can make family sets (like ball, call,
fall, and wall) rather than identical word sets (like wall, wall, wall, and wall).
You can make the Oh No card anything you want (Sore Loser, Ha Ha, So
Yesterday, and so on), but remember that the backs of the cards all have to
look the same. You can be fairly sure that one of your kids will try bending a
corner of the Oh No card when no one’s looking, so give your “I have eyes in
the back of my head” speech early on!
Wake Up!
The “Wake up and spell the word!” activity is a game that’s good for young
kids. If you’re used to playing games with older kids, and they’re not easily
embarrassed, they may also like this activity .
Activity: Wake up and spell the word!
Preparation: Jot down six words you want each player to spell. Have all play-
ers lie down on their backs.
Follow this step: Ask each player in turn to spell a word. A correct answer
enables the player to make one move toward standing up, in this order:
1. Roll onto your side.
2. Prop yourself up on one arm.
3. Kneel on all fours.
4. Squat back on your heels.
5. Put one knee up.
6. Stand up.
339
Chapter 20: Ten (or More) Group Activities That Rock

If a player can’t spell the word, you can do different things, depending on the
age of your players. You can:
 Provide clues until the child gets the answer right
 Let another player answer on behalf of the player who got the word
wrong
 Move to the next player
When all players are standing, have them do an on-the-spot drill comprised 
of simulated wake-up activities: jogging to loosen those limbs, stretching and
yawning, racing to the bathroom, cleaning your teeth, brushing your hair,
running to the school bus, or climbing the steps. Whew you made it!
For fun give players a sleeping prop (pillow, blanket, candy pacifier) and play
sleepy music. And you can have someone blow a horn or whistle after each
correct word. Make sure that you praise kids who stay quietest and stillest.
Big kids want players to stay down when they make spelling mistakes, so
make light of that. Award a sour candy as a bitter spelling pill or entrust a
teddy bear to the sleepy player for a set amount of time. Make it so that no
one minds staying down in this game; in fact, it’s sort of fun.
If you want to modify this game next time around, have players start in a dif-
ferent position. Have them lie down with their legs in the air, arms twisted
(like the eagle pose in yoga), and eyes shut. They unravel a bit each time they
get a correct answer (one leg down, two legs down, arms untwisted, eyes
open, kneel on two knees, kneel on one knee, stand, and so on).
One More! Just for Two
I guess that two people don’t really count as a group, but I include the good
old “Chutes and ladders” activity for two players, because it’s simple and
great for kids who like to create. Making the board can be an artistic bonanza
and you can laminate the finished product so that it sees you through plenty
of play.
Activity: Chutes and ladders (with spell-to-throw)
Preparations: Have your kids draw a big chutes and ladders board, 10 squares
by 10 squares, numbering the squares along the bottom row from 1 to 10 left
to right, and then from 11 to 20 left to right in the next row up and so on all 
the way to 100. Have them draw chutes and ladders on the board at varying
inclines. Because you need a pack of spelling words, you can either write them
yourself or have another child do it. You also need a cup and a dice for players
to share, and playing pieces for each player — you can use buttons or pieces
from other games you have or, as a creative extra, ask players if they want to
340
Part VI: The Part of Tens 

provide their own special piece (preferably one that fits inside a single square,
like a button and not something like a toy giant panda).
Follow these steps:
1. The player who isn’t taking his turn takes a spelling card and reads
the word to the other player. 
2. That player then spells the word. 
3. If he spells correctly, he shakes and throws the dice and moves his
marker according to the number on the dice. He can use paper and
pen to try out different spellings before he gives you his answer but for-
feits his turn when he gives an incorrect answer. 
4. A score of six on the dice gets that player an extra throw of the dice. 
The first player to reach square 100 wins.
Poetry magnets are fun too and come in huge assortments. Many come in
word parts: the “ly” magnet, for example, comes separately from the love
magnet.

Enjoying toyshop favorites
You can find several word-based games in
toyshops. The two that have been around for
years are Scrabble and Boggle. Both games are
available in junior and hand-held electronic ver-
sions. You can also watch for letter tiles and
magnetic letters to put on your refrigerator.
Bear in mind, however, that magnetic tiles aren’t
usually a big hit with kids until you join in the fun.
Get together with your child in front of your
refrigerator and make words together. Make a
word of the day every day for a week. Put the
letters away and bring them out again in a few
weeks so they seem new and interesting all

Ten Spelling Games for Car Trips

 Going beyond “I Spy”
 Working out word patterns
N
obody in their right mind wants to be holed up in a car with fractious
kids. But it happens. When I’m trapped in my car with my kids and
they’re chock-full of junk food and have broken all the free toys in hand-to-
hand combat, we play the games I describe to you in this chapter.
Cards in the Car
Your child can be a better speller simply by doing regular spelling in a fun
way. One fun way to fix spellings in your child’s mind is to take a pack of
them with you in the car or in your bag (spellings, not kids). Your child can
spell them out to you in one continuous stream (taking a breath now and
then), or you can test him on words when you’re waiting in line or at lights.
Here are some card-using tips:
 If you write your own words, make sure that you have an envelope to
keep them in.
 Have your child write the date and number of words correctly spelled on
the envelope or stick stickers on it to keep track. Color-code the stickers
to show how many words he spelled right each time.
 Keep adding new words.
 Keep a notepad and pencil, a blackboard and chalk, or whiteboard and
dry markers in the car (pencil, chalk, and dry markers won’t mar your
upholstery).
If you want to buy boxes of preprinted words, check out these:
 Easy Vowels boxed set by Frank Schaffer. Includes three-letter, short-
vowel words you can start with and long-vowel words to use later.

 Easy Blends and Digraphs boxed set by Frank Schaffer. Use these after
three-letter words. Do the blends first and then work on the long vowels.
 Sight Words boxed sets by Frank Schaffer. These cards come in boxes of
100 words (first 100, second 100, and so on). You get the word on one
side of the card and the word in a sentence on the other side.

Hangman
In case you’re not familiar with Hangman (which sounds terribly gruesome
but is only real creepy!), here’s how it works. Your child thinks of a word. She
writes down a bunch of underscores equal to the number of letters in her
word. She tells you how many letters are in her word and you have to guess
what letters are used. When you guess a correct letter, your child writes that
letter on its appropriate underscore. If you incorrectly guess a letter, she jots
down the letter (so you both know that that letter’s already been used) and
begins to draw a person in the process of being hanged (that’s the creepy
factor!). The basic hangman picture is a gallows (ugh) that looks like a bas-
ketball hoop, only the net is a rope, with a stick-figure person attached. Your
child draws the figure bit-by-bit adding one bit each time you guess an incor-
rect letter. (She starts by drawing a head for the first wrong letter. With the
next wrong letter she adds a line for the body. With each additional wrong
letter she adds a body part such as an arm or leg, followed by hands and feet.
Depending on how long she wants you to guess she can add each of the ten
fingers and toes!) 
Describing and Drawing the Letters
I invented this game on a particularly long and arduous car journey and was
amazed by how long it amused my kids. I started out desperately attempting
to divert my kids from yet another fight. “Look at that A!” I cried enthusiasti-
cally. “Doesn’t it look just like a tepee with a bed in it.” After a brief puzzled
silence, my kids got right into this visualization. They came up with ideas for
every letter, capitals and lowercase, and took turns (almost unheard of!)
drawing their images on a blackboard that before then lay untouched for
months in the car.

I Spy with My Little Eye
I Spy With My Little Eye is a timeless favorite on car journeys. If you were
never recruited by an I Spyer as a kid, here’s how the game goes. Look out for
an object inside or outside of your car and have your child guess what the
object is. Give him a clue by saying, “I spy with my little eye something begin-
ning with B (or whatever letter starts the name of your object). Adapt your
clue for little kids, by saying, “I spy with my little eye something beginning
with buh (the sound of the letter).”
Going to Aunt Maud’s
This game is all about cracking a word rule. To start the game, say the follow-
ing sentence, but fill in the blank space with any word you like:
“I’m going to Aunt Maud’s and I’m taking a _____ with me.”
Maybe you decide that only words with a double letter can be used in the
game, so you take your boots. Your child’s job is to figure out that your secret
rule is “words with double letters.” Read this dialogue and you’ll see how the
game progresses (your hints are in bold):
I’m going to Aunt Maud’s and I’m taking my boots with me.
I’m going to Aunt Maud’s too, can I bring a bag?
Sorry, no, you can’t bring a bag.
I’m going to Aunt Maud’s and I’m taking some cheese with me.
I’m going to Aunt Maud’s too, can I bring a blanket?
Sorry, no, you can’t bring a blanket.
Your child can take things like mittens, eggs, apples, cheese, glasses, books,
and balloons, but she can’t take things like milk, socks, shoes, and chocolate.
Names
The names game is easy. The spelling skills required are at the little-kid level,
but your big kids will jump right in on this activity, too. All you have to do is
go through each letter of the alphabet thinking of a person’s name for each
letter. Start with girls’ names (there are more of them!) and see how you fare
when you get to the letter U. One of my kids once came up with “Umbrella”
when she was stuck on U, and we had a cute diversion into the kind of prob-
lems Umbrella might face and what would be the worse name to have.

Shopping at Macy’s
Another work-your-way-through-the-alphabet game, Shopping at Macy’s, asks
players to think of an item they’d buy at Macy’s and then each successive
player has to repeat all the items that have already been mentioned before
adding her own. The dialogue looks like this.
First player: I went to Macy’s and bought an amber ring.
Second player: I went to Macy’s and bought an amber ring and a red bag.
Third player: I went to Macy’s and bought an amber ring, a red bag,
and a purple coat.
Songs
Most of us enjoy breaking out in song even when those around us aren’t all
that appreciative. Songs are good. They draw your child’s attention to rhyme
and wordplay, which help her auditory discrimination and her phonemic
awareness. So you have every reason to teach your child the songs you grew
up with. Some of my stalwarts are:
 Ten Green Bottles
 She’ll Be Coming Round The Mountain When She Comes
 One Man Went To Mow
 At The Quartermaster’s Store
 There Were Ten In The Bed (And The Little One Said)
Word Find
A good game for keeping your child amused in the store, in Word Find, you
give your child a notepad and pencil, jot down five letters and ask him to find
words that begin with those letters. Other write-them-down topics can be
favorite foods, or animals, or long words that he can see around him. You can
use this game in the car as well as in the store.
Fortunetellers (or Origami Cruets)
Although not a great hit with boys, this activity keeps girls amused for ages.
The kids call it Fortunes, but my husband tells me (and he swears that he
346
Part VI: The Part of Tens 

knows such things) that it originates from pre-saltshaker days. Apparently
when salt was less refined and was pinched (in lumps) onto your food, it was
put into a cruet along with pepper and other condiments. You pinched up
what you needed out of the four little dishes of the cruet. Whenever you trav-
eled, you made a cruet from paper. When you turn this fortuneteller upside
down, you’ll see that it’s a cruet. (Or else my husband made it up!)
Activity: Fortuneteller
Preparation: Get a piece of writing paper (computer paper works well). Tear
off a strip to make the paper a square.
Follow these steps: 
1. Fold the four corners into the center of the square so that you’ve
made a smaller square with four triangle flaps facing you. 
2. Turn the paper over and do the same thing again. You may want to
rotate your square first to get a good grip on the corners. 
3. Keeping your paper this way up, pick it up and fold it in half so that
you see four pockets on the outside. 
4. Put the finger and thumb of one hand into two of these pockets and
pinch them together. Do the same on the other side. 
5. You’ll be able to move the fortune-teller open and shut in two direc-
tions with your fingers and thumbs in four compartments that move.
6. Flatten your fortuneteller like it was before. On the side with four
square flaps, have your child write the name of one color on each
flap.
7. Have your child turn the fortuneteller over and number (1 through 8)
the eight small triangles facing you. 
8. Next you open these eight triangles and write a fortune on the back of
each one. The eight fortunes can be things like:
• You will marry before you’re 20.
• You’ll have six kids.
• You’ll be rich.
• You’ll live to 100.
• Your true love will find you.
• You love animals.
• You’ll be very lucky.
• A boy likes you.
347
Chapter 21: Ten Spelling Games for Car Trips

Now you’re all set. Your child pesters you forevermore. Her routine is this:
Her: “What color?” (Showing you your choices of four different colors.)
You: “Red.” (Choosing a nice short word!)
Her: “R-E-D.” (She moves her fortuneteller three times (corresponding
with the three letters in “RED”), revealing a set of numbers.) “What
number?”
You: (You read her numbers and choose . . . ) “One.” (Of course, because
it’s going to take less time!)
Her: “One.” ( . . . she says as she moves her fortuneteller one move.)
What number?
You: “Two.”
Her: (She unfolds No. 2 and reads your fortune.) 
You’re hoping for “I will go away and give you several hours of peace.”
