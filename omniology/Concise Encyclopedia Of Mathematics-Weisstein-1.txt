Introduction 
The 
CRC 
Concise 
Encyclopedia 
of ibfuthemutics 
is a compendium 
of mathematical 
definitions, 
formulas, 
figures, 
tabulations, 
and references. 
It is written 
in an informal 
style 
intended 
to make 
it accessible 
to a broad 
spectrum 
of readers 
with 
a wide 
range 
of mathematical 
backgrounds 
and interests. 
Although 
mathematics 
is 
a fascinating 
subject, 
it all too frequently 
is clothed 
in specialized 
jargon 
and dry formal 
exposition 
that 
make 
many 
interesting 
and 
useful 
mathematical 
results 
inaccessible 
to laypeople. 
This 
problem 
is often 
further 
compounded 
by the 
difficulty 
in locating 
concrete 
and 
easily 
unders+ood 
examples. 
To 
give 
perspective 
to 
a subject, 
I find 
it helpful 
to learn 
why 
it is useful, 
how it is connected 
to other 
areas 
of mathematics 
and 
science, 
and 
how 
it 
is actually 
implemented. 
While 
a picture 
may 
be worth 
a thousand 
words, 
explicit 
examples 
are worth 
at least 
a few hundred! 
This 
work 
attempts 
to provide 
enough 
details 
to give 
the reader 
a flavor 
for a subject 
without 
getting 
lost 
in minutiae. 
While 
absolute 
rigor 
may 
suffer 
somewhat, 
I hope 
the 
improvement 
in usefulness 
and 
readability 
will 
more 
than 
make 
up for the deficiencies 
of this 
approach. 
The 
format 
of this 
work 
is somewhere 
between 
a handbook, 
a dictionary, 
and 
an encyclopedia. 
It differs 
from 
existing 
dictionaries 
of mathematics 
in a number 
of important 
ways. 
First,, 
the 
entire 
text 
and 
all 
the 
equations 
and 
figures 
are available 
in searchable 
electronic 
form 
on CD-ROM. 
Second, 
the 
entries 
are 
extensively 
cross-linked 
and 
cross-referenced, 
not 
only 
to related 
entries 
but 
also 
to many 
external 
sites 
on the 
Internet,. 
This 
makes 
locating 
information 
very 
convenient. 
It 
also 
provides 
a highly 
efficient 
way 
to 
“navigate” 
from 
one related 
concept 
to another, 
a feature 
that 
is especially 
powerful 
in the 
electronic 
version. 
Standard 
mathematical 
references, 
combined 
with 
a few popular 
ones, 
are also 
given 
at the 
end of 
most 
entries 
to facilitate 
additional 
reading 
and 
exploration. 
In the interests 
of offering 
abundant 
examples, 
this 
work 
also contains 
a large 
number 
of explicit 
formulas 
and 
derivations, 
providing 
a ready 
place 
to locate 
a particular 
formula, 
as well 
as including 
the 
framework 
for understanding 
where 
it comes 
from. 
The 
selection 
of topics 
in 
this 
work 
is more 
extensive 
than 
in 
most 
mathematical 
dictionaries 
(e.g., 
Borowski 
and Borwein’s 
Harper-Collins 
Dictionary 
of Mathematics 
and Jeans 
and Jeans’ 
Muthematics 
Dictio- 
nary). 
At the same 
time, 
the descriptions 
are more 
accessible 
than 
in “technical” 
mathematical 
encyclopedias 
(e.g., 
Hazewinkel’s 
Encyclopaedia 
of Mathematics 
and 
Iyanaga’s 
Encyclopedic 
Dictionary 
of Mathematics). 
While 
the 
latter 
remain 
models 
of accuracy 
and 
rigor, 
they 
are not 
terribly 
useful 
to the 
undergraduate, 
research 
scientist, 
or recreational 
mathematician. 
In this 
work, 
the most 
useful, 
interesting, 
and 
entertaining 
(at least 
t o my 
mind) 
aspects 
of topics 
are discussed 
in addition 
to their 
technical 
definitions. 
For example, 
in my 
entry 
for pi (n), 
the definition 
in terms 
of the 
diameter 
and 
circumference 
of a circle 
is supplemented 
by a great 
many 
formulas 
and 
series 
for pi, including 
some 
of the 
amazing 
discoveries 
of Ramanujan. 
These 
formulas 
are comprehensible 
to readers 
with 
only 
minimal 
mathematical 
background, 
and 
are interesting 
to 
both 
those 
with 
and 
without 
formal 
mathematics 
training. 
However, 
they 
have 
not previously 
been 
collected 
in a single 
convenient 
location. 
For this 
reason, 
I hope 
that, 
in addition 
to serving 
as a reference 
source, 
this 
work 
has some 
of the 
same 
flavor 
and 
appeal 
of Martin 
Gardner’s 
delightful 
Scientific 
American 
columns. 
Everything 
in this 
work 
has been 
compiled 
by me alone. 
I am 
an astronomer 
by training, 
but 
have picked 
up 
a fair 
bit 
of mathematics 
along 
the 
way. 
It 
never 
ceases 
to amaze 
me 
how 
mathematical 
connections 
weave 
their 
way through 
the 
physical 
sciences. 
It frequently 
transpires 
that 
some 
piece 
of recently 
acquired 
knowledge 
turns 
out, to be just 
what 
I need 
to solve 
some 
apparently 
unrelated 
problem. 
I have 
therefore 
developed 
the 
habit 
of picking 
up and 
storing 
away 
odd 
bits 
of information 
for future 
use. 
This 
work 
has 
provided 
a mechanism 
for organizing 
what 
has turned 
out 
to be a fairly 
large 
collection 
of mathematics. 
I 
have 
also 
found 
it very 
difficult 
to find 
clear 
yet 
accessible 
explanations 
of technical 
mathematics 
unless 
I 
already 
have 
some 
familiarity 
with 
the subject. 
I hope 
this 
encyclopedia 
will 
provide 
jumping-off 
points 
for 
people 
who are interested 
in the 
subjects 
listed 
here 
but 
who, 
like 
me, 
are not 
necessarily 
experts. 
The 
encyclopedia 
has been 
compiled 
over 
the 
last 
11 years 
or so, beginning 
in my 
college 
years 
and 
continuing 
during 
graduate 
school. 
The 
initial 
document 
was written 
in Microsoj? 
Word@ on a Mac 
Plus@ 
computer, 
and 
had 
reached 
about 
200 pages 
by the time 
I started 
graduate 
school 
in 
1990. 
When 
Andrew 
Treverrow 
made 
his OLQX 
program 
available 
for the 
Mac, 
I began 
the 
task 
of converting 
all my documents 
to 7&X, 
resulting 
in a vast improvement 
in readability. 
While 
undertaking 
the 
Word 
to T&X 
conversion, 
I also 
began 
cross-referencing 
entries, 
anticipating 
that 
eventually 
I would 
be able 
to convert, 
the 
entire 
document 

to hypertext. 
This hope was realized 
beginning 
in 1995, when the Internet 
explosion 
was ifi full swing and 
I learned 
of Nikos Drakes’s 
excellent 
7QX to HTML 
converter, 
UTG2HTML. 
After 
some additional 
effort, 
I was able to post an HTML 
version 
of my encyclopedia 
to the World 
Wide 
Web, currently 
located 
at 
www.astro.virginia.edu/-eww6n/math/. 
The selection 
of topics included 
in this compendium 
is not based on any fixed set of criteria, 
but rather 
reflects my own random 
walk through 
mathematics. 
In truth, 
there is no good way of selecting topics in such 
a work. 
The mathematician 
James Sylvester 
may have summed 
up the situation 
most aptly. 
According 
to 
Sylvester 
(as quoted 
in the introduction 
to Ian Stewart’s 
book From Here to Inj%ity), 
“Mathematics 
is not 
a book confined 
within 
a cover and bound 
between 
brazen clasps, whose contents 
it needs only patience 
to 
ransack; it is not a mine, whose treasures may take long to reduce into possession, but which fill only a limited 
number 
of veins and lodes; it is not a soil, whose fertility 
can be exhausted 
by the yield of successive harvests; 
it is not a continent 
or an ocean, whose area can be mapped 
out and its “contour 
defined; 
it is as limitless 
as 
that space which 
it finds 
too 
narrow 
for its aspiration; 
its possibilities 
are as infinite 
as the worlds which are 
forever 
crowding 
in and multiplying 
upon the astronomer’s 
gaze; it is as incapable 
of being restricted 
within 
assigned boundaries 
or being reduced 
to definitions 
of permanent 
validity, 
as the consciousness 
of life.” 
Several of Sylvester’s 
points 
apply particularly 
to this undertaking. 
As he points out, mathematics 
itself 
cannot 
be confined 
to the pages of a book. 
The results of mathematics, 
however, 
are shared and passed 
on primarily 
through 
the printed 
(and now electronic) 
medium. 
While 
there is no danger 
of mathematical 
results being lost through 
lack of dissemination, 
many people miss out on fascinating 
and useful mathematical 
results simply because they are not aware of them. 
Not only does collecting 
many results in one place provide 
a single starting 
point for mathematical 
exploration, 
but it should also lessen the aggravation 
of encountering 
explanations 
for new concepts 
which 
themselves 
use unfamiliar 
terminology. 
In this 
work, 
the 
reader 
is only 
a cross-reference 
(or a mouse click) away from the necessary background 
material. 
As to Sylvester’s 
second 
point, 
the very fact that 
the quantity 
of mathematics 
is so great means that 
any attempt 
to catalog 
it 
with 
any degree of completeness 
is doomed 
to failure. 
This 
certainly 
does not mean that 
it’s not worth 
trying. 
Strangely, 
except for relatively 
small works usually 
on particular 
subjects, 
there do not appear 
to 
have been any substantial 
attempts 
to collect and display 
in a place of prominence 
the treasure 
trove 
of 
mathematical 
results 
that have been discovered 
(invented?) 
over the years (one notable 
exception 
being 
Sloane and Plouffe’s 
Encyclopedia 
of Integer 
Sequences). 
This work, the product 
of the “gazing” 
of a single 
astronomer, 
attempts 
to fill that omission. 
Finally, 
a few words about 
logistics. 
Because of the alphabetical 
listing 
of entries 
in the encyclopedia, 
neither 
table of contents nor index are included. 
In many cases, a particular 
entry of interest 
can be located 
from a cross-reference 
(indicated 
in SMALL 
CAPS 
TYPEFACE 
in the 
text) 
in a related 
article. 
In 
addition, 
most articles are followed 
by a “see also” list of related 
entries for quick navigation. 
This can be particularly 
useful if yolv are looking 
for a specific entry 
(say, ‘LZeno’s Paradoxes”), 
but have forgotten 
the exact name. 
By examining 
the “see also” list at bottom 
of the entry for “Paradox,” 
you will likely recognize 
&no’s 
name 
and thus quickly locate the desired entry. 
The alphabetization 
of entries contains 
a few peculiarities 
which need mentioning. 
All entries beginning 
with a numeral 
are ordered 
by increasing 
value and appear 
before the first entry for “A.” 
In multiple-word 
entries containing 
a space or dash, the space or dash is treated 
as a character 
which precedes 
“a,” so entries 
appear 
in the following 
order: 
Yum,” 
“Sum P.. . ,” “Sum-P.. 
. ,” and “Summary.” 
One exception 
is that 
in a series of entries where a trailing 
“s” appears 
in some and not others, the trailing 
%” is ignored 
in the 
alphabetization. 
Therefore, 
entries involving 
Euclid 
would 
be alphabetized 
as follows: 
“Euclid’s 
Axioms,” 
“Euclid 
Number ,” ” Euclidean 
Algorithm.” 
Because of the non-standard 
nomenclature 
that 
ensues from 
naming mathematical 
results after their discoverers, 
an important 
result, such as the “Pythagorean 
Theorem” 
is written 
variously 
as “Pythagoras’s 
Theorem,” 
the “Pythagoras 
Theorem,” 
etc. In this encyclopedia, 
I have 
endeavored 
to use the most, widely 
accepted 
form. 
I have also tried to consistently 
give entry titles in the 
singular 
(e.g., “Knot” 
instead 
of “Knots”). 
In cases where the same word is applied 
in different 
contexts, 
the context 
is indicated 
in parentheses 
or 
appended 
to the end. Examples 
of the first type are “Crossing 
Number 
(Graph)” 
and “Crossing 
Number 
(Link).” 
Examples 
of the second type are “Convergent 
Sequence” 
and “Convergent 
Series.” 
In the case of 
an entry like “Euler 
Theorem,” 
which may describe one of three or four different 
formulas, 
I have taken the 
liberty 
of adding 
descriptive 
words (‘4Euler’s 
Something 
Theorem”) 
to all variations, 
or kept the standard 

name 
for the most 
commonly 
used variant 
and 
added 
descriptive 
words 
for the others. 
In cases where 
specific 
examples 
are derived 
from 
a general 
concept, 
em dashes 
(-) 
are used 
(for example, 
“Fourier 
Series,” 
“Fourier 
Series-Power 
Series,” 
“Fourier 
Series-Square 
Wave,” 
“ Fourier 
Series--Triangle”). 
The 
decision 
to put 
a 
possessive 
‘s at the 
end 
of a name 
or to use a lone 
trailing 
apostrophe 
is based 
on whether 
the 
final 
“s” 
is pronounced. 
‘LGauss’s 
Theorem” 
is therefore 
written 
out, 
whereas 
“Archimedes’ 
Recurrence 
Formula” 
is 
not. 
Finally, 
given 
the 
absence 
of a definitive 
stylistic 
convention, 
plurals 
of numerals 
are written 
without 
an apostrophe 
(e.g., 
1990s 
instead 
of 1990’s). 
In an endeavor 
of this 
magnitude, 
errors 
and 
typographical 
mistakes 
are inevitable. 
The 
blame 
for these 
lies with 
me alone. 
Although 
the current 
length 
makes 
extensive 
additions 
in a printed 
version 
problematic, 
I plan to continue 
updating, 
correcting, 
and 
improving 
the 
work,

Acknowledgments 
Although 
I alone have compiled 
and typeset 
this work, 
many 
people 
have contributed 
indirectly 
and 
directly 
to its creation. 
I have not yet had the good fortune 
to meet Donald 
Knuth 
of Stanford 
University, 
but he is unquestionably 
the person 
most directly 
responsible 
for making 
this work possible. 
Before 
his 
mathematical 
typesetting 
program 
TEX, it would have been impossible 
for a single individual 
to compile such 
a work as this. Had Prof. Bateman 
owned a personal 
computer 
equipped 
with T@, 
perhaps 
his shoe box of 
notes would not have had to await the labors of Erdelyi, 
Magnus, and Oberhettinger 
to become a three-volume 
work on mathematical 
functions. 
Andrew 
TTevorrow’s 
shareware 
implementation 
of QX 
for the Macintosh, 
OQjX 
(www . kagi . com/authors/akt/oztex. 
html), 
was also of fundamental 
importance. 
Nikos Drakos and 
Ross Moore 
have provided 
another 
building 
block for this work by developing 
the uTEX2HTML 
program 
(www-dsed.llnl.gov/files/programs/unix/latex2htm~/m~ual/m~ual

easily maintain 
and update 
an on-line 
version 
of the encyclopedia 
long before it existed in book form. 
I would like to thank 
Steven Finch of MathSoft, 
Inc., for his interesting 
on-line 
essays about 
mathemat- 
ical constants 
(www.mathsoft

and also for his kind permission 
to 
reproduce 
excerpts 
from some of these essays. I hope that Steven will someday publish 
his detailed 
essays 
in book form. 
Thanks 
also to Neil Sloane and Simon Plouffe 
for compiling 
and making 
available 
the printed 
and on-line 
(www l research.

versions 
of the Encyclopedia 
of Integer 
Sequences, 
an immensely 
valuable 
compilation 
of useful information 
which represents 
a truly 
mind-boggling 
investment 
of labor. 
Thanks 
to Robert

Sincere thanks 
to Judy

CRC Press, for 
his encouragement, 
and to Mimi 
Williams 
of CRC 
Press for her careful 
reading 
of the manuscript 
for 
typographical 
and formatting 
errors. 
As this encyclopedia’s 
entry on PROOFREADING 
MISTAKES shows, the 
number 
of mistakes 
that are expected 
to remain 
after three independent 
proofreadings 
is much lower than 
the original 
number, 
but unfortunately 
still nonzero. 
Many thanks to the library 
staff at the University 
of 
Virginia, 
who have provided 
invaluable 
assistance 
in tracking 
down many an obscure 
citation. 
Finally, 
I 
would like to thank the hundreds 
of people who took the time to e-mail me comments 
and suggestions 
while 
this work was in its formative 
stages. Your continued 
comments 
and feedback 
are very welcome.

The 
number 
one (1) is the first POSITIVE INTEGER. It 
is an ODD NUMBER. Although 
the number 
I used to be 
considered 
a PRIME NUMBER, it requires 
special 
treat- 
ment 
in so many 
definitions 
and applications 
involving 
primes 
greater 
than 
or equal to 2 that 
it is usually 
placed 
into 
a class of its own. The 
number 
1 is sometimes 
also 
called 
“unity,” 
so the nth 
roots of 1 are often called 
the 
nth RENTS OF UNITY. 
FRACTIONS having 
1 as a Nu- 
MERATOR are called 
UNIT FRACTIONS. Ifonly 
one root, 
solution, 
etc., exists 
to a given 
problem, 
the solution 
is 
called 
UNIQUE.

The

(2) is the second POSITIVE INTEGER 
and the first PRIME NUMBER. It is EVEN, and is the only 
EVEN PRIME (the PRIMES other 
than 
2 are called 
the

2 is also equal 
to its FAC-

15 Puzzle 
A puzzle 
introduced 
by Sam Loyd 
in 1878. It consists 
of 
15 squares 
numbered 
from 
1 to 15 which 
are placed 
in a 
4 x 4 box leaving 
one position 
out of the 16 empty. 
The 
goal is to rearrange 
the squares 
from 
a given 
arbitrary 
starting 
arrangement 
by sliding 
them 
one at a time 
into 
the configuration 
shown above. 
For some initial 
arrange- 
ments, 
this rearrangement 
is possible, 
but for others, 
it 
is not. 
To address 
the solubility 
of a given 
initial 
arrangement, 
proceed 
as follows. 
If the SQUARE 
containing 
the num- 
ber i appears 
“before” 
(reading 
the squares 
in the box 
from 
left to right 
and top to bottom) 
12 numbers 
which 
are less than 
i, then 
call it an inversion 
of order 
72, and 
denote 
it ~2i. Then 
define 
N$ 
15 
ni = lx 
ni, 
i=l 
I- 
z- 2 
where the sum 
need run only 
from 
2 to 15 rather 
than 
1 to 15 since there 
are no numbers 
less than 
1 (so n1 
must 
equal 
0). 
If Iv is EVEN, 
the position 
is possible, 
otherwise 
it is not. 
This 
can be formally 
proved 
using 
ALTERNATING GROUPS. For example, 
in the following 
arrangement 
n2 
= 1 (2 precedes 
1) and all other 
ni = 0, so N = 1 
and the puzzle 
cannot 
be solved.

A CONJECTURE due to J. Oesterlk

It states that,

holds, 
where p[abc indicates 
that 
the PRODUCT is Over

DIVIDE 
the PRODUCT abc. 
If this 
CONJECTURE were 
true, 
it 
would 
imply 
FERMAT'S 
LAST THEOREM for sufficiently 
large POWERS (Goldfeld 
1996). 
This 
is related 
to the fact that 
the abc conjecture 
implies 
that 
there are at least C In z WIEFERICH PRIMES 
< z for some constant 
C (Silverman 
1988, Vardi

Group 
N.B. 
A detailed 
on-line 
essay by S. Finch 
was the start- 
ing point for this entry. 
A GROUP for which the elements 
COMMUTE 
(i.e., A13 = 
BA for all elements 
A and B) is called 
an Abelian 
group. 
All CYCLIC GROUPS 
are Abelian, 
but an Abelian 
group 
is not necessarily 
CYCLIC. All SUBGROUPS of an Abelian 
group 
are NORMAL. In an Abelian 
group, 
each element 
is in a CONJUGACY 
CLASS by itself, 
and the CHARACTER 
TABLE involves 
POWERS 
of a single 
element 
known 
as a 
GENERATOR. 
No 
general 
formula 
is known 
for giving 
the 
number 
of nonisomorphic 
FINITE 
GROUPS 
of a given 
ORDER. 
However, 
the number 
of nonisomorphic 
Abelian 
FINITE 
GROUPS 
a(n) 
of any given 
ORDER 
n is given 
by writing 
n as 
n = 
(1) 
where the p; are distinct 
PRIME 
FACTORS, 
then 
a(n) = p(w), 
(2) 
i 
where P is the PARTITION FUNCTION. 
This 
gives 
1, 1, 
1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 3, 2, . 
l 
l (Sloane’s 
AOOOSSS) . The smallest 
orders 
for which n = 1, 2, 3, . . . nonisomorphic 
Abelian 
groups 
exist 
are 1, 4, 8, 36, 16, 72, 32, 900, 216, 
144, 
64, 1800, 
0, 288, 128, . . . (Sloane’s 
A046056), 
where 0 
denotes 
an impossible 
number 
(i.e., 
not 
a product 
of 
partition 
numbers) 
of nonisomorphic 
Abelian, 
groups. 
The 
“missing” 
values 
are 13, 17, 19, 23, 26, 29, 31, 34, 
37, 38, 39, 41, 43, 46, 
. . . (Sloane’s 
A046064). 
The 
incrementally 
largest 
numbers 
of Abelian 
groups 
as a 
function 
of order 
are 1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 15, 22, 30, 42, 56, 
77, 101, . . . (Sloane’s 
A046054), 
which 
occur for orders 
1, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 
l 
l 
l (Sloane’s 
A046055). 
The 
KRONECKER DECOMPOSITION 
THEOREM states 
that 
every FINITE 
Abelian 
group 
can be written 
as a DI- 
RECT PRODUCT 
of CYCLIC GROUPS of PRIME POWER 
ORDERS. Ifthe 
ORDERS ofa FINITE GROUP isa 
PRIME 
p, then 
there 
exists 
a single 
Abelian 
group 
of order 
p 
(denoted 
Zp) and 
no non-Abelian 
groups. 
If the 
OR- 
DERS is a prime 
squared 
p2, then 
there 
are two Abelian 
groups 
(denoted 
Zp2 and Zp @I Zp. 
If the ORDERS is 
a prime 
cubed 
p3, then 
there 
are three 
Abelian 
groups 
(denoted 
Zp @ Zp @ Zp, Zp @ Z*Z, 
and 
Zp3 ), and five 
groups 
total. 
If the order 
is a PRODUCT of two primes 
p and Q, then 
there 
exists exactly 
one Abelian 
group 
of 
order 
pq (denoted 
Zp @ Zp). 
Another 
interesting 
result 
is that 
if a(n) 
denotes 
the 
number 
of nonisomorphic 
Abelian 
groups 
of ORDER 
r~, 
n=l 
where c(s) 
is the RIEMANN 
ZETA

Theorem 
If one ROOT

f(x) 
= 0, which 
is irre-

over a FIELD K, 
is also a ROOT of the equation 
F(x)

then 
all the ROOTS 
of the irreducible 
equation 
f(x) 
= 0 are ROOTS of F(x)

F(x) 
can be divided 
by f(x) 
without 
a REMAINDER, 
F(x) = f(x)Fl(x>,

Ackermann 
Function 
The 
Ackermann 
function 
is the simplest 
example 
of a 
well-defined 
TOTAL FUNCTION which 
is COMPUTABLE 
but 
not PRIMITIVE RECURSIVE, providing 
a counterex- 
ample 
to the belief 
in the early 
1900s that 
every COM- 
PUTABLE FUNCTION 
was also PRIMITIVE 
RECURSIVE 
(D&e1 
1991). 
It grows faster than 
an exponential 
func- 
tion, 
or even a multiple 
exponential 
function.

Additive 
Persistence 
Consider 
the process of taking 
a number, 
adding 
its DIG- 
ITS, then 
adding 
the DIGITS 
of number 
derived 
from 
it, 
etc., 
until 
the remaining 
number 
has only 
one DIGIT. 
The 
number 
of additions 
required 
to obtain 
a single 
DIGIT 
from 
a number 
n is called 
the additive 
persis- 
tence of n, and the DIGIT 
obtained 
is called 
the DIGITAL 
ROOT 
of 7~. 
For example, 
the sequence 
obtained 
from 
the starting 
number 
9876 is (9876, 
30, 3), so 9876 has an additive 
persistence 
of 2 and 
a DIGITAL 
ROUT 
of 3. 
The 
ad- 
ditive 
persistences 
of the first few positive 
integers 
are 
0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 17 2, 1, 
77777733332222222222222222222 
There 
is a stronger 
conjecture 
that 
there 
is a maximum 
number 
lacking 
the DIGIT 
1 for each persistence 
2 2. 
The 
maximum 
additive 
persistence 
in base 2 is 1. It is 
conjectured 
that 
all powers of 2 > 215 contain 
a 0 in base 
3, which 
would 
imply 
that 
the maximum 
persistence 
in 
base 3 is 3 (Guy, 
1994).

Alexander’s 
Horned 
Sphere 
The 
above 
solid, 
composed 
of a countable 
UNION 
of 
COMPACT 
SETS, 
is called 
Alexander’s 
horned 
sphere. 
It is HOMEOMORPHIC 
with 
the BALL 
B3, and its bound- 
ary is therefore 
a SPHERE. 
It is therefore 
an example 
of 
a wild 
embedding 
in E3. 
The 
outer 
complement 
of the 
solid 
is not SIMPLY 
CONNECTED, 
and 
its 
fundamental 
GROUP 
is not 
finitely 
generated. 
Furthermore, 
the set 
of nonlocally 
flat 
(“bad”) 
points 
of Alexander’s 
horned 
sphere 
is a CANTOR 
SET. 
The 
complement 
in Iw3 of the 
bad 
points 
for 
Alexan- 
der’s 
horned 
sphere 
is SIMPLY 
CONNECTED, 
making 
it 
inequivalent 
to ANTOINE'S 
HORNED 
SPHERE. 
Alexan- 
der’s 
horned 
sphere 
has an uncountable 
infinity 
of WILD 
POINTS, 
which 
are 
the 
limits 
of the 
sequences 
of the 
horned 
sphere’s 
branch 
points 
(roughly, 
the 
“ends” 
of 
the 
horns), 
since 
any 
NEIGHBORHOOD 
of a limit 
con- 
tains 
a horned 
complex.

Alexander 
Polynomial 
A POLYNOMIAL 
invariant 
of a KNOT discovered 
in 1923 
by J. W. 
Alexander 
(Alexander 
1928). 
In technical 
lan- 
guage, 
the 
Alexander 
polynomial 
arises 
from 
the 
HO- 
MOLOGY of the infinitely 
cyclic 
cover 
of a KNOT'S com- 
plement 
Any 
generator 
of a PRINCIPAL ALEXANDER 
IDEAL is called 
an Alexander 
polynomial 
(Rolfsen 
1976)* 
Because 
the ALEXANDER INVARIANT of a TAME KNOT 
in s3 has 
a SQUARE presentation 
MATRIX, 
its ALEX- 
ANDER IDIZAL is PRINCIPAL and 
it has 
an Alexander 
polynomial 
denoted 
A(t). 
Let q be the MATRIX PRODUCT of BRAID WORDS of a 
KNOT, then 
det(I 
- Xl?) 
1+ 
t 
+ 
l 
l 
l 
+ 
P-l 
= 
AL, 
(1) 
where 
AL 
is the 
Alexander 
polynomial 
and 
det 
is the 
DETERMINANT. 
The 
Alexander 
polynomial 
of a TAME 
KNOT in s3 satisfies 
A(t) 
= det(VT 
- tV), 
(2) 
where 
V is a SEIFERT MATRIX, 
det 
is the DETERMI- 
NANT, and VT 
denotes 
the MATRIX 
TRANSPOSE. The 
Alexander 
polynomial 
also satisfies 
A(1) 
= *l. 
(3) 
The Alexander 
polynomial 
of a split table 
link 
is always 
0. Surprisingly, 
there 
are known 
examples 
of nontrivial 
KNOTS with 
Alexander 
polynomial 
1. 
An 
example 
is 
the 
(-3,5,7) 
PRETZEL KNOT. 
The 
Alexander 
polynomial 
remained 
the 
onEy known 
KNOT POLYNOMIAL until 
the JONES POLYNOMIAL was 
discovered 
in 1984. 
Unlike 
the 
Alexander 
polynomial, 
the 
more 
powerful 
JONES POLYNOMIAL does, 
in most 
cases, 
distinguish 
HANDEDNESS. A normalized 
form 
of 
the 
Alexander 
polynomial 
symmetric 
in t and 
t-l 
and 
satisfying 
A(unknot) 
= 1

was 
formulated 
by 3. H. Conway 
and 
is sometimes 
de- 
noted 
VL. 
The NOTATION [a + b + c + . . . is an abbrevi- 
ation 
for the Conway-normalized 
Alexander 
polynomial 
ofa 
KNOT 
a + b(x + x-l) 
+ c(x” + x-“) 
+ . . . .

For 
a description 
of the NOTATION for LINKS, 
see Rolf- 
sen (1976, 
p. 389). 
E xamples 
of the Conway-Alexander 
polynomials 
for common 
KNOTS include 
v~K=[l-l=-Z-l+l-x

for 
the TREFOIL KNOT, FIGURE-OF-EIGHT 
KNOT, and 
SOLOMON'S SEAL KNOT, 
respectively. 
Multiplying 
through 
to clear 
the NEGATIVE POWERS gives 
the usual 
Alexander

the 
final

mined

Let 
an Alexander

be denoted

(t) + (t-1'2

corresponding 
to the

used 
by Doll 
and Hoste 
(1991) 
is 
VL+ -VL-

These 
relations 
allow 
Alexander

to be con- 
structed

them

(Jones

at the JONES POLYNOMIAL) 
with

K which 
is algebraically

Algebraic 
Topology 
The 
study 
of intrinsic 
qualitative 
aspects 
of spatial 
objects 
(e.g., 
SURFACES, SPHERES, TORI, 
CIRCLES, 
KNOTS, LINKS, configuration 
spaces, 
etc.) 
that 
re- 
main 
invariant 
under 
both-directions 
continuous 
ONE- 
TO-ONE (HOMEOMORPHIC) 
transformations. 
The 
dis- 
cipline 
of algebraic 
topology 
is popularly 
known 
as 
'&RUBBER-SHEET GEOMETRY" and can also be viewed 
as the study 
of DISCONNECTIVITIES. 
Algebraic 
topology 
has a great deal of mathematical 
machinery 
for studying 
different 
kinds 
of HOLE structures, 
and it gets the prefix 
“algebraic” 
since many 
HOLE 
structures 
are represented 
best by algebraic 
objects 
like GROUPS and RINGS. 
A technical 
way of saying 
this 
is that 
algebraic 
topol- 
ogy is concerned 
with 
FUNCTORS from 
the topological 
CATEGORY of GROUPS and HOMOMORPHISMS. 
Here, 
the FUNCTORS are a kind 
of filter, 
and given an “input” 
SPACE, they 
spit 
out something 
else in return. 
The 
re- 
turned 
object 
(usually 
a GROUP or RING) is then a rep- 
resentation 
of the HOLE structure 
of the SPACE, in the 
sense that 
this 
algebraic 
object 
is a vestige 
of what 
the 
original 
SPACE was like 
(i.e., 
much 
information 
is lost, 
but 
some 
sort of “shadow” 
of the SPACE is retained- 
just enough 
of a shadow to understand 
some aspect of its 
HOL&structure, 
but 
no more). 
The 
idea is that 
FUNC- 
TORS give much 
simpler 
objects 
to deal with. 
Because 
SPACES by themselves 
are very 
complicated, 
they 
are 
unmanageable 
without 
looking 
at particular 
aspects.

Alhazen’s 
Billiard 
Problem 
In agiven 
CIRCLE, find an ISOSCELES TRIANGLE whose 
LEGS pass through 
two given 
POINTS 
inside 
the CIRCLE. 
This 
can be restated 
as: from two POINTS in the PLANE 
of a CIRCLE, draw LINES meeting 
at the POINT of the 
CIRCUMFERENCE and 
making 
equal 
ANGLES with 
the 
NORMAL at that POINT. 
The problem 
is called 
the billiard 
problem 
because it cor- 
responds 
to finding 
the POINT 
on the edge of a circular 
“BILLIARD" 
table 
at which 
a cue ball 
at a given 
POINT 
must 
be aimed 
in order to carom 
once off the edge of the 
table 
and strike 
another 
ball at a second given POINT. 
The solution 
leads to a BIQUADRATIC EQUATION of the 
form 
H(x2 
- y”) - 2Kxy 
+ (x2 + y2)(hy 
- kx) = 0. 
The 
problem 
is equivalent 
to the determination 
of the 
point 
on a spherical 
mirror 
where a ray of light 
will re- 
flect in order to pass from 
a given source to an observer. 
It is also equivalent 
to the problem 
of finding, 
given two 
points 
and a CIRCLE 
such that 
the points 
are both 
inside 
or outside 
the CIRCLE, the ELLIPSE 
whose FOCI are the 
two points 
and which 
is tangent 
to the given CIRCLE. 
The 
problem 
was first 
formulated 
by Ptolemy 
in 
150 
AD, 
and 
was named 
after 
the Arab 
scholar 
Alhazen, 
who discussed 
it in his work 
on optics. 
It was not until 
1997 that 
Neumann 
proved 
the problem 
to be insoluble 
using 
a COMPASS and RULER construction 
because 
the 
solution 
requires 
extraction 
of a CUBE 
ROOT. 
This 
is 
the same reason 
that 
the 
CUBE 
DUPLICATION 
problem 
is insoluble.

Aliasing 
Given 
a power spectrum 
(a plot 
of power vs. frequency), 
aliasing 
is a false translation 
of power falling 
in some fre- 
quency 
range 
(-fc, 
&) 
outside 
the range. 
Aliasing 
can 
be caused by discrete 
sampling 
below the NYQUIST 
FRE- 
QUENCY. The 
sidelobes 
of any INSTRUMENT 
FUNCTION 
(including 
the simple 
SINC SQUARED function 
obtained 
simply 
from 
FINITE 
sampling) 
are also a form 
of alias- 
ing. 
Although 
sidelobe 
contribution 
at large 
offsets can 
be minimized 
with 
the use of an APODIZATION 
FUNC- 
TION, 
the tradeoff 
is a widening 
of the response 
(i.e., 
a 
lowering 
of the resolution).

Amicable 
Pair 
An 
amicable 
pair 
consists 
of two INTEGERS 
m, n for 
which 
the sum of PROPER 
DIVISORS 
(the DIVISORS 
ex- 
cluding 
the 
number 
itself) 
of one number 
equals 
the 
other. 
Amicable 
pairs 
are occasionally 
called 
FRIENDLY 
PAIRS, 
although 
this nomenclature 
is to be discouraged 
since FRIENDLY 
PAIRS 
are defined 
by a different, 
if re- 
lated, 
criterion. 
Symbolically, 
amicable 
pairs 
satisfy 
where 
s(n) 
is 
equivalently, 
s(m) 
= n 
(1) 
s(n) = m, 
(2) 
the RESTRICTED 
DIVISOR 
FUNCTION 
or, 
a(m) 
= a(n) 
= s(m) 
+ s(n) 
= m -/- n, 
(3) 
where 
c(n) 
is the 
D~WSOR 
FUNCTION. 
The 
smallest 
amicable 
pair 
is (220, 284) which 
has factorizations 
220= 
11.5.22 
(4 
284 = 71

giving 
RESTRICTED 
DIVISOR 
FUNCTIONS 
s(220) 
= ~{1,2,4,5,10,11,20,22,44,55,110} 
= 284 
(6) 
~(284) 
= x(1,2,4,71,142} 
= 220. 
(7) 
The quantity 
44 
= o(n) 
= s(m) 
-I- s(n), 
(8) 
in this case, 220 + 284 = 504, is called 
the PAIR 
SUM. 
In 1636, 
Fermat 
found 
the pair 
(17296, 
18416) 
and in 
1638, 
Descartes 
found 
(9363584, 
9437056). 
By 
1747, 
Euler 
had found 
30 pairs, 
a number 
which 
he later 
ex- 
tended 
to 60. There 
were 390 known 
as of 1946 (Scott 
1946). 
There 
are a total 
of 236 amicable 
pairs 
below 
lo8 (Cohen 
1970), 
1427 below 
lOlo 
(te Ri-?l + 1 ‘cj), 3340 
less than 
1011 (Moews 
and MoewF

,I ’ .ess than 
2.01 x loll 
(Moews 
and 
Moe: 
A , : .d 5ir:cjl ress than 
=2: 3.06 x 1011 (Moews 
and Moews). 
The first few amicable 
pairs are (2. 0, 284), (1184, 
1210), 
(2620, 
2924) 
(5020, 
5564), 
<6232, 6368), 
(10744, 
10856), 
(12285, 
14595), 
(17296: 
C-I?6j, 
(63020, 
76084), 
. . . 
(Sloane’s 
A002025 
and A002046). 
AFT exhaustive 
tab- 
ulation 
is maintained 
by D. Moe*,,. 
Let 
an amicable 
pair 
be denoted 
h 4 with 
m < n. 
is called 
a regular 
amicable 
pair 
of type 
(i, j) if 
where 
g = GCD(m,n) 
is the 
GREATEST 
COMMON 
Dr- 
VISOR, 
GCD(g, 
111) = GCD(g, 
N) = 1, 
(10) 
iW and N are SQUAREFREE, 
then 
the number 
of PRIME 
factors 
of A& and N 
are i and j. 
Pairs 
which 
are not 
regular 
are called 
irregular 
or exotic 
(te Riele 
1986). 
There 
are no regular 
pairs 
of type 
(1, j) 
for j > 1. If 
- 
m = 0 (mod 
6) and 
n = a(m) 
-m 
(11) 
is EVEN, 
then 
(m,n) 
cannot 
be an amicable 
pair 
(Lee 
1969). 
The 
minimal 
and maximal 
values 
of m/n 
found 
by te Riele 
(1986) 
were 
938304290/1344480478 
= 0.697893577.. 
. 
(12) 
and 
4000783984/4001351168 
= 0.9998582519.. 
. . 
(13) 
te Riele 
(1986) 
also found 
37 pairs of amicable 
pairs hav- 
ing the same PAIR 
SUM. 
The 
first such pair is (609928, 
686072) 
and (643336, 
652664), 
which 
has the PAIR 
SUM 
a(m) 
= o(n) 
= m + n = 1,296,OOO. 
(14) 
te Riele 
(1986) 
found 
no amicable 
n-tuples 
having 
the 
same 
PAIR 
SUM 
for 
n 
> 
2. 
However, 
Moews 
and 
Moews 
found 
a triple 
in 
1993, 
and 
te Riele 
found 
a quadruple 
in 
1995. 
In 
November 
1997, 
a quin- 
tuple 
and 
sextuple 
were 
discovered. 
The 
sextuple 
is (1953433861918, 
2216492794082), 
(1968039941816, 
2201886714184), 
(1981957651366, 
2187969004634), 
(1993501042130, 
2176425613870), 
(2046897812505, 
2123028843495), 
(2068113162038, 
2101813493962), 
all 
having 
PAIR 
SUM 4169926656000. 
Amazingly, 
the sex- 
tuple 
is smaller 
than 
any known 
quadruple 
or quintuple, 
and is likely 
smaller 
than 
any quintuple. 
On October 
4, 1997, Mariano 
Garcia 
found 
the largest 
known 
amicable 
pair, 
each of whose members 
has 4829 
DIGITS. 
The new pair 
is 
Nl=CM[(P+Q)p89 
-13 
(15) 
Nz = CQ[(P 
- M)P8’ 
- 11, 
(16) 
where 
c = plpg

(20) 
P, Q1 (P + Q)pBg - 1, and (P-

Dickson

with 
two equal

Amphichiral 
Knot 
An amphichiral 
knot 
is a KNOT 
which 
is capable 
of be- 
ing continuously 
deformed 
into 
its own MIRROR 
IMAGE. 
The amphichiral 
knots 
having 
ten or fewer crossings 
are 
04001 
(FIGURE-OF-EIGHT 
KNOT), 
06003, 
08003, 
08009, 
08012,

10109, 
10115, 
10118, 
and 
10123 
(Jones 
1985). 
The 
HOMFLY 
POLYNOMIAL 
is good 
at 
identifying 
amphichiral 
knots, 
but 
sometimes 
fails 
to 
identify 
knots 
which 
are not. 
No complete 
invariant 
(an 
invariant 
which always definitively 
determines 
if a KNOT 
is AMPHICHIRAL) 
is known. 
Let 
b+ be the 
SUM of POSITIVE 
exponents, 
and b- the 
SUM of NEGATIVE 
exponents 
in the BRAID 
GROUP 
B,. 
If 
b+ - 3b- 
- n + 1 > 0, 
then 
the KNOT 
corresponding 
to the closed 
BRAID 
b is 
not amphichiral

bisection 
Given 
two 
intersecting 
LINES 
or LINE SEGMENTS, 
the 
amount 
of ROTATION 
about 
the 
point 
of intersection 
(the VERTEX) required 
to bring 
one into correspondence 
with 
the other 
is called 
the angle 
8 between 
them. 
An- 
gles are usually 
measured 
in DEGREES (denoted 
“), RA- 
DIANS 
(denoted 
rad, 
or without 
a unit), 
or sometimes 
GRADIANS 
(denoted 
grad). 
-\ \ \ \ 
The 
(interior) 
bisector 
of an ANGLE is the LINE or LINE 
SEGMENT which 
cuts 
it into 
two 
equal 
ANGLES on the 
same 
“side” 
as the ANGLE. 
One full rotation 
in these 
three 
measures 
corresponds 
to 
360”, 
2~ rad, 
or 400 grad. 
IIalf 
a full ROTATION 
is called 
a STRAIGHT ANGLE, and 
a QUARTER 
of a full rotation 
is called 
a RIGHT 
ANGLE. 
An 
angle 
less than 
a RIGHT 
ANGLE is called 
an ACUTE ANGLE, and an angle greater 
than 
a RIGHT ANGLE is called 
an OBTUSE 
ANGLE. 
The 
use of DEGREES to measure 
angles 
harks 
back 
to 
the 
Babylonians, 
whose 
SEXAGESIMAL number 
system 
was 
based 
on the number 
60. 360” 
likely 
arises 
from 
the 
Babylonian 
year, 
which 
was 
composed 
of 360 days 
(12 
months 
of 30 days 
each). 
The DEGREE is further 
divided 
into 
60 ARC 
MINUTES, 
and 
an ARC 
MINUTE 
into 
60 
ARC SECONDS. A more 
natural 
measure 
of an angle 
is 
the RADIAN. It has the property 
that 
the ARC LENGTH 
around 
a CIRCLE is simply 
given 
by the 
radian 
angle 
measure 
times 
the CIRCLE 
RADIUS. The RADIAN is also 
the most

angle measure

is an ANOSOV DIFFEOMORPHISM of the ~-TORUS, 
called 
an Anosov 
automorphism 
(or HYPERBOLIC AU- 
TOMORPHISM). Here, 
the term 
automorphism 
is used in 
the GROUP THEORY sense. 
Anosov 
Diffeomorphism 
An Anosov 
diffeomorphism 
is a C1 DIFFEOMORPHISM 4 
suchthatthe 
MANIFOLD ik! is HYPERBOLIC withrespect 
to 4. 
Very 
few 
classes 
of Anosov 
diffeomorphisms 
are 
known. 
The best 
known 
is ARNOLD'S CAT MAP.

DETERMI- 
NANT *l 
is an Anosov 
diffeomorphism 
of the ~-TORUS. 
Not 
every MANIFOLD admits 
an Anosov 
diffeomorphism. 
Anosov 
diffeomorphisms 
are EXPANSIVE, and there 
are 
no Anosov 
diffeomorphisms 
on the CIRCLE. 
It is conjectured 
that 
if 4 : M

M 
is an Anosov 
dif- 
feomorphism 
on a COMPACT RIEMANNIAN 
MANIFOLD 
and 
the NONWANDERING SET

of 6 is AI, 
then 
$ 
is TOPOLOGICALLY 
CONJUGATE 
to a FINITE-TO-ONE 
FACTOR 
of an ANOSOV AUTOMORPHISM of a NILMAN- 
IFOLD. It has been 
proved 
that 
any 
Anosov 
diffeomor- 
phismonthe 
~-TORUS is TOPOLOGICALLY CONJUGATE 
to an ANOSOV AUTOMORPHISM, and 
also that 
Anosov 
diffeomorphisms 
are C1 STRUCTURALLY STABLE.

An antimagic 
square 
is an n x n ARRAY 
of integers 
from 
1 to n2 such that 
each row, column, 
and main 
diago- 
nal produces 
a different 
sum such that 
these sums form 
a SEQUENCE 
of consecutive 
integers. 
It is therefore 
a 
special 
case of a HETEROSQUARE.

diagram, 
are said to be antiparallel 
to A1 and AZ. 
Antimagic 
squares 
of orders 
one and two are impossi-

and it is believed 
that 
there 
are also no antimagic

There 
are 18 families

Apollonius 
Circles 
There 
are two 
completely 
different 
definitions 
of the so- 
called 
Apollonius 
circles: 
1. The set of all points 
whose 
distances 
from 
two 
fixed 
points 
are in a constant 
ratio 
1 : p (Ogilvy 
1990). 
Ul(f + 3> = ; 
(17) 

Apollonius 
Point 
2. The 
eight 
CIRCLES 
(two 
of which 
are nondegener- 
ate) 
which 
solve 
APOLLONIUS’ 
PROBLEM for 
three 
CIRCLES. 
Given 
one 
side 
of a TRIANGLE 
and 
the 
ratio 
of the 
kngths 
of the 
other 
two 
sides, 
the LOCUS of the 
third 
VERTEX is the Apollonius 
circle 
(of the first 
type) 
whose 
CENTER is on the extension 
of the given 
side. 
For a given 
TRIANGLE, there 
are three 
circles 
of Apollonius. 
Denote 
the 
three 
Apollonius 
circles 
(of 
the 
first 
type) 
of a TRIANGLE by kl, 
k2, and k3, and their 
centers 
L1, 
Lz, and L3. 
The center 
L1 is the intersection 
of the side 
AaA3 
with 
the 
tangent 
to the CIRCUMCIRCLE 
at Al. 
L1 is also 
the pole 
of the SYMMEDIAN POINT K 
with 
respect 
to CIRCUMCIRCLE. 
The 
centers 
L1, L2, and L3 
are COLLINEAR on the POLAR of K 
with 
regard 
to its 
CIRCUMCIRCLE, called 
the LEMOINE LINE. The circle 
of 
Apollonius 
k1 is also the locus 
of a point 
whose 
PEDAL 
TRIANGLE is ISOSCELES such 
that 
PI Pz = PIPa. 
Let 
U and V be points 
on the 
side 
line BC 
of a TRI- 
ANGLE AABC 
met 
by the interior 
and exterior 
ANGLE 
BISECTORS of ANGLES A. 
The 
CIRCLE with 
DIAME- 
TER UV 
is called 
the 
A-Apollonian 
circle. 
Similarly, 
construct 
the 
B- 
and 
C-Apollonian 
circles. 
The 
Apol- 
lonian 
circles 
pass 
through 
the VERTICES A, B, and C, 
and 
through 
the 
two 
ISODYNAMIC PRINTS S and 
S’. 
The VERTICES of the D-TRIANGLE 
lie on the respective 
Apollonius 
circles.

Apollonius’ 
Problem 
Given 
three 
objects, 
each 
of which 
may 
be a POINT, 
LINE, or CIRCLE, draw 
a CIRCLE that 
is TANGENT to 
each. 
There 
are 
a total 
of ten 
cases. 
The 
two 
easi- 
est involve 
three 
points 
or three 
LINES, and the hardest 
involves 
three 
CIRCLES. 
Euclid 
solved 
the 
two 
easiest 
cases in his Elements, 
and the others 
(with 
the exception 
of the three 
CIRCLE problem), 
appeared 
in the 
Tangen- 
cies of Apollonius 
which 
was, 
however, 
lost. 
The general 
problem 
is, in principle, 
solvable 
by STRAIGHTEDGE and 
COMPASS alone.

Apollonius’ 
Problem 
Apollonius 
Pursuit 
Problem 
The 
three-CIRCLE 
problem 
was solved 
by Vikte 
(Boyer 
1968), 
and 
the solutions 
are called 
AP~LLONIUS 
CIR- 
CLES. 
There 
are eight 
total 
solutions. 
The 
simplest 
solution 
is obtained 
by solving 
the three 
simultaneous 
quadratic 
equations 
(x - Xl)” 
+ (Y 
( x - 
x2)2 
+ (y 
- y1)2 - (T Ik r1)2 = 0 
(1) 
- y2)2 - (r & r2)2 = 0 
(2) 
(x - x3)2 + (y - y3)2 - (r zt T3)2 = 0 
(3) 
in the three 
unknowns 
x, y, T for the eight 
triplets 
of 
signs (Courant 
and Robbins 
1996). 
Expanding 
the equa- 
tions 
gives 
(x2 +y2 -r2)-2X&-2 
yyi&Zrr; 
+(xi2 
+yi2 
-ri”) 
= 0 
(4) 
for i = 1, 2, 3. Since the first term 
is the same for each 
equation, 
taking 
(2) - (1) and (3) - (1) gives 
ax + by + CT = d 
(5) 
a’x + b’y -+- C’T = d’, 
(6) 
where 
a = 2(x1 
- x2) 
(7) 
b = 2(yl 
- 
~2) 
(8) 
c = F2(?3 
- 73) 
(9) 
d = (z22 +y22 
- 73’) 
- (xl2 
+ y12 - r12> 
(10) 
and similarly 
for a’, b’, c’ and d’ (where the 2 subscripts 
are replaced 
by 3s). Solving 
these two simultaneous 
lin- 
ear equations 
gives 
b’d - bd’ - b’cr 
+ bc’r 
x= 
ab’ - ba’ 
(11) 
-aId 
+ ad’ -+ ah 
- a& 
Y- 
ab’ - a/b 
7 
(12) 
which 
can then 
be plugged 
back 
into 
the 
QUADRATIC 
EQUATION 
(1) and solved 
using 
the 
QUADRATIC 
FOR- 
MULA. 
Perhaps 
the most 
elegant 
solution 
is due to Gergonne. 
It proceeds 
by locating 
the six HOMOTHETIC 
CENTERS 
(three 
internal 
and 
three 
external) 
of the 
three 
given 
CIRCLES. 
These 
lie three 
by three 
on four lines 
(illus- 
trated 
above), 
Determine 
the 
POLES 
of one of these 
with 
respect 
to each of the three 
CIRCLES 
and connect 
the POLES 
with 
the RADICAL 
CENTER 
of the CIRCLES. 
If the connectors 
meet, 
then 
the three 
pairs 
of intersec- 
tions 
are the points 
of tangency 
of two of the eight 
circles 
(Johnson 
1929, Dijrrie 
1965). 
To determine 
which 
two 
of the eight 
Apollonius 
circles 
are produced 
by the three 
pairs, 
simply 
take 
the two which 
intersect 
the original 
three 
CIRCLES 
only 
in a single 
point 
of tangency. 
The 
procedure, 
when repeated, 
gives the other 
three 
pairs of 
CIRCLES. 
If the three 
CIRCLES 
are mutually 
tangent, 
then 
the 
eight 
solutions 
collapse 
to two, 
known 
as the 
SODDY 
CIRCLES.

1. Call 
the radii 
of the left 
and right 
SEMICIRCLES 
a 
and 
b, respectively, 
with 
a + b z R. 
Then 
the arc 
length 
along 
the bottom 
of the arbelos 
is 
L = 27~ -+- 2nb = 2-/r(a -I- b) = 2zR, 
so the arc lengths

2. Draw 
the PERPENDICULAR 
BD 
from 
the tangent 
of 
the two SEMICIRCLES 
to the edge of the large 
CIR- 
CLE, 
Then 
the 
AREA 
of the arbelos 
is the same as 
the AREA 
ofthe 
CIRCLE 
with 
DIAMETER 
BD. 
3. The 
CIRCLES 
Cl 
and 
Cz inscribed 
on each half 
of 
BD 
on the arbelos 
(called 
ARCHIMEDES’ 
CIRCLES) 
each 
have 
DIAMETER 
(AB)(BC)/(AC). 
Further- 
more, 
the smallest 
CIRCUMCIRCLE 
of these two cir- 
cles has an area equal 
to that 
of the arbelos. 
4. The line tangent 
to the semicircles 
AB 
and BC 
con- 
tains 
the point 
E and F which 
lie on the lines 
AD 
and CD, 
respectively. 
Furthermore, 
BD 
and EF 
bi- 
sect each other, 
and the points 
B, D, E, and F are 
CONCYCLIC.

to the ARCHIMEDES' 
CIRCLES 
C1 and Cz 
in the arbelos 
figure, 
there 
is a third 
circle 
C3 called 
the 
B ANKoFF 
CIRCLE 
which

to these 
two.

a chain 
of TANGENT 
CIRCLES 
starting 
with 
the 
CIRCLE 
TANGENT 
to the

ones 
and 
large

The 
centers 
of the 
CIRCLES 
lie on

an 
ELLIPSE, 
and 
the 
DIAMETER 
of the 
nth 
CIR- 
CLE Cn is (l/n)th 
PERPENDICULAR 
distance 
to the 
base of the 
SEMICIRCLE. 
This 
result 
is most 
eas- 
ily proven 
using 
INVERSION, 
but was known 
to Pap- 
pus, who referred 
to it as an ancient 
theorem 
(Hood 
1961, Cadwell 
1966, Gardner 
1979, Bankoff 
1981). 
If 
T = AB/AC, 
then the radius 
of the nth 
circle 
in the 
PAwus 
CHAIN 
is 
Tn = 
(1 - r)r 
2[?22(1 - r)2 + r]. 
This 
general 
result 
simplifies 
to TV = l/(6 
+ n2) for 
T = 2/3 (Gardner 
1979). 
Further 
special 
cases when 
AC = I+ 
AB 
are considered 
by Gaba 
(1940). 
If B divides 
AC in the 
GOLDEN 
RATIO 
4, then 
the 
circles 
in the chain 
satisfy 
a number 
of other 
special 
properties 
(Bankoff 
1955).

Archimedes 
Algorithm 
Successive 
application 
of ARCHIMEDES' RECURRENCE 
FORMULA gives 
the 
Archimedes 
algorithm, 
which 
can 
be used to provide 
successive 
approximations 
to K (PI). 
The algorithm 
is also called 
the BORCHARDT-PFAFF AL- 
GORITHM. 
Archimedes 
obtained 
the first 
rigorous 
ap- 
proximation 
of r by CIRCUMSCRIBING and INSCRIBING 
n = 6 
l 2”-gons 
on a CIRCLE. From 
ARCHIMEDES' RE- 
CURRENCE FORMULA, the CIRCUMFERENCES aandbof 
the circumscribed 
and inscribed 
POLYGONS are 
b(n) 
= 2nsin 
E 
, 
(

where 
b(n) 
< C = 27~ =

where arc = ~(6-2”). 
The first iteration 
of ARCHIMEDES' 
RECURRENCE FORMULA then 
gives

A unit 
of ANGULAR measure 
equal 
to 60 ARC SECONDS,

Archimedes’ 
Cattle

Also 
called 
the BOVINUM PROBLEMA. 
It is stated 
as 
follows 
: “The 
sun god had a herd 
of cattle 
consisting 
of 
bulls 
and 
cows, 
one part 
of which 
was 
white, 
a second 
black, 
a third 
spotted, 
and a fourth 
brown. 
Among 
the 
bulls, 
the 
number 
of white 
ones 
was 
one half 
plus 
one 
third 
the number 
of the black 
greater 
than 
the brown; 
the number 
of the black, 
one quarter 
plus 
one fifth 
the 
number 
of the spotted 
greater 
than 
the brown; 
the num- 
ber of the spotted, 
one sixth 
and one seventh 
the number 
of the white 
greater 
than 
the brown. 
Among 
the cows, 
the number 
of white 
ones was 
one third 
plus 
one quarter 
of the 
total 
black 
cattle; 
the 
number

Lemma 
Also 
known 
as the continuity 
axiom, 
this LEMMA SW- 
vives in the writings 
of Eudoxus 
(Boyer 
1968). 
It states 
that, 
given 
two magnitudes 
having 
a ratio, 
one can find 
a multiple 
of either 
which 
will 
exceed 
the other. 
This 
principle 
was the basis 
for the EXHAUSTION METHOD 
which 
Archimedes 
invented 
to solve problems 
of AREA 
and VOLUME.

Archimedean 
Solid 
The 
Archimedean 
solids 
are convex POLYHEDRA which 
have 
a similar 
arrangement 
of nonintersecting 
regu- 
lar 
plane 
CONVEX POLYGONS of two or more 
differ- 
ent types 
about 
each VERTEX 
with 
all sides the same 
length. 
The 
Archimedean 
solids 
are distinguished 
from 
the 
PRISMS, 
ANTIPRISMS, and 
ELONGATED 
SQUARE 
GYROBICUPOLA by their 
symmetry 
group: 
the 
Arch- 
imedean 
solids 
have 
a spherical 
symmetry, 
while 
the 
others 
have 
“dihedral” 
symmetry. 
The 
Archimedean 
solids 
are sometimes 
also referred 
to as the 
SEMIREG- 
ULAR 
POLYHEDRA. 
Pugh 
(1976, 
p. 25) points 
out 
the Archimedean 
solids 
are all capable 
of being 
circumscribed 
by a regular 
TET- 
RAHEDRON so that 
four 
of their 
faces lie on the faces 
of that 
TETRAHEDRON. 
A method 
of constructing 
the 
Archimedean 
solids 
using 
a method 
known 
as “expan- 
sion” 
has been 
enumerated 
by Stott 
(Stott 
1910; 
Ball 
and Coxeter 
1987, ppm 139-140). 
Let the cyclic 
sequence 
S = (~1, ~2, . . . , pp) 
represent 
the 
degrees of the faces surrounding 
a vertex 
(i.e., 
S is a list 
of the number 
of sides of all polygons 
surrounding 
any 
vertex). 
Then 
the definition 
of an Archimedean 
solid 
requires 
that 
the sequence 
must 
be the same 
for each 
vertex 
to within 
ROTATION and REFLECTION. 
Walsh 
(1972) 
demonstrates 
that 
S represents 
the degrees of the 
faces surrounding 
each vertex 
of a semiregular 
convex 
polyhedron 
or TESSELLATION of the plane 
IFF

of S is at least

Solid 
6 5 
3. for every ODD NUMBER p E S, S contains 
a subse- 
quence 
(b, p, b). 
Condition 
(1) simply 
says that 
the figure 
consists 
of two 
or more polygons, 
each having 
at least three 
sides. Con- 
dition 
(2) requires 
that 
the sum 
of interior 
angles 
at a 
vertex 
must 
be equal 
to a full rotation 
for the figure 
to 
lie in the plane, 
and less than 
a full rotation 
for a solid 
figure 
to be convex. 
The 
usual 
way of enumerating 
the semiregular 
polyhe- 
dra is to eliminate 
solutions 
of conditions 
(1) and 
(2) 
using 
several 
classes of arguments 
and then 
prove 
that 
the solutions 
left are, in fact, semiregular 
(Kepler 
1864, 
pp. 
116-126; 
Catalan 
1865,

Archimedes’ 
Spiral 
An ARCHIMEDEAN SPIRAL with POLAR equation 
T = a@. 
This 
spiral 
was studied 
by Conon, 
and later 
by Archi- 
medes in On SpiraEs about 
225 BC. Archimedes 
was able 
to work out the lengths 
of various 
tangents 
to the spiral. 
Archimedes’ 
spiral 
can 
be 
used 
for 
COMPASS and 
STRAIGHTEDGE division 
of an ANGLE 
into 
n parts 
(in- 
cluding 
ANGLE TRISECTION) 
and can also be used for 
CIRCLE SQUARING. In addition, 
the curve 
can be used 
as a cam 
to convert 
uniform 
circular 
motion 
into 
uni- 
form linear 
motion. 
The 
cam consists 
of one arch of the 
spiral 
above 
the X-AXIS 
together 
with 
its reflection 
in 
the X-AXIS. 
Rotating 
this 
with 
uniform 
angular 
veloc- 
ity about 
its center 
will result 
in uniform 
linear 
motion 
of the point 
where it crosses the ~-AXIS.

The

is very 
useful 
in computing 
the 
values 
of 
complete 
ELLIPTIC 
INTEGRALS and 
can also be used 
for finding 
the INVERSE TANGENT. 
The 
special 
value

is called 
GAUSS'S CONSTANT.

When 
p = 2 or p = 3, there 
is a modular 
transformation 
for the solutions 
of (15) that 
are bounded 
as x -+ 0. Let- 
ting 
J,(x) 
be one of these solutions, 
the transformation 
takes the form

The 
case p = 2 gives 
the ARITHMETIC-GEOMETRIC 
MEAN, and 13 = 3 gives a cubic 
relative

Arithmetic 
Mean 
For a CONTINUOUS DISTRIBUTION 
function, 
the arith- 
metic 
mean 
of the 
population, 
denoted 
p, Z, (x), 
or 
A(x), 
is given by 
CL = 
Lfw 
= 
Ia 
P(x)f(x)dx, 
--oo 
where (x) is the EXPECTATION VALUE. For a DISCRETE 
DISTRIBUTION, 
CL = (f(x)) = c SO P(Xn)f Cxn> 
z,“=, p( 
Xn ) 
n=O 
(2) 
The 
population 
mean 
satisfies 
(f (4 + s(4) = (f (4) + Mx>> 
(3) 
(cf b>> = c (f (x>> ? 
(4) 
and 
(f (WY)) 
= (f (4) MY)) 
(5) 
if x and y are INDEPENDENT STATISTICS. The 
“sample 
mean, ” which 
is the mean 
estimated 
from 
a statistical 
sample, 
is an UNBIASED ESTIMATOR for the population 
mean. 
For small 
samples, 
the mean 
is more 
efficient 
than 
the 
MEDIAN and approximately 
7r/2 less (Kenney 
and Keep- 
ing 1962, p. 211). 
A general 
expression 
which often holds 
approximately 
is 
mean - mode 
=2: 3(mean 
- median). 
Given 
a set of samples 
{xi}, 
the arithmetic 
mean

However,

An arithmetic

k =

“, 
in which 
each term 
is computed 
from 
the previous 
one by adding 
(or subtracting) 
a constant. 
Therefore, 
for k > 1, 
ak 
=ak-l+d=ak-2+2d=...=al+d(k-1).

The 
sum 
of the

Using 
the SUM identity

then 
gives 
Sn = nal

Note, 
however, 
that

Gauss

to solve 
the problem 
of summing

from

given as busy-work 
by his teacher. 
While 
his classmates 
toiled

Gauss wrote 
a single 
number, 
the correct 
answer 
$00)(1+ 
100) = 50 ’ 101 = 5050

on his slate. 
When 
the answers were examined, 
Gauss’s

to be the only 
correct 
one.

Arrangement 
In general, 
an arrangement 
of objects 
is simply 
a group- 
ing of them. 
The 
number 
of “arrangements” 
of n, items 
is given 
either 
by a COMBINATION 
(order 
is ignored) 
or 
PERMUTATION 
(order 
is significant) 
l 
The 
division 
of SPACE into 
cells by a collection 
of HY- 
PERPLANES 
is also called 
an arrangement.

Array 
An 
array 
is a “list 
of lists” 
with 
the 
length 
of each 
level 
of list 
the same. 
The 
size (sometimes 
called 
the 
“shape”) 
of a d-dimensional 
array 
is then 
indicated 
as 
m X n X 
l *v X p. 
The 
most 
common 
type 
of array 
en- 
\ 
d 
Y 
d 
countered 
is the 2-D m x n rectangular 
array 
having 
m 
columns 
and n, rows. 
If ~2 = n, a square 
array 
results. 
Sometimes, 
the order 
of the elements 
in an array is sig- 
nificant 
(as in a MATRIX), 
whereas at other 
times, 
arrays 
which 
are equivalent 
modulo 
reflections 
(and rotations, 
in the case of a square 
array) 
are considered 
identical 
(as in a MAGIC 
SQUARE 
or PRIME 
ARRAY). 
In order 
to exhaustively 
list the number 
of distinct 
ar- 
rays of a given 
shape 
with 
each element 
being 
one of Fz 
possible 
choices, 
the naive 
algorithm 
of running 
through 
each case and checking 
to see whether 
it’s equivalent 
to 
an earlier 
one is already 
just 
about 
as efficient 
as can 
be. 
The 
running 
time 
must 
be at least 
the number 
of 
answers, and this is so close to krnn*‘** 
that 
the difference 
isn’t 
significant. 
’ 
However, 
finding 
the number 
of possible 
arrays of a given 
shape 
is much 
easier, 
and an exact 
formula 
can be ob- 
tained 
using 
the POLYA 
ENUMERATION 
THEOREM. 
For 
the simple 
case of an m, x n array, 
even this proves un- 
necessary 
since there 
are only 
a few possible 
symmetry 
types, 
allowing 
the possibilities 
to be counted 
explicitly. 
For example, 
consider 
the case of VL and n EVEN 
and 
distinct, 
so only reflections 
need be included. 
To take a 
specific 
case, let m = 6 and n = 4 so the array looks like 
a

where each a, b, . . . , ~1: can take a value 
from 
1 to k. The 
total 
number 
of possible 
arrangements 
is kz4 
(km, 
in 
general). 
The number 
of arrangements 
which are equiv- 
alent 
to their 
left-right 
mirror 
images 
is P2 
(in general, 
k 
mn/2 
), as is the number 
equal 
to their 
up-down 
mirror 
images, 
or their 
rotations 
through 
180”. 
There 
are also 
k” arrangements 
(in general, 
kmn/4) 
with full symmetry. 
In general, 
it is therefore 
true 
that

Artis tic Series 
If n # -1

SQUARE, 
then 
Artin 
conjectured 
that 
the SET S(n) 
of all PRIMES 
for which 
n 
is a PRIMITIVE 
ROOT 
is infinite. 
Under 
the assumption 
of the EXTENDED RIEMANN HYPOTHESIS; Artin’s 
con- 
jecture 
was solved 
in 1967 by C. Hooley. 
If, in addition,

Artin’s 
Conjecture 
There 
are at least two statements 
which 
go by the name 
of Artin’s 
conjecture. 
The 
first 
is the 
RIEMANN 
HY- 
POTHESIS. 
The 
second 
states 
that 
every INTEGER not 
equal 
to -1 
or a SQUARE 
NUMBER 
is a primitive 
root 
modulo 
p for infinitely 
many 
p and proposes 
a density 
for the 
set of such p which 
are always 
rational 
multi- 
ples of a constant 
known 
as ARTIN'S 
CONSTANT. 
There 
is an analogous 
theorem 
for functions 
instead 
of num- 
bers which 
has been proved 
by Billharz 
(Shanks 
1993, 
p* 147).

The EV~LUTE of an ELLIPSE is a stretched 
HYPOCY- 
CLOID. The 
gradient 
of the TANGENT 
T from 
the point 
with 
parameter 
p is - tanp. 
The 
equation 
of this TAN- 
GENTS is 
A 
4-cusped 
HYPOCYCLOID 
which 
is sometimes 
also 
called 
a TETRACUSPID, CUBOCYCLOID, 0r 
PARACY CLE. 
The parametric 
equations 
of the astroid 
can be obtained 
by plugging 
in n = a/b = 4 or 4/3 into the equations 
for 
a general 
HYPOCYCLOID, giving 
II: sinp 
+ y cosp = &zsin(2p) 
(14) 
(MacTutor 
Archive). 
Let T cut the X-AXIS and the y- 
AXIS at X and Y, respectively. 
Then 
the length 
XY 
is 
a constant 
and is equal 
to a. 
x = 3bcos++

In PEDAL COORDINATES with 
the PEDAL POINT at the

the equation 
is 
T2 +3p2 
= u2. 
The 
astroid 
can also be formed 
as the ENVELOPE pro- 
duced 
when 
a LINE SEGMENT is moved 
with 
each end 
on one of a pair 
of PERPENDICULAR axes (e.g., it is the 
curve enveloped 
by a ladder 
sliding 
against 
a wall or a 
garage 
door 
with 
the top 
corner 
moving 
along 
a verti- 
cal track;

The 
astroid 
is therefore

The ARC LENGTH$URVATURE, 
and TANGENTIAL AN-

To see this, 
note 
that 
for a ladder 
of 
length 
L, the points 
of contact 
with 
the wall and floor 
are (x0,0) 
and (O,dw), 
respectively. 
The equa- 
tion 
of the LINE made 
by the 
ladder 
with 
its foot 
at

is therefore

Since (5) comes from 
an integral

it must

An attractor 
is defined 
as the smallest 
unit 
which 
cannot 
be itself 
decomposed 
into 
two or more 
attractors 
with 
distinct 
BASINS OF ATTRACTION. 
This 
restriction 
is necessary 
since a DYNAMICAL SYSTEM may have mul- 
tiple 
attractors, 
each with 
its own BASIN OF ATTRAC- 
TION. 
Conservative 
systems 
do not have attractors, 
since the 
motion 
is periodic. 
For dissipative 
DYNAMICAL SYS- 
TEMS, however, 
volumes 
shrink 
exponentially 
so attrac- 
tors have 0 volume 
in n-D 
phase space. 
A stable 
FIXED POINT surrounded 
by a dissipative 
re- 
gion is an attractor 
known 
as a SINK. Regular 
attractors 
(corresponding 
to 0 LYAPUNOV CHARACTERISTIC 
Ex- 
PONENTS) act as LIMIT 
CYCLES, in which 
trajectories 
circle 
around 
a limiting 
trajectory 
which 
they 
asymp- 
totically 
approach, 
but never reach. 
STRANGE ATTRAC- 
TORS are bounded 
regions 
of PHASE SPACE (correspond- 
ing 
to POSITIVE LYAPUNOV CHARACTERISTIC 
EXPO- 
NENTS) 
having 
zero MEASURE in the embedding 
PHASE 
SPACE and a FRACTAL DIMENSION. Trajectories 
within 
a STRANGE ATTRACTOR 
appear 
to skip 
around 
ran- 
domly.

Auction 
A type 
of sale in which 
members 
of a group 
of buyers 
offer ever increasing 
amounts. 
The 
bidder 
making 
the 
last bid 
(for which 
no higher 
bid is subsequently 
made 
within 
a specified 
time 
limit: 
“going 
once, going 
twice, 
sold”) 
must 
then 
purchase 
the item 
in question 
at this 
price. 
Variants 
of simple 
bidding 
are also possible, 
as in 
a VICKERY AUCTION.

Augend 
The 
first 
of several 
ADDENDS, or 
“the 
one to which 
the others 
are added,” 
is sometimes 
called 
the augend. 
Therefore, 
while 
a, b, and c are ADDENDS in a + b + c, 
a is the augend.

The autocorrelation

not reversible. 
There

between 
the

the

Automorphic 
Number 
A number 
IC such that 
nk2 has its last 
digits 
equal 
to 
k is called 
n-automorphic. 
For example, 
1 
l 52 = 
25 - 
and 
1 m S2 = 
36 are 1-automorphic 
and 
2 . 8 2 = 
12s 
and 2 
l 882 = 15488 
are 2-automorphic. 
de Guerre 
and 
Fairbairn

of automorphic 
numbers. 
The 
first 
few l-automorphic 
numbers 
are 1, 5, 6, 25,

There 
are two 1-automorphic 
numbers 
with a given number 
of digits, 
one ending 
in 5 and one in 
6 (except 
that 
the l-digit 
automorphic 
numbers 
include 
I), and each of these contains 
the previous 
number 
with 
a digit 
prepended. 
Using 
this fact, it is possible 
to con- 
struct 
automorphic 
numbers 
having 
more 
than 
25,000 
digits 
(Madachy 
1979).

Autonomous 
A differential 
equation 
or system 
of ORDINARY 
DIFFER- 
ENTIAL 
EQUATIONS 
is said to be autonomous 
if it does 
not 
explicitly 
contain 
the 
independent 
variable 
(usu- 
ally 
denoted 
t). 
A second-order 
autonomous 
differen- 
tial 
equation 
is of the 
form 
F(y, &I/‘) 
= 
0, where 
y’ = dy/dt 
= v 
-

By the 
CHAIN 
RULE, 
y” can be ex- 
pressed 
as 
dv

--- 
y” 
= v’ = dt 
= dy dt 
- 
-&v. 
For an autonomous 
ODE, 
the solution 
is independent 
of 
the time 
at which the initial 
conditions 
are applied. 
This 
means 
that 
all particles 
pass through 
a given 
point 
in 
phase 
space. 
A nonautonomous 
system 
of n first-order 
ODES 
can be written 
as an autonomous 
system 
of n + 1 
ODES 
by letting 
t E x n+l 
and increasing 
the dimension 
of the system 
by 1 by adding 
the equation 
dx n+l

=l.

Axiom 
A PROPOSITION regarded 
as self-evidently 
TRUE with- 
out PROOF. The word “axiom” 
is a slightly 
archaic 
syn- 
onym 
for POSTULATE. Compare 
CONJECTURE or HY- 
POTHESIS, both 
of which 
connote 
apparently 
TRUE but 
not self-evident 
statements.

Axiom 
A Diffeomorphism 
Let 4: M + M 
be a C1 DIFFEOMORPHISM on acom- 
pact RIEMANNIAN MANIFOLD M. 
Then 
4 satisfies 
AX- 
iom 
A if the NONWANDERING set a(4) 
of $ is hyperbolic 
and the PERIODIC POINTS of q5 are DENSE 
in O(4). 
Al- 
though 
it was conjectured 
that 
the first of these condi- 
tions implies 
the second, 
they were shown to be indepen- 
dent in or around 
1977. 
Examples 
include 
the ANOSQV 
DIFFEOMORPHISMS and SMALE HORSESHOE MAP. 
In some cases, Axiom 
A can be replaced 
by the condi- 
tion 
that 
the DIFFEOMORPHISM is a hyperbolic 
diffeo- 
morphism 
on a hyperbolic 
set (Bowen 
1975, Parry 
and 
Pollicott 
1990).

Axiom 
of Choice 
An important 
and fundamental 
result 
in SET THEORY 
sometimes 
called 
ZERMELO’S 
AXIOM 
OF CHOICE. 
It was 
formulated 
by Zermelo 
in 1904 and states that, 
given any 
SET of mutually 
exclusive 
nonempty 
SETS, there 
exists 
at least 
one 
SET that 
contains 
exactly 
one element 
in 
common 
with 
each of the nonempty 
SETS. 
It is related 
to HILBERT'S 
PROBLEM 
lo, and was proved 
to be consistent 
with 
other 
AXIOMS 
in SET THEORY 
in 
1940 by Gijdel. 
In 1963, 
Cohen 
demonstrated 
that 
the 
axiom 
of choice 
is independent 
of the other 
AXIOMS 
in 
Cantorian 
SET THEORY, 
so the AXIOM 
cannot 
be proved 
within 
the system 
(Boyer 
and Merzbacher 
1991, p. 610).

Define

The

Then 
the curve defined

(5) 
is a B-spline. 
Specific 
types 
include 
the nonperiodic 
B- 
spline 
(first 
p + 1 knots 
equal 
0 and last p + 1 equal 
to 
1) and uniform 
B-spline 
(INTERNAL 
KNOTS 
are equally 
spaced). 
A B-Spline 
with 
no 
INTERNAL 
KNOTS 
is a 
BI&IER 
CURVE. 
The degree of a B-spline 
is independent 
of the number 
of 
control 
points, 
so a low order 
can always be maintained 
for purposes 
of numerical 
stability. 
Also, a curve is p - k 
times 
differentiable 
at a point 
where 
?C duplicate 
knot 
values 
occur. 
The 
knot 
values 
determine 
the extent 
of 
the control 
of the control 
points. 
A nonperiodic 
B-spline 
is a B-spline 
whose first 
p + 
1 
knots 
are equal 
to 0 and 
last p + 1 knots 
are equal 
to 
1. 
A uniform

are equally

disentangling 
a set of rings 
from 
a 
looped

(also 
called 
CHINESE

for n rings 
is 
1 
- 
s 
(2 n+l 
- 2) 
n even 
3 (2 n+l

n odd. 
BY simultaneously 
moving 
the two end rings, 
the num- 
ber of moves 
can be reduced 
to 
ZnB1 - 1 
n even

Ballot 
Problem 
Suppose 
A and B are candidates 
for office and there 
are 
2n voters, 
n voting 
for A and n for B. 
In how many 
ways 
can the ballots 
be counted 
so that 
A is always ahead 
of 
or tied 
with 
B? 
The 
solution 
is a CATALAN 
NUMBER 
c 72. 
A related 
problem 
also called 
“the” 
ballot 
problem 
is to 
let A receive 
a votes and B b votes with 
a > b. This 
ver- 
sion of the ballot 
problem 
then 
asks for the probability 
that 
A stays ahead 
of B as the votes are counted 
(Vardi 
1991). 
The 
solution 
is (a - b)/(a 
+ b), as first 
shown 
by M. 
Bertrand 
(Bilton 
and 
Pedersen 
1991). 
Another 
elegant 
solution 
was provided 
by And& 
(1887) 
using the 
so-called 
ANDRI?S 
REFLECTION 
METHOD. 
The 
problem 
can also be generalized 
(Hilton 
and Ped- 
ersen 1991). 
Furthermore, 
the TAK 
FUNCTION 
is con- 
nected 
with 
the ballot 
problem 
(Vardi 
1991).

Paradox 
First 
stated 
in 1924, this theorem 
demonstrates 
that 
it 
is possible 
to dissect 
a BALL 
into 
six pieces 
which 
can 
be reassembled 
by rigid 
motions 
to form 
two balls 
of 
the same size as the original. 
The 
number 
of pieces was 
subsequently 
reduced 
to five. 
IIowever, 
the pieces 
are 
extremely 
complicated. 
A generalization 
of this 
theo- 
rem 
is that 
any two bodies 
in Iw3 which 
do not extend 
to infinity 
and each containing 
a ball 
of arbitrary 
size 
can be dissected 
into 
each other 
(they 
are are EQUIDE- 
COMPOSABLE).

Some

Examples

monetary 
system 
(in which ha’pennies, 
pennies, 
threepence, 
sixpence, 
shillings,

and 
guineas 
corresponded 
to units 
of l/Z, 
1, 3, 6, 12, 30, 240, 
and 252, respectively). 
Knuth 
has considered 
using 
TRANSCENDENTAL 
bases. 
This 
leads 
to some 
rather 
unfamiliar 
results, 
such as 
equating 
7r to 1 in “base n,” 
n = 1,.

The 
numbers 
3 and 4 appear 
prominently 
in the game 
of baseball. 
There 
are 3 l 3 = 9 innings 
in a game, 
and 
three 
strikes 
are an out. 
However, 
4 balls are needed 
for 
a walk. 
The 
number 
of bases can either 
be regarded 
as 
3 (excluding 
HOME PLATE) or 4 (including 
it). 
see BASEBALL COVER,HOME PLATE 
Baseball 
Cover 
Basis 
A pair 
of identical 
plane 
regions 
(mirror 
symmetric 
about 
two perpendicular 
lines through 
the center) 
which 
can be stitched 
together 
to form 
a baseball 
(or tennis 
ball). 
A baseball 
has a CIRCUMFERENCE of 9 I/8 
inches. 
The practical 
consideration 
of separating 
the regions 
far 
enough 
to allow 
the pitcher 
a good 
grip 
requires 
that 
the 
“neck” 
distance 
be about 
1 3/16 
inches. 
The 
base- 
ball 
cover was invented 
by Elias 
Drake 
as a boy in the 
1840s. 
(Thompson’s 
attribution 
of the 
current 
design 
to trial 
and error 
development 
by C. H. Jackson 
in the 
1860s is apparently 
unsubstantiated, 
as discovered 
by 
George 
Bart .) 
One way to produce 
a baseball 
cover is to draw the re- 
gions 
on a SPHERE, then 
cut them 
out. 
However, 
it is 
difficult 
to produce 
two identical 
regions 
in this 
man- 
ner. 
Thompson 
(1996) 
gives mathematical 
expressions 
giving 
baseball 
cover 
curves 
both 
in the plane 
and in 
3-D. J. H. Conway 
has humorously 
proposed 
the follow- 
ing 
“baseball 
curve 
conjecture:” 
no two definitions 
of 
“the” 
baseball 
curve 
will 
give 
the same 
answer 
unless 
their 
equivalence 
was obvious 
from 
the start.

Theorem 
N.B. 
A detailed 
on-line 
essay by S. Finch 
was the start- 
see BAYES’ FORMULA 
ing point 
for this entry. 
Given the PRIOR 
DISTRIBUTION, 
collect 
data 
to obtain 
the observed 
distribution. 
Then 
calculate 
the LIKELI- 
HOOD of the observed 
distribution 
as a function 
of pa- 
rameter 
values, 
multiply 
this 
likelihood 
function 
by the 
PRIOR DISTRIBUTION, 
and normalize 
to obtain 
a unit 
probability 
over all possible 
values. 
This 
is called 
the 
POSTERIOR 
DISTRIBUTION. 
The 
MODE 
of the distribu- 
tion 
is then 
the 
parameter 
estimate, 
and 
“probability 
intervals” 
(the Bayesian 
analog 
of CONFIDENCE 
INTER- 
VALS) can be calculated 
using-the 
standard 
procedure. 
Bayesian 
analysis 
is somewhat 
controversial 
because 
the 
validity 
of the result 
depends 
on how valid 
the PRIOR 
DISTRIBUTION 
is, and this 
cannot 
be assessed statisti- 
cally.

Beast 
Number 
The occult 
“number 
of the beast” 
associated 
in the Bible 
with 
the Antichrist. 
It has figured 
in many 
numerolog- 
ical studies. 
It is mentioned 
in Revelation 
13:13: 
“Here 
is wisdom. 
Let him 
that 
hath 
understanding 
count 
the 
number 
of the beast: 
for it is the number 
of a man; 
and 
his number 
is 666.” 
The 
beast 
number 
has 
several 
interesting 
properties 
which 
numerologists 
may 
find 
particularly 
interesting 
(Keith 
1982-83). 
In 
particular, 
the 
beast 
number 
is 
equal 
to the sum of the squares 
of the first 7 PRIMES 
22 + 32 + 52 + 72 + 112 + 132 + 172 = 666, 
(1) 
satisfies 
the identity 
4(666) 
= 6 l 
6.6, 
(2) 
where 
4 is the T~TIENT 
FUNCTION, 
as well as the sum 
6.6 
x 
i = 666. 
(3) 
i=l 
The number 
666 is a sum and difference 
of the first three 
6th POWERS, 
666 = l6 - 26 + 36 
(4) 
(Keith). 
Another 
curious 
identity 
is that 
there 
are ex- 
actly 
two ways to insert 
“+” 
signs 
into 
the 
sequence 
123456789 
to make 
the sum 
666, and exactly 
one way 
for the sequence 
987654321, 
666 = I+ 
2 + 3 + 4 + 567 + 89 = 123 + 456 + 78 + 9 
(5) 
666 = 9 + 87 + 6 + 543 + 21 
(6) 
(Keith). 
666 is a REPDIGIT, 
and is also a TRIANGJJLAR 
NUMBER 
T6.6 
= T36 
= 666. 
(7) 
In fact, it is the largest 
REPDIGIT 
TRIANGULAR 
NUM- 
BER (Bellew 
and Weger 
1975-76). 
666 is also a SMITH 
NUMBER. 
The 
first 
144 DIGITS 
of 7r - 3, where x is PI, 
add to 666. In addition 
144 = (6 + 6) x (6 + 6) (Blatner 
1997). 
A number 
of the form 
2” which 
contains 
the digits 
of the 
beast 
number 
“666” 
is called 
an APOCALYPTIC 
NUM- 
BER, and a number 
having 
666 digits 
is called 
an APOC- 
ALYPSE 
NUMBER.

Bend 
(Curvature) 
Given 
four mutually 
tangent 
circles, 
their 
bends 
are de- 
fined 
as the signed 
CURVATURES 
of the 
CIRCLES. 
If the 
contacts 
are all external, 
the signs are all taken 
as POS- 
ITIVE, 
whereas 
if one circle 
surrounds 
the other 
three, 
the 
sign of this 
circle 
is taken 
as NEGATIVE 
(Coxeter 
1969).

Bergman 
Space 
Let G be an open subset

let L:(G) 
denote 
the collection 
of all ANALYTIC FUNC- 
TIONS 
f : G + 
C whose MODULUS 
is square 
integrable 
with respect 
to AREA measure. 
Then 
L:(G), 
sometimes 
also denote’d 
A2(G), 
is called 
the Bergman

Thus, 
the Bergman 
space consists 
of all the ANALYTIC

The

(2) 
Since the series terminates 
after a finite 
number 
of terms 
for INTEGRAL 
n, the Bernoulli 
inequality 
for x > 0 is 
obtained 
by truncating 
after the first-order 
term. 
When 
-1 
< x < 0, slightly 
more 
finesse is needed. 
In this case, 
let y = 1x1 = --2 > 0 so that 
0 < y < 1, and take 
(l-y)” 
= l-ny++t(n-l)y2+(n-l)(n-2)y3+.

Since each POWER 
of y multiplies 
by a number 
< 1 and 
since the ABSOLUTE 
VALUE 
of the COEFFICIENT 
of each 
subsequent 
term 
is smaller 
than 
the last, it follows 
that 
the sum 
of the third

Bernoulli’s 
Paradox 
Suppose 
the HARMONIC 
SERIES 
converges 
to h: 
= h. 
k=l 
Then 
rearranging 
the terms 
in the sum gives 
h-l=h, 
which 
is a contradiction.

if n > 1, then 
there

at least 
one PRIME 
between

It was proved 
in 1850-51 
by Chebyshev, 
and 
is therefore 
sometimes 
known 
as CHEBYSHEV’S 
THEOREM. 
An elegant 
proof

is 
that 
if n > k, then there is a number 
containing 
a PRIME

Theorem 
127 
Betti 
Number 
Betti 
numbers 
are topological 
objects 
which were proved 
to be invariants 
by Poincare, 
and used by him 
to ex- 
tend 
the POLYHEDRAL FORMULA to higher 
dimensional 
spaces. 
The 
nth 
Betti 
number 
is the rank 
of the nth 
HOMOLOGY GROUP. Let p, be the RANK of the Ho- 
MOLOGY GROUP HT ofa TOPOLOGICAL SPACEK. 
For 
a closed, 
orientable 
surface 
of GENUS g, the Betti 
num- 
bers are po = 1, pl 
= 2g, and 
p2 
= 1. 
For a nonori- 
entable 
surface 
with k CROSS-CAPS, the Betti 
numbers 
are PO 
= 1, pl 
= IC - 1, and p2 = 0.

Bkier 
Curve 
PI 
a 
Given 
a set of n control 
points, 
the corresponding 
B&ier 
curve 
(or BERNSTEIN-B~ZIER 
CURVE) is given 
by 
C(t) 
= UP&,&), 
i=o 
where 
Bi,, (t) is a BERNSTEIN POLYNOMIAL and 
t E

1 - 
A “rational” 
Bkzier 
curve is defined 
by 
C(t) c 
- yxo Bi,&)WiPi 
- c yxo &,&)Wi ’ 
where p is the order, 
Bi,, 
are the BERNSTEIN POLYNO- 
MIALS, Pi 
are control 
points, 
and the weight 
wi of Pi 
is 
the last ordinate 
of the homogeneous 
point 
Pp. 
These 
curves are closed under 
perspective 
transformations, 
and 
can represent 
CONIC SECTIONS exactly. 
The 
B&ier 
curve 
always 
passes through 
the 
first 
and 
last control 
points 
and lies within 
the CONVEX 
HULL 
of 
the control 
points. 
The 
curve is tangent 
to PI 
- PO and 
P,-P,- 
1 at the endpoints. 
The “variation 
diminishing 
property” 
of these curves is that 
no line 
can have more 
intersections 
with 
a Bezier 
curve 
than 
with 
the curve 
obtained 
by joining 
consecutive 
points 
with straight 
line 
segments. 
A desirable 
property 
of these 
curves 
is that 
the curve 
can be translated 
and rotated 
by performing 
these operations 
on the control 
points. 
the fact that 
moving 
a single 
control 
point 
changes 
the 
global 
shape 
of the 
curve. 
The 
former 
is sometimes 
avoided 
by smoothly 
patching 
together 
low-order 
B6zier 
curves. 
A generalization 
of the Ezier 
curve 
is the B- 
SPLINE.

Theorem 
In general,

have 
a common 
factor). 
This 
can also be stated: 
if P and Q are two POLYNOMI- 
ALS with no roots in common, 
then there 
exist two other 
POLYNOMIALS A and B such that

In more 
technical 
terms, 
“ge- 
ometric 
extremality 
implies

The 
conjecture 
had been 
proven 
for the first six terms 
(the 
cases n = 2, 3, and 4 were done by Bieberbach, 
Lowner, 
and 
Shiffer 
and 
Garbedjian, 
respectively), 
was known 
to be false for only 
a finite 
number 
of indices 
(Hayman 
1954), 
and true 
for a convex 
or symmetric 
domain 
(Le 
Lionnais 
1983). 
The 
general 
case was proved 
by Louis 
de Branges 
(1985). 
De Branges 
proved 
the MILIN 
CON- 
JECTURE, 
which 
established 
the ROBERTSON 
CONJEC- 
TURE, 
which 
in turn 
established 
the Bieberbach 
conjec- 
ture 
(Stewart 
1996).

Table 
Problem 
Given 
a billiard 
table 
with only corner 
pockets 
and sides 
of INTEGER lengths 
m and 
n, 
a ball 
sent at a 45” angle 
from 
a corner 
will be pocketed 
in a corner 
after m+ 
n - 2 
bounces, 
see also ALHAZEN'S BILLIARD 
PROBLEM, 
BILLIARDS 
Billiards 
The game of billiards 
is played 
on a RECTANGULAR 
table 
(known 
as a billiard 
table) 
upon 
which 
balls 
are placed. 
One 
ball 
(the 
“cue 
ball”) 
is then 
struck 
with 
the end 
of a “cue” 
stick, 
causing 
it to bounce 
into 
other 
balls 
and 
REFLECT 
off the sides of the table. 
Real 
billiards 
can involve 
spinning 
the ball 
so that 
it does not travel 
in a straight 
LINE, 
but 
the mathematical 
study 
of bil- 
liards 
generally 
consists 
of REFLECTIONS 
in which 
the 
reflection 
and incidence 
angles 
are the same. 
However, 
strange 
table 
shapes such as CIRCLES 
and ELLIPSES 
are 
often 
considered. 
Many 
interesting 
problems 
can arise. 
For example, 
ALHAZEN'S 
BILLIARD 
PROBLEM 
seeks to 
find the point 
at the edge of a circular 
“billiards” 
table 
at which 
a cue ball 
at a given 
point 
must 
be aimed 
in 
order 
to carom 
once off the edge of the table 
and strike 
another 
ball 
at a second 
given 
point. 
It was not until 
1997 that 
Neumann 
proved 
that 
the problem 
is insoluble 
using 
a COMPASS 
and RULER construction. 
On an ELLIPTICAL 
billiard 
table, 
the ENVELOPE of a 
trajectory 
is a smaller 
ELLIPSE, 
a HYPERBOLA, 
a LINE 
through 
the FOCI of the ELLIPSE, 
or periodic 
curve (e.g., 
DIAMOND-shape) 
(Wagon 
1991).

-n 
is most 
commonly 
represented 
as the complement 
of 
the POSITIVE 
number 
n - 1, so -11 
= 00001011~ 
would 
be written 
as the 
complement 
of 10 = 00001010~, 
or 
11110101. 
This 
allows 
addition 
to be carried 
out with 
the usual 
carrying 
and the left-most 
digit 
discarded, 
so 
17 - 11 = 6 gives 
00010001

Binary 
Bracketing 
The 
number 
of 
times 
k 
a 
given 
binary 
number 
b, . - - b&l bo is divisible 
by 2 is given 
by the position 
of the first 
bk = I counting 
from 
the right. 
For exam- 
ple, 
12 = 1100 is divisible 
by 2 twice, 
and 
13 = 1101 is 
divisible 
by 2 0 times. 
Unfortunately, 
the storage 
of binary 
numbers 
in com- 
puters 
is not entirely 
standardized. 
Because 
computers 
store 
information 
in g-bit 
bytes 
(where 
a bit 
is a sin- 
gle binary 
digit), 
depending 
on the 
“word 
size” 
of the 
machine, 
numbers 
requiring 
more 
than 
8 bits 
must 
be 
stored 
in multiple 
bytes. 
The 
usual 
FORTRAN77 
integer 
size is 4 bytes 
long. 
However, 
a number 
represented 
as 
(byte1 
byte2 
byte3 
byte4) 
in a VAX 
would 
be read and 
interpreted 
as (byte4 
byte3 
byte2 
bytel) 
on a Sun. 
The 
situation 
is even 
worse for floating 
point 
(real) 
num- 
bers, 
which 
are represented 
in binary 
as a MANTISSA 
and CHARACTERISTIC, 
and worse still 
for long 
(g-byte) 
reals! 
Binary 
multiplication 
of single 
bit 
numbers 
(0 or 1) is 
equivalent 
to the 
AND 
operation, 
as can be seen in the 
following

As shown 
by Kummer 
in 1852, 
the exact 
POWER 
of p 
dividing

to

et al. 
1989, Exercise 
5.36; Ribenboim 
1989; Vardi 
1991, p. 68). 
Kummer’s 
result 
can also be stated 
in the form 
that 
the 

Binomial

exponent 
of a PRIME p 
dividing 
(L) 
is given 
by the 
number 
of integers 
j > 0 for which 
frac(m/pj) 
> frac(nlpj), 
(26) 
where frac(z) 
denotes 
the FRACTIONAL PART of 2. This 
inequality 
may be reduced 
to the study 
of the exponen- 
tial sums 
'& 
A(n)e(x/n), 
where A(n) is the MANGOLDT 
FUNCTION. 
Estimates 
of these sums are given 
by Jutila 
(1974, 
1975), 
but recent 
improvements 
have been made 
by Granville 
and Ramare 
(1996). 
R. W. Gosper 
showed that 
f( > 
n= 
(-1)(“-u/2 
(mod 
n) 
(27) 
for all 
PRIMES, 
and 
conjectured 
that 
it holds 
only 
for 
PRIMES. This 
was disproved 
when Skiena 
(1990) 
found 
it also holds 
for the COMPOSITE NUMBER n = 3 x 11 x 
179. Vardi 
(1991, 
p. 63) subsequently 
showed 
that 
n = 
p2 is a solution 
whenever 
p is a WIEFERICH PRIME 
and 
that 
if n = pk with 
IG > 3 is a solution, 
then 
so is n = 
P Ic? 
This 
allowed 
him 
to show that 
the only 
solutions 
for COMPOSITE n < 1.3x lo7 are 5907, 10932, and 35112, 
where 1093 and 3511 are WIEFERICH PRIMES. 
Consider 
the binomial 
coefficients 
2n-1 
, the first 
few 
( 
) 
of which 
are 1, 3, 10, 35, 126, . . . (STbane’s 
AOOl7OO). 
The GENERATING FUNCTION is 
; [--&-I] 
=~+32~+102~+352~+.~.. 
(28) 
These 
numbers 
are SQUAREFREE only 
for n = 2, 3, 4, 
6, 9, 10, 12, 36, 
l . l (Sloane’s 
A046097), 
with 
no others 
less than 
n = 10,000. 
Erdkk 
showed 
that 
the binomial 
coefficient 
(E) is never a POWER of an INTEGER for n > 
3 where 
k # 0, 1, n- 
1, and n (Le Lionnais 
1983, p. 48). 
The 
binomial 
coefficients 
( Lnnj21) are called 
CENTRAL 
BINOMIAL 
COEFFICIENTS, 
where 
1x1 
is 
the 
FLOOR 
FUNCTION, 
although 
the 
subset 
of coefficients 
(:) 
is 
sometimes 
also 
given 
this 
name. 
Erdes 
and 
Graham 
(1980, 
p. 71) conjectured 
that 
the CENTRAL BINOMIAL 
COEFFICIENT 
(v) 
is never SQUAREFREE 
for n > 4, and 
this 
is sometimes 
known 
as the 
ERD~S 
SQUAREFREE 
CONJECTURE. 
%RK&Y’S 
THEOREM (Sgrkijzy

provides 
a partial 
solution 
which 
states 
that 
the BINO- 
MIAL 
COEFFICIENT 
(r) 
is never 
SQUAREFREE for all 
sufficiently 
large 
n > no (Vardi 
1991). 
Granville 
and 
Ramare 
(1996) 
p roved 
that 
the only SQUAREFREE val- 
ues are n = 2 and 4. Sander 
(1992) 
subsequently 
showed 
that 
(““n’“) 
are also never 
SQUAREFREE 
for sufficiently 
large n as long as d is not 
“too 
big.” 
For p, Q, and T distinct 
PRIMES, then the above function 
satisfies 
f (Pdf 
(P)f W(r) 
= f (Pdf(P~)Pb) 
(mod 
PV) 
(29) 
(Vardi 
1991, p* 66). 
The 
binomial 
coefficient 
(r) 
mod 
2 can be computed 
using 
the XOR 
operation 
n XOR 
nz, making 
PASCAL’S 
TRIANGLE mod 
2 very easy to construct. 
The binomial 
coefficient 
“function” 
can be defined 
as 
C(x, 
y) = 
x! 
y!(z 
- y)! 
(Fowler 
1996))

It has a very complicated 
GRAPH for NEGATIVE x and y which is difficult 
to render 
using 
standard 
plotting

An approximation 
to the Bernoulli 
distribution 
for large 
N 
can 
be obtained 
by expanding 
about 
the 
value 
C 
where P(n) 
is a maximum, 
i.e., where dP/dn 
= 0. Since 
the LOGARITHM 
function 
is MONOTONIC, 
we can instead 
choose to expand 
the LOGARITHM. 
Let n = fi + q, then 
l@(n)] 
= ln[P(fi)]+B~q+@~q2+$B3~3+. 
. . , (18) 
where 
(19) 
But 
we are expanding 
about 
the maximum, 
so, by defi- 
nition, 
BI

dn 
= 0. 
n=fi 
(20) 
This 
also means 
that 
B2 is negative, 
so we can write 
Bz = -IB& 
NOW, 
taking 
the LOGARITHM 
of (1) gives 
ln[P(n)]

A number 
is said to be biquadratefree 
if its PRIME de- 
composition 
contains 
no tripled 
factors. 
All PRIMES are 
therefore 
trivially 
biquadratefree. 
The 
biquadratefrce 
numbers 
are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 
15, 17, 
l . . (Sloane’s 
A046100). 
The biquadrateful 
num- 
bers (i.e., 
those 
that 
contain 
at least 
one biquadrate) 
are 16, 32, 48, 64, 80, 81, 96, . . . (Sloane’s 
A046101). 
The number 
of biquadratefree 
numbers 
less than 
10, 100, 
1000, 
. . . are 10, 93, 925, 9240, 92395,

their 
asymptotic 
density 
is l/5(4)

where c(n) is the RIEMANN ZETA FUNCTION. 
Every POSITIVE integer 
is expressible 
as a SUM of (at 
most) 
g(4) = 19 biquadratic 
numbers 
(WARING’S PROB- 
LEM). Davenport 
(1939) 
showed 
that 
G(4) 
= 16, mean- 
ing 
that 
all 
sufficiently 
large 
integers 
require 
only 
16 
biquadratic 
numbers. 
The

Ergodic 
Theorem 
Let T be an ergodic 
ENDOMORPHISM 
of the PROBABIL- 
ITY SPACE X and let f : X + Iw be a real-valued 
MEA- 
SURABLE 
FUNCTION. 
Then 
for ALMOST

x f X, 
we have 
ln 
= 
- 
IE 
f oF3(x)+ 
fdm 
n j=l 
s 
as n -+ 00. To illustrate 
this, 
take f to be the charac- 
teristic 
function 
of some SUBSET 
A of X so that 
f0 
{ 
1 
ifxfA 
x= 
0 
if x $ A. 
The 
left-hand 
side of (-1) 
just 
says how often 
the or- 
bit 
of x (that 
is, the 
points 
x, TX, 
57’2, 
. . l ) lies in 
A, and the right-hand 
side is just 
the 
MEASURE 
of A. 
Thus, 
for an ergodic 
ENDOMORPHISM, 
“space-averages 
= time-averages 
almost 
everywhere.” 
Moreover, 
if T is 
continuous 
and 
uniquely 
ergodic 
with 
BOREL

MEASURE 
m and f is continuous, 
then 
we can

the third 
person’s 
birthday 
is different 
from 
the first two 
is [(d - Wl[@ - WI, 
and so on, up through 
the nth 
person. 
Explicitly, 
In 
general, 
let 
Q&z, 
d) denote 
the 
probability 
that 
a 
birthday 
is shared 
by exactly 
i (and 
no more) 
people 
out of a group 
of n people. 
Then 
the probability 
that 
a 
birthday 
is shared 
by k or more people 
is given 
by 
Pk(n,d) 
= 1 - FQi(n,d).

explicitly 
as

(,“_a) 
Sut 
this can be written 
in terms 
of FACTORIALS 
as 
d! 
Ql(ny d, = (d _ n)!dn’ 
(2) 
so the probability 
P2 (n, 365) that 
two people 
out 
of a 
group 
of n do have 
the sume 
birthday 
is therefore 
P&,d) 
= 1 - Ql(n,d) 
= 1 - 
d! 
(d - n)!d”’ 
(3) 
If 365-day 
years have been assumed, 
i.e., the existence 
of 
leap days is ignored, 
then 
the number 
of people 
needed 
for there 
to be at least 
a 50% chance 
that 
two share 
birthdays 
is the smallest 
n such that 
Pz(n, 
365) 
> l/2.

This 
is given 
by 12 = 23, since 
Pz(23,365)

However, 
the time 
to compute 
this 
recursive

grows exponentially 
with 
JG and so rapidly 
be- 
comes 
unwieldy. 
The

For p = 0.5 and

A

by 
n = 47(k

Block 
Growth 
Let 
(2~2122. 
l . ) be a sequence 
over a finite 
ALPHABET 
A (all 
the entries 
are elements 
of A). 
Define 
the block 
growth 
function 
B(n) 
of a sequence 
to be the number 
of ADMISSIBLE words of length 
n. For example, 
in the 
sequence 
aabaabaabuabuub. 
l . , the following 
words are 
ADMISSIBLE 
Length 
Admissible 
Words 
1 
4 
2 
au, ub, bu 
3 
ad, 
ubu, baa 
4 
uubu, ubau, buub 
so B(1) 
= 2, B(2) 
= 3, B(3) 
= 3, B(4) 
= 3, and 
so 
on. 
Notice 
that 
B(n) 
5 B(n 
+ l), 
so the block 
growth 
function 
is always 
nondecreasing. 
This 
is because 
any 
ADMISSIBLE word 
of length 
n can be extended 
right- 
wards to produce 
an ADMISSIBLE 
word of length 
n + 1. 
Moreover, 
suppose 
B(n) 
= B(n 
+ 1) for some n. Then 
each admissible 
word 
of length 
n extends 
to a unique 
ADMISSIBLE word of length 
n+ 
1. 
For a SEQUENCE in which 
each substring 
of length 
n 
uniquely 
determines 
the next symbol 
in the 
SEQUENCE, 
there 
are only 
finitely 
many 
strings 
of length 
n, so the 
process 
must 
eventually 
cycle and the SEQUENCE must 
be eventually 
periodic. 
This 
gives us the following 
the- 
orems: 
1. If the SEQUENCE is eventually 
periodic, 
with 
least 
period 
p, then 
B(n) 
is strictly 
increasing 
until 
it 
reaches p, and B(n) 
is constant 
thereafter. 
2. If the 
SEQUENCE 
is not 
eventually 
periodic, 
then 
B(n) 
is strictly 
increasing 
and so B(n) 
2 n+l 
for all 
n. If a SEQUENCE has the property 
that 
B(n) 
= n+l 
for all n, then it is said to have minimal 
block 
growth, 
andthe 
SEQUENCE iscalleda 
STURMIAN SEQUENCE. 
The block 
growth 
is also called 
the GROWTH FUNCTION 
or the COMPLEXITY 
of a SEQUENCE.

Bonferroni 
Correction 
The Bonferroni 
correction 
is a multiple-comparison 
cor- 
rection 
used 
when 
several 
independent 
STATISTICAL 
TESTS are being 
performed 
simultaneously 
(since while 
a given ALPHA VALUE QI may 
be appropriate 
for each 
individual 
comparison, 
it is not 
for the set of all com- 
parisons). 
In order 
to avoid 
a lot of spurious 
positives, 
the ALPHA VALUE needs to be lowered 
to account 
for 
the number 
of comparisons 
being 
performed. 
The 
simplest 
and 
most 
conservative 
approach 
is the 
Bonferroni 
correction, 
which 
sets the ALPHA VALUE for 
the entire 
set of n comparisons 
equal 
to a by taking 
the 
ALPHA VALUE for each comparison 
equal 
to a/n. 
Ex- 
plicitly, 
given 
n tests Ti for hypotheses 
Hi 
(1 < i < n) 
- 
- 
under 
the 
assumption 
Ho 
that 
all 
hypotheses 
I& 
are 
false, and if the individual 
test critical 
values are < a/n, 
- 
then the experiment-wide 
critical 
value is 5 a. In equa- 
tion 
form, 
if 
P(Ti 
passes (Ho) 5 2 n 
for 1 < i < n, then 
- 
- 
P(some 
Ti passes IHO) 5 a, 
which 
follows 
from 
BONFERRONI’S 
INEQUALITY. 
Another 
correction 
instead 
uses 1-(1--a)‘? 
While 
this 
choice is applicable 
for two-sided 
hypotheses, 
multivari- 
ate normal 
statistics, 
and 
positive 
orthant 
dependent 
statistics, 
it is not, 
in general, 
correct 
(Shaffer 
1995).

Boolean 
Algebra 
In more 
modern 
terms, 
a Boolean 
algebra 
is a SET B of 
elements 
a, b, 
l . . with 
the following 
properties: 
1. B has two binary 
operations, 
A (WEDGE) 
and V 
(VEE), 
which 
satisfy 
the IDEMP~TENT laws 
aAa=aVa=a, 
the COMMUTATIVE laws 
aO-b/\a 
aVb=bVa, 
and the ASSOCIATIVE laws 
a A (b /\ c) = (a A b) A c 
a V (b V c> = (a V b) V c. 
2. The 
operations 
satisfy 
the ABSORPTION 
LAW 
a A (a V b) = a V (a A b) = a. 
3. The 
operations 
are mutually 
distributive 
a A (b V c> = (a A b) V (a A c) 
aV 
(b AC) = (a V b) A (a Vc). 
4. B contains 
universal 
bounds 
0,1 
which 
satisfy 
5. B has a unary 
operation 
a -+ a’ of 
which 
obeys the laws 
OAa=O 
OVa=a 
IAa=a 
Iva=I. 
complementation 
aVa’=I 
(Birkhoff 
and 
Mac 
Lane 
1965). 
Under 
intersection, 
union, 
and complement, 
the subsets 
of any set I form 
a 
Boolean 
algebra. 
Huntington 
(1933a, 
b) presented 
the following 
basis for 
Boolean 
algebra, 
1. Commutivity. 
x + y = y + x. 
2. Associativity. 
(x + y) + z = x + (y + z). 
3. HUNTINGTON 
EQUATION. 
n(n(x) 
+ y) + n(n(x) 
+ 
n(Y)) 
= 5. 
H. 
Robbins 
then 
conjectured 
that 
the 
HUNTINGTON 
EQUATION could 
be replaced 
with 
the simpler 
ROBBINS

conjectured 
that 
it is possible 
to cut an n-D 
shape 
of DIAMETER 
1 into 
n + I pieces 
each with 
di- 
ameter 
smaller 
than 
the original. 
It is true 
for n = 2, 
3 and when the boundary 
is “smooth.” 
However, 
the 
minimum 
number 
of pieces required 
has been shown to 
increase 
as N 1.1 ? 
Since 
l.lfi 
> n + 1 at n = 9162, 
the conjecture 
becomes 
false at high dimensions. 
In fact, 
the limit 
has been pushed 
back to N 2000.

Bowling 
Bowling 
is a game 
played 
by rolling 
a heavy 
ball 
down 
a long narrow 
track 
and attempting 
to knock 
down ten 
pins arranged 
in the form of a TRIANGLE with its vertex 
oriented 
towards 
the bowler. 
The 
number 
10 is, in fact, 
the TRIANGULAR 
NUMBER 
T4 
= 4(4 + 1)/2 
= 10. 
Two “bowls” 
are allowed 
per “frame.” 
If all the pins are 
knocked 
down in the two bowls, 
the score for that 
frame 
is the number 
of pins knocked 
down. 
If some or none of 
the pins are knocked 
down on the first bowl, then all the 
pins knocked 
down on the second, 
it is called 
a “spare,” 
and the number 
of points 
tallied 
is 10 plus the number 
of pins 
knocked 
down 
on the bowl 
of the next 
frame. 
If all of the pins 
are knocked 
down 
on the first 
bowl, 
the number 
of points 
tallied 
is 10 plus 
the number 
of 
pins knocked 
down on the next 
two bowls. 
Ten frames 
are bowled, 
unless the last frame 
is a strike 
or spare, in 
which 
case an additional 
bowl is awarded. 
The maximum 
number 
of points 
possible, 
corresponding 
to knocking 
down all 10 pins on every bowl, 
is 300.

Boy Surface 
A NONORIENTABLE 
SURFACE 
which 
is one of the three 
possible 
SURFACES 
obtained 
by sewing a MOBIUS 
STRIP 
to the edge of a DISK. 
The 
other 
two are the CROSS-

The Boy surface is a model 
of the PROJECTIVE 
PLANE 
without 
singularities 
and is 
a SEXTIC 
SURFACE. 
The 
Boy 
surface 
can 
be described 
using 
the 
general 
method 
for NONORIENTABLE 
SURFACES, 
but 
this 
was 
not 
known 
until 
the analytic 
equations 
were found 
by 
Apery 
(1986). 
B ased on the fact that 
it had been proven 
impossible 
to describe 
the surface 
using 
quadratic 
poly- 
nomials, 
Hopf had conjectured 
that 
quartic 
polynomials 
were also insufficient 
(Pinkall 
1986). 
Ap&y’s 
IMMER- 
SION proved 
this conjecture 
wrong,

Find

a bead

and ACCELERATED 
by gravity 
will 
slip 
(with-

from

This 
was one of the earliest 
problems 
posed 
in the CAL- 
CULUS 
OF VARIATIONS. 
The 
solution, 
a segment 
of a 
CYCLOID, 
was 
found 
by 
Leibniz, 
L’Hospital, 
Newton, 
and the two 
Bernoullis.

The VELOCITY

equating 
kinetic

to 
gravitational 
potential 
energy,

Plugging 
this 
into

gives 
2 m

t12 _

The function 
to be varied 
is thus 
f = (1 + y’2)1’2(2gy)-1’2.

To proceed, 
one would 
normally 
have 
to apply 
the full- 
blown 
EULER-LAGRANGE 
DIFFERENTIAL 
EQUATION

(6) 
However, 
the 
function 
f(y, 
y’,zc) 
is particularly 
nice 
since 
x does 
not 
appear 
explicitly. 
Therefore, 
8f /ax = 
0, and we can immediately 
use the BELTRAMI

Brachistochrone 
Problem 
subtracting 
y’(af

from 
f, 
and 
simplifying 
then 
gives 
Squaring 
both 
sides 
and rearranging 
slightly 
results 
in 
(10) 
where 
the 
square 
of the 
old 
constant 
C has 
been 
ex- 
pressed 
in terms 
of a new 
(POSITIVE) 
constant 
K2. This 
equation 
is solved 
by the parametric 
equations 
2 = $“(8

(11) 
y = $k2(1 
- cosq, 
(12) 
which 
are-lo 
and behold-the 
equations 
of a CYCLOID. 
If kinetic 
friction 
is included, 
the 
problem 
can also be 
solved 
analytically, 
although 
the solution 
is significantly 
messier. 
In that 
case, terms 
corresponding 
to the normal 
component 
of weight 
and 
the normal 
component 
of the 
ACCELERATION 
(present 
because 
of path 
CURVATURE) 
must 
be included. 
Including 
both 
terms 
requires 
a con- 
strained 
variational 
technique 
(Ashby 
et al. 1975), 
but 
including 
the normal 
component 
of weight 
only 
gives 
an

A one-variable

Consider

Now enumerate

A general

is constructed 
by 
iteratively

which 
switches 
the lower 
endpoints

fixed-with 
the (i + 1)th

brought

Theorem 
If the total 
group 
of the canonical 
series is divided 
into 
two parts, 
the difference 
between 
the number 
of points 
in each part 
and 
the 
double 
of the 
dimension 
of the 
complete 
series to which 
it belongs 
is the same.

of a TRIANGLE for which 
the ANGLES 
LOAB, 
LOBC,

numbers 
are PAIRS 
(m, n) of INTEGERS 
satisfying 
the condition 
of BROCARD'S 
PROBLEM, 
i.e., such that 
n! + 1 = rn2 
where n! is the FACTORIAL 
and m2 is a SQUARE 
NUM- 
BER. 
Only 
three 
such 
PAIRS 
of numbers 
are known: 
(V), 
(11,5), 
(To, 
and 
Erdes 
conjectured 
that 
these 
are the only three such PAIRS. 
Le Lionnais 
(1983) points 
out that 
there 
are 3 numbers 
less than 
200,000 
for which 
(n 
- l)! + 1 = 0 (mod 
n”) 
, 
namely 
5, 13, and 563.

Theorem 
If n = 1,2 
(mod 
4), and the SQUAREFREE 
part of n is di- 
visible 
by a PRIME 
p = 3 (mod 
4), then no DIFFERENCE 
SET of ORDER 
n exists. 
Equivalently, 
if a PROJECTIVE 
PLANE 
of order 
n exists, 
and n = 1 or 2 (mod 
4), then 
n is the sum of two SQUARES. 
Dinitz 
and Stinson

lowing 
form.

Bubble 
see UZSO BUFFON’S 
NEEDLE 
PROBLEM 
A bubble 
is a MINIMAL 
SURFACE 
of the type 
that 
is 
formed 
by soap film. 
The 
simplest 
bubble 
is a single 
SPHERE. 
More 
complicated 
forms 
occur 
when 
multi- 
ple bubbles 
are joined 
together. 
Two outstanding 
prob- 
lems involving 
bubbles 
are to find the arrangements 
with 
the smallest 
PERIMETER 
(planar 
problem) 
or SURFACE 
AREA 
(AREA 
problem) 
which 
enclose 
and 
separate 
r~ 
given 
unit 
areas 
or volumes 
in the plane 
or in space. 
For n = 2, the problems 
are called 
the 
DOUBLE 
BUB- 
BLE 
CONJECTURE 
and the solution 
to both 
problems 
is 
knownto 
be the DOUBLE

Bumping 
Algorithm 
Given 
a PERMUTATION {pl,p2,...,p,} 
of (1, 
. . . . n}, 
the bumping 
algorithm 
constructs 
a standard 
YOUNG 
TABLEAU by inserting 
the pi one by one into 
an already 
constructed 
YOUNG TABLEAU. 
To 
apply 
the 
bump- 
ing 
algorithm, 
start 
with 
{{PI}}, 
which 
is a YOUNG 
TABLEAU. If p1 through 
pk have already 
been inserted, 
then 
in order 
to insert 
pk+l, 
start 
with 
the first line of 
the 
already 
constructed 
YOUNG TABLEAU and search 
for the first 
element 
of this 
line 
which 
is greater 
than 
pk+l. 
If there 
is no such element, 
append 
pk+l 
to the 
first line and stop. 
If there 
is such an element 
(say, pP), 
exchange 
p, for pk+l, 
search 
the second 
line 
using 
p,, 
and so on.

Burnside’s 
Lemma 
Let 
J be a FINITE

and 
the 
image 
R(J) 
be a 
representation 
which 
is a HOMEOMORPHISM 
of J into 
a

S(X), 
where S(X) 
is the GROUP 
of all permutations 
of a SET X. 
Define 
the orbits 
of R( J) 
as the equivalence 
classes under 
II: - y, which 
is true 
if 
there is some permutation 
p in R(J) 
such that p(z) 
= y. 
Define 
the fixed points 
of p as the elements 
5 of X for 
which 
p(z) 
= z. Then 
the 
AVERAGE 
number 
of FIXED 
POINTS 
of permutations 
in R(J) 
is equal 
to the number 
of orbits 
of R(J). 
The 
LEMMA 
was apparently 
known 
by Cauchy 
(1845) 
in 
obscure 
form 
and Frobenius 
(1887) 
prior 
to Burnside’s 
(1900)

It was subsequently 
extended

refined 
by Pblya 
(1937) 
for applications 
in COMBINATO-

Burnside 
Problem 
A problem 
originating 
with 
W. 
Burnside 
(1902), 
who 
wrote, 
CtA still 
undecided 
point 
in the 
theory 
of dis- 
continuous 
groups 
is whether 
the 
ORDER 
of a GROUP 
may 
be not 
finite, 
while 
the order 
of every 
operation 
it 
contains 
is finite.” 
This 
question 
would 
now be 
phrased 
as “Can 
a finitely 
generated 
group 
be infinite 
while 
every 
element 
in 
the 
group 
has 
finite 
order?” 
(Vaughan-Lee 
1990). 
This 
question 
was answered 
by 
Golod 
(1964) 
when he constructed 
finitely 
generated 
in- 
finite 
~-GROUPS. 
These 
GROUPS, 
however, 
do not have 
a finite 
exponent. 
Let 
FT be the 
FREE 
GROUP 
of RANK 
T and let N be 
the 
SUBGROUP 
generated 
by the 
set of nth 
POWERS 
($19 
E FT}. 
Th en Iv is a normal 
subgroup 
of FT. We 
define 
B(T, 
n) = FT/N 
to be the QUOTIENT 
GROUP. 
We 
call B(r, n) the r-generator 
Burnside 
group 
of exponent 
n. It is the largest 
r-generator 
group 
of exponent 
n, in 
the sense that 
every other 
such group 
is a HOMEOMOR- 
PHIC image 
of B(T, n)* The 
Burnside 
problem 
is usually 
stated 
as: 
“For 
which 
values 
of T and 
n is B(r, n) a 
FINITE 
GROUP?” 
An answer is known 
for the following 
values. 
For T = 1, 
B&n) 
is a CYCLIC 
GROUP 
of ORDER 
n. 
For n = 2, 
B(r, 
2) is an elementary 
ABELTAN 
2-group 
of ORDER 
2Y 
For n = 3, B(T, 
3) was proved 
to be finite 
by Burnside. 
The 
ORDER 
of the 
B(r, 
3) groups 
was established 
by 
Levi 
and van der Waerden 
(1933), 
namely 
3a where 
(1) 
where 
(;) 
is a BINOMIAL 
COEFFICIENT. 
For n = 
4, 
B(r, 
4) was proved 
to be finite 
by Sanov 
(1940). 
Groups 
of exponent 
four 
turn 
out 
to be the most 
complicated 
for which 
a POSITIVE 
solution 
is known. 
The 
precise 
nilpotency 
class and derived 
length 
are known, 
as are 
bounds 
for the ORDER. 
For example, 
IB(2,4)1 
= 212 
(2) 
IB(3,4)1 
= 26g 
(3) 
IB(4,4)1 
= 2422 
(4) 
IB(5,4)1 
= 22728, 
(5) 
while 
for larger 
values 
of T the 
exact 
value 
is not yet 
known. 
For n = 6, B(T, 
6) was proved 
to be finite 
by 
Hall 
(1958) 
with 
ORDER 
2”3’, 
where 
(8) 
No other 
Burnside 
groups 
are known 
to be finite. 
On 
the other 
hand, 
for 
T  > 2 and n 2 665, with 
n ODD, 

Busemann-Petty 
Problem 
B(T, n) is infinite 
(Novikov 
and Adjan 
1968). 
There 
is a 
similar 
fact for T > 2 and n a large 
POWER 
of 2. 
E. Zelmanov 
was awarded 
a FIELDS 
MEDAL in 1994 for 
his solution 
of the “restricted” 
Burnside 
problem.

Cake 
Cutting 
It is always 
possible 
to “fairly” 
divide 
a cake among 
n 
people 
using 
only 
vertical 
cuts. 
Furthermore, 
it is pos- 
sible 
to cut 
and 
divide 
a cake such 
that 
each person 
believes 
that 
everyone 
has received 
l/n 
of the cake ac- 
cording 
to his own measure. 
Finally, 
if there 
is some 
piece on which 
two people 
disagree, 
then 
there 
is a way 
of partitioning 
and dividing 
a cake such that 
each par- 
ticipant 
believes 
that 
he has obtained 
more 
than 
l/n 
of 
the cake according 
to his own measure. 
Ignoring 
the height 
of the cake, the cake-cutting 
problem 
is really 
a question 
of fairly 
dividing 
a CIRCLE into 
n 
equal 
AREA 
pieces 
using 
cuts in its plane. 
One method 
of proving 
fair cake cutting 
to always 
be possible 
relies 
on the FROBENIUS-K~NIG 
THEOREM.

Calculus 
In general, 
“a” calculus 
is an abstract 
theory 
developed 
’ 
in a purely 
formal 
way. 
“The” 
calculus, 
more 
properly 
called 
ANALYSIS (or 
REAL 
ANALYSIS 
or, in older 
literature, 
INFINITESIMAL 
ANALYSIS) 
is the branch 
of mathematics 
studying 
the 
rate df change 
of quantities 
(which 
can be interpreted 
as 
SLOPES 
of curves) 
and the length, 
AREA, and VOLUME 
of objects. 
The 
CALCULUS 
is sometimes 
divided 
into 
DIFFERENTIAL 
and 
INTEGRAL 
CALCULUS, 
concerned 
with 
DERIVATIVES 
d 
dz 
x 
f( > 
and INTEGRALS 
respectively. 
While 
ideas related 
to calculus 
had been known 
for some 
time 
(Archimedes’ 
EXHAUSTION 
METHOD 
was a form 
of calculus), 
it was not 
until 
the independent 
work 
of 
Newton 
and Leibniz 
that 
the modern 
elegant 
tools 
and 
ideas of calculus 
were developed. 
Even 
so, many 
years 
elapsed 
until 
the subject 
was put 
on a mathematically 
rigorous 
footing 
by mathematicians 
such as WeierstraQ.

Cardinal 
Number 
In informal 
usage, 
a cardinal 
number 
is a number 
used 
in counting 
(a COUNTING NUMBER), such as 1, 2, 3, , , , l 
Formally, 
a cardinal 
number 
is a type of number 
defined 
in such a way that 
any method 
of counting 
SETS using it 
gives the same result. 
(This 
is not true for the ORDINAL 
NUMBERS.) In fact, the cardinal 
numbers 
are obtained 
by collecting 
all ORDINAL NUMBERS which 
are obtain- 
able by counting 
a given 
set. 
A set has No (ALEPH-0) 
members 
if it can be put into 
a ONE-TO-ONE correspon- 
dence with 
the finite 
ORDINAL 
NUMBERS. 
Two 
sets are said to have the same cardinal 
number 
if 
all the elements 
in the sets can be paired 
off ONE-TO- 
ONE. 
An INACCESSIBLE CARDINAL cannot 
be expressed 
in terms 
of a smaller 
number 
of smaller 
cardinals.

Cardioid 
The curve given by the POLAR equation 
T = a(1 + cod), 
(1 
sometimes 
also written 
T = 2b(1+ 
cod), 
(2 
where 
b = a/2, 
the CARTESIAN 
equation 
(x2 + y2 - ax)2 = a2(x2 + y”), 
>

and the parametric 
equations 
X = a cos t(1+ 
cos t) 
(4) 
y = asint(l+ 
cost). 
(5) 
The 
cardioid 
is a degenerate 
case of the LIMA~ON. 
It is 
also a l-CUSPED 
EPICYCLOID 
(with 
T = R) and is the 
CAUSTIC 
formed 
by rays originating 
at a point 
on the 
circumference 
of a CIRCLE 
and reflected 
by the CIRCLE. 
The 
name 
cardioid 
was first 
used 
by de Castillon 
in 
Philosophical 
Bxznsactions 
of the Royal 
Society 
in 1741. 
Its ARC 
LENGTH 
was found 
by La Hire 
in 1708. 
There 
are exactly 
three 
PARALLEL 
TANGENTS 
to the cardioid 
with 
any given 
gradient. 
Also, 
the TANGENTS at the 
ends 
of any CHORD through 
the 
CUSP point 
are at 
RIGHT 
ANGLES. 
The length 
of any CHORD 
through 
the 
CUSP point 
is 2~. 
The 
cardioid 
may 
also be generated 
as follows. 
Draw 
a CIRCLE 
C and fix a point 
A on it. 
Now draw a set 
of CIRCLES 
centered 
on the 
CIRCUMFERENCE 
of C and 
passing 
through 
A. 
The 
ENVELOPE 
of these 
CIRCLES 
is then 
a cardioid 
(Pedoe 
1995). 
Let the 
CIRCLE 
C be 
centered 
at the origin 
and have 
RADIUS 
1, and let the 
fixed point 
be A = (1,O). 
Then 
the RADIUS 
of a CIRCLE 
centered 
at an ANGLE 
0 from 
(1, 0) is 
r2 = (0 - cos8)2 + (1 - sin0)2 
= cos2 e + 1 - 2 sin 8 + sin2 8 
- 2(1 - sin0).

As usual, 
care must 
be taken 
in the evaluation 
of s(t) 
for t > 7r. Since f7) comes from an integral 
involving: 
the

it must

Cards 
Cards 
are a set of n rectangular 
pieces 
of cardboard 
with 
markings 
on one side and a uniform 
pattern 
on the 
other. 
The collection 
of all cards is called 
a “deck,” 
and 
a normal 
deck of cards consists 
of 52 cards 
of four dif- 
ferent 
“suits.” 
The suits 
are called 
clubs 
(&), 
diamonds 
(o), 
hearts 
(O), 
and spades 
(4). 
Spades 
and clubs are 

Carleman ‘s hequali 
ty 
colored 
black, 
while 
hearts 
and 
diamonds 
are colored 
red. The 
cards of each suit are numbered 
I through 
13, 
where the special 
terms 
ace (l), 
jack 
(ll), 
queen 
(12), 
and king 
(13) are used instead 
of numbers 
1 and 11-13. 
The 
randomization 
of the order 
of cards 
in a deck is 
called 
SHUFFLING. 
Cards 
are used in many 
gambling 
games 
(such 
as POKER), 
and 
the 
investigation 
of the 
probabilities 
of various 
outcomes 
in card games 
was one 
of the original 
motivations 
for the development 
of mod- 
ern PROBABILITY 
theory.

Carmichael 
Number 
A Carmichaelnumberis 
an ODD COMPOSITE NUMBER 
n which 
satisfies 
FERMAT'S LITTLE THEOREM 
a n-1 - 1 s 0 (mod 
n) 
for every choice 
of a satisfying 
(up-t) 
= 1 (i.e., 
a and 
n are RELATIVELY PRIME) with 
1 < a < 
n. 
A Car- 
michael 
number 
is therefore 
a PSEUDOPRIMES to any 
base. 
Carmichael 
numbers 
therefore 
cannot 
be found 
to be COMPOSITE using 
FERMAT'S LITTLE 
THEOREM. 
However, 
if (a, n) # 1, the congruence 
of FERMAT'S LIT- 
TLE THEOREM is sometimes 
NONZERO, thus identifying 
a Carmichael 
number 
n as COMPOSITES. 
Carmichael 
numbers 
are sometimes 
called 
ABSOLUTE 
PSEUDOPRIMES and also satisfy KORSELT~ CRITERION. 
R. D. Carmichael 
first noted 
the existence 
of such num- 
bers in 1910, 
computed 
15 examples, 
and 
conjectured 
that 
there 
were infinitely 
many 
(a fact finally 
proved 
by 
Alford 
et al. 
1994).

The 
first 
few Carmichael 
numbers 
are 561, 1105, 1729, 
2465, 2821, 6601, 
8911, 
10585, 
15841, 
29341, 
. . . 
(Sloane’s 
A002997). 
C armichael 
numbers 
have at least 
three 
PRIME FACTORS. 
For 
Carmichael 
numbers 
with 
exactly 
three PRIME FACTORS, 
once one of the PRIMES 
has been specified, 
there 
are only a finite 
number 
of Car- 
michael 
numbers 
which can be constructed. 
Numbers 
of 
the form 
(6Tc + l)( 12k + 1) (18k + 1) are Carmichael 
num- 
bers if each of the factors 
is PRIME (Korselt 
1899, Ore 
1988, Guy 
1994). 
This 
can be seen since for 
N = (6k+1)(12k+1)(18k+l) 
= 1296k3+396k2+36k+l, 
N - 1 is a multiple 
of 36J~ and 
the 
LEAST 
COMMON 
MULTIPLE of 6k, 
12k, and 
18/z is 36k, 
so aNwl 
E 
1 
modulo 
each of the PRIMES 
6k + 1, 12k + 1, and 18k + 
1, hence 
uRT-’ 
= 
1 modulo 
their 
product. 
The 
first 
few such Carmichael 
numbers 
correspond 
to k = 1, 6, 
35, 45, 51, 55, 56, . . . and are 1729, 294409, 
56052361, 
118901521, 
. . . (Sloane’s 
A046025). 
The 
largest 
known 
Carmichael 
number 
of this form was found by II. Dubner 
in 1996 and has 1025 digits. 
The smallest 
Carmichael 
numbers 
having 
3, 4, . . . fac- 
tors are 561 = 3 x 11 x 17, 41041 
= 7 x 11 x 13 x 41, 
825265, 321197185, 
. . . (Sloane’s 
A006931), 
In total, 
there 
are only 
43 Carmichael 
numbers 
< 
106, 
2163 
< 2.5 x lOlo, 105,212 < 1015, 
- 
and 246,683 
< 1016 (Pinch

Let 
C(n) 
d enote the number 
of Carmichael 
num- 
bers less than 
n. Then, 
for sufficiently 
large 
n (n - 
lo7 
from 
numerical 
evidence), 
C(n) 
- n217 
(Alford 
et al. 
1994). 
The 
Carmichael 
numbers 
have the following 
properties: 
1. If 
a PRIME 
p 
divides 
the 
Carmichael 
number 
n, 
then 
n 
= 
1 
(mod p - 1) implies 
that 
n 
G

P

2. Every 
Carmichael 
number 
is SQUAREFREE. 
3. An 
ODD 
COMPOSITE 
SQUAREFREE 
number 
n is a 
Carmichael 
number 
IFF n divides 
the DENOMINATOR 
of the BERNOULLI 
NUMBER &-I.

the TOTIENT

never 
takes

This 
assertion 
is called 
Car- 
michael’s

conjecture 
and is equivalent 
to the 
statement 
that 
there 
exists 
an m, # 
n such 
that 
#(n) 
= 4(m) 
(Ribenboim 
1996,

Any 
counterexample 
to the conjecture 
must 
have more 
than 
10,000 
DIGITS 
(Conway 
and 
Guy 
1996). 
Recently, 
the conjecture 
was reportedly 
proven 
by F. Saidak 
in 
November, 
1997 with 
a proof 
short 
enough 
to fit on a 
postcard.

Cassini 
Ovals 
<qcxL:‘:I:::x:::I-:(:, 
The curves, 
also called 
CASSINI 
ELLIPSES, 
described 
by 
a point 
such that 
the product 
of its distances 
from 
two 
fixed 
points 
a distance 
2a apart 
is a constant 
b2. The 
shape of the curve 
depends 
on b/a. 
If a < b, the curve 
is a single 
loop 
with 
an OVAL 
(left figure 
above) 
or dog 
bone 
(second 
figure) 
shape. 
The 
case a = b produces 
a LEMNISCATE 
(third 
figure). 
If a > b, then 
the curve 
consists 
of two loops 
(right 
figure). 
The 
curve was first 
investigated 
by Cassini 
in 1680 when he was studying 
the relative 
motions 
of the Earth 
and the Sun. 
Cassini 
believed 
that 
the Sun traveled 
around 
the Earth 
on one 
of these ovals, with 
the Earth 
at one FOCUS 
of the oval. 
Cassini 
ovals are ANALLAGMATIC 
CURVES. 
The Cassini 
ovals are defined 
in two-center 
BIPOLAR 
COORDINATES 
by the equation 
TIT2 = b2, 
(1) 
with the origin 
at a FOCUS. 
Even more 
incredible 
curves 
are produced 
by the 
locus 
of a point 
the 
product 
of 
whose distances 
from 
3 or more 
fixed 
points 
is a con- 
stant. 
The 
Cassini 
ovals have the CARTESIAN 
equation 
[(x - a)" + y”][(x 
+ a)’ + y”] = b4 
or the equivalent 
form 
(x2 + y2 + u2)2 - 4u2x2 
= b4 
(2) 
(3) 

Cassini 
Ovals

and the polar 
equation 
r4 + u4 - 2a2r2 cos(20) 
= b4. 
(4) 
Solving 
for r2 using 
the QUADRATIC 
EQUATION 
gives 
r2 = 2a2 cos(28) 
+ d4a4 
cos2(20) 
- 4(a4 - b”)

- - u2 cos(28) 
+ db4

. 
(5) 
If a < b, the curve has AREA 
f-0 
A= 
+r2 d0 = 2(i) 
where 
the 
integral 
has been 
done 
over half 
the 
curve 
and then 
multiplied 
by two and 
E(x) 
is the complete 
ELLIPTIC INTEGRAL OF THE SECOND KIND. 
If 
u 
= 
b, 
the curve becomes 
r2 = a2 
[ cos(20) 
+ J1-sin28 
= 2u2 cos(28),

which 
is a LEMNISCATE

scale of the usual 
lemniscate

has area A =

Catalan’s 
Conjecture 
8 and 9 (23 and 
32) are the only 
consecutive 
POWERS 
(excluding 
0 and 
l), 
i.e., 
the 
only 
solution 
to CATA- 
LAN'S DIOPHANTINE 
PROBLEM. 
Solutions

TIONS 
x2 - y" = 1 
X3 - Y2 = 1. 
This 
CONJECTURE 
has not yet been proved 
or refuted, 
although 
it has been 
shown 
to be decidable 
in a Fx- 
NITE 
(but 
more 
than 
astronomical) 
number 
of steps. 
In particular, 
if n and 
TI + 1 are POWERS, 
then 
n < 
expexpexpexp 
730 (Guy 
1994, 
pa 155), 
which 
follows 
from 
R. Tijdeman’s 
proof 
that 
there 
can be only 
a Fr- 
NITE number 
of exceptions 
should 
the CONJECTURE 
not 
hold. 
Hyyrb 
and 
M3kowski 
proved 
that 
there 
do not 
exist 
three 
consecutive 
POWERS 
(Ribenboim 
1996), 
and it is 
also known 
that 
8 and 9 are the only consecutive 
CUBIC 
and SQUARE 
NUMBERS 
(in either 
order).

Number 
The Catalan 
numbers 
are an INTEGER 
SEQUENCE 
{Cn} 
which 
appears 
in TREE

problems 
of the 
type, 
“In 
how many

n - 2 TRIANGLES 
if different 
orientations 
are counted 
separately?” 
(EULER'S

The 
solution 
is the 
Catalan 
number 
C+z 
(Dijrrie 
1965, Honsberger 
1973), 
as graphically 
il- 
lustrated 
below 
(Dickau). 
The 
first 
few Catalan

are 1, 2, 5, 14, 42, 132, 
429, 
1430, 
4862, 
16796, 
. . . (Sloane’s

The 
only ODD Catalan

are those of the form 
c2kBl, 
and the last 
DIGIT 
is five for k = 9 to 
15. 
The 
only 
PRIME 
Catalan

The 
Catalan

related 
types 
of problems. 
For instance, 
the Catalan 
number 
c 72-l gives the number 
of BINARY 
BRACKETINGS 
of n 
letters 
(CATALAN'S 
PROBLEM). 
The 
Catalan 
numbers 
also give 
the 
solution 
to the 
BALLOT

the 
number 
of trivalent 
PLANTED

the 
number 
of different

72 + 1 rows, the number 
of ways of forming 
an n-fold

A generalization 
of the Catalan 
numbers 
is defined 
by 
(10) 
for k > 
1 (Klarner 
1970, 
Hilton 
and 
Pederson 
1991). 
- 
The usual 
Catalan 
numbers 
ck = a& 
are a special 
case 
with p = 2. pdk gives the number 
of p-ary TREES with 
k 
source-nodes, 
the number 
of ways of associating 
k appli- 
cations 
of a given p-ary OPERATOR, the number 
of ways 
of dividing 
a convex 
POLYGON into 
k disjoint 
(p + l)- 
gons with nonintersecting 
DIAGONALS, and the number 
ofp-GOOD PATHS from 
(0, -1) 
to (k, (p-l)k-1) 
(Hilton 
and Pederson 
1991). 
A further 
generalization 
is obtained 
as follows. 
Let 
p 
be an INTEGER > 
1, let 
pk 
= 
(k, (p - 1)k - 1) with 
k > 0, and q < p - 1. Then 
define 
pdqO = 1 and let pd,k 
bethe 
number 
of ~-GOOD 
PATHS from 
(1, q - 1) to Pk 
(Hilton 
and Pederson 
1991). 
Formulas 
for pdqi include 
the generalized 
JONAH FORMULA 
(11) 
and the explicit 
formula 
p 
qk=- 
d 
A RECURRENCE 
RELATION

Catalan’s 
Problem 
The 
problem 
of finding 
the number 
of different 
ways in 
which a PRODUCT 
of n different 
ordered 
FACTORS 
can be 
calculated 
by pairs (i.e., the number 
of BINARY 
BRACK- 
ETINGS 
of n letters). 
For example, 
for the 
four 
FAC- 
TORS 
a, b, c, and H, there 
are five possibilities: 
((ab)c)d, 
(a(bc))d, 
(ab)(cd), 
u((bc)d), 
and 
u(b(cd)). 
The 
solution 
was given 
by Catalan 
in 1838 as

204 
Huygens 
was the first to use the term 
catenary 
in a letter 
to Leibniz 
in 1690, and David 
Gregory 
wrote 
a treatise 
on the catenary 
in 1690 (MacTutor 
Archive). 
If you roll 
a PARABOLA along 
a straight 
line, 
its Focus 
traces out 
a catenary. 
As proved 
by Euler 
in 1744, the catenary 
is 
also the curve which, 
when rotated, 
gives the surface of 
minimum 
SURFACE AREA (the 
CATENOID) 
for the given 
bounding 
CIRCLE. 
The 
CARTESIAN 
equation 
for the catenary 
is given 
by 
Category 
A category 
consists 
of two things: 
an OBJECT 
and 
a 
MORPHISM (sometimes 
called 
an 
“arrow”) 
l 
An 
OB- 
JECT 
is some 
mathematical 
structure 
(e.g., 
a GROUP, 
VECTOR 
SPACE, or DIFFERENTIABLEMANIFOLD) 
anda 
MORPHISM is a MAP betweentwo 
OBJECTS. The 
MOR- 
PHISMS are then 
required 
to satisfy 
some fairly 
natural 
conditions; 
for instance, 
the 
IDENTITY 
MAP 
between 
any object 
and 
itself 
is always 
a MORPHISM, 
and 
the 
composition 
of two MORPHISMS (if defined) 
is always 
a 
MORPHISM. 
y = ia(exia 
-+ Cxia) 
= acosh 
One 
usually 
requires 
the 
MORPHISMS 
to preserve 
the 
mathematical 
structure 
of the objects. 
So if the objects 
are all groups, 
a good choice 
for a MORPHISM would 
be 
a group 
HOMOMORPHISM. Similarly, 
for vector 
spaces, 
and the CES~RO 
EQUATION 
is 
(s2 + a2)bc = -a. 
The 
catenary 
gives the shape 
of the road 
over which 
a 
regular 
polygonal 
‘cwheel” 
can travel 
smoothly. 
For a 
one would 
choose 
linear 
maps, 
and 
for differentiable 
manifolds, 
one would 
choose differentiable 
maps. 
regular 
n-gon, 
the corresponding 
catenary 
is 
In the 
category 
of TOPOLOGICAL SPACES, homomor- 
phisms 
are usually 
continuous 
maps 
between 
topologi- 
cal spaces. 
However, 
there are also other 
category 
struc- 
tures having 
TOPOLOGICAL SPACES as objects, 
but they 
are not nearly 
as important 
as the “standard” 
category 
of TOPOLOGICAL SPACES and continuous 
maps.

Catenary 
The curve a hanging 
flexible 
wire or chain assumes 
when 
supported 
at its ends and acted upon 
by a uniform 
grav- 
itational 
force. 
The 
word catenary 
is derived 
from 
the 
Latin 
word 
for 
“chain.” 
In 
1669, 
Jungius 
disproved 
Galileo’s 
claim 
that 
the curve 
of a chain 
hanging 
un- 
der gravity 
would 
be a PARABOLA (MacTutor 
Archive). 
The 
curve 
is also called 
the ALYSOID and CHAINETTE. 
The 
equation 
was obtained 
by Leibniz, 
Huygens, 
and 
Johann 
Bernoulli 
in 1691 in response 
to a challenge 
by 
Jakob 
Bernoulli.

There 
are two 
completely 
different 
definitions 
of Cayley 
numbers. 
The 
first 
type 
Cayley 
numbers 
is one of the 
eight 
elements 
in a CAYLEY ALGEBRA, also known 
as 
an OCTONION. A typical 
Cayley 
number 
is of the form 
a + bio + cil + di2 + ei3 + f id + gi5 + his, 
where each of the triples 
(io, ii, is), (ii, 
i2, id), (& i3, is), 
(i3, id, is), 
(id, is, io), 
(is, is, il), 
(&, io, i2) behaves 
like 
the QUATERNIONS 
(i, j, k). 
Cayley 
numbers 
are not As- 
SOCIATIVE. 
They 
have been used in the study 
of 7- and 
8-D space, 
and a general 
rotation 
in 843 space can be 
written 
The 
second 
type 
of Cayley 
number 
is a quantity 
which 
describes 
a DEL PEZZO 
SWRFACE.

Cayley’s 
Sextic 
A plane 
curve discovered 
by Maclaurin 
but first studied 
in detail 
by Cayley. 
The 
name 
Cayley’s 
sextic 
is due 
to R. C. Archibald, 
who attempted 
to classify 
curves in 
a paper 
published 
in Strasbourg 
in 1900 (MacTutor 
Ar- 
chive).

sextic is given 
in POLAR

T = acos3($), 
(1) 
or 
T = 4bcos3(50), 
(2) 
where b E a/4. 
In the latter 
case, the CARTESIAN 
equa- 
tion 
is 
4(x2 +y2 
- i!~x)~ = 27a2(x2 
+y2)2.

The 
parametric 
equations 
are

y(t) 
= 4acos3(+t) 
sin( $).

Cellular 
Automaton 
A grid 
(possibly 
1-D) of cells which 
evolves 
according 
to 
a set of rules 
based 
on the states 
of surrounding 
cells. 
von Neumann 
was one of the 
first 
people 
to consider 
such a model, 
and 
incorporated 
a cellular 
model 
into 
his %niversal 
constructor.” 
von Neumann 
proved 
that 
an automaton 
consisting 
of cells with 
four 
orthogonal 
neighbors 
and 
29 possible 
states 
would 
be capable 
of 
simulating 
a TURING 
MACHINE 
for some 
configuration 
of about 
200,000 
cells (Gardner 
1983, pa 227). 
1-D automata 
are called 
“elementary” 
and 
are repre- 
sented 
by 
a row of pixels 
with 
states 
either 
0 or 1. 
These 
can be represented 
with 
an 8-bit 
binary 
num- 
ber, 
as shown 
by Stephen 
Wolfram. 
Wolfram 
further 
restricted 
the number 
from 
28 = 256 to 32 by requiring 
certain 
symmetry 
conditions. 
The 
most 
well-known 
cellular 
automaton 
is Conway’s 
game 
of LIFE, 
popularized 
in Martin 
Gardner’s 
Scien- 
tific 
American 
columns. 
Although 
the computation 
of 
successive 
LIFE generations 
was originally 
done by hand, 
, 
the computer 
revolution 
soon arrived 
and allowed 
more 
extensive 
patterns 
to be studied 
and propagated.

The

a TRIANGLE 
is the point 
M 
(or G) of intersection 
of 
the TRIANGLE’S

also called 
the MEDIAN 
POINT 
(Johnson 
1929, p. 249).

The 
TRIANGLES 
SXC, 
CXA,

IFF X corresponds

centroid. 
The 
centroid 
is located 
one third 
of the way 
from each VERTEX 
to the MIDPOINT 
of the opposite 
side. 
Each 
median 
divides 
the triangle 
into 
two equal 
areas; 
all the medians 
together 
divide 
it into 
six equal 
parts, 
and the lines from the MEDIAN 
POINT 
to the VERTICES 
divide 
the whole 
into 
three 
equivalent 
TRIANGLES. 
In 
general, 
for any line in the plane 
of a TRIANGLE 
ABC, 
d = ;(dA 
+ dB +dc), 
(4 
where d, dA, d B, and dc are the distances 
from 
the cen- 
troid 
and VERTICES 
to the line. 
A TRIANGLE 
will bal- 
ance at the centroid, 
and along 
any line passing 
through 
the centroid. 
The 
TRILINEAR 
POLAR 
of the centroid 
is 
called 
the LEMOINE 
AXIS. 
The 
PERPENDICULARS

are proportional

Let 
P be an

the VERTICES

AZ, and As, and 
the centroid 
M. 
Then 
m2+PA22+PA32

Theorem 
B 
Given 
a TRIANGLE with 
VERTICES A, B, 
and 
C and 
points 
along 
the sides D, E, and F, a NECESSARY 
and 
SUFFICIENT condition 
for the CEVIANS AD, 
BE, 
and 
CF 
to be CONCURRENT (intersect 
in a single 
point) 
is 
that 
BDXEaAF=DC.EA*FB. 
(1) 
Let 
P = [V-,..., 
Vn] be an arbitrary 
n-gon, 
C a given 
point, 
and k a POSITIVE INTEGER such that 
1 5 Iz 2 
n/2, 
For i = 1, . . . , n, let Wi be the intersection 
of the

CVi and Vi-&+k, 
then 
f&+1. 
i=l

Here, 
ABlICD

AB [ 1

(3) 
is the RATIO of the lengths 
[A, B] and [C, D] with a plus 
or minus 
sign depending 
on whether 
these segments 
have 
the same or opposite 
directions 
(Griinbaum 
and Shepard 
1995). 
Another 
form of the theorem 
is that 
three 
CONCURRENT 
lines 
from 
the VERTICES 
of a TRIANGLE 
divide 
the op- 
posite 
sides in such fashion 
that 
the product 
of three

equals 
the product 
of the other 
three 
(Johnson

Change

Theorem 
A theorem 
which 
effectively 
describes 
how lengths, 
ar- 
eas, volumes, 
and 
generalized 
n-dimensional 
volumes 
(CONTENTS) 
are distorted 
by DIFFERENTIABLE 
FUNC- 
TIONS. 
In particular, 
the change 
of variables 
theorem 
reduces 
the whole problem 
of figuring 
out the distortion 
of the 
content 
to understanding 
the 
infinitesimal 
dis- 
tortion, 
i.e., the distortion 
of the DERIVATIVE 
(a linear 
MAP), 
which 
is given 
by the 
linear 
MAP'S 
DETERMI- 
NANT. 
So f : R" 
+ 
R" 
is an AREA-PRESERVING 
linear 
MAP 
IFF 
Idet(f)l 
= 1, and in more 
generality, 
if S is 
any subset 
of Iw”, the CONTENT 
of its image 
is given 
by 
1 det( f) 1 times 
the CONTENT 
of the original. 
The change 
of variables 
theorem 
takes 
this 
infinitesimal 
knowledge, 
and applies 
CALCULUS 
by breaking 
up the DOMAIN 
into 
small 
pieces 
and adds 
up the 
change 
in AREA, 
bit 
by 
bit. 
The 
change 
of variable 
formula 
persists 
to the general- 
ity of DIFFERENTIAL 
FORMS 
on MANIFOLDS, 
giving 
the 
formula 
under 
the conditions 
that 
M 
and W are compact 
con- 
nected 
oriented 
MANIFOLDS 
with 
nonempty 
boundaries, 
f : M 
+ 
W is a smooth 
map 
which 
is an orientation- 
preserving 
DIFFEOMORPHISM 
of the boundaries. 
In 2-D, the explicit 
statement 
of the theorem 
is 
s f (x, 
Y> dXdY 
R 
and in 3-D, it is 
where R = f (R*) 
is th e image 
of the original 
region 
R*, 
is the JACOBIAN, 
and f is a global 
orientation-preserving 
DIFFEOMORPHISM 
of R and R* (which 
are open subsets 
of P). 
The change 
of variables 
theorem 
is a simple 
consequence 
of the CURL THEOREM 
and a little 
DE RHAM 
COHOMOL- 
OGY. 
The 
generalization 
to n-D 
requires 
no additional 
assumptions 
other 
than 
the regularity 
conditions 
on the 
boundary.

Chaos 
A DYNAMICAL 
SYSTEM 
is chaotic 
if it 
1. Has a DENSE 
collection 
of 
bits, 
points 
with 
periodic 
or- 
2. Is sensitive 
to the initial 
condition 
of the system 
(so 
that 
initially 
nearby 
points 
can evolve 
quickly 
into 
very different 
states), 
and 
3. IS TOPOLOGICALLY 
TRANSITIVE. 
Chaotic 
systems 
exhibit 
irregular, 
unpredictable 
behav- 
ior (the 
BUTTERFLY 
EFFECT). 
The 
boundary 
between 
linear 
and chaotic 
behavior 
is characterized 
by PERIOD 
DOUBLING, 
following 
by quadrupling, 
etc. 
An example 
of a simple 
physical 
system 
which 
displays 
chaotic 
behavior 
is the motion 
of a magnetic 
pendulum 
over a plane 
containing 
two or more 
attractive 
magnets. 
The magnet 
over which 
the pendulum 
ultimately 
comes 
to rest (due to frictional 
damping) 
is highly 
dependent 
on the starting 
position 
and velocity 
of the pendulum 
(Dickau). 
Another 
such system 
is a double 
pendulum 
(a 
pendulum 
with 
another 
pendulum 
attached 
to its end).

Chaos 
Game 
Pick 
a point 
at random 
inside 
a regular 
n-gon. 
Then 
draw the next point 
a fraction 
T of the distance 
between 
it and a VERTEX picked 
at random. 
Continue 
the pro- 
cess (after 
throwing 
out the first few points). 
The result 
of this 
“chaos 
game” 
is sometimes, 
but 
not 
always, 
a 
FRACTAL. 
The 
case (n, T) = (4,1/2) 
gives the interior 
of a SQUARE 
with

visited 
with equal

Character 
(Group) 
The GROUP THEORY 
term 
for what 
is known 
to physi- 
cists as the TRACE. All 
members 
of the same CONJU- 
GACY CLASS in the same representation 
have the same 
character. 
Members 
of other CONJUGACY CLASSES may 
also have the same 
character, 
however. 
An (abstract) 
GROUP 
can be uniquely 
identified 
by a listing 
of the 
characters 
of its 
various 
representations, 
known 
as a 
CHARACTER TABLE. 
Some 
of the SCH~NFLIES SYM- 
BOLS denote 
different 
sets of symmetry 
operations 
but 
correspond 
to the same abstract 
GROUP and so have the 
same CHARACTER TABLES. 
Character 
(Multiplicative) 
A continuous 
HOMEOMORPHISM of a GROUP into 
the 
NONZERO COMPLEX NUMBERS. A multiplicative 
char- 
acter w gives a REPRESENTATION on the 1-D SPACE c 
of COMPLEX NUMBERS, wherethe 
REPRESENTATION ac- 
tion by g E G is multiplication 
by w(g). 
A multiplicative 
character 
is UNITARY ifit 
has ABSOLUTE VALUE 1 ev- 
erywhere.

of the TOTIENT

such 
that 
the product 
of characteristic

the characteristic

any 
ABELIAN GROUP can be expressed 
as a DIRECT PROD-

For a FIELD K with 
multiplicative 
identity

the numbers 
2 = 1+ 
1, 3 =1+1+1,4=1+1+1+1, 
etc. 
Either 
these 
numbers 
are all 
different, 
in which 
case we say that 
K has characteristic 
0, or two of them 
will be equal. 
In this case, it is straightforward 
to show 
that, 
for some number 
p, we have t + 1 $,. . . + l, = 0. 
p times 
If p is chosen 
to be as small 
as possible, 
then 
p will 
be a PRIME, and 
we say that 
K 
has characteristic 
II. 
The 
FIELDS Q, R, c, and 
the p-ADIC NUMBERS Qp 
have characteristic

Chasles’s 
Theorem

CONSTANT, 
RATIONAL 
FUNCTION 
If two projective 
PENCILS 
of curves 
of orders 
12 and n’ 
have no common 
curve, the LOCUS of the intersections 
of 
corresponding 
curves of the two is a curve of order n+n’ 
through 
all the centers 
of either 
PENCIL. 
Conversely, 
if 
a curve of order 
n + n’ contains 
all centers 
of a PENCIL 
of order 
n to the multiplicity 
demanded 
by NOETHER’s 
FUNDAMENTAL 
THEOREM, 
then 
it is the Locus 
of the 
intersections 
of corresponding 
curves of this PENCIL 
and 
one of order 
n’ projective 
therewith.

Chebyshev

A GAUSSIAN 
QUADRATURE-like 
FORMULA for numeri- 
cal estimation 
of integrals. 
It uses WEIGHTING FWNC- 
TION w(z)

to be equal. 
The

FORMULA is

Because 
the ROOTS are all 
REAL 
for n < 7 and n = 9

Beeler 
et al. (1972, 
Item 
93) estimated 
that 
there 
are 
about 
101’ 
possible

However, 
this 
disagrees 
with 
the estimate 
of Jon Schaeffer 
of 5 x 10zO plausible 
positions, 
with 
1018 reachable 
under 
the 
rules 
of the 
game. 
Because 
“solving” 
checkers 
may require 
only 
the 
SQUARE 
ROOT 
of the number 
of positions 
in the search 
space (i.e., 
lo’), 
so there 
is hope that 
some day checkers 
may 
be solved 
(i.e., 
it may 
be possible 
to guarantee 
a 
win for the first player 
to move 
before 
the game 
is even 
started; 
Dubuque

Depending 
on how they 
are counted,

of EU-

are either

Checksum 
A sum of the digits 
in a given transmission 
modulo 
some 
number. 
The 
simplest 
form 
of checksum 
is a parity 
bit 
appended 
on to 7-bit 
numbers 
(e.g., ASCII 
characters) 
such that 
the total 
number 
of 1s is always 
EVEN 
(“even 
parity”) 
or ODD 
(“odd 
parity”). 
A significantly 
more 
sophisticated 
checksum 
is the 
CYCLIC 
REDUNDANCY 
CHECK 
(or CRC), 
which is based on the algebra 
of poly- 
nomials 
over the integers 
(mod 
2). 
It 
is substantially 
more 
reliable 
in detecting 
transmission 
errors, 
and 
is 
one common 
error-checking 
protocol 
used in modems.

For any collection

Chess 
Chess is a game played 
on an 8x 8 board, 
called 
a CHESS- 
BOARD, 
of alternating 
black 
and white 
squares. 
Pieces 
with 
different 
types 
of allowed 
moves 
are placed 
on the 
board, 
a set of black 
pieces 
in the first 
two rows and 
a set of white 
pieces 
in the last 
two rows. 
The 
pieces 
are called 
the bishop 
(2)) king 
(l), 
knight 
(Z), pawn 
(8), 
queen 
(l), 
and rook 
(2). 
The 
object 
of the game 
is to 
capt we the opponent’s 
king. 
It is believed 
that 
chess 
was played 
in India 
as early 
as the sixth 
century 
AD. 
In a game 
of 40 moves, 
the number 
of possible 
board 
positions 
is at least 
10120 according 
to Peterson 
(1996) 
l 
However, 
this 
value 
does not 
agree with 
the 104’ 
pos- 
sible 
positions 
given 
by Beeler 
et al. (1972, 
Item 
95). 
This 
value 
was obtained 
by estimating 
the number 
of 
pawn positions 
(in the no-captures 
situation, 
this is 158), 
times 
all pieces 
in all positions, 
dividing 
by 2 for each 
of the 
(rook, 
knight) 
which 
are interchangeable, 
divid- 
ing by 2 for each pair 
of bishops 
(since 
half 
the posi- 
tions 
will 
have the bishops 
on the same color 
squares). 
There 
are more positions 
with one or two captures, 
since 
the pawns can then 
switch 
columns 
(Schroeppel 
1996). 
Shannon 
(1950) 
gave the value 
64! 
p(4o) 
= 32!(8!)2(2!)6 
= 1043m 
The number 
of chess games 
which end in exactly 
n plies 
(including 
games 
that 
mate 
in fewer than 
n plies) 
for 
n = 
1, 2, 3, . - - are 20, 400, 
8902, 
197742, 
4897256, 
119060679, 
3195913043, 
. . . (K. 
Thompson, 
Sloane’s 
AOO7545). 
Rex 
Stout’s 
fictional 
detective 
Nero 
Wolfe 
quotes 
the number 
of possible 
games 
after ten moves as 
follows: 
“Wolfe 
grunted. 
One 
hundred 
and sixty-nine 
million, 
five hundred 
and eighteen 
thousand, 
eight 
hun- 
dred 
and 
twenty-nine 
followed 
by twenty-one 
ciphers. 
The 
number 
of ways the 
first 
ten 
moves, 
both 
sides, 
may 
be played” 
(Stout 
1983). 
The 
number 
of chess 
positions 
after 
n moves 
for n = 1, 2, 
l , . are 20, 400, 
5362, 71852, 
809896?, 
9132484?, 
. . . (Schwarzkopf 
1994, 
Sloane’s 
AO19319). 
Cunningham 
(1889) 
incorrectly 
found 
197,299 
games 
and 
71,782 
positions 
after 
the 
fourth 
move. 
C. Flye 
St. Marie 
was the first to find the correct 
number 
of po- 
sitions 
after 
four 
moves: 
71,852. 
Dawson 
(1946) 
gives 
the source 
as Intermediare 
des Mathematiques 
(1895), 
but 
K. Fabel 
writes 
that 
Flye 
St. Marie 
corrected 
the 
number 
71,870 
(which 
he found 
in 1895) 
to 71,852 
in 
1903. 
The history 
of the determination 
of the chess se- 
quences 
is discussed 
in Schwarzkopf 
(1994). 
Two problems 
in recreational 
mathematics 
ask 
1. How many 
pieces 
of a given 
type 
can be placed 
on a 
CHESSBOARD 
without 
any two attacking. 
2. What 
is the smallest 
number 
of pieces needed 
to oc- 
cupy or attack 
every square.

answers are given

Chessboard 
A board 
containing 
8 x 8 squares 
alternating 
in color 
between 
black 
and white 
on which the game of CHESS is 
played. 
The 
checkerboard 
is identical 
to the chessboard 
except 
that 
chess’s black 
and white 
squares 
are colored 
red and white 
in CHECKERS. 
It is impossible 
to cover a 
chessboard 
from 
which 
two opposite 
corners 
have been 
removed 
with 
DOMINOES.

There

When

x2, 
the

Hypothesis 
A PRIME p always 
satisfies 
the 
condition 
that 
2p - 2 
is divisible 
by p. 
However, 
this 
condition 
is not 
true 
exckusively 
for PRIME 
(e.g., 2341 - 2 is divisible 
by 341 = 
11-31). 
COMPOSITE 
NUMBERS 
n (such as 341) for which 
2n - 2 is divisible 
by n are called 
POULET NUMBERS, 
and are a special 
class of FERMAT PSEUDOPRIMES. The 
Chinese 
hypothesis 
is a special 
case of FERMAT'S LITTLE 
THEOREM.

Chow 
Coordinates 
A generalization 
of GRASSMANN COORDINATES to m-D 
varieties 
of degree 
d in P”, 
where Pn is an n-D 
pro- 
jective 
space. 
To 
define 
the 
Chow 
coordinates, 
take 
the 
intersection 
of a m-D 
VARIETY 2 of degree 
d by 
an (n - m)-I3 SUBSPACE U of Pn. 
Then 
the 
coordi- 
nates 
of the 
d points 
of intersection 
are algebraic 
func- 
tions 
of the GRASSMANN COORDINATES of U, and by 
taking 
a symmetric 
function 
of the algebraic 
functions, 
a hHOMOGENEous 
POLYNOMIAL known as the Chow 
form 
of 2 is obtained. 
The 
Chow 
coordinates 
are then 

244 
Chow Ring 
the COEFFICIENTS 
of the Chow form. 
Chow coordinates 
can generate 
the smallest 
field of definition 
of a divisor.

Circle 
A circle 
is the 
set of points 
equidistant 
from 
a given 
point 
0. 
The 
distance 
T from 
the CENTER 
is called 
the 
RADIUS, 
and the point 
0 is called 
the CENTER. Twice 
the RADIUS is known 
as the DIAMETER d = 2~. 
The 
PERIMETER C of a circle is called 
the CIRCUMFERENCE, 
and is given 
by 
C = rd = 27~. 
(1) 
The circle is a CONIC SECTION obtained 
by the intersec- 
tion 
of a CONE with 
a PLANE PERPENDICULAR to the 
CONE’S 
symmetry 
axis. 
A circle 
is the degenerate 
case 
of an ELLIPSE with equal 
semimajor 
and semiminor 
axes 
(i.e., with ECCENTRICITY 
0). The 
interior 
of a circle 
is 
called 
a DISK. The 
generalization 
of a circle 
to 3-D 
is 
called 
a SPHERE, and to n-D for n 2 4 a HYPERSPHERE. 
The region 
of intersection 
of two circles is called 
a LENS. 
The region 
of intersection 
of three 
symmetrically 
placed 
circles 
(as in a VENN 
DIAGRAM), in the special 
case of 
the center 
of each being 
located 
at the intersection 
of 
the other 
two, is called 
a REULEAUX TRIANGLE. 
The parametric 
equations 
for a circle 
of RADIUS 
a are 
x = acost 
(2) 
y = asin t. 
(3) 
For a body 
moving 
uniformly 
around 
the circle, 
x1 = -asint 
y’ = acost,

and 
xl1 = -acost

y" = -a sin t.

When 
normalized, 
the former 
gives the equation 
for the

In POLAR COORDINATES, the equation

form. 
r=a

of RADIUS a centered

Four or more 
points 
which 
lie on a circle 
are said to be 
CONCYCLIC. 
Three 
points 
are trivially 
concyclic 
since 
three 
noncollinear 
points 
determine 
a circle. 
The CIRCUMFERENCE-to-DIAMETER 
ratio 
C/d 
for a cir- 
cle is constant 
as the size of the 
circle 
is changed 
(as 
it must 
be since scaling 
a plane 
figure 
by a factor 
s in- 
creases its PERIMETER 
by s), and d also scales by s. This 
ratio 
is denoted 
7r (PI), 
and has been proved 
TRANSCEN- 
DENTAL. 
With 
d the DIAMETER 
and T the RADIUS, 
(x - xo)2 + (y - ya)2 = u2*

In PEDAL

geometrically 
or using

This

Circle 
Lattice 
Points 
For every 
POSITIVE 
INTEGER 
n, there 
exists 
a CIRCLE 
which 
contains 
exactly 
n lattice 
points 
in its interior. 
H. Steinhaus 
proved 
that 
for every 
POSITIVE 
INTEGER 
n, there 
exists 
a CIRCLE 
of AREA 
n which 
contains 
ex- 
actly 
n lattice 
points 
in its interior. 
SCHINZEL’S 
THEOREM 
shows that 
for every 
POSITIVE 
INTEGER 
n, there 
exists 
a CIRCLE 
in the 
PLANE 
hav- 
ing exactly 
n LATTICE 
POINTS 
on its CIRCUMFERENCE. 
The 
theorem 
also explicitly 
identifies 
such 
~CHINZEL 
CIRCLES” 
as 
(x - 
$>” + y2 = $“-’ 
for n = 2k 
( X- 
;)‘+IJ~=;~~’ 
forn.=2k+l. 
(I) 
Note, 
however, 
that 
these 
solutions 
do not necessarily 
have the smallest 
possible 
RADIUS. 
For example, 
while 
the 
SCHINZEL 
CIRCLE 
centered 
at 
(l/3, 
0) and 
with 
RADIUS 
625/3 
has nine 
lattice 
points 
on its 
CIRCUM- 
FERENCE, 
so does the CIRCLE 
centered 
at (l/3, 
0) with 
RADIUS 
65/3. 
Let T be the smallest 
INTEGER 
RADIUS 
of a CIRCLE 
cen- 
tered 
at the ORIGIN 
(0, 0) with 
L(r) 
LATTICE 
POINTS. 
In order 
to find the number 
of lattice 
points 
of the CIR- 
CLE, it is only 
necessary 
to find the number 
in the first 
octant, 
i.e., those with 0 5 y 5 Lr/fi], 
where 
[zj is the 
FLOOR 
FUNCTION. 
Calling 
this 
N(T), 
then 
for 
T 
2 
I, 
L(T) 
= IN 
- 4, so L(r) 
E 4 (mod 
8). The 
multiph- 
cation 
by eight 
counts 
all octants, 
and the subtraction 
by four eliminates 
points 
on the axes which 
the multi- 
plication 
counts 
twice. 
(Since 
1/2 is IRRATIONAL, 
the 
MIDPOINT 
of a are is never 
a LATTICE 
POINT.)

Gauss proved 
that 
the hexagonal 
lattice 
is the densest

and in 1940, L. Fejes T6th 
proved 
that 
the hexagonal

of all 
possible

There

These 
are all touched 
by the CIRCLE 
through 
the

of 
the TRIANGLE, 
known 
as the NINE-POINT 
CIRCLE. 
Given 
the above 
figure, 
GE 
= FH, 
since 
AB=AG+GB=GE+GF=GEf(GE+EF) 
=2G+EF 
CD=CH+HD=EH+FH=FH+(FH+EF) 
= EF 
+ 2FH. 
Because 
AB = CD, 
it follows 
that 
GE 
= FH.

It can

If the TRIANGLE is ACUTE, the circumcenter 
is in the interior 
of the TRIANGLE. 
In a RIGHT 
TRI-

is the 
MIDPOINT 
of the

Oi 
are the MIDPOINTS

Ai, 
R is the 
CIRCUMRADIUS, and 
T is the INRADIUS (Johnson 
1929, 
pa 190). 
The TRILINEAR COORDINATES of the circum- 
center 
are 
cosA: 
COSB : cosC,

and the exact 
trilinears 
are therefore 
RcosA

The AREAL COORDINATES are

The 
distance 
between 
the INCENTER and circumcenter 
is @(R

Given 
an interior 
point, 
the distances

are equal 
IFF this point 
is the circum-

Cissoid 
of Diocles 
A curve 
invented 
by Diocles 
in ibout 
180 BC in con- 
nection 
with 
his attempt 
to duplicate 
the cube by geo- 
metrical 
methods. 
The 
name 
Vissoid” 
first appears 
in 
the work of Geminus 
about 
100 years later. 
Fermat 
and 
Roberval 
constructed 
the tangent 
in 1634. 
Huygens 
and 
Wallis 
found, 
in 1658, that 
the AREA 
between 
the curve 
and its asymptote 
was 3a (MacTutor 
Archive). 
From 
a 
given 
point 
there 
are either 
one or three 
TANGENTS 
to 
the cissoid. 
Given 
an origin 
0 and a point 
P on the curve, 
let S be 
the point 
where the extension 
of the line OP 
intersects 
the line x = 2a and R be the intersection 
of the CIRCLE 
of RADIUS 
a and center 
(a, 0) with 
the extension 
of OP. 
Then 
the cissoid 
of Diocles 
is the curve 
which 
satisfies 
OP 
= RS. 

Cissoid

The cissoid 
of Diocles is the ROULETTE of the VERTEX 
of a PARABOLA 
rolling 
on an equal PARABOLA. Newton 
gave a method 
of drawing 
the cissoid 
of Diocles 
using 
two line segments 
of equal 
length 
at RIGHT ANGLES. If 
they are moved 
so that 
one line always passes through 
a 
fixed point 
and the end of the other 
line 
segment 
slides 
along 
a straight 
line, 
then 
the MIDPOINT 
of the sliding 
line segment 
traces 
out a cissoid 
of Diocles. 
The 
cissoid 
of Diocles 
is given 
by the parametric 
equa- 
t ions 
x = 2asin2 
0

y=-

(2) 
Converting 
these to POLAR COORDINATES gives 
r2 = x2 + y2 = 4a2 ( 
sin6 8 
sin4 0 + - ~0~2 e > 
= 4a2 sin4 ep + tan2 0) = 4a2 sin4 Osec2 0, 
(3) 
so 
T = 2asin2

= 2asinOtanO.

Clark’s

Class Number 
A NUMBER TRIANGLE created 
by setting 
the 
VERTEX 
equal 
to 0, filling 
one diagonal 
with 
Is, the other 
diag- 
onal 
with 
multiples 
of an INTEGER f, and filling 
in the 
remaining 
entries 
by summing 
the elements 
on either 
side from 
one row above. 
Call 
the first 
column 
n = 0 
and the last column 
vz = n so that 
c(m, 
0) = fm 
(1) 
c(m,m) 
= 1, 
(2) 
then use the RECURRENCE RELATION 
c(m, 
n) = c(m 
- 
1, n - 1) + c(m 
- 
1, n) 
(3) 
to compute 
the rest of the entries. 
For n = 1, we have 
c(m, 
1) = c(m 
- 1,O) + c(m 
- 1, 1) 
(4) 
c(m, 1) - c(m 
- 1,1) 
= c(m - 1,O) = f(m 
- 1).

For arbitrary 
m, 
the value 
can be computed 
by SUM- 
MING this RECURRENCE, 
c(m,

Now, for n = 2 we have

But 
the amazing

is that 
if f = 6 is chosen 
as the

then 
c(m,

c(m, 3) simplify 
to

For any IDEAL I, there

is a measure

A finite

Then 
the class number 
h(d) 
for DISCRIMINANT

the number

Here, 
the factors 
are 
of the form

to 
IMAGINARY QUADRATIC 
FIELDS Q(J-do) 
having 
small 
class numbers 
h( -d) 
are given 
in the table 
below. 
In the table, 
Iv is the number 
of “fundamental” 
values 
of -d 
with 
a given 
class number 
h(-d), 
where 
“funda- 
mental” 
means 
that 
-d 
is not divisible 
by any SQUARE 
NUMBER s2 such that 
h(-d/s2) 
< h(-d). 
For example, 
although 
h( -63) 
= 2, -63 
is not 
a fundamental 
dis- 
criminant 
since 63 = 32 
l 7 and h(-63/32) 
= h(-7) 
= 
1 < h(-63). 
EVEN values 
8 5 h(-d) 
5 18 have been 
computed 
by Weisstein. 
The 
number 
of negative 
dis- 
criminants 
having 
class number 
1, 2, 3, . . . are 9, 18, 
16, 54, 25, 51, 31, . . . (Sloane’s 
A046125). 
The 
largest 
negative 
discriminants 
having 
class numbers 
1, 2, 3, . l . 
are 163, 427, 907, 1555, 2683, 
. . . (Sloane’s 
A038552).

Class 
Number 
Formula 
A class number 
formula 
is a finite 
series giving 
exactly 
the CLASS NUMBER 
ofa RING. 
For a RING 
ofquadratic 
integers, 
the class number 
is denoted 
h(d), where d is the 
discriminant. 
A class number 
formula 
is known 
for the 
full ring of cyclotomic 
integers, 
as well as for any subring 
of the 
cyclotomic 
integers. 
This 
formula 
includes 
the 
quadratic 
case as well as 
rings.

Class

A set of class representatives 
is a SUBSET 
of X which 
contains 
exactly 
one element 
from 
each EQUIVALENCE 
CLASS. 
Class 
(Set) 
A class is a special 
kind 
of SET invented 
to get around 
RUSSELL'S PARADOX while 
retaining 
the arbitrary 
cri- 
teria 
for membership 
which 
leads to difficulty 
for SETS. 
The 
members 
of classes are SETS, 
but 
it is possible 
to 
have the class C of “all 
SETS which 
are not members 
of 
themselves” 
without 
producing 
a paradox 
(since C is a 
proper 
class (and 
not a SET), 
it is not a candidate 
for 
membership 
in C).

The 
classification 
of a collection 
of objects 
generally 
means 
that 
a list has been constructed 
with exactly 
one 
member 
from 
each IS~M~RPHISM 
type 
among 
the ob- 
jects, 
and 
that 
tools 
and techniques 
can effectively 
be 
used to identify 
any combinatorially 
given 
object 
with 
its unique 
representative 
in the list.

CLEAN 
Algorithm 
An iterative 
algorithm 
which DECONVOLVES a sampling 
function 
(the “DIRTY BEAM") from 
an observed 
bright- 
ness ("DIRTY 
MAP") of a radio 
source. 
This 
algorithm 
is of fundamental 
importance 
in radio 
astronomy, 
where 
it is used to create 
images 
of astronomical 
sources which 
are observed 
using arrays 
of radio 
telescopes 
(“synthesis 
imaging”). 
As a result 
of the algorithm’s 
importance 
to 
synthesis 
imaging, 
a great 
deal 
of effort 
has gone into 
optimizing 
and adjusting 
the ALGORITHM. 
CLEAN 
is a 
nonlinear 
algorithm, 
since linear 
DECONVOLUTION algo- 
rithms 
such as WIENER FILTERING and inverse 
filtering 

CLEAN 
Algorithm 
CLEAN 
Algorithm 
are inapplicable 
to applications 
with 
invisible 
distribu- 
tions 
(i.e., incomplete 
sampling 
of the spatial 
frequency 
plane) 
such as map 
obtained 
in synthesis 
imaging. 
The 
basic 
CLEAN 
method 
was developed 
by Hiigbom 
(1974). 
It was originally 
designed 
for point 
sources, 
but 
it has been 
found 
to work 
well 
for extended 
sources 
as well when 
given 
a reasonable 
starting 
model. 
The 
Hijgbom 
CLEAN 
constructs 
discrete 
approximations 
171 
to the CLEAN 
MAP 
in the 
(<,r]) 
plane 
from 
the CON- 
VOLWTION 
equation 
b’ * I = I’, 
(1) 
where b’ is the DIRTY 
BEAM, 
I’ is the DIRTY 
MAP 
(both 
in the (c, 77) PLANE), 
and f*g 
denotes 
a CONVOLUTION. 
The 
CLEAN 
algorithm 
starts 
with 
an initial 
approxi- 
mation 
10 = 0. At the nth iteration, 
it then 
searches for 
the largest 
value 
in the residual 
map 
A DELTA 
FUNCTION 
is then 
centered 
at the location 
of 
the largest 
residual 
flux and given 
an amplitude 
p (the 
so-called 
“LOOP 
GAIN”) 
times 
this value. 
An antenna’s 
responsetothe 
DELTA 
FUNCTION, 
the DIRTY 
BEAM, 
is 
then 
subtracted 
from 
In-1 
to yield 
In. 
Iteration 
con- 
tinues 
until 
a specified 
iteration 
limit 
2v is reached, 
or 
until 
the peak 
residual 
or ROOT-MEAN-SQUARE 
resid- 
ual decreases 
to some 
level. 
The 
resulting 
final 
map 
is 
denoted 
1~, and the position 
of each DELTA 
FUNCTION 
is saved in a “CLEAN 
component” 
table 
in the CLEAN 
MAP 
file. 
At the point 
where component 
subtraction 
is 
stopped, 
it is assumed 
that 
the residual 
brightness 
dis- 
tribution 
consists 
mainly 
of NOISE. 
To diminish 
high 
spatial 
frequency 
features 
which 
may 
be spuriously 
extrapolated 
from 
the 
measured 
data, 
each CLEAN 
component 
is convolved 
with 
the so-called 
CLEAN 
BEAM 
b, which 
is simply 
a suitably 
smoothed 
version 
of the sampling 
function 
( WIRTY 
BEAM”). 
Usu- 
ally, a GAUSSIAN 
is used. 
A good 
CLEAN 
BEAM 
should: 
1. Have a unity 
FOURIER 
TRANSFORM 
inside 
the 
pled region 
of (u, V) space, 
sam- 
2. Have a FOURIER 
TRANSFORM 
which tends 
to 0 out- 
side the sampled 
(u, V) region 
as quickly 
as possible, 
and 
3. Not 
have any effects produced 
by NEGATIVE 
side- 
lobes larger 
than 
the NOISE 
level. 
A CLEAN 
MAP 
is produced 
when 
the final 
map 
is added 
to the the approximate 
solution, 
residual 
[clean 
map] 
= 1~ * b + [I’ - b’ * 1~1 
(3) 
in order 
to include 
the NOISE. 
CLEAN 
will always converge 
to one (of possibly 
many) 
solutions 
if the following 
three 
conditions 
are satisfied 
(Schwarz 
1978): 
267 
1. The 
beam 
must 
be symmetric. 
2. The 
FOURIER 
TRANSFORM 
of the 
DIRTY 
BEAM 
is 
NONNEGATIVE 
(positive 
definite 
or positive 
semidef- 
init e) . 
3. There 
must 
dirty 
image 
BEAM. 
be no spatial 
frequencies 
present 
which 
are not also present 
in the 
in the 
DIRTY 
These 
conditions 
are almost 
always satisfied 
in practice. 
If the number 
of CLEAN 
components 
does not exceed 
the number 
of independent 
(u, V) points, 
CLEAN 
con- 
verges to a solution 
which 
is the least 
squares 
fit of the 
FOUIIIER 
TRANSFORMS 
of the 
DELTA 
FUNCTION 
com- 
ponents 
to the 
measured 
visibility 
(Thompson 
et al. 
1986, 
p. 347). 
Schwarz 
claims 
that 
the 
CLEAN 
algo- 
rithm 
is equivalent 
to a least 
squares 
fitting 
of cosine 
and sine parts 
in the 
(u, u) plane 
of the visibility 
data. 
Schwab 
has produced 
a NOISE 
analysis 
of the CLEAN 
algorithm 
in the 
case of least 
squares 
minimization 
of 
a noiseless 
image 
which 
involves 
an Iv x A4 MATRIX. 
However, 
no NOISE 
analysis 
has been performed 
for a 
REAL 
image. 
Poor 
modulation 
of short 
spacings 
results 
in an under- 
estimation 
of the flux, 
which 
is manifested 
in a bowl of 
negative 
surface 
brightness 
surrounding 
an object. 
Pro- 
viding 
an estimate 
of the 
“zero 
spacing” 
flux 
(the to- 
tal 
flux 
of the 
source, 
which 
cannot 
be directly 
mea- 
sured 
by 
an interferometer) 
can 
considerably 
reduce 
this 
effect. 
Modulations 
or stripes 
can occur 
at spa- 
tial 
frequencies 
corresponding 
to undersampled 
parts 
of the 
(U,ZI) 
plane. 
This 
can result 
in a golf ball-like 
mottling 
for disk 
sources 
such as planets, 
or a corru- 
gated 
pattern 
of parallel 
lines 
of peaks 
and 
troughs 
(“stripes”). 
A more 
accurate 
model 
can be used to sup- 
press the 
“golf 
ball” 
modulations, 
but 
may 
not 
elimi- 
nate 
the corrugations. 
A tapering 
function 
which 
de- 
emphasizes 
data 
near 
(u, V) = 
(0,O) 
can also be used. 
Stripes 
can sometimes 
be eliminated 
using 
the Cornwell 
smoothness-stabilized 
CLEAN 
(a-k-a. 
Prussian 
helmet 
algorithm; 
Thompson 
et al. 1986). 
CLEANing 
part way, 
then restarting 
the CLEAN 
also seems to eliminate 
the 
stripes, 
although 
this fact is more 
disturbing 
than 
reas- 
suring. 
Stability 
the the CLEAN 
algorithm 
is discussed 
by Tan 
(1986). 
In order to CLEAN 
a map of a given dimension, 
it is nec- 
essary to have a beam 
pattern 
twice as large 
so a point 
source 
can be subtracted 
from 
any point 
in the map. 
Because 
the CLEAN 
algorithm 
uses a FAST 
FOURIER 
TRANSFORM, 
the size must 
also be a POWER 
of 2. 
There 
are many 
variants 
of the basic Hijgbom 
CLEAN 
which 
extend 
the method 
to achieve 
greater 
speed and 
produce 
more 
realistic 
maps. 
Alternate 
nonlinear 
DE- 
CONVOLUTION 
methods, 
such 
as the 
MAXIMUM 
EN- 
TROPY 
METHOD, 
may 
also 
be used, 
but 
are gener- 
ally 
slower 
than 
the 
CLEAN 
technique.

nomical

CLEAN 
Algorithm 
CLEAN 
Algorithm 
DECONVOLUTION algorithms 
in the 
tasks 
DCONV and 
UVMAP. Among 
the variants 
of the basic Hijgbom 
CLEAN 
are 
Clark, 
Cornwell 
smoothness 
stabilized 
(Prussian 
helmet), 
Cotton-Schwab, 
Gerchberg-Saxton 
(Fienup), 
Steer, 
Steer-Dewdney-Ito, 
and van Cittert 
iteration. 
In the Clark 
(1980) 
modification, 
CLEAN 
picks out only 
the largest 
residual 
points, 
and subtracts 
approximate 
point 
source 
responses 
in the (S, q) plane 
during 
minor 
(Hiigbom 
CLEAN) 
cycles. 
It 
only 
occasionally 
(dur- 
ing major 
cycles) 
computes 
the full 1n residual 
map 
by 
subtracting 
the identified 
point 
source 
responses 
in the 
(u, W) plane 
using 
a FAST FOURIER TRANSFORM for the 
CONVOLUTION. The ALGORITHM then 
returns 
to a mi- 
nor cycle. 
This 
algorithm 
modifies 
the Hiigbom 
method 
to take advantage 
of the array processor 
(although 
it also 
works without 
one). 
It is therefore 
a factor 
of Z-10 faster 
than 
the simple 
Hijgbom 
routine. 
It is implemented 
as 
the AIPS 
task APCLN. 
The 
Cornwell 
smoothness 
stabilized 
variant 
was devel- 
oped 
because, 
when 
dealing 
with 
two-dimensional 
ex- 
tended 
structures, 
CLEAN 
can produce 
artifacts 
in the 
form 
of low-level 
high 
frequency 
stripes 
running 
through 
the brighter 
structure. 
These 
stripes 
derive 
from 
poor 
interpolations 
into 
unsampled 
or poorly 
sampled 
re- 
gions 
of the (u, ti) plane. 
When 
dealing 
with 
quasi-one- 
dimensional 
sources 
(i.e., 
jets), 
the 
artifacts 
resemble 
knots 
(which 
may not be so readily 
recognized 
as spuri- 
ous). APCLN can invoke 
a modification 
of CLEAN 
that 
is intended 
to bias it toward 
generating 
smoother 
solu- 
tions 
to the deconvolution 
problem 
while 
preserving 
the 
requirement 
that 
the transform 
of the CLEAN 
compo- 
nents 
list fits the data. 
The 
mechanism 
for introducing 
this bias is the addition 
to the DIRTY BEAM of a DELTA 
FUNCTION (or “spike”) 
of small 
amplitude 
(MAT) 
while 
searching 
for the CLEAN 
components. 
The 
beam 
used 
for the deconvolution 
resembles 
the helmet 
worn by Ger- 
man 
military 
officers 
in World 
War 
I, hence 
the name 
“Prussian 
helmet” 
CLEAN. 
The 
theory 
underlying 
the Cornwell 
smoothness 
stabi- 
lized 
algorithm 
is given 
by Cornwell 
(1982, 
1983), where 
it is described 
as the smoothness 
stabilized 
CLEAN. 
It 
is implemented 
in the 
AIPS 
tasks APCLN and MX. The 
spike 
*performs 
a NEGATIVE feedback 
into 
the dirty 
im- 
age, thus suppressing 
features 
not required 
by the data. 
Spike 
heights 
of a few percent 
and lower than 
usual loop 
gains 
are usually 
needed. 
Also according 
to the MX doc- 
umentation, 
(noise)2 
1 
PHAT ==: 
2(signa1)2 
= 2(SNR)2 
’ 
Unfortunately, 
the addition 
of a Prussian 
helmet 
gen- 
erally 
has “limited 
success,” 
so resorting 
to another 
de- 
convolution 
method 
such as the MAXIMUM ENTROPY 
METHOD is sometimes 
required. 
The 
Cotton-Schwab 
uses the 
Clark 
method, 
but 
the 
major 
cycle 
subtractions 
of CLEAN 
components 
are 
performed 
on ungridded 
visibility 
data. 
The 
Cotton- 
Schwab 
technique 
is often faster than 
the Clark 
variant. 
It is also capable 
of including 
the w baseline 
term, 
thus 
removing 
distortions 
from 
noncoplanar 
baselines. 
It is 
often faster than the Clark 
method. 
The Cotton-Schwab 
technique 
is implemented 
as the AIPS 
task MX. 
The 
Gerchberg-Saxton 
variant, 
also called 
the 
Fienup 
variant, 
is a technique 
originally 
introduced 
for solv- 
ing 
the phase 
problem 
in electron 
microscopy. 
It was 
subsequently 
adapted 
for visibility 
amplitude 
measure- 
ments 
only. 
A Gerchberg-Saxton 
map 
is constrained 
to 
be NONZERO, and positive. 
Data 
and image 
plane 
con- 
straints 
are imposed 
alternately 
while 
transforming 
to 
and from 
the image 
plane. 
If the boxes to CLEAN 
are 
chosen to surround 
the source snugly, 
then the algorithm 
will converge 
faster and will have more 
chance of finding 
a unique 
image. 
The 
algorithm 
is slow, but 
should 
be 
comparable 
to the Clark 
technique 
(APCLN) if the map 
cant ains many 
picture 
elements. 
However, 
the resolu- 
tion 
is data 
dependent 
and varies 
across the map. 
It is 
implemented 
as the AIPS 
task APGS (Pearson 
1984). 
The 
Steer variant 
is a modification 
of the Clark 
variant 
(Cornwell 
1982). 
It is slow, but 
should 
be comparable 
to the 
Clark 
algorithm 
if the map 
contains 
many 
pic- 
ture 
elements. 
The 
algorithm 
used in the program 
is 
due to David 
Steer. 
The 
principle 
is similar 
to Barry 
Clark’s 
CLEAN 
except 
that 
in the 
minor 
cycle 
only 
points 
above the (trim 
level) x (peak 
in the residual 
map) 
are selected. 
In the major 
cycle these 
are removed 
us- 
ing a FAST FOURIER TRANSFORM. If boxes 
are chosen 
to surround 
the source 
snugly, 
then 
the algorithm 
will 
converge 
faster 
and will 
have more 
chance 
of finding 
a 
unique 
image. 
It is implemented 
in AIPS 
as the exper- 
imental 
program 
STEER and 
as the Steer-Dewdney-Ito 
variant 
combined 
with 
the Clark 
algorithm 
as SDCLN. 
The 
Steer-Dewdney-Ito 
variant 
is similar 
to the 
Clark 
variant, 
but 
the 
components 
are 
taken 
as all 
pixels 
having 
residual 
flux 
greater 
than 
a cutoff 
value 
times 
the current 
peak 
residual. 
This 
method 
should 
avoid 
the “ripples” 
produced 
by the standard 
CLEAN 
on ex- 
tended 
emission. 
The 
AIPS 
task 
SDCLN does an AP- 
based 
CLEAN 
of the the 
Clark 
type, 
but 
differs 
from 
APCLN in that 
it offers the option 
to switch 
to the Steer- 
Dewdney-Ito 
method. 
Finally, 
van Cittert 
iteration 
consists 
of two steps: 
1. Estimate 
a correction 
to add to the current 
map 
es- 
timate 
by multiplying 
the residuals 
by some weight. 
In the classical 
van Cittert 
algorithm, 
this weight 
is 
a constant, 
where 
as in CLEAN 
the weight 
is zero 
everywhere 
except 
at the peak 
of the residuals. 
2. Add 
the step to the current 
estimate, 
and subtract 
the estimate, 
convolved 
with the DIRTY BEAM, from 
the residuals.

Clebsch Diagunal 
Cubic 
269 
Though 
it is a simple 
algorithm, 
it works 
well 
(if slowly) 
for cases where 
the DIRTY 
BEAM 
is positive 
semidefinite 
(as it is in astronomical 
observations). 
The basic 
idea is 
that 
the 
DIRTY 
MAP 
is a reasonably 
good 
estimate 
of 
the deconvolved 
map. 
The 
different 
iterations 
vary 
only 
in 
the weight 
to apply 
to each 
residual 
in determining 
the correction 
step. 
van Cittert 
iteration 
is implemented 
as the AIPS 
task 
APVC, 
which 
is a rather 
experimental 
and ad hoc procedure. 
In some 
limiting 
cases, 
it reduces 
to the standard 
CLEAN 
algorithm 
(though 
it would 
be 
impractically 
slow).

Clebsch-Aronhold 
Notation 
A notation 
used 
to 
describe 
curves. 
The 
fundamen- 
tal 
principle 
of Clebsch-Aronhold 
notation 
states 
that 
if each of a number 
of forms 
be replaced 
by a POWER 
of 
a linear 
form 
in the 
same 
number 
of variables 
equal 
to 
the order 
of the given 
form, 
and 
if a sufficient 
number 
of equivalent 
symbols 
are introduced 
by the ARONHOLD 
PROCESS 
so that 
no actual 
COEFFICIENT 
appears 
except 
to the first 
degree, 
then 
every 
identical 
relation 
holding 
for the new 
specialized 
forms 
holds 
for the general 
ones.

hibit 
closure 
if applying 
the BINARY 
OPERATOR 
to two 
elements 
S returns 
a value 
which 
is itself 
a member 
of 
- 3. 
The 
term 
“closure” 
is also used to refer to a “closed” 
version 
of a given 
set. 
The 
closure 
of a SET can be 
defined 
in several 
equivalent 
ways, including 
1. The SET plus its LIMIT 
POINTS, 
also called 
“bound- 
ary” 
points, 
the 
union 
of which 
is also called 
the 
“frontier 
,” 
The 
unique 
smallest 
CLOSED SET containing 
the 
given 
SET, 
The 
COMPLEMENT 
of the interior 
of the 
COMPLE- 
MENT 
of the set, 
The 
collection 
of all points 
such that 
every 
NEIGH- 
BORHOOD 
of them 
intersects 
the original 
SET in a 
nonempty 
SET. 
In topologies 
where 
the T%SEPARATION 
AXIOM 
is as- 
sumed, 
the closure 
of a finite 
SET S is S itself.

Coastline 
Paradox 
Determining 
the length 
of a country’s 
coastline 
is not 
as simple 
as it 
first 
appears, 
as first 
considered 
by 
L. F. Richardson 
(1881-1953). 
In fact, 
the answer 
de- 
pends 
on the length 
of the RULER you use for the mea- 
surements. 
A shorter 
RULER measures 
more 
of the sin- 
uosity 
of bays and inlets 
than 
a larger 
one, so the esti- 
mated 
length 
continues 
to increase as the RULER length 
decreases. 
In fact, 
a coastline 
is an example 
of a FRACTAL, and 
plotting 
the length 
of the RULER versus 
the measured 
length 
of the coastline 
on a log-log 
plot 
gives a straight 
line, 
the slope 
of which 
is the FRACTAL DIMENSION of 
the coastline 
(and will be a number 
between 
1 and 2).

Coin 
Tossing 
An idealized 
coin consists 
of a circular 
disk of zero thick- 
ness which, 
when thrown 
in the air and allowed 
to fall, 
will rest with either 
side face up ( “heads” 
H or Yails” 
T) 
with 
equal 
probability. 
A coin is therefore 
a two-sided 
DIE. A coin toss corresponds 
to a BERNOULLI DISTRI- 
BUTION with p- 
l/2. 
Despite 
slight 
differences 
between 
the sides and NONZERO thickness 
of actual 
coins, 
the 
distribution 
of their 
tosses makes 
a good approximation 
to a p= 
l/2 
BERNOULLI DISTRIBUTION. 
There 
are, however, 
some rather 
counterintuitive 
prop- 
erties 
of coin tossing. 
For example, 
it is twice 
as likely 
that 
the triple 
TTH 
will 
be encountered 
before 
THT 
than 
after 
it, 
and three 
times 
as likely 
that 
THH 
will 
precede 
HTT. 
Furthermore, 
it is six times 
as likely 
that 
HTT 
will 
be the first 
of HTT, 
TTH, 
and 
TTT 
to oc- 
cur (Honsberger 
1979). 
More 
amazingly 
still, 
spinning 
a penny 
instead 
of tossing 
it results 
in heads only about 
30% of the time 
(Paulos 
1995). 
Let w(n) be the probability 
that 
no RUN of three consec- 
utive 
heads appears 
in n independent 
tosses of a COIN. 
The following 
table 
gives the first few values 
of w(n).

Colatitude 
The polar 
angle on a SPHERE measured 
from 
the North 
Pole 
instead 
of the equator. 
The 
angle 4 in SPHERICAL 
COORDINATES is the COLATITUDE. 
It is related 
to the 
LATITUDE 6 by 4 = 90” - S.

The num- 
ber of tripling 
steps needed 
to reach

l 
are 0, 0, 2, 0, 1, 2, 5, 0, 6, . . . (Sloane’s 
A006667). 
The 
Collatz 
problem 
was modified 
by 
Terras 
(1976, 
1979), 
who asked if iterating 
T( > 
1, 
for x even 
2 = 
i(3x 
+ 1) 
for x odd 
(2) 
always returns 
to 1. If NEGATIVE numbers 
are included, 
there 
are 4 known 
cycles: 
(1, 2), (-l), 
(-5, 
-7, 
-lo), 
and (-17, 
-25, 
-37, 
-55, 
-82, 
-41, 
-61, 
-91, 
-136,

-34). 
It is a special 
case of the “generalized 
Collatz 
problem” 
with 
d = 2, nzo = 
1, nzl 
= 3, TO = 0, and 
r1 = -1. 
Terras 
(1976, 
1979) 
also proved 
that 
the set 
of INTEGERS SI, = {n : n has stopping 
time 
5 k} has a 
limiting 
asymptotic 
density 
F(k), 
so the limit

for (n 
: n 5 x and

exists. 
Furthermore, 
F(k) 
+

all INTEGERS have a 
finite 
stopping 
time. 
Finally, 
for all k > 1,

Colinear 
see COLLINEAR 
Collatz 
Problem 
A problem 
posed 
by L. Collatz 
in 1937, also called 
the 
3x + 1 MAPPING, HASSE,S ALGORITHM, 
KAKUTANI'S 
PROBLEM, SYRACUSE ALGORITHM, 
SYRACUSE PROB- 
LEM, THWAITES CONJECTURE, and ULAM'S PROBLEM 
(Lagarias 
1985). 
Thwaites 
(1996) 
has offered 
a Cl000 
reward 
for resolving 
the CONJECTURE. 
Let n be an IN- 
TEGER. 
Then 
the Collatz 
problem 
asks if iterating 
f0 
{ 
+ 
for n even 
n= 
3n + 1 
for n odd 
(1) 
always 
returns 
to 
1 for POSITIVE 
n. 
This 
question 
has been 
tested 
and found 
to be true 
for all numbers 
< 5.6 x 1Ol3 (Leavens 
and Vermeulen 
1992), 
and more 
recently, 
1015 (Vardi 
1991, 
p. 129). 
The 
members 
of 
the SEQUENCE produced 
by the Collatz 
are sometimes 
known 
as HAILSTONE NUMBERS. 
Because 
of the 
dif- 
ficulty 
in solving 
this 
problem, 
Erdcs 
commented 
that 
“mathematics 
is not yet ready 
for s uch problems” 
(La- 
garias 
1985). 
If NEG ATIVE numbers 
are included, 
there 
are four known 
cycles (excluding 
the trivial 
0 cycle) : (4, 
H(x) 
= -xlgx 
- (l- 
x)lg(l 
-x) 
(6) 
8=& 
(7) 
(Lagarias 
1985). 
Conway 
proved 
that 
the 
original 
Collatz 
problem 
has 
no nontrivial 
cycles 
of length 
< 400. 
Lagarias 
(1985) 
showed 
that 
there 
are no nontrivial 
cycles with 
length 
< 275,000. 
Conway 
(1972) 
also proved 
that 
Collatz- 
type problems 
can be formally 
UNDECIDABLE. 
A generalization 
of the COLLATZ PROBLEM lets d > 2 be 
- 
a POSITIVE INTEGER and mo, 
. l 
l , md-1 
be NONZERO 
INTEGERS. Also let pi E Z satisfy 
ri E imi 
(mod 
d) m 
(8) 
Then 
mix---i 
T(x) 
= d 
(9) 
for x E i (mod 
d) defines a generalized 
Collatz 
mapping. 
An equivalent 
form 
is 
T(x) 
= IT] 
+ Xi 
(10)

Problem 
for 2 = i (mod 
d) where 
X0,

are INTEGERS 
and

FUNCTION. 
The 
problem 
is con- 
nected 
with 
ERGODIG 
THEORY 
and 
MARKOV 
CHAINS 
(Matthews 
1995). 
Matthews 
(1995) 
obtained 
the 
fol- 
lowing 
table 
for the mapping 
Tk(x) 
= 
IX 
5(3x

for x s 0 (mod

for x E 1 (mod

Matthews 
and Watts 
(1984) 
proposed 
the following 
con- 
jectures. 
1. If 1rno.m .rn+ll 
< dd, then 
all trajectories 
{TK(n)} 
for n f Z eventually 
cycle. 
2. If Irn() *. -md-11 
> 
dd, then 
almost 
all trajectories 
{TK(n)} 
for n E z are divergent, 
except 
for an ex- 
ceptional 
set of INTIZGIZR~ 
n satisfying 
#{n 
E Sj -X 
5 n < X} 
= o(X). 
3. The 
number 
of cycles is finite. 
4. If the trajectory 
{TK(n)} 
for n E Z is not eventually 
cyclic, 
then 
the 
iterates 
are uniformly 
distribution 
mod 
da for each clr > 1, with

believes 
that

T(

3(x - 2) 
for x G 2 (mod

will either 
reach 0 (mod 
3) or will enter one of the cycles 
(-1) 
or (-2, 
-4), 
and offers a $100 (Australian?) 
prize 
for a proof.

either 
the 
all the same,

then 
a KNOT is said

Colorability 
is invariant 
under

For instance, 
for five colors

five-colorable 
if 
1. at any crossing, 
three 
segments 
meet.

Colorability

For 
instance, 
three-colorability 
can distinguish 
the mir- 
ror

Let 
A denote 
an R-algebra, 
so that 
A is a VECTOR 
SPACE over R and 
If the parameters 
of a LIE 
GROUP 
vary over a CLOSED 
INTERVAL, 
the GROUP 
is compact. 
Every representation 
of a compact 
group 
is equivalent 
to a UNITARY

Now define 
2 E {x E a : x - y for some y E A # 0}, 
where 0 E 2. 
An ASSOCIATIVE 
R-algebra 
is commuta- 
tive if x . y = y 
l x for all x, y f A. Similarly, 
a RING 
is 
commutative 
if the MULTIPLICATION 
operation 
is com- 
mutative, 
and 
a LIE 
ALGEBRA 
is commutative 
if the

THEOREM 
Compact 
Set 
The 
SET S is compact 
if, from 
any SEQUENCE 
of ele- 
ments 
X1, 
X2, 
l . . of S, a subsequence 
can always 
be 
extracted 
which 
tends 
to some 
limit 
element 
X 
of S. 
Compact 
sets are therefore 
closed 
and bounded. 
Compact 
Space 
A TOPOLOGICAL SPACE is compact 
if every open cover 
of X has a finite 
subcover. 
In other 
words, 
if X is the 
union 
of a family 
of open sets, there 
is a finite 
subfamily 
whose union 
is X. 
A subset A of a TOPOLOGICAL 
SPACE 
X is compact 
if it is compact 
as a TOPOLOGICAL 
SPACE 
with 
the 
relative 
topology 
(i.e., 
every 
family 
of open 
sets of X whose union 
contains 
A has a finite 
subfamily 
whose union 
contains 
A).

rules stipulate 
that 
the com-

be used to mark 
off distances, 
so it must 
“collapse” 
whenever 
one of its arms 
is removed

Complement 
Set 
Given 
a set S with 
a subset 
E, the complement 
of E is 
defined 
as 
E’Y{F:FL~,F$E}. 
(1) 
If E = S, then 
E’ = S’ = 0, 
(2) 
where 
0 is the EMPTY SET. Given 
a single 
SET, the 
second PROBABILITY AXIOM gives 
1 = P(S) 
= P(E 
u E’). 
(3) 
Using 
the fact that 
E f~ E’ = 0, 
1= 
P(E) 
+ P(E’) 
P(E’) 
= 1 -P(E). 
This 
demonstrates 
that 
P(S)

= 1 - P(S) 
= 1 - 1 = 0.

The

of complex 
analysis 
is the 
CAUCHY-RIEMANN 
EQUATIONS, which 
give the condi-

a FUNCTION 
must 
satisfy 
in order 
for a com-

generalization 
of the

the 
so-called

When 
the COMPLEX 
DERIVATIVE is defined 
“everywhere,” 
the 
function 
is 
said 
to be ANALYTIC. 
A single 
example 
of the unex- 
petted 
power 
of complex 
analysis 
is PICARD'S THEO-

states 
that 
an ANALYTIC

as- 
sumes 
every COMPLEX NUMBER, with 
possibly 
one ex- 
ception, 
infinitely 
often 
in any NEIGHBORHOOD of an 
ESSENTIAL SINGULARITY!

Let p be the number 
of EDGES at each node, 
p* 
the number 
of EDGES at each node of the DUAL GRAPH, 
V the number 
of VERTICES, E the number 
of EDGES, 
and F the number

Complex 
Multiplication 
TWO COMPLEX 
NUMBERS x = a + ib and y = c + id are 
multiplied 
as follows: 
XY = (a + ib)(c 
+ id) = UC + ibc + iad - bd 
= (UC - bd) + i(ad 
+ bc). 
However, 
the 
multiplication 
can 
be carried 
out 
using 
only 
three REAL multiplications, 
ac, bd, and (a+b)(c+d) 
as 
$?[(a + ib)(c 
+ id)] 
= ac - bd 
3[(a 
+ ib)(c 
+ id)] 
= (a + b)(c + d) - UC - bd. 
Complex

a special 
meaning 
for 
EL- 
LIPTIC CURVES.

The complex

are the FIELD c of numbers 
of the 
form 
x + iy, where 
x and y are REAL 
NUMBERS 
and i is 
the IMAGINARY 
NUMBER 
equal 
to 43. 
When 
a single 
letter 
z = x + iy is used 
to denote 
a complex 
number, 
it 
is sometimes 
called 
an “AFFIX." 
The FIELD of complex 
numbers 
includes 
the 
FIELD of REAL NUMBERS as a 
SUBFIELD. 
Through 
the EULER FORMULA, a complex 
number 
z=x+iy

may be written 
in "PHASOR" form 
z = lzl(cos8

More 
generally, 
if V is a 2-D VECTOR SPACE, 
a linear 
map 
J : V -+ V such that 
J2 = -I 
is called 
a complex

on V. If V = R2, this collapses 
to the previous 
definition.

A problem

grow ex-

However, 
if a solution

it 
can be reduced 
to a single

where m is the part

divides 
n.

Composition 
The combination 
of two FUNCTIONS 
to form a single n&w 
OPERATOR. 
The 
composition 
of two functions 
f and g 
is denoted 
f o g and is defined 
by 
f O 9 = f (g(4) 
when f and g are both 
functions 
of z. 
An operation 
called 
composition 
is also defined 
on BI- 
NARY 
QUADRATIC 
FORMS. 
For 
two 
numbers 
repre- 
sented 
by two forms, 
the 
product 
can then 
be repre- 
sented 
by the composition. 
For example, 
the composi- 
tion 
of the forms 
2x2 + 15y2 and 3x2 + 10y2 is given 
by 
6x2 + 5y2, and 
in this 
case, the product 
of 17 and 13 
would 
be represented 
as (6 . 36 + 5 . 1 = 221). 
There 
are several 
algorithms 
for computing 
binary 
quadratic 
form 
composition, 
which 
is the basis for some factoring 
methods.

the

To prove

take

Cone 
A cone is a PYRAMID with 
a circular 
CROSS-SECTION. 
A right 
cone is a cone with 
its vertex 
above the center 
of its base. A right 
cone of height 
h can be described 
by 
the parametric 
equations 
x=r(h-z)cos8 
(1) 
y = r(h - z) sin0 
(2) 
z=z 
(3) 
for z E [0, h] and 0 E [O, 27~). The VOLUME of a cone is 
therefore 
V = $Abh, 
(4) 
where 
Ab is the base AREA and h is the height. 
If the 
base is circular, 
then 
V = +r’h.

found 
by Archimedes 
in 
On the Sphere 
and Cylinder 
(ca. 225 BC) 
and Euclid 
in 
Proposition 
XII.10 
of his Elements 
(Dunham 
1990). 
The CENTROID can be obtained 
by setting 
R2 = 0 in the 
equation 
for the centroid 
of the CYNICAL FRUSTUM, 
z=L= ( > 
h(R12 
+ RIRZ 
+ Rz2) 
V 
4(R12 
+ 2RlR2 
+ 3Rz2)’ 
(6) 
(Beyer 
1987, p* 133) yielding 
z= 
$h.

For a right 
circular 
cone, the SLANT HEIGHT s is 
s = 2/r” 
+ h2 
(8) 
and the surface AREA (not 
including 
the base) is 
S= 
m-s = m pzF* 
(9) 
In discussions 
of CONIC SECTIONS, the word cone is of- 
ten 
used to refer 
to two similar 
cones placed 
apex 
to 
apex. 
This 
allows 
the HYPERBOLA to be defined 
as the 

296 
Cone Graph 
Confidence 
Interval 
intersection 
of a PLANE 
with 
both 
NAPPES 
(pieces) 
of 
the cone. 
The 
LOCUS 
of the 
apex 
of a variable 
cone containing 
an ELLIPSE 
fixed 
in 3-space 
is a HYPERBOLA 
through 
the 
FOCI 
of the 
ELLIPSE. 
In addition, 
the 
LOCUS 
of 
the apex 
of a cone containing 
that 
HYPERBOLA 
is the 
original 
ELLIPSE. 
Furthermore, 
the ECCENTRICITIES 
of 
the ELLIPSE 
and HYPERBOLA 
are reciprocals.

Cone-Sphere 
Intersection 
Let a CONE of openi ,ng parame 
ter c and vertex 
at 
intersect 
a SPHERE 
of RADIUS 
T centered 
at (~0, 
with 
the CONE oriented 
such that 
its axis does not pass 
through 
the center 
of the SPHERE. 
Then 
the equations 
of the curve of intersection 
are 
x2 + y2 
----2-- 
= z2 
(1) 
(II: - xo)2 + (y - yo)2 + (z - zo)2 = r2*

Therefore, 
=I: and 
y are 
connected 
by a complicated 
QUARTIC 
EQUATION, 
and 
z, y, and 
z by a QUADRA- 
TIC EQUATION. 
If the 
CONE-SPHERE 
intersection 
is on-axis 
so that 
a 
CONE 
of opening 
parameter 
c and vertex 
at (O,O, ZO) is 
oriented 
with 
its AXIS 
along 
a radial 
of the SPHERE 
of 
radius 
r centered 
at (O,O, 0), then 
the equations 
of the 
curve of intersection 
are 
( z- 
x2 + y2

Solution 
By letting w = f(z), the REAL and IMAGINARYPARTS of 
w must 
satisfy the CAUCHY-R~EMANN EQUATIONS and 
LAPLACE'S EQUATION, so they 
automatically 
provide 
a 
scalar POTENTIAL and a so-called 
stream 
function. 
If a 
physical 
problem 
can be found 
for which 
the solution 
is 
valid, 
we obtain 
a solution-which 
may have been very 
difficult 
to obtain 
directly-by 
working 
backwards.

Congruence 
Congruence 
Congruence 
If b - c is integrally 
divisible 
by a, then 
b and c are said 
to be congruent 
with 
MODULUS 
a. This 
is written 
math- 
ematically 
as b E c (mod 
a). If b - c is not divisible 
by a, 
then 
we say b $ c (mod 
a). 
The 
(mod 
a) is sometimes 
omitted 
when the MODULUS 
a is understood 
for a given 
computation, 
so care must 
be taken 
not to confuse 
the 
symbol 
= with that 
for an EQUIVALENCE. 
The quantity 
b is called 
the RESIDUE 
or REMAINDER. 
The COMMON 
RESIDUE 
is taken 
to be NONNEGATIVE 
and smaller 
than 
nz, and the MINIMAL 
RESIDUE 
is b or b - nz, whichever 
is smaller 
in ABSOLUTE 
VALUE. 
In many 
computer 
lan- 
guages (such as FORTRAN or Muthematic@), 
the COMMON 
RESIDUE of c (mod 
a) is written 
mod(c ,a). 
Congruence 
arithmetic 
is perhaps 
most 
familiar 
as a 
generalization 
of the 
arithmetic 
of the 
clock: 
40 min- 
utes 
past 
the 
hour 
plus 
35 minutes 
gives 
40 + 35 s 
15 (mod 
60), or 15 minutes 
past the hour, 
and 10 o’clock 
a.m. 
plus 
five hours 
gives 
10 + 5 s 3 (mod 
12), or 3 
o’clock 
p.m. 
Congruences 
satisfy 
a number 
of impor- 
tant 
properties, 
and are extremely 
useful 
in many 
areas 
of NUMBER 
THEORY. 
Using 
congruences, 
simple 
DI- 
VISIBILITY 
TESTS 
to check 
whether 
a given 
number 
is 
divisible 
by another 
number 
can sometimes 
be derived. 
For example, 
if the sum of a number’s 
digits 
is divisible 
by 3 (9), then 
the original 
number 
is divisible 
by 3 (9). 
Congruences 
also have their 
limitations. 
For example, 
if 
a E b and c = d (mod 
n), then 
it follows 
that 
uz G b”, 
but 
usually 
not that 
zc = zd or uc = bd. In addition, 
by “rolling 
over ,” congruences 
discard 
absolute 
informa- 
tion. 
For example, 
knowing 
the number 
of minutes 
past 
the hour is useful, 
but knowing 
the hour the minutes 
are 
past is often 
more 
useful 
still. 
Let 
a = a’ 
(mod 
m) 
and 
b = b’ 
(mod 
m), 
then 
im- 
portant 
properties 
of congruences 
include 
the following,

13. If a = b (mod 
m), 
then 
P(a) 
= P(b) 
(mod 
m), 
for 
P(X) a POLYNOMIAL. 
Properties 
(6-8) 
can be proved 
simply 
by defining 
a = a’ + rd 
b = b’ + sd, 
(1) 
(2) 
where T and s are INTEGERS. 
Then 
a + b = a’ + b’ + (T + s)d 
a - b = a’ - b’ + (r - s)d 
ub = a’b’ +- (u’s + b’r + rsd)d,

(4) 
(5) 
so the properties 
are true.

also apply 
to 
FRACTIONS.

Conic 
Section 
The 
conic sections 
are the nondegenerate 
curves gener- 
ated 
by the intersections 
of a PLANE with 
one or two 
NAPPES of a CONE. For 
a PLANE parallel 
to a CROSS- 
SECTION, a CIRCLE 
is produced. 
The 
closed curve pro- 
duced 
by the 
intersection 
of a single 
NAPPE with 
an 
inclined 
PLANE is an ELLIPSE or PARABOLA. 
The curve 
produced 
by a PLANE intersecting 
both 
NAPPES 
is a 
HYPERBOLA. The ELLIPSE and HYPERBOLA are known 
as CENTRAL CONICS. 
Because 
of this 
simple 
geometric 
interpretation, 
the 
conic 
sections 
were studied 
by the Greeks 
long 
before 
their 
application 
to inverse square 
law orbits 
was known. 
Apollonius 
wrote the classic ancient 
work on the subject 
entitled 
0~2 Co&s. 
Kepler 
was the first 
to notice 
that 
planetary 
orbits 
were ELLIPSES, and Newton 
was then 
able 
to derive 
the shape 
of orbits 
mathematically 
us- 
ing CALCULUS, under 
the assumption 
that 
gravitational 
force goes as the inverse 
square 
of distance. 
Depending 
on the energy 
of the orbiting 
body, 
orbit 
shapes 
which 
are any of the four types 
of conic 
sections 
are possible. 
A conic 
section 
may 
more 
formally 
be defined 
as the 
locus 
of a point 
P that 
moves 
in the PLANE of a fixed 
point 
F called 
the FOCUS and a fixed 
line 
d called 
the 
DIRECTRIX 
(with 
F not on d) such that 
the ratio 
of the 
distance 
of P from 
F to its distance 
from d is a constant 
e called 
the ECCENTRICITY. 
For a Focus 
(0,O) 
and 
DIRECTRIX 
x = -a, 
the equation 
is 
x2 + y2 = e2(x + u)“. 
If e = 1, the conic is a PARABOLA, if e < 1, the conic is 
an ELLIPSE, andife 
> 1,itis 
a HYPERBOLA. 
In standard 
form, 
a conic 
section 
is written 
y2 = 2Rx - (1 - e2)x2, 
where R is the RADIUS OF CURVATURE 
and 
e is the 
ECCENTRICITY. 
Five points 
in a plane determine 
a conic 
(Le Lionnais 
1983, p. 56).

A conical

A connected 
set is a SET which 
cannot 
be partitioned 
into 
two nonempty 
SUBSETS 
which 
are open in the rel- 
ative 
topology 
induced 
on the SET. 
Equivalently, 
it is 
a SET which 
cannot 
be partitioned 
into 
two nonempty 
SUBSETS 
such that 
each SUBSET 
has no points 
in com- 
mon 
with 
the closure 
of the other.

Connected 
Space 
A SPACE 13 is connected 
if any two points 
in D can be 
connected 
by a curve 
lying 
wholly 
within 
D. 
A SPACE 
is O-connected 
(a.k.a. 
PATHWISE-CONNECTED) 
if every 
MAP 
from 
a O-SPHERE 
to the 
SPACE 
extends 
contin- 
uously 
to the 
~-DISK. 
Since 
the O-SPHERE 
is the two 
endpoints 
of an interval 
(~-DISK), 
every two points 
have 
a path 
between 
them. 
A space is l-connected 
(a.k.a. 
SIMPLY 
CONNECTED) 
if it is O-connected 
and if every 
MAP 
from 
the ~-SPHERE 
to it extends 
continuously 
to 
a MAP 
from 
the 
~-DISK. 
In other 
words, 
every 
loop 
in the SPACE is contractible. 
A SPACE is n-MULTIPLY 
CONNECTED 
if it is (n - Q-connected 
and if every MAP 
from the n-SPHERE 
into it extends 
continuously 
over the 
(n + l)-DISK. 
A theorem 
of Whitehead 
says that 
a SPACE is infinitely 
connected 
IFF it is contractible.

Sequences 
Consecutive 
number 
sequences 
are 
sequences 
con- 
structed 
by 
concatenating 
numbers 
of a given 
type. 
Many 
of these 
sequences 
were considered 
by Smaran-

so they 
are sometimes 
known 
as SMARANDACHE 
SEQUENCES.

Dumitrescu 
and Seleacu

Mudge 
1995; 
Stephen 
1998). 
This 
sequence 
gives the 
digits 
of the CHAMPERNOWNE 
CONSTANT 
and contains 
no PRIMES in the first 
4,470 
terms 
(Weisstein). 
This 
is roughly 
consistent 
with 
simple 
arguments 
based 
on 
the distribution 
of prime 
which 
suggest 
that 
only a sin- 
gle prime 
is expected 
in the 
first 
15,000 
or so terms. 
The 
number 
of digits 
of the n term 
can be computed 
by noticing 
the 
pattern 
in the 
following 
table, 
where

Therefore,

the second

The 
nth

of the

integer 
sequence 
consists 
of the

The

of this

is the 
82nd

This

simple

based 
on the distribution 
of prime 
which 
suggest 
that 
a 
single 
prime 
is expected 
in the first 
15,000 
or so terms. 
The terms 
of the reverse 
integer 
sequence 
have the same 
number 
of digits 
as do the consecutive

sequence. 
The

of the

Conservation 
of Number 
Principle 
A generalization 
of Poncelet’s 
PERMANENCE 
OF MATH- 
EMATICAL 
RELATIONS 
PRINCIPLE 
made 
by H. Schubert 
in 1874-79. 
The 
conservation 
of number 
principle 
as- 
serts 
that 
the 
number 
of solutions 
of any 
determinate 
algebraic 
problem 
in any 
number 
of parameters 
under 
variation 
of the parameters 
is invariant 
in such 
a man- 
ner that 
no solutions 
become 
INFINITE. 
Schubert 
called 
the application 
of this technique 
the CALCULUS 
of ENU- 
MERATIVE 
GEOMETRY.

Constant 
Any 
REAL 
NUMBER 
which 
is “significant” 
(or interest- 
ing) 
in some way. 
In this work, 
the term 
“constant” 
is 
generally 
reserved 
for REAL 
nonintegral 
numbers 
of in- 
terest, 
while 
“NUMBER” 
is reserved 
for interesting 
INTE- 
GERS (e.g., BRUN’S 
CONSTANT, but BEAST NUMBER). 
Certain 
constants 
are known 
to many 
DECIMAL 
DIGITS 
and recur 
throughout 
many 
diverse 
areas of mathemat- 
ics, often 
in unexpected 
and surprising 
places 
(e.g., 
PI, 
e, and to some 
extent, 
the 
EULER-MASCHERONI 
CON- 
STANT y)* 
Other 
constants 
are more 
specialized 
and 
may 
be known 
to only 
a few DIGITS. 
S. Plouffe 
main- 
tains 
a site about 
the computation 
and identification 
of 
numerical 
constants. 
Plouffe’s 
site also contains 
a page 
giving 
the largest 
number 
of DIGITS 
computed 
for the 
most 
common 
constants. 
S. Finch 
maintains 
a delight- 
ful, more

both 
common

deter-

Constructible 
Number 
A number 
which 
can be represented 
by a FINITE num- 
ber of ADDITIONS, SUBTRACTIONS, MULTIPLICATIONS, 
DIVISIONS, and FINITE SQUARE ROOT extractionsof 
in- 
tegers. 
Such 
numbers 
correspond 
to LINE SEGMENTS 
which 
can be constructed 
using 
only 
STRAIGHTEDGE 
and COMPASS. 
All RATIONAL NUMBERS are constructible, 
and all con- 
structible 
numbers 
are ALGEBRAIC NUMBERS (Courant 
and Robbins 
1996, p. 133). 
If a CUBIC EQUATION with 
rational 
coefficients 
has no rational 
root, 
then 
none 
of 
its roots 
is constructible 
(Courant 
and Robbins, 
pm 136). 
In particular, 
let Fo be the FIELD of RATIONAL NUM- 
BERS. 
Now 
construct 
an extension 
field 
Fl 
of con- 
structible 
numbers 
by the adjunction 
of 6, 
where JQ 
is in Fo, but & 
is not, 
consisting 
of all numbers 
of the 
form 
a0 + boa, 
where 
ao, bo E Fo. Next, 
construct 
an 
extension 
field 
F2 of Fl 
by the adjunction 
of 6, 
de- 
fined as the numbers 
al + bl&, 
where al, bl E Fl, and 
kl is a number 
in Fl for which 
& 
does not lie in Fl. 
Continue 
the process 
n times. 
Then 
constructible 
num- 
bers are precisely 
those 
which 
can be reached 
by such 
a sequence 
of extension 
fields 
F,, 
where n is a measure 
of the 
“complexity” 
of the construction 
(Courant 
and 
Robbins 
1996)

Continued

provide, 
in some 
sense, a series of 
“best” 
estimates 
for an IRRATIONAL 
NUMBER. 
F'unc- 
tions 
can also be written 
as continued 
fractions, 
pro- 
viding 
a series of better 
and better 
rational 
approxima- 
tions. 
Continued 
fractions 
have 
also proved 
useful 
in 
the proof of certain 
properties 
of numbers 
such as e and 
7r (PI). 
Because 
irrationals 
which 
are square 
roots 
of 
RATIONAL 
NUMBERS 
have periodic 
continued 
fractions, 
an exact 
representation 
for a tabulated 
numerical 
value 
( i.e.,

Continued

are also useful 
for finding 
near com-

different 
periods. 
For example, 
the Metonic 
cycle used for calendrical 
pur- 
poses by the Greeks 
consists 
of 235 lunar 
months 
which 
very nearly 
equal 
19 solar years, and 235/19 
is the sixth 
CONVERGENT 
of the ratio 
of the lunar 
phase 
(synodic) 
period 
and solar period 
(365.2425/29.53059). 
Continued

can also be used to calculate 
gear ratios, 
and

an ALGORITHM for performing

It requires

Continuous 
Function 
A continnous 
function 
is a FUNCTION f : X + Y where 
the pre-image 
of every OPEN SET in Y is OPEN in X. 
A function 
f ( ) 
x 
in a single 
variable 
x is said to be con- 
tinuous 
at point 
20 if 
1. f(zo) 
is defined, 
so x0 is the DOMAIN 
off. 
2. limz+sO 
f(z) 
exists. 
3. limz+zO 
f(x) 
= f(xoL 
where lim 
denotes 
a LIMIT. 
If f is DIFFERENTIABLE at 
point 
x0, then 
it is also continuous 
at x0. If f and g are 
continuous 
at $0, then 
1. f + g is continuous 
at 20. 
2. f - g is continuous 
at 20. 
3. f X g is continuous 
at 20. 
4. f + g is continuous 
at 20 if g(xo) 
# 0 and is discon- 
tinuous 
at x0 if g(x0) 
= 0. 
5. f o g is continuous, 
where 
o denotes 
using 
g as the 
argument 
to f.

Continuum 
The 
nondenumerable 
set of REAL NUMBERS, denoted 
C. It satisfies 
No+C=C 
(1) 
and 
c’ 
= c, 
(2) 
where No is No (ALEPH-0). 
It is also true 
that 
No - 
No -c. 
(3) 
However, 
Cc = F 
(4) 
is a SET larger 
than the continuum. 
Paradoxically, 
there 
are exactly 
as many 
points 
C on a LINE 
(or LINE 
SEG- 
MENT) 
as in a PLANE, 
a 3-D SPACE, or finite 
HYPER- 
SPACE, since all these SETS can be put 
into 
a ONE-TO- 
ONE correspondence 
with 
each other. 
The CONTINUUM HYPOTHESIS, first proposed 
by Georg 
Cantor, 
holds 
that 
the CARDINAL NUMBER of the con- 
tinuum 
is the same as that 
of Ni. 
The 
surprising 
truth 
is that 
this proposition 
is UNDECIDABLE, since neither 
it 
nor its converse 
contradicts 
the tenets 
of SET THEORY. 
see also ALEPH-0 
(No), 
ALEPH-1 
(Nl), CONTINUUM HY- 
POTHESIS,DENUMERABLE SET 
Continuum 
Hypothesis 
The 
proposal 
originally 
made 
by 
Georg 
Cantor 
that 
there 
is no infinite 
SET with 
a CARDINAL NUMBER be- 
tween that 
of the 
“small” 
infinite 
SET of INTEGERS 
NO 
and the 
“large” 
infinite 
set of REAL NUMBERS C (the 
“CONTINUUM"). 
Symbolically, 
the continuum 
hypoth- 
esis is that 
Nl 
= 
C. 
Gijdel 
showed 
that 
no contra- 
diction 
would 
arise 
if the 
continuum 
hypothesis 
were 
added 
to conventional 
ZERMELO-FRAENKEL 
SET THE- 
ORY. However, 
using 
a technique 
called 
FORCING, Paul 
Cohen 
(1963, 
1964) proved 
that 
no contradiction 
would 
arise 
if the 
negation 
of the 
continuum 
hypothesis 
was 
added 
to SET 
THEORY. 
Together, 
Giidel’s 
and Cohen’s 
results 
established 
that 
the 
validity 
of the 
continuum 
hypothesis 
depends 
on the version 
of SET 
THEORY 
be- 
ing used, and is therefore 
UNDECIDABLE (assuming 
the 
ZERMELO-FRAENKEL AXIOMS togetherwiththe 
AXIOM 
OF CHOICE). 
Conway 
and 
Guy 
(1996) 
give 
a generalized 
version 
of 
the Continuum 
Hypothesis 
which 
is also UNDECIDABLE: 
is 2NH = N,+l 
for every a?

Convolution 
Convolution 
Theorem 
327 
Convolution 
A convolution 
is an integral 
which 
expresses the amount 
of overlap 
of one function 
g(t) 
as it is shifted 
over an- 
other 
function 
f(t). 
It therefore 
“blends” 
one function 
with 
another. 
For example, 
in synthesis 
imaging, 
the 
measured 
DIRTY 
MAP 
is a convolution 
of the 
“true” 
CLEAN 
MAP 
with 
the 
DIRTY 
BEAM 
(the 
FOURIER 
TRANSFORM 
of the 
sampling 
distribution). 
The 
con- 
volution 
is sometimes 
also known 
by its German 
name, 
FALTUNG 
(“folding”). 
A convolution 
over a finite 
range 
[0, t] is given 
by 
s t 
f 0) * g(t) = 
f Wdt - 4 d7 
(1) 
0 
where the symbol 
f*g 
(occasionally 
also written 
as f@g) 
denotes 
convolution 
of f and 
g. 
Convolution 
is more 
often taken 
over an infinite 
range, 
f(t)*g(t) 
= 
lm 
f(T)g(t-+h=r 
rrn 
d4f 
(t-w- 
J-m 
J-m 
(2) 
Let f, g, and h be arbitrary 
functions 
and a a constant. 
Convolution 
has the following 
properties: 
f *9=9*f 
(3 > 
f * (g * h) = (f * 9) * h 
(4) 
f * (9 + h) = (f * 9) + (f * h) 
(5) 
a(f * g) = (af) 
* g = f * (as). 
(6) 
The 
INTEGRAL 
identity 
X 
ss 
x f(t)dtdx 
= 
s 
x(x - t)f(t)dt 
(7) 
a 
a 
a 
also gives a convolution. 
Taking 
the DERIVATIVE 
of a 
convolution 
gives 
$(f 
g) 
df 
dg 
*

dx 
*g=f*-.

(8) 
The 
AREA 
under 
a convolution 
is the product 
of areas 
under 
the factors, 
f (u)g(x 
- u) du 1

= [/,_f(u)du]

Theorem 
Let

P 
denotes 
the inverse 
FOURIER

(where 
the transform 
pair 
is defined 
to have constants 
A = 1 and B = -2n). 
Then 
the CONVOLUTION 
is

The 
correlation

is a quantity 
which 
gives the 
quality 
of a LEAST SQUARES FITTING 
to the 
original

To define 
the correlation 
coefficient, 
first consider 
the sum 
of squared 
values

and 
ssYY of a set 
of n data

The 
correlation 
coefficient 
is 
also 
known 
as 
the 
PRODUCT-M• MENTCOEFFICIENTOF 
CORRELATION or 
PEARSON'S CORRELATION. The 
correlation 
coefficients 
for linear 
fits to increasingly 
noise data are shown above. 
The correlation 
coefficient 
has an important 
physical 
in- 
terpretation. 
To see this, 
define 
A E (Xx2 
- nz2)-’ 
00) 
and denote 
the “expected” 
value 
for yi as jji. 
Sums 
of 
& are then 
a+bxi =g-- bz + bXi = a: + b(Xi - z) 
A(gCx2 
- ZCxy 
+ xiCxy 
- nZ?jxi) 
A[gCx2 
+ (xi - Z)Cxy 
- nZyxi] 
(11) 
A(n@x2 
- n2Z2y) 
(12) 
A2 [ng2 (cZ2)2 
- n2Z2fj2(Cx2) 
- 2nZfj(Cxy)(Cx2) 
+ 2n2Z3@xy) 
+ (CX”)(CX~)~ 
- nZ2(Czy)] 
(13) 
Cyiiji 
= AC[yifjCx2 
+ yi(xi 
- Z)Cxy 
- n@xiyi] 
= A[ng2Cx2 
+ (c2~)~ 
- nSi%jCxy - nZy(xxy)] 
= A[n$Cx2 
+ (CXY)~ - 2nZ@xy]. 
(14) 
and the sum of squared 
errors 
is 
SSE E C(yi 
- &)” 
= c(yi 
- g + 63 - b~i)~ 
= C[Yi - y - b(Xi - z)12 
= c(yi 
- y)” + b2C(xi 
- 2)” - 2bC(xi 
- z)(yi 
- y) 
= ssyy + b2ssSs - 2bsszy. 
(16) 
(17) 
(18) 
b = ssxy 
ssxx 
so 
SSE = ssYy + <sszx 
- 23%~~~ 
-xx 
ssxx 
and 
SSE + SSR = ss,,(l 
- T”) + ssYg2 
= ssYY. 
(19) 
(20) 
(21) 
The 
square 
of the correlation 
coefficient 
~~ is therefore 
given 
by 
SSR 
ssxy 
2 
r2=-=----- 
(Cxy - nZy)2 
- 
ssYY 
ssxx ssyy 
CC X2 - nZ2) (Cy2 - nij2) 
l 
(22) 
In other 
words, 
r2 is the 
proportion 
of ssyy which 
is 
accounted 
for by the regression. 
If there 
is complete 
correlation, 
then 
the lines 
obtained 
by solving 
for best-fit 
(a, b) and 
(a’, b’) coincide 
(since 
all 
data 
points 
lie on them), 
so solving 
(6) for y and 
equating 
to (4) gives 
y=-$+;=a+bx. 
(23) 
Therefore, 
a = --d/b’ 
and b = l/b’, 
giving 
r2 = bb’ = 1. 
(24) 
The sum of squared 
residuals 
is then 
SSR = C(& 
- g)” = C($ 
- 2@& + g”) 
= A2(Cxy 
- ~~zy)~(Cx~ 
- nz2) = (Cxy

= 
ssyyr 
= b2ssxx,

(15) 
The 
correlation 
coefficient 
is independent 
of both 
origin 
and scale, so 
T(% v) = r(x, Y),

Theorem 
There 
exists 
an INTEGER 
IV such that 
every 
string 
in 
the LOOK 
AND SAY SEQUENCE 
“decays” 
in at most N 
days to a compound 
of “common” 
and 
“transuranic 
el- 
ements.” 
The 
table 
below 
gives the periodic 
table 
of atoms 
asso- 
ciated 
with 
the 
LOOK 
AND SAY SEQUENCE 
as named 
by Conway 
(1987). 
The 
“abundance” 
is the 
tiverage 
number 
of occurrences 
for long 
strings 
out of every mil- 
lion 
atoms. 
The 
asymptotic 
abundances 
are zero for 
transuranic 
elements, 
and 27.246. 
. l for arsenic 
(As), the 
next 
rarest 
element. 
The 
most 
common 
element 
is hy- 
drogen 
(II), 
having 
an abundance 
of 91,970.383.. 
. . The 
starting 
element 
is U, represented 
by the string 
“3,” and 
subsequent 
terms 
are those 
giving 
a description 
of the 
current 
term: 
one three 
(13); one one, one three 
(1113); 
three 
ones, one three 
(3113),

Covariance 
Given 
n sets of variates 
denoted 
{xl}, 
. . . , {xn} 
, a 
quantity 
called 
the COVARIANCE 
MATRIX 
is defined 
by 
Kj 
= 
COV(Xi, 
Xj) 
(1) 
s 
((Xi 
- 
/b)(Xj 
- 
Pj)) 
(2) 
= 
(Xixj)

(Xi) 
(Xj)

(3) 
where 
pi 
= 
(xi) 
and 
pj 
= 
(xj) 
are the 
MEANS 
of x:i 
and xj, 
respectively. 
An individual 
element 
Vij of the 
COVARIANCE 
MATRIX 
is called 
the 
covariance 
of the 
two variates 
xt:i and xj, 
and provides 
a measure 
of how 
strongly 
correlated 
these variables 
are. 
In fact,

rived 
quantity 
COr(Xi,Xj)

Xj)

, 
i 
j 
(4) 
where 
ui, 
cj are the 
STANDARD 
DEVIATIONS, 
is called 
the CORRELATION 
of xi and x+ 
Note 
that 
if xi and xj 
are taken 
from 
the same set of variates 
(say, x), then 
cov(x,x) 
= (x2) 
- (x)2 = var(x), 
(5) 
giving 
the usual 
VARIANCE 
var(x). 
The 
covariance 
is 
also symmetric 
since 
cov(x7 Y) = cov(y, 
2). 
(6) 
cov(x, y) = (xy) - pxpy = (4 (Y> - 
P&Y 
= 
07 
(8) 
so the covariance 
is zero. 
However, 
if the variables 
are 
correlated 
in some 
way, then 
their 
covariance 
will 
be 
NONZERO. 
In 
fact, 
if cov(x, 
y) > 
0, then 
y tends 
to 
increase 
as x increases. 
If cov(x, y) < 0, then 
y tends 
to 
decrease 
as x increases. 
The covariance 
obeys the identity 
co+ + 2, y) = ((3 + Z)Y - (x + 4 (Y>>

Craps 
A game 
played 
with 
two DICE. 
If the total 
is 7 or I1 
(a “natural”), 
the 
thrower 
wins and 
retains 
the DICE 
for another 
throw. 
If the total 
is 2, 3, or 12 (“craps”), 
the thrower 
loses but 
retains 
the DICE. 
If the total 
is 
any other 
number 
(called 
the 
thrower’s 
“point”), 
the 
thrower 
must 
continue 
throwing 
and 
roll 
the 
“point” 
value again 
before 
throwing 
a 7. If he succeeds, 
he wins 
and retains 
the DICE, 
but if a 7 appears 
first, 
the player 
loses and passes the dice. 
The 
probability 
of winning 
is

Cribbage 
Cribbage 
is a game in which each of two players 
is dealt 
a 
hand of six CARDS. 
Each player 
then 
discards 
two of his 
six cards to a four-card 
“crib” 
which alternates 
between 
players. 
After 
the discard, 
the top card in the remaining 
deck is turned 
up. Cards 
are then alternating 
played 
out 
by the two players, 
with 
points 
being 
scored 
for pairs, 
runs, 
cumulative 
total 
of 15 and 
31, and 
playing 
the 
last possible 
card (“go”) 
not giving 
a total 
over 31. All 
face cards are counted 
as 10 for the purpose 
of playing 
out, 
but 
the normal 
values 
of Jack 
= 11, Queen 
= 12, 
King 
= 13 are used to determine 
runs. 
Aces are always 
low (ace = 1). 
After 
all cards 
have been 
played, 
each 
player 
counts 
the four cards 
in his hand 
taken 
in con- 
junction 
with 
the single 
top 
card. 
Points 
are awarded 
for pairs, 
flushes, 
runs, 
and combinations 
of cards giv- 
ing 
15. 
A Jack 
having 
the same 
suit 
as a top 
card is 
awarded 
an additional 
point 
for “nobbs.” 
The 
crib 
is 
then 
also counted 
and scored. 
The 
winner 
is the first 
person 
to “peg” 
a certain 
score, as recorded 
on a “crib- 
bage board.” 
The 
best possible 
score in a hand 
is 29, corresponding 
to three 
5s and 
a Jack 
with 
a top 
5 the 
same 
suit 
as 
the Jack. 
Hands 
with 
scores of 25, 26, and 27 are not 
possible.

Let a KNOT K be parameterized 
by a VECTOR FUNC-

and let w be a fixed 
UNIT 
VEC-

Count 
the number 
of RELATIVE MINIMA of

function 
w-v(t). 
Then 
the MINIMUM such 
number 
over all directions 
w and all K of the given type 
is called 
the crookedness 
p(K). 
Milnor 
(1950) 
showed 
that 
27rp(K) 
is the INFIMUM of the total 
curvature 
of 
K. For any TAME KNOT K in iw3, p(K) 
= b(K) 
where 
b(K) is the BRIDGE INDEX.

all three

Theorem 
Cross-Correlation 
Let 
jc denote 
cross-correlation. 
Then 
the 
CFOSS- 
correlation 
of two functions 
f(t) 
and g(t) 
of a real vari- 
able t is defined 
by 
f *g = f *c-t> * g(t), 
(1) 
where 
* denotes 
CONVOLUTION 
and f*(t) 
is the COM- 
PLEX CONJUGATE of f(t). 
The CONVOLUTION isdefined 
bY 
f(t) * 9(t) 
= 
f mv 
- TNT7

Another 
representation 
is 
therefore 
f(X> Y, 4 = (Y? 2XY, x2 - Y”),

Cross-Section 
The

of a SOLID 
is a LAMINA 
obtained 
by 
its intersection 
with 
a PLANE. 
The 
cross-section 
of an 
object 
therefore 
represents 
an infinitesimal 
“slice” 
of a 
solid, 
and may be different 
depending 
on the orientation 
of the slicing

While 
the cross-section 
of a SPHERE

the cross-section 
of a CUBE

If a discrete 
GROUP 
of displacements 
in the plane 
has 
more than 
one center 
of rotation, 
then the only rotations 
that 
can occur 
are by 2, 3, 4, and 6. This 
can be shown 
as follows. 
It must 
be true 
that 
the sum 
of the interior 
angles divided 
by the number 
of sides is a divisor 
of 360’.

This

for l-, 2-, 3-, 4-,

That 
it does not hold 
for n > 6 is 
seen by noting 
that 
n = 6 corresponds 
to m = 3. The 
m = 2 case requires 
that 
n = n - 2 (impossible), 
and 
the m = 1 case requires 
that 
n = -2 
(also impossible).

Cube 
The 
three-dimensional 
PLATONIC SOLID (Ps) 
which 
is 
also called 
the HEXAHEDRON. The 
cube is composed 
of 
six SQUARE 
faces 6{4} 
which 
meet 
each other 
at RIGHT 
ANGLES, and has 8 VERTICES and 12 EDGES. It is de- 
scribed 
by the SCHL~FLI 
SYMBOL {4,3}. 
It is a ZONO-

Because 
the VOLUME of a cube of side length 
n is given 
by n3, a number 
of the form 
n3 is called 
a CUBIC NUM- 
BER (or sometimes 
simply 
“a cube”). 
Similarly, 
the op- 
eration 
of taking 
a number 
to the third 
POWER is called 
CUBING. 
Cube

The 
cube 
cannot 
be STELLATED. 
A PLANE passing 
through 
the MIDPOINTS 
of opposite 
sides 
(perpendic- 
ular 
to a C3 axis) 
cuts the 
cube 
in a regular 
HEXAG- 
ONAL CROSS-SECTION (Gardner 
1960; 
Steinhaus 
1983, 
p. 170; Cundy 
and Rollett 
1989, 
p. 157; Holden 
1991, 
pp. 22-23). 
Since there are four such axes, there are four 
possibly 
hexagonal 
cross-sections. 
If the vertices 
of the 
cube are (fl, 
*l 
k l), then the vertices 
of the inscribed 
HEXAGON are (0, -1, 
-l>, 
(ho,

(171, o), 
(0, 1, 11, 
(-l,O,

and 
(-1, 
-l,O). 
The 
largest 
SQUARE which 
will fit inside 
a cube of side a has each corner 
a distance 
l/4 
from 
a corner 
of a cube. 
The 
resulting 
SQUARE has 
side length 
3&a/4, 
and the cube containing 
that 
side 
is called 
PRINCE RUPERT'S CUBE. 
The 
solid 
formed 
by the faces having 
the sides of the 
STELLA OCTANGULA (left 
figure) 
as DIAGONALS is a 
cube (right 
figure; 
Ball 
and Coxeter 
1987). 
The 
VERTICES of a cube 
of side 
length 
2 with 
face- 
centered 
axes are given 
by (&1,&1,&l). 
If the cube is 
oriented 
with a space diagonal 
along 
the x-axis, 
the coor- 
dinates 
are (0, 0, A), 
(0, 2&@, 
l/d), 
(a, 
J2/3, 
-l/J3), 
(J2,

six 
4-POLYCUBES 
(1

and three 
4-POLYCUBES 
(36+3-4

It is possible 
to cut a 1 x 3 RECTANGLE

Cube 
Duplication 
Also called 
the 
DELIAN 
PROBLEM 
or DUPLICATION 
OF 
THE CUBE. 
A classical 
problem 
of antiquity 
which, 
given 
the 
EDGE 
of a CUBE, 
requires 
a second 
CUBE 
to be 
constructed 
having 
double 
the VOLUME 
of the first using 
only 
a STRAIGHTEDGE 
and COMPASS 
Under 
these restrictions, 
the problem 
cannot 
be solved 
because 
the DELIAN 
CONSTANT 
21/3 (the required 
RA- 
TIO 
of sides of the 
original 
CUBE 
and that 
to be con- 
structed) 
is not a EUCLIDEAN 
NUMBER. 
The 
problem 
can be solved, 
however, 
using 
a NEUSIS

A cubic 
curve 
is an ALGEBRAIC CURVE of degree 
3. 
An 
algebraic 
curve 
over 
a FIELD K 
is an equation 
f(X, 
Y) = 0, where f(X, 
Y) is a POLYNOMIAL in X and 
Y with 
COEFFICIENTS in K, 
and the degree 
of f is the 
MAXIMUM 
degree 
of each of its terms 
(MONOMIALS). 
Newton 
showed 
that 
all cubits 
can be generated 
by the 
projection 
of the five divergent 
cubic 
parabolas. 
New- 
ton’s 
classification 
of cubic 
curves appeared 
in the chap- 
ter “Curves” 
in Lezicolrz Technicurn 
by John 
Harris 
pub- 
lished 
in London 
in 1710. 
Newton 
also classified 
all cu- 
bits 
into 
72 types, 
missing 
six of them. 
In addition, 
he 
showed 
that 
any cubic 
can be obtained 
by a suitable 
projection 
of the ELLIPTIC 
CURVE 
y2 = ax3 + bx2 + cx + d, 
(1) 
where 
the 
projection 
is a BIRATION

TION, 
and the general 
cubi .c can also be written 
as 
y2 = x3 + ax + b.

Pick 
a point 
P, and draw the tangent 
to the curve at P. 
Call the point 
where this tangent 
intersects 
the curve Q. 
Draw another

of intersection 
with 
the curve

Cubic 
Equation 
A cubic 
equation 
is a POLYNOMIAL 
equation 
of degree 
three. 
Given 
a general 
cubic 
equation 
x3 + a2z2 + ulz + a0 = 0 
(1) 
(the 
COEFFICIENT 
a3 ofz3 
may 
be taken 
as 1 without 
loss of generality 
by dividing 
the entire 
equation 
through 
by as), first attempt 
to eliminate 
the a2 term 
by making 
a substitution 
of the form 
Newton’s 
first class is equations 
of the form 
Z-X-X. = 
(2) 
xy’ + ey = ax3 + 6x2 + cx + d. 
(3) 
Then 
This 
is the hardest 
case and i .ncludes 
the SER 
#PENTINE 
CURVE as one of the subcases. 
The 
third 
class was 
ay2 = x(x” 
- 26x + c), 
(4) 
which 
is called 
NEWTON’S 
DIVERGING 
PARABOLAS. 
Newton’s 
66th 
curve 
was the TRIDENT 
OF NEWTON. 
Newton’s 
classification 
of cubits 
was criticized 
by Euler 
because 
it lacked 
generality. 
Plucker 
later 
gave a more 
detailed 
classification 
with 
219 types. 
( x - A>” + az(x 
-X)2+a~(x-X)+ao=0

The 
x2 is eliminated 
by letting 
X = a2/3, 
SO

Then

= 
(x

(7) 
a2z2 = az(x - $a2)’ 
= a2x2 - $a22x + iaz3 
(8) 
alx = a,(x 
- $a2) = alx 
- +a2, 
(9) 
so equation 
(1) becomes

(which 
are identical 
to p and Q up to a constant 
factor). 
The

(12) then

Defining 
Let B and C be, for the moment, 
arbitrary 
constants.

q=

(14) 
x3 - B3 = (x - B)(x2 +Bx+B2). 
(23) 
The general 
cubic 
would 
therefore 
be directly 
factorable 
if it did not 
have an EI: term 
(i.e., 
if Q = 0). 
However, 
since in general 
Q # 0, add a multiple 
of (z - @-say 
C(x-B)-to 
both 
sides of (23) to give the slightly 
messy 
identity 
then 
allows 
(12) to be written 
in the standard 
form 
x3 +px = q. 
(15) 
The 
simplest 
way to proceed 
is to make 
VIETA’S 
SUB- 
( x3-B’)+C(x-B) 
= (x-B)(x2+Bx+B2+C) 
=O, 
(24) 
(16) 
which, 
after regrouping 
terms, 
is 
STITUTION 
P 
x=w-3w7 
x3+Cx-(B3+BC) 
= (x -B)[x2+Bx+(B2+C)] 
= 0. 
(25) 
We would 
now like to match 
the COEFFICIENTS 
C and 
-(B” 
+ BC) 
with 
those 
of equation 
(22), 
so we must 
have 
C = 3Q 
(26) 
which 
reduces 
the cubic 
to the equation 
P3 
w3 - 
- 
27w3 -q=o, 
(17) 
which 
is easily 
turned 
into 
a QUADRATIC 
EQUATION 
in 
w3 by multiplying 
through 
by w3 to obtain 
B3+BC=2R. 
(27) 
(w”)” 
- q(w”) - &p3 = 0 
(18) 
Plugging 
the former 
into 
the latter 
then 
gives 
B3 +- 3QB 
= 2R. 
(28) 
@irkhoff 
and Mac 
Lane 
1965, p. 106). 
The result 
from 
the QUADRATIC 
EQUATION 
is 
Therefore, 
if we can find a value of B satisfying 
the above 
identity, 
we have factored 
a linear 
term 
from 
the cubic, 
thus reducing 
it to a QUADRATIC 
EQUATION. 
The 
trial 
solution 
accomplishing 
this 
miracle 
turns 
out to be the 
symmetrical 
expression 
- - RfdR2+Q3, 
(19) 
B = [R+ 
d3+Rz]1’3 
+ [R- dm]1'3. 
(29) 
where Q and R are are sometimes 
more 
useful 
to deal 
with than 
are p and Q* There 
are therefore 
six solutions 
for w (two corresponding 
to each sign for each ROOT 
of UI”), 
Plugging 
w back 
in to 
(17) gives 
three 
pairs 
of solutions, 
but 
each pair 
is equal, 
so there 
are three 
solutions 
to the cubic 
equation. 
Taking 
the second 
and third 
POWERS 
of B gives 
~~ = [R + dQ3 
+ R2]2’3

- (Q" + R2)]1'3

Equation

may 
also 
be explicitly 
factored 
by at- 
tempting 
to pull 
out a term 
of the form 
(z - B) from 
the 
cubic 
equation, 
leaving 
behind 
a quadratic 
equa- 
tion 
which 
can then 
be factored 
using 
the QUADRATIC 
FORMULA. 
This 
process 
is equivalent 
to making 
Vieta’s 
substitution, 
but 
does a slightly 
better 
job 
of motivat- 
ing Vie t a’s “magic” 
substitution, 
and also at producing 
the explicit 
formulas 
for the solutions. 
First, 
define 
the 
intermediate 
variables

we need 
now only 
factor 
the quadratic

the quadratic 
part 
of (25) and solving 
the 
resulting

a2 = 0, al

The 
equation 
for z1 in CARDANO'S FORMULA does not 
have an i appearing 
in it explicitly 
while 
x2 and z3 do, 
but 
this 
does 
not 
say anything 
about 
the 
number 
of 
REAL and COMPLEX ROOTS (since 
S and T are them- 
selves, 
in general, 
COMPLEX), 
However, 
determining 
which 
ROOTS are REAL and 
which 
are COMPLEX can 
be accomplished 
by noting 
that 
if the DISCRIMINANT 
D > 0, one ROOT is REAL andtwoare 
COMPLEX CON- 
JUGATES; 
if D = 0, all ROOTS are REAL 
and at least 
two are equal; 
and if D < 0, all ROOTS are REAL and 
unequal. 
If D < 0, define 
These 
can be simplified 
by defining 
A E [R + dw]1’3 
- [R - dm]1’3 
(35) 
A2 = [R+ 
JQ3fRz]2’3 
- 2[R2 - (Q3 + R2)]1’3 
+ [R - dm]2’3 
= [R + dm]2’3 
+ [R - dm]2’3 
+ 2Q 
=B~+~Q, 
(36) 
so that 
the solutions 
to the quadratic 
part can be written 
Then 
the REAL solutions 
are of the form

is called 
the HARDY-RAMANUJAN 
NUMBER 
and has spe- 
cial significance 
in the history 
of mathematics 
as a result 
of a story 
told 
by Hardy 
about 
Ramanujan. 
Sloane’s 
A001235 
is defined 
as the 
sequence 
of numbers 
which 
are the sum 
of cubes in two 01” more 
ways, and so ap- 
pears identical 
in the first few terms.

Sloane 
Numbers 
The 
number 
of positive 
cubes 
needed 
to represent 
the 
numbers 
1, 2, 3, . . . are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 1, 2, 3, 4, 
5, 6, 7, 8, 2, . . . (Sloane’s 
A02376), 
and the number 
of 
distinct 
ways to represent 
the numbers 
1, 2, 3, . . . in 
terms 
of positive 
cubes 
are 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 
2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 3, 37 3, 3, 3, 4, 4, 4, 5, 5, 5, 5, 
. (Sloane’s 
A003108). 
In the early 
twentieth 
century, 
Dickson, 
Pillai, 
and Niven 
proved 
that 
every 
POSITIVE 
INTEGER 
is the sum of not 
more 
than 
nine 
CUBES 
(so 
g(3) 
= 9 in WARING’S 
PROBLEM). 
In 1939, Dickson 
proved 
that 
the only 
INTEGERS 
requir- 
ing nine 
CUBES 
are 23 and 239. 
Wieferich 
proved 
that 
only 
15 INTEGERS 
require 
eight 
CUBES: 
15, 22, 50, 114, 
167, 175, 186, 212, 213, 238, 303, 364, 420, 428, and 454 
(Sloane’s 
A018889). 
The 
quantity 
G(3) 
in WARING’S 
PROBLEM 
therefore 
satisfies 
G(3) 
< 7, and the largest 
number 
known 
requiring 
seven cubes is 8042, 
The 
fol- 
lowing 
table 
gives the first 
few numbers 
which 
require 
at least N = 1, 2, 3, . . . , 9 (positive) 
cubes to represent 
them 
as a sum.

Dudeney 
found 
two RATIONAL 
NUMBERS 
other 
than 
1 
and 2 whose cubes sum to 9, 
415280564497 
and 
676702467503 
348671682660 
348671682660’ 
(4) 
The problem 
of finding 
two RATIONAL 
NUMBERS 
whose 
cubes sum to six was “proved” 
impossible 
by Legendre. 
However, 
Dudeney 
found 
the simple 
solutions 
17/21 
and 
37/21. 
The only 
three 
consecutive 
INTEGERS 
whose cubes sum 
to a cube are given 
by the DIOPHANTINE 
EQUATION 
33 + 43 + 53 = 63. 
(5) 
CATALAN'S 
CONJECTURE 
states 
that 
8 and 
9 (2” and 
32) are the only 
consecutive 
POWERS 
(excluding 
0 and 
l), 
i.e., the only 
solution 
to CATALAN'S 
D~OPHANTINE 
PROBLEM. 
This 
CONJECTTJRE 
has not yet been proved 
or refuted, 
although 
R. Tijdeman 
has proved 
that 
there 
can be only 
a finite 
number 
of exceptions 
should 
the 
CONJECTURE 
not hold. 
It is also known 
that 
8 and 9 
are the only 
consecutive 
cubic 
and 
SQUARE 
NUMBERS 
(in either 
order). 
There 
are six POSITIVE 
INTEGERS 
equal 
to the sum of 
the DIGITS 
of their 
cubes: 
1, 8, 17, 18, 26, and 27 (Moret 
Blanc 
1879). 
There 
are four POSITIVE 
INTEGERS 
equal 
to the sums of the cubes of their 
digits: 
153 = l3 + 53 + 33 
(6) 
370 = 33 + 73 + o3 
(7) 
371 = 33 + 7” + l3 
(8) 
407 = 43 + o3 + 73 
(9) 
(Ball 
and Coxeter 
1987). 
There 
are two SQUARE 
NUM- 
BERS of the form n3 -4: 
4 = 23 -4 
and 121 = 53 -4 
(Le 
Lionnais 
1983). 
A cube cannot 
be the concatenation 
of 
two cubes, 
since if c3 is the concatenation 
of a3 and b3, 
then 
c3 = 10”a3 
+ b3, where 
Fz is the number 
of digits 
in b3. After 
shifting 
any powers 
of 1000 in 10” into 
u3, 
the original 
problem 
is equivalent 
to finding 
a solution 
to oneof 
the DIOPHANTINE 
EQUATIONS 
c3 - b3 = a3 
c3 - b3 = 10a3 
c3 - b” = 100a3. 
w 
(11) 
(12) 
None 
of these 
have solutions 
in integers, 
as proved 
in- 
dependently 
by Sylvester, 
Lucas, 
and 
Pepin 
(Dickson 
1966, pp. 572-578).

SchlUi 
and 
Cayley 
classified 
the 
singular 
cubic 
surfaces. 
On 
the 
general 
cubic, 
there 
exists 
a curious 
geometrical 
struc- 
ture 
called 
DOUBLE 
SIXES, 
and 
also 
a particular 
ar- 
rangement 
of 27 (possibly 
complex) 
lines, 
as discovered 
by Schlgfli 
(Salmon 
1965, Fischer 
1986) 
and sometimes 
called 
SOLOMON’S 
SEAL LINES. 
A nonregular 
cubic sur- 
face can contain 
3, 7, 15, or 27 real lines 
(Segre 
1942, 
Le Lionnais 
1983). 
The 
CLEBSCH 
DIAGONAL 
CUBIC 
contains 
all possible 
27. The 
maximum 
number 
of OR- 
DINARY 
DOUBLE 
POINTS 
on a cubic 
surface is four, 
and 
the unique 
cubic 
surface 
having 
four 
ORDINARY 
DOU- 
BLE POINTS 
is the CAYLEY 
CUBIC. 
Schoutte 
(1910) 
showed 
that 
the 
27 lines 
can be put 
into a ONE-TO-ONE 
correspondence 
with 
the vertices 
of 
a particular 
POLYTOPE 
in 6-D space in such a manner 
that 
all incidence 
relations 
between 
the 
lines 
are mir- 
rored 
in the 
connectivity 
of the 
POLYTOPE 
and 
con- 
versely 
(Du 
Val 
1931). 
A similar 
correspondence 
can 
be made 
between 
the 28 bitangents 
of the general 
plane 
QUARTIC 
CURVE 
and a 7-D POLYTOPE 
(Coxeter 
1928) 
and between 
the tritangent 
planes 
of the canonical 
curve 
of genus 4 and an 8-D POLYTOPE 
(Du Val 1933). 
A 
smooth 
cubic 
surface 
contains 
45 
TRITANGENTS 
(Hunt). 
The 
Hessian 
of smooth 
cubic 
surface 
contains 
at least 
10 ORDINARY 
DOUBLE 
POINTS, 
although 
the 
Hessian 
of the CAYLEY 
CUBIC 
contains 
14 (Hunt).

A BINOMIAL

of the form 
C*(b,

E bn * 
1. 
Bases b” which 
are themselves 
powers need not be con- 
sidered 
since they 
correspond 
to (bk)” 
& 1 = b”” * 1. 
PRIME 
NUMBERS 
of the form 
C*(b, 
n) are very rare. 
A 
NECESSARY 
(but 
not 
SUFFICIENT) 
condition 
for 
c+ c&n> 
= 
2n + 1 to be PRIME 
is that 
n be of the 
form 
n = 2? 
Numbers 
of the form 
Fm = C+(2,2”) 
= 
22m + 1 are called 
FERMAT 
NUMBERS, 
and 
the 
only 
known 
PRIMES 
occur 
for C+(2,1) 
= 3, C+(2,2) 
= 5, 
Cf(2,4) 
= 17, C+(2,8) 
= 257, and Cf(2, 
16) = 65537 
( i.e., 
n 
= 
0, 
1, 2, 3, 4). 
The 
only 
other 
PRIMES 
C+ (b, n) for nontrivial 
b 5 11 and 2 5 n 5 1000 are 
Cs(6, 
2) = 37, @(6,4) 
= 1297, and C+(lO, 
2) = 101. 
PRIMES 
of the form 
C-(b, 
n) are also very rare. 
The 
MERSENNE 
NUMBERS 
AL?* = 
C-(2,n) 
= 
2n - 1 are 
known 
to be prime 
only 
for 37 values, 
the 
first 
few 
of which 
are n = 
2, 3, 5, 7, 13, 17, 19, 
l . . (Sloane’s 
A000043). 
There 
are no other 
PRIMES 
C-(b, 
n) for non- 
trivial 
b 2 20 and 2 2 n 2 1000. 
In 1925, Cunningham 
and Woodall 
(1925) 
gathered 
to- 
gether 
all 
that 
was known 
about 
the 
PRIMALITY 
and 
factorization 
of the numbers 
C*(b, 
n) and published 
a 
small 
book 
of tables. 
These 
tables 
collected 
from 
scat- 
tered sources the known 
prime 
factors 
for the bases 2 and 
10 and also presented 
the authors’ 
results 
of 30 years’ 
work with 
these and other 
bases. 
Since 1925, many 
people 
have worked 
on filling 
in these 
tables. 
D. H. Lehmer, 
a well-known 
mathematician 
who 
died in 1991, was for many 
years a leader 
of these efforts. 
Lehmer 
was a mathematician 
who was at the forefront 
of computing 
as modern 
electronic 
computers 
became 
a reality. 
He was also known 
as the inventor 
of some 
ingenious 
pre-electronic 
computing 
devices 
specifically 
designed 
for factoring 
numbers. 
Updated 
factorizations 
were published 
in Brillhart 
et al. 
(1988). 
The current 
archive 
of Cunningham 
number 
fac- 
torizations 
for b = 1, . . . , &12 
is kept 
on ftp://sable. 
ox, ac . uk/pub/math/cunningham. 
The tables 
have been 
extended 
by Brent 
and te Riele 
(1992) 
to b = 13, . . . , 
100 with 
m < 255 for b < 30 and m < 100 for b 2 30. 
All numbers 
with exponent 
58 and smaller, 
and all com- 
posites 
with 
5 90 digits 
have now been factored.

The curlicue 
fractal 
is a figure 
obtained 
by the following 
procedure. 
Let s be an IRRATIONAL 
NUMBER. 
Begin 
with 
a line segment 
of unit 
length, 
which 
makes 
an AN- 
GLE 40 = 0 to the horizontal. 
Then 
define 
8, iteratively 
8 n+l 
= (0, 
+ 2~s) (mod 
2~), 
with 
80 = 0. To the end of the previous 
line 
segment, 
draw a line segment 
of unit 
length 
which makes 
an angle 
to the horizontal 
(Pickover 
1995). 
The result 
is a FRAC- 
TAL, 
and the 
above 
figures 
correspond 
to the curlicue

Curvature 
In 
general, 
there 
are 
two 
important 
types 
of curva- 
ture: 
EXTRINSIC 
CURVATURE 
and 
INTRINSIC 
CURVA- 
TURE. 
The 
EXTRINXC 
CURVATURE 
of curves in 2- and 
3-space was the first type 
of curvature 
to be studied 
his- 
torically, 
culminating 
in the FRENET 
FORMULAS, 
which 
describe 
a SPACE 
CURVE 
entirely 
in terms 
of its “cur- 
vature,” 
TORSION, 
and 
the 
initial 
starting 
point 
and 
direction. 
After 
the curvature 
of 2- and 
3-D curves 
was studied, 
attention 
turned 
to the curvature 
of surfaces 
in 3-space. 
The 
main 
curvatures 
which 
emerged 
from 
this 
scrutiny 
are the MEAN 
CURVATURE, 
GAUSSIAN 
CURVATURE, 
and 
the 
WEINGARTEN 
MAP. 
MEAN 
CURVATURE 
was the 
most 
important 
for applications 
at the 
time 
and 
was 
the most 
studied, 
but 
Gauss 
was the first 
to recognize 
the importance 
of the 
GAUSSIAN 
CURVATURE. 
Because 
GAUSSIAN 
CURVATURE 
is “intrinsic,” 
it is de- 
tectable 
to Sdimensional 
“inhabitants” 
of the surface, 
whereas 
MEAN 
CURVATURE 
and the WEINGARTEN 
MAP 
are not 
detectable 
to someone 
who can’t 
study 
the 3- 
dimensional 
space surrounding 
the surface 
on which 
he 
resides. 
The 
importance 
of GAUSSIAN 
CURVATURE 
to 
an inhabitant 
is that 
it controls 
the surface 
AREA 
of 
SPHERES 
around 
the inhabitant. 
Riemann 
and 
many 
others 
generalized 
the 
concept 
of 
curvature 
to SECTIONAL 
CURVATURE, 
SCALAR 
CURVA- 
TURE, 
the 
RIEMANN 
TENSOR, 
RICCI 
CURVATURE, 
and 
a host of other 
INTRINSIC 
and EXTRINSIC 
CURVATURES. 
General 
curvatures 
no longer 
need to be numbers, 
and 
can take the form 
of a MAP, 
GROUP, 
GROUPOID, 
tensor 
field, 
etc. 
The 
simplest 
form 
of curvature 
and 
that 
usually 
first 
encountered 
in CALCULUS 
is an EXTRINSIC 
CURVATURE. 
In 
2-Q 
let a PLANE 
CURVE 
be given 
by 
CARTESIAN 
parametric 
equations 
z = z(t) 
and y = y(t). 
Then 
the 
curvature 
K is defined 
by 
dt 
-- 
ds 
- 
dt 
(1) 
where q5 is the POLAR 
ANGLE 
and s is the ARC 
LENGTH. 
As can readily 
be seen from 
the 
definition, 
curvature 
therefore 
has units 
of inverse 
distance. 
The 
dqb/dt 
de- 
rivative 
in the above equation 
can be eliminated 
by using 
the identity

For a 2-D curve written 
in the form 
y = f(x), 
the equa- 
tion 
of curvature 
becomes 
3/2 
l 
(6) 
If the 2-D curve is instead 
parameterized 
in POLAR 
CO- 
ORDINATES, 
then 
~ _ T2 + 27x2 - TTeo 
- 
(7-2 + r82)3/2

(7) 
where 
TO = 
Br/dO 
(Gray 
1993). 
In 
PEDAL 
COORDI- 
NATES, 
the curvature 
is given 
by

The 
curvature 
for 
a 2-D 
curve 
given 
implicitly 
by 
g(x,y) 
= 0 is given 
by

29x,9x9, 
+ 
9YYh2 
(9x2 
+

(Gray 
1993).

Now consider 
a parameterized 
SPACE 
CURVE 
r(t) 
in 3-D 
for which 
the TANGENT 
VECTOR 
* is defined 
as 
(10) 
Therefore, 
dr 
d”+

where 
R is the NORMAL

The curvature 
of a 2-D curve is related 
to the RADIUS OF 
CURVATURE of the curve’s 
OSCULATING CIRCLE. Con- 
sider 
a CIRCLE specified 
parametrically 
by 
x = acost 
(16) 
y = mini5 
(17) 
which 
is tangent 
to the 
curve 
at a given 
point. 
The 
curvature 
is then 
K = 
c2t2 
+ 
yt2)3/2 
= 
~3 
- 
a’ 
(18) 
or one over the RADIUS OF CVRVATURE. The 
curvature 
of a CIRCLE can also be repeated 
in vector 
notation 
For 
the CIRCLE with 
0 5 t < 2~, the ARC LENGTH is 
s(t) 
= l /G,” + G)2dt 
a2 cos2 t 
+ a2 sin2 t dt = at, 
(19) 
so t = 
s/a 
and 
the 
equations 
of the CIRCLE can be 
rewritten 
as 
x=ucos 
5 
0 U 
(20) 
y = asin

0 U 
The POSITION VECTOR is then

Curvature 
Four 
very important 
derivative 
relations 
in differential 
geometry 
related 
to the FRENET FORMULAS are 
k=T 
(25) 
if=kGN 
(26) 
F=~N+K(~B-KT) 
(27) 
[e, i;, ;;‘I = K2T, 
(28) 
where T is the 
TANGENT 
VECTOR, N is the NORMAL 
VECTOR, 
B is the BINORMAL VECTOR, and 
7 is the 
TORSION (Coxeter 
1969, 
p. 322). 
The curvature 
at a point 
on a surface 
takes 
on a variety 
of values 
as the PLANE through 
the normal 
varies. 
As 
K varies, 
it achieves 
a minimum 
and a maximum 
(which 
are in perpendicular 
directions) 
known 
as the PRINCIPAL 
CURVATURES. As shown in Coxeter 
(1969, pp. 352-353), 
IE2 - x 
bftc + det(bi) 
= 0 
(29) 
K2 -~HIE+K=O, 
(30) 
where K is the GAUSSIAN CURVATURE, H is the MEAN 
CURVATURE, and det denotes 
the DETERMINANT. 
The curvature 
K is sometimes 
called 
the FIRST CURVA- 
TURE and the TORSION 7 the SECOND CURVATURE. In 
addition, 
a THIRD CURVATURE (sometimes 
called 
TO- 
TAL CURVATURE) 
&&-zT 
(31) 
is also defined. 
A signed 
version 
of the curvature 
of a 
CIRCLE 
appearinginthe 
DESCARTES CIRCLE THEOREM 
for the 
radius 
of the 
fourth 
of four 
mutually 
tangent 
circles 
is called 
the BEND.

Curve 
of Constant

Curves 
which, 
when rotated 
in a square, 
make 
contact 
with 
all 
four 
sides. 
The 
“width” 
of a closed 
convex 
curve 
is defined 
as the distance 
between 
parallel 
lines 
bounding 
it (“supporting 
lines”). 
Every 
curve 
of con- 
stant 
width 
is convex. 
Curves 
of constant 
width 
have 
the same “width” 
regardless 
of their 
orientation 
between 
the parallel 
lines. 
In fact, they also share the same PER- 
IMETER 
( BARBIER’S 
THEOREM). 
Examples 
include 
the 
CIRCLE 
(with largest 
AREA), 
and REULEAUX 
TRIANGLE 
(with 
smallest 
AREA) but 
there 
are an infinite 
number. 
A curve 
of constant 
width 
can be used in a special 
drill 
chuck 
to cut square 
“HOLES." 
A generalization 
gives solids 
of constant 
width. 
These 
do not have the same 
surface 
AREA 
for a given 
width, 
but their 
shadows 
are curves of constant 
width 
with the 
same width!

CW-Approximation 
Theorem 
If X is any SPACE, then 
there 
is a CW-COMPLEX 
Y 
and a MAP 
f : Y -+ X inducing 
ISOMORPHISMS on all 
HOMOTOPYJIOMOLOGY, 
and COHOMOLOGY~~~U~~. 
CW-Complex 
A CW-complex 
is a homotopy-theoretic 
generalization 
of the 
notion 
of a SIMPLICIAL 
COMPLEX. 
A CW- 
complex 
is any SPACE X which 
can be built 
by starting 
off with 
a discrete 
collection 
of points 
called 
X0, 
then 
attaching 
1-D DISKS D1 to X0 
along 
their 
boundaries 
So, writing 
X1 for the object 
obtained 
by attaching 
the 
D’s 
to X0, 
then 
attaching 
2-D DISKS D2 to X1 
along 
their 
boundaries 
S1, writing 
X2 for the new SPACE, and 
so on, giving 
spaces Xn 
for every 
n. 
A CW-complex 
is any SPACE that 
has this 
sort of decomposition 
into 
SUBSPACES Xn 
built 
up in such a hierarchical 
fashion 
(so the X”s 
must 
exhaust 
all of X). 
In particular, 
Xn 
may 
be built 
from 
X”-l 
by attaching 
infinitely 
many 
n-DISKS, 
and the attaching 
MAPS S"-' 
--+ Xnvl 
may 
be any continuous 
MAPS.

The 
main 
importance 
of CW-complexes 
is that, 
for 
the 
sake of HOMOTOPY, 
HOMOLOGY, 
and 
COHOMOL- 
OGY groups, 
every 
SPACE 
is a CW-complex. 
This 
is 
called 
the 
CW-APPROXIMATION 
THEOREM. 
Another 
is WHITEHEAD%

which 
says that 
MAPS

that 
induce

A cycle 
graph 
is a GRAPH 
which 
shows 
cycles 
of a 
GROUP 
as well as the connectivity 
between 
the cycles. 
Several 
examples 
are shown 
above. 
For 24, the group 
elements 
Ai satisfy 
Ai 
= 1, where 
1 is the 
IDENTITY 
ELEMENT, 
and two elements 
satisfy 
Al2 
= As2 
= 1. 
For a CYCLIC 
GROUP 
of COMPOSITE 
ORDER 
?Z (e.g., 
24, &, 
&), 
the degenerate 
subcycles 
corresponding 
to 
factors 
dividing 
rz are often 
not 
shown 
explicitly 
since 
their 
presence 
is implied.

Cycle 
(Map) 
An n-cycle 
is a finite 
sequence 
of points 
Yo, . . l , Y,-l 
such that, 
under 
a MAP 
G, 
Yt = G(G) 
Yz 
= 
G(K) 
K-1 
= 
G(K-2) 
Y. 
= G(Y,-1). 
In other 
words, 
it is a periodic 
trajectory 
which 
comes 
back 
to the same 
point 
after 
72 iterations 
of the cycle. 
Every 
point 
Yj of the cycle satisfies 
Yj = G” (Yj) 
and is 
therefore 
a FIXED 
POINT 
of the mapping 
Gn. 
A fixed 
point 
of G is simply 
a CYCLE 
of period 
1. 
Cycle 
(Permutation) 
A SUBSET 
of a PERMUTATION 
whose 
elements 
trade 
places 
with 
one another. 
A cycle 
decomposition 
of a 
PERMUTATION 
can therefore 
be viewed 
as a CLASS of 
a PERMUTATION 
GROUP. 
For 
example, 
in the 
PER- 
MUTATION 
GROUP 
(4, 
2, 1, 3}, 
{l, 
3, 4) is a 3-cycle 
(1 + 
3, 3 -+ 
4, and 
4 + 
I) 
and 
(2) 
is a l-cycle 
(2 + 
2). 
Every 
PERMUTATION 
GROUP 
on n symbols 
can be uniquely 
expressed 
as a product 
of disjoint 
cycles. 
The 
cyclic 
decomposition 
of a PERMUTATION 
can be 
computed 
in Mathematic@ 
(Wolfram 
Research, 
Cham- 
paign, 
IL) 
with 
the function 
ToCycles 
and the PERMU- 
TATION 
corresponding 
to a cyclic 
decomposition 
can be 
computed 
with 
FromCycles. 
According 
to Vardi 
(1991), 
the Mathematics 
code for ToCycles 
is one of the most 
obscure 
ever written. 
To find 
the number 
N(m, 
n) of nz cycles in a PERMU-

Cyclic 
groups 
are 
both 
ABELIAN

There 
exists a unique 
cyclic 
group 
of every order 
n 2 2, so cyclic 
groups 
of the same

are always 
isomorphic 
(Shanks

all GROUPS

Cyclic 
Polygon 
A cyclic 
polygon 
is a POLYGON with 
VERTICES 
upon 
which 
a CIRCLE can be CIRCUMSCRIBED. 
Since 
every 
TRIANGLE 
has a CIRCUMCIRCLE, 
every 
TRIANGLE is 
cyclic. 
It 
is conjectured 
that 
for a cyclic 
polygon 
of 
2771 + 1 sides, 
16K2 
(where 
K is the AREA) satisfies 
a 
MONIC POLYNOMIAL of degree 
Am, 
where 
(1) 
= i 
[(2m+l)(z) 
-22-] 
(2) 
(Robbins 
1995). 
It is also conjectured 
that 
a cyclic poly- 
gon with 
2nz+ 2 sides satisfies 
one of two POLYNOMIALS 
of degree 
A,. 
The 
first 
few values 
of A, 
are 1, 7, 38, 
187, 874, . . . (Sloane’s 
AOOO531). 
For TRIANGLES (n = 3 = 2 l l+ 
1), the POLYNOMIAL is 
HERON'S FORMULA, which 
may 
be written 
16K2 
= 2a2b2 + 2a2c2 -p 2b2C2 - a4 - b4 - c4, 
(3) 
and which 
is of order 
A, 
= 1 in 16K2. 
For a CYCLIC 
QUADRILATERAL, the POLYNOMIAL is BRAHMAGUPTA'S 
FORMULA, which 
may be written 
16K2 
= -a4 
+ 2a2b2 - b4 + 2a2c2 + 2b2c2 - c4 
+ 8abcd + 2a2d2 + 2b2d2 + 2C2d2 - d4, 
(4) 
which 
is of order 
A, 
= 
1 in 
16K2.

three

In addition

T. It is given

A is given 
by a = 25, b = 33, c = 39, d = 65, p = 
60, 
q = 52, R = 6512, and A = 1344. 
Let AHBO 
be a QUADRILATERAL 
such that 
the angles 
LHAB 
and LHOB 
are RIGHT ANGLES, then 
AHBO 
is 
a cyclic quadrilateral 
(Dunham 
1990). 
This 
is a COROL-

it is equidis-

Cycloid 
The cycloid 
is the locus of a point 
on the rim of a CIRCLE 
of RADIUS 
a rolling 
along 
a straight 
LINE. 
It was studied 
and 
named 
by Galileo 
in 1599. 
Galileo 
attempted 
to 
find the AREA 
by weighing 
pieces of metal 
cut into 
the 
shape 
of the cycloid. 
Torricelli, 
Fermat, 
and Descartes 
all found 
the AREA. 
The 
cycloid 
was also studied 
by 
Roberval 
in 1634, Wren, in 1658, Huygens 
in 1673, and 
Johann 
8ernoulli 
in 1696. 
Roberval 
and Wren 
found 
the 
ARC LENGTH 
(MacTutor 
Archive). 
Gear teeth were also 
made 
out of cycloids, 
as first proposed 
by Desargues 
in 
the 1630s (Cundy 
and Rollett 
1989). 
In 1696, Johann 
Bernoulli 
challenged 
other 
mathemati- 
cians 
to find 
the 
curve 
which 
solves 
the 
BRACHISTO- 
CHRONE 
PROBLEM, 
knowing 
the 
solution 
to be a cy- 
cloid. 
Leibniz, 
Newton, 
Jakob 
Bernoulli 
and L’Hospital 
all solved 
Bernoulli’s 
challenge. 
The 
cycloid 
also solves 
the TAUTOCHRONE 
PROBLEM. 
Because 
of the frequency 
with 
which 
it provoked 
quarrels 
among 
mathematicians 
in the 
17th 
century, 
the cycloid 
became 
known 
as the 
“Helen 
of Geometers” 
(Boyer 
1968, p. 389). 
The cycloid 
is the CATACAUSTIC 
of a CIRCLE 
for a RA- 
DIANT 
POINT 
on the circumference, 
as shown 
by Jakob 
and Johann 
Bernoulli 
in 1692. 
The 
CAUSTIC 
of the cy- 
cloid 
when the rays are parallel 
to the y-axis 
is a cycloid 
with 
twice 
as many 
arches.

to solving 
a 
series of QUADRATIC 
EQUATIONS 
whenever

Wantzel

showed that 
this condition 
is not only 
SUFFICIENT,

Cylinder 
Cylinder 
Function 
Cylinder 
A cylinder 
is a solid of circular 
CROSS-SECTION in which 
the centers 
of the 
CIRCLES 
all lie on a single LINE. The 
cylinder 
was extensively 
studied 
by Archimedes 
in his 
2-volume 
work 
On the Sphere 
and 
Cylinder 
in cit. 225 
BC. 
A cylinder 
is called 
a right 
cylinder 
if it is “straight” 
in the 
sense that 
its cross-sections 
lie directly 
on top 
of each other; 
otherwise, 
the cylinder 
is called 
oblique. 
The 
surface 
of a cylinder 
of height 
h and RADIUS T can 
be described 
parametrically 
by 
2 
= 
rcose 
(1) 
y 
= 
T sin 0 
(2) 
z = z, 
(3) 
for z f [0, h] and 0 E [0,2~). 
These 
are the basis for 
CYLINDRICAL 
COORDINATES. The SURFACE AREA (of 
the sides) 
and VOLUME of the cylinder 
of height 
h and 
RADIUS T are 
S = 2mh 
(4) 
V = nr’h. 
(5) 
Therefore, 
if top 
and 
bottom 
caps 
are 
added, 
the 
volume-to-surface 
area ratio 
for a cylindrical 
container 
is 
V 
s= 
(6) 
which 
is related 
to the HARMONIC 
MEAN of the radius 
T and height 
h.

Cylindrical 
Coordinates 
Cylindrical 
coordinates 
are a generalization 
of Z-D PO- 
LAR COORDINATES 
to 3-D by superposing 
a height 
(z) 
axis. 
Unfortunately, 
there 
are a number 
of different 
no- 
tations 
used for the other 
two coordinates. 
Either 
T or 
p is used to refer to the radial 
coordinate 
and either 
4 
or B to the azimuthal 
coordinates. 
A&en 
(1985), 
for 
instance, 
uses (p, 4, z), while 
Beyer 
(1987) 
uses (T, 8, z). 
In this work, 
the NOTATION 
(T, 8, z) is used.

The SPHERES can be used to show that

Pick

Call

Because

Lemma 
The 
DISCRETE 
FOURIER 
TRANSFORM 
of length 
N 
(where 
IV is EVEN) 
can be rewritten 
as the sum of two 
DISCRETE 
FOURIER 
TRANSFORMS, 
each of length 
N/2. 
One 
is formed 
from 
the 
EVEN 
numbered 
points; 
the 
other 
from 
the ODD numbered 
points. 
Denote 
the I&h 
point 
of the 
DISCRETE 
FOURIER 
TRANSFORM 
by Fn.

where 
W = e-2Ti’N 
and 72 = 0,. . . , N. 
This 
procedure 
can be applied 
recursively 
to break 
up the 
N/2 
even 
and 
ODD 
points 
to their 
N/4 
EVEN 
and 
ODD 
points. 
If Iv 
is a POWER 
of 2, this 
procedure 
breaks 
up the 
original 
transform 
into lg N transforms 
of length 
1. Each 
transform 
of an individual 
point 
has Fi”““’

some

By reversing 
the patterns 
of evens and odds, 
then 
letting 
e = 0 and o = 1, the value 
of Fz in BINARY 
is produced. 
This 
is the basis 
for the

is a formal 
set-up 
for the analytic 
problem: 
If you have a DIFFERENTIAL 
&FORM w on a 
MANIFOLD i'W, is it the EXTERIOR DERIVATIVE of an- 
other 
DIFFERENTIAL 
&FORM w’? Formally, 
if w = dw’ 
then 
dw = 0. This 
is more 
commonly 
stated 
as dad = 0, 
meaning 
that 
if w is to be the EXTERIOR DERIVATIVE of

NECESSARY condition

satisfy 
is that 
its EXTERIOR DERIVATIVE is zero.

de Rham 
cohomology 
gives 
a formalism 
that 
aims 
to 
answer 
the question, 
“Are 
all differential 
k-forms 
on a 
MANIFOLD 
with 
zero EXTERIOR DERIVATIVE the Ex- 
TERIOR DERIVATIVES of (k + 1)-forms?” 
In particular, 
the kth de Rham 
cohomology 
vector 
space is defined 
to 
be the space of all k-forms 
with EXTERIOR DERIVATIVE 
0, modulo 
the space of all boundaries 
of (k + 1)-forms. 
This 
is the trivial 
VECTOR SPACE IFF the answer to our 
question 
is yes. 
The 
fundamental 
result 
about 
de Rham 
cohomology 
is that 
it is a topological 
invariant 
of the MANIFOLD, 
namely: 
the kth 
de Rham 
cohomology 
VECTOR SPACE 
of a MANIFOLD 
A4 is canonically 
isomorphic 
to 
the 
ALEXANDER-SPANIER 
COHOMOLOGY VECTOR SPACE

Decimal 
Expansion 
The decimal 
expansion 
of a number 
is its representation 
in base 10. For example, 
the decimal 
expansion 
of 252 
is 625, of n is 3.14159.. 
. , and of l/9 
is 0.1111.. 
l .

FACTORING possible 
common 
multiples 
gives 
P 
’ = 2a5Py 
(2) 
where 
p $ 0 (mod 
2, 5). 
Therefore, 
the numbers 
with 
finite 
decimal 
expansions 
are fractions 
of this form. 
The 
number 
of decimals 
is given 
by max(q 
p). 
Numbers 
which have a finite 
decimal 
expansion 
are called 
REGU- 
LARNUMBERS. 
Any NONREGULAR fraction 
m/n 
is periodic, 
and has a 
period 
x(n) 
independent 
of m, which 
is at most 
n - 1 
DIGITS long. If n is RELATIVELY PRIME to 10,thenthe 
period 
of m/n 
is a divisor 
of 4(n) 
and has at most 
4(n) 
DIGITS, where 4 is the TOTIENT 
FUNCTION. 
When 
a 
rational 
number 
m/n 
with 
(m, n) = 1 is expanded, 
the 
period 
begins 
after 
s terms 
and 
has length 
t, where 
s 
and t are the smallest 
numbers 
satisfying 
IO2 E 109+t 
(mod 
n) . 
(3) 
When 
n $ 
0 (mod 
2, 5), s = 0, and 
this 
becomes 
a 
purely 
periodic 
decimal 
with 
10t = 1 (mod 
n). 
(4) 
As an example, 
consider 
n = 84. 
loo = 1 
lo1 E 10 
lo2 G 16 
lo3 E -8 
lo4 ~4 
lo5 ~40 
lo6 E -20 
lo7 = -32, 
lo8 E 16

Decimal 
Expansion 
Decimal 
Expansion 
so s = 2, t = 6. The 
decimal 
representation 
is l/84 
= 
0.01190476. 
When 
the DENOMINATOR of a fraction 
m/n 
has the form 
n = no2&5O 
with 
(noJO> 
= 1, then 
the 
period 
begins 
after 
max(aJ) 
terms 
and 
the length 
of 
the period 
is the exponent 
to which 10 belongs 
(mod 
no), 
i.e., the number 
z such that 
10” = 1 (mod 
no). 
If Q is 
PRIME and X(q) 
is EVEN, then 
breaking 
the repeating 
DIGITS into 
two equal 
halves 
and 
adding 
gives 
all 9s. 
For example, 
l/7 
= 
0.142857, 
and 
142 + 857 = 
999. 
For l/q 
with 
a PRIME DENOMINATOR other 
than 
2 or 5, 
all cycles n/q 
have the same 
length 
(Conway 
and 
Guy 
1996). 
If n is a PRIME and 10 is a PRIMITIVE ROOT of n, then 
the period 
A(n) of the repeating 
decimal 
l/n 
is given 
by 
qn> 
= fP(47 
(5) 
where 
qS(n) is the TOTIENT 
FUNCTION. 
Furthermore, 
the decimal 
expansions 
for p/n, 
with 
p = 1, 2, 
l 
l . , n - 1 
have periods 
of length 
n - 1 and differ 
only 
by a cyclic 
permutation. 
Such 
numbers 
are called 
LONG 
PRIMES 
by Conway 
and Guy 
(1996). 
An equivalent 
definition 
is 
that 
1Oi = 1 (mod 
n) 
(6) 
for i = n - 1 and no i less than 
this. 
In other 
words, 
a 
NECESSARY (but 
not SUFFICIENT) condition 
is that 
the 
number 
9R,-l 
(where 
R, 
is a REPUNIT) is DIVISIBLE 
by n, which 
means 
that 
R, 
is DIVISIBLE by n. 
The first few numbers 
with maximal 
decimal 
expansions, 
called 
FULL REPTEND PRIMES, are 7, 17, 19, 23, 29, 
47, 59, 61, 97, 
109, 
113, 
131, 
149, 167, 
. . . (Sloane’s 
A001913). 
The 
decimals 
corresponding 
to these 
are 
called 
CYCLIC NUMBERS. No general 
method 
is known 
for finding 
FULL REPTEND PRIMES. Artin 
conjectured 
that 
ARTIN'S 
CONSTANT C = 0.3739558136.. 
. is the 
fraction 
of PRIMES p for with 
l/p 
has decimal 
maximal 
period 
(Conway 
and Guy 
1996). 
D. Lehmer 
has gen- 
eralized 
this conjecture 
to other 
bases, obtaining 
values 
which 
are small 
rational 
multiples 
of C. 
TO find DENOMINATORS with 
short 
periods, 
note that 
lo1 - 1 = 32 
lo2 - 1 = 32 ml1 
lo3 - 1 = 33 ’ 37 
lo4 - 1 = 32 ’ 11’ 101 
lo5 - 1 = 32 .41 
l 271 
lo6 - 1 = 33 
l 7 ’ 11 
l 13 
l 37 
lo7 - 1 = 32 
l 239 
n 4649 
lo8 - 1 = 32 
l 11’ 73 
l 101’ 
137 
10’ - 1 = 34 
l 37 
l 333667 
1o1O - 1 = 32 
l 11.41.271.9091 
loll 
- 1 = 32 
l 21649.513239 
1o12 - 1 = 33 ’ 7.11.13.37 
* 101’ 9901. 
The 
period 
of a fraction 
with DENOMINATOR equal 
to a 
PRIME FACTOR 
above 
is therefore 
the POWER of 10 in 
which 
the factor 
first appears. 
For example, 
37 appears 
in the factorization 
of 103 - 1 and 10’ - 1, so its period 
is 3. Multiplication 
of any FACTOR by a 2”5@ still 
gives 
the 
same period 
as the FACTOR alone. 
A DENOMINA- 
TOR obtained 
by a multiplication 
of two FACTORS has 
a period 
equal to the first POWER of 10 in which 
b&h 
FACTORS appear. 
The following 
table 
gives the PRIMES 
having 
small 
periods

Decreasing 
finct 
ion 
A function 
f(z) 
d ecreases 
on an INTERVAL 
1 if f(b) 
< 
f(a) 
for all b > a, where a, b E I. 
Conversely, 
a function 
f(z) 
increases 
on an INTERVAL I if f(b) 
> f(a) 
for all 
b>awitha,bfI. 
If the DERIVATIVE f'(z) 
of a CONTINUOUS FUNCTION 
f(z) 
satisfies 
f’(z) 
< 0 on an OPEN 
INTERVAL (a$), 
then 
f(z) 
is decreasing 
on (a, b). 
However, 
a fupction 
may decrease 
on an interval 
without 
having 
a derivative 
defined 
at all points. 
For example, 
the function 
-z113 
is decreasing 
everywhere, 
including 
the

An ANALYTIC, BOREL, or COANALYTIC SET. 
Defined 
If A and

by definition 
(i.e., 
A is defined 
as B), 
then 
this

symbolically 
as A s B or 
A := B.

THEOREM OF CALCULUS allows 
definite 
integrals 
to be 
computed 
in terms 
of INDEFINITE

Degenerate 
Dehn Invariant 
Degenerate 
A limiting 
case in which 
a class of object 
changes 
its na- 
ture 
so as to belong 
to another, 
usually 
simpler, 
class. 
I?or example, 
the PRINT 
is a degenerate 
case of the CIR- 
CLE as the RADIUS approaches 
0, and 
the CIRCLE is 
a degenerate 
form 
of an ELLIPSE as the ECCENTRIC- 
ITY approaches 
0. Another 
example 
is the two identical 
ROOTS 
of the second-order 
POLYNOMIAL (X - 1)“. 
Since 
the rt ROOTS of an nth 
degree POLYNOMIAL are usually 
distinct, 
ROOTS which 
coincide 
are said to be degener- 
ate. 
Degenerate 
cases often 
require 
special 
treatment 
in 
numerical 
and analytical 
solutions. 
For example, 
a sim- 
ple search for both 
ROOTS of the above 
equation 
would 
find only 
a single 
one: 
1 
The 
word degenerate 
also has several 
very specific 
and 
t ethnical 
meanings 
in different 
branches 
of mathematics.

Degree 
The word “degree” 
has many 
meanings 
in mathematics. 
The 
most 
common 
meaning 
is the unit 
of ANGLE mea- 
sure defined 
such that 
an entire 
rotation 
is 360”. 
This 
unit 
harks 
back to the Babylonians, 
who used a base 60 
number 
system. 
360” 
likely 
arises from 
the Babylonian 
year, which was composed 
of 360 days (12 months 
of 30 
days each). 
The 
degree 
is subdivided 
into 
60 MINUTES 
per degree, 
and 60 SECONDS per MINUTE.

Degree 
of Freedom 
The 
number 
of degrees 
of freedom 
in a problem, 
distri- 
bution, 
etc., is the number 
of parameters 
which 
may be 
independently 
varied.

LIKELIHOOD RATIO 
Degree 
(Map) 
Let f : A4 t+ nT be a MAP between 
two compact, 
connected, 
oriented 
n-D MANIFOLDS without 
boundary. 
Then 
f induces 
a HOMEOMORPHISM f* from 
the 
HO- 
MOLOGY 
GROUPS 
H,(M) 
to H,(N), 
both 
canonically 
isomorphic 
to the INTEGERS, 
and so f* can be thought 
of as a HOMEOMORPHISM 
of the INTEGERS. The INTE- 
GER d(f) 
to which 
the number 
1 gets sent is called 
the 
degree of the 
MAP 
f. 
There 
is an easy way to compute 
d(f) 
if the MANIFOLDS 
involved 
are smooth. 
Let 
x E N, and 
approximate 
f 
by a smooth 
map 
HOMOTOPIC to f such that 
z is a 
“regular 
value” 
of f (which 
exist and are everywhere 
by 
SARD’S 
THEOREM). 
By the IMPLICIT 
FUNCTION THE- 
OREM, eachpointin 
f-‘(x) 
has a NEIGHBORHOOD such 
that 
f restricted 
to it is a DIFFEOMORPHISM. 
If the 
DIFFEOMORPHISM is orientation 
preserving, 
assign it the 
number 
+l, 
and if it is orientation 
reversing, 
assign 
it 
the 
number 
-1. 
Add 
up all the 
numbers 
for all 
the 
points 
in f-l(z), 
and 
that 
is the 
d(f), 
the 
degree 
of 
f. One reason 
why the degree 
of a map 
is important 
is 
because 
it is a HOMOTOPY invariant. 
A sharper 
result 
states that 
two self-maps 
of the n-sphere 
are homotopic 
IFF they have the same degree. 
This 
is equivalent 
to the 
result 
that 
the nth HOMOTOPY GROUP 
of the ~-SPHERE 
is the set Z of INTEGERS. The 
ISOMORPHISM is given 
by taking 
the degree 
of any representation. 
One important 
application 
of the degree 
concept 
is that 
homotopy 
classes of maps 
from 
n-spheres 
to n-spheres 
are classified 
by their 
degree 
(there 
is exactly 
one homo- 
topy 
class of maps 
for every INTEGER n, and n is the 
degree 
of those 
maps)

if there

(2, 2,

Lemma 
If 
you 
have 
an 
embedding 
of a 
~-SPHERE 
in 
a 3- 
MANIFOLD 
which 
exists 
continuously 
over the ~-DISK, 
then 
it also extends 
over the 
DISK 
as an embedding. 
It was proposed 
by Dehn 
in 1910, 
but 
a correct 
proof 
was not obtained 
until 
the work of Papakyriakopoulos 
(1957ab).

Deltoid 
A 3-cusped 
HYPOCYCLOID, also called 
a TRICUSPOID, 
which 
has rt = a/b = 3 or 3/2, 
where a is the RADWS 
of the large 
fixed 
CIRCLE and b is the RADIUS of the 
small 
rolling 
CIRCLE. The 
deltoid 
was first 
considered 
by Euler 
in 
1745 in connection 
with 
an optical 
prob- 
lem. 
It 
was also investigated 
by Steiner 
in 1856 
and 
is sometimes 
called 
STEINER’S HYPOCYCLOID (Mach- 
tor Archive). 
The 
equation 
of the deltoid 
is obtained 
Del toid 
by setting 
n = 3 in the equation 
of the HYPOCYCLOID, 
yielding 
the parametric 
equations 
zc = [; coqb - 5 cos(2$)]a 
= Zbcos(b+ 
bcos(24)

y = [g sin+ 
+ $ sin(2+)]a

As usual, 
care must 
be taken 
in the evaluation 
of s(t) 
for t > 2;rr/3. 
Since the form given 
above comes from 
an 
integral 
involving 
the ABSOLUTE VALUE of a function, 
it must 
be monotonic 
increasing. 
Each 
branch 
can be 
treated 
correctly 
by defining

with

A3 = ;m2.

The 
length 
of the tangent 
to the tricuspoid, 
measured 
between 
the two points 
P, Q in which 
it cuts the curve 
again, 
is constant 
and equal 
to 4a. 
If you draw TAN- 
GENTS at P and Q, they 
are at RIGHT ANGLES.

No. Examples 
of denu-

Derivative 
The 
derivative 
of a FUNCTION represents 
an infinites- 
imal 
change 
in the 
function 
with 
respect 
to whatever 
parameters 
it may 
have. 
The 
“simple” 
derivative 
of a 
function 
f with respect 
to z is denoted 
either 
f’(z) 
or g 
(and often 
written 
in-line 
as df/dz). 
When 
derivatives 
are taken 
with 
respect 
to time, 
they 
are often 
denoted 
using 
Newton’s 
FLUXI~N 
notation, 
2 
= k:. The deriva- 
tive of a function 
f(z) 
with 
respect 
to the variable 
x is 
defined 
as 
f’(x) 
= lim 
f (x + h) - f(x) 
- 
h-+0 
h 
’ 
Note 
that 
in order 
for the limit 
to exist, 
both 
limh+o+ 
and limh+o- 
must 
exist and be equal, 
so the FUNCTION 
must 
be continuous. 
However, 
continuity 
is a NECES- 
SARY but 
not SUFFICIENT condition 
for differentiabil- 
ity. 
Since some DISCONTINUOUS functions 
can be inte- 
grated, 
in a sense there 
are “more” 
functions 
which 
can 
be integrated 
than 
differentiated. 
In a letter 
to Stielt- 
jes, Hermite 
wrote, 
“1 recoil 
with 
dismay 
and horror 
at 
this 
lamentable 
plague 
of functions 
which 
do not have 
derivatives.” 
A 3-D 
generalization 
of the derivative 
to an arbitrary 
direction 
is known 
as the DIRECTIONAL 
DERIVATIVE.

Descartes 
Circle 
Theorem 
A special 
case of APOLLONIUS’ 
PROBLEM 
requiring 
the 
determination 
of a CIRCLE touching 
three 
mutually 
tan- 
gent CIRCLES (also called 
the KISSING CIRCLES PROB- 
LEM). There 
are two solutions: 
a small 
circle surrounded 
by the three 
original 
CIRCLES, and 
a large 
circle 
sur- 
rounding 
the original 
three. 
Frederick 
Soddy 
gave the 
FORMULA for finding 
the RADIUS 
of the so-called 
inner 
and outer 
SODDY 
CIRCLES 
given the RADII 
of the other 
three. 
The relationship 
is 
qm2 
+ fi22 + m2 + m2) = (K1+ K2 + K3 + Kq)2, 
where 
pi are the 
CURVATURES 
of the CIRCLES. Here, 
the NEGATIVE solution 
corresponds 
to the outer 
SODDY 
CIRCLE and the POSITIVE 
solution 
to the inner 
SODDY 
CIRCLE. This formula 
was known to Descartes 
and Vikte 
(Bayer 
and Merzbach 
1991, p. 159), but Soddy 
extended 
it to SPHERES. In n-D 
space, 
n + 2 mutually 
touching 
n-SPHERES 
can always be found, 
and the relationship 
of 
their 
CURVATURES is

ANGULAR DEFECT 
Descartes’ 
Sign 
Rule 
A method 
of determining 
the maximum 
number 
of POS- 
ITIVE 
and NEGATIVE 
REAL ROOTS 
of a POLYNOMIAL. 
For POSITIVE ROOTS, 
start 
with 
the 
SIGN of COEFFI- 
CIENT of the 
lowest 
(or highest) 
POWER. 
Count 
the 
number 
of SIGN changes 
n as you proceed 
from 
the low- 
est to the highest 
POWER 
(ignoring 
POWERS 
which 
do 
not appear). 
Then 
n is the 
maximum 
number 
of POS- 
ITIVE 
ROOTS. 
Furthermore, 
the 
number 
of allowable 
ROOTS 
is n, n - 2, n - 4, . . . . For example, 
consider 
the 
POLYNOMIAL 
f( > 
X 
= x7 + 2 
- x4 - x3 - x2 + x - 
1. 
Since 
there 
are three 
SIGN than .ges, there 
mum 
of three 
p ossible 
POSITIVE 
ROOTS. 
are a maxi- 
For 
NEGATIVE 
ROOTS, 
starting 
with 
a POLYNOMIAL 
f(z), 
write 
a new POLYNOMIAL 
g(x) 
with 
the 
SIGNS 
of all ODD POWERS 
reversed, 
while 
leaving 
the SIGNS of 
the EVEN 
POWERS 
unchanged. 
Then 
proceed 
as before 
to count 
the number 
of SIGN 
changes 
n. Then 
n is the 
maximum 
number 
of NEGATIVE 
ROOTS. 
For example, 
consider 
the POLYNOMIAL 
f( > 
X 
= x7 + x6 - x4 - x3 - x2 + II: - 1, 
and compute 
the new POLYNOMIAL 
g(x) = -x7 
+ 2 
- x4 + x3 - x2 - 2 - 1. 
There 
are four 
SIGN 
changes, 
so there 
are a m 
of four 
NEGATIVE 
ROOTS.

Dice 
A die (plural 
“dice”) 
is a SOLID 
with markings 
on each of 
its faces. The faces are usually 
all the same shape, mak- 
of its faces. Dice are used in many 
games 
of chance 
as a 
COIN 
can be viewed 
as a degenerate 
2-sided 
case of a 
1. 
The 
most 
common 
type 
of die is a six-sided 
CUBE with 
the numbers 
l-6 
placed 
on the faces. 
The 
value 
of the 
roll is indicated 
by the number 
of “spots” 
showing 
on the 
top. 
For the six-sided 
die, opposite 
faces are arranged 
to 
always 
sum 
to seven. 
This 
gives two possible 
MIRROR 
IMAGE 
arrangements 
in which 
the numbers 
1, 2, and 3 
may be arranged 
in a clockwise 
or counterclockwise 
or- 
der about 
a corner. 
Commercial 
dice may, in fact, have 
either 
orientation. 
The 
illustrations 
below 
show 6-sided 
dice with 
counterclockwise 
and clockwise 
arrangements, 
respectively. 

Dice

The CUBE 
has the nice property 
that 
there is an upward- 
pointing 
face opposite 
the bottom 
face from 
which 
the 
value 
of the 
“roll” 
can easily 
be read. 
This 
would 
not 
be true, 
for instance, 
for a TETRAHEDRAL 
die, 
which 
would 
have to be picked 
up and turned 
over to reveal 
the 
number 
underneath 
(although 
it could 
be determined 
by noting 
which 
number 
l-4 
was not visible 
on one of 
the upper 
three 
faces). 
The 
arrangement 
of spots 
:*I 
corresponding 
to a roll 
of 5 on a six-sided 
die is called 
the QUINCUNX. 
There 
are also special 
names 
for certain 
rolls of two six-sided 
dice: 
two Is are called 
SNAKE 
EYES 
and two 6s are called 
BOXCARS. 
Shapes 
of dice other 
than 
the usual 
6-sided 
CUBE 
are 
commercially 
available 
from 
companies 
such as Dice & 
Games, 
Ltd.@ 
Diaconis 
and Keller 
(1989) 
show that 
there 
exist 
“fair” 
dice other 
than 
the usual 
PLATONIC 
SOLIDS 
and duals 
of the ARCHIMEDEAN 
SOLIDS, 
where a fair die is one for 
which 
its symmetry 
group 
acts transitively 
on its faces. 
However, 
they 
did not explicitly 
provide 
any examples. 
The probability 
of obtaining 
p points 
(a roll 
of p) on n 
s-sided 
dice can be computed 
as follows. 
The number 
of 
ways in which p can be obtained 
is the COEFFICIENT 
of 
xp in 
f (2) = (x + x2 + 
l . . + xS)n, 
(1) 
since each possible 
arrangement 
contributes 
one term.

can be written 
as a MULTINOMIAL 
SERIES

dice. 
The 
probabilities 
correspond- 
ing to the most likely 
rolls can be computed 
by plugging 
p = pi 
into 
the general 
formula 
together 
with 
A POLYNOMIAL 
Z&, 
w) in two variables 
for abstract 
GRAPHS. 
A GRAPH 
with 
one 
VERTEX 
has 2 
= 
q. 
Adding 
a VERTEX 
not attached 
by any EDGES multiplies 
the 2 by q. Picking 
a particular 
EDGE 
of a GRAPH 
G, 
the POLYNOMIAL 
for G is defined 
by adding 
the POLY- 
NOMIAL 
of the GRAPH 
with that 
EDGE deleted 
to 21 times 
the POLYNOMIAL 
of the graph 
with that 
EDGE collapsed 
to a point. 
Setting 
21 = -1 
gives the number 
of distinct 
VERTEX 
colorings 
of the 
GRAPH. 
The 
dichroic 
POLY- 
NOMIAL 
of a PLANAR 
GRAPH 
can be expressed 
as the 
SQUARE

Differential 
Equation 
An equation 
which 
involves 
the DERIVATIVES 
of a func- 
tion 
as well as the function 
itself. 
If PARTIAL 
DERIVA- 
TIVES 
are involved, 
the 
equation 
is called 
a PARTIAL 
DIFFERENTIAL 
EQUATION; 
if only 
ordinary 
DERIVA- 
TIVES 
are present, 
the equation 
is called 
an ORDINARY 
DIFFERENTIAL 
EQUATION. 
Differential 
equations 
play 
an extremely 
important 
and useful role in applied 
math, 
engineering, 
and physics, 
and 
much 
mathematical 
and 
numerical 
machinery 
has been developed 
for the solution 
of differential 
equations.

k-Form 
A differential 
k-form 
is a TENSOR of RANK k which 
is 
antisymmetric 
under 
exchange 
of any pair 
of indices. 
The number 
of algebraically 
independent 
components 
in 
n-D 
is (i) , where this is a BINOMIAL COEFFICIENT. In 
particular, 
a l-form 
(often 
simply 
called 
a “differential”) 
is a quantity 
w1 = bl dxl 
+ b2 dxz, 
(1) 
where 
bl = bl(x1,x2) 
and b2 = b&,xz) 
are the com- 
ponents 
of a COVARIANT TENSOR. Changing 
variables 
from 
x to y gives 
(3) 
which 
is the covariant 
transformation 
law. 
2-forms 
can 
be constructed 
from 
the WEDGE PRODUCT of l-forms. 
Let 
01 = bl dxl 
+ b2 dxz 
(4) 
02 = cldxl 
+c2dx2, 
(5) 
then 01 A 02 is a 2-form 
denoted 
w2. Changing 
variables 
m(y1,y2) 
to x2(y1,y2) 
gives

Similarly, 
a 4-form 
can be constructed 
from 
WEDGE 
PRODUCTS of two 2-forms

I-forms 
w4 = WI2 A w22 = (d

A CRYPTARITHM 
in which 
DIGITS 
are used to represent 
other 
DIGITS. 
Digit 
The 
number 
of digits 
D in an INTEGER 
n is the number 
of numbers 
in some base (usually 
10) required 
to repre- 
sent it. 
The 
numbers 
1 to 9 are therefore 
single 
digits, 
while the numbers 
10 to 99 are double 
digits. 
Terms 
such 
as “double-digit 
inflation” 
are occasionally 
encountered, 
although 
this particular 
usage has thankfully 
not 
been 
needed 
in the U.S. 
for some time. 
The 
number 
of (base 
10) digits 
in a number 
n can be calculated 
as 
D = [log,, 
n + 1J , 
where 
1x1 is the FLOOR 
FUNCTION.

Digitadition 
Start 
with 
an INTEGER 
n, known 
as the GENERATOR. 
Add 
the SUM of the 
GENERATOR’S 
digits 
to the GEN- 
ERATOR 
to obtain 
the digitadition 
n’. 
A number 
can 
have more 
than 
one GENERATOR. 
If a number 
has no 
GENERATOR, 
it is called 
a SELF 
NUMBER. 
The 
sum of 
all numbers 
in a digitadition 
series is given 
by the last 
term 
minus 
the first plus the sum 
of the DIGITS 
of the 
last. 
If the digitadition 
process is performed 
on n’ to yield 
its 
digit adition 
n”, 
on nff to yield 
n”‘, 
etc., 
a single-digit 
number, 
known 
as the DIGITAL 
ROOT 
of n, is eventually 
obtained. 
The 
digital 
roots 
of the first few integers 
are 
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9, 1, . . . 
(Sloane’s 
A010888). 
Digitadition 
433 
If the process 
is generalized 
so that 
the tcth (instead 
of 
first) 
powers 
of the 
digits 
of a number 
are repeatedly 
added, 
a periodic 
sequence 
of numbers 
is eventually 
ob- 
tained 
for any given 
starting 
number 
n. If the original 
number 
n is equal to the sum of the lath powers of its dig- 
its, it is called 
a NARCISSISTIC 
NUMBER. 
If the original 
number 
is the smallest 
number 
in the eventually 
periodic 
sequence 
of numbers 
in the repeated 
k-digitaditions, 
it 
is called 
a RECURRING 
DIGITAL 
INVARIANT. 
Both NAR- 
CISSISTIC 
NUMBERS 
and 
RECURRING 
DIGITAL 
TNVARI- 
ANTS are relatively 
rare. 
The 
only 
possible 
periods 
for repeated 
Z-digitaditions 
are 1 and 
8, and 
the periods 
of the first 
few positive 
integers 
are 1, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 1, 8, 8, 1, 
l . . . The 
possi- 
ble periods 
p for n-digitaditions 
are summarized

few integers

Digital 
Root 
Consider 
the process of taking 
a number, 
adding 
its DIG- 
ITS, then adding 
the DIGITS 
of numbers 
derived 
from 
it, 
etc., 
until 
the 
remaining 
number 
has only 
one DIGIT. 
The 
number 
of additions 
required 
to obtain 
a single 
DIGIT 
from 
a number 
n is called 
the ADDITIVE 
PER- 
SISTENCE 
of n, and 
the 
DIGIT 
obtained 
is called 
the 
digital 
root 
of n. 
For example, 
the 
sequence 
obtained 
from 
the 
starting 
number 
9876 is (9876, 
30, 3), so 9876 has an ADDITIVE 
PERSISTENCE 
of 2 and a digital 
root 
of 3. The 
digital 
roots of the first few integers 
are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 1, 
2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9, 1, . . . (Sloane’s 
A010888). 
The digital 
root 
of an INTEGER 
72 can therefore 
be computed 
with- 
out 
actually 
performing 
the iteration 
using 
the simple 
congruence 
formula 
n (mod 
9) 
n $ 0 (mod 
9)

n E 0 (mod

The WIDTH of a set P is equal 
to the minimum 
num- 
ber of CHAINS needed 
to COVER P. 
Equivalently, 
if a 
set P of ab + 1 elements 
is PARTIALLY ORDERED, then 
P contains 
a CHAIN of size a + I or an ANTICHAIN 
of 
size b + 1. 
Letting

Dimension 
The 
notion 
of dimension 
is important 
in mathematics 
because 
it gives a precise 
parameterization 
of the con- 
ceptual 
or visual 
complexity 
of any geometric 
object. 
In 
fact, 
the concept 
can even 
be applied 
to abstract 
ob- 
jects 
which 
cannot 
be directly 
visualized. 
For example, 
the notion 
of time 
can be considered 
as one-dimensional, 
since it can be thought 
of as consisting 
of only 
“now,” 
“before” 
and 
“after .” 
Since 
“before” 
and 
“after,” 
re- 
gardless 
of how far back or how far into 
the future 
they 
are, are extensions, 
time 
is like 
a line, 
a l-dimensional 
object. 
To see how lower and 
higher 
dimensions 
relate 
to each 
other, 
take 
any geometric 
object 
(like 
a POINT, LINE, 
CIRCLE, PLANE, etc.), 
and “drag” 
it in an opposing 
di- 
rection 
(drag 
a POINT to trace 
out 
a LINE, a LINE 
to 
trace out a box, 
a CIRCLE to trace 
out 
a CYLINDER, a 
DISK to a solid CYLINDER, etc.). 
The result 
is an object 
which is quali .tatively 
“larger” 
than 
the previous 
object, 
“quali tative” 
in the 
sense that, 
regardless 
of how you 
drag 
the 
original 
object, 
you 
always 
trace 
out 
an ob- 
ject of the same “qualitative 
size.” 
The POINT could 
be 
made 
into 
a straight 
LINE, a CIRCLE, a HELIX, or some 
other 
CURVE, but 
all of these 
objects 
are qualitatively 
of the 
same 
dimension. 
The 
notion 
of dimension 
was 
invented 
for the purpose 
of measuring 
this 
“qualitative” 
topological 
property. 
Making 
things 
a bit more 
formal, 
finite 
collections 
of ob- 
jects (e.g., points 
in space) are considered 
O-dimensional. 
Objects 
that 
are 
“dragged” 
versions 
of O-dimensional 
objects 
are then 
called 
l-dimensional. 
Similarly, 
ob- 
jects 
which 
are dragged 
l-dimensional 
objects 
are 2- 
dimensional, 
and 
so on. 
Dimension 
is formalized 
in 

436 
Dimension 
Dini ‘s Surface 
mathematics 
as the 
intrinsic 
dimension 
of a TOPO- 
LOGICAL 
SPACE. 
This 
dimension 
is called 
the LEBES- 
GUE COVERING 
DIMENSION 
(also known 
simply 
as the 
TOPOLOGICAL 
DIMENSION). 
The 
archetypal 
example 
is EUCLIDEAN 
n-space 
R”, 
which 
has topological 
di- 
mension 
72. The 
basic 
ideas 
leading 
up to this 
result 
(including 
the DIMENSION 
INVARIANCE 
THEOREM, 
Do- 
MAIN 
INVARIANCE 
THEOREM, 
and 
LEBESGUE 
COVER- 
ING DIMENSION) 
were developed 
by Poincar6, 
Brouwer, 
Lebesgue, 
Urysohn, 
and Menger. 
There 
are several 
branchings 
and extensions 
of the no- 
tion 
of topological 
dimension. 
Implicit 
in the 
notion 
of the LEBESGUE 
COVERING 
DIMENSION 
is that 
dimen- 
sion, in a sense, is a measure 
of how an object 
fills space. 
If it takes up a lot of room, 
it is higher 
dimensional, 
and 
if it takes 
up less room, 
it is lower dimensional. 
HAUS- 
DORFF 
DIMENSION 
(also called 
FRACTAL 
DIMENSION) 
is 
a fine tuning 
of this definition 
that 
allows notions 
of ob- 
jects 
with 
dimensions 
other 
than 
INTEGERS. 
FRACTALS 
are objects 
whose 
HAUSDORFF 
DIMENSION 
is different 
from 
their 
TOPOLOGICAL 
DIMENSION. 
The concept 
of dimension 
is also used in ALGEBRA, 
pri- 
marily 
as the 
dimension 
of a VECTOR 
SPACE 
over 
a 
FIELD. 
This 
usage 
stems 
from 
the fact that 
VECTOR 
SPACES over the 
reals 
were the first 
VECTOR 
SPACES 
to be studied, 
and for them, 
their 
topological 
dimension 
can be calculated 
by purely 
algebraic 
means as the CAR- 
DINALITY 
of a maximal 
linearly 
independent 
subset. 
In 
particular, 
the dimension 
of a SUBSPACE 
of R” 
is equal 
to the 
number 
of LINEARLY 
INDEPENDENT 
VECTORS 
needed 
to generate 
it (i.e., 
the number 
of VECTORS 
in 
its BASIS).

Given 
any assignment 
of n-element 
sets to the n2 loca-

of a square 
n x n array, 
is it always 
possible 
to 
find 
a PARTIAL LATIN SQUARE? The 
fact that 
such a 
PARTIAL LATIN SQUARE can always be found 
for a 2 x 2 
array 
can be proven 
analytically, 
and 
techniques 
were 
developed 
which 
also proved 
the existence 
for 4 x 4 and 
6 x 6 arrays. 
However, 
the general

HILBERT'S 10~~ PROBLEM askedifatechnique 
for solving 
a general 
Diophantine 
existed. 
A general 
method 
exists 
for the solution 
of first degree 
Diophan- 
tine equations. 
However, 
the impossibility 
of obtaining 
a 
general 
solution 
was proven 
by Julia 
Robinson 
and Mar- 
tin Davis 
in 1970, following 
proof 
of the result 
that 
the 
equation 
n = Fzm 
(where 
Fsln is a FIBONACCI NUM- 
BER) is Diophantine 
by Yuri 
Matijasevic 
(MatijaseviE 
1970, 
Davis 
1973, 
Davis 
and 
Hersh 
1973, 
Matijasevic 
1993). 
No 
general 
method 
is known 
for quadratic 
or higher 
Diophantine 
equations. 
Jones 
and 
MatijaseviE 
(1982) 
proved 
that 
no ALGORITHMS can exist 
to determine 
if 
an arbitrary 
Diophantine 
equation 
in nine 
variables 
has 
solutions. 
Ogilvy 
and Anderson 
(1988) 
give a number 
of Diophantine 
equations 
with 
known 
and unknown 
so- 
lutions.

The 
2-1 fifth-order 
Diophantine 
equation 
A5+B5=C5 
(1) 
is a special 
case of FERMAT'S 
LAST 
THEOREM 
with 
n = 
5, and 
so has no solution. 
No 
solutions 
to the 
2-2 equation 
A5+B5=C5+D5 
(2) 
are known, 
despite 
the fact that 
sums up to 1.02 x 1O26 
have 
been 
checked 
(Guy 
1994, 
p. 140), 
improving 
on 
the results 
on Lander 
et al. (1967), 
who checked 
up to 
2.8 x 1014. (In fact, no solutions 
are known 
for POWERS 
of 6 or 7 either.) 
No solutions 
to the 3-1 equation 
A5+B5+C5=D5 
(3) 
are known 
(Lander 
et al. 1967), nor are any 3-2 solutions 
up to 8 x 1012 (Lander 
et al. 1967). 
Parametric 
solutions 
are known 
for the 3-3 (Guy 
1994, 
pp. 
140 and 
142). 
Swinnerton-Dyer 
(1952) 
gave two 
parametric 
solutions 
to the 3-3 equation 
but, 
forty years 
later, 
W. Gosper 
discovered 
that 
the second scheme 
has 
an unfixable 
bug. 
The 
smallest 
primitive 
3-3 
are 
245 + 2g5 +675 = 35 + 545 + 625 
1g5 +445 +665 = 135 + 515 +645 
215 +435 + 765 = g5 + 62' +6g5 
565 +675 +835 = 535 + 725 +815 
4g5 +755 +1075 = 3g5 +925 
+1005 
(Moessner 
1939, Moessner 
1948, Lander

For 4 fifth

we have the 4-1 equation

but it is 
not known 
if there 
is a parametric 
solution 
(Guy 
1994, 
p. 140). Sastry’s 
(1934) 
5-l solution 
gives some 4-2 so-

Diophantine 
Equation-5th

(Rao 
1934, Moessner 
1948, Lander 
et al. 1967). 
A two-parameter 
solution 
to the 4-3 equation 
was given 
by Xeroudakes 
and Moessner 
(1958). 
Gloden 
(1949) 
also 
gave a parametric 
solution. 
The smallest 
solution 
is 
l5 + 85 + 145 + 275 = 35 + 225 + 255 
(20) 
(Rao 
1934, Lander 
et al. 1967). 
Several 
parametric 
so- 
lutions 
to the 4-4 equation 
were found 
by Xeroudakes 
and Moessner 
(1958). 
The 
smallest 
4-4 solution

Sastry

The

can now be cleared 
to produce 
an 
integer 
solution. 
If T/S 
is picked 
to be large 
enough, 
the w and w will 
be POSITIVE. 
If 
T/S 
is still 
larger, 
the 
v/w 
will 
be large 
enough 
for 21 and 
w to be used 
as 
the 
inputs 
to produce 
a third 
pair, 
etc. 
However, 
the 
resulting 
integers 
may 
be quite 
large, 
even for n = 2. 
E.g., 
starting 
with 
33 + l3 = 28, the algorithm

Diophantine 
Equation-Linear 
A linear 
Diophantine 
equation 
(in two variables) 
is an 
equation 
of the general 
form 
ax + by = c, 
(1) 
where solutions 
are sought 
with 
a, b, and c INTEGERS. 
Such equations 
can be solved 
completely, 
and the first 
known 
solution 
was constructed 
by Brahmagupta. 
Con- 
sider the equation 
ax+by=l. 
(2) 
Now 
use a variation 
of the 
EUCLIDEAN 
ALGORITHM, 
letting 
a = ~1 and b = ~2 
Tl

Qn-33n-2 
+ 
Tn-1 
(5) 
Tn-2 
= 
qn-2Tn-1 
+ 
1. 
(6) 
Starting 
from 
the bottom 
gives 
1 = T-n-2 - qn-27-+1 
G-&-l --n--3

so 
(7)

Qn--2(Tfl-3

qn-3Tn-2) 
= 
-Qn-2rn-3 
+(1-Qn-2Qn--3)rn-2* 
(9) 
Continue 
this procedure 
all the way back to the top. 
Take 
as an example 
the equation 
1027~ + 712~ = 1. 
(10) 
Proceed 
as follows. 
1027= 
71% 1+ 315

The solution 
is therefore 
x = -165, 
y = 238. The above 
procedure 
can be simplified 
by noting 
that 
the two left- 
most columns 
are offset by one entry 
and alternate 
signs, 
as they 
must 
since 
1 = -Ai+pi 
+ Airif 
(11) 
r-is-1 = Ti-1 - riqi-1 
1 
= 
Airi-1 
- 
(Aiqi-1

(12) 
(13) 
so the COEFFICIENTS 
of ~-1 
and ri+l 
are the same and 
A-1 = -(Aiqi-I 
+ &+I). 
(14) 
Repeating 
the 
above 
example 
using 
this 
information 
therefore 
gives

the above

Call 
the solutions

~~ 
In fact, the solution 
to the equation 
ux - by = 1 
(16) 
is equivalent 
to finding 
the CQNTINUED FRACTION for 
a/b, 
with 
a and b RELATIVELY PRIME (Olds 
1963). 
If 
there 
are n terms 
in the 
fraction, 
take 
the

The

The GREATEST COMMON DIVISOR 
d = GCD(U,

be divided 
through

u’x + b’y = ct ,

b’ E b/d, and c’ E c/d. 
If dfc, then 
c’ is 
not 
an INTEGER and the equation 
cannot 
have a solu- 
tion 
in INTEGERS. 
A necessary 
and sufficient 
condition 
for the general 
first-order 
equation 
to have solutions 
in 
INTEGERS is therefore 
that 
djc. If this is the case, then 
solve 
a’x + b’y = 1

and multiply 
the solutions 
by c’, since 
u’(clx)

Diophantine 
Equation-Quadratic 
An equation 
of the form 
x2 - Dy2 = 1, 
(1) 
where 
D is an INTEGER 
is called 
a PELL 
EQUATION. 
Pell 
equations, 
as well as the analogous 
equation 
with 
a minus 
sign on the right, 
can be solved 
by finding 
the 
CONTINUED 
FRACTION 
for m. 
(The 
trivial 
solution 
2 = 1, y = 0 is ignored 
in all subsequent 
discussion.) 
Let p,/q, 
denote 
the nth 
CONVERGENT 
[al, a2, 
l . . , a,], 
then 
we are looking 
for a convergent 
which 
obeys 
the 
identity 
2 
Pn 
- Dqf12 = (-l)“, 
(2) 
which turns 
out to always be possible 
since the CONTIN- 
UED FRACTION 
of a QUADRATIC 
SURD 
always becomes 
periodic 
at some term 
a,+l, 
where a,+1 
= 2~1, i.e., 
JD= 
[a1,az,***,a,,2ar]. 
Writing 
n = rk gives 
(3) 
PTk2 - Dqrrc2 = (-l>‘“, 
(4 
for k a POSITIVE 
INTEGER. 
If T is ODD, 
solutions 
to 
x2 - Dy2 = 311 
(5) 
can be obtained 
if k is chosen to be EVEN 
or ODD, 
but 
if T is EVEN, 
there 
are no values 
of k which 
can make 
the exponent 
ODD. 
If T is EVEN, 
then 
(-1)’ 
is POSITIVE 
and the solution 
in terms 
of smallest 
INTEGERS 
is 5 = p, 
and 
y = qfg 
where pr/qr 
is the rth 
CONVERGENT. 
If T is ODD, 
then 
(-1)’ 
is NEGATIVE, 
but we can take 
k = 2 in this case, 
to obtain 
p2r2 
- 
Dqar 
2 = 1, 
\ 
(6) 
so the solution 
in smallest 
INTEGERS 
is II: = pzr, 
y = qzr. 
Summarizing, 
(x’ ‘) = 
for T even 
;;;:a;;l,, 
for T odd . 
The more 
complicated 
equation 
x2 - Dy2 
= &c 
Diophantine 
Equation-Quadratic 
can also be solved 
for certain 
values 
of c and D, but the 
procedure 
is more 
complicated 
(Chrystal 
1961). 
How- 
ever, if a single 
solution 
to the above equation 
is known, 
other 
solutions 
can be found. 
Let p and q be solutions 
to (8), and T and s solutions 
to the 
“unit” 
form”. 
Then 
(P 2 - Dq2)(r2 
- Ds2) = &c 
(pr 
% Dqs)2 
- D(ps 
41 qr)2 = 4~. 
(10) 
Call 
a Diophantine 
equation 
consisting 
of finding 
nz 
POWERS 
equal 
to a sum of n equal 
POWERS 
an “m - n 
equation.” 
The 
2-l 
equation 
A2 = B2 + c2, 
(11) 
which 
corresponds 
to finding 
a PYTHAGOREAN 
TRIPLE 
(A, B, C) has a well-known 
general 
solution 
(Dickson 
1966, 
pp. 
165-170). 
To solve 
the equation, 
note 
that 
every 
PRIME 
of the form 
4x + 1 can be expressed 
as the 
sum of two RELATIVELY 
PRIME 
squares 
in exactly 
one 
way. 
To find 
in how many 
ways a general 
number 
nz 
can be expressed 
as a sum 
of two squares, 
factor 
it as 
follows 
m = 2aop12a1 . . .pn2anq1b1 . l . qrbr, 
(12) 
where the ps are primes 
of the form 
4~ - 1 and the qs 
are primes 
of the form 
x +1. 
If the as are integral, 
then 
define 
B E (2bl + 1)(2bz + 1) v l 
l (2b, + 1) - 1. 
(13) 
Then 
m is a sum of two unequal 
squares 
in 
0 
for any ai half-integral 
N(m) 
= 
$(h 
+ 
l)(bz 
+

B odd 
(14) 
+(bl 
+ l)(bz 
+ 1) 
l 
l 
l (b, + 1) - + 
for all ai integral, 
B even. 
If zero is counted 
as a square, 
both 
POSITIVE 
and NEG- 
ATIVE 
numbers 
are included, 
and the order 
of the two 
squares 
is distinguished, 
Jacobi 
showed 
that 
the num- 
ber of ways a number 
can be written 
as the sum of two 
squares 
is four times 
the excess of the number 
of DIVI- 
SORS of the form 
4x + 1 over the number 
of DIVISORS 
of 
the form 
4z - 1. 
A set of INTEGERS 
satisfying 
the 3-l 
equation 
A2 + B2 + C2 = D2 
(15) 
is called 
a PYTHAGOREAN 
QUADRUPLE.

Degen’s 
eight-square 
identity 
holds 
for eight 
squares, 
but 
no other 
number, 
as proved 
by Cayley. 
The 
two-square 
identity 
underlies 
much 
of TRIGONOMETRY, 
the 
four- 
square 
identity 
some 
of QUATERNIONS, 
and the eight- 
square identity, 
the CAYLEY

Equation-Quartic 
Call 
an equation 
involving 
quartics 
m-n 
if a sum of m 
quartics 
is equal 
to a sum of n fourth 
POWERS. 
The 2-l 
equation 
A4+B4=C4 
(1) 
is a case of F 'ERMAT'S 
LAST 
THEO REM with 
n = 
therefore 
has no soluti .ons. In fact, the equations 
A4 * B4 = C2 
(2) 
also have no solutions 
in INTEGERS. 
Parametric 
solutions 
to the 2-2 equation 
A4 + B4 =C4+D4 
(3) 
are 
known 
(Euler 
1802; 
Gkrardin 
1917; 
Guy 
1994, 
pp. 140-141). 
A few specific 
solutions 
are 
5g4 + 15g4 = 1334 + 1344 = 635,318,657 
(4 
74 + 23g4 = 1574 + 2274 = 3,262,811,042 
(5) 
1934 + 29Z4 = 2564 + 2574 = 8,657,437,697 
(6) 
29g4 + 4974 = 2714 + 5024 = 68,899,596,497

5144 + 35g4 = 1O34 + 5424 = 86,409,838,577 
(8) 
2224 + 6314 = 5034 + 55g4 = 160,961,094,577 
(9) 
214 + 7174 = 4714 + 6814 = 264,287,694,402 
(10) 
764 + 12034 = 6534 + 11764 = 2,094,447,251,857

9974 + 13424 = 8784 + 1381” = 4,231,525,221,377

the 
smallest 
of which 
is due to Euler. 
Lander 
et al. (1967) 
give 
a list 
of 25 primitive 
2-2 solutions. 
General

(Hardy 
and Wright 
1979). 
In 1772, Euler 
proposed 
that 
the 3-1 equation 
(Berndt 
1994, p. 101). 
S imilar 
examples 
can be found 
in Martin 
(1896). 
P arametric 
solutions 
were given 
by 
Gkrardin 
(1911). 
Ramanujan 
also gave the general 
expression 
A4 + B4 + C4 = D4 
(22) 
had no solutions 
in INTEGERS 
(Lander 
et al. 1967). 
This 
assertion 
is known 
as the 
EULER 
QUARTIC 
CONJEC- 
TURE. 
Ward 
(1948) 
showed 
there 
were no solutions 
for D < 10,000, 
which 
was subsequently 
improved 
to 
D < 220,000 
by Lander 
et al. (1967). 
However, 
the EU- 
LER QWARTIC 
CONJECTURE 
was disproved 
in 1987 by 
Noam 
D. Elkies, 
who, 
using 
a geometric 
construction, 
found 
34 + (2X4 - 1)” + (4X5 + X)” 
= (4~~ + 1)” + (6~~ - 3)4 + (4s5 - 5~)~ 
(32) 
(Berndt 
1994, p. 106). 
Dickson 
(1966, pp. 653-655) 
cites 
several 
FORMULAS 
giving 
solutions 
to the 3-3 equation, 
and Haldeman 
(1904) 
gives a general 
FORMULA. 
The 
4-l 
equation 
A4+B4+C4+D4=E4 
(33) 
has solutions 
2,682,4404 
+ 15,365,63g4 
+ 18,796,7604 
= 20,615,6734 
(23) 
and showed that 
infinitely 
many 
solutions 
existed 
(Guy 
1994, p. 140). 
In 1988, Roger 
Frye found 
95,8004 
+ 217,51g4 
+ 414,5604 
= 422,4814 
(24) 
and proved 
that 
there 
are no solutions 
in smaller 
INTE- 
GERS (Guy 
1994, p. 140). 
Another 
solution 
was found 
by Allan 
MacLeod 
in 1997, 
638,523,24g4 
= 630,662,6244 
+ 275,156,2404 
+ 219,076,4654. 
(25) 
It is not known 
if there 
is a parametric 
solution. 
In contrast, 
there are many 
solutions 
to the 3-l equation 
A4 + B4 + C4 = 2D4 
(26) 
(see below). 
Parametric 
solutions 
to the 3-2 equation 
A4+B4=C4+D4+E4 
(27) 
are known 
(Gkrardin 
1910, Ferrari 
1913). 
The

BHARGAVA’S 
THEOREM 
is a general 
identity 
which gives 
the 
above 
equations 
as a special 
case, and 
may 
have 
been 
the route 
by which 
Ramanujan 
proceeded. 
An- 
other 
identity 
due to Ramanujan 
is 
(a + b + c)~ + (b + c + d)4 + (a - d)4 
= (c+d+a)4+(d+a+b)4+(b-~)4, 
(78) 
where a/b = c/d, 
and 4 may 
also be replaced 
by 2 (Ra- 
manujan 
1957, Hirschhorn 
1998). 
V. Kyrtatas 
noticed 
that 
a = 3, b = 7, c = 20, d = 25, 
e = 38, and f = 39 satisfy 
a4 -+- b4 + c4 
u+b+c 
d4+e4+f4=d+e+f 
(79) 
and asks if there 
are any other 
distinct 
integer 
solutions. 
The first few numbers 
n which 
are a sum of two or more 
fourth 
POWERS 
(m - 
1 equations) 
are 353, 651, 2487, 
2501, 
2829, 
. . . (Sloane’s 
AOQ3294). 
The 
only 
number 
of the form 
4x4 + y4 
w 
which 
is PRIME 
is 5 (Baudran 
1885, Le Lionnais 
1983).

Riddle 
“Diophantus’ 
youth 
lasts l/6 
of his life. He grew a beard 
after 
l/12 
more 
of his life. 
After 
l/7 
more 
of his life, 
Diophantus 
married. 
Five 
years 
later, 
he had 
a son. 
The 
son lived 
exactly 
half 
as long 
as his father, 
and 
Diophantus 
died 
just 
four 
years 
after 
his son’s 
death. 
All of this 
totals 
the years Diophantus 
lived.” 
Let D be the number 
of years Diophantus 
lived, 
and let 
S be the number 
of years his son lived. 
Then 
the above 
word problem 
gives the two equations 
D=(;+&+$)D+5+S+4 
S= 
+D. 
Solving 
this 
simultaneously 
gives S = 42 as the age of 
the son and D = 84 as the age of Diophantus.

Direct 
Search 
Factorization 
Direct 
search factorization 
is the simplest 
PRIME FAC- 
TORIZATION ALGORITHM. 
It consists 
of searching 
for 
factors 
of a number 
by systematically 
performing 
TRIAL 
DIVISIONS, usually 
using 
a sequence 
of increasing 
num- 
bers. 
Multiples 
of small PRIMES are commonly 
excluded 
to reduce 
the number 
of trial 
DIVISORS, but just 
includ- 
ing them 
is sometimes 
faster 
than 
the time 
required 
to 
exclude 
them. 
This 
approach 
is very inefficient, 
and can 
be used only 
with fairly 
small 
numbers. 
When 
using 
this method 
on a number 
n, only DIVISORS 
uptoLG]( 
h 
w 
ere LlcJ is the FLOOR FUNCTION) need 
to be tested. 
This 
is true since if all INTEGERS less than 
this had been tried, 
then 
WY+1 < Jn. 
(1) 
In other words, all possible 
FACTORS have had their 
CO- 
FACTORS already 
tested. 
It is also true 
that, 
when the 
smallest 
PRIME FACTOR p of n is > e, 
then its COFAC- 
TOR m (such that 
n = pm) 
must 
be PRIME. To prove 
this, 
suppose 
that 
the smallest 
p is > e. 
If m = ab, 
then 
the smallest 
value 
a and b could 
assume 
is p. But 
then 
n = pm = pab = p3 > n, 
(2) 
which 
cannot 
be true. 
Therefore, 
m must 
be PRIME, so

The 
direct 
sum of an arbitrary 
family 
of MODULES over 
the same RING is also defined. 
If J is the indexing 
set 
for the family 
of MODULES, then the direct 
sum is repre- 
sented 
by the collection 
of functions 
with 
finite 
support 
from

these MODULES such that

is the

The

(called 
the DIRICHLET

Weierstrafi 
showed 
that 
Dirichlet’s 
argument 
contained 
a subtle 
fallacy. 
As a result, 
it can be claimed 
only that there exists a lower bound 
to which D[u] 
comes 
arbitrarily 
close without 
being 
forced 
to actually 
reach 
it. 
Kneser, 
however, 
obtained 
a valid

Discrepancy 
Theorem 
Let s1, S& . . . be an infinite 
series of real numbers 
lying 
between 
0 and 
1. Then 
corresponding 
to any arbitrar- 
ily large 
K, 
there 
exists 
a positive 
integer 
n and 
two 
subintervals 
of equal 
length 
such that 
the number 
of sV 
with 
v = 1, 2, . . . , n which 
lie in one of the subintervals 
differs 
from 
the number 
of such sV that 
lie in the other 
subinterval 
by more 
than 
K 
(van 
der Corput 
1935ab, 
van Aardenne-Ehrenfest 
1945, 
1949, Roth 
1954). 
This 
statement 
can be refined 
as follows. 
Let 
IV be a 
large integer 
and sr, ~2, . . , , SN be a sequence 
of N real 
numbers 
lying 
between 
0 and 
1. Then 
for any integer 
1 < n < N and any real number 
QI satisfying 
0 < a < 1, 
- 
let D,(a) 
denote 
the number 
of sy with 
v = 1, 2, . . . , n 
that 
satisfy 
0 5 sV < a. Then 
there 
exist 
n and a such 
that 
ID&) - nal > cl* 
where cl is a positive 
constant. 
l 
This 
result 
can be further 
strengthened, 
which 
is most 
easily 
done by reformulating 
the problem. 
Let 
N 
> 1 
be an integer 
and I’r, 
P2, . . . , PN be N (not necessarily 
distinct) 
points 
in the 
square 
0 < =1: < 1, 0 < y < 1. 
-

- 
- 
Then 
11 
ss 
[S(x, 
y) 
- 
Nxy12 
dx 
dy 
> c2 In N, 
0 
0 
where c2 is a positive 
constant 
and S(U, V) is the number 
of points 
in the rectangle 
0 5 x < u, 0 5 y < 21 (Roth 
1954). 
Therefore, 
[S(x,y) 
- Nxyl 
> cd=, 
and 
the original 
result 
can be stated 
as the 
fact that 
there 
exist n and Q! such that 
The 
randomly 
distributed 
points 
shown 
in the 
above 
squares 
have \S(x,y) 
- Nxy12 
= 6.40 and 9.11, respec- 
t ively. 
Similarly, 
the discrepancy 
of a set of N points 
in a unit 
~HYPERCUBE 
satisfies 
(Roth 
1954, 1976, 
1979, 
1980).

Discrete 
Fourier 
Transform 
The FOURIER TRANSFORM is defined 
as 
f(v) = F[f(t)] 
= 
[= 
f(t)e-2”i”tdt. 
(1) 
Now 
consider 
generalization 
to the 
case of a discrete 
function, 
f(t) 
+ 
f(tk) 
by letting 
fc E f (&), where 
tk = kA, 
with 
k = 0, . . . , Iv - 1. Choose 
the frequency 
step such that 
A 
n 
v, 
= 
NA’ 
(2) 
with 
n = -N/2, 
. . . , 0, . . l , N/2. 
There 
are N+ 
1 values 
of n, so there 
is one relationship 
between 
the frequency 
components. 
Writing 
this 
out as per Press 
et al. (1989)

Discriminant 
(Quadratic

X = Bi2 - 4A’C’ 
= -4A’C’. 
(18) 
Now, 
if -4A’C’ 
< 0, then 
A’ 
and 
C’ 
both 
have 
the 
same sign, 
and the equation 
has the general 
form 
of an 
ELLIPSE 
(if A’ and 
B’ 
are positive). 
If -4A’C’ 
> 0, 
then 
A’ and 
C’ have opposite 
signs, 
and the equation 
has the general 
form 
of a HYPERBOLA. 
If -4A’C’ 
= 0, 
then 
either 
A’ or C’ is zero, 
and the equation 
has the 
general 
form 
of a PARABOLA 
(if the NONZERO 
A’ or C’ 
is positive). 
Since 
the discriminant 
is invariant, 
these 
conclusions 
will also hold 
for an arbitrary 
choice of 8, so 
they 
also hold 
when -4A’C’ 
is replaced 
by the original 
n2 - 4AC. 
The 
general 
result 
is 
u 
1. 
2. 
3. 
If B2 -4AC 
< 0, the equation 
represents 
an ELLIPSE, 
a CIRCLE 
(degenerate 
ELLIPSE), 
a POINT 
(degener- 
ate CIRCLE), 
or has no graph. 
If B2 - 4AC 
> 0, the equation 
represents 
a HYPER- 
BOLA 
or pair 
of intersecting 
lines 
(degenerate 
HY- 
PERBOLA). 
If 
B2 
- 
4AC 
= 
0, 
the 
equation 
represents 
a 
PARABOLA, 
a LINE 
(degenerate 
PARABOLA), 
a pair 
of PARALLEL 
lines 
(degenerate 
PARABOLA), 
or has 
no graph. 
A+C 
cl=-- 
+os(28 
+ a>. 
(13) 
From 
(11) and (13), it follows 
that 
4A’C’ 
= (A + C>” - G2 cos(28 + S). 
Combining 
with 
(12) yields, 
for an arbitrary 
8 
(14) 
X E Bt2 - 4A’C’ 
= G2 sin2 (20 + S) + G2 cos’(28 
+ 6) - (A + C)’ 
=G2-(A+C)2=~2+(~-~)2-(A+C)2 
- 8’ 
- 
- 4AC, 
(15) 
which 
is therefore 
invariant 
under 
rotation. 
This 
invari- 
ant therefore 
provides 
a useful 
shortcut 
to determining 
the shape represented 
by a QUADRATIC 
CURVE. 
Choos- 
ing B to make 
B’ = 0 (see QUADRATIC 
EQUATION), 
the 
curve takes on the form 
A/x2 + C’y’ 
+ D’x 
+ E’y 
+ F = 0. 
(16) 
COMPLETING 
THE 
SQUARE 
and defining 
new variables 
gives

Without

take the sign of H to be pos- 
itive.

Disk 
An n-D 
disk 
(or 
DISC) 
of RADIUS 
F is the collection 
of 
points 
of distance 
5 
F (CLOSED 
DISK) 
or 
< T (OPEN 
DISK) 
from 
a fixed point 
in EUCLIDEAN 
n-space. 
A disk 
is the SHADOW 
of a BALL 
on a PLANE 
PERPENDICULAR 
to the BALL-RADIANT 
POINT 
line. 
The n-disk 
for n > 3 is called 
a BALL, 
and the boundary 
- 
of the n-disk 
is a (n - I)-HYPERSPHERE. 
The 
standard 
n-disk, 
denoted 
IIB” (or B”), 
has its center 
at the ORIGIN 
and has RADIUS 
T = 1.

A detailed

for 
this entry, 
Given

find 
the smallest 
RADIUS

re- 
quired 
for rz equal

to completely 
cover the

For 
a symmetrical

r(5) 
= 
4 -

0.6180340.. 
., where 4 is the GOLDEN 
RATIO. 
However, 
the radius 
can be reduced 
in the general 
disk covering 
problem 
where symmetry 
is not required. 
The first few 
such values 
are

Here,

to cos(0+4/2), 
where 8 and 4 are solutions 
to 
2 sin 8 - sin(0 + +4 + $) - sin(ti

Any two rectilinear 
figures 
with 
equal AREA can be dis- 
sected into a finite 
number 
of pieces to form 
each other.

WALLACE-B• LYAI-GERWEIN THEOREM. For 
minimal 
dissections 
of a TRIANGLE, 
PENTAGON, and 
OCTAGON into 
a SQUARE, see Stewart 
(1987, 
pp. 169- 
170) and Ball 
and Coxeter 
(1987, 
pp. 89-91). 
The TRI- 
ANGLE to SQUARE dissection 
(HABERDASHER'S PROB- 
LEM) is particularly 
interesting 
because 
it can be built 
from 
hinged 
pieces 
which 
can be folded 
and 
unfolded 
to yield 
the two shapes 
(Gardner 
1961; 
Stewart 
1987, 
p. 169; Pappas 
1989). 
Laczkovich 
(1988) 
p roved 
that 
the 
CIRCLE 
can 
be 
squared 
in a finite 
number 
of dissections 
(N 105’). 
F’ur- 
thermore, 
any shape 
whose 
boundary 
is composed 
of 
smoothly 
curving 
pieces can be dissected 
into a SQIJARE. 
The situation 
becomes 
considerably 
more 
difficult 
mov- 
ing 
from 
2-D to 3-D. 
In general, 
a POLYHEDRON can- 
not 
be dissected 
into 
other 
POLYHEDRA of a specified 
type. 
A CUBE can be dissected 
into 
n3 CUBES, 
where 
n is any INTEGER. In 1900, 
Dehn 
proved 
that 
not 
ev- 
ery PRISM cannot 
be dissected 
into 
a TETRAHEDRON 
(Lenhard 
1962, 
Ball 
and 
Coxeter 
1987) 
The 
third 
of 
HILBERT'S PROBLEMS asks for the determination 
of two 
TETRAHEDRA 
which 
cannot 
be decomposed 
into 
con- 
gruent 
TETRAHEDRA 
directly 
or by adjoining 
congru- 
ent TETRAHEDRA. 
Max 
Dehn 
showed this could 
not be 
done 
in 1902, and W. F. Kagon 
obtained 
the same re- 
sult 
independently 
in 1903. 
A quantity 
growing 
out of 
Dehn’s 
work which 
can be used to analyze 
the possibil- 
ity of performing 
a given 
solid 
dissection 
is the DERN 
INVARIANT.

as (0, 0) and the sec- 
ond as (IC, 0), which 
defines 
the X-AXIS. 
The

2 points 
need two coordinates 
each.

Distribution 
The 
distribution 
of a variable 
is a description 
of the rel- 
ative 
numbers 
of times 
each possible 
outcome 
will occur 
in a number 
of trials. 
The function 
describing 
the distri- 
bution 
is called 
the 
PROBABILITY 
FUNCTION, 
and the 
function 
describing 
the probability 
that 
a given 
value or 
any value 
smaller 
than 
it will 
occur 
is called 
the DIS- 
TRIBUTION 
FUNCTION. 
Formally, 
a distribution 
can be defined 
as a normalized 
MEASURE, 
and the distribution 
of a RANDOM 
VARIABLE 
z is the MEASURE 
PE on s’ defined 
by setting 
Pz(At) 
= P{s 
E S : x(s) E A’}, 
where 
(S, s, P) 
is a PROBABILITY 
SPACE, 
(S,s) 
is a 
MEASURABLE 
SPACE, 
and 
P 
a MEASURE 
on s with 
P(S) 
= 1.

Distribution

The 
distribution 
function 
D(x), 
sometimes 
also called 
the 
PROBABILITY 
DISTRIBUTION 
FUNCTION, 
describes 
the probability 
that 
a trial 
X takes 
on a value 
less than 
or equal 
to a number 
z. 
The 
distribution 
function 
is 
therefore 
related

the derivative 
of the 
distribution 
function 
P(x) 
= D!(x) 
= [P(x’& 
= P(x) 
- P(-m).

Similarly, 
the distribution

is related 
to a dis-

P(x) 
by 
D(x) 
= P(X

In general, 
there 
exist 
distributions 
which 
are neither 
continuous 
nor discrete. 
A JOINT

on two 
parameters:

D(x, y) = P(X

(4) 
Dx(x) 
= D(x,

(5) 
D,(Y) 
= D(W,Y)- 
(6) 
Similarly, 
a multiple 
distribution 
function 
can be defined 
if outcomes 
depend 
on n. parameters: 
D(al,. 
. . ,a,) 
E P(XI 
5 al,. . . ,xn 5 a,). 
(7) 
Given 
a continuous 
P(x), 
assume 
you wish to generate 
numbers 
distributed 
as P(x) 
using 
a random 
number 
generator. 
If the random 
number 
generator 
yields 
a uni- 
formly 
distributed 
value 
yi in [O,l] for each trial 
i, then 
compute 
-

D(x)

(8) 
The 
FORMULA 
connecting 
yi with 
a variable 
distributed 
as P(x) 
is then 
xi = D-‘(yi), 
(9) 
where 
D-l 
(x) is the inverse 
function 
of D(x). 
For ex- 
ample, 
if P(X) 
were a GAUSSIAN 
DISTRIBUTION 
so that 
D(x) = i [l+erf(z)],

then

Distribution 
(Functional) 
A functional 
distribution, 
also called 
a GENERALIZED 
FUNCTION, is a generalization 
of the concept 
of a func- 
tion. 
Functional 
distributions 
are defined 
as continuous 
linear 
FUNCTIONALS over a SPACE of infinitely 
differen- 
tiable 
functions 
such that 
all continuous 
functions 
have 
SCHWARZIAN DERIVATIVES which 
are themselves 
distri- 
butions. 
The 
most 
commonly 
encountered 
functional 
distribution 
is the DELTA FUNCTION.

Divide 
To divide 
is to perform 
the operation 
of DIVISION, 
i.e., 
to see how many 
time 
a DIVHOR 
d goes into 
another 
number 
n. n divided 
by d is written 
n/d 
or n + d. The 
result 
need not be an INTEGER, 
but 
if it is, some addi- 
tional 
terminology 
is used. 
din is read “d divides 
n” and 
means 
that 
d is a PROPER 
DIVISOR 
of n. In this case, n 
is said to be DIVISIBLE 
by d. Clearly, 
lln 
and nln. 
By 
convention,

0 (Hardy

Dixon’s 
Factorization 
Method 
In order 
to find INTEGERS =1: and y such that 
X 2 s y2 (mod 
n) 
(1) 
( a 
modified 
form 
of 
FERMAT'S 
FACTORIZATION 
METHOD), 
in which 
case there 
is a 50% chance 
that 
GCD(n,x 
- y) is a FACTOR of n, choose 
a RANDOM 
INTEGER ri, compute 
g(ri) 
z ~~~ (mod 
n) , 
(2) 
and try to factor 
g(Ti). 
If g(ri) 
is not easily 
factorable 
(up to some 
small 
trial 
divisor 
d), try 
another 
T;. 
In 
practice, 
the trial 
TS are usually 
taken 
to be Lfi] 
+ k, 
with 
/G = 1, 2, . . . , which 
allows 
the QUADRATIC SIEVE 
FACTORIZATION METHOD to be used. 
Continue 
finding 
and factoring 
g(ri)s 
until 
1v E nd are found, 
where ;ly is 
the PRIME COUNTING FUNCTION. 
Now for each g(Ti), 
write 
g(r;) = plia1ip2ia2i , , l pNiaNi, 
(3) 
and formthe 
EXPONENT VECTOR 
Now, 
if ski are even for any k, then 
g(Ti) 
is a SQUARE 
NUMBER and we have found 
a solution 
to (1). 
If not, 
look 
for a linear 
combination 
c. 
c~v(T~) 
such that 
the 
z 
elements 
are all even, i.e., 
+ 
c2 
- - 
LOJ 
Since 
this must 
be solved 
only 
mod 
2, the problem 
can 
be simplified 
by replacing 
the a+ 
with 
b 
ij 
(7) 
GAUSSIAN ELIMINATION 
can then 
be used to solve 
bc = z 
(8) 
for c, where z is a VECTOR equal 
to 0 (mod 
2). Once c 
is known, 
then 
we have 
k 

484 
Dixon-Ferrar 
Formula 
Dobiliski’s 
Formula 
where the products 
are taken 
over all k: for which 
ck = 1. 
Both 
sides 
are PERFECT 
SQUARES, 
so we have a 50% 
chance 
that 
this 
yields 
a nontrivial 
factor 
of n. 
If it 
does not, 
then we proceed 
to a different 
z and repeat 
the 
procedure. 
There 
is no guarantee 
that 
this method 
will 
yield 
a factor, 
but 
in practice 
it produces 
factors 
faster 
than 
any 
method 
using 
trial 
divisors. 
It is especially 
amenable 
to parallel 
processing, 
since each processor 
can 
work on a different 
value 
of T.

Dodecadodecahedron 
The 
UNIFORM POLYHEDRON Us6 whose DUAL POLY- 
HEDRON is the MEDIAL RHOMBIC 
TRIACONTAHEDRON. 
The 
solid 
is 
also 
called 
the 
GREAT DODECADODEC- 
AHEDRON, and 
its DUAL POLYHEDRON is also 
called 
the SMALL STELLATED TRIACONTAHEDRON. 
It can be 
obtained 
by TRUNCATING 
a GREAT DODECAHEDRON 
O~FACETING a ICOSIDODECAHEDRON with PENTAGONS 
and covering 
remaining 
open spaces with PENTAGRAMS 
(Holden 
1991, 
p. 
103). 
A FACETED version 
is the 
GREAT DODECAHEMICOSAHEDRON. The+dodecadodec- 
ahedronis 
an ARCHIMEDEAN SOLID STELLATION. 
The 
dodecadodecahedron 
has SCHL~FLI SYMBOL { $, 5) and 
WYTHOFF SYMBOL 2 1 8 5. Its faces are 12{g} 
+ 12{5}, 
and its C~RCUMRADIUS for unit 
edge length 
is

volume 
of any 
V~RONOI CELL around 
any sphere is at least as large as 
a regular

of20 
VERTICES, 30 EDGES, and 12 PENTAG- 
ONAL FACES. 
It 
is given

the 
SCHL;~FLI~YMBOL {5,3}. 
It 
is also UNIFORM POLY- 
HEDRON U23

has WYTHOFF SYMBOL 3125. 
The 
dodecahedron

in 
a regular 
DECAGONAL CROSS-SECTION (Holden
