About the Authors
Woody Leonhard’s tree-hugging tendencies date back to his years in the 
Boy Scouts, where he specialized in whittling divining rods, analyzing ptero-
dactyl droppings, and stammering at Girl Scouts. He’s written a whole lotta 
books, starting with Windows 3.1 Programming For Mere Mortals, back in 1992. 
Somewhat more recently, he’s created many For Dummies books, in multiple 
editions, covering myriad aspects of Windows 7, Vista, Windows XP, and 
Offi ce. Woody’s a Contributing Editor for Windows Secrets Newsletter 
(windowssecrets.com), and he runs his own blog at AskWoody.com, which 
is tied into a giant all-volunteer computer Q&A site that currently boasts 
more than 600,000 entries. If you have a question, you know where to go.
A decade ago, Woody moved to Phuket, Thailand, where he now lives 
with his wife, Duangkhae (better known as “Add”), and his father, George. 
Together, Woody and Add run Khun Woody’s Bakery and three Sandwich 
Shoppes. If you’re ever in Phuket, drop a line — Woody@AskWoody.com.
Katherine Murray’s big ambition in life was to be Dr. Doolittle when she 
grew up, and she’s getting pretty close. She writes (mostly) in a home offi ce 
surrounded by her many four-footed friends, her children (two-footed), and 
grandchildren. She’s been writing about computers, digital lifestyle, home 
business, parenting, and more since the 1980s, back when IBM PC XTs were 
cool and nobody had heard anything (yet) about new-fangled software called 
Microsoft Windows. Since the mid-80s, when she wrote her fi rst books on 
technology, Katherine has published more than 50 computer books on topics 
related to digital lifestyle, Microsoft Offi ce, and social and blogging technolo-
gies. In addition to her technical book writing, Katherine is the managing 
editor for The Educational Forum, an international research journal in edu-
cation published by Kappa Delta Pi (www.kdp.org). Katherine publishes a 
number of blogs, including BlogOffi ce, where she posts tips and Offi ce 
miscellanea. A long-time lover of the earth, Katherine was thrilled to be able 
to work on this project and has grown decidedly greener with every fi nished 
chapter. :)

Dedications
Woody: To Add, who put up with all sorts of problems while the books 
fi nally took form. To Dad, for providing great inspiration. To Claudette Moore 
and Ann Jaroncyk, the best agents a guy ever had, and to the editorial and 
production staff for bringing it all together. Most of all, to Kathy Murray, 
for doing the (vast!) lion’s share of the work to make this book a pioneering 
effort in an important and all-too-frequently neglected fi eld.
Katherine: To my grandbabies, Ruby and Henry. May they — and all our 
grandchildren — have beautiful blue skies; fresh, clean air; crystal clean 
waters; and a healthy, peaceful planet fl ourishing with life to pass on to the 
ones they love. 

Authors’ Acknowledgments
At the heart of the green movement in the world right now is the knowledge 
that we are all truly interconnected and interrelated. None of us works in a 
vacuum, and no project — this one included — is ever produced without the 
vision, talent, creativity, and effort of many people along the way. We’d like 
to thank the following people who helped take this book from a great idea to 
the reality you now hold in your hands:
Claudette Moore of Moore Literary Agency, for her support, insight, friend-
ship, and tried-and-true publishing experience;
Becky Huehls, Project Editor, for being this book’s champion, shepherding it 
through the various deadlines and processes that make a book happen;
Joe Hutsko, author, who jumped in and wrote Chapter 10 for us when the 
deadlines loomed large. Thanks, Joe! (Be sure to check out Joe’s green book, 
Green Gadgets For Dummies, Wiley 2009.)
Heidi Unger, Linda Morris, Kathy Simpson, Adam Vaughn, and all the produc-
tion staff for great line-by-line checking and editing. If you think this book 
looks great and reads well, their efforts had a lot to do with that.
Katherine would like to thank Woody for the opportunity to work with him 
on a topic so near and dear to her heart, and for his friendly and encouraging 
partnership.
And we’d both like to thank you, the reader, for caring about the planet, for 
believing you can do something about it, and for purchasing this book to 
begin making that difference.

Introduction
W
elcome to Green Home Computing For Dummies! 
It’s the first step in making a great green change for the planet. 
As you’ve no doubt noticed, green is all over the news. Green jobs, green 
products, green programs, green people. Well, maybe not green people. Yet.
But you don’t have to look far to see that the U.S. is — finally, some would 
say — waking up to the realities that our planet needs our attention and care. 
For decades, we’ve been pumping unhealthy chemicals into the air, using 
valuable resources as though there were no tomorrow, mowing down trees, 
and sinking drums of toxic waste in the middle of the ocean, thinking that the 
consequences of these actions were not our problems.
Today, we know that kind of “not my problem” thinking is the problem. And 
by picking up this book and resolving to make a green difference by making 
earth-friendly choices about your computer use, you have become part of the 
solution. Congratulations!
About This Book
Green Home Computers For Dummies is all about making good choices that 
reduce the wear and tear that our computing practices have on the planet. This 
book helps you learn about the power your computer, peripherals, and other 
tech equipment — like your game systems, PDAs, and mobile devices — are 
consuming right now, and puts it all in context so you can clearly see why that 
matters.
After you have a sense of the impact you’re making — called your carbon 
footprint — you learn a variety of ways to reduce your power consumption 
by changing your practices, upgrading your system, buying green, and much 
more. You’ll also learn how to dispose of old computer equipment in a way 
that is kind to the planet and find out how changing the way you think about 
work (telecommuting, anyone?) may be one of the greenest home computing 
possibilities around.

Green Home Computing For Dummies 
Foolish Assumptions
As we wrote this book, we envisioned you, the reader, as a person we were 
sitting with, sipping organically grown, free-trade coffee in a funky sidewalk 
cafe (that of course went all green long ago). We chatted about ways we can 
green the planet by expanding our awareness and exercising our choices 
about the way we use our computers. We made some assumptions about you 
and the type of information that would be most helpful to you as you start 
greening your home computing:
Our first assumption is that you care about what you’re hearing in the news 
about global warming, deforestation, water worries, species extinction, and 
more — and you’re wondering what you personally can do, through your 
computing choices, to help turn the tide. That’s a good place to begin!
We also assume that you know something about computers, but it’s not nec-
essary to know a whole lot. In this book, you’ll find examples for a collection 
of operating systems, from Windows XP to Vista to Windows 7 and Mac OS X. 
You’ll find lots of good green info, a huge range of resources, great practical 
eco-friendly ideas, and techniques, tips, and suggestions for greening your 
computing practices from the inside out.
We also assume you want to know how to modify the system you already 
have and perhaps either upgrade it or recycle it and buy a new greener 
system. You’ll find that information in Part II. 
We also assume that you want to understand how personal technology in 
all its forms — PCs, laptops, mobile devices, game systems, and more — 
contributes to our planetary challenges. You’ll find ways to evaluate the 
impact you’re already making, find practical ways to reduce that impact, 
and discover ways to reuse and recycle what you can.
How This Book Is Organized
Green Home Computing For Dummies is designed to give you the big, global 
picture (what is global warming and how are we contributing to it?) and then 
take you into the small stuff (how do I set up power management in my PC?); 
but you don’t have to approach any of the topics in a particular order. Each 
chapter stands on its own right, and if it contains the information you’re look-
ing for most, just jump right in — the water’s reasonably warm.
Here’s a quick look at what you’ll find in the various parts of the book:

3
 Introduction
Part I: Getting a Little Green 
Behind the Ears
Part I starts the book by exploring why greening your computer practice is 
important for the environment and helping you see how much of an impact 
you’re already making. In this part, you calculate the size of your carbon foot-
print and see how your power consumption contributes to the gas bubble 
that is warming the planet.
Part II: Choosing Your Green PC Path
Part II helps you take an up-close-and-personal look at your own computers 
and peripherals and get a sense of how many resources you’re using. Here 
you get practical information on how to upgrade your computer to make it 
greener, shop for a new green system, choose earth-friendly peripherals, and 
ultimately, recycle the computers you’ve got in a way that’s good for all of us.
Part III: Greener Under the Hood
Part III takes a closer look inside the computer for ways to reduce power 
consumption and cut down on other resources like paper, water, and time. 
In this part, you learn to set up power management in your computer, green 
your mobile devices, reduce the resources you use in printing, and use home 
networking to share resources throughout your house.
Part IV: Telecommuting, Teleconferencing, 
and Teleporting
Part IV explores ways in which you can green your practices by, first and 
foremost, using technology to work from home, which reduces your travel 
time, gas costs, and CO2 emissions right off the bat. This part also shows you 
how to set up a green home office and use cloud computing, teleconferenc-
ing, and other communication tools to be successful at work no matter where 
you’re working.

O
ur computers are hungry. Like most of the people 
you know, some computers (and mobile devices, 
and peripherals) have bigger appetites than others. This 
part of the book introduces you to green computing and 
shows you how you can start to get a handle on the natu-
ral and energy resources that get gobbled up when you 
use your computer, when you open the fridge, when you 
drive to the store. For every action there is a reaction, as 
you’ll see in this part of the book, and in some cases, 
those actions are turning up the temperature on global 
warming. The good news is that awareness is the first part 
of positive change, and you’ll have lots of opportunity for 
that in this part of the book. Today is a good day to find 
out where all that energy is going and choose to manage it 
wisely (so it doesn’t manage you!).

Chapter 1
What Is Green Computing?
In This Chapter
▶ Defining green computing
▶ Getting past our past
▶ Tugging at the roots of global warming 
▶ Getting started with green computing
▶ Learning green lingo
▶ Greening computers — and mobile devices, too
▶ Starting with the easy stuff
C
ontrary to what Kermit the Frog says, today it’s pretty easy to be green. 
Take a look at any media channel — TV, Web, or print — and you’re 
sure to see an ad about the latest must-have green product for your home, 
car, kitchen, or office. Organic is in and consumers are spending more and 
more on items that manufacturers promise are earth friendly.
Computer manufacturers are right there in the mix. Dell is offering a laptop 
made of 95 percent recycled materials; Apple is touting its greenest MacBook 
yet; and most hardware vendors are busy producing four-color glossy mar-
keting materials that tell you how environmentally conscious they are and 
how good you can feel when you write that check or sign the credit card slip.
This chapter gives you a quick look at what green home computing is — and 
isn’t. (Hint: It doesn’t mean going out and buying all new green-colored com-
puter equipment.) Here, we also help you start thinking about simple ideas 
that you can put into action right away to begin making your computing — 
and your life — a little greener.

Part I: Getting a Little Green Behind the Ears 
Knowing What Green Computing Means
You’ve probably noticed that people and corporations — big corporations — 
are suddenly all over the green. Perhaps that’s happening because environ-
mentalists’ ideas about conserving energy and reducing waste are catching 
on and people want to begin making changes. Of course, it’s also possible 
that businesses have discovered that green sells. And many people are dis-
covering that real green technology is more efficient and can save them some 
real cash.
The result is that more and more people are becoming aware that they need 
to make good choices about the way they use the earth’s resources — water, 
energy, land, and air. That’s where green computing fits in.
The overall goal of green home computing is to use our systems efficiently 
and effectively, being smart about the energy we’re consuming and respon-
sible about the way we dispose of the components we no longer need.
Green home computing asks you to interrupt your day-to-day habits and 
consider these five simple ways you can reduce your consumption, make the 
most of what you have, and be more conscious of your earth-impacting com-
puting choices:
 
1. Reuse what you can.
 
2. Rebuild or restore systems and peripheral devices.
 
3. Share resources.
 
4. Replace energy hogs with energy-efficient equipment.
 
5. Recycle safely.
Setting a green standard
A number of standards-setting organizations have been focused on greening 
technology for a while, and in this book, you find out how the resources each 
provides can guide you toward greener home computing.
 
✓ Energy Star: One organization you may already be familiar with is 
Energy Star. Created in 1992 by the U.S. Environmental Protection 
Agency (EPA), Energy Star offers consumers a way to know whether 
the manufactured item that they’re purchasing meets energy-efficient 
standards. You see the Energy Star logo on any electrical appliance or 
computer that meets the EPA’s standards. Other countries have adopted 
similar standards to encourage conscientious use of energy.

 Chapter 1: What Is Green Computing?
 
 To find out more about the Energy Star rating, go to www.energystar.gov.
 
✓ EPEAT: EPEAT is a program sponsored by the Green Electronics 
Council, which focuses on issues of electronics and sustainability. 
EPEAT is a green electronics “certification” program that helps consum-
ers learn more about the energy use of laptops, monitors, and desktop 
computers they are considering purchasing.
 
✓ Greenpeace Guide to Green Electronics: In the summer of 2006, the 
international environmental group Greenpeace began rating technology 
companies to gauge their progress in promises to reduce emissions, 
increase energy efficiency, and discontinue using toxic chemicals in 
their product manufacturing processes. In Figure 1-1, the Guide to Green 
Electronics chart from Version 11 shows the results of the March 2009 
rating. As you can see, by this rating, Nokia and Samsung lead the earth-
friendly tech companies, and Nintendo and HP pull up the rear.

Finding good green info
Searching online is always a good place to start when you want to find out 
more about any aspect of anything. But green is a popular topic, and it’s 
growing by leaps and bounds. In fact, if you just enter the word green in a 
search engine and press Enter, you’ll get more than one billion (yes, with a 
“b”) results! How can you narrow your search and find good information on 
the topics you want to research? Here are a few ideas to get you started:

10
Part I: Getting a Little Green Behind the Ears 
 
✓ Keep an eye out for greenwashing. Greenwashing is the phrase used to 
describe companies that are using earth-friendly language to describe 
products that really aren’t. In other words, their environmental con-
sciousness is more marketing ploy than green effort. Throughout this 
book, you’ll learn ways you can determine that a company is truly 
offering a green product or service, but in short, green companies who 
deliver on their promises care about energy efficiency, use materials 
and manufacturing processes that minimize the use of resources and 
the production of waste, and make it easy for consumers to dispose of 
equipment or devices they no longer use.
 
✓ Stick with objective sources. Computer manufacturers and vendors may 
give you the straight scoop on the green capabilities of the items they’re 
selling, but when you’re doing your homework to see how systems 
compare and what really matters in terms of energy efficiency, look for 
media sources (like www.treehugger.com/buygreen), university 
sites, or third-party research organizations that can supply data based 
on research.
 
✓ Use wikis wisely. Wikiagreen, at http://green.wikia.com, has a 
great green wiki that brings together all kinds of resources in one handy-
dandy reference. As always, remember that open posting and editing 
of wiki entries means that not everything there is vetted; look for other 
sources to back up the information you find before you write a big check 
or otherwise wager something important.
 
✓ Whenever possible, go straight to the source. When you hear 
about a new study on global warming (released, for instance, by the 
Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change), go directly to that orga-
nization’s official site and see what they have to say. No need to search 
through blogs or articles when you can get the original document and 
see the charts and data yourself.
 
✓ Know the names in the business. If you’re interested in one area more 
than another — say computer recycling is a big hot button for you — 
know who the experts are in that area and subscribe to their blogs, read 
their books, and follow the publications that their comments appear in.
As you dig deeper into green computing topics later in this book, you find 
help for researching specific topics and products, too.
Getting Started with Green Computing
Throughout this book, you build on the simple ideas of green computing in 
a variety of ways. Here you find an overview of how home computing can be 
greener and also how technology can improve efficiency and help you con-
sume fewer resources. 

11
 Chapter 1: What Is Green Computing?
What we cover in this section is just the tip of the rapidly melting iceberg. 
For details about how to get started with any of these topics, flip to the chap-
ter we cross reference.
Assessing your impact
So now that you know a bit more about what’s behind the need to green, 
you’re probably wondering what you can do about it. Awareness is a good 
place to start. Take a moment and look around. Wherever you’re reading — 
in the living room or your home office — notice the energy that’s being used 
around you. What kind of lights are shining, and how many are there? Is the 
room (if you’re in one) hot or cool? What’s fueling that? Notice devices, com-
puters, fans, and MP3 players. Anything that gleams, notice it. As I write this, 
I can see eight different devices that are drawing electric current (plus the 
furnace, which I can hear and feel but not see). 
In Chapter 2, you can explore in detail the impact you make on your environ-
ment every day. You find steps for using a carbon footprint calculator to find 
out where you can conserve energy and see how your habits and practices 
contribute to increased carbon in the atmosphere.
 
In Chapter 4, you find tips and steps for assessing your home and home com-
puting setup, including all the points where you’re consuming power. Make 
tuning in to the power use in your surroundings part of your normal coming-
and-going routine. Noticing your surroundings when you first enter a room, 
and again as you’re ready to leave, will help you stay awake to the energy you 
can conserve. For example, when you leave an average 150-watt computer run-
ning for a year, it uses an amount of energy equal to half a ton of coal (that’s 
1,000 pounds) or more than 100 gallons of oil.
 
According to the Consumer Electronics Association’s April 2008 Market 
Research Report: Trends in CE Use, Recycle and Removal, the average U.S. 
household includes approximately 24 electronic products.
If you’re in your own home, of course, you can control the lights, the systems 
drawing power, the temperature, and the number of peripherals you leave on 
all day. 
Exercising your purchasing power
People are voting green with their dollars more than ever before. The public 
reaction to earth-friendly products may be occurring, in part, because An 
Inconvenient Truth, the popular movie about the problem of global warming, 

12
Part I: Getting a Little Green Behind the Ears 
struck a chord. Perhaps the public is tired and suspicious of potentially haz-
ardous chemicals, or craves a simpler, more pure life. Whatever the reasons, 
green marketing is at an all-time high, and you can be sure that green initia-
tives are growing.
When you purchase a new computer or mobile device, do the legwork to find 
out the science behind the manufacturer’s promises. Find information from 
objective sources to help you evaluate the best and most environmentally 
responsible choice for your home and family. Read user ratings and reviews; 
talk to other users if possible; and put time into weighing out the right choice. 
Your new computer or device will be part of your life for a while — maybe 
several years — using energy you’ll be paying for. Some manufacturers offer 
trade-in programs when you purchase new computers; they’ll dispose of your 
old computer safely for you. 
In Chapter 6, you find tips for cutting through the greenwashing and finding a 
truly green new computer. In Chapter 10, you can check out a few green gad-
gets to go with your new computer and other devices.
Thinking efficiency
We don’t think people set out to be deliberately wasteful. But in the world in 
which we live, efficiency takes a little work, at least up front. It doesn’t help 
that technology changes so rapidly that keeping up can be a part-time job. 
That’s why we show you ways technology can help you achieve efficiency 
and then forget about it, or least achieve efficiency with as little maintenance 
as possible. 
Chapter 4 helps you take stock and begin thinking about the systems in your 
house, whether it’s your computer system or your method for recharging 
devices or plugging in all your electronics. You find out how to
 
✓ Become aware of your own energy use.
 
✓ Take steps to increase energy efficiency at home.
 
✓ Begin to look for alternatives to energy use or spending.
 
✓ Discover how much power your computer needs.
You can also improve efficiency by doing the following:
 
✓ Rebuild, purchase, or streamline systems and peripherals to green them 
up. (See Chapters 5 and 6.)

13
 Chapter 1: What Is Green Computing?
 
✓ Share resources to coordinate systems and peripheral use. (See Chapter 7.)
 
✓ Improve your system and manage its power. (Check out Chapter 9, 
which helps you set the power management features that come with 
your operating system.)
Being efficient with your computer use means powering up when you need it, 
consolidating tasks, and powering down when you’re through. It means using 
only what you need and coordinating your peripheral use. With a little reor-
ganizing and changing the way you work with your computer, you can get a 
little greener.
Reducing consumption
Consumers come in all stripes. Chances are, if you’re looking for ways to be 
more efficient in the way you use your computer and other technologies, you 
can also trim back the way you consume collateral products and resources. 
For example:
 
✓ Paper recycling and conservation can make a huge difference not only 
in the volume of paper you go through in your office, but also in the way 
you feel about your green efforts and your overall impact on important, 
big-picture issues like reforestation and sustainable resources. You can 
reduce your paper consumption by as much as 50 percent when you 
adopt a simple plan to use only recycled paper for in-office documents; 
print on both sides of the page; and use electronic documents whenever 
possible. And that’s not small potatoes, in terms of good care of the 
earth. In Chapter 11, we discuss greener printing in more depth.
 
✓ Virtualization and telecommuting can make the most of your time and 
resources. Working in a virtual environment and telecommuting enables 
you to complete your work without traveling to the office, which saves 
gas, travel time, and CO2 emissions. You learn all about telecommuting — 
including making the case to your boss — in Part IV. 
Reducing waste (and watching where 
you throw it)
Waste of all kinds is a huge problem. Landfills are brimming; communities 
are sprawling; wildlife has less room to roam and do what wildlife does. 
The problem of computer dumping has become a mountain of an issue for 

14
Part I: Getting a Little Green Behind the Ears 
developing countries. Because most computers — even those sold today — 
are manufactured with a number of toxic chemicals, they’re a hazard when 
they’re dumped without thought about proper disposal. Although it’s illegal 
to do so, much of the toxic e-waste that we generate when we mindlessly 
toss out our computers, cellphones, televisions, and other devices is pack-
aged and shipped to China and Africa, where families burn the materials to 
retrieve the precious metals and earn a small wage. The result is that chil-
dren are growing up in villages where the streets are mounded with huge 
hills of discarded tech equipment, and the air has a sickening smog of burn-
ing chemicals.
 
For a disturbing look at the illegal practice of computer dumping, see this 
video report from 60 Minutes at www.engadget.com/2008/11/10/video-
chinas-toxic-wastelands-of-consumer-electronics-revealed.
To avoid these problems, you can make sure you get the most out of the 
computing equipment you have (see Chapter 5) and recycle your comput-
ers and devices safely. A number of computer manufacturers and vendors 
offer reuse and recycling programs that enable you to donate or recycle your 
electronics. Getting rid of your equipment safely is such a big issue that we 
devote all of Chapter 8 to this topic.
Speaking Green Jargon
Even though the word green can mean you’re anything from financially flush 
to jealous to inexperienced to seasick, when you’re talking about earth-
friendly phrases, there’s a whole new language developing. Here are a few 
green (as in, environment-friendly) words and phrases you can throw around 
at your next dinner party:
 
✓ Biofuel is energy created from renewable, biological sources, like plants, 
and used for heat, electricity, or fuel.
 
✓ Biomimicry uses designs based on patterns and processes in nature 
to solve human problems (for example, studying a leaf to design 
solar cells).
 
✓ Brown power/energy is the type of energy that results from the com-
bustion of nonrenewable fuels (oil, gas, coal) and contributes to green-
house gases.
 
✓ Carbon footprint refers to the human contribution to the emission of 
greenhouse gases in the atmosphere.
 
✓ Closed-loop recycling uses a recycled product to manufacturer a new 
product.

15
 Chapter 1: What Is Green Computing?
 
✓ Closed-loop supply chain is a supply process in which all wastes created 
during the production of a product are reused, recycled, or composted.
 
✓ Ecological footprint is the overall human use of natural resources com-
pared to the capability of the earth to replenish or renew them.
 
✓ Fair trade is an international trading partnership that focuses on equi-
table trade, especially among producers who have often been exploited 
in the traditional market system.
 
✓ Geothermal energy is a natural form of heat energy from steam and hot 
water sources below the earth’s surface.
 
✓ Global warming is the increasing temperature of the earth’s surface and 
atmosphere as a result of greenhouse gases.
 
✓ Green design is used to create products, buildings, services, and pro-
cesses that are in tune with environmental needs, create greater effi-
ciency, and reduce consumption.
 
✓ Greenhouse effect is the trapping of heat within the earth’s atmosphere; 
this effect is caused by greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide.
 
✓ Renewable energy is energy that comes from non-fossil fuel sources, 
and it renews naturally. It can include wind, hydro, geothermal, or solar 
energy.
 
✓ Sustainability refers to the ability to meet environmental, social, and 
economic needs effectively over time.
 
✓ Zero waste is a system of production that seeks to eliminate waste and 
toxic materials through conservation and recovery of resources.

Chapter 2
Checking Out Your 
Carbon Footprint
In This Chapter
▶ Gauging your impact on the earth
▶ Learning what goes into your carbon footprint
▶ Calculating your carbon footprint
▶ Lessening your CO2 contribution
▶ Thinking through carbon offsets
T
he phrase carbon footprint caught on because it offers a simple way to 
share an important message: We all share in the responsibility to do 
something about global warming.
A footprint is a personal thing — nobody else has a footprint quite like yours. 
In the same way, your carbon footprint is unique. It’s the total of all the CO2 
(carbon dioxide) that your activities directly and indirectly contribute to the 
environment.
We can’t change the sizes of our real, physical footprints; however, we can 
change the sizes of the carbon footprints we currently make. By discovering 
where you’re currently using outdated technologies or accidentally or uncon-
sciously burning fuel that you don’t need to burn, you can reduce your foot-
print’s size and be a little kinder to the earth. Taking a closer look helps you 
learn more about ways you can shrink your footprint — by making simple 
choices about things like lightbulbs and power supplies. And the best thing 
about that is that if we all make small, simple changes to the way we use 
energy, it translates to a whopping reduction to carbon emissions all over 
the earth.

18
Part I: Getting a Little Green Behind the Ears 
In this chapter, you find out a little bit about the science so you can see clearly 
what contributes to the CO2 pumping into the atmosphere. You also discover 
online resources to help you calculate your footprint, and the sections in this 
chapter walk you through a couple of especially helpful calculators.
Knowing Your Carbon Footprint ABCs
Focusing on carbon emissions is important because carbon dioxide is a 
greenhouse gas. 
You’ve probably heard about the greenhouse effect and know that it has 
something to do with global warming. It doesn’t mean you should avoid 
greenhouses or that the earth will soon become a kind of hothouse in which 
only the most exotic among us can thrive. In the most basic terms, the green-
house effect is the warming that happens when solar radiation is trapped by 
the atmosphere.
Here’s how it works: In the natural course of events, sunlight shines down 
on the earth, and most of that light is absorbed and warms the surface of the 
planet; some of that warmth is then radiated back out into space. Not all of it 
reaches space, because greenhouse gases, which are made up of carbon diox-
ide (CO2), methane, nitrous oxide, and fluorocarbons, trap a percentage of 
the warmth in the lower part of the atmosphere. The more greenhouse gases 
there are, the hotter the earth and air gets. And as the earth’s temperature 
rises, the polar ice caps melt (you’ve seen the heartbreaking commercials 
showing the polar bears in trouble, no doubt); the seas rise; farming cycles 
are disrupted; and new strains of viruses and who-knows-what-else appear. 
And that may be just the good news.
Some of the components of greenhouse gases occur because of natural pro-
cesses; in fact, simple water vapor is the single biggest contributor. But the 
second biggest contributor is CO2, which can range from 9 to 26 percent of 
all greenhouse gases. The amount of CO2 is one factor we can do something 
about — and that’s what you’re affecting when you reduce your carbon 
footprint.
The carbon cycle: Don’t hold your breath!
Yes, when you exhale, you add carbon dioxide to the atmosphere. But that 
doesn’t mean you have to breathe less — or hold your breath! Some carbon 
dioxide is part of the natural carbon cycle. Green landscapes, including 
trees, grass, plants, and shrubs, all absorb the carbon dioxide we exhale 

19
 Chapter 2: Checking Out Your Carbon Footprint
and convert it to oxygen during photosynthesis, which is the process plants 
use to turn sunlight, water, and carbon dioxide into oxygen and energy. 
Photosynthesis also helps reduce other chemicals — such as nitrogen 
oxides, ozone, and more — that contribute to greenhouse gases. 
Even indoors, plants can refresh your air supply by converting the air you’ve 
already breathed to oxygen. But here’s a lesson I learned the hard way — 
don’t hang a plant directly above your workspace. One false move with the 
watering can, and that monitor is history!
The emission and reduction of gases is all part of a natural cycle, but this 
cycle can handle only so much carbon. Many things people do contribute to 
excess carbon in the atmosphere.
Connecting fossil fuels to carbon emissions
Fossil fuels that we burn for energy are the largest contributors of the type 
of CO2 that we need to reduce. Materials we use for transportation, heating, 
cooking, and manufacturing burn some kind of fossil fuel. Fossil fuel con-
sumption has skyrocketed over the last 50 years, and you’re sure to recog-
nize these fossil fuels:
 
✓ Oil
 
✓ Coal
 
✓ Natural gas
Figure 2-1 shows two charts based on data from the nonprofit group Institute 
for Energy Research; these charts break down of the ways that we produce 
and use energy in the U.S. As you can see, fossil fuels are the most abun-
dantly produced resources, and electricity gets the lion’s share of use. That’s 
a great reason to get serious about reducing your carbon footprint!
Half of all the electricity used in the U.S. comes from burning coal. And even 
though coal is a nonrenewable energy source (meaning, when it’s gone, it’s 
gone), there’s no chance that scientists can turn that boat around any time 
soon. Coal is dirty (if you’ve ever poured charcoal briquettes into the grill, 
you know that), and when it burns, it pumps bad stuff into the air, adding to 
global warming, creating acid rain, and polluting water.
 
When you use online calculators discussed later in this chapter, these calcula-
tors help you assess how your everyday activities use fossil fuels and make up 
your individual carbon footprint.

A lump of clean coal in your stocking
Have you heard the buzz about clean coal? If so, 
you might wonder how can coal be clean — and 
what turns it into a viable idea for green energy. 
Because coal is so cheap and handy (for now), 
it’s relatively easy to get and easy to use. Clean 
coal technology puts the same dirty coal through 
a process that purifies it before it burns. Through 
techniques like coal washing and carbon stor-
age, the damaging effects of coal can be dra-
matically limited (less acid rain) while other true 
green technologies develop.
As good as it sounds, clean coal is still a bit of a 
pipe dream. Right now, we don’t have a practi-
cal way to contain carbon dioxide, but that could 
change. For instance, the World Resources 
Institute (WRI), an environmental think tank with 
a mission of working to protect the earth’s envi-
ronment, encourages a practice called carbon 
capture and storage (CCS). Using this approach, 
we can capture, transport, and lock away carbon 
in secure storage deep in the bowels of the earth 
(or, in scientist’s lingo, “deep subsurface geolog-
ical formations”), keeping the carbon separated 
from the planet’s greenhouse gas layer, which is 
where it contributes to global warming.
As you can imagine, people passionately argue 
both sides of this possibility! Even the idea’s 
supporters suggest that it’s a temporary fix that 
would manage CO2 production and release only 
until our green technologies develop enough to 
balance the release. Rachel Carson, where are 
you when we need you?

 Chapter 2: Checking Out Your Carbon Footprint
Facing the Facts: Calculate 
Your Carbon Footprint
It’s a bit mind-blowing when you think about it: Everything really does 
matter, even small, seemingly inconsequential choices. Your choice to leave 
the computer on all day or turn it off before you leave for the office has an 
impact. Leaving your cell phone plugged in overnight when it’s already fully 
charged really does matter. Using regular incandescent bulbs instead of 
energy-saving bulbs, forgetting to change your furnace filters, and buying lots 
of packaged foods has an effect — on your personal health, the health of your 
home, and the overall health of the planet.
So where can you start? Begin by finding out how much you’re already doing, 
and how much more you can do, to shrink your carbon footprint. A number 
of environmental groups have developed carbon footprint calculators to help 
you discover how much of an impact you already make on the environment. 
The following sections walk you through using a few popular calculators.
 
Different calculators use different means to evaluate your carbon footprint, so 
don’t be surprised if you receive unique numbers on various sites. Use the 
results to learn more about ways you can further reduce your carbon output 
instead of focusing on the numbers.
The Nature Conservancy’s carbon 
footprint calculator
The Nature Conservancy site publishes a variety of resources that promote 
respectful care of nature and all life. The Nature Conservancy’s carbon foot-
print calculator, which is available at http://nature.org/initiatives/
climatechange/calculator, is all about choice. By thinking through the 
simple little choices you make on a daily basis as you drive around town 
taking the kids to school and soccer practice, as you print the draft of the 
report for this afternoon’s meeting, as you consider whether to fix pasta or 
pot roast for supper, you can reduce the greenhouse gases that your actions 
contribute to the environment.
The Nature Conservancy’s calculator helps you think through four key areas 
in your life: home energy, driving and flying, food and diet, and recycling and 
waste — and it gives you the option to calculate your whole family’s foot-
print. Although the Nature Conservancy is a U.S. carbon calculator, Table 2-1 
offers some carbon calculators used in the European Union.

When using these calculators, choose the family option whenever possible — 
it will give you a more accurate assessment of the total impact of your house-
hold. And that means you and your family members can share in the glory as 
you watch your totals drop.
Doing the carbon math
Ready to find out where you stand? Follow these steps to discover the size of 
your carbon footprint at Nature Conservancy:
 
1. Open your Web browser and go to http://nature.org/initiatives/
climatechange/calculator.
 
 The Carbon Footprint Calculator: What’s My Carbon Footprint? page 
opens with the Get Started tab displayed.
 
2. Click the drop-down menu arrow and choose the number of people in 
your household.
 
3. Click the Calculate for Me Only button if you want to calculate your 
own carbon footprint, or click the Calculate for My Household button 
if you want to calculate the footprint for your entire household.
 
 As Figure 2-2 shows, on the Home Energy tab, you answer a series 
of questions about the type of home you have and the efforts you’ve 
already taken to reduce your energy use.
 
 After you answer the first two questions, the calculator figures your esti-
mated household impact. Don’t panic! The number seems huge (espe-
cially if you’ve already done a little homework and know what a good 
range is supposed to be), but as you go through the other questions, the 
calculator subtracts from the total when you give green answers. (And it 
sometimes adds to the total when you give not-so-green responses.)

4. Answer the remaining questions on the Home Energy tab. 
 
 The two indicators at the bottom of the page (see Figure 2-3) show you 
how well (or how poorly) you’re doing, compared to the national aver-
ages for home energy use and greenhouse gas emissions. 
 
Figure 2-3:

 Notice that the state you live in has a big impact on the totals because 
some states have technologies in place to generate cleaner electricity 
than others. If you’re not sure whether your electricity provider offers a 
green energy program, ask! 
 
5. Click Continue to move on to the Driving & Flying tab.
 
 If you have a house full of teenagers, multiple cars, or a big family 
Hummer, take a deep breath before answering the next set of questions. 
It’s not going to be pretty.

of any question. It’s not necessary to click the link; the additional infor-
mation pops up in a tip box. To close the box, simply move the mouse 
pointer to another location on the page.
 
6. Answer the questions in the Driving & Flying tab.
 
 Here you get the chance to enter the number of cars you have and the 
number of miles you drive, and you can choose the time period you’re 
measuring. You’re asked how well you do (or don’t) service your car. 
Let the calculator know how often you fly.
 
 Are you a homebody? The environment thanks you. You still need to 
change your car’s air filter and keep the tires inflated, though.
 
7. Click Continue to move to the Food & Diet tab.
 
 These questions relate to your eating habits, whether you cook and eat 
at home or dine out. Food preparation and consumption is a big part of 
CO2 emissions because of the interrelated nature of growing, preparing, 
and consuming food.
 
 In general, eating locally produced foods — both produce and meat — is 
better for the environment. On average, food offered in restaurants trav-
els across three states to get to your plate!
 
8. Click Continue to move to the Recycling & Waste tab.
 
 Chances are that you’re already tuned in to recycling cans, bottles, and 
plastics. Most U.S. cities offer recycling programs that enable residents 
to recycle almost as easily as they put out the trash. On this tab, let the 
calculator know how much you recycle and whether you’re currently 
composting. 
 
9. Click Continue and read your results!

Deciphering your results
So how did you do? It’s possible that your carbon footprint shocks you — 
especially if you live in a U.S. state where green technologies haven’t quite 
caught on yet. The final page of the Nature Conservancy’s carbon footprint 
calculator shows you the total greenhouse gas emissions for the group-
ing you selected (individual or household) and ranks your results against 
national and world averages. (See Figure 2-4.) At the bottom of the page, you 
can see clearly how your behaviors in the various areas contribute to CO2 
emissions, and you can compare that against national averages.

Moving toward personal sustainability
Getting a quick picture of your carbon emissions with the Nature 
Conservancy’s calculator is a great place to start, but what if you look at the 
greening of your efforts as a long-term relationship? Like any other big thing 
we try to change about our lives, changing our thinking about our impact on 
the environment is an ongoing project. 
The site MakeMeSustainable.com helps you think through that kind of para-
digm shift in your life, getting you in touch with how you feel about the envi-
ronment. It provides you with fun and effective tools to help you manage it. 
A strong part of Make Me Sustainable is the community component, which 
helps you reinforce your dedication to green efforts by connecting with 
friends, family members, and like-minded people in your state, nation, or 
around the globe.
Make Me Sustainable calls its carbon footprint calculator the Carbon and 
Energy Portfolio Manager (CEPM). The online tool tracks your energy use and 
options over time, calculates your savings, and provides you with a range of 
sustainable actions that you can add to your routine.
To get started with the CEPM, follow these steps:
 
1. Go to www.makemesustainable.com.
 
2. Click Sign Up and answer a few questions about yourself.
 
 MakeMeSustainable.com is free, so don’t worry that you’ll be asked to 
subscribe for a fee.
 
 When you sign up, a profile is created for you, which you use to track 
the effects of your green efforts over time. As you work on your profile, 
you’re asked questions about your home, your transportation, and your 
lifestyle.
 
3. Review and personalize your profile.
 
 Your profile page doesn’t show much information at first, but this is 
where your sustainable efforts begin. On the profile page, you can invite 
friends to join you, join the community, and track green choices that 
you want to add to your life. You can also customize your profile by 
adding a photo, describing yourself, and inviting businesses to join you 
and “grow your tree,” as Figure 2-5 shows.

Tallying your ecological footprint
With just a little bit of searching, you’ll discover another kind of calculator, 
one that measures your ecological footprint. The ecological footprint is dif-
ferent from a carbon footprint in that it measures the full range of human 
consumption of resources and compares that against the Earth’s capacity 
to generate those resources. According to the Global Footprint Network, an 
international organization working to influence decision makers toward sus-
tainability, the ecological footprint of the earth’s human population is now 23 
percent over capacity.
You can take the Ecological Footprint Quiz (at www.myfootprint.org) to 
find out how much of a demand your lifestyle makes on the natural world 
around you.
You may find that some calculators figure carbon footprints based on a life-
cycle assessment (LCA) model, which takes ecological impact into account. 
When you look at carbon emissions from a life-cycle perspective, you take 
into account all energy and resources used (for example, the metals, energy, 
plastic, and more used to create your computer) from the time the item is 
created until the time you responsibly dispose of it.
Reducing Your Footprint
Once you know the size of your carbon footprint, you can begin to look for 
ways to reduce the impact you’re having on the world around you. Whether 
you’re way over the national or world averages or biking along in a pretty 
green space, you can make improvements to economize the energy you use 
and reduce the bills you pay.
Basically, we’re talking about making chances in three key areas:
 
✓ The way you run your home: In this arena, technology can help in many 
ways. Check out Chapter 3, which shows you how technology and your 
energy use intersect. Parts II and III of this book help you keep your 
home or home office greener with PC power management, greener tech-
nology purchases, and more.

 Other green home features, such as insulation, landscaping, and build-
ing materials, are beyond the scope of a computing book. If you want to 
explore ways to further green your home, check out Green Building & 
Remodeling For Dummies by Eric Corey Freed (also published by Wiley).
 
✓ The way you use transportation: Part IV of this book focuses on tele-
commuting and teleconferencing because they provide great ways to 
reduce your travel and thus your carbon footprint.
 
✓ The way you feed yourself and your family: Okay, the primary way 
your computer can help you here is with research. We include several 
online resources for green information in Chapter 19 of this book. On 
Dummies.com, you can find great green living how-to’s. Also, check out 
Green Living For Dummies by Yvonne Jeffery, Liz Barclay, and Michael 
Grosvenor.
 
Are you a to-do lists and reminders kind of person? If so, set up a recurring 
appointment in your calendaring software on your computer, phone, or other 
electronic gadget. Getting a gentle reminder to “Drop off recycling today” or 
attend the “Farmer’s market, 10-12” can help with your commitment to a 
greener environment.
Offsetting your carbon habit
Finding out about the size of your family’s 
carbon footprint is a great place to start, and 
taking active steps toward reducing the way 
you contribute to greenhouse gas emissions is 
even better. Some folks take the effort a step 
further in an attempt to get to a point of carbon 
neutrality, by paying carbon offsets.
Carbon offsets offer you one way to lessen the 
impact of your carbon footprint — by support-
ing projects that reduce CO2 emissions in a vari-
ety of ways. Your carbon offset, for example, 
might support a program that plants trees, refits 
power plants for green energy, improves
energy efficiency in public transportation, or 
supports the development of new renewable 
energy sources.
Programs that encourage carbon offsetting do 
provide a reasonable response to a challeng-
ing problem, but they also take a lot of heat 
(metaphorically speaking). One concern is 
that people and businesses will throw money 
at the problem of greenhouse gas emissions 
instead of working actively to reduce their use 
of natural and energy resources. To find out 
more about carbon offsetting and gauge your 
own reaction, open your favorite Web search 
engine, type carbon offsets, and have at it!

H
ave you had a power outage lately? If you live in an area where storms 
roll through regularly, you may be accustomed to those surprising 
moments when everything goes black in the house — from power up to 
power down — in a split second. Lightning flashes give you enough power 
to find the candles, and then you sit and wait . . . and wait and sit . . . making 
plans for what you’ll do when the power comes back on and you can resume 
your life.
If this sounds familiar, you’re not alone. The average U.S. household con-
sumes 10,656 kilowatt-hours (kWh) per year, which is 1.22 kWh per hour (or 
.02 kWh per minute!). The refrigerator, the computer, and the DVD player 
use energy while you sleep. Your house operates around you, in many ways, 
thanks to the lifeline of power on demand 24 hours a day, seven days a week.
This chapter takes a deep dive into the power issue — what it is, where it 
comes from, and where it goes. You discover which appliances and gadgets 
in your house are using power right now and how you can better manage 
your power consumption — through your choices and actions — so that the 
power you consume is more in line with your hopes for the earth (and your 
utility budget!).

Checking Out Sources of Electricity
Chances are that you remember the stories of Benjamin Franklin and the key 
and Thomas Edison and the light bulb. But do you know what electricity is, 
where it comes from, and why knowing that is an important part of energy 
conservation?
The electricity that supports your lifestyle right this very minute is a manu-
factured product and not a natural renewable resource (one that we can con-
tinue to use and that replenishes itself naturally, such as wind). An electrical 
generator somewhere in your area uses a technology based on magnetics 
and copper wire to create the spark of life that keeps your technology going: 
the light shining on this page, the charge in your cellphone, the current keep-
ing your laptop charged, and the electricity running the ceiling fan.
When you flip the switch or plug in the cord, you open the gate for the electric-
ity to flow to the device, appliance, or computer hardware. For the end user, it’s 
pretty simple. But when you take a look at where energy for electricity comes 
from (which we do in the following sections), you may find you have a lot more 
to consider than simply paying your electric bill on time. You also find tips to 
help you consider whether solar energy for your home could be worthwhile.
Creating electricity
Electricity is a secondary power source — meaning that other primary energy 
sources are used to generate it. In the United States, electricity generated in 
2008 came from multiple sources:
 
✓ 48.4 percent came from coal
 
✓ 21.4 percent from natural gas
 
✓ 19.4 percent from nuclear energy
 
✓ 1.5 percent from oil
 
✓ 9.3 percent from other sources, including wind, geothermal, and solar
 
Want the numbers? At www.eia.doe.gov/cneaf/electricity/epm/
table1_2.html, you’ll find a table published by the Energy Information 
Administration, the statistical agency of the U.S. Department of Energy, show-
ing the sources used to generate electricity, state by state.

33
 Chapter 3: The Straight Scoop on Power
We can generate electricity from many different sources, but all those 
sources, except solar technologies (which use photovoltaic cells to store 
energy), use a process in which a turbine spins and converts movement 
energy into electric energy. Steam, gas, and diesel turbine generators all use 
this process, as do nuclear power plants and alternate energy systems. When 
power plants create electricity by burning fossil fuels such as coal, oil, and 
natural gas, they boil water to produce high-pressure steam, which turns the 
turbines in the generator that creates the electricity. Nuclear reactors (which 
use nuclear fission to split atoms, releasing a great amount of energy) and 
hydroelectric power plants (which use moving water to generate electricity) 
use similar turbine-based procedures without burning fossil fuels.
When you look at how green these methods of generating electricity are, the 
differences among these energy sources become apparent:
 
✓ Renewable versus nonrenewable energy: Today, you see the terms 
renewable and nonrenewable energy everywhere. The difference between 
the two (not surprisingly) is that one type of energy continually replen-
ishes naturally (like wind and water) and the other doesn’t — when it’s 
gone, it’s gone (for example, oil, natural gas, and coal). Figure 3-1 shows 
you all the different types of mining operations that are going on to, 
among other things, keep Windows gleaming on your monitor.
 
 Scientists tell us that available oil and natural gas supplies are limited 
and dwindling, although coal promises a longer supply, with experts 
estimating that the earth’s coal supply will last well into the next cen-
tury. You find large amounts of coal in the United States, Europe, Russia, 
China, and South Africa — anyplace that was covered with swampland a 
couple hundred million years ago. But just because today coal is handy 
and readily available — and cheap — still doesn’t mean it will always be 
around. It’s still a nonrenewable resource. Also, mining coal is difficult 
and dangerous, as headlines often attest.
AC/DC: More than a band
Have you ever been curious about the differ-
ence between AC and DC power? It’s not as 
complicated as it sounds. AC stands for alter-
nating current and refers to the wave created 
as the current oscillates between –170 and 170 
volts. AC is the type of power you draw from 
the wall outlet when you plug an appliance 
or a computer into the socket. DC, the type of 
power used in batteries, stands for direct cur-
rent, which is the power that flows, for example, 
from the negative to the positive terminal on a 
battery.

✓ By-products of different energy sources: Most of the technologies that 
we use to generate electricity pump CO2 into the atmosphere, including 
any technology that burns fossil fuels. (Chapter 2 covers the problems 
with greenhouse gases such as CO2.)
 
 The largest energy source in the United States — coal — has incredibly 
high costs: CO2 production, carbon monoxide, and soot (which is really 
just unburned carbon that’s released into the air we breathe). Remember 
acid rain? Thank coal. Smog in your city in the summer? Another coal con-
tribution. And coal isn’t smart consumption, either; yet another downside 
is that it takes an enormous amount of coal to create the same amount of 
energy using other technologies, which means that it carries a heftier CO2 
price tag than other fossil fuel–burning energy sources. Although you may 
have heard talk of clean coal (see the nearby sidebar), the viability of this 
option is debatable. Not a pretty picture (nor a good, long-term option) if 
what you want is a sustainable, green, healthy world.
 
The challenge you face in greening your computing practices is that creating 
and using electricity does impact the environment, not only by using up non-
renewable fuel sources but also by releasing harmful by-products. The good 
news is that renewable energy sources can be replenished and have less haz-
ardous by-products. The bad news is that renewable energy isn’t widely avail-
able as a primary energy source — although in some places solar panels may 
be a worthwhile expense. In the next sections, you find steps that walk you 
through various incentives and tools to help you assess whether solar is an 
option for you. If reducing your energy use is the best way to make a big differ-
ence, be sure to read the tips throughout the rest of this chapter for monitor-
ing and reducing your energy use and find out how your home computer and 
Internet connection can help you in these efforts.

 Chapter 3: The Straight Scoop on Power
Thinking about renewable energy
As the green movement began to blossom in the U.S., the phrase renewable 
energy became popular. Today, we have options for the ways in which we 
generate electricity, many of which are considered renewable methods. But 
development is fairly slow, and the technologies still aren’t widely adopted. 
Burning fossil fuel is still considered the easiest and cheapest way to power 
our homes and PCs, if you think in terms of short-term cost and not long-term 
environmental damage. But in 2008, 9.3 percent of the electricity used in the 
U.S. was generated with renewable energy technologies (hydroelectric, wind, 
solar, geothermal, and biomass). That’s an encouraging sign, but we’re just 
getting started exploring the long-term ramifications of the various renew-
able technologies. Be sure to research the different options available in your 
area, ask questions of your utility service providers, and think about the big-
picture impact of the energy source you choose.
Today, the earth does ask us to consider the long-term effects of our choices, 
and renewable energy sources come from clean, nonpolluting sources that 
never run out. What’s more, renewable energy is safe and can be produced 
domestically. Sounds good, right?
Table 3-1 introduces you to the various types of renewable energy now in 
development. The sections that follow describe a little more about each tech-
nology and the possibilities each offers for eventually powering our homes, 
PCs, and mobile devices.
Table 3-1 
Types of Renewable Energy
Type
Description
Biomass
Organic matter, such as plant and animal waste, is burned or 
changed into gases to produce electricity.
Fuel cell
Chemical reactions combine hydrogen and oxygen to create 
electricity.
Geothermal
Pipes bring to the earth’s surface dry steam or hot water, which 
powers a turbine that drives a generator to produce electricity.
Hydroelectric
Water flowing through dams turns turbines and generates 
electricity.
Solar
Photovoltaic cells gather sunlight and generate electricity.
Wind
Wind power turns two- or three-blade propellers mounted on 
rotors, which turn wind turbines that generate electricity.

In Chapter 2, we tell you about carbon offsets, which are programs that let you 
contribute financially to green energy programs and pay down the cost of 
your CO2 impact on the environment. Supporting carbon offsets funds the 
development and deployment of these green technologies.
Ready, set, sun!
Solar electricity has been around for a long time, but it’s been slow to catch 
on, particularly because it’s incredibly expensive. (And also because solar 
panels used to be incredibly ugly. Did you see those solar homes in the 
1970s?)
Solar energy is harnessed mainly through photovoltaic (PV) cells, which 
collect and control the energy, converting it through the use of a charge con-
verter and distributing sunlight-generated electricity (both AC current pro-
duced by an inverter and battery DC power) to electrical appliances, lights, 
and more. (See Figure 3-2.) In recent years, solar batteries have become pop-
ular for use in landscape lighting — no wires needed, no fossil fuels burned, 
and they’re not too bad looking! But what happens when you have four or 
five rainy days in a row? Yeah, your landscape is pretty dim at night.
On the upside, solar energy is a clean technology and contributes no green-
house gases to the atmosphere. The solar cells have no moving parts (think 
of yourself stretched out on a blanket by the ocean) and require little mainte-
nance and upkeep.
A reality check on clean coal
The term clean coal might seem like an oxymo-
ron, and some experts and advocacy groups 
agree that the terms definitely contradict. Check 
out the public service announcements that 
ThisIsReality.org, a site maintained by the Reality 
Coalition, posts at http://action.this
isreality.org/index/?source=
reality&subsource=action. Then 
follow it up with more information on what is 
required, long and short term, to get coal to 
clean up its act. The Reality Coalition is a col-
laborative project launched by the Alliance for 
Climate Protection, the Sierra Club, the National 
Wildlife Federation, the Natural Resources 
Defense Council, and the League of Conservation 
Voters. The following link gives you a good place 
to start if you want to find out more: http://

One of the challenges of solar power is that it’s still fairly expensive to pro-
duce. Although concern over burning fossil fuels is making solar energy 
power plants more appealing as a long-term sustainable energy source, 
estimated costs per kilowatt-hour are still higher than most consumers are 
prepared to pay.
Another type of solar energy, called active solar heating, involves heating 
and storing water or air in a collector and then transferring the stored heat 
directly into the space or storage system. Commercial systems are available 
in some areas and may help offset your other utility costs. It’s worth a search 
on the Web, anyway.
 
If you’re a PC owner, you can create your own solar-powered computer, if 
your pockets are deep enough (do you have an extra $5,000 sitting around?), 
and you have the technical expertise to pull it off. To find out more, check out 
the DIY Solar-Powered PC article at www.tomshardware.com/reviews/

Winds of change
Wind power is another contestant in Renewable Energy of the Stars. Like solar 
power, this technology is a familiar one that’s taking on new purpose and life. 
Farmers have long used windmills to generate power on farms all across 
the globe, enabling them to pump water, grind grain, and accomplish other 

38
Part I: Getting a Little Green Behind the Ears 
power-dependent tasks by harnessing a readily available natural resource. 
Today’s wind turbines are mounted on tall towers 100 feet (30 meters) or more 
above ground so that they can catch the less turbulent, faster wind. The air 
currents move the propeller-like blades (usually two or three), which turn on 
a rotor.
Debunking wind myths
Although wind power is an affordable type 
of renewable energy that offers big benefits 
(no greenhouse gas emissions, few parts that 
require maintenance, and no fossil fuel burning), 
some people have concerns about wind power:
 ✓ Wind turbines ruin the landscape. What? 
You’re not happy about seeing fields of 
green turn into fields of propellers? It’s not 
as bad as all that. Wind farms — those slick 
fields of rotating-blade giants you’ve seen 
in green energy ads — are more the excep-
tion than the rule, but that may be changing. 
Yes, you’ll likely see more wind farms in the 
future, both onshore and offshore, power-
ing homes and businesses and schools. 
Wind turbines are available for personal 
use, but the turbines are small, with some 
mounting on a tower or a roof.
 ✓ Wind turbines are dangerous for birds. As 
earth-friendly authors, we care about the 
safety of all living creatures on the planet, 
but it does seem that birds are accustomed 
to flying around things: buildings, flag poles, 
fire towers, antennae. Although the swirling 
blades on wind turbines may look like, say, 
airplane engines (props to Captain Sully!), 
monitoring of wind farms in bird-happy 
areas has shown no negative effect on bird 
populations so far. If something comes up, 
though, we’ll let you know.
 ✓ Wind turbines are noisy. Like anything else 
in the cycle of product development, early 
prototypes are often less elegant than final 
release versions. (Did you see Windows 
Vista?) Thankfully, we’re a species that 
lives and learns, though, because today’s 
modern wind turbines are much quieter 
(think swoosh instead of urn-urn-urn). If 
the turbine is seated properly (meaning that 
nothing’s out of whack and it can turn unob-
structed), it shouldn’t make enough sound to 
disturb even the lightest sleeper. In fact, any 
sound is probably lost on the wind itself.
 ✓ Wind power isn’t reliable. This is a common 
concern. So what happens when there’s no 
wind? In some portions of the U.S., it’s not 
unusual during the hottest period of the 
year to have a time that feels like a wind 
drought. If wind power is tied to wind and 
the wind doesn’t blow, what happens? Do 
all our lights go out? One of the things we’re 
learning right now with current conditions 
in energy consumption is that relying too 
heavily on any one resource — such as 
foreign oil or burning coal — creates an 
imbalance somewhere else. So although 
changes in the amount of wind are, yes, 
beyond our control and do vary, the 
chances that wind power will be the only 
resource supplying electricity generation 
is nil. A balanced, working energy system 
will use natural resources wisely and in 
complement, drawing what we need when 
we need it without pumping bad stuff into 
the atmosphere or creating a dependency 
we don’t need. Plus, when wind power is 
widely used, wind turbines will be part of 
a larger grid — and the wind never stops 
blowing everywhere at once! (If it does, you 
know the world has stopped turning.)

39
 Chapter 3: The Straight Scoop on Power
 
One full-sized wind turbine generates more than 4.7 million watts of electricity 
each year. That’s enough to run a PC for 1,620 years!
 
Wind-powered technology in the classroom is already a reality. One interest-
ing project is the WindPC project in the United Kingdom. WindPC awards wind 
turbines and all that’s needed to build, track, and report on the energy savings 
to schools that apply to the foundation and write about their green efforts. 
It’s a great way to help kids participate in earth-friendly energy initiatives.

Water your world
If you’ve ever held your hand under water as it runs out of the tap, you already 
know the basics of hydro power. Moving water generates force, and of course, 
the more water, the greater the force. Hydroelectricity technology harnesses 
the power of moving water (not necessarily falling water, by the way, although 
that really gets it moving!) and converts the energy into electricity.
Case in point: Niagara Falls. Although people have been going over the Falls 
in barrels since seemingly the dawn of crazy human tricks, Niagara Falls is a 
nothing-short-of-miraculous energy source for the state of New York. In fact, 
the Falls are New York State’s biggest electricity provider, supporting homes, 
businesses, and government offices with more than 2.4 million kilowatts of 
electricity in a year. That in turn saves millions of dollars for everyone in that 
area of the country and keeps tons of CO2 out of the atmosphere, which helps 
us all. See how great that works?
Hydro power works with the turbine system that we tell you about earlier in 
this chapter — the water moves the enormous turbines, which spin and feed 
the electrical generators, which pump out the electricity for you and me.
 
Okay, okay. Anyone who has ever spilled a glass of water on a keyboard knows 
that water and electronics don’t mix. But they do have a common cousin — 
electricity. If you can convert water to electricity, you can use it to power your 
PC. Some people are already doing it. If you have running water near your 
home in the form of a lake or small stream, you may be able to install a home 
water power system (which may include a submersible propeller unit or a 
small water generator) and provide your whole home with power. Do a Web 
search for home hydro power and see what comes up!

Fitting solar panels on your roof
One of the criticisms — no, two — of solar energy is that it’s expensive and 
ugly. Back in the days when people wore platform shoes and fringe jackets 
(oh, those were the days), people who really cared about the earth put solar 
panels on top of their houses. Although the panels in the ’70s were oversized 
and unwieldy (well, what wasn’t back then?), today’s solar panels are sleek 
and much more affordable. Plus, depending on how progressive your utility 
company is, they may have an even better perk: payback.
 
Some utility companies today let you use your solar panels to generate elec-
tricity and sell it back to the company, which lowers your monthly bill. This 
process is often called net metering. The solar energy system you add needs to 
be in compliance with your utilities regulations to qualify. Visit the Database 
of State Incentives for Renewables & Efficiency (www.dsireusa.org), shown 
in Figure 3-3, to find out whether your state has a policy about net metering.
 
Figure 3-3:

Here’s a neat gadget you can try to see whether your home would be a good 
candidate for solar energy. Roofray.com uses Google Maps to locate your 
house and help you determine the right solar panel layout for your home. It’s 
fun! Here’s how to do it:

41
 Chapter 3: The Straight Scoop on Power
 
1. Go to www.roofray.com.
 
2. In the Address field, type your house number, street, city, state, and 
zip code. Click Go.
 
 The search process may take a minute or two because it uses Google 
Maps to locate your exact house. (See Figure 3-4.) Eerie, huh?
 
Figure 3-4: 
Roofray.com 
uses Google 
Maps.
 
 
3. Click one corner of the roof segment where you’re thinking of putting 
solar panels.
 
 A little marker appears at the spot you clicked.
 
4. Continue clicking the roof corners.
 
 A shaded section highlights the area that you select.
 
5. Tell RoofRay.com the orientation (or slope) of your roof by dragging 
the handle of the red line toward the bottom of the roof.
 
6. Use the slider to indicate the pitch (or angle) of the roof.
 
 If you’re unsure of your roof’s pitch, leave the slider set to 20, which is 
the average setting.
 
7. Click Next.
 
 For the next step, you need your utility bills. (You can estimate if you 
like, but taking the time to be accurate helps you better gauge your 
potential savings.)

42

8. Enter your monthly electric bills (or estimate, if you’d like). Click 
Use This.
 
 Calculations at the bottom of the window show you the percentage of 
savings, the power per square foot, the area of the panel section, the 
orientation of your roof, and the total power that you can collect at peak 
times.
 
9. Click Next
 
 The gadget calculates your savings and displays the estimated costs of 
your electric bills for the various months of the year. (See Figure 3-5.)
 
Figure 3-5: 
Roofray.com 
shows you 
an estimate 
of your

10. Click Next one final time.
 
 The last step gives you the option of letting RoofRay.com know you’d 
like a free estimate. Whether you decide to go ahead with solar panels, 
you’ve got to admit that this is one slick online tool.
How Much Energy Are 
You Using, Anyway?
If you’re like many people, learning the size of your carbon footprint can be a 
bit of a shock. (Find the steps for sizing up your own footprint in Chapter 2.) 
Literally everything we do consumes energy and outputs some kind of waste. 
Sitting there right now, your eyes are focusing and you’re breathing and 

43
 Chapter 3: The Straight Scoop on Power
burning calories. (We won’t go into discussing your output at this point, but 
we hope you’re converting this idea energy into things you can do around 
your house to cut down on your energy use.)
The carbon footprint is different from an overall estimation of your energy 
consumption, however, because the calculations are designed to figure how 
much of an impact you’re making on the environment in terms of greenhouse 
gas emissions. (So that’s more about output; get it?)
Thinking through what you consume, and looking for ways to reduce what 
you can and manage the rest, is the focus of this section. You start by taking 
a look at the data you already have, consider the ways in which your existing 
applications (computers included) use energy, and then find out about sev-
eral ways to use smart meters, your computer, and even your cellphone to 
monitor and manage your power use.
Tracking your bills in a spreadsheet
You can use some of the information from monthly bills and receipts to 
determine the amount of energy you use on a monthly, weekly, daily, even 
hourly basis. Follow these steps to set up a system for tracking your usage 
and monitoring your progress:
 
1. Gather a few month’s worth of the following:
 
• Electric bills
 
• Natural gas bills
 
• Water bills
 
• Gasoline receipts
 
• Pizza coupons (No, wait; that’s a different book.)
 
2. In a spreadsheet program, such as Excel, set up a grid like the one 
shown in Figure 3-6, with rows for each utility you want to track and 
columns for each month.
 
 We like to chart our use in months because it’s less pressure than hour-
by-hour, and it gives you a sense of how things change over a longer 
period of time.
 
 Typically, residential electricity is billed in kilowatt hours (kWh). That’s 
the number you want to track. If you have trouble finding the number of 
kilowatt hours on your electric bill, go to your electric company’s Web 
site, where you can probably find a tip sheet to help you read your bill.

44
Part I: Getting a Little Green Behind the Ears 
 
Figure 3-6: 
Every little 
bit helps, 
and track-
ing what 
you use is 
a good first 
step toward 
cutting 
back.
 
 
3. To get a better look at where you’re at and where you’d like to be, set 
up one table on the same spreadsheet that displays last year’s energy 
use and another table that displays your goals.
 
 As you can see in Figure 3-6, you can use this same table to track your 
water and gas usage. Your water utility may charge by the gallon, cubic 
foot, or some other unit. Natural gas is often billed in therms.
 
4. Compare the three tables each month.
 
Want to make the most of your competitive nature? Set a goal for yourself by 
creating a chart of your real and projected usage. Draw a line (make it a big 
green line) to mark your consumption goal and try to stay under it. When you 
achieve the goal one month, celebrate! Go out and hug a tree. (If you’ve never 
tried it, you might be surprised to discover how much fun it actually is.)
The worksheet in Figure 3-6 doesn’t include gasoline consumption, but tracking 
the number of gallons of gas you use in a week — or in a month — is a good way 
to remind yourself to consider the real costs and long-range effects of burning 
fossil fuel. The amount of gas you buy is typically listed on your receipt.
Calculating costs and savings 
with a home energy audit
As you find out in this chapter, the secret of making good choices about the 
power you consume begins with identifying which items in your home use 
power, how much power they use, and how you can monitor and manage the 
energy consumption of those items.

45
 Chapter 3: The Straight Scoop on Power
Another way to get a detailed look at your power consumption options 
involves getting a home energy audit. Certified professionals in your state are 
glad to do this for a fee. See the Residential Energy Services Network at www.
natresnet.org/directory/raters.aspx to find auditors in your state, 
or you can use a free online tool, such as Home Energy Saver, which is avail-
able at http://hes.lbl.gov. (See Figure 3-7.)
 
Figure 3-7:

enables 
you to do a 
home audit

To do a home energy audit, follow these steps:
 
1. Go to the Home Energy Saver site at http://hes.lbl.gov.
 
2. Type your zip code in the box provided and click Go.
 
3. Enter information to help fine-tune the cost calculation for energy use 
in your home.
 
 The calculations are based at first on averages for your area, but you 
can customize the detail about your home so that the calculations 
reflect your situation more accurately. You can continue to make 
changes even after you click Calculate.
 
4. Click Calculate to see the results.
 
 The results of the calculation show you the energy costs that you’ll run 
up during a year in your particular area with a house that has the fea-
tures you selected. The Web site compares these results to estimated 
costs after you make energy-efficient upgrades to the property.

46
Part I: Getting a Little Green Behind the Ears 
 
5. Click View Upgrade Report.
 
 The tool displays a list of all energy upgrades that you can consider based 
on the types of features you selected for your home (see Figure 3-8). The 
report shows you not only the amount of money you’ll save but also your 
return on investment, how long the upgrades will take to pay for them-
selves, and the amount of CO2 you’ll save the environment.

Monitoring usage with ploggs and 
smart meters
Becoming aware of something is the first step toward changing it, but with-
out awareness, how do you know what you don’t know? That’s where power 
plugs and meters come in. A number of manufacturers (and some really big 
companies) are realizing that most people aren’t laughing gleefully as they 
mindlessly gobble energy that they could share with the rest of the world. 
They simply don’t realize the cost of their normal day-to-day operations.
So in an effort to empower consumers to make their own responsible energy 
choices, smart meters and ploggs were born. These smart devices plug into 
your electrical outlet and enable you to see easily how much power various 
devices in your home are drawing. This section introduces you to a few popu-
lar meters available today.

47
 Chapter 3: The Straight Scoop on Power
Kill A Watt power meter
With the Kill A Watt power meter from P3 International, you can check your 
appliances to find out how much electricity they use. Plug Kill A Watt into an 
outlet and plug the appliance into the device; the meter tracks the electricity 
consumption and displays the result in kilowatt-hours (kWh). Kill A Watt is a 
low-cost option, available for as little as $40 in some online stores.
The Energy Detective
The Energy Detective (TED) from Energy, Inc. is a power meter that uses a 
transmitter and an LCD to track your energy use in real time and report it on 
the digital device. This product does require installation and involves elec-
tricity, so consider hiring an electrician to install the transmitter.
Energy, Inc. also offers TED Footprints, which is PC software that works with 
TED as you monitor your power use. It produces various reports and graphs, 
and you can even export the data to CSV (comma-separated values) format 
so that you can use it in other applications. The TED unit, including the trans-
mitter and display, is available on the meter’s Web site (www.theenergy
detective.com) for $144.95; the TED Footprints software is $44.95.
Plogging along
A plogg is a combination power meter and data logger that measures the elec-
tricity you’re using and sends the data wirelessly anywhere in the world to a 
mobile PC, laptop, or desktop computer.
Plogg is actually a small computer in its own right, with an 8051-compatible 
microprocessor, RAM, flash memory, a real-time clock, and Plogg Manager 
software that tracks instant and cumulative energy consumption.
Considering the cost
This book tells you about wattage quite a bit, 
and you may wonder what wattage is actually 
all about. A watt is an instantaneous value. All 
this value tells you is the amount of power that 
a device uses at any given moment. However, 
power companies can’t charge for power unless 
they quantify it. When you turn on a 100 watt 
device and leave it one for 1 hour, you’ve used 100 
watt/hours. Power companies charge by the kilo-
watt/hour (a kilowatt is 1,000 watts). Let’s say your 
power company charges $0.35 per kilowatt/hour. 
Turning on a 100 watt device for 1 hour costs you 
100/1000 * 0.35 or $0.035. Three and a half cents 
doesn’t sound like much, but it does add up.

48
Part I: Getting a Little Green Behind the Ears 
PloggZgb acts as a ZigBee end device, router, or coordinator and is available 
on the Plogg site (www.plogginternational.com) for $80. The PloggBlu 
version offers Bluetooth connectivity and is available for $95.
 
The ZigBee alliance is an association of companies working together to incor-
porate wireless technology in remote monitoring and power-control applica-
tions. Partnering utilities and third-party applications can use ZigBee 
technology to send energy use reports via wireless communications to end-
user devices like the PloggZgb.
Connecting power education to action
Power meters help give you the information you need to make educated 
choices about your power consumption. Various companies are working 
to solve different parts of the puzzle and enable you to take what you learn 
about your power usage to the next level — by managing your consump-
tion effectively, in real-time. Following are some pieces that have yet to be 
resolved before that capability will be available in all its glory.
Utility companies don’t give consumers a lot of information to work with. 
Whether this is by design, when you look at your electric bill, you see a few 
numbers. A typical electric bill includes your meter reading from last month, 
your meter reading this month, the difference in kWh from one month to 
the next, and how much that’s gonna cost you. Companies jumping into the 
energy empowerment arena want to see consumers who can monitor, track, 
and adjust their power consumption in real time.
In early 2009, the Google Foundation announced a new green initiative 
designed to empower consumers by giving them real-time access to their 
power-use data, but instead of building a device like Plogg or TED, Google is 
creating an iGoogle gadget, Google PowerMeter, to do the tracking. Imagine 
being able to log in to your Google account and check the energy consump-
tion going on at home while you’re at the office. Now take it a step further 
and imagine that you can click the mouse and turn off the lights you left on in 
the morning! This technology isn’t so far away!
Google is testing the PowerMeter now in Northern California, in conjunction 
with Pacific Gas and Electric Company. Google plans to work with utility 
companies nationwide and make it easy for consumers to access their own 
power use information. For those consumers who can’t get real-time access 
from their utility companies, Google plans to work with third-party designers 
who will create display devices that will do the trick. To find out more about 
Google PowerMeter, check out www.google.org/powermeter.

Checking for Efficiency 
with the Energy Star
If you’ve purchased anything that draws electric current within the last 10 
years or so, chances are that you’ve seen the Energy Star label on the box. 
Figure 3-9 shows you what that label looks like today.
 
Figure 3-9: 
Life feels 
better with 
an Energy 
Star.
 
The Energy Star program started in 1992 as a collaborative venture between the 
U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and the U.S. Department of Energy. The 
purpose of the Energy Star is to create a standard for energy consumption and 
let consumers know which appliances and devices meet this standard. (The 
Energy Star can let you know that the refrigerator that you’re thinking of buying 
isn’t going to cost a year’s college tuition to run and won’t reduce a glacier to 
mush anytime soon.)
Here are a few stats from the Energy Star site that are sure to wow you:
 
✓ More than 2.5 million Energy Star products have sold since the program 
began.
 
✓ 2007 numbers show that the Energy Star helped save U.S. consumers 
more than $16 billion in energy costs.
The Energy Star site at www.energystar.gov offers a whole world full of 
information for consumers, businesses, manufacturing plants, parents, kids, 
and your favorite pets. (Okay, maybe not your pets.) You can listen to energy 
podcasts, find out about tax credits for energy savings, find out how to fix 
common household problems, and much more. Figure 3-10 shows the site; be 
careful, you can follow a single link in there and not come out until dinnertime.

Energy Star’s Web site can help you identify energy-efficient products. Say, for 
example, that you’re thinking about purchasing a new dehumidifier for your 
house. How can you find out which model is best? Which ones last longest, 
make the smallest amount of noise, and produce the healthiest environments? 
You might call your favorite aunt to ask her advice, or you could consult the 
Energy Star site (and, of course, look for the star on the box of the dehumidi-
fier you eventually buy). Energy Star gives you the basics on products and 
offers user reviews and ratings, but best of all, it tells you how much energy 
each appliance consumes while it’s doing its thing every day.
 
In Chapter 6, we tell you all about finding, purchasing, and setting up a new 
green computer, so we thought we’d choose an example here that your favor-
ite aunt is more likely to be an expert on.
To use Energy Star to do your due diligence before you buy, follow these 
steps:
 
1. Go to the Energy Star site at www.energystar.gov.
 
2. Click the Explore Products link near the top-left side of the page.
 
 The Energy Star Qualified Products page provides a series of links with

EnergyGuide — What’s the difference?
When they first begin to shop for new appli-
ances and equipment, some people confuse 
the EnergyGuide (the big yellow sticker shown 
in the figure) with Energy Star. These are two 
different programs, designed with different pur-
poses. The EnergyGuide sticker is a little like 
the ingredients label on the cookies you buy. 
The manufacturer is required by the U.S. Food 
and Drug Administration (FDA) to tell you what’s 
in those cookies, along with how many calories 
and what percentage of daily cookie calories 
they represent. The EnergyGuide gives basic 
information about the item you’re looking at 
(manufacturer name, model number, capacity, 
and so on) and lets you know how the energy 
efficiency of this particular item compares with 
other appliances in the same general category. 
The U.S. Department of Energy sets the stan-
dards and regulates how manufacturers display 
this information on the EnergyGuide.
EnergyGuide displays efficiency measurements 
differently for different devices. Fridges and dish-
washers show an annual energy consumption 
(for example, kWh per year). The EnergyGuide 
also shows you an estimate of what it will cost 
you to run the appliance for a year, based on a 
national average of energy prices.

53
 Chapter 3: The Straight Scoop on Power
 
Here’s a little more detail on energy factors: Because different devices use 
energy differently, the way in which energy is used needs to be taken into 
account. The energy efficiency of a dehumidifier is measured in the amount of 
water removed from the air per kilowatt-hour (kWh).
Penning Up Energy Hogs in Your House
Conserving energy is often one of the easier and cheaper things you can 
do to lower your energy use. This section takes you on a quick tour of your 
home to help you pinpoint ways you can conserve energy throughout.
 
In Part II, you learn more about the ways in which the individual parts of your 
computer — and the other devices that are its friends — conspire to jack up 
your electric bill.
This section merely scratches the surface of greening your home. For a 
more in-depth look at creating a green home, check out Green Building & 
Remodeling For Dummies, by Eric Corey Freed (Wiley).
Controlling power flow to electronics: 
Managing your media
Do you have the TV on all day when you’re home? Is the clock still flashing 
12:00 on your DVD player? Is your cellphone plugged in (even though it’s 
charged), your printer light gleaming, your monitor feigning sleep with an 
empty, blank face?
All these items draw current, whether they’re turned off or on. Different 
devices draw various amounts of current. (Visualize hoses of different 
widths draining water out of a pool; the wider the hose, the more water goes 
through.) The following paragraphs tell you how power consumption can 
vary, just among the types of items you already have around your house (or 
may be considering purchasing):
 
✓ Televisions: An average LCD TV uses 213 watts of power when it is turned 
on. By comparison, a plasma uses 339 watts, and a rear-projection TV 
uses 211 watts.
 
✓ Gaming consoles: Adding an Xbox 360 heaps on another 187 watts. 
Playstation 3? Even worse — that’s an additional 197 watts, please.
 
✓ Computers: Oh, and how many computers do you have in the house? 
Three? That’s another 234 watts (78 watts per PC).

54
Part I: Getting a Little Green Behind the Ears 
With two LCD TVs, an Xbox 360, and three PCs, you’re pulling almost 900 
watts without even trying. With the average cost of electricity (based on 2007 
figures) at $10.06 per kWh, those numbers can add up pretty quickly. And 
that’s only the cost you see in your checkbook. It doesn’t count the CO2 emis-
sions produced to make the energy that those devices mindlessly drink.
If you’re in the market for a new television, check out CNET’s energy-use 
comparisons of high-definition TV makes and models. The study gathered 
energy use on dozens of TV models and compared them based on a watts-
per-screen-inch ratio. You can see at a glance which models are guzzlers and 
which aren’t. Here’s the link: http://tiny.cc/IB4bM.
Squealing over heat and 
air conditioning costs
Ah, here’s a nice word: saving. Saving your hard-earned dollars. Saving green-
house gas emissions. Saving the planet.
It’s possible that, depending on where you live in the country, half of your 
energy consumption comes from heating and cooling your home. The aver-
age heating and cooling expense for a mid-sized house in the U.S. is close to 
$1,000 a year. That’s a lot of pizza. A huge list of things contributes to this 
use factor, of course, including the following:
 
✓ Whether you live in a warm, cool, or moderate area
 
✓ The size of your home
 
✓ Location and landscaping (big trees keep houses cooler)
A new Energy Star shines for TV standards
The new Energy Star 3.0 TV specification was 
unveiled in February 2009, offering consumers 
new standards to raise the bar for the way TVs 
consume power. TVs that have the new Energy 
Star rating are as much as 30 percent more 
energy efficient than other televisions. The 
criteria are based on power use in both active 
and standby states, the way in which power is 
used for brightness, and the power consump-
tion for various screen sizes. Energy Star also 
asks manufacturers to provide consumers 
with information on how to adjust a television’s 
settings to get the most use from the smallest 
amount of energy.

55
 Chapter 3: The Straight Scoop on Power
 
✓ Your home’s age and construction
 
✓ The number of doors and windows you have (and how tightly they’re 
sealed)
This list could go on and on, but you get the picture.
Whether you have a new, sparkling, energy-efficient heating and cooling 
system, you can perform some simple, low-cost tasks to make a big difference 
in the amount of power you use to keep your home comfortable. The sections 
that follow give you more details.
Two words: Programmable thermostat
Programming a thermostat isn’t nearly as geeky as it sounds. You need to have 
someone who understands electric current install it for you (hopefully your 
HVAC contractor), but then it’s all yours for the programming. Chances are, 
your heating-and-cooling contractor will help you get started with this as well.
A programmable thermostat enables you to set temperatures for different 
times of the day, which regulates the amount of energy you use to maintain 
the temperature. For example, if you go to work every day, and you’re gone 
from 7:30 a.m. to 5:30 p.m., you can set the thermostat to automatically drop 
the temperature when you leave in the morning and raise it to your favorite 
degree when you return at night. And yes, programmable thermostats are 
smart, so you can set different schedules for weekdays and weekends.
Programmable thermostats that have the Energy Star come preprogrammed 
with the temperature settings shown in Table 3-2. Even if you think these look 
a little cool (or warm) to you, try them out for a day or two to see whether 
your internal thermostat adjusts.

Part I: Getting a Little Green Behind the Ears 
Some thermostats go all out — the electric cars of the heating and cooling 
world — and include bells and whistles such as warning lights that display 
when it’s time to change the filter, voice activation features (so you can say, 
“Honey, I’m home!” and change the house temperature), and a variety of set-
tings for customizing your schedule.
 
No programmable thermostat? No worries. Just adjust the thermostat a few 
degrees before you leave the house and when you come back and put on a 
sweater (or take one off, depending on the season). Many people are surprised 
by the savings they discover when they change their thermostat setting by 
just three or four degrees.
The 411 on filters
Ah, can’t you just hear you father’s voice? How often do you change those fur-
nace filters? Back in the day, furnace filters were big, clunky things designed 
to protect your furnace equipment. Today, they still keep the detritus in your 
air out of the inner cogs of the furnace, but they may also strip out evil aller-
gens, improve air quality, and help — or hinder — air flow.
Changing a furnace filter is a simple task, and it can make a big difference 
in the way your furnace, air conditioning, or heat pump circulate the air in 
your house. If the filter is clogged and messy, the fan has to work consider-
ably harder to try to pull air through it. For a happy fan, cleaner air flow, 
and lower electric use, replace your furnace filter (or clean it, if you have 
the reusable kind) more often than the standard manufacturer requirements 
say. (If the package says “Lasts up to three months,” change the filter early in 
month two, for example.)
 
If changing the furnace filter is something you forget — like changing the oil in 
your car or letting the cat in — put yourself on a regular schedule. Pay the 
mortgage, change the filter. It’s that simple. (It worked for us, anyway.)
What kind of culprit is your air conditioner?
Many people don’t know how air conditioners work (do they just pump cool air 
into your house?) or how to improve their efficiency. Your air conditioner is cir-
culating cooler air throughout your home, but the air that it circulates is actually 
the same warmer air that you were sweating in before the AC kicked on.
The first air conditioner was a fan placed over an ice block (designed to cool 
sick patients in southern Florida). As the invention evolved, it used toxic 
or flammable gases to do its temperature-altering work. Soon, someone 
invented a gas called Freon, which was safer for humans, but unfortunately, it 
punched a hole in the ozone layer. Today, air conditioners (both the one you 
use for your house and the one in your car) use a slightly less-effective ver-
sion of Freon, but at least it’s not hurting the planet.

57
 Chapter 3: The Straight Scoop on Power
You can do several things right away to reduce the amount of energy your air 
conditioner uses:
 
✓ Turn it off. Consider other types of cooling efforts first. And then, if the 
heat is really unbearable, go ahead and use your air conditioner.
 
✓ Raise the thermostat. You may think you need the temperature set to 72 
degrees when it’s 95 degrees outside, but will a couple of degrees really 
matter that much? Won’t 78 degrees still feel cooler than 95 degrees? It 
could reduce your electric consumption by as much as 3 to 5 percent.
 
✓ Close the curtains. Sure, it’s beautiful to see the sun streaming in your 
windows on a gorgeous summer day. But if it raises the house’s tempera-
ture 6 degrees, maybe opening the curtains in the evening is a better idea.
 
✓ Use ceiling fans. A ceiling fan uses a supply of electricity, but it’s a 
smaller amount than an AC unit. Plus, a ceiling fan can reduce the tem-
perature in a room by 5 to 8 degrees.
 
✓ Seal the ducts and sills. You’re paying for every bit of the cool air your 
AC generates, so make sure you get the benefit of it all. Make sure your 
windows are caulked. (You may want to get newer energy-efficient win-
dows if yours are outdated, but that’s a bit of an expense.) Also, have 
the ductwork cleaned and patched, if necessary.
 
✓ Double-check your insulation. Insulation helps you maintain the tem-
perature you want in your home no matter what the season, so check it. 
And add insulation in the attic, garage, and other areas as needed.
What’s a heat pump and why does it have 
such a dumb name?
A heat pump, perhaps not surprisingly, changes 
the temperature of your house by moving heat 
around instead of actually generating the heat, 
like a furnace. Air-source heat pumps are the 
most common type, and they use outdoor air 
temperatures and indoor air temperatures 
to change the temperature in your house. 
According to the U.S Department of Energy, 
heat pumps can save homeowners 30 to 40 
percent on their electric bills during the winter 
months. (Okay, maybe it’s not such a dumb 
name after all.)
Heat pumps work like air conditioners, but they 
have the ability to work in reverse. They are 
efficient only in certain climates or at certain 
temperatures. If you live in a temperate climate, 
heat pumps may work well for you. If your loca-
tion offers extreme cold or extreme heat, a tra-
ditional furnace and air conditioner is likely to 
be the more energy-efficient option.
Geothermal heat pumps use this same kind of 
exchange system, but they use hot water from 
deep within the ground instead of the air to draw 
the hot or cool energy. Geothermal heat pumps 
also often include components that draw hot 
water. These pumps are more expensive than 
air-source units, but they’re more efficient than 
traditional heat pumps. To find out more about 
geothermal heat pumps, visit http://www.
geoexchange.org/.

Part I: Getting a Little Green Behind the Ears 
 
In Tokyo, Japan, a 2001 city ordinance mandated that buildings over a certain 
height include rooftop gardens to counteract what some are calling the heat 
island phenomenon, in which rooftops of tall buildings in the city exceed 50 
degrees Celsius (122 degrees Fahrenheit) during the day in the summer. 
Planting lush gardens with trees and flowers lowers the rooftop temperatures 
to 30 degrees Celsius (86 degrees Fahrenheit), reducing the need for air condi-
tioning and creating a nicer place to be.
Improve your air circulation
Have you ever had anyone out to clean your ducts? No, it’s not off-color at all; 
it’s about maximizing air flow, which means that the blower motor in your fan 
has to work less hard to move more air — and that means a savings in power 
(not to mention a squeaky clean feeling). Depending on the type of heating 
and cooling you have in your house, the ductwork that circulates the air can 
(and does) get gummed up with fuzz, gunk, pet hair, and dust bunnies.
The process is usually painless and relatively low cost. You can do some of the 
work yourself and help keep the dust to a minimum by replacing your furnace 
filters regularly and vacuuming the vents if they show signs of dusty buildup.
Cutting the pork from appliances
Okay, now that we’ve focused on the big power picture, we zero in on some 
quick ways to drop those power bills a bit further. You may be surprised to 
see how much you can do with a small investment.
 
First things first — if your appliances have energy-saver settings, use them! 
Dishwashers, refrigerators, washers, dryers, and standalone freezers may all 
have energy-saver settings. These are the no-brainer fixes that may cause you 
to wait a little longer for dry dishes, but if you can reduce greenhouse gases 
and save a buck or two, it’s worth the trade.
 
If you feel in the dark about a piece of electronic equipment or appliance you 
already own, you can use the Energy Star product list to see whether an item 
makes the cut. That basic info gives you a little more insight into how serious 
a suckler that particular item is, and then you can make better choices about 
when and how to use it. See “Checking for Efficiency with the Energy Star” ear-
lier in this chapter for details.

59
 Chapter 3: The Straight Scoop on Power
Is your refrigerator running?
Your fridge may look innocent enough, but it’s actually one of the biggest 
energy hogs in your house. The amount of power required to regulate the 
interior temperature, with the opening and closing of the doors, is a steady 
stream of consumed wattage. In general, newer refrigerators are more energy 
efficient than older ones. (Here’s where we sing the Energy Star refrain 
again.) The most energy-efficient fridges are the ones with the freezer on the 
bottom. (There’s not much you can do to change that if you have one of the 
other kinds, but we just thought you’d like to know.)
Here are some ways you can reduce the energy drain your fridge is throwing 
into deep freeze:
 
✓ Cool foods before placing them in the fridge. This means that the fridge 
doesn’t have to work as hard to cool the food.
 
✓ Stop using the ice maker and drink dispenser. (And for heaven’s sake, 
turn off the LCD television screen on the freezer door!)
 
✓ Defrost foods in the refrigerator rather than on the counter. This helps 
boost the cool factor in the fridge (which means that the electric current 
doesn’t have to do it).
 
✓ Make sure the door of the fridge seals tightly. Coolness could be seeping 
out without you knowing it.
 
✓ Clean the back of the refrigerator periodically. This helps keep the air 
flowing freely inside the appliance, which helps increase efficiency.
 
✓ Sure, it’s kind of hip to have a fridge in the garage, where you can store 
beverages for party guests. But it’s more earth-friendly to trade in two 
smaller fridges for one large, energy-efficient one.
Heat food on the stovetop
You may not think about the amount of energy you use when you cook, but 
heat is heat is heat. (Plus, you probably have the stovetop light on and, if you 
cook like we do, the fan!) Whether you cook with gas or electric heat, here 
are some ways that you can conserve the power you use to prepare meals for 
yourself and your family:
 
✓ On an electric stove, choose the burner size that fits the pot you’re 
using. Putting a small pot on a big burner just heats a lot of space (and 
the surrounding air) for no reason.
 
✓ Check the seal on the oven door because heat can leak out.
 
✓ Use lids on pots to keep the heat in. (There’s that escaping theme again.)

60
Part I: Getting a Little Green Behind the Ears 
If you’re considering purchasing a new, energy-efficient stove, keep these 
ideas in mind:
 
✓ Electric stoves are more efficient than gas.
 
✓ Self-cleaning ovens are most efficient because they’re well insulated and 
retain heat best.
 
✓ Magnetic surface stovetops are becoming more popular as an affordable 
green option. They never wear out, they don’t use electricity or gas, and 
they don’t burn little fingers! (Yes, magnets really can cook. Weird.)
This is the way we wash the clothes
Okay, nobody is a fan of dirty, smelly clothes. Especially if you’ve lived in a 
house with a teenage boy, you know that laundry just needs to be washed. 
That being said, however, you can adopt the following practices to reduce 
your consumption as you do your regular laundry loads:
 
✓ Keep an eye on your washer’s water settings. The average load uses 40 
gallons of water. Control the load selection based on what you really 
need and reduce the amount of water when possible.
 
✓ Insulate your hot water heater to help retain the heat.
 
✓ Reduce the temperature on your hot water heater to 120 degrees.
 
✓ Keep the dryer’s lint trap clean.
 
✓ Dry loads one after another. Stopping and starting actually uses more 
energy.
 
✓ Choose the Permanent Press dryer cycle because it air dries the last few 
minutes of the cycle.
If you’re in the market for a new dryer, consider buying one with an auto-
matic sensor that ends the load when the clothes are dry (and of course — 
think Energy Star!)
Leave the light on, Mother
Please make sure you’re using energy-efficient light bulbs! This is the year 
to make the choice to replace all those 60-watt incandescent light bulbs that 
burn out every eight months with 60- to 100-watt CFLs (compact fluorescent 
lights) that last 10 years or more. CFLs light your house with the same warm 
light — and in a variety of styles and output levels — but use only about one-
fifth the energy.

61
 Chapter 3: The Straight Scoop on Power
You can now buy the new energy efficient bulbs in department stores, hard-
ware stores, and probably even grocery stores nationwide. Consider it an 
investment in sustainability over disposability.
 
Governments all over the world are introducing measures designed to curtail 
incandescent bulb use. Venezuela and Brazil already made the change; Ireland 
and Switzerland phase their bulbs out this year; and Argentina, Italy, and the 
United Kingdom set a deadline of 2011. Canada and the United States bring up 
the rear with 2012 and 2012–2014 switchover dates, respectively.
Upgrading to green batteries, anyone?
Continuing with the theme of sustainability over disposability, do you have a 
gamer in the house? If so, you know what it’s like to pay $8.99 for an 8-pack of 
AA batteries . . . every other week. Similarly, if you have a GPS system in your 
car, an attachable flash for your high-end camera, remote controls for your 
television, or any number of other portable battery-driven devices (don’t get 
us started on remote-control cars), you may be an easy audience for a pre-
sentation on the benefits of green batteries.
Green batteries, which you’ll see labeled as nickel metal hydride (NiMH) and 
lithium ion (Li-ion), can save you money, time, and consternation if you get in 
the habit of recharging and monitoring their use.
 
If you’ve had your rechargeable batteries for a while and they don’t seem to 
be charging properly, clean the tops with rubbing alcohol and they should 
work just fine!
 
Don’t want to be disloyal to the Energizer Bunny? Don’t worry! Energizer 
makes its own line of rechargeable batteries. Prices range from $25 to $40 for 
chargers and $8 to $12 for small packs of rechargeable batteries. It’s a good 
way to cut down on expense and hassle and do something good for the earth 
at the same time.
Trimming fuel consumption
Conserving fuel is another way to conserve energy and resources. Here are a 
few ways to reduce the number of gallons of gas that your ride guzzles:
 
✓ Think through your trips and combine errands.
 
✓ Take shorter routes wherever possible.

62
Part I: Getting a Little Green Behind the Ears 
 
✓ Plan your route so you won’t sit in traffic.
 
✓ Use public transportation wherever possible.
 
✓ Share a ride with a friend.
 
✓ Ride your bike or walk when you can.
 
✓ Work from home a few days a week (or every day).

practicality of working at home (perks all around!), see Part IV.

results. Watch any weight-loss reality show and you 
know that over time, leaving that bagel on the plate, skip-
ping the extra cookie, and doing a few extra sit-ups really 
do make a difference. Greening your home computing 
practices is just like that. A bit at a time, you can work 
from the general to the granular, looking more and more

I
f you’ve read the previous chapters, now you know the lay of the land 
in relation to your household energy use, and you’re ready to zero in on 
the amount of energy that your hardware and peripherals are sipping. In the 
scheme of things, dialing back your energy use for a single PC might not seem 
like a huge energy savings or take much of a bite out of the greenhouse gases 
pumping into the air right now. But every watt you save makes a difference. 
And by multiplying your energy savings by all the people in your office, school, 
city, or state, you begin to see what a big change just a few watts can make.
So. It’s time to take a closer look at that hardware. Grab a cup of organic, fair-
trade coffee, scoot on up to the computer, and take a closer look.
Starting an Inventory of Your 
Computing Equipment
When you begin to look at energy use and computers, you realize there are a 
few givens:
 
✓ Every computer uses some sort of power to do what it does.
 
✓ There is little uniformity about energy use — different computer 
systems use different amounts of power for different things.
 
✓ When you add peripherals — such as mobile devices, printers, and 
cameras — you increase the amount involved to run it all.

66
Part II: Choosing Your Green PC Path 
Pretty simple, don’t you think? The challenge comes in determining how 
much energy this all adds up to for your home (chances are that you’ve got 
more than one computer and at least a couple of digital devices) and finding 
ways to scale back or upgrade to a higher efficiency, as the case may be.
As you start on your green computing path, you’ll find it helpful to know what 
you have exactly. For example, how many computers, printers, sets of speak-
ers, game consoles, and more are in your house? Also, take a closer look at 
when you bought those items and whether they’re Energy Star certified. You 
can use Table 4-1 to get started.

What you gain from completing Table 4-1 is a picture of not only what you 
have but also how old and thus how energy-efficient your equipment is. In 

67
 Chapter 4: Assessing What You’ve Got
general, older computers don’t have the same green consciousness of newer 
computers. That’s understandable, really. In the early days, developers were 
just trying to get the things to work. The working well comes with age and 
refinement (which is true for some computers and programs, anyway).
If you have a PC that shipped with Windows XP or a Mac that came with OS 9, 
chances are that energy efficiency wasn’t foremost in the designer’s mind 
when that system was on the drawing board. More often than not, however, 
you can’t just look at a list of what you have and determine how green your 
current home computing environment is. Case in point: The Greenpeace 
Guide to Greener Electronics considers a company (in this case, a computer 
manufacturer) green if it has a plan for three areas of greening:
 
✓ Toxin-free manufacturing
 
✓ Energy efficiency
 
✓ Responsible recycling programs
In the 2008 version of the Guide, Sony, Toshiba, Dell, and HP were somewhere 
between trying to be green and just don’t give a damn. And some of the other 
players — including two huge manufacturers of popular game systems — fell 
on the lowest end of the scale.
However, the way the companies are rated on that scale may be different 
from what you see drawing current through your house. Based on laboratory 
tests (no PCs or Macs were mistreated during the application of these tests), 
the following manufacturers’ systems did pretty well when it came to energy 
efficiency when using basic desktop applications:
 
✓ Apple
 
✓ Dell
 
✓ Lenovo
 
If you want to take a look at the ratings yourself, you can download the Guide 
to Greener Electronics at this site:

A more holistic inventory of your home computing environment gives you a 
clearer picture of your energy use and helps you pinpoint realistic ways to 
green your home computing based on your needs and activities. In later sec-
tions of this chapter, you discover how to assess your equipment as well as 
your habits.
How much juice is it, really?
Whether you have a desktop or laptop computer from one of the manufactur-
ers listed in the preceding section, you may wonder just how much energy 
your computer consumes.
Laptops understandably require less power than desktops because they have 
fewer pieces (no standalone monitor, at least). With that big watt difference 
out of the way, Table 4-2 outlines generally what your computer and accom-
panying components may use, energy-wise.

These are general estimates, but bear in mind that your computer uses differ-
ent amounts of energy depending on what it’s doing. If your computer or 
peripheral device is in Sleep mode or sitting idle, for example, if consumes less 
power than a printer pumping out a 20-page report. For more information on 
specific energy measurements in different computer operating states, see 
Chapter 9.

 Chapter 4: Assessing What You’ve Got
Your computer equipment may not break the bank for you in terms of energy 
expense, but when you add up all your tech equipment (that’s right, desk-
tops, laptops, digital cameras, printers, MP3 players, game consoles, and 
more) and then add your neighbor’s tech items, and their neighbor’s, and 
your whole city, state, region . . . you get the idea. A little savings can mean a 
lot, if those little savings are made to scale.
 
You really are cutting back on CO2 when you conserve power. You can reduce 
carbon emissions by as much as 67 kg per desktop per year when you just 
shut it down when it’s not in use. If 5,000 people decide to do this regularly, 
that keeps 288 tons of CO2 out of the atmosphere! (See Chapter 2 for an intro-
duction to energy and CO2.)
Understanding How You Use Devices
How you use your devices is as important as your inventory. In the following 
sections, we take a look at common habits in the way people use their com-
puters, printers, and more. As you read through the following sections, con-
sider how you and others in your household use your equipment. Having this 
information can help you find ways to green your home computing.
When is your computer on? Generally, people power their computers in one 
of the following ways. Read through the following scenarios and consider 
your typical powering method.
 
✓ All the time: Not long ago, repeated power-down and power-up cycles 
could shorten computers’ lives, and the conventional wisdom was to 
leave your computer on all the time. Today, it really is okay to power 
down your computer. You won’t hurt its feelings by letting it know 
you’re putting it away.
 
✓ When you step away: Studies show that the majority of the time that 
most business and school computers are on and drawing current, they 
are idle or in a low state of active use. For example, as you write a report 
in Word, you might write a paragraph, stop, look something up, get a 
cup of coffee, go back to the computer. . . . How much of that is work-
intensive processing time?
 
 The general green rule of thumb is that if you will be away from the com-
puter for more than two hours, it’s worth the power you’re going to con-
serve if you go ahead and shut down the system completely. (Turn off 
the power strip, too, while you’re at it.)

70
Part II: Choosing Your Green PC Path 
 
✓ Just when you need it: Okay, so you know you don’t leave the computer 
on all the time. If you just turn on your computer now and then when 
you need it, you’re already conserving resources. To create a clearer 
picture, consider making a conscious effort to note when you tend to 
use your computer over the period of a week or a month.
Knowing how much energy your 
computing tasks need
Different computing tasks use different amounts of power. Some activities, 
such as watching a movie on your computer, playing a game with high-end 
animation, or working with a processing-heavy illustration and modeling pro-
gram, really do make the computer work for its power.
A clear understanding of how you use your computer can be helpful as you 
decide whether to work with equipment you have or to upgrade an old com-
puter. For example, if you use your computer to watch movies one or two 
times a week, you’ll maximize the benefit of upgrading to Energy Star equip-
ment. However, if you use your computer mostly for reading newspapers on 
the Web and writing e-mails to your friends and family, sprucing up what you 
have may be the greener (and money-saving) way to go.
Thinking about your printing habits
Printing is a key area in which you can green your home computing. To 
get started, assess how you use the printer and what your current printing 
habits and needs are. The following points can help you get started in your 
assessment; to save paper, feel free to make notes in the margins:
 
✓ When is your printer turned on?
 
✓ Is the printer always plugged in? If the printer is plugged into a power 
strip, note whether the strip is always turned on.
 
✓ How many printers do you have in your house? If you have multiple 
printers, you can set up a home network and share one printer, which 
cuts down on the amount of toner or ink you use, along with the amount 
of energy consumed.
 
✓ What do you print and what happens to those printouts?

71
 Chapter 4: Assessing What You’ve Got
 
✓ What print settings do you use? For example, many printers offer qual-
ity settings, such as Draft or Best, that use less or more ink. You may 
also have the option of printing on both sides of the page (a setting 
sometimes called Duplex). And most software offers a Print Preview 
option so that you can check whether your printout will look right and 
change your document if needed before you print.
 
✓ What kind of paper do you use? This may include blank white paper as 
well as photo paper and more.
Chapter 11 is dedicated to green printing. You discover ways to change the 
way you use your printer to save energy. And you can consider reducing the 
number of pages you print or eliminating printing altogether by reading and 
sharing electronic files instead.

Doing the peripheral math
If your house is like many U.S. households today, you have a number of 
devices that connect to your computer at various times. Your added devices 
might include any or all of the following:
 
✓ Digital camera
 
✓ Digital camcorder
 
✓ Cellphone
 
✓ Computer speaker system
 
✓ Xbox 360
 
✓ Nintendo Wii
 
✓ Playstation 3
 
✓ MP3 player, such as an iPod or a Zune
Add to this the electronic equipment that might not be considered computer 
equipment but can be used alongside your favorite PC — your HDTV, a DVD 
player, and more — and you’ve got quite a bit of power in use. And perhaps 
much of that is in Standby mode. For now, take an inventory of all the periph-
erals in use in your house as well as how you use them and how they need to 
be charged.
Later in this chapter, you find details about smart power strips for plugging 
in stationary peripherals. In Chapter 10, you find out how to choose power-
saving settings for gadgets you use on the go as well as how to charge these 
devices using green power.
Working Better with What You Have
The growing use of computers — in homes, businesses, schools, and else-
where around the world — has a big impact on energy consumption, adding 
a load to household and office budgets everywhere. Basic good practices for 
computing — backing up data and programs, securing networks, managing 
user accounts, and planning and paying for services — is something every 
computer user, not just corporate IT departments, needs to deal with.
When you think about it, you realize that even though businesses and 
schools have a huge number of computers — one college campus, for exam-
ple, has 18,000 computers that contribute to half a million dollars a year in 

73
 Chapter 4: Assessing What You’ve Got
university expenses — homes far outnumber businesses and universities. 
Each person who works in a business goes home and likely turns on the com-
puter at night, as well. Students at the university level may use computers in 
the library and then go home to check their Facebook pages, play Call of Duty 
on their Xbox 360s, and listen to the Shins on their MP3 players.
The hits go on and on.
So you can see that you’ve got an important role here. Whether you use a 
desktop or laptop system, whether you have a make and model from a green-
leaning manufacturer or one who hasn’t really caught on yet, you can reduce 
your consumption and begin to manage your energy use more efficiently. In 
the sections that follow, you take a look at habits, upgrades, tools, and ser-
vices that can help you get the most out of any home computing setup.
Developing computer habits 
that save energy
Here are a few guidelines you can use to cut back on the power you pump 
into a dozing system:
 
✓ Turn on only what you use. (Leave the printer off if you don’t need it.)
 
✓ Unplug devices you aren’t using. If you have more than one system 
on the power strip, unplug the one you don’t need before flipping the 
switch.
 
✓ Consolidate the tasks you do at the computer. With a good plan in 
mind, you can power up, do what you need to do, and power down all in 
one session.
 
✓ Put yourself on a schedule. (Yes, it’s more fun to check e-mail every so 
often in the evening, but is it really that much different than once after 
work and once a few hours later, before bed?)
 
✓ Find an enjoyable way to spend the brief period of time it takes for 
your computer to power up after you turn it on. (That delay is what 
causes many folks to leave the computer running.) What can you do in 
two minutes? Meditate? Jog in place? Sing? (Your family will love that.)
 
✓ Know what you’re saving. Use a power meter or keep track of the 
watts you’re consuming when you turn off the computer. Over time, it 
adds up — and that inspires you to look for other ways you can green 
your computing practices. Chapter 3 covers devices that can monitor 
your power consumption.

74
Part II: Choosing Your Green PC Path 
 
You can reduce the amount of energy your computer uses while it’s active by 
optimizing your computer’s power management settings. It’s easier than you 
might think! See Chapter 9 for details.
 
Do you have lots of electronic equipment on all at the same time? Think heat 
waves. Your technology is raising the temperature in your house — perhaps 
ever so slightly — if you leave the current running all day while you’re at 
work. Why waste the watts? Turn your electronic devices off; unplug; shut 
them down when they don’t have your undivided attention. The earth thanks 
you (and the rest of us breathe easier).
Using your monitor with 
efficiency in mind
It’s not hard to imagine the amount of power your monitor must drink in. 
Early monitors — those old cathode-ray tube (CRT) displays that took up half 
of your desktop — slurped up a huge percentage of the total wattage your 
computer needed.
Today’s monitors are considerably more energy-efficient, smaller, lighter, 
and better in just about every sense of the word (including the display tech-
nology and screen resolution). Monitor manufacturers take the Energy Star 
seriously and live up to its standards.
 
But one misconception is that any monitor that is Energy Star approved 
comes configured with energy-saving features already in place. In fact, the 
opposite is true — your Energy Star monitor has energy-saving features, but 
you’ll need to consult the manual (sorry) either in the box or on the CD with 
the monitor’s drivers to find out how to make the display as energy-efficient as 
possible.
 
Here are a few ideas for saving energy that might otherwise shine out through 
the monitor’s face:
 
✓ Turn it off. If you’re going down the hall, to a meeting, or to the store 
and don’t want to turn the computer off or put it to sleep, turn off the 
monitor.
 
✓ Don’t use a screen saver. It wastes energy and can mess up fast recov-
ery from Sleep mode.
 
✓ Consider upgrading your monitor. Depending on the monitor you 
choose, your purchase might quickly pay for itself in saved energy. 
Chapter 5 covers monitor upgrades in more detail.

75
 Chapter 4: Assessing What You’ve Got
 
Monitors are the stuff that toxic dreams are made of, and they aren’t meant to 
end up in landfills or burn piles. Be sure to dispose of an old monitor appropri-
ately. Chapter 8 explains how.
Souping up your current computer
Although the new greenest-laptop-on-the-planet ads look great (don’t they?), 
it may be a lot greener to consider ways you can make your own computer 
more energy-efficient. By keeping the system you already have and making 
some small changes to increase its energy efficiency, you may be able to keep 
the system out of a potential landfill, get a few more years of use from a per-
fectly good system, and save money.
You don’t have to buy fancy items and enhancements to make your computer 
greener. You may be able to improve the earth-friendly qualities of what you 
already have and save valuable power — and reduce CO2 emissions — at the 
same time. Here are a few ways you can enhance your current computer’s 
energy efficiency:
 
✓ Increase your RAM. A faster computer processes information more 
quickly, with less churning and chunking for disk access — and that’s 
good for energy flow. (Of course, with a faster computer, you also run 
the risk of enjoying being at your computer more, which could increase 
the number of hours you’re staring at the monitor.)
 
✓ Upgrade your operating system. The latest operating systems — 
Windows Vista, Windows 7, and Mac OS X — include power management 
and energy-saving features.
 
✓ Use your operating system’s power management features. Windows 
XP, Vista, and Windows 7 enable you to choose a preset power manage-
ment theme or create one of your own. Be sure to use the power man-
agement features to reduce your power use as much as possible. See 
Chapter 9 for details.
 
✓ Upgrade some hardware. New graphics cards, printers, and monitors 
have been designed in the energy-aware era. As always, look for the 
Energy Star, and be sure to do the due diligence to find out what energy-
saving features the manufacturer has included.
Upgrading can be a complicated but cost-effective and green endeavor. If 
you’re considering this path to greening your computer, flip to Chapter 5, 
where we cover upgrades in more detail.

Part II: Choosing Your Green PC Path 
Control your fans, control your fate
 
Now consider yourself warned right up front: This isn’t for the faint-hearted or 
the technophobe. But if you’re handy with a few computer tools and know 
your way around the inside of a PC, consider replacing your computer fan, 
changing your power supply, or reorganizing the cables on the motherboard 
to allow for better air flow through the case.
Better air flow equals less resistance, which results in more air and less 
power to push it. Nice. And better air flow equals PC cooling, which means a 
longer life for your PC. Really nice.
One other easy-to-forget-but-oh-so-important reminder: Clean your fan vent 
regularly to remove grime, dust, and stray boll weevils that just happen to 
wander by.
Behold the power of power strips
You can reduce and control the amount of power leaching away when your 
many devices are in Standby mode by getting a smart power strip. This type 
of surge protector knows when your various peripherals are idle so that it 
can stop the draw of current automatically. Slick, eh?
The Isole IDP-3050 Plug Load Control, shown in Figure 4-1, has a total of eight 
outlets. Two are traditional outlets like you’d find on any regular power 
strip. The remaining six are controlled in the sense that when energy is being 
drawn, the outlets recognize that; when power is not being drawn, the device 
turns off the outlet so that the inactive peripheral does not leach unneces-
sary energy. Another feature, called the Personal Sensor, turns on all power 
for connected items at one time, based on settings you control. The company 
site (www.wattstopper.com/products/details.html?id=74) offers 
the strip for $90.

 Chapter 4: Assessing What You’ve Got
The Smart Strip has a similar goal but monitors when computers and other 
devices are turned on or off. The Smart Strip is available in a number of 
different models (and price ranges), and refurbished Smart Strips are 
also offered on the company’s Web site, at http://bitsltd.net/
ConsumerProducts/index.htm.
Considering your mouse’s 
environmental impact
Although real four-footed furry mice may abound in landfills (let’s not think 
about that, okay?), the mouse on your desktop isn’t contributing to global 
warming in any major way. In fact, a regular wired mouse, connected to your 
desktop computer, isn’t using any power. Of course, it’s possible that your 
wired mouse is made from not-very-earth-friendly chemicals, so don’t throw 
it in the fireplace when you’re done with it.
A wireless mouse draws a little current from its battery, and you’ll need to 
replace the battery from time to time.
 
At the time of this writing, there isn’t a preponderance of green mice scamper-
ing around. Google sells a mini wireless mouse made from recycled plastic. It’s 
colorful and hip and available at the Google Store (http://tinyurl.com/
gmouse).
So how can you reduce the appetite of your favorite navigating rodents? Here 
are a few pointers:
 
✓ Trade the wireless mouse for an old-fashioned wired one. We know, it’s not 
as cool to have a wired mouse. But it’s the planet we’re talking about here.
 
✓ If you must use the wireless mouse, go green in the battery department. 
Flip to Chapter 2 for tips on green batteries.
 
✓ Use your laptop’s touchpad instead of the wireless mouse just to save a 
tiny bit of DC power.
 
Researchers at Delft University of Technology in the Netherlands were devel-
oping and testing a solar mouse, complete with mini solar panels inside. The 
problem? Usually a hand was covering the surface of the mouse, blocking the 
solar rays needed to charge the device. Not sure we’ll be seeing that green 
tech product in the big-box stores anytime soon.

Part II: Choosing Your Green PC Path 
Speed up your Internet access
Most people spend quite a bit of time online every day. At first you might 
think, well, that doesn’t really cost anything. I’m just surfing the Web. But 
think again — your computer, monitor, and other components are still pull-
ing current. The ISP (Internet service provider) that provides you with access 
to the Internet pulls a lot of current. And as you click from link to link, site 
to site, bouncing all over the world, your actions move through dozens or 
hundreds or thousands of servers, through miles and unfathomable miles 
of cable (or transmitted via wireless transmission) that was created and is 
maintained by goods, services, employees, utilities, and . . . the list goes on 
and on.
So that little act of browsing can have a big footprint, when you consider all 
the touches along the way.
How can you green your Internet access? There are a couple of things you 
can do. First, you can check out the access speed you’re getting from your 
service. Find out if the access is as fast as they promise. The faster the 
access, the quicker you’ll find what you need and the faster you can turn the 
computer off, go outside, and work in the garden.
CNET offers the Bandwidth Meter Online Speed Test that enables you to 
clock your Internet speed. Want to take a test drive? Here are the steps:
 
1. Go to http://reviews.cnet.com/internet-speed-test. (See 
Figure 4-2).
 
2. Enter your area code in the box.
 
3. Click the appropriate radio button to indicate the type of connection 
you currently have.
 
4. From the drop-down menu, choose your ISP.
 
 If you don’t see your provider in the list, click the Other box and type 
the name of the service provider you use.
 
5. Click Go. 
 
 The results of the access speed test show you where your access speed 
rates in comparison to the range of possibility.

Choosing an ISP who cares
If you have the option in your area, you can choose a service provider that 
offers at least some kind of green policy and action plan. (We were surprised 
to find that some providers lack any kind of green language.)
A few ISPs use renewable energy sources to power their Web hosting and 
access services, but it’s still early in the green tech industry for total sustain-
ability and green offerings. Some companies purchase a percentage of energy 
from renewable sources. (AT&T buys 10 percent of its energy from green 
sources, for example.) One company, Green ISP (www.greenisp.net), oper-
ates out of the U.K. but draws on renewable power sources in the U.S. The 
idea has merit, but ISPs are still in the infancy of providing truly green, work-
able, sustainable options for Web access and hosting.

80
Part II: Choosing Your Green PC Path 
One of the best things you can do at this point is find out more about your 
current Internet provider’s green policies. If the company doesn’t have green 
policies, ask them why not! Table 4-3 provides a quick look at who among the 
top 10 ISPs is thinking green.

What about Web hosting?
If you have your own Web site and pay to host 
it, check out green Web hosting services as 
well as green ISPs. Although ISPs are still slow 
to demonstrate their dedication to renewable 
energy, Web hosting companies are a little fur-
ther down the road. Some groups buy renew-
able energy credits (RECs), which are available 
in a kind of carbon offset program, to counter 
the amount of carbon emission their services 
kick into the atmosphere.
Here are some Web hosting companies that 
currently use renewable energy to provide ser-
vices to their customers:
 ✓ Dreamhost (www.dreamhost.com/
aboutus-green.html) is a completely 
carbon-neutral Web host.
 ✓ AISO (www.aiso.net) has a tagline of 
“Web hosting as nature intended” and gen-
erates 100 percent of its power using solar 
energy. 
 ✓ ecoSky (www.ecosky.com/faq/
powered-by-renewable-energy.
html) is powered by renewable energy. 
 ✓ Planetmind (www.planetmind.net) 
uses both solar and wind energy to power 
its services.

 Chapter 4: Assessing What You’ve Got
Making the Case for a New Purchase
In the reuse, reduce, recycle approach, purchasing a brand-spanking-new 
computer comes in way last:
 
✓ Reusing what you can is important. If you can extend the life of your 
current computer, you’re making the most of the energy and resources 
that were already used in manufacturing the equipment. You also delay 
the disposal issue (you find out more about that in Chapter 8). By 
evaluating your computer’s age, performance, components, and energy 
consumption (for the system as well as all peripherals that tag along), 
and doing what you can to reduce the power you may be wasting, you 
can reduce your consumption and reuse what you have, which helps the 
planet.
 
✓ Reducing the power and other resources you use is the next natural 
step. Manage what you can by controlling where, when, and why elec-
tronics draw power.
 
✓ Recycling the devices you replace is an essential part of the process. 
If your system is an old energy hog, buying a new green PC becomes an 
earth-friendly act if you make sure to recycle your system responsibly. 
(You find out more about recycling electronics in Chapter 8.)
Are you on the fence about whether to upgrade what you have or move into 
something new (with a good plan for recycling)? No worries — Chapter 5 
walks you through the process of giving your computer a green makeover, 
and Chapter 6 shows you the green-light specials.
A prop for not-so-green laptops
A carbon offset is a way of paying for the size 
of your CO2 footprint to help offset its nega-
tive effects. The Powered Green laptop initia-
tive is a program that lets laptop buyers offset 
their machine’s effect on the environment by 
investing in wind energy. Powered Green sells 
stickers for $16 each. Participating users can 
display their stickers proudly (on the laptop 
lids) and know that their contributions support 
wind turbines that more than make up the cost 
of the sticker and the CO2 they’re contributing 
by using their laptop. To get your own Powered

G
iving your computer a green makeover is a little like renovating your 
favorite room. In most cases, the basic structure is fine. Chances are 
that you won’t want to bust down walls and add new doorways, but chang-
ing the lighting, wall decoration and color, furniture, and arrangement are all 
part of the fun.
Similarly, you can pinpoint a few things in your computer to update or 
change so that your existing computer can continue pumping out the bits 
and bytes needed to keep up with current technology. Choosing this path 
may be the best way to green your computer, because it offers the following 
advantages:
 
✓ You get more use out of the energy used to build your current com-
puter. With the average lifespan of the typical U.S. home computer 
estimated at only three years, a lot of computers wind up in landfills or 
shipped across the sea! 
 
 The most earth-friendly thing you can do is take a close look at what you 
already have and determine whether you can work with what you’ve got. 

84
Part II: Choosing Your Green PC Path 
 
✓ Upgrading certain computer parts can yield high energy savings, as 
we explain later in this chapter
 
✓ You may get more bang for your buck with an upgrade over a new 
purchase. Memory is cheap, folks!
In this chapter, you find an introduction to several high-impact green 
upgrades. Even if you’re not one to tinker with your PC, you can still reap 
these advantages by hiring a pro to do it for you.
 
Consider both options: making over your existing computer or springing for a 
new one. If you decide to go the purchase route, you’ll know you’ve done your 
due diligence and made the best choice for the environment, your family, and 
your wallet.
Weighing Your Makeover Possibilities
Although some of the techniques in this chapter require a little technical 
know-how — as well as the willingness to pop the hood on your computer 
and take a look inside (or have your favorite tech guru do it) — most of the 
sections in this chapter are simple enough to do without training wheels.
The three biggest energy hogs in your computer system include the system’s 
CPU (the microprocessor that is the brain of the whole machine), your graph-
ics card, and your monitor. Chances are that you’re not going to swap out 
the CPU (unless you want to rebuild the system from the ground up, which is 
beyond the scope of this chapter). You can renovate your system and save 
beaucoup watts (and dollars, too) by making the following changes:
 
✓ Replacing energy-draining components with more efficient models: 
If you’re still using an old CRT monitor, trading it for an LCD monitor is 
a good bet. Your graphics card can also use a lot of energy if you’re a 
gamer, use graphics-intensive programs like Photoshop or Photoshop 
Elements, or watch a lot of movies on your computer. Many graphics 
card manufacturers have stepped up the efficiency of their products in 
recent years, so you’ll find it worthwhile to take a look.
 
 Or if you’re using a high-power card for low-power tasks, you might ben-
efit from right-sizing your card to the tasks you typically do on your com-
puter. That is, make sure the card you’re using doesn’t consume more 
power than you really need. You’re not benefitting from a gaming card if 
you mostly surf the Internet and do word processing, for example.

✓ Increasing RAM and storage capacity: RAM (Random Access Memory) 
stores the programs and files you open and work with during a single 
work session. When you turn the computer off, whatever is stored in RAM 
goes away (the actual program and your saved data file remain in storage 
on your hard disk, however). Computers that don’t have enough RAM 
run slowly and spend a substantial amount of time retrieving information 
and updating memory; this causes more processing and increases wear 
and tear on the system. If your computer is running slowly, redrawing 
the screen at an agonizing rate, and chewing on even simple changes for 
a long period of time, adding RAM to your computer can help speed up 
things and reduce the processing power your computer is using.
 
 If your computer is pretty quick with programs and files, but turns slug-
gish when you hop online, your Internet connection (not your RAM) may 
be the culprit. Flip to Chapter 4 for help on testing and upgrading your 
Internet connection.
 
 Storage memory, on the other hand, reflects your computer’s capacity 
to store files such as photos, documents, home movies, software, and 
more. If you’re considering replacing your computer because you’re 
running out of room, check out the section “What’s a Terabyte among 
Friends?” later in this chapter, which explains just how easy replacing 
your hard drive or adding an external hard drive can be.
 
✓ Choosing an earth-friendly laptop battery: The first step, of course, is 
to use the one you’ve got as long as you can and then dispose of it prop-
erly when it begins to bow out. When you’re ready to shop for a new 
battery, look for green batteries like the Boston Power Enviro battery 
available for 18 different HP laptops. The Enviro can be charged 1,000 
times (average laptop batteries begin to show a drop in quality after 100 
to 150 charges) and is made from earth-healthy materials.
 
✓ Swapping your old power supply for a greener model: Most power 
supplies pump out one steady rate of power whether your system 
uses the whole amount or not. You can check out the 80 Plus program 
(www.80plus.org) to find a power supply that delivers only the 
amount of power the computer and peripherals are drawing. All power 
supplies certified for the 80 Plus program are also lead free, making 
them environmentally friendly, too. 
 
VIA Technologies, a manufacturer of energy-efficient processors, has a well-
developed green strategy. To find out more about VIA and their processors’ 
power efficiency, visit www.via.com.tw/en/initiatives/greencomputing. 
Although you probably won’t be doing anything as drastic as swapping out 
the motherboard and processor in your PC in order to improve your green 
factor, it’s not a bad idea to keep in mind — or refer to your favorite IT 
person — if you ever need to make a big change.

86
Part II: Choosing Your Green PC Path 
 
You look at wattage quite a bit in this chapter — really throughout this book. 
When you turn on a 100 watt device and leave it one for 1 hour, you’ve used 
100 watt/hours. Power companies charge by the kilowatt/hour (a kilowatt is 
1,000 watts). Let’s say your power company charges $0.35 per kilowatt/hour. 
Turning on a 100 watt device for 1 hour costs you 100/1000 * 0.35 or $0.035. 
Three and a half cents doesn’t sound like much, but it does add up.
Shrinking the Elephant (Er, Monitor) 
on Your Desktop
Now admit it. If you’ve still got a huge CRT monitor sitting on your desktop 
at home, you hide it when friends come to dinner. You put a tablecloth over 
it and position a plant on top and pretend it doesn’t exist. Or you close the 
doors to the computer cabinet or make sure your guests never walk down 
the hall past your office.
Early CRT monitors were large radiating machines that poured light out the 
front and heat from the tops and sides. They took up the entire surface of the 
system unit, or at least half your computer desk. You needed to take a deep 
breath before you hoisted it off the desktop.
CRT (which stands for cathode ray tube) monitors are still sold today, and 
although they consume a lot of energy and pump out a lot of heat, they still have 
their advocates. CRT monitors offer high quality and a level of flexibility — you 
get good, clear resolution whether you look at the monitor from the side or spot 
on. Some CRTs are also lower cost than LCDs, at least initially; but LCDs live 
longer, use less energy, and radiate a lot less heat — all of which add up to some 
extra green.
Spicing up your Mac
Before you make any upgrades for your Mac, it’s 
a good idea to check your warranty before you 
pop the hood and decide to add RAM as a do-it-
yourself project. You can make an easy and safe 
upgrade that doesn’t risk your warranty cover-
age by adding a bigger, faster hard drive, which 
gives you much more space for storage.
You may also want to upgrade RAM or add a 
faster graphics card. Before you do either of 
these things, though, talk to your Apple repre-
sentative to find out what is permitted under 
warranty and what isn’t. 

87
 Chapter 5: Giving Your Computer a Green Makeover
LCD (which stands for liquid crystal display) monitors are smaller and more 
compact, use considerably less energy, and don’t ramp up the heat in your 
office. Monitors for home use have, on average, 15- to 20-inch screens. Some 
popular LCD manufacturers include Acer, Asus, HP, Samsung, and Sony.
 
Trading in the CRT for the LCD is an easy place to start when you want to 
make a big impact on your power bottom line. Be sure to go to a store to do 
some shopping before you buy (even if you purchase online), because being 
able to see the variety of sizes and styles gives you a sense of the best monitor 
for your space.
 
Your CRT may slurp down 100 watts of power all by itself, but the threat to the 
environment doesn’t stop there. CRT monitors may contain up to five different 
toxic substances: lead, mercury, barium, cadmium, and phosphorous. 
Dumped in a landfill or burned in a village, these elements can leach into 
groundwater or be released into the air. Earn good karma by retiring your CRT 
monitor in an earth-friendly way.
Finding a green monitor
 
Want to know which monitors measure up to green standards? Use the EPEAT 
(Environmental Product Environment Assessment Tool) to find out. EPEAT is 
designed to help you evaluate whether tech products live up to their green 
promises. Follow these steps to find a green replacement monitor on the 
EPEAT site:
 
1. Check a site such as CNET for reviews on the latest green monitors. 
 
 The EPEAT registry lists more monitors than most people want to 
research, so it helps to have a few models in mind before you begin. 
Alternatively, you can randomly select a few monitors from the list and 
compare them, which we cover in a moment. 
 
2. Visit the EPEAT Registry at http://www.epeat.net.
 
3. On the main page, scroll down to see the EPEAT Quick Search Tool.
 
4. Find Monitors in the Product column on the left. Then on the right 
click the number for the grade of monitor you’d like or the total 
number of monitors (on the right) if you want to see all monitors in 
the registry.
 
 The grade indicates the EPEAT rating for a monitor’s efficiency. As in the 
Olympic Games, gold is for the best, or most efficient, products.

88
Part II: Choosing Your Green PC Path 
 
5. Select the check boxes of any monitors that interest you. Then click 
the Compare button.
 
 You can then see how the monitors compare based on the specific 
EPEAT criteria. Hover your mouse pointer over the criterion and a 
ToolTip explaining it appears.
 
Hopefully, you have narrowed down your selections to two or three different 
monitors. If you want to do a little price comparison, write down the model 
numbers for each monitor that interests you and point your browser to www.
nextag.com. Enter each model into the search box to find out who’s offering 
the best deal on each one.
Understanding Energy Star 
standards for monitors
Before a monitor is approved as Energy Star–compliant, it must meet strin-
gent requirements for On, Sleep, and Off modes:
 
✓ The amount of power used in the On state varies depending on the 
monitor’s screen resolution. For example, a 17" monitor may qualify 
when using 28 watts (such as the Acer V173 q), while a 19" moni-
tor may qualify when using 35 watts (such as the Acer P193W t). It’s 
interesting to note that a search of the Web site at http://www.
energystar.gov/index.cfm?fuseaction=find_a_product.
ShowProductGroup&pgw_code=MO shows all kinds of LCD monitors 
making the grade, but not a single CRT monitor.
 
✓ In Sleep mode, the monitor must consume 2 watts or less.
 
✓ In Off mode, the monitor must consume 1 watt or less.
 
Be sure to set the power management features for the monitor you buy; not all 
monitors ship with energy-saving features in effect. 
Gaming and More with a 
Greener Video Card
The graphics card in your system is a big power draw — in some cases 
requiring up to a 750-watt power supply to keep things moving. The graphics 
card has a lot of work to do, turning bits of information into the image you 

89
 Chapter 5: Giving Your Computer a Green Makeover
see and interact with on the screen. The graphics card displays everything 
visible — text, images, buttons, game characters, animations; but it’s all just 
moving dots on a screen. (That’s hard to believe, isn’t it?)
Your graphics card works hand-in-hand with your monitor, converting the 
data into information that’s displayed on the screen. Different graphics cards 
have different capabilities. The processing power and cooling system of the 
card have a big impact on the card’s energy efficiency and life. Although the 
specifics of upgrading your card vary from computer to computer, the follow-
ing steps walk you through the basic process of researching a new card:
 
1. Check what your current graphics card is. 
 
 If you completed the inventory of your system in Chapter 4, then you 
already have this information. Flip to that chapter for help identifying 
what hardware you have. 
 
 One popular graphics card in PCs is the ATI Radeon HD 3870 (http://
ati.amd.com/products/Radeonhd3800/index.html). The steps in 
this section use this graphics card as an example. The specifications for 
your card will vary (unless you own the same card).
 
2. Check the energy specs for your current card.
 
 One of the reasons to chose the ATI Radeon HD 3870 is that it has a 
number of different specifications as described at http://ati.amd.
com/products/Radeonhd3800/requirements.html. This graphics 
card starts by needing a 450-watt minimum power supply. The graphics 
card requires Peripheral Component Interconnect (PCI) Express power 
connector that supplies 75-watts, so you need to check your power 
supply to ensure it can supply that much power. The PCI connector is 
the most popular graphics card connection today.
 
 Some motherboards actually supply two PCI connectors so you can 
connect two graphics cards together in a Scalable Link Interface (SLI) 
configuration. More graphics cards always means more power — twice 
as much, in fact, and you don’t even get twice the graphics processing 
power for your investment. It’s better to buy a higher powered single 
card solution, rather than invest in a dual card technology unless you 
actually need the processing power.
 
 Older motherboards may also support an Accelerated Graphics Port 
(AGP), but AGP isn’t a popular solution any longer. Even so, AGP tends 
to require far less power than PCI Express does. For example, look at 
the specifications for the ATI Radeon X800 at http://ati.amd.com/
products/radeonx800/radeonx800series/index.html and you 
see that this graphics card only requires a 300-watt power supply. Of 
course, you also get far less graphics processing power when using AGP 
than you do using PCI Express.

90
Part II: Choosing Your Green PC Path 
 
 It’s important to look for hidden energy costs when working with graph-
ics cards. For example, ATI recommends 1 GB of system memory for the 
ATI Radeon HD 3870, but the ATI Radeon X800 only requires 128 MB. 
More memory always translates into more power. Vendors tend to tell 
you about many of these special requirements in an “oh by the way” sec-
tion of the specifications.
 
 Knowing the minimum system requirements for a graphics card is help-
ful because the system requirements indicate how much peak power 
the graphics card will use. However, it’s also helpful to look for hard-
ware reviews that tell you more details. For example, Tom’s Hardware 
provides a review of the ATI Radeon HD 3870 at http://www.toms
hardware.com/reviews/ati-r680-rage-fury-maxx-2,
1764-17.html. This Web site shows you precise power requirements 
for both peak and idle states. Unfortunately, it isn’t always easy to find 
an independent review with numbers you can believe.
 
3. In addition, determine how much graphics processing power you need.
 
 The MHz specification tells you how quickly your current card can 
process graphics. For example, the ATI Radeon HD 3870 specifications 
at http://ati.amd.com/products/Radeonhd3800/specs.html 
tell you that the card runs at 400 MHz. However, processing speed 
isn’t the entire story. A graphics card with more onboard, dedicated, 
memory is likely to run faster than one that has to rely on sharing 
motherboard memory. Using dedicated Synchronous Dynamic Random 
Access Memory (SDRAM) is always faster than the standard RAM on 
the motherboard, plus the graphics card doesn’t have to fetch data 
from motherboard memory using the slower system bus. Features also 
make a difference. If the operating system doesn’t have to simulate a 
feature, such as anti-aliasing, the graphics processor can deliver data 
to the screen faster. Finally, having drivers from the vendor specifically 
for your operating system will reduce power requirements and enhance 
processing speed. When you have to use generic operating system driv-
ers, the graphics card can’t operate at maximum efficiency and won’t 
use all of the functionality it can provide.
 
• If you find the graphics on your computer okay, then just stick with a 
number similar to the one you already have. 
 
• If you’d like to improve graphics processing speed, then you’ll want 
a more powerful card. Avoid older AGP cards because they’re 
truly only worthwhile for simple word processing, a bit of work 
with a spreadsheet, or extremely simple games. If you do standard 
business activities, then a slower, non-SLI, PCI graphics card that 
relies on shared memory should work for you. Business users who 
perform graphics intensive activities such as drawing or creat-
ing charts should look for a faster (350 MHz or above), non-SLI, 
PCI graphics card with 1 GB of onboard SDRAM. If your computer 

91
 Chapter 5: Giving Your Computer a Green Makeover
habits are more graphics intensive, such as gaming, then you may 
want to obtain one of those SLI PCI graphics cards with a fast bus. 
Avoid getting a two-card setup because they really aren’t a good 
value from a power consumption perspective.
 
4. Use sites such as Tom’s Hardware (http://www.tomshardware.
com/) to research greener graphics cards.
 
 Read the specifications carefully. Look for evidence of energy efficiency 
(even if only by comparison) as you investigate the power consumption 
of the cards you consider. Make sure you compare cards equally. Some 
vendors will try to make their cards sound more efficient by quoting the 
idle power requirements, rather than the peak power requirements. 
Sites such as Tom’s Hardware often report both specifications so that 
you can make a good comparison.
Figure 5-1 shows the ATI Radeon X1650 XT graphics adapter, which the 
manufacturer touts as great for gaming and home theatre enthusiasts. AMD, 
the makers of the card, offer Cool ’n’ Quiet technology that focuses on reduc-
ing power consumption and costs and increasing the green factor for all the 
company’s processors.

specs, when

sidering a

card, to find 
out about its 
energy-
consumption 
habits.
 
After you have your new graphics card in hand, you need to perform the fol-
lowing steps to replace the card:
 
1. Make sure your machine is shut off.
 
2. Open the case and discharge any static electricity by touching the 
power supply case.
 
 Static electricity can damage your system and will definitely damage 
your new card. If you move, then you must discharge any static electric-
ity generated by the move.

92
Part II: Choosing Your Green PC Path 
 
3. Locate the current graphics card.
 
 You can determine which card is the graphics card by looking for the 
monitor connector.
 
4. Disconnect any monitor cables from the card.
 
5. Unscrew the case screw that holds the graphics card in place.
 
 Some cases don’t have screws — they may use a lever or other hold 
down method. The point is to make sure you can remove the card with-
out damaging anything.
 
6. Pull the old card straight out of the case.
 
 You may need to wiggle the card just a bit to get it to move. At no time 
should you need to exert more than a little force to remove the card. If 
you’re wrestling with the machine, stop now! Look for a screw or other 
hold down and remove it.
 
7. Carefully line up the new card and gently press it in place.
 
 Pushing the card hard can damage the gossamer pins used to connect 
the graphics card to the motherboard. These pins are very tiny and easy 
to damage. Gentle handling prevents damage to the motherboard or 
your card.
 
8. Make sure the new graphics card is fully seated in the slot and replace 
any screws used to hold the old card in place.
 
 If you encounter any difficulties, make sure you double-check the place-
ment of the graphics card. It should seat fully in the slot without any 
coercion.
 
9. Reconnect the monitor cables.
 
10. Turn on your system and verify that you can see the system boot.
 
 There isn’t any need to log into the operating system — in fact, it’s 
better if you don’t at this point. Simply verify that the system will boot 
and that you can see something onscreen.
 
11. Shut the system down.
 
 Make sure you perform a normal shutdown and don’t simply turn off the 
power switch. You don’t want to damage your operating system setup.
 
12. Replace the case cover.
 
 You’re ready to begin using that new card.
 
13. Follow any vendor software instructions for your operating system.

93
 Chapter 5: Giving Your Computer a Green Makeover
 
 The custom drivers provided by the vendor will always outperform 
generic drivers supplied by the operating system vendor. You don’t nec-
essarily need to install all the add-on software, however. The add-on 
software adds nice functionality, but often consumes power by keeping 
your computer churning away whenever you stop typing.
Adding Memory without Ginseng
You may or may not realize it, but your computer is constantly working, 
processing, chewing, and running data to and from various components and 
peripheral devices every nanosecond it’s in use. Whether you press a key on 
the keyboard, adjust the brightness on your monitor, or build a complicated 
Excel spreadsheet, your computer’s RAM (random access memory) stores 
the programs and data you need to keep things moving forward.
If you’ve ever worked on a system that didn’t have enough RAM, you prob-
ably remember what happened. You pressed Page Down to move through 
your spreadsheet — and waited while your monitor repainted the screen. 
Or you opened a demanding program like Photoshop and tried to be patient 
while the program window appeared, one toolbar, one panel at a time.
Back in the personal computer stone age, people flipped out if they were able 
to get their hands on a system that had 256K (that’s kilobytes) of random 
access memory for programs and data. Today, the RAM recommendation 
for Windows Vista and Windows 7 is 1GB, and it’s not unusual to find 4GB of 
RAM already installed on a new computer. (That’s gigabytes, or 1,600 times 
the RAM of yesteryear.)
Adding more RAM to your machine enables it to keep up with the increas-
ing demands that software programs place on a computer, enabling you to 
continue using the computer. Adding RAM also reduces the amount of energy 
your computer consumes because it won’t be forever churning away, paging 
through programs and data, trying to swap important things in and out of 
the available memory space. You’ll have less time to wait (which means 
shorter time spans at the computer — while you get more done!) and overall 
a smoother PC experience. Harmony for both you and your PC. Nice.
Finding out how much memory you have
All you have to do is look around your local coffee shop and you know: Not 
all computers are created equal. When your computer was made, the type of 
model it is, and the types of applications you run on it all have something to 

94
Part II: Choosing Your Green PC Path 
do with how much memory came with the system and how much you need to 
run it well now.
You can find out how much memory is already in your Windows Vista system 
by following these steps:
 
1. Click Start and right-click Computer.
 
 A menu appears. (See Figure 5-2.)
 
Figure 5-2: 
Checking 
out your 
computer’s 
short-term 
memory.
 
 
2. Select Properties.
 
 The System Properties window appears. (See Figure 5-3.) The System 
area shows you your computer’s system rating (this is a Windows Vista 
thing) and then lists your processor, the amount of memory installed in 
your system, and the system type (whether you’re running a 32-bit or 
64-bit version of the operating system).
Obviously, the memory number is what you need most here (although the 
processor information is important, too). Write down anything you don’t 
think you’ll be able to store in your own internal memory (that is, your head), 

95
 Chapter 5: Giving Your Computer a Green Makeover
and take a look online to see what upgrade options are available for your 
system. Find out the amount of RAM on your Mac by clicking the Apple Menu 
and choosing About This Computer.

Still got the manual that came with your computer? This is one of those situa-
tions when having the manual can actually help. Chances are, it provides a 
diagram of the mysterious inner workings of your system (which can come in 
handy later), and it may also give you a clue about the kind of memory mod-
ules to look for when you begin to search online.
32-bit, 64-bit, six bits, a dollar
What do these numbers mean, why do they 
matter, and should you try to change them? Yes, 
these phrases sound like cryptic codes that 
people in the know whisper to each other when 
James Bond walks in the room. The simple 
answer is in raw data processing power.
A bit of information, in computer-speak, is a 
binary digit. And in binary, there are only two 
possible digits: 0 and 1. (You’ve probably heard 
this before, in the Annals of Computing History 
course you took in middle school.) Early, on, 
computer microprocessors were capable of 
chewing up and spitting out information using 
32-bit processing (with numbers representing 
values from 0 to 4,294,967,295), but today, 64-bit 
microprocessors and operating systems can 
double the processing power, which means 
faster processing and bigger talent for calcu-
lations, databases, design, and more. 

96
Part II: Choosing Your Green PC Path 
Finding your computer’s memory type
 
Here’s an important point about adding memory: You need to get the RAM 
that’s right for your system and processor. The motherboard manual that 
comes with your system will tell you what kind of memory to get and the size 
memory (in MB) that your system will accept. If you don’t have a motherboard 
manual, try to locate one on the vendor Web site. Some third party Web sites, 
such as Technibble (http://www.technibble.com/types-of-ram-how-
to-identify-and-their-specifications/), tell you about memory 
types as well. To make sure you’re ordering the right module, follow these 
general steps:
 
1. Write down the make and model number or name of the system to 
which you want to add memory. If there’s a user account ID or item 
number label on the system, write that down, too.
 
 In fact, write these items down in a notebook you keep with your com-
puter, if you’re not doing that already. They will come in handy when 
you begin shopping for the upgrades you need.
 
2. Start by searching your manufacturer’s Web site. Enter something 
obvious, like memory upgrade.
 
 Depending on who made your computer system, you may have the 
option to log in and let the site’s database tell you what your system is 
capable of and how much room you have to add memory. Dell offers a 
nice feature that lets you do a system scan live on the site, or enter a 
service code. (It’s somewhere on the side or bottom of your computer.) 
The site tells you what kinds of upgrades are possible for that system. 
(See Figure 5-4.)
 
Note that your laptop looks a little different inside — and of course, it’s more 
compact — but the general process still applies. In any case, find out about 
any specific instructions your computer manufacturer offers on adding 
memory before you begin dismantling things and plugging new stuff in.
If your computer doesn’t have an available slot for a new memory card, you’ll 
need to replace one of the memory cards you already have with an increased 
amount of memory. For the best energy savings, use one memory module 
with more memory instead of two modules with smaller amounts of memory.

Adding memory
The actual process of adding memory to your computer is easier than it 
sounds. Be sure to check your system documentation (or search online) for 
any techniques that are related specifically to your own computer model. But 
here’s the general process:
 
1. Turn off and unplug your computer, and remove any attached cables.
 
 It’s important to remove all cables from the unit and move it out where 
you can open the cover easily.
 
2. Open the case so you can see the inside of the computer.
 
 Your computer cover may have small thumbscrews holding the cover 
on at the corners or back; you may also need a small Phillips screw-
driver or be required to push or slide a small plastic button to release 
the cover. Check the manual if you aren’t sure.

98
Part II: Choosing Your Green PC Path 
 
3. Ground yourself by touching a metal part of the cover or back of the 
system.
 
 This discharges any static electricity safely.
 
4. Locate the memory slots on the motherboard.
 
 You’ll see several slots together, with a small white clips on each end. 
Depending on your system’s capabilities, you may see memory modules 
already in the slots.
 
5. (Optional) To remove a memory card, gently press down on the 
plastic clips.
 
 Remember, you need to remove an existing memory card only if you’re 
replacing it with a card with more memory.
 
 The clips open outward and you can lift the memory module out.
 
6. Insert the new memory module by turning it to align with the connec-
tors on the bottom of the card.
 
 A small divider shows you how to align the module before you press the 
memory into place.
 
7. Press the module gently into the slot.
 
 When seated properly, the module snaps into place, and the clips close.
 
8. Put the case cover back on, connect the power cable, and reconnect 
the peripherals — monitor, keyboard, mouse, router, and printer.
 
9. Turn the power on and check your system properties.
 
 Did it take? Congratulations! (If not, take everything apart and do it all 
again. Chances are that the memory module isn’t seated properly.)

here, but for more information, check out this basic introduction to all things

What’s a Terabyte among Friends?
Adding a hard drive or replacing the one you’ve got can be considered a 
green upgrade if you find a unit, made with non-toxic materials, that offers a 
low-energy solution. The list of vendors providing such a thing is still pretty 
short, but there are a few contenders. We expect the list to continue to grow.
Western Digital’s Caviar GP hard drive fits this bill, providing a 3.5-inch hard 
disk available in capacities up to a terabyte (TB). (Doesn’t that just blow your 
mind? That means 12 zeros.) To take a closer look, you can visit Western

Computers are generally tolerant of hard drives when it comes to size. 
Replacing a 100 GB drive with a 200 GB drive of the same type usually won’t 
cause problems. In addition, the computer doesn’t care how fast the disk 
spins. A disk that spins at 7,500-RPM works just as well as a drive that spins at 
10,000-RPM, but the 10,000-RPM drive will access data faster. However, you do 
need to consider the kind of interface the hard drive supports. Your mother-
board manual should tell you what kinds of interface it provides. The most 
popular interfaces are:
 
✓ Integrated Drive Electronics (IDE)
 
✓ Extended Integrated Drive Electronics (EIDE)
 
✓ Serial Advanced Technology Attachment (SATA)
 
✓ Small Computer System Interface (SCSI)
In some cases, a motherboard will support multiple interfaces. For example, 
ASUS makes some motherboards that support both EIDE and SATA drives. 
The EIDE drives provide average performance and low cost. You generally 
add these drives one at a time. The SATA drives offer higher performance 
and redundancy that enhances system reliability. However, you normally add 
SATA drives in groups, so they consume more power and cost more.
You can also add an external hard drive and share it among different 
computers — in your house or wherever you go. It can serve as a backup 
unit or as an easy way to add storage capacity. The SimpleTech [re]drive 
(see Figure 5-5) is a beautiful, energy-efficient external hard drive that’s made 
with a potentially earth-friendly material: bamboo! The drive is designed to 
turn off automatically when your computer isn’t in use. It works via Turbo 
USB 2.0 with both Macs and PCs, and it comes with 2GB of free online 
backup. Find out more at www.simpletech.com.

You can recycle an existing hard drive you don’t want any more by using 
Gazelle (www.gazelle.com). This site pays cash for all kinds of gadgets — 
not just hard drives — which you can then donate to green causes, put into 
carbon offsets, or put back into your own checking account.
Improving Your Laptop Battery
Rechargeable batteries for your MP3 player, game controllers, and various 
other devices have been around for years, but green batteries for laptops 
are something new. I know what you’re thinking — my laptop has always had 
a battery, so it must be green. Older laptop batteries can have hazardous 
chemicals in them such as lead, so they aren’t green. A green laptop battery 
often relies on lithium-ion technology. It holds a charge longer and fades less 
over time so that you replace the battery far less often. Fade is a term that 
describes the gradual failure of the battery — you get four hours of comput-
ing time from it today, but by tomorrow you only get three hours. Eventually, 
the fade effect means the battery won’t hold a charge and you must replace 
it. Longer charges mean you need fewer batteries for your business trip and 
less fade means fewer total batteries over the life of the laptop.
An environmentally friendly laptop battery has the following features:
 
✓ It’s made and packed with earth friendliness in mind. Of course, the 
big thing is that the battery doesn’t contain hazardous chemicals such 
as lead. Most green batteries today rely on lithium-ion technology, but 
look for new technologies to show up as science discovers them.
 
✓ It needs to recharge at a rate that makes it practical for computing. A 
green battery should provide you with at least four usable hours of work 
time. 
 
✓ It needs to have a lasting power that holds its own. You don’t have to 
replace the battery as often. A green battery will fade less over time — 
you should be able to use it twice as long (or more) as an old technology 
laptop battery.
 
The battery for your laptop is an extremely personal thing. Your laptop won’t 
work well with a battery that isn’t designed for it. In fact, your laptop may not 
work at all with the wrong battery — assuming that you can even connect the 
battery to the laptop. If you use the wrong battery with your laptop, you risk 
fire or other terrifying consequences as well. In short, always use batteries 
that the laptop vendor has approved for use with a particular laptop.

101
 Chapter 5: Giving Your Computer a Green Makeover
Boston-Power, a company started by Dr. Christina Lampe-Onnerud with a 
vision of a whole-system approach to portable power, has developed the 
Sonata battery that is now being offered as the HP Enviro Series batteries for 
the following laptop computer models:
 
✓ HP Pavilion (models dv4, dv5, and dv6)
 
✓ HP HDX 16
 
✓ HP G50, G60, G61, G70, and G71
 
✓ Compaq Presario (models CQ40, CQ45, CQ50, CQ60, CQ61, CQ70, 
and CQ71)
The new Sonata battery (called the HP Enviro) promises like-new functionality 
for three years. This means that even though traditional laptop batteries begin 
to lose capacity after only 100 to 150 charges, the Sonata continues charging 
fully like a new battery would for up to 1,000 charges (a promise HP covers by 
warranty). To find out more, go to www.boston-power.com/enviro.
Greening Your Power Supply
Your computer’s power supply is normally a silver box that appears at the 
back of the case — usually near the top or left side of the case depending on 
your case configuration. The power supply accepts alternating current (AC) 
input from an outlet in your house and outputs the direct current (DC) that 
the computer components require. DC is the same kind of power that bat-
teries output. Power supplies are rated by their wattage and special features 
they provide, such as connectors for an SLI graphics card. Not all power sup-
plies are created equal. A cheap power supply won’t last nearly as long or 
output steady power like a heavy duty one (such as those from PC Power and 
Cooling, http://www.pcpower.com/index.html). Steady power output is 
important because it helps your computer components work more efficiently, 
use less power, and last longer. If your power supply is inefficient, upgrading 
it can be a very green move and maximize your energy savings. 
 
Changing out the power supply in your system requires a little more than a 
“How-do-I-plug-this-in?” kind of mindset, so unless you’re technically inclined 
(or have a friend who runs a PC fixit shop), you may want to leave this one for 
the specialists. But power supplies do get right to the heart of the matter, and 
they can make a big impact on the amount of power your computer consumes.

102
Part II: Choosing Your Green PC Path 
Looking closer at your power supply
Most regular power supplies actually pump out more power than the com-
puter needs, and the wasted energy adds up over time — both for your elec-
tric bills and for the CO2 emissions in the atmosphere. 
So how do you know whether your computer would benefit from a power 
supply upgrade? You need to check your power supply against your usage. If 
you have a 750-watt power supply, for example, but your computer uses only 
200 watts to function, that’s a bit of overkill, which means you have room for 
a healthy reduction. Here’s how you find out these specs:
 
✓ To find the wattage of your power supply: Locate the label found on 
the top of the power supply. You must open the case to see this label.
 
✓ To find out how many watts your computer uses: Create a list of the 
components that your computer contains and their individual peak 
wattages. Add all the wattages together. Never use the idle power watt-
ages for components in your computer or you could overload the power 
supply during peak power usage.
Finding an efficient power supply
One way you can find an environmentally friendly power supply is to refer-
ence the 80 PLUS program (find more information at www.80plus.org), 
which connects you with manufacturers who offer smart power supplies 
(those that deliver only the current needed by the system). For example, if 
you’re surfing the Web on an 80 PLUS-certified computer and it needs only a 
little power, it draws only a little. If you’re running a graphics-intensive game 
and the system needs a lot of power, it draws a lot. Knowing how to accom-
modate the system’s different needs makes all the difference between blast-
ing power at full force (and wasting it) and using it wisely, which is better for 
the planet and your checkbook. 
All power supplies in the 80 PLUS program also are lead-free and manufac-
tured without other toxic substances. You can read through the list of manu-
facturers and see how each model rates — Bronze, Silver, or Gold — for both 
individual use and data center applications. (See Figure 5-6.)

T
his chapter helps you cover the essentials that lead up to that green 
purchase — and tells you what, exactly, a green computer is and how 
to know when you find one. We give you reliable information (sans le green-
washing, or deceptive marketing) that you can use to make choices. In addi-
tion, we highlight some specific new green computers and examine how the 
old standby manufacturers (Dell, Apple, and more) are focusing on develop-
ing greener systems.
Computer manufacturers today would have to be crazy to ignore the green 
opportunity rippling around the world. With green buzz, green jobs, green 
marketing, green initiatives, green advocacy, and yes, some major green-
washing jobs, you can be sure that focusing on the green (environmental 
issues) is foremost in manufacturer’s minds. The challenges are manyfold: 
Creating energy-efficient, earth-friendly, affordable systems that are made 
from earth-friendly (non-toxic) materials, with sustainable lives of longer 
than three years.
Fortunately, some manufacturers are rising to the challenge. This chapter 
helps you take a look at what’s out there right now so that you have a place 
to start as you research your own growing green initiative. Because green 
options are growing exponentially these days, this chapter is intended as 
only a starting point — use it as a springboard for your own research into 
manufacturers that pique your interest.

106
Part II: Choosing Your Green PC Path 
So You Decided to Make a 
Purchase, Hmmm?
Who doesn’t like to buy something new? You’re not alone, with your flushed 
cheeks and your accelerating heart rate. You keep glancing at ads. You want 
to show your friends. You play out different scenarios in your head, trying to 
come up with just the right argument that will help you get what you want.
It’s a little like falling in love, isn’t it?
We’ve all been there. And even though the big purchases are especially excit-
ing, green computing would have you do your best to set aside the romance 
factor and get what you really need, and only what you really need, and make 
it last.
Understanding what makes 
a computer green
Your first question, as you begin to investigate all the different ways you can 
reduce your impact on the environment by revisiting the way you use your 
computer, might be “What makes a computer green, anyway?” You want to 
check out the manufacturer as well as the computer itself.
When you start to shop (and you will), look for the following clues to the 
manufacturer’s dedication to earth-friendly initiatives (or lack of them):
 
✓ Search the manufacturer’s Web site to see whether the company has 
any kind of green policy.
 
✓ Consult green buying guides to find out where the system or manufac-
turer rates. (We point you to a few of these later in this chapter.)
In terms of the computer itself, check for the following:
 
✓ Look for the Energy Star logo. We introduce Energy Star in Chapter 3.
 
✓ Find out how much energy the computer uses. Any peripherals, such as 
a printer, and the monitor, have their energy usage stamped in a panel 
on the back of the unit. The advertisements you read normally contain 
this information as well. The energy used by the computer itself is a 
little harder to determine. The power supply rating tells you the maxi-
mum the computer will use. If a computer has a 300 watt power supply, 

107
 Chapter 6: Buying a Green Computer
it can’t use more than 300 watts of power. However, most computers 
use only about half of the power that the power supply can provide. The 
exact amount of power that the computer uses depends on the compo-
nents you place inside the box and what activities you perform (playing 
a game typically requires more power than writing a letter because the 
graphics card is working harder, as is the hard drive, during game play).
 
✓ Look for information that tells you how the system is made (including 
the materials used in manufacturing). In some cases, you see a label 
attached to the device that tells you about its manufacture. More com-
monly, you must ferret out the information by checking the vendor Web 
site. For example, Hewlett-Packard publishes its hazardous material 
use policy at http://www.hp.com/hpinfo/globalcitizenship/
environment/productdesign/materialuse.html. You want to 
avoid devices that include lead in them and most vendors are already 
addressing this problem metal. In addition, you want to avoid comput-
ers that contain mercury, Brominated Flame Retardants (BFR), Polyvinyl 
Chloride (PVC), cadmium, hexavalent chromium, Polybrominated 
Biphenyl (PBB), and Pentabromodiphenyl Ether (PBDE). Wow, what 
a nasty chemical soup! The European Union Restriction of Hazardous 
Substances (RoHS) directive (http://www.rohs.gov.uk/) is a good 
place to look for additional information.
 
✓ See whether the system supports power management. For in-depth 
look at power management, flip to Chapter 8.
Deciding what green means to you
We don’t think a one-size-fits-all solution works for computer purchases, let 
alone green purchases. Viva la difference! Instead, we suggest you consider 
what green means to you and then make your purchase accordingly.
It’s important to consider your skills when determining what approach to 
take for green computing. Many people have no idea what goes into the com-
puter case and really don’t want to know. Even if you dislike the very thought 
of working directly with hardware, you can still buy an Energy Star computer 
and obtain many benefits of green computing.
Some people really do like working with hardware, but lack detailed knowl-
edge of how to put a computer together. In this case, buying a computer that 
is almost bare-bones (no, we don’t mean you can see the motherboard) may 
be the greenest possible option. You can choose the individual components 
that you feel comfortable working with and ensure they all provide great 
power usage and lack harmful chemicals.

108
Part II: Choosing Your Green PC Path 
A few people know all about computer systems and don’t even mind wielding 
a soldering iron should the need arise. If you fall into this category, you can 
buy custom components that not only meet green computing requirements, 
but also perform well. You can have a hotrod computer without hurting the 
environment. 
No matter what your experience level, you do need to think about the pur-
chases you make. The following list tells you a few of the things you should 
think about when making component purchases.
 
✓ Consider the power consumption of all the components (or even entire 
systems) that you’re thinking about purchasing — and choose the most 
efficient.
 
✓ Buy all Energy Star-recommended equipment. (This is easy and makes a 
good minimum green effort.)
 
✓ Select a system with good power management features.
 
✓ Add a smart meter that remembers to turn off peripherals when you 
forget. (See Chapter 18 for details on working with smart meters.)
Matching a computer to your needs
Investigating what you really need in a computer, and then using that to 
guide your purchasing decision is another way to keep your new buy in the 
green zone. Sure, the temptation is to get the fastest, most powerful and inno-
vative model on the showroom floor. But is that really what you need? How 
often do you play games that require a 750-watt power supply? Will a honking 
30-inch monitor really make those Word documents you write any better? 
 
The following list helps you think through the types of things you actually do 
with your computer (granted, with room to grow) so that as you start shop-
ping you have a general sense of what you need and what is enormous over-
kill. Write down how many minutes per day or per week you typically do the 
following activities with you computer:
 
✓ E-mail
 
✓ Shop online
 
✓ Browse Web sites
 
✓ Use social networking sites and blogs
 
✓ Create, edit, and format documents
 
✓ Work with spreadsheets

109
 Chapter 6: Buying a Green Computer
 
✓ Maintain a database
 
✓ Design Web sites
 
✓ Use photo editing software
 
✓ Listen to music
 
✓ Watch video
 
✓ Playing graphics-intensive video games
 
✓ Other ____________________________
Many people don’t actually know how long they perform various activities. If 
you fall into this group, create a log that lists the time you start the activity, 
the time you stop, the name of the activity, and the minutes you spend doing 
it. Track your activities during a typical week. At the end of the week, total 
the minutes spent performing each activity. With your list in hand, compare 
what you do most often or the activities that are most important to you with 
the specs outlined in Table 6-1.

Part II: Choosing Your Green PC Path 
Table 6-1 provides guidelines, not absolutes. You need to review the speci-
fications for the particular software you want to use. In some cases, the 
specifications for software vary by a number of factors, such as the operating 
system you use. Vendors usually make the information you need available 
to ensure you have a great computing experience. For example, you can see 
the specifications for Open Office at http://www.openoffice.org/dev_
docs/source/sys_reqs_30.html. When you look at this Web site, you 
see that the specifications for Open Office vary by operating system, so you 
need to know which operating system your machine uses as part of determin-
ing how much memory and hard drive capacity you need.
So, how much of everything do you actually need? The following sections 
explain how to pull all this information together.
Memory
Memory is additive. Let’s say you want to run your word processor, e-mail 
program, and Web browser at the same time. You need to add the amount of 
RAM for the word processor, e-mail program, and Web browser together. In 
addition, you need to add memory for the operating system and some addi-
tional memory (I usually add 50 percent more) for data. To make this exam-
ple real, let’s say we’re using Windows XP Professional, which requires 128 
MB RAM minimum according to the Web site at http://www.microsoft.
com/windowsxp/sysreqs/pro.mspx. You end up with these memory 
requirements:
  Word processor:  
512 MB
+ E-mail program:  
256 MB
+ Web browser:  
64 MB
+ Operating system:  
128 MB
= Minimum total:  
960 MB
+ 50% additional:  
480 MB
= Safe total:  
1,440 MB or 1.4 GB
Of course, you only need 1.4 GB if you plan to perform all the tasks at the 
same time. It’s important to know what tasks you’ll perform together and 
then use the maximum number when buying your computer.
Processor
Processor speed isn’t additive. You need a processor that meets the mini-
mum requirements for the most processor intensive software you use. Using 
the example of a word processor, e-mail program, and Web browser again, 
you’d need a 500 MHz minimum processor. Of course, the system will slow 
down as you add tasks and eventually slow to a crawl if you add too many. 
When selecting a processor, I normally choose one that is twice the speed of 
what I need or 1 GHz in this case.

111
 Chapter 6: Buying a Green Computer
Hard drive space
Hard drive space is tricky. The specifications you see for software don’t 
include any space for the data you create. Realistically, vendors don’t have 
any way to tell you that number. To obtain a ballpark number, add the values 
of all the software you intend to install (whether or not you plan to use it at 
the same time — applications and data use hard drive space even when you 
aren’t using them) and then multiply by five. Using the previous example 
again, you get these numbers.
  Word processor:  
1.5 GB
+ E-mail program:  
1.5 GB
+ Web browser:  
52 MB
+ Operating system:  
1.5 GB
= Minimum total:  
4.6 GB
= Safe total:  
23 GB
 
Many vendors try to make their software look more attractive by providing 
minimum and recommended requirements. Always use the recommended 
requirements as your minimum value. The minimum values produce an envi-
ronment where the software just barely works — it’s unusable really. In addi-
tion, vendors often sneak all kinds of other requirements in. For example, 
check out the Nero (a product for creating and playing both music and video 
disks) system requirements at http://www.nero.com/eng/support-
nero7-system-requirements.html. You immediately notice that you 
have to have Internet Explorer 6 or above (which means adding the require-
ments for running this software to your list), some special hardware, and 
operating system updates. In addition, you have to have 9 GB additional hard 
drive space to work with DVDs. Read all of the fine print before you decide on 
the hardware requirements for your system.
Researching Your Options
Now that companies know that green sells, you don’t have to go very far to 
find manufacturers pitching their green computers. In fact, you can sit in 
your easy chair in the family room, and Apple will come through your televi-
sion, telling you that it has the greenest family of laptops on the planet. If you 
open your e-mail inbox, you’re likely to get a message from another computer 
company — maybe Dell — sharing its green vision and telling you that its 
committed to being the greenest computer manufacturer on the planet.
Okay, bring it on.
The great race for green isn’t a bad thing. If you’re voting with your dollars 
(and you are) and manufacturers know it, their development of ever-greener 

112
Part II: Choosing Your Green PC Path 
technologies (in competition for your business) will ultimately lead to better 
and better systems that have a smaller impact on the planet.
That is, of course, if their systems do what they say they will do.
In this section, you find out how to wade through all the promises and the 
hype and know you’re getting a good green system. Here are a few guidelines 
to get you started, and we explore these in more detail in the sections that 
follow:
 
✓ Do your homework. Just because a company says it’s green, prints a 
cleverly designed, natural-looking label, and goes to a couple of green 
conferences doesn’t make it green. (In the next section, we show you 
how to do the due diligence to make sure you’re not getting green-
washed by a manufacturer that has learned to walk, talk, and quack like 
it’s green.)
 
✓ Check for a seal of approval. Any manufacturer or shopping site worth 
its carbon offset will show that its product has qualified as an energy-
efficient offering by proudly displaying two standard achievements: 
an Energy Star qualification and Electronic Product Environmental 
Assessment Tool (EPEAT) rating. The Climate Counts rating is another 
one to check if you’re looking to reduce your carbon footprint. (We dis-
cuss carbon footprints and tips to clean them up in Chapter 2.)
 
✓ Go for the numbers. Look for quantifiable evidence that the system 
does what the manufacturer promises. Look at things like wattage, 
battery life, cooling mechanisms, and power supply measurements. 
Compare the numbers with the same numbers on other systems — and 
families of systems. See “Matching a computer to your needs” earlier in 
this chapter for help sorting through the specs.
 
✓ Ask around. Search online for user reviews and ratings to give you a 
“real people” sense of how green the computer really is. Chances are, 
you’ll find reviews for and against — and you’ll need to wade through 
the opinions, flames, and blind loyalties people sometimes develop to 
one computer company or another. 
Because so much of a purchase like this can be based on gut and sex appeal 
(come on; admit it), it helps to do all your homework, research various sys-
tems, and gather your info before you make a choice. The following sections 
guide you through the research process. 
Cutting through the greenwashing
Greenwashing is representing a product as environmentally friendly when it 
really isn’t. When a company greenwashes its products — whether it’s mar-
keting laundry detergent, automobiles, or power supplies — it attempts to 

113
 Chapter 6: Buying a Green Computer
appeal to your good intentions and sell you a product with a false promise. 
The company might lead you to believe that its product is made with earth-
friendly materials, designed to consume less energy, or that it otherwise sup-
ports eco-responsible practices.
 
The majority of the companies you purchase green products from are doing 
what they say, thank goodness — doing their best to reduce and reuse, while 
creating products from safer materials that last a long time (and use less 
energy). But it’s important to be able to sniff out the green paint fumes when 
the less reputable companies come along. If you catch a whiff of these kinds of 
things, steer clear:
 
✓ Green colors on the package, but no clear statement that the prod-
uct benefits the planet, was produced from renewable or nontoxic 
resources, or uses less energy
 
✓ Claims of energy efficiency but no numbers to back them up
 
✓ No information available on specific tests related to energy consumption
 
✓ No Energy Star logo (on products that Energy Star reviews)
 
✓ No green policy or initiative
If you’re unsure about the legitimate greenness of a company you’re consid-
ering buying from, check out the company’s partners, as well as its paper 
trail. Who does it donate to? Where do its employees volunteer? Does it have 
a green policy posted on its Web site?
Chances are, if you don’t see evidence of green initiatives in the company’s 
portfolio, there’s a good reason: It’s greenwashing its products.
Climate Counts for you and me
Want a quick way to see which companies really make green efforts? 
ClimateCounts.org is a non-profit organization that scores companies on a 
three-part scale, with a 0–100-point scale that provides additional detail.
 
✓ Stuck: Companies with this rating haven’t gotten with the green pro-
gram. (And Climate Counts suggests you avoid purchasing their prod-
ucts until they get moving.)
 
✓ Starting: These companies are making a green effort. (And the additional 
scores that the Web site provides show you how much progress they’ve 
made.)
 
✓ Striding: This rating identifies companies that are really making the 
grade and starting to pull away from the pack. (Use your purchasing dol-
lars to reward their efforts and encourage their progress.)

114
Part II: Choosing Your Green PC Path 
ClimateCounts.org rates companies on a scale of 0–100 based on four key 
questions. Has the company
 
✓ Measured its carbon footprint?
 
✓ Done anything to reduce its contribution to global warming?
 
✓ Made any effort to support climate legislation?
 
✓ Posted its climate actions clearly where others can find them?
Based on 2008 numbers, Figure 6-1 shows the technology scorecard from

 Chapter 6: Buying a Green Computer
Let’s hear it for Energy Star
We talk about Energy Star in other places in this book, but this section shows 
you how to use the Energy Star system (as well as other resources) to shed 
some light on your upcoming green computer purchase.
Not all computers live up to Energy Star standards. Computers that are 
energy-efficient enough to display the Energy Star on the label have to
 
✓ Meet energy guidelines in three modes: Standby, Active, and Sleep.
 
✓ Have efficient internal power supplies. We introduce power supplies in 
Chapter 5.
 
✓ Offer power management features so that you can tailor the way 
energy is used on your system. Power management features are the 
focus in Chapter 9.
 
In addition to looking for the actual Energy Star logo on the computer box, you 
can search the Energy Star site to see whether a computer you’re interested in 
meets the power settings for the program. Here’s how to do that:
 
1. Go to the Energy Star site at www.energystar.gov.
 
 The Energy Star home page offers basic information for parents, kids, 
and partnering businesses.
 
2. In the Products area, click Office Equipment.
 
 The Office Equipment page displays a list of equipment choices in the 
left side of the screen.
 
3. Click Computers and scroll down to the bottom of the page.
 
 The Computers page provides you with basic information on Energy 
Star guidelines for computers and offers a search tool you can use to 
see whether the computer you’re considering buying is an Energy Star 
system. (See Figure 6-2).
 
4. Click the Product Type arrow and choose Workstation, Notebook/
Tablet, or Desktop.
 
 Chances are that for a home computer you want either Notebook/
Tablet or Desktop, but nobody’s stopping you if you want to look for a 
Workstation.
 
5. Enter the information you have on the computer.
 
 It’s not necessary to have it all — brand, processor, operating system, 
RAM, number of hard drives, storage, video card, and model name and 
number — but the more you can provide, the better.

116

6. Choose the number of results you want to be displayed on the page 
and the way in which you want the results arranged.
 
7. Click Search.
 
 After the search, you’re given the opportunity to refine the search criteria.
 
Figure 6-2: 
You can use 
the Energy

to search 
for energy-
efficient 
computers 
that meet

standard.
 
EPEAT that, will you?
The EPEAT (Electronic Product Environmental Assessment Tool) registry is 
another consumer-protection tool you can use to make sure that computer 
manufacturers who promise green really deliver the goods. 
 
When manufacturers state that their products live up to environmental stan-
dards, EPEAT evaluates products based on a set of 51 criteria; some are 
required and some are optional. After evaluating the products, each is rated 
with a Bronze, Silver, or Gold rating, determining how closely the products 
measure up to EPEAT standards.

117
 Chapter 6: Buying a Green Computer
To display the current list of products earning a Gold rating by EPEAT stan-
dards, follow these steps:
 
1. Go to www.epeat.net.
 
 The EPEAT home page provides the latest updates on the EPEAT regis-
try and offers links to new items and industry announcements.
 
2. Scroll down to the EPEAT Quick Search Tool and click the Gold 
column head.
 
 A listing of all qualifying Gold products appears. (See Figure 6-3.) You 
can sort the list by product name, type, listing date, or status by clicking 
the appropriate column heading.
 
Want to save the list for later? You can export the list by clicking Export to 
Excel or Export to CSV. In the pop-up box that appears, navigate to the folder 
where you want to store the file and click OK.
 
Figure 6-3: 
The EPEAT 
registry lists 
all products 
that meet 
Bronze, 
Silver, and 
Gold stan-
dards for 
electronics 
equipment.
 
The EPEAT Registry is helpful for more than simply finding the computer 
models that measure up to environmental standards. You can also easily 
compare models so that you can see how each computer measures up toe-to-
toe (metaphorically speaking). Here’s how to do that:

118
Part II: Choosing Your Green PC Path 
 
1. On the EPEAT site (www.epeat.net), click the icon of the standard 
you want to view (Bronze, Silver, or Gold).
 
2. On the product listing page, select the check box in the right column 
for any computer model you want to use in your comparison. 
 
 There are a couple of things to keep in mind:
 
• You can compare only three items at a time.
 
• You must choose products within the same type (for example, all 
notebooks or all desktop computers).
 
3. After you choose the models you want to compare, scroll down to the 
bottom of the list and click Compare Products.
 
 The resulting page lists the products you selected and shows their 
results for each of the optional criteria in the EPEAT standard. You can 
review the list and determine which model of those compared best fits 
your idea of a truly green computer.
 
Export your product comparison to CSV or Excel format by clicking the appro-
priate link at the top of the results page. That way you can refer to the report 
later when you’re doing some online shopping for that new green computer.
Using green buying guides
Lots of people want to make your computer shopping easier, especially if 
you’re in the market for good green products. In addition to the standards 
designed to give consumers a reliable way to find dependable and truly green 
electronics, a number of sites offer green buying guides to help consumers 
(that’s you) learn what they need to know before buying.
This section introduces you to a few of the buying guides that can help you 
find out more about the computer(s) you’re considering bringing home to be 
part of the family.
Check out the Daily Green
The Daily Green (www.thedailygreen.com) isn’t actually a downloadable, 
printable guide per se. (It’s not the greenest thing in the world to print a 
bunch of pages anyway — unless you really need them.) The tagline on the 
site is “the consumer’s guide to the green revolution,” and the site offers you 
the latest information on product recalls, green living, do-it-yourself green 
projects, and more.
The section Green Products A to Z provides product profiles and reviews on 
lifestyle products. You’ll find a few green tech items scattered in there, too.

119
 Chapter 6: Buying a Green Computer
TreeHugger Guides
TreeHugger.com is one of those green sites that will continue to pull you 
back in for more earth-friendly info on all kinds of things ranging from green 
science to cars to fashion to computing. It offers a number of buying guides 
for your gadgetry and provides a little background info (and links, as well). 
Here’s how to get TreeHugger buying guidance:
 
1. Go to www.treehugger.com.
 
2. In the Take Action column, click Green Buying Guides (or go directly 
to www.treehugger.com/buygreen).
 
 A page of buying guides meets your eager gaze. Here, you’ll find all the 
TreeHugger hand-picked favorites for green stuff you’re considering.
 
3. Scroll down to the guide you want to see, and click it.
 
 You’ll find buying guides for laptop computers and desktop computers, 
but you might want to take a look at the desks and chairs, too, while 
you’re at it.
 
One caveat, though; some of the TreeHugger guides are in need of updating, 
so you may be looking at older reviews. Whatever you find there, be sure to 
check the numbers with EPEAT and look up the latest versions available by 
visiting the manufacturer’s site.
Listening for the green buzz
Another way you can make sure you’re getting the straight scoop on the 
green capabilities of the features you’re considering is to read user ratings 
and reviews. The question-and-answer format abounds online. On many sites, 
you can post a question, respond to other peoples’ questions and reviews, or 
just browse to see what others are saying. This section offers a smattering of 
sites where you can benefit from the shared knowledge of other earth-loving 
computer users.
 
✓ Yahoo! Answers (www.answers.yahoo.com) enables you to easily ask, 
answer, and gather points for sharing your expertise in greendom. This 
is kind of “mass consciousness meets gamerland,” in a social networking 
environment that enables you to gather cred points and cash them in for 
new levels. We like it because you can get real opinions of real people — 
who, um, use avatars.
 
✓ LinkedIn (www.linkedin.com) is another social networking site used 
in large part for professional purposes. After you sign up and log in, you 
can ask other users questions in the Answers section (and respond to 
others’ questions as well). To find the green topics, click Answers at the 
top of the screen, click the Sustainability category, and choose Green 
Products.

120
Part II: Choosing Your Green PC Path 
 
✓ Epinions.com is a site that collects and shares user reviews on a variety 
of topics, including green tech. Go to www.epinions.com and click the 
Computers & Software tab. In the Find and Compare area, click the type 
of computer you want to know more about (such as PC Desktop or Mac 
Laptop) and then click to see all reviews in the category you want to see. 
 
 You can also narrow the search to a specific computer model by typing 
the model name in the Search For box and selecting the category before 
clicking Search.
 
✓ Amazon.com is another source of great user reviews, and the computer 
comparisons enable you to view a variety of systems side by side, fea-
ture to feature. (The computer comparisons appear when you perform a 
search, such as all desktop computers or all computers from Apple.) 
Checking Out Small, Green, 
Niche Computers
Although any computer manufacturer worth its salt currently offers (or is 
developing) greener systems, here are a few systems you might not find out 
about with all the Dell-Apple-HP-Lenovo-Sony messaging in the atmosphere. 
This section tells you the stories of a few computers you’ll find off the more 
traveled paths.
Fujitsu’s Esprimo Green PC
In March 2009, Fujitsu announced at CeBIT (the world’s largest trade show 
for the digital IT and telecommunications industries) a new zero-watt series 
of PCs called ESPRIMO Green (http://ts.fujitsu.com/products/
deskbound/personal_computers/epa.html). The new desktop comput-
ers will be available in three models (C, E, and Q) and will use earth-friendly 
materials and an environmentally sound production process.
In Standby mode, the zero-watt PC won’t consume any energy at all, but you 
can still return it to normal operation in a snap. Expect to see more of this 
kind of wonder-working in the future. This computer meets the new Energy 
Star 4.0 requirements.
The CherryPal Bing
Imagine a world in which costs are low, systems are light, and everything’s 
green. CherryPal develops Linux-based green computers (which are capable 

121
 Chapter 6: Buying a Green Computer
of running Windows XP, as well) that keep the footprint small, your budget 
manageable, and your power consumption minimal. This company is rela-
tively new on the computing scene, having been established July 21, 2008. 
However, they have received more than a few accolades in the press. Read 
more about this company at http://www.cherrypal.com/news.html.
The CherryPal Bing is a netbook that offers all the features you want for Web 
browsing and connecting with friends and family around the globe. A netbook 
is a subnotebook computer in the $200 to $400 range and originally referred 
to Intel computers that used the Atom processor. However, many vendors 
now describe their small computers as netbooks.
CherryPal also builds in a cloud computing (performing computing tasks 
through the Internet, rather than through a local server) component so you 
can do more intensive processing tasks as well. Check out CherryPal at www.
cherrypal.com. (See Figure 6-4.) The vendor doesn’t tell whether this com-
puter meets Energy Star or EPEAT Gold requirements.
 
Figure 6-4:

fit-PC: You’ve gotta see it to believe it
Okay, talk about your small footprint! The fit-PC (www.fit-pc.com) is a tiny 
hold-in-the-palm-of-your-hand computer that is available in both Windows 
and Linux versions. The manufacturers say the Windows XP version (called 
the fit-PC Slim XP) is good for e-mail and instant messaging, Web browsing, 
running Microsoft Office applications (we may have to get one just to test 
this), music storage and playback, and the good, old-fashioned family room 
PC used for movie downloads and the like. With a system unit barely bigger 

122
Part II: Choosing Your Green PC Path 
than your car keys, this is hard to believe! But with 4- to 6-watt power con-
sumption and a retail of just over $300 (U.S., for the XP version), it might be 
worth a serious look. The vendor doesn’t tell whether this computer meets 
Energy Star or EPEAT Gold requirements.
Making Your Purchase
If you do your computer-shopping research using a variety of tools, you’ll 
probably discover the make and model of the computer that best meets your 
needs — and the environment’s. You can purchase the computer through 
any traditional sales outlets — drive to stores like Best Buy, Comp USA, or 
the bricks-and-mortar Apple stores. Or you can order from any number of 
online retailers (including Amazon.com, of course, as well as the sites of all 
the physical stores we just listed).
 
To reduce the almost unlimited variety of online sales outlets you can choose 
from, you may want to go with one of two sales sites that are recommended 
by EPEAT: Buy.com and TechDepot.com. Both sites are in partnership with 
EPEAT and use the EPEAT ratings — Bronze, Silver, and Gold — to help you 
find the computer you want. Figure 6-5 shows the EPEAT page of Buy.com.
 
Figure 6-5: 
EPEAT Gold, 
Silver, and

systems are

Buy.com.
 

123
 Chapter 6: Buying a Green Computer
 
Or consider whether you can buy the computer you want as a refurbished 
system. This may not be the sexiest option, but it’s probably the greenest. 
Many computer manufacturers and resellers offer refurbished systems or indi-
vidual parts you can replace. (Dell is one example of a company that enables 
you to buy refurbished systems.)
Telling your green computing story
You can make another commitment to support 
the green movement in computer manufactur-
ing: give companies your feedback. If manu-
facturers overpromise, tell them so. And don’t 
just tell them: Post it on your blog; contribute 
to forums; post user reviews and ratings. We 
aren’t asking you to flame anybody — that’s 
just not nice, and it earns you some nasty e-mail 
karma — but we do want you to tell your story 
about the system you purchase. If it’s green and 
you love it, terrific! Tell the world. If it falls short 
and the manufacturer could do a better job rep-
resenting the green features it promises, your 
fellow environment-advocating computer users 
deserve to know that, too.

Chapter 7
Choosing Earth-Friendly 
Peripherals
In This Chapter
▶ Planning an eco-friendly purchase
▶ Checking out gleaming green monitors
▶ Meeting printer superheroes
▶ Buying drives, storage, and other not-so-boring necessities
T
he microprocessor chewing away at the data inside your computer is a 
little like a caterpillar, eating hundreds of times its weight in energy in 
a single day. It continually devours electric current to fertilize your spread-
sheets (sorry for that image) and help your productivity blossom. But what 
goes on inside your computer is only part of the story. In the bigger scheme 
of things, peripherals drink quite a carafe of juice on their own — especially 
the peripheral you look at all day. Peripherals are devices outside the main 
computer and include printers, mice, monitors, keyboards, cameras, and 
myriad other devices. A peripheral is always a device of some sort. For exam-
ple, a DVD isn’t a device, so it isn’t a peripheral. Standalone devices (those 
that don’t connect directly to your computer), such as routers, aren’t con-
sidered peripherals, but you should consider them in your plans for a green 
computing environment.
This chapter gives you what you need to explore green components to add to 
your green computer. You find out about the green factor for monitors, print-
ers, mice, and keyboards. You also find the answer to the age-old question, 
“Does the Hewlett-Packard I-can-do-everything-including-the-dishes-with-my-
printer model really save any energy?”
Along the way, you pick up a few sources of green peripherals and come 
away with some good ideas you can try at home without a net. Ready to get 
started?

126
Part II: Choosing Your Green PC Path 
Planning Your Purchases 
of Green Peripherals
Consumers are interested in trying green versions of their favorite brands, as 
the green movement in computer manufacturing bears out. But manufactur-
ers that produce green peripherals know that they’re competing for market 
share with other manufacturers on important qualities including size, perfor-
mance, and price. To get the right green peripherals, you have to consider all 
these qualities and weigh some trade-offs, including the following:
 
✓ Price: One challenge that peripheral makers face is offering products at 
competitive prices. The new technology used to create green devices 
costs more than the old polluting technologies commonly used in exist-
ing devices. Vendors pass the additional cost of the new technology onto 
buyers and then add a premium because they feel they can charge more 
for the new device. Buyers won’t necessarily want to fork over an extra 10, 
12, or even 20 percent just to get good green components. Over time — 
and as green awareness grows — we’re betting that more people will.
 
✓ Energy use: Some peripherals use more energy than others because 
each type of peripheral uses different types of resources:
 
• Monitor: The monitor you choose consumes quite a bit of energy 
compared with other peripherals. It has become more common 
to connect multiple monitors to a computer to help coordinate 
data activities (a word processor on one display and a browser on 
another, for example). When your computer has multiple monitors 
attached to it, the energy consumption is magnified. Use a single 
monitor whenever possible. For tips on choosing a green monitor, 
see Chapter 5.
 
• Printer: Your printer uses less energy than your monitor but still 
consumes its share. Look on the vendor Web site for printer speci-
fications. For example, you can see the specifications for the HP 
LaserJet 9050 series at http://h10010.www1.hp.com/wwpc/
uk/en/sm/WF06a/18972-18972-3328059-3328068-3328068-
410000.html.
 
• Mouse: Your mouse doesn’t eat much. Wired mice draw their 
energy directly from the system, which is kinder to the environ-
ment than wireless mice where you must supply batteries.

127
 Chapter 7: Choosing Earth-Friendly Peripherals
 
• Keyboard: Your keyboard, if it’s the wired kind, draws the minimal 
amount of power it needs from your system unit, and that’s a neg-
ligible amount. If you use a wireless keyboard, you’ve got some 
battery action going on — batteries can be problematic for the 
environment.
 
• Other: There are many other peripherals you can connect to your 
computer. For example, most people connect their digital camera 
to their computer to download and process pictures they take. 
Many people also use external storage devices for backup pur-
poses. Every peripheral you connect to your computer uses energy 
and you must consider that energy use as part of your green com-
puting plan. Normally, the vendor will tell you how much energy 
each device uses.
 
✓ Performance: Many people associate performance with speed; however, 
speed is only part of the equation. A green device performs well when 
it delivers a maximum number of tasks in a given amount of time for a 
limited amount of energy. A device that can deliver four tasks for 300 
watts is better than a device that can only deliver three tasks for the 
same amount of energy. If the device can also perform the task faster 
than another device, meaning it draws energy for less time, it also saves 
energy and the environment.
 
✓ Materials: You should consider what kinds of materials were used to 
make any device you’re considering buying. Keep away from harm-
ful materials such as lead and mercury in any device you buy. See the 
device-specific sections later in the chapter for details on hazardous 
materials for particular device types.
All that guilt aside, you do need a monitor for a desktop system, and you 
probably need a printer too.
Part of the equation in green home computing is purchasing the type of 
peripheral you need to do the job you need it to do. This may mean purchas-
ing a midrange monitor instead of a super-snazzy, power-hungry, oversize 
screen, or it may mean getting one printer that you share with other people 
in the house instead of buying one for each computer (a topic that we dis-
cuss in the next section).
Use Table 7-1 to get a sense of what — and how much — you need.

Sharing Peripherals: A Friendly Way 
to Save the Earth
At one time, peripheral devices were extremely expensive, so people shared 
them. A printer might cost more than several terminals connected to a main-
frame. However, as the PC revolution progressed and people embraced the 
personal in computing, peripheral devices became less expensive. Suddenly, 
everyone has to have their own printer.
There are more peripheral devices now than ever before, too. At one time the 
monitor, keyboard, mouse, and printer were the four peripherals that every 
computer owner wanted. Now, computers have all kinds of connections to 
scanners, digital cameras, external drives, and a host of other devices. The 
result is that single computers have scads of power hungry devices attached 
to them.
Why not share that equipment? Sharing is a friendly thing to do, and it’s good 
for the earth too. At home, you probably already share many things — the 
refrigerator, the microwave, the washer and dryer (okay, maybe one person 
uses those more than another does) — so sharing technology isn’t a com-
pletely foreign concept.

129
 Chapter 7: Choosing Earth-Friendly Peripherals
What can you share?
Depending on the number of people in your family, your ages, the type of work 
you do, and the ways in which you all use computers, your family members 
may be able to share computer time and resources easily — or not. Some 
peripherals are easy — you can always share a printer. Other devices are 
hard — only one person can process the pictures found on a digital camera 
at a time. A few devices may be impossible. For example, sharing a single PDA 
may prove impossible because the very definition of a PDA is something you 
Breaking resource sharing to the kids
Introducing the idea of resource sharing in 
your household may be something that you 
have to do strategically. If your kids are still in 
that “Mom, he’s breathing my air!” stage, get-
ting them to share peripherals, such as digital 
cameras, may prove impossible. The amount 
of CO2 you’d produce managing the stress of 
your household would probably offset any sav-
ings you might create. (Remember that you can 
always share a printer — just make sure you 
put it in a public place, rather than one child’s 
room.)
If you want to introduce the idea of resource 
sharing — á la computer peripherals — to your 
family, here are a few ideas to keep in mind:
 ✓ Depending on your kids’ ages, they may 
either grumble no matter what you say or 
take credit for the idea (“I’ve been telling 
you that for a year, Dad!”).
 ✓ Give and take are required. If you’re time-
sharing a family PC, start with a schedule, 
and be prepared to renegotiate and revisit 
it for weeks, ad nauseum. Even if you aren’t 
sharing a PC, make sure shared peripher-
als have a schedule. If one child is using 
the scanner, everyone else will suddenly 
decide they need it too.
 ✓ Be willing to give up some of your own time 
when someone has a need that’s really 
urgent. Demonstrating kindness sends a 
good message (and reinforces your own 
good effort).
 ✓ If you expect great resistance in the 
computer-sharing department, start with 
peripherals only. Have one digital camera 
instead of four. Get a wireless router, and 
have everybody print to the same printer. 
Make it a point to look for energy-efficient 
devices as a family; read the numbers and 
do the research together.
 ✓ Give your family periodic energy updates 
by letting them know how much CO2 they’ve 
reduced through family efforts. Have a 
carbon-offset party. Plant something to 
commemorate a milestone. If you reward 
everyone’s efforts and keep them informed 
about the difference they’re making, you 
give them incentive to do more. Everyone 
feels better when we’re doing our part; it’s 
part of our species DNA.

ment? Have your kids check out Lose Your 
Excuse, from the U.S. Department of Energy

130
Part II: Choosing Your Green PC Path 
use to store your personal information. Here are a few ideas to get you started 
thinking about what you can share and what you definitely can’t:
 
✓ Schedules: Think of the overall schedule at home. Are some people 
home when others aren’t? Schedule single use peripherals so that every-
one can use the same device. For example, it’s likely that not everyone 
will need the camera at the same time, so create a schedule for it that 
reflects the schedules of the people who need it.
 
✓ Priorities: What types of activities do people use the peripherals to do? 
Letting someone use the digital camera for a school project probably 
has a higher priority than taking snapshots of friends. Likewise, a scan-
ner used to input data for your home business is probably a higher pri-
ority than scanning recipes into a database.
 
✓ Usage: Are some peripherals used only once in a while, and can all 
family members share them? Everyone can use the same printer at the 
same time — the printer will keep the print jobs straight. However, only 
one person can use a digital recorder at a time. Is it possible for every-
one to share a single device?
 
In Chapter 12, you find out how to set up a home network to make sharing 
resources a simple reality.
Picking Printers
Okay, we’ve been a little hard on printers in this chapter. We’re not telling 
you to recycle all the printers in your house, but you can make a significant 
contribution to the greenness of the planet by reducing your paper consump-
tion and cutting down the amount of power that your printer soaks up.
You can green your printing by using a variety of methods that reduce, reuse, 
and recycle what you’ve already got. We share the how-to’s on those tech-
niques in Chapter 11. But what’s important to consider when you’re thinking 
of purchasing a new printer? What makes one printer greener than another? 
This section gives you some resources for answering those questions.
 
In Chapter 11, you see how to cut way back on printing resources. In that 
chapter, you also find out how to set up duplex (double-sided) printing and 
change other print options so that you’re getting the most use out of every 
watt possible.

131
 Chapter 7: Choosing Earth-Friendly Peripherals
Operating costs (in energy and dollars)
Here are some ballpark figures that give you a general idea of the operating 
costs, in kilowatt-hours (kWh) and dollars, of various printers:
 
✓ A small inkjet printer uses about 156 kWh per year and costs $9.44.
 
✓ A medium inkjet printer uses 184 kWh annually and costs $11.10.
 
✓ A small laser printer jumps to 1,173 kWh per year, with a $70.82 
price tag.
 
✓ A medium laser printer weighs in at 1,568 kWh per year, at a whopping 
$94.68 annual cost.
 
✓ A small multifunction printer (with scanning, copying, and faxing capa-
bilities) uses only 119 kWh per year and costs $7.18. (Ding, ding, ding! 
Bruce, we have a winner!)
 
 Figure 7-1 shows one of the new multifunction printers from Hewlett-
Packard (HP): a Photosmart C6380 multifunction printer, which sells for 
around $100. According to HP, this printer requires a maximum of 42 
watts, 5.2 watts while sleeping, 6.6 watts while in the ready state (ready 
to print, but not printing), 0.6 watts when turned off, and 24 watts while 
active or printing.
 
✓ A medium multifunction printer uses 171 kWh per year and costs about 
$10.30. Yep, that’s per year.
 
Figure 7-1: 
Multi-
function 
printers 
save beau-
coup bucks 
and CO2 
emissions.
 
As you can see based on these estimates, the printer you choose really does 
make a difference, both in the CO2 you’re pumping out and the dollars you’re 
shelling out.

132
Part II: Choosing Your Green PC Path 
 
One easy green move is to trade your laser printer for an inkjet printer 
because inkjet printers generally require less power and fewer resources 
(such as ink). (The tradeoff is that the per page cost of inkjet printers is higher 
than laser printers.)
Printers that do it all
As you see in the preceding section, multifunction printers — devices that 
do printing, copying, scanning, and sometimes faxing — really save a whop-
ping amount of wattage. For that reason, if you can pack two devices that you 
need into one (such as a scanner and printer), you reduce your power con-
sumption dramatically, so we say, “Do it!”
Here are some questions to ask when you’re considering a new green multi-
function printer purchase:
 
✓ Is the printer Energy Star compliant?
 
✓ What functions does it offer?
 
✓ Does it offer duplex printing?
 
✓ How fast does it print?
 
✓ Does it use inkjet or toner cartridges? Inkjet cartridges are generally 
better because they require less oil. In fact, if you use soy-based prod-
ucts, inkjet cartridges don’t require any oil at all.
 
✓ Does it work with a variety of papers?
Although looking for an all-in-one multifunction printer manufacturer is a 
good start, also be sure to look for the Energy Star logo before you buy. Table 
7-2 shows some manufacturers you may recognize that meet Energy Star 
specifications for their all-in-one devices:

 Chapter 7: Choosing Earth-Friendly Peripherals
 
To qualify for the Energy Star certification, a printer needs to meet the follow-
ing standards:
 
✓ It must demonstrate a 25 percent energy savings compared with conven-
tional models.
 
✓ It must be able to print double-sided pages.
A printer all by its lonesome
If you need a stand-alone printer — no scanner or copier, thanks very much — 
go with the smallest and most energy-efficient offering you can find. One that 
also uses recycled ink cartridges (or even soy-based ink cartridges) is even 
better.
One new offering that’s getting good reviews is the HP DeskJet D2545, which is 
made almost entirely of recycled plastic. Here are some of its green features:
 
✓ Made of 83 percent recycled plastic
 
✓ Print cartridges made of 75 percent recycled plastic
 
✓ Packaging made of 100 percent recycled material
 
✓ Fast printing
 
✓ Paper-saving Print Cancel button
 
✓ Compliant with Energy Star standards
Seeing Some Specialty Drives
We all need places to store the documents, programs, games, music, videos, 
and contacts we collect. If you’re like us, you’re collecting more every day! 
When you consider how to increase the amount of storage you have avail-
able, think green. This section introduces a few storage options — external 
hard drives as well as travel and flash memory — that can meet your storage 
needs in a planet-friendly way.
SimpleTech (re)drive
The SimpleTech [re]drive external hard drive is a small, low-power stor-
age device that is made according to the European Union’s Restriction of 

134
Part II: Choosing Your Green PC Path 
Hazardous Substances (RoHS) standards. Packaging is reduced to a mini-
mum, using recycled materials.
But the big surprise is what is used to make the [re]drive — bamboo (yes, 
you read that right) and recycled aluminum. (See Figure 7-2.) The lightweight, 
small-footprint device stays cool without a fan (which lessens its power con-
sumption) and includes an Energy Star power adapter. The unit also comes 
with online backup for extra storage. You can find out more about the [re]
drive by going to www.simpletech.com/products/storage/redrive.
Kanguru Eco Drive
The Kanguru Eco Drive is an external hard drive that the manufacturer touts 
as being the most environmentally friendly external hard drive on the market 
today. The drive has a smart power-saving mode with three settings — Power 
Down, Standby, and Idle — that tailors power consumption to the use of the 
drive, which conserves energy and extends the drive’s life.
The drive uses a high-speed USB 2.0 connection and is compatible with both 
Windows and Mac computers. The unit is also European Union’s Restriction 
of Hazardous Substances (RoHS)–compliant, which means that it’s lead and 
mercury free, and that it can be sold in and exported from the European 
Union.
Earthy flash drives
You can green up your temporary storage by choosing flash drives made of 
earth-friendly materials such as corn-based or recycled plastics or bamboo. 
The ATP 8GB EarthDrive, shown in Figure 7-2, comes loaded with security 
software that ensures the privacy of your data and allows drive partitioning.

 Chapter 7: Choosing Earth-Friendly Peripherals
 
You can also find a whole forest of bamboo flash drives online — great as cus-
tomizable promotional items — by searching for eco-friendly flash drives.
Selecting Keyboards and Mice
You won’t find a huge range of choices when you go shopping for earth-
friendly keyboards and mice, but some companies are doing things right.
 
If you use a wireless keyboard and/or mouse, use rechargeable batteries to 
keep your energy use low.
Logitech possibilities
Some of the biggest manufacturers of peripherals take green requirements 
seriously, as you’d expect them to do. Logitech — a successful maker of 
mice, keyboards, Webcams, and more — follows the European Union’s RoHS 
directive, which places restrictions on the materials that manufacturers can 
use in products to be sold in the EU or exported to other countries.
iameco 
One intriguing source of natural keyboards and mice (among other computer 
products) is iameco computers, headquartered in Dublin, Ireland. This com-
pany set its sights on developing an ecologically friendly personal computer 
called the iameco with a wooden case that’s biodegradable. That’s right — 
when you finish using it, toss the case out in the compost pile and eventually 
use it to green your garden.
iameco’s designers borrowed ideas from nature’s life cycle and worked to 
minimize the use of natural resources. Also, no scary materials such as lead, 
mercury, and other hazardous chemicals are used to produce the equipment. 
To find out more about earth-friendly keyboards and mice (see Figure 7-3)

Just say no to canned air
Okay, eat a couple of Oreos at your keyboard, 
and what do you have? Crumby QWERTY keys. 
You can clean the crumbs (as well as the other 
grime and gook that accumulates over time), 
but there’s a green way to do it. First, stay away 
from the canned air. It’s packed into the can 
with stuff you don’t want to breathe (includ-
ing tetrafluoroethane), and it’s not good for the 
environment, either. So clean your keyboard the 
healthy way by following these steps:
 1. Unplug the keyboard from the system unit 
or, if you’re using a laptop, power down.
 2. Turn the thing over and shake it (gently).
 3. Using a dry cotton swab, clean out any 
other loose debris between the keys.
 4. To remove sticky spots, use a damp cotton 
rag with a tiny dot of earth-friendly dish 
soap.
There. That wasn’t so hard. No forced air 
required.

 Chapter 7: Choosing Earth-Friendly Peripherals
Calling Router Rooter
Even though routers aren’t actually peripherals, they do exist on your net-
work and you have to consider them as part of your green computing plan. 
Routers aren’t notorious energy hogs, but every little bit of energy savings 
helps. If you’re thinking about consolidating peripherals and sharing what 
you have, your router is about to become a more important peripheral in 
your home. First, here are a couple of green computing facts:
 
✓ Your router sips power all the time. It’s okay to turn it off if no one is 
home and your ghosts — er, guests — aren’t using it.
 
✓ Consider what your router is made of. Some router manufacturers are 
looking into earth-friendly materials. (Read on.)
D-Link is d-place to be
A new player in the happy green Wi-Fi world is D-Link, which offers a new 
series of wireless routers: Xtreme N, which targets big-time online gamers. 
These routers rely on Green Ethernet, a technology that adjusts power con-
sumption based on use.
The routers include a scheduling feature that lets you specify active and 
sleep times of the day. (Think of the programmable thermostat in your home. 
The same energy-saving technique can apply to your router.) Also, the com-
pany uses only Energy Star power supplies, so the whole ballgame begins 
with efficiency.
You can find out more about D-Link’s green philosophy and the technology 
behind the products by going to www.dlinkgreen.com.
Netgear Green
Another popular router manufacturer, Netgear (see Figure 7-4), recently 
turned over a green leaf of its own. The new Netgear Green features of 
the company’s latest routers comply with the 802.11n standard (which is 
wireless-speak) and are shipped in packaging made of 80 percent recycled 
materials. In addition to the earth-friendly packaging, Netgear uses Energy 
Star power supplies and has a simple but elegant feature that many routers 
don’t offer: an On/Off switch so that you can simply turn the thing off when 
you don’t need it. That feature represents simplicity and energy conservation 
at their finest.

Making the Purchase — and 
What to Do Afterward
After you get the peripheral home (or it arrives on your doorstep), and you 
unbox it and plug it in, here are a few things to keep in mind:
 
✓ Enable the power-saving features. Some manufacturers (including HP) 
ship their equipment with energy-saving features already turned on; 
others leave that for you to do. Printers and battery-powered devices 
generally come with power saving features enabled, other devices prob-
ably won’t. Take a minute to read the manual or open the information 
file on the driver disc. Look specifically at the energy-savings section to 
see whether you need to do anything in particular to take best advan-
tage of energy-efficiency settings.
 
✓ Measure the device’s energy consumption. Pay attention to your 
energy use. If you invested in a power meter like the Kill A Watt, great! 
Plug in your new peripheral, and see what kind of energy it’s really 
drawing. Peripheral devices, such as printers, have several different 
power modes. Make sure you measure each mode, such as standby 
and actively printing, separately. If you don’t have a fancy-schmancy 
device, keep an eye on your electric bill. Is it going down? Do you see 
any change? Your green education doesn’t end with the purchase; the 
purchase is just part of the path.

Recycling Your Computer
In This Chapter

Y
ou’ve probably noticed that nothing exists in a vacuum. Each being, 
each circumstance, each problem, each opportunity is connected to 
everything else. You see this fact in the food chain and the economy. (Oh, 
boy, do you see it in the economy!) You see it in your home, your work, your 
health, your pets, and your plans.
This sense of oneness may show up in earth care perhaps more dramati-
cally — and with a potentially longer-term impact — than in any other single 
area of life. Why? Without too much stretching of the imagination, you can 
see that we’re all in this together. The air in China eventually gets to you, 
wherever you live in the United States. The water you drink today is part 
of a shared global water resource (one that scientists are concerned about 
because it’s diminishing, by the way). Without a big effort, you can plainly 
see that your choices are connected in a very real way to effects in your 
immediate environment and around the world.
Facing the e-Waste Facts
At first blush, the question of recycling computers may not seem that big a 
deal to you. If you’re just purchasing a new green system, you may have it 
for . . . what . . . five years or so? Then you’ll give it to someone else, take it to 
a responsible recycler, or maybe just put it out with the trash one day.

140
Part II: Choosing Your Green PC Path 
Some U.S. states, however, have laws against discarding computers by toss-
ing them out the window with the bathwater. (We hope that you’re not 
tossing your bathwater out the window either, come to think of it.) Illegally 
discarded computers, known as e-waste, represent one of the fastest-growing 
problems facing the environment today. Recent statistics show that the aver-
age home life of a computer is only three years.
Following the reduce, reuse, recycle mantra, it’s a good green practice to plan 
to hold on to the computer you’ve got for as long as you can. Make it work; 
use it well; and when the time comes to retire it, do so responsibly by using 
a bona fide recycling program that really does what it says it’s going to do. 
Each choice you make about how you dispose of systems, monitors, and 
peripherals — not to mention batteries and other power sources — either 
adds to the problem or helps with the cleanup.
What e-waste are we throwing away?
Anything that you’d call “computer equipment” can be recycled somewhere. 
In addition, you can recycle MP3 players, cellphones, digital cameras, game 
systems, and personal digital assistants (PDAs). Right now, however, the 
majority of electronic equipment goes directly to landfills. It does not pass 
Go; it does not collect $200.
Here are the statistics, according to the U.S. Environmental Protection 
Agency (EPA). Be forewarned that they’re not pretty.
 
✓ Americans own nearly 3 million electronic products.
 
✓ In 1998, an estimated 20 million computers became obsolete.
 
✓ In 2007, an estimated 37 million computers — almost double the 1998 
estimate — became obsolete.
 
✓ In addition to computers, 304 million electronic devices — monitors, 
cellphones, and other gadgets — were thrown away in 2005.
 
✓ Discarded electronics constitute 70 percent of metals and 40 percent of 
the lead in U.S. landfills.
 
✓ As of 2007, of the 2.25 million tons of electronic equipment ready to be 
disposed of, 414,000 tons (or 18 percent) were recycled, and 1.84 million 
tons (82 percent) were dumped into landfills all across the country.
 
✓ Only 15 percent of computer equipment was recycled until 2006–2007, 
when several states started mandatory recycling for electronic equipment.

141
 Chapter 8: Recycling Your Computer
 
✓ In the 10 years leading up to 2002, sales of consumer electronics in the 
United States quadrupled.
 
✓ Just over half of Americans are aware that recycling electronics is an 
option.
What’s really in computer waste?
If the computer you put out with the trash actually makes it to the landfill, it 
leaks hazardous chemicals into the ground, and those toxins eventually find 
their way into the water supply for surrounding areas. Here are some of the 
problems with the various computer components that are shoved into land-
fills and covered with dirt (and more trash):
 
✓ Lead: Cathode-ray tube (CRT) monitors contain lead and other hazard-
ous metals. The glass of the screens, when broken, releases a dust that 
is harmful as well. Lead in the environment can cause respiratory prob-
lems and cognitive-development issues.
 
✓ Mercury: Liquid-crystal display (LCD) monitors contain mercury (also 
used in cellphones, MP3 players, and television sets), which can damage 
the brain, nervous system, reproductive system, kidneys, and lungs.
 
✓ Copper: Computers contain copper. The process of creating usable 
copper and etching the wires on the computer boards adds to acid rain 
and contributes to global warming. High doses of copper can cause 
headaches, stomachaches, dizziness, vomiting, and diarrhea. It can also 
cause liver and kidney damage.
 
✓ Chemicals: Each semiconductor used in computer chips includes hun-
dreds (no kidding) of hazardous chemicals, which can contribute to a 
variety of physical problems in children and adults.
 
✓ Plastics: The treated, flame-retardant plastics used in computers, called 
polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs), can contribute to neurodevel-
opmental problems and some cancers.
Exporting the e-Waste Problem
Around the world, e-waste is a problem of massive proportions. The export 
business is alive and well, with e-waste being shipped to developing coun-
tries such as China, India, and Nigeria, where labor is cheaper and there are 
fewer restrictions on working conditions than in the United States.

142

Figure 8-1 shows a diagram produced by the EPA that maps the process that 
e-waste follows.
 
Figure 8-1: 
What really 
happens 
to your 
computer 
after you 
let it go?
 
As you can see, the normal life cycle involves purchasing the computer and 
then giving it to someone else when you don’t need it anymore, storing it, 
taking it to a recycling center, or throwing it out. If you throw the computer 
away — Dispose, in the diagram — it goes to your local landfill and leaches 
chemicals into the soil and water supply (refer to “What’s really in computer 
waste?” earlier in this chapter). If you send it to a recycling center, one of 
four things can happen:
 
✓ The computer may be resold in the United States.
 
✓ The computer may be resold outside the United States.
 
✓ The computer may be processed (broken down into its parts) and recy-
cled in the United States in such a way that new products are created 
and the unusable components are disposed of responsibly.
 
✓ The computer may be processed outside the United States. In this case, 
fewer safeguards are in place, and the system may wind up being burned 
for scrap metal in China, India, or Kenya.

143
 Chapter 8: Recycling Your Computer
Stories on news programs like “60 Minutes” and video segments on envi-
ronmental blogs have helped break the story of the villages in China where 
electronics are broken down to their components and burned for their scrap 
metal, and the families that do this dangerous work earn the Chinese equiva-
lent of a few dollars a week. Children are exposed to the toxic chemicals, 
which permeate the air and water in the villages. Don’t kid yourself — these 
toxins travel around the world as well.
Jim Puckett, coordinator of the Basel Action Network (www.ban.org), 
was recently quoted in ENVIRONMENT: Where That “Recycled” E-Waste 
Really Goes by Stephen Leahy (http://ipsnorthamerica.net/news.
php?idnews=1841). As Puckett says, “I recently watched shipping contain-
ers loaded in the U.S. being opened on the docks in Hong Kong. Inside, they 
were packed with e-waste.” Experts estimate that an average 100 containers 
of e-waste arrive in Hong Kong from the United States every day, and the con-
tents are smuggled illegally into mainland China.

Seeing Reasons to Recycle Computers
In the reduce, reuse, recycle mantra, recycle may sound like the end of the line, 
where the computer moves beyond your concern and becomes somebody 
else’s problem. In reality, your recycled computer may be somebody else’s 
beginning. A growing market exists (thank goodness) for second-life comput-
ers: desktops, laptops, monitors, and peripherals that have been donated, 
refurbished, and maybe even recertified.
 
Wonder what the difference is between refurbishing and recertifying? A refur-
bished computer has parts that someone has fixed or updated to make the 
computer ready to rock again. A recertified computer gets similar treatment, 
except the manufacturer takes a look and gives it the thumbs-up if it meets the 
manufacturer’s standards. So a recertified computer gets a slightly higher-
level nod.

144
Part II: Choosing Your Green PC Path 
When you decide to recycle a computer, you might
 
✓ Donate the computer to a not-for-profit organization, school, or person 
who needs it.
 
✓ Give your computer to a recycler in your local area.
 
✓ Take or send your computer to a manufacturer’s or retailer’s recycling 
program.
The rest of this chapter explores these options in more detail so you can 
decide what’s best to do with the system you’ve got.
Planning Your Computer’s Retirement
We assume that you’re all charged up (that’s a power phrase, by the way) 
about reducing your energy use and staying on top of your home computing 
resources. Perhaps you just purchased a new and greener computer. Good 
for you! The next step is deciding what you’ll do with the old one. Here are 
some guidelines to help you begin the process of donating or recycling your 
old system in an earth-friendly way:
 
✓ Know what you’re giving. Before you donate a system to someone else, 
have a technical friend look it over and make sure that someone else can 
actually use it. Some computers are so old there really isn’t anything 
to do but recycle them. (Kathy had an old Windows ME system a few 
years ago that was good for little more than propping the window open 
on a nice day.) If the machine is still usable — in other words, you used 
it until you got the new one — chances are that it can be a blessing to 
someone else.
 
✓ Know where you’d like to give it. If you plan to donate your computer 
to someone in your own circle of friends and relatives, cool. If, however, 
you want to donate the system to a school, not-for-profit organization, 
or another charity that you’re not personally involved with, it’s usu-
ally not a good idea to donate the item directly. Consider giving your 
system to a recycling or refurbishing organization that ensures that the 
computer works the way it should and has legal copies of software. The 
recycler can then give your refurbished computer to the school, not-for-
profit organization, or charity.
 
✓ Know what doesn’t work, and find a recycler to take it. If you have 
equipment that doesn’t work at all — such as a printer with a dead head, 
a scanner that doesn’t scan, or a computer that doesn’t power up — find 
a computer recycler for the item. A computer recycler can salvage the 
usable parts before recycling what remains. Some manufacturers have 
recycling programs. (In fact, Energy Star now requires manufacturers 
qualifying for the Energy Star logo to run their own recycling programs.) 

145
 Chapter 8: Recycling Your Computer
Independent recyclers exist, too, and you may find several in your 
local area. We tell you more about finding a local computer recycler in 
“Finding a Reputable Recycler,” later in this chapter.
 
✓ Include the peripherals. Donating your computer is helpful, but it’s 
even better for the recipient if you include the keyboard, mouse, printer, 
and other devices that you use with the computer. Schools and not-for-
profit organizations often have very limited tech budgets, and though 
receiving the computer may be a good thing, if they don’t have what 
they need to go with it, your donation may go unused.
 
✓ Include the software. This point is a confusing one for people who are 
concerned about honoring the software license on operating systems 
and packaged software. If you purchased software to run on the com-
puter that you’re now donating, it’s perfectly fine to send along the 
software package and CDs. In fact, the recipient will thank you for it — 
big time. Also, the refurbisher will want to see the documentation and 
authentic seal on the software package so it knows it’s donating legal 
copies of software.
 
 The same thing applies to the computer’s operating system. One big 
challenge in recycling and refurbishing computers in years past was that 
“clean” refurbished systems didn’t have an operating system installed, 
and most users weren’t interested in systems that were that clean.
 
✓ Know how to clean off your personal information. Before you donate 
your computer anywhere — whether you’re taking it to a friend’s house, 
donating it to a school, or delivering it to a recycler or refurbisher — 
know how to remove all your personal information. You have Web set-
tings, cookies, browsing history, e-mail messages, contacts, documents, 
files, and much more stored on that system, and even though you may 
think that you’ve gotten rid of it by deleting the files, the data isn’t actu-
ally “all gone.” To eliminate it for good, you need to use a disk-cleaning 
program. (We tell you more in “Wiping Your System Clean.”
 
✓ Keep a record of where you took the system. Yes, this point seems to 
be pretty basic, but as time goes on, you may wonder where that com-
puter went. Also, if you don’t get a receipt or some kind of documenta-
tion, you may miss out on a tax break, and every little bit helps. (For 
more info on donating computers, see “Finding Great New Uses for an 
Old Computer,” later in this chapter.)
Wiping Your System Clean
We begin here by saying that most local recyclers and refurbishers that help 
you prepare your donated computer for reuse are reputable, but in this age 
of identity theft, why take a chance? Cleaning off your computer — and get-
ting it really clean — is an important step in the recycling process.

146
Part II: Choosing Your Green PC Path 
Before you give your computer to recyclers or refurbishers, be sure to do the 
following things:
 
✓ Uninstall the software that you intend to use again on another system.
 
✓ Move the files and folders that you need to a backup device or new 
computer.
 
✓ Delete files and folders.
 
✓ Clear your browser cache (uninstalling software seldom removes all of 
your data from the machine).
 
✓ Remove all user accounts on the computer.
 
✓ Use a disk-cleaning program to remove everything else.
We discuss all these steps in the following sections.
Uninstall as needed
Chances are that some programs came bundled with the computer you’re 
about to recycle, and you may want to send them along with the system to 
its next incarnation. That’s fine, but first be sure to remove any personal 
information (and delete the data files, which we show you how to do in the 
“Delete the rest” section).
On your Windows machine, the personal information you entered when you 
registered the software is likely stored in the Windows Registry. Use the fol-
lowing steps to open the Registry Editor, where you can look for personal 
information:
 
1. Choose Start➪Run.
 
 You see the Run dialog box.
 
2. Type RegEdit in the Open field and click OK.
 
 Windows starts the Registry Editor, where you can look for bits of 
personal data.
Some programs use initialization files (.ini files) to store the data. You 
can search for .ini files and open them with a text editor such as Windows 
Notepad to remove the information.
 
On a Mac, the information you entered during software installation and regis-
tration should be stored in the Preferences folder. The Preferences folder 
normally contains a list of .plist files that have names in the form of com.
[company name].[product name].plist. For example, iTunes has a pref-
erences file named com.apple.iTunes.plist. Simply delete all of these 

147
 Chapter 8: Recycling Your Computer
.plist files to remove your personal information. After you get rid of your 
personal info, uninstall programs as you normally would.
 
Although it’s legal to pass along the purchased copy of software you used on 
the old system (refer to “Planning Your Computer’s Retirement,” earlier in this 
chapter), it isn’t okay to give away the CDs and manuals and still continue to 
use the software on another system. Yeah, we know — lots of people do. But if 
they jumped off a cliff, you wouldn’t. Would you?
Back it up, big fella
Make sure to make backup copies of all the files, folders, and programs you 
want from the existing computer. You can use Windows Easy Transfer to do 
this easily on a Windows Vista or Windows 7 computer; alternatively, you can 
copy those files, folders, and programs to an external hard drive, an online 
file storage system, a CD, or a flash drive.
 
If you’re using Windows XP, and you’ve inadvertently (and often) assigned 
long filenames to files and folders, copying or moving those files may be a 
pain. You can use Robocopy to do the transfer for you. Originally available as 
part of the Windows Server 2003 tool kit, Robocopy is available as freeware in 
several incarnations. The one available at the following link has an easy-to-use 
interface and does the job: 
http://web.comporium.net/~gwenanderic/software/EasyRoboCopy101.zip
You can discover how to use Robocopy at 
http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc733145.aspx
Delete the rest
Do a quick inventory of the places where you expect your files to be. On a 
Windows machine, your data files — all those files that you created in vari-
ous applications — are probably somewhere in the Documents folder (maybe 
in their own subfolders as well). If you’re using a Mac, you’re likely to find 
application data files in the Documents folder.
Often, however, people don’t stick with the default locations for data files. 
They wind up scattering files on the desktop, in the application folders, in 
other folders that they create, and maybe even in the root directory (in the 
folder for the drive, such as C:) instead of in subfolders.
We won’t lecture you. We do it too.

148
Part II: Choosing Your Green PC Path 
Just take a good, long look around, and make sure that you’ve deleted every-
thing that looks like you created it. Better safe than sorry.
You can use your operating system’s search tool to list all files and then 
sort them by date, with the newest files at the top of the list. For example, 
in Windows, you can use Windows Explorer to look through data folders on 
your machine and sort them by clicking the appropriate column at the top of 
the right pane. When working on a Macintosh, you search using Finder. This 
method enables you to scan the dates on the displayed files to make sure 
that you haven’t missed anything important.
Clear your browser files
One nearly-invisible place where your personal information can collect is 
your Web browser’s cache. The browser cache keeps track of the sites you’ve 
visited; your user preferences for those sites; and information you’ve entered 
on those sites, such as passwords, usernames, form data, and addresses.
Most browsers provide a method for clearing the cache. For example, in 
Firefox you simply click Clear Now in the Private Data section on the Privacy 
tab of the Options dialog box (display the Options dialog box by choosing 
Tools➪Options). To clear your browser cache in Internet Explorer, follow 
these steps:
 
1. Choose Tools➪Internet Options.
 
 Figure 8-2 shows the Internet Options dialog box for Windows. The 
Browsing History area stores the files collected online.

2. Click Delete.
 
 The Delete Browsing History dialog box appears, listing several types of 
information that may be stored in your browser files (the kind of infor-
mation that Internet Explorer displays depends on the Web sites you 
have visited).
 
3. Select all check boxes and then click Delete.
 
 The files are deleted from the system.
 
If you plan to continue using this computer, deleting passwords and form data 
may remove information that you’ll wish you had later, but for your purposes 
here, you want to remove all traces of your activity.
Remove all user accounts
If you have multiple user accounts set up on your computer, make sure that 
you remove all the profiles and passwords that your family members use. 
You can get to the User Accounts page quickly by typing user accounts in the 
Windows Vista search box and clicking User Accounts when it appears in the 
All Programs list. Then you can remove an account by following these steps:
 
1. In the User Accounts screen, click Manage Another Account.
 
 The User Account Control dialog box may pop up; if so, click Continue.
 
2. In the Manage Accounts page, click the icon or name of the account 
you’d like to delete.
 
 The Change an Account page appears, displaying several options for 
working with the user account you selected. (See Figure 8-3.)
 
Figure 8-3: 
Bye, bye

3. Click Delete the Account.
 
 The Delete Account page asks whether you want to keep or delete the 
files connected to the account you’re deleting. (See Figure 8-4.)
 
Figure 8-4: 
You may 
as well let

4. Click Delete Files.
 
 Windows Vista, never the impulsive one, asks you to confirm that yes, 
you really, really do want to delete the account.
 
5. Click Delete Account.
 
 That’s it! Piece of cake, right?
 
6. Repeat Steps 2–5 for all other accounts on the computer except the 
Administrator account.
 
7. Change the password for the Administrator account to something 
super-simple, such as 12345.
 
 You change the password so that other people won’t start guessing your 
actual passwords based on the sample you provide. It’s important to 
provide something different from what you normally use. In addition, 
you want to make the password simple so that the next person to use 
your computer doesn’t have to go through finger gymnastics to access 
the system the first time.

151
 Chapter 8: Recycling Your Computer
You’ll also want to remove user accounts on your Macintosh. Use the follow-
ing steps to perform this task.
 
1. Choose Apple menu➪System Preferences.
 
 You see a list of system preference options.
 
2. Click Accounts.
 
 You see the Accounts dialog box.
 
3. Open Accounts Preferences.
 
 You see a list of account preferences. Some of the settings might appear 
dimmed. If so, proceed to Step 4; otherwise proceed to Step 5.
 
4. (Optional) Click the lock icon. Type an administrator name and pass-
word when asked by the system.
 
 The account preference settings are no longer dimmed.
 
5. Highlight the user account you want to delete. Click Delete.
 
 The system asks whether you really want to delete the user account.
 
6. Click Delete Immediately to remove the user account and all the 
user’s files.
 
 The system deletes the user information.
 
Be sure to include the account name and password with the computer (perhaps 
put it on a sticker on the bottom or side of the unit) before you drop it off.
Use a disk-cleaning program to 
remove everything else
Many users don’t realize that when they simply delete a file, it isn’t necessar-
ily gone. The index to the file may have been erased, but the file may still be 
retrievable, even after you reformat your hard drive, as final as that sounds. 
With the proper software (and dastardly intent), other people can access 
information on your old computer that you thought was long gone.
Sensitive or personal information means more than love letters you wrote to 
your special someone. It could also mean your Social Security number, your 
credit card account numbers, passwords, and preferences. It can include 
e-mail, your contacts, and any cookies any site ever left on your system.

152
Part II: Choosing Your Green PC Path 
To make sure that your computer is really, truly clean, you should use a com-
mercial disk-cleaning program such as the following (you should do this in 
addition to manually cleaning the hard drive because none of these products 
will catch absolutely every little thing):
 
✓ Active@ Kill Disk Hard Drive Eraser (www.killdisk.com/eraser.
htm) is freeware that meets U.S. Department of Defense standards for 
sanitizing disks.
 
✓ Blancco PC Edition (www.blancco.com/eng/products/blancco+-+
data+cleaner) isn’t free ($32), but it offers several features, including 
a comprehensive erasure report.
 
✓ WipeDrive (www.whitecanyon.com/erase-file-index.php) is 
available for both Windows and Mac machines for $39.95.
 
✓ Mac users can also use the built-in Disk Utility program (choose 
Applications➪Utilities to access Disk Utility). You can read more about 
Disk Utility at

Finding Great New Uses for 
an Old Computer
Many of the computers that wind up in landfills could be happily serving stu-
dents, librarians, social advocates, and people of faith all over the world right 
now. This section gives you a range of ideas for possible homes for your old 
computer, but before you donate, be sure to do your homework and make 
sure that the refurbisher is a reputable one. We cover both topics in the fol-
lowing sections.
Doing the pre-donation paperwork
Before you donate your computer to some worthy individual or organiza-
tion, it’s important to document it in some way. The person receiving the 
computer will want to know some information about it. Because we all forget 
what we’re told, it’s important to have this information in writing. Use Table 
8-1 to help you make the plan for donating the equipment.

We left a blank row at the bottom. Your plan should include anything you 
think the recipient might find helpful. For example, does the computer include 
the manuals? If so, you should document them. When a computer includes 
additional software, you should include that information too. If you plan to 
provide other peripherals, document each of them. In short, document every 
aspect of the computer so the recipient has no questions about it.
Finding a refurbisher
As the green-tech industry matures, some organizations and businesses 
are getting in on the certification game, which is good because, ultimately, 
it means that more people care about the standards we expect for quality 
green products. (This trend also helps educate consumers and safeguard 
them against greenwashing.)
Microsoft, for example, offers the Microsoft Authorized Refurbisher (MAR) 
program (http://oem.microsoft.com/public/seo/mar.htm) to large-
scale refurbishers that take care to wipe computers clean before installing 
Windows, commit to using only legal software, use adequate security con-
trols, and act in accordance with health and safety regulations for electronics. 

154
Part II: Choosing Your Green PC Path 
Microsoft gives each MAR partner low-cost Windows software to install on 
each machine before delivering it to the recipient. A version of this program 
called Secondary PC is available for refurbishers in the Czech Republic, 
Nigeria, Pakistan, and South Africa.

Donating to a worthy cause
Many organizations struggle to find good computer equipment at a price they 
can afford — usually free. The computer you think is outdated and worthless 
might be solid gold to these organizations. Before you simply toss that old 
computer away, think about giving it to someone who really wants it. The fol-
lowing sections provide some solid ideas for places to donate your computer.
Not-for-profit organizations
Not-for-profit organizations accept donations of all kinds, including time, 
treasure, and talent. A computer that you’re no longer using would definitely 
be treasure to someone who needs it, but you can also invest some time and 
a little of your talent as you think creatively about where to donate and what 
to give along with it. You may want to check out refurbishers or recyclers in 
your local area that focus on technology.
Before you run to your nearest not-for-profit, however, do a little calling. 
First, make sure the organization you have in mind can actually use your 
old computer. Second, make sure that you ask the organization about other 
needs it might have. Sometimes you find that an item collecting dust in your 
closet is precisely what the organization requires.
Here are a few types of not-for-profit organizations that could make good use 
of your computer donation:
 
✓ After-school programs at organizations like the YMCA
 
✓ Occupational organizations that train underserved populations in 
necessary job skills
 
✓ Youth development programs, such as Boys and Girls Clubs
 
✓ Your local nature organization or parks department (for use in a 
computer lab or nature center)

155
 Chapter 8: Recycling Your Computer
 
If you’re shopping for a possible computer recipient at a not-for-profit organi-
zation, GreatNonprofits.org (www.greatnonprofits.org) helps match 
needs, talents, people, and purpose, and can help you find out more about the 
organization you’re interested in donating to.
Schools
Everybody knows that students need computers, but not every student 
has access to one. Consider donating your clean, working computer to a 
school that may not have the resources of larger suburban districts. Use the 
Computers for Schools site (www.pcsforschools.org) to locate a refur-
bisher in your area that will help prepare the computer for just the school 
that needs it. (See Figure 8-5.)

Here are a few more sites that focus on getting refurbished systems into the 
hands of kids who’d love to have them: www.youthfortechnology.org, 
www.giftmypc.org, and www.komputers4rkids.org.
Religious organizations
Increasingly, churches, synagogues, and mosques are teaching their students 
and followers about computers, and this can mean offering access to Web 

156
Part II: Choosing Your Green PC Path 
sites, job training, language classes, healthcare awareness, and even online 
education. All these missions require computers, at least in the virtual world. 
You can donate your old computer directly to your favorite religious organi-
zation, but be sure to clean the system thoroughly first.
Finding a Reputable Recycler
You may be surprised to discover the number of organizations in your area 
that offer computer recycling. When you begin to explore this option, keep 
the following pointers in mind.
Do your research
Your friends may be able to help steer you toward a good recycler. Follow 
their leads, but also do your own research.
Check large Web sites or those that are affiliated with groups you trust, such 
as the EPA. Several of the following sites may offer lists of recyclers in your 
area:
 
✓ E-cycling Central (www.eiae.org; see Figure 8-6.) 
 
✓ Earth911.com (www.earth911.org)
 
✓ Find Your Local e-Stewards (www.e-stewards.org/local_
estewards.html; see the nearby sidebar)
 
✓ myGreenElectronics (www.mygreenelectronics.org)
 
✓ TechSoup’s Donate Hardware (www.techsoup.org/resources/
index.cfm?action=resource.view_summary&resourcelist_
id=144)
Find your e-stewards
Partnering with electronics recyclers in the 
United States and Canada, the Basel Action 
Network (refer to “Legislating e-waste dis-
posal,” earlier in this chapter) created the 
e-Stewards certification program to help 
consumers find true green recyclers in their 
states.
To locate e-Stewards in your area or to down-
load a PDF listing all certified recyclers in the 
United States, go to www.e-stewards.

Ask questions
We don’t like to think that recyclers will be dishonest about what they do 
with the systems they receive, but being part of the e-waste solution means 
asking questions.
A recycling company that’s on the level and not shipping boatloads of toxic 
e-waste to developing countries will be willing to answer the following 
questions:
 
✓ What do you do with the equipment you receive? The recycling com-
pany should be able to offer you a specific recycling plan and the names 
of places that receive the recycled parts. You can double-check the plan 
by checking with these companies to make sure the recycler actually 
does supply them.
 
✓ Where do you send parts for materials recovery? Again, look for 
specific information. Don’t be surprised if the recycler ships products 
overseas. It’s better to find a recycler that processes materials locally 
because overseas processing is usually dirty and environmentally 
unfriendly.
 
✓ What do you do with the usable components? The best answer here 
is to build up new computers for people to use. After all, the ultimate in 
recycling is to create something new with the least possible effort.

158
Part II: Choosing Your Green PC Path 
 
✓ Where do the CRTs you receive wind up? Many CRTs end up overseas. 
Try to find someone who processes them locally. Make sure that the 
components are sent to someone for reprocessing into new devices of 
some sort. Because CRTs are less popular today, don’t be surprised to 
find that the parts end up as something entirely different from computer 
equipment.
 
✓ What do you do if someone’s personal data is accidentally left on the 
system? It’s possible that the recycler exposes the system to a strong 
magnet — strong enough to destroy any data. If that’s the case, then you 
don’t have any worries. The idea is to find someone who assumes the 
drive has data on it and removes it automatically, even if there really 
isn’t anything on the drive.
 
✓ How do you test the equipment before you give it to a recipient? The 
words you want to hear, in this case, are “burn-in test.” A burn-in test is a 
serious and complete examination of every aspect of the system before 
it goes to someone else. Using a burn-in test ensures the recipient has 
the best possible experience with your old computer.
 
Are you curious about what goes on inside a computer-recycling outfit? You’ll 
find an interesting five-minute video clip called “Recycling Computers,” online at 
www.thefutureschannel.com/dockets/hands-on_math/recycling_computers
Know the recycling laws in your area
Not all U.S. states have true recycling laws in effect, but you can be sure that 
the conversation is on every state lawmaker’s agenda. The National Center 
for Electronics Recycling (www.electronicsrecycling.org) keeps track 
of legislative changes and posts updates, as well as a diagram of the types of 
laws at work in different states.
Generally, state recycling laws regulate what citizens can throw away, where 
it goes, who pays for it, and how it’s monitored.
As we’re writing this book (in 2009), the following states have enacted 
recycling laws: Arkansas, California, Connecticut, Hawaii, Illinois, Maine, 
Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, New Hampshire, 
New Jersey, North Carolina, Oklahoma, Oregon, Rhode Island, Texas, Virginia, 
Washington, and West Virginia. That leaves a lot of room for growth!

 Chapter 8: Recycling Your Computer
Going Back to the Source (Almost)
One of the easiest recycling options — and one that reduces the amount of 
legwork you have to do — is to use your computer manufacturer’s recycling 
program. Some manufacturers — including Dell, Hewlett-Packard, and Apple — 
have great recycling programs and a true green commitment. Other manufac-
turers may be a little late to the party but are no less committed.
In addition to computer manufacturers, some retail outlets (including Staples 
and Office Depot) provide drop-off recycling programs.
In general, you’ll find that computer manufacturers and retailers offer ser-
vices reflecting one or more of these options:
 
✓ They provide a take-back, mail-in, or trade-in program.
 
✓ They partner with local organizations that receive recycled equipment.
 
✓ They sponsor collection events.
As you might expect, companies set up their programs differently. Dell, for 
example, doesn’t care what kind of computer you’re trading in as long as you 
buy a Dell; other companies want only their brands sent in for recycling.
Most companies seem to know — at least in theory — that maintaining 
responsibility for their computer equipment through that equipment’s entire 
life cycle is the right thing to do. Some companies, such as Dell and HP, make 
it very easy for customers to recycle their old systems. You don’t hear as 
much about Toshiba’s green efforts, but that manufacturer is making great 
strides as well. (See Figure 8-7.)
Where are you, Aretha? Rethink!
The Rethink Initiative ( http://pages.
ebay.com/rethink/index.html) is 
a program, hosted by eBay, whose members 
work to encourage best practices in electronics 
recycling throughout the industry. The initiative 
hopes to bring business, government, associa-
tion, and not-for-profit groups together to expand 
the discussion of the challenges of e-waste and 
try to come up with feasible solutions.
These partners are currently part of the Rethink 
Initiative: Apple, Best Buy, Circuit City, CEA 
(Consumer Electronics Association), Dell, 
Gateway, Hewlett-Packard, IBM, Ingram Micro, 
Motorola, Nokia, Toshiba, United States Postal 
Service, UPS, Verizon, Wireless . . . The New

 Chapter 8: Recycling Your Computer
It’s great news that more and more manufacturers are getting with the pro-
gram every day. Bear in mind, however, that this “end game” is only part 
of the true green life cycle. To make a huge, long-term impact, all computer 
manufacturers need to work actively to reduce — and eventually eliminate — 
the hard-core toxic chemicals they use in product manufacturing. Then they 
can get to work on making their manufacturing process more energy- and 
resource-efficient, too. Offering a recycling program, however, is a start — a 
big start — so we’re not knocking it.
Recycling Computer Supplies, Too
In Chapter 11, we introduce the possibility of recycling your toner and inkjet-
printer cartridges. You can recycle rewritable CDs (by rewriting them, of 
course). Floppy disks aren’t useful any longer and there really isn’t a good way 
to recycle them unless you give them to someone with an older system. Flash 
drives are more in keeping with the times, but they don’t last forever, either.
Finally, don’t forget the batteries you use. Rechargeables are givens, but when 
those have gone to the big power-charger in the sky, you can drop them off 
at an organization that partners with the Rechargeable Battery Recycling 
Corporation (RBRC). You can find the RBRC site (shown in Figure 8-8) at
www.rbrc.org/call2recycle/dropoff/index.php

The site tells you more about the various programs; easy partners to spot are 
Office Depot, RadioShack, and Wal-Mart. According to the RBRC, 6.3 million 
pounds of batteries were recycled safely in 2007 alone!
Taking Local Action to Clean Up 
Global Computer Waste
There are all kinds of roads to green advocacy; the journey is limited only by 
your imagination! How can you help let people know that e-waste is some-
thing to care about on a global scale? Here are just a few ideas to get you 
started:
 
✓ Spread the word. The Electronics TakeBack Coalition has a variety of 
information about global e-waste on its site at www.electronics
takeback.com/problem/export_problem.htm. You’ll find the latest 
data on tech dumping, as well as a “60 Minutes” video of the deplorable 
conditions in China (refer to “Polluting poorer countries,” earlier in this 
chapter).
 
✓ Download the e-waste briefing book. The Electronics TakeBack 
Coalition published a briefing book, e-Waste: The Exploding Global 
Electronic Waste Crisis, in February 2009 to help you talk to businesses, 
government leaders, friends, and family members about the realities of 
global e-waste. Download the free book at 
www.electronicstakeback.com/legislation/Ewaste%20Briefing%20Book.pdf
 
✓ Find out about the recycling laws that are in effect in your state. Visit 
the State by State e-Waste Law Summary at
www.electronicstakeback.com/legislation/States%20Summary%202009.pdf
 
 to find out what’s happening in your area and get involved.
 
✓ Tell the story your way. If you’re a teacher, design a lesson plan about 
responsible computer recycling. If you’re a painter, create something 
that inspires people to love the earth and to care about her misuse and 
underappreciation. If you’re a businessperson, make and model green 
computing choices at work — and when people ask why, share the rea-
sons why.
Even little changes add up to a big difference over time — just like that small 
inkjet cartridge that you recycled this afternoon and all the hundreds more 
that you’ll recycle over the next ten years. With some good old-fashioned 
dedication to cleaning up our own messes, building a system that works, and 
keeping at it ’til we see good things beginning to happen, we can make the 
world a greener place.

Part III
Greener Under 
the Hood

In this part . . .
S
tarting where you are is a good philosophy for greening 
your technology. Chances are that you’ve got more than 
one or two electronic devices around the house — maybe 
desktop computers, laptop computers, printers, game sys-
tems, cellphones, MP3 players, and digital cameras. Sound 
familiar? Each item uses some kind of power, either AC, 
(plugged-in power) or DC (battery life). In addition to the 
power those devices use, they have already made an impact 
on the environment simply by the nature of their existence 
(the manufacturing process uses a lot of resources) and 
their arrival at your house. (Packing, shipping, and delivery 
all use materials, electricity, and fuel, which translate to CO2 
emissions.) 
In this part of the book, you take a closer look at the com-
puters, devices, and peripherals you already have and 
explore ways to decrease their power-and-resource 
impact. Along the way, you’ll find out how to dial back 
your power consumption and manage what you use, 
reduce the number of trees smashed into pulp for your 
printouts, and learn how to share resources among the 
various computers in your house. You might even save a 
few bucks in the process.

Chapter 9
Optimize Your Computer 
Power Management
In This Chapter
▶ Knowing your computer’s energy consumption
▶ Cutting down the energy drain quickly
▶ Managing power on Windows and Mac computers
▶ Monitoring and managing with third-party tools
W
hen you explore the world of conservation, you look at ways you can 
begin to make an impact on the environment by choosing to green 
your technology and apply the natural laws of reduce, reuse, and recycle. 
This chapter brings such practices to your fingertips by showing you how 
to reduce the amount of energy your computer is consuming right now as it 
whirs quietly in the background. The good news is that you can save half a 
forest (no kidding — as many as 300 trees per PC) by trading your always-on 
mindset for a PC power-management plan.
In this chapter, you discover quick ways to reduce the energy your computer 
swallows needlessly. After those initial energy cutbacks, you shrink your 
carbon footprint even more by putting a power plan in place — a plan that 
optimizes your PC’s power use but still gives you the performance you need. 
The process sounds pretty techie, but it’s really surprisingly simple, and the 
Windows power-management plans take you most of the way there.
Taking Your Computer’s Temperature
Your computer isn’t the only energy-sucking culprit in your house. Anything 
that’s plugged in — whether it’s turned on or off — draws at least a little cur-
rent. To give you a bit of an idea of how much a computer costs when turned 

166
Part III: Greener Under the Hood 
off, a typical computer uses 4.8 watts when turned off (see http://tech
reviewer.com/viewpage.cfm/ui/040226130555 for some other 
statistics — note that these statistics are for an older computer — newer 
computers use even more power). If you leave it off for 24 hours, that’s 115.2 
watt/hours or 0.1152 kilowatt/hours. If your electrical utility charges $0.35 
per kilowatt/hour, then your computer is costing you around $0.04 per day, 
even if you leave it turned off. Now, consider that if you just leave your com-
puter turned off, put plugged in, you’re spending $14.72 for electrical power 
every year. That’s $14.72 to do absolutely nothing!
In addition to your desktop and laptop computers, you may have a router, print-
ers, a scanner, a digital camera, a camcorder, an MP3 player, and game consoles. 
What about wireless game controllers? Yep, they use power too. Even though 
they run on batteries, the receiving unit draws power, and of course, batteries 
are a type of power — a type that needs to be recharged or disposed of properly 
in a way that doesn’t muck up the environment even more.
So even when you think your technology is turned off, it still may be drinking 
in a steady stream of energy. Take a closer look. If you can read the clock on 
your DVD player, it’s using power. The only way to get the DVD player to stop 
using power is to unplug it (a great use for the power switch that comes with 
most power strips is to turn it off — which effectively disconnects everything 
attached to the power strip when you’re not using it).
 
A plugged-in laptop is a laptop that’s using power. Even if you shut your 
laptop down, if the system is plugged in, it’s drawing electricity. To stop the 
drain-and-replace process, unplug your laptop when it’s fully charged.
Energy Appetites 101
Computer manufacturers are the first to tell you that their systems are 
energy-efficient and green. Well, some are, and some aren’t so much. 
Generally speaking, newer computers are more energy-aware than older sys-
tems, and operating systems make a difference too. Windows XP with Service 
Pack 1, for example, was created in an era when we weren’t quite so con-
scious of PC energy drain, whereas Windows 7 — designed in an ecologically 
awake landscape — provides several easy-to-use tools for power manage-
ment. Macs in general have a reputation for doing less with more.
In most systems, the amount of power used to start the computer is roughly 
equivalent to the amount of power that the computer uses in an active state 
(when you’re loading photos, writing a document, or watching a video online, 
for example). By comparison, Sleep mode uses a small amount of energy!

 Chapter 9: Optimize Your Computer Power Management
 
The message? Power up once during the day, and if you’ll be away from your 
computer for a few hours, let it go to sleep. If you’ll be gone three hours or 
more, shutting the system down can save some watts, but if you’ll be back 
right after lunch, sleep mode is the way to go.
Sleep mode in Windows is a low-impact mode that enables you to take a 
break from your computer and then go right back where you left off without a 
lot of drain on power (or the risk of losing data). The “Putting your computer 
to sleep” section of this chapter tells you how to work with sleep mode.
Energy use in laptops shows up differently from what you see in desktop 
systems; that’s because now you have to consider the effect of using a bat-
tery power source. Power consumption doesn’t stop when you unplug the 
system. You may be surprised to see how much power it actually takes to 
charge the laptop battery. 
 
The University of Pennsylvania keeps a detailed, updated list of power-use 
comparisons for several top computers (desktops and laptops). You can 
check out the comparisons by going to 
www.upenn.edu/computing/provider/docs/hardware/powerusage.html
What’s going on under the hood?
Things may look pretty quiet as you gaze at the surface of your computer, 
but a whole “ecosystem” of energy-consuming life is underneath. Each com-
ponent draws power as electric current runs the length of paths and circuits. 
Your monitor has the biggest appetite, followed by the chipset on the moth-
erboard, the microprocessor, the graphics card, the hard drive, and the net-
work card. Although you’re not likely to cut back on the basic power supply 
that each of these elements needs to function effectively, you can make a 
difference in the total amount of electricity that your computer uses by creat-
ing a power plan. With just a few clicks, you can control how and when your 
computer uses the most power, and balance that use with the kind of overall 
performance you want from your computer.
Table 9-1 compares the amount of electricity your technology uses in various 
power states, and the following list tells you what those states mean:
 
✓ Active means the technology is plugged in, turned on, and in use (as 
when you’re watching an online video).
 
✓ Active standby means the technology is turned on but isn’t in use (as when 
the printer is turned on but you’re not printing anything at the moment).

168
Part III: Greener Under the Hood 
 
✓ Passive standby means the equipment is ready for use but isn’t active 
(as when you can turn on your DVD player by pressing a remote-control 
button).
 
✓ Off means the equipment isn’t in standby mode and can’t be activated 
until the power is switched on.

Chances are that your computer equipment doesn’t use an astronomical 
amount of energy, but when you multiply the number of computers and 
peripherals you have (don’t forget to add your monitors, routers, printers, dig-
ital cameras, camcorders, and scanners) by every house on your block, and 
then by all the blocks in your city and all the cities in your state, you get an 
idea of how big the savings could really be. In fact, a 2001 study by the U.S. 
Department of Energy showed that in the United States, technology gobbles 
up 3 percent of total energy consumption.
 
On some systems, it may be possible to change the computer’s Basic Input/
Output System (BIOS) so that the CPU (central processing unit) functions at a 
minimal power level. The computer manufacturer determines whether you 
can control those settings. Messing with the BIOS, however, isn’t something 
you should try unless you’re technically inclined or very, very lucky.

169
 Chapter 9: Optimize Your Computer Power Management
Later in this chapter, you find out about Windows Vista, Windows XP, and 
Mac power management plans (as well as a little about Windows 7), and see 
how to get your computer on a reasonably healthy diet of balanced energy 
consumption. The good news is that setting up your power management plan 
isn’t nearly as geeky as it sounds!
Quick Energy Cutbacks for Your PC
You probably want to start with the easy fixes, so this section gives you a 
look at a few simple ways to begin reducing your computer’s power con-
sumption. The first consideration is whether you even need to have the com-
puter on. (You’re probably reading a book right now — the non-electronic 
variety — which doesn’t require any power usage.) But beyond that basic 
choice — on or off — you can perform the simple tasks outlined in this sec-
tion to slow the rate at which you draw watts into your house.
Unplug peripherals
Any device plugged into your computer by universal serial bus (USB) uses 
your computer’s power just by the nature of its connection. If you have a 
mouse, touchpad, scanner, printer, or flash drive connected to your com-
puter, it’s consuming electricity — maybe a tiny amount, but still some.
Before you just yank out all the USB cables connected to your system, how-
ever, consider what they connect to — and use the Safely Remove Hardware 
Wizard in Windows to let them go gracefully. Here’s how to do that:
 
1. Double-click the Safely Remove Hardware icon in the Windows notifi-
cation area. 
 
 The Safely Remove Hardware dialog box appears, listing all peripherals 
currently connected to your computer.
 
2. Select the item you want to remove and then click Stop.
 
 The Stop a Hardware Device dialog box appears, as shown in Figure 9-1, 
so you can confirm that you really do want to disconnect the device. 
(Yes, Windows wants to be extra careful.)

170
Part III: Greener Under the Hood 
 
Figure 9-1: 
Confirm the 
item you’re 
removing.
 
 
3. Select the item you want to remove and then click OK.
 
 The Safe to Remove Hardware balloon pops up above the notification 
area, letting you know that you can disconnect the peripheral safely.
 
If the Safely Remove Hardware tool doesn’t seem to be working right in your 
version of Windows, check out the fix Microsoft has posted for this tool. Go to 
http://support.microsoft.com/kb/931619 to find out more.
Dim the lights
Most of us like a nice crisp display, but you may be able to conserve some 
of the power your monitor uses by lessening the monitor’s brightness. You 
don’t have to trade eyestrain for a lower electric bill, though; you can find a 
happy medium.
The brightness control is actually a hardware feature, which means that you 
need to look on the monitor itself to change the brightness on your desktop 
PC. Your monitor may have its own brightness-control buttons, or you may 
need to use the keyboard to find the brightness controls. Consult your moni-
tor’s manual if you aren’t sure how to adjust the brightness.
Your laptop may have a function key (labeled Fn) that you press along with 
another key to adjust the brightness. Typically, the characters on the Fn 
key are a different color from those on other (non-function) keys so you can 
locate a chosen key easily. Function-related keys on the keyboard have the 
same color as the Fn key, indicating that when you press Fn and then press 
one of these other keys, they perform specific tasks. On my laptop, for exam-
ple, these steps reduce the brightness:
 
1. Press and hold Fn.
 
 The name of the Fn key appears in blue letters on screen.

171
 Chapter 9: Optimize Your Computer Power Management
 
2. Press F6.
 
 The F6 key displays a symbol with a down-pointing triangle and a bright-
ness symbol, which looks like a little sun icon.
 
3. Repeat Steps 1 and 2 until you get the brightness effect you want.
 
Is the screen too dull now? If so, you can reverse the process by looking for 
the Fn key combination that enables you to increase the brightness. (On my 
system, it’s Fn+F7.)
 
When your laptop draws power from the battery, Windows dims the screen by 
default to conserve power. You can change the display settings as part of your 
Windows power management plan (see “Set It Up Your Way with Windows 
Power Management,” later in this chapter).
Dump your screen saver
Once upon a time, screen savers really did save your screen from some-
thing. They were designed to keep the screen display moving to prevent a 
static image from being burned into the monitor when the computer was left 
inactive for long periods. Changes in monitor technology did away with the 
risk but not with the practice. Screen savers became fun photos of the kids, 
mazes, puzzles, or nature scenes to cool people down between meetings. 
Today, however, those cool screen savers are contributing to global warming 
because they keep your computer running when it could be blanking out and 
going to sleep.
Here’s how to turn off your screen savers in Windows Vista and Windows XP:
 
1. Choose Start➪Control Panel.
 
2. Click Personalize.
 
 The Personalize Appearance and Sounds dialog box appears. Here, you 
can make all sorts of aesthetic changes to your Windows Vista setup, 
adjusting the color scheme and style of your windows, the mouse point-
ers, themes, sounds, and more.
 
3. Click Screen Saver.
 
 The Screen Saver Settings dialog box shows you the screen saver that’s 
currently active on your system. (See Figure 9-2.)
 
4. Choose None from the Screen Saver drop-down menu.
 
5. Click OK.

172
Part III: Greener Under the Hood 
 
Figure 9-2:

In Windows 7, you nix the screen saver by following these steps:
 
1. Choose Start➪Control Panel.
 
2. Click Appearance and Personalization.
 
 The Appearance and Personalization dialog box gives you a range of set-
tings that you can use to customize the look and feel of Windows 7.
 
3. In the Personalization area, click Change Screen Saver.
 
 The Screen Saver Settings dialog box appears.
 
4. Choose None from the Screen Saver drop-down menu.
 
5. Click OK to save your changes.
Here’s one more procedure for good measure. Do away with your screen 
saver in Windows XP by following these steps:
 
1. Choose Start➪Control Panel.
 
 If you’re using Windows XP, you see the screen shown in Figure 9-2, 
earlier in this section. If you like the retro look of Classic Windows and 
selected that option in the past, look for the Display applet that appears 
in the Control Panel.

173
 Chapter 9: Optimize Your Computer Power Management
 
2. Click Appearance and Themes.
 
3. Click Choose a Screen Saver.
 
4. Choose None from the Screen Saver drop-down menu.
 
5. Click OK.
Managing Power in Windows Vista
Even though Windows XP includes a respectable number of power-saving 
features, Windows Vista is the first Microsoft operating system developed 
and released in the growing green era. Vista represents a kind of four-way 
conversation among the software designers, consumers (that’s us), the envi-
ronment, and the machine.
As a result, Windows Vista is in sync with the times, offering you several ways 
to manage and reduce the energy your system slurps while you work, play, and 
surf. You get to make the call about how much power you want your system 
to use to deliver the kind of performance you want. That freedom of choice is 
important, because optimizing your computer’s performance is a subjective 
thing. You may want to save as much power as possible, and you feel perfectly 
fine about processing that’s a tad slow, but your friend down the hall might 
blow a gasket if her system doesn’t operate at top speed. (You may want to tell 
her it’s time to switch to decaf.) Every computer user needs to be able to make 
the call for his or her own computing experience.
Using the power-management features in Windows Vista, you can
 
✓ Create a power-management plan that helps you effectively (and easily!) 
manage the power your computer uses.
 
✓ Change the way your power buttons act.
 
✓ Turn on Sleep mode (and do away with hibernating forever).
 
✓ Reduce the amount of carbon dioxide that you add to the atmosphere.
 
✓ Still get a great look in Aero graphics (the fancy new interface supported 
by Vista and Windows 7 that includes transparent dialog boxes and the 
like) without any boost in your power consumption (meaning that you 
can look great for less).

174
Part III: Greener Under the Hood 
Putting your computer to sleep
Putting your computer to sleep when you aren’t using it is an important part 
of saving power. A sleeping computer uses less power while keeping your 
session alive and ready to use. However, Microsoft actually has three terms 
for sleeping, as explained in the following list.
 
✓ Standby: Places your computer in an energy-saving mode. Memory is 
still active and holds your data. However, hard drives, monitors, and 
other peripherals are shut down. The processor and many other periph-
erals are in a low-power state. As a result, your computer uses around 
11 watts instead of the usual amount of power.
 
✓ Hibernate: Saves all the data for the current session to the hard drive 
and then shuts the computer down. As a result, hibernate requires 
about the same amount of time as a normal boot to restore your session. 
This mode does save more power at around 4 watts.
 
✓ Sleep: Initially places your computer in an enhanced standby mode. 
Sleep uses features found in new computers to reduce power usage 
more than with the Standby mode found in Windows XP. Instead of 
11 watts, the Sleep mode uses around 8 watts. After three hours (the 
time interval is adjustable using the Power Options dialog box), Sleep 
places your computer in the equivalent of Hibernate mode (power usage 
goes down to around 4 watts), so you get the best of both Standby and 
Hibernate in a single package.
Sleep mode puts your computer into a low-power state that saves quite a bit of 
energy and still gives you access to your open files and applications — almost 
instantly — when you’re ready to get back to work. (By contrast, Standby 
mode in Windows XP can take up to five seconds and uses a whole lot more 
power in its inactive state.) Sleep mode uses only a fraction of the power that 
an active work session requires to keep your session in memory, and it powers 
up quickly (in two seconds!) when you press the power button to begin work-
ing again.
To put your computer to sleep, click Start; then click the gold Power button 
on the bottom-right side of the Start menu. (See Figure 9-3.)
To wake up your computer, press your computer’s power button, and 
the Windows Vista opening screen appears so you can choose your user 
account. Instantly you’re returned to the screen as you left it before your 
system went to sleep.

Checking out Vista power plans
The secret of choosing the right power plan for your computer is knowing 
what’s more important to you: saving a whole lot of energy or getting the 
best performance possible from your system. Windows Vista gives you a 
choice of three power plans (for a comparison, see Table 9-2):
 
✓ Balanced: Enables you to equalize the energy you use in proportion to 
performance so that neither one sets any Guinness Book records. You 
can save a healthy amount of energy by giving up just a little high-end 
performance. The Balanced power plan maximizes power conservation 
when your system is inactive — and adapts as needed when you need a 
power boost.
 
✓ Power Saver: Puts the premium on energy conservation and worries 
less about the performance of your computer. You might choose this 
option when you’re using a high-performing system that does well even 

176
Part III: Greener Under the Hood 
when it’s not running at the top of its functioning, or when the tasks you 
use the computer to accomplish put only light demands on the system. 
This power plan helps you get the most out of your battery charge so 
your laptop is good on the go as long as possible.
 
✓ High Performance: Isn’t so worried about energy use and puts all the 
emphasis on system performance. If you use processing-intensive appli-
cations, you may find that your laptop battery drains more quickly. If 
you’re AC-powered, you’ll simply draw more current.
 
You can change your power-management plan at any time. (See the upcoming 
“Switching your plan” section for instructions.) If you try one and aren’t get-
ting the results you want, switch it (or create your own)!

Choosing a power plan
To put one of the existing power plans into action, follow these simple steps:
 
1. Choose Start➪Control Panel.
 
 The Windows Vista Control Panel opens, showing you the variety of cat-
egories in which you can fine-tune your system.
 
2. Choose Hardware and Sound➪Power Options.
 
 Yes, it seems strange to throw Sound in there. But it’s all vibration, right?

177
 Chapter 9: Optimize Your Computer Power Management
 
3. Select the power plan you want to try.
 
 As you see in Figure 9-4, Balanced is selected by default, so if you opt 
not to change that setting, you have nothing else to do here. The power 
and performance indicators on the right side of the window give you an 
idea of the priorities of each plan.
 
 The plan you select goes into effect immediately; you don’t need to 
reboot (which is a relief and saves power).
 
The quickest way to choose a power plan — and save a few keystrokes of 
human energy at the same time — is to click Start and type power options in 
the Search box. You go directly to the power choices in Windows Vista. Nice.

Switching your plan
As you may already know from gym memberships and cellphone contracts, 
you don’t always choose the plan you really need the first time out. As you 
get a little experience with the plan you’ve selected, you may decide that 
it’s affecting your system’s performance too much. Or perhaps you can cut 
things back a little. Either way, you can remember which plan you selected 
and make an easy change by following these steps:
 
1. On your laptop, click the Power Meter icon in the Windows Vista noti-
fication area.
 
 The Power Meter icon looks like a little power plug. You can’t miss it. A 
note box pops up, showing you the power plan in effect and giving you a 
quick update on your system’s charge level.
 
2. To change the power plan, click the one you want.
 
 If you want to read more about the different power plans, click the More 
Power Options link at the bottom of the note box.

178
Part III: Greener Under the Hood 
To change the plan on your desktop PC, return to the Power Options 
Properties dialog box by clicking Start and typing power options in the 
Search box. Select the new power plan you want, and click the Close box.
Creating your own power plan
You can use any of the Windows Vista power plans as they are set by default, 
or you can customize them to fit the type of power management that best fits 
the way you use your computer. You can also create your own power plan 
from the ground up. Here’s how:
 
1. Choose➪Control Panel.
 
 The Windows Vista Control Panel window opens, showing you the vari-
ety of program icons you can use to fine-tune the functioning of your 
system.
 
2. Choose Hardware and Sound➪Power Options.
 
3. Click Create a Power Plan.
 
 Windows Vista shows you the power plan that’s currently in place 
(Balanced is selected by default) and allows you to choose other plans 
or create a new one.
 
4. Choose a plan that’s close to the one you want to create.
 
5. In the Plan Name field, type a name for the plan you’re creating; then 
click Next.
 
 You can use any combination of uppercase and lowercase letters in 
your plan name, and spaces are fine. Be sure to name the plan in such a 
way that you’ll easily remember later why you created it and when you 
should use it.
 
6. Specify your settings for display and your sleep settings for battery 
and AC power use.
 
 As shown in Figure 9-5, you click the down arrow for each setting, and 
choose the setting you want from the list that appears.
 
7. Click Create.
After you create a custom power plan, the plan is available so that you can 
review and change it easily. If you’re using a laptop computer, the new plan 
appears below the plans shown on the Battery Meter. If you’re using a desk-
top computer, the plan is under Preferred Plans.
Now when you click the Battery Meter icon in the notification area, the new 
power plan is one of the three displayed there. (See Figure 9-6.)

Energy-Friendly Windows 7
The early power-efficiency reports for Windows 7 are good. Windows 7 
extends the power consciousness of Windows Vista and reduces energy 
consumption even more, in particular when the computer is idle. Windows 7 
builds on the idea of smart trade-offs between power and performance by
 
✓ Adding to the power management plans and settings that you can control
 
✓ Enabling you to manage your devices’ power consumption
 
✓ Helping you use system resources such as your microprocessor, 
memory, and hard disk as efficiently as possible

180
Part III: Greener Under the Hood 
As computers have evolved and improved, so have users. People like instant 
results. (This is true not only in computing, we might add — hence, the seed 
of disposability). Few of us are happy to wait for long periods while the com-
puter wakes up; in fact, a slow computer feels like agony. Sleep mode, intro-
duced in Windows Vista, was designed to shortcut that long painful state of 
awakening by keeping your computer at the ready with minimum power use. 
Windows 7 continues that objective by improving Sleep mode and giving you 
additional ways to control the peripherals and internal system resources that 
go to sleep.
These steps lull Windows 7 to sleep on your computer:
 
1. Click the Start button.
 
 In the bottom-right corner of the Start menu, you see a right-pointing tri-
angle that appears to the right of the Shut Down button.
 
2. Click the right-pointing triangle and choose Sleep.
 
 If nothing appears to happen immediately, don’t worry. Here’s what’s 
actually going on when you put your computer to sleep in Windows 7:
 
• Windows 7 copies your programs, open documents, and anything 
else that’s currently saved in your computer’s memory to the hard 
drive.
 
• Windows takes a snapshot of the contents of memory, capturing 
everything so that it can come back quickly.
 
• Windows shuts down the hard drive, the monitor, and anything 
else that drains power, keeping a little trickle going to memory to 
keep your current work session intact.
One of the perks Windows 7 offers is a more reliable Sleep mode. With 
Windows Vista, if power is interrupted while the computer is sleeping, every-
thing in memory is wiped out. With Windows 7, if somebody trips over the 
power cord or your battery goes dead, Windows 7 can grab that snapshot of 
your data and programs, and take you right back where you left off.
Want to take a peek at Windows 7 power settings? If you’ve used Windows 
Vista, Windows 7 won’t look too different. Here are the easy steps:
 
1. Choose Start➪Control Panel➪Hardware and Sound.
 
 You see the Control Panel’s Hardware and Sound pane.
 
2. Below Power Options, click the link to Change Power-Saving Settings.
 
 You see the options shown in Figure 9-7.

3. Select the power plan you want to use.
 
4. Click Change Plan Settings if you want to customize the selected plan.
 
5. Choose when you want to turn off the display, and click Save Changes.
 
6. In the Select a Power Plan dialog box, click the Close button.
 
 On a desktop computer, the Balanced plan turns the monitor off after 
10 minutes and puts the computer to sleep after 30 minutes. The Power 
Saver plan turns the monitor off after 5 minutes and puts the computer 
to sleep after 15 minutes.
 
Microsoft recently published some recommendations that I found fascinating. 
If you really want to conserve energy with a desktop computer, be very 
aggressive with the monitor idle time — say, two minutes or less — and make 
sure that you don’t have a screen saver enabled. If you want to conserve 
energy with a notebook or netbook, your top priority is reducing screen 
brightness.

Dummies. Be sure to check out that book to discover ways to make the newest 
Microsoft operating system really sing.
Choosing Power Options in Windows XP
Windows Vista wasn’t the first version of the Windows operating system 
to care about power consumption; Windows XP includes a fair number of 
power management techniques that help you keep an eye on the energy your 
system uses and make choices about how you allocate the power (for how 

182
Part III: Greener Under the Hood 
long and to which devices). Granted, Windows XP’s initial power manage-
ment strategy may have been more consumer-oriented than green (as in “We 
want you to get the most out of your system’s battery life so you’ll like us” 
instead of “We care about the planet and are thinking environmentally”), but 
perhaps both views get you closer to the same end.
Here’s how to find and begin working with the power options you’ll find in 
Windows XP:
 
1. Choose Start➪Control Panel.
 
 The Windows XP Control Panel window opens in either Category view 
or Windows XP Classic view (depending on which view you used the last 
time you opened Control Panel).
 
2. Choose Performance and Maintenance➪Power Options.
 
 The Power Options Properties dialog box opens, as you see in Figure 9-8. 
This small but mighty dialog box is the hub for the power choices you 
make in Windows XP. Table 9-3 introduces the tabs and tasks that you 
find in this dialog box.

You’ve probably noticed a little terminology difference here. What Windows 
Vista and Windows 7 call power plans, Windows XP refers to as power 
schemes. The XP phrase seems just a little sneakier, don’t you think?

one you want from the Power Schemes drop-down menu. Notice that the 
power settings at the bottom of the dialog box change to reflect the power 
scheme you select.
Each power scheme offers two settings (Plugged In and Running on Batteries) 
for the following choices:
 
✓ When the monitor shuts off
 
✓ When the hard disk shuts off

184
Part III: Greener Under the Hood 
 
✓ When Standby mode is activated
 
✓ When Hibernate mode is activated
After you make changes to the plan, you can save the new default settings 
you’ve selected or create another plan based on your new settings.
Making your power choices
Here are the steps for tweaking one of the power schemes that come with 
Windows XP:
 
1. In the Power Options Properties dialog box, choose the power scheme 
you want to use from the Power Schemes drop-down menu.
 
 If you don’t see exactly the one you want, choose the one that’s closest 
to the type of power scheme you think you’ll use. Notice that the set-
tings in the bottom half of the dialog box change to reflect your choice.
 
2. Click the down arrow next to each setting you want to change to dis-
play a list of options.
 
 It’s a big range of options, isn’t it? Find the length of time that works best 
for you, in minute or hour increments.
 
3. Choose new values from the list.
 
 You may want to change settings for some items but not for all. You 
could be more concerned about power consumption when your com-
puter is running on battery, for example. In that case, you would choose 
shorter time periods for the Running on Batteries settings than you 
choose for the Plugged In settings.
 
4. Click Apply.
 
 The power settings are saved as part of the selected power scheme and 
applied immediately.
 
You can customize any power plan in Windows XP to suit your preferences, 
but if you want to keep the original plans intact, click the Save As button 
below the Power Schemes drop-down menu to save the modified power 
scheme under a different name.
Saving a customized power scheme
If you want to keep the default power schemes intact, you can save your 
customized power scheme and apply it to the way that Windows XP manages 
power for your system. Here are the steps:

185
 Chapter 9: Optimize Your Computer Power Management
 
1. Choose the power scheme closest to the one you want to create.
 
2. Modify the power-option settings so that they appear the way you 
want them (refer to the preceding section).
 
3. Click Save As.
 
 The Save Scheme dialog box appears.
 
4. Enter a name for the new scheme, and click OK.
 
 The new power scheme is applied by default. You can still change set-
tings, apply another scheme, and return to the new scheme at any time 
by making new changes in the Power Options Properties dialog box.
Alert! Diet infraction!
Power is such a quiet thing — how will you know when your system is run-
ning low? One way to check involves using the Power Meter icon in the 
Windows XP system tray. But what if you’re caught up in what you’re doing 
and forget to check? You can avoid those low-power outages that can cost 
you valuable time and data by using the Alarms tab in the Power Options 
Properties dialog box.
Windows XP Alarms let you set a low-battery alarm so that when power gets 
to a certain level (a level that you set), the program notifies you by sounding 
an alarm or displaying a text message. You can also have the computer go 
directly to Standby or Hibernate mode, or even shut down completely. (Do 
not pass Go; do not collect $200.) One further choice that Alarms offers: You 
can arrange to have Windows XP run a specific program when a power event 
(such as low battery or going to standby) occurs.
To set alarms for power management in your version of Windows XP, follow 
these steps:
 
1. In the Power Options Properties dialog box, click the Alarms tab.
 
 The options shown in Figure 9-9 appear. The defaults set on your system 
may be different from the ones you see here. Windows XP gives you 
the option of setting two levels of notification — one as a Low Battery 
Alarm, when your system power reaches a low level, and the other as a 
Critical Battery Alarm, when your computer is about to run out of juice.
 
2. Select the Activate Low Battery Alarm check box if it’s deselected.
 
 The slider control and the Alarm Action button become available.
 
3. Drag the slider to the percentage of charge you want to set for the low-
battery alarm.

4. Click the Alarm Action button.
 
 The Low Battery Alarm Action dialog box appears. You’re most likely to 
want to use the Notifications options in the Low Battery Alarm Action 
dialog box. All settings here are optional.
 
5. Set the Alarm Actions as follows:
 
• In the Notifications area, choose whether you want a sound alarm 
or a text message (or both).
 
• In the Alarm Action area, choose whether you want the system 
to stand by, hibernate, or shut down automatically when the low-
power setting is reached.
 
• In the Run a Program field, you can have Windows XP automati-
cally run a program when a power event — such as a low-power 
setting or a power outage — occurs.
 
6. Click OK to close the Low Battery Alarm Action dialog box.
 
7. Repeat Steps 2–6 for the Critical Battery Alarm setting.
 
 Typically, you’ll use the Low Battery Alarm simply to call your attention 
to the fact that your power is draining away, but the Critical Battery 
Alarm signifies a more dire state. Here you may want to choose an 
action in the Alarm Action area so your computer hibernates immedi-
ately in critical power situations.
 
8. Click OK to save all power settings on the Alarms tab.

 Chapter 9: Optimize Your Computer Power Management
Bring in the batteries
A simple way to keep an eye on your power consumption in Windows 
involves checking the Power Meter. Click the Power Meter tab on the Power 
Options Properties dialog box to see information about the battery you’re 
using. This tab shows you your current power source as well as the charge 
level of your batteries.
Want more info on the battery your system uses? Click the battery icon, and 
a pop-up window displays your battery’s manufacturer’s information.
Tell your power buttons what to do
The Advanced tab of the Power Options Property dialog box includes sev-
eral choices that affect the way your computer behaves when you close the 
lid (on a laptop) or push the power button. When you close the lid on your 
laptop, you can have Windows XP do nothing, move into Standby mode, or 
hibernate.
When you push the power button on your system, you can have Windows XP
 
✓ Do nothing.
 
✓ Ask what you want to do.
 
✓ Stand by.
 
✓ Hibernate.
 
✓ Shut down.
 
By default, the first check box tells Windows XP to display the Power Meter 
icon in the system tray. This setting is an easy way to keep an eye on your 
computer’s power level, so leaving that check box selected is a good idea.
Simply make your choices and click OK to save the changes.
Ah, the competition between Windows XP Hibernate and Standby. This sib-
ling conflict has been immortalized in blogs and discussion boards through-
out the virtual PC kingdom.
Hibernate and Standby are two options that Windows XP offers when you 
take steps to shut down your computer. The process goes like this:

188
Part III: Greener Under the Hood 
 
1. Choose Start➪Shut Down.
 
2. Click the power-down option you want.
 
 Figure 9-10 shows the power-down options (Hibernate, Stand By, Turn 
Off, and Restart) available in Windows XP. Turn Off and Restart are the 
most commonly used; Turn Off turns off your computer completely, and 
Restart reboots the system, clearing everything in RAM so that you can 
start fresh.
 
Figure 9-10: 
Choose 
a power-
down 
option.
 
 
Not all Windows XP computers show the Hibernate option by default. If you 
don’t see Hibernate as one of the power-down options available to you, press 
and hold the Shift key when the power-down options are displayed. Standby 
should change to Hibernate, and then you can click that button to select it. If 
this method doesn’t work for you, display the Power Options dialog box, click 
the Hibernate tab, and make sure that the Enable Hibernation check box is 
selected.
Hibernate and Standby are two temporary power-down modes. You use them 
when you’re going to be away from your computer for a while, and you want 
to conserve power and suspend operation.
 
In Windows XP, the Hibernate option takes a little longer than Standby to 
resume, but it saves your data and conserves a significant amount of power. 
Standby mode in Windows XP is okay if you need to suspend operation for a 
little while (an hour or less), but be sure to save your files first. You won’t 
save much power by using Standby mode.
 
Another challenge for IT personnel when it comes to using Standby is that 
there’s no way for Standby to be controlled in any kind of group policy. Also, 
because Windows XP doesn’t have a mechanism that enables it to determine 
automatically when the system is idle, it doesn’t kick in automatically (as does 
Sleep mode in Windows Vista).

 Chapter 9: Optimize Your Computer Power Management
Saving Mac Power
No matter where your sympathies lie in the I’m-a-PC / I’m-a-Mac debate, you 
have to admit that Macs do a pretty good job with energy conservation. 
The newer Macs tend to run leaner than many popular PCs do, although all 
responsible manufacturers are working to shrink their carbon footprints and 
use safer materials in the systems they offer.
The Mac looks at power a little differently from its PC cousin, in that the Mac 
includes deep sleep and lighter sleep (Idle mode). When you step away from 
your Mac, after a brief period of inactivity the system goes into Idle mode. 
Then, after a further period, the computer goes to sleep.
Hushabye, little Mac
You use the Energy Saver dialog to set your preferences for when the Mac 
slips off to slumberland. Here are the steps:
 
1. In Mac OS X, choose Ú➪System Preferences.
 
 The System Preferences dialog opens. You’ll find the Energy Saver icon 
in the center of the Hardware settings.
Why Standby leaches electricity
Windows XP’s Standby mode is designed to 
let your computer take a little rest from pro-
cessing without making any drastic moves 
like saving files to disk. One of the nice things 
about Standby is that it doesn’t require a huge 
amount of disk storage space for file retrieval. 
By contrast, Hibernate mode requires a chunk 
of hard-drive space — roughly equivalent to the 
amount of RAM in your computer — so it can 
store the files you’re using when you choose 
Hibernate mode.
By virtue of this very fact — Standby doesn’t save 
items to disk — it must continually draw power to 
keep RAM awake and functioning. So in Standby, 
your computer never shuts down completely — 
which translates, for purposes of this discussion, 
to continuous energy consumption.
If your focus is on reducing the amount of power 
your computer uses and making the most of the 
battery life you have, and if you’re going to be 
away from your computer longer than an hour 
or so, use Hibernate instead of Standby. You 
may wait a few more seconds for the computer 
to wake up, and you may need to free some hard 
disk space that you’d rather use for something 
else. At the end of the day, though, Hibernate is 
a safer — and greener — choice.

190
Part III: Greener Under the Hood 
 
2. Click Energy Saver.
 
 The Energy Saver dialog opens (see Figure 9-11). In this dialog, you can 
optimize existing choices or customize power settings. Note that your 
Energy Saver dialog may look different from the one shown in Figure 9-11.
 
Figure 9-11: 
Display 
Energy 
Saver to 
manage 
Mac power.
 
 
3. From the Settings For pop-up menu, choose Power Adapter or Battery.
 
 The options displayed vary depending on whether you’re making 
choices for the AC source or your battery. You can set the sleep times 
you prefer for the different power sources.
 
4. Drag the slider to the amount of time you want to set for the Mac’s 
sleep time.
 
5. Drag the slider to reflect when you want the display to go to sleep.
 
Do less-energy-conscious people use your computer when you’re not looking? 
You can lock the power-management settings so other users can’t modify 
them: Just click the lock icon in the bottom-left corner of the Energy Saver 
dialog.

191
 Chapter 9: Optimize Your Computer Power Management
Choosing a Mac power plan
You can customize and then choose power management plans for the Mac 
by using the Energy Saver dialog box. Similar to Windows Vista (dare we say 
that out loud?), Mac OS X lets you choose the plan you want based on a bal-
ance of performance and power use. You can choose among the following 
power plans: Normal, Better Energy Savings, Better Performance, or Custom.
Follow the steps in the “Hushabye, little Mac” section earlier in this chapter 
to display the Energy Saver dialog, and click the arrow on the Optimization 
pop-up menu to display the list shown in Figure 9-12.
 
Figure 9-12: 
Customize 
your Mac 
power 
settings.
 
 
Click the Options tab to change the way your Mac goes to sleep (you can dim 
the monitor as Mac dozes off) and also to display the battery status on the 
menu bar.
Adding Power-Management Software
If you really like managing the way your computer uses power, you don’t 
have to stop with the power-management features your operating system 
offers you. Power-management software is available from other sources. The 
software makes it easy for you to keep an eye on the power you’re using, 
whether you’re watching your own system resources or coordinating the 
power for a whole department — or a whole company — of computers.
Power-management software can monitor a computer’s activity so that when 
the system goes into Idle mode, system resources are managed as effectively 
as possible. In a business, these power-saving strategies can add up and save 
a lot of money and energy — not to mention the headaches they can save the 
IT department when they run well!

Monitoring energy for free with Edison
Edison (www.edison.com) is a free, easy-to-use energy monitoring utility 
that helps you evaluate when you use the most PC power and create a sched-
ule for use. Versions of Edison are available for both Windows Vista and 
Windows XP.
As Figure 9-13 shows, you can set different power settings depending on 
the time of day and the types of tasks you’ll be using your computer to do. 
Edison shows you the amount of money, energy, and CO2 you’re saving with 
the energy choices you make, and it’s a great motivator for saving even more!

Reducing CO2 with Snap’s CO2 Saver
Snap’s CO2 Saver (http://co2saver.snap.com) is another free personal 
power management utility that lets you optimize your system’s power in its 
idle state. The tool works with both Windows XP and Windows Vista, display-
ing a running total of energy savings in a toolbar that includes a search fea-
ture you can customize.

193
 Chapter 9: Optimize Your Computer Power Management
As soon as you install CO2 Saver and set the power options the way you 
want them, the utility adjusts your Windows power management settings to 
maximize energy savings for your system. You can choose any of four power-
management levels: Mild, Medium, Aggressive, or Custom.
 
New energy-management gadgets are being developed all the time, so keep 
your eyes open for new utilities you can add to your Windows Vista Sidebar, 
download to your cellphone, or use on mobile devices to help you stay tuned 
in to your power consumption. Awareness is the first step in positive change, 
so you’re already improving your computing karma!

efore you do a double-take to check the title on the cover, we can 
assure you that the book you’re holding in your hands is Green Home 
Computing For Dummies? Why then, you may wonder, a chapter on mobile 
devices, when the focus is on the home?
To many of your gadgets, connecting with your home computer is, to them, 
the equivalent of resting their heads on the proverbial pillow at the end of the 
day. That’s because many of your gadgets depend on your home computer 
to do things like keep your contacts and calendar in sync, or transfer music 
and movies that you can watch on your gadgets on the sofa or the subway, or 
simply recharge their built-in batteries the greener way, by tapping into your 
computer’s USB port rather than bothering with the wall charger.
In this chapter, we focus mainly on your mobile phone and how you can 
adjust its power settings to save energy and extend battery life. We also tell 
you about green options for charging your mobile phone and other handheld 
gadgets, introduce you to mobile applications for tracking your carbon foot-
print, and turn you on to converting your mobile phone to an e-book reader 
or personal GPS navigator. We describe which eco-friendlier factors to look 
for when buying a new mobile phone, and we tell you how getting rid of your 
old phone and other gadgets by donating, selling, or properly recycling them 
when they’re no longer of use to you (or anyone else), is the right green 
gadget thing to do.

Welcome to your green gadgets home.
 
For the most complete coverage of all things gadget green, pick up a copy of 
Green Gadgets For Dummies, by Joe Hutsko (Wiley Publishing).
Getting a Handle on Energy-Saving 
Settings
If you turned to this chapter before reading any of the others, we probably 
know the reason: Blame it on the battery. Are we right?
Let’s face it: We’ve all done it, blaming, or perhaps cursing, our most essen-
tial gadget’s battery for running out of juice at the worst possible time. It 
might have happened in the middle of an important phone call or halfway 
through the motivating song you rely on to help push you to finish your run 
or workout. In the worst-case scenario, the battery dies, and it isn’t until you 
awaken later than usual and plug in your gadget again that you can call your 
boss and apologize for being late because your alarm didn’t go off.
One way to extend your gadget’s battery life between recharges is to adjust 
or turn off any energy-zapping features you’re not using — some of which 
you may not even know about. By doing so, your battery will last longer 
between charges.
General battery-draining features
You can less frequently blame your gadget’s battery for bringing your pro-
ductivity or playtime to a standstill if you pay attention to a few elements 
that most gadgets expend a lot of energy on — often gratuitously — to keep 
you happy.
 
Powerfully pleasing — but power-hungry — factors that have the biggest 
impact on how long batteries last between charges include the ones in this 
list:
 
✓ Screen: The screen, when putting on its brightest face possible, is 
generally the biggest drain on your gadget’s battery life. Adjusting the 
screen’s brightness setting to the lowest comfortable level and setting it 
to automatically dim or turn off after certain actions or periods of inac-
tivity helps extend your gadget’s overall battery life. How you access 
your screen’s brightness setting is unique to your gadget, but Figure 10-1 
shows an example.

197
 Chapter 10: Greening Mobile Devices
 
Figure 10-1: 
An example 
of a screen 
brightness 
setting.
 
 
✓ Sound: Lowering your gadget’s sound level lengthens battery life. 
Listening with headphones saves even more power. Shutting off sound 
completely if you aren’t using it offers even longer stretches of time 
between charges — but keep in mind that turning on your mobile 
phone’s vibrate feature taxes the battery every time it gives you that 
quiet buzzing feeling.
 
✓ Wireless: Turning off wireless features you’re not using extends battery 
life. The key culprits to look for are Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, GPS, and speedier 
data service network boosters such as EDGE and 3G. Turn off any of 
these that you’re not using, and then turn them on again only when you 
need them.
 
✓ Heat: Batteries drain faster when they’re hot rather than running warm or 
at room temperature. Extend your gadget’s battery life by keeping it away 
from too-hot places like car glove boxes or winter-warming radiators.
 
✓ Dirt: Dust, dirt, belly button fuzz, and other debris and impurities that 
can collect on your gadget’s battery contacts can hamper proper con-
tact and charging. Removing the rechargeable battery and gently clean-
ing exposed contacts with a cotton swab or dust-free cloth dipped in 
rubbing alcohol can help keep the battery’s internal connection strong 
and unencumbered.
The more specific energy-saving settings described in the following sec-
tions can help you eke out the longest battery life possible from your mobile 
phone.

198
Part III: Greener Under the Hood 
Saving energy on your mobile phone
This section’s heading is sort of a catchall because the reality is that many gad-
gets nowadays are catchalls themselves. Cellphones are giving way to smart-
phones, which not only make and receive calls, but also let you stay on top of 
your schedule and e-mail, browse the Web, listen to music, and watch movies. 
Of course, using some or all of these extra features means your mobile phone’s 
battery drains faster than just using it to make and receive calls.
If your cellphone’s ringtone is the only setting you’ve ever changed, getting 
to know its other settings and learning which ones to adjust can reward you 
longer stretches of time between recharges. Because settings differ from 
device to device, you may need to poke around to find the individual energy-
saving settings on your cellphone or smartphone.
Here are the top mobile phone battery-hogging energy settings you can 
adjust or turn off if you aren’t using them:
 
✓ On and Off: Powering off your phone when you know that you won’t use 
it for a while is the basic way to save power.
 
✓ Brightness: Turning down the brightness level to its dimmest (but still 
viewable) level can lengthen your gadget’s battery life. Activating your 
phone’s automatic screen dimming and shutoff options to dim or turn 
off the screen after fifteen seconds or so is another way to extend its 
battery life.
 
✓ Auto-Shutoff, Lock, and Sleep: Similar to the previous setting, setting 
your phone to automatically lock itself or go to sleep prevents it from 
waking up in your pocket if you accidentally bump it. You can typically 
also instantly lock your phone by pressing a button or combination of 
buttons; check your phone’s manual to find out how to instantly lock it 
on the fly.
 
✓ Volume: Turning down or shutting off your phone’s ringtone helps save 
battery life. Adjusting sound effects and alerts for other actions — such 
as receiving a text or e-mail message or activating your phone’s alarm 
clock — to the lowest level possible can also extend battery life.
 
✓ Vibrate: Turning on the vibrate feature can alert you to a call without 
making a sound, but keep in mind that vibrating uses battery juice if you 
let it vibrate continuously. Setting your phone to vibrate only once or a 
few times is an energy-saving option on many phones.
 
✓ Equalizer: One often-overlooked, battery-draining option to turn off, if 
your phone also plays music tracks, is its equalizer, or EQ. When turned 
on, this option makes your phone work harder to produce the sound-
quality effect you want.

199
 Chapter 10: Greening Mobile Devices
 
✓ Network: Sensing your wireless carrier’s phone network signal is a task 
that your phone does continually to keep you connected. Turning off 
your phone’s Network option when you’re in rural areas where recep-
tion is spotty or unavailable (but you’re still using your phone to do 
other things like listening to music or playing a game) can save power. 
Note that the Network option isn’t the same as the one you can use to 
connect to a Wi-Fi network and browse the Web on your mobile phone, 
however. (That option is next on our list, in case your phone has it.)
 
 Leaving the Network option on but turning off data networking enhance-
ments that give you faster Web access or clearer calls (if your phone has 
those options) can also help extend battery life. An often talked-about 
wireless carrier enhancement is 3G, which is an abbreviation for third 
generation.
 
✓ Wi-Fi: Turning off your phone’s Wi-Fi connection if you aren’t using it to 
browse Web pages, check e-mail, or download music can help extend 
battery life. Leaving Wi-Fi on if you regularly use it, but turning off the 
option to automatically search for and connect to any nearby Wi-Fi net-
works it discovers, is a good compromise for staying connected, while 
minimizing power consumption.
 
✓ Bluetooth: Connecting your phone to a Bluetooth handsfree headset 
saves you from having to hold the phone to your ear, but it also reduces 
talk time because it uses extra battery juice. Turning off Bluetooth when 
you’re not using it can give your phone markedly longer battery life.
 
✓ GPS: Continually tracking your location by using your phone’s global 
positioning system (GPS) feature is helpful for finding directions or 
locating a new restaurant in town. This helpful feature also drains your 
battery, so turn it off after you’ve reached your destination.
 
✓ Infrared: Although IR (infrared) was more common before Bluetooth 
arrived on the scene, some new gadgets, such as Palm’s Centro smart-
phone, are still equipped with the infrared option. If you’re not using the 
IR feature to beam your contact card to fellow IR-capable smartphone 
users, shut it off for battery savings.
Charging Your Gadgets 
with Green Power
Portable power chargers and extenders can help you keep your gadgets 
charged and usable when you’re away from a power outlet. The ones we 
describe here are eco-friendly because they rely on the sun (or wind) for a 
charge, or on good old-fashioned elbow grease to crank a dynamo.

200
Part III: Greener Under the Hood 
In other words, these gadgets turn natural energy (sometimes your energy 
when built-in cranks are what charge them) into energy you can use to power 
your gadgets. 
Many chargers can typically charge gadgets that use a USB cable to connect 
to their own rechargers or your computer. Some come with multiple charg-
ing plug tips so you can connect them to a variety of gadgets. Check with the 
Web sites of these few that we recommend to learn more about specifications 
and connection options for each: 
 
✓ Solio Magnesium Edition solar charger: Unfold the petals of this por-
table solar charger ($170; available at www.solio.com), shown in 
Figure 10-2, and you see three solar panels that soak up the sun to give 
renewed life to your gadget. Use the Solio to recharge MP3 players, cell-
phones, digital cameras, handheld video-game players, and many other 
gadgets. Fully charged, the Solio can recharge a typical mobile phone 
more than twice, or provide more than 20 hours of MP3 music.
 
Figure 10-2:

✓ Gaiam SideWinder cellphone charger: Connect your cellphone to the 
Gaiam SideWinder ($29) with the included cable and get cranking for up 
to six minutes of talk time after two minutes of winding. A built-in LED 
emergency light provides over five minutes of light after 30 seconds of 
cranking, and included adapter tips work with most models of Nokia, LG, 
Samsung, Kyocera, Sony/Ericsson and Motorola Razr phones. It’s avail-
able at www.gaiam.com.

201
 Chapter 10: Greening Mobile Devices
 
 Although the SideWinder isn’t meant for full-charge service, its tiny size 
makes it perfect for camping or other situations when power is out of 
reach and you need to reach out and call someone.
 
✓ Eclipse Solar Gear: The company offers a wide selection of backpacks, 
messenger bags, laptop and camera cases, and even a solar fishing-
tackle bag (from around $95 to $200). Although you can carry your note-
book in one of the Eclipse messenger bags, the company says that the 
solar panel can’t generate enough energy to charge it. It can, however, 
charge your cellphone, MP3 player, digital camera, or camcorder. Visit 
http://eclipsesolargear.com.
 
✓ HYmini wind-powered charger: Relying on the wind, rather than on you, 
is how the HYmini wind-powered charger ($50) generates power to juice 
up your MP3 player, digital camera, mobile phone, and other gadgets.
 
 What, no wind today? No worries. Connect the HYmini (visit www.
hymini.com for more information) to your bicycle’s handlebars or 
strap it to your upper arm with optional accessories and get pedaling 
or running to make some wind of your own as you go about your merry, 
green way. If you buy the optional solar panel, you can also use the sun 
to charge on windless and bicycle-free days.
 
✓ nPower PEG (http://greennpower.com): Pop the nPower PEG into 
your backpack (or attach it to your hip or leg), plug in your gadget, 
and presto — instant power, brought to you by you! Harvesting kinetic 
energy (in this case, up-and-down bodily movement) as you move about, 
nPower claims the PEG charges portable electronic gizmos at the same 
rate as a wall charger, which means an hour of walking can bring your 
iPod or other gadget’s charge to about 80 percent. As this book went to 
press, the nPower PEG was available for pre-order for about $150.
Running Mobile Applications 
to Monitor and Adjust Power
Downloading and running an application to monitor or adjust a gadget’s 
carbon footprint — and your own — can help you do “the greener thing” 
wherever you are. Check out these popular applications:
 
✓ greenMeter: This application for the iPhone and iPod touch helps lower

✓ Ecorio: Running on a Google Android-based mobile phone near you, 
Ecorio (find more information at http://ecorio.org) uses the 
phone’s GPS feature to track your personal carbon footprint. Choosing 
your mode of travel — car, bus, train, or bike — determines how seri-
ously green you are about getting around.
 
 Ecorio suggests carpool options by matching drivers and passengers, 
lets fellow green-gadgeteers keep tabs on one another (in the same town 
or across the country), and offers an option to buy carbon offsets by 
way of Carbonfund.org.
 
✓ Carbon-Meter: Coming soon to Google Android and Blackberry smart-
phones, the iPhone version of Carbon-Meter (visit www.viralmesh.
com/carbon-meter) rewards your green activities and efforts with cou-
pons and specials sponsored by local advertisers, as shown in Figure 10-3. 
Run, walk, or bike your way to increase your ecosavings — and your sav-

Turning Your Mobile Phone 
into a GPS Navigator
A global positioning system (GPS) navigator in your car can help you get 
where you’re going in the most fuel- and time-efficient manner. To find out 
more about GPS technology and products, check out GPS For Dummies, 2nd 
Edition, by Joel McNamara (Wiley Publishing).
The GPS mapping programs bundled with mobile phones (such as T-Mobile’s 
G1 or Apple’s iPhone) don’t typically offer spoken turn-by-turn directions or 
some of the other features found on dedicated navigators like the ones used 
in cars. They do offer scalable color maps and point-to-point directions.
Of course, you can always add turn-by-turn voice directions to your mobile 
phone — for a price — by buying or subscribing to, then installing, GPS navi-
gator programs on your mobile phone or PDA.
 
If your mobile phone doesn’t have built-in GPS, you can still run these pro-
grams by purchasing an optional (and external) Bluetooth GPS receiver.
Mobile GPS navigator applications that like to be seen and heard include:
 
✓ amAze: This free GPS navigation program has turn-by-turn voice direc-
tions, for a variety of GPS-equipped smartphones and PDAs, including 
Blackberry, LG, Samsung, Sony Ericsson, and Windows Mobile. Visit 
http://amazegps.com.
 
✓ ALK CoPilot Live 7: Provides natural voice directions in 20 languages 
on a number of Pocket PC or Windows Mobile smartphones. Check out 
http://alk.com.
 
✓ MapQuest Mobile Navigator: Voice-guided GPS navigation service is 
offered by several of the major wireless carriers for about $50 per year. 
(For more information, go to http//:wireless.mapquest.com/
mapquest-navigator or contact your mobile service provider.)
 
✓ TeleNav GPS Navigator: This one is available from all major mobile 
carriers for around $10 per month for unlimited service. TeleNav (go to 
http://telenav.com) provides turn-by-turn driving directions, both 
onscreen and by voice, on a number of popular GPS-equipped mobile 
phones, including Blackberry, HTC, Motorola, Palm, and other models.
By adding GPS navigation to your phone instead of buying a dedicated 
device, you can not only save money, but also do more with the device you 
already have, which is always the green way to go.

Reading E-books on Your Mobile Phone
Reading e-books on Amazon’s Kindle 2 dedicated e-book reader is a green 
gadget alternative to buying traditional books. Choosing more e-books means 
that less trees are felled to mill paper that would wind up bound in a printed 
book. E-books also reduce the other drains on the planet’s resources associ-
ated with printing and distributing books. At the same time, it’s worth noting 
the materials used to manufacture e-book readers, and the servers that 
you download e-books from, will still have an environmental impact via the 
resources and energy used to create and use them.
Yet as sleek and eco-friendly as the Kindle 2 is, why introduce yet another 
gadget into your life when you may not need to? Chances are good that you 
already own an excellent e-book reader without realizing it: your cellphone, 
smartphone, or PDA. Browsing, downloading, and reading free and competi-
tively priced e-books on your handheld gadget is merely a matter of installing 
an e-book reader program.
Here are a few mobile e-book reader programs and electronic bookstores 
that enable you to browse and download e-books for free or for a price:
 
✓ Mobipocket Reader (www.mobipocket.com) runs on mobile phones 
and PDAs that run on the Windows Mobile, Palm OS, Symbian, and 
Blackberry operating systems. Downloading titles to your computer 
and then installing them on your mobile device is required for all but 
the Blackberry version of the program. Downloading books over the air, 
directly to your Blackberry, means you can skip the computer middle-
man step.
 
 The Mobipocket Reader Web site also offers news and other RSS feeds. 
Tapping into them to create your own, customized electronic newspaper 
can keep you up-to-date on news and other topics when you’re on the go.
 
✓ Feedbooks (www.feedbooks.com), the universal e-reading platform, 
is compatible with a wide range of mobile phones and PDAs. Download 
titles directly to your mobile phone or PDA by opening http://
feedbooks.mobi with your gadget’s Web browser.
 
✓ Stanza (www.lexcycle.com) is an iPhone and iPod touch reader, with 
the ability to connect to numerous online bookstores to download free 
and for-sale books, including Feedbooks, Fictionwise, Project Gutenberg, 
SmashWords, and a number of mainstream publishers.
 
✓ eReader (www.ereader.com) is an e-book reader program that runs on 
Windows and Mac desktops and notebooks, as well as on many mobile 
devices running Windows Mobile, Pocket PC, Palm OS, or Symbian oper-
ating systems.

205
 Chapter 10: Greening Mobile Devices
 
 The iPhone and iPod touch edition of eReader can download titles 
directly from your online bookshelf account that you registered with 
either eReader.com, Fictionwise.com, or both.
 
eReader on the iPhone is one of the authors’ favorite way to read e-books. The 
text is beautifully crisp, and the display is large and easy enough on his eyes 
that he prefers reading on the iPhone to reading on a larger, dedicated reader 
such as the Kindle 2.
Another reason for this preference is the backlit iPhone display, which is 
pleasant to read in bed with the lights turned off. Like real books, the Kindle 2 
and most other dedicated e-book readers are readable only when the lights are 
turned on, or in daylight.
Dialing In to Green Mobile Phones
You can’t turn on the TV, open a magazine, or listen to the radio without 
hearing about this product’s green benefits or that company’s efforts in 
improving the planet by being green. That’s because every company under 
the sun wants to be seen as green. It’s the It thing of our era. Sorting through 
what’s real and what’s hype isn’t so glamorous and can be dizzying.
Choosing the greenest mobile phone starts with you researching the latest 
models on the Web. Opening your Web browser and going to www.google.
com to search for greenest cellphone or greenest mobile phone can turn up a 
number of results that point to articles or product pages for mobile phones 
claiming the title.
Knowing whether the claims are still current (or, for that matter, accurate) 
can be tricky. Was the claim staked last week — or last year?
 
You can narrow your Google search results to show only recent hits: Go to 
www.google.com/advanced_search and then click the link that says Date, 
Usage Rights, Numeric Range, and More. Click the Date arrow and select the 
Past 24 Hours, Past Week, or Past Month option.
Another way to find environmentally friendly mobile devices is to check out 
the latest Greenpeace Guide to Greener Electronics report (available at www.
greenpeace.org/electronics).
At the time this book was written, the report gave top honors to the Nokia 
6210 Navigator smartphone, followed by the Sony Ericsson G900. Both 
devices are PVC-free, but the Nokia gadget earned extra credits for its better 
energy efficiency and lifecycle.

Part III: Greener Under the Hood 
The four mobile phones listed in the text that follows further illustrate what 
it means to be a significantly green gadget.
Motorola MOTO W233 Renew
Motorola states that the MOTO W233 Renew is the world’s first carbon-
neutral cellphone, thanks in part to a plastic housing made entirely from 
recycled water bottles. The phone ships in a small package, and it and all 
the printed materials inside it are made from 100 percent post-consumer 
recycled paper.
As the first mobile phone to earn Carbonfund.org’s CarbonFree Certification, 
Motorola’s alliance with Carbondfund means that the company offsets the 
amount of carbon dioxide used to manufacture, distribute, and operate the 
phone.
Other green perks the MOTO W233 Renew serves up include:
 
✓ Long-lasting charge: Motorola estimates that you can expect up to nine 
hours of talk time — which means less tapping in to the recharger and 
more energy savings for you.
 
✓ Tree planting: Furthering the phone’s eco-friendly theme, mobile carrier 
T-Mobile will plant a tree in your name if you sign up for the company’s 
paperless billing option. Partnering with the Arbor Day Foundation, 
T-Mobile reportedly planted more than a half-million trees in 2008.
 
✓ Easy recycling: To recycle the phone at the end of its life, you can just 
drop it off at the nearest T-Mobile phone store, or mail it in using a mail-
ing label you create on the T-Mobile or Motorola Web sites.
 
✓ Ongoing sustainability: Proceeds gained from T-Mobile’s handset-
recycling efforts contribute to the company’s social investments, and 
to schools participating in Race to Recycle, which is part of T-Mobile’s 
sustainability practice.
Although the MOTO W233 Renew was offered exclusively to T-Mobile custom-
ers for six months after it launched in early 2009, your carrier may offer the 
green mobile phone by the time you read this. To find out, visit your carrier’s 
Web site and browse the selection of mobile phones it supports and sells. For 
more on the MOTO W233 Renew, go to www.motorola.com.

Samsung solar-rechargeable 
Blue Earth mobile phone
Designed to look like a flat, well-rounded, shiny pebble, Blue Earth will be the 
world’s first solar-rechargeable touch-screen phone when it reaches produc-
tion. A solar panel on the back of the phone can generate enough power to 
make calls and charge the battery.
The gadget is made from recycled plastic extracted from water bottles, and 
both the phone and its charger — which draws fewer than 0.03 watts after it 
charges the phone — are free from toxic substances, including brominated 
flame retardants (BFRs), beryllium, and phthalates.
The Eco mode option adjusts the brightness, backlight duration, and 
Bluetooth energy efficiency settings with a single touch. The Eco Walk func-
tion counts your steps with a built-in pedometer and calculates how much 
CO2 emissions you reduce by hoofing it rather than driving. Go to www.
samsung.com.
Nokia 3110 Evolve and N79 eco
Featuring biocovers made from more than 50 percent renewable materials 
and a charger that draws 94 percent less power than Energy Star requires, 
the Nokia 3110 Evolve is a good example of a green mobile phone — in part 
because the 3110 Evolve charger notches down power consumption to next-
to-nil after the phone is all charged up.
Charging the Nokia N79 eco when you take it out of its minimal, eco-friendly 
box isn’t an option — unless you plug in a charger you already own. Nokia, 
figuring that it’s greener to reuse an existing charger, doesn’t include one 
with the N79 eco.
Neither phone was available in the U.S. at the time this book was written, 
but buyers in the United Kingdom can feel good knowing that Nokia donates 
4 pounds sterling to the World Wildlife Fund for each N79 eco it sells. Visit 
www.nokia.com.

Disposing of Gadgets the Green Way
When it’s time to get rid of a gadget such as a smartphone that’s broken 
beyond repair (or too expensive to fix) — or that you’re replacing because 
you just have to have the newest model that came out, for reasons all 
your own — it’s time to consider the three Rs: Reduce, reuse, recycle. Just 
because you want to get rid of something doesn’t automatically translate 
to invoking the third R — recycle. Not in the classical sense of, say, hauling 
piles of old newspapers out to the curb on pick-up day. That’s because when 
we talk about recycling a gadget, we don’t necessarily mean it will be broken 
down into parts and ground up, melted, or otherwise destroyed.
When it comes to gadgets, the terms recycle and reuse are sometimes inter-
changeable. For example, if you have someone repair or update a working 
gadget or computer that you don’t want or need and then put it back into 
someone else’s hands, that process qualifies as both recycling and reusing.
Why do we talk more about trying to reuse or repurpose gadgets instead of 
sending them off to a recycler? Well, we think there’s a bonus fourth R — 
rethinking. Think about recycled paper. It comes from existing paper that is 
collected, processed, and then repurposed as new paper. By selling a gadget 
or giving it away, you’re repurposing it, but you’re also essentially recycling 
it. What’s cool here is that you’re skipping the processing part of breaking 
down a gadget the way a recycler would when the gadget has truly reached 
its end. What’s more, reusing or repurposing a gadget means not having to 
purchase a new product to replace it, which in turn means you’re reducing 
the resources and energy required to manufacture, package, ship, and use a 
new gadget.
 
Looking to just unload your mobile phone or gadget’s dead recyclable battery 
and not the device itself? Point your Web browser to www.rbrc.org to 
search the Rechargeable Battery Recycling Corporation’s Call2Recycle data-
base for a drop-off center near you.
Erasing your personal information
Before we list your options for getting rid of gadgets the green way, some-
thing you don’t want recycled is any personal information you might have 
stored on a gadget you’re saying goodbye to. Most repurposing programs 
promise to securely erase your personal information from your gadgets 
before they send them to their eventual recipients. 

209
 Chapter 10: Greening Mobile Devices
On some cell phones or PDAs, erasing personal data and settings is often 
accomplished by tapping a few keys or holding down a button or three while 
powering on the gadget. Voilà! The gadget then has straight-from-the-factory 
freshness and is ready to start a new personally rewarding relationship with 
a fresh face (and fingertips) — just like it was when you turned on the gadget 
for the first time.
If you’re unsure how to completely erase your personal information from 
your mobile phone, let your fingers do the walking to the nearby sidebar, 
“Zapping your personal information from your mobile phone.”
Getting rid of mobile phones and gadgets
Here are the most common options for getting rid of your broken or 
unwanted, but still useable, mobile phones and gadgets:
 
✓ Wireless provider’s retail store: Drop off your working but unwanted 
mobile phone so that it can be repurposed or properly recycled. (Don’t 
forget the charger and any accessories you no longer want.)
 
✓ Gadget manufacturer’s Web site: Check to find out more about the 
manufacturer’s take-back, trade-in, and recycling programs.
 
✓ Donations: Several organizations gladly accept unwanted cellphones 
so that victims of domestic abuse, the elderly, or other persons in need 
can call 911 at no charge. Cellphones can also be reset to provide free or 
limited service for those in need, or sold to raise funds for not-for-profit 
groups, charities, or causes. Four cellphone donation organizations are
Zapping your personal information 
from your mobile phone
If the gadget you’re giving away is a mobile 
phone, smartphone, or MP3 player that has no 
built-in hard drive, erasing your past is a cinch.
Restoring most mobile phones to factory fresh-
ness generally requires keying in a series of 
symbols and numbers and then pressing the 
Call button to carry out the wipeout.
On the other hand, you zap a Palm smartphone 
and PDA by holding down a button while power-
ing on the device. On some devices, choosing an 
option from the device’s Settings menu erases 
and restores the gadget to factory freshness.
Check the manual’s index for the word resetting 
or restoring or erasing, or search the Web for 
your particular device and the phrase factory 
restore or factory reset.

• Call to Protect: This national philanthropic program is aimed at 
combating domestic violence. All donated phones are sent to the 
group’s partner, ReCellular, where they’re refurbished and sold or 
recycled, and one hundred percent of the net proceeds are used 
for grants to national organizations working to end family violence. 
All phones donated that are obsolete or damaged are recycled 
according to strict environmental standards. Visit www.wireless
foundation.org/calltoprotect.
 
• Cell Phone Trade-Ins: This site lets you dispose of your cellphone 
and help those in need, or just pad your wallet a little bit with cash. 
The service also welcomes iPod trade-ins. Either way, check the site 
to see whether your phone or iPod model is one they want. If so, 
you can print a prepaid label to mail your unwanted gadget to Cell 
Phone Trade-Ins, and soon thereafter, you’ll get a check in the mail if 
you opted for payment. Go to http://cellphonetradeins.com.

donation on your behalf in exchange for your unwanted cellphone, 
pager, or PDA. Charity choices include The United Way, The 
Red Cross, Friends of the Congo, and several others. Go to www.
collectivegood.com.
 
• Wirefly.org: Wirefly.com’s sister site claims that it sells more cell-
phones every day than any other online authorized dealer. So it’s 
only fitting that its dot-org site offers a trio of options for getting 
rid of your unwanted cellphone: recycling for charity, donating 
(via Cell Phone Trade-Ins), and paying you cash. Charities include 
the ASPCA (American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to 
Animals), Livestrong, Sierra Club, and several others. Visit www.
wirefly.org.
 
✓ Electronics trade-in Web sites: Visit www.eztradein.com to see 
whether your still-working but unwanted gadgets can earn you cash or 
credit toward a new purchase. Three more trade-in sites are
 
• BuyMyTronics: Trade in your iPod, cellphone, PDA, video game 
machine, laptop, digital camera, or camcorder and get a check in 
the mail a few days after BuyMyTronics (http://buymytronics.

tronic funds transfer by way of PayPal instead of getting a check in 
the mail makes your exchange of unwanted gadgets for e-cash all the 
more green.
 
• Consumer Electronics Recycling: Accepts trade-ins of working or 
broken cellphones, smartphones, PDAs, iPods, and Zune media 
players, and assuming that your gadget is in the condition you say 
it is, the company sends your check within as little as one or two 
business days. That’s fast money! Visit www.cerecycle.com.

✓ Your local newspaper’s classified ads or an Internet auction: Sell 
your unwanted gadgets, computers, and other working but unwanted 
electronic products in your local newspaper’s ads or on the community 
classified Web site Craigslist, or you can sell or auction them on eBay or 
another auction Web site, such as the following:
 
• Bonanzle: Bonanzle (www.bonanzle.com) refers to itself as an 
online marketplace for buying and selling items faster while having 
more fun, stating that its specialty is “helping you buy and sell 
items that aren’t shiny, new, and mass-produced.” Posting items 
is free, and Bonanzle charges low final offer value fees that range 
from fifty cents for items under $10, and $1, $3, and $5 for items 
under $50, $100, and $1000, respectively. Anything more than that 
costs sellers only $10.
 
• eBid: Charging no listing fee and a final value fee of only three 
percent to basic free members, the growing eBid member base 
(http://ebid.net) makes it worth taking a look at. eBid elimi-
nates the final value fee for members who pay for Seller+ privileges 
for as little as $1.99 per week to $59.99 per year. At the time of this 
writing, eBid.net has a lifetime Seller+ membership offer for $49.99.
 
• PlunderHere: This company (www.plunderhere.com) says that 
its goal is to become the go-to marketplace for buyers and sellers. 
With no fee for listing items and a small final value fee from .01 
to 2.5 percent, it may well be where you go to sell your gadgets. 
PlunderHere also charges small fees for listing options, such as 
adding video, or for spotlighting your item on the site.
 
✓ A nearby or nationwide reputable recycler of e-waste (e-cycler): 
Properly disposing of broken or otherwise hopelessly useless electron-
ics rather than throwing them in the trash reduces potential hazards 
to the environment, and it may also reduce waste if parts and materials 
can be extracted and reused or manufactured into new products. Visit 
Earth911.com — which calls itself “your one-stop shop for all you need 
to know about reducing your impact, reusing what you’ve got, and recy-
cling your trash” — to find an e-cycler near you. Other ways to find an 
e-cycler include
 
• Your state or city Web site: Most states follow the .gov Web site 
address format. For instance, typing www.nj.gov will take you 
to one of the authors’ home state’s Web site, where a search on 
recycle turns up links to a directory of statewide recyclers.

W
e can all agree that technology is fundamentally a good thing. It saves 
lives. It makes you more productive. And it can help you reduce the 
size of your carbon footprint significantly — and that makes the planet smile.
As with anything else in life, getting the real green benefit from technology 
involves keeping things in balance. Not overdoing it with the power supplies. 
Not indulging in the latest-and-greatest machinery just because it’s the new 
thing. Weighing out wants and needs and coming up with some sort of rea-
soned, rational decision about your green efforts.
We know that doesn’t sound particularly exciting.
Anyone who has been on this planet awake for any amount of time knows 
that life isn’t all logic — perhaps not even mostly logic. There are reason-
able, fact-based reasons to weigh our actions in terms of how they impact 
the global climate, just as we consider our behaviors and words before we 
inadvertently do something we’ll regret. But there are also heart reasons 
(“the heart has reasons that reason does not know” — Voltaire) that have to do 
more with being part of this blossoming life and less about how to manage it.
This chapter takes a rather ho-hum idea (reduce your number of print jobs 
and make the planet a greener place) and looks closer, exploring all the dif-
ferent ways you can use technology to streamline what you do and reduce 
the impact you’re making on the environment. And the big payoff is not a 
number but a feeling — that sense that through simple, thoughtful, caring 
actions, you are part of the greening of your planet. And that makes us all 
breathe a little easier.

Rate How Much Your Printer Eats
The thing you have going for you as a home computer user is that it’s likely 
you don’t depend too awfully much on your printer as it is. You may print the 
following things:
 
✓ Letters and reports
 
✓ Schoolwork for the kids
 
✓ Copies of Web pages you want to keep
 
✓ Spreadsheets and bookkeeping items
If you run a small business from your home, your printer tasks may increase 
exponentially. You will likely have
 
✓ Business planning documents
 
✓ Reports for professional service providers (such as your accountant, 
your attorney, a business consultant, and so on)
 
✓ Spreadsheets for financial reporting
 
✓ Payroll and tax reports
 
✓ Letters to clients, vendors, and contacts
 
✓ Marketing materials for your business
What you might not know is that the average office worker in the United 
States uses 10,000 sheets of paper per year. And, ramping it up, the U.S. — 
which has roughly 5 percent of the world’s population — uses 30 percent of 
the world’s paper.
To capture a picture of your current printing habits, make a list of all the 
things you print. If you can’t think of everything, just go about your day, 
week, or month and make notes as you go. When you’re ready, use the follow-
ing questions to get a sense of how you use your printer. You can then make 
a plan to weed out any unnecessary printing you’re inadvertently doing:
 
✓ Which items must you print?
 
✓ What printouts are really optional?
 
✓ Have you made any printouts that you’re not sure how to classify as nec-
essary or optional?

215
 Chapter 11: Print Less, Breathe More
Understanding the Impact of Paper
It’s super-easy to grab a stack of paper, put it in the printer, and print chap-
ters, reports, presentations, spreadsheets, Web pages, and more. Need 
directions to the dollar store? Use MapQuest and print the directions. Simple 
enough.
The trouble is that paper comes from trees, and manufacturing that paper 
uses up a lot of valuable resources. In fact, consider these manufacturing 
factoids:
 
✓ It takes one and a half cups of water (imagine a can of soda) to make 
every single sheet of paper you use.
 
✓ Roughly 40 percent of all wood pulp created goes to the production of 
paper.
 
✓ Paper makes up 25 percent of the garbage tossed into landfills — even 
with current recycling efforts.
 
Here’s a staggering statistic: According to the Environmental Defense Fund, 
creating one ton of virgin, uncoated paper uses three tons of wood, over 19,000 
gallons of water, and produces almost 2,300 pounds of solid waste.
Choosing Good Print Alternatives
Not long ago, people printed everything. Did you purchase something online? 
You probably printed the receipt. Did you create a spreadsheet to set up a 
household budget? You probably printed it out and filed it away.
We filed everything: printed letters, e-mails from friends, recipes, reports.
Lots of paper. Lots of accordion folders. Where are they now? In a landfill 
somewhere? Or up in the attic, collecting dust?
Many people — especially Baby Boomers — like the feeling of having some-
thing tangible in their hands. That means paper, books, and CD cases. While 
that’s understandable, it may also be a luxury we really don’t need, if the 
tradeoff is mowing down forests full of trees to provide backup printed 
copies for things we don’t really need anyway.

216
Part III: Greener Under the Hood 
What we need for good print alternatives
People who argue for keeping backup printed copies of everything often have 
a good reason for their argument — they don’t want to lose valuable stuff. 
When it comes to legal documents, important household papers, and ideas 
and documents you just don’t want to trust to electronic media, fine — print 
it out.
But as a matter of course, there are other ways you can safeguard your 
important files without pulverizing trees to preserve them. Here’s what we 
need to know about the files we save if we store them only in electronic 
format:
 
✓ The files are stored on media that won’t be obsolete in a few years.
 
✓ The files we write today we’ll be able to read tomorrow.
 
✓ The files will be easy to access and safe no matter how technology may 
change.
The PDFs Have It
In recent years (especially since the introduction of Microsoft Office 2007), 
saving, sending, receiving, and opening PDF files has become easier. PDF 
stands for Portable Document Format, and that’s just what it is — a format 
that enables people to view your document with the correct format (just as 
you saved it), no matter what type of computer they may be using to view it. 
You can install free software — such as the Microsoft Office 2007 PDF add-in 
or CutePDF — and print your document to a PDF file instead of printing to 
your printer.
Depending on the software you have installed, some PDFs can also be edit-
able. You can even embed links in the document so people who receive your 
document can click links and go to your Web site, find another document, 
launch a presentation, or do whatever else you want to rig in there.
The point is that you can do a lot today with PDFs and they provide a por-
table, easy, and low-footprint way to share professional-looking documents 
with others. People who receive your PDFs can print them if they choose (we 
hope they don’t, though, right?) and you’ll never miss the fact that you didn’t 
print the document for them.

Collaborating with online documents
Another development in the last couple of years involves working collabora-
tively with shared workspaces online. This type of online collaboration enables 
multiple users to view, edit, comment on, and revise a single electronic docu-
ment. This saves probably not just one printout but many — think how many 
individuals might print, mark up, and revise a document while working as 
a team.
One example of this kind of document collaboration is offered by Office Live 
Workspaces, a free tool that enables multiple users to upload, modify, share, 
and assign document- or project-related tasks. (See Figure 11-1.) For more 
about online collaboration tools, see Chapters 15 and 16.

Why Duplexing Is Good for the Planet
Duplex printing is big — in fact, it’s so big that it is now part of the Energy 
Star standards for new printers. In order to be considered Energy Star-
compliant (which means the manufacturer can put an Energy Star logo on 
the printer packaging), the company needs to demonstrate that the printer is 
capable of duplex printing.

218
Part III: Greener Under the Hood 
So is a duplex like a double-sided condo? Well, you got the “double-sided” 
right. When a printer is capable of duplex printing, it can print on both sides 
of the page. This may seem like an impossible task for your low-end HP all-in-
one printer, but you may be surprised just how easy this is to do.
Setting up duplex printing
To set your printer up for duplex printing when using Windows, follow these 
steps:
 
1. In your favorite word processing program (we’re using Word 2007 
here), choose File➪Print.
 
 The Print dialog box appears, offering you all kinds of choices about 
how much, where, and what to print.
 
2. In the Printer Name: box, make sure your printer is displayed.
 
 If your printer name doesn’t appear in the box, click the down-arrow and 
choose your printer from the list.
 
3. Click the Properties button.
 
 The Properties dialog box appears, displaying the Printing Shortcuts 
tab. Click the down-arrow labeled What do you want to do? to display 
the range of options for your printer. (See Figure 11-2.) Note that the 
items you see in that list will depend on the capabilities of your installed 
printer.
 
4. Click Two-sided (Duplex) Printing.
 
 The options in the dialog box change slightly to reflect your choice.
 
5. Click the Print On Both Side down-arrow and choose Left Edge 
Booklet.
 
6. Click OK.
 
 The changes are saved with your printer preferences, and the Print 
dialog box appears once again. If you’re ready to print something as a 
test and you have a test document open on the screen, you can click OK 
and print it. Otherwise click Close.

Doing a Double-Take: Duplex Printing
So it sounds fancy, like something only people 
who speak copy-machine lingo can adequately 
describe, but it’s really pretty simple. Duplex 
printing is just printing on both sides of the 
page.
Some printers are equipped to do this easily — 
the technology supports the process so the 
page is fed back through the printer (with the 
help of software) and the next page prints like 
a dream on the other side of the paper. Office-
quality printers are sure to be able to handle 
duplex printing, but you may be surprised to 
know that many ordinary home printers — in 
particular, laser printers and all-in-one print-
ers — are able to do this as well. 
Of course, you don’t have to have a duplex 
printer to print documents and use both sides 
of the page. You can print the odd-numbered 
pages first, turn the printed pages over, and 
then print the even-numbered pages. This is 
known as simplex printing, and even though it 
takes a little patience, it’s a good way to save a 
few extra pages. You’ll get the hang of it.

Calculating duplex savings
You can check out how much money you’ll save — and how many trees will 
thank you — by calculating your duplex-printing savings at www.brother.
co.uk/g3.cfm/s_page/106450. Just plug in the amount of pages you cur-
rently print per week (this will be a higher number if you run a small busi-
ness from your home, but don’t worry). Figure 11-3 shows you the impact of 
duplexing one good book manuscript — and how much it can save.

You can find out about the whole range of duplex printers on the Energy Star 
site (www.energystar.gov), but these printers are popular because they 
are duplexers and they’re fast (which means they print more pages in less 
time — and that means energy savings):
 
✓ Canon PIXMA MP530
 
✓ HP Color LaserJet CM1017
 
✓ Lexmark E350d

Print . . . If You Must
So are there creative ways you can reduce your printing pattern and still make 
sure your electronic documents are just as good? With a few common-sense 
adjustments and some easy print techniques, you can reduce your paper con-
sumption by up to 50 percent (more if you run a small home business). Here 
are a few ways you can reduce the resources you’re using when — and if — 
you print:

221
 Chapter 11: Print Less, Breathe More
 
✓ Choose a shade of gray for printing to lessen the amount of black toner 
you use in that inkjet cartridge (it’s not as noticeable as you may think).
 
✓ Reduce the print size (if your eyes can take it) to fit more on a page.
 
✓ Go even smaller and use booklet-style printing (reduced-size and double-
sided, mind you) to reduce paper consumption even further (you may 
need to buy a magnifying glass or get longer arms, though).
To print more than one page on a single page of paper, follow these steps:
 
1. Prepare your document as usual and choose File➪Print.
 
 The Print dialog box appears.
 
2. Click the Pages Per Sheet down-arrow and choose the number of 
pages you want to print on one page. (See Figure 11-4.)
 
Figure 11-4: 
You can 
print mul-
tiple pages 
on one page 
if your eyes 
can stand it.
 
 
 Unless you have a superhero’s vision powers, you probably won’t want 
to choose more than 2 pages per page if you plan to read the document 
fairly comfortably. If you simply want thumbnails that display the gen-
eral format of each page, choose as many as you want.
 
3. Click OK.
 
 The document prints as usual — except you have more than one page 
(as it would be in traditional-size duplex printing) printed on your paper. 
This means you get double the printing for half the page use. Nice.

Tree-Saving Printing Tips
Sure, there are going to be things you still need to print. Here’s a set of tips to 
help you make the most of what you do print when you feel the need:
 
✓ Set your print expectations. Only you know how many pages are too 
many — but think through what you want to print before you print it — 
and then do your best to stick to that.
 
✓ Have a standard for what’s okay to print and what isn’t. If you’re not 
sure where to start, begin with the basics. Agree with the family not to 
print Web pages, e-mail messages, or silly photos of animals with large 
eyes.
 
✓ Keep the printer unplugged until you need it. This may seem like a 
pain but it will make you think twice about whether you really need to 
print . . . and it will conserve energy that your printer may be sipping 
while not in use.
 
✓ Use recycled paper and recycled (or soy-based) ink cartridges. See the 
related sections in this chapter.
 
✓ Proofread and preview your document before you print it. (It’s an 
extra painful waste of paper when you have to throw out a document 
because of spelling or formatting errors.)
 
✓ Do a test print. When you have to print multiple copies of something, 
print one first to make sure it looks right before printing the whole job.
 
✓ Print only the pages you need. If you need only the table on page 2 in a 
20-page document, just print that page.
 
✓ Earn cartridge karma. Return your empty inkjet cartridges for recycling. 
We cover green cartridge practices later in this chapter.
 
✓ Give up hard-copy edits. Edit documents, reports, and presentations 
on-screen instead of printing them and marking them up on the page.
 
✓ Go electronic. Send documents by e-mail, in PDF format, whenever pos-
sible. Don’t print e-mail messages you receive. Save them electronically 
and include them in your regular backups. Fight the temptation to print 
Web pages; instead, save them to your Favorites folder.
 
✓ Make the page bigger. The margins of your document are probably set 
by default to 1.25 inches, all around the page. You can reduce the size of 
the margins to 1 inch and fit more words on the page.
 
✓ Change your type, change your life. Change the font and reduce the 
size to create a more compact document that is still readable. 

223
 Chapter 11: Print Less, Breathe More
 
✓ Turn any paper forms you use into electronic forms. You can easily do 
this in Word 2007 and there are a number of free online Web-form tools 
you can use as well.
 
✓ Duplex printing is double the fun. See the earlier section in this chapter.
 
✓ Use it again. Recycle your used paper (the backs of early drafts and 
saved documents) whenever possible.
 
✓ Get a whiteboard. Want to share notes, calendars, or messages with 
others in the family? Instead of printing items — or even writing them by 
hand on scrap paper — get a whiteboard and some colorful whiteboard 
pens. We all need a little more doodling in our lives anyway.
The Ins and Outs of Recycled Paper
Although we hear about recycled paper more often these days, in reality 
more than 90 percent of the printer and copier paper used today in busi-
nesses and homes is not recycled paper. 
Myths abound — but they are, in fact, myths — about recycled papers jam-
ming your printer, leaving a dusty residue, or smearing or smudging charac-
ters. In the early 1980s, when recycled papers were first becoming available, 
there was a slight drop in quality compared to non-recycled papers. But today 
that challenge is long gone — in fact, recycled papers are high-quality, avail-
able in a variety of forms (including letterhead, special sizes, and envelopes), 
and often are acid-free, which means a longer life and better appearance.
Also, printing with recycled paper can have a positive impact on the environ-
ment. When you use recycled paper, you
 
✓ Save trees, energy, water, and landfill space.
 
✓ Protect entire forests, wetlands, and natural systems.
 
✓ Reduce the amount of CO2 pumped into the atmosphere.
 
✓ Continue to offer energy and resource savings because the paper can be 
recycled over and over again.
 
✓ Reduce the use of toxic chemicals by choosing chlorine-free paper.
 
Go to any office-supply store and you’ll find a whole collection of recycled 
papers there, ready for your purchase. How can you tell one from another — 
and how do you know what you really need? Is this more greenwashing at 
work? A few details on the label can tell you what you need to know:

224
Part III: Greener Under the Hood 
 
✓ Postconsumer Waste (PCW): You’ll see some papers with 20 percent 
PCW somewhere on the page. PCW stands for “postconsumer waste” — 
and that means the waste that your neighbors put out at the curb (or 
take to the recycling center). So that paper you’re holding is made from 
cereal boxes, coffee filters, junk mail, and other products that went out 
with the trash a few weeks or months ago.
 
 Look for papers that are at least 30 percent PCW for a good green impact 
(with good-quality print). Look for the postconsumer waste symbol.
 
✓ Processed Chlorine Free (PCF): If paper were left to its own devices, it 
wouldn’t be white. To get the nice white page that stares back at you so 
invitingly, traditional paper manufacturers throw chlorine into the mix. 
When you see PCF on the wrapper of the paper you’re buying, it’s a good 
thing. It means no chlorine or chlorine-related chemicals were used in 
the making of that paper — this time around, anyway. And that means 
less bad stuff in the environment.
Greening Your Printer Supplies
Greening your printing practices at home involves more than simply unplug-
ging your printer until you need it and buying recycled paper (oh, yeah, and 
printing on both sides). In addition to your paper supply, you may also print 
family photos, invitations, postcards, birthday cards, brochures, mailing 
labels, and CD labels and covers.
Chances are that you’ll be able to find a recycled version of these various 
items — but if not, you can be inventive and recycle some of them from other 
things. (Well, okay, you may be out of luck on the photo paper.) Especially 
for artistic items like invitations, cards, and CD covers, you can piece 
together interesting images or create your own. And the recipients will love 
you all the more for it. (Really, we will.)
Recycling your print cartridges
A number of print vendors and office supply companies offer free cartridge 
recycling programs that enable you to put your used cartridge in a postage-
paid envelope and return it to the vendor for recycling and refilling. Staples 
offers Inkdrop, a free recycling program that makes it easy for you to send 
in your empty cartridges and receive a refilled one for free. The only thing 
you ever purchase is the cartridge that you refill. To find out more about 
the Staples Inkdrop program, go to http://tinyurl.com/dk62os. Other 

225
 Chapter 11: Print Less, Breathe More
office-supply companies have similar programs, so ask at the counter or visit 
your favorite store’s Web site for details on what it’s doing.
 
Why not make some green while you’re going green? Castle Ink (www.castle
ink.com) offers a recycling program for ink cartridges, offering up to $4 per 
cartridge for virgin cartridges.
What’s up with soy-based ink?
Yes, we know — soy is showing up in everything, but there’s a reason for 
that. Soy is a readily available, low-cost, and environmentally friendly option, 
an alternative to the toxic chemicals used in the petroleum-based inks used 
in standard print cartridges.
Regular inks contain VOCs (Volatile Organic Chemicals) that have been 
linked to health hazards, and pose a threat when they find their way into 
landfills on newsprint and other papers that are thrown away. Soy-based inks 
are made from soybeans — safe, biodegradable, and — well, edible. Other 
vegetable-based inks are also being used today, but both eco-friendly inksets 
are still used only by the commercial printing crowd. So when you need to 
have a yard sign printed or you have the neighborhood newsletter done at 
your local printer, ask whether they have soy-based inks available instead of 
the hard stuff.
Makes you wonder what an earth-friendly, sustainable ink might look like for 
our home printers, doesn’t it? An earth-friendly ink that is truly sustainable 
 
✓ Uses renewable resources.
 
✓ Creates less waste.
 
✓ Reduces VOC emissions.
 
✓ Is biodegradable.
 
✓ Doesn’t include additives.
This type of dream ink may not be available in your favorite inkjet cartridges 
yet, but keep your eyes open! It won’t be long.

onserve, conserve, conserve. Reduce, reduce, reduce. Think about what

that debit card or write that check, ask yourself whether you’re buying the 
greenest, most earth-friendly item you can.
Yes, you have a lot to weigh for what could be a simple, gotta-have-it pur-
chase. But you can see where our gotta-have-it lifestyle has brought us: to a 
world with brimming landfills, an atmospheric sauna, and a rapidly depleting 
supply of natural resources.
Gosh, that’s a depressing way to open a chapter.
The good news is that with some thoughtful planning, you can put together 
a home network that makes the best use of the resources you’ve got, cuts 
down on the resources you use, and makes safeguarding your data easier.
 
This chapter is just the tip of the melting iceberg when it comes to home 
networking capabilities, so be sure to get your hands on some references if 
you want to take things a step farther. For the latest info on home networks, 
check Web sites such as http://computer.howstuffworks.com/

with useful information for anyone who wants to set up a home network.

Sharing at Home: The Networked Way
We start this section with a little quiz. Which of the following is a home net-
work?
 
✓ A: A bunch of computers connected by telephone cords to wall outlets
 
✓ B: A set of systems, printers, monitors, and technological miscellanea all 
trading ones and zeros via wireless routers
 
✓ C: A group of computers and game systems connected by cable to all 
sorts of boxes and gizmos and switches
The answer is, none of the above! A bunch of systems connected to a router 
(see the sidebar “Network lingo,” later in this chapter) to get access to the 
Internet doesn’t necessarily make for a very sharing network. Oh, it’s consid-
ered a network, all right, but if you are not currently sharing resources on the 
network you have, you’re missing the big, green boat.
This section gives you the big picture on home networking, providing 
resources, a smattering of procedures, and some great references to use 
when you do the deep dive.
Benefits of networking
If you have more than one computer in the house, a network will help you 
reduce the resources you’re using by reducing each computer’s power use. 
Other benefits include
 
✓ Peripheral sharing: When your systems are networked, you can easily 
share the printer; scanner; and even DVD, CD, or hard drive on any 
system in the house. (See Chapter 7 for the lowdown on peripherals.)
 
✓ Media sharing: Here’s a neat idea. You’ve got a great collection of MP3 
files on your main system, and your teenage daughter is having a slee-
pover in the family room tonight. Instead of burning all the Jonas Brothers 
tunes to CD and taking the disc downstairs for the kids to play on the 
family-room computer, you can simply turn on the network and let the 
girls access the media files on the hard drive of the main system upstairs. 
They’ll have a great slumber party, complete with tunes. No hassle. Nice.
 
✓ Backups: You can store all your valuable files in a single location on the 
network and copy them to an external hard drive or another backup 
storage device. The difference between a network backup and a single 
computer backup is that you back up all of the computers to one central 
location. Using this approach means that you can share a back-up pro-
cess between all computers, saving both time and money.

229
 Chapter 12: Seamless Sharing across Systems
The big green bottom line is that you can reduce the number of devices you 
use by storing files in one central location and using the other systems and 
peripherals only when you need them. You’ll see a dip in your power con-
sumption, extend the life of the computers and peripherals, and store your 
important files in one easy-to-find spot. Simplicity is good — and green.
Types of networks
Networking sounds a lot harder than it really is. When you use your cell-
phone, you’re accessing a network. (You’ve seen the commercials.) When 
you turn on your lights, you’re using power that flows through what could 
be said to be a utility network. Things are connected to other things, so 
resources flow from one thing to another (and vice versa). That’s a network.
When you set up a home network so that your computers can talk to one 
another and share resources, you have three basic types of networks to 
choose among. The type you choose depends largely on the type of technol-
ogy you have (or want).
Here are the basic three:
 
✓ Ethernet: An Ethernet network is a setup in which the various computers 
are connected by cables. Yes, that’s right — geeky gray or black (occa-
sionally white, blue, or yellow) cords stretching under rugs, over door 
frames, and around corners. Ethernet is fast, however, so it was the net-
working standard until wireless muscled its way into the picture.
 
✓ Wireless: A wireless network is the kind you can access at places like 
Panera Bread and Starbucks. You take your laptop in with you and open 
the lid. Instantly, the system searches for a wireless connection; when 
it finds one, it asks whether you want to connect. A home wireless net-
work works the same way. It’s simple, invisible, and flexible, with no 
cables to trip over or to keep the cat from chewing through. Wireless 
networks are very popular (and won’t be losing that popularity any time 
soon) because of the sheer freedom they offer.
 
✓ HomePNA: A HomePNA (HPNA) network is a network that’s created 
throughout your house, using the phone lines that are already in your 
walls. This technology works fine and is likely offered by your telephone 
service provider (such as AT&T). Kathy had an HPNA system for a while, 
and although it could be a bit clunky, it got the job done.

230
Part III: Greener Under the Hood 
What you need to get started
Each type of network requires different stuff. The goal is always the same — 
get the computers talking to one another and sharing resources — but the 
hardware and the technology differ from type to type.
 
For the play-by-play and the ins and outs on getting the components you need 
and assembling your home network, see Woody’s books (depending on which 
operating system you’re using) Windows 7 All-in-One For Dummies (or the 
Windows Vista or Windows XP version). To find out everything you need to 
know (and then some) about wireless networks, take a look at Wireless Home 
Networking For Dummies, 3rd Edition, by Danny Briere, Pat Hurley, and 
Edward Ferris.
Ethernet ingredients
For an Ethernet network, you need the following items:
 
✓ One Ethernet network adapter for each computer you want to add to the 
network
 
✓ An Ethernet router, if you want to share an Internet connection (you 
only need one of these for the entire network)
 
✓ An Ethernet hub or switch with enough ports to connect all the comput-
ers you’re adding (again, only one for the entire network)
 
✓ Ethernet cables (one for each computer, plus one for each external 
connection)
 
In the market for network adapters? Pick up the USB versions. They’re fast, 
easy to use, and keep on cranking.
I want my wireless
For a wireless network, you need a wireless router (one per network) and 
wireless adapters (one for each computer) for the computers you’re going to 
connect to the network. The end.
No, HPNA isn’t your medical record
To set up an HPNA network, you need one telephone cable and one HPNA 
device for every computer you want to connect to the network.
 
Okay, we’ll stop being obtuse: HPNA stands for Home Phoneline Network 
Adapter. Yes, we know that this translation is unimpressive. The secret’s out.

231
 Chapter 12: Seamless Sharing across Systems
How to pick a network type
You may wonder why, if Ethernet has a laundry list of required items, and 
wireless and HPNA networks need only a few items apiece, anyone would 
ever go to the trouble of setting up an Ethernet network. The answers, my 
dear Watson, are speed and reliability. Use Ethernet when you need a solid 
connection for gaming or other high-performance applications.
Each technology has its benefits, however. We personally dig the freedom of 
being able to work anywhere in the house — a wireless perk — but Ethernet 
is fast and consistent, and it makes lots of home networkers happy. Wireless 
continues to improve but can still be affected by varying signal strength, 
competing flotsam in the airwaves (microwave some popcorn, and you may 
lose your Web access), and routers that occasionally cash in the chips. Use 
wireless when you want maximum flexibility for casual computing and speed 
isn’t quite as big an issue.
 
HPNA offers a few benefits of both Ethernet and wireless. You can plug into HPNA 
anywhere you have an outlet, so it offers most of the flexibility of wireless. 
However, because you’re using a wired connection, you also get Ethernet reli-
ability. Okay, the whole story isn’t rosy: HPNA can suffer from noise problems, 
and you don’t get Ethernet speed from it. Use HPNA when you really do need 
to have a connection in every room and require Ethernet reliability for appli-
cations such as home control or letting the kids use a single printer.
Network lingo
Are you running into some terms you haven’t 
seen before? Here’s the short scoop:
 ✓ Adapter: You plug a network adapter into 
the computer you want to add to the net-
work. This device enables the network to 
“see” the system.
 ✓ Cables: Well, cables are cables — you 
know, cords. An Ethernet cable is bigger 
than a regular phone cable and resembles 
a snake if you’re not expecting to encoun-
ter one on the floor in the dark late at night. 
(Don’t ask.) For an Ethernet network, you 
need lots of Ethernet cables, because that’s 
how the information gets from one place to 
another. For a wireless network, you don’t 
need ’em.
 ✓ Hub or switch: A hub has several ports and 
enables you to connect several devices on 
the Ethernet network. A hub can send and 
receive information but does only one task 
at a time. A switch functions like a hub but 
is a little higher end; it can recognize the 
different systems on the network and can 
send and receive info at the same time.
 ✓ Router: An Ethernet or wireless router 
enables your systems to access the Web 
through a single Internet connection. 
Simple is good.

232
Part III: Greener Under the Hood 
Setting Up a Home Network
When you’ve settled on the type of network you want and have all the com-
ponents you need to create your home network, you’re ready to make the 
magic happen. Many people are terrified about setting up their new network 
because they see all of the hardware for it and think it’s simply impossible. 
Think again! Setting up a home network is doable — and perhaps even a little 
fun — using the information found in the following sections.
Getting your computers talking
To set up a home network of PCs using Windows, follow these steps:
 
1. Turn on the computers you want to network, along with any routers, 
switches, and hubs you want to use.
 
2. Make sure that your Internet connection is working properly.
 
 If you’re using a router (both Ethernet and wireless networks use rout-
ers), connect the router to the computer and to the wall outlet and make 
sure the router is turned on.
 
3. Connect the remaining computers to the router.
 
 The process varies, depending on which type of network you use. 
Choose your favorite flavor:
 
• Ethernet: Connect your Ethernet router (or hub or switch) to the 
computers by cable.
 
• Wireless: Run the Set Up a Wireless Router or Access Point Wizard, 
which leads you through the process of adding other computers 
and devices to your home network.
 
• HPNA: As soon as you connect the computers to the phone jacks, 
your system should be ready to rock.
 
4. Test the network on each computer by choosing Start➪Network.
 
 The window that appears should show you the computer you’re using, 
as well as all the other computers connected to your home network.

Part III: Greener Under the Hood 
Mapping your new network
When all your computers are connected and talking to one another, you can 
ask Windows Vista or Windows 7 to map the network to show you how every-
thing works together. This helpful tool lets you see all the systems that are 
awake in your house and drawing power.
To display the network map, follow these steps:
 
1. Choose Start➪Control Panel➪Network and Internet.
 
 A whole collection of networking options greets you.
 
2. Select Network and Sharing Center.
 
 This option is the first one smack-dab at the top. (What, exactly, is a 
smack-dab?)
 
3. Click View Full Map.
 
 This option is on the far-right side of the page, just above the Internet 
icon.
 
 The computers and devices that are part of your network (and turned 
on) appear in the network map. (See Figure 12-2.)
 
Figure 12-2: 
It’s alive! All 
systems — 
well, 
almost all 
systems — 
are go.
 

235
 Chapter 12: Seamless Sharing across Systems
 
If not all the computers and devices in your network appear on the network 
map — or if some are left alone at the bottom of the page, like the one shown 
in Figure 12-3 — make sure that Network Discovery is turned on (see the next 
section for details). Alternatively, if one of your network computers is running 
Windows XP, your firewall settings may be getting in the way or you might not 
have all of the required software installed. The troubleshooting procedure 
found at http://winhlp.com/node/179 provides detailed instructions for 
fixing Windows XP interactions with Vista.
Discovering the joy of Network Discovery
The preceding two sections help you get all your computers happily con-
nected and then view them in the network map. If any computer didn’t get 
mapped properly, you need to check its Network Discovery setting to make 
sure that the computer is open to finding out that it’s part of the bigger plan. 
Here’s how:
 
1. On the computer that didn’t show up in the network map, click the 
Start button; type Network and Sharing Center in the search box; and 
press Enter.
 
 The Network and Sharing Center page appears.
 
2. Click the Network Discovery button.
 
 When you turn on Network Discovery, Windows changes your network 
configuration and adds some new network discovery features to it. The 
Network Discovery setting makes it possible for the current computer to 
recognize other devices on the same network, and vice versa.
 
3. Select Turn on Network Discovery.
 
4. Click the Apply button.
 
 Windows makes the changes you made permanent. This step actually 
makes the Network Discovery setting active.
 
5. Select View Full Map in the top-right corner of the Network and 
Sharing Center page.
 
 Windows Vista or Windows 7 should show you the full network, with 
this newly discovered computer in its proper place.
Securing the wireless airwaves
If you have a wireless network, it may seem counterintuitive that you can 
secure a system that sends information through the air, but you’ll just have 
to trust us on this one. In fact, securing wireless networks isn’t something 

236
Part III: Greener Under the Hood 
that you kinda-sorta should do, but something you have to do, because wire-
less is notoriously unsecure unless you do something about it.
Now that wireless is getting to be more commonplace, users are getting 
savvy about the tricks and traps of wireless transmission. In the early days 
(and no doubt it is still happening more often than we’d like to think), people 
used to drive from one point to another to find somebody’s open wireless 
network — a process called wardriving. Then the wardriver piggybacked on 
the signal — or, worse, gained access to both the unsecure network and lots 
of private information that the network owner didn’t mean to share.
You can secure your wireless network by using a series of simple techniques:
 
✓ Change your router’s password.
 
✓ Change the default system ID.
 
✓ Use a WEP (Wired Equivalent Privacy) key so that the data will be en-
crypted and off-limits to people who are trying to tap into your wireless 
network. You can discover more about WEP at www.networkworld.
com/details/715.html. Use the vendor instructions that come with 
your device to perform the WEP configuration.
 
✓ Use WPA (Wi-Fi Protected Access) if your setup supports it. WPA 
overcomes some problems with WEP where outsiders can gain access 
to your system by hacking it (essentially, picking the lock as a thief 
would do to access your home). Discover more about WPA at www.
networkworld.com/details/4802.html. 
Sharing the Easy Stuff
In Chapter 11, we suggest that you downsize to one printer (and an all-in-one 
printer, at that) instead of using a variety of printers plugged into different 
computers in your house. Making that kind of change means that you need 
to do a bit more coordinating if you’re a family of people who print a lot, but 
you can make the whole process relatively pain free by setting up printer 
sharing. After you get that process squared away, you can set up file sharing 
too. We discuss both procedures in the following sections.
Sharing printers
Picture a printer on a psychologist’s couch, talking about its difficult child-
hood. Oh, wait — wrong kind of sharing. Printer sharing is simply the process of 
making one printer available to the other computers on your home network.

237
 Chapter 12: Seamless Sharing across Systems
To share a printer on a network using Windows Vista or Windows 7, follow 
these steps:
 
1. Turn on the printer and make sure it’s ready to use.
 
2. Click the Start button on the computer that has the printer attached; 
type Network and Sharing Center in the search box; and press Enter.
 
 The Network and Sharing Center page appears.
 
3. Click the Printer Sharing button.
 
 The printer-sharing options appear.
 
4. Select the Turn on Printer Sharing radio button. (See Figure 12-3.)
 
Figure 12-3: 
Turn on 
printer 
sharing to 
allow other 
computers 
on your 
network to 
share the 
printer.
 
 
5. Click Apply in the Network and Sharing Center page.
 
 Windows applies the changes you have made and permits printer sharing.
 
6. Set the Password Protected Sharing option on or off.
 
 When this option is turned on, anyone who wants to use the printer con-
nected to your computer must have a user account and password on 
your system. To let other people access your network printer without a 
password and user account, turn this option off.

238
Part III: Greener Under the Hood 
 
7. Click the Apply button.
 
 Now when you view your network by choosing Start➪Network, you’ll 
notice a small symbol on the printer’s icon, indicating that printer shar-
ing is turned on.
Sharing media files
Remember the Jonas Brothers example we used earlier in the “Benefits of 
networking” section? This section is where you make such happy file sharing 
a reality. The steps for configuring Windows Vista or Windows 7 are super-
simple:
 
1. Click the Start button; type Network and Sharing Center in the search 
box; and press Enter.
 
 The Network and Sharing Center page appears.
 
2. Click the Media Sharing button.
 
 The Media Sharing options appear.
 
3. Click Change.
 
 The Media Sharing dialog box appears, as shown in Figure 12-4. The 
Media Sharing dialog box lets you know that the computers on your net-
work will have access to the media you share.
 
Figure 12-4: 
Enable other 
computers 
in your 
network to 
access the 
media on 
your system.
 
 
4. Select the Share My Media check box, and click OK.
 
 Windows makes the changes required to share your media. You see the 
Network and Sharing Center page.

239
 Chapter 12: Seamless Sharing across Systems
 
5. Click Settings in the Media Sharing options.
 
 You see the Media Sharing – Default Settings dialog box, which enables 
you to customize the settings for the media files you share. (See Figure 
12-5.) You can choose whether you want to share music, pictures, or 
video (the default is all three); and you can determine which types of 
items are available for sharing.
 
Figure 12-5: 
Enter the 
settings you 
want to put 
in place for 
media 
sharing.
 
 
6. Click OK.
 
 Now when you view your computers in the Network window (the 
window that shows network resources, rather than the Network and 
Sharing Center page), a media icon appears on the system icon, letting 
you know that media sharing is good to go. (You access the Network 
window by clicking Network on the Desktop.)
Streamlining Your Whole Setup 
with Windows Home Server
Imagine this scenario: Your family members are media enthusiasts. They 
like homemade video and movies on demand. They have a million MP3s (all 
legal, of course), not to mention so many photos that it would take the entire 
Butler Bulldogs marching band a full summer to put them into photo albums. 
They have several computers (all of them usually on), plus several printers, a 
couple of scanners, and an Xbox 360. Have we forgotten anything?

240
Part III: Greener Under the Hood 
Windows Home Server was introduced in 2008 for families just like yours. 
The idea behind it was that something smart and safe needed to be done to 
safeguard the wealth of digital media that people are collecting and to make 
it easy (think low footprint) to enjoy, share, organize, and back up all that 
great stuff.
Of course, the question is why you even need a server. By centralizing data 
storage, you make it easier for everyone to find the files they need, which 
means that you only need a few computers running, rather than every com-
puter in the house. Reducing the number of computers also reduces your 
carbon footprint, which makes using a server the ecologically friendly solu-
tion for centralized data storage and management. What a server really does 
is let everyone share a little of a central computer while using their own 
computers for local tasks. I explain more about the green aspects of Windows 
Home Server in the “Getting green with Windows Home Server” section.
Figuring out what it is: hardware, 
software, or both?
Is Windows Home Server hardware or software? Well, actually, it’s both — 
sort of. It was designed as software that makes your regular computer act like 
a server, collecting your digital files in one central location, making backup 
and restoration easy, and giving you access from anywhere. Most people, 
however, buy this software preinstalled on . . . well, a Windows Home Server.
Confusing? Yep, but as the Dalai Lama says, without inconsistencies, life 
wouldn’t be interesting. The brain melt happens when you try to connect a 
real metal-and-capacitor server to Windows Home Server, which is software 
that can run on your regular computer . . . or on a Windows Home Server like 
the Hewlett-Packard MediaSmart. (See Figure 12-6.)
The plan behind Windows Home Server was for PC manufacturers to bundle 
the software with their own hardware and then sell complete home servers — 
hardware, software, and all — which HP has done, apparently with great suc-
cess. You can check out some fun demos and even download a trial of the 
software (that is, Windows Home Server) by going to www.microsoft.com/
windows/products/winfamily/windowshomeserver.
 
Windows Home Server won’t help you set up a network, which means that you 
need to have one working before you install the software.

Getting green with Windows Home Server
You may think we’d have to pick through compost to find some good, solid 
green things to say about the perks and benefits of investing in Windows Home 
Server, but this technology does have some good green ideas behind it:
 
✓ Centralized storage of all your digital files means that you don’t have to 
have all your computers on all the time.
 
✓ Your data and files are backed up regularly, with no intervention from 
you.
 
✓ Backups and restorations are streamlined and easy, taking less time and 
using fewer watts.
 
✓ You can access your files from anywhere, which means that you 
can reuse what you already have. When you have a group of single 
machines, you usually download files multiple times and then need mul-
tiple CDs to store it all — all this duplication is no longer necessary with 
Windows Home Server. Reuse reduces processing (and, in some cases, 
manufacturing cost and waste), and that’s green.
 
✓ The personal Web site you get free with Windows Home Server makes 
it easy for you to share your favorite digital media files with whomever 
you choose, which saves the printing, ink, and/or mailing resources you 
would otherwise use to produce the files and send them to friends and 
relatives.

242

Windows Home Server Power Pack 2 is now available, offering improved fea-
tures for accessing your files remotely, collaborative features for systems run-
ning Windows Media Center, and support for Media Center Extenders. Read

aspx. The update is available through Windows Update.
Backing up and restoring
Windows Home Server isn’t kidding around when it comes to backups. You 
can restore an entire hard drive with almost no headache at all. It’s a thing of 
beauty, really.
You can also add more hard drives to your system. Thus equipped, Windows 
Home Server will mirror your backup data, putting separate copies of the 
backup on multiple drives. Nice.
What’s more, the backups aren’t saved in some arcane format that nobody 
ever heard of, but in good old-fashioned .zip files, so you can get into them 
with any old decompression utility if you need to.
Sharing data
Working with shared folders is easier with Windows Home Server than it is 
with either Windows XP or Windows Vista. (You don’t have to go too far to 
be folder-friendlier than Windows XP, of course.) Windows Home Server cre-
ates a few shared folders for you, but you can add to them easily, and other 
users on your network can access them as well.
Managing disks the easy way
Go get a cup of organically grown coffee, and let Windows Home Server do 
the rest. That about sums up disk management. Windows Home Server does 
the work; you just enjoy your digital files. You don’t have to worry about 
drive volumes and folders; Windows Home Server manages the details. All 
things in life should be so easy.
Taking your media on the road
One big feature of Windows Home Server that Microsoft touts is its capability 
to let you access your favorite digital files almost anywhere, whether you’re 
in the house or out on the road. Whether you’re using a mobile device or a 
laptop, or remoting in from the office, you can log into your home computer 
and listen to the new release you purchased last night.
Windows Home Server’s Remote Access feature takes a bit of effort to get 
going, but when you’ve got it, you’ve got it. You can log on to your server and 
move files around, upload and download them, listen to files — do whatever 
from wherever. Very cool.

243
 Chapter 12: Seamless Sharing across Systems
Keeping your system healthy
Here’s an idea that smacks of greenness, so we like it: Windows Home Server 
continually monitors all the computers on your network and provides a 
health report that clues you in about needed updates and software patches. 
It also tells you if a computer is running out of space, which is a green issue 
because a clogged computer works more slowly — and uses more processing 
power.
Keeping Your Footprint Low at Home
Some basics apply to all computer users, whether you’re trying to be green 
or not. You should always do the following things:
 
✓ Back up your data.
 
✓ Remember to clean up your mess.
 
✓ Pay attention to how much you use.
Each of these items helps you be more effective, more productive, and maybe 
even faster in what you do, which can translate (we hope) into less time at 
the computer and more time outside growing organic pumpkins.
Working with backups
Show us a person who has lost a hard drive without having a backup, and 
we’ll show you someone who’ll never forget to do a backup again.
If you do a quick poll of computer users, you might be surprised to see a blank 
look come across their faces when you ask them when was the last time they 
backed up their files. Most likely, you’ll hear something like “Oh, yeah — I’ve 
got to do that” or “I did it in 2008. How often are you supposed to do it?”
If you work for a company, it’s doing regular backups of everything (if its IT 
department is worth its salt). But what about you? How will you back up your 
green computers and your home network?
 
In Chapter 15, we discuss the availability of cloud computing to do many 
things, from word processing to data backup. If you have a fast Internet con-
nection, and you don’t mind storing your data on a gigantic company’s com-
puter, you may want to consider backing up your files to the cloud. Several 
companies, including Google and Microsoft, are offering online storage 
options that seem to be well received.

244
Part III: Greener Under the Hood 
Windows Vista makes backups easy by providing the Backup Status and 
Configuration tool in System Tools. You can choose among three options:
 
✓ Back up Files
 
✓ Restore Files
 
✓ Complete PC Backup
To set up automatic backups and complete your first one in Windows Vista, 
follow these steps:
 
1. Choose Start➪All Programs➪Accessories➪System Tools➪
Backup Status and Configuration.
 
 If you haven’t set up your system for automatic file backups, Windows 
Vista prompts you to do that.
 
2. Click Set up Automatic File Backup.
 
 The Back Up Files window appears, asking you to choose where you’d 
like to store the backup. You can choose a hard disk or DVD/CD, or a 
location on your network.
 
3. Click the Browse button to see your backup options on your new 
network.
 
 The Browse for Folder dialog box shows you the various locations you 
can designate for the backup files. (See Figure 12-7.)
 
Figure 12-7: 
You can 
back up to 
a system on 
your new 
home 
network.
 
 
4. Select your backup location, and click OK.
 
 Backup Status and Configuration saves the backup location information 
and displays a window where you choose the files you want to back up.
 
5. Choose the type of files you want to back up, and click Next.
 
 Note that all file types are selected by default.

245
 Chapter 12: Seamless Sharing across Systems
 
6. Specify the schedule for your backups (what day, what time, and how 
frequently you want to back up your files).
 
7. Click Save Settings and Start Backup.
 
 Windows Vista makes a backup copy of all the file types you selected 
and stores the backup files where you specified. Incremental backups 
will be repeated according to the schedule you set up during the 
process.
Cleaning things up
Cleaning the bits, pieces, and file fragments off your hard drive is a very green 
thing to do, because it helps your computer process information faster and 
more smoothly, thereby requiring less processing power and using less energy.
In Windows XP and Windows Vista, you have access to two cleanup tools 
named Disk Cleanup and Disk Defragmenter. To find them, choose Start➪All 
Programs➪Accessories➪System Tools. Start either application by selecting 
its entry in the System Tools folder.
Disk Cleanup scans the files on your hard drive to see how much space you 
can save by cleaning up unnecessary files.
Disk Defragmenter puts back together all the files that were scattered hither 
and yon on your computer’s hard disk. You have the option of setting up a 
schedule for regular defragging of your hard disk, which generally is a good 
idea. (Just schedule defragmentation for a time when you’re not using the 
computer, because the process takes a lot of processing power and can really 
slow your system down.) You can force a defrag at any time, schedule or not, 
by displaying the Disk Defragmenter dialog box and clicking the Defragment 
Now button. (See Figure 12-8.)
Get your backup with Windows 7
Windows 7 offers four types of backups (which 
is actually more intuitive than it sounds):
 ✓ Shadow copies: Windows 7 automatically 
keeps shadow copies (previous versions or 
backup copies) of your data files.
 ✓ Data backups: Data backups are partial 
backups that you create by using the File 
and Folder Backup Wizard.
 ✓ System Restore: You use System Restore 
points to back up most of your computer’s 
internal settings, drivers, and certain key 
system files. Windows 7 creates a new 
restore point every day.
 ✓ Image backups: Image backups are snap-
shots of your drive(s) contents.

Monitoring your resources
Windows 7 has a great feature called Resource Monitor that lets you see — 
in full graphic color — how your system is using the resources that it con-
sumes. If your system suddenly slows down and you think that something 
might be hijacking it, or if you want to see how much memory is being used 
and when, Resource Monitor is the place to start.
To peruse the internal behavior of your system, follow these steps:
 
1. Click the Start button, type resmon in the search field, and press 
Enter.
 
 The Overview page appears, giving you the big picture.
 
2. Click the Average CPU column heading.
 
 This step reorganizes the processes and puts the biggest culprits right 
at the top of the list.
 
 If one of your programs has frozen, you can right-click it in this list and 
choose Analyze Process from the contextual menu to get a little insight 
that just might get you unstuck.
 
3. Click the Memory tab.
 
 The Memory Tracker shows you how the memory is being used in your 
system.
 
4. When you’re done, close Resource Monitor — but remember to return 
to it if anything looks fishy later.

Part IV
Telecommuting, 
Teleconferencing, 
and Teleporting

In this part . . .
S
ome of us are looking for a good reason — any good 
reason — to telecommute. Think of it: the wind in 
your hair, meetings at outdoor cafes, the free life. Others 
almost run in horror from the idea of being on their own, 
without a structure or schedule, out of sight (and maybe 
out of mind) of those in charge of hiring and firing. Okay, 
so telecommuting isn’t without its challenges; but it is a 
great opportunity for reducing the amount of energy you 
use, the volume of CO2 your car is pumping into the envi-
ronment, and the amount of gas you pay for. We’ll let you 
weigh out the pros and cons, but this part is all about the 
possibilities of telecommuting, for fun, profit, and saving 
the planet.

H
ow does this sound? You get up in the morning as the sunlight is just 
beginning to stream in the windows. You shuffle to the kitchen, in your 
favorite pajamas and slippers, and get a cup of coffee. Sipping on the coffee, 
you walk over to the laptop and check your e-mail. One, two, three messages 
from coworkers. You dash off a quick response, send the report one col-
league was asking for, and after a moment, head upstairs to take a shower.
Yup, no commute. No business casual. Just comfort, sunlight, coffee, and 
quiet.
Welcome to working at home.
Working at home, or working remotely, for a company — also called 
telecommuting — has been around for a long time, growing slowly in main-
stream business. Growth has been slow for a number of bottom-line reasons, 
and the perception of less employee control is a big one. (How can you make 
sure your employees are working if you can’t see them?) But today the justifi-
cation for telecommuting is better than ever — as we explain in this chapter. 
The savings in gas, CO2 emissions, time, and energy is a big deal. Here you 
get some of the facts and figures, find out how to approach your boss with 
the possibility, weigh it all out, and put a plan in place.

250
Part IV: Telecommuting, Teleconferencing, and Teleporting 
Telecommuting: Its Time Has Come
For most people in midsized companies a little more than a decade ago, 
working at home was a bit of a challenge. Sure, computers and the baby 
Internet made it possible to connect, trade files, and work on things here or 
there. But unless you were a one-person team or an entrepreneur, collabora-
tion was clunky and managing all the files you needed, hither and yon, was a 
pain. Plus working at home back then was isolating (even for us introverts); 
it was hard to keep up with the group, offer the kind of meet-me-at-the-water-
cooler easy access, and stay in sync with your colleagues.
Today everything’s different. With the advent of blossoming and always-on 
Web technologies that make teleconferencing, instant communication, and 
data warehousing easy and intuitive, you never have to feel out of touch with 
anyone. Whether you’re working in the office or out, tools are available to keep 
you in continual contact, provide you with the data and processing power you 
need, and enable you to complete the tasks you’re charged with completing, 
whether you work in an office down the hall or in a house across town.
The green aspect of telecommuting makes it an even more viable option for 
employees: It’s a greener way to work. Here are just a few of the big-ticket 
savings that telecommuting offers individuals and businesses:
 
✓ Saves time: Americans in cities of all sizes across the country lost more 
than 4.2 billion hours waiting in traffic in a single year!
 
✓ Saves energy: Whether we’re talking about personal, get-yourself-ready-
and-the-kids-in-the-car-on-time energy or the amount of energy you use 
getting to the office, powering up your system, flipping on all the lights, 
and warming (or cooling) yourself with the climate control system, stay-
ing in one place is less of a drain on energy resources.
 
✓ Saves gas: Ah, gas. With the $4-per-gallon price tag etched firmly in our 
recent memory data banks, we all realize reducing the amount of gas we 
use is a good thing. And longer term, it has ramifications for import and 
export issues and greenhouse gas emissions, too.
 
✓ Reduces CO2 emissions: Cars on the road are a huge contributor to the 
gasses that are causing the greenhouse effect around the planet. The 
logic is simple — reduce the number of cars on the road, reduce the CO2 
emissions. You do the math.
 
✓ Reduces in-the-office resources: You may not think you take up a lot of 
space or use a lot of electricity (or oil, or coal, or water) in the office, 
but if you’re there, you’re leaving a footprint. If, on the other hand, 
you’ve invested in energy-efficient equipment and done the work around 
your house to lower your footprint size, the amount of energy you use in 
a home office may be significantly lower than a similar use at the work-
place (especially if your office hasn’t taken any steps toward green yet).

251
 Chapter 13: Making the Case for Telecommuting
 
Working at home has a number of benefits, but none may have a larger impact 
on the immediate environment than the CO2 you save by not driving to work 
every day. The 2007 Mobility Report published by the Texas Transportation 
Institute revealed some staggering information:
 
✓ Traffic congestion costs the U.S. $78 billion annually.
 
✓ Traffic jams result in 4.2 billion hours of wasted time and 2.9 billion 
gallons of wasted fuel.
The report went on to say that when you’re doing the drive-and-stop in rush 
hour traffic, you are spending an extra 38 hours per year — and 26 extra gallons 
of gas — just because you’re stuck in traffic with everybody else. That translates 
to an average of $710 extra per driver per year, and that doesn’t even take into 
account all the waits you have because of wrecks, work zones, and other events.
 
To get the full scoop and the not-so-pretty picture that appears in the results 
from the 2007 Mobility Report from the Texas Transportation Institute, go 
online to http://mobility.tamu.edu/ums/media_information/
press_release.stm.
We’re not saying you have to stop driving altogether, of course, or even that 
working at home should be a full-time option. But if you consider — and per-
haps make the case for — working at home one day a week (or maybe even 
two days a week), you might find yourself a little more relaxed and feel a little 
greener in the work department, too.
Telecommute or virtual office?
For many practical reasons — green in both 
environmental and financial ways — startups 
today are often considering alternatives to the 
traditional build-the-office-and-they-will-come 
approach to day-to-day operations.
Instead of leasing a large office space, com-
plete with its heating and cooling systems, light-
ing fixtures, water supply, and interior decor 
(not to mention security systems, technology, 
and more), some startups are opting for the 
virtual office — a nonphysical location where 
employees can “meet” online to share files, 
have meetings, chat, meet at the water cooler, 
host presentations, and strategize.
Using readily available teleconferencing, cloud, 
and shared workspace technologies, the team 
can collaborate easily while living and work-
ing in remote locations all around the globe. 
The business can be doing business literally 
24 hours a day and offer always-on customer 
service. The business has no leased overhead 
(which helps keep costs down), and the foot-
print is little more than the individual personal 
footprint each person accrues.
In this chapter, we focus on telecommuting, 
which is working for someone else while you 
use telecommunications tools to work remotely. 
But the virtual office is a good idea and is dem-
onstrating its worth. The approach is working 
for a lot of companies now (and the number is 
sure to grow in the future).

Rating Yourself: Could You Work at Home?
Not everybody can work at home. A nurse in a large hospital, for example, 
has to be where the patients are. But the bookkeeper in a doctor’s office 
could do some tasks remotely (and probably does). A painter needs to drive 
to the site of the home she’s painting to do her job, but the person who 
schedules the jobs and orders the paint could probably work at home.
You get the idea. If you work more with information than you do people, 
chances are that you can do at least part of your job at home. Table 13-1 gives 
you a look at some of the different kinds of tasks you might be able to do at 
home and provides a sampling of the technologies that can make it all possible.

Note the emphasis on technology in Table 13-1? Technology is what makes 
telecommuting possible. Here are just a few ways in which technology con-
nects the world and makes it easier than ever to be productive, efficient, and 
a model employee, all without changing out of your Bart Simpson jammies:
 
✓ You can be on time for any meeting anywhere in the world through tele-
conferencing.
 
✓ You can offer instant customer service response via e-mail, instant mes-
saging, or VoIP.
 
✓ You can develop and share strategies, business plans, presentations, 
and more in real time, collaboratively, using Web conferencing software.
 
✓ You can schedule projects, assign tasks, report on progress, and evalu-
ate results in real-time using Web-based group management software.
 
✓ You can find, review, modify, and share documents seamlessly and 
securely using cloud computing technologies.

 Chapter 13: Making the Case for Telecommuting
Exploring the Upside(s) 
of Working at Home
There are a lot of great things about working at home, and you won’t have 
to look far to find them. The green quotient — the fact that you’ve already 
power-optimized your home, created a green home office (oh wait, we show 
you how to do that in Chapter 14), and discovered how to reduce the power 
you use and maximize the power you’ve got — already goes a long way 
toward energy savings.
 
If you have kids at home, you know that the benefit of being there in the morn-
ing when they leave and in the afternoon when they come home is a huge 
perk. Plus, you know if they’re raiding the fridge. Telecommuting enables you 
to work and be there — instead of working or being there, which is a big 
stress-inducer for many parents. Relax and enjoy and play a little Mario Kart 
with the kids when you’ve got time for a coffee break.
In addition to the obvious energy-and-lifestyle benefits, you may see an 
upswing in your own work productivity, more creative and flexible energy, 
and a chance to test those fashion risks you never got up the nerve to wear 
to the office.
Heightened productivity
If you’re like us, you may have noticed something curious in your workplace. 
Whenever there’s a huge deadline and people really need to get things done, 
they work at home. Why is that? Simple.
When you need to really focus, you need to be able to control your environ-
ment and limit the input your surroundings are blasting at you. If you have 
pre-meeting meetings, meetings, and post-meeting meetings, chances are 
that you don’t get a lot of focus time in your office. And if your workplace is 
a social one, take another slice away from the Me Time side of your balance 
sheet.
Working at home — unless you have more than a few kids under four — pro-
vides a more or less quiet, controllable space where you can say what gets 
your attention and what doesn’t. Yes, you still need to respond to e-mail, but 
you can choose the when.

256
Part IV: Telecommuting, Teleconferencing, and Teleporting 
For many telecommuters, this ability to focus translates to a heightened 
sense of productivity, reduced feelings of “scatteredness,” and a noticeable 
increase in that peaceful, easy feeling. You can set your tasks in your Outlook 
calendar to reflect the priorities you need to work on today. (See Figure 13-1.) 
Now that’s freedom.
 
Figure 13-1: 
Your 
Outlook 
calendar 
and task 
list become 
your own 
when you 
telecom-
mute (at 
least for the 
days you’re 
not in the 
office).
 
Economy of effort: laundry and lattes
With the “Reduce, reuse, recycle” refrain playing 
in the background, you can think through all the 
different ways you save energy, time, gasoline, 
and effort when you telecommute a day or more 
a week. Soon you get into a routine and know 
how to keep things moving seamlessly, from 
laundry to lunch to lead generation software.
Adjusting to working at home does take a little 
time and effort, but you learn to balance what 
you need to do with what you want to do over 
time. You discover ways to prioritize and econ-
omize so that the day flows smoothly, errands 
are completed, and kids get picked up in a way 
that works together pretty well. (It really does 
happen once in a while!) And underneath it all, 
you’re doing something good for the planet in 
a tangible way. Sounds like win-win-win all 
around, doesn’t it?

257
 Chapter 13: Making the Case for Telecommuting
Flexibility and creativity
Having the freedom to focus on your priorities has the curious effect of free-
ing up some portion of your brain for more creative efforts. You will probably 
notice on your work-at-home days (after you get used to the change) that 
your thoughts are clearer, plans seem more obvious, and problems are less 
daunting when you’ve tuned out the static and can hear yourself think. 
 
Focusing on the things that are most important to you creates a kind of shift 
that enables other solutions, ideas, and possibilities to bubble to the surface. 
The temptation may be to follow every good idea down a winding road and get 
distracted (and then you’re back to your in-the-office scatteredness!), but 
here’s a nice trick for managing those creative vibes: Use Microsoft OneNote 
(see Figure 13-2) so that whenever an idea bubbles up that you want to follow, 
you can capture it and give it your attention after the end of the business day. 
If it’s a good idea, the energy is still there when you’re ready to work on it. If 
it’s not such a good idea, it dissipates and you’ll be glad you didn’t chase it all 
afternoon while you should have been doing your real work.

is a simple 
way to 
capture 
ideas — as 
text, audio, 
or even doo-
dles — and

sideration 
later.
 
Closer to family
Even though we’ve made some strides in this country in terms of family 
friendliness, the basic us-or-them attitude (in terms of family-versus-work) is 
still prevalent in many workplaces. The Family Leave Act mandates a 

258
Part IV: Telecommuting, Teleconferencing, and Teleporting 
certain value set in which employers must (by law) allow their employees to 
be human, to have human family needs, and to allow time off for life events 
that need their attention.
But the tension between work and family — how do you care for your family 
to the best of your ability and still be a “team player” at work? — still exists, 
and probably always will. Telecommuting can help reduce some of that ten-
sion by enabling you to be present at home, with the family, even if you are 
busy working on a report or building a CAD model.
 
One of the tricks to telecommuting successfully with the family around is to 
talk about expectations right off the bat. What does it mean for you to work at 
home? How accessible will you be — for baseball carpooling, babysitting, 
fixing dinner? Think it through early before you get too far down the road or 
you’ll have a lot of renegotiating to do.
Bunny slippers-to-work day
Some telecommuters get up at the same time every day, take a shower, put 
on business casual work clothes, and sit down at the computer promptly at 
8 a.m., the same time everyone else is starting their work days. Others are 
more flexible, stumbling to the computer sometime in the morning, bleary-
eyed, in their bunny slippers.
Chances are you may be somewhere in the middle. In general, timing is an 
important factor — you want to be visible, accessible, and “in there” with the 
rest of the team, even if you’re remoting in. The bunny slippers, they may not 
care so much about. And even if you’re using Windows Live Messenger (see 
Figure 13-3) to stay in touch with colleagues, they aren’t likely to see your 
slippers unless you point your Webcam in that direction. (We cover Windows 
Live Messenger in more detail in Chapter 16.)
 
Some telecommuters feel the way you dress has a direct impact on the way 
you work. Kathy was wearing a “Rocky Mountain Bulldogs” T-shirt while she 
was working on this chapter.

Managing the Challenges 
of Telecommuting
It would be easy to write this chapter from the try-it-you’ll-love-it perspec-
tive because, well, we’ve both worked from home for many years and it has 
turned out well for us. But not everybody is comfortable living and working in 
the same place, looking at the same surroundings, seeing the same person in 
the mirror every day, day in, day out. (Feeling claustrophobic yet?)
Some of the big challenges you’re likely to encounter as you begin to tele-
commute for the first time include these:
 
✓ Setting up expectations
 
✓ Managing your time effectively
 
✓ Setting up boundaries while everyone gets used to the new routine
 
✓ Staying in the loop
 
✓ Demonstrating your value
 
✓ Being on the radar for promotions

260
Part IV: Telecommuting, Teleconferencing, and Teleporting 
This section tackles each of these challenges and offers tech-related solu-
tions to help you clear the hurdles easily.
Establishing expectations
Knowing what your employer expects of you — and what you expect of 
yourself — is a good thing to start with as you negotiate the possibility of 
telecommuting. Here are a few questions to ask as you’re doing a little fact-
finding:
 
✓ Are any employees in your company telecommuting now?
 
✓ Is anyone in your department telecommuting? 
 
✓ If yes, how is workflow handled?
 
✓ How many days a week do they work at home?
 
✓ Do employees have remote access to their computers in the office?
 
✓ What challenges have cropped up?
 
✓ How have those challenges been resolved?
 
✓ What kinds of lessons have already been learned from telecommuting 
experiences in your workplace?
It’s a good idea to think through your own expectations about telecommut-
ing, including all the pros and cons. For example, your list might go some-
thing like what is shown in Table 13-2.
Table 13-2 
Pros and Cons of Working at Home
Pros
Cons
Won’t need to drive to the office 
Mondays and Fridays
Will miss special lunches with staff 
every other Friday
Can use my green laptop to access 
my work files remotely
Will need to schedule database work 
for Tuesday–Thursday, when I’m in the 
office
Better use of time for creative 
projects
Will be able to meet with vendors only 
on Tuesday–Thursday
Easily accessible via remote access, 
IM, and cellphone
Won’t be there for quick meetings on 
work-at-home days

261
 Chapter 13: Making the Case for Telecommuting
 
When you talk to your supervisor about the possibility of working at home, 
demonstrate that you’ve done your homework by talking to peers, finding out 
what worked well and what was a challenge, and share your pros and cons. 
Helping the person charged with making the call see that you’re looking at it 
from all sides will, we hope, help “reduce and recycle” any resistance that 
might be lifting its ugly head.
Managing time effectively
One of the challenges in adjusting to telecommuting involves learning to 
manage the freedom that comes with it. When you are controlled by sched-
ules and deadlines, it’s easy to think, “If only I didn’t have all these restric-
tions, life would be so much better!” But then when some of those situations 
relax, you are still faced with the question of how best to use your time.
A smart way to begin adjusting to a telecommuting schedule involves stick-
ing pretty close to the in-the-office routing. Because you need to demonstrate 
that you really are there and really are working, you need to be accessible via 
e-mail, instant messaging, and more. You may participate in phone conferenc-
ing or Web seminars, but in general, you need to stay in sync with life at the 
office. Here are a few ideas to help you do just that:
 
✓ If you are able to remote in to your office system, keep your daily calen-
dar up to date and share it with others on your team. This helps them 
see what you have planned for your time at home. You can also use 
a simple Web-based calendar in a tool like Microsoft Office Live and 
enable others on your team to have shared access to it.
 
✓ Send an e-mail message to your team leader or supervisor in the morn-
ing to give a quick update on your projects and let him or her know what 
you’re focusing on that day at home.
 
✓ Let team members who are waiting on items from you know instantly 
when you send something in. You can send an e-mail message or ping 
someone with an instant messaging program such as Windows Live 
Messenger or AIM. (More on those programs in Chapter 16.)
 
✓ Participate in conference calls, interviews, and any other group or lead-
ership event remotely (or make arrangements to go in for a portion of 
the day). Being available and flexible is an important part of reassuring 
your employer that you want to make telecommuting work for everyone.
 
✓ Keep track of the fuel and CO2 you’re saving as you work at home. This 
encourages you and reinforces the decision — plus it’s something to 
toss around at parties to inspire other folks.

262
Part IV: Telecommuting, Teleconferencing, and Teleporting 
Distractions and boundaries
As soon as your neighbors learn that you’re working at home a couple of 
days a week, you may begin getting strange requests. Sylvia calls and asks 
you to let her dog out. Randy is worried he’ll miss the cable guy and wants 
you to let him in if he arrives early. Brian’s mom hopes you’ll bring him home 
from soccer. Don’t all these people know you work for a living?
In the house, you’ll have other challenges. Home means home, right? The kids 
want you to take a turn on Super Mario Bros. Your spouse didn’t have time to 
pick up the laundry from the cleaners. Could you please start dinner a little 
early so you can all be done before American Idol comes on?
As you begin to learn how to set and keep the schedule for your work-at-
home day, you also need to think through how you will communicate and 
reinforce your working boundaries so those you love at home (and those you 
like in the neighborhood) will know what to expect.
What works:
 
✓ Setting formal “Don’t-disturb-me-unless-your-hair’s-on-fire” work hours
 
✓ Creating a work-at-home calendar to post on the fridge
 
✓ Communicating to your family why you want to work at home, what you 
need to accomplish during the day, and how they can help
 
✓ Communicating your expectations clearly to your colleagues at the 
office — when it’s okay to call, when it isn’t, when you can be available 
for online meetings, and when you can’t
What doesn’t work:
 
✓ Shouting, “Will you guys just leave me alone?!”
 
✓ Locking everyone out of your office
 
✓ Trying to take it all in stride and letting yourself get interrupted 10 times 
an hour (sooner or later that’s going to show up in your stress level, 
your health, or your general outlook toward life in general)
 
✓ Giving up and going back to the office full-time

263
 Chapter 13: Making the Case for Telecommuting
Slipping through the cracks
One challenge you are likely to face sooner or later is the feeling that you’re 
missing something by being out of the office. And you are! But what you’re 
saving — energy, fuel, and greenhouse gas emissions — is definitely worth 
the effort.
Although many people see the benefit of telecommuting, some still have a 
hard time seeing working at home as “real work” and don’t think it has the 
same value or structure as work done in the office. Although it’s not your 
responsibility to change the misconceptions of every person in your work-
place, you do need to demonstrate your effectiveness as a telecommuter and 
make the effort to keep yourself in the loop in things like decision-making, 
team planning, and departmental reviews. Your visibility — and the effort 
you make to be involved — goes a long way toward keeping you on the radar 
screen as a full-time, valuable employee.
Another challenge that goes along with working at home can be a sense of 
social isolation. While you used to joke, lunch, and meet with others on your 
team face-to-face, now your communication may be more limited to elec-
tronic communication (depending on how many days a week you work at 
home). If you start to feel like you’re being left out in the cold, schedule some 
time in the office and go out to lunch with the gang. You’ll feel more in sync 
and ready to tackle your next telecommuting day feeling reconnected.
The eyes have had it
One problem you may not anticipate from work-
ing at home is also one of the benefits — lack 
of interruptions. If you sit for long hours in front 
of your monitor, staring at the screen, you may 
discover that your eyes get more tired than 
they did in the office. Without distractions, you 
can stare intently at that gleaming screen for 
hours at a time, and during that time you tend 
to blink less frequently. Lack of refocusing and 
blinking can cause vision problems — and at 
the very least, exhaust your eyes and lead to 
blurry vision.
To help keep your eyes energized, some experts 
recommend the 20-20-20 rule. Every 20 minutes, 
look at something at least 20 feet away for 20 
seconds. The refocusing enables your eyes to 
switch gears for a few seconds, blink, and be 
refreshed, ready to start again.

264
Part IV: Telecommuting, Teleconferencing, and Teleporting 
You’re Set to Telecommute: Now What?
So hopefully all goes well and your employer is open to you telecommuting 
for a day or two a week. What should you do next? The most important step 
involves spelling out how the arrangement works and making sure you and 
your employer are on the same page. Questions you might want to consider 
up front include these:
 
✓ How many days a week will you work at home?
 
✓ Which days?
 
✓ How will you report on your progress (and to whom?)
 
✓ Will you be able to access your computer remotely? If not, how will you 
handle the licenses of any software you may need at home?
 
✓ How will you stay in touch with the office? E-mail, phone calls, face-to-
face meetings?
Arrange for data exchange
One of the big considerations right off the bat involves how you will arrange 
to receive, work with, and transmit files. If your work involves reports, docu-
ments, images, and spreadsheets that you create, modify, and share using 
common applications like Word, Excel, and PowerPoint, you can likely move 
files back and forth from your work computer to your home computer by 
e-mailing them or transporting them on a flash drive.
Out of sight, out of mind?
The office furniture manufacturer Steelcase 
recently completed a Workplace Index Survey. 
It found that 64 percent of remote workers felt 
that the fact that they didn’t have daily contact 
with their employers reduced their chances 
for a promotion when the time for raises rolled 
around.
Whether this is a perception or a reality, it’s 
worth remembering that if no one sees the 
work you are doing at home, they may not real-
ize how much you’re doing for the company or 
for your department. If it’s your job to handle 
customer service queries and you handle them 
all so nicely and neatly that no one else has to 
deal with them, you should still send a report to 
someone: “I responded to 15 customer queries 
today; 10 were resolved satisfactorily; 3 I’m still 
researching; and 2 are returning their prod-
ucts.” That way, someone can measure your 
work and know that you’re providing a valuable 
service — whether or not you are visible.

If you are working with sensitive information in a secure system, or you need 
to access customized database software on the corporate servers, you need 
to use remote connectivity to access your work system. In Chapter 16, we 
show you how to use Microsoft’s Remote Desktop Connection to access your 
office computer and work like you’re sitting right there at your office desk.
Sorting out software licenses
Another consideration worth thinking through involves the use of extra soft-
ware that requires specific license seats. For example, you might be able to 
use Adobe Dreamweaver CS4 at the office, but will you need it on your home 
computer? If so, how will that be handled? Talk with your system adminis-
trator to get any questions you have answered before your telecommuting 
begins.
Meetings here, there, and everywhere
Telecommuting successfully means being as present as possible with as 
low a footprint as possible. On days when you’re out of the office, you can 
still attend important meetings by participating by phone or on the Web. In 
Chapter 16, you learn about various remote technologies — including Skype 
and WebEx — that help you be present even though you’re physically in 
another location. Weird.
Resolving difficulties
In an ideal world, everyone would communicate perfectly, we’d all get our 
work done, and there’d be no such thing as global warming.
And then we’d wake up.
As you begin working through the details and start telecommuting, problems 
will pop up. Chances are that whatever issues arise, they have something to 
do with one (or more) of the three Ps:
 
✓ People
 
✓ Projects
 
✓ Process

266
Part IV: Telecommuting, Teleconferencing, and Teleporting 
Each of these three areas presents you with a different set of hurdles to over-
come, but we’ve got another set of three consonants — the three Cs — that 
can help keep things as smooth as possible. Whether you are facing people 
challenges, project snafus, or process pitfalls, you can take the sting out of 
the issue right away and drop the tension level instantly by using clear, com-
passionate communication.
Clear communication starts with a simple statement of what the problem 
seems to be. “It sounds like I threw a wrench in things when I ordered the 
new supplies from home. Did that cause a problem?”
Compassionate communication means you try to understand why it’s hitting 
the person the way it is (or how this could have possibly happened to mess 
up your project or process). “Oh, I understand — that would frustrate me 
too. Sorry about that; I’ll remote in and use your form next time.”
And communication, of course, just means you’re willing to talk about it 
openly instead of sticking your head in the sand (which may be tempting 
when you’re out of the office and no one can see you anyway).
 
If you’re the first person in your department or company to telecommute, con-
sider keeping a journal or composing a Word doc of your adventures as a tele-
commuter. You could include startup struggles, schedules, software 
challenges, and more. That way, when someone follows in your footsteps (and 
someone surely will), he or she will benefit from having a guidebook to the 
trail you’ve already cleared for them.
Tracking Your Green Savings
After you get the process down, the convenience and flexibility of telecom-
muting is considerable, but the best news of all is reduction of the impact 
you’re making on the environment. Your example is sure to inspire others to 
do the same thing.
Disaster preparedness
One of the perks of working in the office is that 
chances are, someone else — like your system 
administrator or IT person — takes care of 
regular backups, security, and more. When you 
work at home, it’s up to you to safeguard the 
data and equipment you use and make sure you 
keep regular backups.
Talk with your system administrator about 
backup utilities and procedures that are com-
patible with those used in the office. Ask also 
about whether you should deliver backups of 
files you’ve created and worked on at home to 
be archived with the company system.

267
 Chapter 13: Making the Case for Telecommuting
Sun Microsystems is a computer and software manufacturer that encour-
ages telecommuting — 19,000 of the company’s employees currently working 
around the world have access to “flexible offices.” Sun recently did a study 
to determine whether telecommuting actually saved energy and impacted 
the planet or simply shifted energy costs to employees who worked at home. 
Here are some of the significant results of their research:
 
✓ Their employees saved $1,700 per year in gas and vehicle maintenance 
by working at home 2.5 days a week.
 
✓ They consumed less energy because equipment in the office drew two 
times the amount of energy (130 watts per hour compared to an average 
of 60 watts per hour).
 
✓ The savings in the footprint size for the employee was enormous, reduc-
ing 98 percent of the employee’s carbon footprint for work.
 
✓ Each employee reduced energy normally used at work by 5,400 kWh 
(kilowatt-hours) each year.
 
✓ Working from home saved employees 2.5 weeks of commute time in a 
single year.
Very encouraging, isn’t it?
To get the full benefit of your telecommuting (and be able to tell your story to 
others), do your own data gathering. You can use the following list for your 
data collecting:
 
✓ Track your drive to work: Include the number of miles, how many times 
a week, approximate drive time, number of minutes per week, gallons of 
gas used, price of gas, gas consumed per week, CO2 emission (from your 
carbon footprint).
 
✓ Track your time at the office: Include kWh at the office, systems used, 
utility cost per employee for working hours (if available).
 
✓ Track your work at home: Track values for kWh at home, systems used, 
utility costs for working hours.
 
Create an Excel spreadsheet to track the various data elements over time; this 
enables you to calculate your green savings and create charts based on your 
findings.

D
epending on your personality and natural abilities, you may either love 
the idea of designing and setting up a home office — or hate it. Some 
people approach the creation of the home office the same way they think 
about where to put the dirty laundry — anywhere’s fine. Others put a lot of 
thought and energy into creating the space that will support the focus, effi-
ciency, and ultimate productivity of their days. Can you tell which group we 
belong to?
It’s worth the effort — for you, your family, and the planet — to spend a little 
time and effort creating a green home office that enables you to get the most 
out of your technology (without sapping all your energy — internal and exter-
nal), that creates a small CO2 footprint, and that uses earth-friendly materials. 
That’s what this chapter is all about: good ideas and some great resources 
for designing, setting up, equipping, and beautifying your home workspace.
Peering Through a Green Lens 
at Your Home Office
So you’ve probably already heard — ad nauseum, we bet — that the basic 
principles of greening involve reducing your consumption, reusing what you 
can, and recycling the rest. This approach works not just for technology but 
also for the furniture and surrounding environment that supports it — and you.

270
Part IV: Telecommuting, Teleconferencing, and Teleporting 
Use the following lists of questions to help you look at your needs for office 
space through a green lens:
Reduce
 
✓ Can you reduce the amount of tech equipment (laptops, printers, scan-
ners, and more) you use on a daily basis, sticking perhaps with one 
laptop and turning on the printer only when you need it?
 
✓ Can you consolidate the area you use to create a compact but comfort-
able workspace?
 
✓ How can you use natural lighting to reduce the amount of electricity 
pumping into the area?
 
✓ Can you use blinds and floor coverings to help manage room tempera-
ture so you can turn the thermostat up (or down)?
 
✓ Do you have a reduction plan that helps you minimize the use of paper 
and plastics in your work area?
 
✓ How can you go electronic whenever possible? One possible option 
includes making backups on reusable media or online.
Reuse
 
✓ What do you already have around the house that you can use for a desk, 
a chair, storage, and bookshelves?
 
✓ What in your home or current workspace can be reused to support your 
work effort?
 
✓ How can you share resources in a way that benefits the rest of the 
house?
 
✓ What items in the attic could be given a second life in a home workspace?
Recycle
 
✓ Do you have older equipment in your workspace that you want to 
replace with newer, greener equipment? Recycle the existing equipment 
using a service offered by the manufacturer, using a retail outlet like 
Best Buy, or by looking up a local reputable recycler on Earth911 (www.
earth911.com).
 
✓ Are you planning to recycle all office supplies you can — toner or inkjet 
cartridges, paper, books, and more?
 
✓ How often do you take a look at what you’re recycling to see whether 
you can ramp it up a bit?

271
 Chapter 14: Telecomm Central: The Green Home Office
 
Your workspace doesn’t have to be all function and no fun. Use fabrics and 
textures to put some life on the walls and add visual interest. The colors and 
patterns keep your brain awake and help give you a productivity and energy 
boost.
When to reuse, when to buy
It may be a natural human tendency — or 
worse, genetically encoded into our DNA — 
that when we start something new, we want to 
buy new stuff to go along with it. Green efforts 
would suggest that this consumerist lifestyle is 
more fabricated than inborn. We don’t really 
need a brand-new desk, a $700 ergonomically 
designed earth-friendly office chair, and a com-
pletely new super-green laptop to telecommute 
successfully.
Your office can be green without a $2,000 
investment. In fact, some would say that the 
more you spend, the less green it may ultimately 
be. So knowing when to reuse what you have 
and when to buy something new is part of the 
equation you need to weigh as you set up your 
home office. Simple is good, but efficient is just 
as good if not better. Here are some points to 
consider as you think through the whole reuse-
versus-buy thing:
 ✓ Is the computer (or monitor, printer, desk, 
chair, lamp) working now?
 ✓ Does it do what I need it to do?
 ✓ How much power does it use?
 ✓ Is it missing any features I really need to 
have to work successfully?
 ✓ What materials were used to make it?
 ✓ Does it emit any toxic chemicals into my 
environment?
 ✓ Does it have a greener counterpart?
 ✓ How much energy does the possible 
replacement use?
 ✓ What is the replacement made of?
 ✓ What is the cost (in dollars and CO2) of 
using this computer (or monitor, printer, 
desk, chair, or lamp) over time?
 ✓ What is the cost (in dollars and CO2) of using 
the replacement instead?
Chances are that as you work through this list, 
some items jump out at you as deal breakers, 
either for or against buying the new system. 
Think through the costs — in terms of your own 
financial considerations and the longer-term 
planetary impact — before you decide either 
way.
One other idea to think about: If you or your 
employer is at all tentative about the work-at-
home thing, hold off making an investment in a 
new greener computer system or renovating 
a green workspace until you know the idea is 
going to stick (unless you plan to continue doing 
some work at home, regardless).

272
Part IV: Telecommuting, Teleconferencing, and Teleporting 
Figuring Out What You Need 
to Work Efficiently
In keeping with the low-footprint model, think through what you really need 
in your home workspace to be most effective telecommuting. What types of 
tasks does your job involve? Perhaps you’d choose a few from this list:
 
✓ E-mail and Web research
 
✓ Writing and editing documents
 
✓ Talking with customers and vendors on the phone
 
✓ Graphic design and layout
 
✓ Designing and offering Webinars for clients and colleagues
 
✓ Proofreading legal documents
 
✓ Designing new product prototypes
 
✓ Managing accounts
 
✓ Doing bookkeeping tasks
 
✓ Creating media — audio and video — productions
Although different types of tasks bring up different kinds of needs, in general, 
if you’re going to work at home, you need a space that offers room for three 
primary elements of the work-at-home space:
 
✓ Room for computer system(s) and peripherals
 
✓ Room for research
 
✓ Room for conversation (virtual or face-to-face)
Envisioning the Layout
You might want to sketch a few possible configurations for the space you’ve 
got, showing traffic flow, wall outlets, and where you can get natural lighting 
during the day. (This impacts where you put the monitor so you don’t pick 
up glare on the screen.)
Instead of running to the store and buying a pack of grid paper you’ll never 
use again, use Microsoft PowerPoint to sketch the layout of your room. 
Here’s how to do that:

273
 Chapter 14: Telecomm Central: The Green Home Office
 
1. Choose Start➪Microsoft Office➪Microsoft Office PowerPoint 2007.
 
 The program launches and displays a blank opening slide.
 
2. On the Home tab, click Layout in the Slides group.
 
 A drop-down list of slide layouts appears. (See Figure 14-1.)
 
3. Click Blank.
 
4. Click the View tab and click Gridlines.
 
 A grid of dotted squares appears on the slide. By default, the gridlines 
are set at 1-inch intervals, which equate nicely to square footage for 
your office space.
 
5. Use the grid and the Shapes tools on the Insert tab to draw the ele-
ments for your office.
 
 Remember to start with a rectangle or square for the size of the room, 
and indicate the wall outlets, the door, and windows before you add 
furniture. Your layout might look something like Figure 14-1. See, no grid 
paper needed!

Part IV: Telecommuting, Teleconferencing, and Teleporting 
Choosing Your Office Location
You don’t need a huge space for a green home office — in fact, efficiency is 
really the name of the game. If you can create a space that meets your needs 
for technology and focus in a corner of your dining room, more power to you! 
With a little thought about the way you put it all together, you can create an 
earth-friendly spot where your work-at-home efforts can flourish.
In general, as you choose the spot for your workspace, keep these ideas in 
mind:
 
✓ Your computer and peripherals need access to power, a router (Wi-Fi or 
wired), and each other.
 
✓ Your work area should be off the main traffic flow of the house so that 
contracts don’t get mixed in with coloring pages.
 
✓ If your workspace is part of another room, consider using a credenza 
or creating shelves with cabinet doors so you can put away your work 
when you’re not working.
 
✓ Create your workspace in an area that is well-ventilated and gets fresh 
air whenever possible (your technology will thank you).
 
✓ If you have an extra room or want to create a space for your home office, 
plan to go as green as possible with paint, lighting, floor and window 
coverings, and furnishings.
Talking Green Furnishings
After you know the general layout of the room and have checked out where 
the outlets are, how the traffic flows, and where your sources of natural light 
come from, you can start to think about what kinds of furnishings you need. 
Depending on how you like to work, you’re probably looking at the following 
pieces:
 
✓ A desk, a chair, and maybe a bookshelf (or two)
 
✓ A small printer/router/miscellaneous table
 
✓ An additional table for spreading things out
 
✓ Other seating, if you think you’ll have visitors
 
✓ Lighting
 
✓ Window treatments
 
✓ Stuff for the walls

275
 Chapter 14: Telecomm Central: The Green Home Office
After you’ve thought through all the items you hope to collect for your office, 
you can put together a shopping list and start the scavenger hunt — er, 
resale shopping. The following sections help you get started with a few green 
ideas.
Start with the desk
The options for your desk are limitless — you can use anything from an old 
door on two boxes (done that) to plastic milk crates (which you can consider 
green if you’re reusing them) to a $1,200 (or more) designer desk. In gen-
eral, to stay as green as possible and find something that is comfortable and 
healthy for you to use, use the following ideas as a guide:
 
✓ See whether you can make use of something you already have — a desk, 
dresser, credenza, table — before you go out and buy something new.
 
✓ If you do buy new, stay away from cheap pressboard computer worksta-
tions. They are often treated with varnish that includes formaldehyde, 
which flies around in the air for you to inhale.
 
✓ Consider shopping second-hand. Why not make use of a desk someone 
else doesn’t need anymore? When you get it home, clean it with eco-
friendly cleaners and arrange it in the room. You just might find a great 
deal (which is half the fun) and put something to good use that was just 
taking up space in a resale shop.
 
✓ Find a desk to suit your work style. Some people like gargantuan work-
spaces; others prefer the smallest tabletop possible. Still others prefer 
laps for laptops. (If you do that, though, get a lap desk to help mitigate 
the heat and buffer any unwanted vibes.)
 
✓ Make sure the desk is the right height for you. An adjustable chair helps 
with this, of course, but if you’ve purchased a bar table for your office 
and you get sick of raising the chair and having your feet dangling when-
ever you work, you’re not going to be too productive.
 
✓ Find a desk big enough to give you room to work comfortably even if 
you have other components — the laptop, your router, other peripher-
als — taking up space.
 
✓ Are you really, really, really tight on space? Think about getting a trans-
former desk, which can be transformed and used for other things when 
you’re finished using it as a desk. (No kidding.) For a fun article on trans-
former furniture, see the WebUrbanist page at http://weburbanist.
com/2008/02/24/10-more-pieces-of-clever-transforming-
furniture-from-tetris-tables-to-rooms-in-a-box/.

276
Part IV: Telecommuting, Teleconferencing, and Teleporting 
If you decide you want to buy a new green desk for your computer equip-
ment, here’s what to look for. A green desk is
 
✓ Built to last a long, long time
 
✓ Designed with the environment in mind
 
✓ Made of earth-friendly materials
 
✓ Made without any kind of hazardous finish (like the cheap glue and 
polish on pressboard pieces)
 
✓ Easy to set up and repair, if necessary
Find the chair
People who love a good chair will tell you — until you are inclined to agree — 
that spending $500 on a place to put your backside for hours at a time is a 
great investment. Your family doctor might agree as well. The chair you sit 
in — and the length of time you sit in it — has a lot to do with your posture, 
your comfort, and the way you feel (sleepy or awake? scattered or focused?) 
as you work.
But for every person who swears by a fine ergonomic chair, someone else is 
sitting on an exercise ball. And another person kicks back in a recliner with a 
laptop on her knees. So don’t take any chair recommendations as gospel — 
go try a few, and take your laptop if you can.
Chances are that you can pick up a good deal on cheap executive seating. 
Start by looking online at places like FreeCycle.com (www.freecycle.com), 
craigslist (www.craigslist.com), or eBay (www.ebay.com). (Remember, 
however, that if you don’t buy locally, you’ll pay shipping charges and add 
CO2 emissions as well.)
 
Although the general characteristics of a green chair are similar to that of a 
green desk (built to last, uses earth-friendly materials, and no toxic chemi-
cals), chair-dom has another consideration: the Cradle-to-Cradle certification. 
When you’re looking for a green chair, you have the added benefit of looking 
for manufacturers who are making the effort to
 
✓ Use materials that are safe and healthy for the environment
 
✓ Employ materials that can be reused, recycled, or composted
 
✓ Use renewable energy in the manufacturing of the chair
 
✓ Maximize energy efficiency in manufacturing

277
 Chapter 14: Telecomm Central: The Green Home Office
Yes, there really are manufacturers already doing this. You can find out more 
about Cradle-to-Cradle certification at www.c2ccertified.com. Similar to 
the EPEAT certification for green technology, Cradle-to-Cradle (C2C) certifi-
cation offers gold, silver, and bronze standards. For example, the Steelcase 
Think Chair and Stool (www.steelcase.com) received a gold rating from 
Cradle-to-Cradle certification. The designers are quoted as saying that they 
considered where the chair comes from, how it is made, and “what it will be 
when it is no longer a chair.” The chair is 99 percent recyclable, easy to dis-
assemble, made of 44 percent recycled material, and certified for indoor air 
quality. Pretty impressive array of greenness, all in a single chair. You may 
work better just by looking at it.
Bookcases and more
Sure, wood is beautiful and warm, and it adds that feeling of home to the 
room. But if you had the option of looking at a beautiful tree growing outside 
your window or seeing that same tree across the room holding your books, 
which would you prefer?
Although we can’t do much about the trees we’re already using to store 
books, albums, CDs, and our various technological components, reusing what 
we already have — and not consuming any more trees — is a good, green 
practice. You can make your own bookshelves, of course (like you did in col-
lege) with bits and pieces of flotsam and jetsam you find around the house.
Or you can try cardboard. Earlier in this chapter, we mentioned a design 
company called Nothing that created their office space from cardboard. The 
fun thing about this is that of all the disposable-sounding materials we have 
to work with, cardboard sounds the most wasteful of them all. Who can make 
anything durable out of cardboard? It gets soggy and limp; it’s not sturdy; it’s 
temporary.
Today’s green furniture designers disagree. Case in point is cardboard-
design’s SHELVES55 cardboard bookshelf. The cardboarddesign company 
uses a honeycomb cell shape to create furniture that is very sturdy and 
lightweight as well. All pieces — which include everything from tables to 
bookshelves to vases and more — are made of recycled cardboard (which 
reduces the waste going into landfills) and use natural adhesives to hold 
everything together. In the end, the entire piece can be recycled and turned 
into another table or bookshelf, if you like.
Similar to bamboo in its ubiquity, as well as in the way it can be used to 
replace many traditional materials, cardboard makes up a huge percentage of 
recycled material and doesn’t use any toxic chemicals — or trees.

Adding Green Touches
So are things beginning to come together? Moving from the big picture — 
designing the layout and adding the furniture — we’re narrowing in on some 
of the more specific green items now. In this section, you get to think about 
the way you set up your lighting, temperature controls, and air quality to 
support green work-at-home conditions.
Lighting
The lighting in your workspace may have a lot to do with when you work and 
the brightness level of your laptop monitor. (Here’s a hint: Sitting in a totally 
dark room staring into a laptop screen at full brightness is not good for your 
eyes. Remember how your mom wouldn’t let you sit closer than three feet to 
the television screen? The same rule applies.)
The greenest lighting you can find is, of course, natural light. Depending on 
where your office is in the house, you need something to help you manage 
and reflect that light, however. For example:
 
✓ Using natural blinds both helps reduce glare and reflect light into the 
room.
 
✓ Painting the walls a natural, light color helps brighten the room and 
makes better use of natural light.
 
✓ Positioning your desk so that it receives reflected — not direct — sun-
light reduces monitor glare and makes reading easier.
 
Still having a problem with monitor glare? Here are three things to try: Angle 
or turn your monitor screen slightly so the angle of the reflection changes; 
adjust the blinds upward to catch and reflect the light instead of allowing it 
into the room; and use a lamp instead of natural light to stop the glare on the 
monitor.
If you don’t have natural lighting — or you need to work after natural light 
has long since gone to bed for the night — your next greenest option is using 
CFL (compact fluorescent light) bulbs. Get rid of those incandescent bulbs 
once and for all. CFLs are just a little more expensive upfront and last more 
than 10 times longer.

279
 Chapter 14: Telecomm Central: The Green Home Office
Here are a few other lighting tips to help you stay as green as possible and 
maximize your use of electricity for lighting:
 
✓ Only turn on the light you need for the task at hand.
 
✓ Consider solar-powered lighting where possible.
 
✓ Remove and safely dispose of any halogen lights you may have (they’re 
energy guzzlers).
 
✓ When you can use reflected sunlight, turn off the other lamps in the 
room. You can create ambience another way.
Circulation and temperature controls
So what’s the temperature in your house? Depending on the location of your 
home office, what kind of air flow it gets, and how your home is heated, you 
may be boiling like a sausage or freezing like an icicle in your work-at-home 
space.
Like everything else in green-dom, the least amount of intervention, the 
better, so if you can work with the natural elements — by opening windows, 
using a ceiling fan, or working in your office during optimum temperature 
times — so much the better. If you need to do something to manage the 
temperature of your work environment, use these tips to make low-footprint 
changes:
 
✓ Start with what you’re wearing. Add a sweater or take one off.
 
✓ Block out the heat by closing blinds or curtains.
 
✓ Increase the temperature of a room by opening curtains wide on a 
sunny day.
 
✓ Make sure windows are well caulked so that drafts aren’t getting in — or 
out.
 
✓ Open windows whenever possible — in the cool of the day, for 
example — to get fresh air flowing into the space and even out the 
temperature.
 
✓ Use air flow from the rest of the house to keep the temperature more 
constant. You can do this by thinking of the air circulation patterns in 
your home now and making sure vents and doors help bring the air to 
where you’re working.
 
✓ Use an air filter to keep the air fresh, clean, and moving.

280
Part IV: Telecommuting, Teleconferencing, and Teleporting 
Know your energy use
In Chapter 2, we discuss how to figure out how much CO2 you are responsible 
for adding to the planet. In Chapter 3 and Chapter 9, we show you how to keep 
an eye on your power consumption and begin to manage it more effectively.
In your home office, you have a unique opportunity to find out just how much 
power it takes to do what you do for a living — and then find out how to cor-
rect that by reducing what you can and offsetting the rest.
 
Invest in a Kill-A-Watt power meter so you can keep an eye on the number of 
watts you’re using in your office, and use a smart power strip to automatically 
turn off any peripherals that are leaching power. Be sure to use the power man-
agement settings in your computer (set this up on your Energy Star monitor and 
printer, as well) and get a good read on the energy you’re using. You may be 
pleasantly surprised! (Or, you may find room for growth.) Either way, it’s a good 
story to tell at the staff meeting in the office next week — and it helps reinforce 
the good vibe for telecommuting for those who follow in your path.
Don’t forget the plants
Decades ago, research showed that plants have feelings and respond to other 
life forms in their environment. You can add to the living green essence of 
your workspace by inviting some green growing friends to cohabitate with 
you.
Certain kinds of plants are known for their ability to clean the air and 
improve the quality of the breaths we take. Here are a few of the most popu-
lar plants, along with a description of what they do for our environment:
 
✓ The Areca palm is a slender and graceful plant that removes chemicals 
from the air and releases significant moisture into the air.
 
✓ The Peace lily is a beautiful plant that removes air toxins and “breathes 
out” moisture into the air. The range of chemicals it cleans is amazing: 
alcohols, acetone, trichloroethylene, benzene, and formaldehyde.
 
✓ The Boston fern is best at removing chemicals from the air but it can 
be a little fussy — it likes to be misted regularly or the leaves go brown 
along the edges.
 
✓ The lady palm has a fan-like leaf that can get very large (up to 12 
inches). It is resistant to insects and cleans the air very effectively.
 
✓ The bamboo palm cleans the air of toxins such as formaldehyde and 
humidifies the air.

281
 Chapter 14: Telecomm Central: The Green Home Office
 
✓ The rubber plant is easy to grow and requires little light, so it’s a good 
candidate for a home office with few windows. Like the other plants 
listed here, it is a good air cleaner, removing chemicals and other toxins 
from the air.
Sustaining Green Practices
Part of keeping your green workspace green involves making sure your daily 
work practices stay green as well. In the office, the procedures you follow for 
things like printing, recycling, changing the thermostat, and purchasing prob-
ably have some kind of protocol that everyone follows. What will you do at 
home?
As you begin to work in your home office, think about the green aspect of 
common work practices to help give yourself a green guide to energy and 
resource-friendly approaches. Here are a few ideas to get you started:
 
✓ A print plan: Only print items that you must review on the page — and 
only use paper with a high percentage of post-consumer recycled mate-
rial. When you do print, print double-sided, use all the scrap pieces you 
can, and go electronic wherever possible.
 
✓ An energy use plan: Know which items you want turned on as a matter 
of course in your office and which should remain unplugged until you 
need them. Set your computer and all peripherals to shut off instead of 
hibernating or sleeping if you plan to be gone for more than two hours.
 
✓ An energy acquisition plan: Buy renewable energy if you can — your 
local utility company may have an option that enables you to purchase a 
certain amount of your electricity from renewable resources. The costs 
are just a little higher than normal utility rates and, well, it’s green.
 
✓ A resource use plan: Bottled water. Need we say more? We all knew the 
massive proliferation of plastic bottles was going to catch up with us 
someday. Use an earth-friendly refillable bottle — or here’s an idea, use 
a glass! — for the water you drink during the day. Another resource sav-
ings — use rechargeable batteries whenever possible for devices, mice, 
keyboards, and more.
Buying Green Office Supplies
Now that you’ve got this great green space to work in, you need a way to 
keep it fresh and clean. Instead of using traditional cleaning supplies that 
include bleach and chlorine, with just a little effort you can find earth-friendly 
products that help keep the dust bunnies at bay.

282
Part IV: Telecommuting, Teleconferencing, and Teleporting 
The Green Office Web site (www.thegreenoffice.com) evaluates prod-
ucts based on their green claims and lets you know — through the use of 
the rating system shown in Table 14-1 — in what ways the supplies really 
are eco-friendly. You can search for all kinds of supplies, add your own com-
ments on things you’ve tried, and find out more about what it means to go 
green. (See Figure 14-2.)

G
ood communication is the heart of collaboration. No matter how many 
people may be working on your team, what continent they live on, or 
what kind of technology they use, if you have the means to connect, commu-
nicate, and work to understand each other, your relationships will grow, and 
you will get stuff done.
This chapter continues to build your green telecommuter toolkit by offering 
a number of ways you can ramp up your communication so that you’re truly 
in sync with your colleagues, across town or around the world. The fact that 
you can share these tools from anywhere — as with Web-based and cloud 
computing technologies — makes them green, flexible, and easy to scale up 
for a friendlier and greener planet.
Communicating with the Office
When you first talked to your employer about the possibility of telecommut-
ing, you probably agreed to stay in seamless touch — or as close to seamless 
as you can get — by being accessible to your colleagues via e-mail, cellphone, 
and more.

284
Part IV: Telecommuting, Teleconferencing, and Teleporting 
Depending on the nature of your job and your position in the company, you 
may need to handle a variety of communication types, styles, and media. The 
nature of the team you’re collaborating with also makes a difference. One type 
of communication might be best for quick one-to-one questions; another might 
be more suitable if you’re working as part of a global, largely remote team.
Real-time communication includes face-to-face conversation, online chat, 
instant messaging, phone calls, and more. Take a look at Table 15-1 for a 
quick comparison of different types of communication you may use to stay in 
touch with colleagues at the office or around the world.

 Chapter 15: Collaborating and Cloud Computing
Meeting the Remote — and 
Globally Green — Team
Just a few years ago, working collaboratively around the globe was some-
thing unusual, something only huge mega-conglomerates with dozens of 
worldwide offices had to worry about. Today, not only do companies collabo-
rate often and easily across continents, but individuals working on smaller 
projects — whether for fun or profit or both — are collaborating easily, in 
real time, unrestricted by geographical distance.
Telecommuting enables you to work virtually anywhere, reducing travel 
times and CO2 emissions, helping you save time, money, and resources 
(which gives your happiness vibe a boost). Simply being able to do whatever 
you do from wherever you are is already a green effort! Nice.
Whether you have a team that works together continually for a single busi-
ness or you have a more fluid team that organizes and then disbands follow-
ing the lifecycle of a project, you can keep green computing at the heart of 
what you do. A green team, for example, should
 
✓ Have a plan about when to meet and how often
 
✓ Establish standards for the use of resources (what to print, what to 
share electronically)
 
✓ Make energy efficiency and reusability important priorities
 
✓ Look for ways to streamline processes
 
✓ Incorporate green ideas in their work and computer practice 
Finding Out What Makes 
Your Effective Team Tick
Whether your team is a collection of in-the-office and at-home members, or 
a more flexible grouping of people logging in from remote places all over the 
world — some by smartphone, some on laptops, others through Web-based 
interfaces on office computers — connection is the name of the game.

286
Part IV: Telecommuting, Teleconferencing, and Teleporting 
No matter how you all connect, the point at which you come together is where 
productivity happens. Whether your group is a new collection of coworkers or 
a team that’s been together for years, you can ramp up your productivity and 
get things done faster (which is green because it uses fewer resources in terms 
of both energy and time) by keeping a few team basics in mind:
 
✓ Know your common goal. It’s that focus on the thing that’s bigger than 
we are that helps pull a team together and get them moving in the same 
direction. That goal might be the next big conference you’re working 
to pull together; or it might be a new initiative your company is launch-
ing in the fall. Whatever your goal, make sure all members of the team 
understand it clearly and are working toward that end. In your team 
communications, regularly include progress reminders and updates. 
How close are you to reaching the goal? How far do you have to go?
 
✓ Coordinate your process. Each member of your group is an individual, 
but when it comes to team building, having similar processes — for 
checking in, reporting on progress, updating the group, and so on — 
helps create the shared experience that reinforces the group. Establish 
some norms right off the bat that everyone can use to complete basic 
group tasks and watch how the team begins to gel.
 
✓ Keep communication clear. Good communication is at the heart of 
every healthy relationship, and building connections with and among 
team members is no exception. Communicate regularly, consistently, 
and often — through e-mail, by phone, in Web conferences, on your 
SharePoint site — by whatever means your team prefers. Regular com-
munication builds trust and helps everyone feel that the team is making 
progress and that they are an important part of the team. With those 
pieces in place, your group is well on the way to meeting its goal.
E-mail cc etiquette
To cc all or not? Few of us like to read through 
a dozen different e-mail messages that really 
don’t pertain to us. Perhaps two team members 
are talking about which shade of orange should 
be used on the new logo. Do you really want to 
weigh in? And yet in terms of team formation, 
having access to the entire conversation — 
whether you participate or not — is an important 
part of feeling a part of the group. So press Delete 
if you want, but be glad you’re in the loop.

287
 Chapter 15: Collaborating and Cloud Computing
Exploring Communication Options
Depending on the expectations of your workplace and those on your team, 
you may use a variety of ways to stay in touch with the office. Each of these 
technologies offers a green alternative to driving there and participating face-
to-face. That’s the good news.
Adding your work e-mail address 
to a Web-based account
Sending e-mail messages is the most common way to stay in touch with mem-
bers of your team, whether you are working on a shared project, updating a 
manager about a recent change, checking on the status of an order, or some-
thing else. You can use e-mail to carry on the normal work of the office and 
stay up-to-date on last-minute changes.
You may want to use Web-based e-mail to send and receive messages from 
work. Some Web-based message clients, like Windows Live Hotmail, enable 
you to include your work e-mail address as a proxy address so that clients, 
vendors, and colleagues who may not recognize your Web-based e-mail 
recognize your work address. Use the following steps to include your work 
e-mail address on the messages you send from Windows Live Hotmail:
 
1. Open your Web browser and navigate to your e-mail account.
 
 This might be Windows Live Hotmail, as shown in Figure 15-1, or another 
Web-based e-mail tool.
 
2. Click New to begin a new message.
 
3. Click the arrow to the right of the From line.
 
 A drop-down list shows you the current e-mail address and the option 
Add an E-Mail Address.
 
4. Click Add an E-Mail Address.
 
5. Click Add Another Account to Send Mail From.
 
 A page appears so that you can enter your work e-mail address in the 
Add an E-Mail Address line. Windows Live Hotmail sends a message to 
your account so that you can verify adding the account.

to go when 
you want 
to stay in 
touch with 
the office 
easily.
 
 
6. Click Send Verification E-mail.
 
 In just a few seconds, an e-mail message arrives in your work e-mail 
Inbox. If you can remote in to your system to click the link and verify the 
e-mail account, do so now. If you’re not able to remote in, simply click 
the link the next time you’re in the office and the e-mail account will be 
available in Windows Live Hotmail.
Now you’ll be able to choose the work e-mail account to add to the From line 
when you send an e-mail message.
 
Some free e-mail tools insert a line of advertising at the bottom of the sent e-mail 
messages. If that bugs you, check out the e-mail settings for your service.
Just-in-time messaging
Another way to be immediately accessible to the office involves using the 
right-now approach of instant messaging. A number of instant messaging 
clients are available — all free and all able to give you quick access in popup 

289
 Chapter 15: Collaborating and Cloud Computing
boxes on the user’s desktop. If your message recipient is looking at the 
screen, she will see your message pop up. And hopefully — if she’s not in the 
middle of something — she’ll answer it.
Popular instant messaging programs include these:
 
✓ Windows Live Messenger
 
✓ AOL Instant Messaging
 
✓ Yahoo! Messenger
 
✓ Skype
The idea behind instant messaging is very simple. You build a list of contacts 
you connect with regularly; the instant messaging program shows you which 
of your contacts is currently online. You can then double-click the name of 
one of your online friends to open an Instant Message window, type a mes-
sage to the person, and click Send. (See Figure 15-2.)
 
Figure 15-2:

to ask team-
mates quick 
questions in 
real time.

Part IV: Telecommuting, Teleconferencing, and Teleporting 
Keeping your colleagues clued in
One of the clear benefits of being in the office is proximity. Nan gets the 
design samples for the new magazine cover: Can you come to a quick review 
meeting in the conference room to share your thoughts on the design? Uri 
asks when you’ll be in next so the two of you can plan a strategy for the next 
e-mail marketing campaign. If your colleagues had easy access to your calen-
dar, they would be able to check your availability and know when to plan so 
you can attend important meetings.
Sharing is the next best thing to being there
You have several options for setting up and working with your calendar:
 
✓ If you are able to access your office computer from home, you can use 
your office software (perhaps Microsoft Office Outlook) to maintain your 
calendar; others at work can then tell which times are available for you.
 
✓ Without remote access, you can use a private, Web-based group site 
built perhaps on Microsoft SharePoint technology to work collabora-
tively, share calendars, and more. We cover SharePoint later in the sec-
tion, “Boring Name, Big Benefit: Windows SharePoint Services 3.0.”
Dos and don’ts for office IM
Some people love the convenience and easy 
access of instant messaging, and some people 
really don’t. Some IT professionals don’t like 
the security issues that this type of access can 
bring with it as well. Just to make sure you’re 
on the right side of chat etiquette, follow these 
simple IM rules:
 ✓ Keep it short and sweet. A quick question, a 
quick answer, and you’re done. Nice.
 ✓ Use it only when nothing else will do. If you 
can wait an hour or a day for a response, 
send e-mail rather than interrupting your 
colleague with an instant message.
 ✓ A little smiley goes a long way. One or two 
emoticons, okay. (See first bullet.)
Only put in an instant message something you’d 
be glad for the whole team to see. I know of one 
incident where a colleague vented some frus-
trations about a project in an instant message, 
not knowing that the person she was writing to 
was demoing new software for the entire work-
group. Her IM popped up in a message window 
in front of 20 people.
Instant messaging may be here-today-and-gone-
in-a-second, but you can keep a log of mes-
sages that functions as a transcript of your chat 
sessions. To check the settings in your instant 
messaging program, look for a Message History 
option in the program’s settings or preferences.

291
 Chapter 15: Collaborating and Cloud Computing
 
✓ You can also use a free, Web-based service (part of the cloud comput-
ing universe, which we explore more fully later in this chapter in the 
section, “Sticking Your Heading in the Clouds: A Smart Way to Work”) 
like the one shown in Figure 15-3 to give colleagues easy access to your 
always-up-to-date calendar. (Now you just need to keep it always up to 
date.)
 
Figure 15-3: 
Web-based 
calendars 
also enable 
you to 
share your 
schedule 
with others.
 
 
Some calendars let you sign up to receive a daily e-mail schedule of all the 
events you have planned for the day. It’s a nice perk — especially if you have 
such a full day you don’t want to take the time to check your calendar. You 
can have the message sent to your phone, too, if you’re going to be out and 
about.
Setting up calendar sharing
Before your coworkers are able to view the calendar you set up online, you 
need to turn on the sharing feature. In Windows Live Calendar (available 
through Windows Live Hotmail or Microsoft’s various other cloud offerings 
such as Microsoft Office Live or Office Live Workspaces), this is a simple 
task. Here are the steps:

292
Part IV: Telecommuting, Teleconferencing, and Teleporting 
 
1. Point your browser to your calendar site.
 
 For this example, we’re using Windows Live Calendar, available at 
http://calendar.live.com.
 
2. Sign in if you are prompted to do that.
 
 Some sites keep you signed in automatically so they recognize you when 
you return. (You set this up in your site preferences.)
 
3. Click the name of the calendar you want to share.
 
 In Windows Live Calendar, available calendars are listed on the left side 
of the page. A page displays more information about the selected calen-
dar, including the title, a description, and whether sharing features are 
turned on.
 
4. Click Edit Sharing.
 
 The next page walks you through choosing whether to share your calen-
dar and, if so, who you want to have access to it.
 
5. Click Share This Calendar.
 
 Additional options appear that enable you to choose the people you 
want to share the calendar with. (See Figure 15-4.) The three different 
options allow for different levels of permissions:
 
• Share Your Calendar with Friends and Family lets people view, 
add, and change the information they find in your calendar.
 
• Send Friends a View-Only Link to your Calendar enables people to 
see but not change your calendar information.
 
• Make Your Calendar Public posts your calendar as a public link so 
anyone can find and view (but not modify) your calendar.
 
6. Click Send Friends a View-Only Link to Your Calendar.
 
 Now your colleagues can view your calendar without logging in or sign-
ing up for a Windows Live ID.
 
7. Click Get Your Calendar Links.
 
 Windows Live Calendar reminds you that this publishes your calendar 
to a private space. 
 
8. Click OK to continue.
 
 The final page provides you with links you can use to preview the cal-
endar in a browser window, import the calendar into another calendar 
application, or view the calendar as an RSS feed.
 
9. Click Save.
 
 That’s it — you’re done. Now you’re ready to share the URLs with col-
leagues so they can find your available working-at-home times easily.

Boring Name, Big Benefit: Windows 
SharePoint Services 3.0
Windows SharePoint Services 3.0 is a Microsoft solution for collaborative 
teams that are working in any location — locally or remote. It’s a bit left-
brained and orderly, not a wild free-for-all on a Web page, but given that 
you’re trying to get things done in a somewhat efficient and orderly manner 
(aren’t you?), it’s a good, scalable tool.
Here are just a few of the tasks your team can tackle using Windows 
SharePoint Services:
 
✓ Share documents, images, and data files online.
 
✓ Build lists of tasks, events, announcements, and more.
 
✓ Create and post to blogs.
 
✓ Create a team wiki.
 
✓ Set up alerts so you know whenever new contents are added to the site.
 
✓ Set up tasks for team members so you can keep each other up-to-date on 
the progress of your project.
 
✓ See when other members are online so you can contact them directly.
 
✓ Add a variety of Web parts.
 
✓ Customize the interface to fit your team or company.
 
✓ Export data lists and documents easily for use in other business applications.

294
Part IV: Telecommuting, Teleconferencing, and Teleporting 
 
Windows SharePoint Services 3.0 offers a number of different levels of service 
so that companies and organizations with different needs can choose the level 
that best fits what they need. In addition to the basic features in SharePoint 
3.0, you can add social networking features and enterprise solutions. 
Designed to help teams collaborate as easily and as effectively as possible, 
Windows SharePoint Services gives you a variety of ways to work with team 
members, files, and group information. You can set up specific permissions 
for team members, fine-tuning the privileges needed for viewing, adding to, 
or modifying site information. Figure 15-5 shows the variety of items you can 
create and change using Windows SharePoint.
The task and scheduling feature in Windows SharePoint Services offers one 
way of keeping everyone on the same page as far as project progress goes. 
When each team member tracks their progress, the entire group can see 
easily what’s been accomplished and what still needs to be done. The steps 
for setting up a new task are simple:
 
1. Log in to your Windows SharePoint Services site.
 
2. In the left navigation bar, click Tasks.
 
 The Tasks list for your team appears in the workspace. The Assigned 
To column shows the person responsible for each individual task, and 
the Status, Priority, Due Date, and % Complete columns help you see the 
progress on each assignment.
 
3. Click New.
 
 The Tasks: New Item window appears, as shown in Figure 15-6. Here you 
will add the details of the task, assign it to someone, and add a descrip-
tion so that others can understand what it’s about.
Windows SharePoint Services: The bigger picture
Windows SharePoint Services 3.0 is a big 
topic — so big, in fact, that many books have 
been written about it. In this chapter, we wanted 
to give you a quick look at some of its capabili-
ties, but there is a lot more to explore. To find 
out about the different services available with 
Windows SharePoint Services, see the Office 
Online article, “Which SharePoint technol-
ogy is right for you?” at http://office.

Sticking Your Head in the Clouds: 
A Smart Way to Work
As Web services have continued to propagate fruitfully and our mobile life-
styles have continued to get more and more. . . well, mobile. . . it’s not sur-
prising that the way in which we define both how and where we work would 
change. The easy access and always-awake nature of the Web makes it pos-
sible for us to access files, events, and each other from wherever we have 
Internet access.

297
 Chapter 15: Collaborating and Cloud Computing
Cloud computing is the ability to get the services and software you need 
without being tied to a specific place or hard drive. Cloud computing ser-
vices provide you with a collection of software services — for example, the 
Calendar and Web-based e-mail tools we described earlier — when you need 
them, from wherever you happen to be. (See Figure 15-8.) And there are mul-
tiple ways to access the services, too. You can check e-mail on your phone; 
post a blog item via e-mail; or look up your favorite Shostakovich song and 
download it so you can add it to your Window Media playlist, even though 
you’re accessing your account through your sister-in-law’s iPhone.

Discovering how cloud computing is green
Cloud computing is a just-in-time, scalable alternative to having millions of 
computers on desktops that individual people use to do what they need to 
do. Sure, we’ll still need computers, but who’s to say what they will look like? 
Mobile phones, PDAs, perhaps smart interfaces in your electric car — what 
would the limits be if you could work anywhere, using powerful Web-based 
applications that enabled you to access your own files easily, from any point 
on the globe?

298
Part IV: Telecommuting, Teleconferencing, and Teleporting 
 
By reducing real-world hardware requirements, cloud computing — in theory, 
anyway — could potentially help to slow the rate at which our landfills and 
small villages are filling up with illegally dumped computers. Because cloud 
computing enables sharing reusable resources globally and is a scalable tech-
nology, the lion’s share of the power consumption happens in the data centers 
supporting the cloud.
Google Apps
One of the earliest offerings in the cloud computing skies — long before 
people were using the term, too — was Google Docs, a free online word pro-
cessor that Google enthusiasts could use to create, edit, print, and share 
simple documents. At first blush it was unsupported, which meant users had 
to tough through it on their own, but it was free and it worked. Not bad.
Today, Google Apps (www.google.com/apps) offers a number of free online 
applications that help individuals and groups accomplish all sorts of comput-
ing tasks. Whether you want to send e-mail, schedule appointments, share 
documents, or talk to someone near or far, there’s an application — a free 
application — to help you do that. If you want to create a Web site or wiki so 
your team can share its work with the world, Google Apps has you covered 
there, too.
Paperless office? Er, um . . .
So do you think it’s possible that one day your 
offices — your home office and your work 
office — will go paperless? Cloud computing 
may bring this closer than ever, and faster than 
you think.
 ✓ If you’re used to functioning in a cloud, 
where will you put the pages you print?
 ✓ If you can access a document 24/7 with a 
click of the button online, do you really need 
to download it and print it on that noisy, 
resource-hogging, paper-spewing gray 
device? (What’s that thing called, again?)
 ✓ And if you can simply point others to the link 
where the document is stored (giving them 
the right permission to be able to view it, of 
course), do you really need to print it, put it 
in an envelope, pay the ever-increasing U.S. 
postal rate, and mail it to them? (Especially 
considering they’ll have to wait three to five 
days to receive it, when the link gives them 
access instantly?)
Paperless isn’t just a wave in some far-off dis-
tant future — it’s becoming a reality fast enough 
to save a few trees today.

299
 Chapter 15: Collaborating and Cloud Computing
Google Apps also offers a Google Apps Team Edition designed to help teams 
work together effectively. The utilities involved in the Team Edition are 
Google Sites, Google Docs, and Google Calendar. You can find out more 
about the Team Edition by going to www.google.com/apps/intl/en/
business/team.html.
Zoho
Zoho (www.zoho.com) is an innovative company with a team of more than 
120 developers pumping out collaborative, business applications you can 
use — free or for a low cost — online at any time. Dig around their Web site 
to find some applications that help you work more effectively as a team, and 
some pretty hefty business tools that enable you to track, work with, and 
report on people, projects, and processes.
Signing up for Zoho is free (just go to www.zoho.com) and you can use your 
existing Google or Yahoo! login instead of creating a new one, if you’d rather 
do that. (Reuse, after all, is a green idea.)
Finding the right kind of hardware 
to work with clouds
One of the great perks of using cloud computing is that because the applica-
tions are stored and run online, the capabilities of your individual system 
aren’t as important as they are when you’re installing Dreamweaver CS4 on 
your laptop and you need umpteen gigabytes of storage space and eleventy-
six gigabytes of RAM.
More clouds to think about
Additional companies are already floating around 
in the cloud computing airspace. Most notably, 
you may be familiar with Microsoft’s new ini-
tiatives, including Office Live Small Business (a 
collection of online business services and a free 
Web site), Office Live Workspaces (online docu-
ment sharing, collaboration, and storage), and 
Microsoft Online Services, which all offer free or 
affordable applications online.
Amazon and IBM have teamed up to offer 
Amazon Web Services, a high-end Web-based 
IT solution for businesses that enables them to 
“rent” computing power and functionality on an 
as-needed basis. This kind of responsible scal-
ability reduces both risk and cost for business 
and provides a smart green option. Find out 
more at http://aws.amazon.com/.

A reasonably fast (and green!) laptop would be a very nice match for any 
cloud computing application, which means you may be able to do more with 
less computing power (which is also a green idea).
Hardware manufacturers are beginning to take advantage of the lower process-
ing demands for cloud computing by developing systems that provide access 
to the Web services without all the bells and whistles of full-feature computers.
A to Zonbu
The Zonbu computer (www.zonbu.com) is a tiny system with a small foot-
print — it uses only one-third the power of a normal (non-CFL) light bulb. 
The fast little system (1.2G processor) doesn’t have any moving parts (not 
even a fan), so what is there to wear out?
Zonbu offers six USB ports, has built in Wi-Fi, and comes with its own cloud 
computing software, offering the following applications:
 
✓ Browser, e-mail, IM, and Skype
 
✓ Word processing
 
✓ Photo editing
 
✓ Web publishing
 
✓ Games
 
✓ Music and movies
 
This little green system already does a good job cutting CO2 emissions, but 
just to take things completely down to carbon neutral, Zonbu buys carbon off-
sets to make up the difference.
The Moderro Xpack
The Moderro Xpack CPU is a small (paperback-sized, they say) unit that 
has a USB port for your keyboard and mouse, Ethernet and VGA cables, and 
optional Wi-Fi. This little system plugs into your monitor (and even has a 
little bracket you can use to attach it to the back if you really want to con-
dense things) and draws only about 13 watts of power. The only moving part 
is a backup fan, so wear-and-tear is kept to a minimum.
The manufacturer also includes Moderro Browser OS — they call it “desktop-
in-a-browser” — which is another form of cloud computing. Users can browse 
the Web and interact with all kinds of different Web services, while still using 
the Moderro OS to get things done. You can learn more at www.moderro.com.

elcome to a world where thoughts are tangible things, where you can 
zoom around the world and participate in an event without leaving 
your office, where you can brainstorm and tell jokes and plan projects collab-
oratively, in real time, adding hardly any CO2 to the atmosphere.
Think it’s virtual reality? Think again — it’s telepresence, the connection 
choice that’s actually better than being there.
No matter what your industry may be, you doubtless have meetings to attend — 
sometimes with peers, sometimes with administration or employees, sometimes 
with students or faculty, sometimes with clients. Meetings mean conversa-
tion, connection, and — until recently — gathering in one place. And the 
getting-everybody-in-the-same-room thing meant travel costs, hotel reserva-
tions, and rental cars. And two of the three of those items meant big CO2 
emissions.
This chapter is all about how to achieve those great meeting goals — 
connection, collaboration, and creative and productive work — without 
killing the planet. And what’s more, we show you that using these green 
technologies keeps more green in your budget, too.

Requesting Your Virtual Presence
Technology has come a long way since the early days of closed-circuit televi-
sions, when, in order to take a distance learning course, you had to drive 30 
miles to a central location (perhaps a school or an office) and sit in a room 
with a bunch of other adults, staring at a television on a cart while a talking 
head lectured you.
Yawn.
Today, easy-to-use software makes telepresencing — the ability to be in 
another location and participate fully, almost like you would if you were in 
the room — a real possibility and an affordable option for people all over the 
world. Telepresence works best when participants feel engaged in more than 
one sense — sight and hearing, for example — is involved.
 
Chapter 15 introduces the idea of asynchronous conferencing, which involves 
connecting with others in a way that doesn’t involve all parties being tuned in 
at the same time: person-to-person e-mail, posting to an e-mail list, participat-
ing on a Web forum, or adding content to a blog or wiki, for example. All those 
ways of staying in touch — with clients, colleagues, or coworkers — offer flexi-
bility so that you can contribute when the time is right for you.
Telepresence — the ability to communicate in real time, as fully present as 
possible — is synchronous conferencing, meaning that all participants are 
in contact with each other at the same time. Place is another matter, as the 
examples in this chapter show. When you are connecting in real time with 
others, you might use something simple, like instant messaging; Web-based, 
like Web chat; more formalized, like Web conferencing; or a big showy affair, 
like full video conferencing. Of course, you can also do the personal Webcam 
conferencing thing for video chats with friends and colleagues.
Getting Started with Telepresence
Your first mission — if you choose to accept it — is to decide which method 
of real-time communication you need to choose to accomplish your goals. If 
you simply need to chat with a coworker, you can pick up the phone or use 
instant messaging. To organize a brainstorming session, plan a new project, 
or assign roles and tasks (or check on project status), you can use a low-
footprint Web meeting to share ideas, talk, or chat online.

 Chapter 16: Making the Connection: Virtual Presence
If you’re thinking training, perhaps a Webinar or a videoconference — both 
are a little more formal, with more startup work — is what you need. This 
section shows you some of the basics for meeting virtually and throws in 
some tips on making sure your virtual presence makes the same (or even 
stronger) impact than your real-world presence would.
 
The key is to think through your meeting, event, or communication first — 
and then find the tool to support it. It’s out there. We’re sure of it!
Messaging, instantly
All sorts of companies now offer instant messaging — the big two are 
Windows Live Messenger (or MSN Messenger) and AIM (AOL Instant 
Messenger). You’ve probably tried — and maybe tried to get away from — 
instant messaging already. It’s the quick pop-up utility that somehow always 
appears in the lower corner of your screen at the worst possible time, like 
when you’re demoing a new product for a client or trying to appear really 
busy for your boss.
Got message?
AOL Instant Messenger was a big hit early on — the instant messaging client 
is downloadable and runs on your computer whether you’re an AOL sub-
scriber. It’s easy to use and has a small onscreen footprint. (See Figure 16-1.)
 
Figure 16-1: 
AOL Instant 
Messenger 
is free, 
simple, and 
fun, but 
maybe for 
after work.
 

304
Part IV: Telecommuting, Teleconferencing, and Teleporting 
If you don’t have AIM, you can download it (for free!) and run it on your com-
puter whether you use a Windows, Macintosh, or Linux machine. Simply go 
to http://dashboard.aim.com/aim, click Download, and click Run. The 
software should install smoothly, and you’ll be ready to add contacts and 
send instant messages in minutes.
 
AIM also offers a version of Instant Messenger, AIM Express, that’s completely 
Web-based, which means you don’t have to download it to your computer at 
all. Find out more about it at http://dashboard.aim.com/aim.
To start a conversation with a friend who is online, you simply double-click 
the contact name, type a message in the box that appears, and click Send. 
The message goes immediately to your contact (who hopefully replies). It’s 
a simple way to send a quick note: “Is our phone conference at 3 today?” or 
“Want to meet for lunch?”
In addition to having a quick real-time conversation, you can do the following:
 
✓ Play games
 
✓ Change your profile
 
✓ Create a custom away message
 
✓ Check your AIM mail
 
✓ Add utilities
 
Just a couple of years ago (which seems like decades, in computer evolution), 
AIM “Away” messages were all the rage. Students near and far seemed to be in 
a continual rush to see who could come up with the best/funniest/quirkiest/
most original Away message. (For you baby boomers out there, an Away mes-
sage is the message AIM displays when someone sends you an instant mes-
sage and you’re not available to receive it.) Is it possible that our love affair 
with the Away message led us to the ever-popular Facebook status update, 
and now, Twitter? Hmmm, interesting. . . .
Don’t shoot the Messenger
Windows Live Messenger (formerly known as MSN Messenger or Windows 
Messenger) is another popular instant messaging tool that plugs into just 
about everything Microsoft. (See Figure 16-2.) In Chapter 15, we cover 
Microsoft Office Live and Office Live Workspaces, which small businesses 
can use to create free Web sites, organize business contacts, and more. 
Windows Live Messenger plugs right into the Office Live workspace (making 
it an easy way to contact coworkers and clients for business purposes), but 
it’s also available as a free downloadable tool.

305
 Chapter 16: Making the Connection: Virtual Presence
Want to get Windows Live Messenger? Simply point your browser to 
http://download.live.com/messenger and click Download. In the 
File Download dialog box, click Run, and the software installs on your com-
puter. All things should be so simple.
 
Figure 16-2: 
Windows 
Live 
messaging 
is a little 
more busi-
ness and 
maybe a 
little less 
fun.
 
Windows Live Messenger offers a few features that make its use for business 
a little more palatable than AIM: The Shared Folders feature, for example, 
enables you to easily post files, presentations, and more into a Shared 
Documents workspace where others on your team can download them easily. 
You can also use Windows Live Messenger to make phone calls, set appoint-
ments, use a whiteboard, share applications, and, of course, chat.
Have Web, will meet
When your real-time business communication needs to go beyond the simple, 
“Hey, what about this?” kind of question, you may be ready to tackle a Web 
meeting. Web meetings give you a great way to save lots of things. They save 

306
Part IV: Telecommuting, Teleconferencing, and Teleporting 
the time it would take to drive to a meeting, the carbon emissions that travel-
ing requires, the trouble of reserving a meeting space, and all the preliminary 
work to gather the equipment you need. And that’s just the tip of the iceberg.
Would you believe us if we told you that you could organize an international 
meeting of all your site managers throughout the world — and host it this 
afternoon? Web tools make it possible, and even easy, to get people together 
for brainstorming, a formal meeting, professional development and training, 
or something else entirely. You just bring your creativity and a little technical 
know-how, and the Web tools do the rest.
Case in point: Cisco’s WebEx (www.webex.com). This simple but powerful 
Web meeting tool helps you set up a meeting, invite participants, and host a 
media-rich, engaged, and interactive meeting in a series of easy steps. You 
can show and view videos; work collaboratively on documents, presenta-
tions, and more; draw on a whiteboard; ask participants to take a poll; or just 
chat. The software is Web-based and has compatible versions for a variety of 
operating systems, so the attendees can use just about any kind of computer.
 
WebEx offers a free trial period in which you can host full meetings, capture 
content, and export everything you do, whether you sign up for the program. 
If you’re at all interested, try it out: Hey, nothing ventured, nothing gained, 
right? At the very least, trying it out helps you find out more about what you 
and your coworkers need in terms of a meeting management tool. To try it 
out, go to www.webex.com, click Free Trial, and follow the prompts.
Penciling in a meeting with WebEx
Here are the steps for scheduling a meeting with WebEx:
 
1. Click Host a Meeting in the navigation panel on the left.
 
 A set of three submenu items appears.
 
2. Click Schedule a Meeting.
 
 The Schedule a Meeting page appears, as shown in Figure 16-3.
 
3. Fill in the text fields as completely as you can.
 
 Enter a descriptive topic for the meeting and assign a password to guar-
antee security. Specify the date, time, and duration of the meeting.
 
4. In the Attendees box, type the e-mail addresses of the people you 
want to invite to the meeting.
 
 If you prefer, click Use Address Book and create new contacts for those 
you hope will attend. (You may want to wait to do this after you make a 
decision about whether to buy the program — no point in entering all of 
this information if you plan to just let the trial expire.)

5. Click Change Audio Options.
 
 The Audio Options dialog box appears so that you can review and 
change, if necessary, the audio portion of the meeting. (See Figure 16-4.) 
By default, WebEx is set up to combine teleconferencing (where partici-
pants can phone in) along with the shared Web interface and applica-
tions. Choose your options and click OK.
 
6. Click Start Now.
 
 An e-mail message is immediately sent to the recipients on your 
Attendees list, providing the following information:
 
  Meeting topic
 
  Date and time
 
  Meeting number and password
 
  The Web address for the meeting
 
  The teleconference call-in number
 
  Your e-mail address as the meeting host

Joining a Web meeting: C’mon in!
Pretend for a moment that you’re one of the participants who is thrilled to 
receive the Web meeting invitation by e-mail. Your part is even easier than 
the message host. Here’s what you do to join the meeting:
 
1. A little in advance of the start time for the meeting (say, five minutes), 
click the link in the invitation e-mail message you’ve received.
 
 This link takes you to a Web site that walks you through the process of 
downloading the software you need to join the Web meeting.
 
2. After the software downloads, click the Join Now button.
 
 A pop-up window appears, displaying the teleconference call-in number, 
the meeting ID number, and your participant number. To join the meet-
ing on the call, simply call the teleconference phone number when you 
sign in online.
 
3. Click OK.
 
 The Web meeting begins and the host is alerted that you have joined. 
Your name appears in the participant list in the top-right corner of 
the page.
What can you really do in a Web meeting, anyway?
You know, there are two kinds of people in the world: those who like to go to 
meetings and those who don’t. (Okay, that may be a bit of an oversimplifica-
tion, but still.) If you’re one of those people who hates to go to meetings — who 
thinks they are a waste of time, and you’d prefer to continue being productive 
at your desk — you will love Web meetings. And if you’re a person who is an 

309
 Chapter 16: Making the Connection: Virtual Presence
on-the-spot collaborator and thinks well in a group (and you love meetings), 
you will also love Web meetings. How can this kind of tool make everybody so 
happy?
If you have a focus and set objectives for your Web meeting, this technology 
really makes the most of your time, enables people to participate in a way 
that feels comfortable for them, and keeps ideas moving forward. What’s 
more, you can save it all and use it later, so that even your scribbles and dia-
grams don’t go to waste.
WebEx, for example, lets you do a number of things when the meeting goes 
live:
 
✓ You can display a document in the workspace so that everyone can see 
and review it together (by using the chat box or talking about it, if you’re 
all phoning in).
 
✓ You can demonstrate a new product or design, show a PowerPoint pre-
sentation, or play a video.
 
✓ You can let everybody draw or write on a whiteboard together and then 
discuss their ideas. (See Figure 16-5.)
 
✓ You can let the whole group see your desktop, where you can demo new 
software, teach a process, or highlight new features in an existing program.
 
Figure 16-5: 
Using a 
whiteboard 
is a great 
way to get 
the creative 
juices flow-
ing. Visual 
thinkers 
really shine 
in Web 
meetings.
 

310
Part IV: Telecommuting, Teleconferencing, and Teleporting 
 
Don’t let those good ideas (or really clever doodles) go to waste! You can save 
the contents of the whiteboard in UCF format (Universal Communications 
Format) by choosing File➪Save As. You can open and view the whiteboard 
UCF file by double-clicking the file in Windows Explorer. To find out more 
about UCF, go to www.teleconference.att.com/resv/wmucffaq.html. 
You can also sign up for a free trial of WebEx and watch the online demo to 
get a sense of how all the different features work together.
Get ready, get set, video conference!
Both Web meetings and some instant messaging tools enable you to use 
video to have some real face-to-face time in addition to audio and Web con-
nection. For many of your work-at-home kinds of meetings, a simple but qual-
ity Webcam and the meeting or instant messaging software are perfectly fine. 
On the other hand, when you need to organize a bigger event that involves 
hosting executives and dignitaries from other companies (c’mon, you know 
you spruce things up for dignitaries), you may want to consider a more 
sophisticated form of real-time presence via videoconferencing.
True high-quality video conferencing means buying a video conferencing 
system with enough power to do what you need it to do. Professional video 
conferencing systems are available for meeting rooms (and they include large 
display and speaker systems, easy integration and management of users, and 
data storage and retrieval) and for interpersonal meetings.
Tips for successful video conferences
Try to keep it real. People respond to people, so 
even though the person looking into your meeting 
from Shanghai is really staring at a camera, encour-
age eye contact. It fosters better understanding.
Size does matter. Researchers are discovering 
that we relate to people in a video conference 
when they are close to our own size, generally 
speaking. This means that if the person par-
ticipating in the meeting via videoconference is 
six inches tall or six feet tall on the conference 
room screen, a logic gap occurs. If your tech-
nology allows, try to arrange it so the person 
contributing appears in something close to real-
life size. It will enhance the understanding and 
connection going on in the meeting and can 
make the difference between whether people 
accept or resist the presenter’s ideas.
Make sure the technology is transparent. The 
real goal with telepresence is not “Look how 
neat this technology is!” but rather “This meet-
ing was so great; we forgot we were using 
fancy technology to pull it off.” Work out the 
bugs ahead of time, make sure your audio 
is good, and test the video feed beforehand. 
Everything goes more smoothly if you work the 
tech glitches out in advance.

311
 Chapter 16: Making the Connection: Virtual Presence
 
The best thing about the high-end option is the tons of CO2 it saves when the 
director of your Shanghai office doesn’t need to jet to Los Angeles twice a year 
for scheduled meetings. The planet Earth thanks you!
Reducing Your Carbon Emissions 
with Free Phone Service
You may have already heard about Skype, the traveler’s friend. Skype is a free 
communications tool that you can download from the Web. It enables people 
and businesses, family and friends, strangers and lovers, to talk — free — from 
anywhere in the world. The trick to the free part is that in order to get that 
rate, you both need to be Skype members. (Don’t worry — the membership 
is free, too.) If you want to call someone who is not a Skype member, you still 
can, but it will cost you (less, says Skype, than normal calling rates).
You just need to download the free software from www.skype.com, test out 
your microphone, set your audio levels, and you’re good to go. Skype offers a 
version for each of the big operating systems — Windows Vista, Windows XP, 
and Mac OS X. Plus, it has other popular offerings, such as an app for the iPhone.
 
Skype also offers a pay-as-you-go program so that you can buy cheap minutes 
(still an odd concept) for your mobile phone or rack up some savings for inter-
national non-Skype calls to someone else’s landline.
Getting started with Skype
Make sure you have your microphone and Webcam plugged in and ready 
before you get started. Depending on your system’s capabilities, your micro-
phone and Webcam may be built in; if that’s the case, you don’t need to do 
anything to prepare for using Skype. To prepare a microphone for use with 
Skype, simply plug the microphone in your audio port; to add a Webcam, plug 
it into an available USB port. If this is the first time you’re using your Webcam, 
have the CD handy so you can use it to load the Webcam drivers if prompted.
Here’s how to set up Skype. (It takes about 15 minutes.)
 
1. Go to www.skype.com and download the version of Skype that 
matches your operating system.
 
 The download instructions ask whether you want to run or save the soft-
ware. You can either click Save and save the Skype installation files for 
later, or you can go ahead and click Run to run it now.

312
Part IV: Telecommuting, Teleconferencing, and Teleporting 
 
2. When the software prompts you, start Skype.
 
3. In the Welcome Screen, click the Check Your Sound Works option.
 
 The Skype window appears. Make sure your microphone is connected to 
the proper port of your computer.
 
4. Click Call.
 
 The system calls the Skype automated call center so that you can check 
your sound levels. (See Figure 16-6.) If you can’t hear anyone speaking 
after a few seconds, turn up the volume on your computer.
 
5. When prompted, speak into your microphone.
 
 A status bar at the top of the call window shows you the length of the 
call and gives you a volume control so that you can adjust the volume.
 
Don’t click End Call! After a few seconds, your voice will play back to you — if 
your microphone is working. Then the automated caller gives you instructions 
for adjusting your volume as well as tips to try if things don’t seem to be work-
ing properly.
When all is said and done (literally), the automated caller hangs up and the 
call is ended. Now you’re ready to use Skype by calling other Skype users.

Calling all Skypers
When you know your system works properly, the next task involves adding 
your contacts to your Skype list. The steps are simple.
 
1. In the Skype window, click Contacts.
 
 This displays the Contacts menu, which offers everything you need 
to add new contacts, import your contacts from Microsoft Outlook, 
Outlook Express, or Yahoo! (so that you have more people to call 
online), set preferences about contact information, and manage your 
contacts.
 
2. Click Import Contacts.
 
 The Find Your Friends dialog box appears.
 
3. Select the check boxes of the program contacts you want to import, 
and click Search E-mail Contacts.
 
 When the search is complete, Skype displays a list of your contacts who 
are currently using Skype.
 
4. To add those people as contacts in your Skype list, click the check box 
to the left of each of their names and click Add Contact. If you don’t 
want to add them, click Skip.
 
 Skype then displays a list of all your contacts so that you can e-mail 
everybody, if you choose, and tell them to jump on Skype — and talk 
voice-to-voice for free.
 
5. Customize the e-mail message Skype drafts for you, select the check 
boxes of the people you want to send it to, and click Send.
 
 Or not. It’s your call . . . literally.
Adjusting your sound settings
If you haven’t used your microphone in a 
while — or ever — check your sound settings 
in the Windows Vista Control Panel by choos-
ing Hardware and Sound and clicking Sound. In 
the Sound dialog box, click Recording and click 
the Microphone selection. Click the Properties 
button and click Levels to set the microphone’s 
sensitivity level. Click OK to close the dialog box.
You can also adjust the volume level by click-
ing the Volume control icon (a speaker) in the 
notification area and adjusting the volume slide 
to the setting you want.

314
Part IV: Telecommuting, Teleconferencing, and Teleporting 
 
If you think that a certain person is on Skype but you don’t have him in your 
Contacts list, you can search for him by clicking in the Find a Specific Person 
text box and typing his full name, Skype ID, or e-mail address. Skype searches 
(quickly, too) and displays a full list of all the people in all countries on Skype 
who come close to that name or ID. Search the columns by country to narrow 
your search and then click the name of the person when you find him. A 
window opens automatically so you can send him a message right away and 
ask him to be your Skype buddy. Nice!
Presenting via Webinars
Here’s a riddle for you: When is a Web meeting not a Web meeting? Answer: 
When it’s a Webinar. Webinar is one of those postmodern words that mixes 
Web with seminar. When you have a large, organized training session — per-
haps professional development, software training, or some other kind of 
professional, here’s-how-you-do-it kind of event — consider using Web-based 
seminar software.
GoToWebinar (www.gotowebinar) is one example of a simple tool you 
can use to deliver all kinds of content in a collaborative Web format. 
GoToWebinar costs $99 per month but offers a free trial (and a lower-cost, 
GoToMeeting version for small businesses and individuals). You can create 
Webinars on the fly that include up to 200 people, or you can schedule larger 
events of up to 1,000 participants. This particular Webinar tool (the capabili-
ties may vary with other products) makes it easy for you to
 
✓ Make presentations in a media-rich format.
 
✓ Record the presentation as a podcast.
 
✓ Moderate discussions.
 
✓ Lead training sessions.
 
✓ Make transcribed notes and documents available automatically to all 
participants.
So, what’s the topic for your Webinar? Setting up a Webinar can be as simple 
as rolling out a new sales program to inspire your field sales reps. Or maybe 
you are hosting a Webinar for parents on how to apply for financial aid for 
their college students. Whatever your topic, with Webinar software like 
GoToWebinar, you can present the Webinar live and capture it as a full pod-
cast for those who missed it. Here are the steps:
 
1. Go to www.gotoWebinar.com and create a free trial account.
 
 Click the Try It Free button and the site walks you through the process.

315
 Chapter 16: Making the Connection: Virtual Presence
 
2. Log in using your e-mail address and password.
 
 The next page asks whether you want to launch a Webinar now or plan 
one for the future.
 
3. Click Schedule a Webinar.
 
 The Schedule a Webinar page provides a series of simple questions that 
enable you to set up the event quickly. (See Figure 16-7.) Enter the time 
and date, provide a Webinar name and description (remember that this 
information is used in marketing your event), choose your time zone, set 
audio options, and indicate whether you want participants to use pass-
words to access the Webinar.
 
4. If you plan to share the Webinar with other presenters, click Specify 
Panelists.
 
 Text boxes appear so that you can type the additional panelists’ names 
and e-mail addresses.
 
5. Click Save and Continue.
 
 If your Webinar is part of an ongoing training program — perhaps an 
introduction to different software features at the same time each week — 
click the Recurs down-arrow and choose the time frame (Daily, Weekly, 
or Monthly).

6. On the Branding and Theme tab, you design the look of your Webinar. 
If you like, click Upload Logo to add your company logo to the site.
 
 The logo image you upload must be smaller than 400 by 200 pixels in 
order to fit the logo space, so make sure your logo is the right size 
before you upload it.
 
7. Click through the themes and choose the one that best fits the look 
you would like to convey.
 
 The look and feel of the Webinar has an impact on the way your partici-
pants feel about the experience. Go for professional and friendly, and 
use colors and elements that help participants gain what they need (as 
opposed to distracting or overwhelming them).
 
8. Click Upload Custom Image if you want to add your own photos or art-
work to the page.
 
9. Choose the color for your Webinar waiting room (where participants 
gather before the Webinar begins).
 
 Click the Standard Color drop-down arrow and choose the color from 
the list. Or if you know the hexadecimal number for the color you want, 
click the Custom box and enter that number.
 
 If your company has official branding elements — for example, a logo, 
letterhead, business cards, and a Web site — chances are that your 
designer knows the hexadecimal numbers for the colors used in the 
design. For branding purposes, you should have consistent colors on all 
company communications rather than, for example, four different 
shades of blue on four different communications pieces.
 
10. Enter the presenter name, presentation title, and the company name 
(and upload the presenter’s photo, if desired).
 
11. Type a message in the text box to welcome participants when they 
arrive.
 
12. Preview the Webinar by clicking first Preview Theme and then 
Preview Waiting Room.
 
 After you preview the pages, you can go back and make any changes to the 
branding that you’d like to make: Click the Branding and Theme tab and 
choose other options. Looks good, though, doesn’t it? (See Figure 16-7.)
 
13. Click Save and Continue.
 
 The final page enables you to customize the types of information you 
request on the registration form.

whether you want registrants to receive replies immediately or after 
you approve their registration, and click Preview.
 
 If you want registrants to go to another site — perhaps your business 
site — after registering, enter the URL in the box provided.
 
15. Click Save and E-mail Me the Invitation.
 
 An e-mail message is immediately sent to all panelists (as well as you, of 
course). Keep the e-mail where you can find it easily before the Webinar 
and use it to log in the day of the event.
 
 GoToWebinar enables you to practice your Webinar before it goes live.

Connecting with Remote Desktop
Microsoft’s Remote Desktop Connection is one of those old standbys that isn’t 
particularly pretty, but it gets the job done. Remote Desktop Connection cre-
ates a secure means for you to access your at-the-office system when you’re 
working at home. And it’s not a feature tied to a single desktop, instead it’s an 
offering that entire businesses and organizations can use easily.
 
Check out this comparison chart of remote desktop software that is available for 
all different types of computers: http://www.remote-desktop-control.
com/eng/compare.html.
Remote Desktop Connection makes it easy for you to connect to a terminal 
server or to another computer running Windows. Your system administrator 
or IT person at the office needs to give you network access and the necessary 
permissions to connect in-house.
To log in to your office system using Remote Desktop Connection, follow 
these steps:
 
1. Click Start➪All Programs➪Accessories➪Remote Desktop Connection.
 
 The Remote Desktop Connection box appears, as Figure 16-8 shows.

2. In the Computer box, type the computer name provided by your 
system administrator (for example, remote.example.org) and click 
Connect.
 
 After a moment, your desktop changes its appearance and displays the 
Windows Security dialog box. (See Figure 16-9.)
 
3. Enter your username and password and click OK.
 
 If you want Windows Vista to remember your connection (and you prob-
ably do), select the Remember My Credentials check box before clicking 
OK. Remote Desktop Connection accesses the terminal server, and as 
long as the required permissions are in place, all shall be well, and you’ll 
be connected remotely. Simple, eh?

If you are using Remote Desktop Connection to access the server in your 
workplace, chances are that all the applications that are available to you 
when you are in the office — for example, Microsoft Office 2007 applications, 
your company database, graphics or Web software, and more — are available 
to your through your remote connection. You should be able to navigate to 
folders and files in your own server folder or in any of the shared folders to 
which you have access.
 
The desktop will look different from your own personal office PC — that back-
ground showing your new puppy won’t be visible, for example, because the 
space you’re seeing is really server space on the terminal server, not your 
actual desktop on the computer on your desk at work.

A
h, so you’re an entrepreneur! One of those can-do, never-say-die, 
genius-starts-here kind of people. Good for you! You need that chutzpah 
in this economy. The good news is that there’s always room for another good 
idea, and if the idea you want to grow (or are already growing) meets a need 
and distinguishes itself from the competition, chances are that buyers are 
waiting for what you offer.
But as you begin or continue that long climb to success, we want you to take 
some time to consider the planet that’s giving you the chance to be the next 
big thing. The choices you make today — for your facility, your staff, your 
products, and your customers — can either help the planet or contribute 
to the problems that have her in a choke-hold. This chapter is all about the 
small and big things you can do to make your small business greener and 
improve the world around you at the same time.
Getting to the Heart of the Matter
Whether you are just starting your own business or you’ve been in business 
for years, you probably have at the heart of your efforts some kind of vision 
that is driving everything. Perhaps you have a passion for your industry and 
want to make a difference. Maybe you are building something to pass on to 
your children and grandchildren. Or you might be living out a dream of excel-
lence, community, or industry. The list goes on and on.

322
Part IV: Telecommuting, Teleconferencing, and Teleporting 
Somewhere in the middle of that vision is the answer to the question “How 
is your business in partnership with the earth?” Depending on the nature of 
your industry, you may or may not see a direct connection. If you work in 
manufacturing, you use electricity, water, and perhaps oil and gas — natural 
resources — to accomplish your goals. If you work in a service industry, you 
rely on . . . let’s see . . . electricity, water, and perhaps oil and gas — to do 
what you do.
You purchase products, maybe make products, and perhaps sell products. 
You use things and discard them. You create a space — for yourself or for 
many — and furnish it with items that promote (we hope) both comfort and 
efficiency. All those choices have green options and not-so-green options. 
Your awareness and choice as a business owner can make a big difference for 
the planet.
So how does your business work in partnership with the earth? It’s a good 
question, and there are lots of ways to come up with — and act upon — good 
answers.
Trash to treasure
There’s a great scene in the Cary Grant movie Houseboat (okay, confession, 
Katherine is a fan) where our hero demonstrates to his unhappy pre-adoles-
cent son the cycle of life by pouring a pitcher of water onto a dock beside 
a lake. The water runs off the boards and into the water below. The water 
doesn’t disappear, he points out; it just becomes part of something bigger.
In this way — scientists will tell you this too, but Cary Grant does it stunningly 
well — we know that energy is never used up and items don’t go to waste — 
they really and truly just change form. They show up as something else.
So what are you doing with the items that you think you are throwing away? 
They may sit in landfills, which is a problem. They may leach dangerous 
chemicals into other peoples’ water sources, which is a really big problem. 
Or they may be converted into paper, plastics, glass, and aluminum that can 
be used in helpful ways that sustain the planet.
Ah, that’s nice — we knew we’d get to the good part eventually.
A major aspect of green business focuses on reducing the amount of waste 
you produce. Chances are that when you begin looking at green initiatives, 
you waste much more than you need to — and it’s pretty mindless. You don’t 
need something, so you throw it away. You printed 20 letters with the wrong 
letterhead? Just pitch it. What’s 20 pages in the scope of a business day?

323
 Chapter 17: Your Green Small Business 
Well, green efforts cause you to pause a minute and look at those pages you 
just tossed. The back of the page looks perfectly useable. You could print the 
draft of your report on those pages. Or cut them up and use them for scrap 
paper. Or take them home for the kids to draw on. Or make origami in your 
spare time.
You get the idea.
Begin with the answer to this question: What is your waste management bill 
every month? How many pounds of garbage do you send away? Now see if 
you can reduce both those numbers next month, and by how much. It’s a 
simple and powerful — and cost-saving — green effort. Nice. Let us know 
how you do.
The Good Housekeeping 
Green Seal of Approval
The Good Housekeeping Seal of Approval calls to mind an Ozzie-and-Harriet–
style perfectly run home (when was the last time your laundry looked that 
good?), but did you know it’s a real thing? Introduced in 1909 as a kind of 
consumer protection award, the Good Housekeeping Seal of Approval enabled 
consumers to know they were receiving quality products — soap, appliances, 
what-have-you — and that if they had problems with the items, the folks at 
Good Housekeeping would either replace the item or refund their investment 
in it. That’s a pretty big deal — and a nice safety net for consumers.
The good people at Good Housekeeping are now working on the criteria for a 
Good Housekeeping Green Seal of Approval, which will carry on the same com-
mitment to consumer education and protection while adding a few criteria. 
(See Figure 17-1.) Products qualifying for the green seal have to demonstrate all 
the qualities in the regular seal of approval, plus be made with earth-friendly 
materials, manufactured efficiently in a green way, and packaged and distrib-
uted with the earth in mind. Developers are still working on all the criteria, but 
it’s a great effort at cutting through the greenwashing — businesses’ attempts 
to grab some limelight and revenue by promoting green products and services 
that don’t deserve the label. Watch for the Good Housekeeping Green Seal 
of Approval for products you purchase in the future, and if you run a small 
business, find out how you can seek out a Good Housekeeping Green Seal of 
Approval for the products you offer.

Greening Your Business: 
What Can You Do?
As you begin to think about how you can make your small business greener, 
you may wonder what you really need to do. How much paper can you con-
serve? How many light bulbs can you change?
But these items are just the tip of the quickly melting iceberg. Scan the follow-
ing sections for green ideas for your new business or your already-thriving 
venture.
Greening your space
If you’re just starting out and setting up shop for the first time, consider 
these possibilities in your setup choices:
 
❑ Use CFL light bulbs everywhere.
 
❑ Insulate, insulate, insulate.
 
❑ Use natural blinds (earth-friendly — made of bamboo — of course).
 
❑ Use natural light wherever possible.
 
❑ Consider solar power.
 
❑ Use natural flooring (or earth-friendly carpeting).
 
❑ Add an air purifier and keep it circulating, baby.
 
❑ Find out whether you can purchase electricity from renewable sources.

325
 Chapter 17: Your Green Small Business 
If you’ve already got an existing business and want to start greening it up, 
think about these low-cost ways to change your environment today:
 
❑ Put out recycling bins and let your staff know where to find them (and 
what to put in them).
 
❑ Add plants to your office — especially in the reception area, meeting 
rooms, and the lunch room or kitchen.
 
❑ Have your air quality tested; clean ducts; check air flow.
 
❑ Add light sensors to offices and rooms you don’t use often — like confer-
ence rooms or meeting areas — so the lights turn off automatically when 
no one is in the room.
 
❑ Get an energy audit to help you find out how much energy your facility 
uses and where you can cut back.
 
Looking for green office supplies? Search no more! Here’s a list of vendors offer-
ing green cleaning and paper products for your office: Marcal (www.marcal
paper.com), Method (www.methodhome.com), Planet (www.planet
inc.com), Seventh Generation (www.seventhgeneration.com), and 
Simple Green (www.simplegreen.com).
Landscaping for water conservation
In this book, we talk a lot about virtual space 
because it offers a great way to reduce energy 
use, drive less, and get more done. But because 
the earth is, after all, the original green space 
(well, to allow for the possibility of other uni-
verses, let’s say “one of the original green 
spaces”), it’s important to think about ways to 
make the actual facility you do business in as 
green as possible. One way to do this is to think 
about the way in which your office is landscaped. 
Do the trees help shade in summer and provide 
a break from wind, ice, and snow in winter? This 
can have an impact on the amount of heating 
and cooling you use, which ties directly to your 
energy consumption — and impacts both your 
bill and CO2 emissions. Planting bushes, flowers, 
and vines that are right for your climate helps 
with air quality and the beauty factor (which is 
vital for happy, relaxed employees).
One area that is getting more play in green 
awareness lately is the water-conserving land-
scape technique of xeriscaping, which focuses 
on designing landscapes with drought-resistant 
plantings to conserve water. Xeriscaping can 
save you a significant amount on your water 
bill, beautify your space, and cut down on the 
time and expense of landscaping services. To 
discover the seven principals of xeriscaping 
and find a listing of drought-resistant plants,

Greening products and services
The materials that go into making and distributing your products come from 
somewhere — and go somewhere else. If you run a service business, you are 
using resources right and left, and using other peoples’ products to do it. 
Where do these things come from and where do they go? Thinking through 
this question and considering your place in the link is a good first step 
toward greening your products and services.
A new business has another leg up here because it’s easier to start green than 
it is to get greener in the middle of an established process. It’s never too late 
to change, though. Here are some ideas to consider as you think about bring-
ing the green to the items and ideals you offer clients and customers:
 
❑ Start at the beginning and think through the lifecycle of your product 
or service. How many supplies do you use? Where do they come from? 
Make a list.
 
❑ How many people does it take to make the product or offer the service 
you provide? Envision the product lifecycle and estimate the number of 
people involved in making it happen.
 
 After you finish this evaluation, consider sending a green thank-you note 
(on recycled paper, of course) to everyone involved in getting your 
product or service out there. Sharing a little gratitude makes every-
body’s day brighter.
 
❑ Begin thinking about ways to green the list of supplies and materials you 
use. If the materials are already green, think about how far they travel 
to get to you. You may buy great recycled paper from Washington state, 
but what are the CO2 emissions of the truck bringing it all the way to 
your office in New Hampshire?
 
❑ Consider whether all the folks touching your products need to be 
where they are to do it. Do you have employees who are driving long 
distances? Would it be a good green measure to give them the option of 
working at home a few days a week?
 
 See Chapter 13 for good reasons to work at home and ways to ensure 
the job is still getting done.
 
❑ Get a green audit for your product or service to determine the CO2
 emis-
sion required to produce or offer it. After you have that number, you 
have something to work with. How can you reduce your footprint? You 
might be able to
 
• Reduce energy consumption using IT power-saving features.
 
• Unplug unused equipment.

327
 Chapter 17: Your Green Small Business 
 
• Reduce the size of your office space.
 
• Reuse materials and equipment whenever possible.
 
• Recycle everything you can.
 
• Consider alternative methods of heating and cooling.
 
• Purchase carbon offsets until you can expand your green efforts. 
(For more about carbon offsets, see Chapter 2.)
 
Eco-Friendly Reusable Bags (www.ecobags.com) is an awesome bag shop 
with just about every conceivable bag you could ever want for anything. Not 
only will you feel good about what you’re offering, but your customers will 
take your green brand with them — free advertising! — everywhere they go.
Greening practices and people
One of the easiest and most fun aspects of greening a small business involves 
getting everybody on board. Sure, there may be naysayers — you know, the 
Eeyores (“If it is a good day . . . which I doubt,”) — but for the most part, 
coworkers feel good about doing the environmentally kind thing.
Greening your practices is pretty easy to do if you make it a priority. Our 
workplaces get so busy that it’s easy to push green initiatives to the bottom 
of the list, where they fall in the “someday when we have time” category. 
As we all know, that someday never comes unless you make it a priority. 
Incorporate green practices in your regular business routines, and it will 
become part of your culture. Here are a few ideas:
 
❑ Always use recycled paper to print unless the document is going to a 
client or customer.
 
❑ Always print double-sided unless the document type (a legal document, 
financial report, and so on) requires otherwise.
 
❑ Leave lights and computers (and other tech gear) unplugged unless they 
are in use.
 
❑ Institute work-at-home Fridays.
 
❑ Offer flex time so that staff can carpool and use public transportation to 
get to and from work.
 
❑ Make your green efforts visible with staff and celebrate benchmarks. 
(For example, “We reduced our paper purchase last month by 33 per-
cent! Go team!”)

328
Part IV: Telecommuting, Teleconferencing, and Teleporting 
 
❑ Help staff learn about and celebrate green efforts. As you find out about 
ways to green the workplace, you can share information with others 
to help them carry on the green effort at home. Add a green tip to your 
monthly newsletter; provide places for recycling, to make it easy; host a 
green lunch purchased with the amount of money you spent on energy-
saving features last month.
 
❑ Make a plan. Table 17-1 is an example of a table you can use to help you 
plan the types of green efforts you’d like to add to your business. Invite 
everyone at work to participate and bring their own ideas and suggestions.
 
❑ Create your own green policies. The Environmental Protection Agency 
offers a Web page of resources (www.epa.gov/ems/info/index.
htm) you can use to implement an environmental management system 
in your workplace. Whether you feel you need to be that elaborate, you 
can definitely get a team together to explore green efforts, write up work 
policies, and inspire others to get involved. Post your green policies in 
visible and logical places — by shared printers, in the kitchen, or close 
to the supply cabinet. Keep the message upbeat and focused on the 
positive change everyone is making by participating.

Some of the soft benefits of going green in your

appreciate the recycled bags, even if they have 
to pay five cents more to get them. Your employ-
ees are proud to be part of a business that cares. 
Your organization carries itself a little taller 
because it’s doing what it can. Mindsets begin 
to shift, bit by bit, and old patterns of disposability 
begin to dissolve. You’ll notice people begin to 
think differently and start to hear folks talk more 
seriously about what they are using and what 
they’re throwing away. When you hear the word 
sustainability pop up in a staff meeting, you’ll 
know your business has a greener culture than 
it did when you started. Congratulations!

Putting Green Business in Context
Making the effort to go green is a good thing. (You’ve heard that refrain 
plenty of times by now!) But if you’re a business owner, it’s also important to 
go green for the right reasons. Greenwashing is everywhere, and consumers 
are catching on. Slap a respectable-looking green label on your bag of toxic 
waste and people might think, “Yeah, that’s not such a great thing for the 
environment, but look — they’re doing what they can!”
 
Although the temptation to overstate your green factor might be tempting 
because it’s so hip right now (and we all need the business!), it’s better to take 
the high road and stick with the facts. Your energy audit, your thoughtful 
exploration of the product or service lifecycle, and your time spent with your 
staff, family, and friends to think through (and then put into practice) green 
ideas gives you real data and real stories to work with. Share with your cus-
tomers what you’re doing now — not what you hope to do someday. Let them 
know how your product or service really is green, and where you’re working 
to make it greener. And fight the temptation to turn green into a big PR event. 
Making green choices doesn’t make us super world citizens or earn us gold 
stars. It’s what we need to do to keep our planet inhabitable. That’s not hero-
ics — it’s just plain common sense.
Here are some tips on how to share your green initiatives — in an authentic 
and straightforward way — with your vendors, friends, and customers:
 
✓ Numbers tell the story. Make yours good. How many miles did your 
employees drive to work before you started your green efforts? How 
many are they driving now?
 
✓ Compare your business CO2 footprint this time last year with today’s 
number.
 
✓ Share the number of green vendors you work with — and include their 
names and Web addresses.
 
✓ Show up on green forums on public sites and talk about why your busi-
ness is going green (but mean it, even though it’s free marketing).
 
✓ Include a tag line like “Please consider the environment before printing 
this message” at the bottom of your e-mail signature.
 
✓ Give to earth-care initiatives or carbon offset programs and let them use 
your name and company Web address in their promotional materials.
 
✓ Think of ways you can help your customers and clients learn more 
about green efforts — and then take the step and make it happen.

 Chapter 17: Your Green Small Business 
Discovering Four Simple Green IT 
Techniques You Can Implement Today
As the owner of a small business, you may be ultra-concerned with costs. 
You’ve got to balance what may be limited resources against the gains they 
produce. You may have staff, payroll, manufacturing, and marketing costs. 
Equipment costs — and the bankroll to maintain that equipment — are prob-
ably not a small chunk of your budget.
Even though buying green (as in all new Energy Star–rated equipment) might 
make you swoon, there are other things you can do to start getting greener 
right away:
 
✓ Reduce what you consume. Throughout this book, you discover tech-
niques for educating yourself about how much energy you consume. 
With just a little refiguring, you can find the same numbers for your busi-
ness. After you have a handle on the amount of power you’re pulling and 
the CO2 that’s being generated as a result, you have what you need to 
plot a course of action. Ways you can reduce what you consume include 
these (and many others):
 
• Use power meters to find out where the power is going.
 
• Use smart power strips that turn off peripherals such as printers 
and scanners when they are not in use.
 
• Use power management on all your desktop and laptop computers.
 
• Use rechargeable batteries in mobile devices.
 
• Cut down on the use of paper, power, water, and gas.
 
• Meet virtually whenever possible to cut down on drive time.
 
• Let PDFs and other electronic files replace the hard copies you 
used to mail or take everywhere.
 
✓ Reuse what you can. Sure, it’s in the budget to buy new printers and 
PCs every two years, but do you really need to do that? Could a simple 
memory upgrade and larger hard drive do the trick? Run the numbers 
to see what the cost savings are in relation to the new purchase. If in the 
long run it’s a green thing (or just a smart thing) to go ahead and make 
the purchase, be sure to recycle your old systems responsibly.
 
✓ Recycle the rest. In Chapter 8, you learn how to prepare a system for 
recycling and discover who has recycling programs that keep CPUs and 
monitors out of hazardous waste piles. You can also recycle through 
continued use — donating your used computers to schools, nonprofit 
organizations, or friends in need of a new system.

332
Part IV: Telecommuting, Teleconferencing, and Teleporting 
 
✓ Commit to green IT. Making a real commitment to green IT means that 
you make a change in the way you approach technology in your busi-
ness — as a tool to get things done effectively and in an earth-friendly 
way. Committing to green IT will mean different things for different busi-
nesses, but in general, it might look like something like this:
 
• Keep your eyes open for new green resources. 
 
• Continue learning about green IT.
 
• When you replace equipment, buy green.
 
• Ask your vendors questions about their green commitment.
 
• Know what makes up the lifecycle of your product or service (and 
keep an eye on it).
 
• Commit to responsible recycling.
 
• Model your commitment by buying green, reducing use, and con-
serving what you can.
 
• Evaluate your technology needs and make a schedule for green 
purchasing points.
 
• Set up green policies and assessments so you know and can share 
how much energy (and investment) you’re saving.
 
ReDO (www.redo.org) is a nonprofit organization with a mission of “promot-
ing reuse as an environmentally sound, socially beneficial, and economical 
means for managing surplus and discarded materials.” Not sure how you can 
reuse or recycle items you produce or use and throw away? Check out their 
site for ideas you can implement in your industry.
Seriously green
As you learn more about greening your small 
business, you will find ideas that are no-brain-
ers (using CFL light bulbs, recycling, and buying 
green) and things that are, well, a little out there. 
Here’s an idea for the no-really-I-mean-it green 
business advocate: a swamp cooler.
Perhaps not much more attractive than it 
sounds, a swamp cooler is a replacement for 
your typical CO2-pumping air conditioner. The 
swamp cooler draws air into a chamber where 
it moves through pads soaked in water. The 
air then sucks up the water, which reduces 
its temperature (some say between 15 and 40 
degrees). This type of air cooler uses much less 
energy and doesn’t need one whiff of Freon. If 
you live and work in an area with relatively low 
humidity, this might be a possibility for you. 
Those of us in areas where the sweat drops off 
our laptops in July might need to wait for a dif-
ferent option.

333
 Chapter 17: Your Green Small Business 
Collaborating the Green Way
Collaboration is a key word in a new green workplace because duplication 
of effort requires more resources, more energy, more equipment . . . and 
besides, it’s just not efficient. If you can create efficient sustainability in your 
business, your dollars will go farther and the planet will smile. Sustainability 
means making great choices with an eye toward the big picture — buying 
earth-friendly products, reducing your packaging, recycling wherever pos-
sible — and efficiency means accomplishing your goals in a straightforward 
way that doesn’t waste a lot of time, steps, or money. Here are a few ideas for 
collaboration that can increase your green benefit:
 
✓ Share resources. One way to green your small business involves col-
laborating with others who offer complementary products or services. 
This might mean setting up shop in the same area — in the real world or 
virtually. It could mean sharing equipment, contractors, or even market-
ing lists. Collaborating can help you keep your expenses down and help 
reduce your consumption and make your purchases go farther, all at the 
same time.
 
 Of course, don’t overlook the obvious: sharing resources within your 
workplace! Printer sharing, fax sharing, share drives, and even office 
sharing can cut down on your power consumption and your square foot-
age, both of which reduce your carbon footprint.
 
✓ Combine efforts to cut green costs. Is your small business hosting an 
event for your chamber of commerce? Are you working on a fundraiser 
for a local charity? Are your staff members looking for a volunteer 
opportunity? Think creatively to partner with other businesses in your 
area, keep your costs down, and reduce what you consume and throw 
away in the process.
 
✓ Trade services, not incomes. Say that your small contracting business 
is going gangbusters — everybody needs what you offer right now. A 
real estate office in your area needs some repair work on its awnings — 
and they can help you by whipping up a business postcard to put in the 
Welcome Wagon packets for all their new homebuyers. Is the trade worth 
it? Absolutely. Brainstorm possible partners for collaborating on projects 
or events, and do a little legwork to find out who to talk to about it. You 
can use a list like the one shown in Table 17-2 to get started.
 
✓ Think virtual. The Internet makes it possible to trade services easily 
without a lot of overhead. A marketing person can trade services with 
a designer — one designs the logo; the other gets the word out. An eye 
doctor, podiatrist, and orthodontist can all share a receptionist, a wait-
ing room, and billing and marketing services.

Finding Five Online Green 
Business Resources
As the owner of a small business, you are probably up to your eyeballs in 
details — trying to ensure a quality product or service, doing your best to put 
sound practices in place, creating a business plan, setting up accounts receiv-
able and payable, managing data, buying materials, managing employees . . . 
the list goes on and on.
With so many choices to make and so many responsibilities, who has time 
to research every single vendor who makes a green claim? How do you know 
who is trustworthy and who isn’t? Especially if you’re going to pay a little 
more for green services, you need to feel confident that you’re getting a good 
deal that will ultimately provide your customers with quality and the earth 
with a little more breathing power.

Part IV: Telecommuting, Teleconferencing, and Teleporting 
This section introduces you to five different sites that can help you find green 
businesses that are more than just talk. Each site takes a different approach, 
but collectively, they help you weed out the green spin from the real deal.
Greenpreneur.net
Greenpreneur.net (http://greeenpreneur.net), shown in Figure 17-2, 
sports the tag line, “The Future of Business,” and on this site, you find a col-
lection of relevant green articles tied to items in the news and how-to articles 
with information that business owners want to know. (For example, “Do It 
Yourself Business Energy Audit” is one of the most popular links right now.) 
You can also get a look at the sponsors on the site, read the blog, and look 
things up in the knowledgebase.

how-to’s, a 
newsletter, 
blogs, and 
more for 
developing 
sustainabil-
ity in your 
business.
 
Green Maven
Type green business into Google and what do you find? No less than 220 
million results. That’s going to take a while to sift through! And when you 
narrow the list to something you can work with, how do you know that the 
businesses are really green? Green Maven (www.greenmaven.com) tries 

337
 Chapter 17: Your Green Small Business 
to take care of some of that work for you. (See Figure 17-3.) Green Maven, 
a green search engine, puts sites through an approval policy in which they 
“screen for green,” looking for the following:
 
✓ Included sites must state their green values clearly on their home pages.
 
✓ The site submitted must be a quality site, complete and suitable for all 
family members.
 
✓ Certifications and third-party validations improve a site’s chances of 
being approved but are not mandatory.

see all the resources available here. (See Figure 17-5.) The Small Business 
Environmental Home Page (www.smallbiz-enviroweb.org) offers all 
sorts of resources for small businesses who are concerned about compliance 
issues and creating an environmental management plan. You’ll find every-
thing from a how-to workbook to funding sources to state-by-state regula-
tions, deadlines, and contact personnel. The site also offers more than 500 
videos on best practices in environmental management for all sorts of indus-
tries. (How about “The ABCs of Integrated Pest Management” for starters?)

Part V
The Part of Tens

In this part . . .
A
h, everybody’s favorite — the Part of Tens! In this 
part of the book, you get a series of quick-look 
resources that help bring all your green efforts together. 
You take a look at what you can do in a quick and low-cost 
way to begin to make your computer more eco-friendly. 
Then you find out about big-picture resources for green 
knowledge — where you can go to find out what the scien-
tists say and what policymakers think. (If you’re wondering 
what that has to do with how you use your computer at 
home, we say “Everything!” Knowing what’s happening in 
green initiatives — and hearing it from reliable sources — 
helps you see how much of an impact your individual 
choices really make.) This part also offers a collection of 
green shopping sites because we just know you’re going 
to want to vote with your dollars when you can!

Chapter 18
Ten Best Ways to Make Your 
Computer Greener
In This Chapter
▶ Power off to save the planet
▶ Manage your power and know where it goes
▶ Devices to bank on
▶ A little more RAM, please
▶ Recycle happily
R
educe, reuse, recycle is a familiar refrain from green initiatives. This first 
chapter in the Part of Tens brings together a number of green tech-
niques to give you the quick scoop on things you can do — right away — to 
begin making a green difference in your home computing.
To select these items, we decided to focus on the here and now, the low cost, 
and the practical. So even though investing in solar energy and powering 
your computer with what you capture on your roof might be a great long-
term idea, you won’t find that suggestion in this list.
 
If you’re determined to go the solar power route (which we think is awesome), 
you might be interested in the Solio solar-powered charger found at The 
GreenTech Shop (http://thegreentechshop.com). This little charger is 
actually a hybrid, so it can store and convert energy from the sun or an AC 
outlet, but you can use it to power your mobile devices and go green.
Turn Stuff Off
Once upon a time in computerland, turning a system on and off repeat-
edly (meaning once or twice a day) took its toll on the hardware over time. 
Although technology has changed dramatically, becoming more flexible, 

344
Part V: The Part of Tens 
more capable, and more adaptable to normal wear and tear, that once-upon-
a-time story still lurks in the back of many people’s minds.
It’s time for a new story! Even if you have a system that is four or five years 
old, the computer you’re using isn’t going to wear out if you turn it off when 
you’re away from your desk for more than a couple of hours.
And this isn’t just for desktops and laptops. Turn off the monitor, the printer, 
the router, the Xbox, the Wii, every energy-gobbling thing (including the DVD 
player, the VHS player — good grief you still have one? — and anything that 
has a little flashing digital clock that never gets set properly). Even though by 
comparison the percentage of power your smaller devices draw is minimal 
compared to the energy they use in their active state, leaching 2 to 4 watts 
of wasted power continuously for weeks still adds up. If your device has an 
On light, has a self-charging mechanism, or shows any other signs of life, it is 
drawing some kind of power. Why waste it? Just let the thing charge up and 
then unplug it. It’s kinder to the planet.
 
Of course if your device is scheduled to do an automatic backup or system 
scan in the middle of the night, leave it on so it can complete its maintenance 
processes. Or change your schedule so the quick maintenance techniques 
occur first thing in the morning while you’re getting your coffee and saying 
good morning to your coworkers.
Manage the Power
No matter what kind of computer system you’re using, your operating system 
has some kind of system to help you manage the power you use. Chapter 9 
tells you all about this. Windows Vista, for example enables you to
 
✓ Choose or create a power management plan to suit different needs; see 
Figure 18-1
 
✓ Change the way your power buttons act
 
✓ Customize when your computer goes to sleep
Windows 7 takes a few more green steps by giving you additional power over 
your peripherals and helping you maximize your system resources by manag-
ing the power that’s running things inside that mysterious gray box.
You can use Energy Saver settings in Mac’s OS X to control when the system 
goes idle. (See Figure 18-2.) You will find the steps for using Mac power-
saving features in Chapter 9 as well.

Part V: The Part of Tens 
Let Your Computer Get Its Beauty Sleep
For those in-between work times, both Windows Vista and Windows 7 offer Sleep 
mode, which lets you easily and dramatically reduce the amount of energy your 
computer uses while remaining in a state of near-instant readiness.
 
Sleep mode is a great way to balance energy conservation with productivity 
because the system leaps back to life in only two seconds from a sound sleep.
What’s more, your programs and data files are preserved in memory when 
you use Sleep mode. This differs from the Windows XP Hibernate mode, 
which offers a sometimes less-than-reliable method of taking a breather while 
preserving data and reducing power use. Find out more about Sleep, Standby, 
Hibernate, and other rascally modes in — you guessed it — Chapter 9.
Use a Smart Strip
 
Here’s a simple way to reduce the energy your devices use right away: Get a 
smart strip. For a $25–$40 investment, you can get a surge protector that does 
more than just guard against an unexpected power spike. A smart strip includes 
special outlets that can sense when a peripheral is drawing power and when it’s 
dormant, and by responding to the activity of the computer and peripherals, it 
knows when to turn off the outlet. This stops any power leaching that’s going on 
when a peripheral is inactive. And that means you don’t have to remember to 
unplug the device — or plug it back in when you want to use it.
Keep an Eye on Your Power Use
Knowing how much power you use is one of the best ways to keep energy 
consumption on your radar screen. A number of low-cost devices make it 
easy for you to track how much power you’re using so you can figure out 
where you want to tighten your belt:
 
✓ A smart power meter is a device that plugs into your wall outlet; then 
you plug your computer into the meter. The meter tracks how much 
energy the computer is consuming and reports the number in kWh (kilo-
watt-hours). Most meters are reasonably priced and can provide several 
reports that help you see which appliances in your home are costing 
you the most so you can begin to manage your consumption. Chapter 3 
covers different types of smart meters.

347
 Chapter 18: Ten Best Ways to Make Your Computer Greener
 
✓ A plogg is a newer offering that combines a smart meter with the com-
munication capability to send the data on a device’s energy consump-
tion to you wherever you might be. For example, if you are at work and 
want to get a power update from home, a plogg can send you a wireless 
message showing your power use. With some versions of the device, 
you can log in to a Web site and get access to your home power con-
sumption data in real time. Ploggs for the home cost $95; you can find 
out more by going to www.plogginternational.com.
Look for the Energy Star
One of the easiest ways to make sure you’re buying in an eco-friendly way 
(when you buy) involves looking for the Energy Star logo, which is shown in 
Figure 18-3. The Energy Star program is a collaborative venture between the 
U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and the U.S. Department of Energy. 
Only products that meet a stringent set of energy-efficient standards can dis-
play the Energy Star on their labeling. See Chapter 3 for more about using 
the Energy Star site to rate your own equipment and think through green 
purchases.
The Energy Star offers a comprehensive site where you can research all kinds 
of equipment and appliances to see whether they qualify for the Energy Star 
symbol. If they don’t — steer clear!
 
Figure 18-3: 
Look for the 
Energy Star.
 
Boost Your RAM
Have you been looking for an excuse to increase your computer’s RAM? 
Here’s your green justification: More RAM helps speed your computer’s pro-
cessing power, which means less chunking to the hard disk and smoother 
processing all around.

348
Part V: The Part of Tens 
Find out how much RAM you already have by right-clicking Computer 
and choosing Properties. The System Properties dialog box opens, and 
the amount of RAM on your system appears at the bottom of the General 
tab. On a Mac, click the Apple menu and then click About This Macintosh; 
the number in the Total Memory line tells you the amount of RAM in your 
system.
When you know how much RAM you have, go to your computer manufac-
turer’s Web site to find out about the upgrade options for your particular 
computer model.
Adding a RAM module to your computer is a simple process. For the step-by-
step procedure, visit Chapter 5.
Increase Air Flow, Reduce Heat
What do you do on a spring day when the house feels stuffy? (Oh, you didn’t 
just say, “turn on the AC,” did you?) Open the windows! This gets the air 
moving, cools things down, and saves the energy that the fan would use 
schlogging all that stale air around.
Your computer will thank you for the same kind of treatment. Make sure that 
your computer is well aerated. Here are a few ways to do that. (Put away the 
garden spikes!)
For your desktop computer:
 
✓ Allow several inches of ventilation space between the system unit and 
the back of your computer cabinet.
 
✓ Clean the back of the fan and dust around the back of the computer 
regularly.
 
✓ Make sure cables are organized and out of the way of the air flow.
 
✓ If you don’t fear popping the lid on the system, check the cables inside 
the system unit to make sure they’re organized so air can circulate 
easily.
 
✓ And while you’re in there, blow any accumulated dust bunnies out of the 
inside of the computer. (Use the good old-fashioned birthday-candle-
extinguishing method, though; stay away from using canned air.)

349
 Chapter 18: Ten Best Ways to Make Your Computer Greener
For your laptop computer:
 
✓ Get your laptop up off your lap (or bed, or footstool).
 
✓ Use a laptop tray, such as the Futura laptop desk from Lapworks, with 
ventilation slots to reduce system heat by up to 20 percent.
 
✓ Make sure the AC cord and other cables don’t block the small fan outlet 
on the back or side of your laptop.
 
Check out the Futura laptop desk by going to Lapworks at www.laptopdesk.
net/laptop-desk-futura.html.
Share Your Resources
So how many computers did you say you have in the house? Three? And how 
many printers, scanners, game systems, and cellphones? Uh-huh. We thought so.
One of the kindest things you can do for the earth right away — besides turn-
ing off and unplugging all the devices you’re not using right now — is to share 
some of those resources.
With a small investment of time and effort in creating a home network, you 
can reduce the number of peripherals you use, cut down on your energy use, 
and share resources. Instead of purchasing and hooking up a printer for each 
computer system, for example, you can use one that all systems can access as 
needed. You can also share a single external drive, a DVD burner, a scanner — 
and even the same audio, video, and photo files by keeping your data in one 
central location. For ideas and how-to’s on setting up a home network, see 
Chapter 12.
 
For the play-by-play on designing, setting up, and managing a flourishing home 
network, see Woody’s Windows Home Server For Dummies. Other books with 
great networking info include two more by Woody: Windows Vista All-in-One 
Desk Reference For Dummies and Windows XP All-in-One Desk Reference for 
Dummies, 2nd Edition. And if wireless is your thing, take a look at Wireless 
Home Networking For Dummies, 3rd Edition, by Danny Briere, Walter Bruce, 
and Pat Hurley. Mac lovers should check out Macs All-in-One Desk Reference 
For Dummies, by Wallace Wang.

350
Part V: The Part of Tens 
Recycle Responsibly
The last item in reduce, reuse, recycle is an important step that many people — 
many people — still don’t know how to do. What should you do with that moni-
tor you don’t need anymore? What about the old laptop, your broken cellphone, 
or the digital camera that died two years ago?
 
Because toxic chemicals are still used in the manufacturing of computer plas-
tics, boards, and capacitors, just putting a system in a trash bag and setting it 
out by the curb is a dangerous thing to do to the planet. Not only does the 
toss-it-out-with-the-trash method run the risk of seriously polluting your local 
environment, but it has global ramifications as well. Currently, millions of 
computer parts are exported illegally every year, ending up in remote villages 
in developing countries, where they’re illegally burned for the metals, all the 
while releasing toxic chemicals into the air where children, families, and the 
whole environment is seriously threatened.
 
Most of the big computer manufacturers offer recycling programs so that you 
can easily return the computers and equipment you no longer need or use. 
Chapter 8 is all about what to do to prepare your computer for recycling, 
where to find a reputable recycler, and what you can expect to happen to your 
equipment after you donate it. Chapter 8 also explains other recycling options 
that help you reduce, reuse, and recycle.

providing solid green information on the latest environmental reports, utili-
ties to help you understand more about your own energy use, and sites to get 
you started on the way to advocacy.
Alliance to Save Energy
http://ase.org/section/_audience/consumers
The Alliance to Save Energy has been around a long, long time. Longer than 
most of the jeans in your closet, we’d bet. The Alliance started in 1977 as a 
bipartisan effort in Congress, even before the U.S. Department of Energy was 
signed into existence by President Carter later that same year.
Sites for social action

greeted with the current number of supporters 
participating in the virtual march. You’ll also find 
a collection of resources that suggest practical 
ways to reduce your CO2 contribution and to 
take action. It might mean writing to your mayor 
or watching a video clip, but you’ll find all kinds 
of outlets for your advocacy urge.
Care2.com: Care2.com is a green community 
and lifestyle site that has millions (yes, millions!) 
of members. With how-to features, a wide

you to invite your friends, share goals, and create groups with similar interests.
Here a Wikia Green, there a Wikia Green
http://green.wikia.com
Everywhere a wiki wiki. . . . (Just had to say it.) It might not be too far-fetched 
to say that just about everyone who has browsed the Web has heard of 
Wikipedia. Jimmy Wales, one of the cofounders of Wikipedia — the hugely suc-
cessful and mind-blowingly extensive (and sometimes not completely accurate 
because it’s written and edited by us humans) wiki — has launched a wiki com-
munity called Wikia with the sole purpose of supporting green efforts and edu-
cation. A wiki is a shared Web page or site that is open for all to contribute to 

356
Part V: The Part of Tens 
and edit using online text tools. Wikia Green launched in 2008 and is a quickly 
growing source of green concepts, theory, practical writings, tips, science, 
shopping sources, and much, much more. When you’re wondering how some-
thing is done, check out the special how-to section on the left.
Checking Out Online Buying Guides
When it comes to buying new stuff, what’s the green thing to do? The answer 
depends on a number of factors, including whether you can reuse or recycle 
what you have and whether the new item you’re considering is greener than 
the one you’re replacing. The Web offers guidance on what products and 
companies are making a true green effort. Before you buy, check out these 
online resources to help distinguish true green initiatives from greenwashing 
(which is green talk without the thoughtful action to back it up).
Treehugger’s Green Buying Guides
www.treehugger.com/buygreen
Treehugger is a popular blog reporting on all kinds of green and sustainable 
items. It features some great buying guides that can help you make green 
choices for computers and other electronics. Visit the site to review the 
buying guides as you’re considering your next home computing purchase.
Green Electronics Council
www.greenelectronicscouncil.org
The Green Electronics Council is a nonprofit organization that promotes, sup-
ports, and rewards companies that design, create, offer, and recycle earth-
friendly electronics products. GEC’s largest project is the EPEAT (Electronic 
Product Environment Assessment Tool) program, which helps consumers 
evaluate which tech products actually live up to their green promises. EPEAT 
uses a three-tiered system to let consumers know how well products demon-
strate the green characteristics they claim. Companies sign a factual-report-
ing agreement and submit their products for evaluation against 51 criteria (23 
mandatory and 28 optional). Products are awarded a bronze, silver, or gold 
rating, depending on the results of the evaluation. To find out more about the 
EPEAT rating system, visit www.epeat.net/Criteria.aspx.
 
To find out more about how you can use EPEAT as a consumer to find green 
electronics, go to www.epeat.net/Consumers.aspx.

merce model uses 35 percent less energy and reduces carbon emissions 
Looking beyond home computing
The focus of this book is bringing green ideas 
to your home computing. Several organiza-
tions are working to bring big green ideas to 
corporate and government initiatives. If the 
grand scheme of green piques your interest, 
the following sites are great places to start.
The Green Grid: www.thegreengrid.org
The Green Grid is all about advancing energy 
efficiency in businesses and data centers 
around the globe. (Data centers are large 
spaces housing servers; they process massive 
amounts of data and require similar amounts 
of power.) The Green Grid is a global con-
sortium that wants to create useful metrics 
to guide energy-efficient business practices, 
improve data center performance, and pro-
mote energy-efficient standards, processes, 
and technologies.
World Resources Institute: www.wri.org
World Resources Institute is a think tank 
that encourages the practical application of 
research findings in initiatives that benefit the 
earth and people worldwide.
Virtual Energy Forum: www.virtualenergy
forum.com
Virtual Energy Forum hosts — er, virtually — a 
huge, two-day, online-only event that encour-
ages and rewards companies for changing 
to energy-efficient and clean energy-based 
practices. Although held for a limited time 
(albeit regularly), this event is a great place 
to tune in to the top-level discussions going 
on in the areas of energy management and 
alternative energies. Check out the site and 
mark your calendar.
