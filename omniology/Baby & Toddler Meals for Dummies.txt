Introduction
A
s a parent, especially if you’re reading this book, you want to do what’s
right for your kids. From training and teaching to fun and laughter, you
want your home to be a safe haven and a place of health for your children.
When it comes to creating the optimal environment for your youngsters, food
is an inevitable part of the process. After all, you want your child to be healthy,
and good health stems from good nutrition. With that in mind, we wrote Baby &
Toddler Meals For Dummies just for you. After all, if you want to ensure the
most wholesome nutrition for your “little you,” so to speak, you need to know
how and what is best to feed your young one.
Perhaps you’ve strolled the supermarket aisles, looking at all the baby food
and toddler snacks, and you’ve wondered, “Is this stuff wholesome? Could I
make it myself? Could I do it better?” Those are important questions to ask,
and the answers are unequivocally, Yes! We tell you how in the pages that
follow.
When you choose to make your child’s meals on your own, you put yourself
in the driver’s seat of your child’s nutrition. Not only will these homemade
meals be nutritious for your child, but also you’ll find that the work and care
involved gives you a great sense of satisfaction in knowing that you’re doing
your best to bring your baby up healthy.
About This Book
We wrote this book so you can find the information you need quickly and
easily. We don’t ramble on about things that don’t matter, and you don’t have
to read the entire book if you don’t want to. In fact, you can read the book
from cover to cover or simply jump around to the topics you want to find out
more about at the moment. And best of all, we don’t expect you to remember
anything — we know you probably have a string on each finger to remind you
of doctor appointments, daycare schedules, sports schedules, and on and on,
so we organized this book in a logical, straightforward format so you can get
the information you need quickly and easily.
Conventions Used in This Book
Before you use the recipes in this book, here are a few guidelines that’ll help
ensure your success:

 Before you start cooking, make sure that you read through the entire
recipe. Doing so ensures that you have all the ingredients and cooking
tools before you begin.
 Pepper means ground black pepper unless otherwise specified.
 If a recipe calls for mayonnaise, don’t substitute salad dressing.
 All butter is unsalted.
 All eggs are large.
 All milk is whole.
 Flour is all-purpose unless otherwise specified.
 Sugar is granulated unless otherwise noted.
 All onions are yellow unless otherwise specified.
 All temperatures are Fahrenheit. (See the Metric Conversion Guide in
Appendix A at the end of the book for information about converting tem-
peratures to Celsius.)
In addition to the conventions we follow for the ingredients, we use a few
other conventions to point out helpful info:
 We use italics to point out new terms that we define as well as terms or
concepts that merit emphasis.
 We use boldface to highlight the keywords in a bulleted list or the action
parts of numbered steps.
 We use monofont to point out Web addresses that you may want to
check out for further information that we don’t dive into here.
T We use a tomato symbol like the one shown here to point out the vege-
tarian recipes. For the purposes of this book, we define vegetarian as
including no meat — that means no seafood, no chicken broth, nada.
(We don’t include this symbol for drinks and desserts, though; those
recipes are naturally okay for vegetarians.)
What You’re Not to Read
Sidebars contain extra information, so you don’t have to read ’em. However,
they often explain some technique or issue in more detail, and you may find
the information helpful.
We also won’t threaten treachery if you don’t read the text marked with a
Technical Stuff icon — although we put our hearts and souls into providing
2
Baby & Toddler Meals For Dummies 

every ounce of information you may want or need pertaining to this book’s
topic, some of the info just isn’t read-or-die. So skip over these paragraphs if
you want, but know that you may be missing some gold nuggets of additional
info if you do.
Foolish Assumptions
As we wrote this book, we made a few assumptions about you:
 We assume you know a thing or two about cooking, but we don’t assume
you’re a professional chef. In the pages of this book, you’ll find real-life
tips, suggestions, and recipes you can use right away, but we don’t dwell
on the basics of cooking.
 We assume you can get your hands on common, everyday items and
ingredients. If you want to cook a recipe in this book, you’ll be able to
find the ingredients at your local supermarket or health-food store; you
won’t need to buy ingredients from exotic places.
 We assume you want to cook for your child in a practical, down-to-earth
way and want to do your best. We think that’s great, and we’ve written
this book for you from that perspective.
 We assume that you need help pulling everything together. You may
know a thing or two about feeding babies and children and may need a
few recipes. But you also may need help understanding portion sizes
and nutritional balance, and you need practical recipes you can whip up
in a flash. Don’t worry; you’ve come to the right place.
 We assume you’re deeply concerned about being a good parent. You
care so much about your child’s well-being that you’re convinced that
cooking your tyke’s meals is the best step toward raising a healthy child.
 We assume you’re intelligent. After all, you bought this book!
How This Book Is Organized
Baby & Toddler Meals For Dummies is divided into seven parts, which we
describe in this section. Each part contains appropriate chapters that as a
whole cover everything you need to know about cooking baby and toddler
meals. With this design, you can find the information you need without
having to dig around.
3
Introduction

Part I: Lovin’ Spoonfuls: Feeding 
Your Baby and Toddler
In this part, you find some basic information about cooking for babies and
toddlers. If you want to cook for your child but you don’t really know where
to start or what tools you need, this is the perfect place to start. In Chapter 1,
we provide an overview of the many topics this book covers as well as a brief
quiz to assess your nutritional know-all. We also point you in directions tai-
lored to your needs. In Chapter 2, you find out what it means to raise a well-
fed child — we’re talking the whole shebang, from serving balanced meals to
setting appropriate mealtimes to recognizing the most important vitamins
and minerals for your child’s health. In Chapter 3, we cover kitchen basics,
including kitchen appliances you need, feeding and storage equipment to
have on hand, advice on how to stock your pantry, and instructions on how
to properly store and reheat food.
Part II: From Womb to Highchair: 
The First 12 Months
The first months of your baby’s life are critical in terms of nutrition. In this
part, we cut through the mystery of feeding babies and make things simple
and straightforward. In Chapter 4, start figuring out the mystery of the milk
diet, which your baby embraces during the first four months of life. In
Chapter 5, begin feeding solid foods and find out what to start with. In
Chapter 6, you explore foods for your crawler from ages 6 months to 1 year.
Part III: Big Changes Ahead: 
Feeding Your Toddler
Ah, the age of the toddler! A lot of things change around your house, and
your toddler’s eating needs and habits change, too. In Chapter 7, you find
recipes that work with the exploring 12-to-18-month age. Discover advice and
recipes in Chapter 8 that help you decide what to feed your growing tyke now
that she’s 18 months to 2 years old. Finally, in Chapter 9, you find toddler
meals and advice for children 2 to 3 years old.

Baby & Toddler Meals For Dummies 

Part IV: Welcoming Your Child 
to the Big People’s Table
So you’ve survived the days of infancy and early toddlerhood, and now it’s
time to pass along the important values of mealtime. As your child ages and
starts to grasp concepts, Chapter 10 helps you set routines for your kids and
gives you ideas for meals away from home. We think that Chapter 11 is a fun
chapter because you get to cook with your little one. In Chapter 12, we
supply several recipes that suit the entire family.
Part V: Fast Fixes for Mealtime Hurdles
No one likes to deal with food-related problems and challenges, but you’re
likely to run into some issues when you feed your kid. Relax — we have all
the advice and recipes you’ll need to jump these hurdles. In Chapter 13, you
uncover the common food-related challenges, such as allergies, food intoler-
ance, and reflux. In Chapter 14, you find out how to deal with your picky
eater. In Chapter 15, we talk about eating away from home and avoiding the
pitfalls of fast food.
Part VI: The Part of Tens
The Part of Tens is a helpful reference for choosing the homemade route,
saving time, and introducing new foods. In Chapter 16, we explore why home-
made meals are best. In Chapter 17, we try to help you save some time by
cutting corners in the kitchen. Finally, if you have some anxiety about serving
new food choices to your child, hit Chapter 18 for tips on how to introduce
new items into meals.
Part VII: Appendixes
In the appendixes of this book, we give you even more help and tips to be
successful in the kitchen and with home-cooked meals. Use Appendix A, the
Metric Conversion Guide, to understand common abbreviations for cooking
measurements and to figure out how to change the measurements in the
recipes to metric sizes. Appendix B provides you with a space to record your
child’s food intake. This can be important when trying to gauge food aller-
gies, intolerances, or even food variety in your child’s diet. And for the begin-
ner in you, if you want a whole week of meals already planned for you, check
out Appendix C to get started.

Introduction

Icons Used in This Book
We use icons throughout this book to call your attention to certain details
and pieces of information that you may find helpful, funny, or just plain inter-
esting. The icons, and the information that goes along with them, are also
designed to save you time and avoid common problems, so be sure to check
them out.
Paragraphs marked by this icon indicate extra information, advice, and tid-
bits to help make your cooking experiences easier or to provide you with an
alternate way to do something.
This icon is used to call your attention to extra morsels of important informa-
tion that you should store away in your noggin for further use.
This symbol alerts you to potential problems that you may experience in the
kitchen. We do use this icon sparingly, but when we do, take note. The warn-
ing icon provides information that helps keep you and your youngster from
harm’s way.
If you’re curious and have time to spare, check out the tidbits of info that this
icon flags. Although the information attached to these icons isn’t essential to
your success as a parent or as a cook, you may find these nuggets helpful and
interesting.
Where to Go from Here
It’s time to embark on the journey of preparing your little one’s meals. If you’ve
never cooked a meal for your infant and you’re just getting started, we recom-
mend that you begin at the beginning, of course, with Part I. If you can’t wait to
check out the recipes, flip ahead to Parts II, III, IV, and V (depending on your
child’s age). If you want to find info on a particular topic, be sure to use the
table of contents and index for extra help and direction. And if you just want 
to peruse the recipes before diving in, take a look at the “Recipes at a Glance”
section, which falls right before this introduction. No matter where you start,
you’re already well on your way to increasing your cooking repertoire and pro-
viding your baby or toddler (not to mention your entire family) with a healthy
lifestyle (or healthy food, anyway)!

T
he glorious day finally arrives. You’re a new parent, and when you look at
this new bundle of joy in your arms, you’re filled with a sense of wonder
and amazement — this new child is actually yours! You’ve spent months
preparing, anticipating, and studying to be the best parent possible.
Parenthood is an important journey, and you may be fretting over taking in
every glorious moment of your baby’s life. Don’t worry; many parents feel the
exact same way during the first few days of parenthood. You want to raise
your child in the right way to grow up to be healthy. And yet, what you quickly
find is that every day is a discovery — minute details reveal themselves every
second (or so it seems). Many answers aren’t found in a book or magazine.
One of those details is feeding — it’s one of the issues you need to address.
After all, you want the best for your baby, and as he grows, nutrition plays a
large part in his overall health. As a new parent, do everything you can to
give your child a healthy diet through the homemade meals laid out in this
book. Use this resource as the means to accomplish your goals.
The authors of this book are all parents — we’ve been and are in your shoes.
That’s why we’ve written this book. Find out the answers to how you feed
your infant through toddlerhood. What foods are best? Is homemade food
truly better? How can you control portions and keep a balanced diet?

Understanding the Importance 
of First Meals
All firsts for your baby seem important. First steps, first words, and of
course, that first smile. First meals are no different. They hold vital impor-
tance as your baby starts life outside of the womb and as her body grows.
First meals, as life fuel, support your baby’s mind, growth, and development.
The human body is highly complex and comes with complex nutritional
needs. Your baby’s first meals must support these complex needs as your
baby grows and develops.
But meals aren’t simply about nutrition. Mealtime provides a strong time of
bonding between Mom and Baby through breastfeeding, and between other
members of the family and the baby through bottle feeding. (See Chapter 4
for information on breastfeeding and formula feeding.) As your baby grows
and starts eating other foods, mealtime becomes a time of socialization and
training. Your child collects more verbal skills, manners, listening skills, and
general communication skills at the dinner table.
Why intuition isn’t enough
No matter what you may think you know, your basic intuition about food may
not be enough. Nutrition can be a complicated matter — children have differ-
ent nutritional needs than adults. The typical wisdom you have about food
may not be nutritionally sound, and although you may not spend much time
thinking about your own nutrition, you certainly need to consider your child’s.
If you really want to beef up your general nutrition knowledge, check with
your local hospital or community center for classes taught by registered
dieticians who can really help you get some fundamentals of nutrition under
your belt.
For starters, take into account some basic nutritional facts about babies and
children that every parent needs to know. Commit these morsels to memory
as you feed your tyke:
 Breast milk or formula is your baby’s first drink. Milk remains a vital
part of your child’s diet for several years, and children need the calcium,
along with the vitamins, minerals, and fat that milk provides.
Your child shouldn’t have cow’s milk until one year of age and should
only be given full-fat cow’s milk (read that: whole milk) or a cow’s milk
substitute (such as soy or goat’s milk) at that point. See Chapter 4 to dis-
cover more about milk.
10
Part I: Lovin’ Spoonfuls: Feeding Your Baby and Toddler 

 Foods need to be dense in calories, fat, and nutrition. Because children
don’t eat as much as adults, their foods need to be more focused. We’ll
give you plenty of pointers to accomplish this goal throughout the book.
 Babies don’t have the ability to digest high fiber foods. Although
higher fiber foods are healthy for older children and adults, your baby
needs less fiber. Also, most high fiber foods are low in calories, which is
the opposite of the previous bullet.
 Children need three square meals a day along with healthy snacks 
in-between. Of course, babies 4 months old or younger need to be fed
breast milk or formula on demand, but as your child begins eating solids
and nears age 1, she needs to eat every few hours, and every meal and
snack should be seen as a time to offer solid nutrition. Don’t worry; we’ll
help you along the way!
Your child also needs a wide variety of vitamins and minerals for healthy
growth that your instincts may not trigger. The following list highlights some
of the major players, but we tell you everything you need to know about
important vitamins and minerals in Chapter 2, including what foods you can
find them in.
We begin with the vitamin superstars:
 Vitamin A: Aids the immune system; helps form some hormones and
helps in cell reproduction; helps with the growth of bones, teeth, and
healthy skin, hair, and mucus membranes
 Vitamin B2 (also called riboflavin): Aids in general growth and red cell
production; helps with energy conversion from carbohydrates
 Vitamin B12: Helps the body’s metabolism; aids in the formation of red
blood cells; maintains the central nervous system
 Vitamin C: Acts as an antioxidant, which prevents the body from tissue
damage by free radicals (which can cause cardiovascular disease and
cancer); is an effective antiviral agent, meaning it helps your body defeat
viruses you come into contact with
 Vitamin E: Helps with antioxidants and the creation of red blood cells
Continuing on, the big wigs in the mineral category are as follows:
 Calcium: Builds strong bones and teeth; helps nerve function and blood
clotting when you’re wounded
 Iron: Essential part of hemoglobin, which delivers oxygen to the body’s
muscles through the blood cells. Iron is what gives blood its red color
and it’s necessary for energy production.
11
Chapter 1: Little Meals for Little Folks, from Applesauce to Zucchini

 Zinc: Promotes cell reproduction, tissue growth, and wound healing;
works with other body enzymes and helps the body use carbohydrates,
protein, and fat; an important mineral for general health
 Potassium: Regulates fluids and mineral balance; helps maintain blood
pressure
Why homemade foods are best
If you walk through your favorite grocery store, you’ll find plenty of manufac-
tured baby foods and products. You may look at the foods and prices and
think, “Are these products nutritious, and is the price worth it? Is this the
way to go? Is there a better method?”
Let us say this upfront: We aren’t anti-prepackaged baby food. Each of us, as
parents, has used it, and in many cases, prepackaged baby food provides a
quick solution. If you must use prepackaged foods, the iron-fortified cereals
and basic purees are all good choices. Yet, as a general rule, homemade food
is simply better for the following reasons:
 Freshness: When you make your baby’s food, you can use the freshest
ingredients and prepare the food in a way that harbors the vitamins and
minerals. Fresh is best.
 Control: With homemade foods, you’re in complete control of what your
baby eats and you have more flexibility with options.
 Preservatives: Well, the lack of preservatives to be exact. Home-cooked
food avoids preservatives. Most store-bought baby foods are careful to
eliminate excess preservatives and salt. Yet, homemade meals are
always going to be preservative free if you use fresh ingredients.
 Cost: For $3, you can buy a whole squash or a package of green beans
that feeds your baby for a week or more. To the contrary, you can feed
your baby the prepackaged stuff for only two days with the same
amount of dough! The reason for the price difference is that when you
make your own food, you avoid all the materials and marketing costs
that heighten the cost of store-bought food. Pocket your money and use
it in other ways for your family, such as paying a sitter so you can have a
night out with your partner!
 Bonding: You’ll feel better about your role as a parent when you prepare
food yourself. And the love that goes into your meals creates closeness
to your child. That spoonful of love doesn’t come prepackaged.
Need more convincing? See Chapter 16 where you’ll find ten quick reasons
why homemade baby food is best.
12
Part I: Lovin’ Spoonfuls: Feeding Your Baby and Toddler 

What mealtime teaches your child
Mealtime is about more than food; it enhances moments of bonding and shar-
ing, especially as your baby turns into a toddler and begins interacting with
the world around him. We assert that mealtime is one of the most important
family times of the day. In fact, family mealtime is important enough that
we’ve devoted an entire chapter to family meals; see Chapter 12 for an enlight-
ening discussion and some hard-to-beat recipes (if we do say so ourselves).
So what can be learned from? Valuable lessons can be reinforced each day
during meals, but here are a few of the most important:
 Togetherness: Family meals can be a great way for all members of the
family to share their time and day together. These family bonding
moments become a normal part of the routine and a healthy part of 
your family’s.
 Dexterity: As your child begins to use a spoon and fork, she begins to
manipulate and use tools and items.
 Manners: Use this time to teach “please” and “thank you” and phrasing
for passing dinner dishes. Also use other table manners like excusing
yourself from the table when finished. Many of these manners are taught
by example. Make sure to explain table manners to your children for any
social setting as well.
 Balanced diet: If you eat healthy meals together, your child begins
understanding the importance of proper health and food from a young
age. Your child witnesses his family eating in a healthy way, and he
begins to understand which foods are healthy and which are occasional
treats. What better place to gather these life skills than in your kitchen?!
 Conversation: As you watch your child grow and his language skills
develop, you’ll find that the family table is a great place to practice and
reinforce conversation skills. Eating and visiting at the same time is an
age-old practice, but make sure to pass on the tricks of the trade to your
little ones. Such skills like not interrupting when others are talking and
not screaming to get what you want can be emphasized at the dinner
table. Your child also discovers new words about foods, utensils, and
other objects in the kitchen. Mealtime is a powerful learning tool, so
keep the conversation positive and upbeat!
Weaning Baby and Introducing 
New Foods
Breast milk is a starter food, but your baby can’t drink it as his only source of
nutrition forever! In fact, by the time your baby reaches 4 months old, he’ll be
13
Chapter 1: Little Meals for Little Folks, from Applesauce to Zucchini

almost ready for real food, but you have to start out simply — with a small
amount of cereal — and transition gradually. And although your infant will
eat different foods before his first birthday, breast milk remains an important
part of his diet until at least that point.
Because your child isn’t born eating a smorgasbord of food, you’ll need to
introduce new foods as he grows. Naturally, certain foods are better at cer-
tain ages than others, and you can find out more about what foods to intro-
duce at what ages in the various age-related chapters in this book. To whet
your appetite for all you’ll discover in this book, though, the following list
gives you a brief global look at feeding your child:
 0–4 Months: Feed breast milk or formula only, fed on demand.
 4–6 Months: Add small amounts of rice, oat, or barley cereal. If you
begin serving cereal at 4 months, you may begin serving pureed veggies
at 5 months and pureed fruits at 6 months.
 6–8 Months: Add pureed fruits and veggies, such as bananas, pears,
applesauce, peaches, avocado, cooked carrots, squash, and sweet 
potatoes.
 8–10 Months: Continue with previous foods, and add
• Small amounts of soft pasteurized cheese, yogurt, cottage cheese
(but no cow’s milk until age 1)
• Cereals (wheat and mixed cereals)
• Mashed (versus pureed) fruits and vegetables (such as bananas,
peaches, pears, avocados, cooked carrots, squash, potatoes, sweet
potatoes)
• Finger foods (such as lightly toasted bagels, cut up; small pieces of
ripe banana; well-cooked spiral pasta; teething crackers; low-sugar
O-shaped cereal)
• Small amounts of protein (such as pureed meats and poultry; tofu;
well-cooked and mashed beans like lentils with soft skins, split
peas, pintos, black beans)
• Noncitrus juice (apple or pear)
 10–12 Months: At this stage, add
• Fruit cut into cubes or strips, or mashed
• Bite-size, soft-cooked vegetables (peas, carrots)
• Combo foods (macaroni and cheese, casseroles)
 12–18 Months: Switch to whole milk. You can feed everything you’ve
been feeding, but you can now feed these foods as well:
• Honey
• Any other dairy products
14
Part I: Lovin’ Spoonfuls: Feeding Your Baby and Toddler 

• Same food as family, mashed or chopped into bite-size pieces
• Other grains (whole-wheat bread, pasta, rice)
• New fruits: melon, papaya, apricot, grapefruit (citrus is now okay)
• New vegetables: broccoli and cauliflower — essentially any veggie
is okay now
• Protein (eggs; cut-up or ground meat, poultry, boneless fish)
 18–24 months: Everything you’ve been feeding plus
• Other grains (whole-wheat crackers, pretzels, rice cakes, ready-to-
eat cereals)
• Fruit (cooked, canned or fresh, cut up or sliced, or even dried)
• Fruit and vegetable juices
 24 months and on: Everything you’ve been feeding. At this stage, you
can continue to introduce new foods as desired, including nuts and
peanut butter. Be careful of choking hazards — make sure that items are
cut in small bites and carefully continue to supervise mealtimes.
It can take ten or more attempts before children feel comfortable eating an
unfamiliar food. So, don’t give up or get discouraged.
Leaving the nipple and grabbing a spoon
As your child nears age 1, you may want to begin weaning him from formula
and move him to cow’s milk. Breastfed babies are typically breastfed a bit
longer, depending on what works best for Baby and Mom. Remember, though,
that you should only give your tot whole cow’s milk or a cow’s milk substi-
tute until he’s 3 or so. At that point, you can cut some of the fat and move to
2 percent milk.

Chapter 1: Little Meals for Little Folks, from Applesauce to Zucchini
Honey is for bumblebees, not babies
Perhaps you’ve heard that you never give honey
to an infant, and indeed, if you look on honey
containers at the supermarket, the labels tell
you the same. Why? Honey may contain bacte-
rial spores that produce the bacterium,
Clostridium botulinum. This bacterium creates a
toxin that can give your baby botulism, which
makes your child sick and, in rare cases, affects
the central nervous system, resulting in death.
Honey is safe for older children and adults, but
babies haven’t yet developed the bacteria in
their digestive tracts that can control the spores
and prevent the production of the toxins. So,
never give honey to a child under age 1 for any
reason.

The transition from milk to solids is an exciting time for both the baby and
the parent, but the progression is slow as molasses. Typically, the transition
from milk to simple solids and then to more complex solids takes months,
even years, to develop fully.
Your baby’s first solid food should be rice cereal, typically during 4 to 6
months of age. Make the cereal watery, and your baby will eat only a few
bites at a time. You can then slowly mix in other watery cereals, such as
barley and oatmeal. In fact, you can make these cereals from scratch with
little fuss, and we show you how in Chapter 5.
As your baby’s appetite grows, you’ll begin introducing pureed and watery
veggies. We recommend yellow veggies, such as corn, potatoes, sweet pota-
toes, and the like. These veggies are bland and easy to digest but still pack
that nutritious punch.
As your baby continues to grow, you’ll also introduce basic and bland fruits,
such as apple, pear, and banana. Find out more about feeding your 4- to 6-
month-old in Chapter 5.
Moving from bland to beautiful, from
purees to well-crafted dishes
As your child moves past the 6-month stage, you’ll continue to see more
changes in her eating needs and habits. Her digestive system gets stronger,
and as she gets teeth, her food options expand greatly. You’ll begin mixing in
other veggies, fruits, and then meats, with progressively chunkier textures as
Baby gets older, and on to combination meals that’ll start to look more and
more like real food instead of mush!
To help you navigate the changing needs of your child, you’ll find a chapter
addressing each age range with advice, tips, pitfalls, and of course, practical
recipes to put to work in your kitchen (see Chapters 6 through 10).
Observing basic rules when 
feeding your tyke
So you have this hungry child and you need to feed him. What are the rules?
What should you watch out for? What are the common difficulties?
Relax! Feeding your child takes a mix of common sense and some specific
rules. We expand on the following topics throughout the book, but to get
started, keep these issues in mind:
16
Part I: Lovin’ Spoonfuls: Feeding Your Baby and Toddler 

 Your child’s eating needs aren’t like yours. You may worry about things
like calories and fat and try to eat foods with lower calorie and fat con-
tents. Your baby’s needs are the complete opposite. Because your young-
ster eats lower volume, she needs food that has
• Dense calories and good fat
• Low sugar
• High vitamins and minerals
• Low fiber (especially for children under 1)
You don’t need to know countless rules, but remember that your child
needs a dense calorie, higher fat diet for proper growth and brain develop-
ment. Children aren’t little adults, so don’t get in the habit of thinking that
way. Check out Chapter 2 to find out more about childhood nutrition.
 Texture, appearance, and taste are more important than you may
think. Just because your child is young doesn’t mean that his senses
don’t come into play when he eats. In fact, he’s attracted to food by both
sight and smell, just like you. In addition, texture is important for safety
reasons — babies can choke easily, so you need to make sure that you’re
serving food at the right consistency at the right age. Naturally, we’ve
provided you with a lot of information and a bunch of recipes. Check out
Chapters 5 through 10.
 Start with bite-size portions. Offering your child just a teaspoon or so of
a new food makes it feel less intimidating.
 Team up favorite tastes with new ones. Pick a food that your child likes
and alternate bites between the new food and the favorite food.
 Not all foods are created equal. Some foods simply have more nutrition
than others, and you should have an understanding of what foods pro-
vide a stronger source of nutrition. Don’t worry; head to Chapter 2.
 Not all foods should be given to children. Some foods commonly pro-
voke allergies in children, and some foods are simply dangerous. For
example, honey contains botulism spores and should never be given to a
child under the age of 1. Peanuts are a common allergen and shouldn’t
be given to children (including peanut butter) until after the age of 2.
Shellfish is a common allergen for many people as well. Avoid it until
your child is several years old. You can find out more about these issues
in Chapter 13.
 Be careful with juice. Juice is a wholesome drink for your child, but
make sure that you give only pure fruit juice that contains no added
sugar (look for “100 percent juice” on the label). We recommend apple
juice as a first juice because it’s easy to digest. As a starter, it’s best to
dilute juice 50 percent with drinking water (tap water is fine). Too much
juice can cause diarrhea until your child ages a bit and can handle its
intensity.
17
Chapter 1: Little Meals for Little Folks, from Applesauce to Zucchini

 Beware of choking hazards. As your baby ages and becomes a more
independent eater, he needs to be very careful of items that pose poten-
tial choking hazards. These items include whole grapes, hard candy,
popcorn, hotdogs, peanut butter, and any larger items. Think small bites!
 Water is a building block of life, but your baby gets all the water he
needs from milk. If you formula feed, the formula is mixed with water
(regular tap water) as your child grows. After the age of 1, you can offer
more water as a drink, but make sure that you continue feeding milk and
juice. See Chapter 4 to find out more about milk.
 Use common sense. Use this book as a guide for when to serve what
foods and how much, but be wary of well-meaning relatives and friends
who’re flippant about what your child can and should eat.
Facing and Hurdling Obstacles
In a perfect world, you’d never have any problems. Of course, none of us get
to live in that world, and you may experience several common problems when
feeding your baby. If you’re armed with the right information (which this book
provides), you can pinpoint a problem and handle it successfully. The follow-
ing sections give you a quick introduction to the most common problems.
When Ricky is really picky
Fact #1: The majority of children go through some kind of picky eating phase.
Fact #2: This phase will make you want to run screaming down the street.
Some children seem to be born as picky eaters. Others seem to eat well and
then suddenly go through a stage where they’ll barely eat anything or eat the
same food over and over. This spell can last a few months or even a few years.
Utilize these practical tactics to combat your picky eater, and in fact, you can
find more tips and special recipes to help in Chapter 14. Here are a few quick
tips to tuck in your hat:
 Relax. Realize that picky-eater syndrome is normal and more children
than not go through some variation of this behavior. Although aggravat-
ing, realize that the behavior is normal, take a deep breath, or maybe
two, and relax.
 Vary it. Don’t give in to demands for the same foods over and over. Keep
exposing him to new foods and don’t let him dictate what he’ll eat. Don’t
worry; your child won’t starve.
18
Part I: Lovin’ Spoonfuls: Feeding Your Baby and Toddler 

 Watch out for visual appeal. Children are typically only interested in
eating pleasant-looking food. Try to make food more visually appealing
and stimulating.
 Use a base. If your child loves cheese, serve dishes that mix other items,
such as veggies into the cheese.
 Get your children involved in the kitchen. Use cooking time as discov-
ery time. Teach your little ones about different foods and let them help
you prepare some items. This is a great way to break down the pickiness
barrier because kids are more likely to try something they’ve helped
create. Check out Chapter 11 for some recipes that just may get you
started cooking together and increase your child’s knowledge of foods
and interest in eating them.
If Grace is intolerant (or allergic)
Children have immature body systems, including their digestive and immune
systems. It isn’t uncommon for kids to end up with some sort of food allergy
or intolerance, but most children outgrow these issues with time. Food intol-
erance affects the digestive system, while an allergy affects the immune
system. Intolerances are more common than allergies.
A food intolerance or allergy reveals itself with a few telltale symptoms:
 Allergy symptoms:
• General irritability
• Problems breathing
• Rashes, especially around the face or neck
• Sneezing, wheezing, and a runny nose
 Intolerance symptoms:
• Bloating
• Digestive problems
• General irritability
• Vomiting
You’ll notice these symptoms typically within 30 minutes of eating the offend-
ing foods if the food is intolerance. In the case of an allergy, the symptoms
may appear within a few minutes, but can take several hours to appear.
In most cases, food intolerance or allergies are annoyances (for both you and
your child), and you simply need to avoid feeding those foods to your kid or
adjust serving size in cases of intolerance. Some foods, however, such as
peanuts and shellfish, can lead to a swelling of the throat, preventing proper
19
Chapter 1: Little Meals for Little Folks, from Applesauce to Zucchini

breathing and anaphylactic shock. Anaphylactic shock is a life-threatening
reaction characterized by a swelling of the throat tissue and lowered blood
pressure. So, it’s important not to take intolerance or allergic problems
lightly. Naturally, a pediatrician can be an invaluable resource if your child’s
having these problems, and also check out Chapter 13 for more information
on the most common allergies and intolerances as well as a handful of
recipes that steer kids clear of trigger foods.
If Charlie is on the chubby side
In most cases, children won’t end up chubby. The main contributing factors
to overweight children are the consumption of highly processed, high-fat
foods (instead of a well-balanced diet), and the lack of physical activity. In
rare cases, medical conditions cause a child to be chubby, and you should
work with your pediatrician, but in most cases, it’s simply an issue of eating
poorly and living lazily.
It’s important to note that all babies and young children look chubby — this
is a normal part of your baby’s development. But as your child grows to
around age 2, you’ll notice that she loses this baby fat and starts to thin out.
If you feel that your child eats too much and is gaining weight, check with
your pediatrician who may have some specific suggestions for the situation.
Also, check out Chapter 2, where we discuss in detail the basics of proper
nutrition. Armed with the right information, you can make changes to your
child’s diet and activity level that’ll likely take care of the chubby problem.
When Father Time gives you a squeeze
You have all the time in the world and are never in a rush. Yeah, right! When
you find that world, please let us know, so we can join you.
In many cases, parents want to cook meals for their children, but they rely
on prepackaged foods in a fix. We understand, because our lives are hectic,
too. With two parents working full time, raising two kids isn’t easy! However,
with a few tricks up your sleeve, you can keep your nutrition goals even when
time isn’t on your side. (For more great tips, flip to Chapter 17, near the end
of the book.)
 Get organized. Get a calendar and try to plan out your week’s meals in
advance. This way, you’ll know what needs to be cooked and when, and
you’ll avoid a lot of confusion.
 Cook several meals at once. Try cooking a couple of different recipes at
the same time and storing the portions in the freezer. When you don’t
20
Part I: Lovin’ Spoonfuls: Feeding Your Baby and Toddler 

have time to cook later, pull out your freezer portions for a quick, healthy
meal. Throughout this book, we note the recipes that’ll freeze well.
 Prepare snacks for the road. Eating out is a major culprit of poor nutri-
tion, but you can survive this problem by taking healthy food along. It’s
not as hard as you may think, and in Chapter 15, you’ll find plenty of on-
the-go recipes to get you started.

 Implementing a well-rounded diet for vegetarians
 Being prepared for wacky eating habits
R
aising a well-fed child may bewilder you. You probably receive conflict-
ing advice from family and friends every day, and deciphering who’s
right and who’s wrong can be hard. And even the Internet, masking as your
all-knowing best friend, may steer you along a bumpy path. So you’re still left
with looming questions: What foods should my child eat and how much of
which food group? Don’t worry; we’re here to help!
Raising a well-fed child isn’t as complicated as it may seem. Armed with the
right information, you can ensure proper nutrition for your baby without
becoming a worry-wart or stressing yourself out. In this chapter, the mystery
of raising a well-fed child is crushed. You discover some tips and skills to put
to work right away as you plan meals and feed your child.
Exploring the USDA Food Pyramid
You’re probably at least vaguely familiar with the USDA Food Guide Pyramid.
The Food Guide Pyramid has served as a standard of good nutrition for years.
However, with recent updates and revisions, the name of the pyramid has
become “MyPyramid.” The new pyramid encompasses nutrition and exercise
and encourages
 Making smart choices from every food group
 Finding a balance between food and physical activity
 Getting the most nutrition out of your calories

Now, you may not realize that the USDA has also developed a food pyramid
just for children, now known as “MyPyramid for Kids.” (Check out www.my
pyramid.gov, too.)
Because their bodies develop and grow at such a rapid rate, children have
diverse nutritional requirements. These needs aren’t radically different from
older children or even adults, but the food pyramid you’re used to seeing is
modified slightly for youngsters, meaning that you don’t have to overhaul
your understanding of good nutrition completely.
To build a foundation for your nutritional knowledge, take a look at
MyPyramid for Kids in Figure 2-1. (Access a downloadable, printable version
of this food pyramid at www.teamnutrition.usda.gov.)

28
Part I: Lovin’ Spoonfuls: Feeding Your Baby and Toddler 

The first concept to understand the latest food pyramid is that it isn’t age
specific. Rather, it’s meant to serve as a general guide. Follow MyPyramid for
Kids for children ages 2 through 8. Children younger than 2 still generally
follow the pyramid, but they need more servings of milk and dairy products
than the pyramid recommends. Also, MyPyramid for Kids proposes lowfat
milk products for kids ages 2 to 8, but keep in mind that children from 1 to 
2 years old still need full-fat milk. To find out more about your child’s milk
needs, be sure to check out the age-specific chapters in Parts II through IV.
When looking at Figure 2-1, notice that MyPyramid for Kids divides into five
food groups with a different amount for the daily need for each category. The
pyramid simply gives you a graphical representation of the importance of
each food group in your child’s diet. For children ages 2 to 8, the USDA rec-
ommends the following general daily needs of each food group:
 Grains: 6 ounces per day. At least half of this suggested portion should
be whole grains, and in truth, consider serving mostly whole grains —
they’re simply more nutritious.
 Vegetables: 21⁄2 cups a day. Strive for a mixture of veggies to get the proper
balance of vitamins and minerals. Naturally, your child may eat a bit less
or more based on her age.
 Fruit: 11⁄2 cups per day. Again, strive for a mixture of different kinds of
fruits.
 Milk: 2 cups per day. You can substitute other milk products, such as
cheese and yogurt, which count for milk servings.
 Meat and beans: 5 ounces per day. Strive for lean beef, chicken, and fish
prepared by baking, broiling, or grilling. Fried meats are usually more
delicious, but they aren’t as healthy due to the fat content, so limit fried
food.
Tailoring serving sizes to age
Because the USDA’s MyPyramid for Kids is for a big age range (see the preced-
ing section), the daily recommendations vary among that group. The USDA
provides a Web site where you can enter your child’s age, gender, and activity
level and get instant feedback on what foods and how much of each food group
to serve your kid (go to www.mypyramid.gov). To guide you in the right direc-
tion, in each age-related chapter, we tell you how much food a child in that age
range, with a moderate activity level, needs from each food group.
As if the daily recommendation issue isn’t confusing enough, the food pyra-
mid differs a bit for males and females. Here are some examples:
29
Chapter 2: Raising a Well-Fed Child

 At age 3, male children require a bit more food in some categories 
than females. However, this advice is flexible, so don’t worry about the
distinction.
 The food pyramid recommends 3 ounces of grains for girls and 5 ounces
for boys. However, we suggest between 3 and 5 ounces for either sex,
depending on your child’s size, eating needs, and activity level (and to
cover our tails with the USDA).
Breaking down the pyramid: 
The five food groups
As you look at the five basic food categories, you wonder what foods belong
in each group and what foods should be staple foods in your child’s diet.
That’s a good question, and we have the answers for you in the following 
sections.
Grains
When you think of grains, you probably think of bread first. Rightly so. Bread
is a major food in this group. As you feed your child grains, make sure that
you feed more whole grains than other processed grains. Whole grains are
healthier.
Keep these foods in the grain group in mind:
 Barley
 Brown rice
 Oat flour (substitute for all-purpose white flour)
 Oatmeal
 Whole-wheat bread
 Whole-wheat pasta
 Wild rice
Vegetables
The vegetable category naturally includes all vegetables. However, all vegeta-
bles aren’t created equal. As such, keep the following suggestions in mind
when you feed vegetables to your child:
 Feed more potassium-rich foods. Include beets, kidney beans, lentils,
soybeans, spinach, split peas, sweet potatoes, tomatoes, white beans,
white potatoes, and winter squash.
30
Part I: Lovin’ Spoonfuls: Feeding Your Baby and Toddler 

 Strive for 11⁄2 cups of dark green veggies a week. Try out broccoli, 
collard greens, kale, mustard greens, romaine lettuce, spinach, turnip
greens, and watercress.
Vegetables that are darker in color are more nutrient rich than those
that aren’t. So, keep the veggies dark to supply your tot with plenty of
nutrition!
 Plan for 1 cup of orange veggies a week. Alternate among acorn squash,
butternut squash, carrots, hubbard squash, pumpkin, and sweet potatoes.
 Serve 1 cup of dry beans and peas per week. Include black beans,
black-eyed peas, garbanzo beans, kidney beans, lentils, lima beans, navy
beans, pinto beans, soybeans, split peas, tofu, and white beans.
 Feed 21⁄2 cups of starchy veggies per week. Serve corn, green peas, lima
beans, and potatoes.
 Dish up 41⁄2 cups of other veggies per week. Take your pick from arti-
chokes, asparagus, bean sprouts, Brussels sprouts, cabbage, cauliflower,
celery, cucumbers, eggplant, green or red bell peppers, iceberg lettuce,
mushrooms, okra, onions, parsnips, tomato juice, pure vegetable juice,
turnips, wax beans, and zucchini.
Fruit
Fruit, aside from being sweet and delicious, provides a lot of nutrition for
your child. Serving a variety of fruits exposes your child to different kinds 
of fruits, and hopefully she ends up eating a variety. Feed more fruits with
higher potassium levels, such as apricots, bananas, cantaloupe, honeydew
melon, peaches, prunes, and oranges. Potassium helps regulate blood pres-
sure, which pumps the blood to your muscles, thus keeping the muscles in
working order.
Watch out for imitation fruit juices or fruit snacks. These products often have
little actual fruit and contain more sugar. When you serve fruit juices, insist
on juices that are made with 100 percent real fruit with no sugar added.
Milk
The milk category includes whole milk, cheese, and yogurt. Your child can
fulfill her milk intake for the day not only by drinking milk but also by eating
cheese and yogurt. American or cheddar cheeses are always good options for
kids because of their mild flavors. Many recipes in this book call for yogurt
because it’s healthier and helps bump up your child’s calcium intake.
Children ages 1 to 2 need full-fat milk. See the age-specific chapters in Parts II
and III to find out more about milk.
31
Chapter 2: Raising a Well-Fed Child

Meat and beans
This category includes meat and beans as well as nuts. Nuts are listed in the
meat and beans category because of their higher protein and natural fat
levels.
Keep the following tips in mind as you feed these products:
 Serve fish instead. Replace a serving or two of protein each week with
fish. Salmon and trout are good choices because they contain healthy
fatty acids.
 Choose lean beef. Remember to trim all meats of visible fats.
 Grill, bake, or broil beef and chicken. Avoid fried meats.
 Choose beans or peas as a side dish. You can also make main dishes
with beans and lentils.
 Add nuts into meals. Almonds, pecans, cashews, and walnuts are all our
favorite choices. However, your child shouldn’t eat nuts, including
peanuts or peanut butter, until after 2 years of age due to common
allergy problems. (See Chapter 13 for more on childhood allergies.)
Providing a Good Foundation
As you’re thinking about feeding your child, it’s important to understand 
that your child’s brain needs a lot of power — just like yours. Interestingly
enough, the brain only takes up about 4 percent of your body weight, but it
burns 20 percent of your body’s energy, even when you’re at rest. Also, the
brain doesn’t store glucose well, so you need to “feed” your child’s brain (and
yours) regularly so it functions at its best.
In the mornings, your body’s glucose is at an all-time low because you haven’t
eaten anything all night. You’ve heard that breakfast is the most important

The fat about oils
Oils are a natural part of any diet, and they’re
necessary for good health because of the fatty
acids they contain. As a general rule, each day
your child needs about four teaspoons of oil —
choose from canola, corn, cottonseed, olive,
safflower, soybean, and sunflower. All of these
oils are unsaturated and derive from plants.
Some foods are naturally high in oil, such as
nuts, olives, fish, and avocados. You don’t have
to be concerned about measuring oils in your
child’s daily diet, but make sure that you feed
the foods that are high in oils as a consistent
part of the diet.

meal of the day, and we couldn’t agree more. Breakfast replaces the body’s
already low blood-sugar levels and gives you energy to face the day.
So write this statement on a bunch of sticky notes and spread them through-
out the house, chant it daily for 30 minutes, or do whatever you need to do to
remember it: Don’t skip breakfast! You may have developed that habit your-
self, but it really is a bad habit for both children and adults. If you have this
bad habit, it will probably rub off on your children, so now is the time to
make breakfast a priority in your home.
Putting Vitamins and Minerals to Work
Vitamins and minerals are natural substances that a body needs for good
health. If your children eat a healthy, varied diet, they’ll get the nutrition they
need. Still, a lot of confusion surrounds vitamins and minerals, and children
need the same vitamins and minerals that adults do.
To cut through the confusion, Tables 2-1 and 2-2 are here to help. Here’s what
they tell you:
 The basics of the most important vitamins and minerals
 What these vitamins and minerals do in your body
 Which foods provide rich sources of vitamins and minerals
Use Tables 2-1 and 2-2 for quick references when you have questions about
vitamins and minerals.

About water-soluble vitamins
You may have heard the term water soluble vit-
amins. When you eat foods that have water-sol-
uble vitamins, the vitamins don’t get stored as
much in your body. Instead, they travel through
your bloodstream. And whatever your body
doesn’t use comes out when you urinate.
So these kinds of vitamins need to be replaced
often because they don’t stay in your body. This
collection of vitamins includes
 Folic acid (B9)
 Niacin (B5)
 Pyridoxine (B6)
 Riboflavin (B2)
 Thiamin (B1)
 Vitamin B12
 Vitamin C

The amazing but aggravating avocado
If you study Table 2-1, you may notice that one
food keeps popping up: the avocado. Avocados
are vitamin dense and easy to digest, so they’re
a perfect food for babies and children. In fact,
as you glance at recipes in this book, you may
see many recipes that contain avocados.
Considering its vitamin content, ease of diges-
tion, and even healthy oils, the avocado is per-
haps one of the most perfect foods for babies,
children, and even adults! However, avocados
can be difficult to pick at the supermarket and
they can be a real pain to work with. Here are a
few helpful tips to keep your avocados from
sending you to the loony bin:
 Choose firm, but pliable fruit. That’s right —
avocados are a fruit, and like a banana, they
turn soft after they’re ripe. So your first clue
to a ripe avocado is firmness. Avocados
that are too hard aren’t ripe, and ones that
are too soft are overripe.
 Look for an even unblemished texture.
Avoid bruises, soft spots, and hollows
between the flesh and skin. Shake the avo-
cado to test it. If the pit is loose, don’t buy it!
 Ripen your avocados at home. Simply place
the fruit in a brown paper bag and store it at
room temperature out of sunlight for three
to five days. Put a banana in the bag with
the avocado and it will ripen more quickly.
 Prevent darkening. The flesh of the avo-
cado quickly begins to darken when
exposed to the air, so it’s important to work
quickly with the “meat” after the avocado
is cut. Add a lemon wedge to it — the acid
in the lemon will slow down the darkening
process. Also, keeping the pit of the avo-
cado with the avocado insides slows down
darkening as well.
 Slice the avocado. Slice the avocado
lengthwise all the way around to the pit.
Then gently twist each side in the opposite
direction to separate halves. The pit should
remain in one side. Slip a large spoon in
between the skin and the meat and scoop
out the flesh or peel and slice. Wrap it
tightly to store it in the refrigerator for one
to two days.

Going Green: The Well-Rounded
Vegetarian Diet
You may opt for a vegetarian diet and wonder whether that same diet is
healthy for your child. Naturally, vegetarian diets differ — some include
seafood, some don’t, some allow dairy products, some don’t, and so on, with
an infinite number of nuances thanks to a lot of different people. Generally,
lacto-ovo-vegetarians include milk, milk products, and eggs in their diets but
exclude all meat and meat products. Lactovegetarians include milk and milk

Measuring calcium intake
Children need milk, but how much is a good
amount to ensure that your child gets the nec-
essary calcium, and what other foods are good
choices for children who don’t like milk?
Generally, follow these guidelines:
 Ages 1 to 3 years: About 500mg of calcium
each day (about two 8-ounce glasses of
milk)
 Ages 4 to 8 years: About 800mg of calcium
each day (about three 8-ounce glasses of
milk)
 Ages 9 to 18 years: About 1,300mg of cal-
cium each day (about four 8-ounce glasses
of milk)
So how do you know how much calcium certain
foods contain? The following table gives you
some hints.

products, but exclude eggs and all meat. Vegans are pure vegetarians (also
called strict vegetarians and total vegetarians) in that they exclude all animal-
derived food. In the end, the kind of diet parents follow typically determines
the diet the child follows.
At a basic level, a vegetarian diet avoids all meat and sometimes animal prod-
ucts, opting instead for a diet of only vegetables, fruits, grains, and nuts.
Challenges exist in an adult vegetarian diet, and you have the same obstacles
with a child’s diet, but namely in the areas of protein and milk, which young
children must have for proper nutrition.
Pediatricians argue among themselves concerning the safety of a vegan diet
with children. Naturally, vegetarian diets that permit dairy are easier to
manage because you can derive more calories, calcium, and protein from
products such as milk, cheese, and yogurt. Those diets that allow eggs also
have more flexibility because eggs are high in protein, and you won’t have to
look hard for other sources of protein. A strict vegan diet has some greater
challenges, such as the following:
 Vegan diets tend to be lower calorie and higher fiber diets — both of
which aren’t good for young children due to their eating habits and
immature digestive track. Because babies and children need more milk
products and sufficient energy to support growth, provide a greater soy
and tofu base to build the calories.
The small quantity of food consumed by a child from a vegan diet at one
sitting fails to provide enough energy from that quantity of food. A child’s
small stomach often becomes full before an adequate amount of food is
eaten to meet nutrient and energy needs.
 Children need higher levels of fat for brain development. Fatty foods,
such as whole milk, provide a necessity for children.
A vegan diet isn’t ideal for children; therefore, follow a more balanced diet,
such as MyPyramid for Kids discussed earlier in this chapter. If you feel
strongly about raising your child on a vegan diet, at least allow all dairy prod-
ucts and also consult your physician.
If you choose to follow a vegan diet, pay more attention to the food balancing
act and be highly organized with regard to the following issues:
 Calcium: Calcium is a mineral that’s mostly present in your child’s
bones. A calcium-rich diet helps meet daily requirements for the devel-
opment of strong bones and teeth in children. Calcium thrives in many
foods: broccoli, sweet potatoes, great northern and navy beans, and
leafy greens. You can also provide calcium through soymilk or orange
juice that is fortified with extra calcium.
39
Chapter 2: Raising a Well-Fed Child

 Calories: Ensure that your child receives enough calories each day
(refer to the charts in this chapter). In general, if your child eats a well-
balanced and varied vegetarian diet, gains weight, and has plenty of
energy, he’s probably getting enough calories.
 Iron: In general, the absorption of iron from meat, chicken, and fish is
higher — around 15 to 30 percent — than other sources, such as fruits
and veggies, which have absorption rates of only about 5 percent.
Although some vegetables and fruits contain iron, that iron is usually
not absorbed as readily as the iron from meats. You may need to give
your child iron substitutes to make sure that he’s getting enough.
 Protein: Make sure that your child gets enough protein and amino acids
by serving a balance of grains, legumes, nuts, seeds, vegetables, and
fruits.
 Vitamin B12: This vitamin is found only in animal-derived foods, so your
child may need to take supplements or eat vitamin B12-fortified foods
such as soymilk, fortified cereals, meat substitutes, and nutritional yeast.
 Vitamin D: Most children don’t have problems with vitamin D deficiency
because the human body makes vitamin D when exposed to sunlight.
This vitamin is present in fortified milk, egg yolks, and fish.
 Zinc: Your child may need to take supplements or eat foods that are for-
tified with zinc to get enough of this mineral. The best sources of zinc
are meat and yogurt. Zinc is also found in whole grains, brown rice,
legumes, and spinach.
Don’t use the Internet as your main source of information. A strict vegetarian
diet is challenging and requires planning and knowledge. Many claims on the
World Wide Web are wrong and simply push a vegetarian agenda.

The B. R. A. T. diet for a sick toddler
When your toddler is sick, always check with
your healthcare professional for advice, but
remember to increase your child’s fluid intake
and offer foods that naturally help with the prob-
lem. One special diet for an upset stomach is
the B. R. A. T. diet. Doctors have recommended
this diet for years. Take a look:
 Bananas: Bananas reduce stomach acidity
and keep your child’s potassium level in
check. Potassium helps regulate the body’s
blood pressure.
 Rice: Rice is a quick source of carbs and
protein and it helps when a child has diar-
rhea. It’s easy to digest and provides
energy.
 Apples or Applesauce: Apples are easily
digestible (important for already aggravated
tummies) and provide a good source of
sugar and vitamins, which provide energy
for your ailing youngster.
 Toast: Serve dry toast. It helps provide
carbs and often settles the stomach.

Seek the advice and help of a registered dietician so you can make certain
that your child gets a well-rounded, healthy diet that promotes growth and
development. A pediatrician can also point you in the right direction con-
cerning resources to help. For further reading, check out Being Vegetarian 
For Dummies and Vegetarian Cooking For Dummies, both by Suzanne Havala
(Wiley).
Knowing What to Expect of 
Your Child’s Eating Habits
Children aren’t adults. Sure, you knew that, but unfortunately, many parents
stress themselves out because they don’t keep in mind that children don’t
naturally eat on an organized schedule — a conditioned routine taught to you
by your parents and society. But train your child to eat meals and healthy
snacks on an organized schedule to avoid grazing. However, do realize that
children often eat a lot one day and not the next. This behavior is normal and
simply a part of your child’s development.
So, what pattern will your child likely follow? You can break down childhood
eating into three primary stages: 0 to 12 months, 12 to 18 months, and 18
months to 5 years. Table 2-3 gives you an overview of how your child may
behave in terms of feeding.
Table 2-3
Eating Habits by Age
Age
Eating Habit
0–12 months
Babies depend on breast milk or formula and slowly grow
into eating mashed baby foods and then to solids. Milk
requirements change during the first year. (Check out
Chapters 4 through 6.)
12–18 months
Your child eats five meals a day, with a constant source of
milk. Move from pureed baby food to solids. Provide small
portions at planned times with snacks between meals at
consistent times. Don’t be surprised if your child is hun-
grier at some meals and not at others. Don’t let your child
graze throughout the day or he may not come to mealtime
ready to eat. 
18 months–5 years
Your child slowly grows into eating three primary meals a
day with snacks between meals. Your child eats more at
times than others (totally normal behavior). Never force
your child to eat if she’s not hungry or interested.
Introduce new foods and dishes during these years and
strive to provide healthy snacks.

Growth spurts and humongous appetites
When your child enters a strong growth stage,
he often tanks up for several days or even
weeks in a row and then backs off the food after
the quick growth stage passes. Use these
opportunities to feed more calorie-dense and
calcium-rich foods to support growing bones.
Our 4-year-old follows this pattern, and we keep
cheese sticks and yogurt on hand, along with
fresh fruit. In fact, during a growing spurt is a
perfect opportunity to introduce new foods and
recipes because your growing child is naturally
more hungry and interested in food.

 Shopping for produce
 Cooling, freezing, and heating food
 Using caution in the kitchen
T
he first (and perhaps most important) step in cooking baby and toddler
meals is simple preparation. You need additional items in your kitchen,
and you need to get organized before cooking. You may want to skip over this
chapter and get to the fun stuff — recipes! — but preparing the recipes in this
book requires that you stop first and get ready.
This chapter explores gearing up for your child’s first meals. You find out
about your pantry needs, basic on-hand equipment, and storing and heating
food. The kitchen basics in this chapter are simple and practical. You receive
tips that help you get organized and keep your sanity. Put the information to
work, and your kitchen is ready for meals in no time!
Getting the Right Equipment
You probably heard someone in your family at some point say, “Always use
the right tool for the right job.” When it comes to feeding babies and tod-
dlers, we couldn’t agree more. With the right tools and equipment on hand,
preparing meals for your child is easier and more rewarding simply because
you save time and aggravation. That’s why we’re devoting a few pages to
equipment.

Preparation and storage equipment
Start out with the basics. Because you make healthy and tasty meals in your
kitchen, be aware of the few equipment must-haves.
Basic stuff you probably already have
You need typical items used in the kitchen: bowls, spoons, a can opener, and
so on. Aside from the standard equipment options explored here, a few addi-
tional items may make your life a bit easier. You can find the following recom-
mended tools at most retail, department, or superstores:
 Cutting board: Use a standard cutting board for an array of different
cooking chores. Be aware that debate occurs over which kind of cutting
board is safer for your health: wood or plastic. Theories state that wood
cutting boards harbor more germs. However, whether you choose wood
or plastic, the key is simply washing the board with soap after each use
and allowing it to air dry. You may want to use two cutting boards, one
for meats and one for vegetables. However, with careful washing, you
don’t have to worry about cross-contamination.
General concern exists in the scientific community that antibacterial
soap is really just making bacteria more resistant to antibodies, which
we really need for treating illnesses and such. So, the advice across the
board is to avoid using antibacterial soap for this reason. These soaps
and such not only kill good bacteria but also could lead to resistant
strains of bacteria that we can’t treat and manage with antibodies.
 Knives: Special knives aren’t needed to cook for your child. However, a
general kitchen knife set is handy, and a paring knife or peeler to peel
fruit is essential.
 Measuring cups and spoons: A set of measuring cups and measuring
spoons enables you to measure both liquid and dry ingredients.
 Mixing bowls: You may already own a collection of mixing bowls, but if
you don’t (or if you need new ones), now is the time to head to the store.
You mix a lot as you prepare meals, so an assortment of sizes of mixing
bowls comes in handy. Glass, plastic, or metal works well. Make sure that
no matter what bowls you choose, you purchase ones that are durable.
 Rubber spatula: A spatula makes scooping baby food out of a food
processor a lot easier. Of course, you can use a normal dinner spoon,
but the spatula does a much better job of removing excess food from the
sides of the processor or mixer, leaving little food to be wasted.
 Saucepans and skillets: Aluminum pans are coated with Teflon and tend
to flake their coating over time, and aluminum should never come in
contact with the food because of possible food contamination. So if you
own older saucepans and skillets, which are commonly aluminum, con-
sider replacing them.
44
Part I: Lovin’ Spoonfuls: Feeding Your Baby and Toddler 

A good set of stainless steel saucepans and skillets will serve you well.
You won’t have to worry about flaking and aluminum contact with your
food. Shoot for a midline collection. You don’t need the most expensive,
but avoid the really cheap pans as well because they don’t withstand
prolonged use.
Food processors, blenders, or hand grinders
You’re going to do a lot of cutting and processing in order to make foods
edible for a young mouth and stomach. Make the experience easier by using
a food processor for chopping and processing (unless you train for body
building competitions and want to mash the food by hand; in that case, you
should be reading Weight Training For Dummies, too).
A standard food processor tends to be flatter and more elongated than a
blender. Figure 3-1 shows you a sketch of a typical food processor. In truth,
any food processor works well for the tasks performed in the kitchen. But
you do have a few options:
 Standard food processor: The processed foods for your baby or toddler
are easily handled by a standard food processor — likely costing around
$20 — but you may want one with more bells and whistles. Keep in mind
that if you’re buying a food processor to make baby food but not for other
family needs, a basic model does everything you need. If you’re looking at
several processors at a department store, choose a midrange model.
 Baby-food processor: You’re likely to find a processor advertised online
as a specific product for making baby food. These processors are often
small (which is nice because they save counter space), and you may
enjoy using a food processor especially for baby foods. However, a stan-
dard food processor gives you more flexibility, especially when making
more than baby food. If the idea of having a food processor solely dedi-
cated to baby food sounds great, and you have the money in your
budget, visit www.onestepahead.com. Baby-food processors usually 
sell for under $30.
 Bells-and-whistles processor: The higher priced models have more pro-
cessing modes and related electronic features. For $50, you can get almost
anything you want, within reason, for single-family use.
Now for the burning question: Can you use a blender instead of a food
processor? Yes. However, we don’t recommend it. Generally speaking, a
blender blends liquid products. A food processor, instead, is designed to
process a variety of foods. If you use a blender, you may get irregular results
and find yourself frustrated — depending on the kind of food you’re trying to
make. This frustration may come into play even if you’re making smoothies
because many shakes and smoothies start with fresh fruit and need extra
processing to break down the food thoroughly. Save yourself the headache
and buy a food processor.
45
Chapter 3: Tools and Tricks of the Trade: Kitchen Basics

Strainers
Strainers are used to sift food contents, most often in order to separate liquids
from solids. You may have some kind of strainer in your kitchen, although it
may technically be called a colander, which is a bowl shape and is used for
draining liquid from foods such as pasta.
A strainer typically has very small holes so you can more effectively remove
liquid without losing any food. You can find plastic models, but we recom-
mend a wire mesh strainer for preparing your child’s meals because they’re
more durable and tend to give you finer straining quality.
A wire mesh strainer (shown in Figure 3-2) is a simple strainer made from wire
that forms a mesh (probably didn’t need to spell that one out, did we?). You
can use the wire strainer to mash food quickly by hand (use the back of a
large spoon and press the food down through the strainer). You can also use
the strainer to remove food from the liquid you’re cooking it in.
Don’t forget to have a bowl to catch the strained liquid if you’re using the
liquid in some other part of your cooking.
Strainers come in different gauges, or wire strength, and a medium gauge
strainer works well. Keep your strainer handy when traveling, or in a pinch,
and you can quickly mash food without using a food processor.
Electric mixer
For preparing meals, the basic mixer is a helpful tool. Unless you want your
meal preparation to be a personal bicep workout, it’s a good idea to have an
electric mixer — regardless of whether it’s a hand mixer or a stand mixer,
you’re still avoiding the hassle of moving your arm around in circles a billion
times.
Figure 3-1:
A standard
food
processor is
handy for
pureeing.
46
Part I: Lovin’ Spoonfuls: Feeding Your Baby and Toddler 

If you don’t have an electric mixer, you can buy a simple, hand-held version for
around $15. Shop around at discount stores or garage sales for a cheap model.
Don’t spend extra money unless you want additional features, such as extra
mixing speeds. All you need is a mixer that has at least a low and high speed.
Steamer
Steamers cook and soften vegetables, but more of the nutrients stay in the
vegetables when compared with boiling or frying. A stand-alone model
(meaning an electric unit, as opposed to the stovetop steamer) that steams
food and even works as a double boiler starts at $75. The electric steamer is
shown in Figure 3-3.
However, you can save yourself the $75 and simply buy a stovetop steamer
(shown in Figure 3-4). The manual version allows you to place the steamer
over a boiling pot of water to steam vegetables and costs about $10.

Storage and microwaveable containers
One advantage of our modern world is refrigeration. After you’ve cooked
your food and served it, you can store leftovers in the refrigerator or even
the freezer for an extended period of time. When it comes to freezing or
refrigerating leftovers, follow the helpful hints below:
 Don’t be prejudiced against containers of various sizes. Have a variety
of storage containers on hand of differing sizes (we recommend 10 to 
15 containers). Some recipes in this book yield several servings that you
can freeze and use at your convenience, and other meals make only one
or two servings, so you don’t waste a lot of storage space when you
have different-sized containers to fit the foods.
Break up the leftovers into individual serving sizes for freezing. In this
case, have a good collection of smaller freezer containers. You can even
purchase them with labels so you can write down the meal and the
freeze date.
 Gather a few ice cube trays. Purchase larger ice cube trays and fill with
soups, prepared baby cereal, smoothies, or any other liquid and place
the trays in the freezer. Remove the frozen cubes, thaw, and serve them
as you need them.
 Let marketing copy be your guide. Use only freezer containers that are
sold as such. These containers withstand the rigors of freezing and pro-
tect your food from freezer burn. Use both hard containers (such as
plastic containers) as well as high-quality freezer bags.
 Look for reheatable containers. In many cases, you’ll take something
directly from the freezer and want to reheat it. Easily transferable con-
tainers allow for multiuse and easier cleanup, because you don’t have 
to dirty a separate bowl for reheating your leftovers. Durable plastic
freezer containers can be a real timesaver because you can remove them
from the freezer and place them directly in the microwave.

Feeding equipment
If you’re expecting a new baby or one has just arrived, a number of items may
come in handy within the next few months to make feeding your baby safer
and easier. Naturally, if you walk into any baby store or even a baby section
in a department store, you’re bombarded with many different choices and
brands of feeding equipment. The following sections give you a few pointers
to keep in mind while you’re shopping.
Stocking up on the essentials: Bowls, spoons, and forks
Feeding bowls, baby spoons, and baby forks come in different colors, sizes,
and materials.
 Bowls: Bowls should be dishwasher safe, so you can clean them often
and sanitize them in the dishwasher. Plastic bowls work best because
they don’t break. Don’t use glassware around a baby or young child.
 Spoons: Feed a baby with only a rubber-covered spoon during the first
year to prevent mouth injuries (babies commonly make jerky head move-
ments, so the rubber-covered spoon prevents cuts in your baby’s mouth).
 Forks: Your child can start using a rubber-covered fork at about 15
months of age but shouldn’t use a real fork until well over 2 years old.
Parent supervision during mealtime continues to be the most important
aspect in preventing injuries from utensils as well as choking. Forks are
dangerous — even though they’re coated, your baby can still jab his
mouth, lips, nose, and eyes. Play it safe and make sure that you supervise.
Reducing the spill factor with sippy cups
Sippy cups, spill-proof cups that enable babies to sip juice, milk, formula, or
water without spilling, are invaluable to your kitchen repertoire after your
baby is old enough to use the cups. Sippy cups, shown in Figure 3-5, have a
flow-control valve that allows a child to sip a liquid from the cup, but when
the child throws the cup down, nothing leaks out (keeping you from having 
to replace all your carpet around the time your baby turns 1).
Make sure that the sippy cup lid screws on tightly and that you can easily
clean the cup. Check for a removable flow-control mechanism inside the cup’s
lid. This feature allows for more thorough cleaning of all the cup’s parts.
Getting baby comfy in a highchair
Many different brands and models of highchairs are marketed each year.
Each type of chair looks different and comes with a variety of options to suit
the needs of your child (and you too). Shopping for a highchair can be diffi-
cult because of marketing ploys, and you may not understand exactly what
you need.
49
Chapter 3: Tools and Tricks of the Trade: Kitchen Basics

Here are some tips that help you cut through the marketing lingo and figure
out which highchair is high in quality and safety:
 Check the chair’s credentials. Before you become enamored with a par-
ticular highchair, make sure that the chair meets the Juvenile Products
Manufacturers Association (JPMA) standards. This association provides
voluntary safety standards that all reputable highchair manufacturers
follow. Inspect the chair for a safety rating and information (look on the
tags and stickers attached to the chair). You can also check out the high-
chair manufacturer’s Web site for more details. Check out the JPMA’s
Web site at www.jpma.org/consumer/index.html for more information
or to see if your highchair meets the standards.
 Consider the design. Work with the chair in the store for a moment and
see that it’s easy to adjust the height. Also, many chairs recline, which
makes feeding a young baby starting on cereal easier because of the
extra head support (see Figure 3-6). Work with the mechanisms and
imagine yourself juggling a baby and other kitchen demands. Is the chair
easy to work with or complicated and problematic?
 Make sure that the chair is stable. A secure highchair has a low center
of gravity and a wide base so the chair doesn’t turn over. Grab the chair
and shake it around a bit to see that the chair feels stable and sturdy.
 Consider cleanup time. Highchairs get messy, so when you’re looking at
chairs, try to imagine cleaning them. If the chair has excessive cracks
and crevices that you have to clean out, you may want to consider
another model. Also, check the seat and padding — make sure that it
can be easily scrubbed clean. We think that plastic chairs are easier to
clean than wood (and just as flexible). Fabric highchair covers should be
machine washable and dryable.

Part I: Lovin’ Spoonfuls: Feeding Your Baby and Toddler 

 Look for locking wheels. If the highchair has wheels, make sure that the
wheels have a locking mechanism that is easy to lock and unlock. Locking
wheels prevent the highchair from rolling around, or if you have other
kids, the locking mechanism prevents your children from pushing around
your baby in the chair and possibly causing injury. Locking wheels can
also prevent a roller derby from breaking out in your kitchen.
 Make sure that folding highchairs completely fold up for easy storage.
Try to fold and unfold the chair a few times while you’re in the store.
Make sure that the locking mechanism works well, so the chair can’t fold
up with a child in it.
 Look for seat belts. All highchairs should have a seat belt, preferably
one that has a five-point shoulder harness. Don’t buy a model that only
has one simple belt. Also, check the belts for comfort and durability, and
make sure that you can easily clean them (and believe us, the belts get
really dirty!).
Look for highchair models with removable, machine-washable belts,
because cleanup is much easier than having to scrub the belts by hand.
You’ll be sending thank-you letters for this tip when your little one pukes
in his highchair.
 Check out the food tray. The food tray needs to be smooth, practical,
and not include items that could hurt a baby’s fingers. Rough-surface
trays can trap food and germs. Tray rims help contain food, and dish-
washer-safe trays eliminate extra cleanup time!

Stocking Your Pantry
Have you ever had that sinking sensation that you don’t have food in your
house, but you don’t know what to buy when you get to the grocery store?
This feeling is common, and as you get ready to prepare your meals, you
need the right ingredients readily available in your pantry. Keep in mind that
you can’t keep everything you need on-hand at all times (without running out
of room and breaking your grocery budget), but you’ll want to keep some
staple items in the cupboard.
First, follow a few simple steps when surveying your pantry:
 Throw out old food and make room for new. Rid yourself of that box of
mac & cheese you bought when you were in college as well as the cans
of vegetables that look like antiques.
 Take inventory and find out exactly what you have. Organize your
pantry by food groups and even create a shopping list, so you’ll be
super-organized and prepared for cooking.
 Throw away or donate items that you know you’ll never eat. Check 
the expiration date on food items you no longer want. If the food is still
edible, donate the stuff you don’t want to a food pantry, local shelter, or
other charity in your area. Throw out the items that have expired. You
probably don’t want to eat it, and neither does anyone else.
Because the first few months of life primarily consist of breast milk or for-
mula, don’t worry about stocking your pantry until your baby begins to eat
infant cereal. Even then, your baby eats small amounts, so don’t buy a truck-
load of cereals at a wholesale store, because you’ll want to make your own in
most cases. At this stage in your baby’s life, your pantry is primarily reserved
for bottles, lids, rubber nipples, and so on, especially if you’re formula feed-
ing your baby. Because many babies begin eating cereal at around the 4-month
mark, you’ll need to have your food processor purchased and ready if you
plan on making your own cereal. Discover more about cereal feeding in
Chapter 5.
The more you integrate a healthy way of eating into your own lifestyle, your
toddler meals begin to overlap with items you eat as well. Additionally, the
recipes in this book tend to call for some staple items that you need to keep
around. Note: The items indicated with a star aren’t needed until the child is
at least 1. Two stars indicate that you should wait until she’s 2.
 Broth, reduced sodium, chicken or beef
 Cheerios (a quick food for hungry babies)

 Pasta, assorted
 Peanut butter**
 Pepper
 Pizza sauce
 Raisins
 Rice cakes
 Rice, brown
 Rolled oats
 Salt

You’ll also need some items that are perishable (cheese, for example) and
semi-perishable (such as fruits and vegetables). Naturally, you need to do a bit
of planning to ensure that you’ll use the following items before they expire:
 American cheese, slices
 Bread, whole-wheat
 Butter, not margarine
 Cheddar cheese, shredded
 Eggs
 English muffins

Going all natural: The organic diet
If you’re into organic food options, or at least
you want to be more so with your child, keep in
mind that your pantry items don’t change from
the suggestions mentioned above, but add the
task of shopping at a health-food store that
offers organic produce and supplies.
If you haven’t been living an organic life, but
you’re interested, it’s important to understand
what organic really means in order to get into
the organic groove. Generally speaking, organic
means natural food — food coming from plants
and animals that have been grown without the
use of synthetic fertilizers, pesticides, anti-
biotics, growth hormones, and feed addi-
tives (additives given to the animals in their
food). Read more about the U.S. standards for
organic food at www.ams.usda.gov/nop/
Consumers/brochure.html.
The USDA doesn’t make any claim that organic
foods are better for you or more nutritious. Of
course, it stands to reason that minimal chemi-
cals and additives are always best. Yet, finding
organic food (the label indicates organic items
and carries a USDA organic seal of approval)
can be difficult and more expensive. Many
organic items don’t have a long shelf life, which
is another issue to consider. Still, you may want
to use as many organic items as the availability
and your budget allow because they’re more
natural.
Depending on where you live, finding an organic
store or organic section within your grocery
store may not be a problem, but if you’re not
near an organic store, shop online for several
options. Try www.greenmarket.com and
wellnessgrocer.com.

Selecting Good Produce
Old wives’ tales abound about selecting good produce. How do you know if
something is ripe, too ripe, under ripe? The conventional wisdom can be a bit
maddening, but put these simple tips into place to help you select the best
produce every time. Table 3-1 gives you the skinny on selecting produce.
Table 3-1
Selecting Produce
Produce
Selection Method
Apples
No bruising or mushy, soft skin. Firm — best test
is taste.
Apricots
Color should be uniform.
Avocados
Brown skin with pale green tint. Soft (not mushy)
to the squeeze if using immediately; ripens uncut
at home. If squashy, they’re over ripe.
Berries (any kind)
Smell for a sweet aroma. Check underside of
carton to make sure it isn’t berry stained or moldy.
Broccoli
Completely green with no yellowing; should smell
sweet, not like cabbage.
Cantaloupes
Tan skin (not green). Smell sweet at stem end.
Shouldn’t hear seeds rattling when shaken.
Carrots
Bright green tops, crisp, deep orange color.
Cauliflower
Tightly packed florets without discoloration.
Citrus
Should feel heavy.
Corn
Fresh silk with unwilted leaves. Kernels should be
plump, filled out.
Cucumbers
Firm skins, not limp or shriveled. English have
smooth skin; Japanese have wrinkled skin.
Eggplant
Shiny skin with firm, even texture. Small to
medium are younger and sweeter.
Green Beans
Crisp and bright.
Greens, Chard, Kale, Mustard
Rich, dark leaves with no yellowing.
Honeydews
Creamy yellow skin. Smell sweet at stem end.
Shouldn’t hear seeds rattling when shaken.

Table 3-1 (continued)
Produce
Selection Method
Nectarines
Flesh gives slightly to pressure. Avoid fruit with
green tinge.
Onions
Sweet summer onions should be firm.
Pears
Color and texture vary; best when firm with some
give at stem end.
Plums
Uniform color and some spring when pressed.
Potatoes
Avoid sprouts. Small have better flavor.
Spinach
Bright green leaves (flat or crinkled).
Strawberries
Full red berries with some shine. No trace of mold.
Summer Squash
Not too scratched or limp; look for juice coming
out of stem to tell if truly fresh.
Sweet Potatoes
Firm, smooth skin with no soft spots.
Tomatoes
Firm but not hard, aromatic, full red color.
Cracking on skin doesn’t matter.
Watermelons
Firm with a green (not yellowish) skin. Shouldn’t
hear seeds rattling when shaken.
As a general rule, if your child is younger than 1, try to pull away the first
layer of a vegetable or the peeling of a fruit before using it, because infants
aren’t able to chew through the peel. Doing so removes any lingering pesti-
cide residue and bacteria. After your child reaches the 1-year mark, you can
leave the peel on — it contains most if not all of the nutrients — but be sure
to wash the produce thoroughly.
Storing Food Safely in the Fridge
As you make meals for your youngster, you want to reduce the amount of
work and time necessary for this noble task. After all, if you’re creating
purees and other dishes that require some processing, you want to prepare
more than one meal at the time. After all that work, store the additional meals
in a healthy, convenient, and practical way.
Sure, you’ve been storing food in the refrigerator for a long time, and you’re an
old pro at leftovers, but now you’re thinking about your child’s meals and won-
dering if the way you store food is good enough. Having a bit more concern
56
Part I: Lovin’ Spoonfuls: Feeding Your Baby and Toddler 

about cold storage basics comes with being a parent. Follow the rules of stor-
age to ensure safe and fresh food for your young one.
 Don’t leave foods out at room temperature for more than two hours.
Some experts believe that more than two hours is okay, but to be safe,
limit exposure to two hours or throw out the food.
 Set the internal temperature of the refrigerator between 38 and 40
degrees. Your refrigerator shouldn’t be set above 40 degrees for proper
refrigeration, so check the internal temperature, and adjust the refrigera-
tor settings if necessary.
 Store premade foods in plastic containers with good lids. By “good,”
we mean lids that seal tightly. Make sure that you use the right lid with
the right container (in other words, don’t get one bowl’s lid mixed up
with another bowl’s lid), and be sure to press as much air out of the con-
tainer as possible. In many cases, pressing the center seal removes air,
so check the container instructions for details. Or you may want to con-
sider some FoodSaver products that remove all air (and work great).
Find out more at www.foodsaver.com.
 Keep an eye on storage times. How long can you store food in the refrig-
erator? The answer depends on what you’re storing. As a general rule,
leave prepared meals in the refrigerator for only a couple of days. Also
toss any canned baby food that’s been opened. This approach maintains
sanitary food and keeps your refrigerator from becoming a collection of
bowls and mystery dishes. You can find a printable brochure outlining
different foods and refrigerator life at www.fmi.org/consumer/food
keeper/brochure.cfm.
Getting Ahead of the Game: 
Freezing and Thawing
As you prepare baby and toddler meals, you may choose to freeze some for
an on-hand extended supply. In many cases, you can easily freeze and reheat
some of the meals that you make. Naturally, frozen food items taste better
when made fresh, but the freezer helps you get ahead in your cooking and
out of a bind when you need a quick meal.
Preserving fresh foods in the freezer
Generally, you can store any prepared food items in the freezer. The key is 
to use an airtight container and make sure that you adhere to the two-hour
room temperature rule concerning spoiled food (see the preceding section).
Meals can be easily thawed and reheated or simply removed from the freezer,
thawed, and heated in the microwave just as any frozen food item. However,
fresh fruits and vegetables can be a bit trickier.
57
Chapter 3: Tools and Tricks of the Trade: Kitchen Basics

One helpful technique for pureed baby meals is the ice-cube tray method.
This technique is a super-easy method of food storage and works great.
1. Make the puree as desired and spoon it into a clean ice-cube tray. Cover
the tray with foil or place in a large plastic freezer bag. Freeze the tray.
2. For serving, remove one of the frozen cubes as needed and heat the
cube in a microwave-safe dish or a saucepan until melted. You have one
serving without wasting!
As your child ages, increase the serving size by adding additional cubes.
Naturally, make sure that you allow the food to cool after you reheat it.
You can easily store fresh vegetables and fruits for later use that you want to
use in meals, purees, and shakes. This method is perfectly safe, and contrary
to popular belief, freezing doesn’t delete all the nutrition in vegetables and
fruits (boiling does more damage). In fact, many of the fruits and vegetables
you buy at the grocery store have been thawed from a flash-freezing process
(a super-cold, super-fast freezing done for preservation during transit).
Like anything you store in the freezer, you should put fresh vegetables and
fruits in an airtight container and remove as much air as possible before
freezing to avoid freezer burn. When you want to use vegetables or fruits,
follow these guidelines:
 Don’t let a fruit or vegetable thaw and then refreeze it a second time,
because it depletes the nutritional value.
 You can cook a vegetable or fruit and then freeze it.
Never store any baby food in a glass container or jar in the freezer. The glass
can easily crack and put small shards of glass in the food.
Time to eat! Thawing frozen foods
Naturally, thawing frozen items can be time consuming, especially if you let
Mother Nature take control of the thawing after you remove the item from the
freezer.
Here are a few tips to help speed thawing along:
 Place frozen meals in a pot of cold water to help speed up the thawing
process without damage. The process works especially well if the water
is changed every 30 minutes or if the water is moving (run cold water
over the frozen item, especially produce).
 Put frozen meat in a watertight bag and run water over meats for
thawing. Cook immediately.
58
Part I: Lovin’ Spoonfuls: Feeding Your Baby and Toddler 

 Place the frozen item in the fridge to thaw. If you’re not in a big hurry,
the food naturally thaws out in a few hours without you having to baby-
sit it.
 You don’t need to thaw frozen vegetables. If you want to cook frozen
vegetables, you don’t need to thaw them first. Just proceed with cook-
ing, and the produce quickly warms up to right temperature.
Food is safe when frozen, but as soon as you thaw the food, any present bac-
teria can resurrect and multiply. Don’t leave thawing food at room tempera-
ture for more than two hours. Thaw and cook immediately!
Feeling Hot (But Not Too Hot): 
Heating and Reheating
Heating and reheating questions tend to be common as parents prepare
meals. How hot is hot enough? What about reheating? What about using the
microwave?
Follow the standard heating rules that apply to any food. These basic rules for
heating food for older children or adults also apply to babies and toddlers:
 Reheat all previously cooked food to an internal temperature of 165
degrees or above. You may also want to have a meat thermometer for
checking the internal temps of different meats.
 Remove packaging before you heat the food. If you’re using prepack-
aged baby food, put the food in a different container before heating.
 Heat the food to a suitable feeding temperature. Prepackaged baby
food is already cooked and canned, so all you need to do is warm it up.
Concerning temperature, your baby prefers warm meals (after all, she’s
had warm breast milk or formula). So serve the food warm but not hot.
Simply put, taste the food to see that the temperature is just right.
Lukewarm temperatures are typically good for babies.
 Heat baby food in increments of 10 seconds on a high or medium set-
ting. Baby food tends to heat quickly, so gradually heating food saves
you the time later standing in front of the freezer waiting for the food to
cool down. Also, always stir microwaved foods well and taste them to
avoid hot spots from uneven microwave heating. Never heat prepared
formula bottles or breast milk in a microwave.
59
Chapter 3: Tools and Tricks of the Trade: Kitchen Basics

 Cool overheated food in the freezer. If you’re heating baby food and 
it gets too hot, you can quickly cool it by placing it in the freezer for 
30 seconds, stirring and retesting it before serving. Continue this
process until the food reaches the desired temperature.
 Add water to dried-out food. Depending on what you’re reheating, you
may notice that the previously frozen item is a bit dry. Solve this prob-
lem by adding a little water to keep the food from scorching.
 Make sure that you use microwave-safe dishes. One way to test dishes
for microwave safety includes putting a cup of water in the dish in ques-
tion and microwaving it for one minute. If the water is cool and the dish
is hot at the end of the minute, the dish isn’t safe for microwave use.
 Throw out food that’s been microwaved too much. Because food tends
to get tough and difficult to eat the more it’s reheated, your child may
not eat continuously heated food. Do your baby a favor and toss those
crusty leftovers.
 Don’t microwave fresh produce. Research shows that microwaving
fresh produce kills antioxidants that are naturally found in the produce.
Exercising Kitchen Caution
One significant source of food contamination occurs in the kitchen area
simply because counters, dishes, and utensils don’t get cleaned properly. The
idea of putting bacteria in our mouths is a little scary. Because you’re making
food for your kids, you don’t want to take the risk of spreading bacteria.
Just because a surface or dish looks clean doesn’t mean that it is clean in terms
of bacteria. So, here are a few tips to consider as you clean your kitchen:
 Sterilize dishes and utensils. Use a pot of boiling water and boil the
times for ten minutes.
 Use your dishwasher as a sterilizer. Most dishwashers heat water to at
least 140 degrees Fahrenheit, and this temperature is perfect for killing
bacteria and sterilizing your cooking tools. Check your dishwasher’s
owner manual for water regulations.
 Hand wash dishes or utensils with dish soap. Scrub surfaces with a
clean sponge or other cleaning pad.
 Wash the bottle nipples separately. If you fill the sink with dishes from
dinner and throw the nipples in as well, the grease and oils from the
other dishes are difficult to wash from rubber nipples (and deep inside
bottles for that matter).
60
Part I: Lovin’ Spoonfuls: Feeding Your Baby and Toddler 

When you wash baby items, allow them to air dry rather than towel dry.
Towels can harbor harmful bacteria, which you’re rubbing onto the
baby’s bottles and nipples.
 Clean all counter areas with soap. Simply wiping away food and grime
with a wet rag or sponge doesn’t do the trick.
Use disposable disinfecting wipes that come in handy dispensing con-
tainers and a variety of scents. The bleach in the wipes kills germs as
you scrub the counter. These wipes are also handy for cleaning and 
sanitizing highchairs.
In addition to basic kitchen cleanliness tips, practice food hygiene with raw
eggs, meat, and fish. These common foods harbor bacteria and salmonella (in
the case of raw eggs), so handling them requires care. Follow the guidelines
below when handling raw eggs, fish, and meat:
 Make sure that you wash your hands with soap before and after contact
with these foods.
 Never handle another food item after preparation without first washing
your hands thoroughly with soap.
 Keep raw items in the refrigerator until you’re ready to cook. Leaving
this kind of food out at room temperature enhances the risk of bacterial
growth. If you forget to refrigerate eggs, fish, or meat, throw them away.
 Thoroughly cook the raw foods. Children don’t have the built-up immune
system of adults, so they’re particularly at risk for food bacteria. No runny
eggs or rare meats for children — ever!
 Wash utensils, bowls, cutting boards, and counter areas with soap and
water immediately after using them with these raw foods. Many people
cross-contaminate another food because they forget to disinfect their
kitchen gear with soap.
 Cook recipes containing eggs to at least 160 degrees in order to kill 
bacteria.
 Concerning eggs, meats, and fish, when in doubt, throw it out.

You’ve arrived home with your bundle of joy and all is well in the world.
But in all the changes and adjustments, the questions of eating sched-

better — breast milk or formula? These looming questions can be compli-
cated, but don’t worry. This quick chapter helps you sort out the doubt and
get your feet on solid ground again as we guide you through your baby’s
eating needs and habits during the first four months. If you have further
questions, check out Breastfeeding For Dummies, by Sharon Perkins, RN, and
Carol Vannais, RN (Wiley), for more in-depth information about breastfeeding.
Also consult your healthcare provider and/or a lactation consultant, because
many questions and concerns that are particular to different individuals can’t
be addressed by books.
Your Baby’s Favorite Drink
Milk, milk, milk — the word at the core of your baby vocabulary for years to
come. As newborns, babies’ only food source is milk because they don’t have
mature digestive systems, and in fact, it takes some time for a baby to develop
a more mature digestive system that can handle the demands of real food (not
to mention that “real” food presents a choking hazard for your infant). As your
baby grows, he begins eating other foods but still depends on milk. Later on,
your toddler still needs a diet that contains milk in order to get the necessary
calcium and nutrition. In short, it’s all about the milk.

Milk contains proteins, fats, lactose, and various vitamins and minerals. The
mammary glands of all mature female mammals produce milk after the females
have given birth, and breast milk meets all the baby’s needs for nourishment
during the first four to six months.
That said, we enter the first topic of baby-food discussion — the choice
between breast milk and formula.
Breast milk or formula?
The 20th century, for all its advances, uniquely made life much easier but
much more complicated at the same time. For the thousands of years before
this time, every new mother breastfed her baby or at least hired someone to
do it. If a baby didn’t breastfeed, the baby didn’t survive.
Yet, in the 20th century, doctors and other healthcare professionals began
saying that synthetic formula was, in fact, better. However, over the past sev-
eral years, researchers and doctors have returned to breastfeeding, saying
that Mother Nature knows best after all and that we simply can’t copy breast
milk and manufacture it. In fact, the World Health Organization and the
American Academy of Pediatrics both agree that breastfeeding is best.
In the following sections, we help you iron out the benefits and potential
obstacles of breastfeeding, as well as the drawbacks to formula feeding and
the positive aspects of going that route.
Benefiting from breastfeeding
We, your authors, wholeheartedly agree with doctors when it comes to
breastfeeding — hands down, it provides the best nutrition you can give to
your baby. And of course, we’d never make that claim without giving you sev-
eral reasons why — read this section for the plethora of supporting facts.
Sheer goodness from Day One: Colostrum
Before a baby’s birth, the mother’s breasts begin preparing for the ever-
important task of breastfeeding. In fact, the mother’s breasts first produce
specifically formulated liquid called colostrum — a thick, yellow liquid that
doesn’t even look like milk. Colostrum is the first milk the baby needs and
benefits your newborn in many ways:
 Antibodies: Antibodies help build your baby’s immune system and are
present in high concentrations in colostrum.
 Nutrition: Colostrum, containing the necessary fat, protein, and carbo-
hydrates, is concentrated nutrition for your newborn.
66
Part II: From Womb to Highchair: The First 12 Months 

 Laxatives: Colostrum lubricates your baby’s digestive system to help
him have his first bowel movement. It also gets your baby’s digestive
system ready for the breast milk that will come in two to five days fol-
lowing delivery.
After a few days, a week, or even a bit longer, the mother’s breasts begin pro-
ducing what you would think of as “breast milk” in place of colostrum. The
liquid becomes thinner and whiter in color, but it’s still chock full of nutrition
for your baby.
The many great pros of breast milk
In terms of value, why is choosing to feed your baby breast milk worth it to
you and your new baby? Consider the ingredients of breastmilk:
 Over 100 ingredients — including digestive enzymes, minerals, vitamins,
and hormones — that can’t be reproduced with formula.
 Special proteins that are designed to strengthen your baby’s immature
digestive system
 High carbohydrate levels and large amounts of lactose, a necessary
sugar that impacts general growth and brain development
 Fatty acids such as DHA and ARA that enhance nervous system develop-
ment, oligosaccharides (for healthy intestines), and growth-promoting
hormones
Check out these other benefits:
 Breast milk is formulated for your baby. It changes as she grows (just like
colostrum), giving her what she needs in terms of nutrition and calories.
 Breast milk is always ready — no mixing or heating.
 Children who are breastfed have fewer ear infections, colic, constipa-
tion, diarrhea, and trips to the doctor than formula-fed babies do.
Researchers thought that this distinction was caused by the position of
feeding, but recent studies say that it is the additional antibodies found
in breast milk that makes the difference.
 Breastfeeding encourages a natural bond between a mother and her baby.
 Breast milk is free!
Facing the challenges of breastfeeding
Breast milk is the natural means to feed a new baby, so it should naturally 
be the right choice and the easy choice. Right? Not necessarily. For certain,
breastfeeding boasts important benefits, but we do understand that it doesn’t
work for everyone — some women have trouble breastfeeding. Perhaps the
67
Chapter 4: Welcome to the World, Baby! The First Four Months

milk supply just isn’t there, or women have problems with blocked ducts.
Regardless, understand that successful breastfeeding is dependent on sev-
eral factors — some that breastfeeding women can control and some that
they can’t.
Check out the following typical challenges when it comes to breastfeeding
your newborn:
 General problems: Many women experience a number of general breast-
feeding problems and struggles, including milk letdown, nipple soreness,
nipple cracking, frustration with breastfeeding, and general anxiety.
These problems are common and can be addressed, but they often add
much stress to a new mother. Check out Breastfeeding For Dummies
(Wiley) for more information about these problems.
 Working women: The obstacles here aren’t insurmountable! Yes, breast-
feeding is more complicated and time consuming when mothers go back
to work, but it can be done. Moms who’re strictly feeding breast milk
want to pump fresh milk daily before leaving for work. This milk can be
used throughout the day to feed with a bottle while the breastfeeding
mother is away. Breast milk also freezes well.
 Privacy: When new mothers are out and about, breastfeeding can be diffi-
cult for conservative moms who like privacy. Mom may want to bring a
blanket along so that she can cover herself when breastfeeding in public.
 A carefully monitored diet: Simply put, mothers need to watch what
they eat. Consumed nutrients pass from the mother to the infant
through breastfeeding. Because this sharing occurs, certain foods that
moms enjoy, such as chocolate, may give babies digestive problems.
Some food groups may take a trial-and-error period to see how they
affect a particular infant. Generally, breastfeeding women should avoid
strong or acidic foods as well as caffeine and alcohol. See “Tackling food
intolerance,” later in this chapter, for more detailed information.
 Health problems: If a mother has a pre-existing health problem, she can
still breastfeed. However, breastfeeding puts an extra demand on the
mother’s body, so the mother needs to take extra care of herself. Talk to
a doctor about health conditions and concerns about breastfeeding.
In light of these obstacles, it’s important to remember that breastfeeding is
overwhelmingly the best choice for the baby. So, it’s important to consider
the obstacles and determine a plan of with a doctor if any of the problems
seem insurmountable.
Discovering the good and bad in formula
Baby formula came on the scene in the late 1930s and was a necessary item for
a time of war when so many women were working. Afterwards, formula manu-
facturers continued to promote formula’s importance and many benefits.
68
Part II: From Womb to Highchair: The First 12 Months 

But is formula good? Formula is better now than it ever has been. Companies
know more about the composition of breast milk and are better able to copy
it than ever before. The simple reality, though, is that breast milk is far better
for your infant, and compelling nutritional reasons to choose formula over
breast milk don’t exist. In fact, most companies that produce formula tell 
parents upfront that breast milk is best.
With that said, we don’t want to freak new parents out if they’ve chosen for-
mula for their infant, whether by necessity or preference. So take heart — 
formula does have outside benefits:
 Flexibility: Hands down, probably the greatest benefit of formula is
flexibility — enabling parents to feed their baby anywhere without the
mother having to arrange for privacy. And the breastfeeding woman isn’t
the only person who can feed the infant.
 Ease: Breastfeeding is often difficult and challenging at first. Many women
have problems with milk coming down as well as cracked and sore nip-
ples. In this light, formula feeding is easier and usually involves fewer
complications (see “Facing the challenges of breastfeeding,” earlier in
this chapter).
 Portion control: With formula feeding, you can see how much your baby
eats, and you know whether he’s eaten enough. With breastfeeding, you
have to make sure that your baby is wetting enough diapers, which is
your evidence of enough food. This isn’t a major breastfeeding obstacle,
but with formula, you simply have a measurement of how much your
baby has eaten.
Formula feeding has negative aspects, too. Here are the most compelling
cons that have to do with choosing formula over breast milk:
 Nutrition: Hands down, breast milk is better. Your baby survives and
thrives on formula, but breast milk just has more components that lead
to a healthy baby.
 Slow digestion: Formula can be slower for your baby to digest, and
researchers say that this factor is actually negative because it’s harder
on the baby’s digestive system.
 Possible allergies: Because formula is made from cow’s milk, your baby
may have an allergic reaction to it. Soy formula is an acceptable alterna-
tive, but your baby will still have to feel the discomfort of the allergy
before you know the culprit.
 Cost: Because breast milk comes from the mother’s body, it’s free.
Formula is expensive. During the first year of the newborn’s life, expect
the formula expense alone to run around $1,500. That’s a lot of milk
money!

Gauging the Amount Based 
on the Feeding Method
Regardless of whether your family decides that breastfeeding or formula
feeding is best, you still need to make sure that your baby is getting enough
milk. This need is often stressful for new parents. After all, babies aren’t very
good at saying, “Hey, I’m hungry.” So in this section, we provide some specific
tricks and tactics that you can put in place that help you make sure that your
new baby is getting what she needs in terms of nutrition.
You can’t overfeed a baby — she’ll stop eating when she’s had enough — but
you can underfeed. The best rule of thumb of feeding is to let your infant eat
until she’s no longer interested. This method keeps your baby full, and you
won’t have to worry if your little darling is getting enough.
Measuring milk when baby’s latched on
Because a breastfeeding mother can’t see or measure the amount of milk the
baby is taking in (unless Mommy pumps, of course), you need to know how
to gauge amounts if you go this route. Not to worry, though, there are ways
you can get around this issue.
The following bulleted list shows you what to look for to ensure that your
baby is eating enough during the first four months of her life.
 0 to 3 days old: Because it’s new to both Baby and Mom, your baby (and
you, if you’re Mommy) may have problems nursing during this time, so
don’t fret if you do. Remember to stay calm and patient and ask for help.
Here’s what to expect:
• The baby breastfeeds during this time but is receiving colostrum
instead of milk. Colostrum is nutritional, and its production is
normal (see the section “Sheer goodness from Day One: Colostrum,”
earlier in this chapter, for more on colostrum).
• Baby’s first bowel movements (called meconium) will be dark
green to black in color.
 3 days to 4 weeks old: The diaper is the best gauge to tell if your baby is
eating enough at this stage, so keep a journal each day. Here’s what to
look for:
• After the colostrum passes and the breasts start producing milk,
expect your baby to have five to six wet diapers during a 24-hour
period.
70
Part II: From Womb to Highchair: The First 12 Months 

• Your baby passes three to five yellow stools per day. The stools
darken after a few more days.
• The baby is satisfied when feeding (in fact, he may have trouble
staying awake).
• Mommy’s breasts seem softer after feeding and not as full.
 1 to 2 months old: At this stage, your baby eats more regularly.
• A common pattern of eating every few hours starts to form — 
typically 10 to 12 feedings every 24 hours.
• Continue to keep a close eye on the number of wet diapers per day
(five to six in 24 hours).
• Your hungry baby becomes upset before feeding, including crying
with clenched fingers. As he feeds, he relaxes and seems satisfied.
Tickle your baby on the chin to keep him from falling asleep during
feeding.
• Feeding lasts for about eight minutes on each breast, but let the
baby determine when he’s full. Never breastfeed by the clock!
 2 to 4 months old: Your baby continues on a regular eating pattern at
this age.
• Expect him to gain weight at a pace of roughly 4 to 8 ounces per
week.
• Stools are reduced and Baby may even go several days without
passing a stool. Breast milk is tailor-made for your baby, so when
he feeds, he absorbs most of the nutrition, so there’s little waste.
Counting fluid ounces: The bottle method
One of the advantages of formula is that you always know how much your
baby is drinking. You won’t have to worry about checking the number of wet
diapers each day (although checking isn’t always a bad idea). Likewise, you
can see how much Baby is drinking if you pump breast milk into a bottle.
Because most moms who do so generally alternate between breast and
bottle, you won’t need to gauge the amount, because the total measured
ounces per day are only part of the equation. For that reason, we devote this
section to measuring formula.
In order to keep track of how much formula your 0- to 4-month-old should
drink, refer to Table 4-1.

Never put an infant to bed with a bottle or expect him to hold the bottle for
feeding, even if he’s able to do so. Hold him when you feed to avoid choking
and unnecessary ear infections from fluid getting in the ear canal.
Detecting Early Digestive Problems 
and Intolerances
It’s not unusual for babies from 0 to 4 months old to have digestive problems
and possibly intolerances, especially to formula. These kinds of problems are
rare in breastfed babies. 
72
Part II: From Womb to Highchair: The First 12 Months 
“Hey you, I’m hungry!”
It would be so much easier if your baby could
simply tell you what she needs. Yet, until your
baby turns into a toddler and develops language
skills, you need to depend on baby talk, which
is basically body language that tells you about
your baby’s hunger. Keep these common behav-
iors and issues in mind:
 Watch for sucking or chewing on hands.
 Notice when your baby is opening his
mouth and trying to find the breast when
you hold him.
 Feed your baby at the first signs of hunger.
If you wait, he’ll become more upset and
will often have difficulty calming down
enough to latch on. Your baby will cry loudly
and arch his back, even when you try to
feed. You’ll need to talk and sing to your
baby and try to get him to calm down
enough to eat.
 As your baby eats, you’ll notice that his
body relaxes and he becomes calm. After
eating, your baby is likely to fall asleep from
satisfaction!

Keep in mind that a new baby’s digestive system is immature, so time has to
work out these issues. As we say time and again throughout this book, if you
have concerns about how your baby is eating, be sure to mention them to
your healthcare professional.
So, how can you know if your baby is having digestive problems and intoler-
ances? And what can you do? The following information points you in the
right direction.
Tackling food intolerance
You often hear the term food allergy thrown around when talking about young
babies, but in truth, a baby is much more likely to suffer from food intoler-
ance, which affects the digestive track (see Chapter 13 for a thorough discus-
sion of the two terms). Because of food intolerances, some babies have a
difficult time drinking formula because it’s made from cow’s milk, which is
harder to digest than breast milk. If you think that your baby has an issue
with regular formula, talk to your pediatrician about switching to a soy for-
mula. How can you tell? The two most common signs are
 Digestive problems, characterized by diarrhea and excessive gas
 Crying excessively, especially after eating
If you’re breastfeeding and your baby seems intolerant to your milk, you may
be eating something that causes the digestive issue (don’t forget that every-
thing you eat is passed through you to your baby through breastfeeding).
Watch your intake carefully and try to remove the following items from your
diet (or at least consume them in moderation):
 Acidic foods: Avoid acidic fruit and foods with excessive peppers or
spices.
 Caffeine: This category includes not only coffee but also tea and soft
drinks.
 Chocolate: This rich treat is often too much for your baby to handle.
 Dairy: Diary has proteins that can build up your baby’s intestinal track
and create painful gas. Remove the dairy and see if things improve.
 Gassy foods: Broccoli, beans, and other high-fiber foods can pass the
“gassy” effect onto your baby.
 Spicy foods: You may love your lasagne with the extra spicy sausage,
but your baby will pay for it later.
If you’re breastfeeding and anticipate a food binge on any of the previous
items, pump several servings of breast milk before eating the food. That way
your baby doesn’t suffer the consequences.
73
Chapter 4: Welcome to the World, Baby! The First Four Months

Comforting colic
You’ll hear the word colic quite a bit during the first two months of your
baby’s life. Colic is generally defined as crying spells that last more than two
hours. Colic has been typically blamed on the baby’s immature digestive
system. However, recent research suggests that colic is really about the
baby’s immature nervous system, which prevents him from being able to
filter out noise and distractions within the environment. This noise overloads
your baby’s nervous system until the nerves have more time to mature. If you
have a colicky baby, try these helpful tricks:
 Turn on white noise: a vacuum, a fan, or static from the television.
Sometimes the drone of these noises seems to calm a baby.
 Take the baby outside (assuming the weather is good). The sudden
change of scenery and sound often helps the baby calm down.
 If you’re breastfeeding, try eliminating all dairy products from your diet.
A simple case of bad gas may be the culprit (see the preceding section
for more on foods that cause digestive problems).
Combating reflux
All babies spit up and vomit; however, some babies seem to have a terrible
time with it on a regular basis (which makes everything in your house and
car have a nice sour milk smell). Spitting up and vomiting tend to reduce over
time, but if your baby has reflux (technically called gastroesophageal reflux
disease), you’ll need some medical help. Note that breastfed babies usually
don’t have reflux, and the condition has a tendency to be overdiagnosed in
all infants. If your baby seems to spit up after every feeding, you should at
least mention it to your baby’s pediatrician. The good news: Most babies out-
grow reflux. (Check out Chapter 13 for more in-depth information.)
Reflux occurs when the ring of muscle around the stomach doesn’t close
properly. Stomach acid leaks back into the esophagus and causes heartburn,
leading to a very irritated baby.
Nursing or feeding your baby in a more upright position and sitting her up for
30 minutes after feeding often alleviates immediate reflux issues.

Enter Solid Foods: 4 to 6 Months
In This Chapter
 Introducing solids into your baby’s diet
 Providing tips and hints on how to feed your infant
 Following the suggested cereal and puree recipes
U
p until now, your baby’s primary nutrition
has been breast milk or formula and will
continue to be for some time. After your baby
passes the 4-month mark (or shortly thereafter),
you need to begin introducing solid foods. The ini-
tial solids that you feed your baby provide addi-
tional nutrition and bulk to your baby’s diet. Of
course, this transition takes quite a bit of time, so
you need to feed go-between foods — not really
solids, but not really liquids, but instead a mixture
of the two (meaning we’re not talking steak —
think mush).
Most 4- to 6-month-olds are ready to begin eating solid foods, and in this
chapter, we address your questions and give you some healthy, homemade
options for welcoming your baby to the world of solids.
Moving Your Baby to Solid Foods
Naturally, you may get a lot of conflicting advice, such as Aunt Wanda’s per-
sistent instructions to start feeding your baby table food at 2 months old, but
the age actually differs. You may wonder when you should begin introducing
solid foods and what you should serve. Healthcare professionals overwhelm-
ingly recommend that your baby’s first food be rice cereal, which you can
start serving around your baby’s fourth month (if you’re exclusively breast-
feeding, you can wait until your child is six months of age).

Rice cereal contains a starting nutritional base of carbohydrates, and like
other infant cereals, is fortified with iron, which is important for your baby’s
brain development. Additionally, rice cereal is easy to digest, which is very
important during these early months.
As your baby adjusts to the new taste and texture of rice cereal, slowly intro-
duce other cereals (such as barley and oatmeal after several weeks of rice
cereal) and basic veggie purees. It’s okay to begin feeding some fruit purees
before your baby reaches her seventh month, but you may find that your
child starts to love the sweet taste of the fruit and won’t want anything else.
With that addiction in mind, we recommend the cereal and basic veggie
purees in this chapter, and try to hold off on the fruit until the latter part of
the sixth month (you can find plenty of fruit puree recipes in Chapter 6).
So what do you feed, how much, and when? These important questions are
answered in the following sections.
Knowing when to start
What are the signs that your baby is ready to begin eating cereal? Watch for
these three signs:
 Your baby puts things in his mouth.
 Your baby can easily hold his head up on his own.
 Your baby seems interested in food when someone else is eating.
If you’re saying “Yes, yes, yes” to the preceding bullets, then your baby 
can begin rice cereal during month four. However, what if your baby doesn’t
have these signs? In this case, wait a bit longer while your infant grows and
develops.
The fourth month is just an average benchmark and doesn’t mean that
there’s a problem if your baby isn’t quite ready for solids. Naturally, if you
have questions or concerns about your baby’s development, you should
check with your pediatrician. If your baby was born prematurely, he may
develop more slowly, so check with your baby’s doctor instead of spending
time worrying and biting your nails.
If your baby seems to have all the readiness signs, but she only seems to
push the cereal back out of her mouth instead of swallowing any, she may
have a normal tongue-thrust reflex. This thrusting reflex is a normal condition
that helps a baby to nurse.
76
Part II: From Womb to Highchair: The First 12 Months 

Test your infant’s reflex by touching your baby’s lips with a spoon or your
finger. If her tongue comes out of her mouth every time, she still has the
reflex. Wait a week or so and try again. She’ll outgrow this reflex in time and
begin swallowing as you feed her.
Don’t think that if your baby pushes the spoon out of her mouth on the first
try that you should give up. Infants only know about suckling and have to
learn to use the tongue to move solids from the front to the back of the
mouth. This process takes time, and your first few tries of feeding cereal 
may end with most of the food down the front of your baby’s bib, so don’t 
get discouraged.
Introducing solids: Month 4
When you’re ready to introduce cereal, you’re likely to have some questions,
such as when to feed your baby, how much, and how often. These questions
are all important, and we show you what to do in this section.
When to feed
As you introduce rice cereal, you’ll only feed the cereal once a day. You can
choose whenever is best for your schedule; however, consider feeding rice
cereal along with the final bottle or breastfeeding of the evening. Many advan-
tages to this technique will start popping up:
 The cereal naturally helps your baby start to sleep longer.
• Cereal is denser.
• Dense foods keep your baby fuller longer.
 Solids help slowly decrease the number of bottle or breast feedings.
• Night feedings decrease first.
• You get more uninterrupted sleep.
How much to feed
Generally, you begin with only a tablespoon of cereal mixed with formula or
breast milk until the mixture is very thin. Then you simply feed your baby
small bites on a baby spoon. When you start trying purees, 2 tablespoons is
plenty during the 4-month starting range.
Keep in mind that your baby has to discover how to eat solid foods — all
your baby has known is liquid, so mastering this process takes some time.
77
Chapter 5: Enter Solid Foods: 4 to 6 Months

How to feed a 4-month-old
Open mouth, insert food, chew, and swallow. It sounds simple enough —
maybe for older kids and adults. But remember that your baby has to dis-
cover how to chew and swallow. After all, swallowing liquids is a lot different
than swallowing solids. Your baby won’t naturally eat cereal without some
practice.
As you’re getting ready to feed your baby, follow these few steps to get on the
right track:
1. Gather your props.
Decide where — such as a car seat or bouncy seat — you’re going to
feed your baby for the first time.
• Make sure that your baby is inclined.
• Don’t place your infant in a highchair because he can’t fully sup-
port the weight of his head.
• Think of the angle of a baby car seat, and you’ll be in good shape.
2. Make sure that the spoon and bowl are sterilized.
Sterilization eliminates germs found on feeding equipment and keeps
your baby healthy.
3. Get a good large bib and a towel.
Feeding can be a messy job!
4. Mix the cereal and serve it at room temperature.
Make sure to taste the cereal for proper temperature before serving.
Place a spoonful of the cereal against your lips. If the cereal is too hot for
your lips, it’s definitely too hot for your baby’s sensitive mouth.
5. Place a small bit of cereal (about 1⁄4 spoonful) in your baby’s mouth.
Allow your baby to open his mouth for the spoon just as he would a
bottle nipple or the breast. Don’t force the spoon into your baby’s
mouth. Touch the spoon to his lips and he should open his mouth.
Your baby may push most of the food back out of his mouth and try to
suck on the spoon. These behaviors are normal. Repeat this process 
several times and then call it a day.
6. Repeat the whole process the next day.
Don’t get discouraged. Soon enough, your child understands how to
swallow the cereal, and he’ll like it and want more.
78
Part II: From Womb to Highchair: The First 12 Months 

Don’t try to feed cereal to your baby when he’s full, but make sure that he’s
not famished either! If he’s full, he won’t have any interest in trying a new
cereal. If he’s starving, he’ll just get aggravated because he wants the bottle
or breast, and he wants it now! Some parents find it helpful to alternate the
bottle or breast between bites of cereal to help the baby stay interested.
After your baby gets more practice with the new food and you offer it at a
specific time of day, he’ll get used to the routine.
As you get ready to feed your 4-month-old, keep a few safety tips in mind at
all times:
 Use a baby spoon. They’re covered with rubber to protect your child’s
gums and they’re small enough to fit in your baby’s mouth. Never use a
regular adult-size spoon to feed a baby.
 Feed your baby in an upright eating position. Sitting up helps your
baby’s swallowing reflex and prevents the choking hazard that naturally
comes if your baby is lying down after eating.
 Don’t feed cereal from a bottle. Grandma may suggest feeding this way
by cutting larger holes in the nipple of the bottle to feed solids. But
using this feeding method presents a choking hazard because your baby
may get too much cereal in her mouth at once.
Feed cereal only with a spoon. (And if you see Grandma with a pair of
scissors at your house, check your bottle nipples for extra holes and
hide them where she’ll never think to look.)
 Don’t rush. This process is a lot for your baby to take in, so take your
time. Rushing also presents a choking possibility because of too much
food in the baby’s mouth.
 Don’t keep uneaten portions of cereal or other purees. The saliva from
your baby’s mouth will get into the puree as you scoop each bite of
cereal. Bacteria can grow in the cereal. Whatever isn’t eaten from the
bowl that you’re using to feed should go directly in the trash or garbage
disposal.
Storing portions of cereal or puree in single servings — like freezing
them in ice cube trays with lids — helps reduce waste. You’ll use only
what you need at the time of feeding and have less to throw out if your
baby doesn’t eat all his food.
Enter cereal variety and veggies: Month 5
As your baby rapidly grows, you’re still feeding rice cereal but as you move
into month five, and if your baby is doing well eating the cereal, shake things
79
Chapter 5: Enter Solid Foods: 4 to 6 Months

up a bit and begin adding other cereal options and a few veggies. As an
excited parent who wants to cook for your baby, you can start putting some
of your pureeing skills to work.
Keep an eye out for any food allergies that may crop up. Because you need to
watch out for food allergies, introduce a new food only every week or so (you
should wait at least five days), and then watch and make sure that your baby
doesn’t have a reaction to that food. Look for the following symptoms that
may indicate a food allergy:
 Excessive crankiness
 Diarrhea
 Excessive bloating
 Gas
 Rash around the mouth
If you expect an allergy, remove the last food you tried, and don’t give it again
for a few weeks. (Head over to Chapter 13 for an in-depth discussion about
food allergies and intolerances, and use the food log in Appendix B to keep
track of all the new foods you introduce to your youngster and how she
reacts to them.)
When and what to feed
Continue with the early evening feeding as you’ve been doing, but add a
lunch or late morning time to your schedule. This added feeding spaces out
the meals adequately. When you try a new food, introduce it only during the
lunch meal. This method gives you adequate time to watch your baby and
make sure that he can tolerate the new food.
Don’t get overly excited about your baby’s newfound love of solid foods. Your
baby isn’t ready for any kind of chunky baby food. Stick with the plain veggie
purees and cereals in this chapter. Start with orange and yellow veggies and
then move on to green veggies after a few weeks. These foods are all your
baby needs at this point.
If your baby seems to reject a veggie (some have a stronger taste than others),
consider mixing the vegetable with a bit of the cereal. Your baby recognizes
the texture of the cereal and then adjusts to the new taste combination.
Resist the urge to start feeding your baby items from the dinner table — no
sweets, no soda, or anything like that. You can have more problems with pin-
pointing food allergies this way, and your child may want sweet foods instead
of veggies. Also, never give your baby honey. Honey may contain spores that
cause botulism. It’s safe after your baby turns 1 year old, but never give it
before then.

How much to feed
Keep in mind that your little one may eat more or less at each meal and
eating isn’t an exact science. As she moves through month 5, her appetite
continues to grow, but don’t get in the habit of trying to measure food exactly
and expecting your baby to eat all of every food you feed her. Your baby will
grow to a few teaspoons of different foods at each feeding, but this process
takes time. As long as your baby is gaining weight and seems happy, don’t
overthink the amount. Your baby lets you know when she’s hungry and if she
wants more.
On with the veggie introductions: Month 6
At the age of 6 months, most babies become more interested in other foods.
However, we should say up-front that children develop at their own pace, so
don’t think that six months is a marker for certain behavior — more or less
time may need to be devoted to your child’s eating habits, so don’t let this
stress you out.
Continuing with more of the same . . . and then some
During the sixth month, you’ll simply continue what you started in month 5.
 Continue adding new foods — about one new food every week or so —
from the recipes in this chapter, always being mindful of food allergy
symptoms.
 Give your baby some cereal in the morning, a lunch consisting of veggie
purees, and a dinner with more veggies and some additional cereal.
 Offer your child only pureed veggies. Although fruit is tempting, your
child may decide that fruit is more interesting and automatically start
rejecting vegetables.
 Continue making your baby’s cereal with formula or breast milk. Your
baby shouldn’t have cow’s milk until she’s 1. See Chapter 4 for more
information on milk.

Chapter 5: Enter Solid Foods: 4 to 6 Months
Relishing the highchair while you cook
The highchair is a great tool to help you with
your little one when you create meals. You can
put your baby in his highchair, recline the seat
a bit for extra head support, and pull the chair
up close to you as you work (but away from the
stove). This process helps you keep an eye on
your baby and gives you a chance to interact as
you cook. Explain the steps of cooking as you go
along. Show your tyke the tomato, for example.
Let him feel it, smell it, and explain the color.
After all, children are never too young to start
learning.

Your baby is likely to eat several tablespoons of food per meal at this point,
and you can gauge how much she wants based on her response. Don’t expect
your baby to be on autopilot; she’ll eat more at some meals and less at others.
As solids are continuing to be fed, you may be wondering, “How much for-
mula or breast milk should my baby have each day?” As a general rule, feed 
4 to 5 servings a day, totally 24 to 32 ounces. With this amount of milk and
the new solids you’re adding, your baby should be happy and growing at a
rapid rate.
You should still offer the breast and bottle on demand at this point, because
your baby may go through rapid growth spurts, requiring more calories and
energy. Naturally, a feeding schedule will develop, but if your baby is hungry,
feed her!
Adding juice to the repertoire
Now is a good time to start introducing your baby to apple or pear juice.
Both of these juices are healthy and mild, making them easy to digest. Many
combo juices — such as orange-pineapple juice — are on the market, but
your baby doesn’t need these. In fact, children shouldn’t have any citrus fruit
at this age because these types of juices are too harsh for your little one’s
digestive system.
As you’re thinking about introducing juice, don’t forget about water. As a
newborn, your baby gets all the water he needs from breast milk or formula.
But as he grows and starts eating solids, give him water periodically in his
bottle. Just like in your diet, water is important to keep him hydrated (and 
to keep him from drinking too much juice, which has a lot of sugar).
At 6 months old, your child needs the extra nutrition and vitamin C that
apple or pear juice provides. In fact, we recommend that you buy pure juice
for children less than one year of age because it’s fortified with vitamin C.
You can also buy infant juice at the store. Serve 4 ounces each day and your
child gets all the vitamin C he needs — it’s like a healthy booster shot.
Pure juice doesn’t mean homemade juice in this case. Juice made at home
with a juicer doesn’t contain enough vitamin C for your infant. Stick to store-
bought juice with the label that says “fortified with vitamin C.”
When you first start serving juice to your munchkin, dilute the juice with
water. Two ounces of juice to 2 ounces of water is a good start. If you start 
off with straight juice, your baby will likely get a stomachache and diarrhea.
Remember, his little digestive system is still adjusting to all these new foods.
82
Part II: From Womb to Highchair: The First 12 Months 

Introduce the sippy cup (see Chapter 3 for more information about sippy
cups) as you introduce juice. This initiation helps you wean your baby off the
bottle a few months down the road.
Your Baby’s First “Real” Food:
Homemade Cereals
Even parents who’re determined to prepare baby meals often start out with
store bought cereal for one simple reason: It’s well made and has additional
vitamins and iron added, which your baby needs. We recommend a combina-
tion of store bought cereal and your own homemade varieties from the
recipes you find in this chapter.
Wheat is the most common allergen of any grain, so it’s best to leave wheat
out of the diet until your baby is a bit older. In fact, allergens are exactly why
you should avoid table foods because every little unplanned morsel may con-
tain foods that have common allergy products. You’ll often find wheat in such
common items as:
 Many types of crackers
 Graham crackers
 Bran
 Cake flour
 Farina (bland-tasting flour or meal)
 Malt
 Semolina
Stick with the tried-and-true cereals in this chapter (they don’t contain wheat
products).
Freeze any of these cereals or purees in a covered ice cube tray for a month,
and simply remove and thaw for use. However, freezing freshly made cereals
often gives them a rubbery texture when you thaw them. Experiment with
freezing, but in many cases, parents choose to simply grind the grains, store
them in an airtight container, then simply make a new batch of cereal as
needed.
83
Chapter 5: Enter Solid Foods: 4 to 6 Months

T Rice Cereal
When your baby is ready, single-ingredient baby cereals (like rice cereal) make a perfect
introduction because they’re easy to digest and provide the iron your baby needs.
Serve only rice cereal during the first few weeks of starting solids before adding any-
thing else. This process gives your baby time to understand eating cereal and allows his
digestive system time to adjust. Naturally, you can purchase dry rice cereal for infants
at your local supermarket, but you can also make your own following this recipe. Brown
rice has more nutrition than white, so use brown rice as the recipe suggests. This recipe
makes two cups of cereal, which is much more than you need at one feeding, but you
can freeze the rest for later use.
Preparation time: 20 minutes
Yield: 2 cups
84
Part II: From Womb to Highchair: The First 12 Months 
1⁄4 cup brown rice
1 cup water
1 In a food processor, grind the rice into a fine powder. Mix the rice and water in a small
saucepan and bring the mixture to a boil.
2 Simmer for 10 minutes, whisking constantly.
3 Cool the mixture slightly and add 3 tablespoons of breast milk or mixed formula for a
thin consistency. Add more breast milk or formula if the mixture is too thick. Serve
warm — be sure to check the temperature.
T Barley Cereal
After your baby adjusts to rice cereal, barley cereal is a good addition to your food arse-
nal. Barley cereal, like brown rice, provides complex carbohydrates for energy but is
also easy to digest. Here’s a quick, homemade recipe. Because this recipe makes 2 cups,
freeze the extra cereal for later use.
Preparation time: 20 minutes
Yield: 2 cups
1⁄4 cup barley
1 cup water

1 In a food processor, grind the barley into a fine powder. Mix the barley and water in a
small saucepan and bring the mixture to a boil.
2 Simmer for 10 minutes, whisking constantly.
3 Cool the mixture slightly and add 3 tablespoons of breast milk or mixed formula for a
thin consistency, and add more breast milk or formula as needed. Serve warm — be
sure to check the temperature.
T Oatmeal Cereal
Oatmeal cereal is also a good addition as your baby continues to move toward solids.
Oatmeal’s nutrition provides your baby with plenty of carbs. Keep in mind that you can
freeze the extra and use it later.
Preparation time: 20 minutes
Yield: 2 cups
85
Chapter 5: Enter Solid Foods: 4 to 6 Months
1⁄4 cup rolled oats
3⁄4 cup water
1 In a food processor, grind the oats into a fine powder.
2 In a small saucepan, heat the water and add the oat powder, mixing constantly to
reduce lumps. Bring the mixture to a boil. Simmer for 5 minutes, whisking constantly.
3 Cool the mixture slightly and add 3 tablespoons of breast milk or mixed formula for a
thin consistency. Feel free to add more breast milk or formula if needed. Serve warm —
be sure to check the temperature.

T Mixed-Grain Cereal
Try this mixed-grain cereal as an additional cereal to the single grains you’ve given your
baby so far. Offer mixed cereal only after your baby has sampled all the single-grain
cereals and you’re sure that an allergic reaction doesn’t exist. You can freeze the extra
cereal that is left from this recipe for later use.
Preparation time: 25 minutes
Yield: 2 cups
86
Part II: From Womb to Highchair: The First 12 Months 
2 tablespoons barley
2 tablespoons rice
2 tablespoons rolled oats
1 cup water
1 In a food processor, grind the grains into a fine powder. You may need to grind a bit
longer to make sure that the rice grinds to a powder. Consider using a coffee grinder (if
the grinder hasn’t been previously used to grind coffee, nuts, or spices).
2 Mix the grains and water in a small saucepan and bring the mixture to a boil. Simmer for
15 minutes, whisking constantly.
3 Cool the mixture slightly and add 3 tablespoons of breast milk or mixed formula. This
addition helps your baby adjust to the new texture and taste. Serve warm — be sure to
check the temperature.
Solids Part 2: A Rainbow 
of Pureed Veggies
As your baby grows and adjusts to the texture of cereal, you can begin slowly
adding some orange and yellow veggies (as well as a few green veggies) to
your baby’s diet. The veggie purees you’ll find in this section are all easy to
digest, so they’re perfect for your baby’s immature digestive system.
As you get ready to puree veggies, keep in mind that you want the puree to
be thin. Even though your baby is eating cereal, she still needs time to adjust
to other new foods as well.

87
Chapter 5: Enter Solid Foods: 4 to 6 Months
1 medium yellow squash
Water as needed
1 Peel the squash with a vegetable peeler or sharp paring knife. Cut the squash into small
slices.
2 Steam the slices until completely tender, about 5 minutes.
3 Puree the squash by using a food processor, adding water as necessary to get a thin
puree. Serve warm.
T Fresh Carrot Puree
Carrots are another great food for 4- to 6-month-olds because they’re chock-full of vita-
mins for your little tyke. Freeze the leftover puree for later use, too.
Preparation time: 10 minutes
Yield: 1⁄2 cup
1 medium carrot
Water as needed
1 Rinse the peeled carrot, cut it in half, and boil it for 5 minutes or until soft.
2 Cut the carrot in small pieces and then puree it in a food processor. Serve warm. If the
puree seems a bit too dry, add a teaspoon of water.
T Summer Squash Puree
Squash is a great food for 4- to 6-month-olds because squash is healthy and easy to
digest. As a “yellow” veggie, it’s perfect for your child, providing nutrition and easy
digestion. You can freeze the leftovers in this recipe for later use.
Preparation time: 10 minutes
Tools: Steamer
Yield: 3⁄4 cup

T Creamy Corn Puree
This recipe can be helpful if your child resists eating solids. The breast milk or formula
makes the taste familiar to your infant. This addition helps your baby start to overcome
the issue of texture because the taste is essentially the same. You’ll have some leftover
puree, so feel free to freeze it for later use.
Preparation time: 20 minutes
Yield: 1⁄2 cup
88
Part II: From Womb to Highchair: The First 12 Months 
1⁄4 cup frozen corn kernels
1⁄4 cup breast milk or formula
1 Cook the corn according to the package directions and drain the water.
2 Puree the corn in a food processor until creamy.
3 Mix the puree with the breast milk or formula and serve warm.
T Winter Squash Puree
Along with summer squash, you can also feed butternut or acorn squash as a puree.
This type of squash takes a bit longer to prepare so we’ve given you a larger yield for
your work, but it’s a healthy food for your baby so it’s well worth the effort. And, for
added benefit, you can freeze the leftovers for later use.
Preparation time: 20 minutes
Cooking time: 40 minutes
Yield: 2 cups
1 acorn or butternut squash
Water as needed
1 Preheat the oven to 400 degrees.
2 Cut the squash in half and scoop out all the seeds.

3 Put an inch of water in a baking pan and place the squash halves cut-side down in the
pan. While baking, check the water and make sure that it stays at an inch.
4 Bake the squash for 40 minutes or until the skin puckers and the squash is soft.
5 Remove the pan from the oven, remove the squash from the pan, and let it cool for 10 to
15 minutes. Scoop out the squash meat. Puree the squash and add water as necessary
to thin the puree. Serve warm.
T Potato Puree
As with the other purees, this one is easily digestible (thanks to the potato) and can be
introduced — in pureed form — during the fourth month of life and up to 6 months. The
leftovers are freezable for later use.
Preparation time: 50 minutes
Yield: 2 cups
89
Chapter 5: Enter Solid Foods: 4 to 6 Months
1 potato
Water or breast milk as needed
1 Peel the potato and cook it in a saucepan of boiling water for 25 minutes or until soft. To
speed up the process, cut the potato into cubes and cook them for 10 minutes or until
soft.
2 Press the potato through a strainer to break it up and catch any hard lumps (which you
discard) and then puree, adding water, breast milk, or formula to form a thin puree.
Serve warm.

T Fresh Sweet Potato Puree
Pure sweet potato and nothing else in this puree! Sweet potatoes are a nutrient-dense
food. You can freeze the leftovers and use them later.
Preparation time: 15 minutes
Yield: 1 cup
90
Part II: From Womb to Highchair: The First 12 Months 
1 medium sweet potato
Water as needed
1 Wash and scrub the sweet potato with cold water. Peel and quarter the sweet potato.
2 Bring a pot of water to a boil, and then place the sweet potato quarters in the boiling
water. Return the water to boiling, reduce the heat to medium, and cover for 15 minutes
until the potato is tender.
3 Puree the sweet potato until smooth and add a teaspoon of water if necessary for con-
sistency. Serve warm.
Tip: Because sweet potatoes have a different taste than other veggies, you can mix a bit of
breast milk or formula with this puree, which can help it have a more familiar taste for
your baby.
T Oatmeal and Potato Puree
You may find that blending veggies in with cereal makes feeding time easier. After all,
your baby is already familiar with the texture of cereal, so mixing the two can help you
introduce new veggies. This recipe makes more than you need in one feeding, so feel
free to freeze the leftovers.
Preparation Time: 50 minutes
Yield: 2 cups
1 potato
1⁄4 cup rolled oats
1 cup water
1 Peel the potato and boil it in a saucepan of water for 25 minutes or until soft. You can
also reduce cooking time by cutting the potato into cubes and boiling them for 10 min-
utes or until soft.

2 Press the potato through a strainer to catch any hard lumps, and discard the hard
pieces.
3 In a food processor, puree the oatmeal into a fine powder. Heat the water and then mix
the oatmeal and water in a medium saucepan and bring the mixture to a boil. Reduce
the heat and simmer on medium heat for 10 minutes.
4 Add the potatoes and mix well. If you need to, remove the mixture from the heat and
puree a bit more. Add water as necessary for a thin puree. Serve warm.
T Green Bean Puree
This fresh green bean puree is a great addition to your baby’s meals during the 4 to 6
month age range. Green beans are easy to digest and aren’t overwhelming in taste like
some veggies. You’ll make more of this recipe than you need, so feel free to freeze the
leftovers and use them later.
Preparation time: 10 minutes
Tools: Vegetable steamer
Yield: 3⁄4 cup
91
Chapter 5: Enter Solid Foods: 4 to 6 Months
1 cup green beans
Water as needed
1 Cut the tips off each end of fresh green beans and wash well. If you’re using frozen green
beans, cook the beans according to the package directions and proceed to Step 3.
2 Place the beans in a steamer and steam until tender, about 7 minutes.
3 Puree the beans in a food processor, adding water as necessary until the puree is thin.
Serve warm.

T Mixed Greens Puree
This mixed greens recipe provides the perfect balance of green veggies. This recipe
makes 2 cups of puree, which is more than the other recipes. However, because you’re
creating a mixture of greens, it’s easier to puree a larger amount and freeze the leftovers
for additional meals later.
Preparation time: 10 minutes
Yield: 2 cups
92
Part II: From Womb to Highchair: The First 12 Months 
1⁄3 cup green beans
1⁄3 cup peas
1⁄3 cup finely sliced zucchini
1 cup water
1 In a small saucepan, place the veggies and add enough water just to cover the 
vegetables.
2 Cook the vegetables on medium heat until tender, reserving the water.
3 Puree the vegetables in a blender or food processor, adding the reserved water from the
vegetables until the mixture is thin. Serve warm.

Your baby is now at least 6 months old and has
turned into a wiggling, moving child. During
these early days, your baby’s diet changes, too.
Milk continues to be your baby’s main drink, but
water also becomes an important source of hydra-
tion. You’ll also notice that your child is becoming
increasingly interested in what you’re eating and
drinking as well.
In this chapter, you find out about your baby’s
nutritional needs for 6 months up to 1 year of age
and explore some healthy recipes you can start
introducing into your baby’s diet.
It’s important to note, however, that we move from
purees to chunkier foods in this chapter. This pro-
gression is natural as your baby grows, but you
may find that some of the dishes in this chapter
aren’t appropriate for your 6- to 7-month-old
because they require more chewing. If your baby
isn’t quite ready to move on at this age, continue
serving him the purees we discuss in Chapter 5
until he’s ready.

you introduce new foods to your infant, but just remember that moving from
purees to chunky foods should be gradual, so hold your horses.
Moving On to Bigger and Better Foods
As your child moves toward the seventh and eighth months of life, you
should see much improvement in his ability to eat solid foods. Most babies
easily eat pureed veggies by the sixth month, so at this point they may be
hungry for more. Your baby still needs pureed foods, but the foods become
chunkier, in-between purees and full solids. At this point, you’re likely to see
baby teeth — another sign that your baby’s body is getting ready for some
changes nutritionally.
Feeding more than just veggies: 
Months 7 and 8
Hopefully by the time baby reaches the seventh month, she’s eating a nice col-
lection of basic veggies. As such, now is the time to start introducing a bigger
variety of vegetables in addition to other food items and small amounts of
finger foods. It’s very important to watch out for foods that can be a choking
hazard, so you need to make sure that bites of chunky food are small.
In the middle to that later part of the seventh month, you can introduce such
items as
 Additional veggies: You introduced basic veggies during the 4- to 6-
month range, but as your baby grows, you can introduce additional
veggie purees and make them a bit chunkier as your baby develops.
 Pureed soft fruits: Make sure that the peel is removed and stick with
foods that are less likely to cause your baby digestive problems, such as
pears, bananas, apricots, apples, and other noncitrus fruits.
 Soft bread: Serve bread in small pieces with no crust. You can also serve
small bites of crackers and graham crackers.
 Chicken or beef: Cut meat in small pieces.
 Cooked pasta: Serve pasta such as spirals, bowties, and so on — don’t
serve longer noodles because of the choking hazard. For 7-month-olds,
even spirals and bowties will need to be cut up to avoid choking risks.
As your baby gets more and more interested in food, you’ll be tempted to let
her sample more than she should. Be careful what you experiment with
because of unknown food allergies at this age and potential dangers of chok-
ing. Avoid such items as
94
Part II: From Womb to Highchair: The First 12 Months 

 Candy
 Chips
 Grapes
 Large pieces of bread
 Popcorn
 Raisins
 Uncooked veggies
See Chapter 13 for a complete list of foods to watch out for when feeding
your child.
So, what should the eating routine be during Baby’s seventh month?
Generally, your baby may
 Become less and less dependent on milk — probably three to five 
8-ounce servings a day
 Eat cereal twice a day — early morning and evening are the best times
 Eat a combination of veggies, fruit, and meat at lunch and dinner, as well
as additional fruit at breakfast
 Snack on little items, such as crackers, as desired
As your baby eats more solid food, avoid the temptation to introduce him to
cow’s milk — he isn’t ready to go from breast milk or formula to cow’s milk.
At this age, cow’s milk may cause an allergic reaction, and breast milk or for-
mula still provide most of the nutrients your baby needs. However, you
should start offering formula or breast milk, as well as water, to your baby in
a sippy cup as well as the breast or bottle.
If you’re having a lot of problems getting your child to eat, and he seems gen-
erally cranky, get his ears checked — ear problems can cause jaw pain, which
may make your baby steer clear of eating. Naturally, your pediatrician can
help you with any questions concerning eating behavior.
Expanding baby’s palatal interests:
Months 9 and 10
By the time your baby reaches the 9- to 10-month age, he’ll probably have a
couple of teeth, and he may start becoming more opinionated about what
he’s eating. You’ll notice that your baby loves certain things and makes dis-
gusted faces when you give him something else. This behavior is normal, and
you can expect it to continue as your child grows.
95
Chapter 6: Foods for Your Crawler: 6 to 12 Months

During the 9- to 10-month period, your introduction of new veggies, fruits,
and meats continues. Not a whole lot changes during this time, except you
gradually make your baby’s foods chunkier to help him get used to different
textures, depending on his development and how many teeth he has. This
process is slow, so don’t get in a hurry. 
Keep in mind that you must continue to avoid such potential allergy items
such as cow’s milk, eggs (although egg whites are okay), strawberries, nuts,
and honey.
You’ll also notice that Baby becomes more interested in feeding himself at
this age. This sense of independence often comes as a surprise, but even at
this young age, your baby wants to hold the spoon and starts trying to spoon
food into his mouth. Although you’ll have to assist, it’s important to let your
baby start practicing with the spoon as he shows interest. Your baby isn’t
only discovering how to feed himself but also gaining important dexterity
skills as he handles the spoon.
Other than these restrictions, your baby starts to eat at least what appears to
be a more grown-up diet with snacks and milk scattered throughout the day
as well. Remember the following rules during this stage:
 You can’t overfeed your child at this age. The trick is to let the child
eat until she’s full. Children stop eating when they’ve had enough, so
don’t worry about the amount of food — just be consistent in feeding
healthy food to your child.
 Don’t assume that the choking hazard has passed. Sure, your child is
more skilled at handling food with his fingers and getting it in his mouth,
but choking is always a risk. Keep small bites of food available.
 Don’t let food become a battleground. Sometimes your child eats well
and other times not. While this behavior is normal, you must maintain
your child’s good diet.
• If your child doesn’t eat dinner, don’t give him a cookie instead.
• Limit junk food — if you give in to demands for it, you’re setting up
an unhealthy eating pattern that’s likely to get worse with age.
• Expect that your child will eat only when he’s hungry — never
force him to eat.
• Don’t let eating become a discipline issue, because this behavior
makes food become a reward and punishment system. Let eating
be about eating — that’s all.
Beginning to wean: Months 11 and 12
During the final two months of your child’s first year, your helpless baby
grows into a child that can crawl and stand. Your child understands and can
96
Part II: From Womb to Highchair: The First 12 Months 

probably say “no” and may be able to say “dada” and “mama” and under-
stand the meaning of the words.
For the most part, what you serve your baby during these months is a contin-
uation of what you’ve already been serving — you still introduce new veggies,
fruits, and meats, giving your child more variety and even chunkier textures.
The biggest change is that by the end of the 12th month, your pediatrician
may suggest weaning your baby from breast milk or formula.
The American Academy of Pediatrics says that around the age of 12 months
you should begin to wean your baby off formula. If you’re breastfeeding, you
may do so for longer, but you can expect breastfeeding to slow down, too. 
Your baby may be resistant to breast and bottle weaning, or she may wean
herself. It’s important to note that this is a guideline and not a “must follow.”
All children are different and your baby may still want to nurse after her first
birthday, even when she starts eating more foods. Instead of seeing weaning
as a date on a calendar or an event, view the process as one that happens
slowly as your baby begins to eat other foods around 6 months of age. The
date-on-the-calendar approach usually gives you and your baby more stress. 
We give you some tips on how to wean in Chapter 7, so if you’re ready for
that part, flip ahead.
Don’t allow the weaning process to get out of hand; several dentists recom-
mend bottle weaning at 1 year of age or soon after to prevent tooth decay
and teeth spacing issues.
Losing the bottle, but not the milk
If your kid is still drinking from a bottle, start saying goodbye as he approaches
12 months old. (Say goodbye to the bottle, not your child!) In many cases, chil-
dren wean themselves from the bottle and prefer to use a sippy cup. After all, a
bottle requires more sucking work for less reward, and children quickly learn
that.
But having a bottle, especially at certain times of the day (such as bedtime),
can be comforting for your baby, so keep in mind that weaning is a process. If
you’re having problems weaning your child from the bottle, follow these
steps for success:
1. Begin by removing the bottle during certain periods of the day, such
as lunchtime, and giving only a sippy cup.
You’ll have to be firm, even if your child seems unhappy. Remember that
this process is gradual, so don’t force it all at once.
97
Chapter 6: Foods for Your Crawler: 6 to 12 Months

2. Continue to move more bottle feedings to the sippy cup over the next
few weeks.
Replace snacktime feedings with the sippy cup.
3. Save the final bottle feeding of the day for the last one to be removed.
With patience, firmness, and a bit of time, your child will make the
switch over to the cup.
If your child sucks a pacifier, work on weaning from the breast or bottle first
and worry about the pacifier later. Don’t try to wean both at the same time,
or everyone will end up in tears.
Simple but Satisfying Purees
When you first start feeding solids to your baby, begin with plain cereal (see Chapter 5).
However, over the next couple of months, add pureed veggies and fruit and move on to
bites of meat and combinations of foods. Naturally, it’s always best to start out with the
basics to give your child’s digestive system time to develop, and in this section, you
find some simple purees that you can put to work in your kitchen. They’re all fresh,
wholesome, and completely homemade!
The purees in this chapter build on the basic purees you begin with, which we discuss
in Chapter 5. As you add the following purees, slowly begin to adjust the texture so that
they aren’t as thin as the purees you started with. Remember, though, that the taste of
these new varied foods is different to your infant, so give her the opportunity to get
used to them before you start increasing texture.

Part II: From Womb to Highchair: The First 12 Months 
Keeping your child fit as a whistle
During the 6- to 12-month age range, your
sedentary baby becomes a moving machine. As
such, this time of a child’s life is full of change
and full of special needs. In terms of food, be
sure to keep the following tips in mind:
 Never use food as a reward, bribe, or pun-
ishment. Food should be food and nothing
more. If you start using food to get your
child to behave or perform in a certain way,
you’re making food too much of a focus.
 Milk isn’t a traveling liquid. When your
child is at play, don’t let her carry around a
sippy cup of milk or juice continually. Juices
are great for your child, but it doesn’t have
to be introduced into your child’s diet every
10 minutes. Now is a good time to introduce
drinking water, but still keep the liquid in the
kitchen. Your child will indicate when she’s
thirsty.

T Avocado and Squash Puree
Both avocados and squash are full of nutrition and easy to digest. This puree tastes
great and contains plenty of good fat from the avocado. It’s a healthy meal option for
your little one. You can add this puree to your child’s diet at 6 months.
Preparation time: 15 minutes
Yield: Two 1⁄2-cup servings
99
Chapter 6: Foods for Your Crawler: 6 to 12 Months
1⁄2 medium yellow squash, peeled
1⁄2 ripe avocado, peeled and pitted
1 Cut the squash in bite-size rounds and boil it in water until tender (about 12 minutes).
2 Drain the squash and puree it with the avocado in a food processor until smooth. Serve
warm.
T Broccoli and Cauliflower Puree
This puree is full of nutrition, but you need to wait until Baby is 9 months old to serve
it, because both broccoli and cauliflower are denser and more difficult to digest than
other vegetables. We recommend making this puree a bit chunky, so it has small chunks
of broccoli and cauliflower in it.
Preparation time: 15 minutes
Yield: Two 1⁄2-cup servings
1⁄2 cup small cauliflower florets
1⁄2 cup small broccoli florets
1 Place all the florets in a steamer and steam them for 10 minutes, or until tender. You 
can also boil them in a few inches of water in a saucepan with a lid if you don’t have a
steamer.
2 Drain the water from the vegetables and puree them in a food processor until blended
but somewhat chunky. Serve warm.
Vary It! You can mix this puree with others, such as the Sweet Potato Puree in Chapter 5,
for a more interesting flavor.

T Corn and Green Pea Puree
This puree combines easy-to-digest corn with green peas, making it a good combination
meal for your baby. Because this one is great to introduce at the 6-month stage, keep
the puree well blended and moderately thin.
Preparation Time: 15 minutes
Yield: One 3⁄4-cup serving
100
Part II: From Womb to Highchair: The First 12 Months 
1⁄4 green peas, frozen or canned
1⁄4 cup whole kernel corn, frozen or canned
1 Cook the veggies according to the package directions.
2 When the veggies are tender, puree them together in a food processor, and add water as
necessary for a moderately thin puree. Serve warm.
T Rice and Peach Puree
This recipe combines white rice with peaches for a yummy meal. For the best flavor,
make sure that the peach you use is fully ripe, and to speed the preparation process,
use minute rice. You can start serving this puree during Baby’s sixth month and
increase the chunkiness as your baby grows.
Preparation time: 30 minutes
Yield: Four 1⁄2-cup servings
1⁄2 cup white rice
1 ripe peach, washed, peeled, pitted, and
halved
1 Prepare the rice according to the package directions. You want the rice to be well done,
almost mushy.
2 Puree the peach in a food processor, add the rice, and puree. The juice from the peach
and the water from the rice is probably all you need for consistency, but you can add a
little water if necessary. Serve warm.

T Banana Peach Puree
This pure-fruit dish will tantalize your child’s taste buds with the sweetness of peaches
and an old favorite — the banana. You can start this puree as early as 6 months of age —
at that age, you want this puree to be slightly thin, but you can increase the consistency
to pudding thickness as your child grows.
Preparation time: 5 minutes
Yield: One 3⁄4-cup serving
101
Chapter 6: Foods for Your Crawler: 6 to 12 Months
1 medium, ripe banana, peeled
1 medium, ripe peach, peeled and pitted
Dice the banana and peach and puree them in a food processor. Add a bit of water for
consistency if necessary. Serve.
Tip: Substitute kiwi, apples, pears, or avocado for the peach in this recipe.
T Pureed Apples and Pears
Here’s a common apple and pear puree that you can serve as early as the 6-month
stage. You can follow this basic recipe and amend it to include other fruit combinations
as Baby grows, during which time you can also decrease the water and make the puree
with a texture like pudding.
Preparation time: 20 minutes
Yield: One 3⁄4-cup serving
1⁄4 cup ripe apple, skinned and cut in small
pieces
1⁄4 cup ripe pear, skinned and cut in small
pieces
11⁄4 cups water, divided
1 Mix the fruit and 1 cup of the water in a small saucepan and simmer until the fruit is soft
(about 10 minutes).
2 Drain the fruit and place it in a food processor. Add the remaining water and puree until
thin. Serve at room temperature.

T Banana and Avocado Puree
Although the combination of banana and avocado may not sound appetizing to you,
children often like it. Avocado has a rich taste that works well with the sweet taste of
banana. It’s also chock-full of vitamins, so it’s a great puree to feed to your baby. As
your child grows, decrease the water to make the puree a bit chunkier.
Preparation time: 10 minutes
Yield: One 3⁄4-cup serving
102
Part II: From Womb to Highchair: The First 12 Months 
1⁄4 cup peeled and mashed avocado
1⁄4 ripe banana, mashed
1⁄4 cup water
Mix the mashed ingredients in a small bowl. If your mixture is lumpy, puree it in a food
processor until creamy. Add the water and stir well, adding more water if needed.
T Yogurt Banana Puree
Yogurt is a valuable health food for infants because it’s a balanced source of protein,
fats, carbohydrates, and minerals, and youngsters usually love its texture. Note that
you should only use whole-fat, plain yogurt for this recipe, which works great for chil-
dren 9 months old and up. As Baby grows, you can make it chunkier.
You can save the extra puree in your refrigerator for later use, but because bananas
turn brown, the puree won’t last longer than a day.
Preparation time: 5 minutes
Yield: Three 1⁄2-cup servings
1 medium ripe banana, peeled
1 cup plain, full-fat yogurt
Cut the banana into small pieces, and then puree the yogurt and banana in a food
processor. Serve slightly cool or at room temperature.
Vary It! Substitute any other fruit for the banana in this recipe. Keep in mind that you
should stick with fruits that are unlikely to give your baby a tummy ache, such as peaches,
pears, avocados, and apples.

T Dried Apricot Puree
Apricots are a good fruit for young babies because they’re easy to digest. However, find-
ing fresh apricots can be difficult depending on what time of year it is and where you
live. As such, this recipe shows you how to use the dried variety instead. This puree is
somewhat thick and chunky, so you shouldn’t serve it until Baby’s 9th month.
Preparation time: 5 minutes
Yield: Two 1⁄2-cup servings
103
Chapter 6: Foods for Your Crawler: 6 to 12 Months
4 dried apricots
4 tablespoons water
1 Simmer the apricots in 4 cups of water for 15 minutes or until very tender.
2 Drain the fruit and put it in a food processor, along with 4 tablespoons of water. Puree
finely. Add a bit more water to get a puree consistency, but keep in mind that this recipe
will be a bit thicker and chunkier than other fruit purees. Because you’re working with
previously dried apricots, you may need to remove a few harder or larger pieces from the
puree and then puree a bit more to get the right consistency. Serve at room temperature.
Vary It! Consider mixing this fruit puree with baby cereal or with a bit of yogurt to make it
more palatable for your baby. If fresh apricots are in season, you can simply peel and quar-
ter them, remove the seeds, and puree.
Basic veggie and fruit purees
You can essentially puree any veggie or fruit,
but instead of giving you a recipe for each and
every possibility, we provide a few tips about
pureeing that will help with your preparation of
all veggies and fruits.
For veggies, do the following:
1. Wash and peel the veggie and boil it until
it’s soft.
2. Pureed the veggie in a food processor. 
If you don’t own a food processor, you can
use a blender or hand mixer. See Chapter 3
for information on basic kitchen tools.
3. Add a teaspoon of water (or more or less),
depending on the veggie, to get the desired
consistency.
As a general rule, any basic puree should be
thin but manageable with a spoon. For this
reason, getting the right consistency can
require a bit of water. As your child ages, add
less water to make the puree thicker and grad-
ually move your child toward chunkier foods.
Pureeing fruit is basically the same. Be sure to
choose only ripe fruit.
1. Cut the fruit into pieces or boil it if neces-
sary to make it soft.
2. Puree to the desired consistency. 
Add water as necessary.

The Best of Two Worlds: 
Combination Meals
As your baby reaches 6 months of age, her meal options become more com-
plex and varied. Naturally, your child will like certain foods and have aver-
sions to others. In this section, you find some healthy, homemade recipes
that your baby is likely to enjoy (our kids loved them!). With pure, fresh
ingredients, you’ll feel good about serving these meals.
Keep in mind that when your wee one is 6 months old, you should puree
these combination meals until they’re thin, but as your baby grows, you can
make them progressively chunkier. By 12 months, your baby will be able to
eat some of these meals without you having to puree them at all.
Turkey and Peas
In this recipe, you have a couple of different options on how to prepare the meal. You
can purchase the turkey and peas precooked (frozen), or you can start with fresh ingre-
dients and do the cooking yourself. Follow the package directions for cooking the
turkey breast if you take the uncooked route.
Preparation time: 20 minutes
Yield: Eight 1⁄2-cup servings
104
Part II: From Womb to Highchair: The First 12 Months 
10-ounce package frozen green peas 
10 ounces skinless, boneless turkey breast,
cooked
1 Follow the package directions for cooking the peas. Cut the turkey breast into small
pieces.
2 Place the turkey pieces and the cooked peas into a food processor and puree, adding a
bit of water as needed for consistency. Serve warm.

Chicken and Peaches
We fully expect that you’d probably never think of mixing chicken and peaches together,
but children often love the contrasting tastes. This recipe makes 1 cup of puree, but the
puree freezes well, so you can make extra and freeze the puree in single-serving containers.
(See Chapter 3 for the lowdown on the ice cube freezing method.) The advance prepara-
tion makes fixing meals a snap — just thaw, reheat, and serve.
Preparation time: 15 minutes
Yield: Two 1⁄2-cup servings
105
Chapter 6: Foods for Your Crawler: 6 to 12 Months
1⁄3 cup cooked and chopped chicken breast
1⁄2 cup fresh peeled and sliced peaches
Puree the chicken and peaches until you reach the desired consistency. Serve warm.
Blueberry Steak Puree
This simple recipe combines the sweet taste of blueberry and small bits of steak —
sounds weird, but kids love it. It also freezes well, so make extra and portion the left-
overs into single servings for later use.
This recipe makes a dark mixture that stains clothes — no white T-shirts for you or
your baby with this meal!
Preparation time: 15 minutes
Yield: Two 1⁄2-cup servings
1⁄2 cup fresh blueberries, washed 
1⁄3 cup cooked and chopped steak
Place the blueberries and steak pieces in a food processor and puree. To prevent chok-
ing, make sure that you puree until the steak pieces are really small. Serve warm.

Cod and Veggie Puree
Fish is an important meat to bring into your baby’s diet even at an early age because fish
oil aids in brain development. In fact, fish should be a consistent part of all diets, for both
young folks and old folks. If you want a little Einstein, this puree just might help.
Preparation time: 15 minutes
Yield: Two 1⁄2-cup servings
106
Part II: From Womb to Highchair: The First 12 Months 
1⁄4 cup cooked and finely chopped cod fillet
1⁄2 cup finely chopped fresh mixed veggies,
cooked according to package directions
1⁄3 fresh peeled ripe tomato, diced
3 tablespoons formula or breast milk
1 teaspoon butter
1 Mix all the ingredients in a large saucepan and heat until the butter melts. Stir well.
2 Transfer the mixture to a food processor and puree for desired consistency. Serve warm.
Meat and Potato Puree
This recipe is a good combination if your baby seems a bit unsure about eating meat.
Keep in mind that a resistance to meat may be due to texture more than taste.
Preparation time: 15 minutes
Yield: Two 1⁄2-cup servings
1⁄3 cup ground beef, cooked and drained
3⁄4 cup peeled, boiled, and mashed sweet
potato
2 tablespoons breast milk or formula
1⁄2 teaspoon butter
1 Mix all the ingredients in a large saucepan and heat until the butter melts. Stir well.
2 Transfer the mixture to a food processor and puree for desired consistency. Serve
warm.

T Lentils and Carrot Puree
This hearty recipe is a good meal for your baby, full of carbohydrates and vitamins.
Because this recipe makes more than you need, you can simply freeze the extra por-
tions and reheat them later.
Preparation time: 15 minutes
Cooking time: 1 hour, 15 minutes
Yield: Eight 1⁄2-cup servings
107
Chapter 6: Foods for Your Crawler: 6 to 12 Months
1⁄4 pound dry lentils
1⁄4 pound raw baby carrots
4 cups water
Salt to taste
1 Sort the lentils for stones; throw out the stones and rinse the lentils well. Even lentils
sold in a bag (not purchased in bulk) may have stones mixed in with them, so make
sure that you sort thoroughly.
2 In a large saucepan, combine all the ingredients. Bring the mixture to a boil, reduce the
heat, and simmer for 1 to 11⁄4 hours, until the lentils and carrots soften.
3 Remove the saucepan from the heat, drain, and pour the mixture into a food processor;
puree to desired consistency. Serve warm.
T Cinnamon Pear Puree
Cinnamon and pears naturally go together — you can find this combination even in
adult desserts — so this puree is a treat for your infant.
Preparation time: 15 minutes
Yield: Two 1⁄2-cup servings
2⁄3 cup skinned and chopped pear
1 tablespoon apple juice
Pinch of cinnamon
1 Boil the pear pieces in water in a small saucepan for 5 minutes or until soft.
2 Pour the pears into a food processor and add the rest of the ingredients. Puree to
desired consistency. Serve warm.
Tip: If you want, add more cinnamon, but strive for a balanced flavor. 

Kicking It Up a Notch: 
More Complex Meals
As your baby grows to the 10-month stage, the meal options get even more
complex as your baby’s ability to handle different textures and foods increases.
Feeding at this stage requires more options; the recipes in this section help you
get started.
T Cheesy Alphabet Pasta
Small pasta shapes, such as alphabet pasta, work well for children this age because the
pasta doesn’t present a choking hazard. With the combination of cheese, this dish is
sure to be a hit.
Preparation time: 20 minutes
Yield: Four 1⁄2-cup servings
108
Part II: From Womb to Highchair: The First 12 Months

bet pasta and butter. Cook the pasta until tender (about 5 minutes) and drain.
3 Add the veggies to the pasta and stir in the cheese until the cheese melts. Salt to taste
and serve warm.
Apple Chicken and Veggies
Apples and chicken work well together and have a taste your baby is sure to like. Make
an extra-large portion of this recipe and put the extras in the freezer for a quick meal
later. Add a side of any fruit or fruit puree in this chapter and you have a complete meal.
Preparation time: 15 minutes
Yield: Two 1⁄2-cup servings
1 tablespoon butter
1⁄4 pound skinless, boneless chicken breast
1⁄2 ripe apple, cored, peeled, and finely chopped

until the center is no longer pink.
2 Add the apple and chicken broth to the cooked chicken and bring the mixture to a boil.
Reduce the heat to medium and cook for 10 minutes.
3 Remove the pan from the heat, remove the chicken from the frying pan (reserving the
apples and broth), and chop the chicken into small pieces. In a food processor, puree
the chicken with the mixture left in the frying pan until well mixed but still chunky.
Ham and Veggie Casserole 
for Little Ones
This recipe combines meat, rice, and veggies in a kid-friendly casserole. This dish is
freezable, so save what you don’t serve for a later meal in a pinch.

baby is no longer a baby and not quite a full-fledged
kid, either. You’ll have many joys and many challenges
during this time, and you’ll find that meals tend to be the
same way. However, you can manage your toddler’s eating
habits and foods with a few tactics and the recipes that
you find in this part — for 12- to 18-month-olds, 18-month-

elcome to the world of toddlers! The
moment you realize that your baby is no
longer a “baby” comes as a shock. Babies seem to
burst suddenly into toddlers around the age of 12
months without any warning. You’ll see your little
bundle of joy begin to assert more independence,
develop more personality, and yes, voice more
opinions on your cooking — meaning your toddler
has changing nutritional needs and eating habits.
The good news is toddlerhood brings you plenty
of joys as you watch your baby grow, and you’ll
find that your child’s food repertoire grows and
develops rapidly. As food choices expand, that
means more flexibility in meals and more fun
options for your kid and the entire family.
In this chapter, you uncover 15 recipes for chil-
dren ages 12 to 18 months. You also find advice
along the way to help you manage your child
who’s no longer into “baby food.”

Understanding a 1-Year-Old’s 
Mealtime Needs
As your baby turns into a toddler, you suddenly become aware that his nutri-
tional needs have also changed. During the previous 12 months, your little
one depended on milk (breast or formula) for most of his nutrition, but now,
as you’re weaning him from formula (he can breastfeed longer if desired),
cow’s milk (or soymilk, or goat’s milk, and so on if you prefer) becomes only
a part of his diet.
The transition from a milk-only diet to a diet consisting of a variety of foods
can be a bit frightening because you want to make sure that your young tod-
dler takes in all his nutritional needs. The good news is you can make the
nutritional transition from baby meals to toddler meals much easier than you
may think if you just understand a few basics, which we cover in this section.
Weaning your wee one 
from breast and bottle
Weaning is a process that takes time, and the time to start is a bit different for
each child. Generally, by age 1 a child can make the move from breast milk or
formula to full-fat (whole) cow’s milk. When you’re ready to start weaning,
following these steps:
1. Reduce the number of times each day that your baby is allowed to
drink breast milk or formula.
Make sure that you don’t stop cold turkey, especially if you’re 
breastfeeding.
2. Dwindle the daytime feedings.
This process can take months, more or less, so don’t feel like you have
to be on a predetermined timeline. The gradual approach is the easiest
both emotionally and physically for everyone.
3. Work toward eliminating the final nighttime nursing.
This time can be the most difficult to break because your baby has
grown accustomed to nursing and now psychologically needs it. If your
baby is having problems giving up the breast or bottle in the evening,
follow these steps:
• Slowly reduce the amount of nursing time over a couple of weeks
until there’s no more nighttime nursing.
• Lose the night bottle by simply changing the bedtime routine.
• Read your child a book to distract her.
116
Part III: Big Changes Ahead: Feeding Your Toddler 

If you’re breastfeeding, check out Breastfeeding For Dummies (Wiley), by
Sharon Perkins and Carol Vannais, as an excellent resource. An entire chapter
is devoted to weaning your baby.
The fat of the matter
Probably the most important thing you must teach yourself is simply this:
Toddlers don’t have the same nutritional needs as older children or adults. In
fact, your toddler needs more fat and calories and less fiber — basically, the
opposite of what you need (ah, to be young again)! This advice applies to chil-
dren 5 years old and younger.
The consensus among health experts is that children under 5 shouldn’t be
limited in their diets concerning fat and calories, unless your doctor specifi-
cally tells you to do so. A lot of parents become worried around the 12th to
15th month because their baby looks chubby. The chubby look is a normal
part of a toddler’s growth and nothing to be concerned about. Your toddler
burns baby fat as he continues to grow and becomes more mobile. But for
now, he needs the fat and calories.
In a young child, fat and calories assist the growth of the brain and the ner-
vous system. Without fat and calories to burn, your child’s body is forced to
burn protein, and protein is necessary for building muscle, so you don’t want
your child burning protein for energy.
We’re not saying that you should feed your baby junk foods that provide only
empty calories — you just need to supply a healthy menu of foods, along
with a good amount of activity — and Mother Nature will do the rest. The key
is to keep your child from a lowfat type of diet, which adults are fond of fol-
lowing. Generally, a 12- to 18-month-old should eat about 1,000 calories a day.
Don’t be concerned with counting calories, though. Some days your toddler
will eat more, and some days she’ll eat less. This behavior is normal.
Although a high fiber diet helps prevent cancer and other diseases in adults,
it’s not good for your toddler. Fiber is a heavy material with few calories, and
while it makes you feel full, it doesn’t provide the nutritional value your tod-
dler needs. You eat the high fiber diet, but skip it with your toddler.
Managing meals and snacks
One parenting pitfall that you may encounter is the “three meal syndrome.”
We condition ourselves to eat three main meals a day. However, your child
tends to eat smaller meals and snack between meals. This desire is normal
and healthy. Don’t restrict your child to three meals without snacks — this
limitation inhibits your child’s nutritional intake. Virtually all children follow
the lighter meal method, so don’t sweat it. In fact, if your child doesn’t eat
117
Chapter 7: First Steps and First Scheduled Meals: 12 to 18 Months

midmorning and midafternoon snacks, you’ll probably notice irritable behav-
ior because your child’s blood-sugar levels begin to sag. Snacks are healthy
and important!
Wanting to snack between meals is normal, but be sure that your child isn’t
panhandling between meals. Snacks should be planned and nutritious like
meals; allow for plenty of time between snacks and meals so your toddler
comes to the table with an appetite.
Making milk a priority
Generally, your 12- to 18-month-old needs 16 to 20 fluid ounces of milk each
day. Unless your toddler has an allergy, whole cow’s milk (not skim or 2 per-
cent) does the trick. However, some children are a bit resistant to drinking
cow’s milk. If resistant, try mixing prepared formula or breast milk with whole
milk to allow your child to adjust to the taste.
Other options to include calcium in your child’s diet that count as “milk”
include
 Cheese
 Goat’s milk
 Soymilk
 Yogurt
Include cheese in meals and in snacks, and make delicious smoothies using
yogurt. Get creative with milk, cheese, and yogurt so you easily work enough
calcium into your toddler’s diet if she seems to resist drinking enough from 
a cup.
Serving fruits and veggies
Throughout this chapter, we mention that the nutritional needs of toddlers
differ from older children and adults. However, in the case of fruits and veg-
gies, we’re the same. Healthcare professionals recommend consuming five
servings of fruits and vegetables each day. This number may seem a bit much
and difficult to work into a toddler’s diet at first. However, it’s not when you
consider these opportunities:
 Have some fruit or fruit juice at breakfast.
 Serve veggies, such as carrot sticks, and fruit, such as applesauce, with
lunch and dinner.
 Include veggies and fruits as part of snacktime.
Simply put, if you make a habit of eating five servings of fruit and vegetables 
a day, you should have no problem incorporating it into your child’s diet as
well — and you’ll both be healthier.

Eating healthy grains
At the 12- to 18-month stage, you need to mix in grains in order to give your
child a healthy, balanced diet. Generally, children this age should eat between
5 and 12 servings each day. As you think about grains, think “brown and
whole.” Stick to brown rice, brown breads, multigrain breads, and other
wholesome grains. White breads are the least healthy option for your child.
Common serving sizes are small. For example, 1⁄4 cup rice or pasta is a serv-
ing, while 1⁄3 cup grain cereal or even half a bagel is considered a serving. For
more info on serving sizes, see www.mypyramid.gov.
Working meat into the meal
Meat is an important part of any diet, providing necessary protein for strong
muscle development. During your child’s 12- to 18-month stage, continue to
introduce small bites of meat to your child.
You should strive to give your child 2 to 3 ounces of meat per day. Some good
serving examples: 1 ounce of beef, poultry, or fish; 1⁄4 cup of beans, lentils, or
tofu.

The case of the testy veggie eater
In a perfect world, we would all munch on our
vegetables all day and love every minute of it.
However, in the real world, you may have a tod-
dler who’s resistant to eating veggies. While this
phenomenon isn’t unusual, it’s a problem worth
combating because veggies are an important
part of your child’s healthy diet.
Here are some suggestions for getting your
child to eat those veggies:
 Serve raw veggies. Many children resist
cooked veggies but will eat them raw.
Consider serving raw veggies with ranch
dip at snacktime.
 Stir-fry veggies. Adding stir-fried vegeta-
bles with rice or pasta may help your kids
eat up those veggies.
 Serve soup and other dishes with “hidden”
veggies inside.
 Experiment with different veggies. Find
what works, but get those veggies in the
diet!
 Allow the addition of sauces, dressings,
cheese, butter, and so on. Sometimes these
toppings help mask the veggies for 
consumption.
 Continue to offer vegetables as your child’s
tastes change. Continued exposure is key.
Never force-feed any vegetables.
 Introduce veggies before fruit, even when
you’re pureeing veggies! It’s helpful for
your children to get a taste for veggies
before fruit, so they don’t resist veggies
later.

Remembering that toddlers 
have taste buds, too
Your toddler starts developing a sense of taste and becomes more reactive to
food. The sense of taste as well as texture and visual appeal all drive a child
to eat (or not eat) in much the same way as adults (think about it, when was
the last time you ate something you really didn’t like or that looked gross).
The accepting and rejecting behavior is a normal process that your toddler
goes through. Your responsibility is to continue to introduce healthy foods
(and reintroduce them as your child’s likes and dislikes change) and make
sure that she has the right daily nutrition. Keep in mind that a new food often
has to be introduced several times before your child takes an interest, and
also keep in mind that introducing means offering the food, not forcing it.
Rise and Shine — It’s Breakfast Time
Most toddlers love to eat breakfast. Youngsters typically wake up happy and
in a good mood (unlike many adults), so the morning is a good time to intro-
duce new breakfast items. In this section, we give you a few breakfast meals
to help you get started.
T Carrot Muffins
This healthy Carrot Muffin recipe avoids the sugar in most muffins and gives your tod-
dler a tasty breakfast food. In fact, these muffins also work well as a side at lunch or
dinner and even for a snack.
Preparation time: 10 minutes
Cooking time: 20 minutes
Yield: 12 servings
120
Part III: Big Changes Ahead: Feeding Your Toddler 
1 cup plain, full-fat yogurt
1⁄2 cup whole milk
2 eggs
1 tablespoon maple syrup
1 tablespoon canola oil
21⁄4 cups whole-wheat flour
1⁄2 teaspoon baking soda
1 teaspoon baking powder
1⁄2 teaspoon salt
3 medium carrots, grated (about 1 cup)
Nonstick cooking spray
1 Preheat the oven to 375 degrees and spray a muffin pan with nonstick cooking spray.
2 Whisk together the yogurt, milk, eggs, syrup, and oil until smooth.

3 In a separate bowl, whisk together the flour, baking soda, baking powder, and salt.
4 Add the grated carrots and the yogurt mixture to the flour mixture and stir well.
5 Pour the mixture evenly into the muffin pan and bake for 20 minutes. Cool and serve.
Vary It! Jazz up your muffins by pureeing fruit and using the puree as a topping.
Pineapple works especially well with these muffins.
T Homemade Pancakes
This recipe puts a healthy twist on simple pancakes. Because the recipe uses both eggs
and yogurt, your child gets good nutritional value and will love the taste, too.
Preparation time: 5 minutes
Cooking time: 20 minutes
Yield: 7 servings (3 pancakes per serving)
121
Chapter 7: First Steps and First Scheduled Meals: 12 to 18 Months
1 egg
2⁄3 cup plain full-fat yogurt
2⁄3 cup milk
11⁄4 cups self-rising flour
2 tablespoons maple syrup
Nonstick cooking spray
1 Beat the egg and mix it with the yogurt.
2 Stir in the milk, flour, and syrup until the batter is smooth.
3 Spray a frying pan or griddle with nonstick cooking spray and heat on medium-high
heat. To check the heat level, put a drop of water in the greased pan or griddle. If the
water sizzles, you’re ready to cook!
4 Drop a heaping tablespoon of batter in the pan and repeat, leaving space between the
pancakes. This method makes pancakes that are 2 to 3 inches in diameter.
5 Cook for 1 minute or until pancake starts to bubble on top. Flip the pancake for another
minute of cooking. The pancake should be lightly brown when it’s done.
6 Continue to grease the skillet between batches. Serve the pancakes warm with butter
and syrup or fruit puree.
Tip: Have a little fun with these pancakes by making them in different shapes. Pancake
cooking molds are available at your favorite kitchen store (or visit www.cooking.com).
Vary It! Children typically love syrup, but if you’re concerned about sugar, many varieties
of syrups — including sugar-free syrups — are available at your local grocery store. Give
one a try — our children loved the variety! If you start out serving sugar-free syrup, your
kids aren’t likely to know what they’re missing.

122
Part III: Big Changes Ahead: Feeding Your Toddler 
1 English muffin
4 to 5 whole, ripe strawberries or 1 heaping
tablespoon pure strawberry jam
Butter (for spreading)
1 egg
1 Slice the English muffin into two halves and then puree the strawberries in a food
processor or blender.
2 Toast the English muffin halves and then butter.
3 Spread the strawberry puree or jam on each of the two English muffin halves.
4 Scramble the egg and cook it until firm (not runny).
5 Place the scrambled egg on each of the muffin halves and serve open-faced style.
Vary It! Try creating your pizza with fruit instead of eggs. Try small chunks of fruit with
cream cheese. You can also serve with small bits of sausage and egg. Make it colorful and
it will be a hit!
T Banana Parfait
Kids think this treat is something special, because the finish product looks cool! But
you don’t have to tell them that you didn’t labor in the kitchen for hours on end (prep is
actually quick and easy — a big plus for busy parents). Check out the layered effect in
the color section of this book.
Preparation time: 5 minutes
Chill time: 15 minutes
Yield: One 1-cup serving
1⁄2 medium banana
3⁄4 cup plain, full-fat yogurt
1 Peel and slice the banana into small pieces.
T Breakfast Pizza
This recipe makes a unique breakfast pizza using an English muffin. With this basic
recipe, you can easily change it and alter it in a number of ways.
Preparation time: 10 minutes
Cooking time: 5 minutes
Yield: 2 servings

123
Chapter 7: First Steps and First Scheduled Meals: 12 to 18 Months
Butter
2 slices whole-wheat bread
1 small lettuce leaf
1 thin tomato slice
2 thin slices fresh avocado
2 pieces fresh turkey, thinly sliced
1 Butter one side of each bread slice to taste. Place the bread in a toaster oven, and toast
until lightly brown. If you’re using a slot toaster, butter the bread after toasting it.
2 On one slice of toast, place the lettuce, tomato, and avocado; and on the other slice,
place the turkey.
3 Put the two pieces together, and cut the sandwich into four squares. Serve.
Vary It! Substitute other condiments for the butter. Try mayonnaise or cream cheese, both
of which are tasty choices.
2 Layer the yogurt and banana slices in a cup: 1⁄2 cup of yogurt, then banana slices, and
then 1⁄4 cup of yogurt. You can also reserve some banana slices for the top of the parfait
if you’d like. Serve chilled.
A Midday Boost: Lunches 
for Your Little One
As the variety in your toddler’s food choices expands, include more options
for lunch. The following tried-and-true favorite recipes all provide proper
nutrition and are tasty for your growing 12- to 18-month-old.
Avocado Turkey Sandwich
Avocados are great for children this age because they’re easy to digest and full of vita-
mins and healthy fats. Try this yummy avocado and turkey sandwich with your toddler
(you may find yourself sneaking a bite). Take a look in the color section of this book to
see the finished product.
Preparation time: 5 minutes
Yield: 1 serving

Corn and Chicken Soup
Chicken soup is a yummy meal for children because they often like the taste, but this
recipe takes you much further than the canned variety. The sweet corn greatly adds to
the taste of typical canned chicken soup, which tends to be overly salty. This recipe
also helps put some additional vegetables in your child’s diet.
This recipe is a meal in and of itself, so you don’t need another dish to go with it.
However, Carrot Muffins (see the recipe earlier in this chapter) are a good pairing with
this soup, both in terms of taste and nutrition.
Preparation time: 10 minutes
Cooking time: 25 minutes
Yield: Six 1⁄2-cup servings
124
Part III: Big Changes Ahead: Feeding Your Toddler 
3 tablespoons butter
1 celery stalk, finely chopped
1⁄2 medium white onion, finely chopped
1⁄3 cup flour
11⁄4 cups milk
1 cup chicken broth
2 skinless, boneless chicken breasts (about
10 ounces total)
13⁄4 cups canned sweet corn, undrained
Salt and pepper to taste
1 Melt the butter in a large saucepan over medium heat. Add the celery and onion and
cook for about 6 minutes. Stir in flour and cook for another 2 minutes.
2 In a saucepan, heat the milk over low heat, whisking constantly until the milk is hot.
3 Pour the hot milk into the butter mixture and stir until thickened. Add the chicken
broth, heat, and reduce to a simmer.
4 Cut the chicken breasts into small pieces and add to the soup.
5 Simmer for 15 minutes, adding the corn during the last three minutes of cooking. Season
with salt and pepper, if desired, and serve.
T Grilled Cheese with Tomato
Did you eat grilled cheese as a child? Odds are good you did. (Or maybe you still do.)
Grilled cheese seems to be a favorite among children! Here’s a simple recipe you can
use time and time again, and it adds extra zing with the tomato and mozzarella cheese.
Preparation time: 3 minutes
Cooking time: 3 minutes
Yield: 1 serving

1 Butter one side of one piece of bread and place the bread, buttered side down, in a
frying pan over medium to medium-low heat. Place the cheese slice, tomato, and moz-
zarella cheese on the bread. Butter the second piece of bread and place it on top of the
sandwich, buttered side up.
2 Fry the sandwich for 3 minutes on each side or until golden brown. Remove the sand-
wich from the frying pan, cool slightly, and cut into four quarters and serve.
Tip: Use a cookie cutter to cut the sandwich into fun shapes. Consider serving with carrot
and celery sticks or other nutritious foods that your child can decorate her sandwich with.
English Muffin Pizza
Here’s a simple and healthy English muffin lunch pizza that your toddler will enjoy
repeatedly. You have the flexibility to change this recipe in several ways for quick meals
with variety. Don’t forget to peek at the color section in this book to see the end result.
Preparation time: 3 minutes
Cooking time: 5 minutes
Yield: 2 servings
125
Chapter 7: First Steps and First Scheduled Meals: 12 to 18 Months
1 tablespoon butter
2 slices whole-wheat bread
1 slice American cheese
1 tomato slice
2 heaping tablespoons shredded mozzarella
cheese
1 English muffin
4 tablespoons tomato sauce or pizza sauce
4 pepperoni slices
1⁄2 cup shredded mozzarella cheese
1 Cut the English muffin into two pieces and place the halves on a baking tray.
2 Evenly place the pizza sauce, pepperoni slices, and mozzarella cheese on the two pieces
of English muffin.
3 Toast muffins in a toaster oven until slightly brown and serve warm. If you’re using a
conventional oven, heat the oven to 300 degrees and cook for 5 minutes or until cheese
melts.
Vary It! If pepperoni isn’t your child’s thing, try using Canadian bacon, available in small
slices like pepperoni. You can also use various vegetables such as mushrooms, onions, and
green bell peppers and even fruits such as pineapple for a twist on the traditional pizza top-
pings. Consider making a dessert pizza with strawberry jam and small bits of pineapple.

T Cheesy Apple Toast
This is a quick meal that even works well for breakfast or a snack. Toddlers tend to love
both cheese and apples, and the combination of the two is one that your little tyke is
sure to love. Got a finicky eater? This quick recipe often gets the reluctant eater to eat!
Preparation time: 5 minutes
Yield: 1 serving
126
Part III: Big Changes Ahead: Feeding Your Toddler 
Butter
1 slice whole-wheat bread
1 slice American cheese
1⁄2 pureed apple or 2 tablespoons applesauce
1 Butter one side of the bread and place the cheese on top of the buttered side of the
bread.
2 Put the bread on a baking tray and place the tray in the toaster oven. Toast the bread
until slightly brown and the cheese melts. If you don’t have a toaster oven, you can use
your regular oven set at about 300 degrees. Cook until the cheese melts.
3 Remove the tray from the toaster and let the sandwich cool slightly. Hot cheese can
burn your toddler’s mouth.
4 Spread the apple puree or applesauce on top of the cheese. Serve warm.
T Cheesy Orzo and Veggies
If you’re not familiar with orzo, it’s small pasta that looks like barley kernels. If you
search the Internet for recipes for kids, you’ll find lots of orzo-based recipes, and for
good reason — orzo produces a creamy, easy-to-chew pasta that kids seem to like. With
this recipe, the orzo will be a hit and you’ll get a serving of veggies in as well!
Preparation time: 10 minutes
Cooking time: 15 minutes
Yield: Ten 1⁄2-cup servings
1⁄4 pound dry orzo pasta
1⁄2 cup carrots, peeled and diced
1⁄2 cup broccoli, diced
1⁄4 cup black-eyed peas (or you can substitute
another variety)
2 tablespoons butter
1⁄4 cup grated cheddar cheese

1 Place the orzo, carrots, broccoli, and peas in a medium saucepan. Cover with water and
boil for 12 minutes or until tender. Drain the water from the saucepan.
2 In a large pan, melt the butter, and add the drained pasta and vegetables, stirring well.
3 Remove the pan from the heat and add the cheese, stirring until cheese melts. Serve
warm.
All’s Well that Ends Well: 
Delicious Dinners
Dinnertime can be a great time for family and bonding. With busy schedules,
family mealtime is something that’s fallen by the wayside, and our culture has
forgotten that sitting down to eat together as a family unit is a time for inter-
action and good communication. We encourage you to make family dinner-
time a priority in your home — it leads to healthy eating, good mealtime
behaviors, and consistent communication.
With that said, many parents find dinnertime frustrating with a toddler. It’s
not unusual for toddlers to eat a good breakfast, a decent lunch, but not eat
much at dinner. So don’t be overly concerned if your toddler tends to pick at
her dinner. She’ll eat if she’s hungry.
Limit juice and milk intake between meals and have snacks far enough before
planned meals to allow your child to come to the table hungry enough to eat.
Give water for drinks throughout the day because water is less likely to fill
your child up.
This dinner section presents some healthy recipes for your toddler (and your
family) to enjoy.

Chapter 7: First Steps and First Scheduled Meals: 12 to 18 Months

T Tofu and Pasta Dinner
Pasta is a great food for toddlers because it’s a great source of energy (although at
times you may want your child to have less energy), and tofu is a healthy alternative to
other protein sources. You’ll find this recipe quick and healthy for the whole family. The
leftovers (if you have any) also freeze well.
Preparation time: 5 minutes
Cooking time: 10 minutes
Yield: Seven 1-cup servings
128
Part III: Big Changes Ahead: Feeding Your Toddler 
4 cups dry pasta (any variety, but orzo is easy
for children to eat)
8 ounces tofu, diced (not silken tofu — it
won’t brown)
3 teaspoons olive oil
1 medium zucchini, grated
Salt to taste
1 Cook pasta according to package directions. Drain water.
2 In a medium saucepan, sauté the tofu in the olive oil until the tofu is slightly brown. The
tofu will be wet and doesn’t brown easily. Sautéing for 4 to 5 minutes is enough, even if
the tofu doesn’t seem to brown up.
3 Add the zucchini, cover, and steam for 10 minutes or until the zucchini is soft.
4 Add the pasta, stir, and remove from the heat. Serve warm.
Tip: If the dish seems a bit dry, add a little more olive oil. You can also add a bit of shred-
ded cheese for extra flavor.
Red Beans and Rice
Red Beans and Rice can be a staple meal for toddlers because it’s high in protein and
complex carbs for energy. This dish also avoids the spice of many common versions. As
an added bonus, this dish freezes beautifully for a quick thaw and reheat for later use.
Preparation time: 25 minutes
Cooking time: 1 hour
Yield: Ten 1-cup servings
2 tablespoons vegetable oil for sautéing
1⁄2 cup onion, chopped
2 cups hot water
151⁄2 ounces canned kidney beans, drained
2 chicken bouillon cubes
2 cups minute rice, uncooked (or any quick-
cook rice)

1 Pour the oil in a large saucepan and add the onion. Sauté the onion until it’s slightly
brown. Stir in the water, beans, and bouillon. Bring the mixture to a boil.
2 Stir in the rice and cover for 5 minutes. Remove from the heat and let stand for 5 min-
utes. Serve warm.
Vary It! If you want to bump up the protein, add precooked crumbled soy sausage (less
spicy than regular sausage) to this recipe after you remove from the heat.
T Veggie Fritters
This recipe provides another creative way to help your child eat veggies. Serve this
dish not only as dinner but also as a side dish, or freeze the extra portions as a snack —
to be served hot or cold later.
Preparation time: 10 minutes
Cooking time: 10 minutes
Yield: About 7 servings (2 fritters per serving)
129
Chapter 7: First Steps and First Scheduled Meals: 12 to 18 Months
1 cup carrots, peeled and grated
1⁄2 cup zucchini, grated
1⁄2 cup yellow squash, grated
2⁄3 cup potatoes, grated
2 tablespoons flour
Vegetable oil for frying
Salt to taste
1 Mix the veggies in a bowl with the flour.
2 Form the mixture into 15 round fritters with your hands and place on a clean plate.
3 Heat 2 tablespoons of oil in a frying pan and fry the fritters for about 5 minutes (21⁄2 min-
utes on each side) on medium-high heat until fritters are golden brown on each side.
You can cook about three fritters at a time. After 3 batches, add more oil.
4 Remove each fritter from the pan and place it on a plate covered with paper towel in
order to absorb the excess grease. Lightly sprinkle with the salt. Serve warm or cold.

Apple-and-Turkey Meatballs
Apple-and-Turkey Meatballs use ground turkey meat — a healthy alternative and a great
source of protein! Toddlers generally eat these meatballs because the turkey is tasty
and meatballs are fun finger foods. Your child may also find meatballs fun to play with.
Beware a flying meatball at dinnertime!
Preparation time: 15 minutes
Cooking time: 10 to 15 minutes
Yield: 8 servings (3 meatballs per serving)
130
Part III: Big Changes Ahead: Feeding Your Toddler 
1 pound ground turkey
1 onion, finely chopped
3 tablespoons fresh breadcrumbs
1 small apple, peeled and finely chopped
1 egg, beaten
2 tablespoons thyme
Flour for coating
2 teaspoons vegetable oil
1 Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.
2 In a large bowl, mix the turkey, onion, breadcrumbs, apple, egg, and thyme.
3 Coat your hands with flour and use your hands to form 24 small meatballs. Spread more
flour on a plate and roll the meatballs in it until they’re lightly coated.
4 Heat the oil in a frying pan and sauté the meatballs until they’re golden brown, about 
10 minutes. If you use a 10-inch frying pan, you’ll be able to cook about five at a time.
Feel free to add a bit more oil between batches.
5 Place the meatballs in a casserole dish and cook for 15 minutes.
Tip: For parents who don’t want to cook with oil, thus making the meatballs healthier, skip
the sautéing and cook these meatballs in the oven without sautéing. Just extend the cook-
ing time another 10 minutes or so, and then check to make sure they’re done.
Tip: Double or triple your recipe and freeze the extra meatballs to keep on hand! Freeze
the meatballs without the flour coating.
Vary It! Serve Apple-and-Turkey Meatballs with spaghetti or almost any other dish, such as
rice. You can even eat them by themselves. Try serving these meatballs in a hot dog bun
with a little spaghetti sauce for an instant sub sandwich!

Bow-Tie Pasta with the Works
Farfalle (fahr-FAH-lay) pasta is the technical name for bow-tie pasta. But technicalities
aside, your toddler will love this dish because it’s tasty and colorful. See just how color-
ful this dish is in the color section of this book.
Preparation time: 25 minutes
Yield: Four 1-cup servings
131
Chapter 7: First Steps and First Scheduled Meals: 12 to 18 Months
1⁄4 pound bow-tie pasta
1 tablespoon butter
1 tablespoon flour
11⁄4 cups milk
1⁄4 teaspoon dry ground mustard
1⁄4 cup green peas (frozen is fine)
1⁄4 cup carrots, diced (frozen is fine)
1⁄2 cup grated cheddar cheese
2 slices (about 1 ounce) cooked ham, beef, or
chicken, diced
1 Cook the pasta according to the package directions.
2 While the pasta is cooking, melt the butter in a small saucepan and stir in the flour.
3 Whisk in the milk and mustard. Add the peas and carrots, bring back to a boil, reduce
the heat, and cook for 3 minutes.
4 Stir in the cheese and remove from the heat, continuing to stir until the cheese melts.
Add the meat to the mixture.
5 Drain the water from the pasta, and in a large bowl, toss together the meat and cheese
mixture with the cooked pasta. Serve warm.
Vary It! Substitute other vegetables, such as broccoli, zucchini, squash, and so on for the
peas and carrots.
Quick Cures for the Munchies
Healthy snacks are an important part of your child’s diet because they pro-
vide consistent nutrition throughout the day. That’s no problem when you’re
making them yourself! Give your toddler fun, quick, and healthy snack
options that’ll keep her happy. You’ll find snack and smoothie options
throughout this book, so be sure to look at other chapters as well, but the
snacks in this chapter are just right for your 12- to 18-month-old.

T Ants on a Log
This snack is a classic munchie that is fun to make with your little one. We’ve put a little
twist on this one that you may not be expecting. Celery and cream cheese are both
nutritious, and this recipe provides a dose of fun as well.
Preparation time: 5 minutes
Yield: 2 servings
132
Part III: Big Changes Ahead: Feeding Your Toddler 
1 celery stalk
2 tablespoons cream cheese
16 raisins
1 Wash and dry the celery stalk. Cut the stalk in half in the middle.
2 Fill the celery with the cream cheese, place the raisins in a line on the top of the cream
cheese, and serve.
Vary It! After your child is about 2 years old and you’re sure that peanuts don’t cause aller-
gies, try this recipe with peanut butter instead of cream cheese.
T Muffin and Applesauce
This quick and easy snack is healthy and almost always a hit! In fact, applesauce works
great as a topping for all kinds of meals, from muffins to waffles. Because most children
like applesauce, it’s a great topping to use.
Preparation time: 5 minutes
Yield: 2 servings
1 English muffin
1 tablespoon applesauce
Dash of cinnamon
8 raisins
1 Split the English muffin in half and lightly toast the two halves.
2 In a small bowl, mix the applesauce, cinnamon, and raisins.
3 Spread the mixture over the English muffin and serve warm.
Vary It! You can vary this recipe by using different bread options, such as pita bread or
even a graham cracker. If you use pita bread, toast it in a toaster oven just as you would
regular bread.

Orange Banana Smoothie
This quick and yummy smoothie works well for young toddlers and it’s full of complex
carbohydrates for energy. Your child will think this smoothie is a treat, but with plenty
of vitamins, you’ll know it’s a good snack option. Check out the color insert for a picture
of the final product.
Preparation time: 5 minutes

Good Eats for Your Active 
18-Month to 2-Year-Old
In This Chapter
 Preparing yourself to meet your 18-month- to 2-year-old’s
mealtime needs
 Jumpstarting your toddler’s day with breakfast
 Striking a balance between lunch and dinner
 Meeting the (occasional) needs of the sugar high
A
s your toddler continues to grow toward the
terrible twos, you’ll be amazed at the
changes. Your growing baby becomes more vocal,
mobile, and able to reason and understand what is
going on in the world around him. In fact, it’s often
at this time that new parents become a bit sad
because their once tiny baby is asserting his inde-
pendence (and sometimes defiance).
Rapid growth and change are healthy indications
that your child is developing normally and follow-
ing the transition from babyhood to childhood.
During this time, nutritional needs are changing as
well. Your toddler not only becomes much more diverse in what she’ll eat but
also more opinionated about the food she’s eating.
In this chapter, you’ll add some items to your child’s diet that weren’t
allowed before and discover new nutrition at this stage of the game. Put this
collection of tasty recipes to work in your kitchen.

A Whole Lot of Change and 
Even More Patience
Life involves change. Sure, you know that, but when you’re thinking about
your toddler, get prepared for a lot of change! Just when you think you have it
all figured out, your toddler grows and changes again.
The same can be said for your toddlers eating habits and nutritional needs.
You’re embarking on a virtual rollercoaster ride of change that requires even
more patience on your part. Don’t worry, though, we’re here to help you sur-
vive the ride.
Managing meals and mealtimes
A newborn baby is completely dependent on breast milk or formula for nutri-
tion, but things change quickly. You start introducing solids, still giving milk
or formula, but by 18 months of age, your baby is a true eating machine. The
digestive system matures and your baby’s nutritional needs take a turn. Milk
is still part of the diet, just not the whole diet. Here’s a quick rundown on
your child’s nutritional necessities at this age:
 Milk and other dairy: Your toddler needs only full-fat cow’s milk (whole
milk). Don’t use 2 percent, lowfat, or skim milk — the fat content is cru-
cial as well as the calcium. Serve 16 ounces of milk or dairy per day, but
try not to give more than this amount so your child will be encouraged
to eat other foods.
Some children love milk and will basically try to live on it if you let them.
So, monitor the amount of milk consumption to make sure that your tod-
dler is getting enough but not too much. Reserve milk and juice for
meals and snacktime, so your child doesn’t get full by randomly drinking
glasses of milk or juice.
 Grains: 3 ounces per day. Whole grain breads, pasta, brown rice, and
oatmeal are all good choices.
 Vegetables: 1 cup per day. Strive for a variety of vegetables, with plenty
of green, leafy veggies.
 Fruits: 1 cup per day. Strive for different fruits with any combination.
 Meat and Beans: 2 ounces per day. Lean meats, fish, and any kind of
beans are good choices.
Avoid sugary snacks for kids for the same reasons dentists warn you to avoid
these kinds of foods — tooth decay and empty calories. Get in the habit of
taking care of your child’s teeth now, including limiting sugary snacks and
using a consistent teeth brushing schedule. Also, avoid juice at bedtime; the
sugar attacks your child’s teeth while he sleeps.

What to do if your child is choking
At some point in your child’s life, he may choke
from overeating or eating too quickly and so on.
This moment can be every parent’s worst night-
mare. However, knowing what to do when your
little one is choking gives you more confidence
(and more time to help) in handling these worri-
some situations. Note: Our advice doesn’t 
substitute for a certified class, so we highly 
recommend taking one if you haven’t already
(see www.americancpr.com to find out
more about CPR training). That caveat aside,
here are our tips, which are consistent with CPR
guidelines:
 If your child is coughing and crying, let him
continue to cough it out. Don’t hit your child
on the back because the jolt may move the
food and cause a worse obstruction. Your
child should get his throat clear in a few
minutes; if he continues to have trouble, call
your doctor.
 If your infant can’t breathe (no coughing or
crying), lay him face down on your lap with
his head hanging down, keeping the head
lower than the chest (see the following
figure, A). With the heel of your hand, give
the infant up to five sharp blows on the back
between the shoulder blades (B). Then turn
the infant onto his back while supporting
the head and give up to five chest thrusts,
using two to three fingers over the lower
half of the breastbone (C and D). Alternate
back blows and chest thrusts until the
object is dislodged or the infant becomes
unresponsive. If your infant becomes unre-
sponsive, perform CPR and call 911.
 If your child (at least 1 year old) can’t
breathe, use the abdominal thrust method,
otherwise called the Heimlich maneuver, if
the child is responsive. If the child is unre-
sponsive, call 911. The operator will likely
instruct you to perform chest compressions
and to check the throat for lodged food.

In addition to the changes you’ll encounter with your wee one’s diet, the feed-
ing schedule may seem a little wacky too. One issue you’ll likely face is that
children often prefer smaller meals with snacks in between, instead of eating
three square meals a day. Your child may eat one good meal and seem pickier
at others. Don’t let this behavior overly concern you or frustrate you at this
point. Continue to have mealtime and offer your child meals, but if your tyke
seems to eat some meals better than others, don’t worry. Just make sure that
you’re offering healthy, wholesome snacks instead of chips or cookies.
Dealing with the “shoveling syndrome”
As your child grows, she may want to eat too fast and swallow without chew-
ing her food.
Naturally, the shoveling behavior is a choking hazard, so here are some tips
to help you out:
 Cut food into small pieces. Your child will have to do more work to
shovel the food in. Small pieces helps control the amount your child
takes in at one time.
 Offer small portions first. If your child has a serious problem with inhal-
ing his food, limit the amount of food on his plate, and then add more as
he eats.
 Eat with your child and model good chewing habits. Your child has a
tendency to mimic what you’re doing.
 Be careful with foods that tend to be choking hazards. Foods in this
category include bread, popcorn, nuts, and hard candy.
Handling tantrums at the table
You’ll notice that a furious monster may creep out of your child just before
she turns two. At this stage, children don’t have the emotional capability to
deal with frustrations that you or life in general impose, and as those feelings
build up, you’re likely to see a variety of reactions:
 An eruption of screaming and crying for what may seem like no apparent
reason
 A display of emotion (including flying objects) played out like a bad
soap opera
 A body thrown on the floor of the supermarket in a fit of rage
Any of these possibilities and more may occur every day for a period of
weeks at a time.
138
Part III: Big Changes Ahead: Feeding Your Toddler 

Keep in mind that as frustrating as tantrums are for you, your child is com-
municating in the only way she knows how. Just remember that tantrums are
normal and not a reflection on you or your offspring.
Feeding the fire
When it comes to food, you may find yourself at your wit’s end because at
this stage of the game, your child can eat most foods that you enjoy eating as
well, but oftentimes, he refuses. You’re dreaming of the time when you fix a
meal and everyone sits down at the table and lovingly enjoys the food
together. Keep dreaming; just kidding. No really, it can happen. You just need
to be firm and set some ground rules.
 Make meals that appeal to the entire family. Strive for a diet that pro-
vides a good balance of protein, vegetables, dairy, and grains.
 Enforce mealtimes. Eating together displays good eating habits for your
little one.
 Place the food on your toddler’s tray whether he’ll eat it or not. He may
pretend like he’s a busboy and sweep the food right off on the floor, but
continued efforts on your part show your kid that you mean business.
As much as you strive, you may inevitably encounter the stuck-in-a-rut syn-
drome, which happens when your child decides that he’s going to eat one or
two items, but that’s all. This decision is a common part of development and
not something you should be overly concerned about. It’s frustrating when
you work hard on a meal and it’s not eaten or is thrown across the kitchen,
but c’est la vie.
If your child is throwing a fit and will only eat a particular item at mealtime,
try the following tips:
 Make sure to include the beloved food item often with meals. Try to
mix the familiar with the unfamiliar.
 Include other options. Always include a variety of items to coincide
with the favored food.
 Eat the new food as a model for your child. This helps your child gain
an interest in the new food.
Toddlers eventually become bored with the same food over and over and
start trying other items. Although this period can last for a few months, even-
tually your toddler will move on to other foods.
Never try to bribe your child with any food to end his tirade. Using food for
rewards or even punishments can lead to a cycle of bad behavior. Your
youngster will use you in his moments of madness to get what he wants. He’ll
know that if he cries, you’ll give him a cookie, for example. Always keep the
concept of food separate from behavior — this rule sets up a healthy per-
spective concerning food now and in later years.
139
Chapter 8: Good Eats for Your Active 18-Month- to 2-Year-Old

In addition, bribing and force feeding may cause your youngster to like foods
less. Place foods on a plate in child-size portions and allow your child to decide
what and how much to eat. Remember, she may only eat one or two of the
items offered. Let her explore by touching, smelling, mashing, and tasting food
without it becoming a game. Exposure is more likely to intrigue your child.
Putting out the flames
No, we don’t suggest that you throw a bucket of water on your child during a
tantrum, although you may want to. Put that bucket down and walk away
slowly!
Your tiny tot will eat eventually. No matter how long the tantrum continues,
remember a few important guidelines:
 Don’t give in to unreasonable demands or negotiate with your scream-
ing toddler. She may scream her head off in her highchair for 15 or 20
minutes or wail in line at the grocery store for that candy bar, and you
may want to cave. Don’t do it!
 Don’t walk away. Walking away only makes your child feel more upset
and abandoned. Stay with her and even hold her until the fit passes.
Then try to explain to her what happened.
 Remember to keep your cool and be consistent. If your child is simply
having a meltdown because she’s not getting what she wants, you may
find that ignoring the tantrum helps more than applying negative atten-
tion. As your toddler discovers that a tantrum doesn’t really accomplish
anything, she’ll soon stop putting forth the energy.
Starting Your Day the Healthy Way
As your child continues to grow, breakfast is a continuing part of a healthy
lifestyle. The following recipes give you additional breakfast dishes that you
should consider serving to your child for good nutrition and variety. By this
age, children can handle more tastes and textures. Also, because they have
more teeth, children can chew more effectively. These recipes provide more
taste, texture, and require more chewing — all things that your child will
enjoy. Also, keep in mind that 18-month- to 2-year-olds can still partake of the
breakfast dishes in Chapter 7.

T Zucchini Pear Pancakes
Most children like pancakes, but you can work in a serving of vegetables and fruit first
thing in the morning with these pancakes made with zucchini and pears. Watch out —
you may find yourself loving these flapjacks just as much as your child may! This recipe
makes several servings, so freeze whatever your child doesn’t eat and reheat for later use.
Preparation time: 30 minutes
Yield: 10 servings
1⁄2 fresh pear, peeled, pitted, and coarsely
chopped
Dash of cinnamon
13⁄4 cups whole-wheat flour
1⁄4 teaspoon salt
13⁄4 teaspoons baking powder
2 egg yolks, beaten
4 tablespoons melted butter
11⁄4 cups whole milk
6 tablespoons pear juice
1 cup grated zucchini
Nonstick cooking spray
1 In a blender, puree the fresh pear and cinnamon and set aside.
2 In a separate bowl, stir together the flour, salt, and baking powder. Set aside.
3 In another bowl, mix the egg yolks, butter, milk, and pear juice. Pour the liquid mixture
into the flour mixture and blend until smooth. Stir in the grated zucchini until it’s
coated with the mixture.
4 Spray a griddle or frying pan with nonstick cooking spray and heat the pan on medium
heat. Spoon the batter into the pan to form 3-inch diameter pancakes. Cook until the
tops of the pancakes form bubbles. Carefully flip each pancake and cook until each side
is golden brown. These pancakes are best if cooked thin to help the zucchini cook 
thoroughly.
5 Remove the pancakes from the griddle (or pan) with a spatula and place on a plate and
cover with a clean towel or aluminum foil to retain heat. Continue the process of cook-
ing the batter until all pancakes are made. Remember to grease the pan with nonstick
spray in between batches.
6 After all the pancakes are made, place a serving of pancakes on a plate and spread the
pear puree on top of them. Serve warm.

Part III: Big Changes Ahead: Feeding Your Toddler 
1 egg
Salt and pepper to taste
1 strip of bacon
Cooking oil for greasing pan
2 slices whole-wheat bread
Pat of butter or butter spray
4 tablespoons applesauce
40 raisins
1 Whisk the egg in a bowl until well blended. Lightly salt and pepper and mix again.
2 Cook the bacon per package directions. Set aside.
3 Oil a frying pan and heat on medium-high temperature.
4 Spread the beaten egg with a spoon over both sides of the pieces of bread. Place the
bread in the frying pan and flip every minute or so, until the egg coating is light brown
on both sides of the bread.
5 Place the bread pieces on a serving dish and lightly spread butter over the top surfaces.
Spread the applesauce over the tops of the bread.
6 Create a circle on each piece of French toast with the raisins, which serve as a face.
Make the face outline cover most of the toast. Use raisins to create eyes and a nose, and
then use half of the bacon strip to create the mouth on each piece of toast. Cut the
bacon in the middle so that it will bend to make the mouth “smile.” Serve.
Vary It! Make this recipe without the “French toast” element. Just skip the egg and simply
toast the bread, and then start with Step 6.
Smiling French Toast
Create smiles when your French toast smiles back at your kids. Your children get a kick
out of the look of this toast, and you can smile as well because they’re getting a com-
plete meal. Enlist the assistance of your toddler to make the faces. This meal is one that
you can enjoy making and eating together.

Banana Custard for breakfast is delicious for both kids and adults, and it’s a healthy
alternative to other potential sugary choices.
Preparation time: 10 minutes
Yield: Four 1⁄2-cup servings
1 cup plain, full-fat yogurt
3⁄4 cup cooked oatmeal
3⁄4 cup prepared vanilla pudding
1 small banana, sliced
1 In a small bowl, stir together the yogurt, oatmeal, and vanilla pudding.
2 Spoon mixture evenly into two plastic cups. Place banana slices on top of the mixture in
each cup. Serve warm.

Munching in the Afternoon
Because your 18-month- to 2-year-old is often a snack eater, lunch can some-
times be a challenge, especially if your child has eaten breakfast and perhaps
a late morning snack. Yet, lunch is an important meal because you can use it
to provide balanced nutrition that your child needs throughout the after-
noon. These tempting dishes help your little one want to eat lunch, so put
them to work in your kitchen. Little Susie will love the taste, and you’ll feel
great about providing a healthy meal!

Chicken Quesadilla Triangles
This fun-to-eat food works well as lunch or a snack. It’s quick and easy, and you’ll be
nibbling at it as well! You can freeze the prepared quesadillas for use later. Just store
them in a freezer bag and simply reheat in the microwave when needed.
As you make this lunch, consider letting your toddler help you with the preparation.
Because quesadillas are made from assembling different parts, it’s the perfect meal for
your child to help with. This recipe is featured in the color section of this book.
Preparation time: 15 minutes
Yield: 4 servings
2 flour or whole-wheat tortillas (burrito size —
14 inches in diameter)
1⁄2 cup shredded cooked chicken
1 cup shredded cheddar cheese (or a mixture
of cheddar and mozzarella)
1 teaspoon melted butter
1 Preheat the oven to 400 degrees.
2 Lightly brush one tortilla with 1⁄2 teaspoon of butter and place the tortilla buttered side
down on a baking stone or cookie sheet.
3 Place chicken and cheese on the tortilla. Pile the mixture toward the center of the tor-
tilla to avoid leaks during cooking. Brush the second tortilla with the remaining butter
and place on top of the first tortilla, buttered side up.
4 Bake for 10 minutes or until the cheese melts.
5 Remove the tray from the oven and cut the tortilla in four even pieces, making triangles.
Serve warm.
Vary It! Substitute beef or ham for the chicken in this recipe. Make a vegan version using
grated carrots, zucchini, yellow squash, onions, and tomatoes.

Cornflake Chicken Bites
This lunch option served with some veggies may please your child, and it makes a great
snack, too. The cornflake coating provides a nice crunch, which is interesting to chil-
dren, and because it contains whole chicken breast pieces, you can feel good about
what’s on the inside.
Preparation time: 20 minutes
Cooking time: 25 minutes
Yield: About 10 pieces, 2 pieces per serving
2 cups cornflakes
1⁄2 cup shredded cheddar or mozzarella
cheese
1 split boneless chicken breast, cooked and
skinned
1⁄2 stick of butter
Nonstick cooking spray
1 Preheat the oven to 375 degrees.
2 In a medium bowl, coarsely crush the cornflakes. Don’t grind them into a powder. Add
the cheese to the cornflakes and mix.
3 Cut the chicken breast into bite-size pieces — about 10 pieces, depending on how large
you want them to be.
4 Melt the butter in a small saucepan or in the microwave in a microwave-safe bowl. Dip
the chicken pieces in the butter, and then press the chicken in the cornflakes and
cheese to make sure that the mixture sticks to the chicken.
5 Place the chicken chunks in a baking pan (sprayed with nonstick cooking spray) and
bake for 25 minutes or until the chicken is cooked through and no longer pink in the
center. You may need to turn the chicken after 10 minutes to keep the browning even.
Serve warm.

T Fruit Salad
This fruit salad works great as a side dish for lunch or dinner. Many parents never think
about cottage cheese for little tykes, but this healthy salad is a good alternative to other
basic salads, and the pineapple gives the whole salad a different taste. This recipe is
one that your toddler may need to try a few times in order to get used to the taste and
the texture. Freeze the leftovers and allow to thaw for a quick lunch option.
Preparation time: 10 minutes
Chill time: 15 minutes
Yield: Eight 1-cup servings
24 ounces cottage cheese
8-ounce container frozen whipped topping,
thawed
6-ounce package orange flavored gelatin mix
2 11-ounce cans mandarin oranges, drained
20-ounce can pineapple chunks, drained, or
you can finely chop two apples instead
Mix all the ingredients in a large bowl and chill for 15 minutes before serving.
Vary It! You can substitute other fruit options as desired (try adding some bananas).
Tip: If your little tyke is a little squeamish about the texture of cottage cheese, you can use
a mixer to blend the cottage cheese until the texture is more like sour cream.
Drumming Up Dinner
Dinner can often be a bit of a challenge for this age group. Kids that tend to
eat an afternoon snack are often uninterested in dinner, but these delicious
recipes help alleviate that problem.
Naturally, dinner is the last meal of the day, providing balanced nutrition for
your child before he goes off to sleep, so it’s important to work with your
child to establish a pattern of healthy meals and healthy snacks. Just remem-
ber that some children are often uninterested in dinner. If you’re having this
problem, watch out for oversnacking or milk or juice intake before dinner.
Work to establish a pattern that keeps your child from eating or drinking milk
or juice for at least an hour and a half before dinner.

3 Mix the soup and milk together in a bowl, then pour the soup evenly over the chicken.
Cover and bake for 25 minutes. Cut the chicken into bite-size pieces. Serve warm.
Tip: Consider heating a bit of cream of mushroom soup and spooning it over the chicken at
serving time to make the chicken even juicier.
T Cheesy Rice and Broccoli
If your child is a bit unhappy about broccoli, and let’s face it — sometimes kids scrunch
their noses at veggies — this cheesy rice mix should change those attitudes from grim
to glad. If you don’t serve this dish by itself, it also makes a great side.
Preparation time: 15 minutes
Yield: Six 1⁄2-cup servings
10-ounce package frozen broccoli florets
1 cup instant rice
1 cup water
1 cup shredded cheddar cheese
1 In a medium saucepan, combine broccoli, rice, and water.
2 Bring to a boil, and then remove from the heat and cover for 5 minutes. The water
should absorb into the rice and broccoli.

1 box of chocolate pudding mix
1 package of gummy worms, any kind
1 Make the pudding according to the package directions. Remember, always use whole
milk.
2 After the pudding has chilled, spoon a serving (serving size on package directions,
about 1⁄2 cup) into a plastic cup or dish.
3 Place two gummy worms on the top of the pudding. Press one end of the worms down
into the pudding slightly to make it look like the worms are crawling around in the pud-
ding. Serve with a spoon.
Vary It! Crumble a chocolate sandwich cookie and sprinkle it on the top of the pudding.
This variation makes the pudding look like dirt! Your child may think it’s funny and be
intrigued enough to eat it.
Tip: This recipe contains a lot of sugar. Cut down on the sugar by purchasing sugar-free
pudding or sugar-free gummy worms.
Gummy Worm Mud
Around the age of 2, children start to enjoy things that seem gross. This fascination is a
normal part of a child’s development and in many ways will last into the teen years.
This snack is made from chocolate pudding and a couple of gummy worms, which you
can buy in the snack aisle of your grocery store. This recipe is best for children 2 years
old and older because gummy worms can be a choking hazard for smaller children.

Setting a good mealtime example
From ages 18 months to 2 years old, children
begin to mimic their parents. That’s quite a
change because in the early months of life, 
your baby seems mostly oblivious to what
you’re doing, aside from the occasional smile.
However, children soak up information like a
sponge throughout their entire life, so learning
primarily comes from you, the parent.
As your child grows, remind yourself constantly
that your every move is being watched, and
behaviors, both good and bad, pass from you to
your kid. Check your behavior and make sure
that you’re modeling what you want to see.
Keep the following points in mind:
 Your child is rapidly studying and learning
your language at this time. Even if your
child doesn’t speak well, he knows what
you’re saying, and he’s in the process of dis-
covering words and speech behavior
(screaming, quiet voices, and so on) from
his primarily caregivers. Use mealtime as
an opportunity to teach your child words
about eating and food (also, remember to
watch your language — toddlers can pick
up bad words at this age.)
 Your child is naturally curious about food.
As you eat, try to model good eating habits.
Let your child see you eating a wide variety
of healthy foods, and he may want to try
those foods as well. Get out of the habit of
giving your child one food while you eat
something else.
 Model table manners and behavior. Your
child often looks like he’s slept in the food
that he’s eaten, but modeling table behav-
iors (eating with silverware at the table) and
manners (saying please and thank you) will
soon rub off on your youngster.

 Smiling your way through breakfast
 Focusing your efforts on lunchtime
 Winding down the day with dinner
 Icing the cake: Desserts
You very well may find yourself running head
to head with your 2-year-old at the table, but
you have plenty of options and steps to take to
make mealtime a blast for your youngster and
nutritionally balanced to boot.
Throughout this year of your child’s life, you’ll find
that she’ll become more and more opinionated
about what she’ll eat. She may want only mac and
cheese every meal of the day, every day of the
week, and she may become hopelessly devoted to
peanut butter and crackers. Don’t jump on the
phone to call Dr. Phil, though — the pickiness and
preference for the same foods over and over are
normal. To guide you in your efforts to feed your
child the best foods (without losing your sanity!),
in this chapter, we give you the rundown on what’s
most important to keep in mind when preparing nutritious meals for a bal-
anced diet, how to cook for your 2-year-old to keep him happy yet healthy,
and how to get your little one involved so mealtimes are bonding times as
well. To get you started, we give you plenty of tempting recipes that help you
and yours get over this nutritional hump.

The Great Balancing Act: Mealtimes
versus Your Sanity
Because you’re likely to have your hands full with your 2-year-old child, you
may find it difficult to focus on the types of foods you serve your tot as well
as the amounts you feed him — you may end up in situations where you’re
tempted to slide a box of cookies his way, just to keep him happy and fed. But
fret you shouldn’t — this section tells you all you need to know about feeding
your 2-year-old so you know what to expect and how to entice your growing
child with the right amounts of healthy foods, all the while maintaining your
sanity.
Welcome to the land of small 
meals and snacks
Small meals and snacks are likely becoming the norm for your 2-year-old —
your toddler prefers several small meals a day at this point, as she’s not quite
ready for the three-meal-a-day plan. In fact, eating three smaller meals a day
and nutritious snacks in-between is healthiest for adults as well, but we tend
to eat three larger meals in order to manage our time and lives better. Your
toddler, however, eats when he’s hungry, which tends to be every few hours.
During this stage of life, you should continue offering three balanced meals
per day with balanced, healthy snacks in-between. Keep in mind that young
children play hard, so they burn a lot of energy and may suddenly seem to be
starving to death. This is why balanced meals with healthy snacks are so
important.
Figuring out mealtime foods 
and portion sizes
One of the questions that parents often face with children who are 2 years
old is “How much do I give my child in a typical meal?” Your child doesn’t
need as much as you may think, but it’s important to give the right amount.
Giving too little food may cause your child to finish mealtime with a tummy
that’s not quite full, which means she’ll be ready for another mini-meal in an
hour or two. Too much, and your child may become overwhelmed with the
amount of food on her plate and then won’t want to eat at all. We had this
issue with our youngest daughter. If her plate was too full, even with foods
that she liked, she tended not to eat well. A full plate is overwhelming to
some kids, so keep this point in mind as you make your child’s plate.
158
Part III: Big Changes Ahead: Feeding Your Toddler 

Food portions
Remembering how much food to provide your toddler at mealtime is as easy
as following the “1⁄3 cup rule,” which is also recommended by the USDA’s
MyPyramid for Kids (for more information on MyPyramid for Kids see
Chapter 2). Generally, 1⁄3 cup of any dish is enough to satisfy your child’s
hunger and his nutritional requirements. If he child wants more, you can
always give him an additional portion after he’s eaten his initial serving —
keep in mind, though, that seconds should usually be half of 1⁄3 cup, because
most of the time your youngster’s tummy will be almost full after the initial
serving.
Don’t get in the habit of giving your child too much food or he’ll get in the
habit of eating everything. Naturally, this behavior can lead to obesity. At this
stage in the game, portion control becomes important.
Beverage portions
In addition to keeping track of the quantity and types of food you’re giving
your child, you also need to monitor drinking habits. Because your child is so
active, she’s likely to act like a camel at this age, meaning she’ll tank up on
liquid before or during the meal, especially if you serve juice or some other
drink your child likes. The end result: Your child fills up on liquid instead of
eating food, which means her nutritional needs won’t be met, and she’ll also
be hungry again sooner.
To avoid filling up on liquid before mealtime, limit your child’s drinks to
water the hour before a meal — she’s less likely to overfill on water than on
sugary (and tasty!) juice. Don’t worry about how much water you give —
your child can’t drink too much water!
Ensuring nutritional balance
Like growing children of any age, 2-year-olds have some specific nutritional
needs, but you’ll also find that a well-balanced diet for a 2-year-old is much
the same as a well-balanced diet for adults. Strike a balance between protein,
grains, vegetables, and dairy. If you’re wondering what your child needs per
day in terms of servings, keep these handy points in mind:
 Grains: 4 to 6 servings of bread, cereals, or starches, such as 1⁄2 cup
brown rice, cereal, or a slice of whole-wheat bread. Remember, stick
more to whole-wheat products for the best nutritional value.
 Vegetables and fruits: Four to six 1⁄2-cup servings per day. Include a vari-
ety of different fruits and veggies.
 Milk or other dairy products: Four 4-to-6-ounce servings; for example,
one serving may be a glass of milk or perhaps a 1⁄2 cup of yogurt. At 
age 2, it’s a good idea to go ahead and move your child to lower fat milk,
such as 2 percent.
159
Chapter 9: Tasty Meals for 2-Year-Olds

 Meat and beans: Two 1⁄2-to-1-ounce servings; for example, one serving
may be a 1-ounce serving of fish or chicken breast. Your child can have
red meat, and you don’t have to over worry about what types of meat
you give. However, fish and chicken breast are good choices.
 Fats or oils: 1 to 3 teaspoons per day. This extra category is recom-
mended by the USDA, yet you’re not going to feed your child a teaspoon
of oil. You don’t have to worry about meeting the needs of this category
if you feed your child a balanced diet because the oil needs will be met
within the diet. Just remember that oils, such as olive oils, are a healthy
part of the diet and your child will get the oil content from condiments
such as mayonnaise and salad dressings.
Overcoming pickiness and 
making mealtime fun
It’s not rocket science, but sometimes getting your youngster at this age to
eat what you cook may prove challenging, to say the least. You may have a
bit of a tough time getting your 2-year-old to eat healthy foods — or even to
eat at all. If you approach your little one with some patience and keep her
interests in mind, your ride may be a much smoother one. Always keep in
mind that it’s your responsibility to offer a good variety at scheduled times,
but it’s your child’s decision whether to eat what is offered and how much.
Also remember that it may take 10 to 20 exposures to a food before a child
will even want to try it.
160
Part III: Big Changes Ahead: Feeding Your Toddler 
Managing under- or overweight children
When your child reaches the age of 2, you may
get concerned that your chunky baby is becom-
ing a lean machine. This thinning out is normal,
and children this age often shed the baby fat
and become a bit skinny looking as they grow
taller and play harder. Keep offering balanced
meals and healthy snacks. If your child is eating
and has plenty of energy, you’re in good shape.
If your precious one frequently seems a little
dreary and refuses to eat, make an appointment
with your pediatrician.
On the other end of the spectrum are over-
weight children. Most children who are over-
weight at 2 years of age are heavy because of
higher fat diets and a lack of activity. Lose the
sugary snacks and fatty foods, such as chips,
and start preparing the meals, snacks, and
desserts found in this book. Also, limit television
and other sedentary activities. Your child needs
to be up and moving instead of being passively
entertained. Your pediatrician may also give you
additional dietary suggestions that help you
make healthy lifestyle changes for your child,
depending on your child’s specific health needs.
If you are concerned that your child is too
skinny or overweight, always check with your
pediatrician.

Rely on visual appeal
Especially at age 2, children become very sensitive to how their food looks. If
a dish doesn’t visually appeal to your child, for whatever reason, your child
may have problems taking a bite. In fact, even some of the dishes he liked
when he was younger may suddenly be under scrutiny.
To overcome picky eater syndrome, it’s a good idea to think visually as you
prepare your child’s food. Toddlers respond well to fun shapes and sizes,
especially anything that seems unusual, and they like vivid, bright colors. Of
course, not every dish or food lends itself to such creativity — you can’t win
every battle with presentation alone! Here are some ideas that we’ve found
helpful with our little ones, and you can find more information and some spe-
cific recipes for picky eaters in Chapter 14:
 Use fruit to create a smiling face on a plate (and string cheese for hair).
 Use a cookie cutter to cut out fun shapes in your pancakes.
 Garnish healthy smoothies and shakes with a little fruit, such as grapes
or thin strawberry slices.
 Use carrot sticks and other raw veggies to build a fence or a wall around
the meal.
 Include color in the meal to attract your child’s eye.
Get your child involved
Another way to entice your toddler at the table is to let her help out with 
the prep work. Even at age 2, your child isn’t too young to help in the kitchen.
Children gain knowledge by watching you, so consider allowing your 
toddler to
 Help arrange napkins on the table
 Stir a mixture with a wooden spoon
 Pour the dry contents into the bowl
 Scrape the bowl with a spatula
 Help wash the dishes or place them in the dishwasher
In Chapter 11, you find some great recipes that lend themselves to youngster
participation.
If your toddler isn’t ready to help with any prep work or isn’t interested yet,
you can even have him play with spoons and other safe kitchen items — your
kid may love to make noise with a pot and a wooden spoon. While you get a
meal ready, tell him what you’re doing and use the time to build his vocabu-
lary, introducing each item and its name as you cook, and he discovers more
about eating and food.

Curing Morning Tummy Grumbles
At this stage of the game, your child can go two ways with breakfast: he’ll
either love it or hate it. These recipes are geared toward getting your child to
love it! The following recipes are often favorites for 2-year-olds. You have a lot
of flexibility with food. Food allergies and intolerances aren’t so much of a
concern at this point, and your child has gotten used to more textures, fla-
vors, and colors of food.
162

Piggy in a Blanket
Toddlers enjoy these tasty little roll-ups, mostly because they’re fun to eat. This quick
recipe is easy to make and a healthy choice for a breakfast food to help start your little
one’s day on the right foot. Add a side of fruit and you have an even more nutritious
meal.
Preparation time: 5 minutes
Cooking time: 15 minutes
Yield: 16 roll-ups, 2 per serving
1 can refrigerated croissant dough
8 slices American cheese
16 sausage links
2 tablespoons butter
1 Preheat oven to 375 degrees.
2 Unroll croissant dough, separate pieces, and cut each triangle piece in half lengthwise
(so each piece is still a triangle).
3 Cut each slice of American cheese into 2 strips.
4 Wrap each sausage in a strip of the cheese and then wrap in the croissant. To wrap the
croissant, place the sausage at the bigger end of the triangle and roll the dough toward
the tip of the dough. Place the wraps with the tip facing down on a cookie sheet. This
placement keeps the dough from unrolling during cooking.
5 Melt the butter in a microwave-safe container. Lightly brush all sides of the dough with
the butter. Bake for 15 minutes, turning about halfway through cooking time to ensure
even browning. Remove from heat and allow to cool. Serve warm.

T Cheesy Eggs and Toast
This kid-friendly version of a traditional breakfast meal — eggs and toast — is easy to
make, and the kids enjoy the visual appeal made with different shaped cookie cutters.
You may already know that getting kids to eat can sometimes be a challenge. So it’s
helpful to make the food interesting on their level (See “Overcoming pickiness and
making mealtime fun,” earlier in this chapter, for suggestions on making meals interest-
ing.) Check out the color section of this book for a picture of the final product.
Preparation time: 10 minutes
Tools: Small cookie cutters, any shape
Yield: 1 serving
2 slices whole-wheat bread, toasted
Butter
1 large egg
1 slice American cheese
1 Shape the toast into bite-size pieces with the cookie cutters. Lightly butter the toast
pieces.
2 In a small bowl, beat the egg until well blended. Pour the egg in a frying pan, stirring as
it cooks. When eggs are about halfway cooked, add the American cheese. Finish cooking
the eggs; remove from the heat.
3 Place eggs in a pile in the middle of a child-size plate. Arrange toasted shapes around
the eggs. Serve warm.

T Fruity Toast Sticks
Need a quick and healthy breakfast for your hungry toddler? These toast sticks are
great for the whole family because they contain whole-wheat bread, peanut butter, and
fruit. They taste yummy and provide good nutrition to start the day.
Preparation time: 5 minutes
Yield: 8 servings (2 sticks per serving)
164
Part III: Big Changes Ahead: Feeding Your Toddler 
4 slices whole-wheat bread
2 tablespoons peanut butter
Raisins
1 large banana, sliced
Honey
1 Spread each piece of bread thinly with the peanut butter. Slice the bread into 4 sticks.
2 Add desired amount of raisins on top of the peanut butter. It’s a good idea to push the
raisins down into the peanut butter.
3 Place the toast sticks on a baking tray and toast them to your desired darkness in a
toaster oven. Remove from the toaster and add the sliced bananas. Drizzle with honey.
Allow toast to cool and serve.
Scaling the Midday Hump: Lunchtime!
Lunchtime meals are important for your toddler because he’s active during
the morning hours. Keep in mind that many toddlers are a bit resistant to
lunch if they’ve eaten a good breakfast and a snack, so make sure that your
child isn’t grazing during the morning hours and tanking up on milk.

Tex-Mex Roll-Ups
With chicken breast and veggies, this dish is a true, balanced meal wrapped in a tidy
package. Head to the color section to see the finished product.
Preparation time: 15 minutes
Yield: 2 roll-ups, 2 servings
2 flour or whole-wheat tortillas
1⁄4 cup refried beans, divided
1⁄4 cup diced cooked chicken breast, divided
1⁄4 cup grated cheddar cheese, divided
1⁄4 cup shredded lettuce, divided
1⁄4 cup chopped tomato, divided
1⁄4 avocado, peeled, pitted, and diced, divided
1 Place each tortilla on a microwavable plate and spread half of the refried beans evenly
on each. Sprinkle equal amounts of the chicken and cheese on the tortillas. Microwave
for 15 to 30 seconds until cheese melts.
2 Allow to cool slightly. Add the remaining ingredients and roll up each tortilla.
Vary It! You can use regular pinto beans instead of refried beans, but the refried beans act
as a “glue” to help hold the ingredients in the roll-up.
A good lunch helps your child have a better afternoon by keeping solid nutri-
tion flowing through her body. She’ll also more likely take a good nap with a
full tummy. Take a stab at the recipes in this section to beef up your
lunchtime menus.

Cheesy Ham and Peas
Cheese always gives a dish a creamy texture, which is appreciated by children. With
this recipe, the cheese gives the ham extra flavor and helps your child eat his peas,
which children often resist. It’s a quick and easy lunch!
Preparation time: 20 minutes
Yield: Eight 1⁄2-cup servings
2 cups frozen sweet peas
1 cup diced, cooked ham
2 tablespoons whole milk
1 tablespoon butter
3 slices American cheese
Salt and pepper to taste
1 Cook the peas according to package directions, and then put the peas in a microwav-
able casserole dish. Gently stir in the ham chunks.
2 Add the remaining ingredients and salt and pepper to taste.
3 Cover the dish with a moist paper towel and place in the microwave. Cook on medium-
high heat for 2 to 3 minutes, stirring every minute.
4 Remove the dish from the microwave and gently stir. Let set for 2 to 3 minutes before
serving. Serve warm.
Crazy Open-Faced Ham Sandwich
With this simple recipe, you’ll give your child something healthy to eat and some fun to
boot — kids love the smiley face on top. Have your child help you with this recipe.
Preparation time: 20 minutes
Yield: 1 serving
1 teaspoon mayonnaise
1 slice whole-wheat bread
1 slice deli ham
1 string-cheese stick
1 baby dill or sweet pickle, sliced in thin,
round circles
1 thin slice tomato

1 Spread the mayonnaise on one side of the bread and place the ham slice on top of the
mayonnaise.
2 Separate the cheese stick into thin strings. Place the strings of cheese around the top of
the bread to look like hair for your smiley face.
3 Place two slices of pickle on the ham for the eyes of the sandwich. With another slice of
pickle, cut out a triangle for the nose. Place the nose on the sandwich.
4 Cut the slice of tomato in half to create the smile for the face, and complete the smiley
face by placing the tomato on the sandwich. Serve.

Chicken and Veggie Quesadillas
Quesadillas are a great way to mix nutritious meat and veggies in a package that chil-
dren are favorable to. We like quesadillas as a lunch item because of the good nutrition
and quick cook time. Add this recipe to your arsenal!
Preparation time: 10 minutes
Yield: 4 wedges, 2 pieces per serving
6-inch tortilla, flour or whole-wheat
3 tablespoons shredded cheddar cheese
1 tablespoon cooked mixed vegetables
1–2 tablespoons of finely chopped, cooked
chicken breast
1 Place the tortilla on a microwave-safe plate. Sprinkle all the ingredients evenly on the
tortilla. Fold the tortilla in half and microwave for 40 seconds or until cheese melts.
2 Cut the quesadilla into four wedges and serve warm.

T Stuffed Apple
This recipe is a bit different than standard lunch fare, and kids are often intrigued by it
because they get to dig the inside of the apple out with a spoon. At first glance, the
stuffed apple seems like a snack, but because it contains peanut butter and fruit, it pro-
vides a nutritional lunch with plenty of vitamins and protein. You can also use the
Stuffed Apple as a snack, or you can combine it with other recipes, such as the
Vegetable Rounds recipe.
Preparation time: 20 minutes
Yield: 1 serving
1 medium apple
2 tablespoons smooth peanut butter
1⁄2 ripe banana, peeled
1 teaspoon cream cheese
Raisins, optional
1 Wash the apple and core it, creating a hole in the top and coring out the meat. Make
sure there is no hole in the bottom. The idea is to scoop out 1⁄2 to 3⁄4 of the inside to
create a mostly empty center, essentially turning the apple into a “bowl.”
2 In a small bowl, finely mash the banana. Add the peanut butter and cream cheese and
mix well.
3 Spoon the mixture into the apple. You can top the hole with raisins if you like. Serve
with a spoon.
Tip: If you don’t want to waste the inside of the apple you have carved out, just mash the
good parts into small pieces and mix them into the peanut butter and cream cheese. This
option adds a little more crunch to the mixture!
Tempting Your Toddler at Dinnertime
As adults, we look forward to dinner. Dinner signals the end of the day (for
most of us) and food tends to be relaxing. From your child’s point of view,
dinner is simply another meal, and depending on how well your child has
eaten the other meals of the day, she may be more or less hungry. This
behavior is normal, so keep providing healthy meals and snacks.

In this section, we include dinnertime meals that are tempting to children,
combining common ingredients with a few new twists. In fact, you may find
that other members of your family enjoy these dishes as well.

Pizza Meatloaf
This meatloaf isn’t Grammy’s dry meatloaf. This meatloaf packs a juicy punch! Your 
toddler, along with the rest of the family, is sure to enjoy this unique and delicious 
dish. As an added bonus, the leftovers, which are freezable, make delicious meatloaf
sandwiches.
Preparation time: 15 minutes
Cooking time: 30 to 40 minutes
Yield: 8 servings
Nonstick cooking spray
1 pound extra-lean ground beef or ground
turkey
1⁄4 cup breadcrumbs
1 egg
1 cup pizza sauce, any variety
1 teaspoon dried Italian seasoning
1 cup grated mozzarella cheese
1 Preheat the oven to 425 degrees.
2 Spray a medium-size casserole dish with nonstick spray.
3 In a medium mixing bowl, combine the meat, breadcrumbs, and the egg. Add 1⁄4 cup of
the pizza sauce and the Italian seasoning and mix well. Add 1⁄2 cup of the cheese and mix
well. Pat the mixture together to create a loaf and place it in the casserole dish.
4 Bake for 30 to 40 minutes. You may need to adjust the bake time slightly depending on
the size of your casserole dish. Deeper casserole dishes typically require a bit more
bake time.
5 Remove the dish from the oven and test the meatloaf to make sure that it’s cooked all
the way through (no pink showing). You can test it with a meat thermometer, or simply
cut a portion of the meatloaf and check for a brown center.

Corn Chowder with Beef
This recipe is quick and easy and a great meal, especially on those cold winter days.
This meal is very hearty, and with a simple side dish of salad and bread, you have a
complete meal. The rest of your family will enjoy this recipe as well!
Preparation time: 15 minutes
Cooking time: 50 minutes
Yield: Ten 1-cup servings
1 pound ground beef
1 onion, chopped
5 potatoes, washed, peeled, and cubed
5 cups water
15-ounce can creamed corn
151⁄4-ounce can whole kernel corn, undrained
2 cups milk
1 In a skillet over medium-high heat, cook the beef with the onions until the meat is com-
pletely brown and no pink remains.
2 In a large stock pot, cook the potatoes in 5 cups of water (add a bit more if necessary),
until they’re tender — approximately 20 minutes.
3 Add both kinds of corn, milk, and the beef mixture to the pot of potatoes. Simmer for 
30 minutes and serve warm.
Capping Off a Good Meal with Dessert
Dessert is a course that typically comes at the end of the meal (although you
may have been caught a time or two trying to dip into the pudding or swipe a
cookie hot out of the oven). The word dessert comes from the Old French
word desservir, meaning “to clear the table.” While your little one may only
want to clear the table in one fell swoop (and not by eating) for the sweets to
come, remind him that dessert is a treat. You can feel good about serving the
desserts found in this section because while the sweetness tempts your
youngster, the healthiness of each recipe ensures that your child is getting
the proper daily nutrition. Put the following year-round desserts to work for
you in your kitchen.

Frozen Peanut Butter Bananas 
on a Stick
These treats are a perfect dessert because most kids love peanut butter and bananas,
and they love popsicles, too, which these are, in a way. Let your little one help you
make this treat!
Preparation time: 5 minutes
Chill time: 4 hours in the freezer
Yield: 1 serving
1 small banana
2 tablespoons creamy peanut butter
1 Peel and cut the banana in half lengthwise.
2 Place two tablespoons of peanut butter on one of the halves using a butter knife or a
plastic spatula if your kid is helping. Smooth peanut butter from one end to the other.
3 Place the other half of the banana on the half covered with the peanut butter to make a
“sandwich.”
4 Insert the popsicle stick into the end of the banana.
5 Wrap the banana in a piece of wax paper and place it in a freezer bag or wrap it in alu-
minum foil.
6 Place the banana in the freezer for 4 hours.
7 Remove the banana from the freezer and peel away the layers of foil and wax paper.
Tip: Make sure you use wax paper or the peanut butter will stick to the foil.
Vary It! Dip the banana in melted chocolate before placing it in the freezer.

on each side of the ice cream.
3 Top the yogurt or ice cream with the sliced strawberries; sprinkle with coconut, and
top with a dollop of whipped cream. Serve with a spoon.
Banana Split
If you love banana splits, you’ll love this version as well. You can use ice cream as usual,
but you can also make this recipe healthier with frozen vanilla yogurt. Combined with
the fruit, it’s a delicious cold treat that your toddler will love.
Preparation time: 10 minutes
Yield: 1 serving
Fruity Shake
This fruity shake is made with yogurt and fresh fruit, so it’s a healthy alternative to
other snacks.
Preparation time: 5 minutes
Yield: Two 8-ounce shakes
6-ounce can pineapple juice, chilled
6-ounce can peach nectar, chilled
1⁄2 cup cold milk
1 small banana, peeled and sliced into small
pieces
6 strawberries, washed, dried, and sliced
1 Place all the ingredients, except three slices of strawberries, in a blender and blend
until smooth.

works well for children as young as 9 months.
Preparation time: 5 minutes
Cooking time: 10 minutes
Yield: Four 1⁄2-cup servings
Frozen Fruit Slush
Slushy desserts are often a favorite for children. Notice how many fast-food restaurants

nutritious than the fast-food version.
Preparation time: 5 minutes
Chill time: 2 hours in the freezer
Yield: About 8 servings, depending on the size of cups you use
1 cup white rice, cooked

Welcoming Your
Child to the Big
People’s Table

In this part . . .
A
bout the time that your child reaches the age of 3, he
begins to eat more foods that the whole family loves.
Although you’ll continue to deal with some age-appropriate
issues, your recipe repertoire can easily grow and change.
In this part, we provide plenty of recipes to help you keep
up with your growing weed (tot, rather), from ages 3 to 5.
You discover how fun it is to cook with your child (and 
get some appropriate recipes to involve your kid in the
kitchen — see Chapter 11). Take a look at Chapter 12 for
ideas devoted to meals for the entire family.

A
s your child reaches the ages of 3 to 5, you’ll
likely find that mealtimes get easier — your
child can more clearly communicate to you what
he wants, and he’s more likely to be open to a
greater variety of foods because he has more
options in terms of tastes and texture. These years
can also be challenging, though, because your
child may be more opinionated about what he will
or won’t eat. From a nutritional point of view,
these years continue to be important as your child
grows and matures, so you need to keep an edu-
cated eye on what you’re serving him and how
much. With delicious and nutritious recipes, such
as those we provide in this chapter, you can make
sure that your child is getting what he needs for
healthy growth with little to no fuss on his end.
Leaving the Toddler Years Behind
By the time your child turns 3 years old, the often-difficult toddler behavior
starts to pass. You find that your child’s temper tantrums seem to be subsid-
ing and even completely passing, which makes mealtime all the more pleas-
ant for everyone involved. As your child continues to grow, she needs a
healthy and varied diet, much like yours. You have more flexibility with the
foods you offer because your child already has a full set of teeth. However, a

3- to 5-year-old isn’t mature enough to create her own diet, so eating nutri-
tiously continues to be an important part of the parental focus. In the follow-
ing sections, consider your child’s needs — in regard to both structure and
nutrition — at this stage of life.
Settling into a routine
At this stage, three meals a day with a few healthy snacks in-between con-
tinue to be the normal eating schedule for your tyke. Your child may be in
daycare and starting pre-kindergarten during this time of his life, and you
won’t be there to feed him every time his tummy grumbles, so chances are
that your child will even be better behaved and happier in general with the
schedule you establish early on. Children this age tend to prefer the same
basic routine every day — ever wonder why he wants to read the same books
and watch the same cartoon movie over and over?
Naturally, you need to serve breakfast, lunch, and dinner. Ideally, at this age
your child should have about three healthy snacks per day, 2 hours before
each meal. Try to avoid the habit of giving your child a snack an hour or less
before a meal because your child is less likely to eat the actual meal. Also, be
wary of providing too much milk or juice — children at this age will panhan-
dle for them in lieu of eating food!
Here are a few tips to help you keep your child’s eating schedule on track:
 Keep a consistent schedule. As much as possible, breakfast, lunch, and
dinner need to be at the same time every day. This routine helps your
child develop a desire to eat. This process does take time.
 Eat together. Try to make mealtime a family event, so it’s something
everyone does together at the same time. Mealtime is as much about
socialization as it’s about food, and your toddler learns from older chil-
dren and adults.
 Avoid the exotic. Children tend to like the same things over and over.
This is a normal part of a child’s development and isn’t something you
should be overly concerned about. Keep mixing in new foods, but now
isn’t the best time for foods that are exotic.
 Don’t fight it. Some days your child eats well at mealtime and others he
doesn’t. This behavior is normal, so don’t let the table turn into a battle-
ground for your kiddies. If your child won’t eat, don’t worry. Finish your
meal, and then at the next snacktime, offer something healthy.
 Watch out for milk and juice. If your child tanks up on milk and juice an
hour before mealtime, he won’t eat the meal. Try to keep the hour
before mealtime free of milk and juice or any kind of snack. Offer water
between meals, as little Billy may be thirsty.
182
Part IV: Welcoming Your Child to the Big People’s Table 

 Be patient. As with all things, patience with your child’s eating habits
and routine is something that takes time and should be handled with
gentleness on your part. Food shouldn’t be a negative issue with your
child or a source of discipline or reward.
Upping the variety in your child’s diet
Your child’s diet at this age and beyond becomes much like yours. You need a
good variety of nutrition instead of the same thing every day, which is really
true from the time your baby starts eating a variety of solids. The good news
about this age is that you have more flexibility because your child can simply
eat a larger variety of foods. Keep mixing it up! Offer new foods and be sure
to serve a familiar food with an unfamiliar food. This tactic makes the addi-
tion of new foods easier for you and your little one.
At the same time, don’t make life more complicated than necessary. If your
child can’t stand lima beans, choose another kind of beans or vegetable alto-
gether. In other words, choose your food battles wisely. Even if your child
doesn’t like a particular food, it’s still a good idea to offer it from time to time,
because your child’s likes and dislikes change a lot. Who knows — lima beans
may suddenly be the new trendy food!
So what does your 3- to 5-year-old need in terms of nutrition and servings? As
a general rule, you can follow the USDA’s MyPyramid for Kids (head back to
Chapter 2); specifically, a 3-year-old of average weight and activity level
should have the following amounts per day:
 Grains: 4 to 5 ounces per day, at least half coming from whole grains.
Typical servings equal one slice of bread, a cup of cereal, or 1⁄2 cup of rice
or pasta.
 Vegetables: 11⁄2 cups of any vegetables.
 Fruits: 1 cup (or a bit more) of any fruit.
 Milk: 2 cups. If your child doesn’t like milk, serve 1 cup of yogurt or 2
ounces of cheese, but continue to offer milk at meals for exposure.
 Meat and Beans: 3 to 4 ounces per day.
One common situation that parents face is when a child loves milk — not just
likes it, but really loves it. This desire is great for your child’s bone growth,
but remember that your toddler shouldn’t have milk as a substitute for food.
In fact, cow’s milk, although rich in calcium, is low in iron and other nutri-
ents, so your child needs the varied nutrition that well-rounded meals and
snacks bring. (Generally, by age 3, you can use 2-percent or skim cow’s milk.)
If your child frequently wants milk but not food, limit the amount of milk you
offer throughout the day and don’t offer milk at mealtime.
183
Chapter 10: Enticing Your 3- to 5-Year-Old

Odds are that between the ages of 3 and 5, your child becomes more inter-
ested in sugary cereals and other not-so-nutritious foods due to television
commercials and other such advertising. You can acknowledge those desires,
but continue to provide healthy meals instead of giving in to the marketing
hype. It’s okay to allow your child to have these products from time to time,
but don’t let them become the norm.
The Most Important Meal: Breakfast
Breakfast is the most important meal of the day for your growing child, so
always be sure to offer it and keep the meal enticing. Remember to offer your
child healthy meals, but don’t force your child to eat. With the breakfast
dishes in this section, however, you’ll probably find that your child will
gobble them down with no encouragement from you!

Part IV: Welcoming Your Child to the Big People’s Table 
T Peanut Butter and Jelly Waffles
This heavier breakfast provides a kid favorite of peanut butter and jelly with a waffle.
Remember to include options for a meal that is healthier: high protein, whole-wheat
waffles, natural peanut butter, and pure-fruit preserves.
Preparation time: 10 minutes
Yield: 1 serving
2 waffles, homemade or any prepackaged
variety
1 tablespoon peanut butter
1 tablespoon jelly or preserves
1 Toast the waffles according to the package directions, or cook homemade waffles as
desired.
2 Spread the peanut butter on one side of one waffle and the jelly on one side of the other.
3 Place the waffles together to form a sandwich, cut into four squares, and serve warm.
Tip: Make extra waffles (if you’re whipping them up from scratch) and freeze them for a
quick reheat when your child is requesting this recipe.

185
Chapter 10: Enticing Your 3- to 5-Year-Old
2 slices whole-wheat bread
1⁄4 cup ricotta cheese
1⁄2 cup fresh peaches, peeled and sliced
1⁄8 teaspoon cinnamon
1 On one slice of the bread, spread the ricotta cheese and top with fruit. Sprinkle the cin-
namon on top of the fruit.
2 Place the bread on a baking tray and toast both slices in a toaster oven until the plain
slice is brown and the slice with cheese has melted cheese.
3 Remove from the heat, and place the plain slice of bread on top of the fruit to form a
sandwich. Cut into squares or other shapes as desired. Serve warm.
T Peaches and Cheese Sandwich
Have you heard of pineapple and cottage cheese for breakfast and even tomatoes and
cottage cheese for lunch? Well, this delicious breakfast combines a different kind of
cheese with fruit: fresh peaches and ricotta cheese. The two flavors offset each other
well, as the cottage cheese versions do, and the dish also provides a boost of protein to
get your child going in the morning. Whip up this concoction for a healthy snack, too.

Part IV: Welcoming Your Child to the Big People’s Table 
T Blueberry Whole-Wheat Waffles
Our children love waffles, and that seems to be a common theme among kids every-
where. These waffles are whole wheat, giving your child more nutrition than a typical
waffle, and the sweet blueberry taste is sure to be a hit.
Preparation time: 25 minutes
Yield: 5 servings
3⁄4 cup flour
3⁄4 cup whole-wheat flour
4 teaspoons baking powder
2 tablespoons sugar
2 eggs
1 cup milk
2 tablespoons vegetable oil
1⁄2 cup fresh blueberries, washed
1 Preheat the waffle iron.
2 Sift together both types of flour, the baking powder, and the sugar.
3 With a mixer, blend in the eggs, milk, oil, and blueberries to create a smooth batter with
a few small lumps of blueberries.
4 Spray the waffle iron with nonstick cooking spray and pour 1⁄4 cup of batter on the iron;
cook for about 2 minutes, repeating this step until you run out of batter. Serve warm
with regular maple syrup or flavored syrup, if desired.
Nifty Lunches for a Growing Kid
Children at this age love creative lunches, because food is more interesting to
eat when it looks cool. You’ll find that the recipes in this section help you
incorporate a variety of lunch options that your 3- to 5-year-old will love.

Chapter 10: Enticing Your 3- to 5-Year-Old
Cheeseburger Soup
If your child is a bit resistant to eating soup, this delicious and filling soup may do the
trick. Because the soup is so cheesy, it’s not like eating plain old soup. In fact, our kids
aren’t big soup fans, but they love this hearty lunch.
Preparation time: 1 hour
Yield: Four to six 1⁄2-cup servings
1⁄2 pound lean hamburger meat
1⁄2 cup diced onion
11⁄2 cups canned, stewed tomatoes
11⁄2 cups frozen sweet corn
2 cups peeled and diced potatoes
2 teaspoons Italian seasoning
1 teaspoon salt
2 cups reduced-sodium beef broth
3 tablespoons butter
1⁄4 cup flour
13⁄4 cups milk 
2 cups shredded cheddar cheese
1 In a medium-size skillet over medium-high heat, brown the hamburger meat and onion.
Remove the skillet from heat and drain the excess grease from the meat. Place meat and
onion mixture in a medium-size pot. Add the tomatoes, corn, potatoes, Italian season-
ing, salt, and beef broth.
2 Bring the mixture in the pot to a boil, and boil for 2 minutes. Reduce the heat to a
simmer. Simmer for 15 minutes or until potatoes are cooked all the way through.
3 Melt the butter in a microwave-safe bowl, and stir in the flour. After the flour and butter
have been thoroughly combined, stir in the milk until the mixture is smooth.
4 After the soup has simmered for 15 minutes, gradually whisk in the butter mixture.
Bring to a boil, stirring constantly. Boil for 2 minutes and reduce the heat to a simmer.
5 Stir in the cheese, and stir constantly until cheese melts. Remove from the heat and
allow the soup to sit for 5 minutes before serving.

Homemade Stuffed Corn Dogs
Corn dogs seem to be a favorite for kids of all ages (even you big kids: a.k.a. adults).
One great aspect of this recipe is control: You control what goes in the coating for the
dogs because you make it yourself. You’ll also enjoy this recipe because it freezes well,
which saves you time later when you need a quick meal for a fussy child.
Preparation time: 15 minutes
Cooking time: 35 minutes
Tools: Rolling pin
Yield: 10 servings
Nonstick cooking spray 
12⁄3 cup flour
1⁄3 cup yellow cornmeal
3 tablespoons sugar
1 teaspoon baking powder
1⁄4 teaspoon salt
1⁄4 teaspoon dry mustard
2⁄3 cup warm water
2 tablespoons vegetable oil
10 turkey or all-beef hot dogs
10 slices American cheese
10 wooden Popsicle sticks
2 tablespoons milk
1 Heat the oven to 350 degrees. Spray a cookie sheet with nonstick cooking spray.
2 In a medium bowl, combine the flour, cornmeal, sugar, baking powder, salt, and dry
mustard. Stir in the water and oil. Continue to stir until the dough pulls away from the
sides of the bowl.
3 Sprinkle some flour on a clean, dry surface, and remove the dough from the bowl and
place it on the floured surface. Lightly flour your hands, and knead the dough for 4 to 6
minutes. Dough will become smooth. Place the dough back in the bowl and cover with a
clean towel. Let the dough rise for 10 minutes.
4 Remove the hot dogs from the package, and with the tip of a sharp knife, cut 4 slits
lengthwise along the hot dog. Make sure that the slits don’t cut all the way through the
hot dog because you still have to insert the Popsicle stick.
5 Cut each slice of cheese into 4 thin slices. Stuff the slices into the slits of each hot dog.
6 Remove dough from bowl and place on lightly floured surface. Roll dough out with a
floured rolling pin. Cut strips of dough into 5-x-4-inch rectangles. You don’t have to be
exact. Keep in mind you will need to have 10 strips of dough (one for each hot dog).
7 Gently insert a Popsicle stick into each stuffed hot dog, about half way. Wrap each
stuffed hot dog in a strip of dough. Tightly press edges together to make sure that you
have a tight seam.

8 Brush corn dogs on all sides with milk. Place the corn dog seam side down on prepared
cookie sheet.
9 Bake for 35 minutes or until golden brown. Remove from heat and allow to sit for 5 min-
utes before serving. Remember, the corn dogs contain melted cheese inside; you don’t
want your child’s mouth to get burned by the melted cheese that will come out when
they bite into it. Serve with your child’s favorite condiment.

T Vegetable Chow Mein
Chow mein is a great lunchtime meal, and if you introduce foods such as chow mein
early, you may greatly expand your child’s food repertoire. Another great point: Chow
mein can easily find its way into your menu more often than you may think. Stir-fried
veggies can work as an entire meal, as they do in this recipe, but they also work great as
a side dish for all kinds of other recipes. This recipe is quick and easy and is featured in
the color section of this book.
Preparation time: 30 minutes
Yield: Five 1-cup servings
1⁄4 pound fine Chinese egg noodles
11⁄2 tablespoons sesame oil
1⁄2 peeled and crushed garlic clove
11⁄3 cups shiitake mushrooms
11⁄4 cups sugar snap peas
1⁄2 cup baby corn on the cob, cut into small
bites
4 green onions, finely chopped
1 cup chopped zucchini
4 tablespoons soy sauce
1 tablespoon brown sugar
1 Cook the noodles according to the package directions. Drain and set aside.
2 In a large frying pan or wok, over medium-high heat, heat the sesame oil. Add the garlic
and stir fry it for about 20 seconds, and then add the mushrooms, peas, and corn. Stir
fry for 4 minutes.
3 Add the onions and zucchini and cook for 5 minutes, stirring regularly. Add the soy
sauce and brown sugar and stir well for 1 to 2 minutes. Stir in the noodles and serve.

toaster oven until the cheese melts. Cut the burrito into four pieces and serve warm.
Vary It! Serve the roll-ups with a dipping sauce, such as cheese or ranch dressing.
Grown-Up Dinners Fit for a Child
Dinner is always a great way to end the day, and as a parent, you may find
yourself spending more time on preparing dinner for your family than on 
any other meal. The toddler dinners in this section are all tasty and full of
nutrition — the perfect way to end the day.
Meat and Veggie Kebabs
We love kebabs because they have a beautiful visual appeal for both children and adults
(for more suggestions on the appearance of meals, see Chapter 18). This recipe makes
two small kebabs on toothpicks. Serve these to your toddler with a side of pasta and
you’ll have a healthy, tasty meal!
Let your child help out with the preparation for this recipe. He’ll enjoy poking and
spearing the meat and veggies with the little toothpicks. Because the order of ingredi-
ents isn’t important, your child can make many different combinations of kebabs.
Preparation time: 15 minutes
Yield: 2 kebabs, 1 per serving
4 small chunks cooked, skinless chicken, ham,
or turkey
2 large black olives
2 cherry tomatoes
2 bite-size chunks yellow squash or zucchini
2 tablespoons melted butter
Spaghetti sauce for dipping
Southwestern Tortilla Roll-Ups
Get a taste of the Southwest with this quick meal! This recipe gives you plenty of cook-
ing flexibility, because you can vary the ingredients however you like. Get your toddler
involved: She’ll have a good time helping you make this quick and easy lunch.
Preparation time: 10 minutes
Yield: 1 serving

1 Set the oven to broil.
2 Thread the meat, olives, tomatoes, and squash or zucchini onto two toothpicks in any
order.
3 Place the kebabs on a foil-lined baking dish and brush all sides with the melted butter.
4 Broil for about 3 minutes or until the vegetables are slightly browned. Serve your
kebabs warm with a side of spaghetti sauce for dipping.
Tip: Use small cocktail sausages instead of chunk meat. The sausages are precooked,
which will speed up the preparation of the meal.
Vary It! Adjust the ingredients as desired. Use different veggies or meats. Or go all vegetar-
ian. Mix it up and have some fun!

Super Quick Chicken Enchiladas
Chicken enchiladas are a popular dish among all ages, but you’ll find that 3- to 5-year-
olds are a bit sensitive to spices and flavors. Therefore, this recipe is blander for your
toddler’s taste buds. This freezer-friendly recipe has the added bonus of a quick fix, 
so make extra for those times you’re in a hurry and when your kid needs something to
eat, now!

T Veggie Burritos
Kids often like eating burritos because they like to eat with their hands. Although we
aren’t advocating a total abandonment of table manners, sometimes it’s just more fun to
leave the silverware in the drawer. These burritos are easy to make, and you can adjust
the ingredients depending on what you have on hand. Isn’t flexibility a wonderful thing?!
Try out this recipe and see the reaction you get from your children.
Preparation time: 15 minutes

4 tablespoons water
1⁄2 garlic clove, crushed
1 chicken breast, cooked and diced
1⁄3 cup grated carrot
1⁄4 cucumber, grated
1 Prepare the pasta according to package directions.
2 While the pasta is cooking, in a medium bowl, combine both oils, the peanut butter, soy
sauce, water, garlic, and chicken. Mix well.
3 Drain the pasta and add to the mixture. Add the carrot and cucumber and stir. Serve
warm.
Tantalizing Toddler Treats
We love desserts (who doesn’t?), and your child will enjoy a sweet treat from
time to time. We recommend that you don’t let dessert become a daily habit
in your home, because doing so sets up the expectation that all meals should
end on a sweet note. Instead, use these recipes periodically, no more than
twice per week.
In this section, we’ve included some of our favorites, and they’re all rather
easy to make. Enjoy!
Chicken Lo Mein
This mild lo mein makes a great dinner meal (or even lunch) because it’s full of nutrition
and quick to make. This recipe may stretch your child’s palatal interest, but it’s bland
enough to entice a 3- to 5-year-old. The peanut butter taste makes this one a hit with
kids.
Preparation time: 15 minutes
Yield: Six 1-cup servings

Cupcake Family
This basic cupcake recipe takes on a new meaning when you and your child decorate
the cupcakes to represent the members of your family. The time spent in the kitchen
gives you quality time with your little one. You’ll love talking with your child about what
each person in the family looks like and how you should decorate the cupcake to repre-
sent your Uncle Steve. As you cook with your child, expect a lot of fun and laughter.
Preparation time: 40 minutes
Yield: 12 servings
18.5-ounce box yellow cake mix, any brand
16-ounces container vanilla frosting
Food coloring, any color
3.14-ounce package plain M&M candies
2 red licorice bootlaces, cut in 2-inch pieces
3 ounces plain chocolate
1 Make the cupcakes according to the package directions. Allow them to cool.
2 Mix the frosting and add the food coloring, whichever color you choose, if desired. Ice
the cupcakes.
3 Add M&M candies for the eyes and noses and cut pieces of the licorice to form the
mouths.
4 In a small bowl, melt the chocolate and then drizzle it on the cupcakes to form hair. You
can add beards and mustaches in the same way. Serve.
Vary It! Vary the decorations in any way you like. Use the chocolate drizzle to add
glasses, dimples, and any other family characteristics. You can also use strawberry topping
to create red hair or butterscotch to create blonde hair. The fun is trying to create a resem-
blance of each family member.
Tip: A piping bag makes the icing decorations much easier to form. Consider picking one
up at your favorite discount store.

Part IV: Welcoming Your Child to the Big People’s Table 
11⁄2 cups hot water
11⁄2 cups sugar
11⁄4 cups freshly squeezed lemon juice
1 cup cold water
1 Combine the hot water and sugar in a saucepan and cook over medium heat for 5 to 8
minutes, until syrupy.
2 Allow the syrup to cool slightly, and then add the lemon juice and cold water and mix
well. Pour the mixture into Popsicle trays and freeze until firm, about 2 hours.
Lemon Ice
When the hot summer days leave your 3- to 5-year-old sweaty and tired, this quick
lemon ice treat will be a welcomed, refreshing surprise.
Preparation time: 30 minutes
Chill time: 2 hours in the freezer
Tools: Popsicle trays
Yield: About 5 servings, depending on the Popsicle trays used
Double-Chocolate Éclair Pie
Any chocolate lover in your family is sure to love this éclair pie, and the good news for
you is you can prepare it in only minutes! This is one of our kids’ favorites.
Preparation time: 25 minutes
Chill time: 1 hour
Yield: 15 servings
2 sleeves graham crackers
5.1-ounce package instant vanilla pudding
21⁄2 cups cold milk
8 ounces thawed whipped topping
16 ounces milk chocolate cake frosting 
(2 containers)
1 Cover the bottom of a 9-x-13-inch baking dish with a layer of the whole graham crack-
ers. You’ll need to break some of them into pieces in order to cover the bottom.
2 Remove the lid and foil seal from one container of frosting and microwave on high for
30 to 45 seconds.

3 Carefully remove the frosting from the microwave and stir. Pour the frosting over the
layer of graham crackers in your baking dish.
4 In a large mixing bowl, whip the pudding mix and milk for 3 minutes on high speed with
an electric mixer. Gently fold in the whipped topping.
5 Spoon the pudding mixture on top of the frosting and graham cracker layer in the
baking dish. Add a layer of whole graham crackers on top of the pudding layer. Again,
you’ll need to break a few crackers into pieces to completely cover the pudding layer.
6 Remove the lid and foil seal from the second container of frosting and microwave on
high for 30 to 45 seconds. Carefully remove the frosting from the microwave and stir.
Pour the frosting over the top of the graham cracker layer.
7 Place the dessert in the freezer for 1 hour. Loosely cover the dish with foil so the foil
doesn’t stick to the chocolate. Cut and serve.
Tip: You can serve this dish after freezing for one hour, but it’s better if it chills in the refrig-
erator overnight because the graham crackers become soft.

C
ooking with your little one is a great activity
that has many parents discovering the benefit
of quality time spent together. Our kids love to
cook with us in the kitchen, and we highly recom-
mend that you make it a regular activity in your
home as well.
Keep in mind that your child generally won’t be
able to get involved in the cooking process until
the age of 3. However, the kitchen can be a fun
place even for younger children. Let your young-
ster play with spoons and other safe kitchen items
while you’re cooking, and explain the processes as
you go along so you’re still routinely spending
time with your tots while you’re in the kitchen.
We know what you may be thinking: Is cooking
with a child a complicated, potentially disastrous
combination? It certainly could be, but with the
simple, fun-to-prepare recipes in this chapter, you
can pretty much bank on the fact that it won’t be.

The Benefits of Cooking with Your child
As you think about spending time in the kitchen with your youngsters, you
can probably think of several immediate benefits — primarily the extra time
you’ll get to spend together. As your child helps you cook, she’s more likely
to be willing to try new foods as she helps prepare them, and she’ll under-
stand why cooking is important. Yet, there’s more to these immediate bene-
fits than meets the eye.
You get quality time together
Spending quality time with your children is one of the most important
aspects of being a parent. Sure, you need to take care of countless other
details to raise your youngster, those being absolutely essential as well —
feeding your baby, changing his diapers, that sort of thing. But a growing
child has emotional and psychological needs, too, and when you can kill two
birds with one stone, so to speak, showing your child that she’s important to
you by spending quality time with her and getting a meal ready at the same
time, you’re doing an excellent job of multitasking (a concept well familiar to
most parents).
Another great aspect of cooking is the artistic nature of it, the process of cre-
ating something and enjoying the end product. So when you get your child
involved, you’re not only taking care of routine business as well as spending
time together, but also you’re creating together. If you use the recipes in this
chapter, the process, as well as the final result, will be rewarding to you both.
You can give your child a solid 
nutritional foundation
If you prepare healthy meals with your child alongside you, you can teach a
lot about what foods are healthy and what foods should serve as an occa-
sional treat. As you cook healthy meals with little Joey, he’ll become more
familiar with individual items in the kitchen. Teach him about veggies, grains,
milk products, meats, and other foods.
Use this time to educate him on the food pyramid (we discuss the
MyPyramid for Kids in Chapter 2) and why these groups of foods are impor-
tant for good health.

Part IV: Welcoming Your Child to the Big People’s Table 

You help to instill a love of cooking
If you love to cook, chances are that someone initiated that interest and you
caught on — and you may want to do the same for your child. Your youngster
can become active in the kitchen even as a toddler simply by playing with
spoons. As your little one grows, he can start helping you with simple tasks,
such as pouring ingredients into a bowl. Young children love to organize
things and help out when they feel like they can. These simple “hands-on”
tasks and spending time with you in the kitchen may lead to a lifelong love of
cooking.
You help develop language 
and motor skills
The kitchen is a learning laboratory for your child. Think about it: Basically
everything you do in school you put to work in the kitchen. From language to
math to art, the kitchen is arguably the most interdisciplinary room in your
house. As you get involved in meal preparation, be sure to think in terms of
education. Instead of simply preparing food, try to reinforce various skills.
Keep these ideas in mind:
 Language: Focus on new words. Teach the names of ingredients and the
names of different kitchen tools (such as “blender” and “spatula,” or
whatever you call them in your native tongue). Practice teaching new
words and reiterating old ones each time you’re in the kitchen. Don’t try
to teach everything at once, though; focus on a few key items, and when
your child can easily recognize them, call them by name, and tell you
what they’re used for, move on to a few new words.
 Math: The kitchen is the perfect place to work on basic math skills, such
as addition and subtraction. Even if your son is only 3 years old, you can
help him practice counting by asking questions such as “How many eggs
do we have?” Older children can work with recipe items and amounts,
which is often great addition and subtraction practice.
 Sequence: Because most recipes require that you complete a series of
steps in order to create them, the kitchen is the perfect place to focus
on following directions and helping your child discover that order is a
common (and important) part of any task.
As you work through a recipe, it’s important that you read the ingredi-
ents and steps out loud with your kid, in much the same way that you’d
read a book. This action reinforces reading and learning and helps your
toddler understand how the entire recipe works as a whole. In other
words, don’t just give your kid the pieces of the whole while you assem-
ble the recipe — instead, let her enjoy the entire experience.
201
Chapter 11: Cooking with Your Little One

 The five senses: The kitchen is the perfect place to explain and explore
the five senses. Children are hands-on learners by nature, and the kitchen
is a good place to work on texture, smell, and sight. Ask your child what
she thinks of the various ingredients and then of the finished product. By
having her describe them to you and helping her along the way, you’re
increasing the number of descriptive words in her vocabulary.
 Cause and effect: Especially at ages 4 and 5, toddlers begins to grasp
relationships and how one thing affects something else — a prime time
to talk about cause and effect. You can discuss what happens to dough
when it goes into the oven, for example, or what may happen if you
leave the butter out of a recipe and put an apple in instead.
As you cook with your child, you help him develop fine motor skills as well.
Let him mix, flip, or knead, for example, and show him how to manage differ-
ent utensils — he’ll love it.
Taking Precautions before You Begin
The kitchen can be a fun place for your children, but it can also be danger-
ous. Before you get your youngster involved in cooking, take some precau-
tionary measures to make sure that the kitchen is safe, including the
following:
 Lock the cabinets and drawers. Make sure that all cabinets and drawers
are outfitted with locking mechanisms that allow you to open the cabinet
but not your curious kid.
 Keep out all poisonous substances. You shouldn’t keep poisons of any
kind in the kitchen. The list includes household cleaners, ant or pest poi-
sons, and detergent, bleach, and so on. Put all household cleaners and
other hazardous items in a utility room or other safe area away from
your children and away from all food.
 Carefully monitor the tasks you let your kids do. Almost all recipes
(including some of the recipes in this chapter) require the use of a knife,
so you need to take a look at each recipe and determine what tasks you
need to accomplish and what tasks you can delegate. At ages 3 and 4,
toddlers shouldn’t use any electric appliances. By age 5, he can start
with the electric mixer because it’s a safe appliance (and by age 5, he’s
strong enough physically to manage it).
 Tell your child what she can and can’t eat. Use your time in the kitchen
to explain which ingredients are good to eat by themselves and which
ingredients aren’t good unless they’re in a recipe. For example, raw eggs
aren’t healthy and don’t taste good, and that bottle of vanilla extract
smells wonderful, but it doesn’t taste good on its own.
202
Part IV: Welcoming Your Child to the Big People’s Table 

 Beware the bacteria! Never allow children to handle any potential 
bacteria-carrying food, such as raw eggs or meat. This task should be
left to the adult.
Getting Started: The Game Plan
As you’re getting ready to cook, take note of a few tips that will help the
process go smoothly. After all, when you cook with your child, you want the
event to be positive for both of you, and you can help make that happen by
first getting your ducks in a row. Consider the following steps:
1. Choose the recipe.
Before you do anything, choose a recipe that you want to cook with your
little tyke, and take a look at the ingredients to make sure that you have
everything on hand. You may want to allow your child to be a part of the
selection process as well. If you do, give her a choice of three options,
instead of overwhelming her with a book of choices.
2. Prepare the work area.
Your kitchen is set up for you — not your kids. With that thought in
mind, you may have to do more of the preparation at the kitchen or
dining room table. Another option is to get your hands on a bar stool so
your child can work next to you at the counter.
3. Open this book.
We recommend that you keep this book (or — gasp! — another cookbook
of your choice) on the counter as you cook. It’s a positive moment for
your child to see you learning and following instructions from a book.
4. Get all ingredients and tools ready.
You should get everything ready before you call the kids into the
kitchen. When they arrive in the kitchen, review all the ingredients and
cooking tools.
5. Dole out the tasks.
If you have more than one child and want to involve them all in the meal
preparation, split up the tasks based on age and what each child is able
to do. We highly suggest that you don’t have more than four kids helping
you out at one time, though — if you have a big family, consider alternat-
ing who gets to help out at different meals. Too many people in the
kitchen tend to create confusion, and too many tasks to oversee at one
time may lead to botched recipes and accidents.
6. Wash your hands.
Before you get started, teach good kitchen hygiene. Everyone should
wash their hands thoroughly.

Preparing Main Meals and Sides
Although you may tend to gravitate toward desserts when you cook with
your child, you may like cooking some main meals as well. In fact, we recom-
mend that you take this approach instead of letting every cooking time be
about desserts and fun foods, because you want to convey a balanced
approach to cooking. The recipes in this section are particularly good
choices because they aren’t overly complicated, and they provide different
levels of activity that kids can help with.

11⁄2 cups warm water
1 package yeast
1 tablespoon sugar
1 tablespoon salt
2 cups whole-wheat flour
4 cups flour
Nonstick cooking spray
1 beaten egg
1 In a large bowl, mix water, yeast, sugar, and salt. Stir in wheat and white flours with a
wooden spoon to form dough. Knead the dough until smooth. (See Figure 11-1 for the
illustrated process. Remember to place the dough on a floured cutting board before
kneading and use small amounts of flour to dust the dough as needed if it gets sticky.)
2 On a flour-dusted table or cutting board, roll out the dough until it’s about 1⁄2 inch thick.
Cut and form into any desired shapes. Allow the dough to sit for 30 minutes so it can
rise a bit.
3 Preheat the oven to 425 degrees. Spray a cookie or baking sheet with nonstick cooking
spray. Place shapes on cookie or baking sheet, and then brush dough with a beaten egg
and add a sprinkle of salt.
4 Bake the dough for 15 minutes or until golden brown. Allow the pretzels to cool before
removing them from the pan — they’re fragile when hot! Serve slightly warm.

Fruit Kebabs
These quick and easy kebabs are a healthy snack, and the fact that the fruit is on a
kebab makes the snack even more interesting to your child. Children like to remove one
bite at a time. Because you’re using toothpicks, we recommend that helping hands 3
years old and above help with this recipe because of the potential danger. Keep in mind
that you can also freeze this recipe for a frozen fruit treat. Check out the kebabs in the
color section of this book (and try to keep yourself from drooling).
Preparation time: 5 minutes
Yield: 7 servings
6 banana slices
6 peach slices
6 apple slices
6 pineapple slices
3 cherries
Thread the fruit on toothpicks as desired. Serve with supervision.
Vary It! Brush the fruit with a bit of honey for an extra tinge of sweetness.
Yogurt Pineapple Pops
With a simple Popsicle tray, you can make all kinds of pops with your children. Because
you’re making these treats from scratch, you control the ingredients, so you know what
is going into your little one’s tummy. Experiment with all kinds of varieties.
Preparation time: 10 minutes
Chill time: 2 to 3 hours in the freezer
Tools: Popsicle tray
Yield: 6 servings

Tip: Multiply this recipe easily and store extras in the freezer for a quick snack for the little
ones.

Yummy Valentines
Think about when you were a kid. You raced out to the store with one or both of your
parents to pick out the perfect paper valentines to pass out to your classmates. Many of
those cute little cards had pictures of candy hearts and heart cookies. Did the pictures
look so good that you wanted to eat them? Well, while eating the paper may add a little
fiber to your diet, why not make real edible valentines for your family and friends to
enjoy? This recipe works great for children 2 and older.
Preparation time: 15 minutes
Yield: 1 serving
1 whole graham cracker
Red icing
Candy hearts
Decorating gel
Place the graham cracker on a plastic or paper plate and cover the cracker neatly with
red icing. Outline the graham cracker with candy hearts or other candy decorations.
Use the decorating gel to write a valentine message in the center. Serve.
Tip: These crackers get soggy after a few hours, so they’re best enjoyed shortly after they’re
made. If you’re sharing with others, whip them up shortly before a Valentine’s Day party or
use this recipe as an activity for all the kids to enjoy.
Vary It! If you’re using this recipe for a kid’s party, use different colors of icing or get white
icing and food coloring so the children can whip up their own colors. Have different kinds
of Valentine’s Day candy on hand as well.

Chocolate and Peanut Butter 
Bird Nests
This old recipe representing renewal and rebirth still provides great holiday fun and
doesn’t require any baking. Easter is a lively springtime holiday, and your kids will enjoy
the fun they have making these bird nests. Make sure to reserve this recipe for children
2 and older. If you don’t eat them all at once (we highly discourage overindulging!), you
can freeze the extra treats for later use.
Preparation time: 30 minutes
Chill time: 15 minutes
Yield: 15 servings
1 cup butterscotch chips
1⁄2 cup peanut butter chips
1 tablespoon shortening
11⁄2 cups chow mein noodles, coarsely broken
Marshmallow birds for garnish
1 Line a cookie sheet with wax paper.
2 In a medium microwave-safe bowl, microwave the butterscotch, peanut butter chips,
and shortening on high for 1 minute. Stir well and add additional time, if necessary,
until all ingredients are melted and well blended. Add chow mein noodles and stir to
coat the noodles.
3 Drop heaping spoonfuls on the cookie sheet and form slightly to create a bird nest
shape. Adjust the size of the bird nests as desired, which naturally impacts the yield.
4 Let the nests stand until firm. Garnish with marshmallow birds, which are typically
available at any grocery store during the Easter season.
5 Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate (at least 15 minutes) until ready to serve.

Hidden Treasure Cupcakes
Your child will love making these Easter cupcakes because they hide a chocolate egg
inside. The jelly beans present a choking hazard, so this recipe is intended for children
older than 3 years. If you like the idea of these cupcakes but have toddlers under age 3,
leave out the jelly beans. You can store the extra cupcakes in an airtight container for 5
days or freeze them for later use.
Preparation time: 30 minutes
Tools: Muffin pans and paper liners
Yield: 24 servings
Shortening for greasing
21⁄4 cups all-purpose flour
21⁄2 teaspoons baking powder
1 teaspoon salt
2⁄3 cup margarine, softened
1 cup packed brown sugar
3⁄4 cup white sugar
2 eggs
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
11⁄4 cups milk
24 small chocolate eggs or kisses
16-ounce container strawberry frosting
Jelly beans
1 Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Grease 24 muffin tins or use paper liners for easier
cleanup.
2 Sift together the flour, baking powder, and salt. Set aside.
3 In a large bowl, cream together the margarine, brown sugar, and white sugar until light
and fluffy. Beat in the eggs one at a time, and then stir in the vanilla. Beat in the flour
mixture alternately with the milk, mixing until incorporated.
4 Fill each muffin cup 1⁄3 full, and place the chocolate candy in the center of each. Top with
the remaining batter until the cups are 2⁄3 full.
5 Bake the cupcakes for 18 to 20 minutes or until golden brown. Remove from the oven
and allow to cool. Ice with strawberry frosting and garnish top with a few jelly beans.
Serve.

6-ounce package flavored gelatin 
(any flavor desired)
Shortening
Decorating gel
1 In 1 cup of boiling water, add unflavored gelatin and stir until the gelatin is completely

2 After the mixture cools, mix in the whipped topping. Add another cup of boiling water,
and then stir in the flavored gelatin and mix well.
3 Pour into a lightly greased 9-x-13-inch baking pan and refrigerate for two hours. In order
to make the eggs easier to remove, consider lining the dish with plastic wrap.
4 Cut gelatin mixture into egg shapes and decorate with decorating gel. Serve.
July 4th recipes
July 4th is a time to celebrate and have fun, and it’s the perfect opportunity
to cook something festive with your child. Here are a couple of fun recipes to
get you started.
Gelatin Eggs
This easy recipe is perfect for spending some quality time with your children during the
Easter season. Have your 2-year-old (or older) help out with the prep on these eggs.
Preparation time: 30 minutes
Chill time: 2 hours in the refrigerator
Tools: Egg-shaped cookie cutter
Yield: 7 servings (2 treats per serving)

217
Chapter 11: Cooking with Your Little One
12 sugar cookies (premade, homemade, or
from premade dough), cut into star shapes
16-ounce container vanilla frosting
Red and blue food coloring
1 Prepare cookies according the package directions and cut them in star shapes by using
a cookie cutter. You can use any size cookie cutter you want, but the larger shaped stars
are easier to decorate.
2 Divide the icing into three different bowls. Place 2 drops of red food coloring into one
bowl and 2 drops of blue food coloring into another bowl. Mix the coloring in and add
more food coloring to get the right red and blue colors.
3 Using three different piping bags, decorate the cookies alternating red, white, and blue
stripes. Serve.
Tip: Purchase store-bought sugar cookies to save the time of baking your own, and then use
the cookies cutter to make the star shapes.
Star and Stripes Cookies
Simple cookies become festive with the right icing. Kids love the colorful look of these
treats. This recipe works well with children over 2 years of age.
Preparation time: 30 minutes
Tools: Star-shaped cookie cutter
Yield: 12 servings

Part IV: Welcoming Your Child to the Big People’s Table 
Quick Flag Cake
Make a cake that looks like a flag without a lot of fuss. Your child will love the colorful
design and it’s a great teaching opportunity as well because you can talk about the
American flag: what it represents, its shape, and the meaning of its design.
Preparation time: 45 minutes
Chill time: 15 minutes
Yield: 15 servings
1 box yellow cake mix (and ingredients listed
on the box)
8-ounce container whipped topping
2 pints fresh strawberries
1⁄2 cup fresh blueberries
1 Bake the cake according to the package directions. You want to follow the baking
instructions for the 9-x-13-inch baking pan and not the instructions for a layer cake.
2 After the cake cools, smoothly spread whipped topping over the cake.
3 Wash the strawberries, remove the stems, slice them in half, and arrange the fruit on
the cake as the stripes. Use the blueberries for the stars. Chill for 15 minutes; cut and
serve.
Vary It! If you can’t find fresh blueberries, use frozen ones or even blackberries instead.

Frightful Brownies
Turn a simple brownie mix into Halloween fun with this recipe. Brownies work well 
with younger children because your child can spend more time decorating instead of
cooking.
Preparation time: 40 minutes
Yield: 8 servings
8-x-8-inch tray of prepared brownies 
(no icing)
5 chocolate sandwich cookies, crushed
16-ounce container milk chocolate frosting
5 tablespoons nondairy whipped topping
5 cookies of your choice, cut in half (oblong
cookies, such as Nutter Butters, work best)
Decorating gel
Candy corns and small candy pumpkins 
for additional decoration
1 After the brownies have cooled, mix the sandwich cookies and frosting in a bowl
(reserve 2 teaspoons of the frosting for Step 3). Leave the mixture a bit chunky to
resemble dirt.
2 Spread the frosting mixture on the brownies, and cut the brownies into squares.
Arrange squares on a serving tray as desired.
3 On the bottoms of the cookie halves, smear a bit of the reserved frosting and stick the
cookie in the brownie, so the cookie sticks out vertically, resembling a tombstone.
Decorate with decorating gel so that it resembles a tombstone.
4 Use dollops of whipped cream to create fluffy ghosts and the decorating gel to add
facial features. Use candy corn, small candy pumpkins, or other decorating candy for
additional toppings.

Eyeballs in a Bowl
For a healthier alternative to Halloween treats, try this quick and easy recipe with your
child. Beware: The eyes may be watching you.
Preparation time: 20 minutes
Yield: Eight 1⁄2-cup servings
1 package of prepared gelatin, cherry flavor
2 to 3 tablespoons of nondairy whipped
topping
16 to 20 dark grapes, quartered
1 Prepare the gelatin according to the package directions.
2 Spoon the gelatin into serving dishes. Create more or fewer servings as desired.
3 Create two eyes with the whipped topping on top of the gelatin in each dish and then
place two grapes on each dollop of whipped topping to create the iris of the eyes. Serve.
Green Witch Punch
This green, but yummy, punch will be a hit with kids at any Halloween party. Leftover
servings can be frozen for later use. Children 2 years and older can help with this
recipe.
Preparation time: 20 minutes
Yield: Ten 1-cup servings
6-ounce package lime gelatin
2 cups boiling water
2 cups cold pulp-free orange juice
1 liter seltzer, chilled
Ice cubes
2 cups lime sherbet, slightly softened
1 orange, peeled and thinly sliced
1 In a mixing bowl, add the gelatin to the 2 cups of boiling water and stir for a few minutes
until completely dissolved. Add the orange juice and allow the mixture to cool for 10 to
15 minutes.
2 Transfer the mixture to a punch bowl, and a few minutes before serving, add all other
ingredients and stir well. If the punch needs to be colder, add more ice.

Vary It! Make this punch more intriguing by making ghoulish ice cubes! In a bowl, mix
water and green food coloring until you have a light green color. Pour into ice cube trays,
add a gummy worm or a gummy bug (such as flies) to each ice cube, freeze, and serve
these ice cubes in the punch.

Instant Gingerbread House
You can create a gingerbread house from scratch, but let’s face it, most of us probably
like decorating the house, not cooking it. That process is a long and grueling task. This
quick recipe gives you and your little one (of 3 years or older) a miniature gingerbread
house with no cooking involved.
Preparation time: 30 minutes
Yield: 1 serving
7 graham crackers
16-ounce container vanilla frosting
Decorating candy (jelly beans, M&Ms,
licorice)
1 Place one graham cracker on a sturdy plate.
2 Use a piping bag to squeeze a thick bead of icing around the outside of the graham
cracker. If you don’t have a piping bag, place the icing in a freezer bag and simply cut
away a small portion of one corner. Squeeze the bag and the icing comes out clean and
neat.
3 Use four graham crackers to create the walls. Place icing at each corner to create a
seam to hold the walls together.
4 Use the two remaining graham crackers to create the roof, again using the icing to hold
the graham crackers together.
5 Use the icing to create a door and windows on the house and then create roofing tiles.
Let your imaginations go wild. Finally, decorate the house with candy as desired.

The Importance of Eating Together
You already know the basic premise of family meals: The family that eats
together stays together. As parents ourselves, we, your humble authors,
couldn’t agree more with this philosophy. Naturally, life gets hectic some-
times, and we don’t always eat together as a family — but as a general rule,
we try to share as many meals as possible, and eating together is more of a
norm in our house than not.
For ages, psychologists have agreed that sharing a meal together reinforces a
family’s bond. Of course, family meals won’t fix all your family’s problems,
but they do have some important benefits:
 They foster open communication. In a day and age where different
schedules and activities, along with TV, seem to steal time away from
families, mealtime can be an informal time of bonding between family
members of all ages, just by giving you the opportunity to talk to each
other (after you’ve swallowed, of course!). It’s important to get your
child involved in this communication and bonding time right from the
start — this process creates a pattern of open and healthy communica-
tion in your tyke’s life.
 They give you a chance to train your child to use manners. A super
benefit of sharing meals together is the behavior training your children
get just by watching you. You can easily and gently reinforce table man-
ners as you eat together — a great time for kids to learn to serve them-
selves by helping fix their own plate. Rather than determining portion
control, give your youngsters some freedom and flexibility to eat more
of the dishes she wants. If you’re serving healthy meals, you don’t need
to worry about portion sizes too much.
 They help you avoid the “shifting meal” syndrome. Perhaps you’re
familiar with this all-too-common scenario, where everyone in the family
eats at different times. When you don’t eat as a family, you often end up
trying to fix a bunch of different dishes at different times, depending on
everyone’s needs and schedules. Or else you don’t have a clue what
your children are eating, because they help themselves as they have
time. If you can make mealtime a family gathering, you avoid this prob-
lem and essentially save yourself a lot of hassle.
 They lend themselves to good nutrition. This last point is an obvious
one: If your family eats prepared meals together, you’re likely to eat
more nutritious, well-balanced meals than when you’re grabbing some-
thing on the run (but if you have to eat on the go, check out Chapter 15
for some tips and recipes designed for busy times).

Part IV: Welcoming Your Child to the Big People’s Table 

The Do’s and Don’ts of Family Meals
So you’re convinced that family meals are a great idea, but you’re not quite
sure what you should and shouldn’t do — especially if your family isn’t yet in
the habit of eating together. Fret no more — in this section, we blaze the trail
toward family-meal-planning greatness.
Do be flexible
Don’t paint yourself into a Norman Rockwell scene — life is hectic for many
people, so you need to be flexible when trying to gather the troops. Realize
that sometimes, other priorities will interrupt family mealtime so that it
seems an impossible feat. Just remember that it’s okay to forgo the commu-
nity meal once in a while, but don’t let it become the norm. If some other pri-
ority interrupts your family time more often than not, take a hard look at
your family’s schedule and see if you can make some other items a bit more
flexible to accommodate a regular mealtime — after all, family mealtime is
just as important as business meetings and sports practices. You need to
strike a balance between family meals and the demands of real life, but try to
make sure your family eats at least one meal together per day, five days a
week.
Don’t get hung up on dinner
Family dinnertime tends to be difficult in many cases because of scheduling —
Timmy has basketball practice, Meagan has tap-dance classes, you have late
meetings, and so forth. If you find that getting everyone around the dinner
table on a consistent basis is a challenge, why not do family breakfast? Sure,
you’ll need to get up a little earlier than normal, but if you plan a couple of
days per week to be family breakfast day, your children likely will (eventually!)
get on board and will look forward to it.
Speaking of breakfast, it works great as a family meal for two important rea-
sons. First, breakfast is the most important meal of the day, so a family meal
around the breakfast table is always a great start to a new day. Also, many of
the breakfast recipes that we provide in this chapter are freezable, so you can
make them in the evening and quickly warm them up before breakfast. No
need to make everything from scratch at 5 a.m.!
225
Chapter 12: Appealing Meals to Suit the Entire Family

Do include everyone
The idea of preparing a meal for a whole family may make you groan as you
think about all the work involved. Instead, think of the meal as your family’s
time to be together and to help each other. Give tasks to everyone and expect
everyone to help with the cooking and with setting up and cleaning up. When
everyone helps, you all work together as a family, which in turn builds expec-
tations and keeps you or your spouse from being the servant, fostering team-
work within the family.
Getting your family on board isn’t difficult after you set the precedent for it.
Now is the time to be firm — show them that family meals are important and
aren’t optional, and you need their help. In fact, our children help with most
meals — even our 4-year-old helps set and clear the table. Her particular job
is to rinse the silverware and put it in the dishwasher. You can find a job for
even a 3-year-old, such as putting out napkins for family members and such,
so no excuses.
Need help getting family members on board? Give them some control. Plan
your weekly menu on Sunday afternoon and make it a family gathering.
Discuss the menu and take requests (within reason). This way, your entire
family has ownership of the meals because they’ve all helped choose the
foods you’ll eat. You don’t have to turn your home into a democracy, but an
open forum never hurts.
Don’t try to be a gourmet cook every day
We live on the practical side of life, and we think that you should too. Some
days you have extra time to spend on a special family meal, and on those
days, by all means, go for it! In many cases, though, you need something
healthy and realistic, and in others, you need something really quick! In this
chapter, our recipes are practical and down-to-earth (read that: fast and
easy). And as a bonus, because we know the busyness of family life and the
struggle of meal preparation all too well, we’ve made sure that many of the
recipes in this chapter (and throughout the book, in fact) work well for freez-
ing and reheating on those busy days.

Part IV: Welcoming Your Child to the Big People’s Table 

Do set aside outside disturbances
Inevitably, mealtime won’t always be the picture-perfect, completely focused
family time that you hope it will be. Several distractions commonly put a
damper on family bonding ’round the table. To make time for quality family
time, eliminate common disruptions. Here’s our advice on how to avoid them:
 Ditch the TV. If you absolutely have to have background noise, pop in an
unobtrusive CD that the family will enjoy, preferably one without words.
 Leave homework for another time. Homework should be done before
the meal or after, not during.
 Put your pets outside or in a separate room. We love our pets, but they
always seem to want attention during mealtime.
 Turn on the answering machine. A good rule of thumb is to not answer
the phone while you’re eating, with no exceptions. If the call is impor-
tant, the caller will leave a message, and you can call that person back
after you’ve had your family time.
 Keep neighborhood children at bay. If you have older children who reg-
ularly play with kids in your neighborhood, you need to make sure the
neighbor kids know when they shouldn’t come by.
Rising with the Roosters: 
Family Breakfasts
We love family breakfast because it’s a time that we get to spend together and a
way that we like to start off our day. Although we don’t eat breakfast as a family
every day, we try to from time to time, especially on Saturday mornings. If
you’ve never tried breakfast as a family meal, you should give it a shot — you
might like it! We include recipes in this section that work well for family break-
fast time and brunch as well.

Smiley Face Omelets
We include our favorite ingredients in this recipe, but we often lose the onions and
mushrooms for our children when we make them. Tailor yours depending on what each
family member likes.
With a little additional time, your kids can take the cooked omelet, spend a few minutes
decorating the outside with jelly to make a happy face, and then dig in. (A piping bag is
a great tool for this art project.)
Preparation time: 25 minutes
Yield: 4 servings
6 eggs
Salt and pepper as desired
1⁄2 cup chopped onions
1⁄2 cup chopped green bell pepper
1⁄2 cup sliced mushrooms
1⁄4 cup mild salsa
Cooking oil or spray
1 cup cooked, chopped ham, sausage, or
bacon (or a combination)
1 cup grated cheddar cheese
1⁄2 cup grape jelly (or any other variety)
1 In a large bowl, beat the eggs until well blended and add salt and pepper as desired.
2 In a separate bowl, combine the onions, green bell pepper, mushrooms, and salsa. Mix
well.
3 Oil a griddle or frying pan and heat over medium heat. Pour 1⁄4 of the blended eggs into
the pan. As the eggs cook, flip them over so that the other side begins to cook.
4 On half of the egg, add 1⁄4 cup of meat, 1⁄4 cup cheddar cheese, and 1⁄4 of the vegetable 
mixture.
5 Bend the egg in half to cover the ingredients and then flip it, continuing to cook until
the omelet is golden brown and the cheese melts. Repeat Steps 1 through 5 for the
other three omelets.
6 Put some jelly in a piping bag (or just put it in a sandwich bag and snip away one
corner). Allow your children to use the jelly to create eyes, a nose, and a smiling mouth
on the outside of the omelet. Serve.

8-count can crescent rolls
1 pound pork sausage
5 eggs
2⁄3 cup milk
Salt and pepper to taste
21⁄2 cups grated cheddar cheese
Sausage and Egg Casserole
You can find plenty of variations of this recipe, but in many cases, you’ll find that sausage
and egg casseroles contain such ingredients as half-in-half, salsa, Worcestershire sauce,
and such. Although yummy for adults, your children tend to avoid this dish if the taste is
too overwhelming. This simple recipe works best for everyone.
Preparation time: 20 minutes
Cooking time: 25 minutes
Yield: Seven 1-cup servings
1 Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.
2 Grease a 9-x-13-inch baking dish and place the crescent rolls in the bottom, rolled out
flat. They can overlap as needed.
3 In a large skillet, over medium-high heat, brown the sausage. Drain the excess grease
and spread the sausage evenly on top of the crescent rolls.
4 In a medium bowl, whisk together the eggs, milk, salt, and pepper, and then pour into
the baking dish. Top with cheese and bake for 30 minutes or until the cheese melts and
is bubbly.
Vary It! Substitute turkey sausage for the pork sausage for a healthier casserole. Also, you
can add a spoonful of salsa for extra taste, which the older children and adults in your
family may enjoy.

T Snowflake Pancakes
Here’s a from-scratch pancake recipe that includes a quick craft your kids can do while
the family is getting ready for breakfast. (See the sidebar “How to make a paper
snowflake” for the craft instructions.)
Preparation time: 15 minutes
Yield: About 5 servings
1 cup flour
2 teaspoons baking powder
1⁄4 teaspoon salt
1 egg
1 cup milk
1 teaspoon melted butter
Cooking oil
1 cup confectioners’ sugar
1 paper snowflake template (see sidebar 
for instructions)
4 burrito-size flour or whole-wheat tortillas
4 eggs, scrambled
1⁄2 cup mild salsa
1⁄2 pound sausage, cooked and crumbled
1 cup shredded cheddar cheese
Quick Breakfast Burritos
If you want to have breakfast with the family but you don’t have a lot of time to cook,
you can make this dish in a flash.
Preparation time: 15 minutes
Yield: 4 servings
Evenly divide all the ingredients among the tortillas, roll each tortilla to form a burrito,
and warm the burritos in the microwave for 20 to 30 seconds. Serve warm.
1 In a bowl, sift together the flour, baking powder, and salt. Beat in the egg. Add the milk
and butter and stir well.
2 Heat an oiled griddle to medium-high heat and spoon out the batter to form pancakes.
We prefer medium pancakes and use about 1⁄4 cup of batter for each pancake.
3 Flip the pancakes as they brown and make sure that the pancake is golden brown on
both sides. If necessary, re-oil the griddle and repeat Steps 2 and 3.

4 Place the pancake on a plate and put the paper snowflake template on top of the pan-
cake. Put the confectioners’ sugar into a shaker and shake generously over the tem-
plate. Remove the template and you’ll have a snowflake design on the pancake. Serve
with your favorite syrup.

How to make a paper snowflake
To make a paper snowflake, you need an 
81⁄2 x 11 sheet of standard typing or copy paper
and a pair of scissors with a sharp point for
accurate cutting. See the figure following these
steps for a visual aid, and get to work.
1. Cut one end off of the paper so you have a
perfect square.
2. Fold the piece of paper so you have a big 
triangle.
3. Fold the triangle in half to make a smaller 
triangle.
4. Hold your triangle with the longest side at
the top and fold the right-hand corner
toward the middle until it’s directly above
the bottom point of the triangle and the
right-hand side is in a straight line extending
from the bottom corner. Press down firmly
on the edge.
5. Fold the left-hand corner toward the middle
until it touches the right-hand point and
press down firmly.
6. Flip the paper over, and cut off and discard
the two points whose sides meet and are
sticking up in a straight line. You should be
left with a triangle.
7. Begin cutting shapes into the triangle in any
pattern you like (spikes, swirls, or a mix-
ture). Be careful not to cut the folds com-
pletely or you’ll have several little pieces of
paper instead of one snowflake.
8. Unfold the paper and you have a unique
snowflake!

Baked Ham
You may think of baked ham as a holiday chore or something you buy at a specialty
shop around the holidays, but you can enjoy ham any time with this delicious recipe.
It’s quick to prepare and always a winner with the family, and best of all, the leftovers
are freezer friendly.
Preparation time: 25 minutes
Cooking time: 2 hours, 50 minutes
Yield: 6 servings
2-pound whole, fully cooked ham
2 teaspoons whole cloves
11⁄2 cup packed brown sugar, divided
1 teaspoon dried parsley
1 cup pineapple juice
1⁄3 cup honey
8-ounce can sliced pineapple, drained
1 Preheat the oven to 350 degrees. Remove the skin from the ham and trim any fat.
2 Score the surface of the ham with a sharp knife, making diamond shapes about 1⁄2-inch
deep. Insert a clove into every other diamond.
3 Place the ham on a rack in a shallow roasting pan. (This raises the ham off the baking
pan to ensure that the bottom doesn’t burn.)
4 In a small bowl, mix 3⁄4 cup of brown sugar with the parsley. Pat the mixture on the top
and sides of the ham, and then pour the pineapple juice around the ham in the baking
dish. Bake uncovered for 1 hour. Baste often.
5 Remove the ham from the pan and set it aside. Drain the pan of the juices left from
baking, reserving 1⁄4 cup of the juice.
6 Create a ham glaze by combining the honey, the remaining brown sugar, and the
reserved pan juices in a bowl. Mix until well blended.
7 Return the ham to the pan and spoon half of the glaze over the ham. Place the ham in
the oven and bake uncovered for 20 minutes.
8 Remove the pan from the oven and place the pineapple slices on the ham. Drizzle the
ham with the remainder of the glaze and bake it for 30 minutes, or until a meat ther-
mometer reads 140 degrees. Let the ham stand for 15 minutes before carving.

Yield: 6 servings
For the meatloaf:
11⁄2 pounds lean ground beef
11⁄2 cups crushed butter-flavored crackers
1 small onion, chopped
1 egg
1 cup ketchup
1⁄4 cup packed brown sugar
1⁄2 teaspoon salt
1⁄2 teaspoon garlic powder

lay them on top of the meat in the pan. Place three slices of bacon lengthwise on top of
the cheese. Pat the remaining meat mixture into the pan.
4 Bake the meatloaf for 1 hour or until cooked through.
5 While the meatloaf is baking, prepare the sauce by placing all the sauce ingredients in a
medium-size bowl and mix well. Make sure that all the sugar is thoroughly incorporated
into the sauce and set the sauce aside.
6 Remove the meatloaf from the oven and place the remaining slices of cheese on top of
the cooked meatloaf.

Stuffed Burgers
How about a hamburger with a little kick? We love these stuffed burgers because they
taste so different than your run-of-the-mill burger — the onion soup mix is the key ingre-
dient. Check out the final product in the color section of this book.
Preparation time: 30 minutes
Tools: Grill
Yield: 4 servings
11⁄2 pounds lean hamburger meat
1 envelope dry onion soup mix
1 egg
1⁄2 cup ketchup
1 teaspoon salt
4 slices American cheese
4 hamburger buns
1 Preheat the outdoor grill to high heat. You can also cook these burgers on an indoor
grill or in a frying pan.
2 In a medium-size bowl, combine the meat, soup mix, egg, ketchup, and salt.
3 Divide meat into 8 parts, forming a patty with each part. The patties should be thin.
4 Put a slice of cheese on four of the patties, making sure that the cheese doesn’t go past
the edges of the patty. If it does, tear the cheese into pieces. Place the other four patties
on top of the cheesy ones, and form a seal around the cheese with the meat. This part is
crucial if you want to keep the cheese from leaking out while cooking.
5 Cook for 4 to 5 minutes on each side or until cooked through.
6 Toast the buns if desired and assemble the burgers with desired condiments.

A
s a parent, you’re likely to deal with some mealtime
challenges with your growing child. In this part, you
tackle those challenges head on, one by one. You explore
food-related issues and allergy problems and find recipes
to help you overcome these obstacles. You also uncover a

assembly of recipes that help you feed your child healthy
food when you’re on the run.

Challenges
In This Chapter
 Tackling allergy problems
 Dealing with food intolerances
 Coping with reflux
 Sharing recipes to battle food challenges
You have a baby. That baby needs to eat. You
provide food. That’s it. It sounds simple
enough, right? Unfortunately, we don’t always get
to live in that simplistic, idealistic world; we have
to cope with the challenges that nature pitches
our way. Two of these obstacles are food-related
allergies and intolerances.
This chapter helps you understand allergies and
intolerances (and the difference between them),
tells you about the signs and symptoms to watch for, and provides a handful
of recipes that avoid the common allergy and intolerance triggers — so even
if your child hasn’t been diagnosed with one of these food-related challenges,
you should still read this chapter so you know what to watch for. To help you
pay close attention to the reactions to foods, flip ahead to Appendix B, where
we provide a blank food log where you can chart new foods that you serve
and track any reactions that your child has to those foods. If your little one
experiences some food challenges, remember to consult his pediatrician so
she can confirm a diagnosis and formulate a treatment plan.

The Temporary Nuisances: Food Allergies
It’s not unusual for a child to have a food allergy of some kind. The FDA
reports that 6 percent of all children under the age of 4 have some kind of
food allergy. However, only 1.5 percent of adults have an actual food allergy.
So the good news is that your child will likely outgrow it.
Breastfeeding can greatly reduce the possibility of food allergies in children,
because both colostrum and breast milk naturally contain antibodies, which
provide a baby with the benefit of the mother’s immune system until the
baby develops his own functional immune system at about 6 months of age.
See Chapter 4 for more information on breastfeeding or read Breastfeeding
For Dummies by Sharon Perkins, RN, and Carol Vannais, RN (Wiley).
So what exactly is a food allergy? Technically speaking, an allergy results
when the body reacts against a food, usually a protein from the food that is
absorbed into the blood. The process looks like this:
1. Protein from food is absorbed into the bloodstream.
2. The body releases histamine and other antibodies to combat the per-
ceived threat.
Histamine is a chemical that is held in certain cells of the body. When an
allergy is triggered, the body naturally releases histamine as a defense.
3. The histamine causes typical food allergy symptoms
• Sneezing
• Runny nose
• Hives
• Difficulty breathing (in severe cases)
• Anaphylactic shock (in really severe cases)
Anaphylactic shock affects breathing and blood pressure, and can be fatal. If
your child has trouble breathing after eating, call 911 immediately.
A food allergy doesn’t mean that something is wrong with your child. Your
baby has an immature digestive and immune system, and children sometimes
overreact to foods.

Common allergy triggers
Some certain foods tend to trigger food allergies in children and can even be
dangerous. Don’t get carried away and feed new foods too quickly or feed
foods that are known allergens until your baby reaches age 1. Feeding foods
too soon doesn’t cause food allergies; rather, the immature immune system of
a baby is just more likely to react.
Food allergies tend to be from the same collection of foods. In other words,
your child is unlikely to have random food allergies, but some groups of
foods trigger the histamine in the body.
Because the following foods typically cause problems with children less than
1 year of age, wait until your kid is older than 1 year old to consider trying
any of these items.
These allergens are common, so introduce them with caution:
 Cow’s milk: Many children have allergy problems with cow’s milk. If you
discover an allergy with cow’s milk, try a soymilk substitute because the
protein in the two milks is different.
 Eggs: If eggs present an allergy, you’ll simply need to avoid them, but
you can use egg substitutes that are on your grocery store shelf.
 Gluten: Gluten is a protein found in grains, especially wheat.
Unfortunately, gluten is the cause for mostly all wheat allergies and
gluten can also be found in other wheat-based products. Children that
have gluten allergies must also avoid all products with wheat as well.
 Peanuts: Peanuts aren’t true nuts — they’re actually legumes from the
pea and bean family. Children with allergies to peanuts can be very sensi-
tive to foods with even tiny amounts of peanuts in them. Avoid all foods
with peanuts. Note: Children who are allergic to peanuts can often eat
tree nuts, such as walnuts or pecans because they’re from separate plant
families. Because peanuts are a common allergen, we recommend that
you wait until your child is 2 years of age before introducing peanuts.
 Shellfish: We prefer that you wait until the age of 2 before you try serv-
ing shellfish, because shellfish often causes reactions on the more
severe end of symptoms: difficulty breathing and anaphylactic shock.
 Wheat: Of all grains, wheat is the most likely to cause problems with
allergies. Avoid all wheat and products with gluten, which is the predom-
inant protein in wheat.
Other less common but known allergies in children that you should avoid
serving during baby’s first year of life are

Chapter 13: Dealing with Food-Related Challenges

 Artificial additives: Food additives (chemicals often used as binders and
preservatives) or dyes that contain sulfites are the most common prob-
lem components of this food allergy.
 Citrus fruit: Some children have allergies to citrus fruit (but most out-
grow it). Stick to noncitrus items, such as apples, pears, and bananas,
during baby’s first year of life.
 Meats, especially beef: You often see this allergy in children that are
allergic to other food items. However, children that are allergic to one
meat item may not be allergic to another (for example, you can substi-
tute ground turkey for beef).
 Soy: Soy is often used as a replacement for children with allergies to
cow’s milk, but some children are allergic to soy, too. If your child is
allergic to both cows’ milk and soy, consult a pediatrician to formulate a
milk replacement plan with other products.
 Tree nuts: Peanuts are the most common “nut” allergy, but some chil-
dren are also allergic to tree nuts, such as pecans, walnuts, and almonds.
Symptoms of allergies
Unfortunately, the symptoms of food allergies are similar to other problems,
such as a virus or even a cold, so it’s not unusual for parents to miss the
allergy at first, and in truth, a pediatrician should be the final authority on
whether your child has a food allergy.
The trick with food allergy symptoms is when they occur. Typically, a reac-
tion to food will occur within 30 minutes of eating the food. Carefully monitor
what your toddler eats, and any time that any of the following symptoms
occur soon after eating, consider whether any new foods were in the meal:
 Rashes and hives: Especially around the mouth and throat area. Sudden
rashes or hives are often the most recognizable signs of a food allergy.
 Wheezing or difficulty breathing: This is another symptom that can
become severe. Don’t hesitate to call 911 if your child is having trouble
breathing.
 Nausea, abdominal pain, and diarrhea: Digestive problems that occur
soon after eating a certain food are often a sign of a food intolerance
(and in some cases, an allergy).
In many cases, a certain food will give a person an upset stomach or gas, but
this is not necessarily a food allergy. Rather, digestive problems like these are
called food intolerances and aren’t the result of an allergy (food intolerances
are covered in the next section). Also, a runny nose without other symptoms
is typically not a sign of a food allergy either.
254
Part V: Fast Fixes for Mealtime Hurdles 

Getting a diagnosis
The first tactic in diagnosing a food allergy is to introduce new foods the
right way. In Chapter 5, we tell you all about introducing foods, but the key
point to remember is to wait about five days after introducing a new food
before introducing another. This procedure gives you plenty of opportunity
to observe your child and see if she’s having problems with certain foods. If
you introduce several foods at the same time, you won’t be able to figure out
which food is causing the problem.
Be careful when you assume a food allergy, especially when digestive prob-
lems are the symptom. Just because your child seems to have a possible
digestive reaction one time doesn’t mean she will again. Also, food allergies
can be tricky to track down depending on what foods you’re feeding. For
example, is the allergy really the French fry or the peanut oil it’s fried in?
In most cases, parents tend to ignore the first reactive episode, but if your
child’s symptoms appear again with the food in question, you’ll need to see a
pediatrician who can make a proper diagnosis.
Although you can do some of the legwork yourself to identify potential aller-
gies, be sure to talk with a pediatrician about food allergy concerns so you
can get an accurate diagnosis. Identifying a food allergy requires a health his-
tory, physical exam, and diagnostic tests. (An allergy can only be truly diag-
nosed by testing for antibodies because even symptoms exactly like those of
an allergy may not be caused by one.) If your child has several apparent aller-
gies, his pediatrician or allergist will perform either a skin test or a blood test
to see if specific food allergies can be found.
Dealing with an allergy (or allergies)
In the case of one or two allergies, you can simply avoid the problematic food
and substitute another food with similar nutritional value. For example, it’s
not unusual for children to react to strawberries with some kind of facial or
body rash. The solution is simply not to offer strawberries until your child
gets older. Try to reintroduce those foods as your baby gets older, normally
waiting about one year. Your child is most likely to develop tolerance to dif-
ferent foods if you identify the food that’s causing problems and eliminate it
from the diet for at least a year or two.
If your child has severe reactions to foods, such as trouble breathing, his
pediatrician may also prescribe an epinephrine autoinjection device (such 
as the EpiPen or EpiPen JR) and ask that your child wear a medical alert
bracelet to notify others of his allergy. Naturally, these steps aren’t necessary
unless an allergy is life threatening.
255
Chapter 13: Dealing with Food-Related Challenges

An allergy to a certain food also involves everything that food might be in.
You need to avoid not only the food itself, but any dish that contains it. This
typically isn’t too much of a problem, unless your child is allergic to some-
thing like wheat, which is found in many dishes, or peanuts or peanut deriva-
tives (such as peanut oil, which is used to fry many foods).
After baby has been diagnosed with a food allergy, be sure to follow the
instructions of the pediatrician. If your little one is allergic to a common
ingredient, such as wheat, you’ll have to get in the habit of reading the pack-
age contents on any prepackaged food that you want to serve.
When in doubt, most manufacturers have a toll-free number that you can call
and ask about the ingredients in the food. If you’re eating out, ask for an
ingredients list. Unfortunately, you have no simple workaround if your young-
ster is allergic to common food ingredients, but you need to be proactive
about your child’s eating habits to prevent reactions.
In for the Long Haul: Food Intolerances
Although children may outgrow allergies, food intolerance is a problem that
may hang around for years, and in some cases, a lifetime. (For more on the
differences between the two, see the corresponding sidebar later in this
chapter.) Much confusion surrounds allergies and intolerances, and the two
are commonly used interchangeably.
In reality, people generally have food intolerance to four specific groupings:
 Fructose (a type of sugar)
 Gluten
 Lactose
 Wheat
Food intolerances are much more common than food allergies in both chil-
dren and adults, so it’s important to understand the issue of food intoler-
ances. In this section, we discuss the two most common ones.
Lactose intolerance
Lactose is a natural sugar that is found in dairy products and other foods as
well as breads, cereals, cake mixes, and salad dressings. In a normal case, the
body breaks down the lactose into two simple sugars: glucose and galactose,
which are then absorbed by the bloodstream. When a person is lactose intol-
erant, the body isn’t able to digest this sugar easily.
256
Part V: Fast Fixes for Mealtime Hurdles 

Lactose intolerance is caused by a lack of the lactase enzyme in the body that
breaks the lactose into simple sugars. When more lactose is eaten than the
available lactase can digest, lactose molecules remain in the intestine undi-
gested, attracting water and causing the characteristic bloating, abdominal
discomfort, and diarrhea. The undigested lactose becomes food for intestinal
bacteria, which multiply and produce gas.
Lactose intolerance is a rather common problem in young children, and in
fact, it’s also a common problem in many adults. Actually, lactase function is
highest immediately after birth, but in the majority of people, lactase activity
declines dramatically during childhood and adolescence. Only a small per-
centage of people retain enough lactase to digest and absorb lactose effi-
ciently throughout their adult life. It’s pretty rare for an infant to be born with
a deficiency.
Symptoms of lactose intolerance
The result of lactose digestion problems is that when the affected person
eats or drinks any dairy product that contains lactose, she ends up with a
number of bad symptoms:
 Diarrhea
 Bloating
 Nausea
 Abdominal pain
 Very bad breath (no kidding!)
The preceding symptoms may appear from 30 minutes to 2 hours after ingest-
ing lactose.
Can you be allergic to milk and not be lactose intolerant? Yes — they’re very
different. A milk allergy is an immunologic response to a protein, and lactose
intolerance is an enzyme deficiency. Sometimes intolerances to foods can be
diagnosed as allergies, but they aren’t. Adverse reactions to foods that
involve symptoms but no antibody/histamine production are considered
intolerances. And, of course, the most common intolerance is that of lactose.
It’s also important to note that in some cases, babies can have lactose intol-
erance problems even when they breastfeed. Although rare, it’s a known con-
dition and one that your doctor can help you diagnose. The key to these
issues is remembering the symptoms — if your child seems to have the
symptoms mentioned in the previous list and is generally cranky, often after
eating, get your doctor involved so that he or she can confirm a diagnosis
and provide guidance.
257
Chapter 13: Dealing with Food-Related Challenges

Treatment for lactose intolerance
If your child has a lactose problem, it’s likely that he’ll have to contend with
it for a long time. There is good news though: Several over-the-counter prod-
ucts exist that can help with lactose intolerance.
Many adults and children have problems digesting lactose, and there are a
couple of commercial products for you to choose from:
 Prepared milk products: Products that have been treated with an
enzyme that breaks down the lactose.
 Enzyme replacement: You can purchase enzyme tablets or drops that
can be added to milk. This product is often sold near the antacids in
your local supermarket. However, child use should be supervise by your
doctor.
Milk products that are labeled lactose free still have the same nutrition and
can be given to children who have lactose problems. Fortunately for lactose
intolerant folks, these products can greatly help manage problems without
having to avoid dairy altogether.
Tolerance to lactose varies widely. Many people with intolerance can con-
sume foods and drinks with up to 6 grams of lactose (1⁄2 cup of milk) without
symptoms. The best strategies would be to begin with small portions and
increase the portion size until mild symptoms appear; eat or drink with other
foods in a meal; and spread out intake throughout the day. Total elimination
of milk products is usually not necessary.

You say allergy; I say intolerance
The terms allergy and intolerance are often
used interchangeably, and sometimes food
intolerances are diagnosed as an allergy. So
how can you cut through the confusion? Keep
reading to see the difference.
Food allergy:
 A rather fast response by the body’s
immune system to a perceived invader.
 Signs or symptoms are typically immediate,
dramatic, and visible: coughing, sneezing,
vomiting, migraines, watering eyes, rashes,
swelling tissue, hives, or in severe cases,
anaphylactic shock, which requires emer-
gency intervention.
Food intolerance:
 The body’s inability to digest some foods
properly.
 The gastrointestinal tract is unable to pro-
duce appropriate enzymes for normal
chemical breakdown. The food passes
through unprocessed and causes intestinal
problems.
 Symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, and
diarrhea can be delayed for hours.

As with all childhood problems, you should discuss the issue with your pedi-
atrician and follow her advice. If your child has severe problems with lactose
intolerance, your pediatrician may recommend a milk replacement product.
Visit www.brightbeginnings.com to see a good example of a milk replace-
ment product that uses soy. Some other foods that don’t cause as many prob-
lems related to lactose intolerance are
 Yogurt: A great source for calcium intake. Active cultures in most types
of yogurt provide their own enzyme to digest lactose; look for active cul-
ture on the label.
 Cheese: Some cheeses don’t cause symptoms because most of the lac-
tose is removed during processing. Try serving aged, hard cheeses such
as cheddar, Swiss, or Parmesan.
 Cottage cheese: This product has a lower lactose level due to the reduc-
tion during processing.
Gluten intolerance
Gluten is a protein found commonly in wheat and in lesser degrees in rye and
barley, giving dough its elastic nature and enhancing the texture and taste of
bread. Children who have gluten intolerance (as opposed to a gluten allergy)
have a greater challenge because there aren’t many substitute products for
gluten. Before jumping the gun and assuming that your child has gluten intol-
erance, be sure to see a doctor first. Check out Living Gluten-Free For
Dummies (Wiley) by Danna Korn.
Avoiding gluten requires avoiding wheat and other related grain products
that contain gluten. Wheat is used in all kinds of products, including breads,
cereals, and crackers. In fact, the following common items all contain wheat
and gluten:
 Bran
 Breadcrumbs
 Cereal extract (used in crackers)
 Couscous
 Cracker meal
 Enriched flour
 Gelatinized starch
 Gluten
 High-gluten flour
259
Chapter 13: Dealing with Food-Related Challenges

 High-protein flour
 Hydrolyzed vegetable protein
 Modified food starch
 Modified starch
 Natural flavoring
 Semolina wheat
 Soy sauce
 Starch
 Vegetable gum
 Vegetable starch
 Vital gluten
 Wheat bran, germ, gluten, malt, and starch
 Whole-wheat flour
True gluten intolerance is called Celiac Disease. Celiac Disease is a perma-
nent intolerance to gluten that results in damage to the small intestine. The
only way to prevent it is by avoiding gluten entirely.
Symptoms of gluten intolerance
The symptoms of Celiac Disease can vary. They generally consist of severe
gas, bloating, diarrhea, and abdominal pain. If these effects are left untreated,
your child may experience malnutrition.
Symptoms don’t always involve the digestive system. Other indicators
include irritability, depression, muscle cramps, joint pain, and fatigue.
Reactions to ingestion of gluten can be immediate, or delayed for weeks or
even months.
Because gluten intolerance can be difficult to diagnose, you should see a
pediatrician if your little one experiences persistent symptoms described in
this section. Try to give the doctor as much information as possible about
your child’s eating habits.
Treatment for gluten intolerance
The only real treatment for gluten intolerance requires a lifetime adherence
to a strict diet that avoids all products containing gluten. A gluten-free diet
can prevent almost all complications caused by the disease.
260
Part V: Fast Fixes for Mealtime Hurdles 

Follow these tips to help you avoid gluten:
 Read food labels. Gluten is often used as a thickener. Check canned
soups, ketchups, mustards, soy sauce, and other condiments — many
contain gluten.
 Watch out for other grains. Wheat isn’t the only problem. Rye, oats,
barley, and other multigrain products contain gluten.
 Look for the wheat-free label. But don’t be fooled. Remember that
products labeled wheat free aren’t necessarily gluten free.
 Locate other key words. Watch out for the following items:
• Caramel coloring
• Cereal
• Distilled vinegar
• Durum
• Emulsifiers
• Enriched flour
• Farina
• Flour
• Malt flavoring or extracts
• Modified food starch
• MSG
• Semolina
• Stabilizers
• Triticale
Spitting Up (Or, Technically 
Speaking, Reflux)
Reflux is a condition where much of the stomach contents are pushed back
up into the esophagus and out through the mouth or nose, which typically
occurs shortly after eating. In truth, everyone experiences reflux to a minor
degree every day and isn’t aware of it.
261
Chapter 13: Dealing with Food-Related Challenges

Reflux in babies and children occurs because of an uncoordinated upper
digestive system. A ring of muscle at the bottom of the esophagus opens and
closes to allow food to enter the stomach. This ring is called the lower
esophageal sphincter (LES). Reflux can occur when the LES opens, allowing
stomach contents and acid to come back up into the esophagus. As your
child’s digestive system develops and becomes more mature, the LES stops
opening when it’s not supposed to, and the reflux problems typically pass. In
fact, 90 percent of all babies and children who suffer from reflux simply out-
grow it by 6 months old.
Watching out for common symptoms
Babies naturally spit up a lot, so regular spit up is nothing to be concerned
about. However, as your baby grows to month six, you should notice an out-
growing of this behavior, and you shouldn’t be overly concerned unless your
child seems to spit up most of what he’s eating and you see the following
symptoms along with it:
 Frequent vomiting (more than once or twice daily)
 Poor weight gain
 Recurrent pneumonias
 Eating discomfort
• Refuses to eat
• Stiffens up
• Arches back
• Tries to push away from the bottle
 Persistent hiccups
 Persistent cough
 Chronic nasal and/or sinus congestion (from aspiration)
 Frequent choking episodes
 Sour breath
 Burning pain in the chest area (for children 2 years and up)
 Complaint that eating hurts (for children 2 years and up)
Chronic reflux can result in Esophagitis. This condition is caused by erosion
of the esophagus from the acid in the vomit. Signs can range from pain during
feedings to blood in the vomit. If this continues for a long period of time, it
can cause scarring on the esophagus and, rarely, it can lead to Barretts
Esophagus (a condition in which the color and composition of the cells lining
your lower esophagus change because of repeated exposure to stomach
acid) or even esophageal cancer.
262
Part V: Fast Fixes for Mealtime Hurdles 

These conditions only happen if chronic reflux is ignored and the condition
continues over time. This is why detection and treatment should be consid-
ered for children who seem to have excessive problems with reflux.
Diagnosing and treating reflux
Reflux may be diagnosed based on the description of the child’s behavior and
a combination of the symptoms as described in the previous section. Often
the doctor will order various tests to confirm the diagnosis.
Reflux is an important problem to address, but it’s also important not to
over-diagnose Baby’s normal spitting up behavior. If the problem seems per-
sistent, talk to a pediatrician, who can order definitive tests to confirm a diag-
nosis. As with most childhood problems, it’s important to be proactive but
not overly reactive.
If your tot suffers from reflux, see a pediatrician for treatment options, which
depend on the severity of the condition. As with any problem, your pediatri-
cian can evaluate your child’s particular situation and recommend the best
course of action. Your pediatrician may recommend the following treatments:
 Thicken the formula. Thicker formula helps keep the food in the 
stomach.
 Start with rice cereal. Rice is often easier to digest. Your doctor may
recommend moving to oatmeal because it’s thicker. Ultimately, follow
your doctor’s advice.
 Allow naps in an infant seat or bouncy chair. Gravity helps with the
digestive process because of the upright position.
 Sit your child upright during eating and for about 30 minutes after-
ward. This often greatly reduces reflux because gravity helps keep the
food in the stomach.
In more severe cases, your pediatrician may prescribe a medication to help
reduce the amount of stomach acid, which will reduce the symptoms of
reflux.

264
Part V: Fast Fixes for Mealtime Hurdles 
T Homemade Gluten-Free Flour
If your child has an allergy to gluten, you’ll find yourself in a jam because most bread
contains gluten, including typical flour you would use to make a wide assortment of
recipes. Begin by making this gluten-free flour substitute, which you can then use in
other recipes that call for flour. You may be able to find some of the ingredients at your
local supermarket, but you may also have to trek to a health-food store.
Preparation time: 5 minutes
Yield: About 31⁄2 quarts
8 cups rice flour
5 cups potato starch flour
21⁄2 cups tapioca flour
Mix all the ingredients together and store in a flour container.
Tip: You can easily make more or less by simply adjusting the measurements in this recipe.
The recipe without measurements is 1 part rice flour, 2⁄3 part potato starch flour, and 1⁄3 part
tapioca flour.
T Rice Sponge Cake
For a light sponge cake that is flour free and gluten free, try this rice version. This
recipe is a lot like angel food cake, so it works well with fruit toppings, especially 
strawberries. Note: If you haven’t the foggiest idea how to separate an egg, check out
Figure 13-1.

T Allergen-Free Teething Biscuits
Finding teething biscuits for your allergic youngster can be nearly impossible. And
when you have a screaming child whose teeth hurt, you’ll want something quick to
soothe his pain. With this quick recipe, you make your own biscuits, but note that they
tend to be harder than the store-bought variety.
Preparation time: 15 minutes
Cooking time: 30 minutes
Yield: 15 servings
1 cup rice cereal
1 cup millet flour
1 cup apple juice
Butter or oil for baking
1 Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.
2 Mix all the ingredients in a large bowl with a wooden spoon to form the dough.
3 Lightly butter or oil a bread pan and place the dough in the pan.
4 Bake the dough for 30 minutes. Let the bread cool for a few hours, and then bake again
for another 15 minutes to make it harder. This will make the biscuits firmer and more
useful as a teething biscuit.
5 Remove the loaf from the oven and cut it into small biscuits, about 11⁄2 inches wide by 11⁄2
inches long; allow the biscuits to cool completely before serving. We suggest putting
them in the refrigerator so they’re cold when you serve them — the cold will also ease
your child’s teething pain.

T Rice Milk
Many children, and well, adults too, may not be able to tolerate milk. If you need a milk
alternative for cooking, try this recipe. The process of making rice milk is easy. The final
product may turn out a little bland, so we add a bit of vanilla to give it some flair. Rice
milk also works as a good substitute for regular milk in recipes. Naturally, you can buy
rice milk already prepared, but if you’d rather make your own, use this handy recipe.
You can also freeze the extra for later use.
If your child has a cow’s milk allergy, this rice milk isn’t a good substitute because it
doesn’t contain the calcium and other nutrients found in milk. You should feed your
child a comparable milk substitute, such as soymilk.
Preparation time: 21⁄2 hours
Tools: Cheesecloth
Yield: 10 cups
2 cups rice
12 cups water (you may need a bit more)
Salt or vanilla extract to taste
1 Bring the water to a boil in a large saucepan. Put rice in another large saucepan and
pour boiling water over the rice. Soak for 2 hours.
2 Using a blender, blend 1 cup of soaked rice with 21⁄2 cups of water. The blended mixture
should be a bit chunky, not a smooth liquid.
3 Pour the mixture into a clean, large, pot and repeat the process in Step 2 with the rest of
the rice, blending one cup at the time with 21⁄2 cups of water.
4 After that process is finished, bring the rice liquid to a boil, reduce heat, and simmer for
20 minutes.
5 Line a colander with a few layers of cheesecloth, and pour the rice liquid through the
colander into a large, clean pot. You can also add another cup of water into the colan-
der to get more milk to seep through after you complete this process.
6 Add a bit of salt or vanilla extract to the milk to enhance the taste. Refrigerate the milk
or freeze the extra.

T Basic Smoothie
Children love smoothies and will often drink a smoothie when they refuse to eat any-
thing else. That is why parents often rely on smoothies to provide some solid nutrition.

You know the look. It’s a look of quiet 
disgust — and the quiet part of the look can
quickly turn into complaints and even angry
behavior. You see this look, in many cases, no
matter what you seem to fix for lunch or dinner.
It’s the look of a picky eater.
Children from 2 to 5 are notorious for being diffi-
cult eaters. Even if you’ve followed our advice in
previous chapters about offering balanced meals,
healthy snacks, and a variety of foods, your child
still may turn into a picky eater for reasons
beyond your control. Children, yes your kids too,
are unpredictable, and just like the rest of their
lives, they seem to go through stages where some-
times they eat well, sometimes they don’t seem to
eat at all, and sometimes they seem to eat only
one food, all the time, period.
These stages of eating and degrees of pickiness
are all normal. Children differ, so don’t get in the
habit of comparing what your child does with 
your best friend’s child. In terms of eating, some
children are simply pickier than others. What can you do to help? A ton! In
this chapter, you’ll find tips to help you manage your needs and some recipes
that tempt even the pickiest of eaters.

Understanding Why Kids Are Picky
Above all things, we want you to know this: Picky eaters are normal children.
Any child development book that talks about eating probably mentions the
issue of picky eaters. This childhood behavior, though, often pushes parents
over the edge. So, the first tactic to managing your child’s picky eating habits
is first to understand those habits.
Picky eaters don’t eat the same way adults eat. As adults, we tend to eat two
to four meals a day, perhaps with some snacks in-between. In many ways,
we’re conditioned to eat this way, and we tend to follow that same routine
every day. In fact, we often eat because it’s time to eat, even though we’re not
really hungry.
Children, on the other hand, eat when they’re hungry — plain and simple. So
the result is that your child may tank up at one meal a day and tend to pick at
her food the rest of the day. She may eat like a horse one day and barely
touch her food for the next day or two. Or she may get stuck in a rut and only
eat a couple of different things.
Whatever the case may be, there’s plenty of room for individuality. The 
point isn’t to be overly concerned or troubled by your child’s picky eating
behavior — in fact, the more focus you put on the eating habit, the more little
Jenny resists eating and thinks negatively of food in general. Except for rare
cases, your tot is fine and ends up eating like a normal adult.
So, why are children picky eaters? There are a number of explanations. Your
child may lean more toward one reason or the behavior simply may be
caused by a combination of events. Understanding, however, leads to easier
management, so consider the following issues:
 Appearance: Children, like adults, are visually driven when it comes to
food. However, children have to learn what looks good to eat and what
doesn’t look good to eat. The cheesy lasagne may look great to you, but
it looks like a bunch of goo to your toddler. So, when your dish is
rejected, don’t take it personally.
 Immature emotions: Let’s face it; toddlers haven’t exactly mastered the
management of stress and frustration. In light of this fact, don’t be sur-
prised if your child unleashes a torrent of emotions concerning food.
Illogical? Yes. Childlike? Yes. But it’s still important to teach what is and
what isn’t polite early on. Work with your youngsters concerning table
manners. If your little ones don’t like a food, a simple “No thank you” is
enough.
274
Part V: Fast Fixes for Mealtime Hurdles 

 Lack of schedule: It takes time for children to become scheduled eaters.
Your child may eat a lot of one item and not eat again all day. In other
words, children want to eat when they’re hungry and not based on a cer-
tain time of day. That’s why one of your most important jobs is ensuring
mealtime consistency. Even if a child isn’t hungry or doesn’t eat much at
a meal, you should still offer food at the same time every day, instead of
asking, “Are you hungry yet?”
 Smell: Smell is a learned response. In other words, it takes time to figure
out what smells good and what smells bad. Your child may immediately
reject something in the kitchen based on smell, even though it smells
good to you.
 Texture: Don’t forget that food provides many different textures. For
example, a raw carrot and a cooked carrot are very different with
regards to texture. Children often like one texture and reject another,
even though the food may taste like something a child would typically
want. Texture takes time to get used to, and a child’s taste buds have to
mature.
In the end, the final reason that children are picky eaters is unknown. In fact,
some researchers believe that pickiness is even “wired” into your children as
a preventative measure that helps them from eating something poisonous.
275
Chapter 14: Tempting Dishes for a Picky Eater
Discerning whether Susie is really too choosy
To help you gauge how to handle your child at
mealtime, your best bet is to keep a journal.
Grab a spiral notebook, and write down every-
thing your picky eater actually eats or drinks in
a given day. Why? You may be surprised at your
findings. After you recognize these patterns,
you can take steps to correct them.
 Parents are often surprised to find that their
picky eater is actually eating more than they
think. Many parents have difficulty when
they offer their children food because the
portions are much bigger than the child can
eat, and so what she eats doesn’t look like
much to us. If you keep an accurate record
of what your child eats, you may find that
your little one eats more than you think.
 Your child eats too much of one item, such
as some kind of snack food instead of
meals. Check your journal (that we know
you’ve been keeping) to see the eating pat-
terns and how much of any one single item
you’ve been serving.
 Your child tanks up on milk or juice.
Depending on the age of your kid, it’s
common for children to appear to be picky
eaters, when in fact they’re full from drink-
ing too much milk or juice. A journal helps
you identify the liquid creep, which may
contribute to the picky eating behavior, and
then you can offer other liquids such as
water.

Picky eating typically peaks around the time a child enters preschool (4 years
old) and tends to decline after that. Again, this norm isn’t a hard and fast rule
that you’d be able to observe.
Either way, as the parent, you’ll contend with picky eaters, and the important
tactics in this chapter help you battle the cooking woes.
Tactics for Managing Your Picky Eater
If you end up with a picky eater (and 30 to 40 percent of you reading this
book will), you can put to work some important tactics as you continue to
feed and work with your finicky child. In fact, dealing with selective eaters
can be frustrating and parents often make situations worse by letting their
emotions get in the mix. Therefore, gather the information from the tactics in
this chapter and put your knowledge to work in the kitchen.
Be consistent
The key tactic to managing a picky eater is being consistent. Don’t give up or
give in. A consistent mealtime offers your child three healthy meals a day and
healthy snacks in between. Offer a variety of foods, and don’t allow your little
beggars to panhandle for snacks between meals, either. Also, keep the milk
and juice in check, and serve water occasionally.
Your child won’t starve to death. Just because she’s picky, don’t feel like you
have to throw organization and nutrition to the wind just to get her to eat. Be
consistent and firm, and don’t force the issue. She’ll eat when she’s hungry.
Defuse the stress
Unfortunately, a finicky eater can be stressful for you and the rest of the
family. Unfortunately, the stress and aggravation you feel can end up making
mealtime a war zone, and your stress can actually make the problem much
worse. In fact, reactions from you can make your picky eater pickier!
As you work with your kid, it’s important to remember that you’re not alone,
and pickiness is actually common in children. With this in mind, don’t take a
food protest as a personal attack against your cooking. Instead of letting
mealtimes stress you out, just do your best and move on — tomorrow is
another day.
276
Part V: Fast Fixes for Mealtime Hurdles 

Parents often make mealtime stressful for their children by putting too much
food on their plates. Keep portion sizes small to diffuse your child’s stress —
she can always have more.
Use the time in the kitchen as a teaching moment and for building positive
relationships between you and your family. Get your kids involved in the
kitchen and consider letting them help you cook. Because cooking with your
kids contributes to positive activity on many levels (such as math skills, lan-
guage skills, and organizational skills), we’ve included an entire chapter dedi-
cated to whipping up meals together. This tactic will also help your child be
more interested in food and improve her desire to try new foods that she’s
helped prepare. Flip back to Chapter 11 to find out more about preparing
meals with your little one.
Mix it up
As you’re working with your picky eater, you may fall into the routine of let-
ting your child eat whatever he’ll eat for the sake of simplicity and your
sanity. In the end, though, this form of nourishment isn’t a good tactic. This
behavior produces an older child that automatically rejects any new foods
and continues to be picky. Avoid planning meals based on what your picky
child eats. This tactic decreases variety and the rest of the family ends up
resenting having to eat only what the picky one eats.
Keep mixing up the meals and encouraging good eating behavior. We always
encourage our kids to try new things. Sure, sometimes they complain, and
sometimes they gag, but our children are comfortable with trying new foods.
And you can nurture adventurous kids too! Our 9-year-old tries anything — if
she doesn’t like it, no big deal. You don’t want to end up with children who
only eat five things.
Mix it up with the following recipes that we’ve designed especially for your
picky eaters. These easy, friendly recipes stimulate the eye, which helps
encourage your child to try them.
Serve meals away from the table
If eating is a problem, then your child may associate the kitchen table with
negativity. This is the time to shake things up and get away from the kitchen
table:
 Plan a backyard picnic.
 Have a “tea party” (with real mealtime food) in your child’s bedroom.
 Play restaurant — move the meal to another area of the house and pre-
tend like you’re eating out. Have your toddler help out as a waiter!
277
Chapter 14: Tempting Dishes for a Picky Eater

Use the kitchen table for activities other than cooking. Let your child work
with molding clay or other craft projects. By putting this tactic to work in
your home, having craft time at the same table at which you eat may lessen
the opposition.
Avoid disciplining behavior
One of the worst mistakes to make is allowing the kitchen table to become a
place of discipline, criticism, or arguing. As frustrating as your child’s defi-
ance to food can be, avoid using discipline, and never force-feed — this is
dangerous due to the choking hazard and results in more eating problems
later.
Instead of focusing on discipline, try these tips at the dinner table:
 Reinforce table manners with your behavior. Lead by example.
 Focus your child on eating, but talk about other things at the table as
well. Conversation defuses the attention away from the food. Tell little
Becky what foods she’s eating, but don’t talk about food after that. Avoid
comments such as “Look, mommy likes it,” or “Don’t you want to be
strong like daddy?” These comments only add to the stress of the situa-
tion and don’t help the picky eater.
 Remove the plate if your child simply refuses to eat, but don’t allow him
to leave the table until everyone else is finished, and don’t give him a
snack within the next hour. Keep the same meal and snack schedule
whether your toddler eats. Children may manipulate dinner situations if
you allow them to skip meals but eat a snack afterward.
 Never, ever bribe your child to eat one food based on a reward for
another food (such as something sweet). This reward pattern begins a
lifelong struggle with sweets, which can lead to weight and health 
problems.
Lunches with Great Taste Appeal
Lunch tends to be a meal that most kids want to eat. And that’s the good
news! Use lunchtime as an opportunity to test out different recipes on your
child. Eventually, if you have a picky eater, you’ll find meals that your kids
enjoy. Try these recipes to help you do just that.

Sautéed Hamburger with 
Zucchini and Squash
We love any sautéed food and for good reason. Sautéed foods simply have a different

T Hatching Chicks
This recipe gives you the taste of deviled eggs and some fun with its appearance. Kids
love the look of these “hatching” deviled eggs. Have your toddler help you with this
recipe. You’ll both get some giggles out of the finished product. For a visual of what
each egg should generally look like as you go through the steps, see Figure 14-1.
Preparation time: 25 minutes
Yield: 6 servings
6 hard boiled eggs, peeled
3 tablespoons mayonnaise or salad dressing
2 tablespoons dill or sweet relish
1 teaspoon yellow mustard
12 green stuffed olive slices
Pepper to taste
1 Cut the eggs in half lengthwise. Remove the yolks and place them in a medium bowl.
2 Mash the yolks with a fork and add the remaining ingredients, except the olive slices.
Pepper to taste.
3 Carefully mound the mixture into 6 of the egg white halves.
4 Take one of the empty egg whites and cut slivers out of one side to give the egg white
the appearance of being broken, as if a chick is breaking through.
5 Carefully place the empty egg white on top of a stuffed half, leaving a 1⁄4-inch crack so
the yellow appears. You’re essentially tilting the top portion so you can see the yellow
yolk inside through the opening, surrounded by the notches that you cut earlier.
6 Take two olive slices and put them in the crack so they’ll resemble eyes. The idea is to
make the chick appear to be looking out of the crack, as if it is about to hatch.
7 Repeat this process for the other eggs.

your picky eater devour this wholesome snack.
Preparation time: 15 minutes
Tools: Various cookie cutters
Yield: 3 servings
3 pieces of whole-wheat bread
Butter for spreading
2 tablespoons peanut butter, smooth
Finely sliced apple pieces
1 Toast the bread in a toaster or toaster oven until lightly brown.

2 cups flour
1-ounce envelope of dry onion soup mix
16-ounce package shredded cheddar cheese
1 cup melted butter
1 Combine all ingredients in a bowl. Mix together with your hands, then remove from the

A
h, life on the run. Not that your life wasn’t
busy enough before kids, but now you move
at lighting speed. You head out the door and think,
“We’ll grab something to eat on the way.” That
something almost always ends up as fast food, typ-
ically something fried. Sure, you have good inten-
tions, but unless you’re eating a healthy meal at
Grandma’s house, eating away from home will get
you into nutritional trouble every time. Your life
seems as though you’re constantly rushing from
one place to another, so how can you ever juggle
your life and healthy meals successfully?
Great news! Armed with the right information and
the recipes in this chapter, you’ll make better deci-
sions for your kids when you’re running out the
front door, because these recipes give you the
ability to take healthy foods with you. Naturally,
it’s best if you eat at home as a family as much as
possible, because doing so provides structure and
a good learning environment for children. If activities or travels have you
scrambling, though, you don’t have to fall into the fast-food pit.
Best of all, you’ll feel much better as a parent if you give your children
healthy meals and snacks, even when an active schedule causes you a bit
more work and planning. So if you’ve decided to go the extra mile, give your-
self a nice pat on the back.

Planning Ahead
The greatest key to eating healthy outside your dining room is getting pre-
pared ahead of time. After all, as you march through your daily routine,
healthy meals and snacks won’t fall into place without your careful attention
and planning (and they certainly won’t fall from the sky). The meals and
snacks in this chapter all work well for eating while you’re out and about, but
they require that you prepare and package them beforehand, which you can
easily do with just a bit of organization.
At the beginning of every week, sit down with a calendar and look at your
schedule for that week. Think about work, school, and all the extracurricular
activities. Identify your routine for each and then think in terms of your
youngster’s meals. Try to anticipate moments where you may need to be flex-
ible with mealtime and meal options. If your schedule looks really busy, you
may need to make a priority list and determine which activities are really
important and which ones you can lose so that you have more time for family
meals at home.
Fortunately, you can prepare some meals and snacks in advance of the day
you need them, so it’s helpful to plan out a menu for the week. In fact, every-
one in your family is much more likely to eat healthy if you do so.
As you’re organizing and planning meals, consider what meals need to be
kept cool. Think carefully about your routine and decide whether a cold meal
is convenient for you to transport.
Keeping Foods Cool or Warm en Route
You possibly grew up carrying your lunch to school, so the concept of trans-
porting food may be nothing new to you. Plenty of resources exist today that
can help you transport food for your children, and we discuss a handful of
them in this section. Before we divulge the packaging details, though, we pro-
vide some information to remember as you plan and pack Jimmy’s meals.
Keep the following facts tucked in your memory when sending your child off
with packed cold snacks or meals:
 Cold foods must be kept cold or they’ll spoil — ideally, you should keep
them at 40 degrees or less.
 Spoiled food can lead to salmonella poisoning and can even land your
child in the hospital.
294
Part V: Fast Fixes for Mealtime Hurdles 

 Products with eggs and mayonnaise are particularly susceptible to spoil-
ing if they don’t stay cold.
 Cold foods can be moved to room temperature for 2 hours before you
need to throw them away, and only 1 hour if the temperature is over 90
degrees.
What is the best way to transport meals and snacks so that they stay safe
and cool? Check out these products and ideas, and you can find more infor-
mation about different types of containers in Chapter 3:
 Insulated, soft-sided lunch boxes or bags: These items are the best for
keeping food and snacks cold.
• Include a frozen gel pack or two to keep the temperature at a safe
level.
• If you make the cold meal the night before, make sure that you
keep it refrigerated. This step helps cool the bag down more
quickly because the food is already cold.
• If you’re sending along a juice box with other cold items, freeze the
juice box the night before. The juice box then becomes another
frozen item that will help keep the rest of the food cold and will
thaw for drinking after a few hours.
 Standard lunch boxes, bags, and thermoses: These products work well
for keeping nonperishable food items in a safe place, and you’ll find
plenty of options at your local department store or superstore.
 Hard plastic containers: Some foods can easily get crushed and ruined
or may even leak.
 Child-size thermos: If you’re taking along hot soup or a hot drink, a good
child-size thermos with a cup is an excellent choice so your little one
has something to drink out of.
As you’re planning, remember to keep foods as simple as possible — now
isn’t the time to try that new casserole and bring it along. Also, as you pre-
pare, don’t forget about condiments, napkins, forks, and spoons!
When You Can’t Avoid Fast Food
Fast food is just that — fast, and that’s about it. The fast-food industry has
managed to package a cheap and ever-present source of temptation for both
kids and parents. After all, if you can just grab something from a fast-food
restaurant, you save time.
295
Chapter 15: Eating Away from Home

However, giving in to this temptation all the time is the worst behavior you
can follow in terms of your child’s nutritional health. Now, we’re not health-
food nuts, and we let our children eat fast food from time to time, but all too
often, fast food becomes a way of life in many families. Follow this rule: If you
or your children eat fast food at least once every week, that’s too often. Fast
food should be a treat, not a main part of your child’s diet routine.
Typical fast food contains high levels of saturated fat, over-processed carbo-
hydrates, sugar, and sodium. It also tends to be calorie dense with little nutri-
tional value. All things considered, nothing is good about fast food, except
the taste (and that’s how they reel you in).
Sometimes, though, you need to or choose to eat fast food, and if you find
yourself in that situation, you should know how you can make better fast-
food choices for your kids.
Consider the following tips:
 Skip the drinks. Fast-food restaurants often report that they make most
of their money from soft drinks. Although most people love soft drinks,
they’re calorie dense, sugar laden, and provide no nutritional content at
all. On top of that, the carbonation is bad for your teeth. Ask for water or
milk instead.
 Avoid chicken nuggets. Have you ever thought, “I’ll get little Suzie some
chicken nuggets — at least they’re healthier than other options”? It’s a
common trap because we know that chicken is a leaner meat. Yet,
chicken nuggets from fast-food restaurants are deep-fried, which cancels
out the fact that the meat hidden inside all the breading and grease is
lean. (Keep in mind, too, that most chicken nuggets contain processed
meat, which isn’t nearly as good for you.)
 Pass on the fries. Yes, French fries taste great — thanks to grease and
salt. In most cases, fast-food French fries contain little amounts of pota-
toes, and in the end, you’re essentially eating grease and salt with virtu-
ally no nutritional value. In fact, French fries aren’t a good meal option at
home, either, because they’re fried. Many fast-food restaurants provide
substitutes, such as fruit cups, yogurt, side salads, and so on. Choose
one of these options instead, but realize that even these items are often
high in saturated fat due to dressings, nuts, and so forth, so be sure to
pluck out the unhealthy parts and opt for lowfat dressings.
 Look for grilled options. If you stop for fast food, try to look for menu
options that are lean and grilled. Some fast-food restaurants offer grilled
lean chicken sandwiches and salads. Take advantage of these “adult”
meals by taking an extra minute and cutting the grilled chicken into bite-
size pieces. Fried chicken breasts or fried fish sandwiches aren’t healthy
meal options.
296
Part V: Fast Fixes for Mealtime Hurdles 

 Make your burgers better. Hamburgers aren’t bad, but you can greatly
improve the nutritional content of a burger with a couple of quick
changes. First, order the burger with no mayonnaise (this cuts the fat
content). Ask for extra veggies, such as lettuce and tomato, which bal-
ances the meal a bit. Be wary of special sauces and other condiments,
which tend to add a lot of empty calories. Avoid burgers with bacon
and/or more than one meat patty.
 Watch portion sizes. Everyone has a tendency to eat more at a restau-
rant or while traveling than at home. After all, when you walk into any
restaurant, the plethora of choices is really tempting. When you’re
hungry, these choices can put you over the edge, not to mention the fact
that you’re paying a chunk of change, so you want to get your money’s
worth. So while you dine out, remember to think about portion sizes,
and take home a doggy bag if you want. Like you, your child doesn’t
need to eat more at a fast-food restaurant than he eats at home, so order
wisely.
 Choose fast-food restaurants with more healthy options than their
competitors. You don’t have to be a victim to what’s on the menu. If you
know you’ll be eating more fast food than you should, spend a little time
on the Internet and look at the menu options from the various fast-food
restaurants in your area. Most of them give you nutritional information
at their respective Web sites on the foods they serve. Choose the restau-
rants that give you the most flexibility and healthy options — a smart
move for both you and your child.
Wholesome Snacks
In many cases, you need healthy snacks on hand that you can grab and then
run. Even if you don’t plan on eating a meal out, you still need to provide
your child with a healthy snack midmorning or midafternoon. If you’re plan-
ning to be away from home, use the quick and handy recipes in this section
to prepare nutritious, portable snacks in advance.
Many of these recipes contain honey and nuts. Remember that children less
than 1 year old shouldn’t eat honey, and due to potential allergies and chok-
ing hazards, we recommend that children be at least 2 years old before eating
peanuts.

1⁄4 cup green seedless grapes
1⁄4 cup purple seedless grapes
1⁄4 cup mixed nuts
1⁄8 cup raisins
1⁄8 cup hulled sunflower seeds, unsalted
1 tablespoon honey
T Grape and Nut Mix
This quick snack takes only moments to prepare and travels well, so it’s perfect for road
trips. This recipe yields only 1 cup, but you can easily increase the amount. However,
keep in mind that grapes don’t last very long, so don’t mix up more than you need for
any given outing.
Warning: Because this recipe contains nuts and grapes, it isn’t appropriate for children
under 2 years old. Carefully supervise older toddlers as they eat this snack to avoid a
choking hazard.
Preparation time: 5 minutes
Yield: Two 1⁄2-cup servings
Wash and dry the grapes. Mix all the ingredients in a plastic storage container.
T Healthy, Nutty Snack Mix
This road-trip snack mix is a good snack for your child. Full of fiber and calories, it’s
healthy and filling. However, the recipe contains both popcorn and nuts, so it’s a poten-
tial choking hazard. We recommend this snack mix for children near the age of 3 or
older, and to minimize the danger of choking, we recommend that you stop off at the
rest area of your choosing so your child can eat.
Preparation time: 5 minutes
Yield: Six 1⁄2-cup servings
1 cup popped popcorn
1⁄2 cup O-shaped cereal
1⁄2 cup Grape-Nuts cereal
1⁄4 cup raisins
1⁄2 cup mixed nuts
1⁄2 mini pretzels
1⁄2 teaspoon cinnamon
1 teaspoon sugar
Put all the ingredients in a large plastic storage bag, and then shake the bag well to
blend the cinnamon and sugar with the rest of the ingredients.

T Stuffed Logs
You may be familiar with the celery and peanut butter snack that you probably had as a
kid growing up. This snack is a variation of that recipe with more dense calories and
nutrition. As such, it works great as a heavy snack that your kids can take along with
them when they’re on the move, because it’ll keep them full for a longer period of time!
Yield: 6 servings (1⁄2 celery stalk per serving)
3 celery stalks
1⁄4 cup granola or Grape-Nuts cereal
6 tablespoons lowfat cream cheese
2 tablespoons raisins or hulled sunflower
seeds (or a combination of both)
1 Wash and dry the celery stalks and cut each one in half widthwise.
2 Mix all the ingredients except the celery in a large bowl with a wooden spoon until well
blended. Spoon the mixture into each celery stalk half. Serve.
T Peanut Butter Cup and Apples
This lunch alternative is often met with a smile and it’s a healthy and portable meal.
Keep in mind that peanut butter can be a choking hazard, so offer this snack to older
toddlers when you can supervise.
Preparation time: 10 minutes
Yield: Two 1⁄2-cup servings
1⁄2 cup peanut butter
1 tablespoon lowfat cream cheese
1⁄2 ripe banana, thinly sliced
1 apple, sliced in wedges
In a transportable, resealable plastic cup, combine the peanut butter, cream cheese,
and banana. Mix well. Serve with the apple wedges, and you may want to include some
celery sticks as well.

1⁄2 cup mayonnaise
1⁄2 cup sour cream
1⁄2 envelope zesty Italian seasoning
2 tablespoons ground pecans
1 In a small bowl, blend all the ingredients together until smooth.
2 Put the dip in a resealable travel bowl. Serve it with mixed raw veggies such as celery,
carrots, broccoli, and cauliflower. You can also serve this dip in individual portions by
using smaller storage cups.
T Nutty Veggie Dip
Children often like fresh veggies with dip because it gives them something to do with
their hands. You can take this delicious nutty dip on the road, but make sure that you
serve it at a rest stop, or you just might have dip on the back of your seat, on the inside
of the window, and all over your child!
Preparation time: 15 minutes
Yield: Two 1⁄2-cup servings
Pickle Wraps
Although this lunch wrap may sound odd, kids often love the tangy taste of pickles
mixed with smooth cream cheese.
Preparation time: 10 minutes
Yield: 2 servings
2 whole kosher dill pickles
1 tablespoon lowfat cream cheese, divided
2 thin slices deli-style turkey breast
Dry the pickles completely with a paper towel, and then spread 1⁄2 tablespoon of cream
cheese all over each pickle. Depending on the size of the pickles, you may need a bit
more cream cheese. You can also spread the cream cheese on the turkey slice instead
of the pickle, if you find that approach easier. Wrap each pickle in a slice of turkey
breast. Keep cool until serving.

Wrapped Hard-Boiled Egg
This quick-to-prepare food functions well as a heavy snack or a full meal when you’re on
the road, because it’s easy to transport.
Preparation time: 15 minutes
Yield: 1 serving
1 hard-boiled egg
1 tablespoon chopped ham
1 teaspoon slivered almonds
1 slice whole-wheat bread
1 tablespoon honey
1 Slice the hardboiled egg in half widthwise. In each egg half, scoop out about half the
yolk and discard it.
2 Fill each side of the egg with the ham and almonds.
3 Smear the bread with honey on one side.
4 Press the egg back together and place it on the bread, quickly wrapping the bread
around the egg. You can use a long toothpick to hold the snack together until serving,
or wrap it tightly with plastic wrap. If you use a toothpick, make sure that you remove it
prior to serving.
Sandwiches and Other Tummy Fillers
Sandwiches are a natural option when you’re moving about because they’re
so portable. Sure, you can serve the standard PB&J, but these sandwiches
and other portable meals give you some different, tasty options.

302
Part V: Fast Fixes for Mealtime Hurdles 
1 tablespoon lowfat cream cheese
2 slices sandwich bread (try oatmeal bread)
2 slices ripe pear
2 slices deli-style ham
1 Spread the cream cheese on both pieces of bread.
2 Add the pear and ham slices, and then put the two pieces of bread together to form the
sandwich. Cut the sandwich into squares or other shapes as desired.
Tip: Gather your favorite cookie cutters and cut this sandwich into different shapes. Your
children will love sandwiches the visual appeal.
Avocado Chicken Sandwiches
This sandwich is one of our kids’ favorites, and it’s very healthy. We love using avoca-
dos because they’re easy to digest, they taste great, and they’re vitamin dense.
Combine avocado with lean chicken and you’ll feel great that you’re giving your child
plenty of protein and vitamins in this quick and easy sandwich.
Preparation time: 10 minutes
Yield: 2 servings
1 tablespoon mayonnaise or mustard
2 slices whole-wheat bread
2 thin slices cooked chicken breast
2 thin slices ripe avocado
1 thin slice tomato
1 Evenly spread the mayonnaise or mustard over both slices of bread.
2 Stack the chicken, avocado, and tomato on one slice of bread, top it with the other
slice, and cut into squares or other shapes as desired.
Ham and Pear Sandwiches
The crunchy taste of the pear keeps this sandwich from being anything but ordinary.
We’ve found that the sweet taste of the pear mixes well with the ham, and your child is
bound to like it.
Preparation time: 10 minutes
Yield: 2 servings

Stuffed Croissant
Croissants are always a great choice because they’re a bit different from your ordinary
square bread and work great for any mixture that you want to stuff inside to make a
sandwich. The turkey and cream cheese mixture tastes like a combo from a specialty
deli — but you can make it quickly in your kitchen. You may want to make an extra one
for yourself!
Preparation time: 10 minutes
Yield: 1 serving
2 deli-style slices turkey breast
1 tablespoon lowfat cream cheese
1 teaspoon finely chopped almonds
1 croissant roll
1 tablespoon finely chopped tomato
2 thick slices ripe avocado
1 On one piece of turkey breast, spread the cream cheese and sprinkle the almonds.
2 Place the second slice of turkey breast on top and roll it up.
3 Cut a lengthwise slit down one side of the croissant.
4 Put the turkey roll, tomato, and avocado inside the croissant and press down a bit to
close the croissant.

1 cup shredded cheddar cheese, divided
1 Spread the cream cheese evenly over one side of each tortilla, and then tear the turkey
slices into bite-size pieces.
2 Line the tortillas with lettuce, and then sprinkle the turkey pieces, carrots, and cheese
evenly over each tortilla. Roll up the tortillas and keep them cool until serving.
T Peanut Butter and Banana 
Wraps
This very filling on-the-go lunch is a favorite with kids and parents as well — and it’s a
cinch to prepare. Remember that peanut butter is a choking risk, so supervise your
child as he eats this snack.
Preparation time: 10 minutes
Yield: 2 servings
4 tablespoons smooth peanut butter
2 tablespoons lowfat cream cheese
2 flour or whole-wheat tortillas
1 large banana, thinly sliced
1 Spread the peanut butter and cream cheese evenly over each tortilla.
2 Add the thin banana slices.
3 Roll up each tortilla tightly. You can cut the tortillas into pieces for easier transporting.
Turkey Roll-Ups
These roll-ups provide the nutrition of an entire meal, not just a snack. All the ingredi-
ents are healthy. In fact, these roll-ups are a great snack for adults as well, so pack a few
extras for yourself.
Preparation time: 15 minutes
Yield: 2 servings (2 roll-ups per serving)

T Bagel Pizzas
This lunch “pizza” is a healthy alternative to your typical Italian fare. This recipe uses
nuts, which you may remove if you want to feed this meal to a younger child. However,
bagels, as with any dense bread, can be a choking hazard for younger children, so use
caution and supervise your child when she eats this wholesome meal.
Preparation time: 10 minutes
Yield: 2 servings
1 bagel (any kind, but plain typically works
best)
2 tablespoons cream cheese
1⁄4 cup finely chopped veggies
1 tablespoon chopped pecans
1 Cut the bagel in half and evenly spread the cream cheese on each half.
2 Sprinkle the chopped veggies over each half and add the pecans. Wrap individually in
foil for easy transport.

Sweet Sides for Sweetie Pies
Yes, we love sweets, and there’s nothing wrong with them in moderation. And
the great news is that you can prepare sweet treats for travel and still keep
them healthy. We provide a balance of both in this section, and we think your
kids will eat them up (in both senses of the word).
Fruit Bowl
Fruit is often a good snack because it satisfies a sweet tooth and is a healthy alternative
to snack cakes and other sweets.
Preparation time: 15 minutes
Yield: Two 1-cup servings
10 seedless grapes, cut in half
1⁄2 orange, peeled and cut in small wedges
1⁄2 apple, cored and cut in small wedges
1⁄4 cup pineapple chunks
2 tablespoons apple juice
Mix all the ingredients in a large plastic bowl. If you want smaller servings, transfer con-
tents to individual, sealable serving dishes. Keep the fruit cool until serving.

Peanut Butter Balls
This recipe is rather common; you often see it during the holiday season. The coconut
adds a boost to the flavor (and helps keep the balls together). Because this dessert is in
a ball shape, it’s a choking hazard for young children. We recommend that you reserve
this dessert for children 3 years and older, but still supervise their eating even for 
this age.
This recipe makes 3 dozen Peanut Butter Balls, so freeze the extras for quick use when
you’re in a hurry.
Preparation time: 15 minutes
Chill time: 15 minutes
Yield: 12 servings (3 treats per serving)

Part V: Fast Fixes for Mealtime Hurdles 
1 cup creamy peanut butter
2 sticks butter, softened
16-ounce box confectioners’ sugar
1 cup shredded coconut
1⁄4 cup chopped pecans
1⁄4 cup crushed graham crackers
1 In a microwavable bowl, melt the peanut butter and butter until you can stir them
together. Set aside.
2 In a large bowl, mix the remaining ingredients with a wooden spoon until the mixture is
well blended. Pour the peanut butter and butter mixture on top and stir until well
mixed.
3 Form the mixture into 1-inch balls and place them on a cookie sheet lined with wax
paper.
4 Refrigerate until cold and the snacks set up, about 15 minutes. Individually wrap each
ball in plastic wrap so the snacks don’t stick together, and keep the balls cold until 
serving.

Apricot Fruit Chews
Fruit chews are a good option for traveling because they’re easy to transport. We love
this homemade variety because they have a tangy taste, which your kids will undoubt-
edly love. Although these treats are perfect for dessert, they also work well as a snack
any time.
Preparation time: 15 minutes
Chill time: 15 minutes
Yield: 10 servings (2 treats per serving)
1 cup dried apricots
1⁄3 cup wheat-flake cereal
1⁄2 ounce unsweetened chocolate, melted
1⁄4 cup honey
Nonstick cooking spray
1⁄2 cup chopped pecans
1 In a medium pot, place the apricots in 4 cups of boiling water. Remove the pot from heat
and let it stand for 5 minutes.
2 Remove the apricots from the pot, drain the water, and place the fruit in a food proces-
sor. Add the cereal and puree until the mixture is coarse.
3 In a small bowl, mix the apricot and cereal mixture with the chocolate and honey.
4 Spray your hands lightly with the nonstick cooking spray and shape the mixture into 
1-inch balls. Roll each ball in the pecans and place them on a cookie sheet lined with
wax paper. Chill in the refrigerator until cold, about 15 minutes, and keep cold until
serving.

The Part of Tens

In this part . . .
E
very For Dummies book has a Part of Tens — a sec-
tion with quick and helpful lists arranged in, what do
you know, groups of ten (or so). Our Part of Tens is no
exception to that rule, so in Part VI, we impart our top ten
timesaving tips for busy parents and ten ways to get your
child to try new foods.

Chapter 16
Ten Timesavers and 
Tips for Busy Parents
In This Chapter
 Saving time with a little advanced planning
 Planning your grocery list and shopping once a week
 Managing your kitchen to manage your stress
W
e know what you’re thinking: “I’ve read this book and the information
is great, but how do I juggle cooking, my job, and taking care of my
baby, my house, my car, my other children . . .” and the list goes on. We
understand; after all, we’re working parents as well.
Cooking your child’s meals can be a time-consuming task, but with a few tips
and tactics tucked in your hat, you’ll be able to cook healthy meals without it
becoming a huge time problem.
Cook in Advance
Cooking for family and for a child requires one simple task — planning. If you
plan your meals, you’ll also organize your time, and you’ll find that cooking
for your child as well as any other family members doesn’t have to be a
mountainous chore.
You may notice that throughout this book we’ve included many recipes that
freeze well, and time is the main reason. Your time is precious. Follow these
steps to help make your meal planning successful:
 Get a calendar with a lot of writing space.
• Purchase one.
• Print some pages off the Internet.
• Make a calendar from your desktop publishing software.

 Make a family meal outline for the week.
• Plan every day and every meal if possible.
• Find a certain day or evening that serves as your “cook” time.
With a just a couple of hours, you can cook most of the meals for the week and
simply freeze them. If you can find a large block of time to cook and prepare
future meals, then you can simply reheat your food and serve it without much
fuss. This way, your entire week is planned out and your meals are ready at
once with no more asking yourself, “What in the world will I cook tonight?”
Cook Multiple Portions
More is less (in this case at least). Many of the recipes in this book cook more
than one serving. That’s great, because if the recipe can be frozen, you can
automatically gain a meal here and there just by cooking a recipe that feeds
multiple people. A few extra ingredients to multiply a batch will save you
time because you’re making more food and creating less work for yourself
later in the days, weeks, and months to come.
Combine Easy and More Difficult
Some of the recipes in this book are a real snap — they’ll only take a few min-
utes to complete. Some are more complicated and will take a bit longer. When
we cook, we try to combine easy recipes with difficult recipes. For example, 
if the meat recipe is more involved, we try to fix easy sides. Or, if we cook a
more difficult side, we try and make sure the meat recipe is quick and easy.
This way, you’re cooking good food, but you aren’t overwhelming yourself
with three or four complicated recipes at each cooking session. In every
meal, always try to combine easy and more difficult recipes to save some
time for you to relax after the kids have gone to bed.
Plan One-Dish Recipe Night
Because you’re cooking for your child (and probably other family members),
it’s a good idea to plan a “one-dish recipe night” each week. This simply
means that the dish for the night is something that has both meat and vegeta-
bles cooked together so you can avoid having any side dishes. This method
cuts down on the amount of work as well as the amount of freezer space
required to store meals. One-dish recipes also cut down on the amount of
dishes for cleanup.
314
Part VI: The Part of Tens 

Keep in mind that this suggestion only works with older toddlers who’ve
started sharing meals with the family.
Keep Lunch Quick and Easy
Try to keep lunch healthy and simple, preferably something that can be
easily heated in the microwave. Keep in mind that you shouldn’t strive to
cook overly complicated lunches every day — they simply take up too much
time. That’s why most of the lunch recipes in this book are rather easy.
Reserve lunchtime, at least a few days a week, as a quick and easy affair.
Limit Shopping to Once a Week
Many cooks have a bad habit of running to the grocery store three or more
times a week. The back and forth costs you extra money and certainly time. 
A better method is to get organized and know what you’ll need for the week,
and then buy everything in one trip. This way, you’re much more likely to
have what you really need, avoiding extra time-eating trips and impulse buys.
Develop a list throughout the week as you plan meals and notice that you’ve
run out of certain staple items.
If something is on sale that you use often and you have the storage space,
stock up! Don’t forget to clip coupons — we save money on groceries every
time we shop just by spending a few minutes clipping coupons each week.
Take advantage of the savings!
Don’t go to the grocery store hungry. If you’re stocking up to feed the family
for the week, an extra item here and there may not seem too bad. But those
impulse items you pull off the shelf, especially when you’re hungry, can add
up to big bucks spent at the checkout. Try to stick to your list and eat at least
a snack before going to the store.
Be Mindful of Appliances
When you cook for your child, be mindful what appliances you’ll need. When
your baby is little, you’ll need a food processor frequently, but as your child
grows and the recipes become more involved, you’ll need a variety of appli-
ances. As you’re planning your menu, try to think about what appliances and
even cookware you’ll need and make sure they’re varied. In other words, if
you’re trying to cook several recipes at once, you want to make sure that you
don’t need to use the same appliance over and over because this will slow you
down — you’ll need to wait and wash the appliance several times. Again, plan
carefully! See Chapter 3 for help and information about kitchen appliances.

Chapter 16: Ten Timesavers and Tips for Busy Parents

Get Ready Before You Cook
Before you start cooking a meal or multiple meals, get your kitchen ready.
 Make sure that you have ample time to prepare the recipes that you
want to cook.
 Make sure that you have everything you’ll need.
 Check your recipes against the ingredients you have, and don’t forget to
check the cookware and cooking tools you’ll need to make sure you
have them.
Regularly ensure that simple things like emptying the dishwasher and cleaning
up the kitchen happen at your house. This habit ensures that everything is in
order before you start so you don’t have to stop cooking to do other tasks.
Clean as You Go
It’s always tempting to focus on cooking and not on cleaning (after all, cooking
is more fun). However, you’ll save time if you clean up as you go. Don’t get in
the habit of cooking entire meals and letting the pots and pans stack up to the
ceiling. Once you get behind on the dishes, it feels like it takes forever to catch
up. This wastes time that you may not necessarily have, so get in the habit of
cooking and cleaning as you work. You’ll end up with wonderful meals and a
clean kitchen at the same time — and that’s good news for everyone.
Cleanup is typically easier when you measure out all the ingredients and then
put them away. This technique prevents clutter, which causes a mess, and
also allows things, such as milk, to go back in the fridge (to prevent spoiling).
Also, if your child is old enough to help you, give your child a task; it will
speed things along and help you keep things clean as you cook.
Team Up
You don’t have to go it alone! If you have a friend or neighbor who’s also
cooking for a child the same age as yours, consider teaming up. You and your
friend can get together and cook meals, making the event a social time, or
you can consider trading foods each week. Try to plan your weekly meals
together, and then share the cooking responsibilities and food. It can save
you a lot of time and it can be a lot of fun! Your kids can also play together
and keep each other occupied so you don’t have to worry about whether
your child is bored while you’re creating a week’s worth of meals in the
kitchen.

Chapter 17
Ten Tips to Get Your Child 
to Try New Foods
In This Chapter
 Making the food experience more pleasant
 Inventing, creating, and designing at mealtime
 Mixing the routine up a bit: Trying new things
N
aturally, as a parent, you want to make sure that your child gets the
nutrition that he needs, so you try to introduce new and healthy foods.
However, what do you do when your child reaches that age where he refuses
to try anything new? Let’s face it: Many children are picky at certain times
when it comes to food. It’s important to keep in mind that your little tyke may
be resistant to new and different foods, and some kids box themselves into a
place where they only want to eat one or two food items. This behavior is
often frustrating for parents, but it’s important to keep in mind that the
behavior is normal. In fact, most children go through various stages of picki-
ness with their food. You can help overcome this hurdle with the tips in this
chapter. So, before you pull your hair out, relax, take a deep breath, grab a
cup of tea, and read this chapter.
Choose the Right Time
Half the battle of getting your child to try a new food is knowing when to intro-
duce that new food. If you’re trying to expand your child’s food repertoire or
just trying to get your child to eat more than two or three food items at any
given meal, make sure that you introduce the new foods or try to expand your
child’s diet at the right time of day. This time is often at lunch or dinner.
Lunch or dinner is often the best time to try and introduce a new food
because your child is the hungriest after hours of playtime. At either meal,
use this naturally hungry time to push beyond the pickiness barriers.

It’s important to avoid any snacks or drinks other than water for at least an
hour before lunch or dinner, and strive to make lunch and dinner sit-down
meals — not something you do while watching television or performing some
other activity. Gathering around the kitchen table gives you the best option
to offer new foods when your child is naturally hungry. Also, make sure that
you offer some familiar foods along with the new food. This process helps
make the meals easier for your child.
Control the “Fill Factor”
Do you ever think of your child as a panhandler? Think again! One mistake
parents often make with a picker eater is they end up letting the child control
in-between mealtime snacks and drinks. Your child needs healthy snacks in
between meals (and we’ve provided lots of recipes for them in this book).
However, your child also manipulates the “fill factor” with milk and juice.
The scenario goes something like this: Your child picks at lunch. Forty-five
minutes later, your child asks for a glass of milk or juice. You provide it. Your
child nibbles at his snack, but asks for more milk or juice half an hour later.
What is happening is that your child is tanking up on milk and juice instead of
having to eat food. And you’re letting him! This isn’t what you want because
your child isn’t getting balanced nutrition.
Take a firm stand and offer only water in between meals and snacks. We rec-
ommend milk with snacks. You actually want your child to be hungry when
it’s time to eat.
Mix Old Foods with New Foods
One helpful tactic to try and introduce new foods into your kid’s diet is to make
certain that you serve your child foods that she likes when you’re introducing
the new foods. In other words, never try to get your child to eat several new or
different foods at the same time during a picky eating phase because the new-
ness can be overwhelming to your child, and she may resist you the entire way.
The best approach is to give your child a few foods that she likes and a new or
different food. Place bites of the familiar food with the new food on the high-
chair tray as your child eats. Many times, children discover that they like the
new food if you can just get them to actually try and taste it.
318
Part VI: The Part of Tens 

Remember, pickiness is more about a mental attitude than anything else. At
this age, your child is managing the world around her. Naturally, food can
become a source of control. As parents, it’s important to keep your cool,
relax, and remember that this behavior is normal. As your child discovers
new foods and has the option of trying them with foods she already likes,
she’ll be less likely to resist.
Incorporate Condiments
Have you ever watched small children eat French fries when you’re out at a
restaurant? They methodically dip each fry in a glop of ketchup and lick the
ketchup off the fry and go back in for another dip. They may not eat the fry
until the ketchup is gone. If your child likes condiments, such as ketchup or
even mustard, by all means take advantage of this preference when you intro-
duce new foods. Don’t add a huge pile of ketchup, but instead, place a small
dollop of the condiment on the plate and show your child how to dip the new
food in it. Naturally, condiments don’t necessarily go with every food that
you may want to introduce, but if you can, use a condiment to help your child
be creative and adventurous with his meals.
Watch Out for Texture
When your child is in a picky eating phase, she may be overly sensitive to dif-
ferent food textures. As adults, we tend to think about food in terms of taste,
but in fact, the texture of food has a lot to do with our likes and dislikes. As a
child, many textures may take some getting used to. Many children like things
that go “crunch,” but tend to be wary of dishes that seem slimy, saucy, or
overly complicated in terms of different textures. So as you introduce foods,
take note of how your child reacts. If the food is rejected at first, feed a famil-
iar food; then go back to the new textured food later. If your child rejects the
food all together, you may need to hold off on serving that particular item for
a few more weeks.
You can help with this issue by slowly adding foods with differing textures, at
least during this picky eating phase. It may seem odd, at least it was to us,
but our youngest child wouldn’t eat most bread, unless the bread was well
toasted. There was something about the texture of soft bread that she didn’t
like. She eventually decided that she liked untoasted French bread, however,
and once she accepted it, she finally moved on to other breads as well.
Realize that all kids are different and this “texture issue phase” will pass with
time. Just keep offering foods with different textures and allow your child to
experiment with them.
319
Chapter 17: Ten Tips to Get Your Child to Try New Foods

Create a Visual Sensation
Like adults, children weigh the visual impact of food pretty heavily. Children
resist trying new foods that don’t look appetizing, and if we’re honest, adults
are much the same way — why do you think those expensive gourmet meals
are presented in such cool designs?
You don’t have to spend all day trying to come up with something new, but as
the opportunity arises, put some creativity into your child’s meals. To entice
your tot, try these suggestions:
 Create shapes with veggies and other foods.
 Arrange the food on the plate in a creative fashion.
 Use fruit and cheese to make a smiley face on a plate or even make a cat
or dog face. Our kids loved this approach and we’ve used it to sneak in
new foods.
Take every advantage to make your child’s meals have a fun, creative impact.
If your child is old enough to help prepare the meal and creatively display it,
let him — he may be more open to eating the food in the meal.
Liven Up the Plates and Spoons
Here’s a helpful tactic: Get your child a plate, spoon, and fork that he really
likes. In fact, let him pick it out. When you’re kid is eating a new food, be sure
to use his favorite plate and utensils. Once again, picky eating is more of a
mental block than any real issue concerning the food (see Chapter 14 for
more on that topic), and in many cases, a favorite plate, spoon, and fork help
your child be more positive about the eating experience. In fact, this is
empowering for your child.
You’ll find plenty of fun and festive plates, bowls, forks, and spoons at most
department stores or at your local superstore. Look for your child’s favorite
cartoon characters and even movie figures; have your child help pick out his
plate, bowl, and utensils and explain that he’ll be using these to eat his meals.
Invent Mealtime Games
You’re probably familiar with the game parents play with their young children
to help them eat: the airplane. You know, you make airplane noises and fly
the spoon around until it reaches your child’s mouth, and your kid sits there
320
Part VI: The Part of Tens 

with his mouth closed and looks at you like you’re the idiot (the airplane 
usually only works on infants just starting to eat). As your child ages, you can
continue to put simple games to work if your child is having a tough time
with a picky phase.
As your child learns how to count, have your child count bites (but not to
reach a goal of a particular number of bites) with you and practice verbal
skills with the names of the different foods. These tactics often help distract
your child from his position of not eating and get him a bit more interested in
trying something new. Keep everything positive and keep mealtime a good
time. Here are a few examples to get you started:
 Name the food: Play a game where your child tries to name every food
being served (and this gives you a chance to teach new foods). For com-
bination dishes, see if he can name some of the individual ingredients.
After your toddler starts learning the names, you can also teach him
what food group the food belongs to.
 Counting games: Try to use various counting games. Have your child
count the number of beans on his plate, or count the number of bites
he’s taken. The idea is to get his mind off the concept of eating and over
to the concept of counting.
 Round robin storytelling: You’ll need everyone in your family to play
along. This game starts with the parent. The parent gives a starting line
for a made up story, such as “Once upon a time there was an alligator.”
The parent then takes a bite of food. Next, your child has to add a sen-
tence to the story, “And the alligator lived in a swamp.” Then your child
has to take a bite. This game can go around and around the table.
Everyone plays, but most importantly, everyone eats while they’re 
playing!
Make a Food Chart
You may not realize it, but children are meticulous by nature. They often like
to organize and count, and they tend to see life in “black and white,” concrete
terms. Put this developmental behavior to work with a chart of foods.
Create a chart on a piece of poster board with listings of the foods in
MyPyramid for Kids (in fact, make the chart to look like a pyramid). You 
can spice up this chart by using pictures of the various foods. Then, pick 
up some adhesive gold stars and simply star the foods that your child has
already tried. Then, as your child tries a new food, place a star on the chart
next to the food.
321
Chapter 17: Ten Tips to Get Your Child to Try New Foods

As your child looks at the poster, he may not like the fact that some stars are
missing. So, when you want to introduce a new food, you can talk about how
your child will get a star. Filling the poster with stars appeals to your child’s
meticulous nature and it will help expand his range of food options. We know
of several people who’ve tried this approach with picky eaters and have
ended up with kids who are much more open to trying something new.
Model Positive Behavior
It’s always helpful to model good behavior for your child. When your family
makes a meal, have everyone (including older siblings — young children
often want to do what their older siblings do) eat the same foods that your
little ones are eating. You may even want to talk about the ingredients in the
meal. Try to pique your youngster’s interest. This modeling behavior helps
your child to be more open to trying foods, thus reducing the pickiness
factor. However, don’t use this time as a “sales conference” to try and get
your child to eat. Model eating behavior, but don’t try to convince your child
to try it just because you’re eating it.

W
hen it comes to their kids, all parents can use extra
help and guidance from time to time — if you’re
part of that club, you’ve come to the right place. In this
part, you find three helpful appendixes that make your
baby-food-making journey easier. In Appendix A, we pro-
vide a measurement conversion chart that shows you how
to convert teaspoons, tablespoons, cups, and so forth, to
different measurements. In Appendix B, we give you a
handy collection of food logs where you can track new
foods that you feed your child, when you feed them, your
child’s reaction (to watch for possible allergies or intoler-
ances), and his or her likes and dislikes. To help you orga-
nize your baby’s meals for a week, in Appendix C, we cap
off the book by laying out some suggested menus, divided
by age, that use the recipes in this book.

Appendix B
Food Logs
T
hroughout this book, we talk a lot about introducing new foods. After 
all, as your child grows, you increasingly expand his food options and
choices, and variety is important. You don’t want him to get bored with your
cooking (and you want to emphasize healthy choices, of course). Naturally,
you’ll need to watch out for food allergies or intolerances as you serve your
latest creations, and the handy charts you find in this appendix give you a
quick and easy way to log what foods your child tries, and any reactions and
preferences to certain foods. (Head to Chapter 13 for an in-depth look at the
most common childhood allergies and intolerances.)
We’ve organized this appendix into five different logs — one for each of the
different USDA food categories — so you can easily keep track of each food
group. As your baby grows, you’ll introduce new foods. Record the food in
the appropriate food category log as a way to track your baby’s new foods.
Each food log contains the following categories:
 Food: Write down the name of the new food your child eats. Be specific.
For example, in the log for Grains, don’t just write “bread.” Write down
the specific kind. The specifics track the new food exactly.
 Dates offered to child: Include the initial date when you offered the food
and jot down subsequent dates as well for the first few feedings.
 Reaction? What type? Possible food allergy or intolerance: After you
offer a new food, watch closely for signs of allergies or intolerances.
Record your findings in this column. In the event that an allergy or intol-
erance occurs, you’ll have a detailed log to take to the doctor. Remember
that you should offer a food for at least five consecutive days to rule out
possible allergies or intolerances.
 Like or dislike? Other foods preferred with: Write down your child’s
preferences and note other foods served that made the new food accept-
able. Children may need to try a new food several times in a row (some
dieticians say ten times or more) before they take a liking to it.
 Other observations: Write down additional observations that you make.
Keep in mind that some foods are known problems for younger children.
Never give a child under 1 year old honey because of the risk of botulism.
Also, nuts, peanuts, peanut butter, and shellfish are all known allergens, and
these should be avoided until age 2. See Chapter 2 for more about foods and
potential allergen-causing foods.

Appendix C
Sample Menus
T
his book contains a lot of delightful recipes that you can prepare for your
young one. In case you’re having a tough time getting started or want to
ensure that your child gets a balanced diet, in this appendix we’ve included
some helpful, seven-day menus built around the recipes and age brackets
that you find in this book. 
Remember to refer to the chapters where the recipes are pulled from for
important information regarding food combining and introducing new foods.
You can quickly locate the page a particular recipe is on by checking out the
Recipes at a Glance section in the very front of this book. The Recipes at a
Glance section lists every recipe in this book and the chapters they’re in.
Meal Plans for 5- to 6-Month-Olds
During the 4- to 6-month age range, you begin serving cereals and introducing
purees. Keep in mind that you should introduce new foods slowly because 
of allergy issues (see respective recipe chapters for more information), but
after your child begins building a good repertoire of foods, around the age of
6 months, you can use this handy menu.
Keep in mind that during this age range, you should still feed breast milk or
formula on demand — you don’t want to create a completely structured meal
plan for children this age. Their main nutritional component is breast milk or
formula, so keep that in mind as you plan.

Meal Plans for 6- to 12-Month-Olds
When your infant passes the 6-month mark, you continue to introduce new
foods with the ones that you’re currently serving, but you also realize that
your baby eats more with each passing day. This trend continues until your
child is about 12 months old. This eating pattern makes your menu selections
more important (so you balance nutrition at mealtime) and even complex
(trying to please your baby) at times. 
It’s important to realize that this menu includes combination meals that can
be served in a more chunky fashion when children are in the 10- to 12-month
age range. So, if you’re looking at this menu and your baby is still 6 months
old, you’ll need to make sure that you first slowly introduce some of these
dishes and graduate up to some of the ones that are chunkier in nature.
Keep in mind that “milk” as shown in the menu refers to breast milk or for-
mula. Children should not be given cow’s milk until after 1 year of age.
Remember that breast milk and formula are still a primary part of your
child’s diet. You can also serve water in a sippy cup.

Meal Plans for 12- to 18-Month-Olds
Your baby enjoys many different foods and recipes at this stage of growth.
Use the following menu options to get your week off to the right start!
During this age range, your child transitions from breast milk or formula to
whole cow’s milk. You should give cow’s milk, juice, or water in a sippy cup
by this age. Limit juice to about 8 ounces daily, and don’t offer too much in
between meals because it will fill your child up and keep her from eating well.
Instead, serve water if your little one is thirsty.

Meal Plans for 18-Month- to 2-Year-Olds
By this age, flexibility is your friend when you feed your toddler. Your tyke
shows an interest in a wide variety of foods, but may experience picky spells
as well. 
Be careful of items that present choking hazards during this stage of the
game, such as hard candy or whole grapes. Make sure that foods are cut into
small, bite-size pieces. This sample menu helps give your child a varied and
healthy diet.

Meal Plans for 2-Year-Olds
When your kid reaches the age of 2, his menu options grow again. You can
serve many foods from any of the previous menus, including most of the
foods your family eats. Continue to watch out for choking hazards, and it’s a
good idea to reduce whole milk to 2 percent in order to lower the fat intake.
Use this sample menu as a guide to give your child a balanced diet and to
combat the picky eating behaviors that can exist during this age.
