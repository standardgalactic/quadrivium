Basic Computer Concepts
make these tasks faster, easier, more efficient, and more 
accurate. 
Computers are all around us, which makes it important 
to learn basic computing skills and gain the knowledge to 
be a responsible computer user. Knowing how to use and 
maintain a computer ethically and responsibly makes you 
computer fluent.
This chapter looks at different types of computers 
and their functions. It discusses computer hardware and 
software, and the benefits of networking, responsible 
behaviors of both physical and social networking, and the 
importance of safe computing practices. It shows the ways 
with which you can protect your computer from various 
threats and be proactive in its maintenance.
In This Chapter
Computers are an integral part of our lives. They are 
found everywhere today, in both personal and business 
settings. Computers are part of cars and phones, and 
they enable you to access bank accounts from home, 
shop online, and quickly communicate with people 
around the world by means of email and the Internet. It 
is difficult to find a business or occupation that doesn’t 
rely on computers, whether it’s a truck driver who keeps 
an electronic travel log, a high-powered stockbroker 
who needs up-to-the-second market information, or a 
doctor who sends in your prescription and has it filled 
while you are at your appointment. Computers can

What are the benefits of becoming computer fluent? Becoming computer fluent can 
benefit you in several ways. One advantage of being computer fluent is that it makes employees 
more attractive to potential employers. Most employers expect employees to have basic computer 
skills when they are hired, whether you work indoors or outdoors. Computers have certainly 
changed the way people work. The traditional memo has given way to email messages. Business 
reports can be shared on a network, enabling a group of individuals to collaborate by adding their 
own notes and comments before a report is finalized. Presentation graphic software is widely 
used to share information with an audience in a conference room or through the organization’s 
intranet. Spreadsheet software is a key tool in presenting financial information and developing 
sound business plans.
Also, if you are knowledgeable about computers and their uses, it makes you a better 
consumer. You feel more comfortable when it comes to purchasing the right computer hardware 
and software for your needs, adding a peripheral for a specific use, or detecting basic problems 
when a system does not work properly. If you have a basic understanding of today’s technology, 
you can better understand and use new technologies.
What are the basic functions of a computer?  A computer is a programmable electronic device 
that can input, process, output, and store data. The term programmable signifies that a device 
can be instructed to perform a task or a function when provided with a program or software. A 
computer takes data and converts it into information. Data represents text, numbers, graphics, 
sounds, and videos entered into the computer’s memory during input operations.
Information is data that has been processed so that it can be presented in an organized and 
meaningful way. Think of data as the pieces of a jigsaw puzzle and information as the finished 
puzzle. Putting the pieces of the puzzle together gives you the overall picture. For example, 
CIS1100, the letter B, and the name Amy Stevens are pieces of data. Individually, these pieces of 
data seem meaningless. However, when processed, this data becomes the information on a grade 
report that indicates Amy Stevens received a grade of B in her CIS 1100 class.
These four basic computer functions work in a cycle known as the information processing 
cycle. See Figure 1.1.
Objective 1	 Define Computer and Identify the Four Basic  
Computing Functions

C o m p u t e r  C o n c e p t s
Objective 1: Define Computer and Identify the Four Basic Computing Functions  |  Computer Concepts       3
The functions of this cycle are:
• Input—The computer gathers data or enables a user to enter data.
• Process—Data is manipulated and converted into information.
• Output—Information is displayed or shown to the user in a way that is understandable.
• Storage—Data or information is stored for future use.
In the grade report, the instructor used a computer to enter, or input, the students’ grades into 
the school’s computerized grading system. A computer then processed this data along with data 
for other classes the student might have taken. In the example, the student Amy then received 
a written record of her grade or she accessed her grades online. The grade report was output by 
the computer. In addition, her grades remain stored in the system so they can be used to generate 
her transcript or to determine her future grade point average as she continues to take classes. See 
Figure 1.2.

What are the different types of computers and what are their uses?  Although 
computers come in a variety of sizes and shapes, the basic components required to complete the 
information processing cycle must be present in them. In addition to microcomputers (see Figure 1.3),  
which include the desktop, laptop, tablet computers, and mobile devices that many of you are 
familiar with, there are also specialty computers, including servers, mainframes, supercomputers, 
and embedded computers.

Objective 2: Identify the Different Types of Computers  |  Computer Concepts       5
Microcomputers
What are microcomputers? The term microcomputer means that the main component of 
a computer is a microprocessor, a tiny but powerful chip that is very small in size compared to a 
mainframe or a supercomputer. Microcomputers are classified as small, inexpensive, and designed 
for personal use or as part of a network of computers in a business environment. Computers in 
this category range in size from a desktop size system that is ideal when portability is not required, 
to handheld devices that fit in your pocket. Some of the most common types of microcomputers 
include the following:
• Desktop computers are computers that sit on the desk, floor, or table, and typically have 
a detachable keyboard, mouse, monitor, and possibly other peripheral devices, such as 
digital cameras, scanners, and music players. Desktop computers are used in many homes 
and in business environments where portability is not needed. They can be configured 
in a multitude of arrangements depending on the specific needs and budget constraints. 
To configure means to put together by selecting a specific combination of components, 
features, and options.
Desktop computers generally fall into two main categories: PCs or Macs. The PC, 
or personal computer, originally referred to as the IBM personal computer when it was 
released in the early 1980s, is now manufactured by a variety of companies including 
Lenovo, HP, and Dell. Today, the term PC applies to any personal computer based on an 
Intel microprocessor, or on an Intel-compatible microprocessor. The Apple Macintosh 
computer, now known as Mac, is manufactured exclusively by Apple Inc. with an Intel 
microprocessor and can perform the same functions as the PC.
There are pros and cons to both types of computers, but in reality both are good 
systems and the choice usually comes down to personal preference. The primary 
differences between the PC and the Mac relate to the different operating system and user 
interface, the application software, and the cost and availability of parts and accessories.

6             Computer Concepts  |  Chapter 1: Basic Computer Concepts
The PC typically uses the Microsoft Windows operating environment, and the Mac uses the 
Mac operating system. Although the PC and the Mac each process information differently, 
both can perform the same types of tasks. The PC has a larger market share among general 
computer users and in business settings, whereas the Mac is popular with graphic design, 
advertising, and professional audio and film industries. Applications have become cross-
platformable between the Mac and PC over the years, so regardless of your preference, 
these days you can share most files between operating systems.
• Gaming computers are mostly used by video game enthusiasts. They are usually configured 
with a fast central processing unit (CPU), a large amount of memory, a special video card, a 
joystick or game pad, and a sound card with a surround sound speaker system.
• Laptop computers are ideal for people “on-the-go.” Equipped with rechargeable batteries, 
they are designed to be portable, permitting them to be used in a variety of places. 
Averaging about 6 pounds, a laptop’s size and weight can also limit its computing power. 
Laptops typically have a built-in display screen, a keyboard, and a pointing device; although 
it is possible to connect them to detachable devices for more comfortable desktop use. You 
can use a docking station to connect a laptop to a full-size keyboard, monitor, and other 
devices in any setting.
• Tablet computers are similar to laptops because they are portable; however, they have some 
special features that set them apart. Tablet computers have a convertible touchscreen that 
swivels, enabling the tablet to be used like a standard laptop computer in one position or 
like a clipboard in the second position. When used in the tablet configuration, the user can 
actually write directly on the screen by using a special pen known as a stylus, which is a 
pointed device used to input information and access various features right on the device’s 
screen. Tablets use advanced handwriting-recognition technology to convert handwriting 
to digital text. Many also use speech-recognition technology, such as JAWS or ADA free, 
which enables the user to record discussions or lectures, or to control the computer 
functions by using voice commands.
• Mobile devices include items such as smartphones, portable music players, and e-readers. 
These devices vary in size and purpose, but they are all ultra-lightweight and portable. 
Smartphones add Internet capability to the wireless communication aspects of cell phones. 
Portable music players permit people to download, store, and enjoy music, podcasts, 
and sometimes videos, while e-readers make it possible to do the same thing with books, 
magazines, and other publications.
Servers
What are servers? When computers are connected together in a network environment, 
servers are specialized computers that manage network resources through the use of 
administrative software. See Figure 1.4.

1
C o m p u t e r  C o n c e p t s
Objective 2: Identify the Different Types of Computers  |  Computer Concepts       7
They provide other computers with access to the network and can handle a variety of functions 
or may be assigned to only one particular type of task. Thus, within the same organization, you 
might find an Intranet server that handles the organization’s private, internal network, a web server 
that stores and delivers the organization’s webpage, a file server that handles the storage and retrieval 
tasks for all of the organization’s files, and a printer server that handles all print requests. Also, virtual 
servers (not real, but an abstraction) can manage other specialized servers without the added cost of 
additional hardware.
What are mainframe computers?  Mainframe computers are large computers often found in 
large businesses, organizations, and government agencies where thousands of users must simulta-
neously use the data and resources of their institution (see Figure 1.5).
Figure 1.4  Network server
Edelweiss/Fotolia

8             Computer Concepts  |  Chapter 1: Basic Computer Concepts
Mainframe computers multitask; that is, they can perform more than one task at a time. 
Mainframes can store vast amounts of data by using a variety of storage. Mainframes are often 
used for high-security applications, bulk data processing such as data surveys, census, and 
statistics. Early mainframe computers were very large and required separate rooms to house 
them, while today’s mainframes are significantly smaller, faster, and more powerful than their 
predecessors.
Supercomputers
What are supercomputers? Supercomputers are large, powerful, and ultrafast computers 
that perform specialized tasks. Some of these are used for research, processing intensive scientific 
calculations, and multi-scale simulations.
Supercomputers (see Figure 1.6 for an example of a supercomputer) are the fastest and most 
expensive computers. Unlike a mainframe computer that can handle a number of programs 
simultaneously, the supercomputer is designed to run fewer programs at one time, but to do so as 
quickly as possible. They perform sophisticated mathematical calculations, track weather patterns, 
monitor satellites, and perform other complex, dedicated tasks.
The Titan, a supercomputer at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory in Tennessee, was built by 
Cray (www.cray.com), and features the same types of CPUs used in current personal computers 
and GPUs (graphical processing units) used in gaming computers today. By example, this would 
be the equivalent of 1,000 people performing one calculation per second for 60,000 years to be able 
to complete what the Titan can complete in only one second. Titan’s ultimate accomplishment, 
however, is its miniscule use of energy while performing these intense calculations at lightning 
speed (Lavelle, 2012). Its cost was approximately $100 million.

Objective 3: Describe Hardware Devices and Their Uses  |  Computer Concepts       9
There are many high-level scientific uses touted for the astonishing Titan. Some of the most 
anxiously anticipated tasks currently scheduled are creating climate change models with extreme 
accuracy, designing more fuel-efficient sustainable automobile systems, improved output and 
safety of nuclear power reactors, and producing super-powered magnets to drive electric motors 
and generators, especially in automobiles.
Embedded Computers
What are embedded computers?  Embedded computers are small specialized computers 
built into larger components such as automobiles. Functions such as emission control systems, 
antilock braking systems (ABS), airbags, and stability control systems are common in today’s 
vehicles. These computers use a specially programmed microprocessor to perform a set of 
predefined tasks, and may require little or no input from the user. Other devices that use 
embedded computers include electronic devices, microwave ovens, digital cameras, programmable 
thermostats, medical devices, clocks, and diagnostic equipment.
Figure 1.6  A supercomputer’s common configuration. It would take 1,000 people performing one  
calculation per second for 60,000 years to be able to complete what the Titan supercomputer can 
­complete in only one second.
Objective 3	 Describe Hardware Devices and Their Uses
What is computer hardware?  Hardware is the computer and any equipment connected 
to it. Hardware devices are the physical components of the computer. Items such as the monitor, 
keyboard, mouse, and printer, or any hardware connected through your network, are known as 
peripheral devices, because they attach to the computer, are accessed from the computer, and are 
controlled by the computer. 
The computer itself is known as the system unit, and it contains many of the critical hardware 
and electrical components. In a desktop PC, the system unit is sometimes referred to as the tower, 
box, computer, or console. When the system unit is combined with the appropriate peripheral 
devices, the system can perform the four basic computer functions: input, process, output, and 
storage. Peripheral devices are used to input and output data and information, and the system unit 
processes and stores the data.

What is inside the system unit? If you remove the cover from the system unit, you will 
find several key components inside. One of the most essential components is the motherboard, 
a large printed circuit board to which all the other components are connected (see Figure 1.7). 
The microprocessor chip is also known as the central processing unit (CPU). RAM, also known 
as random access memory, is the computer’s main memory (temporary working memory). 
ROM (read only memory) is nonvolatile, cannot be changed, and provides quick execution of 
commands due to the fact that it does not have to be processed each time. All of these components 
are connected to the motherboard (see the table in Figure 1.8). The motherboard also provides 
some of the ports used to connect peripheral devices to the system.

Temporary storage area where data is stored before processing, output, or storage. RAM 
is the center of the flow of data and information within the information processing cycle.
Read Only Memory (ROM)
Nonvolatile, permanent read-only memory, which contains the initial program that runs 
at startup of the computer, known as the boot process.
Expansion slots
Connectors on the motherboard that allow you to connect expansion cards.
Expansion cards
Removable circuit boards used to add new peripherals or increase the computer’s 
capabilities. If the motherboard does not have a specific port to connect a peripheral 
device, the appropriate expansion card will allow you to do so.
Ports
Connecting points used as an interface between peripherals and the motherboard.

Are there different types of keyboards? The keyboard is the primary input device for 
computers. There are actually several different kinds of keyboards. The QWERTY keyboard 
is the most common one. It is based on the original typewriter keyboard and is named for the 
arrangement of the letters on the upper left alphabetic row of keys. Another style is the Dvorak 
keyboard, which arranges the letters and numbers in a different pattern for increased typing speed.

Some ergonomic keyboards use a split keyboard arrangement, offsetting each half at an angle to 
reduce the incidence of repetitive stress injuries such as carpal tunnel syndrome.
Keyboard size and layout on laptop and tablet computers can differ slightly from a standard 
keyboard due to space constraints. Keyboards usually send information to the computer through 
a cable connected to a USB port; however, wireless keyboards are gaining in popularity. A wireless 
keyboard communicates with the computer by infrared or radio frequency technology. These 
wireless devices require batteries.
What are all these other keys used for?  In addition to the standard alphanumeric keys 
originally found on typewriters, computer keyboards have a variety of keys that provide additional 
functionality.
Control keys, such as the Ctrl, Alt, and Windows keys, often provide shortcuts or increased 
functionality to the keyboard when used in combination with another key. If you press the Shift 
key and a letter, the result is an uppercase, rather than a lowercase, letter. In the same way, using 
one of the control keys enables the standard keys to be used for additional purposes. For example, 
pressing Ctrl and the letter P opens the Print dialog box. Another example of a control key is 
the Esc key, which can often be used to stop, or escape, from a currently running task. A unique 
control key that is found only on Windows-based keyboards is the Windows key.
The numeric keypad, located at the right of the keyboard, provides an alternate method of 
quickly entering numbers. This is useful for individuals who are accustomed to using an adding 
machine or calculator.
Function keys are located above the standard row of number keys. Numbered F1 through F12, 
these keys are generally associated with certain software-specific commands. Pressing the F1 key 
will usually open the Help menu for a program; however, pressing one of the other function keys 
can produce different results, depending on the software program running.
Arrow keys are the keys located at the lower portion of the keyboard between the standard 
keys and the numeric keypad. These keys enable the user to move the insertion point around the 
window one space at a time.
Toggle and other keys, which are located just above the arrow keys, are used for various 
purposes including navigation and editing. The Insert, Num Lock, and Caps Lock keys are all 
examples of toggle keys. A toggle key works like a light switch; press it once and the feature is 
turned on, press it again and it is turned off. If you’ve ever accidentally pressed the Caps Lock key 
and typed a long string of all capital letters, you’ve seen this feature in action. Pressing the Caps 
Lock key again allows you to return to normal keyboarding mode. Num lock allows you to switch 
the number pad from numeric entry (when on) to navigational uses (when off).
Multimedia and Internet control keys are typically found at the upper edge of the keyboard. 
The precise placement and function of these keys usually depend on the keyboard manufacturer. 
However, most modern keyboards have at least a few keys or buttons that can be used for such 
tasks as muting or adjusting speaker volume, opening a web browser, and sending an email 
message. Generally, each key has an icon that indicates its function and is programmable to use 
your default email and web applications, among others.
Is there an easier way to control the action on the computer screen?  Yes, the mouse is 
an input device (also called a pointing device) that, together with the keyboard, enables the user 
to control the operations of the computer. The mouse became popular with the introduction of 
graphical user interfaces, such as Microsoft Windows. This point-and-click device is useful for 
positioning the insertion point by translating hand movements into corresponding actions on the 
screen. The mouse is represented on the screen by a symbol called the mouse pointer. The user 
can move the mouse and position this pointer anywhere on the screen, click and drag to move 
­objects, or make selections from available program icons or menus.

Older mice may have a roller ball on the bottom that, as you move it, translates your 
movement into electrical impulses. Newer mice use laser technology (optical) to control the 
pointer movement. Because the bottom of an optical mouse is sealed, dirt and debris are less likely 
to get inside and interfere with the mouse’s internal mechanisms. This laser beam can be harmful 
if pointed at your eyes; do not look at it directly or point it at anybody else’s eyes. Like a keyboard, 
the mouse can be wired or wireless. Laptop and tablet computers can use a mouse, but most of 
them have a built-in touchpad, a trackball, or track point to move the insertion point and mouse 
pointer. Most mice today are equipped with two buttons and a scroll wheel in the center that 
provides easy zoom and scroll functions.
How can the mouse be used more efficiently? Although there are different kinds of mice, 
the traditional mouse has two buttons and a scroll wheel. The palm of your hand should rest 
comfortably over the mouse in such a way that your index finger rests on the left mouse button 
and the middle finger on the right mouse button. The following provides a brief description of 
some of the ways the mouse can be used:
• Click—By default, the left mouse button is considered the primary button. When instructed 
to click, it is understood that the mouse pointer is moved to a certain location on the screen 
and the left mouse button is pressed and released one time to reposition the insertion point.
• Double-click—When instructed to double-click, it is understood that the mouse pointer 
is moved to a certain location on the screen and the left mouse button is pressed and 
released two times in rapid succession. Double-clicking is used to open an item or launch 
an application. It is important that the mouse does not move while double-clicking or the 
command will not produce the expected results.
• Drag—This means to press the left mouse button and continue to hold it while dragging, or 
moving, the mouse then releasing it. This action can be used to select large blocks of text, to 
move objects, or to resize other objects.
• Right-click—Pressing and releasing the right mouse button one time will open a shortcut 
menu. Shortcut menus are usually context-sensitive, which means they will vary depending 
on what or where you have clicked and what program you are using. The right mouse 
button is also known as the secondary button and is not typically pressed more than one 
time; no double-clicking for the right button. After the shortcut menu has been opened, 
you select the appropriate choice by clicking it with the left mouse button.
• Right-drag—This is done by pressing the right mouse button and continuing to hold 
it while dragging, or moving, the mouse. This action is used when copying, moving, or 
linking files or folders within different storage devices.
• Scroll wheel—If your mouse is equipped with a scroll wheel, it can be used to quickly move 
a page up or down in a window, thus the name of the action to scroll. It is an easy way to 
navigate through lengthy documents or websites. Combined with the control key, the scroll 
wheel can easily zoom in or out of pages on the web and in most applications.
Are there other input devices? Although the keyboard and mouse are the two most 
common input devices, there are many other input devices. Scanners are similar to copy 
machines, but instead of producing a paper copy, they convert documents or photos to digital files 
that can then be saved on your computer. Microphones are used to digitally capture and record 
sounds. Game controls such as joysticks are used to control movement within video games. Digital 
cameras and digital video recorders enable you to capture digital images and movies and transfer 
them directly to your computer.
What does the CPU do? The CPU or processor (see Figure 1.10) is the brain of the computer 
and is responsible for executing program instructions and manipulating data to convert to 
information. It has two main parts—the control unit and the arithmetic logic unit (ALU). The 
control unit is responsible for obtaining and executing instructions from the computer’s memory. 
Example: The user wants to print a document and selects the “Print” command from an icon on 

14             Computer Concepts  |  Chapter 1: Basic Computer Concepts
the screen. The CPU gets the command from memory (RAM), interprets the command, and sends 
the document as output to a selected printer. In other words, the CPU coordinates the internal 
activities and the activities of all the other computer components. The arithmetic logic unit 
(ALU) performs the arithmetic and logic functions for the computer. The ALU handles addition, 
subtraction, multiplication, and division, and also makes logical and comparison decisions. This 
enables the CPU to perform tasks such as sorting data alphabetically or numerically and filtering 
data to locate specific criteria.
Figure 1.10  Two sides of a CPU
Different Types of CPUs
As important as the CPU is to your computer, you might expect it to take up a large amount of 
space in the console. However, the CPU is actually rather small, thus the term microchip. Over the 
years, manufacturers have successfully reduced the size of microprocessor chips while continuing 
to increase their computing power. In fact, Moore’s law (formulated in 1965 by Gordon Moore, 
cofounder of Intel) addresses this increase in computing power, observing that current production 
methods enable CPU capacity to double about every 24 months or so! Where will we be next year? 
Exabyte may be typical.
Are there different brands of CPUs? Yes, the most well-known chip manufacturers include 
Intel and Advanced Micro Devices (AMD). Chip manufacturers often produce several different 
models of chips. Some of the chips that Intel makes include the Intel® Core™ i7 processor Extreme 
Edition, the Intel® Core™2 Quad Processor for desktops, and the Intel® Centrino® 2 Processor 
Technology for portable computers. AMD manufactures chips such as the AMD Phenom™ II X4 for 
desktops and the AMD Turion™ X2 Ultra Dual-Core Mobile Processor for portable computers. Intel 
and AMD chips are the mainstays for PCs. Using multiple processors (dual-core or quad-core) has 
several advantages over a single-processor CPU, including improved multitasking capabilities and 
system performance, lower power consumption, reduced usage of system resources, and lower heat 
emissions.
How is a CPU’s processing power measured? One indicator of a CPU’s processing power 
is its clock speed. Clock speed measures the speed at which a CPU processes data (number of 
instructions per second) and is measured in hertz (Hz); these days usually gigahertz (GHz). Early 
computers had CPUs that processed at speeds of less than 5 megahertz (MHz), whereas modern 
processors can operate at over 3 GHz (the equivalent of 3,000 MHz) and newer processors continue 
to surpass these numbers.
What types of memory does a computer have?  Memory is another critical computer 
component of a computer system. The term memory signifies storage. There are two basic types 
of memory: temporary or volatile and permanent or nonvolatile.

Figure 1.11  Random Access Memory (RAM) / RAM chips on left and Read Only Memory 
(ROM) / ROM chip on right.
Permanent memory includes read-only memory (ROM), which is prerecorded on a chip. 
The information on a ROM chip cannot be changed, removed, or rewritten, and is generally 
inaccessible to the computer user. ROM is nonvolatile memory because it retains its contents even 
if the computer is turned off. ROM contains critical information, such as the program used to start 
up or boot the computer.
Storage devices such as hard disks and flash drives and storage media such as CDs and DVDs 
are considered permanent or nonvolatile memory. These are presented later in this chapter.
Temporary memory, the computer’s volatile memory, is Random Access Memory (RAM). 
(See Figure 1.11.)
Random access memory (RAM) acts as the computer’s short-term memory and stores data 
and program instructions waiting to be processed. RAM is considered volatile because it’s always 
in flux, constantly changing, and its contents are erased when the computer is turned off.
Why is it important to have enough RAM? The more tasks your computer performs at the 
same time, or the more programs you have open, the more RAM it uses. Recall the description of 
RAM as the center of the flow of data and information in the information processing cycle (see 
Figure 1.1). That flow slows down when there is not enough RAM. Your computer’s RAM is like 
the upper portion of your desk. The size of the desk that you need is determined by the work you 
do at a given moment. You may use a laptop computer, several books, a clipboard with notes, a 
holder for pens and pencils, and a telephone. If your desk is not big enough to fit these items, you 
cannot work with all of them at the same time. If you do not have a sufficient amount of RAM in 
your system, you might notice your computer slows down or even stops responding when you try 
to perform tasks.
Computer users often think this means they have too much information saved on their 
computers’ hard drives. What it actually means is that they are running out of memory, not 
permanent storage space. To fix this problem, you can reduce the number of programs running at the 
same time, disable some features of the operating system, or add more RAM to your system. Installing 
additional memory is one of the most inexpensive and easiest upgrades for your computer and often 
results in noticeable performance improvements. It is, in fact, the combination of the processor’s speed 
and amount of RAM that gives your computer its overall quickness of performance.
Memory is measured in units of bytes such as megabytes (MB), gigabytes (GB), and terabytes 
(TB). One megabyte is approximately one million bytes, one gigabyte is one billion bytes, and one 
terabyte is one trillion bytes. Additional information can be found in the table in Figure 1.12.

16             Computer Concepts  |  Chapter 1: Basic Computer Concepts
RAM size requirements vary depending on the operating system in use. Older computers 
that run Windows XP should have between 512 MB to 1 GB of RAM. For newer computers, a 
minimum of 2 GB or more is recommended. Computers today are commonly configured with 
anywhere from 2 GB to 1 TB of RAM.
Output Devices
Output devices display information after data has been processed in a useful format. This 
format can be text, graphics, audio, or video. Monitors and printers are the two most common 
output devices.
What are monitors? Monitors are display devices that show images of text, graphics, and 
video once data has been processed. The image on a monitor is called soft copy; you can view it, 
but you cannot touch it; it is intangible. See Figure 1.13.

Figure 1.13  Output devices—monitors
Touch screen display
LCD Wide monitor
What is an LCD monitor? Monitors come in a variety of sizes and styles, but the standard 
today is the liquid crystal display (LCD). Flat-panel LCD monitors use a liquid crystal display 
and are thin and energy efficient.
What factors determine a monitor’s display quality? A monitor’s display is made up of 
millions of tiny dots known as pixels or picture elements. Each pixel represents a single point on 
a display screen or in a graphic image. The number of pixels on the screen determines a monitor’s 
sharpness and clarity, also known as its resolution. A higher number of pixels results in a clearer 
and sharper monitor resolution and smaller image size. A standard screen resolution might be 
expressed as 1,024 × 768, which means there are 1,024 columns, each containing 768 pixels, for a 
total of more than 786,000 pixels on the screen. Monitor sizes are determined by measuring their 
screens diagonally.
Dot pitch is another display characteristic and refers to the diagonal distance between two 
pixels of the same color. Dot pitch is measured in millimeters with smaller measurements resulting 
in a crisper viewing image because there is less blank space between the pixels. For best viewing, 
monitors should have a dot pitch measurement of .28 mm or less. LCD monitors use an electric 
current to illuminate the pixels.
Refresh rate is the speed at which the pixels are reilluminated and it’s measured in cycles per 
second, expressed as hertz (Hz). Refresh rates generally run 75 Hz or higher, which means the 
screen image is redrawn 75 or more times per second. Higher refresh rates result in less screen 
flicker and less eye strain.
What are touchscreen monitors? Touchscreen monitors are both input and output devices. 
They display images like regular monitors, but also enable users to touch their surfaces and make 
selections directly from the screen. These monitors are widely used in retail stores at checkout 
counters and in airports for passengers’ fast check-ins. Android touchscreens include 7 and 10 
inch tablets. Apple’s iPad and iPhone also use touchscreens.
Which monitor is best? Choosing the right monitor is always a combination of what you like, 
want, and can afford. A higher resolution, small dot pitch, fast refresh rate, and large monitor size 
are desirable, but all come with a higher price tag.
Using a monitor is a good way to view the information on your computer, but sometimes a 
soft copy isn’t sufficient for your needs. Printers generate hard copies or printouts, which are a 
permanent record of your work on paper. See Figure 1.14 for some examples of printers.
Tombaky / Fotolia; Y. L. Photographies / Fotolia; 

18             Computer Concepts  |  Chapter 1: Basic Computer Concepts
What types of printers are available? There are two categories of printers: impact and 
nonimpact. Impact printers have small hammers, similar to a typewriter’s, that strike an ink 
ribbon against paper, leaving behind the image of the character or symbol. The dot matrix printer 
is an impact printer. Use today is limited only to certain applications that require continuous 
forms or multipart forms (an original and several copies), such as invoices or purchase orders.
How does a nonimpact printer work? Nonimpact printers do not actually touch the paper 
when printing. There are a variety of nonimpact printers, but the two most commonly used with 
home computers are the ink-jet printer and the laser printer. The ink-jet printer uses a special 
nozzle and ink cartridges to spray ink in small droplets onto the surface of the paper. Ink-jet 
printers easily print in color, in black, and in grayscale to produce good quality printouts. They are 
relatively inexpensive to buy and maintain. Laser printers use the same process as photocopiers 
to produce their output. They use a special cylinder known as a drum, dry ink or toner, and a 
laser. Static electricity attracts toner to the surface of the drum, and the laser distributes the toner 
in the correct pattern. The drum transfers the toner to the paper and heat is used to permanently 
fuse the toner to the paper. Laser printers are generally more expensive to purchase than ink-jet 
printers, although they often print more quickly and are more cost effective. Lower-end laser 
printers print only in black and white; however, more expensive printers can produce color copies.
How do you assess a printer’s capabilities? When you select a printer, there are some key 
characteristics to consider.
Print speed is often expressed as pages per minute (ppm). Print speed can vary depending on 
the manufacturer and model, and is also affected by whether the page is text-only, if it includes 
graphics, and if the printout is in color, black, or grayscale.
Just as with monitors, resolution is also important to print quality. For printing purposes, 
resolution is expressed as dots per inch or dpi. The higher the dpi, the better the print quality will 
be. Print qualities of 300 to 600 dpi are typical of most printers, although special photo printers 
can offer resolutions up to 1,200 dpi. Professional printers can reach 2,400 to 3,600 dpi for pages 
such as art plates in high quality reproduction books and textbooks.

Objective 3: Describe Hardware Devices and Their Uses  |  Computer Concepts       19
Color output and its related cost is another important consideration. Ink-jet printers offer 
four- or six-color options. Many ink-jet printers use one cartridge for black ink and one or more 
cartridges for color. When available, printers that offer a separate cartridge for each color are a 
practical choice because you can replace only one color at a time as the cartridges run out. Laser 
printers use separate toner cartridges for each color.
What are all-in-one printers?  All-in-one printers, or multifunction devices (MFD), bundle 
multiple capabilities in one device. All-in-one devices usually include:
• A printer, either ink-jet or laser (output)
• A scanner to convert text or images into files that can be stored and further manipulated by 
the computer (input)
• A copier function to duplicate documents (output)
• Network capabilities to enable this multifunction device (MFD) to work as part of a wired 
or wireless network environment (communications)
• A facsimile (fax) function to send and receive documents through the telephone 
(communications)
Are there other output devices?  Speakers and multimedia projectors are also examples 
of output devices. Many computers include small speakers to enable the user to listen to CDs 
or DVDs and hear any auditory signals the computer sends. However, if you’re serious about 
multimedia, you will probably want to invest in a better set of speakers for improved performance. 
Multimedia projectors are used to conduct presentations and training sessions. These projectors 
enable information to be displayed on a big screen, so it can be easily viewed by a large group of 
attendees.
Under what category do digital cameras fall?  A digital camera is a device that stores 
pictures digitally rather than by using conventional film. After images are captured, they are stored 
in the camera’s internal memory. Some cameras use removable flash memory cards as storage 
media. These cards can be read by a computer, which can then edit them and save them as files. 
So, the camera itself is a form of handheld computer, which, if connected to a computer, serves as 
an input/output device (I/O). The same thing can be said to describe camcorders.
Storage Devices
What are storage devices? Storage devices are used to store data, information, and 
programs for future use. This storage is often referred to as permanent memory because, unlike 
data that is in RAM, data saved to a storage device remains there until the user deletes or 
overwrites it. Data can be stored by using internal hardware devices located in the system unit or 
in removable units that enable portability. See Figure 1.15.

20             Computer Concepts  |  Chapter 1: Basic Computer Concepts
How is a storage device different from storage media? A device is a piece of hardware 
such as a hard drive or a DVD drive. Media is the removable part that actually contains the stored 
data. Media requires a device to read and write on it. Read is the action of retrieving or opening 
existing data and write is the action of saving or storing data. Following is a list of devices and 
their media:
• CD and DVD optical drives read and write on CDs and DVDs, which are the media.
• Card readers read and write on flash memory cards, which are the media.
• USB drives, also known as flash drives or thumb drives, are media that require a connection 
to a USB port for read/write operations.
• Tape backup drives read and write onto tape cartridges, which are the media.
• The exception to this is the hard drive, in which the hardware and the media are all 
contained in a sealed unit that cannot be taken apart.
How is data stored? Data is generally stored by using one of three forms of storage: 
magnetic, optical, or solid state storage:
Magnetic storage uses tape or film covered in a thin, magnetic coating that enables data to be 
saved as magnetic impulses. It works in much the same fashion as an audiocassette or videotape 
works. Hard drives and backup tape drives are both forms of magnetic storage. Before magnetic 
storage can occur, media has to be formatted. This is the process in which media is divided into 
tracks and sectors. Tracks are magnetic concentric circles and sectors are segments within those 
circles. Data is stored magnetically within the spaces created by these tracks and sectors. Magnetic 
media has read/write capability, which means it is possible to use it over and over again, enabling 
you to delete or revise existing data and save new data.
Hard disk drive—A hard disk drive is the computer’s main internal magnetic storage device. 
Also referred to as a hard drive, its storage space is usually measured in gigabytes (GB). In the 
1990s, the 1 GB drive was developed. By 2013, computers’ drives ranged in size from 500 GB up to 
4 TB. Hard drives are permanent storage devices fixed inside the system unit.

Backup tape drives are storage devices that resemble audiocassette tape recorders and save 
data to magnetic tape media. Although they are rarely used for home computers anymore, many 
businesses and organizations still rely on tape backup systems to safeguard their data on a daily 
basis. See Figure 1.16.
Figure 1.16  Tape backup drive and media
The capacity of the components found in your system unit is measured in terms of storage 
size or speed. Computer systems continue to increase in storage capacity and computing speed, 
while decreasing in physical size. Generally, higher measurements indicate a system that is quicker 
and more powerful than a system with lower measurements. However, it is important to balance 
size and speed with financial considerations too. Although it is tempting to consider buying a 
computer with the most power possible, a lesser computer may be more reasonably priced and still 
be sufficient for the typical user’s needs. Recall that CPU speed is measured in gigahertz (GHz). 
The amount of RAM and storage space in a computer are measured in gigabytes (GB).
• Optical storage uses flat plastic disks coated in a special reflective material. Data is saved 
by using a laser beam to burn tiny pits into the storage medium. A less intensive laser is 
used to read the saved data. The saved data is organized by using tracks and sectors, similar 
to those used in magnetic media. Compact discs (CDs) and digital video discs (DVDs) 
are examples of optical media. Unlike magnetic media, not all optical storage is read/write 
capable. CD-ROMs—CD media that was burned once and from that moment on can only 
be read—and DVD-ROMs—DVD media that is burned once and from that moment on can 
only be read—are considered read-only media (ROM). The information contained on them 
can be read, but not changed or deleted, and it is not possible to save new data to them. If 
you purchase new software, music, or a movie, it is most likely on a CD-ROM or DVD-
ROM. A record-only disk (CD-R) enables you to record, or burn, information to the disk 
one time only; information saved this way cannot be deleted or rewritten. A rewritable disk 
(CD-RW) enables information to be recorded, revised, or deleted, and new data can also be 
written to the disk, similar to magnetic media. The same possibilities are available in DVDs. 
However, there are currently two competing formats DVD-R/RW, known as “DVD dash,” 
and DVD+R/RW, known as “DVD plus.” The R/RW suffix indicates the DVD can be used 
Roman Ivaschenko / Fotolia

22             Computer Concepts  |  Chapter 1: Basic Computer Concepts
to record and can also be rewritten. Although most DVD players can play either format, if 
you want to record to a DVD, you must know which format the DVD recorder requires.
	
CD and DVD drives—Your computer may have one or two of these optical drives in the 
system unit. It’s important to know whether these drives are simple CD-ROM drives, which 
can only read CDs, or if it is a CD-RW drive, also known as a CD burner. A CD burner 
gives you the ability to save, or burn, files to a CD-R (compact disk recordable). You might 
also have a separate drive that can read and write DVDs.
	
Although CDs and DVDs look alike, DVDs are capable of holding much more information 
than CDs. A CD can hold up to 700 MB of data, but a DVD can store almost 10 GB! 
Because of their differences, a CD drive is unable to read DVDs, although a DVD drive  
can read CDs.
• LightScribe is a disk-labeling technology that burns text and graphics onto the surface of a 
specially coated LightScribe CD or DVD. This is an alternative to printing a conventional 
sticker label and attaching it to a regular CD or DVD, but it does require that you purchase 
LightScribe media. See Figure 1.17.

• Solid-State Storage uses solid-state technology. It is completely electronic and has 
no moving mechanical parts. Also called flash memory, it is a quick and easy form of 
rewritable storage and is often used in mobile devices such as smartphones, digital cameras, 
and MP3 players. Depending on the manufacturer, flash memory cards may be called 
Memory Stick, CompactFlash, Secure Digital, or MultiMediaCard. Typically, a device can 
use only one style of memory card; however, a computer equipped with the appropriate

card reader can read any of them. Small, removable storage devices known as USB drives, 
flash drives, or thumb drives also use solid-state technology, require a USB port to connect 
to the system unit, and are very popular for transporting data.
Flash drives are removable storage devices that use flash memory and connect to the 
computer by a USB port. Flash drives are also known as thumb drives, universal serial bus (USB) 
drives, and jump drives. The flash drive is typically a device small enough to fit on a keychain 
or in a pocket and, because of its solid-state circuitry and lack of moving parts, it is extremely 
durable. Available in several common storage sizes ranging from 16 MB to 512 GB; the Victorinox 
company has released both a 512 GB secure SSD flash drive and a Swiss Army Knife 256 GB 
and 1 TB solid state storage (Victorinox, 2012). A flash drive is a quick and easy way to save and 
transport files. To use one of these devices, you plug it into a computer’s USB port. The computer 
recognizes the new device and enables the user to save or retrieve files from the flash drive.
Is it possible to add a storage device to a system? If you are running out of hard disk 
space or your system doesn’t have a particular storage device, it may be possible to add a storage 
device, provided your system has enough space for it. You would need an available drive bay, 
which is the physical location within the system unit, or you might consider removing an existing 
device and replacing it with another. For instance, if you only have a CD-ROM drive, you could 
remove that and replace it with a DVD±RW drive, thereby giving you the ability to play and burn 
both CDs and DVDs. It is also possible to purchase many of these units as external storage devices. 
An external storage device is a peripheral that attaches to the computer through a port and 
performs the same tasks as its corresponding internal device. One of the most popular of these 
today is the external hard drive, which can greatly increase a computer’s storage capacity and make 
your data fully portable. In 2013, you could purchase a 5.1’’ × 1.6’’ × 6.6’’ external 3 TB, USB 3.0, 
removable hard drive for approximately $150. How far we have come in such a short time!
Ports
A port acts as an interface or connector between a system’s peripheral devices and the 
computer, enabling data to be exchanged easily. The ports shown on the laptop in Figure 1.18 
have different shapes and sizes. The same ports are typically found on a desktop too, although 
they might be arranged in a different order. Various input and output devices use different data 
exchange methods, requiring different types of ports and connectors (or plugs). If your computer 
does not have a particular port, you can buy an expansion card that connects to the motherboard 
and provides the needed connection.

24             Computer Concepts  |  Chapter 1: Basic Computer Concepts
How do you determine which port a peripheral device needs? Manufacturers have 
attempted to make the process of connecting peripheral devices less complicated on newer computers. 
Rather than trying to match the size and shape of a connector to its port, many manufacturers use 
a color-coding system that coordinates the colors of the connectors with their corresponding ports. 
Additionally, most desktop computers include ports, such as USB and audio ports, on the front panel 
of the system unit to provide easier access to them. Locating these ports on the front panel makes it 
a simple process to connect and disconnect devices that are used only occasionally, such as digital 
cameras, external hard drives, or MP3 players. Peripherals that are rarely disconnected, such as a 
keyboard or printer, are generally plugged into the ports on the back of the computer.
What are the different ports used for? Serial and parallel ports are two of the oldest types 
of ports found on a computer. Serial ports are ports that can send data only one bit at a time, 
so the data exchange rate is slow compared to newer technology. The maximum rate at which 
a standard serial port can transfer data is 115 kilobits (Kbps) or one thousand bits per second. 
The mouse and modem are examples of devices that might use a serial port. A parallel port is a 
port that sends data in groups of bits, at transfer rates of up to 500 Kbps, so it is a considerably 
faster method of transferring data than the serial port. Older printers were often connected to a 
computer through a parallel port.
Are there faster ports? Over the years, newer ports have come into existence. One of these 
is the universal serial bus (USB) port. This type of port is able to interface with several different 
peripheral devices, which reduces the need for individual, dedicated ports. USB ports are also 
able to transfer data at extremely high rates of speed. Original USB ports, known as USB 1.1, 
are capable of speeds of 12 megabits (Mbps) or one million bits per second. The next version, 
USB 2.0, can attain a rate of 480 Mbps, 40 times faster than USB 1.1 technology and over 400 
times faster than a serial port! USB 2.0 ports are backward compatible, which means that older 
USB devices work with them; however, data will transfer only at the slower USB 1.1 speed. The 
newer USB 3.0 attains blazing transfer rates of 4.8 Gbps! The higher data transfer capabilities of 
USB ports, coupled with their capability to work with multiple devices, have made the older serial 
and parallel ports obsolete. Because of the USB port’s speedy data transfer rate and its capability 
to be used with numerous devices, new computers often include six or more USB ports. Devices 
using USB ports include keyboards, mice, printers, scanners, digital cameras, MP3 players, and 
external hard drives. In general, it’s a good idea to get a computer with as many USB ports as 
possible. See the table in Figure 1.19.

Objective 3: Describe Hardware Devices and Their Uses  |  Computer Concepts       25
The FireWire port, developed by Apple and also known as IEEE 1394, is another means 
of transferring data quickly. The FireWire 400 has a data transfer rate of 400 Mbps, while 
the newer FireWire 800 transfers data at a mighty 800 Mbps; two times as fast as USB 2.0. 
This port is typically used to connect devices that must transfer huge amounts of data to a 
computer quickly, such as digital cameras or digital video recorders, or external hard drives. 
FireWire ports are standard on many Apple products, but are usually found only on higher-
end Windows PCs and peripheral devices. USB 3.0 was originally developed for use with 
fiber optic cables, with transfer capabilities of 5Gbps, theoretically 10 times faster than USB 
2.0. It is considered overkill unless you are working with extremely large HDMI or video files 
constantly. Some peripheral devices offer users a choice of connecting by using a USB port or  
a FireWire port.
What kind of port is used to connect to another computer? Connectivity ports, such as 
Ethernet and modem ports, are used to connect a computer to a local network or to the Internet. 
An Ethernet port, also known as an RJ-45 jack, resembles a standard phone jack, but is slightly 
larger. The Ethernet port is used for network access and can also be used to connect a cable 
modem or router for Internet access. A modem port is the same size and shape as a phone jack 
and is used to connect the modem to a phone system, enabling digital subscriber line (DSL) or 
dial-up Internet access. DSL is a type of communications line in which signals travel through 
copper wires between a telephone switching station and a home or business. The maximum data 
transfer rate for a dial-up modem is 56 Kbps, whereas the most common Ethernet standard, 
Fast Ethernet, transfers data at the rate of 100 Mbps. However, Gigabit Ethernet, with a potential 
transfer rate of 1,000 Mbps, is becoming an option on higher-end systems and is standard on 
many Mac systems.
Even faster Ethernet technologies, such as 10 Gigabit Ethernet or 10 GbE exist, but they are 
currently used for network backbones and enterprise network infrastructures rather than home 
users. We currently have the technology to create Ethernet with speeds ranging from 400 Gbps to 
1 Tbps; however, the cost may make their production prohibitive.
Are there special-purpose ports? Despite the prevalence of USB ports, which can be used 
for a variety of peripherals, there are still some devices that require special ports. These ports 
include Musical Instrument Digital Interface (MIDI), High-Definition Multimedia Interface 
(HDMI), IrDA, Bluetooth, video, and audio ports.
MIDI ports are used to connect electronic musical devices, such as keyboards and 
synthesizers, to a computer, enabling musicians to create digital music files.
HDMI ports are used to connect electronic devices, such as an iPad, to a digital television, 
computer, or projector. Due to the fact that HDMI is compatible with digital video interface 
(DVI), no conversion is necessary. HD movies can be played directly on TV from your  
digital device.
The IrDA port is used to enable devices such as keyboards, mice, and printers to transmit 
data wirelessly to another device by using infrared light waves. To transmit information, each of 
the devices must have an IrDA port, and a clear line of sight, with no other objects blocking the 
transmission.
Bluetooth is another type of wireless technology that relies on radio wave transmission and 
doesn’t require a clear line of sight. Bluetooth-enabled devices such as smartphones or other 
mobile devices can communicate only with each other over short distances, typically less than  
30 feet.
Video ports include standard monitor ports, DVI ports, and S-video ports. A monitor 
port is used to connect the monitor to the graphics processing unit, which is usually located 
on the motherboard or on a video card. However, to get the best results from an LCD monitor, 
the Digital Video Interface (DVI) port should be used instead. The DVI port transmits a 
pure digital signal, eliminating the need for digital to analog conversion and resulting in a 

26             Computer Concepts  |  Chapter 1: Basic Computer Concepts
higher quality transmission and a clearer picture on the monitor. The S-video port is typically 
used to connect other video sources, such as a television, projector, or digital recorder, to the 
computer.
Similar to video ports, audio ports connect audio devices, such as speakers, headphones, and 
microphones, to the computer’s sound card. These jacks will be familiar to anyone who is used to 
using standard stereo components.
Evaluating Your System
The way a computer system is set up or the combination of components that make up the 
system is called its configuration. Different computers can be configured in different ways. This is 
important when buying a computer, expanding an existing system, or when connecting computers 
together in a network environment.
Now that you have learned most of the hardware components of a typical personal computer, 
you are ready to explore the computer’s configuration, specifications, and features. If you didn’t 
buy your computer brand new, you might not know all the details about your computer. If 
you did buy a new computer, the easiest way to find out is to check your paperwork; all the 
basic information should be there. However, if your computer isn’t new or you didn’t keep the 
paperwork, there are some ways to determine exactly what is in your system. Also if you start a 
new job or a new position and are given a computer system, you can do a number of things again 
to determine exactly what is in your system.
What kind of computer do you have?  This is one of the easiest questions to answer. Like 
almost every other appliance you’ve used, you can probably find the manufacturer’s name and a 
brand name or model number on the case of the computer. If not, check the back of the unit; there 
should be a metal tag that includes the manufacturer’s name, model number, and serial number. 
This information might be necessary if you have to have service performed under warranty. To 
see your system properties in Windows 7 or 8, press 
 + 
—the Properties window will open 
automatically using this keyboard shortcut. Alternatively, in Windows 8, from the Control Panel, 
click System and Security and then click System.
What operating system does the computer use? If you watch carefully as a computer 
boots up, you can often determine the operating system. You will usually see a splash screen 
showing the version of Windows that runs—for example, Windows XP, Windows 7, or Windows 8 
which was released in December 2012.
How much memory is in the computer? What is the type and speed of the CPU? See 
Figure 1.20 that displays the System Properties window for several versions of Windows, with 
information on the computer’s operating system, the type and speed of the CPU, and the amount 
of RAM that is installed.

Objective 3: Describe Hardware Devices and Their Uses  |  Computer Concepts       27
How do you determine what drives are on the system and how much storage space is 
available? It’s important to know how much information you can store on your computer, what 
disk drives are available, and how much space you have left on each drive. Is there enough storage 
space or are the storage devices getting full? Use File Explorer in Windows 8 or Windows Explorer 
in previous versions of Windows to find the answers. You can open File Explorer (or Windows 
Explorer) by using the shortcut key 
 + 
. 
Figure 1.21 shows the the File Explorer window open to the Computer view in which the user 
can see all available local drives (devices within the system unit or peripherals connected to that 
unit) and network drives (devices available through a network). You can also right-click on any 
drive symbol and select Properties from the shortcut menu. A new dialog box displays the drive’s 
information similar to the one shown in Figure 1.22. The pie chart displayed on the General Tab is 
a good visual tool that shows the size of your storage device and how much space is free.

28             Computer Concepts  |  Chapter 1: Basic Computer Concepts
So far we have described computer hardware, the physical components of the system. 
However, without software, the computer would only be a collection of useless electronic and 
mechanical parts. Software provides the instructions or commands that tell the computer what 
to do. To perform various tasks, the computer requires a set of instructions called programs 
or applications. These programs enable individuals to use the computer without the need for 
special programming skills. There are two categories of computer software—system software and 
application software. Both types of software are required to work effectively with your computer.

Objective 4: Identify Types of Software and Their Uses  |  Computer Concepts       29
System Software
System software provides the instructions that the computer needs to run. It contains 
the directions needed to start up the computer (known as the boot process), checks to ensure 
everything is in good working order, and enables you to interface or interact with the computer 
and its peripheral devices so that you can use them. System software consists of two main 
programs: the operating system and utility programs.
What is the operating system? The operating system (OS) is a special computer program 
that is present on every desktop computer, laptop, smartphone, server, or mainframe. The 
operating system controls the way the computer works from the time it is turned on until it is 
shut down. The operating system manages the various hardware components, including the CPU, 
memory, storage devices, peripheral devices, and network devices. It also coordinates with the 
various software applications presently running and provides the interaction with the user (user 
interface).
Figure 1.23  System Software Hierarchy, Model by Kari Pace Meck
Figure 1.23 demonstrates the organizational hierarchy of system software. All software, system 
and application, is a collection of files working together to provide the user experience. All are 
stored within the system software hierarchy, which keeps track of where they are located. Deleting 
software files randomly disrupts this organization and can create problems. To properly add or 
remove software, installation and removal programs must be run to insure all related files are 
added or removed appropriately throughout the system hierarchy.
Is it possible to communicate with the operating system? Although the operating system 
communicates with the computer and its peripherals, it also includes a user interface that you can 
use to interact and communicate with the computer. Early operating systems used a text-based 
or keyboard-driven interface. The early Disk Operating System (DOS) required knowledge of 
special commands that had to be typed accurately to achieve the desired results. This type of 
system was not very user friendly. Most current operating systems use a point-and-click format 
known as a graphical user interface (GUI). GUIs are more user friendly and intuitive than DOS 
systems. Rather than typing specific commands, you can use a mouse to select from on screen 
objects such as icons (a graphical depiction of an object such as a file or program), menus (lists of 
available commands), or dialog boxes (windows used to make choices or give the system specific 

30             Computer Concepts  |  Chapter 1: Basic Computer Concepts
instructions as to the action you want to take or task to perform). GUI operating systems display 
information on the monitor in the form of rectangular boxes called windows. Although you 
interact with system software every time you use the computer, in some ways you don’t notice it.
Do all computers need an operating system? Yes, the operating system is a critical part of a 
computer system. Without an OS to provide specific instructions, the computer would be unable to 
fulfill its four main functions. The operating system provides a way for the user to interact with the 
computer, it manages the processor, memory and storage, and the system’s hardware and peripherals. 
It provides a consistent means for software applications to work with the CPU. However, different 
computers require different types of operating systems. There are several popular operating systems 
available for home computers. They include Microsoft Windows, Mac OS, and Linux.
Microsoft Windows has the largest market share of the three main operating systems and 
is found on most of today’s desktop and laptop computers. There have been many versions of 
Microsoft Windows, including Windows XP, Windows Vista, Windows 7, and Windows 8. 
Although a previous version of Windows might be found on an older computer, new computers 
are shipped with Windows 8 already installed. A sample of the new Windows 8 desktop is 
displayed in Figure 1.24.
Why are there so many versions of Windows? Software developers are always updating and 
refining their software to adapt to new technology, respond to vulnerabilities, and improve their product. 
Because Microsoft also manufactures application software, some of its products have similar names 
and users can become confused. It’s important to note that even though your computer might use 
Microsoft Windows for its operating system, it might not have Microsoft Office (an application software 
suite) installed. The newest operating system is Windows 8, which has been optimized for touchscreen 
performance. Microsoft’s newest suite of office productivity software is Office 2013, which has cloud 
capabilities (see Objective 6, Describe Networks and Define Network Terms for cloud computing).
Mac OS is an operating system designed specifically for Apple’s Macintosh computers. 
Figure 1.25 shows the Mac OS desktop that is similar to Windows because it also uses a GUI. In 
fact, Apple was the first company to introduce a commercially successful GUI operating system in 
1984, named System, for the consumer market. The naming convention was OS1 through OSX. 
Versions 10.0 through 10.8, now use names of big cats. They are: Cheetah, Puma, Jaguar, Panther, 
Tiger, Leopard, Snow Leopard, Lion, and the current OS, Mountain Lion.

Objective 4: Identify Types of Software and Their Uses  |  Computer Concepts       31
Due to the popularity of the Windows-based PCs, Mac OS has a much smaller market share. 
If you are looking to purchase a PC or a peripheral for a PC, you have a variety of choices among 
different manufacturers. Apple manufactures products and peripherals solely for its computers 
and they tend to be a bit pricier.
Can Windows run on an Apple computer? Yes, there is software available to enable a Mac to 
run Windows applications. Microsoft’s Virtual PC or Apple’s Bootcamp allow you to perform tasks 
such as:
• Access all types of files, networks, and devices with your Mac from your PC
• Cut and paste between platforms; share applications, file types, folders, and other media 
between OS platforms
• Easily shut down virtual PC and re-launch right where it left off
• Use PC and Mac peripherals
Linux is an alternative operating system. Based on the UNIX operating system developed for 
mainframe computers, it also has a dedicated group of users. Linux is an open-source operating 
system, which means it is not owned by a single company and some versions are available at  
no cost.
How is open-source software different from other types of software? Open-source 
software makes its source code, essentially the program instructions, available to anyone who 
would like to see it. Programmers are encouraged to work with and change the code as they 
see fit, in the hope that having many “eyes” looking at the code will streamline and improve it. 
Proprietary software, such as Microsoft Windows, keeps this code secret and inaccessible to 
programmers who are not authorized by the software development company.
Why is Linux used?  Linux is rarely used by novice desktop computer users although it is 
popular among developers and other technologically advanced individuals who prefer to use an 
alternative operating system for building a variety of computing systems. Some people appreciate 
the opportunity to work in this more “open” programming environment. Because no single

company is responsible for the software, users might find help from various resources such as user 
groups and Internet communities. Alternatively, some software companies have chosen to develop 
and sell a version of Linux that includes a warranty and technical support. Figure 1.26 shows 
where the Linux kernel source code can be downloaded online.
Figure 1.26  Example of one of the versions of the Linux operating system
What are utility programs? Operating system software is the most critical software on the 
computer, because nothing can run without it. However, utility programs are another important 
component of system software. These small applications handle many important tasks involved 
with the management and maintenance of your system. Utility programs can be used to help 
back up important files, remove unwanted files or programs from your system, and schedule 
various tasks to keep your system running smoothly. Some of these utilities are included with the 
operating system, whereas others are stand-alone versions that you can purchase or download for 
free. The table in Figure 1.27 displays a variety of utility programs that ship with the Windows 
operating system, describing the function of each utility.

Application Software
Application software or applications consists of programs that enable you to accomplish tasks 
and use the computer in a productive manner. Applications are programs created to perform a 
specific task, solve a specific problem, or address a specific need.
How do system software and application software work together? System software 
is like the breathing you must do to live; however, you don’t usually think much about it unless 
something goes wrong. Application software might be compared to a musical instrument like a 
flute. When a musician combines each of these breaths and her flute, the result may be a beautiful

melody (if she has practiced, of course!). Computer software works together similarly; the system 
software acts as the “breath,” while the application software provides the “instrument,” enabling 
you to create something.
There are many different kinds of application software, although they often fall into one of 
several general categories, each of which has a different purpose. You might be most familiar with 
productivity software, which includes the following applications:
 
• 
Word processing software is used to create, edit, format, print, and save documents and 
other text-based files. Word processing software enables you to create or edit letters, 
reports, memos, and many other types of written documents that you can print or attach 
to an email message. Revisions to existing documents can be made quickly and easily, 
without having to re-create the entire document. Documents created with this type of 
software can also include pictures, charts, hyperlinks, and other graphic elements. A 
hyperlink is a connection to another area of a document or a connection to an Internet 
location. Microsoft Word, Lotus Word Pro, and Corel WordPerfect are all examples of 
word processing programs. A document created by using Microsoft Word 2013 is shown 
in Figure 1.28.
Notice that the document contains a graphic element in addition to text. Using word 
processing software replaces the use of conventional typewriters on which editing was virtually 
impossible once the document was finished.
Spreadsheet software enables the user to enter data in rows and columns format and:
• Perform calculations on numeric data with user-defined formulas.
• Convert part of the data into one or more charts, such as a column chart, pie chart, or line 
chart.

• Work with lists to organize data and sort it in alphabetic or numeric order.
• Create different scenarios and perform “what-if” analyses, the basis for sound decision 
making.
A key advantage of spreadsheet software is its capability to recalculate spreadsheets without 
user intervention. When data used in a calculation or a formula is changed, the spreadsheet 
software automatically updates the worksheet with the correct result. Microsoft Excel,  
Lotus 1-2-3, and Corel Quattro Pro are examples of spreadsheet programs. Figure 1.29 shows a 
worksheet and a chart created with Microsoft Excel 2013. The use of spreadsheet software replaces 
the old manual method of entering data in ledgers or journals and using a desktop calculator to do 
the math computations.
Figure 1.29  Example spreadsheet created with Microsoft Excel 2013
A database is a collection of data or unorganized facts. Database software is used to store, 
organize, update, and retrieve large amounts of data. Relational database management software 
(RDBMS) stores information in tables, which enable users quick access to the data by connecting 
tables with common fields. Data mining is a function in some databases that looks for hidden 
patterns in the data to anticipate future patterns. This is commonly used in scientific applications 
and as a marketing tool to predict future consumer trends. Typically, database software can be 
used to manage various types of information, such as that found in large mailing lists, inventories, 
students’ records, order histories, and invoicing. Databases help you to enter, store, sort, filter, 
retrieve, and summarize the information they contain and then generate meaningful reports. 
Common database programs include Microsoft Access, Lotus Approach, and Corel Paradox.

Presentation software has become a standard in presentations, replacing flip charts, slide 
projectors, or overhead transparencies used by speakers and lecturers. This software is used to 
create electronic slides and project slide shows to visually present materials and ideas to large 
groups in a conference room or on the web. Presentation software is also used to create audience 
handouts, speaker notes, and other materials that can be used during an oral presentation. 
Microsoft PowerPoint, Lotus Freelance Graphics, and Corel Presentations are examples of 
presentation software programs. Figure 1.31 shows a presentation created with Microsoft 
PowerPoint 2013.

Business communication and organizational software can cover a broad range of tasks 
including video conferencing and telephony. However, applications in this productivity category 
are most often used to send and receive email messages. These applications typically include an 
address book (contacts list), a scheduler, a calendar, and task functions, which help users organize 
their personal and professional responsibilities. Microsoft Outlook, Lotus Notes, and Corel 
WordPerfect Mail are examples of communication and organizational software. Figure 1.32 shows 
an example of a calendar in Microsoft Outlook 2013.

Social Communication and Personal Networking Software
Dictionary.com defines social network (for computers) as:
	
a)	 an online community of people with a common interest who use a website or other 
technologies to communicate with each other and share information, resources, and so 
on: a business-oriented social network.
	
b)	 a website or online service that facilitates this communication.
Social communication, by nature, includes any group of individuals who wants to interact 
with each other in a personal or business atmosphere. You can avoid the cost of phone calls, 
postage, and the time constraints of communicating with each other (locally or globally). Meetings 
that could take hours to get to, attend, and return from, now are at your disposal in moments. 
Only “a few clicks of a mouse,” “swipes” of a finger, or “pinches” to reduce an image, and you are at 
your meeting!
All forms of social networking are located in the cloud (including using an intranet for secure 
purposes at businesses large or small). You can communicate in real time using IM, Facetime, 
Skype, MagicJack, and VoIP; this type of commmunication is called synchronous, where both 
parties must be connected at the same time. Asynchronous software includes email, Facebook, 
LinkedIn, and text messaging. All forms of these applications may include text, pictures, 
documents, video, voice, streaming video, or any combination of these.
Whether using social communication for business or personal reasons, you always must 
remember your netiquette and tone. Even with the rampant use of emoticons J, and knowing 
that typing in all caps is not only lazy, it’s like yelling at someone; your physical expressions are 
not apparent and can easily be miscomprehended. Never respond asynchronously without careful 
consideration of how the content will be perceived. Likewise, remember that anything you post, 
whether text or image, IS PUBLIC FOREVER, perhaps long after you have forgotten about it.

38             Computer Concepts  |  Chapter 1: Basic Computer Concepts
Regarding the integrity of responsible, fluent computing, never post anything that could 
possibly be viewed in a negative light, especially if it does not belong to you, without permission of 
those involved.
What is a software suite? Although it is possible to buy any of the previous applications 
separately, most software manufacturers, including Microsoft, Corel, and Lotus, also group 
applications together into a package called a software suite. There is an alternative suite called 
OpenOffice and it’s free. It is designed as open-source software, and users can report bugs, request 
new features, or change and improve the software.
Another advantage of using a suite is that because products from the same organization have 
many common elements, such as basic window design and layout, toolbars containing similar 
tools, dictionaries, and media galleries, many users find this familiarity with the similar interfaces 
makes it easier to switch between the programs in a suite. Examples of suites include Microsoft 
Office, Corel WordPerfect Office, Lotus SmartSuite, and Adobe Creative Suites.
What are some other common software applications? Recall that there are many different 
types of application software besides productivity software, each one with a specific function. 
Some of these include the following:
• You might use Microsoft Publisher, QuarkXPress, or Adobe InDesign to create newsletters, 
brochures, or advertising pieces.
• Bookkeepers rely on special accounting packages such as Peachtree Accounting or 
QuickBooks to balance the books and handle other accounting functions.
• Graphic designers turn to packages such as Adobe Photoshop or Adobe Illustrator to 
develop creative artwork.
• You might use Microsoft Expression Web or Adobe Dreamweaver to create your own 
website.
Web Browser Software 
Web browsers are software used to locate and display websites and their pages and navigate 
through them. They also enable users to store their frequently used links for quick access to a 
particular location on the web. Current web browsers include Internet Explorer, Firefox, Safari, 
Mozilla, and Google Chrome.
If you have a specific question, chances are there is a search engine, to be accessed through 
any browser that will address those needs. Today, the best way to find software/hardware 
updates or find a plethora of information on a topic, both true and false, is to do a web search  
by using a search engine. Current free search engines include Google, Yahoo, Bing, Ask, and 
many others.
Objective 5	 Identify Ethically Responsible and Safe Computing Practices
Being computer fluent implies you are a responsible computer user. This means more than 
just understanding the key components of a computer or the differences between hardware and 
software. Responsible computer users also know how to properly maintain their computers, back 
up necessary data, and protect themselves and others from security breaches and attacks.
Computer Maintenance
Backup! The first step to protect your computer and the valuable information it contains 
is to establish a regular maintenance routine. Backup utility programs, which may be part of 
your system software or purchased separately, enable you to back up your files. You can back up 
everything on your computer, only one or two important files, or anything in between. People 

1
C o m p u t e r  C o n c e p t s
Objective 5: Identify Ethically Responsible and Safe Computing Practices  |  Computer Concepts       39
often think that the computer is the most expensive item to replace if their hard drive fails. In 
reality, it is usually all the lost information that was contained on the hard drive that is the most 
costly to replace, if it is even possible to do so. Think about the types of files you might have 
on your own computer like financial records, your personal phone/address directory, resumes, 
scanned images of important documents, homework or school projects, your CD collection and 
purchased music files, and family photos and videos. Imagine how you would re-create these 
files if they were irretrievably damaged. Would you be able to find them again? If you back up 
files on a regular basis and store the backups in a secure location, you lessen the impact that a 
mechanical failure or security breach will have on your data. Remember: your backup needs to be 
in a different location (drive) than the original; use flash, email attachment, cloud, or any other 
universal media. Trust me, you don’t usually do it until you lose something precious.
What other types of maintenance tasks should be performed? In addition to backing up 
files, regular file maintenance also helps to maintain order in your system. In Windows 7, several 
useful Windows utilities can be accessed from the System Tools folder. You can access the System 
Tools folder by clicking Start, clicking All Programs, and then clicking Accessories. In Windows 
8, go to the Control Panel, click System and Security, and then click Administrative Tools. Disk 
Defragmenter scans the hard drive and attempts to relocate files so they use the available hard 
drive space more efficiently. Recall that data is stored on hard drives in sectors and tracks. As file 
sizes change, they can outgrow their original location. When that happens, the remaining portion 
of the file may be stored elsewhere. If a file size decreases, or a file is deleted, this can create a 
blank area on the hard drive. Defragmenting a hard drive enables scattered portions of files to be 
regrouped and open spaces to be rearranged. This results in faster and more efficient file access, 
which improves the response time of the hard drive.
Is there a way to automate maintenance tasks?  Running these programs can be time 
consuming, especially when you want to use your computer for other tasks. It is also easy to forget 
to do these things on a regular basis. That is why newer versions of Windows include a Task 
Scheduler. This utility enables you to create a task and select the best time for each task to run, 
in addition to how often, which makes the whole process automatic. Figures 1.33 and 1.34 show 
the steps to follow to reach the Task Scheduler dialog box for Windows 7 and Windows 8 users, 
respectively.

Can changes to my system be undone? Sometimes when new software is installed on a 
computer, the results are not what you anticipated. Instead of playing a new game, you find your system 
stops responding each time you start it. Or, you might find the new driver you installed for your printer 
is causing conflicts. Even though you’ve tried to uninstall the software, the system is still not right.
Fortunately, if you are running a newer version of Windows, the System Restore utility comes 
to the rescue. Periodically, Windows creates a restore point, which records all the settings for your 
system. It’s similar to taking a picture of how everything is currently set up. Figures 1.35 and 1.36 
show steps to create a restore point for Windows 8 and 7 users, respectively.
Figure 1.36  Computer maintenance—steps to create a Restore Point (Windows 7 users)

42             Computer Concepts  |  Chapter 1: Basic Computer Concepts
It is also possible to set manual restore points, and it is highly recommended that you set one 
before installing new software or hardware, or when making any major changes to your system. If 
you experience a problem with your system after the new software is installed, you can roll your 
system back to an earlier restore point when the system was working correctly. Think of it as an 
Undo button for your operating system. The good news is, returning to an earlier restore point 
affects only your system settings. It does not delete any of the data files you may have created 
during the interval.
What other functions can you use to maintain a “healthy” computer? Following are some 
of the other things that keep computers healthy:
 
• 
Disk Cleanup—This is a group of tasks intended to free disk space occupied by Internet 
temporary files and hard drive unwanted files that accumulate from time to time.

Malware (Malicious Software)
Establishing the habit of performing regular maintenance on your computer is one way to protect 
your system, and yourself, from data loss. But there are many other dangers you must be aware of, 
too (see Figure 1.43). Viruses, spyware, and hackers are all out there waiting to pounce on the unwary 
computer user. Malware is any malicious software, usually acquired from spam or questionable web 
links. The term hacker, as used here, signifies an expert in computers and programming languages 
who uses his/her expertise to obtain unauthorized access to computer systems with the purpose of 
corrupting data or stealing information or only creating havoc with your system.

46             Computer Concepts  |  Chapter 1: Basic Computer Concepts
What are viruses and how do they get on the computer? Computer viruses are malicious 
code or software designed to invade your computer system and alter or destroy data without your 
knowledge and against your will. The severity of a virus can vary. Some viruses merely seem to 
be nuisances or might not even be obvious to the user; some cause files to be corrupted or erased; 
and others are capable of shutting down a computer and erasing the entire hard drive. Viruses 
infect a system and then attach themselves to a program or file to spread to other users.
Viruses can be distributed in several ways. In the early days of computers, viruses were 
spread by sharing infected floppy disks. Now, due to the ease in which files can be shared over the 
Internet, viruses are able to spread much more quickly. One of the most common ways to send 
a virus is through email attachments. Security experts recommend that you never open an email 
attachment unless you have first scanned it with antivirus software to determine that it is virus-
free. Experts also recommend that unless you know the sender and have been expecting the email 
attachment, it is best to delete the attachment without ever opening it. File-sharing services are 
another source for these types of problems.
Are viruses and worms the same thing? Worms are similar to viruses because they are also 
malicious programs that spread from computer to computer; however, unlike viruses, worms are 
able to do this without any human interaction and are able to replicate themselves, so numerous 
copies can be sent. Worms can burrow into your email address book, or locate email addresses 
on files saved on your hard drive, then send themselves out without any help from you. When it 
reaches the email recipient, it does the same thing to the recipient’s address book. Also, because 
worms can quickly replicate themselves, they can repeat this scenario over and over. The sheer 
amount of traffic they cause on a network can be enough to bring an entire organization to a 
grinding halt. Worms can also open a “back door” to your system, which provides hackers access 
to it and gives them the ability to control your computer remotely. Sasser, Blaster, NetSky, and 
MyDoom are all worms that have created a great deal of trouble in recent years.
Trojan horses are not truly viruses because they do not duplicate themselves or infect other 
files; however, they can be problematic because they may enable malware to be downloaded or 
allow hackers access to the computer. A botnet is a popular term for a group of software robots 
that run automatically in networks such as instant messenger, chat rooms, and discussion groups 
that have been made vulnerable by the presence of Trojan horses. Once inside a chat room, for 
instance, a botnet can generate spam, which is bulk unsolicited email messages sent to random 
lists of computer users. At first glance, a Trojan horse often appears to be a desirable software 
program, but in fact they facilitate unauthorized access to a computer system. Perhaps it is a free 
screensaver program or a set of animated mouse pointers. Unfortunately, these programs come 
with unwanted and hidden agendas. After the software is installed, the effects can be similar to 
those of viruses or worms. Before you install new software, it is important to scan the program 
files with antivirus software to ensure there are no Trojan horses lurking there. And, as with 
unknown email attachments, it is important to be skeptical about free software and shareware; it’s 
seldom that you really get something for nothing!
Spyware
How is spyware different from viruses? Spyware is software designed to capture 
personal and confidential information that resides on your system and send it elsewhere. It has 
quickly become as large a problem as viruses. Spyware’s primary threat is to your privacy and 
confidentiality. Although spyware is not usually intended to harm your system, it can sometimes 
have that effect on it. Adware is spyware that tracks your Internet browsing and can install 
malicious cookies on your computer. A cookie is a small text file that contains information that 
can identify you to a website. Cookies are not necessarily bad. They are useful when they are used 

1
C o m p u t e r  C o n c e p t s
Objective 5: Identify Ethically Responsible and Safe Computing Practices  |  Computer Concepts       47
to help personalize your web browsing experience, but cookies can threaten your privacy if they 
are used to reveal too much information.
How can you tell if spyware is on a computer? One symptom that indicates adware is on a 
computer is an increase in the number of pop-up ads the user receives, some of which might even 
address the user by name! Adware can generate pop-up ads even when you’re not online. Some 
types of adware can also reset a web browser’s home page to a page of its choosing and take control 
of the search engine, directing you to websites that have been predetermined by the adware.
Are there other privacy threats? Key loggers are another type of spyware. In this case, a 
software program records every keystroke made on the computer. Key loggers can capture all sorts 
of confidential information this way—passwords, credit card numbers, bank account numbers, 
and so on—and then relay this information elsewhere. Entire email messages and instant 
messaging conversations can be recorded this way too. Some key loggers are hardware, rather 
than software, although they perform the same devious function. Such hardware devices can be 
attached between the keyboard and the computer. The information stolen through the use of key 
loggers can easily make you a victim of identity theft. Trojan horses can be used to distribute key 
loggers and other types of spyware just as easily as they deliver viruses.
How can you avoid being a victim? To minimize the risk of having spyware installed on 
your computer, there are some practical precautions you can take. One of the most prevalent 
methods of spreading spyware is through file-sharing services, email attachments, and email or 
pop-up ad links. Not only can the file-sharing software include spyware, but often the files you 
think you are downloading for free are infected too. Although it’s tempting to get the newest video 
for free from such a site, don’t risk it!
This problem can be avoided if you use one of the legitimate, pay-as-you-go file-sharing 
services such as iTunes. Do not automatically trust files or software sent by friends or 
acquaintances and make it a habit to scan these items for viruses and spyware. Additionally, be 
cautious when you download and install freeware or shareware software. Be sure you deal with a 
reputable software publisher, scan the downloaded software for viruses and spyware, and read the 
licensing agreement. Some licensing agreements actually include information about additional 
software that will be automatically installed if you accept it. This could include anything from 
sharing all of your email contacts to authorizing unwanted spyware, which could possibly log 
every keystroke on your personal computer and return it to the hacker.
Another way to prevent spyware is to avoid pop-up and banner ads whenever possible. You 
should never click on them. Often the “No Thanks” button is only a ruse to get you to click it and 
enable the spyware installation. Close pop-up ads by clicking the Close button in the upper right 
corner. Installing pop-up blocking software can help to eliminate this risk almost entirely. If you 
have all pop-pup blockers turned on for security and want to over-ride it, hold the 
 key while 
clicking on the link.
If you are running the most recent version of Windows, you already have a pop-up blocker 
available to you. You can view the pop-up blocker settings for Windows 7 and 8 in Figures 1.39 
and 1.40 and access this dialog box through Internet Explorer’s Tools menu. Many popular search 
engines, such as Google and Yahoo! also include pop-up blocking features in their toolbars, which 
you can download at no charge. It is also wise to avoid questionable websites, because some of 
them can install spyware on your system simply by visiting the site.

48             Computer Concepts  |  Chapter 1: Basic Computer Concepts
Protecting Yourself and Your Computer
In addition to being cautious in your Internet travels, there are some proactive measures you 
can take to protect yourself and your computer from viruses and spyware. These include:
• Software updates and patches—Keeping your operating system and software up to date is 
critical. Software manufacturers are constantly on the lookout for security threats, and they 
issue updates and patches to help protect your system. Check for these and install them 
regularly. Software manufacturers have begun to implement automated procedures to check 
and install such updates. If your computer has this capability, it’s a good idea to use this 
feature.
• Antivirus and antispyware software—Antivirus software is a utility program used to 
search your hard drive and files for viruses, and remove those that are found. Antispyware 
software works in a similar fashion, but searches for spyware rather than viruses. No 
computer should be without this protection. Many users erroneously think that because 
they aren’t regularly online or use only a slow dial-up connection, they aren’t a target. 
Nothing could be further from the truth! Recent studies show more than two-thirds  
of all computer users have some form of virus or spyware on their system. Smartphone 
users and Apple users are also vulnerable to malware and should use protective  
software too.
There are a variety of antivirus and antispyware products available. Unfortunately, there are 
also a lot of dishonest companies purporting to offer these products. Too often, these are really 
scams that will actually install spyware or viruses on your system! To avoid being scammed or 
downloading something malicious, you should never respond to offers that are received in a 
pop-up ad or unsolicited email message. To obtain legitimate products, it is best to purchase them 
from the manufacturer’s website or from a local retailer, or from a trusted site (see Figure 1.44). 
Additionally, some Internet service providers are beginning to provide some of these products as 
part of their services.
Figure 1.44 
Some well-known antivirus products include Norton AntiVirus (www.symantec.com), and  
McAfee VirusScan (www.mcafee.com), both of which are free from some Internet Service 
Providers (ISP). You should be sure to read the software reviews and evaluate their usefulness 
before downloading or installing them.
It is best to use only one antivirus product, because running more than one can cause 
conflicts between the programs. However, because there are so many different types of spyware, 
antispyware products may address these problems in different ways. Experts recommend 
running at least two different antispyware applications to catch as many spyware programs as 

1
C o m p u t e r  C o n c e p t s
Objective 6: Describe Networks and Define Network Terms  |  Computer Concepts       49
possible. It’s not enough to install antivirus and antispyware software on your system; you must 
update it frequently, at least once a week. Doing so will protect you against any new viruses or 
spyware created since the last time you checked. Software should be set to scan incoming data 
files, email messages, and so on, but regular full-system scans should also be conducted on a 
weekly basis.
Personal firewalls—Firewalls may be software programs or hardware devices, although 
their purpose is the same—to prevent unauthorized access to your computer. When a 
firewall is installed properly, it can make your computer invisible to hackers and other 
invaders. Not only can a good firewall help prevent infections and identity theft, it can 
also prevent hackers from accessing your computer and turning it into a zombie. A zombie 
computer is one that can be added to a botnet and controlled remotely and can be used to 
help spread viruses, spyware, or junk email messages known as spam. Zombie computers can 
also be used in denial of service (DoS) attacks. DoS attacks occur when a large number of 
computers try to access a website at the same time, effectively overloading it and causing it 
to shut down. If you are using Windows XP or any newer version of Windows, you already 
have a firewall available to you.
You can access the firewall settings in Windows 7 by clicking Start, clicking Settings, clicking 
Control Panel, clicking Security, and then clicking Windows Firewall. In Windows 8, from the 
Control Panel, click System and Security, and then click Windows Firewall.
What else should I look for? It might sound simple, but when online, do not give out 
personal information unless it is for legitimate purposes. It is important to avoid spam email 
messages, and phishing attacks—email messages that masquerade as authentic entities, 
such as banks and credit card companies, and ask for confidential information. Legitimate 
organizations will not ask for passwords, bank account numbers, or credit card details through 
email. It is also possible to check for hoaxes and scams at a variety of websites (Snopes.com is 
a very good one), including many of the antivirus and antispyware sites. When in doubt, do 
some research to see if the request you’ve received is legitimate. If necessary, make a telephone 
call to the agency in question. Viewing such requests with a critical eye can help you avoid 
online scams and hoaxes.
You should never perform transactions on a site that does not have https: in its address. The s 
stands for secure. You will also see a closed lock icon, usually in your browser’s address bar, when 
you are on a secure site.
Objective 6	 Describe Networks and Define Network Terms
What are the components of a network?  Connecting one computer to another creates a 
network. Recall that computers and the various peripherals that are connected to them are called 
hardware. Networks consist of two or more connected computers plus the various peripheral 
devices that are attached to them. Each object connected to a network, whether it is a computer or 
a peripheral device, is known as a node.
Why are computers connected to networks?  Some of the benefits of computer networks 
include the capability to share data, software, and resources such as printers, scanners, Internet 
access, video conferencing, and VoIP. Computers can be connected to a network by using several 
types of media, the conductors of the network signals: existing telephone wires, power lines, 
coaxial cables, unshielded twisted pair (UTP) cables, and fiber optic.

50             Computer Concepts  |  Chapter 1: Basic Computer Concepts
Figure 1.45  Types of network media, the conductor of network signals
Today, by using computer networks, institutions are able to video conference, that is, 
simultaneously transmit audio and video between two or more individuals in different locations, 
optimizing communications, information sharing, and decision making.
Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) enables voice, facsimile, and voice-messaging 
communications over networks and the Internet.
Can networks be different sizes? A network that connects computers reasonably close 
together, say within a few city blocks in adjacent buildings, is called a local area network (LAN). 
See Figure 1.46.

Wireless networks use radio waves instead of wires or cables to connect. Most networks use a 
combination of wired and wireless communications (see Figure 1.45).

Objective 6: Describe Networks and Define Network Terms  |  Computer Concepts       51
If the network grows to cover a larger geographic area or begins to include other networks, 
it becomes a wide area network (WAN). An example is a state college campus that connects its 
computers with a LAN while all of its campuses connected together form a WAN. Because the 
different campuses are connected through WANs, students, faculty, staff, and administrators can 
easily and seamlessly use the resources of the entire network. Both LANs and WANs can be wired, 
wireless, or a combination of both. See Figure 1.47. The Internet is actually the largest WAN 
because it connects computer networks all around the world.

Are networks public or private?  They can be either. If you want to post information and make 
it available to any user, you post it on a website with no restrictions. If you want to protect certain 
information, you create an intranet in which access is restricted to authorized users only. Within an 
intranet, network administrators can limit the specific rights and privileges of different users.
How are networks configured?  Networks can be configured in several ways. There are two 
main categories: peer-to-peer and client-server. Peer-to-peer or P2P networks are most commonly 
found in homes and small businesses. In a peer-to-peer network, each node can communicate 
with every other node without a dedicated server or hierarchy among computers. Peer-to-peer 
networks are relatively easy to set up, but tend to be rather small. This makes them ideal for home 
use, although not as desirable in the workplace. If a network grows to more than, say, ten to fifteen 
nodes, it is generally best to use the client-server network. In a client-server network, the server 
manages and controls all network resources. Therefore, it isn’t difficult to find more than ten 
nodes in an office or business setting.
How is a client-server network different from a P2P network? Client-server networks 
typically have two different types of computers. The client, also known as a node, is the computer 
used at your desk or workstation to write letters, send email messages, produce invoices, or 
perform any of the many tasks that can be accomplished with a computer. The client computer 
is the one most people directly interact with. In contrast, the server computer is typically kept 
in a secure location and is used by network technicians and administrators to manage network 
resources. If a server is assigned to handle only specific tasks, it is known as a dedicated server. 
For instance, a web server is used to store and deliver web pages, a file server is used to store and

archive files, and a print server manages the printing resources for the network. Each of these is a 
dedicated server.
As a client-server network grows in number of nodes and geographical distance covered, servers 
are assisted by distance-spanning devices such as switches and routers to optimize data traffic.
Network topology describes the different types of network architecture used for networks (see 
Figure 1.48). Just as there are different sizes and styles of buildings that are designed for different 
purposes, networks are designed to be physically configured and connected in different ways.
Figure 1.48  Common network topologies
Which topologies are used most often? The most common layouts are explained in the 
following list:
• Bus topology—connects each node to a single, central high-speed line known as a bus. No 
server is used, and although it is possible for each node to communicate with all the others, 
they can only do so one at a time. If one computer or device is sending over the network, all the 
others must wait until the transmission is complete before they can begin. Because this is an 
inexpensive and easy way to connect, this topology is often found in peer-to-peer networks.
• Ring topology—sometimes known as token-ring topology, connects each node to the 
next, forming a loop or a circle. The data that’s sent is passed from node to node, traveling 
around the circle in only one direction. A token travels around the ring until one of the 
nodes is ready to send a transmission. The node then holds the token until the transmission 
is finished, preventing any of the other devices from sending until the token is released 
to make its way around the circle again. This type of topology gives each device an equal 
chance of being able to send data and prevents one node from doing all the communicating. 
This topology is being phased out in favor of star topology.
• Star topology—is the most frequent networking style used for businesses and homes. It offers a 
high degree of flexibility. Each node is connected to a special device known as a switch, which 
is centrally located. Each node must go through the switch to communicate with the others. If 
something happens to one node, the others are still able to communicate through the switch.
• Mesh topology—is redundant (meaning the duplication of elements to allow constant 
backup or non-interruption of services), a more reliable network than the others we have 
malginka / Fotolia

54             Computer Concepts  |  Chapter 1: Basic Computer Concepts
discussed. It is used for situations when the nodes are spread around in no particular order. 
If one node goes down, the others can communicate through a working node or directly. 
In the past, it was cost prohibitive because of the large number of cables and connections 
required. In this day of wireless networking, it has become more popular.
• Fully connected topology—is based on mesh topology, with the distinction being that each 
and every node is connected to all the others. Therefore, if any connection goes down, no 
one loses access to the network. Any fault or clog in the network can find a better path, of 
least resistance. 
The Cloud Topologies
What and where is “The Cloud”? Sounds ethereal, doesn’t it? Well, we don’t see it or touch 
it. You may have some of these questions since this cloud is intangible: Why are we only hearing 
about it now, when it has been in use since 1976 in some large companies and the government 
(those were intranets)? Can anyone use it? Is it safe? What would be the point of using it, and how 
would I use it? How much does it cost?
The cloud consists of a network of servers that we use every day. This is more familiarly 
known as the Internet. We now have the ability to use computer software while not having it 
installed on a local computer. The files created can then be stored in the cloud on a server and 
accessed or modified from any computer that has Internet access. All of your application software 
dictionaries and application preferences will display as they were last used, along with your 
desktop configuration being the same as your previous settings.
When we send an email message, it does not go from my computer to your computer directly. 
Packets of code actually follow network paths, whether wired or wireless. They bounce off 
satellites, towers, and so on, when it gets to a server, the packets reassemble, then are recompiled 
and sent on to the next server, and on it goes … until it reaches your personal device, perhaps all 
at different times.
The cloud allows us to store all of our information on a remote server so we can access it from 
almost any computerized device and also sync (synchronize—no duplications, no deletions, and 
so on, automatically). Now you can access any data from any device you have synced in to your 
other devices in the cloud. All of your file locations are linked to each other; some may be on one 
server, others on another server. It doesn’t matter to us. We just hit the correct command.
Google Drive, for instance, includes free file upload, download, and storage (larger storage for 
monthly fees, personal or business class). Google is easily navigated by new users. The interface is 
very similar to Microsoft Office 2010.
Microsoft Office 2013 has the ability to use cloud-based computing through Microsoft’s online 
storage product, SkyDrive. This permits many users to actually use application software from the 
server located anywhere in the cloud. If you choose to use Microsoft Office in this way, you would 
not purchase or install the actual application software on your own system; rather you would rent the 
services. A good example is the current offering from Apple. Sign up for a Creative Suite for 29.99/
month (Jan 2013), and you can use any application from any of their suites. You get every new update 
and upgrade, forever, for all apps in that suite, in addition to any newly developed apps in that suite for 
as long as you continue to pay the monthly fee. This keeps you up to date always.
This brings many new options and security issues. We are all wondering about some of the 
questions listed: Is it safe? It is supposedly safer than receiving constant updates to your computer, 
which can contain threats. All of that updating is done in the cloud, along with saving our files there.
What would be the point of using it, and how would I use it? You could use it for a backup 
for your non-protected documents or links. Do not save passwords, account information, or 
monetary statements there. Save working documents, ideas, and projects. You will be able to 
access your files from any location that has Internet access. If you also have cloud computing, 
which includes your application software, you will be able to edit anything anywhere!
