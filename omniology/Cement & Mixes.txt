Cement, concrete and mortar  
cement - lime - sand - aggregate. ballest - mortar - concrete
Below are details of concrete and mortar for different applications, how to estimate quantities 
and what these quantities mean. The various mixes are quoted as volume ratios, however the 
individual components are normally sold by weight, so a little calculation work is required.  
Cement in concrete and mortar creates its strength by chemical reaction, it is not like 
wallpaper glue which 'drys out', it 'goes off'. In fact, if the concrete or mortar should 'dry out' 
before the chemical reaction is substantially complete, it will fail. Likewise if it is subjected to a 
frost, it can also fail.  
Concrete/mortar will take months to reach it's full strength however after about 24 hours it 
should be fairly hard and after 4 or 5 days, the strength should be enough to stand upto 
normal punishment.  
The various components:  
Cement: For normal 'around the house' types jobs, Ordinary (or Portland) cement is 
required. This is normally available in 50kg bags, although smaller 25kg bags are increasingly 
becoming available to take account of the UK manual handling regulations. Try not to buy 
more cement than you need as it cannot be stored for very long. Some special cements are 
available (i.e. quick drying) which may be required for special situation.  
Lime: Lime is sometimes used in cement and reduces the amount of water drawn into the 
bricks, thus preventing the cement from drying out too quick and shrinking. The main types of 
lime are:  
• 
hydraulic - which sets by combining with water.  
• 
Non-hydraulic - this hardens by drying out.  
• 
Semi-hydraulic - which is a half-and-half, it mainly needs to dry out but has some 
hydraulic properties.  
Each type is available as either hydrated lime and quicklime - hydrated is more convenient to 
use as it has been processed ready for use. Hydrated hydraulic lime must be used straight 
from the bag. Hydrated semi- or non-hydraulic are better to use after soaking in water for 24 
hours - stir it into water and leave it overnight - the lime sinks to the bottom and excess water 
can then be poured off. Mix the lime with the sand before adding the cement.  
Sand: Two types of sand are available but are not interchangeable in all applications, 
whichever type is being used, always pass it though a sieve before use to remove any small 
stones etc.  
Soft sand (or Builders sand): a smooth sand, non-gritty, loamy and with cohesive 
properties, can be used for:  
• 
Bricklaying mortar  
• 
For bedding paving slabs  
• 
For rendering walls  
 
Sharp sand: this has a gritty feel and is similar to that used to condition soils and 
potting composts, can be used for:  

• 
Concrete  
• 
For rendering floors and walls  
Aggregate (also referred to as ballast): is used for concrete and consists of various sized 
particles from fine grains of sand to small stones. Aggregate is normally graded by size of the 
largest stones; 10mm Aggregate will have been sieved though a 10mm mesh to remove all 
larger stones.

Volume/weight conversion 
Cement 
1 cubic yard 
= 21.6cwt 
 
1 cubic metre 
= 1.4 tonne 
Lime 
1 cubic yard 
= 10.8cwt 
 
1 cubic metre 
= 0.7 tonne 
Sand 
1 cubic yard 
= 25 cwt 
 
1 cubic metre 
= 1.7 tonne 
  
Aggregate(ballast) 
The weight of Aggregate depends upon the proportion of solid stone and can vary between 
20 to 27 cwt per cubic yard. For practical purposes, the sand volume/weight conversions can 
be used.  
Storage 
Cement and lime - keep undercover and dry. Cement will tend to absorb water and turn hard 
if left for any long periods in high humidity.  
Sand and Ballast - small quanties can be stored in heavy duty plastic bags. Larger quantities 
should, ideally, be stored on a solid base. If it has to be stored on earth, place a lining of 
some sort on the earth before the sand/ballast is deposited - this will prevent the sand being 
absorbed into the earth and the earth into the sand. Try to keep the pile covered when not 

being used, this will ensure that local pets will not contaminate the top side as well as 
preventing any rain from washing some of it away - but do not let the pile get too dry as this 
may cause problems when it is being used.  
 
Stucco and Rendering mixes 
The terms 'Render' and 'Stucco' are almost interchangeable; Render generally being UK 
terminology and Stucco, American. However, the mixes below are specific as they are slightly 
different, Stucco generally having less sand.  
Various stucco mixes:  
  
hydrated 
lime 
sand 
cement 
hair or 
fibre

Note: Portland cement is not included in this mix; however, its use will increase the 
workability of the mix and decrease the setting time, the amount of Portland cement added 
should not exceed 1/3rd part .

The same basic mix was used for all layers, but the final layer should contain more lime 
than the underlayers.
