Preface
This book covers a range of thermal hydraulic topics related, but not limited, to nuclear re‐
actors. The purpose is to present research from around the globe that serves to advance our
knowledge of nuclear reactor thermal hydraulics and related areas. The focus is on comput‐
er code developments and applications to predict fluid flow and heat transfer, with an em‐
phasis on computational fluid dynamic (CFD) methods. This book is divided into two
sections. The first section consists of three chapters concerning computational codes and
methods applied to nuclear reactor safety. The second section consists of four chapters cov‐
ering general thermal hydraulic applications.
The overarching theme of the first section of this book is thermal hydraulic models and co‐
des to address safety behaviour of nuclear power plants. Accurate predictions of heat trans‐
fer and fluid flow are required to ensure effective heat removal under all conditions. The
section begins with a chapter discussing the theoretical development of thermal-hydraulic
approaches to coolant channel analysis. These traditional methods are widely used in sys‐
tem codes to evaluate nuclear power plant performance and safety. The second chapter ex‐
amines several fully unsteady computational models in the framework of large eddy
simulations implemented for a thermal hydraulic transport problem relevant to the design
of nuclear power plant piping systems. A comparison of experimental data from a classic
benchmark problem with the numerical results from three simulation codes is given. The
third chapter addresses the issue of properly modeling thermal mixing in Light Water Nu‐
clear Reactors. A CFD approach is advocated, which allows the flow structures to develop
and properly capture the mixing properties of turbulence.
The second section of this book includes chapters focusing on the application of CFD to
crosscutting thermal hydraulic phenomena. In line with best practices for CFD, the simula‐
tions are supported by relevant experimental data. The section begins with a chapter de‐
scribing a thermal hydraulic design and analysis methodology for a nuclear thermal
propulsion development effort. Modern computational fluid dynamics and heat transfer
methods are used to predict thermal, fluid, and hydrogen environments of a hypothetical
solid-core, nuclear thermal engine designed in the 1960s. The second chapter in this section
investigates the applicability of several CFD approaches to modeling mixing and agitation
in a stirred tank reactor. The results are compared with experimentally-obtained velocity
and turbulence parameters to determine the most appropriate methodology. The third chap‐
ter in this section presents the results of CFD simulations used to study the hydrodynamics
and heat transfer processes in a two-dimensional gas fluidized bed. The final chapter uses
CFD to predict the thermal hydraulics surrounding the design of a spallation target system
for an Accelerator Driven System.

Our ability to simulate larger problems with greater fidelity has vastly expanded over the
past decade. The collection of material presented in this book is but a small contribution to
the important topic of thermal hydraulics. The contents of this book will interest researchers,
scientists, engineers and graduate students.

1. Introduction
The development of LWR Nuclear Power Plants (NPP) and the question after their safety
behaviour have enhanced the need for adequate efficient theoretical descriptions of these
plants. Thus thermal-hydraulic models and, based on them, effective computer codes played
already very early an important role within the field of NPP safety research. Their objective is
to describe both the steady state and transient behaviour of characteristic key parameters of a
single- or two-phase fluid flowing along corresponding loops of such a plant and thus also
along any type of heated or non-heated coolant channels being a part of these loops in an
adequate way.
Due to the presence of discontinuities in the first principle of mass conservation of a two-phase
flow model, caused at the transition from single- to two-phase flow and vice versa, it turned
out that the direct solution of the basic conservation equations for mixture fluid along such a
coolant channel gets very complicated. Obviously many discussions have and will continue
to take place among experts as to which type of theoretical approach should be chosen for the
correct description of thermal-hydraulic two-phase problems when looking at the wide range
of applications. What is thus the most appropriate way to deal with such a special thermal-
hydraulic problem?
With the introduction of a ‘Separate-Phase Model Concept’ already very early an efficient way
has been found how to circumvent these upcoming difficulties. Thereby a solution method
has been proposed with the intention to separate the two-phases of such a mixture-flow in
parts of the basic equations or even completely from each other. This yields a system of 4-, 5-
or sometimes even 6-equations by splitting each of the conservation equations into two so-

called ‘field equations’. Hence, compared to the four independent parameters characterising
the mixture fluid, the separate-phase systems demand a much higher number of additional
variables and special assumptions. This has the additional consequence that a number of
speculative relations had to be incorporated into the theoretical description of such a module
and an enormous amount of CPU-time has to be expended for the solution of the resulting sets
of differential and analytical equations in a computer code. It is also clear that, based on such
assumptions, the interfacial relations both between the (heated or cooled) wall but also
between each of the two phases are completely rearranged. This raises the difficult question
of how to describe in a realistic way the direct heat input into and between the phases and the
movement resp. the friction of the phases between them. In such an approach this problem is
solved by introducing corresponding exchange (=closure) terms between the equations based
on special transfer (= closure) laws. Since they can, however, not be based on fundamental laws
or at least on experimental measurements this approach requires a significant effort to find a
correct formulation of the exchange terms between the phases. It must therefore be recognised
that the quality of these basic equations (and especially their boundary conditions) will be
intimately related to the (rather artificial and possibly speculative) assumptions adopted if
comparing them with the original conservation laws of the 3-equation system and their
constitutive equations as well. The problem of a correct description of the interfacial reaction
between the phases and the wall remains. Hence, very often no consistency between different
separate-phase models due to their underlying assumptions can be stated. Another problem
arises from the fact that special methods have to be foreseen to describe the moving boiling
boundary or mixture level (or at least to estimate their ‘condensed’ levels) in such a mixture
fluid (see, for example, the ‘Level Tracking’ method in TRAC). Additionally, these methods
show often deficiencies in describing extreme situations such as the treatment of single- and
two-phase flow at the ceasing of natural circulation, the power situations if decreasing to zero
etc. The codes are sometimes very inflexible, especially if they have to provide to a very
complex physical system also elements which belong not to the usual class of ‘thermal-
hydraulic coolant channels’. These can, for example, be nuclear kinetic considerations, heat
transfer out of a fuel rod or through a tube wall, pressure build-up within a compartment, time
delay during the movement of an enthalpy front along a downcomer, natural circulation along
a closed loop, parallel channels, inner loops etc.
However, despite of these difficulties the ‘Separate-Phase Models’ have become increasingly
fashionable and dominant in the last decades of thermal-hydraulics as demonstrated by the
widely-used codes TRAC (Lilles et al.,1988, US-NRC, 2001a), CATHENA (Hanna, 1998),
RELAP (US-NRC,2001b, Shultz,2003), CATHARE (Bestion,1990), ATHLET (Austregesilo et al.,
2003, Lerchl et al., 2009).
Within the scope of reactor safety research very early activities at the Gesellschaft für Anlagen-
und Reaktorsicherheit (GRS) at Garching/Munich have been started too, developing thermal-
hydraulic models and digital codes which could have the potential to describe in a detailed
way the overall transient and accidental behaviour of fluids flowing along a reactor core but
also the main components of different Nuclear Power Plant (NPP) types. For one of these
components, namely the natural circulation U-tube steam generator together with its feedwa‐

ter and main steam system, an own theoretical model has been derived. The resulting digital
code UTSG could be used both in a stand-alone way but also as part of more comprehensive
transient codes, such as the thermal-hydraulic GRS system code ATHLET. Together with a
high level simulation language GCSM (General Control Simulation Module) it could be taken
care of a manifold of balance-of-plant (BOP) actions too. Based on the experience of many years
of application both at the GRS and a number of other institutes in different countries but also
due to the rising demands coming from the safety-related research studies this UTSG theory
and code has been continuously extended, yielding finally a very satisfactory and mature code
version UTSG-2.
During the research work for the development of an enhanced version of the code UTSG-2 it
arose finally the idea to establish an own basic element which is able to simulate the thermal-
hydraulic mixture-fluid situation within any type of cooled or heated channel in an as general
as possible way. It should have the aim to be applicable for any modular construction of
complex thermal-hydraulic assemblies of pipes and junctions. Thereby, in contrast to the above
mentioned class of ‘separate-phase’ modular codes, instead of separating the phases of a
mixture fluid within the entire coolant channel an alternative theoretical approach has been
proposed, differing both in its form of application but also in its theoretical background. To
circumvent the above mentioned difficulties due to discontinuities resulting from the spatial
discretization of a coolant channel, resulting eventually in nodes where a transition from
single- to two-phase flow and vice versa can take place, a special and unique concept has been
proposed. Thereby it has been assumed that each coolant channel can be seen as a (basic)
channel (BC) which can, according to their different flow regimes, be subdivided into a number
of sub-channels (SC-s). It is clear that each of these SC-s can consist of only two types of flow
regimes. A SC with just a single-phase fluid, containing exclusively either sub-cooled water,
superheated steam or supercritical fluid, or a SC with a two-phase mixture. The theoretical
considerations of this ‘Separate-Region Approach’ can then (within the class of mixture-fluid
models) be restricted to only these two regimes. Hence, for each SC type, the ‘classical’ 3
conservation equations for mass, energy and momentum can be treated in a direct way. In case
of a sub-channel with mixture flow these basic equations had to be supported by a drift flux
correlation (which can take care also of stagnant or counter-current flow situations), yielding
an additional relation for the appearing fourth variable, namely the steam mass flow.
The main problem of the application of such an approach lies in the fact that now also
varying SC entrance and outlet boundaries (marking the time-varying phase boundary
positions) have to be considered with the additional difficulty that along a channel such a
SC can even disappear or be created anew. This means that after an appropriate nodaliza‐
tion of such a BC (and thus also it’s SC-s) a 'modified finite volume method' (among others
based on the Leibniz Integration Rule) had to be derived for the spatial discretization of the
fundamental partial differential equations (PDE-s) which represent the basic conservation
equations of thermal-hydraulics for each SC. Furthermore, to link within this procedure the
resulting mean nodal with their nodal boundary function values an adequate quadratic
polygon approximation method (PAX) had to be established. The procedure should yield

http://dx.doi.org/10.5772/53372
5

finally for each SC type (and thus also the complete BC) a set of non-linear ordinary
differential equations of 1st order (ODE-s).
It has to be noted that besides the suggestion to separate a (basic) channel into regions of
different flow types this special PAX method represents, together with the very thoroughly
tested packages for drift flux and single- and two-phase friction factors, the central part of the
here presented ‘Separate - Region Approach’. An adequate way to solve this essential problem
could be found and a corresponding procedure established. As a result of these theoretical
considerations an universally applicable 1D thermal-hydraulic drift-flux based separate-
region coolant channel model and module CCM could be established. This module allows to
calculate automatically the steady state and transient behaviour of the main characteristic
parameters of a single- and two-phase fluid flowing within the entire coolant channel. It
represents thus a valuable tool for the establishment of complex thermal-hydraulic computer
codes. Even in the case of complicated single- and mixture fluid systems consisting of a number
of different types of (basic) coolant channels an overall set of equations by determining
automatically the nodal non-linear differential and corresponding constitutive equations
needed for each of these sub- and thus basic channels can be presented. This direct method
can thus be seen as a real counterpart to the currently preferred and dominant ‘separate-phase
models’.
To check the performance and validity of the code package CCM and to verify it the digital
code UTSG-2 has been extended to a new and advanced version, called UTSG-3. It has been
based, similarly as in the previous code UTSG-2, on the same U-tube, main steam and
downcomer (with feedwater injection) system layout, but now, among other essential im‐
provements, the three characteristic channel elements of the code UTSG-2 (i.e. the primary and
secondary side of the heat exchange region and the riser region) have been replaced by
adequate CCM modules.
It is obvious that such a theoretical ‘separate-region’ approach can disclose a new way in
describing thermal-hydraulic problems. The resulting ‘mixture-fluid’ technique can be
regarded as a very appropriate way to circumvent the uncertainties apparent from the
separation of the phases in a mixture flow. The starting equations are the direct consequence
of the original fundamental physical laws for the conservation of mass, energy and momen‐
tum, supported by well-tested heat transfer and single- and two-phase friction correlation
packages (and thus avoiding also the sometimes very speculative derivation of the ‘closure’
terms). In a very comprehensive study by (Hoeld, 2004b) a variety of arguments for the here
presented type of approach is given, some of which will be discussed in the conclusions of
chapter 6.
The very successful application of the code combination UTSG-3/CCM demonstrates the
ability to find an exact and direct solution for the basic equations of a 'non-homogeneous drift-
flux based thermal-hydraulic mixture-fluid coolant channel model’. The theoretical back‐
ground of CCM will be described in very detail in the following chapters.

For the establishment of the corresponding (digital) module CCM, based on this theoretical
model very specific methods had to be achieved. Thereby the following points had to be taken
into account:
• The code has to be easily applicable, demanding only a limited amount of directly available
input data. It should make it possible to simulate the thermal-hydraulic mixture-fluid
situation along any cooled or heated channel in an as general as possible way and thus
describe any modular construction of complex thermal-hydraulic assemblies of pipes and
junctions. Such an universally applicable tool can then be taken for calculating the steady
state and transient behaviour of all the characteristic parameters of each of the appearing
coolant channels and thus be a valuable element for the construction of complex computer
codes. It should yield as output all the necessary time-derivatives and constitutive param‐
eters of the coolant channels required for the establishment of an overall thermal-hydraulic
code.
• It was the intention of CCM that it should act as a complete system in its own right, requiring
only BC (and not SC) related, and thus easily available input parameters (geometry data,
initial and boundary conditions, parameters resulting from the integration etc.). The
partitioning of BC-s into SC-s is done at the beginning of each recursion or time-step
automatically within CCM, so no special actions are required of the user.
• The quality of such a model is very much dependent on the method by which the problem
of the varying SC entrance and outlet boundaries can be solved. Especially if they cross BC
node boundaries during their movement along a channel. For this purpose a special
‘modified finite element-method’ has been developed which takes advantage of the
‘Leibniz’ rule for integration (see eq.(15)).
• For the support of the nodalized differential equations along different SC-s a ‘quadratic
polygon approximation’ procedure (PAX) was constructed in order to interrelate the mean
nodal with the nodal boundary functions. Additionally, due to the possibility of varying SC
entrance and outlet boundaries, nodal entrance gradients are required too (See section 3.3).
• Several correlation packages such as, for example, packages for the thermodynamic
properties of water and steam, heat transfer coefficients, drift flux correlations and single-
and two-phase friction coefficients had to be developed and implemented (See sections 2.2.1
to 2.2.4).
• Knowing the characteristic parameters at all SC nodes (within a BC) then the single- and
two-phase parameters at all node boundaries of the entire BC can be determined. And also
the corresponding time-derivatives of the characteristic averaged parameters of coolant
temperatures resp. void fraction over these nodes. This yields a final set of ODE-s and
constitutive equations.
• In order to be able to describe also thermodynamic non-equilibrium situations it can be
assumed that each phase is represented by an own with each other interacting BC. For these
purpose in the model the possibility of a variable cross flow area along the entire channel
had to be considered as well.

• Within the CCM procedure two further aspects play an important role. These are, however,
not essential for the development of mixture-fluid models but can help enormously to
enhance the computational speed and applicability of the resulting code when simulating
a complex net of coolant pipes:
• The solution of the energy and mass balance equations at each intermediate time step will
be performed independently from momentum balance considerations. Hence the heavy
CPU-time consuming solution of stiff equations can be avoided (Section 3.6).
• This decoupling allows then also the introduction of an ‘open’ and ‘closed channel’ concept
(see section 3.11). Such a special method can be very helpful in describing complex physical
systems with eventually inner loops. As an example the simulation of a 3D compartment
by parallel channels can be named (Jewer et al., 2005).
The application of a direct mixture-fluid technique follows a long tradition of research efforts.
Ishii (1990), a pioneer of two-fluid modelling, states with respect to the application of effective
drift-flux correlation packages in thermal-hydraulic models: ‘In view of the limited data base
presently available and difficulties associated with detailed measurements in two-phase flow,
an advanced mixture-fluid model is probably the most reliable and accurate tool for standard
two-phase flow problems’. There is no new knowledge available to indicate that this view is
invalid.
Generally, the mixture-fluid approach is in line with (Fabic, 1996) who names three strong
points arguing in favour of this type of drift-flux based mixture-fluid models:
• They are supported by a wealth of test data,
• they do not require unknown or untested closure relations concerning mass, energy and
momentum exchange between phases (thus influencing the reliability of the codes),
• they are much simpler to apply,
and, it can be added,
• discontinuities during phase changes can be avoided by deriving special solution proce‐
dures for the simulation of the movement of these phase boundaries,
• the possibility to circumvent a set of ‘stiff’ ODE-s saves an enormous amount of CPU time
which means that the other parts of the code can be treated in much more detail.
A documentation of the theoretical background of CCM will be given in very condensed form
in the different chapters of this article. For the establishment of the corresponding (digital)
module CCM, based on this theoretical model, very specific methods had to be achieved.
The here presented article is an advanced and very condensed version of a paper being already
published in a first Open Access Book of this INTECH series (Hoeld, 2011a). It is updated to
the newest status in this field of research. An example for an application of this module within
the UTSG-3 steam generator code is given in (Hoeld 2011b).

2. Thermal-hydraulic drift-flux based mixture fluid approach
2.1. Thermal-hydraulic conservation equations
Thermal-hydraulic single-phase or mixture-fluid models for coolant channels or, as presented
here, for each of the sub-channels are generally based on a number of fundamental physical
laws, i.e., they obey genuine conservation equations for mass, energy and momentum. And
they are supported by adequate constitutive equations (packages for thermo-dynamic and
transport properties of water and steam, for heat transfer coefficients, for drift flux, for single-
and two-phase friction coefficients etc.).
In view of possible applications as an element in complex thermal-hydraulic ensembles outside
of CCM eventually a fourth and fifth conservation law has to be considered too. The fourth
law, namely the volume balance, allows then to calculate the transient behaviour of the overall
absolute system pressure. Together with the local pressure differences then the absolute
pressure profile along the BC can be determined. The fifth physical law is based on the (trivial)
fact that the sum of all pressure decrease terms along a closed loop must be zero. This is the
basis for the treatment of the thermal-hydraulics of a channel according to a ‘closed channel
concept’ (See section 3.11). It refers to one of the channels within the closed loop where the BC
entrance and outlet pressure terms have to be assumed to be fixed. Due to this concept then
the necessary entrance mass flow term has be determined in order to fulfil the demand from
momentum balance.

2.2. Constitutive equations
For the exact description of the steady state and the transient behaviour of single- or two-phase
fluids a number of mostly empirical constitutive correlations are, besides the above mentioned
conservation equations, demanded. To bring a structure into the manifold of existing correla‐

tions established by various authors, to find the best fitting correlations for the different fields
of application and to get a smooth transfer from one to another of them special and effective
correlation packages had to be developed. Their validities can be and has been tested out-of-
pile by means of adequate driver codes. Obviously, my means of this method improved
correlations can easily be incorporated into the existing theory.
A short characterization of the main packages being applied within CCM is given below. For
more details see (Hoeld, 2011a).
2.2.1. Thermodynamic and transport properties of water and steam
The different thermodynamic properties for water and steam (together with their derivatives
with respect to P and T, but also P and h) demanded by the conservation and constitutive
equations have to be determined by applying adequate water/steam tables. This is, for light-
water systems, realized in the code package MPP (Hoeld, 1996 and 2011a).
Then the time-derivatives of these thermodynamic properties which respect to their inde‐
pendent local parameters (for example of an enthalpy term h) can be represented as

Additionally, corresponding thermodynamic transport properties such as ‘dynamic viscosity’
and ‘thermal heat conductivity’ (and thus the ‘Prantl number’) are asked from some constit‐
utive equations too as this can be stated, for example, for the code packages MPPWS and
MPPETA (Hoeld, 1996). All of them have been derived on the basis of tables given by (Schmidt
and Grigull,1982) and (Haar et al., 1988).
Obviously, the CCM method is also applicable for other coolant systems (heavy water, gas) if
adequate thermodynamic tables for this type of fluids are available.
2.2.2. Single and two-phase friction factors
The friction factor fR needed in eq.(6) can in case of single-phase flow be set, as proposed by
(Moody, 1994), equal to the Darcy-Weisbach single-phase friction factor.
The corresponding coefficient for two-phase flow has to be extended by means of a two-phase
multiplier Φ 2PF
2
 as recommended by (Martinelli-Nelson, 1948).
For more details see again (Hoeld, 2011a).
2.2.3. Drift flux correlation
Usually, the three conservation equations (1), (2) and (3) demand for single-phase flow the
three parameters G, P and T as independent variables. In case of two-phase flow, they are,
however, dependent on four of them, namely G, P, α and GS. This means, the set has to be
completed by an additional relation. This can be achieved by any two-phase correlation, acting

thereby as a ‘bridge’ between GS and α. For example, by a slip correlation. However, to take
care of stagnant or counter-current flow situations too an effective drift-flux correlation seemed
here to be more appropriate. For this purpose an own package has been established, named
MDS (Hoeld, 2001 and 2002a). Due to the different requirements in the application of CCM it
turned out that it has a number of advantages if choosing the ‘flooding-based full-range’
Sonnenburg correlation (Sonnenburg, 1989) as basis for MDS. This correlation combines the
common drift-flux procedure being formulated by (Zuber-Findlay, 1965) and expanded by
(Ishii-Mishima, 1980) and (Ishii, 1990) etc. with the modern envelope theory. The correlation
in the final package MDS had, however, to be rearranged in such a way that also the special
cases of α → 0 or α → 1 are included and that, besides their absolute values and corresponding
slopes, also the gradients of the approximation function can be made available for CCM.
Additionally, an inverse form had to be installed (needed, for example, for the steady state
conditions) and, eventually, also considerations with respect to possible entrainment effects
be taken care.
For the case of a vertical channel this correlation can be represented as

with (in case of a heated or non-heated channel) C0 → 0 or 1 if α → 0 resp. C0 → 1 if α → 1
and corresponding drift velocity terms vD according to eq.(8.)
The resulting package MDS yields in combination with an adequate correlation for the phase
distribution parameter C0 relations for the limit velocities vSLIM and vWLIM and thus (independ‐
ently of the total mass flow G which is important for the theory below) relations for the drift
velocity vD with respect to the void fraction α. All of them are dependent on the given 'system
pressure P', the 'hydraulic diameter dHY' (with respect to the wetted surface ATW and its
inclination angle ΦZG), on specifications about the geometry type (LGTYPE) and, for low void
fractions, the information whether the channel is heated or not.
The drift flux theory can thus be expressed in dependence of a (now already on G dependent)
steam mass flow (or flux) term

Knowing now the fourth variable then, by starting from their definition equations, relations
for all the other characteristic two-phase parameters can be established. Such two-phase
parameters could be the ‘phase distribution parameter C0’, the ‘water and steam mass flows
GW and GS’, ‘drift, water, steam and relative velocities vD, vW,vS and vR’ (with special values
for vS if α -> 0 and vW if α -> 1) and eventually the ‘steam quality X’. Their interrelations are
shown, for example, in the tables of (Hoeld, 2001 and 2002a). Especially the determination of
the steam mass flow gradient

(12)
will play (as shown, for example, in eq.(52)) an important part, if looking to the special situation
that the entrance or outlet position of a SC is crossing a BC node boundary (α → 0 or → 1).
This possibility makes the drift-flux package MDS to an indispensable part in the nodalization
procedure of the mixture-fluid mass and energy balance.
At a steady state situation as a result of the solution of the basic (algebraic) set of equations the
steam mass flow term GS acts as an independent variable (and not the void fraction α). The
same is the case after an injection of a two-phase mixture coming from a ‘porous’ channel or
an abrupt change in steam mass flux GFS, as this can take place after a change in total mass
flow or in the cross flow area at the entrance of a following BC. Then the total and the steam
mass flow terms G and GS have to be taken as the basis for further two-phase considerations.
The void fraction α and other two-phase parameters (vD, C0) can now be determined from an
inverse (INV) form of this drift-flux correlation (with GS now as input).
2.2.4. Heat transfer coefficients
The nodal BC heat power terms QBMk into the coolant are needed (as explained in section 3.5)
as boundary condition for the energy balance equation (2). If they are not directly available (as
this is the case for electrically heated loops) they have to be determined by solving an adequate
Fourier heat conduction equation, demanding as boundary condition
qF=αTW(TTW-T) =
qLTW
UTW = A
UTW qD
(13)
Such a procedure is, for example, presented in (Hoeld, 2002b, 2011) for the case of heat
conduction through a U-tube wall (See also section 3.5).
The Coolant Channel Module CCM — A Basic Element for the Construction of Thermal-Hydraulic Models and Codes
http://dx.doi.org/10.5772/53372
13

For this purpose adequate heat transfer coefficients are demanded. This means a method had
to be found for getting these coefficients αTW along a coolant channel at different flow regimes.
In connection with the development of the UTSG code (and thus also of CCM) an own very
comprehensive heat transfer coefficient package, called HETRAC (Hoeld 1988a), has been
established.
This classic method is different to the ‘separate-phase’ models where it has to be taken into
account that the heat is transferred both directly from the wall to each of the two possible
phases but also exchanged between them. There arises then the question how the correspond‐
ing heat transfer coefficients for each phase should look like.
3. Coolant channel module CCM
3.1. Channel geometry and finite-difference nodalization
The theoretical considerations take advantage of the fact that, as sketched in fig.1, a ‘basic’
coolant channel (BC) can, as already pointed-out, according to their flow regimes (character‐
ized by the logical LFTYPE = 0, 1, 2 or 3) be subdivided into a number (NSCT) of sub-channels (SC-
s), each distinguished by their characteristic key numbers (NSC). Obviously, it has to be taken
into account that their entrance and outlet SC-s can now have variable entrance and/or outlet
positions.
The entire BC, with its total length zBT = zBA-zBE, can then, for discretization purposes, be also
subdivided into a number of (not necessarily equidistant) NBT nodes. Their nodal positions are
zBE, zBk (with k=1,NBT), the elevation heights zELBE, zELk, the nodal length ΔzBk=zBk-zBk-1, the nodal
elevations ΔzELBk=zELBk-zELBk-1, with eventually also locally varying cross flow and average areas
ABk and ABMk=0.5(ABk+ABk-1) and their slopes A Bk
z  = (ABk-ABk-1)/ΔzBk, a hydraulic diameter
dHYBk and corresponding nodal volumes VBMk = ΔzBkABMk. All of them can be assumed to be
known from input.
As a consequence, each of the sub-channels (SC-s) is then subdivided too, now into a number
of NCT SC nodes with geometry data being identical to the corresponding BC values, except,
of course, at their entrance and outlet positions. The SC entrance position zCE and their function
fCE are either identical with the BC entrance values zBE and fBE or equal to the outlet values of
the SC before. The SC outlet position (zCA) is either limited by the BC outlet (zBA) or character‐
ized by the fact that the corresponding outlet function has reached an upper or lower limit
(fLIMCA). This the term represents either a function at the boiling boundary, a mixture level or
the start position of a supercritical flow. Such a function follows from the given BC limit values
and will, in the case of single-phase flow, be equal to the saturation temperature TSATCA or
saturation enthalpies (h/ or h// if LFTYPE=1 or 2). In the case of two-phase flow (LFTYPE=0) it has to
be equal to a void fraction of α = 1 or = 0. The moving SC inlet and outlet positions zCE and
zCA can (together with their corresponding BC nodes NBCE and NBCA = NBCE+NCT) be determined
according to the conditions (zBNk-1 ≤ zCE < zBNk at k = NBCE) and (zBNk-1 ≤ zCA < zBNk at k = NBCA).
Then also the total number of SC nodes (NCT=NBCA-NBCE) is given, the connection between n

and k (n=k-NBCE with n=1, NCT), the corresponding positions (zNn, zELCE, zELNn), their lengths
(ΔzNn=zNn-zNn-1), elevations (ΔzELNn=zELNn-zELNn-1) and volumes (VMn=zNnAMn) and nodal boun‐
dary and mean nodal flow areas (ANn, AMn).

performed by means of a ’modified finite element method’. This means that if a partial
differential equation (PDE) of 1-st order having the general form with respect to a general

is integrated over the length of a SC node three types of discretization elements can be expected:
• Integrating a function f(z,t) over a SC node n yields the nodal mean function values fMn,
• integrating over the gradient of a function f(z,t) yields a difference of functions values (fNn
– fNn-1) at their node boundaries
and, finally,
• integrating over a time-derivative of a function (by applying the 'Leibniz' rule) yields

d
dt zNn(t)
- [fMn(t)-fNn-1(t)
d
dt zNn-1(t)
(n=1, NCT)
(15)
This last rule plays for the here presented ‘separate-region mixture-fluid approach’ an
outstanding part. It allows (together with PAX) to determine in a direct way the time-
derivatives of parameters which represent either a boiling boundary, mixture or a supercritical
level. This procedure differs considerably from some of the 'separate-phase methods' where,
as already pointed out, very often only the collapsed levels of a mixture fluid can be calculated.
3.3. Quadratic polygon approximation procedure PAX
According to the above described three different types of possible discretization elements the
solution of the set of algebraic equations will in the steady state case (as shown later-on) yield
function values (fNn) at the node boundaries (zNn), the also needed mean nodal functions (fMn)
will then have to be determined on the basis of fNn. On the other hand, the solution of the set
of ordinary differential equations will in the transient case now yield the mean nodal functions
fMn as a result, the also needed nodal boundary values fNn will have to be estimated on the basis
of fMn.
It is thus obvious that appropriate methods had to be developed which can help to establish
relations between such mean nodal (fMn) and node boundary (fNn) function values. Different
to the ‘separate-phase’ models where mostly a method is applied (called ‘upwind or donor
cell differencing scheme’) with the mean parameter values to be shifted (in flow direction) to
the node boundaries in CCM a more detailed mixture-fluid approach is asked. This is also
demanded because, as to be seen later-on from the relations of the sections 3.7 to 3.9, not only
absolute nodal SC boundary or mean nodal function values are required but as well also their
nodal slopes f Nn

 together with their gradients f Nn

Hence, for this purpose a special ‘quadratic polygon approximation’ procedure, named 'PAX',
had to be developed. It plays (together with the Leibniz rule presented above) an outstanding
part in the development of the here presented ‘mixture-fluid model’ and helps, in particular,
to solve the difficult task of how to take care of varying SC boundaries (which can eventually
cross BC node boundaries) in an appropriate and exact way.
3.3.1. Establishment of an effective and adequate approximation function
The PAX procedure is based on the assumption that the solution function f(z) of a PDE (for
example temperature or void fraction) is split into a number of NCT nodal SC functions fn(z,t).
Each of them has then to be approximated by a specially constructed quadratic polygon which
have to fulfil the following requirements:
• The node entrance functions (fNn-1) must be either equal to the SC entrance function (fNn-1 =
fCE) (if n = 1) or to the outlet function of the node before (if n > 1). This is obviously not
demanded for gradients of the nodal entrance functions (except for the last node at n = NCT).
• The mean function values fMn over all SC nodes have to be preserved (otherwise the balance
equations could be hurt).
• With the objective to guarantee stable behaviour of the approximated functions (for example
by excluding 'saw tooth-like behaviour’) it will, in an additional assumption, be demanded
that the outlet gradients of the first NCT -1 nodes should be set equal to the slopes between
their neighbour mean function values. The entrance gradient of the last node (n= NCT) should
be either equal to the outlet gradient of the node before (if n = NCT > 1) or equal to a given
SC input gradient (for the special case n = NCT =1). Thus

(19)
This means, the corresponding approximation function reaches not only over the node n. Its
next higher one (n+1) has to be included into the considerations too (except, of course, for the
last node). This assumption makes the PAX procedure very effective (and stable). It is a
conclusive onset in this method since it helps to smooth the curve, guarantees that the gradients
at the upper or lower SC boundary do not show abrupt changes if these boundaries cross a BC

17

node boundary and has the effect that perturbations at channel entrance do not directly affect
corresponding parameters of the upper BC nodes.
For the special case of a SC having shrunk to a single node (n=NCT=1) the quadratic approxi‐
mation demands as an additional input to PAX (instead of the now not available term fMn) the
gradient f CEI
z
 at SC entrance. It represents thereby the gradient of either the coolant tempera‐
ture T CEI
z
 or void fraction α CEI
z
 (in case of single- or two-phase flow entrance conditions). If
this parameter is not directly available it can, for example, be estimated by combining the mass
and energy balance equations at SC entrance in an adequate way (See Hoeld, 2005). This
procedure allows to take care not only of SC-s consisting of only one single node but also of
situations where during a transient either the first or last SC of a BC starts to disappear or to
be created anew (i.e. zCA → zBE or zCE → zBA), since now the nodal mean value fMn at n = NCT
(for both NCT = 1 or > 1) is no longer or not yet known.
3.3.2. Resulting nodal parameters due to PAX
It can be expected that in the steady state case after having solved the basic set of non-linear
algebraic equations (as presented later-on in the sections 3.7, 3.8 and 3.9) as input to PAX the
following parameters will be available:
• Geometry data such as the SC entrance (zCE) and node positions (zNn) (and thus also the SC
outlet boundary position zCA as explained in section 3.9) determining then in PAX the
number of SC nodes (NCT),
• the SC entrance function fN0 = fCE and (at least for the special case n=NCT=1) its gradient f
CEI
(z)
and finally
• the nodal boundary functions fNn (n=1,NCT) with fCA = fNn at n = NCT and fCA= fLIMCA if zCA < zBA.
Based on these inputs PAX yields then the nodal mean function values fMn (at n=1,NCT)
fMn =

functions which are needed as initial values for the transient case.
In the transient case it can be expected that after having integrated the set of non-linear ordinary
differential equations (ODE-s) (as to be shown again in the sections 3.7, 3.8 and 3.9) the SC
outlet position zCA (=zNn) and thus also the total number NCT of SC nodes will now be directly
Nuclear Reactor Thermal Hydraulics and Other Applications
18

available from the integration. Thereby, as input data needed for the use in the PAX procedure
it has now to be distinguished between two cases:
• if the now known SC outlet position is identical with the BC outlet (zCA=zBA) the mean nodal
function values fMn for all NCT nodes (n=1,NCT) should be provided as input
or
• if the SC outlet position moves still within the BC (zCA < zBA) the mean nodal function values
fMn of only NCT-1 nodes (n=1, NCT-1) are demanded. Additionally, the nodal function limit
values fLIMNn (usually saturation temperature values at single-phase flow resp. void fraction
values limited by 1 or 0 at mixture flow conditions) are asked. Then the missing mean nodal
function fMn of the last SC is not any longer needed, since this function can be determined
from eq.(20) in dependence of the known outlet function fNn = fCA = fLIMCA at zNn = zCA.
These nodal input function values can then be taken (together with its input parameter fCE and
the nodal positions zBE and zBn at n=1, NCT) as basic points for the PAX procedure, yielding,
after rearranging the definition equations of the approximation function in an adequate way,
all the other not directly known nodal function parameters of the SC.
Hence, it follows for the special situation of a SC being the last one within the BC (zCA = zBA)

The last mean nodal function fMn (at n=NCT) which is, for this case (zCA < zBA), not available from

Finally, from the eqs.(16), (17) and (19) the slopes and gradients can be determined.
The corresponding time-derivative of the last mean node function which is needed for the
determination of the SC boundary time-derivative (see section 3.9) follows (as long as zCA < zBA)

3.3.3. Code package PAX
Based on the above established set of equations a routine PAX had to be developed. Its objective
was to calculate automatically either the nodal mean or nodal boundary values (in case of an
either steady state or transient situation). The procedure should allow also determining the
gradients and slopes at SC entrance and outlet (and thus also outlet values characterizing the
entrance parameters of an eventually subsequent SC). Additionally, contributions needed for
the calculation of the time-derivatives of the boiling boundary or mixture level can be gained
(See later-on the eqs.(66) and (67)).

Before incorporating the subroutine into the overall coolant channel module the validity of the
presented PAX procedure has been thoroughly tested. By means of a special driver code
(PAXDRI) different characteristic and extreme cases have been calculated. The resulting curves
of such a characteristic example are plotted in fig.2. It represents the two approximation curves
of an artificially constructed void fraction distribution f(z) = α(z) along a SC with two-phase
flow both for the steady state but also transient situation. Both curves (on the basis of fMn and
fNn) should be (and are) identical.
3.4. Needed input parameters
3.4.1. Initial conditions
For the start of the transient calculations adequate steady state parameters have to be available
as initial conditions.
3.4.2. Boundary conditions
As boundary conditions for both the steady state and especially for transient calculations the
following input parameters are expected to be known. Thereby demanding only easily
available BC values (They will, within CCM, then be automatically translated into the
corresponding SC values):
• Power profile along the entire BC. This means that either the nodal heat flux terms qFBE and
qFBk (at BC entrance and each node k=1,NBT) or qFBE and the nodal power terms QBMk are
expected to be known, either directly from input or (as explained in section 2.2.4) by solving
the appropriate ‘Fourier heat conduction equation’. From the relation
QBMk=
1
2 ΔzBk(qLBk+qLBk-1) = 1
2 ΔzBk(UTWBkqFBk+UTWBk-1qFBk-1) = VBMkqBMk
with qLBE= UTWBEqFBEand qDBE=
UTWBE
ABE qFBE
(k=1,NBT)
(25)
then the other BC nodal terms (qFBk or QBMk, qLBk and qDBk) can be determined too. (Hoeld,
2002b, 2004a and 2011).
• For normalization purposes at the starting calculation (i.e., at the steady state situation) as
an additional parameter the total nominal (steady state) heat power QNOM,0 is asked.
• Channel entrance temperature TBEIN (or enthalpy hBEIN)
• System pressure PSYS and its time-derivative (dPSYS/dt), situated at a fixed position either
along the BC (entrance, outlet) or even outside of the ensemble. Due to the fast pressure
wave propagation each local pressure time-derivative can then be set equal to the change
in system pressure (as described in section 3.6).
• Total mass flow GBEIN at BC entrance together with pressure terms at BC entrance PBEIN and
outlet PBAIN. These three parameters are needed for steady state considerations (and partially

used for normalization purposes). In the transient case only two of them are demanded as
input. The third one will be determined automatically by the model. These allows then to
distinguish between the situation of an ‘open’ or ‘closed channel’ concept as this will be
explained in more detail in section 3.11.
• Steam mass flow GSBEIN at BC entrance (=0 or = GBEIN at single- or 0 < GSBEIN < GBEIN at two-
phase flow conditions). The corresponding entrance void fraction αBE will then be deter‐
mined automatically within the code by applying the inverse drift-flux correlation.
Eventually needed time-derivatives of such entrance functions can either be expected to be
known directly from input or be estimated from their absolute values.
By choosing adequate boundary conditions then also thermal-hydraulic conditions of other
situations can be simulated. For example that of several channel assembles (nuclear power
plants, test loops etc.) which can consist of a complex web of pipes and branches (represented
by different BC-s, all of them distinguished by their key numbers KEYBC). Even the case of an
ensemble consisting of inner loops (for example describing parallel channels) can be treated
in an adequate way according to the concept of a ‘closed’ channel (see section 3.11).
3.4.3. Solution vector
The characteristic steady state parameters are determined in a direct way, i.e. calculated by
solving the non-linear set of algebraic equations for SC-s (as being presented in the chapters
3.7, 3.8 and 3.9). Thereby, due to the nonlinearities in the set of the (steady state) constitutive
equations a recursive procedure in combination with and controlled by the main program has
to be applied until a certain convergence in the solution vector can be stated. The results are
then combined to BC parameters and transferred again back to the main (= calling) program.
For the transient case, as a result of the integration (performed within the calling program and
thus outside of CCM) the solution parameters of the set of ODE-s are transferred after each
intermediate time step to CCM. These are (as described in detail also in chapter 4) mainly the
mean nodal SC and thus BC coolant temperatures, mean nodal void fractions and the resulting
boiling or superheating boundaries. These last two parameters allow then to subdivide the BC
into SC-s yielding the corresponding constitutive parameters and the total and nodal length
(zNn and ΔzNn) of these SC-s and thus also their total number (NCT) of SC nodes. Finally, the
needed SC (and thus BC) time-derivatives can be determined within CCM (as described in the
sections 3.7, 3.8 and 3.9) and then transmitted again to the calling program where the integra‐
tion for the next time step can take place.
3.5. SC power profile
Knowing (as explained in section 3.4.2) the nodal BC power QBMk together with the linear power
qLBE at BC entrance the corresponding SC power profile can now be determined too.
Hence, since linear behaviour of the linear nodal power terms within the corresponding BC
nodes can be assumed it follows for the ‘linear SC power’ term

These last parameters are, since independent of ΔzNn, very useful for equations where it has
to be expected that ΔzNn -> 0 (as this can be seen later-on by the eqs.(32) and (49)).
The SC length zCA (and thus that of its last node ΔzCA) are (for the case zCA,0 < zBA) only known
in the transient case (as a result of the integration procedure). For steady state conditions the
term QMCA,0 follows from energy balance considerations (eqs.(40) and (59)). Then, in a reverse
manner, ΔzCA,,0 can be calculated (See eq.(65) in section 3.9).
3.6. Decoupling of mass and energy balance from momentum balance equations
Treating the conservation equations in a direct way produces due to elements with fast
pressure wave propagation (which are responsible for very small time constants) a set of ‘stiff’
ODE-s. This has the consequence that their solution turns out to be enormously CPU-time
consuming. Hence, to avoid this costly procedure CCM has been developed with the aim to
decouple the mass and energy from their momentum balance equations. This can be achieved
by determining the thermodynamic properties of water and steam in the energy and mass
balance equations on the basis of an estimated pressure profile P(z,t). Thereby the pressure
difference terms from a recursive (or a prior computational time step) will be added to an
eventually time-varying system pressure PSYS(t), known from boundary conditions. After
having solved the two conservation equations for mass and energy (now separately from and
not simultaneously with the momentum balance) the different nodal pressure gradient terms
The Coolant Channel Module CCM — A Basic Element for the Construction of Thermal-Hydraulic Models and Codes
http://dx.doi.org/10.5772/53372
23

can (by the then following momentum balance considerations) be determined according to the
eqs.(4), (5) and (6).
It can additionally be assumed that according to the very fast (acoustical) pressure wave
propagation along a coolant channel all the local pressure time-derivatives can be replaced by
a given external system pressure time-derivative, i.e.,

By applying the above explained ‘intelligent’ (since physically justified) simplification in CCM
the small, practically negligible, error in establishing the thermodynamic properties on the
basis of such an estimated pressure profile can be outweighed by the enormous benefit
substantiated by two facts:
• Avoidance of the very time-consuming solution of stiff equations,
• the calculation of the mass flow distribution into different channels resulting from pressure
balance considerations can, in a recursive way, be adapted already within each integration
time step, i.e. there is no need to solve the entire set of differential equations for this purpose
(See ‘closed channel’ concept in section 3.11).
3.7. Thermal-hydraulics of a SC with single-phase flow (LFTYPE > 0)
The spatial integration of the two PDE-s of the conservation eqs.(1) and (2) over a (single-phase)
SC node n yields (by taking into account the rules from section 3.2, the relations from the eqs.
(7) and (29), the possibility of a locally changing nodal cross flow area along the BC and the
fact that eventually VMn -> 0 ) for the transient case the relation

In the transient case the mean nodal coolant temperature value TMn is at the begin of each
(intermediate) time step known. This either, at the first time step, from steady state consider‐
ations (in combination with PAX) or as a result of the integration procedure. Hence, additional
parameters needed in the relations above can be determined too. From the PAX procedure it
follow also the SC nodal terms TNn, T Nn
(s)  and the slopes T Mn
(s)  resp., for the case that ΔzNn → 0,
their gradients. Finally, using the water/steam tables (Hoeld, 1996), also their nodal enthalpies
are fixed.
From the integration procedure then also the SC outlet position zCA is provided, allowing to
determine the total number of SC nodes (NCT) too. The situation that zCA = zBT means the SC
nodal boundary temperature values have, within the entire BC, not yet reached their limit
values (TLIMNn=TSATNn). Thus NCT= NBCA with NBCA=NBT–NBCE. Otherwise, if zCA < zBT this limit is

25

reached (at node n), then NCT = n. Obviously, the procedure above yields also the time-
derivative of the SC outlet position moving within this channel (As described in section 3.9).
The steady state part of the total nodal mass flow (charaterized by the index 0) follows from
the basic non-linear algebraic equation (30) if setting there the time-derivative equal to 0:

From the resulting steady state enthalpy value hNn,0 follows then (by using the thermodynamic
water/steam tables) the corresponding coolant temperature value TNn,0 (with TNn,0 = TSATNn,0 if
n = NCT and zCA < zBA) and, by applying the PAX procedure (see section 3.3), their mean nodal
temperature and enthalpy values TMn,0 and hMn,0, parameters which are needed as start values
for the transient calculations. Obviously, due to the non-linearity of the basic steady state
equations, this procedure has to be done in a recursive way.
It can additionally be stated that both the steady state and transient two-phase mass flow
parameters get the trivial form

It can again be expected that at the begin of each (intermediate) time step the mean nodal void
fraction values αMn are known. This either from steady state considerations (at the start of the
transient calculations) or as a result of the integration procedure. Hence, the additional
parameters needed in the relations above can be determined too. From the PAX procedure it
follow their nodal boundary void fraction terms αNn together with their slopes α Nn
(s)  and α Mn
(s)
resp. gradient α Nn
(z)  and thus, as shown both in section 2.2.3 but also in the tables given by
Hoeld (2001 and 2002a), all the other characteristic two-phase parameters (steam, water or
relative velocities, steam qualities etc). Obviously, due to the non-linearity of the basic
equations the steady state solution procedure has to be performed in a recursive way.
If, in the transient case, the SC nodal boundary void fraction αNn does (within the entire BC)
not reach its limit value (αLIMNn=1 or 0) it follows as total number of SC nodes NCT=NBT–NBCE
and zNn (at n=NCT) =zCA=zBT. Otherwise, if this limit is reached (at node n), NCT = n, αNn=1 (or
=0) with zCA (< zBT) resulting from the integration. Then, from the procedure above also the
time-derivative of the boiling boundary, moving within BC, can be established (as this will be
discussed in section 3.9).
Hence, it follows a relation for the steam mass flow gradients

A similar relation can be established if starting from the drift flux correlation (eq.(10)) and
taking advantage of the fact that the needed drift velocity vDNn and the phase distribution
parameter C0Nn are independent from the total mass flow GNn (and can thus be determined
before knowing GNn). This term (GNn) results then by combining the eqs.(54) and (10)

From the drift flux correlation package (Hoeld et al., 1992) and (Hoeld, 1994) follow then all
the other characteristic two-phase parameters. These are especially the nodal steam mass flow
GSNn and, eventually, the slope α Nn
(z)  resp., according to eq.(53), G SNn
(s) . Then, finally, from eq.
(48) (or eq.(45)) the mean nodal void fraction time-derivative

next integration step.
Obviously, at a mixture flow situation the mean nodal temperature and enthalpy terms are
equal to their saturation values

eq.(49)) the time-derivatives equal to 0. For the total mass flow parameters a similar relation
as already given for the single-phase flow (see eq.(48)) is valid, yielding GNn,0 = GBE,0.

The nodal boundary void fraction values αNn,0 can now be determined by applying the inverse
drift-flux correlation, the mean nodal void fraction value αMn,0 from the PAX procedure. All of
them are needed as starting values for the transient calculation.
3.9. SC boundaries
The SC entrance position zCE (= zNn at n=0) is either (for the first SC within the BC) equal to BC
entrance zBE or equal to the SC outlet boundary of the SC before.

The (steady state) numbers (NCT) of (single- or two-phase) SC-s are already determined by the
eqs.(42) or (60), the nodal power terms QMCA,0 by the eqs.(41) or (59). Hence, after dividing eq.
(27) by ΔzBkqLBk-1,0 one gets an algebraic quadratic equation of the form

Then, from the relations in section 3.5, also the other characteristic steady state power terms
can be calculated.
In the transient case the SC outlet boundary zCA (=boiling boundary or mixture level) follows
(and thus also ΔzCA and NCT ), as already pointed-out, directly from the integration procedure.
During the transient this boundary can move along the entire BC (and thereby also cross BC
node boundaries). A SC can even shrink to a single node (NCT =1), start to disappear or to be
created anew. Then, if ΔzCA -> 0, in the relations above the slope in the vicinity of such a
boundary has to be replaced by a gradient (determined in PAX).
The mean nodal coolant temperature or, if LFTYPE=0, void fraction of the last SC node is
interrelated by the PAX procedure with the locally varying SC outlet boundary zCA. Hence, in
a transient situation the time-derivative of only one of these parameters is demanded. The
second one follows then from the PAX procedure after the integration.
If combining (in case of single-phase flow) the eqs.(23) and (31), the wanted relation for the SC
boundary time derivative can be expressed by

3.10. Pressure profile along a SC (and thus also BC)
After having solved the mass and energy balance equations, separately and not simultaneously
with the momentum balance, the now exact nodal SC and BC pressure difference terms (ΔPNn
= PNn - PNn-1 and ΔPBNn) can be determined for both single- or two-phase flow situations by
discretizing the momentum balance eq.(3) and, if applying a modified ‘finite element method’,
integrating the eqs.(4) to (6) over the corresponding SC nodes. The total BC pressure difference
ΔPBT = PBA - PBE between BC outlet and entrance follows then from the relation

This last term describes the influence of time-dependent changes in total mass flux along a BC

Looking at the available friction correlations, there arises the problem how to consider correctly
contributions from spacers, tube bends, abrupt changes in cross sections etc. as well. The entire
friction pressure decrease (ΔPFBT) along a BC can thus never be described in a satisfactory
manner solely by analytical expressions. To minimize these uncertainties a further friction
term, ΔPDBT, had to be included into these considerations.
The corresponding steady state additive pressure difference term ΔPDBT,0 is (according to the
eqs.(69) and (70)) fixed since it can be assumed that the total steady state BC pressure difference
ΔPBT,0 = ΔPPBT,0 is known from input. It seems, however, to be reasonable to treat this term as
a ‘friction’ (or at least the sum with ΔPFBT) and not as a ‘driving’ force. Thus it must be
demanded that these terms should remain negative. Otherwise, input terms such as the entire
pressure difference along the BC or corresponding friction factors have to be adjusted in an
adequate way.
Assuming the general additive pressure difference term ΔPDBT may have the form
(

means that ΔPDBT is either supplemented with a direct additive term (index FADD) or the
friction part is provided with a multiplicative factor (fFMP,0-1). For the additive part it will be
assumed to be the (1-εDPZ)-th part of the total additional pressure difference term and to be
proportional to the square of the total coolant mass flow, e.g., at BC entrance

with the input coefficient εDPZ = εDPZI governing from outside which of them should prevail.
From the now known steady state total ‘additional’ term ΔPDBT,0 the corresponding additive
friction factor fADD,0 follows then directly from the equation above, from eq.(73) then the
multiplicative one
fFMP,0 =1+ εDPZ
ΔPDBT,0
ΔPFBT,0 (setting εDPZ=1 if ΔPDBT,0> 0)

For the steady state description of a 3D compartment with (identical) parallel channels in a
first step a factor should be derived for a ‘mean’ channel. Then this factor can be assumed to
be valid for all the other (identical) parallel channels too (See Jewer et al., 2005).
For the transient case there arises the question how the validity of both friction factors could
be expanded to this situation too. In the here presented approach this is done by assuming
that these factors should remain time-independent, i.e., that fADD = fADD,0 and fFMP = fFMP,0. This
allows finally also to determine the wanted nodal pressure decrease term ΔPDBT of eq.(69) for
the transient case.

By adding the resulting nodal BC pressure difference terms to the (time-varying) system
pressure PSYS(t), given from outside as boundary condition with respect to a certain position
(in- or outside of the BC), then finally also the absolute nodal pressure profile PBk along the BC
can be established (This term is needed at the begin of the next time step within the constitutive
equations).
3.11. BC entrance mass flow (‘Open and closed channel concept’)
As to be seen from the sections above in order to be able to calculate the characteristic nodal
and total single- and two-phase parameters along a BC the BC entrance mass flow must be
known. This term is for the steady state case given by input (GBE = GBEIN), together with the
two pressure entrance and outlet values (PBE = PBEIN, PBA = PBAIN). In the transient situation it
can, however, be expected that for the normal case of an ‘open’ channel besides the entrance
mass flow only one of these two pressure terms is known by input, either at BC entrance or
outlet. The missing one follows then from the calculation of the pressure decrease part.
Such a procedure can not be applied without problems if the channels are part of a complex
set of closed loops. Loops consisting of more than one coolant channel (and not driven by an
outside source, such as a pump). Then the mass flow values (and especially the entrance term
of at least one of the channels) has to be adjusted with respect to the fact that the sum of the
entire pressure decrease terms along such a closed circuit must be zero. Usually, in the common
thermal-hydraulic codes (see for example the ‘separate-phase’ approaches) this problem is
handled by solving the three (or more) fundamental equations for the entire complex system
simultaneously, a procedure which affords very often immense computational times and costs.
In the here applied module (based on a separate treatment of momentum from mass and
energy balance) a more elegant method could be found by introducing an additional aspect
into the theory of CCM. It allows, different to other approaches, to take care of this situation
by solving this problem by means of a ‘closed channel concept’ (in contrast to the usual ‘open
channel’ method).
Choosing for this purpose a characteristic ‘closed’ channel within such a complex loop it can
be expected that its pressure difference term ΔPBT = ΔPBA - ΔPBE over this channel is fix (=
negative sum of all the other decrease terms of the remaining channels which can be calculated
by the usual methods). Thus also the outlet and entrance BC pressure values (PBAIN, ΔPBEIN) are
now available as inputs to CCM. Since, according to eq.(69), the term ∆PPBT is known too, then
from eq.(68) a ‘closed channel concept criterion’ can be formulated
zBT
d
dt GFBMT = ΔPGBT= ΔPPBT- ΔPBTIN
(at ‘closed channel’ conditions)
(76)
demanding that in order to fulfil this criterion the total mass flow along a BC (and thus also at
its entrance) must be adapted in such a way that the above criterion which is essential for the
‘closed channel’ concept remains valid at each time step, i.e., that the actual time derivative of
the mean mass flux GFBMT averaged over the channel must, as recommended by eq.(71), agree
in a satisfactory manner with the required one from the equation above.
Nuclear Reactor Thermal Hydraulics and Other Applications
34

There exist, obviously, different methods how to deal with this complicated problem. One of
them could be to determine the entrance mass flow GBE by changing this value in a recursive
way until the resulting term 
d
dt  GFBMT agrees with the criterion above.
Another possibility is to find a relation between the time-derivatives of the mean and of special
local mass flux values (e.g., at BC entrance), i.e., to establish for example a relation between
the terms 
d
dt GFBMT and 
d
dt  GFBE. Then the wanted mass flow time-derivative at BC entrance can
be determined directly from eq.(76). One practicable method to establish such a relation could
follow if considering that a change of the mass flux is propagating along the channel so fast
that the time derivative of its mean values could be set (in a first step) almost equal to the time-
derivative at its entrance value. This term can, eventually, be provided with a form factor which
can be adapted by an adequate recursion procedure until the condition of eq.(75) is fulfilled.
The so won entrance mass flow is then governing the mass flow behaviour of the entire loop.
This last and very provisional method has been tested by applying the UTSG-3 code (Hoeld,
2011b) for the simulation of the natural-circulation behaviour of the secondary steam generator
loop. Similar considerations have been undertaken for a 3D case where the automatic mass
flow distribution into different entrances of a set of parallel channels had to be found (See e.g.
Hoeld, 2004a and Jewer et al., 2005). The experience of such calculations should help to decide
which of the different possible procedures should finally be given preference.
The ‘open/closed channel concept’ makes sure that measures with regard to the entire closed
loop do not need to be taken into account simultaneously but (for each channel) separately. Its
application can be restricted to only one ‘characteristic’ channel of a sequence of channels of
a complex loop. This additional tool of CCM can in such cases help to handle the variety of
closed loops within a complex physical system in a very comfortable way.
4. Code package CCM
Starting from the above presented ‘drift-flux based mixture-fluid theory’ a (1D) thermal-
hydraulic coolant channel module, named CCM, could be established. A module which was
derived with the intention to provide the authors of different and sometimes very complex
thermal-hydraulic codes with a general and easily applicable tool needed for the simulation
of the steady state and transient behaviours of the most important single- and two-phase
parameters along any type of heated or cooled coolant channel.
For more details about the construction and application of the module CCM see (Hoeld,
2005, 2007a and b and 2011b).
5. Verification and Validation (V & V) procedures
During the course of development of the different versions of the code combination UTSG-3/
CCM the module has gone through an appropriate verification and validation (V&V) proce‐
The Coolant Channel Module CCM — A Basic Element for the Construction of Thermal-Hydraulic Models and Codes
http://dx.doi.org/10.5772/53372
35

dure (with continuous feedbacks being considered in the continual formulation of the
theoretical model).
CCM is (similar as done in the separate-phase models) constructed with the objective to be
used only as an element within an overall code. Hence, further V&V steps could be performed
only in an indirect way, i.e. in combination with such overall codes. This has been done in a
very successful way by means of the U-tube steam generator code UTSG-3. Thereby the module
CCM could profit from the experiences been gained in decades of years work with the
construction of an effective non-linear one-dimensional theoretical model and, based on it,
corresponding digital code UTSG-2 for vertical, natural-circulation U-tube steam generators
(Hoeld, 1978, 1988b, 1990a and 1990b), (Bencik et al., 1991) and now also the new advanced
code version UTSG-3 (Hoeld 2002b, 2004a).
The good agreement of the test calculations with similar calculations of earlier versions applied
to the same transient cases demonstrates that despite of the continuous improvements of the
code UTSG and the incorporation of CCM into UTSG-3 the newest and advanced version has
still preserved its validity.
A more detailed description over these general V&V measures demonstrated on one charac‐
teristic test case can be found in (Hoeld, 2011b).
6. Conclusions
The universally applicable coolant channel module CCM allows describing the thermal-
hydraulic situation of fluids flowing along up-, horizontal or downwards channels with fluids
changing between sub-cooled, saturated and superheated conditions. It must be recognized
that CCM represents a complete system in its own right, which requires only BC-related, and
thus easily available input values (geometry data, initial and boundary conditions, resulting
parameters from integration). The partitioning of a basic channel into SC-s is done automati‐
cally within the module, requiring no special actions on the part of the user. At the end of a
time-step the characteristic parameters of all SC-s are transferred to the corresponding BC
positions, thus yielding the final set of ODE-s together with the parameters following from the
constitutive equations of CCM.
In contrast to the currently very dominant separate-phase models, the existing theoretical
inconsistencies in describing a two-phase fluid flowing along a coolant channel if changing
between single-phase and two-phase conditions and vice versa can be circumvented in a very
elegant way in the ‘separate-region’ mixture-fluid approach presented here. A very unique
technique has been established built on the concept of subdividing a basic channel (BC) into
different sub-channels (SC-s), thus yielding exact solutions of the basic drift-flux supported
conservation equations. This type of approach shows, as discussed in (Hoeld, 2004b), distinct
advantages vs. ‘separate phase’ codes, especially if taking into account
Nuclear Reactor Thermal Hydraulics and Other Applications
36

• the quality of the fundamental equations (basic conservation equations following directly
from physical laws supported by experimentally based constitutive equations vs. split ‘field’
equations with artificial closure terms),
• the special solution methods due to the detailed interpolation procedure from PAX allowing
to calculate the exact movement of boiling boundaries and mixture (or dry-out) levels
(different to the ‘donor-cell averaging’ methods yielding mostly only ‘condensed’ levels),
• the easy replacement of new and improved correlations within the different packages
without having to change the basic equations of the theory (for example the complicated
exchange terms of a ‘separate-phase’ approach),
• the possibility to take advantage of the ‘closed-channel concept’ (needed for example for
thermal- hydraulic 3D considerations) allowing thus to decouple a characteristic (‘closed’)
channel from other parts of a complex system of loops,
• the speed of the computation,
• the derivation of the theory in close connection with the establishment of the code by taking
advantage of feedbacks coming from both sides,
• the considerable effort that has been made in verifying and checking CCM (besides an
extensive V & V procedure), with respect to the applicability and adjustment and also for
very extreme situations,
• its easy applicability,
• the maturity of the module, which is continuously enhanced by new application cases,
• taking advantage of the fact that most of the development work for the coolant channel
thermal-hydraulics has already been shifted to the establishment of the here presented
module (including the special provisions for extreme situations such as stagnant flow, zero
power or zero sub-cooling, test calculations for the verification and validation of the code
etc.).
The existence of the resulting widely verified and validated module CCM represents an
important basic element for the construction of a variety of other comprehensive thermal-
hydraulic models and codes as well. Such models and modules can be needed for the simu‐
lation of the steady state and transient behaviour of different types of steam generators, of 3D
thermal-hydraulic compartments consisting of a number of parallel channels (reactor cores,
VVER steam generators etc.). It shows special advantages in view of the determination of the
mass flow distribution into different coolant channels after non-symmetric perturbations see
(Hoeld, 2004a) or (Jewer et al., 2005), a problem which is far from being solved in many of the
newest 3D studies.
The introduction of varying cross sections along the z axis allows to take care also of thermal
non-equilibrium situations by simulating the two separate phases by two with each other
interacting basic channels (for example if injecting sub-cooled water rays into a steam dome).
The resulting equations for different channels appearing in a complex physical system can be
combined with other sets of algebraic equations and ODE-s coming from additional parts of
The Coolant Channel Module CCM — A Basic Element for the Construction of Thermal-Hydraulic Models and Codes
http://dx.doi.org/10.5772/53372
37

such a complex model (heat transfer or nuclear kinetics considerations, top plenum, main
steam system and downcomer of a steam generator etc.). The final overall set of ODE-s can
then be solved by applying an appropriate time-integration routine (Hoeld, 2004a, 2005,
2007a and b, 2011b).
The enormous efforts already made in the verification and validation of the codes UTSG-3, its
application in a number of transient calculations at very extreme situations (fast opening of
safety valves, dry out of the total channel with SC-s disappearing or created anew) brings the
code and thus also CCM to a very mature and (what is important) easily applicable state.
However, there is not yet enough experience to judge how the potential of the mixture-fluid
models and especially of CCM can be expanded to other extreme cases (e.g., water and steam
hammer). Is it justified to prefer separate-phase models versus the drift-flux based (and thus
non-homogeneous) mixture fluid models? This depends, among other criteria, also on the
quality of the special models and their exact derivation. Considering the arguments presented
above it can, however, be stated that in general the here presented module can be judged as a
very satisfactory approach.

1. Introduction
Unsteady heat transfer problems that are associated with non-isothermal ﬂow mixing in pipe
ﬂows have long been the topic of concern in the nuclear engineering community because of
the relation to thermal fatigue of nuclear power plant pipe systems. When turbulent ﬂow
streams of different velocity and density rapidly mix at the right angle, a contact interface
between the two mixing streams oscillates and breaks down because of hydrodynamic
instabilities, and large-scale unsteady ﬂow structures emerge (Figure 1). These structures
lead to low-frequency oscillations at the scale of the pipe diameter, D, with a period
scaling as O(D/U), where U is the characteristic ﬂow velocity. If the mixing ﬂow streams
are of different temperatures, the hydrodynamic oscillations are accompanied by thermal
ﬂuctuations (thermal striping) on the pipe wall. The latter accelerate thermal-mechanical
fatigue, damage the pipe structure and, ultimately, cause its failure.
The importance of this phenomenon prompted the nuclear energy modeling and simulation
community to establish a common benchmark to test the ability of computational ﬂuid
dynamics (CFD) tools to predict the effect of thermal striping.
The benchmark is based
on the thermal and velocity data measurements obtained in a recent Vattenfall experiment
designed speciﬁcally for this purpose [1, 2].
Because thermal striping is associated with
large-scale anisotropic mixing, standard engineering modeling tools based on time-averaging
approaches, such as Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) models, are badly suited.
Consequently, one must consider unsteady modeling methods such as unsteady RANS
(URANS), parabolised stability equations (PSE), or large eddy simulation (LES). Among these
choices, the LES approach is most generic and modeling-assumption free, unlike the PSE and
URANS methods, which, for instance, assume the existence of a spectral gap between the
large and the small scales. On the other hand, owing to recent advances in computing, LES
methods are becoming an increasingly affordable tool.

Figure 1. Instantaneous wall temperature distribution from Nek5000 T-junction simulation.
In this chapter, we compare the results of three LES codes produced for the Vattenfall
benchmark problem: Nek5000, developed at Argonne National Laboratory in the United
States, and CABARET and Conv3D, developed at the Moscow Institute for Nuclear Energy
Safety (IBRAE) in Russia. Nek5000 is an open source code based on the spectral-element
method (SEM), a high-order weighted residual technique that combines the geometric
ﬂexibility of the ﬁnite-element method with the tensor-product efﬁciencies of spectral
methods [3, 4].
CABARET, which stands for Compact Accurately Boundary Adjusting
high REsolution Technique, is based on the scheme of [5]. CABARET was developed as
a signiﬁcant upgrade of the second-order upwind leapfrog scheme for linear advection
equation [6, 7] to nonlinear conservation laws in one and two dimensions [8–10].
The
CABARET scheme is second-order accurate on nonuniform grids in space and time, is
nondissipative, and is low-dispersive. For nonlinear ﬂow calculations, it is equipped with
a conservative nonlinear ﬂux correction that is directly based on the maximum principle.
For 3D calculations, a new unstructured CABARET solver was developed (e.g. [11, 12]) that
operates mainly with hexagonal meshes. Conv3D is a well-established solver of IBRAE that
has been validated on various experimental and benchmark data [13, 14]. For ease of the
grid generation in the case of complex geometries, Conv3D utilizes the immersed boundary
method (IBM) on Cartesian meshes with a cut-cell approach.
The underlying scheme of
Conv3D [15] is a low-dissipative, second-order approximation in space and a ﬁrst-order
approximation in time.
This chapter is organized as follows. In Section 2 we brieﬂy describe the experimental setup
and data collection procedure. In Sections 3–5 we outline the computational models. The
results are discussed in Section 6, including a comparison of data from the simulations and
experiment.
Concluding remarks and a brief discussion of future work are provided in
Section 7.
2. Experimental conﬁguration
The Vatenfall experiment [16] is based on water ﬂow in a main pipe of diameter D=140 mm
with a side branch of diameter DH=100 mm adjoining the main at a 90 degree angle. The
pipes and the T-junction, which is made from a plexiglass block, are transparent so that the
velocity can be measured with laser Doppler anemometry (LDA). Velocity data was taken
under isothermal conditions with both ﬂows entering at 19 ◦C. In order to measure thermal
striping, time-dependent temperature data was collected from thermocouples downstream
of the T-junction with ﬂow at 19 ◦C entering the main branch and ﬂow at 36 ◦C entering the
side branch.

Table 2. Nondimensional Parameters for Vatenfall T-junction Experiment
The ﬂow enters the cold (main) branch from a stagnation chamber located 80 D upstream of
the T-junction and is assumed to be a fully developed turbulent ﬂow by the time it reaches
the T-junction. The hot branch ﬂow enters at 20DH upstream and is not quite fully developed
as it enters the T-junction. The inlet ﬂow rates are 9 and 6 liters per second (l/s), respectively
in the cold and hot branches, which corresponds to a Reynolds number of Re ≈80, 000
and 100, 000, respectively. The key dimensional parameters are summarized in Table 1 and
their nondimensional counterparts in Table 2. More detailed description of the T-junction
benchmark experiment can be found in [1, 2].
3. Nek5000 simulations
The Nek5000 simulations are based on the spectral element method developed by Patera
[3].
Nek5000 supports two formulations for spatial and temporal discretization of the
Navier-Stokes equations.
The ﬁrst is the lPN −lPN−2 method [17–19], in which the
velocity/pressure spaces are based on tensor-product polynomials of degree N and N −2,
respectively, in the reference element ˆΩ:= [−1, 1]d, for d = 2 or 3.
The computational
domain consists of the union of E elements Ωe, each of which is parametrically mapped
from ˆΩto yield a body-ﬁtted mesh.
The second is the low-Mach number formulation
due to Tomboulides and Orszag [20, 21], which uses consistent order-N approximation
spaces for both the velocity and pressure.
The low-Mach number formulation is also
valid in the zero-Mach (incompressible) limit [22].
Both formulations yield a decoupled
set of elliptic problems to be solved at each timestep. In d=3 space dimensions, one has
three Helmholtz solves of the form (βI + ν∆tA)un
i
= f n
i , i = 1, . . . , d, and a pressure
Poisson solve of the form Apn = gn at each timestep, tn, n = 1, . . . . Here, A is the
symmetric positive-deﬁnite Laplace operator, and β is an order-unity coefﬁcient coming
from a third-order backward-difference approximation to the temporal derivative. (For the
lPN −lPN−2 method, the Laplace operator A is replaced by a spectrally equivalent matrix
arising from the unsteady Stokes equations [4, 19].) For marginally resolved LES cases, we
ﬁnd that the higher-order pressure approximation of the lPN −lPN formulation tends to yield
improved skin-friction estimates, and this is consequently the formulation considered here.

Figure 2. Computational mesh for Nek5000 T-junction simulation comprising E=62176 elements.
Consisting of E = 62, 176 elements, the computational mesh for the Nek5000 simulations was
generated by using CUBIT and read through the Nek-MOAB coupling interface [23]. Within
each element, velocity and pressure are represented as Lagrange interpolating polynomials
on tensor products of Nth-order Gauss-Lobatto-Legendre points. Unless otherwise noted,
all the simulations were run with polynomial order N=7, corresponding to a total number of
mesh points n ≈EN3 ≈21 million. Figure 2 shows a closeup of the mesh in the vicinity of
the origin, which is located at the intersection of the branch centerlines. The inlet for the main
branch is at x=-9.2143 and for the hot branch at z=6.4286. These lengths permitted generation
of fully developed turbulence upstream of the T-junction, as described below. The outlet at
x=22 was chosen to allow downstream tracking of temperature data at locations provided in
the experiment. Away from the origin, the axial extent of the spectral elements in the main
branch is 0.18 D, corresponding to a maximum axial mesh spacing of δxmax = 0.0377. At
the wall, the wall-normal element size is 0.01222, corresponding to a minimum spacing of
δyn ≈0.0008. The submitted simulations were run with Re = 40, 000 in the inlet branches,
Nuclear Reactor Thermal Hydraulics and Other Applications
48

yielding Re = 60, 000 in the outlet. Downstream of the T-junction, the ﬁrst grid point away
from the wall is thus at y+ ≈2.5 in wall units.
Inlet ﬂow conditions in the main branch are based on a recycling technique in which the
inlet velocity at time tn is given by αu( ˜x, y, z, tn−1), where ˜x = −3 and α is chosen to ensure
that the mass ﬂow rate at inﬂow is constant (R
un(−9, y, z)dy dz ≡π/4). Recycling is also
used for the hot branch, save that the inﬂow condition is 0.8βu(x, y, ˜z, tn−1) −0.2UH, with β
chosen so that the average inﬂow velocity is -UH and ˜z = 2.1. The 0.8 multiplier was added
in order to give a ﬂatter proﬁle characteristic of the non-fully-developed ﬂow realized in the
experiment, but a systematic study of this parameter choice was not performed (see also
Section 6.1.1).
Initial conditions for all branches were taken from fully developed turbulent pipe ﬂow
simulations at Re = 40, 000.
The timestep size was ∆t = 2.5 × 10−4 in convective time
units, or about 6 × 10−5 seconds in physical units corresponding to the experiment. The
simulation was run to a time of t=28 convective time units prior to acquiring data. Data
was then collected over the interval t ∈[28, 58] (in convective time units) for the benchmark
submission1 and over t ∈[28, 104] subsequently (longer average) both with N = 7.
In
addition to N = 7 results (i.e., with n ≈EN3 ≈2.1 × 107 points), Nek5000 runs were
conducted with N = 5 (n ≈7.7 × 106 points) and with N = 9 (n ≈4.5 × 107 points). The
case with N = 5 started with the N = 7 results and was run and averaged over about
110 convective time units (i.e., about 26 seconds). The timestep size for N = 5 runs was
twice as big (i.e, ∆t = 5 × 10−4). The benchmark submission results required approximately
3.4 × 105 CPU hours on Intrepid (IBM BlueGene/P) while the follow-up study for a longer
time average results took additional 5.9 × 105 CPU hours. Note that all Nek5000 results
reported here were obtained with constant density equal to the nondimensional value of
1.000 (see Table 2).
4. CABARET simulations
The system of Navier-Stokes equations in a slightly compressible form (i.e., for a constant
sound speed) is solved with a new code based on CABARET. In order to lessen the
computational grid requirements, the code uses hybrid unstructured hexahedral/tetrahedral
grids.
CABARET is an extension of the original second-order, upwind leapfrog scheme
[6] to nonlinear conservation laws [5, 24] and to multiple dimensions [9, 25].
In
summary, CABARET is an explicit, nondissipative, conservative ﬁnite-difference scheme
of second-order approximation in space and time.
In addition to having low numerical
dispersion, CABARET has a very compact computational stencil because of the use of
separate variables for ﬂuxes and conservation. The stencil is staggered in space and time
and for advection includes only one computational cell. For nonlinear ﬂows, CABARET
uses a low-dissipative, conservative ﬂux correction method directly based on the maximum
principle [8]. In the LES framework, the nonlinear ﬂux correction plays the role of implicit
turbulence closure following the MILES approach of Grinstein and Fureby [26, ch.5], which
was discussed in the ocean modeling context in [10].
A detailed description of the CABARET code on a mixed unstructured grid will be the
subject of a future publication; an outline of the method on a structured Cartesian grid is

For the T-junction problem with the CABARET method, two hybrid computational grids
are used with 0.53 and 4 million cells. Figure 3 shows the layout of (a) the computational
domain, (b,d) the hexahedral grid with a uniform Cartesian block in the pipe center, and

For specifying inlet boundary conditions, a recycling technique is used similar to that for
Nek5000. The outﬂow boundary is prescribed by using characteristic boundary conditions.
For the inlet boundaries at the main and the hot branch, laminar inﬂow conditions are
speciﬁed based on prescribing the mean ﬂow velocity proﬁles.
The length of the pipe
upstream of the junction was sufﬁciently far from the junction to permit an adequate
turbulent ﬂow upstream of the junction. The outﬂow boundary is imposed at 20 jet diameters
downstream of the junction, where characteristic boundary conditions are set.
In order to speed statistical convergence, the LES CABARET solution was started from
a precursor RANS k-epsilon calculation.
The CABARET simulation was then run for 10
seconds to allow the statistics to settle down.
This was followed by the production run
during which the required solution ﬁelds were stored for a duration of 5 and 10 seconds.
The computations on grids with 0.53 and 4 million cells required approximately 1.8 × 104
and 2.9 × 105 CPU hours on Lomonosov (Intel Xeon X5570 / X5670 processors).
5. Conv3D simulations
Researchers at IBRAE have been developing a 3D, uniﬁed, numerical thermal-hydraulic
technique for safety analysis of the nuclear power plants, which includes (1) methods,

algorithms, and software for automatically generating computing grids with local reﬁnement
near body borders;
(2) methods and algorithms for solving heat and mass transfer
compressible/incompressible problems for research of 3D thermal-hydraulic phenomena;
and (3) approaches for modeling turbulence.
For grid construction at IBRAE an automatic technology using CAD systems for
designing the computational domain has been developed.
A generation of structured
orthogonal/Cartesian grids with a local reﬁnement near boundaries is incorporated into a
specially developed program that has a user-friendly interface and can be utilized on parallel
computers [27]. The computational technique is based on the developed algorithms with
small-scheme diffusion, for which discrete approximations are constructed with the use of
ﬁnite-volume methods and fully staggered grids. For modeling 3D turbulent single-phase
ﬂows, the LES approach (commutative ﬁlters) and a quasi-direct numerical simulation
(QDNS) approach are used. For simulation of 3D turbulent two-phase ﬂows by means of
DNS, detailed grids and effective numerical methods developed at IBRAE for solving CFD
problems are applied. For observing the interface of two-phase ﬂow, a modiﬁed level set (LS)
method and multidimensional advection/convection schemas of total variation diminishing
(TVD) type with small scheme diffusion involving subgrid simulation (with local resolution)
are used. The Conv3D code is fully parallelized and highly effective on high-performance
computers. The developed modules were validated on a series of well-known tests with
Rayleigh numbers ranging from 106 to 1016 and Reynolds numbers ranging from 103 to 105.

where p is pressure, normalized by the density. The basic features of the numerical algorithm
[14, 28] are the following. An operator-splitting scheme for the Navier-Stokes equations is
used as the predictor-corrector procedure with correction for the pressure δp:

(10)
In order to construct the time-integration scheme for the energy equation, its operators are
decomposed into two parts associated with the enthalpy and temperature, respectively; the
following two-step procedure results:
hn+1/2 −hn
τ
+ ˜C(un) hn+1/2 = 0,
(11)
hn+1 −hn+1/2
τ
−˜N Tn+1 = 0.
(12)
In the momentum equation, the operators are also split into two parts. The ﬁrst part is
associated with the velocity transport by convection/diffusion written in linearized form
as A1 = C(un) + N, where N = div
 µ
ρ grad v

. The second part deals with the pressure
gradient A2 = grad. We note that the gradient and divergence operators are adjoints of each
other (i.e., A∗
2 = −div). The additive scheme of splitting looks like the following:
vn+1/2 −vn
τ
+ A1vn+1/2 + A2pn = f n,
(13)
vn+1 −vn
τ
+ A1vn+1/2 + A2pn+1 = f n,
(14)
A∗
2 vn+1 = 0,
(15)
where f n is the right-hand side. This numerical scheme is used as the predictor-corrector
procedure.
That is, introducing the pressure correction in Equations 14–15 leads to the
well-known Poisson equation and the equation for velocity correction in the form of
Equations 9–10.
In computational mathematics two variants of ﬁctitious domain methods are recognized:
continuation of coefﬁcients at lower-order derivatives and continuation of coefﬁcients at
the highest-order derivatives. Both approaches are commonly used in computational ﬂuid
dynamics involving phase change processes. Here the ﬁrst variant is employed, which in a
physical sense can be considered as inclusion into the momentum equations of the model of
a porous medium:

Various formulae of cǫ can be employed for the ﬂow resistance term in these equations. For

An iterative method with a Chebyshev set of parameters using a fast Fourier transform
(FFT) solver for the Laplace operator as a preconditioner can serve as an alternative to
the conjugate gradient method. The application of this approach for solving the elliptical
equations with variable coefﬁcients allows one to reach 50 times the acceleration of the
commonly used method of conjugate gradients.
For solving the convection problem, a
regularized nonlinear monotonic operator-splitting scheme was developed [15]. A special
treatment of approximation of convection terms C(v) results in the discrete convective
operator, which is skew-symmetric and does not contribute to the kinetic energy (i.e., is
energetically neutral [15]). The numerical scheme is second, and ﬁrst-order accurate in space
and time, correspondingly. The algorithm is stable at a large-enough integration timestep.
Details of the validation for the approach on a wide set of both 2D and 3D tests are reported
in [29].
In the next section, we present the numerical results computed with Conv3D on a uniform
mesh with 40 million nodes. For the sensitivity study (Section 6.2), we provide results from
computation on a uniform mesh with 12 million nodes and on a nonuniform mesh with 3
and 40 million nodes with near-wall reﬁnement. The computations on a uniform mesh with
40 million nodes required approximately 4.3 × 104 CPU hours on Lomonosov (Intel Xeon
X5570 / X5670 processors).
6. Results
We focus here on a comparison of the experimental data with the numerical results from
three simulation codes: Nek5000, CABARET, and Conv3D. In Section 6.2 we study the
velocity ﬁeld sensitivity to the computational mesh and integration time interval. A similar
sensitivity study is undertaken in Section 6.3, where we investigate the effects of grid
resolution and time integration interval on the reattachment region immediately downstream
of the T-junction. A comparison of velocity and temperature spectra for these codes will be
reported elsewhere [30].
All results presented here are nondimensionalized with the cold inlet parameters according
to Table 1. For reference, the mean and rms quantities for a set of temporal values un =

6.1. Comparison with experiment
In this section, we compare the results of the three codes with experimental data. First we
look at the inlet proﬁles in the cold and hot branches of the T-junction and then at the vertical
and horizontal proﬁles of the mean and rms axial velocity downstream of the junction.
6.1.1. Cold and Hot Inlets
Figure 4 shows the proﬁles of the mean (top) and rms (bottom) streamwise velocity in the
cold branch at x = −3.1 (left) and in the hot inlet branch at z = 2.14286 (i.e., z∗/DH = 3)
(right).
The experimental data are plotted with symbols, the blue solid line represents
the Nek5000 simulation, and red dashed line are the inlet proﬁles from the CABARET
simulation. Note that the streamwise component of velocity for cold inlet coincides with the
x-direction, while the hot ﬂow in the hot inlet is in the direction opposite the z coordinate;
hence, −w is plotted for the hot inlet. Also note that experimental data is plotted in the same
style as in [2, Figures 5 and 6 or Figures A5 and A8].
We have observed that the normalized experimental data for the cold inlet does not integrate
to unity, indicating a discrepancy between the reported ﬂow rate and the LDA measurements
of approximately 6%. On the contrary, using the trapezoidal rule, the integrals of Nek5000
proﬁles for the cold and hot inlets are equal to 1.0027 and 1.3080, respectively, once averaged
over and normalized by the corresponding inlet cross-sections.
The same integration
procedure for CABARET proﬁles in Figure 4 gives the normalized inlet ﬂow rates equal
to 1.014 and 1.330 for the cold and hot inlets, respectively.
These values are in a good
agreement with the nondimensional values for inlet velocities U = 1.000 and UH = 1.307
given in Table 2. Note that the normalized inlet mass ﬂow rates for Nek5000 were averaged
over the ξ = z line (y = 0) and ξ = y line (z = 0) for the cold inlet and over the ξ = x line
(y = 0) and ξ = y line (x = 0) for the hot inlet (Figure 4).
Moreover, a comparison of the shape of the inlet simulation proﬁles with the experimental
data reveals a few differences. The shape of the hot inlet proﬁle for the mean and rms
velocity for Nek5000 simulation is not as ﬂat as the experimental or CABARET proﬁles.
This difference can be attributed to a particular modeling of the non-fully-developed ﬂow
with the recycling technique described in Section 3. Note that the same technique works
nearly perfectly for the cold inlet, where the proﬁle of the mean velocity for Nek5000
is in excellent agreement with the experimental data points after multiplication by 0.94
factor to account for the mass conservation uncertainty of 6%.
Similarly, the cold inlet
rms velocity for Nek5000 data shows good agreement, diverging from the experimental
data points only in the near-wall region, which can be explained by the lower Reynolds
number of the simulation, Re = 4 × 105 (cf. Table 2). These results indicate that further
investigation is needed into the effects of the non-fully-developed ﬂow in the hot inlet for
Nek5000 simulation.

On the contrary, the CABARET simulation models the ﬂat proﬁle at the hot inlet well
(Figure 4, right). The cold inlet proﬁles, however, deviate substantially from the experimental
data, especially in the case of rms proﬁles (Figure 4, left).
6.1.2. Downstream of the T-Junction
We next look at the axial mean u and rms u′ velocity downstream of the T-junction.
Figure 5 shows a “bird’s-eye” view of the mean (u) and rms (u′) velocity proﬁles
downstream of the T-junction at x=0.6, 1.6, 2.6, 3.6, and 4.6. Here the experimental data

It is encouraging that overall agreement of simulation results for the three codes with the

recirculation region at x = 1.6 and z > 0 (Figure 6). However, close to the T-junction, at x=1.6
and 2.6, the CABARET proﬁles of the mean axial velocity deviate from experimental points
at z > 0 (Figures 6–7) and near the centerline y = 0 (Figures 10–11). Similar to CABARET
proﬁles, the Conv3D results (magenta lines) show the most deviation from experimental
data for the mean axial velocity at z > 0 (Figures 6–9) and near the centerline y = 0
(Figures 10–13).
However, the agreement of Conv3D simulation with experiment is best
at x = 4.6 and 0.4 < |y| < 0.5 (Figure 13).
6.2. Sensitivity study
To study the effects of increasing resolution and time averaging interval, we performed an
additional set of simulations with Nek5000, CABARET, and Conv3D.
The Figures 14–16 highlight the mesh sensitivity of velocity proﬁles extracted from results of
numerical simulations with Nek5000, CABARET and Conv3D, correspondingly. Each ﬁgure
compares the vertical and horizontal proﬁles of the mean axial velocity u and its rms u′ for
different meshes with the experimental data. More detailed comparisons can be found in
[31].
In addition to the benchmark submission results with N = 7 (i.e., n ≈EN3 ≈2.1 × 107
points), Nek5000 runs were conducted with N = 5 (n ≈7.7 × 106 points).
This case
started with the N = 7 results and was run with ∆t = 5 × 10−4 and averaged over about
110 convective time units (i.e., about 26 seconds). Figure 14 shows the vertical (left) and
horizontal (right) proﬁles of the mean (top) and rms (bottom) axial velocity proﬁles at x=0.6
(magenta), 1.6 (black), 2.6 (blue), 3.6 (green), and 4.6 (red) with N = 5 (dashed) and N = 7
(solid). The benchmark submission results (i.e., with N=7 and shorter time average) plotted
with dash-dotted line at x = 1.6 . . . 4.6 are in the excellent agreement with the longer time
average run (solid). All proﬁles agree well with the experimental data points (symbols),
especially considering the fact that the Reynolds number of these simulations, Re = 4 × 105,
is two times less than that of the experiment (see Table 2). In general, the proﬁles from the
coarse mesh simulation (i.e., N = 5, dashed) are close to the solution for the ﬁner mesh (solid
and dash-dotted lines). Note the excellent agreement between the proﬁles for N = 5 and
N = 7 at x = 0.6, where the strength of the reversed ﬂow is close to its peak (Figure 17). The
largest deviation in the proﬁles (up to about 0.2) is observed at x = 1.6 and 0.1 < z < 0.25;
thus, a further study is warranted with even ﬁner mesh, say, N = 8 or N = 9.
Similarly, for the CABARET simulations, the vertical and horizontal proﬁles of u and u′ are
plotted in Figure 15 at x = 1.6 . . . 4.6. These ﬁgures show results from CABARET calculations
on a coarser mesh with 0.5 million points averaged over a half time interval (red dotted) and
the full time interval (blue dash-dotted) and on a ﬁner mesh with 4 million points averaged
over a half time interval (green dashed) and the full time interval (solid black line). Note the
excellent convergence for the mean axial velocity proﬁles at x = 3.6 and x = 4.6.
For the Conv3D simulations, the vertical and horizontal proﬁles of u and u′ are plotted in
Figure 16 at x = 1.6 . . . 4.6. This ﬁgure shows results from Conv3D simulations on a 40
million node uniform (black solid) and nonuniform (blue dash-dotted) mesh, on a 12 million
node uniform mesh (green dashed), and on a 3 million node nonuniform mesh (red dotted
line). Note the good convergence for the mean axial velocity proﬁles at x = 1.6 . . . 3.6 and
z < 0.

6.3. Study of reversed ﬂow region
To address the discrepancy between experimental data and simulations near the upper wall
at x = 1.6, we have also undertaken a series of Nek5000 simulations to investigate the
sensitivity of the reattachment of the recirculation region downstream of the T-junction.
Summarizing the effects of Reynolds number, grid resolution, and time averaging on the
reversed ﬂow region, Figure 17 shows time-averaged velocity proﬁles near the upper wall at
z=0.005 and y=0 for Nek5000 simulations at Re = 9 × 104 with N = 11 (red), at Re = 6 × 104

lines that correspond to experimental proﬁle measurements and u = 0 value.
Based on this study, we conclude that the reattachment region is insensitive mainly to
an increase in Reynolds number and grid resolution. Moreover, results at Re = 4 × 104
indicate that the recirculation region is not sensitive to the averaging/integration time
interval.
Ideally, one should conduct a further investigation at higher Reynolds number

and experimental data points near the upper wall at x = 1.6.
For now, we quote
that in the experimental measurements of velocity, “. . . the focus . . . is not the near-wall
region” [2, p. 15]. This underscores a necessity of conducting concurrent experiments and
validation simulations in which discrepancies like the extent of reciculation region or ﬂow
rate uncertainty arising here could be easier to detect and additional data acquisitions and
simulations could be performed in order to resolve them.

7. Conclusions and future work
Several fully unsteady computational models in the framework of large eddy simulations
(LES) are implemented for a thermohydraulic transport problem relevant to the design of
nuclear power plant pipe systems. Speciﬁcally, numerical simulations for the recent 2010
OECD/NEA Vattenfall T-junction benchmark problem concerned with thermal stripping in
a T-junction have been conducted with three numerical techniques based on ﬁnite-difference
implicit LES (CABARET code), ﬁnite-volume LES (CONV3D code) and spectral-element
(Nek5000 code) approaches.
The simulation results of all three methods, including the
blind test submission results of Nek5000, show encouraging agreement with the experiment
despite some differences in the operating conditions between the simulations and the
experiment. In particular, the Nek5000 results tend to closely match the experiment data
close to the T-junction, and the CABARET solution well captures the experimental proﬁles
farther downstream of the junction. The differences in the operating conditions between
the simulation and the experiment include the uncertainty of the mass ﬂow rate reported
in the experiment (about 6%), a reduction in the effective Reynolds number used in some
of the simulations that was needed to speedup the computations (Nek5000), and some
discrepancies in the inﬂow boundary conditions. Nevertheless, the good level of agreement
between the current simulations and the experiment despite these discrepancies indicates
that the ﬂow dynamics in the T-junction experiment is driven mainly by large-scale mixing
effects that were not very sensitive to the differences in the operating conditions.
For further investigation, the improvement of the quality of turbulent inﬂow conditions
(most notably, at the hot inlet boundary for Nek5000 and at the cold inlet for CABARET)
is planned as well as running additional high-resolution simulations to capture the high
Reynolds number regimes typical of the experiment. A further study also will be devoted to
a detailed analysis of the temporal spectra of velocity and temperature ﬂuctuations obtained
from all three LES solutions.

CFD as a Tool for the Analysis of the Mechanical
Integrity of Light Water Nuclear Reactors
Hernan Tinoco
Additional information is available at the end of the chapter
http://dx.doi.org/10.5772/52691
1. Introduction
The analysis of the mechanical integrity of Light Water Nuclear Reactors has experienced a
strong evolution in the two latest decades. Until the nineteen eighties, the structural design
was practically based on static loads with amplifying factors to take dynamic effects into ac‐
count, (see e. g. Laheyand Moody, 1993), and on wide safety margins. Even if an incipient
methodology for studying earthquake effects already existed, it was only at the end of the
nineties when a complete analysis about dynamic loads, caused by a steam line guillotine-
break of a BWR, was carried out for the first time (Hermansson and Thorsson, 1997). This
analysis, based on a three-dimensional Computational Fluid Dynamic (CFD) simulation of
the break, revealed a discrepancy with former applied loads that had never been exposed in
the past due to inappropriate experimental setup geometry (Tinoco, 2001). In addition, the
analysis pointed out the importance of also studying the load frequencies. The complete is‐
sue is further discussed in Section 3.
Nonetheless, CFD has shown to be a much more versatile tool. Issues like checking the max‐
imum temperature of the core shroud of the reactor, when the power of the reactor is uprat‐
ed (Tinoco et al., 2008), or estimating the thermal loadings during different transient
conditions when the Emergency Core Cooling System (ECCS) has been modified, (Tinoco et
al., 2005), or studying the automatic boron injection during an Anticipated Transient With‐
out Scram (ATWS),(Tinoco et al., 2010a), have all been settled by means of CFD simulations.
Even more significantly, a rather complete CFD model of the Downcomer, internal Main Recir‐
culation Pumps (MRP) and Lower Plenum up to the Core Inlet, (Tinoco and Ahlinder, 2009),
has shed some light concerning the thermal mixing in the different regions of the reactor and al‐
so about the appropriateness of using connected sub-models as constituting parts of a larger
model. The complete matter of thermal mixing is discussed in detail in Section 4.

Last but not least, CFD has demonstrated that it can be used to establish the causes of compo‐
nent failure. Even if justified suspicions existed about the cause of two broken control rods and
of a large number of rods with cracks at the twin reactors Oskarshamn 3 and Forsmark 3, no
knowledge existed about the details of the failure process (Tinoco and Lindqvist, 2009). It was
first when time dependent CFD simulations revealed the structure of the thermal mixing proc‐
ess in the control rod guide tube that the cause, thermal fatigue of the rods, was confirmed and
understood (Tinoco and Lindqvist, 2009, Tinocoet al., 2010b, Angele et al., 2011). This subject,
together with the general problem of conjugate heat transfer, is analysed in Section 5.
Firstly, this chapter intends to communicate an historical view of CFD applied to the analy‐
sis of the mechanical integrity of Light Water Nuclear Reactors. Secondly, the chapter exam‐
ines and evaluates several methodologies and approaches corresponding to the present and
future modelling in the field of thermal hydraulics related to this type of analysis.
2. The determination of loadings
Considering the devastating effect that uncontrolled loadings may have on life and property,
this section will begin by evoking the history of pressure vessel advance. This road to progress
is paved with disastrous accidents which, during the decade of the eighteen eighties, amount‐
ed in the USA to more than 2000 boiler explosions. The establishment of ASME in February
1880 was, according to legend, directly prompted by the need to solve the problem of unsafe
boilers (Varrasi, 2005). But it was first after the explosion on March 20, 1905, of the boiler of the
R. B. Grover & Company Shoe Factory in Brockton, Massachusetts, (see Fig. 1 below, USGen‐
Web, 2011, Ellenberger et al., 2004) that the real effort of developing rules and regulations for
the construction of secure steam boilers speeded up, urged by the public opinion. During the
subsequent years, many states legislated, without too much coordination, about what was con‐
sidered suitable instructions and procedures, leading to inconsistency in the construction re‐
quirements. Finally, in the spring of 1915, the first ASME Rules for Construction of Stationary
Boilers and For Allowable Working Pressures consisting of one book of 114 pages, known as the
1914 edition, was made available, and the path towards regulation uniformity commenced.

Since then, the ASME Code has become both larger and more comprehensive, comprising
today 28 books, with 12 books dedicated to the Construction and Inspection of Nuclear
Power Plant Components. Fortunately, even the boiler explosion trend in the USA has radi‐
cally changed since 1905, as Figure 2 below shows.
Figure 2. Trend for boiler explosions in the USA (from Hill, 2008).
For nuclear applications, the complete ASME code is mandatory only in the USA. In the Eu‐
ropean Union, on the other hand, no coordination process has been agreed. The Pressure
Equipment Directive, (EU, 1997), has been adopted by the European Parliament and the Eu‐
ropean Council for harmonizing the national laws of Member States to promote and facili‐
tate trade and exchange between States. But in the nuclear field, the application limits of the
Directive and the Nuclear Codes (possibly ASME) have to be agreed with the National Nu‐
clear Regulatory Authorities.
2.1. Section III
The ASME Boiler and Pressure Vessel Code, Section III, Rules for Construction of Nuclear
Power Plant Components, of which the last Edition is from 2010, (ASME, 2010), regulates
the design and construction of nuclear facility components. This Section “provides require‐
ments for the materials, design, fabrication, examination, testing, inspection, installation,
certification, stamping, and overpressure protection of nuclear power plant components,
and component and piping supports. Components include metal vessels and systems,
pumps, valves, and core support structures.”
Section III comprises Divisions 1, 2 and 3 and the introductory Subsection NCA that speci‐
fies General Requirements for Divisions 1 and 2. Division 1 contains eight Subsections,
namely NB, for Class 1 Components, NC, for class 2 Components, ND, for class 3 Compo‐
nents, NE, for class MC Components, NF, for Supports, NG, for Core Support Structures,
NH, for Class 1 Components in Elevated Temperature Service, and Appendices, both man‐
datory and nonmandatory, including, inter alia, a listing of design and design analysis
methods.

2.2. Categorisation of parts in code classes
The aforementioned Code classes are proposed for the categorisation of parts of a nuclear
power system, in accordance with the level of importance related to their function in the safe
operation of the plant. However, the Code does not provide guidance for classifying the dif‐
ferent parts. Classification, which is the responsibility of the Owner, has to be achieved by
applying system safety criteria to be found in engineering standards and/or requirements of
the Nuclear Regulatory Authorities. For instance, Class 1 components are those that are part
of the primary core cooling system, or components that are used in elevated temperature
service, and are constructed in accordance with the rules of Subsection NB. Class 2 compo‐
nents are those that are part of various important-to-safety emergency core cooling systems,
and are constructed in accordance with the rules of Subsection NC. Class 3 components are
those that are part of the various systems needed for plant operation, and are constructed in
accordance with the rules of Subsection ND. Class MC components are metal containment
vessels constructed in conformity with the rules of Subsection NE. Class CS components are
core support structures constructed in accordance with the rules of Subsection NG. Manda‐
tory and/or nonmandatory modifications and/or extensions to these classes may be included
by Nuclear Regulatory or other Authorities, (STUK, 2000, IAEA, 2010).
2.3. Mechanical integrity and design specifications
The requirements for mechanical integrity are based on Norms and aim at ensuring that nu‐
clear components shall withstand pressure and other types of loadings without system
break or leakage. The Class to which the component belongs to shall govern the choice of
Norms that are used for the analysis of its mechanical integrity. Design Specifications for
mechanical integrity shall indicate the Loadings and Loading Combinations that a mechani‐
cal component is submitted to and, at the same time, the acceptable level of the Loadings
and Loading Combinations, i.e. Loading Limits.
Within the realm of the ASME Code, the introductory Subsection NCA covers “general re‐
quirements for manufacturers, fabricators, installers, designers, material manufacturers, ma‐
terial suppliers, and owners of nuclear power plants”, (ASME, 2010). Here, Subsection
NCA-2142 imposes to the Owner or his designee the duty of “identify the Loadings and
combinations of Loadings and establish the appropriate Design, Service, and Test Limits for
each component or support”. For this purpose, Loadings are separated into Design, Service
and Test Loadings, and their Limits correspond to the acceptable Loadings permitted in a
structural analysis. General directions about the characterization of Design, Service and Test
Limits may be found in Subsection NCA-2142.4.
In order to be able to determine the Loadings that a component or support is submitted to,
the different operating conditions that may affect the component or support have to be de‐
fined. The selection should include Normal Operation, Abnormal Conditions and Accidents
that the component or support shall successfully withstand. Also, to be able to estimate the
Limits that the Loadings must conform to, each operation condition must be related to an
occurrence probability, being a lower probability associated with higher acceptable Limits.
This matter may be solved by an event classification such as that of ANSI/ANS (1983a) for
Nuclear Reactor Thermal Hydraulics and Other Applications
74

PWR and ANSI/ANS (1983b) for BWR. Here, Plant Condition PC1 corresponds to normal
operating conditions, PC2 to anticipated conditions (occurrence frequency of > 10-2 times/
year), PC3 to abnormal operating conditions (occurrence frequency of 10-2 - 10-4 times/year),
PC4 to postulated accidents (occurrence frequency of 10-4- 10-6 times/year) and PC5 to low
probability accidents (occurrence frequency of 10-6 - 10-7 times/year).
2.4. Design loadings and limits
Subsection NCA-2142.1 indicates that the Design Loadings shall be specified by stipulating
(a) the Design Pressure, (b) the Design Temperature and (c) the Design Mechanical Loads.
External and internal Design Pressure shall be consistent with the maximum pressure differ‐
ence between the inside and outside of the item, or between any two chambers of a combi‐
nation unit. The Design Temperature shall be equal to or higher than the expected
maximum thickness-mean metal temperature of the part considered. The Design Mechanical
Loads “shall be selected so that when combined with the effects of Design Pressure, they
produce the highest primary stresses of any coincident combination of loadings for which
Level A Service Limits (see below about limits) are designated in the Design Specification”.
Primary stresses are those arising from the imposed loading, not those developed by con‐
straining the free displacement of the structural system. Primary stresses are necessary to
satisfy the mechanical equilibrium of the system. The component or support shall be struc‐
turally analysed for the Loadings associated with Design Pressure, Design Temperature and
Design Mechanical Loads where, in general, their possible cyclic or transient behaviour is
not included.
Design Limits shall designate the limits for Design Loadings. The Limits for Design Load‐
ings shall conform to the requisites given in the applicable Subsection of Section III, i.e. NB,
NC, ND, NE, NF or NG. In the event of Loadings that are not structurally analysed, the Lim‐
its are set to the same level as Service Limits A (see below).
2.5. Service loadings and limits
From the defined operation conditions, the Service Loadings may now be derived. Service
Loadings are all loadings that a component is subject to under predictable normal and ab‐
normal operational conditions and postulated accidents that have to be included in the De‐
sign Specification. More specifically, Service Loadings are pressure, temperature loads,
mechanical loads and their possible cyclic or transient behaviour (see e.g. Subsection
NCA-2142.2). Related loadings shall be integrated in Service Loading Combinations which,
together with the corresponding Plant Condition or assigned probability, shall be assessed
against relevant Limits.
According to Subsection NCA-2142-3, Service Limits are divided into four levels, namely
Service Limits A, B, C and D. Service Limit A corresponds to bounds that contain the safety
margins and factors that are required for the component to completely fulfil the specified
performance. Service Limit B corresponds to bounds that contain smaller safety margins and
factors than Limit A, but that still ensure a component free from damage. Service Limits C
CFD as a Tool for the Analysis of the Mechanical Integrity of Light Water Nuclear Reactors
http://dx.doi.org/10.5772/52691
75

and D correspond to bounds with even more reduced safety margins and factors that now
may lead to permanent deformation and damage of the component, a situation requiring re‐
pair of the component. The last two Limit levels may not be suitable for pressure vessels
since their mechanical integrity should not be jeopardised.
The Plant Conditions (operation conditions together with their corresponding occurrence
probability) shall decide which Limit to be applied. This coupling shall be account for in the
Safety Analysis of the system (see e.g. ANSI/ANS 51.1 or ANSI/ANS 52.1, Appendix 2).
In the evaluation of a component according to Section III, Subsections NB, NC, ND, NE, NF
or NG, quantifying values corresponding to Service Limits A to D shall be assigned to the
allowed stresses.
2.6. Test loadings and limits
Test Loadings correspond to all Loadings that a component is subjected to during the tests
that the component has to undergo. In general, these correspond to pressure tests but, if oth‐
er types of tests are required, these must be stated in the Design Specification (see Subsec‐
tion NCA-2142.3).
Test Limits indicate bounds for the tests to be performed on a component. In the evaluation
of a component according to Section III, Subsections NB, NC, ND, NE, NF or NG, quantify‐
ing values corresponding to the Test Limits shall be assigned to the allowed stresses.
2.7. Load combinations
The overall-categorized Loadings with their corresponding Limits comprise a part of the
background necessary to accomplish a structural analysis. Its complementary part is consti‐
tuted by Load Combinations, the definition of which is, according to NCA-2142, a responsi‐
bility of the Owner of the Nuclear Facility, or of his designee. The combination of already
identified Loads has to consider the type of Load, i.e. static or dynamic, global or local. In
addition, the combination has to determine if they are consecutive or simultaneous, i.e. pres‐
sure and temperature loads related to a Loss of Coolant Accident (LOCA). Also, the time
history of each Load shall be taken into account in order to prevent an unlikely superposi‐
tion of non-simultaneous peaks. Eventually, the occurrence probability of each load combi‐
nation shall be assessed.
Consequently, Design Conditions may include not only static loads like Design Pressure
(DP), Design Temperature (TD) and Dead Weight (DW) but also dynamic loads like those
generated by, for instance, the opening/closing of one safety valve (GV/SRV(1)). In the com‐
bination notation, the number of valves involved is indicated within parenthesis. Also, the
occurrence probability of the maximum load may be added as the inverse of the number of
valve activations under which this maximum is achieved, for instance “≥ E-3”, meaning the
maximum load in 1000 activations (see e.g. Table 1).
More specifically, the loadings due to Operational Transients and Postulated Accidents
may, for instance, include the Operation Pressure (PO), the Operation Temperature (TO),
Nuclear Reactor Thermal Hydraulics and Other Applications
76

temperature transient (TT), joint displacement of reactor nozzle (D/RPV), building displace‐
ment (DB), condensation-induced water hammer when starting the high pressure Emergen‐
cy Core Cooling (HP-ECCS) system or the Feed Water System (WH/SC), water hammer by
star/stop of a pump (WH/PT) and global vibration due to safety valve discharge (GV/SRV).
The loadings due to Postulated Accidents may also include water hammer caused by a
pipe break external to the Containment (WH/PBO), reactor vibrations generated by inter‐
nal pipe break in the Containment (PRVV/PBI), global vibrations due to condensation os‐
cillations in the suppression pool (GV/CO) and global vibration by condensation-induced
pressure pulses, chugging, in the suppression pool, (GV/CH). Finally, loads caused by
other incidents may be those corresponding to global vibrations due to Safe-Shutdown
Earthquake (GV/SSE).
In a linear structural analysis, the effect of a Load Combinations is evaluated by a simple
linear superposition of the response of each normal mode, separately analysed, through the
procedure referred to as modal analysis. In cases where the time dependent functions of
Loads acting simultaneously are statistically independent of each other, an upper bound of
the total response may be estimated by a method denoted Square Root of Sum of Squares
(SRSS), and not by the very conservative linear sum of the maxima. If the structural analysis
is non-linear, as in Zeng et al. (2011), modal analysis is no longer valid and Collapse-Load
analysis, together with non-linear Transient analysis, is required.

As an example of Design Specifications for pressure- and force-bearing components, Table 1
shows the different Load Combinations corresponding to a part of the feed water system of
an internal pump BWR corresponding to Unit 1 of Forsmark Nuclear Power Plant (NPP). In
this table, some of the Load combinations appear to be identical but they actually differ in,
for instance, the pressure and/or temperature limits. For the sake of simplicity, this informa‐
tion has not been included in the table. It might be of some interest to point out that the Case
A17 corresponds to a combination of an earthquake from San Francisco, USA, and another
from Sweden, since the spectra of these earthquakes differ in the frequency content. This
Combination has a Plant Condition PC5 for the Swedish reality, for which a safe shutdown
of the reactor must be guaranteed.
Forsmark is the youngest Swedish NPP that became operational in 1980 with Unit 1 and
whose installed power was completed in 1985 with the start of Unit 3. This Unit and Unit 3
of Oskarshamn NPP were the last reactors to be built in Sweden. These two internal pump
reactors were designed at the end of the nineteen sixties and beginning of seventies, when
the first pocket calculators begun to invade the market. But these calculators were initially
quite expensive (Hewlett-Packard’s HP-35 cost $395 in 1972 which corresponds today to
more than $2000), forcing the structural analyses to the use of rather simplified rough mod‐
els, such as columns and beams subjected mainly to static loads, computed by means of
slide rules. Dynamical effects were considered using a quasi-static approach with adequate
safety margins (see e.g. Lahey and Moody, 1993), constituting the only feasible and realistic
conservative approach compatible with the existing algorithms and computer capacity of
the time. Nevertheless, thanks to the increased knowledge in the physics of single- and mul‐
ti-phase flows, to the development of numerical models for fluids and structures together
with the massive computing power through parallelization and low-price processers, me‐
chanical integrity analysis of Light Water Nuclear Reactors has, during the two last decades,
experienced a strong progress.
As discussed above, a nuclear reactor is designed for normal steady-state operation, for nor‐
mal changes such as start-up, shutdown, change in power level, etc., without going beyond
the design limits. In addition, the design must manage expected abnormal conditions and
postulated accidents. In this context and according to Lahey and Moody (1993), an accident
“is defined as a single event, not reasonably expected during the course of plant operation,
that has been hypothesized for analysis purposes or postulated from unlikely but possible
situations and that has the potential to cause a release of an unacceptable amount of radioac‐
tive material”. Consequently, a break in the reactor coolant system has to be considered an
accident whereas a fuel cladding tube damage is not.
Among postulated accidents, a group known as Anticipated Transients Without Scram
(ATWS), has a preferential status due to the interest that it has attracted since the end of the
nineteen seventies. It assumes the partial or total failure of the automatic control rod inser‐
tion (SCRAM). A total ATWS has a very low occurrence probability in the reactors of Fors‐
mark NPP. The total of about 170 control rods is divided into independent scram groups,
each served by a scram module and containing eight to ten control rods. A scram module
consists of a high-pressure nitrogen tank connected by a scram valve to another tank con‐

taining water to be pressurized by the nitrogen, water that may act on piston tubes for ac‐
complishing rapid insertion of control rods. It might be of some interest to point out that
similar scram systems successfully stopped units 2, 3, 4 and 7 of the Kashiwazaki-Kariwa
NPP in Japan at the beginning of the earthquake Chūetsu of July 16, 2007 (the remaining
units 1, 5 and 6 and were not operational due to refuelling outage). Still, Forsmark’s Units
have an independent system of boron injection for emergency stop of the reactors, which is
automated for Units 1 and 2 but still manual for Unit 3. Although the automation of this sys‐
tem, which was a Regulatory compliance, is not associated with safety issues, can, neverthe‐
less, lead to new thermal loads for the fuel and/or adjacent structures in the reactor core
(Tinoco et al., 2010a). As mentioned above, it is the duty of the owner or designee of the nu‐
clear facility to identify the Mechanical Loadings and/or their Combinations and establish
appropriate Limits. It is therefore necessary to analyse the effects of boron injection, a topic
to be discussed in somewhat more detail in Section 3 of this chapter.
The design basis accident of an external pump Boiling Water Reactor (BWR) consists of a
two-ended instantaneous circumferential break on the suction side of one of the main recir‐
culation lines, resulting in a discharge from both ends. In a BWR with internal pumps, this
postulated accident is not possible since there are no main recirculation lines. For an internal
pump BWR, there no longer exists a single design basis accident, but rather a series of acci‐
dents, whose consequences for safety and mechanical integrity are at least an order of mag‐
nitude smaller than the rupture of a main recirculation line. One of these accidents consists
of the two-ended instantaneous circumferential break of a steam line, which produces the
highest loads in the vessel and reactor internals. A similar break of a feedwater line will re‐
sult in lower Loads due to damping two-phase effects, in this case mainly from rapid boil‐
ing, i.e. flashing. Therefore, a design basis accident to be analysed for an internal pump
BWR is a steam line break that will be discussed in more detail in the following Section.
3. A steam line break
Until the mid-nineties, studies and analysis of the effects of a steam line break were mainly
based on experiments such as those of The Marviken Full Scale Critical Flow Tests (1979)
where the pressure vessel consisted of a cylindrical tank with no internal parts, filled only
with steam. For this reason, the only pressure waves considered in the loading analyses
were the alternating decompression and compression waves formed in the pipe segment
coupled to the cylindrical tank, between the break section and the coupling section to the
tank (see for example Laheyand Moody, 1993, pp. 498-501). Consequently, the Loads given
by the standard ANSI/ANS-58.2-1988, (ANSI/ANS, 1988), contain a component due to pres‐
sure waves of slightly over 30% of the product of the initial pressure of the cylindrical tank
times the area of the section break. That the presence of the concentric steam annulus be‐
tween the reactor vessel and the core shroud has an important part in the process of decom‐
pression by supporting standing pressure waves, (Tinoco, 2001), has been understood after
the CDF analysis to be briefly describe in what follows.

79

A three-dimensional numerical analysis of the rapid transient corresponding to the rupture
of the steam line (Tinoco, 2002) started in the late nineties with the purpose of obtaining the
time signal of the pressure inside the reactor pressure vessel and its internals, to be later
used in a structural time history analysis. This work was motivated as a part of the structur‐
al analysis related to replacement of the core grid of Units 1 and 2 of Forsmark NPP from the
original, fabricated by welded parts that had developed cracks in the welds, to a new manu‐
factured in one piece.
Historically, the three-dimensional numerical simulation of the fast transient was one of the
first successes in this area of thermal-hydraulics. This was due to several factors that al‐
lowed an analysis with relatively limited computational resources, namely a negligible ef‐
fect of turbulence, single-phase treatment due to flashing delay and the lack of importance
of friction allowing relatively coarse mesh (see Tinoco, 2002).

dryers (down to water surface) after steam line break: 9 ms (upper view), 20 ms (central view) and 100 ms (lower
view), (c) Simplified FEM model of the reactor with containment building, (d) detailed FEM model of the reactor with
core grid in red.
Figure 3 shows in (a) an image of the reactor with the water surface indicated by a blue line.
In (b) this figure shows a sequence of views of the pressure on the inner surface of the nu‐
merical model CFD ("Computational Fluid Dynamics") model (Tinoco, 2002), containing the
steam dome, the annular region of steam and steam dryers. The steam separators, located
under the dryers were modelled together as a single barrel without details. The first view of
the sequence corresponds to 9.2 ms after the break, where the decompression wave extends
with a single front symmetrically with respect to the axis of the steam nozzle, on whose out‐
er end the line break is assumed to be located. The second view corresponds to 20.2 ms after
the break, showing a picture of a less ordered and more chaotic pressure field due to reflec‐
tions with different parts of the complex geometry of the reactor vessel. The third view cor‐
responds to 100 ms from the break, displaying a more simplified image of the pressure than

in the previous view, due mainly to the general decompression of the reactor that has almost
homogenised the dome pressure. Image (c) shows a general view of the low-resolution
structural analysis FEM model, including the containment building. Image (d) shows a view
of the high-resolution FEM model of the reactor.
A structural analysis was performed using both models because, due to the rupture of the
steam line, there is an effect, external to the reactor vessel, on the reactor containment build‐
ing, not considered in Tinoco (2002) since it only treats internal effects. The analysis was
conducted using the method of direct time integration, (Hermansson and Thorsson, 1997).
The time signals of the loads were applied to the structures and, as a result, response spectra
were generated for the different structures. A response spectrum is a graph of the maximal
response (displacement, velocity or acceleration) of a linear oscillatory system (elastic struc‐
ture) forced to move by a vibrational excitation or pulse (shock). Figure 4 shows in (a) two
time signals of load components in the direction of the axis of the steam nozzle with the line
break, acting on a node located in the core grid. The lower value corresponds to that com‐
puted directly by the CFD model. The higher, amplified value takes into account the effect
of the second end of the break, which is connected to the adjacent steam line (Hermansson
and Thorsson, 1997). Due to this connection in pairs of the steam lines, the reactor vessel is
also decompressed, with a certain delay, through the contiguous steam nozzle. In (b),Figure
4 shows the smoothed envelope spectra in the direction of the axis of the steam nozzle with
the line break, corresponding to the same node. It might be of same interest to reiterate that
the loads applied in this analysis are about twice the loads according to standard ANSI/
ANS-58.2-1988, (ANSI/ANS,1988), due to an effect of resonance of pressure waves in the
steam annulus (Tinoco, 2001).

4. The problem of mixing
Mixing the same fluid with different properties like temperature or concentration, or with
different phases like steam and water, or even different fluids, is a far from trivial industrial
CFD as a Tool for the Analysis of the Mechanical Integrity of Light Water Nuclear Reactors

81

problem. The process involved in the operation of Light Water Reactors contains many sit‐
uations where mixing is of crucial importance like the mixing of reactor water and feedwa‐
ter in BRWs, the mixing needed to regulate boron concentration in PWRs, etc. Yet, a high
degree of mixing between the originally rather segregated components may be a hard task
or, depending on the space and time scales of the mixing process, a complete mixing may
even be impossible without special mixing devices. For instance, specially designed spacers
in the nuclear fuel are needed to enhance the turbulent heat transport, and mixers are used
to avoid thermal fatigue due to temperature fluctuations when flows with different temper‐
atures meet within a tee-junction.
All these situations relay on turbulent mixing that, according to Dimotakis (2005), “can be
viewed as a three-stage process of entrainment, dispersion (or stirring), and diffusion,
spanning the full spectrum of space-time scales of the flow”. The mixing level, or quality of
mixing, may be estimated, according to Brodkey (1967), through two parameters. The first
parameter is the scale of segregation that gives a measure of the size of the unmixed lumps
of the original components, i.e. a measure of the spreading of one component within the
other. A length scale or a volume scale, analogous to the integral scales of turbulence, may
be defined based on the Eulerian autocorrelation function of the concentration. Since the
scale of segregation provides a measure of the extent of the region over which concentra‐
tions are appreciably correlated, it constitutes a good assess of the large-scale (turbulence-
controlled eddy break-up) process, but not of the small scale (diffusion-controlled) process.
The second is the intensity of segregation, given by the one-point concentration variance
normalised with its initial value. It constitutes a measure of the concentration difference be‐
tween neighbouring lumps of fluid, i.e. it describes the effect of molecular diffusion on the
mixing process.
But, according to Kukukova et al. (2009), a general, objective and complete definition of mix‐
ing, or of its opposite, segregation, needs a third parameter, or dimension, as the authors of
the reference express it, namely the exposure or the potential to reduce segregation. This
rate of change of segregation associated to a time scale of mixing, combines the strength of
the interaction, in this case the turbulent diffusivity, the concentration gradients and the
contact area between components. Therefore, good mixing characterized by a small scale of
segregation and a low intensity of segregation may be achieved if the mixing process is con‐
tained within the exposure time scale, i.e. for adequately high exposure.
However, many design problems of light water reactors that have arisen during their opera‐
tion, originate from overconfidence about the mixing properties of turbulence. A classic ex‐
ample is that of the mixing of feedwater and reactor water in the downcomer of a BWR, in
connection with Hydrogen Water Chemistry (HWC) to mitigate Intergranular Stress Corro‐
sion Cracking (IGSCC) of sensitized stainless steel. The injection of reducing hydrogen gas
to the feedwater was intended for recombination with oxidizing radicals contained in the re‐
actor water and produced by radiolysis, through a turbulence-induced, optimal mixing in
the downcomer. Surprisingly, the recombination effect for Units 1 and 2 of Forsmark NPP
was not in proportion to the amount of injected hydrogen and the only solution appeared to
be a major increase in the addition rate of hydrogen. But, in 1992, a very primitive and
Nuclear Reactor Thermal Hydraulics and Other Applications
82

rough CFD model of an octant (45º) of the downcomer (Hemström et al., 1992) indicated
that the flow field and the mixing were rather complex and highly tree-dimensional, leaving
the regions between feedwater spargers with practically no mixing, and that buoyancy os‐
tensibly aggravated the mixing issue. The poor mixing in the downcomer of Units 1 and 2 of
Forsmark NPP arose from the design of the core shroud cover that, radially and freely over
its entire perimeter, directed the warmer reactor water coming from the steam separators in‐
to the downcomer. Owing to the limited azimuthal extent of the four feedwaterspargers,
four vertical regions without direct injection of colder feedwater were established in the
downcomer. Due to buoyancy combined with mass conservation, the colder and falling re‐
gions contracted azimuthally, making the warmer and slower regions to expand. Turbu‐
lence acted within the colder regions, tending rather effectively to achieve temperature
homogeneity, and at the boundary areas between the warmer and colder regions. The trans‐
it time of the vertical flow in the downcomer was not long enough for turbulence to achieve
a complete temperature homogenization of the recirculation water. In other words, the tur‐
bulent diffusivity, the temperature gradients and the contact surfaces between cold and
warm water were not large enough to achieve a good mixing, i.e. the exposure was too low.
The mixing was achieved further downstream in two main steps, namely by forcing cold
and warm water to meet within the inlet pumps, at the bottom of the downcomer, and by
rotating agitation within the remnant vortexes at the pump outlets, produced by the Main
Recirculation Pumps (MRP). This mixing process is quite effective, leaving only less than 3
% difference in temperature (Tinoco and Ahlinder, 2009) but for HWC, this homogeneity
comes too late in the process since radiation at the level of the core in the downcomer is
needed for triggering recombination of oxygen with hydrogen.
Finally, the problem of poor mixing in the downcomer was significantly reduced by modify‐
ing the design of the core shroud cover. Cylindrical-vertical walls were placed at the edge of
the cover in the azimuthal locations facing the regions between spargers in order to com‐
pletely block the reactor water flow. Radial flow out of the cover was allowed only regions
in front of the spargers. This design was first tested in a rather advanced CFD model (Ahlin‐
der et al., 2007), used to investigate HWC. The results obtained showed a higher degree of
recombination with the modified core shroud. However, the decisive factor in the recombi‐
nation was the level of radiation absorbed by the water in the downcomer, indicating that
an effective recombination might not be possible over the complete fuel cycle without a
modified core design. For a couple of years ago, this shroud cover design was implemented
in Units 1 and 2 of Forsmark NPP, as a step in the modernisation and improvement of the
process and safety to cope with a programmed power uprate. HWC was not carried out due
to the aforementioned core design issue but an improved mixing in the downcomer has oth‐
er advantages like minimizing the risk of cavitation in the MRPs.
The most complete CFD model including for the first time rotating MRPs was developed in
2008 (Tinoco and Ahlinder, 2009) for studying thermal mixing in an internal pump BWR.
Figure 5 shows in (a) once more the view of the reactor as a reference, and in (b) it shows a
view of the geometry involved in the CFD model that is limited from above by the free wa‐
ter surface. The model includes the downcomer (the water annular region between the inner

surface of the reactor and the outer surface of the core shroud), the MRPs (4 pumps for this
half of the reactor) and the lower plenum with the guide tubes of the control rods which ex‐
tend to the entrance of the core reactor. In (c) a MRP is shown in more detail and in (d) the
lower plenum, also in more detail. The complete CFD model contains slightly more than 25
million cells to represent the included part of the reactor. The correct flow through the mod‐
el is achieved by rotating the pumps to the adequate rotational speed for normal operation.
The thermodynamic properties of water as a function of pressure and temperature have
been included in the physical properties of the studied fluid, allowing with that the analysis
of the mixing of warmer recirculation water with cooler feed water. The results indicate a
substantial mixing at the lower plenum inlet, being the maximum difference in the tempera‐
ture of water entering the reactor core of about 2.5 ºC (see Tinoco and Ahlinder, 2009). This
model may be used in the future to analyse the mixing of boron injected to the reactor with
the surrounding water, as suggested below.
Figure 5. (a) View of the reactor; (b) Model of the Downcomer, MR Pumps and Lower Plenum limited from above by
the free water surface; (c) Model of MR Pump with diffuser vanes; (d) Lower Plenum detail with control rod guide
tubes.
Originally, this CFD model consisted of two separated sub-models linked by boundary con‐
ditions at a common surface constituted by the Lower Plenum Inlet, since this split was geo‐
metrically and computationally optimal. The Lower Plenum Inlet is constituted by
cylindrical-rectangular openings located almost directly downstream of the MRP outlets
equipped with diffuser vanes. Even if these diffuser vanes recover an important amount of
the mechanical energy stored in the rotation of the flow imparted by the pump, a vortex is
still formed with a significant downstream extension, being this vortex responsible for an
appreciable part of the thermal mixing. The use of a surface, as outlet for the first sub-model
and as inlet for the second sub-model, to transfer the information of the flow behaviour
from one sub-model to the other is not adequate. The information corresponding to the dif‐
Nuclear Reactor Thermal Hydraulics and Other Applications

ferent fields is correctly transferred but no information about the field tendencies, i.e. the
different gradients, reaches the second sub-model. In this case, the further development of
the vortices coming from the pumps is corrupted beyond the inlets of the second sub-model.
The result is a rather strong underestimation of the thermal mixing, predicting temperature
differences of the order of 10 %, (see Tinoco and Ahlinder, 2009), temperature differences
that have never been detected by measurements or, indirectly, by contingent fuel damage.
The analysis of the different turbulence parameters objectively endorses this difference in
mixing, which leads to the only reasonable recommendation of using a larger and computa‐
tionally heavier model but right from the point of view of the physics of the flow. Model
separations in CFD simulations, similar to the one described above, will deliver proper re‐
sults only if the different gradients associated with the flow are small or negligible, other‐
wise a finite, common, transition volume is needed. This type of coupling between two CFD
models might be difficult to achieve in rather standard commercial codes.
By Regulatory compliance, the safety system for the injection of boron to achieve an emer‐
gency stop of the reactor in case of an ATWS is now automatically operated in Units 1 and 2.
Due to the automation, the accidental or programmed injection of boron will be associated
with a set of new cases of postulated accidents that have to be analysed. Since the injection
of boron in these Units is done in only two points, closely and not symmetrically located in
the upper downcomer, the probability of an inhomogeneous distribution of boron, especial‐
ly at the entrance of the core, is very high, as a preliminary study using a reduced model
containing only the downcomer indicates (Tinoco et al., 2010a). This situation may lead to
rapid variations in space and time of the reactivity of the core that might result in local max‐
ima of thermal power that could ultimately damage the fuel and/or adjacent structures. The
CFD simulations of boron injection and its mixing with the reactor water have to be linked
to three-dimensional simulations of the neutron kinetics of the reactor core in order to cor‐
rectly capture the physics of these thermal power variations.
5. Heat transfer
Turbulent thermal mixing implies, of course, transfer of heat from the warmer compo‐
nent, or fluid, to the colder component, resulting in a tendency to temperature and en‐
thalpy  homogenization.  But,  depending  on  the  geometry  of  the  thermal  system,  the
process towards homogenization may have a rather well defined composition that in‐
volves the system boundaries which, in general, correspond to solid structures. These
structures interact thermally with the fluid or fluids involved in the thermal mixing proc‐
ess, being the composition of the process decisive for the behaviour of the structures. Ac‐
cording to the viewpoint of this work, the composition of the thermal mixing process
includes firstly the morphology of the turbulent flow involved, i.e. the flow geometry, the
eddy structure, the presence of stable boundary layers, etc. Secondly, it includes the ther‐
mophysical properties of the fluid and the thermophysical and geometrical properties of
the solid boundaries. Depending on the composition of the thermal mixing process, the
solid boundaries may or may not be exposed to the problem of high-cycle thermal fati‐
CFD as a Tool for the Analysis of the Mechanical Integrity of Light Water Nuclear Reactors

85

gue. Therefore, the composition of the thermal mixing process, as defined above, implies
the analysis of the complete system, including the solid boundaries, i.e. the type of heat
transfer which is denoted as conjugate heat transfer, with rather advanced requirements
regarding comprehensive information of the turbulent flow involved. The aforementioned
concepts discussed so far will be emphasized through a slightly different analysis of the
paradigm of thermal mixing and fatigue, i.e. the tee-junction.
5.1. Thermal mixing in a tee-junction
This exemplar of thermal mixing has been and is still being extensively studied, both experi‐
mentally and numerically, as the work of Naik-Nimbalkar et al. (2010) confirms with a rath‐
er wide, but not absolutely comprehensive, review of the literature about the subject.
Probably the review should be completed by mentioning the experimental work of Hosseini
et al.(2008) about the classification of the branch jet flow and about the structure of the flow
field (Hosseini et al., 2009). Also other publications not included in the aforementioned re‐
view, (Muramatsu, 2003, Ogawa et al., 2005, Westin et al., 2008, OECD/NEA, 2011), that are
experimental or including an experimental part for validation of a numerical simulation, in‐
vestigate the bulk flow structures of the mixing in a tee-junction. All the references men‐
tioned in this Subsection, and many others not included due to lack of space, have, as the
main motivation, the purpose of studying, understanding and eventually controlling the
wall temperature fluctuations associated with thermal fatigue. Particularly the reference
OECD/NEA (2011), which is a rather major effort to validate numerical simulations of the
thermal mixing in a tee-junction, clearly proclaims: “In T-junctions, where hot and cold
streams join and mix (though often not completely), significant temperature fluctuations can
be created near the walls. The wall temperature fluctuations can cause cyclical thermal stresses
which may induce fatigue cracking”. But none of these references presents temperature or ve‐
locity data of the wall near region, i.e. the boundary layers, or of temperature at the walls.
Even worse, the solid walls are never involved in any measurements, although it is the
propagation of temperature fluctuations from the surface and inside the solid that may lead
to fatigue cracking.
The reason for the absence of this crucial part of the mixing matter may be the great difficul‐
ty in measuring very close to walls and within the walls. For instance, velocity measure‐
ments in a thin boundary layer with Lase Doppler Velocimetry (LDV) are biased by even
small density differences in the fluid, and temperature measurements within the solid are
intrusive, cannot be relocated and may lead to errors due to contact continuity. But, in situa‐
tions when temperature may be considered as a passive scalar, i.e. relatively small tempera‐
ture differences not affecting the flow, the velocity measurements may be carried out in
isothermal conditions. Since measurements of this kind have been done in this and other sit‐
uations, to be reported in what follows, the true reason for the absence of this type of meas‐
urements in the study of tee-junction flows may be lack of knowledge about how vital the
information related to temperature fluctuations close to the wall and within the wall is for
understanding and being able to estimate the risk for wall thermal fatigue in a specific case.
Of course, the information about flow behaviour close to the wall is directly related to the
Nuclear Reactor Thermal Hydraulics and Other Applications
86

behaviour of the flow in the bulk, but the physical properties of fluid and the physical and
geometrical properties of the wall will also affect the near wall flow, as the next paragraphs
of this Subsection will describe. In other words, the problem of turbulent thermal mixing in
a tee-junction is a process with a well-defined composition that has to be solved in its whole‐
ness, i.e. a conjugate heat transfer problem.
As the preceding discussion reveals, measurements of the temperature fluctuations due to
heat transfer within the boundary layer of a fluid close a wall and/or within the solid wall
are very scarce. The work of de Tilly et al., (2006), de Tilly and Sousa (2008a) and de Tilly
and Sousa (2008b) deals with the development of a multi-thermocouple planar probe of di‐
mensions of the order of 300 μm to measure the instantaneous values of the wall heat flux in
a boundary layer. Preliminary results of the wall heat flux have been obtained for the boun‐
dary layer flow developing downstream of a two-dimensional tee-junction. Even if this de‐
vice is very promising, some questions arise from these tests, namely how to check the
accuracy of the measurements with an independent method, how to handle thinner boun‐
dary layers than the instrument and how to deal with three-dimensional flow. In any event,
this novel concept deserves a positive and successful development as a significant contribu‐
tion to a difficult but important subject.
The measurements reported by Mosyak et al. (2001) seem to move this discussion away
from the trail of wall temperature fluctuations and the risk of fatigue cracking since this ref‐
erence treats the subject of constant heat flux boundary condition in heat transfer from the
solid walls of channel flow. However, the experimental data substantiate the analytically
demonstrated fact (Polyakov, 1974) that temperature fluctuations near a wall differ for dif‐
ferent combinations of fluid and solid in conjugate heat transfer problems. Also Direct Nu‐
merical Simulations (DNS) of conjugate heat transfer (Tiselj et al., 2001, Tiselj et al., 2004,
Tiselj, 2011) corroborate this information, where the governing parameters of the fluid-solid
combination 
are 
the 
wall 
thickness 
dw, 
the

activity 
ratio
K = (ρ ⋅cp ⋅λ) f / (ρ ⋅cp ⋅λ)w and the ratio of thermal diffusivities G =αf / αw. Here, ρ is the
density, cp the isobaric specific heat, λ the thermal conductivity and α =λ / (ρ ⋅cp) the ther‐
mal diffusivity. The sub-indices f and w indicate respectively “fluid” and “wall”. Depending
on the values of dw and K, two asymptotic limits of the conjugate turbulent heat transfer ex‐
ist at the same Reynolds and Prandtl numbers and at the same wall heat flux. When K → 0
and dw> 0, the turbulent temperature fluctuations do not penetrate the wall and the wall
temperature does not fluctuate. When K → ∞, dw is of no importance, the turbulent tempera‐
ture fluctuations do penetrate the wall and the wall temperature does fluctuate. In a particu‐
lar solid-fluid case with given K and dw, the wall temperature behaviour will be between
these two limiting cases, as may be observed through the results of Tiselj et al. (2001), given
in Figure 6.
The results displayed in Figure 6 are not completely general since they have been obtained
for G =1, as Tiselj and Cizelj (2012) point out, while Pr≈0.9, K ≈0.2  and G ≈0.04  for water
and stainless steel at the pressure and temperature conditions of a BWR. Nonetheless, the
main conclusion of these results is that, despite the large spectrum of temperature fluctua‐

87

tion variations as functions of the aforementioned material and geometrical parameters, the
heat transfer rate for the limiting case K = ∞ is only 1 % higher than that for the other limit‐
ing case K = 0. The reason for this coincidence is the fact that the heat transfer rate is associ‐
ated with the mean temperature gradient, which is very similar in both cases. These are
good news for the heat exchanger designers, but the large spectrum of temperature fluctua‐
tion variations is bad news for the nuclear and other designers responsible for the mechani‐
cal integrity of solid structures.

The value G =1  associated with the results of Tiselj et al. (2001) shown in Figure 6, implies
that the scale y++ ≡ y+, d++ ≡ d+ since y++ = Gy+, a scale used for the results of Figure 6. Tiselj
and Cizelj (2012) mention that this scale has an uncertain meaning and should be aban‐
doned. Also, smaller values than G =1 will probably lead to lower temperature fluctuations
inside the wall, as the results of Tiselj and Cizelj (2012) indicate, but for Pr=0.01. According
to Figure 6, an increase in the Prandtl number will further decrease, though moderately, the
temperature fluctuations inside the wall. The conclusion of Tiselj and Cizelj (2012) is that, for
the combination liquid sodium-stainless steel (K ≈1, G ≈10), the results indicate a relative
high penetration of turbulent temperature fluctuations into the simulated heated wall.

The lower values of the parameters for the combination water-stainless steel of BWR suggest
that the penetration of turbulent temperature fluctuations in walls will be rather low under
the conditions investigated through DNS simulations of channel flow. But, in other circum‐
stances such as tee-junctions or control rod stems, which will be discussed in the next Sub‐
section, the temperature fluctuations seem to be large enough to cause damage through
thermal fatigue. It seems apparent that further investigation is needed to elucidate the wall
behaviour in cases where no stable boundary layers are built and large structures coming
from the bulk flow may strongly interact thermally with the walls. A first step in this direc‐
tion has been taken by van Haren (2011), where a DNS of a tee-junction has been carried out.
Unfortunately, only very preliminary results have been reported since, due to high comput‐
er requirements, the run-time was not enough to obtain a statistically stationary and con‐
verged solution.
Hopefully, the preceding discussion has made clear that the problem of thermal fatigue
induced by flow temperature fluctuations is a conjugate heat transfer problem, i.e. a heat
transfer problem of the specific combination fluid-wall. More knowledge is needed to un‐
derstand the aforementioned interaction between large structures generated in the bulk
flow and the walls. This knowledge should be obtained primarily by experiments but fur‐
ther difficulties with temperature measurements should be added to those already men‐
tioned, i.e. intrusive, non-relocatable and contact continuity problems. For instance, the
specificity of the combination fluid-wall questions the use in an experimental facility of
Plexiglas or other material than the precise of the prototype to be investigated. Even the
conditions of the experiment should match those of the prototype since they affect the dif‐
ferent  material  parameters  that  ultimate  influence  the  thermal  fluctuations.  Intrusive
measurements have to be done with material properties matching those already men‐
tioned of the walls, not only thermal conductivity. For instance, at the FATHERINO 2 fa‐
cility at CEA Cadarache, briefly described by Kuhn et al. (2010), a thin brass mock-up
(“Skin of Fluid Mock-up”) has been developed to visualize, by infrared thermography,
the mean and fluctuating temperature fields at the interface of the fluid and the wall. This
mock-up may only have relevance as a case for validating numerical simulations, as it is
used by Kuhn et al. (2010), but more knowledge is needed about the correct conditions, to
be discussed below, for simulating the wall heat transfer, including the right distribution
of temperature fluctuations within the wall.
Numerical simulations of conjugate heat transfer including temperature fluctuations inside
the solid structure other than DNS have already been carried out using diverse approaches.
The previously mentioned reference, Kuhn et al. (2010), uses a LES approach to resolve the
flow and temperature fields inside the fluid for two cases, namely a thin-wall brass model
and a thick-wall steel model. The results show relatively large differences between models
in both the mean temperature fields and the distribution of temperature fluctuations inside
the solids. This is attributed only to the heat conduction in the thicker wall, apparently both
radial and axial, with no further analysis of other possible reasons, i.e. nothing is comment‐
ed about the different combinations fluid-solid. From the numerical point of view several
questions arise, firstly the fact that the same grid is used for the two walls. Secondly, y+ may

89

be up to 5 in the mixing region when requirements in LES of channel flow, for less than 1 %
difference in heat transfer rate with DNS results, are y+ = 0.5, x+ = 30 (streamwise) and z+ = 10
(spanwise), according to Carlsson and Veber (2010). In Kuhn et al. (2010) nothing is men‐
tioned about the grid resolution in the streamwise and/or spanwise directions. However, a
validation like that of Carlsson and Veber (2010) about the distribution of temperature fluc‐
tuations has not yet been carried out, a situation that sheds some doubts about the accuracy
of the results obtained in Kuhn et al. (2010) and, for the rest, of the results obtained with any
other methods different from DNS.
A brief and definitely incomplete review of other approaches reveals the use of LES with
thermal wall functions (Châtelain et al., 2003). The results show that the temperature fluctu‐
ations in the vicinity of the wall and inside the wall can be highly underestimated a fact that
is corroborated by Pasutto et al. (2006) and Jayaraju et al. (2010). Also some attempts have
been done with the RANS approach, with varied results (Keshmiri, 2006, Tinoco and
Lindqvist, 2009, Tinocoet al., 2010b, Craft et al., 2010), and with the more unconventional La‐
grangian approach of Pozorski and Minier (2005). The majority of the numerical results dis‐
cussed in this Subsection are waiting for an experimental validation, or numerical by DNS,
in order to be able to establish the correct methodology to be used in future simulations for
estimating the risk of thermal fatigue.
5.2. The control rod issue
Broken control rods and rods with cracks were found in the twin reactors Oskarshamn 3
and Forsmark 3 in the fall of 2008.As a part of an extensive damage investigation, time de‐
pendent CFD simulations of the flow and the heat transfer in the annular region formed by
the guide tube and control rod stem were carried out with a model containing 9 million
computational cells (Tinoco and Lindqvist, 2009). Due to limitations in time and computer
resources, only a quadrant of the guide tube and control rod with an axial length of approxi‐
mately 1 m was included in the model, as Figure 7 shows. Also an Unsteady RANS (UR‐
ANS) approach with the SST k-ω model was chosen for handling turbulence.
Figure 7. CAD view (left) and drawing of a part of the CFD model used inTinoco and Lindqvist (2009).
In this figure, where gravity is from right to left in the right view, the different mass flow
rates per quadrant are indicated with their temperatures by arrows. The upper bypass inlet
(right) divides its mass flow rate into two holes of14.6 mm in diameter, resulting in inlet ve‐

locities of about 10 m/s. The lower bypass inlet has only one hole of 8 mm in diameter that
connects to an annular channel before the flow is delivered with relatively low velocity to
the annular region between control rod stem and guide tube.
Figure 8. Temperature sequence showing a large scale variation of the surface temperature of the control rod stem
with a period of ~15 seconds (temperatures in K).
Figure 8 shows a typical time sequence, from left to right and in two rows, of the surface
temperature of the control rod stem with a large scale variation with a frequency of approxi‐
mately 0.07 Hz. Three horizontal planes are shown in the views, namely the upper plane
corresponding to the lower bypass inlet, the middle plane corresponding approximately to
the region of the break (10 cm below the lower bypass inlet) and the lower plane corre‐
sponding approximately to the end of the inlet region of the cold crud-cleaning flow (20 cm
below the lower bypass inlet). These simulations together with metallurgical and structural
analyses indicated that the cracks were initiated by thermal fatigue.
The results of the damage investigation were accepted by the Swedish Nuclear Regulatory
Authorities for a reactor restart with new control rods. Meanwhile, further studies had to be
accomplished to clarify some remaining matters. One of the contested issues concerned the
validity and accuracy of the CFD simulations. Consequently, new CFD models, (Tinoco et
al., 2010b), were developed in conformity with the guidelines of Casey and Wintergerste
(2000) and Menter (2002), while the URANS approach with the SST k-ω model was pre‐
served, and validation experiments were carried out. The largest CFD model contained 16.8
million cells because large effort was put into maintaining a value of y+~ 1 for the dynamic
mesh resolution in the near wall region of the control rod stem at the level of the mixing
area. Validation tests had indicated that a y+ close to 1 is a necessary condition to ensure suf‐
ficiently accurate heat transfer results (Tinoco et al., 2010b), but no control was done about
the values of x+ and z+ since the results of Carlsson and Veber (2010) were at that time not

91

known. Figure 9 shows the low y+ values for the grid at the stem wall in the mixing region
indicated by the horizontal black line for different times of the simulation.
Figure 9. Grid y+ adjacent to the control rod wall at different times of the simulation.
Figure 10 shows in the upper view a sequence of colour pictures representing the velocity
magnitude, maximized to 1 m/s (red scale ≥ 1 m/s), in a vertical plane bisecting the quadrant
and containing the region below the jets of the upper bypass inlet. The pictures are com‐
pletely symmetric since the original data of the quadrant have been mirrored with respect to
vertical axis. In this sequence, it is possible to observe many structures forming and moving
downwards, towards the lower bypass inlet, in the annular region between the stem and the
guide tube. In this view, the black line indicating the level of the stem weld corresponds to
the level of plane 7 shown in the middle view.
The middle view depicts five time signals of the axial vertical velocity component of the fluid at
radially 2 mm from the stem wall. The points are located in plane 7 (blue line in left reference
picture) at 5 different azimuthal positions. The signals indicate large vertical intermittent
movements downwards, with speeds of the order of 1 m/s and frequencies of 0.1-0.2 Hz which
corroborate the impression given by the pictures of the upper view. This is the dynamical
mechanism of the mixing responsible for the thermal fatigue of the control rod stems. This ef‐
fect has been further confirmed by simulations of guide tubes without the upper bypass inlet,
reported in Tinoco and Lindqvist (2009), where no such structures are present.
The lower view shows the thermal consequences of the above described dynamical process
that transports large lumps of warm fluid downwards with relatively large velocities. The
maxima of the temperature time signal correlate well with the minima of the axial vertical
velocity component. The fact that the temperature signal (in blue) corresponds to only one
single fluid point indicates that the lumps of warm fluid cover a large part of the annular
gap modelled in the quadrant. This view also shows the temperature signal of two points
located inside the solid, namely the first located radially at 0.5 mm from the stem outer wall
Nuclear Reactor Thermal Hydraulics and Other Applications
92

(in green) and the second located radially at 2 mm from the wall (in red). In this graph, it is
possible to observe that, compared to the fluid signal, both solid signals are damped, with
high frequency variations filtered out. Also, the red signal is not always smaller than the
green indicating switches in the direction of the heat flux.

velocity component of the fluid in plane 7 (blue line in left reference picture) at 2 mm from the stem wall and for 5

However, the central question is still the quality of these simulations. Is a URANS simula‐
tion with good spatial and time resolutions enough to capture both the flow field and the
heat transfer correctly? The author is tempted to answer with a “yes” but a more objective
answer should be “probably”. If the resolutions are adequate, the URANS approach based
on SST k-ω model seems to work properly for cases with high enough Reynolds numbers
and turbulent flow containing large perturbations. Furthermore, the comparison with ex‐
periments shown in Figure 11 exhibits a rather good agreement for mean temperature and
temperature fluctuation distributions along a vertical line 1 mm apart from the stem wall.
Incidentally, the material properties in the experiment are those of the prototype. Unfortu‐
nately, no comparisons of the velocity and velocity fluctuation fields were done but it is dif‐
ficult to think that the agreement in the temperature fields shown in Figure 11 may be
achieved with a radically different velocity field to that of the experiments.
Figure 11. Comparison with the steel model experimental data (see Angele et al., 2011); left: mean temperature;
right: temperature fluctuations (rms-value).
Then, are the simulated temperature fluctuations inside the solid stem also correct? This
question is more difficult to answer since no experimental validation has been carried out
but indirect indications about some properties of these fluctuations have nonetheless been
obtained. Some of these properties are the order of magnitude of the most energy-contain‐
ing frequencies of the temperature fluctuations at stem wall and of the associated heat
transfer coefficients. Structural analyses (see e.g. Forsmarks Kraftgrupp, 2009) using this
range of frequencies, together with the large temperature amplitudes and velocities of the
order of 1 m/s, show that this kind of heat transfer is associated with the initiation of cracks
on the stem surface. Moreover, the analyses also show that the time scale of the crack de‐
velopment that resulted in broken control rod stems is consistent both with the geometry of
the stem (hollow welded joining; see Tinoco and Lindqvist, 2009) and the thermal loadings
arising from the heat transfer process described by the CFD simulations. In general, the re‐
Nuclear Reactor Thermal Hydraulics and Other Applications
94

sults of the structural analyses based on the aforementioned CFD-simulated conditions are
consistent with the damage picture obtained by inspection. Using more “conservative” con‐
ditions, e.g. higher heat transfer coefficients, leads to unrealistic short time scales of the
damage.
Furthermore, the mathematical and physical consistency of the temperature field inside the
stem has been demonstrated by solving of the Inverse Heat Conduction Problem (IHCP),
(Taler et al., 2011). The IHCP is defined as the determination of the boundary conditions of
the problem from transient temperature histories given at one or more interior locations.
The IHCP is a so called ill-posed problem, i.e. any small change on the input data can result
in a dramatic change of the solution. By giving CFD-computed time signals of the tempera‐
ture at selected points inside the stem, the temperature signal and the heat flux at the sur‐
face of the stem were recovered with good accuracy. The question that remains is the
correctness of the temperature fluctuations at the surface of the stem, i.e. the correctness of
the thermal interaction between the solid surface and the near wall region of the fluid. A
definite answer can only be obtained by experimental validation or DNS.
Summing up, further structural analyses based on the same CFD-computed conditions have
led to a set of measures that have been taken and/or are being implemented. The crud-clean‐
ing flow has been modified to deliver a flow with a temperature of up to 100 ºC instead of
the original of 60 ºC. After turning, a control rod stem may acquire surface tensile residual
stress which increases the risk of crack initiation. In order to counteract this undesirable ef‐
fect, all control rod stems are now burnished since this procedure creates surface compres‐
sive residual stress that increases the resistance of the stem against damage, i.e. increased
protection against crack initiation and crack growth. At locations of the core most exposed
to high warm bypass flows, a better material, stainless steel XM-19, has been chosen for the
stems of the control rods. Only 50 of the 169 control rods will keep stems of a somewhat
poorer material, stainless steel 316L. In the fuel outage of year 2014, all control rods will be
tested in order to detect the presence of cracks and, based on the existent experience at that
time, a renewed test program will be decided. This set of measures has been conceived as a
viable alternative to the very expensive option of eliminating the cause of the mixing prob‐
lem by changing the design of the control rod guide tubes comprising a new location of the
upper bypass inlet.
6. Conclusion
This chapter constitutes a partial view of CFD, both in the sense of limited and favouring,
since, for instance, the examples concerning BWR applications are overrepresented and im‐
portant subjects such as nuclear safety and two-phase flows are left aside. As a kind of de‐
fence, it may be argued that the methods used for BWRs are valid, in general, for PWRs and,
probably with important modifications, for SuperCritical Water Reactors (SCWRs). As far as
CFD in nuclear safety is concerned, the high interest and large amount of work in the subject
from, among others, the European Commission, (European Commission, 2005), and the U.S.

Department of Energy, Idaho National Laboratory, (Johnson et al., 2006), make and analysis
and a review of the subject rather superfluous.
As pointed out by Tinoco et al. (2010c), two-phase flow simulations still have a relatively
high degree of uncertainty and they have not reached the level of quality of single-phase
simulations. The physics involved in two-phase phenomena is still not well understood, due
mainly to the measuring difficulties entailed by the requirement of local knowledge of the
processes needed in CFD. Consequently, the models available lack the distinctive prediction
capability of CFD because they are usually based on information collected as relatively gen‐
eral correlations. A fundamental example is the experimental lack of knowledge about the
modification by boiling of the detailed structure of a boundary layer at a wall. This deficien‐
cy leads to wrong predictions of flow resistance and void distribution in, for instance, pipe
flow with boiling from the walls.
Another topic that has not been mentioned in this work is the field of acoustic perturbations
in the reactor system, especially in the parts corresponding to pipe networks. The problem
of flow-induced structural resonances has become more topical due to the increased interest
in operating the reactors at uprated power output. The new components and/or the in‐
creased flow rates necessary for achieving the upgrade may lead to the generation of pres‐
sure waves that may excite structural vibration modes and increase the risk of mechanical
fatigue. CFD may be used to analyse the pipe-network system if the geometry is realistically
represented, the grid has a suitable resolution, the turbulence model is appropriate and, in
the case of steam, compressibility is included (Lirvat et al., 2012). Post-processing of the gen‐
erated data can provide information about the flow induced excitation modes, the source of
the excitation frequencies/modes and possible standing pressure waves. In the past, at‐
tempts have been carried out to collect acoustic signals generated in complex systems like a
nuclear reactor in order to detect possible deviations from normal operation of the different
components. Any success has failed to turn up not due to the process of acquiring the data,
which is relatively easy, but to the difficulties in interpreting the signal constituted by the
superposition of broadcasted pressure waves from every component that may act as a
source. In the future, CFD might help identifying the sources and describing how the differ‐
ent pressure waves propagate in the system. Perhaps, detecting the leakage of valves in
complex systems like a nuclear reactor by means of acoustic signals may become possible.
As usual when trying to solve a problem, more questions than those initially asked arise
during the solution process. The case of the control rod cracks in no exception and, as men‐
tioned before, the apparent success of the URANS simulations with the SST k-ω model rais‐
es several questions, namely if this is the merit of the model, and at which Reynolds
numbers the URANS approach begins to work, if the associate heat transfer, including tem‐
perature fluctuations, is correct, and with which resolutions in time and space, etc. All these
questions should be investigated in the future since URANS may constitute a realistic alter‐
native, especially at high Reynolds number, to the promising LES approach that still is too
expensive for relatively large applications. Another alternative that has already been used
with encouraging results, (Lindqvist, 2011), is Very Large Eddy Simulation (VLES) in the
Nuclear Reactor Thermal Hydraulics and Other Applications
96

spirit of Speziale, (Speziale, 1998), an approach which has been further commented by Tino‐
co et al. (2010c).
Even if LES may be considered in many cases still too resource demanding, it is undeniably
the approach of the near future provided that the computer development trend is main‐
tained. However, conjugate heat transfer simulations of industrial applications, i.e. simula‐
tions at high Reynolds numbers, involved geometries and complex boundary conditions,
appear to lack guidelines for ensuring acceptable quality with a suitable uncertainty. LES, as
one of the simulation alternatives for these applications, seems to have taken a first step to‐
wards the definition of more complete rules for conjugate heat transfer simulations with the
work of Carlsson and Veber (2010). Using a DNS data base for channel flow, (The University
of Tokyo, 2012), mesh requirements for LES simulations of heat transfer are established, as
functions of the Reynolds and Prandtl numbers. This work should be extended to conjugate
heat transfer and temperature fluctuations in the solid by using the results of Tiselj et al.
(2001), Tiselj et al. (2004), Tiselj (2011) and Tiselj and Cizelj (2012).
To conclude, this study has tried to show that the analysis of the mechanical integrity of
light water reactors as a rather complex task, multidisciplinary and in continuous progress,
evolving towards improved safety due to Regulatory demands, new and more advanced
methods of analysis and taking advantage of the stably increasing available computer pow‐
er. Additionally, this work has tried to describe, although incompletely and briefly, the his‐
torical progress of the currently accepted methodology and future prospects. Other types of
analysis included in the existing methodology, which are not mentioned here due to space
limitations, are, for example, studies of thermal loads in transients such as the loss of offsite
power (Tinoco et al., 2005) or estimating the moderator tank maximum temperature due to
gamma radiation and subcooled boiling heat transfer (Tinoco et al., 2008).
As it might have become apparent from this study, the FEM method for the analysis of
structures is considered well established and sufficiently accurate, giving results that do not
need verification or experimental validation. The case of three-dimensional numerical com‐
putations (CFD) applied to the thermal-hydraulics is very different, mainly due to turbu‐
lence, which still lacks an explanatory theory, and to the presence of two-phase flows where
the knowledge about the physical processes involved is far from complete. Therefore, the re‐
sults obtained using three-dimensional numerical computations require validation or at
least verification, which is not always possible for complex systems such as nuclear reactors,
an issue that has been discussed by Tinoco et al. (2010c).

1. Introduction
Nuclear thermal propulsion [1] can carry far larger payloads and reduce travel time for astro‐
nauts going to Mars than is now possible with chemical propulsion. The most feasible con‐
cept,  extensively  tested  during  the  Rover/NERVA  (Nuclear  Engine  for  Rocket  Vehicle
Application) era, is the solid-core concept [2]. It features a solid-core nuclear reactor consist‐
ing of hundreds of heat generating prismatic flow elements. Each flow element contains tens
of tubular flow channels through which the working fluid, hydrogen, acquires energy and ex‐
pands in a high expansion nozzle to generate thrust. Approximately twenty nuclear thermal
engines with different sizes and designs were tested during that era. Using hydrogen as pro‐
pellant, a solid-core design typically delivers specific impulses (ISP) on the order of 850 to
1000 s, about twice that of a chemical rocket such as the Space Shuttle Main Engine (SSME).
With the announcement of the Vision for Space Exploration on January 14, 2004, NASA
Marshall Space Flight Center started a two-year solid-core nuclear rocket development ef‐
fort in 2006. The tasks included, but not limited to, nuclear systems development, design
methodology development, and materials development. In 2011, with the retirement of
Space Shuttle fleets, and NASA’s shifting focus to further out places such as Mars and aste‐
roids, nuclear thermal propulsion is likely to garner substantial interest again. It is therefore
timely to discuss the design methodology development effort from 2006 to 2007, entitled
“Multiphysics Thrust Chamber Modeling”, which developed an advanced thermal hydraul‐
ics computational methodology and studied a solid-core, nuclear thermal engine designed
in the Rover/NREVA era.

One of the impacts made by this thermal hydraulics design methodology is the considera‐
tion of chemical reacting flow that addresses the effect of hydrogen decomposition and re‐
combination. The advantage of using hydrogen as a propellant is well known in the
chemical rocket due to its low molecular weight. However, molecular hydrogen decompos‐
es to atomic hydrogen during high-temperature heating in the thermal nuclear reactor. Since
atomic hydrogen has half the weight of that of molecular hydrogen, it was speculated by
some that the total thrust could be doubled if all of the hydrogen is dissociated at very high
temperatures, therefore leaning to the high power density reactor design. In actuality, the
hydrogen conversion is often not uniform across the solid-core since the reactor temperature
depends on the hydrogen flow distribution and the actual power profile generated by the
nuclear fuel. In addition, the hydrogen atoms recombine in the nozzle since temperature de‐
creases rapidly during the gas expansion, thereby negating the thrust gain. To the best of
our knowledge, however, the effect of hydrogen decomposition in a thermal nuclear thrust
chamber on the thrust performance has never been studied.
On the other hand, it is always desirable to decrease the reactor weight while one of the
ideas is to reduce the reactor size, which increases the power density. One of the impacts of
operating at the combination of high temperature and high power density is a phenomenon
known as the mid-section corrosion [3], as reported during the legacy engine tests. It is the
cracking of the coating layer deposited on the inner wall of the flow channel, coupled with
an excessive mass loss of the material near the mid-section of a flow element. The purpose of
the coating layer was to isolate the carbonaceous compound in the flow element matrix from
the attack by hydrogen. The causes of mid-section corrosion were speculated as a mismatch
in the thermal expansion of flow element and its coating material, high flow element web
internal temperature gradients, and change of solid thermal property due to irradiation [3,
4]. Those are all possibilities related to the materials. We, however, wanted to trace the cause
from a thermal-hydraulics design view point. That is, with the long, narrow flow channel
design that is used to heat the hydrogen, the possibility of flow choking in the channel was
never studied. One of the efforts in this task was therefore to investigate the possibility of
chocked flow occurring in the long, narrow flow channel, and its implication on heat accu‐
mulation in the flow element and mid-section corrosion.
The objective of this study was to bridge the development of current design methods with
those developed in the Rover/NERVA era, thereby providing a solid base for future devel‐
opment. This is because during the Rover/NERVA era, there was a wealth of lessons learned
from those legacy engine tests. All those lessons learned culminated in the final design of
the Small Engine [5], but was never built nor tested since it was designed near the end of
that era. The Small Engine was therefore a ‘paper engine’ that bears the best features of les‐
sons learned. By simulating and comparing the computed environments with those of the
Small Engine design analysis and available test information from the legacy tests, the les‐
sons learned during Rover/NERVA era may be revitalized and the effect of some important
design features may be validated. This Chapter therefore reviews the thermal hydraulics
computational methodology developed to help the design of a materials tester [4, 6], and the
results reported in the design analyses of the Small Engine [7, 8]. Figure 1 shows the compu‐

A two-pronged approach was conducted to address the aforementioned efforts: a detailed
modeling of a single, powered flow element that addresses possible, additional cause of the
mid-section corrosion [8], and a global modeling approach that computes the entire thermal
flowfield of the Small Engine thrust chamber [7]. The latter links the thrust performance
with the effects of power profiles, chemical reactions, and overall heat transfer efficiency.
The global approach solves the entire thrust chamber with a detailed modeling, except the
thousands of flow channels in the hundreds of flow elements were lumped together as a po‐
rous media, for computational efficiency. The heat transfer between other supporting solid
components and the working fluid is solved with the conjugate transfer methodology,
which was developed in [4, 6]. Theoretical and neutronics provided power profiles were
used in lieu of the coupled neutronics modeling. The computational methodology, the re‐
sults of the simulations of a single flow element and that of the entire thrust chamber, are
presented and discussed herein.
2. Computational heat transfer methodology
2.1. Fluid dynamics
The computational methodology was based on a multi-dimensional, finite-volume, viscous,
chemically reacting, unstructured grid, and pressure-based, computational fluid dynamics
formulation [9]. Time-varying transport equations of continuity, species continuity, momen‐
tum, total enthalpy, turbulent kinetic energy, and turbulent kinetic energy dissipation rate
were solved using a time-marching sub-iteration scheme and are written as:

A predictor and corrector solution algorithm was employed to provide coupling of the gov‐
erning equations. A second-order central-difference scheme was employed to discretize the
diffusion fluxes and source terms. For the convective terms, a second-order upwind total
variation diminishing difference scheme was used. To enhance the temporal accuracy, a sec‐
ond-order backward difference scheme was employed to discretize the temporal terms. De‐
tails of the numerical algorithm can be found in [8-13].
An extended k-ε turbulence model [14] was used to describe the turbulent flow and turbu‐
lent heat transfer. A modified wall function approach was employed to provide wall boun‐
dary layer solutions that are less sensitive to the near-wall grid spacing. Consequently, the
model has combined the advantages of both the integrated-to-the-wall approach and the
conventional law-of-the-wall approach by incorporating a complete velocity profile and a
universal temperature profile [10].

The present conjugate heat transfer model [4] solves the heat conduction equation for the
solid blocks separately from the fluid equations. The interface temperature between gas and
solid, which is stored at interior boundary points, is calculated using the heat flux continuity
condition. For solution stability and consistency, the gas and solid interface boundary tem‐
perature is updated using the transient heat conduction equation (7).
2.3. Flow and heat transfer in porous media
A two-temperature porosity model was formulated with separate thermal conductivities for
the flow and the solid parts. The heat transfer between the flow and solid was modeled by
using the empirical correlation of the heat transfer coefficient for circular pipes as a function
of flow Reynolds numbers. Empirical multipliers for both the heat transfer and drag loss
were determined by comparing solutions of flow passing through a porous flow element
with those of a Small Engine 19-channel flow element using detailed conjugate heat transfer

For the purpose of this study, the conjugate heat transfer module for solids was bench‐
marked with the analysis of a cylindrical specimen heated by an impinging hot hydrogen jet
[4]. The computed solid temperature profiles agreed well with those of a standard solid heat
transfer code SINDA [16]. The methodology for flow through porous media was verified
through a particle-bed nuclear flow element [17] and the Space Shuttle Main Engine (SSME)
main injector assembly [18]. The numerical and physical models for predicting the thrust
and wall heat transfer were benchmarked with an analysis of the SSME thrust chamber
flowfield, in which the computed axial-thrust performance, flow features, and wall heat
fluxes compared well with those of the test data [12].

3. Small engine
The goals of this study were achieved by computing the thermal hydraulics of a flow el‐
ement and the entire thrust chamber of an engine designed near the end of the Rover/
NERVA era – the Small Engine. The thrust chamber of Small Engine composes of an in‐
let plenum, the solid-core nuclear reactor or heat exchanger, and an exhaust nozzle, as
shown in Fig. 1. There are 564 flow elements and 241 support elements or tie-tubes de‐
signed  for  the  thermal  nuclear  reactor.  The  flow  element  is  shaped  like  a  hexagonal
prism, with a length of about 890 mm and a width of about 19 mm from flat to flat [5,
8]. The prismatic flow element contains 19 tubular coolant channels. Three coolant chan‐
nel diameters were designed for the Small Engine. Each flow element is held in position
by three tie-tubes and the corresponding hot-end support system (not modeled). General
geometry and operating conditions were obtained from [5], while certain specific operat‐
ing conditions and nozzle geometry were calculated and provided by the Systems Engi‐
neering group.
3.1. Power profiles
For the purpose of this study, theoretical and neutronics calculation provided power pro‐
files were imposed onto the solid-core domain in lieu of the coupled neutronics calcula‐
tions, for computational efficiency. Combinations of two axial and three radial power
profiles, as shown in Figs. 2 and 3, were used to show the effect of which on the heat
transfer and thrust performance. Figure 2 shows a Cosine profile and a clipped Cosine
profile for the power distribution in the axial direction of the solid-core reactor, while
Fig. 3 shows a Cosine profile, a flattened (Cosine) profile, and a flat profile for the pow‐
er distributions in the radial direction of the nuclear heat exchanger. Given an example
for the thrust chamber computations, three combinations of these power profiles were as‐
sumed. The first combination uses the shape of the Cosine curve (shown in Figs. 2 and
3) in both the axial and radial directions. That combined power distribution resembles
the thermal flux distribution in bare reactors [19], and is simply named as the Cosine-
Cosine power profile. By definition, the combined Cosine-Cosine power profile peaks at
the middle of the core and drops to zero at the core boundary due to escaping neutrons.
The second combination was prescribed by a neutronics calculation with varied Uranium
loading. It features the clipped Cosine profile (shown in Fig. 2) in the axial direction and
the flattened (Cosine) profile (shown in Fig. 3) in the radial direction, and is dubbed as
the clipped Cosine-flattened power profile. The varied fuel loading flattens the (Cosine)
power profile in the radial direction, but the power rises near the boundary to show the
effect of the reflector, as shown in Fig. 3. The idea of flattening the radial profile is such
that  the  flow  in  the  channels  is  heated  more  uniformly,  thereby  improving  the  heat
transfer  efficiency.  It  is  envisioned  that  the  clipped  Cosine-flattened  power  profile  is
probably the closest power profile to that intended for the Small Engine.

It can be seen that if a radially flattened power profile improves the heat transfer efficiency,
then a theoretically flat, radial power profile should reach even higher heat transfer efficien‐
cy. We therefore proposed a flat power profile design for the radial direction. A theoretically
flat radial power distribution may be achieved with a combination of varied fuel loading
and working fluid flow distribution. The third combination therefore employs the clipped
Cosine curve (shown in Fig. 2) in the axial direction and a flat curve (shown in Fig. 3) in the
radial direction, and is called the clipped Cosine-flat power profile.

3.2. Thermal properties and kinetics
High-temperature real-gas thermodynamic properties were obtained from [20]. These proper‐
ties were generated for temperatures up to 20,000 K. The peak gas temperature computed in
this study did not exceed 10,000 K, hence is well within the applicable range. A 2-species, 2-re‐
action chemical kinetics mechanism was used to describe the finite-rate hydrogen dissociation
and recombination reactions, as shown in Table 1. The first hydrogen recombination reaction is
abridged from a large set of kinetics mechanism developed for kerosene combustion [21],
while an irreversible, second reaction [22] is added to describe the hydrogen decomposition.
The kinetics of the first hydrogen recombination step have been benchmarked through many
kinetic mechanism studies, as described in Ref. [21], while the kinetic rates of the second hydro‐
gen recombination reaction were measured [22]. Note the first reaction is a reversible reaction.

The importance of finite-rate chemistry was demonstrated in [7], where thermal hydraulics
analyses were conducted for the Small Engine with and without finite-rate chemistry. One
of the results show that, when the Cosine-Cosine power profile was imposed on the solid-
core, the maximum solid temperature calculated with the finite-rate chemistry case was 5369
K, while that for the frozen chemistry case was much higher at 9366 K. This is because the
hydrogen decomposition is endothermic. The frozen chemistry freezes molecular hydrogen
throughout the thrust chamber and does not allow the hydrogen decomposition to occur,
hence an artificially high maximum solid temperature was calculated. It can be seen that
without finite-rate chemistry involved, the computed thermal environment and thrust per‐
formance are not physical [7].
The solid-core flow element material is assumed to be the (U, Zr)C-graphite composite A,
which was tested as flow element material in a legacy reactor [23]. Properties of thermal
conductivity, density, and heat capacity as a function of temperature were obtained for (U,
Zr)C-graphite composite A from Ref. [23]. Those properties of Beryllium [19] were used for
the reflector and slat in the thrust chamber computation. Slat acts as a buffer between the
solid-core and the reflector. The thermal properties for the coating layer deposited on the in‐
ner wall of flow channels were also obtained from [23].
4. Small engine single flow element modeling
From the material properties point of view, the main cause of mid-section corrosion was
speculated as a mismatch in the thermal expansion of flow element and its coating material
[3, 4]. The solution is therefore to improve the material properties through materials devel‐
opment [4, 6]. In addition to the materials development, however, we feel further study
through the thermal hydraulics analysis of the fundamental reactor design is also important.
That is, reduction of the reactor size often started with reducing the diameter of the flow
channels, which results in higher aspect ratio, or longer flow channels. According to the
Rayleigh line theory, flow with continuous heat addition in a long tube could choke. When
that happens, any further heat addition can only serve to reduce the mass flow rate in the
tube or, in other words, to jump to another Rayleigh line of lower mass flow [24]. This phe‐
nomenon could cause unintended mass flow mal-distribution in the solid-core reactor, re‐
sulting in uneven and high local thermal load in the flow element matrix, thereby cracking
the coating material. The goal is therefore to compute if choking could occur in one of the
flow channels in the Small Engine. To achieve this goal, the worst case was pursued. That is,
the Cosine-Cosine power profile which generates peak thermal load in the center of the reac‐
tor was assumed. As a result, the flow element located at the center of the solid-core reactor
was selected for the computation. In addition, among the three diameters considered for the
flow channel of the Small Engine [5], the smallest flow channel diameter was selected, for its
highest aspect ratio. These choices were made such that the computed hot hydrogen flow
inside one of the flow channels had the best chance to choke.

4.1. Computational grid generation
As mentioned above, the flow element is shaped like a hexagonal prism, containing 19 tubu‐
lar coolant channels for the propellant hydrogen to acquire heat from the neutronic reac‐
tions, as sketched in Fig. 4. For computational efficiency, a 60º pie-section of a single flow
element was computed by taking advantage of the symmetrical nature of the prism geome‐
try. A hybrid volume grid was generated by extrusion [25, 26] from a 2-D cross-sectional
mesh, as shown in Fig. 5. Structured grid cells were used for the inner and outer layers of
the flow channel, and for the outer edges of the prismatic flow element, while unstructured
grid cells were used for the rest of the internal web. The structured grid cells at the inner
layer of the flow channel was to resolve the turbulent boundary layer, while the general
strategy of the hybrid mesh was to minimize numerical diffusion and the number of cells.

117

In this study, a coating layer, which has different thermal properties from those of the flow
element, was also modeled for the flow channel. This was done to imitate the design of
those flow elements described in the legacy engine test [23], in which the coating layer was
added to protect the carbonaceous compound in the flow element from the alleged chemical
attack by the heated, high temperature hydrogen. It is noted that, in the present simulation,
the thermal properties of the flow element and the coating layer vary with temperatures.
Lastly, in the computational model, an entrance region and an exit region were added to the
upstream and downstream of the flow element, respectively, to simulate the environments
above and below the solid-core. Total number of cells used was 4.5 million. The heat transfer
between the fluid flow, coating layer and the solid fuel was simulated with the conjugate
heat transfer model.
4.2. Results and discussion
In this study, various power generation levels were simulated, and it was found that flow
choking occurred in some coolant channels as the power level reached about 80% of the
maximum power level. Theoretically, once the flow choking occurs, further increase of heat
addition would lead to the reduction of mass flow rate in the flow channel, amount to shift‐
ing from one Rayleigh line to another as described in Ref. [24]. This could cause mass flow
maldistribution in the flow-element matrix, resulting in uneven thermal load in the solid-
core. That is, the temperature of the internal web houses the flow channels starved with
coolant hydrogen may rise unexpectedly, potentially leading to the cracking of the coating
material. Unfortunately, further increase of the power led to unrealistic numerical solutions
because of the boundary conditions employed (fixed mass flow rate at the inlet and mass
conservation at the exit). This set of boundary conditions was used because only one flow
element was simulated, and thus, mass flow reduction at higher power level was precluded.
To allow for local mass flow reductions, at least 1/12 of a pie shaped cross-section of the sol‐
id-core has to be computed such that fixed mass flow boundary condition need not be used.
However, that option was out of the scope of this study. Nevertheless, the current setup is
still acceptable since our goal is to determine whether flow choking could occur in the flow
channel.
Figure 6 shows the computed temperature distribution in the radial direction (across the sol‐
id-fluid interface) at the mid-section of the flow channel. The radial temperature profile re‐
veals that substantial thermal gradients occur at the fluid-coating interface and the coating-
solid fuel interface. This kind of high thermal gradient occurring at the coating-solid
interfaces could be an issue already without flow choking in the flow channel. With flow
choking and the coolant flow rate reduced, the thermal gradient at the coating-solid inter‐
face could be even higher since heat is not carried away at the design point, and eventually
mid-section corrosion could develop.
Figure 7 shows the computed axial temperature and Mach number profiles along centerlines
1 and 2 (see locations of centerlines 1 and 2 in Fig. 5). The axial temperature profiles almost
overlap for centerlines 1 and 2, so are the axial Mach number profiles. The peak Mach num‐
ber exceeds unity near the end of the flow channel. It can also be seen that the temperatures

of propellant hydrogen, rise steadily but drop about 200 K to 2300 K near the end of the fuel
port. That is because near the end of fuel port, the flows become choked in both channels.
The predicted maximum temperature of both flow channels is about 2700 K. The most sig‐
nificant result from Fig. 7 is that the flow choked near the end of the fuel port, indicating the
mass flow rates in these two channels could be reduced, resulting in higher flow element
web internal temperature and higher thermal gradient at the coating-solid fuel interfaces
and eventually, the possible cracking of the coating layer. Under the operating conditions
and assumptions made in this study, the possibility of chocked flow occurring in the flow
channels is therefore demonstrated. For future study, three-dimensional numerical simula‐
tions of multiple flow elements with a fixed upstream total pressure boundary condition,
and a downstream nozzle to remove the fixed exit mass flow boundary condition are neces‐
sary to include the inter-element effect. Although the chocked flow occurring in the flow
channel is a potential design flaw, the impact of which can readily be avoided by shortening
the length of the flow channel to, say, 0.85 m (Fig. 7), without lowering the maximum gas
temperature.

5. Small engine thrust chamber modeling
The rationale of analyzing the entire thrust chamber was to bridge the Small Engine design
in the Rover/NERVA era to the current modern thermal hydraulic computational methodol‐
ogy. Specifically, to relate the assigned power profiles to that of the Small Engine by com‐
paring the computed thrust performance with that of the design. Since there are 564 flow
elements and 241 support elements or tie-tubes, and each flow element contains 19 tubular
flow channels, it is computationally cost-prohibitive to solve detailed thermal hydraulics for
each and every flow channel. The 19 flow channels in each flow element were therefore
lumped as one porous flow channel for computational efficiency, and the effect of drag and
heat transfer were modeled with flow and conjugate heat transfer through porous media, or
Eq. (8) through Eq. (12). The medium coolant channel diameter, out of the three coolant
channel diameters designed for the Small Engine [5], was selected to derive the porosity of
the flow elements.
5.1. Computational grid generation
Hybrid computational grids were generated using a software package GRIDGEN V15.07
[27]. The layout of the flow elements and tie-tubes of the solid-core is such that the whole
thrust chamber is symmetrical about a 30 deg. pie-shaped cross-section, hence only the 30

deg. cross-section was computed assuming symmetry. The strategy of using hybrid mesh
was again for computational efficiency. Figure 8 shows a 240 deg. view of the computational
grid and geometry layout of the Small Engine thrust chamber. The thrust chamber includes
the hydrogen inlet duct, pressure vessel, and a nozzle with an expansion ratio of 100. Only
tie-tubes in the pressure vessel are shown for clarity. Figure 9 shows a cross-sectional view
of the solid-core computational grid, depicting flow elements, tie-tubes, slat, and reflector.

No-slip boundary condition was applied to all solid walls, while supersonic outflow boun‐
dary condition was employed at the nozzle exit. A fixed total pressure and temperature con‐
dition was used at the inlet. Inlet hydrogen flow properties were obtained from a system
model simulation. Since the minor thermal effects of tie-tubes were included in the system
model simulation, an adiabatic wall boundary condition was used for tie-tube walls. The
core surrounding components such as the slat and reflector were treated as heat conducting
solids to provide accurate boundary conditions for the solid-core boundary. The heat con‐
ducted from the core through slat and reflector to the outer thrust chamber walls was dissi‐
pated to a far-field temperature assumed to be 310 K. Table 2 shows the run matrix with
three combinations of the axial and radial power profiles: the Cosine-Cosine, clipped Co‐
sine-flattened (Cosine), and clipped Cosine-flat profiles. A series of mesh studies using grid
sizes of 1,903,278, 1,925,742, 4,681,751, and 7,460,255 points were performed on case 1. It was
found that the computed average pressure drops across the solid-core were very similar and
the differences among the computed thrust values were less than 2.5%. Based on those find‐
ings and the consideration for computational efficiency, the grid size of 1,925,742 points (or
2,408,198 computational cells) was selected for the rest of the computations.

5.2. Results and discussion
5.2.1. Temperature contours and profiles in the thrust chamber
Figure 10 shows the computed thrust chamber temperature contours with three different
power profiles: the Cosine-Cosine, clipped Cosine-flattened, and clipped Cosine-flat pro‐
files. In the plotted temperature contours, those in the solid-core represent the solid temper‐
atures in the flow elements; the portions surrounding the solid-core depict the temperatures
in the slat and reflector, while the rest are the gas temperature contours. It can be seen that
the solid-core temperature contours on the left (case 1) reflect the effect of Cosine-Cosine
power distribution, since the peak temperature is located near the middle of the reactor, ex‐
cept it is shifted downstream of the geometrical center in the axial direction. The hydrogen
gas temperature contours in the solid core take the same shape as those of the solid tempera‐
ture, except lower. The heat transfer delay in the axial direction is a result of the energy bal‐
ance between the cooling from the incoming cold hydrogen in the flow channels and the
heating from the nuclear material in the web of the flow elements. It is apparent that the ef‐
fect of cold hydrogen won the fight between the two counter-acting phenomena, and pushes
the peak flow element temperature downstream that shows up as a delay in heat transfer.

Figure 11 shows the computed solid and gas axial temperature profiles on the symmetry
plane, along the centerline of each flow element. Only the temperature profiles for the 1st,
3rd, 5th, 7th, and 9th flow elementfrom the center tie-tube are plotted for clarity. The solid tem‐
peratures (Ts shown as dashed lines) lead those of the gas temperatures (Tg, solid lines),
showing the effect of the heat transfer lag between the flow element matrix and hydrogen
gas. The gas temperatures appear to peak near the core exit, while the solid temperatures
appear to peak more upstream for the 1st, 3rd, and 5th flow element, comparing to the peak
temperature locations of the hydrogen. The lead decreases at the 7th flow element, and dis‐
appears completely at the 9th flow element. These axial temperature profiles reflect the effect
of the Cosine-Cosine power profile that concentrates the power in the middle of the core,
and drops to zero power at the core boundary. The peak solid temperature for the 9th flow
element is the lowest at around 700 K, as expected. The gas temperature at the core-exit is
about 4600 K for the 1st flow element, and again about 700 K for the 9th flow element. The
3900 K core-exit gas temperature spread between the 1st and 9th flow elements indicates a
very non-uniform temperature distribution at the core-exit, or poor heat transfer efficiency,
apparently caused by the power-centric Cosine-Cosine power distribution. Note the temper‐
ature gradient of the solid temperature is very steep for the 1st flow element occurring at a
location between the core entrance and the peak temperature.

As discussed above, it is apparent that the Cosine-Cosine power distribution causes not only
peak solid temperatures that are too high, but also very non-uniform core-exit gas tempera‐
tures, indicating inefficient heat transfer. Fortunately, by measures such as varying the fuel
loading, a flattened (Cosine) distribution in the radial direction could be achieved, as indi‐
cated in Fig. 3. Note that this profile is not completely flat, since the normalized power is
about 1.1 at the center, drops to a minimum of about 0.9 at two-thirds of the radius outward,
then rise to a maximum power of 1.6 at the boundary. But comparing it to the Cosine-Cosine
power profile, it is relatively flat. In fact, by our estimation, this clipped Cosine–flattened
power profile is the most representative of that intended for the Small Engine. The middle
picture of Fig. 10 shows the computed solid and gas temperatures, for this clipped Cosine-
flattened power profile. It can be seen that the solid and gas temperature contours, reflect
the effect of the clipped Cosine-flattened power distribution. Comparing to the temperature
contours in the left of Fig. 10, those in the middle are more uniform. The peak solid and gas
temperatures in the middle of Fig. 10 at about 3149 and 3081 K., respectively, are much low‐
er than those in the left of Fig. 10, or 5369 and 4596 K., respectively.
Figure 12 shows the computed solid and gas axial temperature profiles on the symmetry
plane. Comparing to those of Fig. 11, it can be seen that other than the 9th flow element, the
solid temperature generally leads the gas temperature only slightly, since the clipped Co‐
sine-flattened power profile is more uniform than the Cosine-Cosine profile. The peak core-
exit gas temperature of the 1st fuel element is about 3037 K., while that of the 9th fuel element
is about 2514 K. The range of the gas temperatures at the core-exit is hence only about 523 K,
much less than that of 3900 K in case 1, indicating the core-exit gas temperature of case 2 is
much more uniform than that of case 1. The flattened radial power profile is therefore a vast
improvement over the Cosine radial power distribution.
As mentioned before, it is possible to make the flattened radial power profile in Fig. 3 com‐
pletely flat, by further fine tuning the fuel loading and by shaping the radial hydrogen mass
flow rate profile to match that of the shape of the radial power profile; hence, the proposed
theoretical flat radial power profile. The hydrogen mass flow rate profile may be shaped
with the installation of various sizes of orifices at the entrance of each flow element. The re‐
sult of the computed solid and gas temperature contours of such a case, or case 3, using the
clipped Cosine-flat power profile, is shown in the right of Fig. 10. It can be seen in terms of
the solid-core radial temperature distribution and the uniformity of the gas temperature be‐
neath the solid core, this result is the most uniform. Figure 13 shows the solid and gas axial
temperature profiles for the 1st, 3rd, 5th, 7th, and 9th flow elements in the solid-core for case 3.
It can be seen that the temperature spread among the 1st, 3rd, 5th and 7th flow elements are
much smaller than those of earlier cases, except those of the 9th flow element due to the heat
loss to the slat and reflector. From the right picture of Fig. 10 and from Fig. 13, it can be seen
this flat radial power profile is a very good power profile in terms of general uniformity of
the temperatures for both solid and gas temperatures inside the core and for gas exit tem‐
peratures.

5.2.2. Hydrogen atom mass fraction contours in the thrust chamber
Figure 14 shows the computed thrust chamber hydrogen mass fraction contours with three
aforementioned power profiles: the Cosine-Cosine, clipped Cosine-flattened, and clipped Co‐
sine-flat profiles. The hydrogen atom mass fractions are important because the amount of
which is directly related to the eventual temperature contours. As a result, the hydrogen atom
mass fraction contours look qualitatively similar to those of the solid-core temperature con‐
tours, with the peak conversion pushed to near the end of the core due to the same reason that
pushed the peak solid temperature away from the center of the core. For the Cosine-Cosine
power profile case, as shown in the left picture of Fig. 14, coolant hydrogen enters the thrust
chamber at about 370 K, heats up to about 4800 K in the solid-core, then cools and expands into
the diverging nozzle to generate the thrust. Molecular hydrogen decomposes to atomic hydro‐
gen at about 2400 K; hence, most of the hydrogen atoms are formed while in the flow elements.
Once the local temperature starts to cool, i.e. during the expansion in the nozzle, hydrogen
atoms recombine to become molecular hydrogen. The peak hydrogen atom mass fraction in
case 1 is 0.40, or 40% conversion from hydrogen molecule decomposition.
The middle picture in Fig. 14 shows the computed hydrogen atom mass fraction contours for
case 2. It surely reflects the effect of the clipped Cosine-flattened power distribution shown in
Figs. 2 and 3. Since the peak solid and gas temperatures of the clipped Cosine-flattened power
profile are lower than those of the Cosine-Cosine power profile, as displayed in the previous
section, the peak hydrogen atom mass fraction also drops from a high of 0.40 in the Cosine-Co‐
sine power profile case to a lowly 0.02, or a 2% conversion in the clipped Cosine-flattened pow‐
er profile case. Note that the atomic hydrogen contours in case 2 exhibit a more pronounced
striation in the pressure vessel beneath the core than those in case 1. This is caused by the high‐
er power profile near the core boundary, resulting in higher local temperatures, thereby higher
hydrogen molecule conversion near the core boundary for case 2 than that for case 1.

Shown in the right figure of Fig. 14 is the computed hydrogen atom mass fraction contours
for the clipped Cosine-flat power profile case, or case 3. It can be seen that the hydrogen
atom mass fraction contours are the most uniform throughout the thrust chamber, among
the three cases. The effect of the flat radial power profile is apparently the driver. As a re‐
sult, the hydrogen atom conversion drops from 2% in case 2 to 1.5% in case 3.
5.2.3. Summary
The computed heat transfer and thrust performance design parameters for all three cases are
compared with those available of the Small Engine and summarized in Table 3. The comput‐
ed core pressure drops are shown in the second column. The values for all three cases are
close to the design number, although that of the Cosine-Cosine power distribution case is
slightly lower. The computed peak solid temperatures are shown in the third column, in
which the highest peak solid temperature belongs to case 1, followed by case 2, with the
lowest peak solid temperature comes from case 3, as expected.
The fourth column shows the average core-exit gas temperatures. These were obtained by
averaging the temperatures at the core-exit for all nine elements on the symmetry plane. It
can be seen that the average core-exit gas temperature for the Cosine-Cosine power distribu‐
tion at 3334 K, is much higher than that of the Small Engine design temperature at 2750 K.
On the other hand, the average core-exit gas temperatures for the clipped Cosine-flattened
and clipped Cosine-flat power distribution cases are both quite close to that of the Small En‐
gine at 2785 and 2782 K, respectively.

Table 3. A summary of the heat transfer and performance parameters.
The computed temperature spread, or the difference of the core-exit gas temperature be‐
tween the first and the 9th flow elements, is shown in the fifth column. Lower temperature
spread represents more uniform temperature distribution amongst the flow elements, or
better heat transfer efficiency. It can be seen that the clipped Cosine-flattened power profile
produces best heat transfer efficiency, the clipped Cosine-flat power profile ranks the sec‐
ond, while the Cosine-Cosine power profile has the worst heat transfer efficiency. Note that
if without the outlier of the temperature profile at the 9th fuel element for case 3, its tempera‐
ture spread from the rest is more uniform than that of case 2, as indicated in Figs. 12 and 13.

From the last column comes with the comparison of the specific impulses. The best thrust
performance belongs to case 3 that is much higher than the design value, followed by case2
which is within the design range, while case 1 has the lowest ISP. Yet the maximum atomic
hydrogen conversions are 40%, 2% and 1.5%, for cases 1, 2, and 3, respectively. These results
demonstrate that the notion of higher temperature, more atomic hydrogen, therefore higher
thrust is not valid. Rather, it is the most uniform radial power profile that produces the
highest thrust.
In summary, the computed core pressure drop, core-exit gas temperature, and specific im‐
pulse, from the clipped Cosine-flattened power distribution agree well with those of the
Small Engine. The result indicates the fluid, thermal, and hydrogen environments computed
with the present computational thermal hydraulics methodology closely emulate what was
intended for the original Small Engine design. In addition, examining the results of our pro‐
posed clipped Cosine-flat power distribution, not only the computed core-exit gas tempera‐
ture and core pressure drop agree equally well with those of the Small Engine, the
computed specific impulse is 25 to 40 seconds higher than those of the Small Engine, dem‐
onstrating the present computational methodology can be used to guide the future design.
6. Conclusion
Thermal hydraulics computational design analyses were performed to investigate the mid-
section corrosion issue occurred during the legacy engine tests, and to predict the heat trans‐
fer efficiency and thrust performance for a virtual solid-core, nuclear thermal engine thrust
chamber – the Small Engine. Multiphysics invoked include the turbulent flow and heat
transfer, finite-rate chemistry, power generation, and conjugate heat transfer for solids and
porous media. The results of a detailed single flow element modeling show that under the
assumption of the worst design condition, the hot hydrogen flow could choke near the end
of the narrow, long flow channels, which could lead to hydrogen flow reduction and local
hot spots in the solid-core; hence, originating the mid-section corrosion. In addition, a uni‐
fied Small Engine thrust chamber thermal flow field constituting those of the inlet plenum,
the pressure vessel, and the nozzle, was analyzed with three power profiles. It was found
that the computed core pressure drop, core-exit gas temperature, and specific impulse for
the clipped Cosine-flattened power profile closely agreed with those of the Small Engine de‐
sign values. It was also found that with our proposed clipped Cosine-flat power profile, not
only the computed core-ext gas temperature and core pressure drop closely agreed with
those of the Small Engine, the corresponding specific impulse was much higher than those
of the original Small Engine numbers. Design lesson learned from this effort is that high hy‐
drogen molecule conversion to hydrogen atoms neither improves the heat transfer efficien‐
cy, nor increases the thrust performance. Rather, it is the more uniform radial power profile
that produces lower peak solid temperature, higher heat transfer efficiency, and higher
thrust performance.

1. Introduction
The mixing and agitation of fluid in a stirred tank have raised continuous attention. Starting
with Harvey and Greaves, Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) has been applied as a power‐
ful tool for investigating the detailed information on the flow in the tank [1-2]. In their work,
the impeller boundary condition (IBC) approach has been proposed for the impeller modeling,
in which the flow characteristics near the impeller are experimentally measured, and are speci‐
fied as the boundary conditions for the whole flow field computation [1-4]. Because it depends
on the experimental data, IBC can hardly predict the flow in the stirred tank and its applicabili‐
ty is inherently limited. To overcome this drawback, the multiple rotating reference frames ap‐
proach (MRF) has been developed, in which the vessel is divided into two parts: the inner zone
using a rotating frame and the outer zone associated with a stationary frame, for a steady state
simulation. Although it can predict the flow field, the computation result is slightly lack of ac‐
curacy and needs a longer time for convergence [5]. Sliding mesh approach (SM) is another
available approach, in which the inner grid is assumed to rotate with the impeller speed, and
the full transient simulations are carried out [6-7]. SM approach gives an improved result, but
it suffers from the large computational expense [8]. Moving-deforming grid technique was
proposed by Perng and Murthy [9], in which the grid throughout the vessel moves with the im‐
peller and deforms. This approach requires a rigorous grid quality and the computational ex‐
penses are even higher than SM [10-11].
Momentum source term approach adds momentum source in the computational cells to rep‐
resent the impeller propelling and the real blades are ignored. In the approach, the genera‐
tions of the vessel configuration and grids are simpler, and the computational time is shorter
and the computational accuracy is higher. However, the determination of the momentum
source depends on experimental data or empirical coefficients presently [12-13]. The ap‐

proach proposed by Pericleous and Patel is based on the airfoil aerodynamics and originally
aimed at the two-dimensional flow in the stirred vessels. Xu, McGrath [14] and Patwardhan
[15] applied this approach to simulate the three-dimensional flow pattern in a tank with the
pitched blade turbines. Revstedt et al. [16] modified the approach for the three-dimensional
simulation in a Rushton turbine stirred vessel. In their approach, the determination of the
momentum source depends on the specified power number. Dhainaut et al. [13] reported a
kind of momentum source term approach in which the fluid velocity is linearly proportional
to the radius with an empirical coefficient. In our previous study, we proposed to calculate
the momentum source term according to the ideal propeller equation [17], which is related
to the rotation speed and radius of the blade [18-20], however, the prediction accuracy is just
a little better than MRF method.
Besides, other methods, such as inner-outer approach, snapshot approach and adaptive
force field technique, have been developed, but are less applied[1, 21].
In this study, an equation is proposed to calculate the momentum source term after consid‐
ering both impeller propelling force and the radial friction effect between the blades and flu‐
id. The flow field in the Rushton turbine stirred vessel was simulated with the CFD model.
The available experimental data near the impeller tip and in the bulk region were applied to
validate this approach. Moreover, the comparisons of the computational accuracy and time
with MRF and SM were carried out.
2. Model and methods
2.1. Stirred tank and grid generation
Fig.1 shows the geometry of the investigated standard six-bladed Rushton turbine stirred
tank with four equally spaced baffles. The diameter of cylindrical vessel T = 0.30 m, the di‐
ameter of rotating shaft d = 0.012 m, the hub diameter b = 0.020 mm, and the detailed size
proportions are listed in Table 1. The working fluid is water with density ρ = 998.2 kg m-3
and viscosity μ = 1.003×10−3 Pa s. The rotational speed of the impeller N = 250 rpm, leading to
a tip speed u tip = 1.31 m s-1 and Reynolds number Re = 41,467 (Re = ρND 2 /μ). Eight axial
locations in the bulk region are also shown in Fig.1. They are the same as the experimental
study of Murthy and Joshi [22],
It is well known that sufficiently fine grids and lower-dissipation discretization schemes can
significantly reduce the numerical errors [23]. And the grid resolution on the blades has an
important influence on capturing the details of flow near the impeller [23-24]. Grid inde‐
pendence study has been carried out for momentum source term approach with the stand‐
ard k-ε model with different grid resolutions. In this paper, the results of the grid resolution
of 1,429,798 hexahedral cells (r×θ×z ≈ 88×120×131) with the impeller blade covered with
96000 cells (r×θ×z = 32×120×25) have been reported for the simulations of standard k-ε model
and Reynolds stress model (RSM). In the region encompassing the impeller discharge
stream, contained within 1.5 blade heights above and below the impeller and extending hor‐

izontally across the tank, the grid was refined to resolve the large flow gradients (Fig.2). For
it is unnecessary to construct the impeller in momentum source term approach, the tank ge‐
ometry and mesh generations are simpler than MRF and SM.

In order to investigate the computational speed of MRF and SM, they are also applied to
simulate the flow field of stirred tank. The total number of computational cells for MRF is
1,652,532 (r×θ×z ≈ 63×204×126) with the impeller blade covered with 88128 cells (r×θ×z =

33920 cells (r×θ×z = 20×106×16).
2.2. Momentum source model and control equations
Following the assumptions of Euler equation for turbomachinery [25], the momentum
source term from the driving of blade is determined as following. For a small area of blade
dS, assuming that a force exerted by the impeller on the fluid is perpendicular to the blade
surface [14], the propelling force from the impeller dF is considered to be equal to the prod‐
uct of the mass flow rate across the interaction section dQ and the fluid velocity variation
along the normal direction of the area element dS:
d

Q

(1)
Since the rigid body rotational motion of the blade is considered, it is a reasonable as‐
sumption that the fluid velocity after being acted on is the same as the velocity of the im‐
peller blade, thus Δu can be obtained. For the present study on the vertical blade, Eq.(1)
can be written as:

where u is linear velocity of the area element on the blade surface dS, v θ is fluid tangential
velocity rotating with the impeller before the fluid was propelled by impeller, dS is cross-
section area of the interface between fluid and the impeller blade. A similar equation has
been applied to describe the propelling effect of the ship’s impeller [26] which we applied it
to calculate the momentum source term [18-19].
Furthermore, the fluid is continuously impelled out from the impeller region, so there is a rela‐
tive motion of the fluid along the radial direction of the blade. In order to consider the friction
effect on the fluid movement, the friction resistance equation about the finite flat plate based on
the boundary layer theory is introduced to calculate the friction force approximately [27]:

where Rex = ρv r x/μ , x is distance between cell center and the center of rotation axis. In
this paper, we mainly consider the radial friction resistance, ignoring the axial effect for
simplicity. Adding the momentum sources of the both direction into the computational
cells, the real blade is replaced.
In the previous study, the difference between the ensemble-averaged flow field calculated
with the steady-state and the time-dependent approaches was found to be negligible [28-30].
Here, the continuity and momentum equations of motion for three-dimensional incompres‐
sible flow, as well as the standard k–ε turbulence equation [31] or Reynolds stress transport
equations [32], were solved to calculate single phase flow of the stirred vessel.
The free surface was treated as a flat and rigid lid, so a slip wall was given to the surface.
The disc, hub and shaft of the Rushton turbine are specified as moving walls. A standard
wall function was given to the other solid walls, including the bottom surface, the sidewall
and baffles. Second order upwind discretization scheme was adopted for pressure interpola‐
tion and the convection term of momentum, turbulent kinetic energy and energy dissipation
rate equations, and the discretized equations were solved iteratively by using the SIMPLE
algorithm for pressure-velocity coupling.
2.3. Power number prediction
The power number N P is an important parameter of the stirred tank, which is generally ap‐
plied to validate the CFD predictions [33-34]. One method for calculating the power number is
based on the energy balance, in which the power number of the impeller is calculated from the
integration of the turbulent energy dissipation rate (ε) predicted from the CFD model [35]:

3. Results and discussion
3.1. Numerical validation of the flow field near the impeller tip
Fig.3 shows the profiles of the predicted and experimental flow data in the impeller region.
Fig.3a gives the comparison of the radial velocity. Escudie and Line [37] summarized the
previous experimental works and found due to the differences of the experimental techni‐
que and the stirred-vessel configuration, there existed some inconsistencies among the re‐
ported results, whereas the maximum of radial velocity was in the range of 0.7-0.87u tip.
Their experiment study gave a maximal radial velocity of 0.80u tip, while Wu and Patterson
[38] 0.75u tip. In present work, momentum source term approach with standard k-ε and RSM
predicts a maximum radial velocity of 0.79u tip and 0.75u tip, respectively, which means that
momentum source term approach predicts the maximal radial velocity rather well. From fig.
3a, the distribution of radial velocity predictions based on momentum source term approach
agrees rather well with the experimental data, which outperforms MRF predictions.
With regard to tangential velocity, the maxima from Wu and Patterson [38], and Escudie
and Line [37] are 0.66u tip and 0.72u tip respectively. For momentum source term approach
with standard k-ε and RSM, both gave a maximum of 0.63u tip. From Fig. 3b, it can be found
that the calculated results of momentum source term approach are in good agreement with
the two sets of experimental data, better than MRF predictions.
Fig.3c shows the comparison of axial velocity. The measured results from Wu and Patterson
[38], Escudie and Line [37] are almost the same. The momentum source term approach re‐
sults match the measured data well in most regions, but predicting the change from the
maximum to minimum with several deviations. Compared to standard k-ε model, RSM pre‐
dictions of momentum source term approach make some improvements, while MRF predic‐
tions are not provided.
In fig.3d, it can be observed that there are two maxima of different magnitudes in the pro‐
files of turbulent kinetic energy, thus the curve is not symmetrical. RSM simulations of mo‐
mentum source term approach are in accordance with those of standard k-ε model.
Momentum source term approach and MRF both successfully predict the variations be‐
tween two maxima, but momentum source term approach exhibits a better prediction of the
turbulent kinetic energy than MRF.

3.2. Numerical validation of the flow field in the bulk region
Fig.4 shows the radial profiles of the mean axial velocity at various axial levels. Here, z<0.10
m is in the lower parts of the tank, while z>0.10 m is in the upper parts. It can be noted that
curve changes in two parts are just opposite, indicating that axial velocity directions are op‐
posite. The result shows that the predictions of momentum source term approach with
standard k-ε model and RSM are both in favorable agreement with the experimental data,
similar to the predicted results of SM.
Fig.5 depicts the comparison of predicted and experimental radial velocity component. The
high speed impeller discharge streams radially. Radial velocity initially increases and then
decreases, attaining the maximum at r/R = 0.6-0.8 near blade. It can be seen that compared to
the experimental data, both the standard k-ε model predictions of momentum source term
approach and SM exhibit some disparity, particularly at the levels in the upper part. At the
top axial levels (z = 0.154 m and z = 0.244 m), there are the largest differences between the
predictions of momentum source term approach and SM, while they have similar accuracy
in other positions. However, the results of momentum source term approach and SM pre‐
dicted with RSM are consistent with the experimental data.

predictions (Murthy and Joshi, 2008), RSM SM predictions (Murthy and Joshi, 2008).
Fig.6 illustrates the radial profiles of the tangential velocity component. Yianneskis et al [40]
pointed out that the baffles reduce the vessel cross-section, which results in higher values
for tangential velocity and a reduced pressure, thus generating reverse flows. It may be the
reason that negative velocities exist at the levels of z = 0.01 m and z = 0.044 m. It can be seen
that the computational results of momentum source term approach and SM with standard k-
ε model are similar, and both of them predict the reverse flows. They agree rather well with
the experimental data at the lower levels, whereas deviate at the upper levels. For RSM sim‐
ulations, the prediction accuracy of two modeling methods have been improved, and their
results are in good agreement with the experimental results.

momentum source term approach predictions, RSM momentum source term approach predictions, standard k-ε SM
predictions (Murthy and Joshi, 2008), RSM SM predictions (Murthy and Joshi, 2008).
Fig.7 shows the numerical comparison of turbulent kinetic energy in various positions. At z
= 0.082m, it can be noticed that there are two maxima of turbulent kinetic energy, similar to
the case of tangential velocity (Fig.6). They are generated by the interactions between fluid
and blades a, fluid and wall, respectively. Overall, the CFD results which predicted by
standard k-ε model are not satisfying, significantly underpredicting the turbulent kinetic en‐
ergy at almost all positions. However, the results of momentum source term approach and
SM are similar. Although RSM predictions of momentum source term approach and SM
have reduced the errors, both still underestimate turbulent kinetic energy, and their results

145

are similar. Due to unsteady and complex nature of flow characteristics in the impeller re‐
gion and the continuous conversion of kinetic energy [37], the k-ε model and RSM both fail
to capture the transfer details of kinetic energy, so the momentum source term approach
and SM model underpredict the turbulent kinetic energy with similar deviations when the
k-ε and RSM turbulent model are applied.
From the comparisons above, it can be found that predictions of momentum source term ap‐
proach with RSM turbulent model are in good agreement with the experimental data as well
as SM model, although both SM and our model have some deviations in prediction of the
upper part for the radial and tangential velocity. The models combined with k-ε turbulent
model have less prediction accuracy, Murthy and Joshi [22] attributed these numerical er‐
rors to the overestimation of the eddy viscosity of the k-ε model. It is suggested that the
standard k−ε model performs well when the flow is unidirectional that is with less swirl and
weak recirculation [11, 22].
3.3. Velocity vectors
Fig.8 shows velocity vectors of the vertical plane in the middle of two baffles. It can be seen
that after exerting on the momentum source, fluid velocity in the impeller region is very
high, and flow gradients are large.
Figure 8. Velocity vectors of stirred tank in the middle plane.
As the high speed fluid jets outward, initially almost not affected by the surrounding fluid, the
velocity contours are dense. The flow impinges on the tank wall, splits up into two parts and
changes the direction. The split water flows at last return to impeller region and accelerated

again, repeating above-mentioned process which generates two circulation loops of different
directions in the upper and lower part of the tank, respectively. It can be observed that the cir‐
culation loop ranges above the z/T value of 0.9, which is consistent with the simulations by Ng
et al. [24] (1998) (Re = 40,000) and Yapici et al. [41] (2008) (Re = 60,236). Reynolds numbers of
previous and present studies can ensure that the flow in a stirred vessel is fully developed tur‐
bulence, so the circulation pattern predictions can be considered properly.
Fig.9 shows the flow field of stirred tank near the impeller tip. It can be noticed that velocity
distributions are not symmetrical about the impeller centre plate (z = 0.1 m), but shift up‐
wards slightly. This result is in agreement with the previous experimental works, that the
impeller is not symmetrically located, the top of the tank is a free surface, and the hub is
present on the top side of the impeller [38, 42-43]. In this study, this detail has been success‐
fully captured in the velocity field near impeller tip, further indicating that momentum
source term approach prediction is in good agreement with experimental results.
Figure 9. Velocity vectors in the middle plane near impeller tip.
3.4. Comparison of power numbers
Table 2 shows the comparison of predicted power numbers with the experimental value.
Here, the experimental power numbers reported by Rushton et al. [44-45], Murthy and Joshi
[22] are applied in the reference. The quantities obtained by SM model through integral ε
based approach are considerably lower than the reported experimental results. Similar re‐
sults have been observed in earlier studies [29, 46-47]. These deviations are usually attribut‐
ed to underestimation of the turbulent quantities associated to the k–ε model [46, 48]. The
power number predictions of integral power based approach in the momentum source term
approach with standard k–ε model and RSM are 5.72 and 5.64, respectively, both between
the experimental data 5.1 and 6.07, so they are better than those of SM.
Fig.10 shows a log-log plot of the experimentally obtained and predicted power numbers for
nine kinds of Reynolds numbers which cover laminar and turbulent flow regimes. It can be ob‐
served that at lower Reynolds numbers the power numbers predicted by momentum source
term approach are in good agreement with the experimental data of Rushton et al. [44].

source term approach, MRF and SM, and the required expenses are shown in Table 3. It can
be seen that momentum source term approach and MRF using steady state simulations need
less computational requirements than SM, and the computational time of momentum source
term approach is the least.

4. Conclusions
An equation to predict the momentum source term is proposed without the help of experimen‐
tal data in the paper. So the momentum source term approach for CFD prediction of the impel‐
ler propelling action has been developed as a tool with predictive capacity. The prediction
results of the approach have been compared with the experimental data, MRF and SM model
predictions in the literatures. The following conclusions can be drawn from the present work:
1.
For the plate blade of the Rushton turbine stirred vessel, the tangential momentum
source added by blade is proposed to be calculated by:
in which u is the linear velocity of the area element on the blade surface dS; v θ is the flu‐
id tangential velocity rotating with the impeller before the fluid was propelled by impel‐
ler; dS is cross-section area of the interface between fluid and the impeller blade. The
radial  friction  force  of  the  impeller  blade  is  proposed  to  be  calculated  approximately
(Wang et al., 2002) as following:
In which f is the friction force in the computational cells, v r is the radial velocity of the fluid.
2.
The numerical comparisons of flow field show that the momentum source term ap‐
proach predictions are in good agreement with the experimental data. It has been also
found that the prediction accuracy of momentum source term approach is better than
MRF and similar to SM, whereas the computational time of momentum source term ap‐
proach is the least of the three.

Chapter 6
Hydrodynamic and Heat Transfer Simulation of
Fluidized Bed Using CFD
Osama Sayed Abd El Kawi Ali
Additional information is available at the end of the chapter
http://dx.doi.org/10.5772/52072
1. Introduction
The nuclear energy is suffering from the lack of public acceptance everywhere mainly due to
the issues relating to reactor safety, economy and nuclear waste. The Fluidized Bed Nuclear
Reactor (FBNR) concept has addressed these issues and tried to resolve such problems. The
FBNR is small, modular and simple in design contributing to the economy of the reactor. It
has inherent safety and passive cooling characteristics. Its spent fuel being small spherical
elements may not be considered nuclear waste, and can be directly used as a source of radiation
for applications in industry and agriculture resulting in reduced environmental impact [1].
With the increase of computational power, numerical simulation becomes an additional tool
to predict the fluid dynamics and the heat transfer mechanism in multiphase flow. A
numerical hydrodynamic and heat transfer model has been developed to simulate the gas
fluidized bed. All of CFD, in one form or another, is based on the fundamental governing
equations of fluid dynamics (continuity, momentum and energy equations). These equa‐
tions  speak  physics.  They  are  mathematical  statements  of  three  fundamental  physical
principals upon which all fluid dynamics is based: mass is conserved, Newton’s second law
and energy is conserved [2].
This chapter aims to study a mathematical modeling and numerical simulation of the hydro‐
dynamics and heat transfer processes in a two-dimensional gas fluidized bed with a vertical
uniform gas velocity at the inlet. The velocity, volume fraction, temperature distribution for
gas phase and particle phase are calculated. Also, gas pressure and a prediction of the average
heat transfer coefficient are also studied.
Such a simulation technique allows performance evaluation for different bed input parame‐
ters, and can evolve into a tool for optimized design of fluidized beds for different industrial use.

The numerical setup consists of a two dimensional fluidized bed filled with particles.The cold
gas enters to the bed to cool the hot particles. Based on conservation equations for both phases
it is possible to predict particles and gas volume fractions, velocity distributions (for gas and
particles), temperature distribution, heat transfer coefficient as well as gas pressure field.
2. General assumptions for the mathematical model
Fluidized beds are categorized as multiphase flow problems. There are currently two ap‐
proaches to model multiphase flow problems as discussed in chapter two. The best overall
balance between computational time and accuracy seems to be achieved by implementing an
Eulerian-Eulerian approach. The following assumptions are introduced into the present
analysis:
1.
The bed is two-dimensional.
2.
Eulerian-Eulerian approach is applied.
3.
The gas has constant physical properties.
4.
Uniform fluidization.
5.
Constant input fluid flux.
6.
There is no mass transfer or chemical reaction between the two phases.
7.
All particles are spherical in shape with the same diameter,dp.
8.
The expanded bed region is considered in the analysis in addition to the out flowing gas,
i.e. suspension and free board regions.
9.
Viscous heat dissipation in the energy equation is negligible in comparison with conduc‐
tion and convection.
3. Governing equations
Due to the high particle concentration in fluidized beds the particles interactions cannot be
neglected. In fact the solid phase has similar properties as continuous fluid. Therefore, the
Eulerian approach is an efficient method for the numerical simulation of fluidized beds.
A hydrodynamic and thermal model for the fluidized bed is developed based on schematic
diagram shown in Figure (1). The principles of conservation of mass, momentum, and energy
are used in the hydrodynamic and thermal models of fluidization. The general mass conser‐
vation equations and the separate phase momentum equations and energy equations (for each
phase) for fluid–solids, nonreactive transient and two-phase flow will be discussed in the
following sections.

3.3.1. Relation between fluid and particle velocities
We assume that both particles and fluid are regarded as being incompressible. This was
justified on the basis that only a gas phase is going to exhibit any significant compressibility,
and the orders of magnitude differences in particle and fluid density for gas fluidization render
quite insignificant the small change in gas density resulting from compression. This assump‐

tion led to the relation linking fluid and particle phase velocities at all location. By applying

Equation (12) shows that the total flux (fluid plus particles) in x- direction and y-direction
remains constant, equal to that of fluid entering the bed Ugin,Vgin. This result is a simple
consequence of the particles and fluid being considered incompressible :

Equations (13) and (14) enable the fluid velocity variables to be expressed in terms of the

3.3.2. Combined momentum equation
In this section the combined momentum equation is produced by combining the fluid and
particle momentum equations (4), (5), (8) and (9) by elimination of the fluid pressure gradient,
which appears in them. This yields the combined momentum equation:

3.4.1. Thermal conductivity values (kg and ks)
The thermal conductivities of the fluid phase and the solid phase (kg and ks) in the two fluid
model formulation should be interpreted as effective transport coefficients which means that
the corresponding microscopic (or absolute) coefficients kg,o and ks,o cannot be used. It can be
represented in general as:

However, such a general formulation is not yet available for fluidized beds and approximate

3.4.2. Interphase volumetric heat transfer coefficient hv
The heat transfer coefficient is modelled using a correlation by Gunn as reported [5]. This
correlation is applicable for gas voidage in the range of 0.35 to 1 and for Reynolds numbers up
to Re = 105, and gives the Nusselt number:

4. Boundary and initial conditions
The system of conservation equations (1),(2), (3), (4), (5), (8), (9), (23), and (24), nine equations
which are discussed in previous sections must be solved for the nine dependent variables: the
gas-phase volume fraction εg, the particle-phase volume fraction εs, the gas pressure Pg, the
gas velocity components ug and vg and the solids velocity components us and vs in x-direction
and y-direction, respectively,the gas temperature Tg and particle temperature Ts.We need
appropriate boundary and initial conditions for the dependent variables listed above to solve
the system of equations.
4.1. Boundary conditions
In this section the boundary conditions for the above governing equations, which relate to two
dimensional fluidized bed with width "L" and height "H" to allow bed expansion typically i.e.
the height of the bed is enough to prevent the particles being ejected from the bed. Boundary
conditions are imposed as follow:

4.2. Initial conditions
For setting the initial conditions, the model is divided into two regions: the bed and the
freeboard. For each of the regions specified above, an initial condition is specified.

εg =εg,mf ,
vg =
V g,mf
εg,mf ,
ug =vs =us =0,
Tg =T g,in,
Ts =Ts,in
Freeboard region

vg =V g,mf ,
ug =vs =us =0,
Tg =T g,in
5. Finite difference approximation scheme
The conservation equations are transformed into difference equations by using a finite
difference scheme.

17. End program.
8. Parametric study of the hydrodynamic and thermal results
The present work results show the effect of variation of several bed parameters such as particle
diameter, terminal velocity of the particle, minimum fluidized velocity of the particle input
gas velocity, fluidized material type and heat generation by particles on the hydrodynamic
and thermal behavior of fluidized bed. In this section the effect of different parameters in
hydrodynamic and thermal performance of fluidized bed is analyzed in detail.
8.1. Effect of particle diameter
Particle diameter is the most influential parameter in the overall fluidized bed performance.
In view of that fact, the bed material in a fluidized bed is characterized by a wide range of
particle diameter, so that the effect of particle diameter is analyzed in details. In this section
particle diameter is changed from 100 μm to 1000 μm for sand as fluidized material to study
the effect of particle diameter on the fluidization performance.
One of the important parameter of the fluidized bed study is the total pressure drop across the
bed. Although it is constant after beginning of fluidization and equal to the weight of the bed
approximately. But its value changes with change of particle diameter.The effect of change of
particle diameter on total pressure drop is very important in design and cost of fluidized bed.
Figure (4) shows that effect for sand particles of different diameters (100, 200, 300, 400, 500,
600, 700, 800, 900 and 1000 μm). It is clear that the pressure drop increase with increase of
particle diameter, which means that small particle is betters in design of fluidized bed cost.
A key parameter in the Thermal analysis of fluidized bed is the average heat transfer coeffi‐
cient. Figure (5) shows the variation of average heat transfer coefficient with the time for
different particles diameter from 100 to 1000 μm sand particles.It is observed from the figure
that particles with small size show higher values of average heat transfer coefficient. The
particles with diameter 100 μm show higher for average heat transfer coefficient reaches to
about 3 times of particles with diameter 1000 μm.
Particles diameter determines the type of particles on Geldart diagram, consequently the
behavior of the fluidized bed.
Figures from (6) to (13) illustrate the effect of particles diameter on hydrodynamic and thermal
behavior for particle type-B. These figures explain the high disturbance in different bed

parameters (εg, ρsus,vg,vs,ug,us,Tg,Ts) due to the bubbles formation. The disturbance decreases
with increase of particles diameter. This may be due to come near D-type under uniform
fluidization.
Fluidized bed is used for wide range of particle diameter. It is better to fluidize particle Dtype
in spouted bed to decrease the pressure drop. However, using uniform fluidization for D type
give a good and stable thermal behavior of fluidized bed. So in some applications like nuclear
reactors the stability and safety is important than cost of pumping power.
Figures from (14) to (21) show the effect of change particle diameter on hydrodynamic and
thermal behavior for particle D-type. For this particles type, the behavior of fluidized bed is
more uniform in performance than B-type [be consistent with usage and define what the
different types are]. Although D-type gives butter fluidization in spouted bed but it gives good
performance under uniform fluidization with high pressure drop as shown in figure (4). This
means an increase in pumping power and costs to achieve uniform fluidization.

8.2. Effect of input gas velocity
In this section the input gas velocity is changed from one to nine times minimum fluidized
velocity for 500 μm sand particles to study the the effect of this parameter on fluidization behavior.
Input gas velocity has an effective role in thermal performance of the fluidized bed. In order
to illustrate its effect, the relation between Nusselt number and flow number is described in
figure (22). It is clear from this figure that with increase in flow numbers, the Nusselt number
increases until reached an optimum flow number where the Nusselt number reaches its
maximum value. After this optimum value the increase in flow number is associated with a
decrease in Nusselt number. This decrease in Nusselt number may be due to the increase of
input gas velocity toward the terminal velocity, consequently the bed goes to be empty bed.
Figure (23) shows the variation of Nusselt number with velocity number. Also the relation
between Nusselt number and velocity number has the same trend as the Nusselt number with
flow number. This confirms the result from figure (22). This means that there is an optimum
input gas velocity to yield the best heat transfer characteristics. This velocity is the target of
the fluidized bed designer. The value of this velocity depends on the fluidized gas properties,
the fluidized material, particle diameter, and bed geometry.
8.3. Effect of fluidized material type
Type of fluidized material controls hydrodynamic and thermal performance of fluidized bed.It
affects on the different parameters of fluidization such as gas volume fraction, suspension
density, gas velocity distribution and particle velocity distribution, gas phase temperature and
particle phase temperature. In this section different types of materials such as sand, marble,
lead, copper, aluminum and steel of particle diameters 1mm are used to study the effect of
fluidized materials on the bed performance.
Figure (24) shows the change of gas volume fraction with time for different types of fluidized
materials. The figure shows that the gas volume fraction of copper is the highest value

183

followed by lead and steel. Gas volume fraction of sand, marble and aluminum are at the
same level.
The change of suspension density with time for several types of fluidized materials is shown
in Figure (25). It is clear that the highest suspension density lies with the material of the highest
density.
Figures (26) to (29) show the effect of change of fluidized material type on horizontal and
vertical velocities of gas and particle.
Figures (30) and (40) illustrate the effect of change of fluidized material type on particle and
gas temperatures.

8.4. Effect of heat generation by particles
The aluminum particles of 1 mm diameter are fluidized with different value of heat generated
in particles (0, 500,1000,1500,2000 and 3000 Watt), the effect of change of heat generated in
particles is studied. With the increase of heat generated by particles the gas phase tempera‐
ture increases as shown in Figure (32). The value of the increase in gas temperature is
approximately in range of 3 °C. Figure (33) shows that the particle phase temperature increases
with the increase of heat generated by particles. The range of increase is about 45°C. It is
clear that the rate of increase in particle temperature is more than the rate of increase in gas
temperature, consequently the temperature difference between the two phases increase.
Figure (34) illustrates the relation between average heat transfer coefficient and heat generated
by particles. The results of the present work shows that the average heat transfer coeffi‐
cient dos not depend on heat generated by particles and all heat generated by particles
converts to temperature difference between the two phases. This result agrees with that of
reference [9].

8.5. Terminal velocity effect
Figure (35) shows the relation between terminal velocity and average heat transfer coefficient.
It is clear from the figure that with the increase in terminal velocity the average heat transfer
coefficient decreases.
8.6. Minimum fluidized velocity effect
Minimum fluidized velocity is the most important parameter in study of fluidization. This
velocity distinguishes the fluidized bed from a packed bed and is an indicator that fluidization
is occurred. Figure (36) shows the variation of average heat transfer coefficient with minimum
fluidized velocity. The average heat transfer coefficient decreases with the increase of mini‐
mum fluidized velocity.
