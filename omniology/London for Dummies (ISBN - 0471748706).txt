London For Dummies, 4th Edition

Introduction
F
or all its historic panache, time-honored traditions, quaint corners,
and associations with royal pomp and ceremony, London is very
much a modern European city. London is a rich blend of the very old and
the very new — from the 900-year-old Tower of London to the 6-year-old
Tate Modern gallery. And the city is big, in both size and population; more
than 9 million people reside in the 622-square-mile megalopolis known
as Greater London.
For first-time visitors, London can be a bit of a challenge. If you have a
bit of advance planning and some useful information under your belt,
making the trip will be easier than you thought. London may be far from
where you live, but for many people, a trip to England is like going home.
About This Book
London For Dummies, 4th Edition, is meant to be used as a reference. You
can start at the first page and read all the way through. If you do, you’ll
end up with an unusually complete knowledge of London essentials. On
the other hand, you may not need parts of this book because you’ve
already been to London or know the basics of international travel. You’re
after quick, easy-to-find specifics. In that case, you can easily flip to the
part that you need or home in on a specific chapter. The philosophy
behind this book is quite simple: I wanted to create the kind of guide
that I wished I’d had on my first trips to London — informative, practi-
cal, down-to-earth, and fun.
When you travel, unexpected surprises create the most memorable
moments and provide the stories that you take back with you. But the
other side of travel is details and planning. Questions about where to 
eat and sleep aren’t small issues when you’re away from home. They 
can make or break a trip — I know that. So what I offer here is based on
my own experience in traveling, living, and working in London.
You should know, however, that travel information is subject to change
at any time — especially prices. Therefore, I suggest that you write or

Conventions Used in This Book
I recently tried to extract some information from a guidebook and found
so many symbols that I needed training in hieroglyphics to interpret them
all. I’m happy to report that the user-friendly London For Dummies, 4th
Edition, travel guide isn’t like that. I keep the use of symbols and abbre-
viations to a minimum, as follows:
 The credit card abbreviations are AE (American Express), DC (Diners
Club), MC (MasterCard), and V (Visa).
 I include the London postal area (SW7, for example) in all street
addresses, in case you want to look up the street in a London A to Z
or other London street reference map.
 I give the nearest Tube/Underground (subway) stop for all destina-
tions (for example, Tube: Piccadilly Circus).
 I list all prices first in British pounds sterling (£), and then in U.S.
dollars ($) rounded to the nearest dollar (when prices are under
$10, I round them to the nearest nickel). Although the exchange
rate fluctuates daily, in this book, I use the rate £1 = $1.85.
 The London city code, 020, precedes all London telephone num-
bers in this book (a different code applies in a few cases). The local
London number follows the city code. If you’re calling London from
outside the United Kingdom, you must dial the U.K. country code
(44), followed by 20 and the local number. If you’re calling London
from elsewhere within the United Kingdom, dial 020 before the
number. If you’re calling London from within London, just dial the
local number.
I also apply a few conventions to the listings of hotels, restaurants, and
attractions, as follows:
 I list the hotels, restaurants, and top attractions in alphabetical
order, so you can easily move among the maps, worksheets, and
descriptions.
 For those hotels, restaurants, and attractions that you can find on 
a map in this book, I include a page reference in the listing informa-
tion. If a hotel, restaurant, or attraction is outside the city limits or
in an out-of-the-way area, it may not be mapped.
 I give exact prices for every hotel, restaurant, and attraction. Please
note, however, that prices are subject to change, and an additional
17.5 percent VAT (value-added tax) is added to restaurant meals and
may be added to hotel bills. (I note in the individual hotel listings if
the price does not include the VAT.)
 I use a system of dollar signs ($) to show a range of costs for hotels
or restaurants. The dollar signs for hotels correspond to rack rates
(nondiscounted standard rates) and reflect a hotel’s low to high
London For Dummies, 4th Edition 
2

rates for a double room. For restaurants, the dollar signs denote
the average cost of dinner for one person, including appetizer, main
course, dessert, a nonalcoholic drink, tax, and a tip. Check out the
following table to decipher the dollar signs:
Cost
Hotel
Restaurant
$
$175 or under
$25 or under
$$
$176–$275
$26–$40
$$$
$276–$375
$41–$60
$$$$
$376–$475
$61 and up
$$$$$
$476 and up
 I divide the hotels into two categories — my personal favorites and
those that don’t quite make my preferred list but still get my hearty
seal of approval. Don’t be shy about considering these “runner-up”
hotels if you can’t get a room at one of my favorites or if your pref-
erences differ from mine — the amenities that the runners-up offer
and the services that each provides make all these accommoda-
tions good choices to consider as you determine where to rest your
head at night.
Foolish Assumptions
As I wrote this book, I made some assumptions about you and what your
needs may be as a traveler. You may be an inexperienced traveler look-
ing for guidance when determining whether to take a trip to London and
how to plan for it. You may be an experienced traveler, but you don’t
have a lot of time to devote to trip planning, or you don’t have a lot of
time to spend in London after you get there — you want expert advice
on how to maximize your time and enjoy a hassle-free trip. Or you may
be looking for a carefully selective guidebook, one that focuses only on
the places that will give you the best or most unique experiences in
London. If you fit any of these criteria, then London For Dummies, 4th
Edition, gives you the information that you’re looking for!
How This Book Is Organized
This book has six parts, plus an appendix. You can read all the parts
independently — so if you want to zero in on restaurants or hotels, you
can turn right to that part. Or you can read the book sequentially to find
out all that you need to know about planning and visiting the City by the
Thames. The parts include the following.
Part I: Introducing London
This part introduces London and gives you some excellent reasons for
going there. I give you a rundown of the best London has to offer, from
Introduction 3

hotels to historic sights, and then take you deeper into the city’s culture,
providing information to help you appreciate London’s history, architec-
ture, and cuisine. You can use this part to help you decide on the best
time of year for your visit, and I recommend some books and movies
that may whet your appetite and increase your enjoyment.
Part II: Planning Your Trip to London
This part helps take some of the wrinkles out of trip planning. First, 
you can get some tips on managing your money and planning a realistic
budget. You can also find information on getting to London by air or by
crossing over (or under) the English Channel from Europe. Included 
here are all the options for airlines, tips on how to get the best fare, plus
the lowdown on package tours and whether they can save you money. I
provide special tips for families, travelers with disabilities, seniors, and
gays and lesbians. This part also covers the details that you need to take
care of or consider before your trip begins — from passports to health
insurance.
Part III: Settling into London
This part tells you what you need to know after you arrive. A bit of orien-
tation is in order, including detailed information on the ways, means, and
costs of getting from the airport into the city. The thumbnail sketches of
London neighborhoods can help you decide where you want to stay and
what areas you may want to explore. You can find everything that you
need to know about getting around town — whether you travel on foot,
on the public transit, or in a taxi. I explain what kind of accommodations
you can expect for your money and describe London’s best hotels and
B&Bs. After that, I talk about the city’s dining scene, provide you with 
an appetizing survey of London’s best restaurants, and provide a list of
places for quick, casual meals; simple or glamorous teas; down-to-earth
fish-and-chips joints; and picnic possibilities.
Part IV: Exploring London
This part is dedicated to seeing the sights — from the absolute must-sees
to lesser-known haunts — and fascinating places that are only a quick
train or Tube ride away. You can find all kinds of guided tours and 
shopping coverage that steers you to a whole range of big stores (yes,
including Harrods) and small specialty shops. I also provide four sample
itineraries that maximize your sightseeing but won’t leave you gasping
for breath. And if you want to explore beyond London, check out my five
great day trips — to Bath, Stonehenge, and more.
Part V: Living It Up after Dark: London Nightlife
This part introduces you to the performing arts, with an emphasis on
London’s fabulous theater scene, and all manner of after-dark entertain-
ment possibilities. I clue you in to the best sources for finding out what’s
going on around town and tell you how to get tickets. I also fill you in on
some of the city’s best pubs, clubs, bars, and discos.
London For Dummies, 4th Edition

Part VI: The Part of Tens
This part allows me to squeeze in some extra people, places, and things
that you may want to know about but that don’t really fit in elsewhere 
in the book. My lists include ten famous London statues, ten special
London churches, ten historic pubs, and ten important royals –– past
and present.
Quick Concierge
This appendix includes an A-to-Z directory of fast facts that you need to
know, such as how the telephone system works, what numbers to call in
an emergency, and what taxes you must pay. I also provide a list of toll-
free telephone numbers and Web sites for airlines and hotel chains serv-
ing London, and tell you where to go for more information on London.
Icons Used in This Book
These five icons appear in the margins throughout this book:
Bargain Alert is my favorite icon — and I suspect it may be yours, too.
I’m not cheap, but I love to save money and find out about special deals.
Every time I tell you about something that can save you money, I include
the Bargain Alert icon.
The Best of the Best icon highlights the best London has to offer in all
categories — hotels, restaurants, attractions, shopping, and nightlife.
I’m not an alarmist, so you won’t find too many Heads Up icons in this
book. If you see one, it means that I want you to be aware of something,
such as ticket agencies claiming to sell “reduced-price tickets” or the
double-tipping scam that you may encounter in a restaurant. London,
you’ll be pleased to know, isn’t the kind of city that requires too many
warning labels.
Traveling with children? Keep your eyes peeled for the Kid Friendly icon.
If the icon is in front of a hotel name, the hotel welcomes families with
children and may even provide extras for kids. If it’s in front of a restau-
rant name, the kids will enjoy the food or the atmosphere, and the staff
will be welcoming to youngsters. And if the icon is in front of an attrac-
tion name, kids will (probably) enjoy something about the place.
When was the last time you read a travel book that filled you in on local
gossip, as well as all the mundane facts? For the London Tattler icon
(named after the famous London newspaper, The Tatler, published from
1709 to 1711), I include only the most newsworthy scandals — I mean
stories — to report on. I throw in these tidbits about well-known
Londoners and curious bits of London lore just for the fun of it.
Introduction 5

The Tip icon highlights useful bits of information that can save you time
or enhance your London experience. A Tip alerts you to something (like
a special guided tour or a way to avoid standing in long lines) that you
may not otherwise consider or even know about.
Where to Go from Here
To London, of course! This book, which gives you the tools you need to
make the most of your trip, is a very good place to start your journey.
Because the book covers all the basics, it’s an excellent guide to help
you plan, anticipate, and understand exactly what you want to see and
do in London. Whatever your plan, I hope that you think of me as your
guide or companion on the journey. I love London. My goal is to help
you have a great time while you’re there.

Chapter 1
Discovering the 
Best of London
In This Chapter
 Discovering London’s greatest historic landmarks
 Exploring London’s world-famous museums
 Tasting the best of British cuisine
 Enjoying London’s performing arts and nightlife
 Experiencing the urban charms of London
S
o, you’re going to London. Gives you a thrill just thinking about it,
right? The capital of the U.K. is one of the world’s top destinations,
visited year-round by millions from all corners of the globe. In fact, inter-
national travel surveys consistently rank London as one of the most
popular holiday destinations in the world. After you arrive, you can
make your way through one of the most historic, cultured, and exciting
cities on earth. You have every reason to feel a tingle of anticipation.
This chapter gives you an at-a-glance reference to the absolute best —
the best of the best — that London has to offer. In the categories that I
outline, you’ll find some of the things that make visiting London so much
fun and so endlessly fascinating. I discuss each of these places in detail
later in this book; you can find them in their indicated chapters, marked
with a “Best of the Best” icon.
The Best Places to Soak Up London’s History
The great historic landmarks in London never fail to stir the imagination:
They’ve been witness to so much — from glorious triumphs to bloody
tragedies — that it’s almost impossible to remain unmoved when visiting
them. In Chapter 11, you’ll find more details on the sites listed in this
section:
 An almost perceptible aura of legend pervades the Tower of
London, which was built over 900 years ago. When visiting the
Tower, you walk on a piece of ground where the great dramas and

terrors of a turbulent kingdom were played out, where Elizabeth I
was held captive while still a princess, and where Sir Thomas More
and Anne Boleyn (second wife of Henry VIII and mother of the
future Elizabeth I) were beheaded.
 No less venerable is Westminster Abbey, a magnificent Gothic
church that ranks as the most historically significant religious
structure in England. Stepping into Westminster Abbey, you enter
the place where England’s kings and queens have been crowned
since William the Conqueror claimed the throne in 1066 and where
some of England’s greatest figures are buried or memorialized.
 Most of London’s most historic sites are or were Royal domains,
and Royal watching is a sport almost as popular as horse racing.
Okay, so you’re probably not going to get invited to the Queen’s
Garden Party, but you can see where those famous parties take
place — and stroll through the Royal staterooms — by visiting
Buckingham Palace, the queen’s London residence and a seat of
today’s Royal power and intrigue.
 If you missed the Changing of the Guard at Buckingham Palace or
want another dose of that Royal pomp and pageantry, Windsor
Castle is less than an hour away. Reputedly the queen’s favorite
castle, Windsor has a 900-year history that stretches back to the
time of William the Conqueror. Many of the rooms that you visit
today were remodeled in the time of Queen Victoria.
 Hampton Court Palace is one of the most magnificent of former
Royal palaces, and you can easily get there in 30 minutes by train
from Central London (or, more romantically, by taking a boat on 
the Thames). In addition to visiting dozens of staterooms in this
16th-century Tudor palace where Henry VIII once resided, you can
enjoy the splendid gardens with their famous maze.
 Although you can’t see the rooms where the late Princess Diana
actually lived, you can get into her former home, Kensington Palace,
situated at the western side of Kensington Gardens. In addition to
the vast, visitable staterooms, this mostly 18th-century palace,
where Victoria was born in 1819, houses a remarkable costume
exhibit that includes Royal raiment through the ages.
 Occupying a spot right on the River Thames, the Houses of Parlia-
ment and their landmark clock tower containing Big Ben, have been
a familiar sight to Londoners for nearly 150 years. In the summer,
fascinating tours of this seat of power let you see the House of
Commons and the House of Lords. Or you can just admire the
buildings from the outside and wait for the hourly boom of Big Ben.
 St. Paul’s Cathedral with its landmark dome is dear to the hearts of
Londoners and is used for events of national significance. A master-
piece by the architect Sir Christopher Wren, the cathedral was built
following the Great Fire that swept through London in 1666.

The Best Museums
If you’re a dedicated museum maven, London’s selection will keep you
going for days, weeks, months, even years. This city is loaded with every
conceivable kind of treasure from all over the world. And, amazingly
enough, entrance to all the great national museums is free. You can read
more about all of London’s top museums in Chapter 11:
 The venerable British Museum, with its unparalleled collection of
antiquities, comes out on top — the magnificent Parthenon sculp-
tures (formerly called the Elgin Marbles) understandably hold pride
of place there, but you’ll be amazed by the superlative Egyptian
and Roman collections, as well as the ancient treasures found in
England.
 The National Gallery houses the nation’s greatest collection of
British and European paintings from the 13th to the 20th centuries.
Here, you find works by Italian masters, such as Leonardo da Vinci
and Raphael; canvases by every great French Impressionist; a stun-
ning Rembrandt collection; and paintings by great British artists,
such as Turner and Constable.
 If you tire of the great Western European masterworks hanging 
in the National Gallery, you can walk next door to see images of
pop icons like Elton John and Princess Di in the National Portrait
Gallery. Here, you’ll find a visual who’s who of every famous Brit 
in history, captured in paint, stone, bronze, and photographs.
 Keen on decorative and applied arts? Then head over to the
Victoria & Albert Museum, a linchpin in the cluster of great South
Chapter 1: Discovering the Best of London 11
Pomp, ceremony, and scandal: The Royals
In London, the Royals are spied on the way movie stars are in America. The paparazzi
furor lessened a bit after Princess Diana’s death, but it still exists.
I never really gave much thought to royalty, except as a footnote to history, until one
day several years ago. I was passing St. James’s Palace just as Princess Diana and
Princess Anne were being hustled into a waiting limo. There they were, two
princesses, going about the mysterious routines of royalty. I saw them for maybe three
seconds and stood there like a slack-jawed yokel as the limo pulled away.
From the Queen on down, the monarchy is a huge business (they actually call them-
selves “The Firm”), and you can’t avoid it. Buy a London paper any day that you’re
there, and you can find some juicy tidbit about Prince Charles, his new wife Camilla
Parker-Bowles (the Duchess of Cornwall), Prince William, Prince Andrew, Prince
Harry, Princess Anne, or some other member of The Firm. (I provide a few juicy items
of my own in this book with my “London Tattler” asides.)

Kensington museums. The V&A, as it’s called, houses wonderfully
decorated period rooms, a comprehensive fashion collection, Italian
Renaissance sculpture, and acres more.
 The other two outstanding museums in South Kensington are the
Natural History Museum and the Science Museum. Animatronic
dinosaurs, including a hungry T. Rex, are the cold-blooded stars 
in the Natural History Museum’s famed dinosaur exhibit, but while
you’re there, check out the mind-boggling collection of gems. In 
the Science Museum, you come face to face with legends from the
world of science and technology.
 London’s South Bank is really buzzing with the addition of the stun-
ning Tate Modern. Housed in a former power station on the river,
the museum exhibits an international roster of contemporary greats.
 Tate Britain holds the world’s greatest collection of British art.
Wander through rooms filled with works by William Blake, Turner,
Hogarth, Sir Joshua Reynolds, Constable, and all the Pre-Raphaelites.
 London lovers will love the Museum of London, probably the
world’s most comprehensive city museum, which features an amaz-
ing collection of Roman antiquities (the museum incorporates part
of a 2,000-year-old Roman wall) and tells the fascinating story of
London through the ages.
 You can also enjoy masterpieces in museums that were built as pri-
vate palaces, such as Spencer House, former home of Princess
Diana’s family; Apsley House, home of the first Duke of Wellington;
and Hertford House, home of the Wallace Collection, a national
museum.
The Best of British Cuisine
Once upon a time, you could always count on getting lousy meals in
London. The nation’s dull, insular, uninspired cooking was the joke of
Europe. That reputation began to change in the 1980s, with the influx of
new cooking trends that favored foods from France and Italy. Since then,
London has become a food capital (allegedly with more Michelin-starred
restaurants than Paris). You can find my list of top London restaurants
in Chapter 10. For a handy reference guide to English cuisine, see the
Cheat Sheet at the front of this book:
 London is the best place to find restaurants serving inventive
Modern British cuisine. Reserve a table at Rules, The Ivy, Langan’s
Bistro, Veronica’s, The Oratory, or Boxwood Café — to name just
a few — and let your taste buds do the talking.
 Traditionalists need not despair: All those wonderful “Old English”
faves are still around — eggs, kippers, beans, and fried tomatoes
for breakfast; bubble and squeak; roast beef and Yorkshire pudding;
Part I: Introducing London 
12

meat pies; fish and chips; toad in the hole; cottage pie; sticky toffee
pudding; and trifle. You’ll find the old English comfort foods at pubs
and restaurants such as The Stockpot, Founders Arms, Simpson’s-
in-the-Strand, Porter’s English Restaurant, and many others.
 Some would say that Indian cooking is the new national cuisine of
England. Well, it’s certainly one of multiethnic London’s faves, and
Indian restaurants are often far more affordable. Like other cuisines,
Indian cooking in England has been undergoing many changes.
Veeraswamy is the oldest Indian restaurant in London, but the 
interior is cool and contemporary. You can also find great Indian
cooking at Mela and Noor Jahan.
 If French cooking is your idea of heaven, you don’t lack for dining
options in London. Both traditional and nouvelle French restaurants
remain alive and well. You may want to try the classiest of them all,
Aubergine; other choices include Oxo Tower Brasserie, with its
stunning river views, Criterion Grill, or Brasserie St. Quentin.
 And don’t forget that London boasts more ethnic restaurants than
anywhere else in the U.K., so almost any kind of cuisine can be on
the tip of your tongue. For delectable tapas and Spanish/Moroccan
food, go to Moro. For slurpy and superlative Japanese noodles, head
for Wagamama. At Ken Lo’s Memories of China, you can feast on
food inspired by a Chinese master chef. For fresh New Zealand
mussels and the most delicious New Zealand dessert, known as
Pavlova, Suze in Mayfair is your best bet.
The Best Places to Shop in London
It’s not just my credit cards speaking: I’m here to tell you that London is
one of the world’s great shopping cities — possibly the greatest. Why?
The sheer variety of what’s available.
Trend-setting London is to the United Kingdom what New York City 
is to the United States: the place where it happens first (or ultimately 
ends up). London is where you can put the eyeball on what’s hot, British
style. You see the latest hardcore street fashions side by side with the
quintessentially traditional.
Not into new? In London, you can hunt for an old engraving, try on a
cocktail dress from the ’50s, paw through bric-a-brac at an outdoor
market stall, or wander through the London silver vaults in your quest
for a Georgian soup ladle.
For my complete rundown of London shopping, see Chapter 12:
 Is Harrods the most famous department store in the world? Quite
possibly so. See for yourself if it deserves all the hype. And be sure
to visit the Food Halls.
Chapter 1: Discovering the Best of London 13

 Fortnum & Mason is the queen’s London grocer, and it’s probably
the only store in the world where you’ll see cans of soup displayed
on wooden shelves along carpeted aisles. Other departments
include china, crystal, leather, antiques, and stationery — plus, 
you can dine at the store’s famous restaurants.
 Shopaholics hold Oxford Street in very high regard. Lined with
major department stores like Selfridges and Marks & Spencer,
and chockablock with dozens upon dozens of moderate to upscale
shops, it’s a rendezvous point for shoppers of all ages from all over
the world. Motto: Big Names, Reasonable Prices.
 Knightsbridge is a flash-and-cash point of the highest order, home
of the aforementioned Harrods, the smaller Harvey Nichols, and a
lot of luxurious designer boutiques where real and wannabe aristo-
crats shop for “the season.”
 Time and money just fly when you visit the super-chic boutiques of
Covent Garden, Bond Street, and King’s Road in Chelsea. In these
certified shopping zones, you can find everything a super-chic fash-
ionista could ever want.
 Hidden away from the hoi polloi, the 200-year-old shops on Jermyn
Street cater to traditionalists who want the finest goods available.
Many of the shops on Jermyn Street have Royal Warrants — that is,
they’re allowed to advertise that they sell to the Royal family. Look
for custom-made shirts and suits, hand-tooled leather shoes, and
fabulous toiletry shops, such as Floris and Taylors of Old Bond
Street.
 What reader wouldn’t be tempted by the wonderland of bookstores
on Charing Cross Road? It’s a reader’s feast and a browser’s para-
dise, with major U.K. independent bookstores like W & G Foyle,
major U.K. chains like Waterstone’s, and smaller specialized book-
stores like Murder One all represented.
The Best of London’s Performing Arts
London is a world capital, and that includes being a world capital of the
performing arts. When the sun goes down, the curtain comes up. For a
description of London’s major performing arts venues, see Chapter 15:
 For many visitors, going to the theater is reason enough to go to
London. When actors of the highest caliber are on the boards — 
as they always are in London — you don’t need to think twice
about going to the theater. You just go. The London theater scene 
is phenomenal, prices are lower than in New York, and seeing a
West End play adds to any trip’s enjoyment. Take your pick: long-
running international-hit musicals, light comedies, hard-hitting
dramas, new works in “fringe” venues, everything from William
Shakespeare to Oscar Wilde to Neil LaBute and beyond.
Part I: Introducing London 
14

 Opera buffs (and buffos) appreciate the fact that London has two
major opera companies. International stars appear at the historic
Royal Opera in Covent Garden, where operas are performed in
their original languages. A few blocks away is the English National
Opera, where every opera is sung in English by mostly British
singers and the productions tend to be more adventuresome.
 Every night, lovers of classical music have an embarrassment of
riches to choose from. London is home to two world-class sym-
phony orchestras. The London Symphony Orchestra plays at the
Barbican Center, where good seats cost as little as £5 ($9.25). The
Royal Philharmonic Orchestra performs at Cadogan Hall and the
Royal Albert Hall. Other renowned London or U.K. orchestras per-
form regularly in the city, as do renowned chamber music ensem-
bles. A summer highlight are the Proms concerts at Royal Albert
Hall, featuring an international roster of the best orchestras and
soloists in the world.
 Dance aficionados can enjoy an evening at the Royal Ballet and/
or the English National Ballet, both of which have regular London
seasons. Smaller dance companies, from traditional to cutting edge,
are at home in venues throughout the city.
The Best Urban Charms
London is one great city that has actually gotten better over the years.
In deference to the millennium year 2000, the city dusted itself off and
tarted itself up in ways that benefit residents and visitors alike. Old
museums have been revamped with stunning results, such as the Great
Court in the British Museum, and new museums, such as Tate Modern,
have opened (see “The Best Museums,” earlier in this chapter). Sleek
new bridges now span the Thames, and riverside areas have seen a
flurry of development. Trafalgar Square has been joined to the National
Gallery, making pedestrian access a breeze rather than a chore. All in all,
London has shaken off its old mantle of hidebound traditionalism, has
embraced multiculturalism, and is now as high-tech as a hyperlink.
But the old fabric of London still remains and invites exploration.
Despite all the improvements in public transit, London remains a city
where walking is a joy that reveals no end of simple urban pleasures:
 London is blessed with marvelous parks. You may have heard of
them: Hyde Park, Kensington Gardens, St. James’s Park, Green
Park, and Regent’s Park (all described in Chapter 11). These care-
fully groomed havens, where you can stroll beneath stately trees,
lounge on the grass, watch ducks in a pond, or admire the color of
the springtime daffodils, were former Royals-only hunting grounds.
Now they’re part of every Londoner’s life and life’s blood, the green
lungs of an otherwise congested city.
Chapter 1: Discovering the Best of London 15

 What could be more fun than just wandering around London’s
streets? Try it. Pick a neighborhood — the City, Soho, Chelsea —
then just stroll at will, taking note of the wealth of architectural
styles, the curious reminders of days gone by, and the array of 
local sights, such as the blue, “famous-person-lived-here” plaques
on house fronts. On some streets, you can almost hear the horses’
hooves clopping on the cobblestones as they did up until about
1915.
 The South Bank and Southwark areas on the “other” side of the
river have been opened up for pedestrians and show off an ancient
area of London that’s been completely revitalized. You can enjoy a
waterside walk with city views from Westminster Bridge to Tower
Bridge.
 The variety of architectural styles adds to the beauty of the city.
Because the Great Fire of 1666 burned down most of medieval
London, the building and house styles that you see tend to range
from the sober neoclassical of the early 18th century, to the more
elegantly light-hearted Regency style of the early 19th century, to
the heavier and less graceful Victorian period of the mid- to late
19th century. The human scale of London streets, with their long
terraces of attached brick, stone, and stucco homes built around
leafy squares, gives the city a charm and character that intrigues
and delights the eye. London grew from a series of villages, and 
you can still find that villagelike character in many London neigh-
borhoods (for a list of those neighborhoods, see Chapter 8, and 
for more on London architecture, see Chapter 2).

T
his chapter helps you find out more about London and deepens your
experience of England. I distill the essence of London’s complicated
and tumultuous past so you can get a clear, quick sense of the major
epochs. Then I highlight the main architectural trends, whet your appetite
with a primer on English food and drink, and recommend some excellent
books and movies about the capital of the U.K.
The Main Events: A Brief History of London
London’s history is inextricably intertwined with the larger history of
England. Endless tomes have been written on individual monarchs, col-
orful personalities, architectural styles, and historical epochs in English
history. But I’m going to be as brief as a bikini and give you a history
that covers only the bare essentials in the following sections.
Pre-history and the arrival of the Romans
Over 2,500 years ago, a Celtic tribe was living beside the River Thames
in the region that would later become London.
When the Romans conquered England in A.D. 43, they suppressed or sub-
dued the local Celts. The legendary Queen Boudicca (or Boadicea) was a
Celtic warrior queen who fought back the invading Romans. You can see
a statue of her on Westminster Bridge in London. The Romans brought
their building and engineering skills to England and erected a 1-square-
mile fort they called Londinium. This square mile eventually became the
City of London, the earliest area to be developed. In the City, you can still
see the remains of Roman walls and a temple where Roman soldiers wor-
shipped a Persian god called Mithras (see Chapter 18).

Northern invaders
With the Roman Empire’s breakup in A.D. 410, Jutes, Angles, and Saxons
from northern Europe invaded England and formed small kingdoms. For
the next 600 years or so, the Anglo-Saxon kingdoms fought off Viking
raiders. The capital of England at this time was in Winchester, in the
Anglo-Saxon kingdom of Wessex. Because of its strategic position on 
the Thames, London grew as an important center of trade.
William the Conqueror
The next major transitional period in England — and London — started
in 1066, when William of Normandy (1028–1087) fought and killed Harold,
the Anglo-Saxon king of England, at the Battle of Hastings. William and
his French nobles took over the land, moved their power base to London,
and built fortified castles — including Windsor Castle and the Tower 
of London (both described in Chapter 11) — that still stand today. 
Every monarch up to the present day claims descent from William the
Conqueror and, like him, has been crowned at Westminster Cathedral
(Chapter 11) in London.
Magna Carta
King John, a Plantagenet, signed the Magna Carta in 1215, granting more
rights to the nobles. What about the common man and woman? As serfs
and vassals in a closed, hierarchical, class-ridden society, their lot wasn’t
an easy one. Geoffrey Chaucer (1342–1400), who lived and worked in
London, was the first writer to give us some recognizable portraits of
folks who lived during the medieval period, in The Canterbury Tales.
Hundred Years’ War
At home and abroad, war and bloodshed tore England apart for more
than 300 years. The Hundred Years’ War between France and England
began in 1337. There was also the War of the Roses, fought between the
Houses of York and Lancaster.
Tudor and Elizabethan England
Henry VIII, the Tudor king famous for taking six wives, brought about 
the next great shift in what had been Catholic England. In 1534, he dis-
solved all the monasteries and became head of the Church of England.
He nabbed Hampton Court Palace (Chapter 11) from Cardinal Wolsey
and made it one of his royal residences. Henry’s second wife, Anne
Boleyn, was beheaded at the Tower of London in 1536. Henry and Anne
Boleyn’s daughter, Elizabeth I, ruled during a period of relative peace,
power, and prosperity. The Elizabethan period was England’s Golden
Age, the time when Shakespeare’s plays were being performed at the
Globe Theatre (Chapter 15) in London.

Civil War
In 1603, James VI of Scotland became King James I (1566–1625) of England,
uniting the crowns of England and Scotland. But conflicts between mon-
archs and nobles were endless. Charles I (1600–1649), seeking absolute
power, dissolved Parliament in 1629. He was beheaded in London after
Oliver Cromwell (1599–1658) led a bitter civil war between Royalists and
Parliamentarians. Cromwell’s armies destroyed churches and royalist
strongholds throughout the country. Cromwell was elevated to Lord
Protectorate of the Realm, but by 1660 a new king, Charles II (1630–1685),
was on the throne. This time, however, his powers were limited.
Fire, plague, and rebuilding
London, which had been growing steadily, was devastated by two back-to-
back catastrophes, the Great Plague of 1665 and the Great Fire of 1666.
Under the brilliant architect Sir Christopher Wren (1632–1723), a new
London emerged from the ashes of the Great Fire. Brick and stone
replaced timber as the primary building material. Wren’s masterpiece,
St. Paul’s Cathedral (Chapter 11), was built on the site of the old cathe-
dral and dozens of Wren churches were erected in the City of London.
England’s steadily growing naval might was centered at Greenwich
(Chapter 11), where Wren designed the Royal Naval College, today a
UNESCO World Heritage Site.
New lines of succession
When James II (1633–1701) tried to reinstate Catholicism in England, he
was deposed in 1688 and succeeded by his daughter Mary (1662–1694)
and William of Orange (1650–1702), thus assuring a Protestant line of
succession. William and Mary renovated and lived in Kensington Palace
(Chapter 11). The children of Queen Anne (1665–1714), the next monarch,
predeceased her, leaving the kingdom without an heir when Anne died.
George of Hanover (1660–1727) was chosen to be the next king of England,
thus ushering in the reign of the Hannoverians who preceded Victoria.
The Victorian Empire
England reached its zenith of power and prestige during the reign of
Victoria (1837–1901), who ruled over an empire so vast that “the sun
never set” on it. Victoria was born at Kensington Palace and moved to the
grander Buckingham Palace when she was crowned in 1837. Following the
death of her husband, Prince Albert of Saxe-Coburg, the queen had the
Albert Memorial (Chapter 11) erected in Kensington Gardens, where it
still stands.
The Industrial Revolution spawned major societal changes during this
period, moving England away from its agrarian past and into a mecha-
nized future. Charles Dickens (1812–1870) and other social reformers
exposed the wretched working and living conditions in Victorian London
and throughout England. After a fire, the Houses of Parliament were
Chapter 2: Digging Deeper into London 19

rebuilt and reopened in 1857. The late Victorian age was the time of
Sherlock Holmes, a fictional London detective created by Arthur Conan
Doyle, and Jack the Ripper, a real-life serial killer who terrorized London’s
East End.
England in the World Wars
England suffered terrible losses during World War I (1914–1918) but
emerged victorious. During World War II, from the fall of France in 1940
until the United States entered the war in 1941, England stood alone
against Hitler. Winston Churchill (1874–1965), the country’s prime minis-
ter during the war years, frequently held cabinet meetings in a secret
warren of underground rooms called the Cabinet War Rooms (Chapter
11), which are preserved just as they were during his tenure. With
strictly rationed food, mandatory blackouts, and terrible bombing raids
that destroyed whole sections of London and killed tens of thousands of
civilians, life in wartime London had a profound effect on its citizens.
Shortages continued for many years afterward.
The welfare state
A major societal shift occurred in 1945 when the Labour Party began 
to dismantle the empire and introduced the welfare state. Under the
National Health System, every citizen in the United Kingdom can receive
free health care (the quality of the care is another story). It wasn’t until
Margaret Thatcher and the Tory Party came into power during the 1980s
that England began privatizing formerly state-run agencies, such as the
railroad (with what some say are disastrous results).
Queen Elizabeth II
Queen Elizabeth II ascended the throne in 1952. The fairy-tale wedding 
of her son Prince Charles to Lady Diana Spencer at St. Paul’s Cathedral
in 1981 was the last high point for the House of Windsor (which changed
its name from the German Saxe-Coburg during World War II). Charles 
and Diana’s subsequent divorce seemed to unleash a floodgate of Royal
scandals, with the result that the popularity of the British monarchy 
is at an all-time low. Following her divorce, Diana (1961–1997) lived at
Kensington Palace (Chapter 11), where grieving Londoners left a sea of
floral tributes following her death in a car crash.
In 2002, Queen Elizabeth II celebrated her 50th anniversary on the
throne.
London at the millennium
In anticipation of the year 2000, London went on an all-out public-
relations blitz to show the world that “Rule, Britannia” had become
“Cool Britannia.” The giant Millennium Dome was a giant fiasco, but 
the British Airways London Eye (Chapter 11), an enormous observation
wheel, remains one of London’s most popular attractions.

Mayor Ken
In 2000, Ken Livingstone, former Labour Member of Parliament, was
elected to the newly created post of Mayor of London (not to be con-
fused with the Lord Mayor of London, an ancient ceremonial position in
the City of London). During his controversial tenure — he was re-elected
for a second term in 2004 — Mayor Ken has instituted major changes in
the public-transportation system, including the introduction of London’s
congestion charge, a fee that any driver entering Central London during
specific hours of the day must pay.
New Labour
In 2001, Tony Blair was elected to a second term as prime minister, and
New Labour, with its centrist approach, was firmly in control of the gov-
ernment. But in the 2005 elections, the party lost one-third of its seats as
voters expressed their discontent with Blair’s continuing support of the
war in Iraq.
Chapter 2: Digging Deeper into London 21
Recent Royal events
In 2005, Prince Charles, the heir to the British throne, finally married his long-time mis-
tress, Camilla Parker-Bowles, in a ceremony that his mother, Queen Elizabeth, did not
attend. The wedding was something of a highlight — if you can call it that — in a Royal
year full of royal embarrassments. For one thing, it became apparent that the British
public did not want Camilla to be their eventual queen. She will, though, unless the
governments of England and 15 Commonwealth nations change the law. In the mean-
time, the pre-queen is addressed as Her Royal Highness the Duchess of Cornwall.
Earlier in the year, the British public was shocked to see a picture of Prince Harry,
youngest son of Charles and his first wife, Princess Diana, wearing a World War II
German desert uniform with a Nazi swastika on his armband. It seems that the party-
boy prince didn’t realize that wearing such an outfit to a costume party would offend.
Harry was forced to apologize — just about the time a former art teacher charged that
she painted the paintings Harry submitted for his art exams at Eton. Not a minute too
soon, Harry was packed off to Sandhurst Military Academy for the usual pseudo-
military training of a Royal.
Then news erupted that Prince Andrew and Prince Edward, younger sons of Queen
Elizabeth, were in essence receiving royal housing benefits that made them look like
welfare cheats. Andrew (Fergie’s ex), whose wealth is estimated at £13 million ($24 mil-
lion), has paid no annual rent for a 30-room lodge in Windsor Great Park. Edward, with
a fortune estimated at £9 million ($17 million), pays £10,000 ($18,500) a year for a 57-
room house set on 87 acres in Bagshot Park. No wonder the Queen was so eager to
claim that the monarchy — which costs every citizen of the U.K. about $1.12 a year —
provided the British taxpayers with real value for their money. It must have warmed the
heart of every hardworking commoner.

Terrorist bombings
In July 2005, one day after exultant Londoners learned that their city had
been chosen to host the 2012 Olympics, terrorists detonated bombs in
the London Underground and on a double-decker bus, killing 56 people
and wounding hundreds more. Londoners stood together and carried
on, showing the world that they would not be cowed by acts of violence.
A second bombing attempt a week later failed but had tragic conse-
quences when police shot and killed a man suspected of terrorism.
Building Blocks: An Overview 
of English Architecture
The period in which a building was constructed (or reconstructed), is
found in its architectural and decorative details. In a country like England,
where the age of buildings can span a thousand-year period (a few Anglo-
Saxon churches are even older than that), many different styles evolved.
The architectural periods are often named for the monarch or royal
family reigning at the time. You can enhance your enjoyment of London’s
abundance of historic buildings if you know a few key features of the dif-
ferent styles. Keep in mind that little remains from before the Great Fire
of 1666, which destroyed most of London — Westminster Abbey and the
Tower of London are the two most notable exceptions. The following list
gives you a brief primer in English architectural history from Norman to
Victorian times:
 Norman (1066–1189): Round arches, barrel vaults, and highly dec-
orated archways characterize this period’s Romanesque style.
 Early English Gothic (1189–1272): The squat, bulky buildings of
the Norman period gave way to the taller, lighter buildings con-
structed in this style.
 Decorated Gothic (1272–1377): Buildings in this style have large
windows, tracery (ornamental work with branching lines), and
heavily decorated gables and arches.
 Perpendicular Gothic (1377–1483): Large buttresses (exterior side
supports) allowed churches to have larger windows than ever
before. Tracery was more elaborate than in previous Gothic build-
ings, the four-centered arch appeared, and fan vaulting (a decora-
tive form of vaulting in which the structural ribs spread upward
and outward along the ceiling like the rays of a fan) was perfected.
 Tudor (1485–1553): During this period, buildings evolved from
Gothic to Renaissance styles. Large houses and palaces were built
with a new material: brick. England has many half-timbered Tudor
and Elizabethan domestic and commercial buildings. This method
of construction used brick and plaster between visible wooden 
timbers.
Part I: Introducing London 
22

 Elizabethan (1553–1603): The Renaissance brought a revival of
classical features, such as columns, cornices (prominent rooflines
with brackets and other details), and pediments (decorative trian-
gular features over doorways and windows). The many large houses
and palaces of this period were built in an E or H shape and con-
tained long galleries, grand staircases, and carved chimneys.
 Jacobean (1603–1625): In England, Inigo Jones used the symmet-
rical, classically inspired Palladian style that arrived from Italy.
Buildings in this style incorporate elements from ancient Greece
and Rome.
 Stuart (1625–1688): Elegant classical features, such as columns,
cornices, and pediments, are typical of this period, in which Sir
Christopher Wren was the preeminent architect.
 Queen Anne (1689–1714): Buildings from the English baroque
period mix heavy ornamentation with classical simplicity.
 Georgian and Regency (1714–1830): During these periods, elegant
terraced houses were built; many examples survive in Brighton and
Bath. Form and proportion were important elements; interior deco-
ration inspired by Chinese motifs became fashionable.
 Victorian (1830–1901): A whole range of antique styles emerged —
everything from Gothic and Greek Revival to pseudo-Egyptian and
Elizabethan. Hundreds of English churches were renovated during
the Victorian era.
Dining English Style, from 
Traditional to Modern
Not so very long ago, English cooking was the joke of Europe. That began
to change in the 1980s, with the influx of new cooking trends that favored
foods from France and Italy. Since then, London has become a major
food capital, and the rest of the country has raised its food conscious-
ness considerably. London is the best place to find restaurants serving
inventive Modern British and ethnic cuisines of every sort. Spicy Indian
cooking is England’s second “national” cuisine. You can find scores of
Indian and other ethnic restaurants throughout the city.
But traditionalists in search of all those wonderful Old English faves
won’t be at a loss. It’s true that many Londoners now opt for a latte and
a muffin at Starbucks for their breakfast, but you can still find places
that serve a good greasy “fry-up” with eggs, kippers, beans, and fried
tomatoes. And old comfort foods like bubble and squeak (mashed pota-
toes mixed with cabbage) and bangers and mash (sausages with mashed
potatoes) are still around, too. The great traditional “roasts” are served
at places like Simpson’s-in-the-Strand, where a server at your table will
Chapter 2: Digging Deeper into London 23

slice your roast beef or roast lamb and dish up your Yorkshire pudding.
When traditional, nonfancy English dishes are done well, they’re super-
satisfying and delicious.
Other traditional dishes loved by Londoners include meat and fish pies,
shepherd’s pie (ground beef topped with mashed potatoes and baked),
and fish and chips. And for dessert? At restaurants like Porter’s English
Restaurant, you can still find sticky toffee pudding (sponge cake smoth-
ered in warm butterscotch sauce), spotted dick (steamed, raisin-filled
sponge cake covered with custard), and trifle (sherry-soaked sponge
cake layered with raspberry preserves, covered with custard sauce, and
topped with whipped cream).
While you’re in London, you can also look forward to the world of after-
noon tea. Teas can be as simple or fancy as you want — nothing more
than a cup of tea and a pastry in a patisserie, or an elaborate affair with
scones, clotted or whipped cream, preserves, cakes, and sandwiches
served in a luxurious hotel lobby.
See Chapter 10 for a list of my recommended London restaurants and
spots for tea, and check out the Cheat Sheet at the front of this book for
a glossary of English food terms.
Visiting the Local Pub
The pub (short for public house) is an English institution. London is
awash with historic pubs where you can sit all evening with a pint of ale,
bitter, stout, or cider, and soak up the local color. You can even do a pub
crawl, walking (upright) from pub to pub and sampling the diverse
brews on tap. Although you can get a hard drink at both bars and pubs,
when you’re in a pub, you’re better off confining yourself to beer.
Part I: Introducing London 
24
A beer primer: Are you bitter or stout?
Most of the pubs in London and throughout the United Kingdom are tied to a particu-
lar brewery and sell only that brewery’s beers (you see the name of the brewery on
the sign outside). Independent pubs can sell more brands than a tied pub. Either way,
you still have to choose from what may seem like a bewildering variety. The colorful
names of individual brews don’t provide much help — you can only wonder what
Pigswill, Dogs Bollocks, Hobgoblin, Old Thumper, Pommies Revenge, or Boondoggle
taste like. Depending on all sorts of factors — the water, the hops, the fermentation
technique, and so on — the brewery crafts the taste of any beer, whether on draught
or in a bottle. You can get a few U.S. and international brands, but imports are more
expensive than the homegrown products.

Parliament has instituted the strict hours that most pubs adhere to:
Monday through Saturday from 11 a.m. to 11 p.m. and Sunday from noon
to 10:30 p.m. Americans, take note: You don’t have to (and aren’t expected
to) pay a service charge in a pub, and you never tip the bartender; the
best you can do is offer to buy him or her a drink — an acceptable prac-
tice in England. Ten minutes before closing, a bell rings, signaling that
the time has come to order your last round.
Background Check: Finding 
London on Page and Screen
Has any country produced as many great and enduring writers as England
has? It’s impossible in a brief survey to even scratch the surface. The won-
derful thing about London — at least, if you love literature — is that it fig-
ures in so many great works. All over the city, you encounter blue plaques
on the front of buildings identifying what famous person lived there and
when. Many of those famous residents were writers. Here are a few of my
recommendations:
 History of Britain, by Simon Schama: This highly readable three-
volume history of Britain by the noted historian accompanied a
program of the same name on the BBC History Channel.
 London, by Edward Rutherfurd: London is the main character in
this fascinating historical novel that follows the fates of families
and fortunes over 2,000 years.
Chapter 2: Digging Deeper into London 25
When ordering beer in a pub, specify the type, the brand, and the amount (pint or half-
pint) you want. Asking the bartender to recommend something based on your taste
preferences is perfectly okay. Just remember that most English beer is served at room
temperature. The following brief descriptions of beer will come in handy in a pub:
 Bitter is what most locals drink. It’s a clear, yellowish, traditional beer with a strong
flavor of hops. Real ale is a bitter that’s still fermenting (“alive”) when it arrives
from the brewery; it’s pumped and served immediately.
 Ale isn’t as strong as bitter and has a slightly sweeter taste. You can order light
or pale ale in a bottle; export ale is a stronger variety.
 Lager, when chilled, is probably the closest you can come to an American-style
beer. Lager is available in bottles or on draught.
 Shandy is equal parts bitter and lemonade (sometimes limeade or ginger beer); it’s
for those who like a sweet beverage that’s only partially beer-like in taste.
 Stout is a dark, rich, creamy version of ale. Guinness is the most popular brand.
A black and tan is half lager and half stout.

 London: A Biography, by Peter Ackroyd: When you get Peter
Ackroyd going, you can’t shut him up — so it’s a good thing he has
such fascinating material to so endlessly talk about.
 Oliver Twist, by Charles Dickens: Dickens set many of his novels
in London; one of the most enduring is this story of a boy in
Victorian London who survives an almost comically nightmarish
world of orphanages and crime.
 The Cazalet Chronicles, by Elizabeth Jane Howard: The four
novels (The Light Years, Marking Time, Confusion, Casting Off) in
this compulsively readable series chronicle the life of a middle-
class family in London and on the south coast of England between
the two world wars.
 The Line of Beauty, by Alan Hollinghurst: A Booker Prize–winner,
Hollinghurst’s brilliantly realized novel sketches a portrait of
London during the Thatcher years.
 Mrs. Dalloway, by Virginia Woolf: One of Woolf’s most accessible
and popular books, this novel, written in 1925, takes place during
one day in the life of Clarissa Dalloway, an exemplary London host-
ess, as she prepares for a big party.
 Saturday, by Ian McEwan: McEwan’s latest novel evokes the life 
of an upper-middle-class family in London today.
 Watching the English, by Kate Fox: An entertaining pop-psych
book that deals humorously with the “hidden rules” of English
behavior as it relates to class and “Englishness.”
 White Teeth, by Zadie Smith: The profoundly hilarious story of
two immigrant families in North London.

Other useful travel guides
Frommer’s Born to Shop London (Wiley) is a must for travelers eager to cruise London
with a credit card. This book covers everything from top department stores to tiny bou-
tiques and helps you find the best, brightest, most unique, and most quintessentially
English goods.
Frommer’s London from $95 a Day (Wiley) is a time-honored bible for budget-minded
travelers who want to visit London but don’t want to spend a fortune doing so. I can
heartily recommend this book because I wrote it.
Frommer’s Memorable Walks in London (Wiley) is an excellent resource for those
travelers who want to explore the city in depth and on foot. Each walking tour pro-
vides clear, easy-to-follow directions and describes important sights along the way.

The Brits are great filmmakers and beat Hollywood cold when it comes
to honesty in acting, re-creation of period detail, and human-scale cine-
matic storytelling. If you’ve ever watched British television, you know
how completely it differs from American TV. The characters actually
look like human beings and inhabit recognizable worlds.
Over the past 30 years or so, television imports from the BBC and other
U.K. television producers have been shown in the U.S. on Masterpiece
Theatre, Mystery!, and cable channels, winning legions of fans. Many 
of these popular series are set in London. They’re available on video 
and DVD:
 Absolutely Fabulous: Hilarious, over-the-top sitcom about two
over-the-top women in ’90s London.
 Cazalet Chronicles: The fortunes of a middle-class London family
between the world wars.
 The Forsythe Saga: An Edwardian tale of family intrigue.
 Upstairs, Downstairs: Rich London family above, servants below,
and stories from both sides at the turn of the 20th century.
For a cinematic look at London, you may want to check out the follow-
ing films:
 About a Boy: You can see a lot of London shots in this well-told
story of a narcissistic Londoner (Hugh Grant) who becomes surro-
gate father to an awkward boy.
 Closer: A chic anomie pervades the lives of four rather unlikable
characters whose lives intersect in London today.
 Darling: A John Schlesinger film from way back in the 1960s, star-
ring a young Vanessa Redgrave as a fashionable victim of fashion.
 Georgy Girl: London in the swingin’ ’60s with a young, overweight
Lynn Redgrave playing a good-hearted oaf living with a cold-hearted
bitch (Charlotte Rampling).
 Love, Actually: Londoners dealing with contemporary life and
romance.
 Midnight Lace: Doris Day is menaced in London circa 1960 by a
mysterious caller; you can see many shots of the city.
 Notting Hill: A romantic comedy starring Hugh Grant as the owner
of a London bookstore and Julia Roberts as an American movie star
(quite a stretch).
 Sunday, Blood Sunday: An adult drama from the early ’70s star-
ring Glenda Jackson and Peter Finch as Londoners in love with the
same guy.

L
ondon is one of those cities that’s popular year-round. So popular, 
in fact, that according to VisitBritain (formerly the British Tourist
Authority), more than 13.4 million tourists from around the globe visited
London in 2004 (the last year for which figures are available), with nearly
2.8 million of them from the States (17 percent of the total).
Arriving in London at any time of year without advance hotel reserva-
tions is not a wise idea. If you plan to visit between April and mid-
October, making hotel reservations is essential. Although you can find
agencies in London that can help you find a hotel or a B&B in peak
season (see Chapter 9), you never know quite what you’re getting or
where it will be. In Chapter 9, you can find descriptions of my recom-
mended London hotels.
Revealing the Secrets of the Seasons
London weather is what you might call “changeable.” Predicting what
the weather will be like in any given season is difficult. England is an
island, after all, and the seas surrounding it, as well as its northerly loca-
tion, determine its weather patterns. In general, however, the climate 
is fairly mild year-round, rarely dipping below freezing or rising above
80°F/27°C (at least for extended periods). Table 3-1 gives you an idea of
London’s temperature and rainfall variations.

London can be drizzly, muggy, dry and hot, or clammy. It can also be
“glorious, with clear skies and gentle breezes, or bone-chilling cold.
Some days you get a bit of everything: rain, spots of sun, drizzle, clear-
ing, and more rain. But whatever the weather, whatever the season,
London is well worth seeing. The following sections let you know what’s
happening in London, season by season, so that you can pick the best
time to go for you.
Abloom in the spring
London is at its green, blooming best in April and May. Highlights of the
season include the following:
 The great London parks and gardens and the surrounding country-
side are at their peak of lushness. The Chelsea Flower Show is the
quintessential spring event.
 Airfares are lower than in summer.
 The sky stays light well into the evening.
But keep in mind these springtime pitfalls:
 During the half-term school holidays in late February and for three
weeks around Easter, visitors pour into London. As a result, the
major attractions have longer lines (queues in Britspeak), and you
may have a harder time finding a hotel room.
 The weather is always unpredictable.
Chapter 3: Deciding When to Go 29

 Public transportation is reduced during holiday periods.
 Many museums, stores, and restaurants close on Good Friday,
Easter, and Easter Monday.
Summer fun in the sun
Notoriously chilly London becomes irresistible under the sun. Many
tourists flock to London throughout the summer to enjoy the fine
weather, but that fine weather can turn into rain or a fine, gray drizzle in
July and August. The crowds descend in summer for several reasons:
 Everyone moves outdoors at the slightest hint of fine weather, and
London buzzes with alfresco theaters, concerts, and festivals (see
Chapter 15).
 The evenings are deliciously long and often cool, even if the day
has been hot.
 The evening stays light until 10 p.m. or even later.
But keep in mind:
 If you believe the weather statistics, July and August are the
months of highest rainfall in London, so skies can stay gray and
cloudy.
 Occasional summer heat waves can drive the mercury into the 80s
and even 90s, making July and August hot and muggy. Many busi-
nesses and budget-class hotels don’t have air-conditioning.
 Aggravated by London’s soot, plus gas and diesel fumes, a hot spell
can lead to excessive air pollution.
 Most overseas visitors (30 percent of travelers) converge on the
city from July to September. Lines for major attractions can be
interminably long.
 Centrally located hotels are more difficult to come by, and their
high-season rates apply.
 Booking your hotel in advance is essential during this time of year
(see Chapter 9).
Chock-full of culture in the fall
The golden glow of autumn casts a lovely spell over London. The air is
crisp, and the setting sun gives old stone buildings and church spires a
mellow patina. Fall is my favorite time of year to be in London, and I can
think of only one disadvantage to counteract the many advantages,
which include the following:
 After mid-September, fewer tourists are around, so the city feels
less crowded and you encounter more Londoners than visitors.
Part I: Introducing London 
30

 With the drop in tourism, hotel rates and airfares may go down 
as well.
 London’s cultural calendar springs to life.
 Although you may experience rain at this time of year, you’re just
as likely to encounter what Americans call “Indian summer.”
One thing to look out for: Like every season in England, autumn can
bring rain.
Wonderful in winter
Londoners love to be cozy, and there’s no better time for coziness than
winter. Although most overseas visitors to London arrive during the
warmer months, the number of visitors from within the United Kingdom
is highest between January and March. What do they know that you
should know? Consider the points that make winter wonderful:
 London in winter is a bargain. London’s off-season is November 1 to
December 12 and December 25 to March 14. Winter off-season rates
for airfares and hotels can sometimes be astonishingly low — airline
package deals don’t get any cheaper (see Chapter 5). At these times,
hotel prices can drop by as much as 20 percent. If you arrive after
the Christmas holidays, you can also take advantage of London’s
famous post-Christmas sales (more on these sales in Chapter 12).
 Although the winter winds may blow, nothing in London stops — 
in fact, everything gets busier. The arts — theater, opera, concerts,
and gallery shows — are in full swing.
 London develops a lovely buzz during the Christmas season: The
stores are decorated, lights are lit, carols are sung, special holiday
pantomimes are performed, and the giant Norwegian spruce goes
up in Trafalgar Square.
Naturally, visiting London in the winter has its downside. Consider these
points:
 Although the Yuletide holidays are always jolly, they also add up to
another peak tourist season from mid-December to Christmas. You
know what that means: bigger crowds and higher prices. The city is
virtually shut down on December 25 and 26 and January 1. Stores,
museums, and other attractions close, and public transportation 
is severely curtailed. On December 26 (Boxing Day), you may have
problems finding any kind of open restaurant.
 Wintertime London may be gray and wet for weeks on end; by mid-
winter, the skies get dark by about 3:30 p.m. The English usually
keep their thermostats set about 10° lower than Americans do.
Rather than turn up the heat, the English don their woollies (long
underwear). You should do the same — or be prepared for a
chronic case of goose pimples.

Planning Your Trip 
to London

In this part . . .
T
his part is all about the nitty-gritty of trip planning.
Chapter 4 helps you manage the money side of your trip —
that means planning a workable budget based on real prices
in London and converting your money into English pounds
and pence when you get there; in this chapter, you can ﬁnd
everything you need to know about using ATMs and credit
cards in London, as well as how to save money by following
some useful cost-cutting tips. Chapter 5 covers all your trans-
portation options for getting to London by plane, train, or
boat, and it gives you some tips on escorted tours and
money-saving package tours. Chapter 6 is full of special trip-
planning advice for London-bound families, seniors, travelers
with disabilities, and gays and lesbians. Chapter 7 goes
through some last-minute details, such as getting a passport,
dealing with travel and medical insurance, staying healthy
while you travel, and more.

 Planning a realistic budget for your trip
 Pricing things in London
 Uncovering hidden expenses

 Considering money-saving tips
O
kay, you want to go to London. You’re excited and eager to pack,
but can you really afford it? At this point, a financial reality check is
in order. London is an expensive city, no two ways about it. But adding
everything up, your trip to London can cost Americans about the same
as a trip to New York, San Francisco, or Los Angeles.
Planning Your Budget
You can easily budget for your London trip, but holding down costs
while you’re there may be another matter. (The city’s shopping and
dining is so enticing — and expensive.) Table 4-1 gives you an idea of
some basic costs.

Note: As a general rule, except for tips in restaurants (12.5 to 15 percent)
and to cab drivers (15 percent), you don’t have to tip excessively in
London. But if you stay in an expensive hotel, give the porters who carry
your bags £1 ($1.85) per bag and doormen who hail you cabs £1 ($1.85)
per cab.
Transportation
You may think a trip to London is prohibitively expensive because of the
transatlantic flight, but you can often find bargain airfares to this popu-
lar spot that are cheaper than what you’d pay when flying within the U.S.
For more-specific information on airlines and airfares, see Chapter 5.
I have some other good news that can save you a bundle: You don’t need
to rent a car in London. (If you want to rent a car to explore the areas
surrounding London, see Chapter 14.) The London Underground (called
the Tube) is fast, convenient, and easy to use. Special reduced-price
transportation passes, called Visitor Travelcards, make getting around
Part II: Planning Your Trip to London 
40

the city relatively inexpensive. You also can get reduced-price day and
multiday passes at any Tube station after you arrive; see Chapter 8 for
more information.
Lodging
The cost of accommodations takes the biggest bite from your budget.
Fortunately, because you have to book your rooms well in advance,
you’ll know this expense before you leave on vacation.
Chapter 8 gives you an idea of London neighborhoods and their suitabil-
ity as your home base. Chapter 9 tells you what you can expect for your
money, shows you how to get the best rate, and gives you my recom-
mended list of top-notch B&Bs and hotels in all price ranges and locations.
Rates vary considerably from B&B to B&B and from hotel to hotel, so I
can’t really give you a reliable average. For the recommendations in this
book, however, the rates are generally £95 and under ($175 and under)
for an inexpensive property, £96 to £149 ($176–$275) for a moderately
priced one, £150 to £203 ($276–$375) for an expensive one, and £204 to
£257 ($376–$475) for a very expensive one. After that, you hit the strato-
sphere of £258-plus ($475-plus) for a luxury B&B or hotel. Keep in mind
that many midrange London hotels and all B&Bs include at least a conti-
nental breakfast as part of the room rate, so you can save a few pounds
there.
The rack rates that I list are not the lowest, special-deal rates that you’ll
probably be able to find on the hotel’s Web site. You may be surprised at
how much you can save from the “official” price of a room.
Britain’s version of a sales tax is called the value-added tax (VAT). Brace
yourself: The tax amounts to 17.5 percent. The VAT is part of the reason
that prices in London are so high. The tax is added to the total price of
consumer goods (the price on the tag already includes it) and to hotel
and restaurant bills. The VAT is not a hidden expense, but not all quoted
room rates, especially in the luxury tier, include the tax. Be sure to ask
whether your quoted room rate includes the VAT. (In the hotel listings in
Chapter 9, I tell you if the rate doesn’t include the VAT.)
Dining
In recent years, London has emerged as one of the great food capitals of
the world, known for the variety of its restaurants and the overall quality
of the cooking. I can’t fudge the fact that eating at the top restaurants
costs you a pretty penny, but there are also countless pubs, local restau-
rants, cafes, and sandwich shops where you can dine cheaply and well.
In addition, many of the best London restaurants offer two- and three-
course fixed-price meals that can be real bargains.
If you eat lunch and dinner at the moderately priced restaurants that I
recommend in Chapter 10, expect to pay £25 to £50 ($46–$93) per person
Chapter 4: Managing Your Money 41

per day for meals, not including alcoholic drinks (assuming that break-
fast is included in your hotel rate). If you have breakfast at a cafe rather
than your hotel and are content with coffee and a roll, expect to pay
about £3.50 to £6 ($6.50–$11). Depending on the restaurant, an old-
fashioned English breakfast with eggs, bacon or sausage, toast, and tea
or coffee can run anywhere from £6 to £12 ($11–$22). Likewise, a simple
afternoon tea at a cafe sets you back about £5 to £7 ($9.25–$13), but a
lavish high tea at one of the great London hotels may run £25 ($46) or
more. For specifics on restaurants, inexpensive cafes and sandwich
shops, and places for afternoon tea, see Chapter 10.
On top of the VAT, a few restaurants add a service charge of 12.5 to 15
percent to your bill. If they do, the menu has to state this policy. This
charge amounts to mandatory tipping, so if your credit-card charge receipt
comes back with a space for you to add a tip, put a line through it.
Sightseeing
Your budget for admission fees depends, of course, on what you want to
see. Some of London’s top attractions are pricey indeed: an adult ticket
to the Tower of London costs £15 ($28). But many other outstanding
attractions in London — the British Museum, National Gallery, National
Portrait Gallery, Tate Britain, and Tate Modern — are completely free.
So are the Natural History Museum, the Science Museum, and the
Victoria & Albert Museum. Strolling through London’s great parks or
viewing Buckingham Palace (okay, from the outside) and the Changing
of the Guard won’t cost you a penny. From my suggestions in Chapter 11,
you can weed out the must-see sights from the maybes.
Keep in mind that if you’re a senior or a student, you can often get a
reduced-price admission, and most attractions offer reduced family
rates that are good for two adults and two children.
Shopping and nightlife
Shopping and entertainment are the most flexible parts of your budget.
You don’t have to buy anything at all, and you can hit the sack right after
dinner instead of seeing a play or dancing at a club. You know what you
want. Flip through the shopping options in Chapter 12 and the entertain-
ment and nightlife venues in Chapters 15 and 16. If anything strikes you
as something you can’t do without, budget accordingly. (Keep in mind
that a pint in a pub sets you back about £2.50/$4.65, whereas a theater,
opera, or concert ticket can cost anywhere from £5/$9.25 to over
£100/$185.)
If you’re not a resident of the European Union, you can get a VAT refund
on purchases made in the United Kingdom. (This refund doesn’t include
hotels and restaurants.) See Chapter 12 for details.

Cutting Costs — But Not the Fun
Throughout this book, Bargain Alert icons highlight money-saving tips
and/or great deals. Check out some additional cost-cutting strategies:
 Go in the off-season. If you can travel at nonpeak times (Oct to
mid-Dec or Jan–Mar), you’ll find hotel prices can be as much as 20
percent less than during peak months.
 Travel on off days of the week. Airfares vary, depending on the
day of the week. If you can travel on a Tuesday, Wednesday, or
Thursday, you may find cheaper flights to London. See if you can
obtain a cheaper rate by flying on a different day.
 Try a package tour. For popular destinations like London, you can
make just one call to a travel agent or packager to book airfare,
hotel, ground transportation, and even some sightseeing. You pay
much less than if you tried to put the trip together yourself (see
Chapter 5).
 Reserve a hotel room with a kitchen. In London, these rooms are
called self-catering units. With your own kitchen, you can do at least
some of your own cooking. You may not feel as if you’re on vaca-
tion if you do your own cooking and wash your own dishes, but
you’ll save money by not eating in restaurants two or three times a
day. Parents traveling with small children may find this strategy
particularly useful.
 Always ask for discount rates. Membership in AAA, frequent-flier
programs, trade unions, AARP, or other groups may qualify you for
discounts on plane tickets, hotel rooms, or even meals.
 Always ask if any special room rates are in effect. Hotels are
eager to fill their rooms and now offer many different rates, includ-
ing “promotional” rates and lower weekend rates. In most cases,
you’ll find these special rates on the hotel’s Web site.
 Ask if your kids can stay in your room with you. A room with two
double beds usually doesn’t cost any more than one with a queen-
size bed. And many hotels won’t charge you the additional person
rate if that person is pint-sized and related to you. Even if you have
to pay a few pounds extra for a rollaway bed, you save hundreds by
not taking two rooms.
 Use pay phones rather than the phone in your hotel room. You
may find the telephone in your hotel room convenient, but avoid
using it if you’re on a budget. A local call that costs 20p (35¢) at a
phone booth may cost you £1 ($1.85) or more from your hotel
room. If you plan to make a number of calls during your trip, get a
phone card (see the details about using phones in the Quick
Concierge, at the end of this book) and use pay phones.
Chapter 4: Managing Your Money 43

 Try expensive restaurants at lunch rather than dinner. At most
top restaurants, prices at lunch are considerably lower than those
at dinner, and the menu often includes many of the dinnertime spe-
cialties. Also, look for the fixed-price menus.
 Walk a lot. London is large but completely walkable. A good pair of
walking shoes can save you money on taxis and other local trans-
portation. As a bonus, you get to know the city and its inhabitants
more intimately, and you can explore at a slower pace.
 Skip the souvenirs. Your photographs and your memories should
be the best mementos of your trip. If you’re worried about your
budget, do without the T-shirts, key chains, and other trinkets.
Handling Money
Money makes the world go around, but dealing with an unfamiliar cur-
rency can make your head spin. In London, you pay for things in pounds
and pence, meaning you have to convert your own currency into British
pounds sterling. When it comes to carrying money in London, should
you bring traveler’s checks or use ATMs? What about paying with credit
cards? In the following sections, I tell you what you need to know about
each option.

Ways to save in London and beyond
Visitor Travelcards are not sold in England. In the United States and Canada, you can
buy a voucher for a Visitor Travelcard before you leave home. After you arrive in
England, you exchange the voucher for the appropriate card at any London
Underground ticket window. Two kinds of cards are available: the All Zone and the
Central Zone, which is good for everything in Central London, the area that contains
the city’s main attractions (see Chapter 11). Both cards allow unlimited travel on the
Tube and bus and are available in three-, four-, or seven-day increments. Prices for the
Central Zone card are $24 for adults and $10 for children for three days; $29 for adults
and $11 for children for four days; and $36 for adults and $14 for children for seven
days. You can buy Visitor Travelcards by contacting a travel agent, by calling
RailEurope at % 877-272-7245 in the U.S. or 800-361-7245 in Canada, or by going to
www.raileurope.com.
If you plan to travel around England by train, consider getting a BritRail pass. You must
buy these passes before you arrive (they aren’t sold in England), but they offer con-
siderable savings over individual fares. You have many options: a choice of either first
or standard class, senior passes for those over 60, travel-time periods from four con-
secutive days to one month, and Flexipasses allowing you to travel a certain number
of days within a set time period. You can also get a London Plus card that’s great for day
trips around London. You can find information on the various rail passes in Chapter 14.

Making sense of pounds and pence
Britain’s unit of currency is the pound sterling (£). Every pound is
divided into 100 pence (p). Coins come in denominations of 1p, 2p, 5p,
10p, 20p, 50p, £1, and £2. Notes are available in £5, £10, £20, and £50
denominations. As with any unfamiliar currency, British pounds and
pence take a bit of getting used to. The coins have different sizes,
shapes, and weights according to value. Each bank note denomination
has its own color and bears a likeness of the queen. All currency is
drawn on the Bank of England.
Exchanging your currency
The exchange rate, which fluctuates every day, is the rate that you get
when you use your own currency to buy pounds sterling (see Table 4-2).
In general, $1 = 54p (or £1 = $1.85). These are approximate figures, but
they’re what I use for all prices in this guide (rounded to the nearest
dollar if the amount is over $10). When you’re about to leave on your
trip, check with your bank or look in the newspaper to find out the cur-
rent rate.

Changing money (either cash or traveler’s checks) into a foreign cur-
rency makes many people nervous, especially if they’re changing money
for the first time. You needn’t fear. Changing money is a simple opera-
tion. Just remember that every time you exchange money, you need to
show your passport.
If you want some pounds in hand when you arrive at the airport in
London, you can exchange currency before you leave home at many
banks and at foreign exchange services at international airports.
Otherwise, you can easily change cash or traveler’s checks in London by
using a currency-exchange service called a bureau de change. These
services are available at major London airports, any branch of a major
bank, all major rail and Underground stations in Central London, post
Chapter 4: Managing Your Money 45

offices, and American Express or Thomas Cook offices. Unless located 
in a bank or travel agency, most bureaux de change are open daily from 
8 a.m. to 9 p.m.
Every major bank in Central London has a foreign currency window where
you can exchange traveler’s checks or cash. Weekday hours for banks are
generally 9:30 a.m. to 4:30 p.m., but a few open earlier. Some banks (usually
based in busy shopping areas) are open all day Saturday. All banks are
closed on public holidays, but many branches have 24-hour banking lob-
bies with ATMs or ATMs on the street outside. Banks in London and
throughout the U.K. include Barclays Bank (% 020/7441-3200), 
HSBC (% 0845/743-4445), Midland Bank (% 020/7599-3232), and
NatWest (% 020/7395-5500). These banking companies all have branches
throughout the city.
Reputable London banks and bureaux de change exchange money at a
competitive rate but charge a commission (typically 1 to 3 percent of the
total transaction) and a small additional fee (usually £3/$5.55). Some
currency-exchange services now guarantee you the same exchange rate
when you return pounds for dollars.
All U.K. bureaux de change and other money-changing establishments
are required to display exchange rates and full details of any fees and
rates of commission with clarity and equal prominence. Rates must be
displayed at or near the entrance to the premises. Rates fluctuate from
place to place, and so do fees, so shopping around sometimes pays.
Steer clear of bureaux de change that offer good exchange rates but
charge a heavy commission (up to 8 percent). You find them in major
tourist sections of London (some are open 24 hours). Some hotels also
cash traveler’s checks, but their commission is often considerably
higher than at a bank or bureau de change. Before exchanging your
money, always check to see the exchange rate, how much commission
you’ll have to pay, and whether additional fees apply.
You can avoid paying a second commission fee by using American Express
traveler’s checks and cashing them at an American Express office. The
main office is in London at 6 Haymarket, SW1 (% 020/7930-4411; Tube:
Piccadilly). Its foreign exchange bureau is open Monday through Friday
from 9 a.m. to 5:30 p.m., on Saturday from 9 a.m. to 6 p.m., and on Sunday
from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. For the addresses of other American Express offices
in London, see the Quick Concierge, at the end of this book.
Using ATMs and carrying cash
The easiest and best way to get cash away from home is from an ATM
(automated teller machine). You’ll find ATMs, or cashpoints as they’re
sometimes called in England, all over London. The Cirrus (% 800/424-
7787; www.mastercard.com) and PLUS (% 800/843-7587; www.visa.com)
networks span the globe; look at the back of your bank card to see
which network you’re on, then call or check online for ATM locations in
Part II: Planning Your Trip to London

London. Be sure that you know your personal identification number (PIN)
before you leave home and find out your daily withdrawal limit before you
depart. Some banks will allow you to withdraw cash only from your check-
ing account, not from your savings. Also keep in mind that many banks
impose a fee every time that you use your card at a different bank’s ATM,
and that fee may cost more for international transactions (up to $5 or
more) than for domestic ones (where it rarely goes over $1.50). On top of
this fee from your bank, the bank from which you withdraw cash may
charge its own fee. For international withdrawal fees, ask your bank.
Citibank customers who use ATMs at Citibank International (% 020/
7234-5678) — with branches at 332 Oxford St., W1 (Tube: Marble Arch),
and 336 Strand, WC2 (Tube: Charing Cross) — pay no transaction fee.
Charging ahead with credit cards
Credit cards are a safe way to carry money: They also provide a conven-
ient record of all your expenses, and they generally offer relatively good
exchange rates. You can also withdraw cash advances from your credit
cards at banks or ATMs, provided you know your PIN. If you’ve forgotten
yours, or didn’t even know you had one, call the number on the back of
your credit card and ask the bank to send it to you. It usually takes five
to seven business days to arrive by mail, though some banks will pro-
vide the number over the phone if you tell them your mother’s maiden
name or some other personal information.
Keep in mind that when you use your credit card abroad, most banks
assess a 2 percent fee above the 1 percent fee that Visa, MasterCard, and
American Express charge for currency conversion on credit charges. But
credit cards still may be the smart way to go when you factor in things
like exorbitant ATM fees and higher traveler’s check exchange rates (and
service fees).
Some credit card companies recommend that you notify them of any
impending trip abroad so that they don’t become suspicious when you
use the card numerous times in a foreign destination and block your
charges. Even if you don’t call your credit card company in advance, you
can always call the card’s toll-free emergency number if a charge is
refused — a good reason to carry the phone number with you. But per-
haps the most important lesson here is to carry more than one card with
you on your trip; a card may not work for any number of reasons, so
having a backup is the smart way to go.
Toting traveler’s checks
These days, traveler’s checks are less necessary because most cities have
24-hour ATMs that allow you to withdraw cash as needed. However, keep
in mind that you’ll likely be charged an ATM withdrawal fee if the bank
isn’t your own, so if you’re withdrawing money every day, you may want
to go with traveler’s checks — provided that you don’t mind showing
identification every time you want to cash one.
Chapter 4: Managing Your Money 47

You can get traveler’s checks at almost any bank. American Express
offers denominations of $20, $50, $100, $500, and (for cardholders only)
$1,000. You pay a service charge ranging from 1 to 4 percent. You can
also get American Express traveler’s checks over the phone by calling
% 800/221-7282; Amex gold and platinum cardholders who use this
number are exempt from the 1 percent fee.
Visa offers traveler’s checks at Citibank locations nationwide, as well as
at several other banks. The service charge ranges between 1.5 percent
and 2 percent; checks come in denominations of $20, $50, $100, $500, and
$1,000. Call % 800/732-1322 for information. AAA members can obtain
Visa checks without a fee at most AAA offices or by calling % 866/339-
3378. MasterCard also offers traveler’s checks. Call % 800/223-9920 for
a location near you.
If you choose to carry traveler’s checks, be sure to keep a record of their
serial numbers separate from your checks in the event that they are
stolen or lost. You’ll get a refund faster if you know the numbers.
Never pay for hotels, meals, or purchases with traveler’s checks denomi-
nated in any currency other than British pounds. You get a bad
exchange rate if you try to use them as cash.
Dealing with a Lost or Stolen Wallet
Be sure to contact all of your credit-card companies the minute you dis-
cover your wallet has been lost or stolen and file a report with the
police. In London, call % 192 for directory assistance, free from public
pay phones, to find out the precinct nearest you. Your credit card com-
pany or insurer may require a police report number or record of the
loss. Most credit card companies have an emergency toll-free number to
call if your card is lost or stolen; they may be able to wire you a cash
advance immediately or deliver an emergency credit card in a day or
two. Call the following emergency numbers in the U.K.:
 American Express: % 01273/696-933
 MasterCard: % 01702/362-988
 Visa: % 01604/230-230
If you need emergency cash over the weekend when all banks and Ameri-
can Express offices are closed, you can have money wired to you via
Western Union (% 0800/833-833 in the U.K.; www.westernunion.co.uk).
Identity theft or fraud are potential complications of losing your wallet,
especially if you’ve lost your driver’s license along with your cash and
credit cards. Notify the major credit-reporting bureaus immediately;
placing a fraud alert on your records may protect you against liability
for criminal activity. The three major U.S. credit-reporting agencies are
Part II: Planning Your Trip to London 
48

Equifax (% 800/766-0008; www.equifax.com), Experian (% 888/
397-3742; www.experian.com), and TransUnion (% 800/680-7289;
www.transunion.com). Finally, if you lose all forms of photo ID, call
your airline and explain the situation; they may let you board the plane
if you have a copy of your passport or birth certificate and a copy of the
police report that you’ve filed.
If you follow four basic rules, you can minimize the risk of a crime hap-
pening to you:
 Don’t keep your wallet in your back pocket or in your backpack,
but do keep it out of sight.
 Don’t leave your purse, briefcase, backpack, or coat unattended in
any public place.
 Ladies: Don’t hang your purse over the back of your chair in
crowded or outdoor cafes or restaurants.
 Don’t flash your money or credit cards around.
Chapter 4: Managing Your Money 49
Earning their keep: Royal expenses
In 2005, in an attempt to prove how cheap royalty is, Buckingham Palace said the
queen costs U.K. taxpayers the equivalent of 61p ($1.15) per person per year. That
amount adds up to the yearly total of £36.8 million ($68 million) which the queen
receives in public money to carry out her duties and maintain her palaces. But that
figure doesn’t include the unknown but rising cost of security or the ceremonial duties
of the armed services.
Does the House of Windsor earn its keep? According to published reports, members
of the royal family carried out 2,900 official engagements in 2004. The royals spent
some £514,000 ($950,900) on garden parties, £432,000 ($799,200) on food and kitchens,
and £6,000 ($11,100) on wines and beverages. Travel costs included £2.2 million ($4 mil-
lion) on helicopters, £812,000 ($1.5 million) on civilian air travel, £534,000 ($987,900) with
the RAF, and £782,000 ($1.4 million) on the Royal Train.

N
ow that you’ve decided to visit London, you’ll need to find a way
to get there. In this chapter, I discuss your options for direct, non-
stop flights and give you some ideas on how you can save money on
your flight (and your hotel). What are the pros and cons of taking an
escorted tour? You can find answers to your basic travel questions in
this chapter.
Flying to London
London’s airports are among the busiest in the world, with direct or con-
necting flights from all over the globe. Finding a flight won’t be difficult,
choosing one from the many that are offered may require some research
and comparison shopping for the lowest fare.
Finding out which airlines fly there
Most regularly scheduled international flights from the United States,
Canada, Australia, and New Zealand arrive at London’s Heathrow and
Gatwick airports. Flights from the Continent land at Heathrow, Gatwick,
Stansted, or London City. Luton, the smallest of London’s five airports, is
a destination for charter flights from the Continent.
Here’s a brief description of each of the London airports, who flies to
them, and how to travel from them to Central London (see the Quick
Concierge, at the end of this book, for the contact information of the air-
lines in this list):
 Heathrow, the main international airport, is 15 miles west of
Central London. It’s served by Air Canada (Canadian flights from
Calgary, Montreal, Ottawa, St. John’s, Toronto, and Vancouver); 

Air New Zealand (Australian flights from Sydney; New Zealand
flights from Auckland); American (U.S. flights from Boston,
Chicago, Los Angeles, Miami, and New York); British Airways (U.S.
flights from Boston, Chicago, Detroit, Los Angeles, Miami, Newark,
New York JFK, Philadelphia, San Francisco, Seattle, and Washington
Dulles; Australian flights from Brisbane, Melbourne, Perth, and
Sydney; New Zealand flights from Auckland); Continental (U.S.
flights from Los Angeles, Newark, New York JFK, San Francisco, and
Washington Dulles); Icelandair (U.S. flights from Baltimore, Boston,
Minneapolis/
St. Paul, and New York JFK); Qantas (Australian flights from
Melbourne, Perth, and Sydney; New Zealand flights from Auckland);
United (U.S. flights from Boston, Chicago, Los Angeles, Newark,
New York JFK, San Francisco, and Washington Dulles); and Virgin
Atlantic (U.S. flights from Chicago, Newark, New York JFK, San
Francisco, and Washington Dulles). For information on getting into
London from Heathrow, see Chapter 8.
 Gatwick is a smaller airport about 25 miles south of London. It’s
served by American (U.S. flights from Boston, Dallas/Ft. Worth, 
and Raleigh/Durham); British Airways (U.S. flights from Atlanta,
Baltimore, Charlotte, Dallas/Ft. Worth, Denver, Houston, Miami, New
York JFK, Orlando, Phoenix, and Tampa); Continental (U.S. flights
from Boston, Cleveland, Houston, Miami, Newark, and Orlando);
Delta (U.S. flights from Atlanta and Cincinnati); Northwest (U.S.
flights from Detroit and Minneapolis/St. Paul); Qantas (Australian
flights from Sydney); and Virgin Atlantic (U.S. flights from Boston,
Las Vegas, Miami, Newark, Orlando, and San Francisco). For informa-
tion on getting into London from Gatwick, see Chapter 8.
 Stansted, 50 miles northeast of London, handles national and
European flights. The Stansted Sky Train to Liverpool Street Station
takes 45 minutes and costs £13 ($24).
 London City, only 6 miles east of Central London, services
European destinations. A bus charges £5 ($9.25) per person to take
passengers on the 25-minute trip from the airport to Liverpool
Street Station.
 Luton, 28 miles northwest of London, services mostly charter
flights. You can travel by train from the airport to King’s Cross
Station for £9.50 ($18); the trip takes about an hour.
Getting the best deal on your airfare
Competition among the major U.S. airlines is unlike that of any other indus-
try. Every airline offers virtually the same product (basically, a coach seat
is a coach seat is a . . . ), yet prices can vary by hundreds of dollars.
Business travelers who need the flexibility to buy their tickets at the last
minute and change their itineraries at a moment’s notice — and who
want to get home before the weekend — pay the premium rate, known
Part II: Planning Your Trip to London 
52

as the full fare. But if you can book your ticket far in advance, stay over
Saturday night, and travel midweek (Tues, Wed, or Thurs), you can qual-
ify for the least expensive price — usually a fraction of the full fare. On
most flights, even the shortest hops within the United States, the full fare
costs close to $1,000 or more, but a 7- or 14-day advance-purchase ticket
may cost less than half of that amount. Obviously, planning ahead pays.
The airlines also periodically hold sales, in which they lower the prices
on their most popular routes. These fares have advance-purchase require-
ments and date-of-travel restrictions, but you can’t beat the prices. As you
plan your vacation, keep your eyes open for these sales, which tend to
take place in seasons of low travel volume — in England, that’s basically
October through March. You almost never see a sale around the peak
summer vacation months of July and August, or around Thanksgiving or
Christmas, when many people fly, regardless of the fare they have to pay.
Consolidators, also known as bucket shops, are great sources for inter-
national tickets, although they usually can’t beat the Internet on fares
within North America. Start by looking in Sunday newspaper travel sec-
tions; U.S. travelers should focus on the New York Times, Los Angeles
Times, and Miami Herald.
Bucket-shop tickets are usually nonrefundable or rigged with stiff cancel-
lation penalties, often as high as 50 to 75 percent of the ticket price, and
some put you on charter airlines with questionable safety records.
Several reliable consolidators are worldwide and available on the Net,
and most of them offer flights to London. STA Travel (% 800/781-4040;
www.statravel.com), the world’s leader in student travel, offers 
good fares for travelers of all ages. ELTExpress (% 800/872-8800;
www.flights.com) started in Europe and has excellent fares worldwide,
but particularly to that continent. Flights.com also has “local” Web sites
in 12 countries. FlyCheap (% 800/FLY-CHEAP; www.1800flycheap.com)
is owned by package-holiday megalith MyTravel and has especially good
access to fares for international destinations. Air Tickets Direct (% 800/
778-3447; www.airticketsdirect.com) is based in Montreal and lever-
ages the currently weak Canadian dollar for low fares.
Booking your flight online
The “big three” online travel agencies, Expedia (www.expedia.com),
Travelocity (www.travelocity.com), and Orbitz (www.orbitz.com),
sell most of the air tickets bought on the Internet. (Canadian travelers
should try www.expedia.ca and www.travelocity.ca; U.K. residents
can go for expedia.co.uk and opodo.co.uk.) Each agency has differ-
ent business deals with the airlines and may offer different fares on the
same flights, so shopping around is wise. Expedia and Travelocity will
also send you an e-mail notification when a cheap fare becomes avail-
able to your favorite destination. Of the smaller travel-agency Web sites,
SideStep (www.sidestep.com) receives good reviews from users. It’s a
browser add-on that purports to search over 100 sites at once.
Chapter 5: Getting to London 53

Great last-minute deals are available through free weekly e-mail services
provided directly by the airlines. Most of these deals are announced on
Tuesday or Wednesday and must be purchased online. Most are only
valid for travel that weekend, but some (such as Southwest’s) can be
booked weeks or months in advance. Sign up for weekly e-mail alerts at
airline Web sites or check mega-sites that compile comprehensive lists
of last-minute specials, such as Smarter Living (smarterliving.com).
For last-minute trips, www.site59.com in the U.S. and www.lastminute.
com in Europe often have better deals than the major-label sites.
If you’re willing to give up some control over your flight details, use an
opaque fare service like Priceline (www.priceline.com) or Hotwire
(www.hotwire.com). Both services offer rock-bottom prices in exchange
for travel on a “mystery airline” at a mysterious time of day, often with a
mysterious change of planes en route. The mystery airlines are all major,
well-known carriers — and the possibility of being sent from Philadelphia
to Chicago via Tampa is remote. But your chances of getting a 6 a.m. or
11 p.m. flight are pretty high. Hotwire tells you flight prices before you
buy; Priceline usually has better deals than Hotwire, but you have to play
their “name our price” game. Note: In 2004, Priceline added non-opaque
service to its roster. You now have the option to pick exact flights, times,
and airlines from a list of offers — or opt to bid on opaque fares as before.
Great last-minute deals are also available directly from the airlines them-
selves through a free e-mail service called E-savers. Each week, the air-
line sends you a list of discounted flights, usually leaving the upcoming
Friday or Saturday and returning the following Monday or Tuesday. You
can sign up for all the major airlines at one time by logging on to
Smarter Living (www.smarterliving.com), or you can go to each indi-
vidual airline’s Web site. Airline sites also offer schedules, flight booking,
and information on late-breaking bargains.
Arriving by Other Means
If you’re traveling to London from another destination in Europe, you
don’t have to fly to get there. Train and car ferries and high-speed hover-
crafts cross the English Channel throughout the year from ports in
France, Holland, and Belgium. And the Eurostar high-speed train zips
beneath the channel through the Chunnel, a tunnel beneath the English
Channel.
Taking the train
London has several train stations, and the one you arrive at depends on
your point of departure from the Continent. The three-hour Eurostar
service connecting Paris and Brussels to London via the Chunnel arrives
at Waterloo International Station. Trains from Amsterdam arrive at
Liverpool Street Station. Other London train stations include Euston,
King’s Cross, Paddington, and Victoria stations.
Part II: Planning Your Trip to London 
54

The trains in England and the rest of the United Kingdom are separate
from those in continental Europe, so a Eurail pass isn’t valid in the U.K. If
you’re going to travel within England or the rest of the United Kingdom,
check out the various BritRail passes available (see Chapter 7 for more
information).
Several types of Eurostar fares are available. Senior fares for those over
60 and youth fares for those under 26 can cut the price of a first-class
fare by 20 percent or more. The same reductions apply for passengers
traveling with validated Eurail and BritRail passes. To check out current
and special promotional fares for Eurostar, visit RailEurope’s Web site at
www.raileurope.com.
Riding a ferry or hovercraft
Crossing times for the car, train, and passenger ferries that regularly
crisscross the English Channel can be anywhere from 90 minutes to 5
hours, depending on the point of departure. Various hovercrafts (high-
speed ferries with propellers that lift them off the surface of the water)
skim over the water in as little as half an hour. Frequent train service to
London is available from all the channel ports. The following is a list of
the major ferry and hovercraft companies:
 Hoverspeed UK Limited (% 0870/5240-241 in the U.K.; www.hover
speed.co.uk) operates hovercrafts that zip across the channel
between Calais and Dover in 35 minutes; the SuperseaCats (jet-
propelled catamarans) run between Newhaven and Dieppe in 
55 minutes.
 P&O European Ferries (% 561/563-2856 in the U.S. or 0870/
242-4999 in the U.K.; www.poportsmouth.com) offers daily ferry/
car crossings between Cherbourg and Portsmouth (crossing time is
five hours) and Le Havre and Portsmouth (five and a half hours).
 P&O Stena Line (% 0870/5980333 in the U.K.; www.poferries.com)
operates ferries between Calais and Dover (crossing time is 
75 minutes).
 Sea France Limited (% 01304/212-696 in the U.K.; www.seafrance.
co.uk) runs ferries between Dover and Calais (crossing time is 
90 minutes).
Joining an Escorted Tour
You may be one of the many people who love escorted tours. The tour
company takes care of all the details and tells you what to expect at
each leg of your journey. You know your costs up front and don’t get
many surprises. Escorted tours can take you to the maximum number of
sights in the minimum amount of time with the least amount of hassle.
Chapter 5: Getting to London 55

If you decide to go with an escorted tour, I strongly recommend purchas-
ing travel insurance, especially if the tour operator asks you to pay up
front. But don’t buy insurance from the tour operator! If the tour opera-
tor doesn’t fulfill its obligation to provide you with the vacation you paid
for, there’s no reason to think that it’ll fulfill its insurance obligations
either. Get travel insurance through an independent agency. (You can
find out more about the ins and outs of travel insurance in Chapter 7.)
When choosing an escorted tour, along with finding out whether you
have to put down a deposit and when final payment is due, ask a few
simple questions before you buy:
 What is the cancellation policy? Can they cancel the trip if they
don’t get enough people? How late can you cancel if you’re unable
to go? Do you get a refund if you cancel? If they cancel?
 How jam-packed is the schedule? Does the tour schedule try to fit
25 hours into a 24-hour day, or does it give you ample time to relax
or shop? If getting up at 7 a.m. every day and not returning to your
hotel until 6 or 7 p.m. sounds like a grind, certain escorted tours
may not be for you.
 How large is the group? The smaller the group, the less time you
spend waiting for people to get on and off the bus. Tour operators
may be evasive about this, because they may not know the exact
size of the group until everybody has made reservations, but they
should be able to give you a rough estimate.
 Is there a minimum group size? Some tours have a minimum
group size, and they may cancel the tour if they don’t book enough
people. If a quota exists, find out what it is and how close they are
to reaching it. Again, tour operators may be evasive in their
answers, but the information may help you select a tour that’s sure
to happen.
 What exactly is included? Don’t assume anything. You may have to
pay to get yourself to and from the airport. A box lunch may be
included in an excursion, but drinks may be extra. Beer may be
included, but not wine. How much flexibility do you have? Can you
opt out of certain activities, or does the bus leave once a day, with
no exceptions? Are all your meals planned in advance? Can you
choose your entree at dinner, or does everybody get the same
chicken cutlet?
Here are a few companies that offer escorted tours to London and the
rest of England (with prices per person, based on double occupancy):
 Globus and Cosmos (www.globusandcosmos.com) are well-known
budget tour companies working in partnership. Current offerings
include a five-day/three-night tour of London starting at $1,372, air-
fare included.
Part II: Planning Your Trip to London 
56

 Maupintour (www.maupintour.com) has an eight-day garden tour
that includes two nights in London; admission to the Chelsea
Flower Show; trips to the great gardens at Sissinghurst, Stourhead,
and Blenheim Palace; plus excursions to Bath and Oxford. Prices
start at $3,479, airfare not included. They also have an eight-day
Christmas in London tour that includes side trips to the Cotswolds
and Leeds Castle; prices start at $2,959, airfare not included.
 Trafalgar Tours (www.trafalgartours.com) provides tours to
London and the rest of the U.K. Prices for the Week in London tour
start at an amazingly low $675, airfare not included.
Choosing a Package Tour
For a lot of destinations, package tours can be a smart way to go. In
many cases, a package tour that includes airfare, hotel, and transporta-
tion to and from the airport costs less than the hotel alone on a tour that
you book yourself. That’s because packages are sold in bulk to tour
operators, who resell them to the public.
Package tours vary greatly in what they provide. Some offer a better
class of hotels than others; others provide the same hotels for lower
prices. Some book flights on scheduled airlines; others sell charters. In
some packages, your choice of accommodations and travel days may be
limited. Some let you choose between escorted vacations and independ-
ent vacations; others allow you to add on a few excursions or escorted
day trips (also at discounted prices).
To find package tours, check out the travel section of your local Sunday
newspaper or the ads in the back of national travel magazines, such as
Travel + Leisure, National Geographic Traveler, and Condé Nast Traveler.
Liberty Travel (call % 888/271-1584 to find the store nearest you;
www.libertytravel.com) is one of the biggest packagers in the
Northeast and usually boasts a full-page ad in Sunday papers.
Another good source of package deals is the airlines themselves. Most
major airlines offer air/land packages. Several big online travel agencies —
Expedia, Travelocity, Orbitz, Site59, and Lastminute.com — also do a
brisk business in packages.
Locating package tours
Information about package tours is available from a variety of sources.
Here are a few companies that offer packages to England:
 British Travel International (% 800/327-6097; www.british
travel.com) is a good source for discount packages.
 Liberty Travel (% 888/271-1584; www.libertytravel.com), one
of the biggest packagers in the northeastern United States, offers
reasonably priced packages.
Chapter 5: Getting to London 57

 Trailfinders (www.trailfinders.com), another good source for
discount packages, has several offices in Australia: Brisbane (% 07/
3229-0887), Cairns (% 07/4041-1199), Melbourne (% 03/9600-
3022), Perth (% 08/9226-1222), and Sydney (% 02/9247-7666).
Checking out airline and hotel packages
Airlines are good sources for package tours, especially to London,
because they package their flights together with accommodations. The
following airlines offer packages to London:
 American Airlines Vacations (% 800/321-2121;
www.aavacations.com)
 British Airways Holidays (% 800/247-9297; www.britishairways.
com/holiday)
 Continental Airlines Vacations (% 800/525-0280;
www.continental.com)
 Northwest Airlines World Vacations (% 800/800-1504; 
www.nwaworldvacations.com)
 United Airlines Vacations (% 800/328-6877; 
www.unitedvacations.com)
 Virgin Atlantic Vacations (% 888/937-8474;

Catering to Special Needs
or Interests
In This Chapter
 Visiting London with children
 Getting discounts and special tours for seniors
 Locating wheelchair-accessible attractions
 Finding lesbian- and gay-friendly communities and special events
M
any of today’s travelers have special interests or needs. Parents
may want to take their children along on trips. Seniors may like to
take advantage of discounts or tours designed especially for them. People
with disabilities may need to ensure that sites on their itineraries offer
wheelchair access. And gays and lesbians may want to know about wel-
coming places and events. In response to these needs, this chapter
offers advice and resources.
Traveling with the Brood: Advice for Families
Traveling with children, from toddlers to teens, is a challenge — no
doubt about it. Bringing the brood can put a strain on the budget and
influence your choices of activities and hotels. But in the end, isn’t shar-
ing your experiences as a family great?
Look for the Kid Friendly icon as you flip through this book. I use it to
highlight hotels, restaurants, and attractions that are particularly family
friendly. Zeroing in on these places can help you plan your trip more
quickly and easily.
In addition, the following resources can help you plan your trip:
 About Family Travel (3555 S. Pacific Hwy., Medford, OR 97501; 
% 541/535-5411; www.about-family-travel.com) can tailor a
tour specifically for families traveling to London. Its services
include arranging airfares, hotel rooms, transportation, and theater
tickets, as well as providing tips on sights and destinations.

 Familyhostel (% 800/733-9753; www.learn.unh.edu/family
hostel) takes the whole family, including kids ages 8 to 15, on
moderately priced learning vacations, including England.
 Family Travel Forum (www.familytravelforum.com) is a com-
prehensive site that offers customized trip planning.
Admission prices for most London attractions are generally reduced for
children 5 to 16 years old. Children under 5 almost always get in for free.
If you’re traveling with one or two children, always check to see whether
the attraction offers a money-saving family ticket, which considerably
reduces the admission price for a group of two adults and two children.
Locating family-friendly accommodations 
and restaurants
Most hotels can happily accommodate your family if you reserve your
rooms in advance and make the staff aware that you’re traveling with
kids. The establishment may bring in an extra cot or let you share a
larger room; these types of arrangements are common. Smaller bed-and-
breakfasts (B&Bs) may present problems, such as cramped rooms and
shared toilet facilities, and some places don’t accept children at all. Ask
questions before you reserve.
London has plenty of American-style fast-food places, including Burger
King, KFC, McDonald’s, and Pizza Hut. Teens probably want to check
out the Hard Rock Café in Mayfair or the scene at the Pepsi Trocadero
in Piccadilly Circus, which offers theme restaurants such as Planet
Hollywood and the Rainforest Café (see Chapter 10).
Expensive restaurants are less welcoming toward young children. The
menus aren’t geared to the tastes of American youngsters, the prices
can be high, and the staff can be less than accommodating.
To keep costs down, you can rent a hotel room with a kitchen (in England
these rooms are called self-catering units) and prepare your own meals, as
long as you don’t mind cooking while on vacation. Another option, when
the weather cooperates, is to take the family on a picnic. Kensington
Gardens or Hyde Park may be just the ticket for an enjoyable afternoon
(see Chapter 10 for more suggestions). You can also take advantage of
pre-theater, fixed-price menus (usually served from 5:30–7 p.m.), which
usually give you a good deal.
Planning your trip together
Letting your younger children read Peter Pan or Peter Pan in Kensington
Gardens, and telling them about his statue there, can generate excite-
ment about the trip. Slightly older children may want to read the Harry
Potter series, which takes place in real and fictional settings in London
and around the country. (If your kids have already read the Harry Potter
Part II: Planning Your Trip to London 
60

series, they know that Harry lives in London — in fact, he leaves from
Paddington Station to go off to sorcerer’s school.) With the information
in this book and some online investigating, you can also incite your kids’
curiosity about historic sites such as the Tower of London and H.M.S.
Cutty Sark. And most young people enjoy the prospect of a meal at the
Hard Rock Café or a trip to Madame Tussaud’s wax museum.
Some kid and adult activities can easily overlap. You may want to spend
one afternoon in Kensington Gardens. After the entire family visits
Kensington Palace, the kids can blow off steam in the new Princess
Diana Memorial Playground. Many kid-oriented activities in London are
just as interesting for parents. From the fantastic dinosaur exhibit in the
Natural History Museum to the animatronic robots re-creating historic
scenes at Madame Tussaud’s, you and your kids have plenty that you
can experience and enjoy together.
Preparing for a long trip
The shortest trip from the U.S. to London (which is from New York) is
about 6 hours; airtime from Australia may be 25 hours, which is a lot of
time for kids to sit still and be quiet. Although children can spend some
of the journey time watching a movie (or two) on the plane, come pre-
pared with extra diversions: games, puzzles, books — whatever you
know will keep your kids entertained. Request from the airline a special
kids’ menu at least a day in advance. If your child needs baby food, bring
your own and ask a flight attendant to warm it. Dealing with jet lag can
be hard on adults but even harder on small children. Don’t schedule too
much for your first day in London. Get everyone comfortably settled and
then take it from there.
Hiring a babysitter while on your trip
What you really need is a relaxing evening at the opera and a romantic
late dinner. But you can’t take Junior along on this special evening. What
are your options? Ask your hotel staff if they can recommend a local
babysitting service. Most of the hotels marked with a Kid Friendly 
icon in Chapter 9 can arrange for babysitting. London also has several
respected and trustworthy babysitting agencies that provide registered
nurses and carefully screened mothers, as well as trained nannies, to
watch children. One old and trustworthy babysitting service is Universal
Aunts (% 020/7386-5900; www.universalaunts.co.uk), which charges
£6.50 ($12) per daytime hour, £5 ($9.25) after 6 p.m. (four-hour mini-
mum), plus a £3.50 ($6.50) agency fee.
A fully licensed childcare facility, Pippa Pop-ins (430 Fulham Rd., SW6
1DU; % 020/7385-2458; www.pippapopins.com), in Chelsea, provides a
lovely toy-filled nursery staffed by experienced caregivers where you
can safely park the little ones. Babysitting is available from 8 a.m. until 
7 p.m. Monday through Friday; call for rates. A branch is located in
Fulham at 165 New Kings Rd., SW6 (same phone number).

Making Age Work for You: Tips for Seniors
London won’t present any problems for you if you’re a senior who gets
around easily. If you do have mobility issues, be aware when you plan
your trip that not all hotels — particularly less expensive B&Bs — have
elevators. The steep staircases in some places are a test for anyone with
luggage. When you reserve a hotel, ask whether you’ll have access to a
lift (an elevator in Britspeak).
In most cities, including London, being a senior often entitles you to
some terrific travel bargains, such as reduced admissions at theaters,
museums, and other attractions. Carrying ID with proof of age can pay
off in all these situations. Note: In London and the United Kingdom, you
may find that some discounts are available only to members of a British
association; public transportation reductions, for example, are available
only to U.K. residents with British Pension books. But always ask, even if
the reduction isn’t posted.
The following sources can provide information on discounts and other
benefits for seniors:
 AARP (formerly the American Association of Retired Persons; 601
E St. NW, Washington, DC 20049; % 800/424-3410; www.aarp.org)
offers member discounts on car rentals and hotels. AARP offers
$12.50 yearly memberships that include discounts of 10 to 25 per-
cent on Virgin Atlantic flights to London from nine U.S. cities.
 Elderhostel (11 Ave. de Lafayette, Boston, MA 02110-1746; % 877/
426-8056; www.elderhostel.org) offers people 55 and older a
variety of university-based educational programs in London and
throughout England. These courses are value-packed, hassle-free
ways to learn while traveling. The price includes airfare, accommo-
dations, meals, tuition, tips, and insurance. And you’ll be glad to
know that you don’t receive any grades. Popular London offerings
have included “Inside the Parliament,” “Legal London,” “Classical
Music and Opera in London,” and “Treasures of London Galleries.”
 Grand Circle Travel (347 Congress St., Boston, MA 02210; % 800/
959-0405; www.gct.com) is an agency that escorts tours for mature
travelers to London. In 2003, they offered their popular 16-day
London tour from $1,695, including hotels and airfare.
Accessing London: Advice for 
Travelers with Disabilities
A disability doesn’t have to stop anybody from traveling — more options
and resources are available today than ever before. Many hotels and
restaurants are happy to accommodate people with disabilities.
Part II: Planning Your Trip to London 
62

Persons with disabilities are often entitled to special discounts at sight-
seeing and entertainment venues in Britain. These discounts are called
concessions (often shortened to concs).
Before departing on your trip, contact VisitBritain (see the Quick
Concierge, at the end of this book, for addresses and phone numbers) to
request a copy of its Disabled Traveler Fact Sheet, which contains some
helpful general information. Access London ($19.95) is the best and most
comprehensive London guide for people with disabilities and anyone
with a mobility problem. The book provides full access information for
all the major sites, hotels, and modes of transportation. You can order it
at major online booksellers.
The United Kingdom has several information resources for disabled trav-
elers. The best of these resources include the following:
 Artsline (% 020/7388-2227; www.artsline.org.uk) provides
advice on the accessibility of London arts and entertainment
events.
 The Society of London Theatres (32 Rose St., London WC2E 9ET;
www.officiallondontheatre.co.uk) offers a free guide called
Access Guide to London’s West End Theatres.
 Holiday Care Service (7th Floor, Sunley House, 4 Bedford Park,
Croyden, Surrey CR0 2AP; % 0845/1249971 in the U.K. or 020/
8760-0072 outside the U.K.; www.holidaycare.org.uk) offers
information and advice on suitable accommodations, transporta-
tion, and other facilities in England.
 The National Trust (% 020/7447-6742; www.nationaltrust.
org.uk) is a British organization that owns and operates hundreds
of historic properties (castles, gardens, and more) throughout
England. The free booklet Information for Visitors with Disabilities
provides details on accessibility at each site. Contact The National
Trust Disability Office, 36 Queen Anne’s Gate, London SW1H 9AS, to
obtain a copy. Although not all National Trust sites are accessible,
the organization provides powered four-wheeled vehicles free of
charge at more than 50 properties; you can drive yourself or have a
companion or volunteer drive for you.
 Royal Association for Disability and Rehabilitation (RADAR; 12
City Forum, 250 City Rd., London EC14 8AF; % 020/7250-3222;
www.radar.org.uk) publishes information for disabled travelers
in Britain.
 Tripscope, The Courtyard (Evelyn Road, London W4 5JI; % 08457/
585641 within the U.K. or 0117/939-7782 from outside the U.K.;
www.tripscope.org.uk) provides travel and transport informa-
tion and advice, including airport facilities.
Chapter 6: Catering to Special Travel Needs or Interests 63

Some other helpful resources in the United States include the following:
 American Foundation for the Blind (11 Penn Plaza, Suite 300, New
York, NY 10001; % 800/232-5463; www.afb.org) offers information
on traveling with Seeing Eye dogs; the foundation also issues ID
cards to the legally blind.
 The Society for Accessible Travel & Hospitality (347 Fifth Ave.,
Suite 610, New York, NY 10016; % 212/447-7284; www.sath.org) is
a membership organization with names and addresses of tour oper-
ators specializing in travel for the disabled. You can call to sub-
scribe to its magazine, Open World.
 Travel Information Service (www.mossresourcenet.org) pro-
vides general information and resources for the disabled traveler.
Joining escorted tours
You can find tours designed to meet the needs of travelers with disabili-
ties. One of the best operators is Flying Wheels Travel (143 West Bridge,
P.O. Box 382, Owatonna, MN 55060; % 507/451-5005; www.flyingwheels
travel.com), which offers various escorted tours and cruises, as well
as private tours in minivans with lifts.
Here are some other tour operators for London-bound travelers with dis-
abilities:
 Accessible Journeys (% 800/846-4537; www.disabilitytravel.
com) offers tours of Britain and London in minibuses or motor
coaches.
 The Guided Tour (% 800/783-5841; e-mail: gtour400@aol.com)
has one- and two-week guided tours for individuals, with one staff
member for every three travelers.
 Undiscovered Britain (11978 Audubon Place, Philadelphia, PA
19116; % 215/969-0542; www.undiscoveredbritain.com) pro-
vides specialty travel and tours for individuals, small groups, or
families traveling with a wheelchair user.
Dealing with access issues
The United Kingdom doesn’t yet have a program like the Americans with
Disabilities Act. More and more businesses are becoming accessible,
however, and access in general is easier than ever before.
Not all hotels and restaurants in Britain provide wheelchair ramps. Most
of the less expensive B&Bs and older hotels don’t have elevators, or the
elevators are too small for a wheelchair. Ask about this when you
reserve your room or table.
Part II: Planning Your Trip to London 
64

All the top sights and many of the attractions in Chapter 11 are wheel-
chair accessible, but in some cases you must use a different entrance.
Call the attraction to find out about special entrances, ramps, elevator
locations, and general directions. Theaters and performing arts venues
are often wheelchair accessible, as well (again, call first).
Trains throughout the United Kingdom now have wide doors, grab rails,
and provisions for wheelchairs. To get more information or to obtain a
copy of the leaflet Rail Travel for Disabled Passengers, contact Project
Manager (Disability), British Rail, Euston House, Eversholt Street, London
NW1 1DZ; % 020/7922-6984. You can also check out the National Rail
Web site at www.nationalrail.co.uk, which has a section on disabled
travel and contact information for the various train operating companies.
Disabled travelers will want to keep the following in mind when traveling
around London:
 Although London’s streets and sidewalks are generally kept in good
repair, the city is old and not all streets have modern curb cuts.
 Not all the city’s Underground (subway) stations have elevators
and ramps.
 Low-floor wheelchair-accessible buses serve most stations in
London.
 The city’s black cabs are roomy enough for wheelchairs.
 Victoria Coach Station in Central London has Braille maps.
The following organizations provide access information and services for
disabled travelers in London:
 Transport for London (% 020/7222-1234; www.tfl.gov.uk/tfl/)
publishes a free brochure called Tube Access, which helps travelers
with disabilities plan a Tube journey, avoiding stairs and escala-
tors. You can obtain this brochure at Underground stations in
London.
 Wheelchair Travel (1 Johnston Green, Guildford, Surrey GU2 6XS;
% 1483/233-640 within the U.K. or 1483-237-668 from outside the
U.K.; www.wheelchair-travel.co.uk) is an independent trans-
port service for the disabled traveler arriving in London. The organi-
zation offers self-drive cars and minibuses (although I strongly
discourage anyone, disabled or not, from driving in London) and
can provide wheelchairs. Drivers who also act as guides are also
available on request. Bring your own disabled stickers and permits
from home if you’re going to rent a self-drive vehicle.
Chapter 6: Catering to Special Travel Needs or Interests 65

Taking health precautions
Before you leave on your trip, talk to your physician about your general
physical condition and your prescriptions for the time you’re traveling,
the medical equipment that you need to take, and how to get medical
assistance when you’re away. Carry all prescription medicines in their
original bottles with the contents clearly marked, along with a letter
from your doctor.
Make a list of the generic names of your prescription drugs, in case you
need to replace or refill them during your visit. Pack medications in your
hand luggage. If you use a wheelchair, have a maintenance check before
your trip. If you don’t use a wheelchair but have trouble walking or
become easily tired, consider renting a wheelchair to take with you as
checked baggage.
Following the Rainbow: Gay and 
Lesbian Travelers
London has always been a popular destination for gays and lesbians,
even in the days (prior to 1967) when homosexuality was a criminal
offense in Britain. Today, with a more tolerant government at the helm
and gay marriage an imminent possibility, gay pride is prominent. The
city government has actually spent money to promote gay tourism. You
can find gay theaters, gay shops, more than 100 gay pubs, famous gay
discos, and gay community groups of all sorts. Click the “Gay and
Lesbian” link on the VisitBritain Web site at www.visitbritain.com for
information on gay venues and events throughout England.
Old Compton Street in Soho is the heart of London’s Gay Village, filled
with dozens of gay pubs, restaurants, and upscale bars/cafes. The Earl’s
Court area, long a gay bastion, is home to many gay pubs and restaurants.
Lesbigay events in London include the London Lesbian and Gay Film
Festival in March, the Pride Parade and celebrations in June, and the
big outdoor bash known as Summer Rites in August. You can obtain
information and exact dates from the London Lesbian and Gay
Switchboard at % 020/7837-7324 or online at www.llgs.org.uk.
Brighton (which I describe in Chapter 14) is one of the gayest seaside
resort towns in Europe. From London, you can get to Brighton on the
train in under an hour.
You may want to check out the following Web sites as you plan your trip.
All are specifically geared to gay and lesbian travelers to London and the
United Kingdom:

 www.gayguide.co.uk
 www.pinkpassport.com
In addition, several gay magazines, useful for their listings and news 
coverage, are available in gay pubs, clubs, bars, and cafes. The most
popular are Pink Paper (www.pinkpaper.com) and QX (Queer Xtra;
www.qxmagazine.co.uk). Gay Times (www.gaytimes.co.uk), a high-
quality, monthly, news-oriented mag, is available at most news agents.
Indispensable for its citywide listings (including gay listings), Time Out,
with gay and lesbian listings, appears at newsstands on Wednesdays.
Gay’s the Word (66 Marchmont St., WC1; % 020/7278-7654; www.gays
theword.co.uk; Tube: Russell Square) is the city’s only all-round gay
and lesbian bookstore; the store stocks a fine selection of new and used
books and current periodicals.

B
efore you depart for London to take that boat ride on the river
Thames or visit the Tower of London, you need to take care of
some final details. Do you have an up-to-date passport? Have you taken
steps to meet your health needs while you’re on your trip? Are you won-
dering how to use a cellphone or access e-mail while in London? Do you
think you need to rent a car? This chapter gives you the information that
you need.
Getting a Passport
A valid passport is the only legal form of identification accepted around
the world. You can’t cross an international border without one. Getting a
passport is easy, but the process takes some time.
The U.S. Department of State’s Bureau of Consular Affairs maintains
www.travel.state.gov, a Web site that provides everything you ever
wanted to know about passports (including a downloadable applica-
tion), Customs, and other government-regulated aspects of travel.
Applying for a U.S. passport
If you’re applying for a first-time passport, follow these steps:
1. Complete a passport application in person at a U.S. passport office;
a federal, state, or probate court; or a major post office. To find your
regional passport office, either check the U.S. State Department

Web site (http://travel.state.gov) or call the National
Passport Information Center (% 877-487-2778) for automated
information.
2. Present a certified birth certificate as proof of citizenship.
(Bringing along your driver’s license, state or military ID, or Social
Security card is also a good idea.)
3. Submit two identical passport-sized photos, measuring 2 x 2
inches in size. You often find businesses that take these photos
near a passport office. Note: You can’t use a strip from a photo-
vending machine because the pictures aren’t identical.
4. Pay a fee. For people 16 and over, a passport is valid for ten years
and costs $85. For children 15 and under, a passport is valid for five
years and costs $70.
Allow plenty of time before your trip to apply for a passport; processing
normally takes three weeks but can take longer during busy periods
(especially spring).
If you have a passport in your current name that was issued within the
past 15 years (and you were over age 15 when it was issued), you can
renew the passport by mail for $55. Whether you’re applying in person
or by mail, you can download passport applications from the U.S. State
Department Web site at http://travel.state.gov. For general infor-
mation, call the National Passport Agency (% 202-647-0518). To find
your regional passport office, either check the U.S. State Department
Web site or call the National Passport Information Center (% 877-
487-2778) for automated information.
Applying for other passports
The following list offers information for citizens of Australia, Canada,
and New Zealand:
 Australians can visit a local post office or passport office, call the
Australia Passport Information Service (% 131-232 toll-free from
Australia), or log on to www.passports.gov.au for details on how
and where to apply.
 Canadians can pick up applications at passport offices throughout
Canada; at post offices; or from the central Passport Office, Depart-
ment of Foreign Affairs and International Trade, Ottawa, ON K1A
0G3 (% 800-567-6868; www.ppt.gc.ca). Applications must be
accompanied by two identical passport-sized photographs and
proof of Canadian citizenship. Processing takes five to ten days if
you apply in person or about three weeks if you apply by mail.
 New Zealanders can pick up a passport application at any New
Zealand Passports Office or download it from their Web site.
Contact the Passports Office at % 0800/225-050 in New Zealand or
04/474-8100, or log on to www.passports.govt.nz.

Entering England with your passport
If you’re a citizen of the United States, Canada, Australia, or New
Zealand, you must have a passport with at least two months remaining
until its expiration to enter the United Kingdom. You need to show your
passport at the Customs and immigration area when you arrive at a U.K.
airport. After your passport is stamped, you can remain in the United
Kingdom as a tourist for up to three months. No visa is required if you’re
going to stay in England or the rest of the United Kingdom for less than
three months.
Keep your passport with you at all times. You need to show it only when
you’re converting traveler’s checks or foreign currency at a bank or cur-
rency exchange. However, you may be asked to present your passport to
the hotel clerk when you check in; after examining it, the clerk will
return the passport to you. If you’re not going to need your passport for
currency exchanges, ask whether the hotel has a safe where you can
keep it locked up.
Dealing with a (gulp) lost passport
Don’t worry; if you lose your passport in England, you won’t be sent to
the Tower of London, but you need to take steps to replace it immedi-
ately. First, notify the police. Then go to your consulate or high commis-
sion office (they’re all located in London — you’ll find addresses and
phone numbers in the Quick Concierge, at the end of this book). Bring
all available forms of identification, and the staff can get started on gen-
erating your new passport. Always call first to verify the hours.
Renting a Car in London — Not!
Having a car in London is more trouble than it’s worth for the following
reasons:
 Maneuvering through London’s congested and complicated maze of
streets can be an endurance test even for Londoners.
 Finding your way through the city in heavy traffic while driving on
the left-hand side of the road can turn even the best American
driver into a gibbering nut case.
 Parking is difficult to find and expensive (street meters cost
£1/$1.85 for 20 minutes).
 Gas (petrol in Britspeak) costs over $6 a gallon.
 Public transportation — especially the Tube — will get you every-
where you want to go at a fraction of the cost.
Do yourself a favor: Forget about renting a car. If you want to be with
Londoners on their own turf (or in their own tunnels), the Tube (Under-
ground) is a great way to do it. Even if you’re planning excursions 
Chapter 7: Taking Care of the Remaining Details 71

outside London, the trains are a better option. (However, see Chapter 14
for details on renting a car for day-tripping.)
Playing It Safe with Travel 
and Medical Insurance
Three kinds of travel insurance are available: trip-cancellation insurance,
medical insurance, and lost-luggage insurance. The cost of travel insur-
ance varies widely, depending on the cost and length of your trip, your
age and health, and the type of trip that you’re taking, but expect to pay
between 5 percent and 8 percent of the vacation itself. Here’s my advice
on all three:
 Trip-cancellation insurance helps you get your money back if you
have to back out of a trip, if you have to go home early, or if your
travel supplier goes bankrupt. Allowed reasons for cancellation can
range from sickness to natural disasters to the State Department
declaring your destination unsafe for travel. (Insurers usually won’t
cover vague fears, though, as many travelers discovered who tried
to cancel their trips in October 2001 because they were wary of
flying.)
A good resource is “Travel Guard Alerts,” a list of companies 
considered high-risk by Travel Guard International (www.travel
insured.com). Protect yourself further by paying for the insurance
with a credit card — by law, you can get your money back on goods
and services not received if you report the loss within 60 days after
the charge is listed on your credit card statement.
 For travel overseas, most health plans (including Medicare and
Medicaid) do not provide coverage. Even if your plan does cover
overseas treatment, most out-of-country hospitals, including those in
England, make you pay your bills up front and send you a refund only
after you’ve returned home and filed the necessary paperwork with
your insurance company. As a safety net, you may want to buy travel
medical insurance. If you require additional medical insurance, try
MEDEX Assistance (% 410-453-6300; www.medexassist.com) or
Travel Assistance International (% 800-821-2828; www.travel
assistance.com; for general information on services, call the com-
pany’s Worldwide Assistance Services, Inc., at % 800-777-8710).
 Lost-luggage insurance is not necessary for most travelers. On
international flights (including U.S. portions of international trips),
baggage coverage is limited to approximately $9.07 per pound, up
to approximately $635 per checked bag. If you plan to check items
more valuable than the standard liability, see if your valuables are
covered by your homeowner’s policy, get baggage insurance as
Part II: Planning Your Trip to London 
72

part of your comprehensive travel-insurance package, or buy
Travel Guard’s “BagTrak” product. Don’t buy insurance at the 
airport — it’s usually overpriced. Be sure to take any valuables or
irreplaceable items with you in your carry-on luggage, because
many valuables (including books, money, and electronics) aren’t
covered by airline policies.
If your luggage is lost, immediately file a lost-luggage claim at the
airport, detailing the luggage contents. For most airlines, you must
report delayed, damaged, or lost baggage within four hours of
arrival. The airlines are required to deliver luggage, once found,
directly to your house or destination free of charge.

Staying Healthy When You Travel
Getting sick will ruin your vacation, so I strongly advise against it (of
course, last time I checked, the bugs weren’t listening to me any more
than they probably listen to you).
For travel abroad, you may have to pay all medical costs up front and be
reimbursed later. For information on purchasing additional medical
insurance for your trip, see the preceding section.

Avoiding “economy-class syndrome”
Deep vein thrombosis, or as it’s know in the world of flying, “economy-class syn-
drome,” is a blood clot that develops in a deep vein. It’s a potentially deadly condition
that can be caused by sitting in cramped conditions — such as an airplane cabin —
for too long. Symptoms of deep vein thrombosis include leg pain or swelling, or even
shortness of breath.
During a flight (especially a long-haul flight), get up, walk around, and stretch your
legs every 60 to 90 minutes to keep your blood flowing. Other preventative measures
include frequent flexing of the legs while sitting, drinking lots of water, and avoiding
alcohol and sleeping pills.
If you have a history of deep vein thrombosis, heart disease, or another condition that
puts you at high risk, some experts recommend wearing compression stockings or taking
anticoagulants when you fly; always ask your physician about the best course for you.

Talk to your doctor before leaving on a trip if you have a serious and/
or chronic illness. For conditions such as epilepsy, diabetes, or heart
problems, wear a MedicAlert identification tag (% 888-633-4298; www.
medicalert.org), which immediately alerts doctors to your condition
and gives them access to your records through MedicAlert’s 24-hour
hotline. Contact the International Association for Medical Assistance to
Travelers (IAMAT; % 716-754-4883 in the U.S. or 416-652-0137 in Canada;
www.iamat.org) for tips on travel and health concerns in the countries
that you’re visiting.
Staying Connected by Cellphone or E-Mail
The three letters that define much of the world’s wireless capabilities
are GSM (Global System for Mobiles), a big, seamless network that
makes for easy cross-border cellphone use throughout Europe and
dozens of other countries worldwide. In the United States, T-Mobile,
AT&T Wireless, and Cingular use this quasi-universal system; in Canada,
Microcell and some Rogers customers are GSM; and all Europeans and
most Australians use GSM.
If your cellphone is on a GSM system, and you have a world-capable
multiband phone such as many Sony Ericsson, Motorola, or Samsung
models, you can make and receive calls across developed areas through-
out much of the world, from Andorra to Uganda. Just call your wireless
operator and ask for “international roaming” to be activated on your
account. Unfortunately, per-minute charges can be high — usually $1 to
$1.50 in England and Western Europe.
That’s why it’s important to buy an “unlocked” world phone from the
get-go. Many cellphone operators sell “locked” phones that restrict you
from using any removable computer memory phone chip (called a SIM
card) other than the ones they supply. Having an unlocked phone allows
you to install a cheap, prepaid SIM card (found at a local retailer) in your
destination country. (Show your phone to the salesperson; not all phones
work on all networks.) You’ll get a local phone number — and much,
much lower calling rates. Getting an already locked phone unlocked can
be a complicated process, but it can be done; just call your cellular oper-
ator and say you’ll be going abroad for several months and want to use
the phone with a local provider.
For many, renting a phone is a good idea. While you can rent a phone
from any number of overseas sites, including kiosks at airports and at
car-rental agencies, I suggest renting the phone before you leave home.
That way, you can give loved ones and business associates your new
number, make sure the phone works, and take the phone wherever you
go — especially helpful for overseas trips through several countries,

where local phone-rental agencies often bill in local currency and may
not let you take the phone to another country.
Phone rental isn’t cheap. You’ll usually pay $40 to $50 per week, plus air-
time fees of at least $1 a minute. If you’re traveling to England, though,
local rental companies often offer free incoming calls within their home
country, which can save you big bucks. The bottom line: Shop around.
Rent-a-phone (% 800-400-7221 in the U.S. or 0800/317-540 in the U.K.) 
is an international cellphone rental company with offices in the U.S. and
U.K.; per-minute charges from England are generally about $1.99 per
minute to the U.S. and Europe, and the phones can be delivered to your
door in the U.S. before you leave. In Terminal 1 and Terminal 2 at
Heathrow Airport, you can buy a range of mobile phones and services,
including SIM cards, at Primus (% 020-8607-5960).
Two good wireless rental companies are InTouch USA (% 800-872-7626;
www.intouchglobal.com) and RoadPost (% 888-290-1606 or 905-272-
5665; www.roadpost.com). Give them your itinerary, and they’ll tell you
what wireless products you need. InTouch will also, for free, advise you
on whether your existing phone will work overseas; simply call % 703-
222-7161 between 9 a.m. and 4 p.m. eastern standard time or go to
www.intouchglobal.com/travel.htm.
You have any number of ways to check your e-mail and access the Internet
on the road. Of course, using your own laptop — or even a personal digital
assistant (PDA) or electronic organizer with a modem — gives you the
most flexibility. But even if you don’t have a computer, you can still access
your e-mail and even your office computer from cybercafes.
It’s hard nowadays to find a city in England that doesn’t have a few
cybercafes, though you won’t find any in smaller towns and villages.
Although there’s no definitive directory for cybercafes — these are 
independent businesses, after all — two places to start looking are at
www.cybercaptive.com and www.cybercafe.com.
Aside from formal cybercafes, most youth hostels nowadays have at
least one computer on which you can access the Internet. And most
public libraries across the world offer Internet access free or for a small
charge. If you want to save money, avoid hotel business centers unless
you can use the service for free.
Most major airports now have Internet kiosks scattered throughout
their gates. These kiosks, which you also see in shopping malls, hotel
lobbies, and tourist-information offices around the world, give you basic
Web access for a per-minute fee that’s usually higher than cybercafe
prices. The kiosks’ clunkiness and high price mean that you probably
want to avoid them whenever possible.
Chapter 7: Taking Care of the Remaining Details 75

To retrieve your e-mail, ask your Internet service provider (ISP) if it has
a Web-based interface tied to your existing e-mail account. If your ISP
doesn’t have such an interface, you can use the free mail2web service
(www.mail2web.com) to view and reply to your home e-mail. For more
flexibility, you may want to open a free, Web-based e-mail account with
Yahoo! Mail (http://mail.yahoo.com). (Microsoft’s Hotmail is
another popular option, but Hotmail has severe spam problems.) You
may be able to get your home ISP to forward your e-mail to the Web-
based account automatically.
If you need to access files on your office computer, look into a service
called GoToMyPC (www.gotomypc.com). The service provides a Web-
based interface for you to access and manipulate a distant PC from 
anywhere — even a cybercafe — provided that your “target” PC is on
and has an always-on connection to the Internet (such as with Road
Runner cable). The service offers top-quality security, but if you’re wor-
ried about hackers, use your own laptop rather than a cybercafe com-
puter to access the GoToMyPC system.
If you’re bringing your own computer, the buzzword in computer access
to familiarize yourself with is Wi-Fi (wireless fidelity), and more and
more hotels, cafes, and retailers are signing on as wireless hotspots from
which you can get a high-speed connection without cable wires, net-
working hardware, or a phone line. You can get a Wi-Fi connection one of

Surfing at Internet cafes in London
The handy www.netcafeguide.com has a pretty good London listing, including
the easyInternetCafe chain. There are 18 of these giant Internet cafes in the capital —
but cafe is really a misnomer, because the hundreds of screens in the largest loca-
tions make them look like telemarketing sweatshops, and you don’t hear any conver-
sation, just the clicking of keyboards.
The charging system is radical because surfers buy credit, not minutes. The minimum
you’ll spend is £2 ($3.70), and the amount of time you get for that is in inverse propor-
tion to how busy the branch is. The rate is adjusted every five minutes and posted on
video screens, a bit like a stock exchange. Your ticket has a user ID, which notes the
current rate when you first log on. That becomes your rate. You’ll never pay more, but
if things quiet down, your credit will buy more time — a pound could be worth up to
six hours, or so they claim. easyEverything never closes, so avoid afternoons and early
evenings, and surf with the creatures of the night and early morning.
Check www.easyeverything.com for new branches to add to this list: 358 Oxford

several ways. Many laptops sold in the last year have built-in Wi-Fi capa-
bility (an 802.11b wireless Ethernet connection). Mac owners have their
own networking technology, Apple AirPort. If you have an older com-
puter, you can plug an 802.11b/Wi-Fi card (around $50) into your laptop.
You sign up for wireless access service much as you do cellphone serv-
ice, through a plan offered by one of several commercial companies that
have made wireless service available in airports, hotel lobbies, and
coffee shops, primarily in the U.S. (followed by the U.K. and Japan). 
T-Mobile Hotspot (www.t-mobile.com/hotspot) serves up wireless
connections at Starbucks coffee shops throughout England. Boingo
(www.boingo.com) and Wayport (www.wayport.com) have set up net-
works in airports and high-class hotel lobbies. iPass providers also give
you access to a few hundred wireless hotel-lobby setups. Best of all, you
don’t need to be staying at the Four Seasons to use the hotel’s network;
just set yourself up on a nice couch in the lobby. The companies’ pricing
policies can be byzantine, with a variety of monthly, per-connection, and
per-minute plans, but in general, you pay around $30 a month for limited
access — and as more and more companies jump on the wireless band-
wagon, prices are likely to get even more competitive.
There are also places that provide free wireless networks in cities
around the world. To locate these free hotspots, go to www.personal
telco.net/index.cgi/WirelessCommunities.
If Wi-Fi is not available at your destination, most business-class hotels
throughout England and the rest of the U.K. offer dataports for laptop
modems, and many offer free high-speed Internet access using an
Ethernet network cable. You can bring your own cables, but most hotels
rent them for around $10. Call your hotel in advance to see what your
options are.
In addition, major ISPs have local access numbers around the world,
allowing you to go online by simply placing a local call. Check your ISP’s
Web site or call its toll-free number and ask how you can use your cur-
rent account away from home, and how much it will cost. If you’re 
traveling outside the reach of your ISP, the iPass network has dial-up
numbers in most of the world’s countries. You’ll have to sign up with an
iPass provider, who will then tell you how to set up your computer for
your destination(s). For a list of iPass providers, go to www.ipass.com
and click “Individuals Buy Now.” One solid provider is i2roam (% 866-
811-6209 or 920-235-0475; www.i2roam.com).
Wherever you go, bring a connection kit of the right power and phone
adapters, a spare phone cord, and a spare Ethernet network cable — or
find out whether your hotel supplies them to guests.
North American current runs 110V, 60 cycles; the standard voltage
throughout Britain is 240V AC, 50 cycles. You need a current converter
or transformer to bring the voltage down and the cycles up. Two-pronged
Chapter 7: Taking Care of the Remaining Details 77

North American plugs won’t fit into the three-pronged square British
wall sockets, so you also need a three-pronged square adapter and con-
verter if you use North American laptops or appliances while in England.
Plug adapters and converters are available at most travel, luggage, elec-
tronics, and hardware stores. Some plug adapters are also current con-
verters. Most contemporary laptop computers automatically sense the
current and adapt accordingly.
Keeping Up with Airline Security Measures
With the federalization of airport security, security procedures at U.S.
airports are more stable and consistent than ever. Generally, you’ll be
fine if you arrive at the airport one hour before a domestic flight and
two hours before an international flight; if you show up late, tell an air-
line employee and she’ll probably whisk you to the front of the line.
Bring a current, government-issued photo ID such as a driver’s license
or passport. Keep your ID at the ready to show at check-in, the security
checkpoint, and sometimes even the gate. (Children under 18 do not
need government-issued photo IDs for domestic flights, but they do for
international flights to most countries.)
In 2003, the TSA phased out gate check-in at all U.S. airports. And 
e-tickets have made paper tickets nearly obsolete. If you have an e-ticket,
you can beat the ticket-counter lines by using airport electronic kiosks
or even online check-in from your home computer. Online check-in
involves logging on to your airline’s Web site, accessing your reserva-
tion, and printing out your boarding pass — and the airline may even
offer you bonus miles to do so! If you’re using a kiosk at the airport,
bring the credit card that you used to book the ticket or your frequent-
flier card. Print out your boarding pass from the kiosk and simply pro-
ceed to the security checkpoint with your pass and a photo ID. If you’re
checking bags or looking to snag an exit-row seat, you’ll be able to do so
using most airline kiosks. Even the smaller airlines are employing the
kiosk system, but always call your airline to make sure these alternatives
are available. Curbside check-in is also a good way to avoid lines,
although a few airlines still ban curbside check-in; call before you go.
Security checkpoint lines are getting shorter than they were immediately
after September 11, 2001, but some doozies remain. If you have trouble
standing for long periods of time, tell an airline employee; the airline will
provide a wheelchair. Speed up security by not wearing metal objects
such as big belt buckles. If you’ve got metallic body parts, a note from
your doctor can prevent a long chat with the security screeners. Keep in
mind that only ticketed passengers are allowed past security, except for
folks escorting disabled passengers or children.
Federalization has stabilized what you can carry on and what you can’t.
The general rule is that sharp things are out, nail clippers are okay, and
Part II: Planning Your Trip to London 
78

food and beverages must be passed through the x-ray machine — but
that security screeners can’t make you drink from your coffee cup. Bring
food in your carryon rather than checking it, because explosive-detection
machines used on checked luggage have been known to mistake food
(especially chocolate, for some reason) for bombs. Travelers in the U.S.
are allowed one carry-on bag, plus a “personal item” such as a purse,
briefcase, or laptop bag. Carry-on hoarders can stuff all sorts of things
into a laptop bag; as long as it has a laptop in it, it’s still considered a
personal item. The Transportation Security Administration (TSA) has
issued a list of restricted items; check its Web site
(www.tsa.gov/public/index.jsp) for details.
Airport screeners may decide that your checked luggage needs to be
searched by hand. You can now purchase luggage locks that allow
screeners to open and relock a checked bag if hand-searching is neces-
sary. Look for Travel Sentry certified locks at luggage or travel shops and
Brookstone stores (you can buy them online at www.brookstone.com).
These locks, approved by the TSA, can be opened by luggage inspectors
with a special code or key. For more information on the locks, visit
www.travelsentry.org. If you use something other than TSA-approved
locks, your lock will be cut off your suitcase if a TSA agent needs to
hand-search your luggage.

you can ﬁnd out how to get from the airport into the city,
and I introduce you to London’s neighborhoods; I also tell
you everything you need to know about public transporta-

hotel for the best possible rate, and gives you my list of
London’s best hotels, all described and cross-indexed by
price and location. In Chapter 10, I introduce you to London’s
dining scene, telling you about the variety of cuisines you’ll
discover and recommending dozens of my favorite London
restaurants, from pubs and ﬁsh-and-chips joints to the hottest
of haute hang-outs, all cross-referenced so you can easily ﬁnd
what you’re looking for. I also give you a list of places for a
quick snack or a formal high tea.

 Traveling around the city
A
lthough London is among the world’s largest cities, both in size and
population, its neighborhoods were once small, separate villages.
With urban roots (and routes) that hark back to Roman times, London
isn’t always the easiest city to navigate. Streets aren’t organized in a
grid, and although most have been paved and modernized, a few old
lanes here and there still have cobblestones. This quaint, villagelike
quality is one reason for London’s enduring charm, but charm is little
comfort when you’re lost in a strange place. This chapter helps you get
your bearings. Neighborhood boundaries come later in this chapter, too.
First, you need to get from the airport or train station into Central
London.
Getting through Passport Control and Customs
Have your passport ready because your first stop after deplaning is
passport control (for details on getting a passport, see Chapter 7). The
procedure is fairly routine. On the plane you fill out a landing card that
asks for your name, home address, passport number, and the address
where you’ll be staying in London. Present the completed card with your
passport to the official at Passport Control. The official may ask for the
following information:
 How long you’ll be staying (you must stay less than three months if
you don’t have a visa)
 Where you plan to stay

 Whether the trip is for business or pleasure (don’t be afraid to say
pleasure)
 What your next destination will be
 How much money you have with you
Although you may think that the question about your finances is snoopy
impertinence, officials have good reason to ask. They want to verify that
people entering England won’t apply for some kind of welfare or national
health-insurance benefits and become a burden on the country.
Officials may stamp your passport without asking a thing. After your
passport is stamped, proceed to pick up your luggage. From there, you
wind your way out through the Customs Hall.
At the Customs area, you get two choices: “Nothing to Declare” and
“Goods to Declare.” Chances are you won’t be declaring anything, in
which case you’ll walk right through. Limits on imports for visitors 17
and older entering England include the following:
 200 cigarettes, 50 cigars, or 250 grams (8.8 oz.) of loose tobacco
 2 liters (2.1 qt.) of still table wine
 1 liter of liquor over 22 percent alcohol content or 2 liters of liquor
under 22 percent
 2 fluid ounces of perfume
If you fall within these limits, go through the “Nothing to Declare” area at
Customs. You may, however, be stopped for a random luggage search.
Don’t take it personally if this happens. Unless you’re smuggling in con-
traband, you have nothing to worry about.
For details on duty-free shopping and limits on what you can bring back
home, see Chapter 12.
Making Your Way to Your Hotel
You’re in London — well, almost. First, you have to get from the airport
or train station to your hotel. I fill you in on all your options in the fol-
lowing sections.
Arriving at Heathrow
About 15 miles west of Central London, Heathrow (% 020/8759-4321;
www.baa.co.uk) is the largest of London’s airports, as well as one of 
the world’s busiest, with four passenger terminals (and a fifth under con-
struction) serving flights from around the globe. Moving walkways and
Part III: Settling into London 
84

signposts that mark just about everything make the trek through the
long corridors easy. You’ll probably arrive at Terminal 3 or 4:
 Terminal 3 is for non-British, long-haul flights.
 Terminal 4 is for British Airways intercontinental flights.
After clearing Customs (see the section “Getting through Passport
Control and Customs,” earlier in this chapter), you enter the main con-
course of your terminal. You can pick up a free map and general info
from the Tourist Information Centre in the Underground concourse of
Terminals 1, 2, and 3 (open Oct–May daily 8 a.m.–6 p.m. and June–Sept
Mon–Sat 8 a.m.–7 p.m.). You can also find ATMs, hotel booking agencies
(see Chapter 9), theater booking services, and several banks and bureaux
de change where you can swap your dollars or traveler’s checks for
pounds and pence.
You have several options for getting into the city. The London
Underground (% 020/7222-1234), called the Underground or the Tube,
is the London subway system and the cheapest mode of public trans-
portation for most Central London destinations (see the inside back
cover of this book for a map of the Underground system). All terminals
at Heathrow link up with the Tube system. Follow the Underground signs
to the ticket booth. The Piccadilly Line gets you into Central London in
about 45 minutes for a fare of £3.80 ($7.05). Underground trains run from
all four Heathrow terminals every five to nine minutes Monday through
Saturday 5:30 a.m. to 11:30 p.m. and Sunday 6 a.m. to 11 p.m.
The one potential hassle with the Underground is that the Tube trains
don’t have luggage racks. Stash your bags as best you can — behind
your legs, on your lap, or near the center doors where there’s more
space. Keep in mind that during rush hour the trains become increas-
ingly packed as you get closer to London. To reach your hotel on the
Underground, you may have to change trains or take a cab from the
Underground station closest to your destination.
If the Underground is closed, you can ride the N97 night bus from
Heathrow to Central London. Buses (located in front of the terminals)
run every 30 minutes Monday through Saturday midnight to 5 a.m. and
Sunday 11 p.m. to 5:30 a.m. The trip takes about an hour; a one-way fare
costs £1.50 ($2.80).
The buses operated by National Express (% 08705/747777;
www.nationalexpress.com) may be a better alternative to the
Underground if you have lots of heavy luggage. Two routes are available:
The National Express bus goes from Heathrow to Victoria Station via
Cromwell Road, Knightsbridge, and Hyde Park Corner; the Route A2
Airbus goes to Kings Cross Station via Bayswater, Marble Arch, Euston,
and Russell Square. Travel time for both takes about 75 minutes, and the
Chapter 8: Arriving and Getting Oriented 85

fare (which you can pay on the bus) costs £8 ($15). Up to three buses
per hour depart daily from 4 a.m. to 11:23 p.m. from the coach station in
front of Heathrow’s Terminals 3 and 4.
The Heathrow Express (% 0845/600-1515; www.heathrowexpress.co.
uk) is a dedicated train line running from all four Heathrow terminals to
London’s Paddington Station in only 15 minutes. The trains have air-
conditioning, ergonomically designed seating, and plenty of luggage
space. The standard-class fare costs £14 ($26). You can buy tickets at the
airport or onboard the train. Service runs Monday through Saturday 5:07
a.m. to 11:32 p.m. and Sunday 5:07 a.m. to midnight. All the major air-
lines have check-in counters right at Paddington, so when you’re return-
ing from London to the airport, you can conveniently check your
luggage before boarding the train; then when you arrive at Heathrow,
you can go directly to your departure gate without further check-in.
If you’re travel-weary, you may want the luxury of taking a taxi directly
to your hotel. Taxis are especially cost effective if four or five people are
traveling together. You can order one at the Taxi Information booths
in Terminal 3 (% 020/8745-4655) or Terminal 4 (% 020/8745-7302).
Expect to pay about £45 ($83), plus tip (15 percent of the total fare), for
a trip of about 45 minutes. Cabs are available 24 hours a day. Wheelchair
facilities are available at all times for the disabled.
Arriving at calmer Gatwick
Gatwick (% 08700/002468; www.baa.co.uk) is considerably smaller
than Heathrow but basically provides the same services, except that
there’s no tourist information office here. Gatwick is about 28 miles
south of Central London and handles national and international flights
from some U.S. airlines; international flights come in at the South
Terminal. Gatwick also has a North Terminal.
If you land at Gatwick rather than Heathrow, you have fewer transporta-
tion options into Central London. The highway system from Gatwick into
London is far less efficient than from Heathrow, so buses, minivans, or
cabs can end up taking two to three hours in heavy traffic.
Your quickest way of getting into Central London from Gatwick is the con-
venient Gatwick Express train (% 0845/101-515; www.gatwickexpress.
co.uk). You can board the train right in the South Terminal, and in about
30 minutes, you’ll be at Victoria Station. The trip costs £12 ($22) Express
class. Trains run daily every 15 minutes from 6:50 a.m. to 1:30 a.m.
Slightly less expensive, the Thameslink train (% 08457/48-4950;
www.thameslink.co.uk) runs between Gatwick and King’s Cross
Station for £9.50 ($18). Service is every 15 minutes daily from 3:45 a.m.
to 12:15 a.m.; trip time is about 45 minutes.
Hotelink (% 01293/552251; www.hotelink.co.uk) runs a minibus
service from Gatwick directly to your hotel for £20 ($37).

For 24-hour taxi service between Gatwick and Central London, call
 Gatwick Airport Cars (% 01293/562-291)
 Gatwick Goldlines Cars (% 01293/568-368)
You can order a taxi at the Taxi Information booth when you arrive at
Gatwick Airport. Fares for both companies are the same: £65 ($120), plus
tip, for the journey that takes about 90 minutes.
Touching down at another airport
If you fly into London from elsewhere in Europe, you may arrive at an
airport other than Heathrow and Gatwick. The following sections help
you navigate from these less-used facilities.
Stansted: For national and European flights
Stansted (% 08700/000303) is a single-terminal airport used for national
and European flights. The airport is about 33 miles northeast of Central
London. The Stansted Express (% 0845/600-7245) to Liverpool Street
Station takes 45 minutes and costs £15 ($28). Trains run every half-hour
daily 4:30 a.m. to 11 p.m. The Route A6 Airbus (% 08705/747777) makes
the journey to Victoria Coach Station in about 1 hour and 40 minutes and
costs £8 ($15). Taxi fare into the city averages about £60 ($111), plus tip.
London City Airport: European destinations only
London City Airport (% 020/7646-000) is a mere 10 miles east of the
city center, and it services only European destinations. A blue shuttle
bus (% 020/7646-0000) takes passengers from the airport to Liverpool
Street Station in 25 minutes for £5 ($9.25). The buses run every 10 min-
utes daily 6 a.m. to 9:30 p.m. A taxi to the vicinity of Marble Arch costs
about £25 ($46), plus tip.
Luton: Serving European charters
Luton (% 01582/405-100) services European charter flights. This 
small, independent airport is about 33 miles northwest of the city. The
Greenline 757 Bus (% 08706/087261) runs from the airport to Victoria
Coach Station on Buckingham Palace Road daily every hour 5:30 a.m. to
midnight; the trip takes about 75 minutes and costs £8 ($15).
You can also take the 24-hour Railair Coach Link to Luton Station 
(3 miles away), which connects with the Thameslink City Flyer train to
King’s Cross Station in Central London. The fare costs £9.50 ($18); trip
time takes one hour.
Taxis into the city cost about £50 ($93), plus tip.
Chapter 8: Arriving and Getting Oriented 87

Arriving by train
If you’re coming from the Continent, you cross the English Channel and
disembark at one of the United Kingdom’s Channel ports. The ports clos-
est to London are Dover, Folkestone, and Ramsgate to the east and
Newhaven, Portsmouth, and Southampton to the south. The QEII cruise
ship also docks at Southampton.
Trains connecting with ferries on the U.K. side of the Channel generally
go to Liverpool Street Station, Victoria Station, or Waterloo
International. Waterloo International (part of Waterloo Station) is also
where the Eurostar Chunnel trains arrive from Paris and Brussels. On
the Eurostar, you don’t have to make any train-to-boat-to-train transfers
along the way. For more on the Eurostar, see Chapter 5.
All London stations link to the Underground system. Just look for the
Underground symbol (a circle with a line through it). The stations con-
nect to the Underground as follows:
 Liverpool Street is on the Circle, East London, Metropolitan, and
Central Lines.
 Victoria is on the District, Circle, and Victoria lines.
 Waterloo is linked to the Northern and Bakerloo lines.
Taxis wait outside all train stations. See the section “Getting Around
London,” later in this chapter, for more information on the London
Underground and taxis.
London’s train stations are swarming with activity. You find bookstores,
bureaux de change (currency exchange facilities), restaurants, news-
stands, and many of the services that airports traditionally offer. While
passing through, you can stock up on maps and brochures, and if you
arrive in London without a hotel reservation, you can book a room at
hotel reservation agencies.
Keep in mind that the United Kingdom, like the rest of Europe, uses the
24-hour clock for rail and other timetables, which means that 0530 is
5:30 a.m., 1200 is noon, and 1830 is 6:30 p.m. Don’t be confused: Just con-
tinue counting up from noon: 1300 = 1 p.m., 1400 = 2 p.m., 1500 = 3 p.m.,
and so on up to 2400 (midnight). In this book, I stick to the American
a.m. and p.m. system. Like most of the rest of the world, London goes on
daylight saving time from April through October.
Figuring Out the Neighborhoods
Londoners orient themselves by neighborhood (see the “London’s
Neighborhoods” map on p. 90). Sounds simple enough, but with
Part III: Settling into London 
88

London’s confusing and sometimes oddly named streets and its seem-
ingly endless plethora of neighborhoods, you may have a hard time
telling where one neighborhood begins and another leaves off. For orien-
tation purposes, I give you major streets as boundary markers. But be
aware that the neighborhoods frequently bleed beyond these principal
arteries.
To help you find your way around, I strongly suggest that you buy a
copy of London A to Z (ask for London A to Zed, because z is pronounced
zed). You can pick up this indexed London street map at just about any
bookstore or newsstand (you may want to get it while you’re at the 
airport).
Although Greater London encompasses a whopping 622 square miles,
the main tourist portion covers only a fraction (25 sq. miles at the most)
of that distance. Most sites within this 25-mile range are convenient to
the Underground system (the Tube). You may have a short (ten-minute
or less) walk from the Tube stop to your destination, but London is flat,
and for walkers it’s a dream.
London is divided into postal districts, like zip codes in the United
States. All London street addresses include a designation such as SW1 or
EC3. (In London, the postal districts are related to where they lie geograph-
ically from the original post office, which was at St. Martin-le-Grand in
the City.) Addresses in the City of London, the easternmost portion of
Central London, have designations such as EC2, EC3, or EC4. As you
move west, the codes change to W, WC, SW, NW, and so on.
You don’t need to bother yourself with postal districts except when
you’re looking up streets in London A to Z (many streets in different
parts of London have the same name) or mailing something to London.
When you actually hit the streets, the postal district designations aren’t
as important as the nearest Tube stop.
London grew up along the north and south banks of the Thames River,
which snakes through the city in a long, loose S-curve. This great tidal
river played a fundamental role in London’s growth, development, and
prosperity. London’s major tourist sights, hotels, and restaurants are on
the river’s north bank, and many of the city’s famous performing-arts
venues are on the South Bank.
Central London, on the north bank of the Thames, is considered the 
city center — the area covered by the Circle Line Underground route.
Paddington Station anchors the northwestern corner, Earl’s Court marks
the southwestern corner, Tower Hill sits at the southeast corner, and
Liverpool Street Station anchors the northeastern corner. Central London
is divided into three areas: the City, the West End, and West London. 
In the descriptions that follow, I start at the City and move west from
there.

The City of London: The heart of it all
A self-governing entity that extends south from Chiswell Street to the
river Thames, the City of London is bounded on the west by Chancery
Lane and to the east by the Tower of London, the City’s most important
historic monument.
Fleet Street, associated with printing and publishing since the 1500s but
now a little forlorn since the departure of most of its newspaper offices,
cuts through the center of the district to Ludgate Circus, where it
becomes Ludgate. Follow that road and you get to St. Paul’s Cathedral,
its massive dome beautifully illuminated at night. St. Paul’s is just one of
the buildings built atop the ancient area known as the City.
Covering the original 1 square mile that the Romans called Londinium, the
City encompasses the territory between Moorfields to the north and 
the Thames to the south and from Aldgate to the east and Temple Bar 
to the west. Today, this area is the Wall Street of England, home to the
Bank of England, the Royal Exchange, and the Stock Exchange, as well
as the new Lloyds of London building and the NatWest Tower, London’s
second tallest building. You also find the Museum of London, the remains
of the Roman Temple of Mithras, the church of St. Stephen Walbrook
(designed by Christopher Wren), the Wren-designed Monument that com-
memorates the Great Fire of London in 1666, and the Barbican Centre, a
mega-arts complex of theaters and concert halls.
Liverpool Street Station is the main rail terminus in this area. The major
Tube stops are Bank, Barbican, Blackfriars, Liverpool Street Station,
Moorgate, St. Paul’s, and Tower Hill.
The West End: Downtown London
The West End (that is, west of the City) is “downtown” London. The West
End is known for the theater, entertainment, and shopping areas around
Piccadilly Circus and Leicester Square. But a host of neighborhoods make
up the West End. I describe them briefly in the sections that follow.
Holborn
Abutting the City of London to the west is the old borough of Holborn,
the legal heart of London and home to the Inns of Court, Lincoln’s Inn
Fields, Old Bailey, and Royal Courts of Justice.
This “in-between” district is bounded roughly by Theobald’s Road to the
north, Farringdon Road to the east, the Thames to the south, and
Kingsway, Aldwych, and Lancaster Place to the west. The major Tube
stops are Aldwych, Blackfriars, Holborn, and Temple.
The Strand and Covent Garden
The northern section of the Strand, the area west of Holborn, is Covent
Garden, with Shaftesbury Avenue as its northern boundary. Covent
Part III: Settling into London 
92

Garden has many theaters, eateries, and shops and is home to the Royal
Opera House and Covent Garden Market, one of the busiest shopping
areas in London. Covent Garden is an area for strolling, shopping, and
stopping for tea or a meal.
Formerly one of the premier streets in England, the Strand (the same
name as the neighborhood) runs from Trafalgar Square to Fleet Street;
the Strand is the principal thoroughfare along the southern edge, with
Charing Cross Road to the west and Kingsway, Aldwych, and Lancaster
Place to the east. Cleopatra’s Needle, an Egyptian obelisk dating from
about 1475 B.C. and moved to England in 1878, is located in the Victoria
Embankment on the north side of the Hungerford Bridge. The major
Tube stops are Charing Cross, Covent Garden, and Leicester Square.
Bloomsbury
Just north of Covent Garden, New Oxford Street and Bloomsbury Way
mark the beginnings of the Bloomsbury district, home of the British
Museum and several colleges and universities, as well as the only surviv-
ing London home of novelist Charles Dickens.
This intellectual pocket of Central London was home to the famed
Bloomsbury Group, whose members included novelist Virginia Woolf
and historian Lytton Strachey. Bloomsbury is bounded to the east by
Woburn Place and Southampton Row, to the north by Euston Road, and
to the west by Tottenham Court Road. The major Tube stops are Euston
Square, Goodge Street, Russell Square, and Tottenham Court Road.
Soho
This lively area is full of restaurants, cafes, bars, pubs, and nightclubs
and is popular with the gay community. London’s Gay Village centers
around Old Compton Street. Gerrard Street is one of the main streets of
Chinatown. Much of Soho used to be a down-to-earth Italian neighbor-
hood, but the area later became known for its strip joints and porn
palaces. You still see remnants of the sex ’n’ sleaze era, but most of it is
now gone, and things are going upscale.
The Soho neighborhood occupies the maze of densely packed streets
north of Shaftesbury Avenue, west of Charing Cross Road, east of Regent
Street, and south of Oxford Street. The major Tube stops are Covent
Garden, Leicester Square, and Tottenham Court Road.
Piccadilly Circus, Leicester Square, and Charing Cross
This area, just west of the Strand, is “downtown” London or Theatreland.
Piccadilly Circus, with its landmark statue of Eros, is the area’s major
traffic hub and best-known tourist destination, feeding into Regent Street
and Piccadilly. The Royal Academy of Arts is just west of Piccadilly
Circus. A few minutes’ walk to the east puts you at Leicester Square and
Shaftesbury Avenue, where you find most of the West End theaters. From
Leicester Square, Charing Cross Road runs south to Trafalgar Square,
Chapter 8: Arriving and Getting Oriented 93

with its delightful fountains and four immense bronze lions guarding its
corners. Around the square, you see the National Gallery and the
National Portrait Gallery. Charing Cross Road is well known for its
bookshops. The Tube stops are Charing Cross, Leicester Square, and
Piccadilly Circus.
Mayfair
Elegant and exclusive, Mayfair is luxury-hotel and luxury-shopping land.
The area is nestled among Regent Street on the east, Oxford Street on
the north, Piccadilly on the south, and Hyde Park on the west. The major
Tube stops are Bond Street, Hyde Park Corner, Marble Arch, and
Piccadilly Circus.
Marylebone
In a sense, Marylebone (pronounced Mar-lee-bone) is “Medical London”
because the area has several hospitals and the famous Harley Street
Clinic. But perhaps the most famous street is Baker Street, home of the
fictional Sherlock Holmes. Madame Tussaud’s wax museum is on
Marylebone Road.
Marylebone is the neighborhood north of Mayfair and Bloomsbury and
is capped to the north by giant Regent’s Park (Marylebone Road runs
south of the park). Great Portland Street is the area’s eastern boundary
and Edgware Road the western. The major Tube stops are Baker Street,
Marylebone, and Regent’s Park.
St. James’s
St. James’s is “Royal London,” a posh green haven beginning at Piccadilly
and moving southwest to include Green Park and St. James’s Park, with
Buckingham Palace between them and St. James’s Palace across from
St. James’s Park.
Pall Mall (pronounced Pell Mell), lined with exclusive “gentlemen’s
clubs,” runs roughly east-west into the area and meets the north-south
St. James’s Street. Regent Street is the eastern boundary. The Tube stops
are Green Park and St. James’s Park.
Westminster
East and south of St. James’s, Westminster draws visitors to
Westminster Abbey and the Houses of Parliament, the seat of British
government.
Westminster extends from Northumberland Avenue just south of
Charing Cross to Vauxhall Bridge Road, with the Thames to the east and
St. James’s Park to the west. Victoria Station, on the northwestern
perimeter, is a kind of axis for Belgravia, Pimlico, and Westminster. The
Tube stops are St. James’s Park, Victoria, and Westminster.
Part III: Settling into London 
94

Pimlico
The pie-shaped wedge of London extending west from Vauxhall Bridge
Road to Buckingham Palace Road is Pimlico. Crowning the area to the
north is Victoria Station. Near the Vauxhall Bridge is the Tate Britain
gallery. The Tube stops are Pimlico and Victoria.
Belgravia
A posh quarter long favored by aristocrats, Belgravia is where many for-
eign embassies are located. Beginning west of Victoria Station and Green
Park, Belgravia extends south to the river and west to Sloane Street;
Hyde Park is its northern boundary. The Tube stops are Hyde Park,
Sloane Square, and Victoria.
Central London: Parks, museums, and more
West of the West End, you find Central London’s residential, cultural,
and shopping attractions, including beautiful gardens and popular 
museums.
Knightsbridge
West of Belgravia is the fashionable residential and shopping district of
Knightsbridge, bounded to the north by Hyde Park and to the west by
Brompton Road. Here you find Harrods, the famed department store
that has been a London shopping staple for a century and a half.
Running through the neighborhood is pretty Beauchamp (pronounced
Beech-um) Place with its expensive boutiques. The Tube stops are
Knightsbridge and Sloane Square.
Chelsea
South of Knightsbridge and west of Belgravia, artsy, trendy Chelsea
begins at Sloane Square and runs south to Cheyne Walk and Chelsea
Embankment along the Thames. The famous King’s Road acts as its
northern boundary and Chelsea Bridge Road its eastern border. To the
west, the area extends as far as Earl’s Court Road, Redcliffe Gardens, and
Edith Grove. In Chelsea, you find Carlyle’s House and the lovely and his-
toric Chelsea Physic Garden. The annual Chelsea Flower Show is held
on the grounds of Chelsea Royal Hospital. The Tube stop is Sloane
Square.
South Kensington
Forming the green northern boundary of South Kensington are
Kensington Gardens and Hyde Park. South Ken is London’s museum
capital and is packed with hotels and restaurants. Tourists enjoy the
attractions of the Natural History Museum, Science Museum, and
Victoria & Albert Museum.
Chapter 8: Arriving and Getting Oriented 95

South Kensington is bounded to the south by Brompton Road, to the
west by Gloucester (pronounced Glos-ter) Road, and to the east 
by Fulham Road. The Tube stops are Gloucester Road and South
Kensington.
Kensington
The residential neighborhood of Kensington fills in the gap between
Kensington Gardens and Holland Park, with Notting Hill Gate and
Bayswater Road marking the northern boundary. Kensington Church
Street runs north-south between Notting Hill Gate and Kensington High
Street. The Tube stop is High Street Kensington.
Earl’s Court
This down-to-earth neighborhood has long been a haven for budget 
travelers (particularly Australians — hence its nickname, Kangaroo
Court) and for gays and lesbians. Earl’s Court is gradually being reno-
vated, but some streets still look a bit down at the heels. This area 
offers no major tourist attractions, but it does have some good hotels
and B&Bs.
The area begins south of West Cromwell Road and extends south to Lillie
Road and Brompton Road. Its western boundary is North End Road, and
its eastern boundary is Earl’s Court Road. The Tube stop is Earl’s Court.
Notting Hill
Beginning north of Holland Park, Kensington Gardens, and Hyde Park
(Holland Park Avenue and Bayswater Road run along the northern
perimeter of the parks), you find the antiques shops of Notting Hill and
the rising subneighborhood of Notting Hill Gate.
The area is bounded by Clarendon Road to the west, Queensway to 
the east, and Wesbourne Grove to the north. The most famous street,
Portobello Road, runs north-south through the center. The neighbor-
hood served as a backdrop for the 1999 movie Notting Hill, starring Julia
Roberts and Hugh Grant. The Tube stops are Bayswater, Notting Hill
Gate, and Queensway.
Bayswater and Paddington
Picking up where Notting Hill ends, Bayswater runs east to meet
Marylebone at Edgware Road. The roaring A40 (Westway) highway acts
as its northern boundary. Paddington Station is in the northwestern
corner of Bayswater.
This commercial area isn’t much to look at. The neighborhood offers no
major tourist attractions, but it does have many budget B&Bs. The Tube
stops are Edgware Road, Lancaster Gate, Marble Arch, and Paddington.
Part III: Settling into London 
96

The South Bank
You most likely won’t be staying on the South Bank, but you may go
there for a play, an exhibition, or a concert at one of its internationally
known arts and performance venues or museums. The Tube stops are
London Bridge, Southwark, and Waterloo.
The Hayward Gallery, the National Film Theatre, the Royal National
Theatre, and the South Bank Centre (which contains Royal Festival
Hall and two smaller concert halls) are all clustered beside the river
within easy walking distance of Waterloo Station. Closer to Westminster
Bridge is the city’s newest high-rise attraction: the British Airways
London Eye observation wheel.
For a scenic route to the South Bank, take the Tube to Embankment, on
the north bank, and walk across the Thames on the new Hungerford
pedestrian bridge. The Jubilee Walkway, a breezy riverside path,
extends south from the arts complexes to the London Aquarium and
north to the new Tate Modern, the Globe Theatre (a re-creation of the
Elizabethan outdoor theater used by William Shakespeare), Southwark
Cathedral, and Tower Bridge. The new pedestrian-only Millennium
Bridge spans the Thames from the Tate Modern to St. Paul’s.
Finding Information After You Arrive
You can find hotel- and theater-booking agencies, a currency exchange,
and a lot of free brochures on river trips, walking tours, and day trips
from London at the Britain & London Visitor Centre, 1 Regent St.,
Piccadilly Circus, SW1 (Tube: Piccadilly Circus), which provides tourist
information to walk-in visitors (no phone assistance is available). The
center is open Monday 9:30 a.m. to 6:30 p.m., Tuesday through Friday 
9 a.m. to 6:30 p.m., and Saturday and Sunday 10 a.m. to 4 p.m.
Tourist Information Centres are found in the following locations (call 
% 020/7234-5800 for information for all Tourist Information Centres):
 City of London, St. Paul’s Churchyard (St. Paul’s Cathedral), open
Easter through September daily 9:30 a.m. to 5 p.m.; October
through Easter Monday through Friday 9:30 a.m. to 5 p.m. and
Saturday 9:30 a.m. to 12:30 p.m.
 Waterloo International Terminal Arrivals Hall, open daily 
8:30 a.m. to 10:30 p.m.
Getting Around London
You can choose many ways to get around London. If you travel for any
distance, the fastest mode of transportation in this enormous city is the
Chapter 8: Arriving and Getting Oriented 97

Tube (the subway system). Many of the slower but more scenic buses
are double-deckers. Most convenient (unless you’re stuck in a traffic
jam) is to go by taxi. But walking is the most fun of all. When you’re on
foot, you see more and can explore some of the leafy squares and cob-
bled lanes that contribute to London’s enduring charm.
For general London travel information, call Transport for London at 
% 020/7222-1234 or visit their Web site, www.tfl.gov.uk. You can get
free bus and Underground maps and buy Travelcards and bus passes at
any major Underground station or at the London Travel Information
Centres in the stations at King’s Cross; Liverpool Street; Oxford Circus;
Piccadilly Circus; St. James’s Park; Victoria; and Heathrow Terminals 1,
2, and 3.
Taking the Underground (subway)
London has the oldest and most comprehensive subway system in the
world. The Tube is fast and convenient, and just about everyone but the
Royals use it. Everywhere you’ll want to go is near a Tube stop, each of
which is clearly marked by a red circle with a horizontal line through it.
For an Underground map, see the inside back cover of this book.
Using the Underground
Thirteen Underground lines crisscross the city and intersect at various
stations where you can change from one train to another. On Underground
maps, every line is color-coded (Bakerloo is brown, Piccadilly is dark
blue, and so on), which makes planning your route easy. All you need to
know is the name of your stop and the direction you’re heading. After
you figure out which line you need to take, look on the map for the name
of the last stop in the direction you need to go. The name of the last stop
on the line appears on the front of the train and sometimes on electronic
signboards that display the name of the arriving train. (The one excep-
tion to this rule is the Circle Line, which runs in a loop around Central
London.) Inside all but the oldest trains are electronic signs, recorded
voices, or both, which announce the name of each approaching stop.
Most of the Underground system operates with automated entry and
exit gates. You feed your ticket into the slot, the ticket disappears and
pops up again like a piece of toast, the gate bangs open, and you remove
your ticket and pass through. At the other end, you do the same to get
out, but the machine keeps the ticket (unless your ticket is a multiuse
Travelcard, which the machine returns to you). Ticket collectors are
located at some stations outside of Central London.
Traveling to your destination by Underground may require transferring
from one Underground line to another. All Underground maps clearly
show where various lines converge. Signs in the stations direct you from
one line to another. To get from one line to another, you go through tun-
nels (which the Brits call subways), and you may have to go up or down
a level or two.
Part III: Settling into London 
98

Underground service stops around midnight (a little earlier on less-used
lines). Keep this in mind when you’re out painting the town red. If you
miss the last train, you have to take a taxi or one of the night buses.
Buying tickets
You can purchase Underground tickets at the ticket window or from one
of the automated machines that you can find in most stations. Machines
can change £5, £10, and £20 notes. Fares to every station are posted.
For fare purposes, the city is divided into zones. Zone 1 covers all
Central London. Zone 6 extends as far as Heathrow to the west and
Upminster to the east. Make sure that your ticket covers all the zones
that you’re traveling through (no problem if you’re staying in Central
London), or you may have to pay a £10 ($19) penalty fare.
A single-fare one-way ticket within one zone costs £2 ($3.70) for an
adult and 60p ($1.10) for a child from 5 to 15 years of age. You don’t have
to pay more than this to reach any sight in Central London (provided
you’re also traveling from within Central London). Tickets are valid for
use on the day of issue only.
If you’re going to travel by Underground, you can save time and money
by buying a book of ten tickets, called a carnet. Carnet tickets are valid
in Zone 1 only. Each ticket is good for a single ride on any day. The price
is £17 ($31) for an adult and £5 ($9.25) for a child. With a Travelcard (see
the following section), you can save even more.
Saving with Travelcards
To make the most of London’s public transportation system, consider
buying a Travelcard, which allows unlimited travel by Underground and
bus. You can purchase these cards at any Tube station window or
machine in the following increments:
 A Day Travelcard for Zones 1 and 2 (everything in Central London)
costs £4.70 ($8.70) for an adult and £2 ($3.70) for a child; the card is
valid after 9:30 a.m. weekdays and all day Saturday and Sunday.
 The 3-Day Travelcard for Zones 1 and 2 costs £15 ($28) for an adult
and £7.50 ($14) for a child.
 A 7-day Travelcard for Zone 1 (all Central London) costs £19 ($35)
for an adult and £7.50 ($14) for a child.
 The Family Travelcard is good for families or groups of one or two
adults traveling with one to four children; to use it, you must travel
together as a group. The Family Travelcard is valid after 9:30 a.m.
Monday to Friday and all day Saturday and Sunday. Rates for one
day of travel in Zones 1 and 2 are £3.10 ($5.75) for an adult and 80p
($1.50) for a child.
Chapter 8: Arriving and Getting Oriented 99

Another great way to save money on London transportation is the
Visitor Travelcard, which you can buy in the United States and Canada
before leaving home. For details, see Chapter 4.
Riding a bus
Distinctive red double-decker buses are very much a part of London’s
snarled traffic scene, but not all London buses are double-deckers, and
some aren’t red. The one drawback to bus travel, especially for first-
timers, is that you need to know the streets of London so you can get off
at the correct stop. Get a free bus map at one of the Travel Information
Centres (see “Finding Information After You Arrive,” earlier in this chap-
ter), or you may overshoot your destination. On the plus side, riding the
bus is cheaper than taking the Tube; you don’t have to contend with
escalators, elevators, or tunnels; and you get to see the sights as you
travel.
A concrete post with a red or white sign on top reading LONDON TRANSPORT
BUS SERVICE clearly marks each bus stop. Another sign shows the routes 
of the buses that stop there. If the sign on top is red, the stop is a
request stop, meaning you must hail the approaching bus as you would
a taxi (don’t whistle — just put up your hand). If the sign is white, the
bus stops automatically. Be sure to check the destination sign on the
front of the bus to make certain that the bus travels the entire route.
Have some coins with you, because the driver won’t change banknotes.
The bus network is divided into two fare zones to simplify cash transac-
tions. Zone 1 covers all Central London, including all the main tourist
sites. The bus fare for adults is £1.20 ($2.20), 40p (75¢) for children.
Children 16 and under ride free if they have a Child Photocard; you
must supply your own passport-size photo to obtain this free ID card,
which is available at Tube stations or one of the Travel Information
Centres.
A 1-day bus pass can be used all day but isn’t valid on N-prefixed night
buses (see the next paragraph). You can purchase this and bus passes
good for longer periods at most Underground stations, selected news
agents, and the Travel Information Centres. A one-day bus pass for all
Central London costs £3 ($5.55) for an adult and £1 ($1.85) for a child
age 5 to 15. A 7-day bus pass for Central London costs £11 ($20) for an
adult and £4 ($7.40) for a child 5 to 15. Note: Children must have a Child
Photocard ID in order to buy and use any of these passes (see the pre-
ceding paragraph).
At the witching hour of midnight, buses become night buses (N), and
their routes change. Nearly all night buses pass through Trafalgar
Square, Central London’s late-night magnet for insomniacs.

Hailing a taxi
Taking a taxi is a safe and comfortable way to get around the city. Riding
in the old-fashioned, roomy black taxis is a pleasure. Today, there are
also many smaller and newer-model taxis. London cabs of any size or
color aren’t cheap. The fare starts at £1.40 ($2.60) for one person, with
40p (75¢) for each additional passenger. Then you have to deal with the
surcharges: 10p (20¢) per item of luggage; 60p ($1.10) weeknights 8 p.m.
to midnight; 90p ($1.70) from midnight until 7 a.m.; 60p ($1.10) Saturday
and Sunday until 8 p.m. and 90p ($1.65) after that. The meter leaps 20p
(35¢) every 111 yards or 90 seconds. Tip your cabbie 10 to 15 percent of
the total fare.
You can hail a cab on the street. If a cab is available, the yellow or 
white FOR HIRE sign on the roof is lit. You can order a radio cab by calling
% 02072/720-272 or 02072/535-000. Be aware that if you call for a cab,
the meter starts ticking when the taxi receives notification from the 
dispatcher.
London is one city where you don’t have to worry about whether the
cab driver knows where he’s going. When it comes to finding a street
address, London cabbies are among the most knowledgeable in the world.
Their rigorous training, which includes an exhaustive street test called
“The Knowledge,” gives them an encyclopedic grasp of the terrain.
Walking on your own two feet
Sure, you can hop from one place to the next using the Tube, a bus, or a
cab. But if you really want to get acquainted with the charming hodge-
podge and monumental grandeur of London, bring along a good pair of
walking shoes and explore on foot. Everywhere you turn, you see entic-
ing side streets, countrylike lanes, little mews dwellings (former stables
converted into homes), and picturesque garden squares. London’s great
parks are as safe to walk in as its streets. (In fact, crime is less prevalent
in London than in many other major cities, and all the neighborhoods
included in this book are safe.)
If you want to follow a detailed stroll or two around the city, perhaps of
Dickens’s London or of Westminster and Whitehall, check out the 11
tours in Frommer’s Memorable Walks in London, by Richard Jones (Wiley).
A 7-mile walk commemorating the life of Princess Diana passes through
four of London’s royal parks — St. James’s Park, Green Park, Hyde Park,
and Kensington Gardens. Along the way are 90 plaques that point out
sites associated with Diana, including Kensington Palace (her home for
15 years), Buckingham Palace, St. James’s Palace (where she shared an
office with Prince Charles), and Spencer House (her family’s mansion,
now a museum).
Chapter 8: Arriving and Getting Oriented 101

When you walk in London (or anywhere in England), remember:
 Traffic moves on the opposite side of the street from what you’re
accustomed to. This sounds simple enough on paper, but in prac-
tice, you need to keep reminding yourself to look in the “wrong”
direction when crossing a street. Throughout London, you see LOOK
RIGHT or LOOK LEFT painted on street crossings.
 Pedestrian crossings are marked by striped lines (called zebra
crossings) on the road. Flashing lights near the curb indicate that
drivers must stop and yield the right of way when a pedestrian
steps out into the zebra to cross the street.

L
ondon hotel rooms run the gamut from a basic tiny bedroom with a
shared bathroom down the hall to elegant, sumptuous splendor.
Many travelers don’t care where they stay, as long as they can stay there
cheaply. The reasoning is, “I’m only going to be in a hotel room to sleep.”
That assumption may be true, but I also know that a cheap-at-all-costs
hotel room can color your mood and turn a potentially memorable vaca-
tion into something unnecessarily dreary.
This chapter is devoted to London hotels and B&Bs. You can find details
about what to expect for your money, get the lowdown on ways to get
the best rooms at the best rates, and check out a list of specific hotels
and B&Bs that I heartily recommend.
Getting to Know Your Options
Accommodations in London are available in varying price ranges and
degrees of luxury. Places to stay generally fit into one of two categories:
hotels and bed-and-breakfast inns (B&Bs). The following sections provide
a rundown on the quirks and perks of each type of accommodations.
Understanding the pros and cons of B&Bs
B&Bs are small, family-run hotels with differing degrees of comfort and
service. Because B&Bs are often private homes (or what were once pri-
vate homes), amenities vary widely, especially in the bathroom facilities.
Nearly all B&B rooms contain wash basins, but you may have to share a
bathroom down the hall. The facilities are usually kept scrupulously

clean. Keep in mind that en-suite (in the room) baths are generally so
small that you feel as if you haven’t left the airplane, and the super-small
showers can be a trial.
The décor in many of the lowest-priced B&Bs is unimaginative and unim-
pressive. Coming back to a small room with mismatched furniture, pink
walls, and a tiny bathroom down the hall with no hot water may be an
inconvenience that you’re willing to suffer for the sake of saving money,
but I don’t recommend any such places in this book. The more popular
and well-appointed B&Bs are more expensive, but their comforts and
conveniences are worth the price.
What about the breakfast part of the B&B? Well, gone are the days when
the staff of every B&B cooked you up a full English breakfast of eggs,
sausages, bacon, fried tomatoes, and beans. Some B&Bs still do serve an
English breakfast, but others put out a continental buffet, which is a
breakfast of cereals, fruits, and breads. The B&B descriptions in this
book say either “English breakfast included” or “continental breakfast
included,” so you know what to expect.
Licensed B&Bs, like hotels, are inspected regularly, and the quality of
B&Bs has improved tremendously over the years. I recommend them for
people who don’t require many extras, although the most successful
B&Bs continually upgrade their services or offer some enticing ameni-
ties. For example, many B&Bs now provide cable TVs and direct-dial
phones in the rooms.
If you want to do some additional B&B research, the following three
agencies have useful Web sites:
 London Bed and Breakfast: www.londonbandb.com (% 800/872-
2632 in the U.S. or 020/7351-3445 in London)
 London Bed and Breakfast Agency Ltd.: www.londonbb.com
(% 020/7586-2768 in London)
 Uptown Reservations: www.uptownres.co.uk (% 020/7351-3445
in London)
If you’re physically disabled in any way, B&Bs may not be the choice for
you. B&Bs usually don’t have elevators, so you may have to carry your
luggage up steep, narrow stairs. Be sure to check how accessible the
B&B is before you make your reservations.
Exploring hotel choices
You find a wide choice of hotels in London. Most of the moderately
priced hotels provide breakfast with a room rental. At a four- or five-star
hotel, you pay a hefty price to eat breakfast on the premises. The rooms
in a self-catering hotel are equipped with small kitchens, so you can
make your own breakfast in your room or go out to a nearby cafe or
restaurant.

Boutique and deluxe hotels
London offers a few boutique hotels. These hotels are midrange in size
but not price; sumptuously furnished, they offer state-of-the-art ameni-
ties and full service. The Montague in Bloomsbury and 41 in
Victoria/Westminster are two of the best.
A more traditional choice is one of London’s older deluxe hotels. The
Cadogan Hotel in Chelsea, The Gore in South Kensington, and Hazlitt’s
1718 in Soho have all been around for a century or more. These hotels
offer a distinctly English kind of style, full of charm and character.
The older deluxe hotels are offset by the hippest-of-the-hip: the St.
Martin’s Hotel, an Ian Schrager concoction in a converted office block.
Chain properties
But maybe you always stay at one of the chain hotels — a Crowne Plaza,
a Hyatt, or a Marriott — places that are basically the same no matter
where they are: They rely on their brand name and a no-surprise
approach to win customers. London is chock-full of chain hotels, if that’s
what you fancy. Most of them cater to large groups, and you may feel
rather anonymous in them. On the other hand, these hotels are usually
well equipped for people with disabilities and families with children.
Landmark hotels
At the top of the hotel spectrum, in both price and prestige, are the land-
mark hotels: Claridge’s, the Dorchester, the Park Lane Sheraton, and
The Savoy. These famous hotels are among the best in the world. In
each of them, you can expect glamorous public salons, a generously pro-
portioned and well-decorated room with a large private bath, an on-site
health club or access to one nearby, and top-of-the-line service.
Self-catering options
You can also consider staying at a self-catering hotel, where you do the
cooking in the kitchen in your own hotel room. For short stays and for
one or two people, self-catering hotels don’t always beat the competi-
tion’s price. But for families and travelers who can’t afford or don’t want
to eat every meal out, self-catering hotels can be a budget-saver. For
comfort and convenience, Astons Apartments in South Kensington is
among the best.
One of the most economical ways to stay in London is to rent a self-
catering flat. The owners register their flats with rental agencies; mini-
mum rental time is usually one week. You can find a small studio flat in
Central London that sleeps two and is fully equipped for under £500
($925) per week. One of the best agencies to help you find a flat is the
Independent Traveller (% 01392/860807; www.gowithit.co.uk).
Chapter 9: Checking In at London’s Best Hotels and B&Bs 105

Finding the Best Room at the Best Rate
The maximum rate that a hotel charges for a type of room is the rack
rate. If you walk in off the street and ask for a room for the night, the
hotel may charge you this top rate. Hotel rates, like airline fares, change
all the time, and it’s impossible to list the most current “specials” a hotel
is offering on its Web site. So the rack rate is what I use as a hotel price
guide in this book.
Be aware that you don’t have to pay the rack rate. Hardly anybody does.
Just ask for a cheaper or discounted rate. The result is often favorable
when savvy travelers make this request. Hotels in London are eager to
fill their beds, and most of them are willing to negotiate a room rate.
Read on for more strategies on getting a good rate.
Finding the best rate
The rate you pay for a room depends on many factors, and the way you
make your reservation is the most important. The following strategies
can help you get the best rate available:
 Call around. I recommend that you call both the U.S. toll-free
number and the local London number for the prospective hotel. I
know that calling both sources takes time and costs money, but the
quoted rates can vary so widely that you may save a bundle.
(Smaller and less expensive B&Bs and hotels generally don’t have
toll-free numbers in the States, so you have to call, fax, or e-mail
those establishments directly.)
 Ask about discounts. If you make your reservation with a large
chain hotel, be sure to mention membership in AARP, frequent-flier
programs, and any other corporate rewards program. Budget
hotels and small B&Bs rarely offer these organization discounts,
but with larger hotels, you never know when the mention may be
worth a few pounds off your room rate.
 Travel off-season and on weekends. Room rates change with the
season and as occupancy rates rise and fall. You’re less likely to
receive discount rates if a hotel is close to full, but if it’s nearly
empty, you may be able to negotiate a significant discount.
Expensive hotels catering to business travelers are most crowded
on weekdays and usually offer big discounts for weekend stays.
You may be able to save 20 percent or more by traveling off-season,
which is mid-October to mid-December and January to March.
 Choose a package tour. The best rates of all will probably be with
an air/hotel package (see Chapter 5). With these packages, which
are sometimes astonishingly cheap, you have to choose a hotel
that’s part of the package. Airline package hotels tend to be larger
chains. So what? The money you save may amount to hundreds of
dollars.
Part III: Settling into London 
106

 Use a travel agent. A travel agent may be able to negotiate a better
room rate than you could get by yourself. The hotel gives the agent
a discount in exchange for steering his or her business toward that
hotel.
Surfing the Web for hotel deals
Another great source for finding hotel deals is the Internet. Nowadays,
almost all hotels, even those in the budget range, have Web sites. (I list
each hotel’s Web site with the other hotel information, later in this chap-
ter.) Special promotional offers are often available only on the hotel’s
Web site, so it pays to do some checking.
You can also use search engines to help you locate a London hotel.
Although the major travel-booking Web sites (Arthur Frommer’s Budget
Travel Online, Travelocity, Microsoft Expedia, Yahoo!, and Smarter Living)
offer hotel booking, you may be better off using a Web site devoted to
lodging because more-general sites don’t list all types of properties. Some
lodging sites specialize in a particular type of accommodations, such as
bed-and-breakfast inns, which aren’t on the more mainstream booking
services. Other services, such as TravelWeb (see the following list), offer
weekend deals on major chain properties that cater to business travelers
and have more empty rooms on the weekends.
Some good all-purpose Web sites that you can use to track down and
make online reservations at hotels in London include the following:
 All Hotels on the Web (www.all-hotels.com) doesn’t actually
include all the hotels on the Web, but it does have tens of thousands
of listings throughout the world, including London. Bear in mind
that each hotel in the list has paid a fee ($25 and up) for placement,
so the list is not objective, but more like online brochures.
 British Hotel Reservation Centre (www.bhrc.co.uk) lists current
and seasonal specials at selected London hotels.
 HotelDiscount.com (www.hoteldiscount.com) lists bargain rates
at hotels in U.S. and international cities, including London. If you
click “London” and input your travel dates, the site provides a list
of the best prices for a selection of hotels in various neighborhoods.
 Independent Traveller (www.gowithit.co.uk) lists hundreds of
self-catering accommodations in London. These are private flats,
not hotels, and are available for a one-week minimum period; they
can be a fantastic bargain.
 London Bed & Breakfast (www.londonbandb.com) can provide
inexpensive accommodations in select private homes.
 London Bed and Breakfast Agency Ltd. (www.londonbb.com) is
another reliable B&B-finder in London.
 The Londontown (www.londontown.com) Web site has a long list
of hotels to choose from, including some with special offers.
Chapter 9: Checking In at London’s Best Hotels and B&Bs 107

 SeniorSearch U.K. (www.wiredseniors.com/ageofreason) is a
site for seniors looking for special hotels and other forms of accom-
modations, including home and apartment exchanges.
 TravelWeb (www.travelweb.com) lists more than 16,000 hotels
worldwide, focusing on chains, such as Hyatt and Hilton. You can
book almost 90 percent of the properties online. Its Click-It
Weekends, updated each Monday, offers weekend deals at many
leading chains.
 Uptown Reservations (www.uptownres.co.uk) provides listings
for dozens of B&Bs in private homes in London.
Reserving the best room
After you know where you’re staying, asking a few more questions can
help you land the best possible room. For example:
 Ask about staying in a corner room. They’re usually larger, qui-
eter, and brighter, but they may cost a bit more.
 Ask about staying in a room in the back of the building. In
London, especially, traffic noise can be loud and annoying. In the
back, you may get a room that overlooks a quiet garden.
 If your London hotel is a high-rise, request a room on a high
floor. Being farther away from the street means your room may be
quieter. Plus, a higher room may give you the added bonus of a
better view.
 Ask whether the hotel is renovating. If the answer is yes, request a
room away from the renovation work, and make sure you ask again
when you check in.
 If you have any physical impairments, be sure to ask whether the
hotel has a lift (elevator). Many small and older hotels in London
do not have elevators. If the hotel lacks a lift, ask whether a ground-
floor (first floor) room is available.
 Inquire about the location of restaurants, bars, and meeting facil-
ities, which can be noisy.
 If you aren’t happy with your room when you arrive, return to
the front desk right away. If another room is available, the staff
should be able to accommodate you, within reason.
Arriving without a Reservation
Whatever your hotel choice in London, I want to remind you again:
Booking ahead is a good idea. Why waste precious vacation time search-
ing for a hotel? If you do arrive without a reservation, your first option is
Part III: Settling into London 
108

to start calling the hotels directly. Keep in mind that smaller B&Bs don’t
accept reservations late in the evening. You can also book rooms
through the trustworthy agencies in the following list, but the first one
doesn’t have phone service so you must show up in person.
 The Britain & London Visitor Centre (1 Regent St.; Tube: Piccadilly
Circus) is open weekdays 9 a.m. to 6:30 p.m. (from 9:30 a.m. on
Mon) and on Saturday and Sunday 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. (Sat June–Sept
9 a.m.–5 p.m.). The Visitor Centre doesn’t have phone service, 
so you have to show up in person to get help reserving a room
somewhere.
 British Hotel Reservation Centre (% 020/7340-1616; www.bhrc.
co.uk) offers a 24-hour phone line. The center provides free reser-
vations and discounted rates at all the leading hotel groups and the
major independents. This agency operates a reservations desk
(open daily 6 a.m. to midnight) at the Underground station of
Heathrow Airport.
 First Option Hotel Reservations (% 020/7808-3861) is another
hotel booking service. This hotel booking agency operates kiosks
at the following Central London rail stations: Charing Cross (% 020/
7976-1171); Euston (% 020/7388-7435); Kings Cross, by Platform 8
(% 020/7837-5681); Paddington (% 020/7723-0184); and Victoria,
by Platform 9 (% 020/7828-4646).
London’s Top Hotels
Every recommended hotel in this chapter has a $ symbol to help you
home in on your price limit. These symbols reflect a hotel’s high- and
low-end rack rates for a double room. Table 9-1 shows what you can
expect in terms of accommodations type, room size, and standard
amenities in the five price categories.

These accommodations are relatively simple
and more likely to be found in B&Bs than
hotels. Rooms will likely be small, and in-
room amenities such as a telephone and tel-
evisions are not necessarily provided. You
may have to share a bathroom. In a B&B, you
will get breakfast.

$$
£96–£149/$176–$275
A bit classier, these midrange accommoda-
tions offer more room, more extras (such as
irons, hair dryers, or a microwave), and a
more convenient location than the preceding
category. You probably get breakfast.
$$$
£150–£203/$276–$375
Higher-class still, these accommodations
begin to look more upscale and service
begins to factor in. Many chain hotels are in
this category. You’ll have a roomier private
bathroom, cable TV, and other in-room
amenities, and there will probably be a cafe
or restaurant on the premises. You may or
may not get breakfast.
$$$$
£204–£257/$376–$475
Hotels in this category will generally meet
high international standards and be found in
upscale neighborhoods. Porter and room
service will be available. Think fine furnish-
ings, larger bathrooms with designer toi-
letries, high-quality bedding, chocolates on
your pillow, a classy restaurant, and a knowl-
edgeable concierge. There will be a fine
breakfast available, but you’ll probably have
to pay for it.
$$$$$
£257/$475 and up
These top-rated accommodations generally
come with luxury amenities, such as valet
parking, 24-hour room service, a gourmet
restaurant, on-site spa and health club, large
bathrooms, high-end furnishings and high-
quality sheets, DVD/CD players, turn-down
service — it’s all great, and you pay through
the nose for it. Breakfast will be available but
not included in the price. The great London
“name” hotels fall into this category.
Sorry, you can’t escape that annoying 17.5 percent value-added tax
(VAT). In general, the quoted room rate includes the VAT (except for
rooms at the upper end of the price scale). Be sure to ask, though, so
you won’t get an unpleasant surprise when you’re checking out. Unless I
note otherwise, the VAT is included in the rates for my recommended
hotels.

The Abbey Court
$$–$$$$
Notting Hill
This small, graceful hotel, with a flower-filled front patio and a rear con-
servatory where breakfast is served, is located in a renovated mid-
Victorian townhouse near Kensington Gardens. The 22 charming guest
rooms feature 18th- and 19th-century country antiques and marble bath-
rooms equipped with Jacuzzi tubs, showers, and heated towel racks. You
can enjoy 24-hour room service and take advantage of the services of the
concierge, who can help arrange for babysitting.

020/7792-0858. www.abbeycourthotel.co.uk. Tube: Notting Hill Gate (then a
five-minute walk north on Pembridge Gardens Road). Rack rates: £110–£250
($204–$463) double. AE, MC, V.
Abbey House
$
Kensington
For tranquility and affordability in a great location (next to Kensington
Gardens and Palace), this small, family-run B&B can’t be beat. Although
modernized, the 1860s-era building retains many original features. The 16
spacious guest rooms (some triples and quads suitable for families) have
central heating and wash basins; every two units share a bathroom. The
décor is cheerful and practical.

(then a five-minute walk east on Kensington High Street and north on Kensington
Church Street). Rack rates: £74 ($137) double without bathroom. English breakfast
included. No credit cards accepted.
Aster House
$$–$$$
South Kensington
Found at the end of an early Victorian terrace, this beautifully renovated
(in 2000) nonsmoking charmer was named “Bed and Breakfast of the Year”
by the London Tourism Awards in 2001 and 2002. Each of the 12 guest
rooms is individually decorated in English country-house style, some with
four-poster, half-canopied beds and silk wallpaper. The new bathrooms
come with power showers. The breakfasts, served in the glassed-in garden
conservatory, are more health-conscious than those served in most
English B&Bs.

Astons Apartments
$–$$
South Kensington
In three carefully restored Victorian red-brick townhouses, Astons offers
value-packed self-catering accommodations, some ideal for families. Each
studio has a compact kitchenette, a small bathroom, and bright functional
furnishings. The more expensive executive studios feature larger bath-
rooms, more living space, and extra pizzazz in the décor. If you like the
idea of having your own cozy London apartment (with daily maid service),
you can’t do better.
See map p. 118. 31 Rosary Gardens (off Hereford Square), SW7 4NQ. % 800/525-2810
in the U.S. or 020/7590-6000. Fax: 020/7590-6060. www.astons-apartments.com.
Tube: Gloucester Road (then a five-minute walk south on Gloucester Road and west
on Hereford Square; Rosary Gardens is 1 block farther west). Rack rates: £90–£125
($167–$231) double. Rates don’t include 17.5 percent VAT. AE, MC, V.
Avonmore Hotel
$–$$
Kensington
This small hotel is in a quiet neighborhood easily accessible to West End
theaters and shops. You’d be hard-pressed to find more for your money:
Each of the nine guest rooms offers a tasteful décor and an array of ameni-
ties not usually found in this price range. A few years ago, this establish-
ment was voted London’s best private hotel by the Automobile
Association (AA), and the high standards that earned that honor are still
maintained. An English breakfast is served in a cheerful breakfast room; a
bar and limited room service are also available, and the hotel can arrange
for babysitting.
See map p. 118. 66 Avonmore Rd. (northwest of Earl’s Court), W14 8RS. 
% 020/7603-4296. Fax: 020/7603-4035. www.avonmorehotel.co.uk. Tube: West
Kensington (then a five-minute walk north on North End Road and Mattheson Road
to Avonmore Road). Rack rates: £60–£90 ($111–$167) double without bathroom,
£80–£110 ($148–$204) double with bathroom. English breakfast included. AE, MC, V.
Bryanston Court Hotel
$$
Marylebone
Located in a neighborhood with many attractive squares, this 200-year-old
hotel is one of Central London’s finest in the moderate price range. The
refurbished hotel has 54 small guest rooms (with equally small bathrooms)
that are comfortably furnished and well maintained. You find a welcoming
bar with a fireplace in the back of the lounge.
See map p. 120. 56–60 Great Cumberland Place (near Marble Arch), W1H 7FD. 
% 020/7262-3141. Fax: 020/7262-7248. www.bryanstonhotel.com. Tube: Marble
Arch (then a five-minute walk north on Great Cumberland Place to Bryanston Place).
Rack rates: £120 ($222) double. Continental breakfast included. AE, DC, MC, V.

Byron Hotel
$$
Bayswater
The family-run 45-room Byron occupies a Victorian house that’s been thor-
oughly modernized but hasn’t lost its traditional atmosphere. The guest
rooms have ample closets, tile baths, and good lighting. Breakfast is served
in a cheery dining room. The staff members are pleasant and helpful, and
the hotel can provide child cots and help with special requirements for
children’s meals. Considering the amenities offered, this establishment
offers an especially good value.

Cadogan Hotel
$$$$–$$$$$
Chelsea
You feel transported back to the Victorian era at this beautiful 69-room
hotel, with a small wood-paneled lobby and sumptuous drawing room
(good for afternoon tea), close to all the exclusive Knightsbridge shops.
The Cadogan (pronounced Ca-dug-en) is the hotel where poet, playwright,
and novelist Oscar Wilde was staying when he was arrested (room 118 is
the Oscar Wilde Room). The large guest rooms, many overlooking the
Cadogan Place gardens, are quietly tasteful and splendidly comfortable,
with large bathrooms. The sedate Edwardian restaurant is known for its
excellent cuisine.

$$–$$$$$
Knightsbridge
On a quiet Knightsbridge cul-de-sac a few blocks from Harrods, this cozy
place is considered one of London’s best B&Bs. The public rooms feature
Georgian-era accessories, 19th-century oil portraits, elegant antiques, and
leather-covered sofas. The 29 guest rooms are smart and cozy, with marble
bathrooms with tubs and power showers. The price includes an excellent
English breakfast.

Comfort Inn Notting Hill
$$
Notting Hill
You’ll get a lower room rate at this chain-hotel franchise if you book
directly with them instead of through central reservations. Located on a
quiet, pretty street off Notting Hill Gate, the Comfort Inn stretches across
five terrace houses and has 64 fair-size rooms on the three upper floors.
(There’s an elevator.) Rooms have been redecorated with a nice traditional
look and equipped with firm new beds; a few newly redone rooms are on
a charming interior courtyard. Standard amenities include dataports, cof-
feemakers, and hair dryers. The bathrooms are also newly renovated.

included. AE, DC, MC, V.
Covent Garden Hotel
$$$$–$$$$$
Covent Garden
Created from an 1850s French hospital and dispensary, this boutique hotel
surrounds guests in luxury. No two of the 50 guest rooms are alike. Many
rooms have large windows with rooftop views. The décor is a lush mix of
antiques and fine contemporary furniture, and the granite-tiled bathrooms
with glass-walled showers and heated towel racks are among the best in
London. The wood-paneled public rooms are just as impressive. On-site
Brasserie Max serves up eclectic bistro food and is a chic place to lunch.
If you don’t get enough exercise touring London, you can keep in shape at
the small gym on the premises.

The Cranley
$$$–$$$$
South Kensington
On a quiet street near South Kensington’s museums, the Cranley occupies
a quartet of restored 1875 townhouses. Luxuriously appointed public
rooms and 39 high-ceilinged, air-conditioned guest rooms — with original
plasterwork, a blend of Victorian and contemporary furnishings, and up-
to-the-minute, in-room technology — make this property a standout. The
bathrooms are large and nicely finished, with tubs and showers. Rates
include tea with scones in the afternoon and champagne and canapés in
the evening.

Dorset Square Hotel
$$$$–$$$$$
Marylebone
This sophisticated, 38-room, luxury boutique hotel occupies a beautifully
restored Regency townhouse overlooking Dorset Square, a private garden
surrounded by graceful buildings. Inside and out, this hotel is the epitome
of traditional English style. Each guest room is unique, filled with a superla-
tive mix of antiques, original oils, fine furniture, fresh flowers, and richly
textured fabrics. The bathrooms are marble and mahogany (just remem-
ber that some of those enticing little toiletries aren’t free).

Durrants Hotel
$$$
Marylebone
Opened in 1789 off Manchester Square, this 92-room hotel provides an
atmospheric London retreat. The pine-and-mahogany-paneled public
areas, including an 18th-century letter-writing room and a wonderful
Georgian room that serves as a restaurant, are quintessentially English.
The guest rooms are generously proportioned (for the most part) and
nicely furnished, with decent-size bathrooms.

Manchester Street). Rack rates: £165 ($305) double. AE, MC, V.
Fairways Hotel
$
Paddington
This large, late-Georgian house from the 1820s is a real bargain. Stephen
Adams, who took over the management from his parents (they ran the
hotel for 25 years), made several improvements in 2002, laying new car-
peting and redoing all the communal toilets and showers. All 17 rooms are
different, the ones in back much quieter. Some of the private bathrooms
are much smaller than others. Coffeemakers and hair dryers are in the
rooms, but the phone is in the hallway and, to keep prices low, breakfast
is not included in the low room rate.

Fielding Hotel
$$
Covent Garden
Named for author Henry Fielding (famous for The History of Tom Jones),
the Fielding is on a beautiful old street (now pedestrian-only) lit by 19th-
century gaslights and across from the Royal Opera House. The stairways
are steep and narrow (the hotel has no elevator), and the 24 rather
cramped guest rooms are undistinguished in decor, but they do have
showers and toilets. Those quibbles aside, this quirky hotel is an excel-
lent value. A small bar is on the premises, and the area is loaded with cafes,
restaurants, and fabulous shopping.
See map p. 116. 4 Broad Court, Bow Street, WC2B 5QZ. % 020/7836-8305. Fax:
020/7497-0064. www.the-fielding-hotel.co.uk. Tube: Covent Garden (then
a five-minute walk north on Long Acre and south on Bow Street). Rack rates:
£100–£130 ($185–$241) double. AE, DC, MC, V.
Five Sumner Place
$$
South Kensington
This 14-room charmer — one of the best B&Bs in Kensington — occupies
a landmark Victorian terrace house that has been completely restored in
an elegant English style. The guest rooms are comfortably and tradition-
ally furnished; all have bathrooms (a few have refrigerators, as well). You
can enjoy a full range of services, including breakfast in a Victorian-style
conservatory.

$$$$$
Westminster and Victoria
Overlooking Buckingham Palace Mews, this unique, 18-room boutique
hotel is the epitome of luxury and offers superior personal service. The
hotel lobby and breakfast room is an elegant conservatory that was once
the waiting room for debutantes who were going to Buckingham Palace to
be presented. Every detail in the beautifully furnished rooms, from the
Frette sheets to the Penhaligon toiletries, is pure luxe. The staff here is
wonderfully friendly.

The Gallery
$$–$$$
South Kensington
This relatively unknown 36-room hotel, located near the cultural and retail
attractions in South Kensington and Knightsbridge, occupies two com-
pletely restored and converted Georgian residences. The elegant guest
rooms are individually designed and include half-canopied beds and
marble-tiled bathrooms. The lounge, with its rich mahogany paneling and
moldings and deep colors, has the ambience of a private club. The over-
all decor is wonderfully Victorian, but every modern convenience is avail-
able, including wireless Internet. Two of the suites have their own roof
terraces.

Gate Hotel
$–$$
Notting Hill
This tiny, three-story building dates from the 1820s (when people were evi-
dently much smaller), so the six color-coordinated guest rooms are cramped
but atmospheric, and the stairs are steep. The Gate is one of only two hotels
along the length of Portobello Road, famous for its antiques shops and
Saturday bric-a-brac stalls. Kensington Gardens is a five-minute walk away.
Be sure to introduce yourself to Bilko, the talkative resident parrot.

The Gore
$$$–$$$$
South Kensington
If you dream of the days of Queen Victoria, you’ll definitely appreciate the
Victorian-era charm of the Gore, which has been in more or less continu-
ous operation since 1892. On a busy road near Kensington Gardens and
the Royal Albert Hall, the Gore is loaded with historic charm: walnut-and-
mahogany paneling, oriental rugs, and 19th-century prints. Each of the 54
guest rooms is unique, filled with high-quality antiques and elegant fur-
nishings, including old commodes that conceal the toilets.

Grange Strathmore Hotel
$–$$$
South Kensington
Formerly the residence of the 14th earl of Strathmore, the late Queen
Mum’s father, this hotel overlooks a private garden square just minutes
from the South Ken museums. Some of the guest rooms feature a high-
ceilinged spaciousness rare in London hotels, and bathrooms with tubs
and showers. Plenty of hand-carved rosewood furniture and well-chosen
fabrics decorate the rooms. One drawback is that on weekends, no gen-
eral manager is on duty; also, service can sometimes be rather impersonal.

Harlingford Hotel

Bloomsbury
In the heart of Bloomsbury, this wonderfully personable and immaculately
maintained hotel occupies three 1820s townhouses joined by an array of
staircases (no elevators) and hallways. The 44 guest rooms (all unique)
are pleasantly comfy, some graced with floral prints and double-glazed
windows to cut down on noise; the best rooms are on the second and third
levels. The bathrooms are very small, however. The hotel has family rooms
and can provide cots for children. Guests have use of the tennis courts in
Cartwright Gardens.

Hart House Hotel
$$
Marylebone
A Georgian townhouse built in 1782 and used by members of the French
nobility during the French Revolution, Hart House is one of the most wel-
coming and professionally run B&Bs in London. It has retained its dignified
entrance hall and polished paneling. The 16 rooms (all nonsmoking) are
attractive and comfortable with small but immaculate bathrooms. Double-
glazing on the windows screens out the traffic roar on Gloucester Place.
Some very large rooms, perfect for families, have big bathtubs and show-
ers, and the staff can help you arrange babysitting.

Hazlitt’s 1718
$$$$
Soho
Built in 1718 (you may have guessed it from the name), this intimate, 23-
room gem offers old-fashioned atmosphere and a hip Soho location.
Recent restoration exposed original wood paneling and other features
hidden for years, but the hotel still lacks an elevator. The charming
Georgian-era guest rooms feature mahogany and pine furnishings and
antiques, as well as lovely bathrooms, many with claw-foot tubs. The back
rooms are quieter; the front rooms are lighter, but without the quieting
effect of double-glazed windows, you do hear the street noise.

Hotel La Place
$$
Marylebone
This desirable hotel, north of Oxford Street, caters to women traveling
alone. The interior has been upgraded to boutique-hotel standards
(although the exterior isn’t especially impressive); the 21 moderate-size
guest rooms are done in classic English style, with mahogany furnishings,
brocades, TV armoires, and writing desks. The bathrooms are as nice as
the rooms. The hotel’s Jardin is a chic, intimate wine bar/restaurant; you
also find an Internet cafe on the premises.

Hotel 167

South Kensington
Hotel 167 attracts hip young visitors drawn by the price, and business
people who like its central location (and the price). This hotel is bright
and attractive, offering 16 comfortable guest rooms, each with a decent-
size bathroom (some with showers, others with tubs). The rooms are fur-
nished with a mix of fabrics and styles. Nearby Tube stations make the
hotel convenient to the rest of London, and the busy neighborhood itself
is fun to explore.

Imperial Hotel
$$
Bloomsbury
The décor is dated and the exterior epitomizes the worst of 1960s archi-
tecture, but so what? The 448-room Imperial is a full-service hotel and a
terrific value. Nine floors are guest rooms; the third floor is entirely non-
smoking. The hotel does plenty of tour-group business, but the rooms
have stood up well to the traffic. They’re all a decent size, with unusual
triangular-shaped bay windows, good storage space, and workable bath-
rooms. Amenities include a restaurant, a late-hour Internet cafe, concierge,
and room service.

James House and Cartref House
$
Westminster and Victoria
Sitting across the street from each other, with a total of 19 rooms between
them, James House and Cartref House are among the top budget B&Bs in
London. Each guest room is individually designed and comfortably fur-
nished; some of the larger ones contain bunk beds, which makes them suit-
able for families. Fewer than half have private bathrooms. The English
breakfast is hearty (but ends at 8:30 a.m.), and the place is remarkably well
kept. Neither house has an elevator, but guests don’t seem to mind. Both
are completely smoke-free. It doesn’t matter to which house you’re
assigned; both are winners.

This nonsmoking hotel offers a bit of Georgian charm, a great location near
the British Museum and West End theaters, a nice comfortable atmos-

Landmark London
$$$$$
Marylebone
The finest Victorian railway hotel in England when it opened in 1899, the
Landmark was recently restored to its former glory. The hotel sits in a
great location, particularly if you’re with kids, because Madame Tussaud’s
wax museum and Regents Park are only around the corner. Built around an
eight-story atrium, the 299 rooms are among London’s largest and feature
marble bathrooms. The hotel offers every amenity, including babysitting,
a large health club, and an indoor pool.

Westminster and Victoria
This attractive, brick-fronted townhouse is located near Buckingham
Palace, Westminster Abbey, and the Houses of Parliament. It’s nicely fur-
nished, with deep cornices in the hall and statues and flowers in the
alcoves up the stairs. The more expensive of the 26 rooms are quite luxu-
rious, with swagged curtains, canopied beds, and pretty furniture; others
are more simply furnished, but all are generally larger and have more
amenities than you usually find in this price range. The bathrooms are
small. The front rooms have small balconies overlooking Ebury Street; the
rear rooms are quieter and look out over a small garden.

Westminster and Victoria
The outside of this big, stuccoed, family-run hotel gleams bright white and
all the guest rooms have been freshly renovated with private bathrooms
installed. The 36 rooms vary widely in size, but with their pleasant décor
and newly tiled bathrooms (all with showers), they beat all the dowdy,
badly designed hotels and B&Bs for miles around. The reception area and
smart-looking breakfast room (now totally nonsmoking) are also new. The
look throughout is refreshingly light, simple, and modern.

This fine, midsize hotel near Paddington Station stretches across four
Georgian townhouses and is kept in tiptop shape. The assortment of
accommodations makes it great for families: two-bedroom family suites
come with a private bathroom, and superior family suites that face quiet,
leafy Talbot Square have a toilet and tub/shower off a private corridor. All
69 rooms are above-average size for London; those at the back are quieter,
though the view north across back alleys to Paddington isn’t very inspir-
ing. A pleasant lounge and bar, and even an elevator, are on-site.

Sometimes called the “Iron Lady of Piccadilly” because it’s so well built,
this landmark hotel opened in 1927. Executive rooms and suites are dec-

marble bathrooms. The price goes up according to location (particularly
if it’s a suite overlooking Green Park), size, and décor. Every conceivable

South Kensington
This hotel occupies six refitted Victorian terrace houses. A Chippendale
fireplace graces the lobby, and five Empire chandeliers suspended verti-
cally, one on top of the other, hang in one of the stairwells. The 210 modern
guest rooms are subdued and attractive, with good-size bathrooms. The
one downside is that the air-conditioning system on the west side of the
building can be pretty loud on hot summer nights. Guests can use the
health club with steam rooms and saunas.

One of Europe’s largest hotels, the 920-room Regent Palace sits at the edge

design. About a quarter of the guest rooms now contain toilets and show-

(an attendant provides you with soap and towel). With a lobby that looks
like an airport ticket counter (expect lines on weekends) and an endless
flow of tourists, feeling anonymous here is easy. But step out the door and

Chapter 10
Dining and Snacking 
in London
In This Chapter
 Discovering what’s new and what’s hot
 Locating the best dining neighborhoods
 Reviewing my favorite restaurants in London
 Listing restaurants by neighborhood, cuisine, and price
You can still find traditional English dishes in London: Yorkshire pud-
ding, fish and chips, or bangers and mash (sausages and mashed
potatoes). So if you want to sample the old cuisine, you won’t be disap-
pointed. But London now offers a vast array of culinary choices; more
than 5,700 restaurants prepare the cuisines of more than 60 countries.
This chapter explains what you need to know about new trends; tradi-
tional, modern, and ethnic cuisines; spots favored by locals; and finding
a bargain. I list my favorite London dining spots, too.
For a glossary of English food terms, see the Cheat Sheet at the begin-
ning of this book.
Getting the Dish on the Local Scene
London is now considered one of the food capitals of the world, and its
restaurant scene is a volatile one. To be trendy and talked about, a London
restaurant must have a celebrity owner, a celebrity chef, a solid reputa-
tion, a great view, a chic location, and/or an unmistakable ambience —
and, of course, memorable food helps, too. But two trends are worth
noting: The days of Sir Terence Conran’s mega-eateries — places that
held hundreds of diners — are pretty much over; and, in a city where
even an ordinary meal can easily cost £25 ($46), Londoners are looking
more and more toward ethnic foods and restaurants that don’t charge
exorbitant prices.
Multicultural London is always in the midst of culinary evolution. The
local food horizon expanded as the postwar generation began to travel

outside England, experiencing new cuisines, and as “exotic” foods
became more readily available in the markets.
Traditional “plain English cooking” — undeniably hearty but sometimes
considered dull — is certainly still prevalent in London, and the style is
even enjoying renewed interest and respect. The best traditional dishes —
game, lamb, meat and fish pies, and roast beef with Yorkshire pudding —
are readily available. Modern British cuisine takes old standards and deli-
ciously reinvents them with foreign influences and ingredients, mostly
from France (sauces), the Mediterranean (olive oil, oregano, and garlic),
and northern Italy (pasta, polenta, and risotto). Besides Modern British,
London foodies continue to favor classic French and Italian cuisines.
Indian cooking has been a favorite ethnic food for some time. In fact,
curry is now considered a “national” dish. London is filled with Indian
restaurants (about 1,500 of them) serving curries and dishes cooked in
clay tandoori pots. Balti, a thick curry from Pakistan, is one of the more
recent ethnic must-try dishes in London. Other new influences making
their way into Modern British cooking come from Thailand and Morocco.
For more on English cooking, see Chapter 2.
If you want to dine in a restaurant, reserving a table is always a good
idea. At all but the “smartest” London restaurants, you can usually get a
table on fairly short notice during the week, especially if you’re willing to
dine before 7 p.m. or after 9 p.m.
Nonsmoking sections are becoming more common in London’s restau-
rants (not in pubs), but the sections aren’t always effectively smoke-free.
You may be in the same room as the smokers, just in a different area. If
smoking bothers you, ask about the restaurant’s nonsmoking section
when you call to reserve your table.
Discovering the top dining areas
London offers a mouth-watering mix of restaurants; you can enjoy a
wide variety of foods throughout the city. Soho and neighboring Covent
Garden offer the most choices in the West End, with British, African,
Caribbean, Mongolian, American (North and South), French, Italian,
Spanish, Thai, Korean, Japanese, Middle Eastern, Eastern European,
Modern European, Turkish, and vegetarian all represented. South
Kensington makes up another eclectic grab bag of culinary choices.
Unlike some other large cities, ethnic restaurants aren’t grouped
together within specific areas of Central London. However, several
Chinese restaurants are clustered along Lisle, Wardour, and Gerrard
streets in Soho’s Chinatown. And Notting Hill has long been a standby
for low-price Indian and Caribbean restaurants.

Eating with the locals
Londoners, like the residents in any large city, have their favorite neigh-
borhood eateries. Pubs, cafes, and wine bars are places where locals go
for casual meals that aren’t as expensive as restaurants.
Ordering up pub grub
If you’re not into ethnic dining, then pubs are your best bet for getting a
good meal for a low price. The food is generally traditional and down to
earth: meat pies and mash (mashed potatoes), fish and chips, mixed
grills (sausages and a chop or cutlet), salads, sandwiches, and the
famous ploughman’s lunch (bread and cheese, or pâté). Pub food may be
prepackaged and frozen and then microwaved. However, more and more
pubs resemble casual restaurants. There is a new genre of pub restau-
rants called gastropubs, where the cooking is fresher, more adventurous,
and better prepared than at traditional pubs.
Pubs are drop-in places, and finding a table at lunchtime isn’t always
easy. Pubs don’t accept reservations. Usually, you order your food from
the serving counter and your drinks from the bar, and then seat yourself.
Sometimes there is table service. Pub grub is generally washed down
with beer, the British national drink. Draft beer in Britain is served at
room temperature, as are most soft drinks. Bottled imported beer,
served cold, is generally available but more expensive.
Unless a pub has a special children’s certificate, kids under 14 are allowed
only into the gardens and separate family rooms. The legal drinking age
in the United Kingdom is 18, although restaurants can serve beer or
cider to kids over 16 who order a meal. Pubs tend to be smoky.
Wining and dining at wine bars
Londoners may love to knock back a pint of beer at their local pub, but
when it comes to dining, wine is the favored accompaniment. You can
get wine in a pub, but the choices will be limited. Wine bars, on the
other hand, are dedicated to good food and good grape, most of it
imported from France, Australia, and South America. Wine bars are more
upscale than pubs and usually less smoky. Like pubs, wine bars don’t
permit children under 14, except in gardens or family rooms. Be aware
that a meal in a wine bar costs more than a similar meal in a pub.
Kicking back at cafes
London’s cafes generally serve light, inexpensive food and offer limited
menus. Most people enjoy a cup of coffee or pot of tea and a sandwich.
The cakes and other sweets may tempt you, too.
Gays and lesbians on the lookout for low-priced meals in groovy gay-
friendly environments flock to Soho’s gay cafes and bars. These trendy
hangouts serve good, low-priced meals and pay serious attention to
decor.
Chapter 10: Dining and Snacking in London 145

Trimming the Fat from your Budget
If the thought of paying $50 dinner tabs gives you heartburn, you can
visit pubs, cafes, sandwich bars, and pizza places to get good, economi-
cal food. And, of course, you can find fast-food chains throughout the
city. Another alternative: Many of London’s top restaurants offer fixed-
price meals (also called set-price or prix-fixe meals), which allow you to
order two to three courses from a limited menu for a set price that is
cheaper than ordering the courses individually. Sometimes these bar-
gains are called pre- or post-theater menus, and they’re served only from
about 5:30 to 7 p.m. and after 9:30 p.m. Wine is expensive, so forgo that if
price is an issue. And try your splurge-dining at lunch, when prices are
often one-third less than those at dinner and the food is the same.
Restaurants automatically add that annoying 17.5 percent VAT (value-
added tax) to your tab. They may tack on a moderate cover charge for
bread (even if you don’t eat it), as well.
Plenty of unwary tourists double-tip without realizing it. Some restau-
rants add a service charge to your bill and also have a tip area on the
credit-card receipt that you sign. Be aware that the words service charge
included on a menu mean that a gratuity will automatically be added to
your bill. When the bill arrives, you’re not expected to leave any addi-
tional tip. If the menu says service not included, however, leave a tip of at
least 15 percent for acceptable service.
At the end of a meal, Americans ask for a “check,” whereas Brits ask for
the “bill.”
London’s Best Restaurants
London is home to more than 5,700 restaurants. As you can imagine,
choosing which establishments to include in this chapter of my favorites
was a monumental task. I try to cover as much of Central London as pos-
sible. If you want to get the flavor of merry old England, I include some
of the oldest and most respected London restaurants serving traditional
English food. For the more chic and trendy among you, I include restau-
rants that serve the best of Modern British cuisine, as well as hybrids of
British/French and British/Continental. For people on a budget — or
who just want to eat in a down-to-earth, amiable environment — I also
review some of the best London pubs. All the establishments are easy to
get to, and you can reach all of them by taking the Underground (Tube)
system and perhaps walking a bit. For indexes of the restaurants by
neighborhood, cuisine, and price, see the end of this chapter. For loca-
tions, see the maps in this chapter.
Each restaurant I review is given one to four dollar signs ($). The dollar
signs indicate the average price of a meal, including an appetizer, entree,
and nonalcoholic beverage. Table 10-1 lists the dollar amounts used for
each dollar sign. Please bear in mind that if you order the most expensive

entree and a bottle of wine, a $$ restaurant will become a $$$$ restau-
rant. On the other hand, if you order from a set-price menu, a $$$$
restaurant tab may dip down to $$.

The Kid Friendly icon in front of a restaurant name indicates that the
place is suitable for families with children. These restaurants welcome
families and may offer a children’s menu.
Note that restaurant prices in this chapter do not include the 17.5 per-
cent VAT (value-added tax). Unfortunately, you can’t avoid paying this
extra expense.
Aubergine

Chelsea
FRENCH
You compete with celebrities, royalty, and commoners for the privilege of
dining at this top-name restaurant, but it’s well worth the effort. You’ll have
to give your credit-card number when booking and be prepared to pay £50
($93) if you don’t show. Every dish, from the fish and lighter Mediterranean-
style choices to assiette of pork on creamed savoy cabbage and bacon, is a
culinary achievement of the highest order, winning two Michelin stars. And
the celebrated cappuccino of white beans with grated truffle makes a perfect
ending to a superb dining experience. The service is polished and efficient.

The skinny on the beef
Sirloin, so the story goes, got its name from James I when he was a guest at Houghton
Tower in Lancashire. When a succulent leg of beef was placed before him, he knighted
it with his dagger, crying, “Arise, Sir Loin!”

Boxwood Café
$$$
Knightsbridge
MODERN BRITISH
This may be the most stylish kid-friendly restaurant in London, but
grownups will find plenty of comforting delights on the menu, too. Created
by Gordon Ramsay, Boxwood Café is chic without being fussy, and the
same goes for the food, which emphasizes fresh and healthy dishes rang-
ing from a baked macaroni of wild mushrooms and parmesan to fresh
steamed fish, grilled calf’s liver, roast chicken salad, veal, and steaks. The
entire restaurant is nonsmoking.
See map p. 152. In the Berkeley Hotel, Wilton Place, SW1. % 020/7235-1010.
Reservations recommended. Tube: Knightsbridge (then a five-minute walk east on
Brompton Road). Main courses: £14–£25 ($26–$46); fixed-price lunch: £21 ($39); chil-
dren’s menu: £7.50 ($14). AE, DISC, MC, V. Open: Mon–Fri noon–3 p.m.; Sat–Sun noon
to 4 p.m.; daily 6–11 p.m.
Brasserie St. Quentin
$$
South Kensington
FRENCH
London’s most authentic-looking French brasserie, St. Quentin attracts
many people in the city’s French community (a positive sign for a French
restaurant outside of France). Mirrors and crystal chandeliers add a touch
of elegance. The brasserie has excellent-value fixed-price meals, two or
three courses, both at lunch and pre-theater. These menus offer a blend of
classic and updated French fare, from shoulder of lamb with root vegeta-
bles to roast monkfish. Vegetarian options include artichoke fondant with
seasonal vegetables, spinach ravioli, and warm leek salad.
See map p. 152. 243 Brompton Rd., SW3. % 020/7589-8005. Reservations required.
Tube: South Kensington (then a five-minute walk east on Brompton Road). Main
courses: £11–£24 ($19–$44); fixed-price lunch and pre-theater (6:30–7:30 p.m.) menus:
£15–£17 ($28–$31). AE, DC, MC, V. Open: Daily noon to 3 p.m.; Mon–Sat 6–11:30 p.m.,
Sun 6:30–10:30 p.m.
Cafe in the Crypt
$
Piccadilly Circus and Leicester Square
BRITISH
Eating in a crypt may not be everyone’s idea of fun, but eating in this crypt —
below St. Martin’s-in-the-Fields church on Trafalgar Square — is an inex-
pensive London dining experience that you won’t forget. The food is basic
but good, served cafeteria-style. Choose from a big salad bar; traditional
main courses, such as shepherd’s pie; filled rolls; and delicious soups. One
fixture is that most traditional of British desserts, bread-and-butter pud-
ding (bread soaked in eggs and milk with currants or sultanas and then
oven-baked). The cavernous, candlelit room with its great stone pillars is
wonderfully atmospheric.
See map p. 150. St. Martin-in-the-Fields, Duncannon St., WC2. % 020/7839-4342.
Tube: Charing Cross (then a three-minute walk west to Trafalgar Square). Main
courses: £5.95–£7.50 ($11–$14); fixed-price meal: £5.25 ($9.70). No credit cards. Open:
Mon–Wed 10 a.m.–7:30 p.m.; Thurs–Sat 10 a.m.–10:15 p.m.

Chelsea Kitchen
$
Chelsea
INTERNATIONAL
A London institution, Chelsea Kitchen has been feeding locals and drop-ins
since 1961. At this simple place with a dinerlike atmosphere, both the
plates and the crowds move fast. Menu staples include leek-and-potato
soup, chicken parmigiana, spaghetti Bolognese, omelets, burgers, goulash,
and lamb chops. Kids enjoy the casual atmosphere and simple foods.
See map p. 152. 98 King’s Rd. (off Sloane Square), SW3. % 020/7589-1330.
Reservations recommended. Tube: Sloane Square (the restaurant is at the beginning
of King’s Road just west of the square). Main courses: £3–£6.50 ($5.55–$12); fixed-
price menu: £6–£7 ($11–$13). No credit cards. Open: Mon–Sat 7:30 a.m.–11:45 p.m.
Chiang Mai
$$
Soho
THAI
Chiang Mai is next door to Ronnie Scott’s, the most famous jazz club in
England (see Chapter 16), so it’s a good stop for an early dinner before a night
on the town. Named after the ancient northern capital of Thailand (known for
its rich, spicy foods), this unpretentious but pleasant place is good for green
curry noodles, hot-and-sour beef, fish and chicken dishes, pad thai noodles
with various toppings, and vegetarian meals. I suggest that you order a
couple of different courses and share. Children’s specials are available.
See map p. 150. 48 Frith St. (off Soho Square), W1. % 020/7437-7444. Tube: Tottenham
Court Road (then a five-minute walk west on Oxford Street and south on Soho Street;
Frith Street is at the southwest corner of Soho Square). Main courses: £4.50–£7.50
($8.35–$14); fixed-price lunch: £7.50 ($14); fixed-price pre-theater (5:30–7 p.m.) menu:
£8.50 ($16). AE, DC, MC, V. Open: Mon–Sat 12:30–3 p.m. and 4:30–11 p.m., Sun
5:30–10:30 p.m.
Cigala
$$
Bloomsbury
SPANISH
This hip restaurant has attracted its share of celebs, in part because it
serves great tapas. Order two or three tapas per person and then share.
Some possibilities include chorizo (sausage with hot paprika sauce), oak-
smoked cured beef, marinated sardines, wind-dried tuna, olives, and
scrambled eggs with artichokes. At lunch or dinner, you may prefer to
begin with something like spicy chorizo and lentil soup, and follow up with
an entree of pork loin with potatoes. The vegetarian stew is bland and not
particularly memorable, but the dish of scallops with pancetta, sherry
vinegar, and lentils is delectable, and so is the paella, which requires 30
minutes of preparation.
See map p. 150. 54 Lamb’s Conduit St., WC1N 3LW. % 020/7405-1717. Tube: Holborn
(then a seven-minute walk east on High Holborn and north on Red Lion Street, which
becomes Lamb’s Conduit when you cross Theobald’s Road). Main courses: £12–£18
($22–$33); tapas: £3–£5.50 ($5.55–$10); fixed-price lunch (Mon–Fri): £16–£19 ($30–$35).
AE, MC, V. Open: Mon–Fri noon to 3 p.m. and 6–10:45 p.m., Sat 12:30–3:30 p.m. and
6–10:45 p.m., Sun 12:30–9:30 p.m.
Chapter 10: Dining and Snacking in London 157

Clarke’s
$$$
Notting Hill
MODERN EUROPEAN
This bright modern restaurant, owned by chef Sally Clarke, is among the
hottest in town. There’s a four-course fixed-price dinner menu as well as a
two-course lunch and a Saturday brunch. The menu changes daily but
always emphasizes British produce and Mediterranean-style charcoal-grilled
foods with herbs and organically grown vegetables. A typical meal may
include an appetizer of grilled goat cheese crostini with fresh tomato chut-
ney; an entree of wild sea bass roasted with tarragon and lemon hollandaise;
followed by an assortment of cheeses with oatmeal biscuits and celery, plus
warm bitter chocolate pudding with whipped cream and raspberries.
See map p. 154. 124 Kensington Church St., W8. % 020/7221-9225. Reservations
essential. Tube: Notting Hill Gate (then a five-minute walk south on Kensington
Church Street). Fixed-price menus: two-course lunch £9.50–£15 ($18–$28), 4-course
dinner £50 ($93). AE, DC, MC, V. Open: Mon–Fri 12:30–2 p.m., Sat 11 a.m.–2 p.m.,
Tues–Sun 7–10 p.m.
Criterion Grill
$$–$$$
Piccadilly Circus and Leicester Square
BRITISH/FRENCH
It’s almost worth coming to the Criterion just to see its Byzantine palace
interior with gold vaulted ceiling. The food — a mixture of modern French
and British standards — doesn’t quite match the grandeur of the décor,
but it’s generally quite good. You can order Brit faves like haddock or
sausages, or French faves like slow-roast duck with apple sauce or steak
au poivre. This place is smack-dab on Piccadilly Circus, so it’s wonderfully
convenient. The fixed-price lunches and dinners are a great deal.
See map p. 155. 224 Piccadilly, W1. % 020/7930-0488. Reservations recommended.
Tube: Piccadilly Circus (the restaurant is right on Piccadilly Circus). Main courses:
£11–£23 ($20–$43); fixed-price lunch and pre-theater dinner (5:30–7 p.m.): £15–£18
($28–$33). AE, DC, MC, V. Open: Daily noon–2:30 p.m., Mon–Sat 5:30–11:30 p.m.
Dickens Inn by the Tower
$–$$
The City
TRADITIONAL/MODERN BRITISH
This former spice warehouse is now a three-story restaurant with sweep-
ing Thames and Tower Bridge views. The ground-floor Tavern Bar serves
a variety of traditional pub food. Pizza on the Dock, a floor above and a
good spot for families, offers four sizes of pizza. Grill on the Dock, on the
top floor, is a relatively formal dining room serving Modern British cuisine;
specials include steaks and a variety of charcoal-grilled dishes.
See map p. 148. St. Katharine’s Way (near the Tower of London), E1. % 020/7488-2208.
Reservations recommended. Tube: Tower Hill (then a ten-minute walk east on Tower
Hill East and south on St. Katherine’s Street to St. Katherine’s Way). Main courses: Grill
on the Dock £13–£20 ($24–$37); Tavern Bar £5–£7.50 ($9.25–$14); Pizza on the Dock
£9–£15 ($17–$28). AE, DC, MC, V. Open: Grill on the Dock daily noon to 3 p.m. and
6:30–10:30 p.m.; Tavern Bar daily 11 a.m.–3 p.m.; Pizza on the Dock daily noon to 10 p.m.

Ebury Wine Bar & Restaurant
$$
Westminster and Victoria
MODERN BRITISH/INTERNATIONAL
This popular wine bar offers a surprisingly good and varied menu and
excellent wines. The narrow, woodsy, attractive interior is reminiscent of
a Paris bistro. In addition to steaks, the oft-changing menu features tradi-
tional dishes and specials such as chicken-and-bacon terrine with red
onion marmalade or rich mushroom-y sausages with mash and onion
gravy.
See map p. 149. 139 Ebury St., SW1. % 020/7730-5447. Reservations recommended.
Tube: Victoria (then a ten-minute walk west on Belgrave Street and south on Ebury
Street). Main courses: £10–£20 ($19–$37); fixed-price lunch and pre-theater dinner:
£13 ($24). Cover £2 ($3.70). AE, DC, MC, V. Open: Daily noon–2:45 p.m. and 6–10 p.m.
Ed’s Easy Diner
$
Soho
NORTH AMERICAN
It may seem strange to go to London to visit this replica of an old American
diner, where customers perch on stools at a wraparound counter and
listen to old songs blaring from the jukebox, but it’s a safe bet for the kids.
A bit more authentic than the version at the Pepsi Trocadero in Piccadilly
Circus, this Ed’s still attracts a fair share of teens. If you’ve a yen for the
cholesterol-laden food that you’re supposed to avoid, chow down with
Ed’s big burgers with fries or onion rings, or giant kosher weenies
slathered with cheddar cheese. On the lighter side, you can get a veggie
burger, tuna salad, or a chicken Caesar salad.
See map p. 150. 12 Moor St. (off Cambridge Circus), W1. % 020/7439-1955. Tube:
Leicester Square (then a five-minute walk north on Charing Cross Road and west on
Moor Street). Main courses: £5–£6.50 ($9.25–$12). MC, V. Open: Mon–Thurs 11:30 a.m.
to midnight, Fri and Sat 11:30 a.m.–1:00 a.m., Sun 11:30 a.m.–11:30 p.m.

Covent Garden
VEGETARIAN
Covent Garden offers a plethora of expensive restaurants for meat-eaters,
so this basement hole-in-the-wall with cafeteria-style service is a pleasant
and welcome alternative. The menu changes constantly, but the daily soup
is always a treat (such as carrot and fresh coriander), and the main
courses can include a sweet and tangy Jamaican curry, Italian bean casse-
role, and cannelloni ripieni (stuffed with eggplant), as well as daily quiche
and salad specials. The desserts generally include simple fare, such as
apple-and-rhubarb crumble and fruit with yogurt.

Fortnum & Mason

St. James’s
TRADITIONAL BRITISH
Fortnum & Mason, a posh, legendary London store that’s a “purveyor to
the Queen” and famous for its food section (see Chapter 12), also has three
restaurants. The mezzanine-level Patio is a good lunch spot, with a menu
that offers an assortment of pricey sandwiches and main courses, includ-
ing hot and cold pies (steak and kidney, curried fish and banana, chicken,
and game) and Welsh rarebit (thick melted cheese poured over toast) pre-
pared with Guinness stout. The lower-level Fountain offers breakfast and
lunch, and the fourth-floor St. James’s serves lunch and afternoon tea. The
more well heeled dine at St. James’s, where the menu is traditionally
British: For starters, try the kipper (smoked herring) mousse or potato and
Stilton brûlée; main courses include pies and roast rib of Scottish beef.
Although crowded with tourists, these three establishments remain pleas-
ant places where you can get a good meal and a glimpse of the fading
Empire. The Fountain and Patio are good places to dine with a family.

This unique pub is one of the best places in town for a big English break-
fast. Butchers from the nearby Smithfield meat market, nurses coming off
of their night shifts, clerks from the City, and tycoons have been eating
enormous breakfasts here since 1898. The full house breakfast plate comes
with at least eight items, including sausage, bacon, kidneys, eggs, beans,
black pudding, and a fried slice of bread, along with unlimited tea or coffee,
toast, and jam. You can order breakfast until 3 p.m., and breakfast is the

The Gay Hussar is considered to be one of the best Hungarian restaurants

restaurant serves undeniably authentic Hungarian comfort food: chilled
wild-cherry soup, caraway potatoes, cabbage stuffed with minced veal and
rice, tender chicken served in mild paprika sauce with cucumber salad
and noodles, and, of course, veal goulash with egg dumplings. The por-

Joe Allen

Covent Garden
NORTH AMERICAN
Joe Allen is a low-profile place on a back street in Covent Garden. Its
crowded dining room with checkered tablecloths is the sort of place where
actors like to come after a performance to scarf down chili con carne or
gnaw on barbecued ribs. The dependable food includes American classics
with some international twists, and the set menu is a real value: After a
starter (maybe smoked haddock vichyssoise, a cold soup with fish), you
can choose main courses such as pan-fried Parmesan-crusted lemon sole,
Cajun chicken breast, and grilled spicy Italian sausages. If you’re a tad
homesick, try a burger, a brownie, and a Coke for consolation. Come before
the show for the best prices, come after for potential star-gazing.

interior decor is appealingly minimalist, and the service is impeccable.
Spanning broadly divergent regions of China, the ambitious menu features
Cantonese quick-fried beef in oyster sauce, lobster with Szechuan pepper

The menu for this bistro is English with an underplayed (some may say
underdeveloped) French influence. Behind a brightly colored storefront,
the dining room is covered with clusters of Japanese parasols, rococo mir-
rors, paintings, and old photographs. Depending on the season, the fixed-
price menu may start with smoked mackerel pâté or leek and Stilton tart

polenta. The dessert extravaganza known as “Mrs. Langan’s Chocolate

Mela

Winner of Moët & Chandon’s 2001 award for best Indian restaurant in
London, Mela claims to take its inspiration from a food stall favored by
workers in Delhi. Lunch here is a fantastic deal: curry or dahl of the day,
with bread, pickle, and chutney for under £2 ($3.70). Pay a little more, and
you can build your own version of the meal with different breads and top-
pings. This is a great, inexpensive way for curry novices to have a try —
and to see it being made in the open kitchen. But do come back in the
evening for a proper go at the innovative Indian country cuisine. Early
birds get three courses. Fixed-price sharers have ten dishes and accom-
paniments between them. The word mela means “fair,” and Mela the

serve many of the same dishes for lunch and dinner. Everything is home-
made and fresh, and the ambience is informal and fun. The menu includes
many fish dishes, including sea bass and Dover sole. Pasta da Vinci, a
house specialty, is pasta cooked in a paper bag with a sauce of squid, mus-
sels, and prawns. Salad lovers can try the Mona Lisa salad with mozzarella,
tomatoes, crispy bacon, avocado, and basil.

tikka, a staple of northern India, or the biriani dishes — where chicken,

dine on tablecloths. The superlative river-and-city views are just as sub-
lime, so book in advance and insist on a window table. The food has taken
on more fusion elements but remains as good as ever. Order such tasty
dishes as roasted halibut with fried sweet potato or twice-cooked pork

1798, Rules is London’s oldest restaurant, with two centuries worth of
prints, cartoons, and paintings decorating its walls. If you’re game for
game, go for it because that’s what Rules is famous for. On the menu, you
may find lobster and asparagus salad with mango dressing, or fallow deer
with spiced red cabbage, blueberries, and bitter chocolate sauce. The food
is delicious: traditional yet innovative, until you get to the puddings
(desserts), which are a mix of nursery and dinner-dance classics. In recent
years, the restaurant has added fish and a few vegetarian dishes. The

San Lorenzo
$$$
Knightsbridge
ITALIAN
This fashionable restaurant was once a favorite of Princess Diana. Italian
cuisine from all the regions of Italy, with a special nod toward Tuscany and
the Piedmont, is the specialty. Seasonal fish, game, and vegetables appear
in such dishes as risotto with fresh asparagus, partridge in white-wine
sauce, and tagliate di bue (filet steak with arugula and balsamic vinegar).
The fettuccine, gnocchi, and penne are all homemade. The food is reliably
good, but some diners complain that too much attitude accompanies it.
Dining here is mostly about people-watching.

Shepherd’s
$$$
Westminster and Victoria
TRADITIONAL BRITISH
This popular restaurant sits between Tate Britain and Parliament. Regulars
include a loyal crowd of barristers and MPs (a bell rings in the dining room
to let them know it’s time to go back to the House of Commons for a vote).
Amid a nook-and-cranny setting of leather banquettes, sober 19th-century
accessories, and English portraits and landscapes, you can dine on rib of
Scottish beef with Yorkshire pudding, hot salmon and potato salad with
dill dressing, cheese and onion tart, filet of lemon sole, or steak-and-kidney
pie. You choose everything from a fixed-price menu but are given an
impressive number of options.

Simpson’s-in-the-Strand
$$$
The Strand
TRADITIONAL/MODERN BRITISH
Open since 1828, Simpson’s offers an array of the best roasts in London —
sirloin of beef, saddle of mutton with red-currant jelly, and Aylesbury duck-
ling — served by a veritable army of formal waiters. (Remember to tip the
tailcoated carver.) For a pudding, try the treacle roll and custard or Stilton
with vintage port. You’ll find these food options downstairs, where the
atmosphere is formal and dressy; Simply Simpson, a more relaxed,
brighter, lighter dining area on the second floor, is actually (gasp!) nou-
velle. You can also come downstairs for a great real English breakfast.

Now here’s a dining bargain! This simple bi-level restaurant in the heart of
the West End doesn’t offer refined cooking, but the food is filling and the
price is right — making it a good spot for families. You can find such fare
as minestrone soup, spaghetti Bolognese (the eternal favorite), braised
lamb, and apple crumble on the fixed-price daily menu. (During peak
dining hours, you may have to share a table with other guests.)

Mayfair
PACIFIC RIM/INTERNATIONAL
For relaxed, charming, bistrolike ambience in Mayfair, check out Suze. The
food is Australasian with some international crossovers and is always simple
and well prepared. Try the succulent New Zealand green-tipped mussels, a
house specialty, or a New Zealand meat or fish pie. You can also get New
Zealand rack of lamb. You can choose from several sharing platters: Italian
antipasti, vegetarian, Greek, seafood, and cheese. A must-have dessert is
Pavlova, a light meringue covered with kiwi, strawberries, passion fruit, and
mangoes. And, of course, you can get a fine glass of Australian wine.

Veeraswamy
$$
Piccadilly Circus & Leicester Square
INDIAN
Established in 1926 by a general and an Indian princess, Veeraswamy
claims to be the oldest Indian restaurant in London. Over the years, it’s
been the haunt of princes and potentates, from the Prince of Wales to King
Hussein and Indira Gandhi. Nowadays, it’s very hip, painted in vibrant
colors, with frosted-glass panels dividing up the sections and ultramod-
ern furniture. For starters, the stir-fried mussels with coconut and Kerala
spices are sublime. For an exotic and only mildly hot choice, try the
shanks of lamb curried in bone stock and spices. Unless you’re in the
mood to splurge, this isn’t the place to sample lots of different dishes. Go
for a great-value fixed-price menu and enjoy the best of new Indian cuisine.

Veronica’s
$$
Bayswater
TRADITIONAL/MODERN BRITISH
The food here is an intriguing mix of historical and modern British cuisine.
One dining room has a Victorian theme, and the other is avant-garde.
Diners choose their meals from the “In the Present” contemporary menu
and/or the “From the Past” menu. The historic dishes are creative spins
on medieval, Tudor, and Victorian recipes. Your appetizer may be an
Elizabethan salad called salmagundy, made with crunchy pickled vegeta-
bles, followed by twice-roasted duck or a filet steak. Many dishes are veg-
etarian, and desserts from the past include such temptations as Lord John
Russell’s frozen pudding with butterscotch sauce.

Wagamama Noodle Bar
$
Soho
JAPANESE
Try this trendsetting noodle bar, modeled after the ramen shops of Japan,
if you’re exploring Soho and want a delicious, nutritious, smoke-free meal.
You enter along a stark, glowing hall with a busy open kitchen and descend
to a large open room with communal tables. The specialties are ramen,
Chinese-style thread noodles served in soups with various toppings, and
the fat white noodles called udon. You can also order various rice dishes,
vegetarian dishes, dumplings, vegetable and chicken skewers, and tem-
pura. Your order is sent via radio signal to the kitchen and arrives the
moment it’s ready, which means that not everyone in a group is served at
the same time. You may have to stand in line to get in, but it’s worth the
wait. Teens especially love the loud, hip, casual atmosphere. Several other
Wagamamas are scattered around London.

Ye Olde Cheshire Cheese

The City
TRADITIONAL BRITISH
Opened in 1667 and a one-time haunt of Samuel Johnson, Charles Dickens,
and Fleet Street newspaper scandalmongers, Ye Olde Cheshire Cheese is
London’s most famous chophouse. The place contains six bars and two
dining rooms and is perennially popular with families and tourists looking

for some Olde London atmosphere. The house specialties include “ye
famous pudding” (steak, kidney, mushrooms, and game), Scottish roast
beef with Yorkshire pudding and horseradish sauce, and fish and chips. If
those choices repulse the kids, they can choose sandwiches or salads.

Zafferano

ITALIAN
At Zafferano, you find the best Italian food in London, served in a quietly
elegant, attitude-free restaurant. The semolina pastas are perfectly cooked
and come with various additions. The main courses, such as roast rabbit
with Parma ham and polenta, charcoal-grilled chicken, and tuna with
arugula and tomato salad, are deliciously simple and tender. For dessert,
try the sublime ricotta and lemon cake.

Dining and Snacking on the Go
Londoners have a much less casual attitude toward food than Americans
have. You won’t see many adults in London eating on the street or
having a bite while traveling the Tube. It’s mostly tourists carrying those
Starbucks cups. And you don’t find street vendors peddling hot dogs
and other foods from carts (although you may see a fast-food van or two
near major attractions). Even the most frenetic Londoner likes to eat a
proper, civilized “sit-down” meal. So what’s a too-rushed tourist to do?
To help you enjoy snacks and light meals the London way, I offer some
interesting alternatives to fast-food restaurants.
Sandwich bars
Sandwiches are an English invention (supposedly of the Earl of Sandwich),
and sandwich bars are a faster and cheaper alternative to sit-down restau-
rants and pubs. Most open early for breakfast and close in the afternoon.
You can usually eat at a counter or in booths, or you can take your sand-
wich and go to the nearest park for an alfresco lunch. The bars sell coffee,
tea, and nonalcoholic beverages.
Americans are sometimes confused by the way the English name their
sandwiches. In general, the Brits use the word mayonnaise the way that
Americans use salad. Tuna mayonnaise or egg mayonnaise simply means
Part III: Settling into London 
172

“tuna salad” or “egg salad.” The word salad is used in Britain to denote
that lettuce and tomato have been added to a sandwich, as in “chicken
with salad.”
The following sandwich bars are worth a bite:
 Near Victoria Station, Capri Sandwich Bar (See map p. 149; 16
Belgrave Rd., NW1; % 020/7834-1989; Tube: Victoria) serves an
imaginative variety of sandwiches. The bar is open Monday
through Friday 7:30 a.m. to 3:30 p.m.
 If you’re in the vicinity of Euston Station, try the unpretentious but
cheerful Giovanni’s Sandwich Bar (See map p. 150; 152 North
Gower St., at Euston Road; % 020/7383-0531; Tube: Euston), open
Monday through Friday 7 a.m. to 3 p.m.
The best sandwich shops in Central London are the Pret à Manger chain
stores, which offer fresh, inventive, healthy sandwiches and fast counter
service. A convenient West End branch is located at 77–78 St. Martin’s
Lane, WC2 (See map p. 150; % 020/7379-5335; Tube: Leicester Square).
It’s open Monday through Thursday 7:30 a.m. to 9 p.m., Friday 7:30 a.m.
to 11 p.m., Saturday 9 a.m. to 11 p.m., and Sunday 9 a.m. to 9 p.m. You’ll
find Pret à Manger all over the city.
Fish and chips
The English call a fish and chips place a chippie. At some chippies, the
food is wonderful; at others, it’s hideous. At the good places (the only
ones that I recommend), the fish (usually cod, haddock, or plaice) is fresh,
the batter crisp, and the fries (chips) hand-cut. You can get tartar sauce,
but the British also like to splash their fish and chips with malt vinegar.
The following restaurants all have sit-down and takeaway (what the Brits
call takeout) service and welcome families with kids. Also see the North
Sea Fish Restaurant in the section “London’s Best Restaurants,” earlier
in this chapter.
 Costas Fish Restaurant (See map p. 154; 18 Hillgate St., W8; % 020/
7727-4310; Tube: Notting Hill Gate) is open Tuesday through
Saturday noon to 2:30 p.m. and 5:30 to 10:30 p.m.
 Fryer’s Delight (See map p. 150; 19 Theobald’s Rd., WC1; % 020/
7405-4114; Tube: Chancery Lane or Holborn) is across from the
Holborn Police Station. A plate of cod and chips costs £4.95 ($9.15);
takeaway is also available. The Formica-clad chippie is open
Monday through Saturday noon to 10 p.m. The fish is fried in beef
fat here; other options include pastries and pies.
 Geales (See map p. 154; 2 Farmer St., W8; % 020/7727-7969; Tube:
Notting Hill Gate) is open Tuesday through Saturday noon to 3 p.m.
and 6 to 10:30 p.m.
Chapter 10: Dining and Snacking in London 173

 Golden Hind (See map p. 150; 73 Marylebone Lane, W1; % 020/
7486-3644; Tube: Baker Street or Bond Street) is a few blocks south
of Madame Tussaud’s. This bargain chippie has an average meal
cost of £6 ($11); hours are Monday through Friday noon to 3 p.m.
and Monday through Saturday 6 to 10 p.m.
 Rock & Sole Plaice (See map p. 150; 47 Endell St., WC2; % 020/
7836-3785; Tube: Covent Garden) offers all-day takeaway service,
as well as a place to sit down and eat amid the bustle of the Covent
Garden Piazza (you can get a table on the lower level). Because of
its location, this chippie crowds with theatergoers in the evening.
You pay at least £8 ($15) for a meal. It’s open Monday through
Saturday 11:30 a.m. to 10:30 p.m. and Sunday noon to 10 p.m.
 Seafresh Fish Restaurant (See map p. 159; 80–81 Wilton Rd., SW1;
% 020/7828-0747; Tube: Victoria) offers a good cod filet and great
chips for about £8.50 ($16). It’s open Monday through Friday noon
to 3 p.m. and 5 to 10:30 p.m.
 Sea-Shell (See map p. 154; 49–51 Lisson Grove, NW1; % 020/7723-
8703; Tube: Marylebone) is within easy walking distance west of
Madame Tussaud’s and is considered one of the best chippies in
London. Main courses range from £7 ($13) to £16 ($26); average cost
for fish and chips is about £9 ($17). It’s open Monday through Friday
noon to 2:30 p.m. and 5 to 10:30 p.m., Saturday noon to 10:30 p.m.
Costas Fish Restaurant and Geales are both good choices if you’ve been
poking around the antiques and whatnot stands along Portobello Road.
Department-store restaurants
If you’re in the midst of a shopping spree and don’t want to be dis-
tracted, you can easily grab a bite at one of the many department-store
restaurants. These eateries are convenient, but they aren’t necessarily
cheap; see the restaurant entry for Fortnum & Mason in the section
“London’s Best Restaurants,” earlier in this chapter.
Here are some more department-store possibilities:
 Harrods (87–135 Brompton Rd., SW1; % 020/7730-1234; Tube:
Knightsbridge), in addition to its ice-cream parlor and awe-inspiring
Food Hall, offers its Famous Deli Counter, where you can perch on
stools (no reservations) and pay too much for what’s called “tradi-
tional Jewish food” but often isn’t. It’s open Monday through
Saturday 10 a.m. to 6 p.m.
 Harvey Nichols (109–125 Knightsbridge, SW7; % 020/7235-5250;
Tube: Knightsbridge) is another Knightsbridge emporium with a
restaurant, the Fifth Floor at Harvey Nichols (See map p. 152). It’s
open Monday through Friday noon to 3 p.m. and 5:30 to 10 p.m.,
but eating here is pretty expensive. A better bet is the cafe, also on
the fifth floor, where you can get a cup of tea and a salad or light
Part III: Settling into London 
174

meal; it’s open Monday through Saturday 10 a.m. to 11 p.m. and
Sunday 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. Like Harrods, Harvey Nichols has a fabu-
lous food emporium where you can buy now and eat later.
Treating Yourself to Tea
The stereotype is true: Brits do drink tea. In fact, they drink 171 million
cups per day (give or take a cup), though consumption is dropping
because of the new emphasis on coffee. Teatime is traditionally from
about 3:30 to 5 p.m. Your afternoon tea can be a lavish affair served by 
a black-coated waiter in a posh hotel lobby, or a quick “cuppa” with a
slice of cake or a sandwich at a corner tea shop or pâtisserie (a bakery
where you can sit down or get pastries to take away). Tea may be served
fast-food style in paper cups, home-style in mugs, or more elegantly on
bone china.
So what exactly, you ask, is the difference between afternoon tea and
high tea?
 Afternoon tea is tea with cakes, scones, sandwiches, or all of them,
served between 3 and 5 p.m. It’s a pre-dinner ritual.
 High tea, served from about 5 to 6 p.m., is a more elaborate affair,
including a light supper with a hot dish, followed by dessert and
tea. It often is the evening meal.
Casual tea rooms and pâtisseries
In the following comfortable neighborhood tearooms and pâtisseries,
you can get a good cup of tea, along with a scone or other pastry or a
plate of tea sandwiches, for about £4 to £10 ($7.40–$19):
 Café Parlour at Sketch (See map p. 150; 9 Conduit St., W1; % 0870/
777-4488; Tube: Oxford Circus): Offers superb pastries and cakes in
a room that makes up the patisserie component of the ultrahip
Sketch, a gastro-empire founded by Pierre Gagnaire. You can also get
breakfast and lunch. Worth a visit just to see the loos. Hours are
Monday through Friday 8 a.m. to 11 p.m., Saturday 10 a.m. to 11 p.m.

Never too latte: London’s coffee bars
It had to happen sooner or later, and frankly I’m glad it did because finding a good cup
of coffee in London wasn’t always the easiest thing to do. But now Starbucks has
opened branches all over the city, offering nice places to sit down and have a latte,
cappuccino, or “regular” cup of joe. They also sell pastries and sandwiches.

 Muffinski’s (See map p. 150; 5 King St., WC2; % 020/7379-1525;
Tube: Leicester Square) offers great homemade muffins, including
low-fat and vegetarian. Hours are Monday through Friday 8 a.m. to
7 p.m., Saturday 9 a.m. to 7 p.m., and Sunday 10 a.m. to 6 p.m.
 Pâtisserie Cappucetto (See map p. 150; 8 Moor St., W1; % 020/
7437-9472; Tube: Leicester Square) serves breakfast, sandwiches,
soups, and superb desserts Monday through Thursday 8 a.m. to
11:30 p.m. and Friday and Saturday 8 a.m. to 12:30 a.m.
 Pâtisserie Deux Amis (See map p. 150; 63 Judd St., WC1; % 020/
7383-7029; Tube: Russell Square) is a good choice for a quick bite.
Hours are Monday through Saturday 9 a.m. to 5:30 p.m. and Sunday
9 a.m. to 1:30 p.m.
 Pâtisserie Valerie (See map p. 150; 44 Old Compton St., W1; % 020/
7437-3466; Tube: Leicester Square or Tottenham Court Road) has
been around since 1926 and serves a mouthwatering array of pas-
tries, but expect to stand in line night or day. Hours are Monday
through Friday 7:30 a.m. to 8 p.m., Saturday 8 a.m. to 6:30 p.m., and
Sunday 9 a.m. to 6 p.m.
Pâtisserie Valerie also has two branches in Marylebone. One is at
105 Marylebone High St., W1 (% 020/7935-6240; Tube: Bond Street
or Baker Street); the other is near Regent’s Park at 66 Portland Place,
W1 (% 020/7631-0467; Tube: Regent’s Park). The Marylebone
branch is open Monday through Saturday 7:30 a.m. to 6 p.m., and
Sunday 9 a.m. to 6 p.m. The Regent’s Park branch stays open until 
7 p.m. and opens at 8 a.m. on Sundays.
 Richoux has three old-fashioned tearooms in choice London loca-
tions. They serve food all day long, and they’re kind to your budget.
Richoux-Knightsbridge (See map p. 152; 215 Brompton Rd., SW3; 
% 020/7823-9971; Tube: Knightsbridge), Richoux-Mayfair (See
map p. 154; 41a South Audley St., W1; % 020/7629-5228; Tube:
Bond St. or Green Park), and Richoux-Piccadilly (See map p. 150;
172 Piccadilly, W1; % 020/7493-2204; Tube: Piccadilly Circus). All
keep the same hours: Monday through Friday 7 a.m. to 7 p.m.,
Saturday 7:30 a.m. to 7 p.m., and Sunday 8 a.m. to 6 p.m.
Elegant spots for high tea
A traditional afternoon English tea has cakes, sandwiches, and scones with
clotted cream and jam, and is “taken” in a posh hotel or restaurant. These
rather lavish affairs are expensive but memorable. At any one of the follow-
ing places, you can get a proper traditional afternoon or high tea (a smart-
casual dress code is in effect — tennis shoes and jeans are inappropriate):
 Claridge’s (See map p. 150; Brook St., W1; % 020/7629-8860; Tube:
Bond Street) serves a glamorous and expensive tea daily from 3 to
5:30 p.m. for £30 ($56). Reservations are a good idea.
 Fortnum & Mason (181 Piccadilly, W1; % 020/7734-8040; Tube:
Piccadilly Circus) serves tea in the St. James’s Restaurant Monday
Part III: Settling into London 
176

through Saturday from 3 to 5:30 p.m. for £20 ($37). Reservations
aren’t necessary.
 Georgian Restaurant, on the fourth floor of Harrods (See map p. 152;
87–135 Brompton Rd., SW1; % 020/7225-6800; Tube: Knightsbridge),
serves high tea Monday through Saturday from 3:45 to 5:30 p.m. It
costs £19 ($35) per person, and you don’t need reservations.
 The Lanesborough Hotel (See map p. 152; Hyde Park Corner, SW1;
% 020/72595-599; Tube: Hyde Park Corner) requires reservations
for high tea daily 3:30 to 6 p.m. The cost is £26 ($48); the price goes
up to £34 ($63) if you add strawberries and champagne.
 Palm Court at the Le Meridien Waldorf Hotel (Aldwych, WC2; 
% 020/78362-400; Tube: Covent Garden) serves afternoon tea
Monday through Friday from 3 to 5:30 p.m. at a cost of £18 to £21
($33–$39); reservations are required.
Planning a Picnic
London may not be the perfect city for picnics. Rain can quickly put a
damper on a picnic hamper, and nothing is quite as unappetizing as a
wet sandwich. But on days when the weather cooperates, nothing is
more enjoyable than packing up some sandwiches and heading to a spe-
cial spot to eat outdoors.
Glean your picnic pickings from delis and sandwich shops (see “Sandwich
bars,” earlier in this chapter), or drop in at the legendary and far more
expensive food halls at Fortnum & Mason or Harrods. In neighborhoods
outside the West End (South Kensington or Marylebone, for example), you
can go into any supermarket and generally find packaged sandwiches,
crisps (potato chips), fresh fruit, and drinks.
In the West End, the Embankment Gardens is a pretty picnic spot, look-
ing out on the Thames. This flower-filled strip of green is next to the
Embankment Tube station, below The Savoy hotel. You have to sit on
benches instead of the grass, and the traffic noise along the Embankment
can be annoying, but it’s still a nice place to know about. Sandwich shops
and takeaway food shops are clustered around the Embankment Tube
station.
Kensington Gardens (see Chapter 11) offers vast green lawns, frolic-
some fountains, Kensington Palace, and the famous statue of Peter Pan.
This spot is a favorite with children of all ages. The park is close to all
the great museums in South Ken. Adjacent Hyde Park is another lovely
picnic site, particularly along the shores of Serpentine Lake. You can buy
sandwiches and snacks at the Dell Restaurant (described under “Hyde
Park” in Chapter 11) at the east end of the lake. In summer, bandstand
concerts are given in the park.
Chapter 10: Dining and Snacking in London 177

The royal parks — Green Park and St. James’s Park — are more sedate.
You can choose to picnic on a lovely knoll and gaze upon Buckingham
Palace.
Looking for an urban space that’s good for people-watching and has
great views across the river? Picnic on the South Bank of the Thames,
along the riverside promenade close to Royal Festival Hall and the
National Theatre.

Exploring London

R
eady to hit the streets? Raring to go? Turn to Chapter 11
for descriptions of London’s top sights — along with
directions, open hours, and admission prices; you can also
ﬁnd my rundown of additional sights to see, all of them
intriguing and worth exploring. I also tell you about the 
best options for guided tours of London by bus, by boat, 
and on foot.
Check out Chapter 12 for some great tips on how to make 
the most of your shopping in London, as well as speciﬁc
stores to visit. Chapter 13 gives you four suggested London
itineraries — sightseeing strategies to help you enjoy the city
on a realistic schedule. Finally, in Chapter 14, I send you on
your way to ﬁve fascinating places that you can explore on
day trips. I think you’ll love each and every one of them.

Chapter 11
Discovering London’s 
Top Attractions
In This Chapter
 Reviewing London’s top attractions
 Finding sights and activities for history buffs, art lovers, bookworms, kids,
gardeners, and others
 Visiting royal palaces and castles
 Focusing on Greenwich, home of the prime meridian
 Listing London’s sights by neighborhood and type
H
ere’s the big question: What do you want to see and enjoy while
you’re in London? The possibilities are endless: fabulous muse-
ums, royal palaces, important historic sites, beautiful parks and gardens,
and grand churches. In this chapter, I give you the information that you
need to make your itinerary fit your interests, time, and energy level.
To help you find your way around London, you may want to go beyond
my directions in this chapter and get yourself a London A to Z map. Even
Londoners use this comprehensive street gazette, which comes in many
different formats and can be found at just about every bookstore in
London.
I arranged the top sights in this chapter alphabetically. Following the
must-see list are more top attractions grouped together by type. For
locations, see the “London’s Top Sights” map on p. 186. To help you pull
together your itinerary, see the end of this chapter, where I index all the
top attractions by neighborhood and type. For useful information about
planning workable itineraries based on the length of your trip, turn to
Chapter 13.
London’s top museums are spectacular treasure troves — and they’re all
absolutely free. To save money on transportation costs, buy one of the
single- or multiday Travelcards I describe in Chapter 8.

The Top Attractions from A to Z
British Airways London Eye
South Bank
As a piece of fast-track engineering, the 400-foot-high London Eye obser-
vation wheel is impressive. Each glass-sided elliptical module holds about
25 passengers, with enough space so you can move about freely. Although
most people stand the entire time, you can sit on the available bench if
you prefer. Lasting about 30 minutes (equivalent to one rotation), the ride
(or flight, as they call it) is remarkably smooth — even on windy days
riders don’t feel any nerve-twittering shakes. As long as the weather is
good, the wheel provides unrivaled views of London.
For the London Eye, you may want to reserve your place (with a specific
entry time) before you arrive; if you’re ticketless, you can line up for a
ticket at the office right behind the wheel, but you may have to wait an
hour or more before you can get on the wheel.
See map p. 190. Bridge Road, SE1 (beside Westminster Bridge). % 0870/500-0600
(advance credit-card booking; 50p/95¢ booking fee added). Tube: Westminster (then
a five-minute walk south across Westminster Bridge) or Waterloo (then a three-
minute walk west along the riverside promenade). Admission: £13 ($24) adults, £10
($19) seniors, £6.50 ($12) children under 16. Open: Daily 9:30 a.m.; last admission varies
seasonally.
British Museum
Bloomsbury
The British Museum ranks as the most visited attraction in London, with
a splendid, wide-ranging collection of treasures from around the world.
Wandering through the museum’s 94 galleries (see the “British Museum”
map on p. 190), you can’t help but be struck by humanity’s enduring cre-
ative spirit. Permanent displays of antiquities from Egypt, Western Asia,
Greece, and Rome are on view, as well as prehistoric and Romano-British,
Medieval, Renaissance, Modern, and Oriental collections.
In November 2000, the museum’s Great Court reopened with a glass-and-
steel roof designed by Lord Norman Foster. Inaccessible to the general
public for 150 years, the Great Court is now the museum’s new central axis.
In the center, you find a circular building completed in 1857 that once
served as the museum’s famous Reading Room. Completely restored, it
now houses computer terminals where visitors can access images and
information about the museum’s vast collections.
The most famous of the museum’s countless treasures are the superb
Parthenon Sculptures brought to England in 1801 by the seventh Lord
Elgin. These marble sculptures once adorned the Parthenon in Athens,
and Greece desperately wants them returned. Other famous treasures
include the Rosetta Stone, which enabled archaeologists to decipher
Part IV: Exploring London 
188

Egyptian hieroglyphics; the Sutton Hoo Treasure, an Anglo-Saxon burial
ship, believed to be the tomb of a 7th-century East Anglian king; and
Lindow Man, a well-preserved ancient corpse found in a bog. The museum’s
ethnography collections are filled with marvelous curiosities: everything
from a pair of polar-bear slacks worn by Eskimos to a Hawaiian god with a
Mohawk haircut, found by Captain Cook and shipped back to London.
To enhance your enjoyment and understanding of the Parthenon
Sculptures, pick up one of the sound guides available right outside Room
18 on the first floor, where the sculptures are exhibited; the guide costs
£3.50 ($6.50).
I suggest you give yourself at least three unhurried hours in the museum.
You can avoid big crowds by going on a weekday morning. If you have only
limited time for the British Museum, consider taking one of the 90-minute
highlight tours offered daily at 10:30 a.m. and 1 and 3 p.m.; these tours cost
£8 ($15). You can rent audio tours, which also cover museum highlights,
for £3.50 ($6.50). You can get tickets and information for guided tours and
audio tours at the information desk in the Great Court.
See map p. 186. Great Russell Street, WC1, between Bloomsbury Street and
Montgomery Street. % 020/7323-8000. Tube: Russell Square (then a five-minute walk
south on Montgomery Street, along the west side of Russell Square, to the museum
entrance on Great Russell Street). Admission: Free. Open: Sat–Wed 10 a.m.–5:30 p.m.,
Thurs–Fri 10 a.m.–8:30 p.m.; closed Jan 1, Good Fri, and Dec 24–26. Most of the
museum has wheelchair access via elevators; call for entrance information.
Buckingham Palace
St. James’s
Since 1837, when Victoria ascended the throne, all the majesty, scandal,
intrigue, triumph, tragedy, power, wealth, and tradition associated with
the British monarchy has been hidden behind the monumental facade of
Buckingham Palace, the reigning monarch’s London residence.
An impressive early-18th-century pile, the palace was rebuilt in 1825 and
further modified in 1913. From August through September, when the royal
family isn’t in residence, you can buy a ticket to get a glimpse of the
impressive staterooms used by Elizabeth II and the other royals. You don’t
get a guided palace tour; instead, you can wander at your own pace
through 19 rooms (including the Throne Room and the vast ballroom built
by Queen Victoria), most of them baroque, filled with some fine artwork.
In these rooms, the queen receives guests on official occasions. You leave
through the gardens where the queen holds her famous garden parties
each summer. Budget about two hours for your visit.
Throughout the year, you can visit the Royal Mews, one of the finest work-
ing stables in existence, where the magnificent Gold State Coach, used in
every coronation since 1831, and other royal conveyances are housed (and
horses stabled). The Queen’s Gallery, which features changing exhibits
of works from the Royal Collection, went through a refurbishment and
reopened for the queen’s Golden Jubilee in June 2002.

You can charge admission tickets for Buckingham Palace by calling 
% 020/7766-7300. Green Park also houses a ticket office, open daily July
29 to October 1; the office opens at 9 a.m. and closes at 4 p.m. or when the
last ticket has been sold. Keep in mind that every visitor gets a specific
time for entry into the palace, which is why phoning ahead for tickets is
smart. All phone-charged tickets cost an additional £1 ($1.85); at the ticket
booth, special rates are available for seniors, kids under 17, and families.
See map p. 186. Buckingham Palace Road, SW1. Palace Visitor Office, Royal Mews,

For a round-up of the latest Royal scandals, see Chapter 2.
Changing of the Guard at Buckingham Palace
St. James’s
Free of charge, you can stand outside Buckingham Palace and watch the
Changing of the Guard. The Foot Guards of the Household Division of the
Army, the queen’s personal guard, carry out the ritual. The Old Guard
forms in the palace forecourt before going off duty and handing everything
over to the New Guard, which leaves Wellington Barracks at precisely 11:27
a.m. and marches to the palace via Birdcage Walk, usually accompanied
by a band. The Guard consists of 3 officers and 40 men, but this number
decreases when the queen is away. The entire ceremony takes around 40
minutes. If you can’t find a spot at the front of the railings of Buckingham
Palace, you can see pretty well from the Victoria Memorial in front of the
palace.
The pageantry of the Changing of the Guard is no longer a daily occur-
rence. The event takes place at 11:30 a.m. daily April 1 to early June 
but only on alternate days at other times of the year. To avoid disap-
pointment, make sure to call ahead or check the Web site listed in the fol-
lowing paragraph.
Buckingham Palace Road, SW1. % 020/7321-2233. www.royal.gov.uk. Tube: St.
James’s Park (then a ten-minute walk north on Queen Anne’s Gate and west on
Birdcage Walk to Buckingham Gate); or Green Park (walk directly south through the
park). Admission: Free.
Chapter 11: Discovering London’s Top Attractions 191

Covent Garden Market and Piazza
Covent Garden
In 1970, the old market — the noisy, bustling public market where vendors
hawked everything under the sun — moved out of Covent Garden, and the
area became the site of London’s earliest and most successful urban recy-
cling effort. The market buildings now house dozens of enticing shops and
eating and drinking places. The wrought-iron stalls in the former Flower
Market are loaded with vendors. The piazza in front may be the most pop-
ular public gathering place outside of Trafalgar Square; the space is always
“heaving,” as the Brits say. Covent Garden is also the home of the Royal
Opera House (see Chapter 15) and two museums: the excellent Transport
Museum (see the section “Places that please kids,” later in this chapter)
and the so-so Theatre Museum (see “All manner of intriguing museums,”
later in this chapter).
Tube: Covent Garden (when you come out of the Tube stop, you’re in Covent Garden;
the Market and piazza is a one-minute walk south in a pedestrian-only zone).
Houses of Parliament and Big Ben
Westminster
The Houses of Parliament, situated along the Thames, house the land-
mark clock tower containing Big Ben, the biggest bell in the booming
hourly chime that Londoners have been hearing for nearly 150 years.
Designed by Sir Charles Barry and A.W.N. Pugin, the impressive Victorian
buildings were completed in 1857. Covering approximately 8 acres, they
occupy the site of an 11th-century palace of Edward the Confessor.
At one end (Old Palace Yard) you find the Jewel House, built in 1366 
and once the treasury house of Edward III, who reigned from 1327 to 1377.
The best overall view of the Houses of Parliament is from Westminster
Bridge, but if you prefer, you can sit in the Stranger’s Gallery to hear
Parliamentary debate.
Part IV: Exploring London 
192
More guard changing
If you miss the Changing of the Guard or the event doesn’t take place on the day of
your visit, you can still get an eyeful of London pageantry by attending the Mounted
Guard Changing Ceremony at the Horse Guards Building in Whitehall. The ceremony
takes place daily Monday through Saturday at 11 a.m. and Sunday at 10 a.m. You don’t
need a ticket, but arrive early for a good view. To get there, take the tube to Charing
Cross and walk south from Trafalgar Square along Whitehall (about a five-minute
walk); the Horse Guards Building will be on your right.

Previously, overseas visitors had to go through an elaborate procedure
weeks in advance of their trip in order to tour the Houses of Parliament.
Now, however, 75-minute guided tours are available Monday through
Saturday from the last week in July until early October. The tours cost £6
($11), and you probably want to book your ticket in advance. The London
ticket office in Westminster Hall (at the Houses of Parliament) opens in
mid-July. You can reserve by phone at % 0870/906-3773 or order tickets
online at www.firstcalltickets.com. For the rest of the year, the pro-
cedure for getting a tour is much more difficult. If you’re interested, you
can find details on the Web at www.parliament.uk.
See map p. 186. Bridge Street and Parliament Square, SW1. % 020/7219-4272. Tube:
Westminster (you can see the clock tower with Big Ben directly across Bridge Street
when you exit the Tube). Admission: Free; for tickets, join the line at St. Stephen’s
entrance. Open: Stranger’s Gallery House of Commons Mon 2:30–10:30 p.m.,
Tues–Wed 11:30 a.m.–7:30 p.m., Thurs 11:30 a.m.–6:30 p.m., most Fri 9:30 a.m.–3 p.m.;
House of Lords Mon–Wed 2:30–10 p.m., Thurs 10 a.m.–7:30 p.m. Parliament isn’t in
session late July to mid-Oct or on weekends.
Hyde Park
Westminster
Once the private hunting domain of the royals, including Henry VIII, Hyde
Park is now open to everyone and is one of the largest urban free parks in
the world. With adjoining Kensington Gardens, it offers 630 acres of lushly
landscaped lawns, magnificent flower beds, avenues of trees, and a 41-acre
lake known as the Serpentine, where you can row and sail model boats.
Rotten Row, the park’s famous 300-year-old riding track, was the country’s
first public road to be lit at night. At the northeastern tip, near Marble
Arch, is Speakers’ Corner, a famous Sunday-morning venting spot for
anyone who wants to climb up on a soapbox. Free band concerts are held
in the park’s band-shell on Sundays and Bank Holidays May to August, and
the Dell Restaurant (% 020/7706-0464), at the east end of the Serpentine,
offers cafeteria-style food and drinks Monday through Friday 10 a.m. to 4
p.m. in winter (to 5 p.m. on weekends) and 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. in summer (to
7 p.m. on weekends). The park is a pleasant place for an hour’s stroll, but
staying longer is always tempting.

and Park Lane to the east. % 020/7298-2100. Tube: Marble Arch or Lancaster Gate
on the north side (the park is directly across Bayswater Road) or Hyde Park Corner

Kensington Gardens
Kensington
Kensington Gardens adjoins Hyde Park west of the lake known as the
Serpentine. Children especially love the famous bronze statue of Peter
Pan, located north of the Serpentine Bridge. Commissioned in 1912 by
Peter Pan’s creator, J.M. Barrie, the statue marks the spot where Peter Pan
in the book Peter Pan in Kensington Gardens entered the gardens to get to
his home on Serpentine island.
The park is also home to the Albert Memorial, an ornate neo-Gothic
memorial honoring Queen Victoria’s husband, Prince Albert; the lovely
Italian Gardens; and the free Serpentine Gallery (% 020/7298-1515),
which has a reputation for showing cutting-edge art and is open daily
(except Dec 24–27 and Jan 1) 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. The Princess Diana
Memorial Playground is in the northwest corner of the park. If the
weather is fine, give yourself enough time for a leisurely stroll — at least
a couple of hours.
See map p. 186. Bounded by Kensington Palace Gardens and Palace Green on the
west, Bayswater Road on the north, Kensington Road and Kensington Gore on the

on Kensington High Street) or Queensway (which is directly across from the north-
west corner of the park). Open: Daily dawn–midnight.
Kensington Palace
Kensington Gardens
Kensington Palace was used as a royal residence until 1760. Victoria was
born in this palace, and it was here, in 1837 when she was 18 years old,

Big Ben tolls for thee
“Big Ben” isn’t the name of the clock tower or its clock. It’s the name of the largest bell
that you hear booming in that famous hourly chime. Some believe that the bell was
named after Sir Benjamin Hall, the commissioner of works when the bell was hung in
1859. Others maintain that Big Ben was named for a champion prizefighter of the time,
Ben Gaunt.
The 5-ton clock mechanism housed in the 316-foot tower kept ticking until 1976, when
it succumbed to “metal fatigue” and had to be repaired. At night, new energy-efficient
lighting now gives the illuminated clock faces a greenish tinge. The light at the very top
is lit when Parliament is in session.
Trivia buffs will be interested to know that the minute hands on each of the tower’s
four clocks are as large as a double-decker bus. For information on touring the tower
holding Big Ben, which you can do only if you write for tickets three months in
advance, go to the Web site www.parliament.uk.

that she was awakened from her slumbers and informed that she was the
new queen of England (and could move to the grander Buckingham
Palace). One wing of Kensington Palace was Princess Diana’s London home
after her divorce from Prince Charles.
The palace was home to Princess Margaret, who died in 2002, and remains
the home of the duke and duchess of Kent, so portions of it are closed 
off to visitors. But you can see the State Apartments and the Royal
Ceremonial Dress Collection’s “Dressing for Royalty” exhibit, which takes
visitors through the process of being presented at court, from the first visit
to the tailor/dressmaker to the final bow or curtsy. Dresses worn by Queen
Victoria, Queen Elizabeth II, and Princess Diana are on display. The freshly
restored King’s Apartment features a magnificent collection of Old
Masters. Give yourself about one and a half hours to view the palace.
For a pleasant and not-too-expensive tea or snack after visiting Kensington
Palace, stop in at The Orangery (% 020/7376-0239) in the gardens adja-
cent to the palace. The restaurant is open daily noon to 6 p.m. Lunches
cost about £10 ($19); from 3 p.m., you can get a good tea for £7.50 to £15
($14–$28).

adults and two children). Wheelchair accessible, despite some stairs; call first.
Leicester Square
Leicester Square
Leicester (pronounced Les-ter) Square is a crowded place with a big-city
buzz. Mimes, singers, and street entertainers of all kinds vie for attention.
Once a dueling ground, the square is now a pedestrian zone and the heart
of West End entertainment. You can find a half-price ticket booth (no
phone) for theater, opera, and dance at the south end of the square (see
Chapter 15). In the square’s center, surrounded by movie theaters and
restaurants, is Leicester Square Gardens, a small grassy park with four
corner gates named for William Hogarth, Sir Joshua Reynolds, John Hunter,
and Sir Isaac Newton, all of whom once lived or worked in the area. You
also find statues of William Shakespeare and Charlie Chaplin, a bow to the-
ater and cinema. You probably won’t want to linger long, but just walking
through the square can be fun. If you’re traveling with kids, keep in mind
this area is one place with a restroom (coin-operated).
See map p. 186. Tube: Leicester Square (take the Leicester Square exit and you’re in
the pedestrian-only zone that leads to the square).

London Zoo
Marylebone
The 36-acre London Zoo is Britain’s largest, with about 8,000 animals in
various species-specific houses. The best attractions are the Insect House
(bird-eating spiders), the Reptile House (huge monitor lizards and a 15-
foot python), the Sobell Pavilion for Apes and Monkeys, and the Lion
Terraces. In the Moonlight World, special lighting effects simulate night
for the nocturnal creatures, so you can see them in action. The newest
exhibit, Web of Life, in the Millennium Conservatory, brings together spe-
cial animal displays with interactive activities to show the interconnect-
edness and diversity of different life forms. The Children’s Zoo, with
interactive exhibits placed at low height, is designed for 4- to 8-year-olds.
Many families budget almost an entire day for the zoo; I recommend that
you give it at least three hours.
A fun way to arrive at the London Zoo is by water. The London Waterbus
Co. (% 020/7482-2660; www.londonwaterbus.com) operates single and
return trips in snug converted canal boats along the Regent’s Canal from
Warwick Crescent in Little Venice to Camden Lock Market. Take the Tube
to Warwick Avenue and walk south across Regent’s Canal, and then you
can see the moorings. Trips from both locks depart daily 10 a.m. to 5 p.m.
The round-trip fare costs £4 ($7.40).
At the north end of Regent’s Park, NW1. % 020/7722-3333. www.londonzoo.co.uk.
Tube: Regent’s Park (then bus C2 north on Albany Street to Delaney Street, ten-minute
or a half-hour walk north through the park) or Camden Town (then a 12-minute walk
south on Parkway, following the signs). Admission: £14 ($26) adults; £12 ($22) sen-
iors, students, and the disabled; £11 ($20) children 3–15; £45 ($83) families (two adults
and two children). Open: Mar 10–Oct 26 daily 10 a.m.–5:30 p.m.; Oct 27–Feb 10 daily
10 a.m.–4 p.m.; Feb 11–Mar 9 daily 10 a.m.–4:30 p.m.; closed Dec 25.
Madame Tussaud’s
Marylebone
Madame Tussaud’s wax museum is a world-famous tourist attraction and
a fun spot for older kids. The question is: Do you want to pay the exorbi-
tant admission and devote time to see a collection of lifelike figures? (If
you do go in, you need at least one and a half hours to see everything.)
The original moldings of members of the French court, to whom Madame
Tussaud had direct access (literally because she made molds of their
heads after they were guillotined during the French Revolution), are unde-
niably fascinating. And animatronic gadgetry makes the Spirit of London
theme ride fun. But the Chamber of Horrors is definitely for the ghoulish.
(Parents with younger kids may want to think twice about wandering in
here.) This exhibit allows you to see one of Jack the Ripper’s victims lying
in a pool of (wax?) blood and likenesses of mass murderers, such as Gary
Gilmore and Charles Manson. You can see better stars next door, at the
London Planetarium (see “Places that please kids,” later in this chapter).
The new Superstars exhibit features Hollywood faves like Nicolas Cage and
Samuel L. Jackson.

National Gallery
St. James’s
If you’re passionate about great art, you’ll think that the National Gallery
is paradise. This museum houses one of the world’s most comprehensive
collections of British and European paintings. All the major schools from
the 13th to the 20th century are represented, but the Italians get the lion’s
share of wall space, with works by artists such as Botticelli, Leonardo da
Vinci, and Raphael. The French Impressionist and post-Impressionist
works by Cézanne, Degas, Manet, Monet, Seurat, and van Gogh are splen-
did. And because you’re on English soil, check out at least a few of Turner’s
stunning seascapes, Constable’s landscapes, and Reynolds’ society por-
traits. And you won’t want to miss the Rembrandts. Budget at least two
hours to enjoy the gallery. The second floor has a good restaurant for
lunch, tea, or snacks.
Use the free computer information center to make the most of your time
at the gallery. The center allows you to design a tour based on your pref-
erences (a maximum of 10 paintings from the 2,200 entries) and prints out
a customized tour map. You can also rent a portable audio tour guide for
£3 ($5.55). Every painting has a reference number. Punch in the appropri-
ate number to hear information about any work that interests you.

wheelchair accessible.
National Portrait Gallery
St. James’s
What do these people all have in common: Sir Walter Raleigh, Shakespeare
(wearing a gold earring), Queen Elizabeth I, the Brontë sisters, Winston
Churchill, Oscar Wilde, Noël Coward, Mick Jagger, and Princess Di? You
can find lifelike portraits of them, as well as nearly every other famous
English face, at the National Portrait Gallery. The portraits are arranged in
chronological order. The earliest portraits are in the Tudor Gallery; por-
traits from the 1960s to the 1980s are displayed in the Balcony Gallery.
Chapter 11: Discovering London’s Top Attractions 197

Plan on spending at least two hours, but getting sidetracked here is easy,
so you may want more time. On the top floor, the Portrait Restaurant &
Bar looks out over the rooftops of the West End.

Natural History Museum
South Kensington
Filled with magnificent specimens and exciting displays relating to natural
history, this museum houses the national collections of living and fossil
plants, animals, and minerals. The most popular attraction in this enor-
mous Victorian-era museum is the huge Dinosaurs exhibit, with 14 com-
plete skeletons, two creepy animatronic raptors, and a full-size, robotic T.
Rex guarding a fresh kill. Kids also love the bug-filled Creepy Crawlies.
The sparkling gems and crystals in the Mineral Gallery literally dazzle,
and in the Meteorite Pavilion, you can see fragments of rock that crashed
into the earth from the farthest reaches of the galaxy. The newest addition
is the intriguing new Darwin Centre, which showcases the private col-
lection of Charles Darwin, father of evolutionary theory, and houses the
museum’s huge collection of preserved specimens. The museum offers
enough to keep you occupied for at least two hours.
See map p. 186. Cromwell Road, SW7. % 020/7942-5000. Tube: South Kensington (the
Tube station is on the corner of Cromwell Road and Exhibition Road, at the corner of
the museum). Admission: Free. Open: Mon–Sat 10 a.m.–5:50 p.m., Sun 11 a.m.–5:50
p.m. Nearly all the galleries are flat or ramped for wheelchair users; call for instruc-
tions on entering the building.
Piccadilly Circus
Piccadilly Circus
Nearly everyone who visits London wants to see Piccadilly Circus, which
lies at the beginning of the West End. Piccadilly Circus, along with neigh-
boring Leicester Square, is London’s equivalent to New York’s Times
Square. Around the landmark statue of Eros, jostling crowds pack the pave-
ments and an international group of teens heads for the Pepsi Trocadero,
the area’s mega-entertainment center (see “Activities for teens,” later in
this chapter). Regent Street at the west side of the circus and Piccadilly at
the south end are major shopping streets (see Chapter 12). Piccadilly, tra-
ditionally the western road out of town, was named for the picadil, a ruf-
fled collar created by a 17th-century tailor named Robert Baker.

Science Museum
South Kensington
The Science Museum is a popular tourist attraction that showcases the
history and development of science, medicine, and technology. The state-
of-the-art, interactive displays tickle the brains of 7- to 12-year-olds, and
the Garden Galleries provide construction areas, sound-and-light shows,
and games for younger kids. The fascinating displays include the Apollo 10
space module, an 1813 steam locomotive, Fox Talbot’s first camera, and
Edison’s original phonograph. The Wellcome Wing, which opened in
summer 2000, is devoted to contemporary science and has an IMAX 3-D film
theater. Give yourself at least two hours, more if you’re going to see the film.
See map p. 186. Exhibition Road, London SW7. % 020/7942-4454. Tube: South
Kensington (a signposted exit in the Underground station goes directly to the
museum). Admission: Museum free; IMAX £7.50 ($14) adults, £6 ($11) seniors and
children 5–15. To book IMAX tickets in advance, call % 0870/870-4868. Open: Daily
10 a.m.–6 p.m.; closed Dec 24–26. All galleries are wheelchair accessible.
St. James’s Park and Green Park
St. James’s
Henry VIII acquired these two adjoining royal parks in the early 16th cen-
tury. St James’s Park, the prettier of the two, was landscaped in 1827 by John
Nash in a picturesque English style with an ornamental lake and prome-
nades. The Mall, the processional route between Buckingham Palace and
Whitehall and Horse Guards Parade, is the route used for major ceremonial
occasions. Prince Charles and his sons reside at St. James’s Palace, and the
late Queen Mum lived at Clarence House next door. The residences —
closed to visitors — are between the Mall and Pall Mall (pronounced Pell
Mell), a broad avenue running from Trafalgar Square to St. James’s Palace.
See map p. 186. Bounded by Piccadilly to the north, Regent Street to the east,
Birdcage Walk and Buckingham Palace Road to the south, and Grosvenor Place to
the west. % 020/7930-1793. Tube: Green Park (the Tube station is right at the north-
east corner of Green Park) or St. James’s Park (then a five-minute walk north on
Queen Anne’s Gate to Birdcage Walk, the southern perimeter of St. James’s Park).

Picture-perfect Queen Mum
The Royal Family portrait commissioned by the National Portrait Gallery to celebrate
the Queen Mother’s 100th birthday in 2000 (she died in 2002) is the newest royal addi-
tion to go on display in the National Portrait Gallery. Artist John Wonnacott painted
the canvas that portrays Queen Elizabeth, Prince Phillip, Prince Charles, and Princes
William and Harry in conversation with the Queen Mother in the White Drawing Room
in Buckingham Palace. Interestingly, Prince William — Charles’ firstborn and thus the
second in line to the throne — dominates the picture.

St. Paul’s Cathedral
The City
After the Great Fire of 1666 destroyed the city’s old cathedral, the great
architect Christopher Wren was called upon to design St. Paul’s, a huge
and harmonious Renaissance-leaning-toward-baroque building (see the
“St. Paul’s Cathedral” map on p. 201). During World War II, Nazi bombing
raids wiped out the surrounding area but spared the cathedral, so Wren’s
masterpiece, capped by the most-famous dome in London, rises majesti-
cally above a crowded sea of undistinguished office buildings. Grinling
Gibbons carved the exceptionally beautiful choir stalls, which are the only
impressive artwork inside.
Christopher Wren is buried in the crypt, and his epitaph, on the floor
below the dome, reads LECTOR, SI MONUMENTUM REQUIRIS, CIRCUMSPICE (“Reader,
if you seek his monument, look around you”). His companions in the crypt
include two of Britain’s famed national heroes: the duke of Wellington, who
defeated Napoleon at Waterloo, and Admiral Lord Nelson, who took down
the French at Trafalgar during the same war. But many people want to see
St. Paul’s simply because Lady Diana Spencer wed Prince Charles here in
what was billed as “the fairy-tale wedding of the century.”
You can climb up to the Whispering Gallery for a bit of acoustical fun or
gasp your way up to the very top for a breathtaking view of London. You
can see the entire cathedral in an hour or less.
St. Paul’s is now linked to the Tate Modern on the South Bank by the pedes-
trian-only Millennium Bridge, designed by Lord Norman Foster.

accessible by the service entrance near the South Transept; ring the bell for assistance.

Green with envy
Green Park is called Green Park because it’s the only royal park without any flower
beds. Why? A popular story has it that one day, as Charles II was walking through the
park with his entourage, he announced that he was going to pick a flower and give it
to the most beautiful lady present. This lady happened to be a milkmaid and not Queen
Catherine, his wife. The queen was livid and ordered that all flowers be removed from
the park (a horticultural version of “Off with their heads!”).

Tate Britain
Pimlico
The Tate Gallery took this name to distinguish it from its new counterpart,
Tate Modern, which opened in May 2000 and is devoted to International
Modernism. Tate Britain retains the older (pre-20th century) collections
of exclusively British art plus works by major British stars like David
Hockney and experimental works by Brits and foreigners living in Britain.
Among the masterpieces on display in a host of newly refurbished galleries
are dreamy works by the British pre-Raphaelites, the celestial visions of
William Blake, bawdy satirical works by William Hogarth, genteel portraits
by Sir Joshua Reynolds, pastoral landscapes by John Constable, and the
shimmering seascapes of J.M.W. Turner. The collection is hung themati-
cally rather than chronologically. Plan on spending at least two hours here.
The gallery has a restaurant and a cafe on the lower level.

See map p. 186. Millbank, Pimlico SW1. % 020/7887-8000. Tube: Pimlico (then a ten-
minute walk south on Vauxhall Bridge Road to the river and north on Millbank to the

Free; varying admission fees for special exhibits. Tours: Audio tours £3 ($5.55). Open:
Daily 10 a.m.–5:50 p.m. Most of the galleries are wheelchair accessible, but call first
for details on entry.
Tate Modern
South Bank
The former Bankside Power Station is the setting for the fabulous Tate
Modern, which opened in May 2000. Considered one of the three or four
top modern art museums in the world, it houses the Tate’s collection of
international 20th-century art, displaying major works by some of the most
influential artists of this century: Frances Bacon, Salvador Dalí, Marcel
Duchamp, Henri Matisse, Henry Moore, and Pablo Picasso among them. A
gallery for the 21st-century collection exhibits contemporary art. Fans of
contemporary art and architecture shouldn’t miss this new star on the
London art scene. Plan on spending at least two hours. The museum is
now linked to St. Paul’s Cathedral by the pedestrian-only Millennium
Bridge, designed by Lord Norman Foster.

Inter-Tate travel
From Millbank Pier, on the river just outside Tate Britain, a ferry service links the Tate
Britain and the Tate Modern. Vessels operated by Thames Clippers make the run
between Millbank Pier and Bankside Pier, with one additional stop at Waterloo Pier,
in case you want to take a spin on the British Airways London Eye or check out the new
Saatchi Gallery. A one-way fare costs £2.50 ($4.65) for adults, £1.25 ($2.30) for children;
if you have a Travelcard, you get one-third off the price. For more information, contact
Transport for London (% 020/7222-1234; www.tfl.gov.uk).

Tower of London
The City
The Tower of London offers enough to keep you captivated for a good
three to four hours, but make sure that you save time for the Crown
Jewels, which include the largest diamond in the world (the 530-carat Star
of Africa) and other breathtaking gems set into royal robes, swords,
scepters, and crowns.
The Tower of London (see the “Tower of London” map on p. 205) is the
city’s best-known and oldest historic site. In 1066, William the Conqueror
built the tower, which served as his fortress and later as a prison, holding
famous captives, such as Sir Walter Raleigh and Princess Elizabeth I. Anne
Boleyn and Catherine Howard (two of the eight wives of Henry VIII), the
nine-day queen Lady Jane Grey, and Sir Thomas More were among those
unlucky souls who got their heads chopped off on Tower Green.
According to Shakespeare, the two little princes (the sons of Edward IV)
were murdered in the Bloody Tower by henchmen of Richard III — but the
story is controversial among modern historians.
You can attend the nightly Ceremony of the Keys, the ceremonial locking-
up of the Tower by the Yeoman Warders. For free tickets, write to the
Ceremony of the Keys, Queen’s House, HM Tower of London, London EC3N
4AB, and request a specific date, but also list three alternate dates. At least
six weeks’ notice is required. You must enclose an International Reply
Coupon and a self-addressed stamped envelope (British stamps only), or
two International Reply Coupons with all requests and list the names and
addresses for all visitors. If you have a ticket, a Yeoman Warder will admit
you at 9:35 p.m.
Huge black ravens hop around the grounds of the Tower of London. An old
legend says that the British Commonwealth will end when the ravens leave
the tower. Their wings have been clipped as a precaution.

That’s the way the bridge bounces
Lord Norman Foster’s $28-million Millennium Bridge linking Tate Modern to St. Paul’s
got off to a very wobbly start on its opening day, June 10, 2000. This much publicized,
highly visible, high-tech pedestrian span had one slight problem: It swayed and
bounced so much that people couldn’t walk on it. Seems that the “untraditional” sus-
pension system of aluminum and stainless steel wasn’t doing in real life what it had
done on paper. The bridge had to be closed immediately to determine whether major
repairs were needed. When Foster’s bridge reopened, the same problem occurred,
and it was closed for a second time. In fall 2001, however, the bridge was deemed safe
and opened to the public.

In the bad old days, important prisoners often arrived at the tower 
by boat. You can, too. Catamaran Cruisers (% 020/7925-2215; www.
catamarancruisers.co.uk) provides daily ferry service between
Embankment Pier (Tube: Embankment) and Tower Pier. A one-way ticket
for the 30-minute trip is £5.50 ($10) adults and £2.75 ($5.10) children under
16. City Cruises (% 020/7740-0400; www.citycruises.com) makes the
journey to the Tower of London from Wesminster Pier approximately
every 40 minutes from 10:10 a.m. to 5:50 p.m. for £5.60 ($10).

is available, but many of the historic buildings can’t accommodate wheelchairs.
Trafalgar Square
St. James’s
Until very recently, Trafalgar Square was an island in the midst of a roaringly
busy traffic interchange surrounded by historic buildings, such as St. Martin-
in-the-Fields church and the National Gallery. Then, after a major urban
redesign, it reopened in 2003 with one side attached to the steps of the
National Gallery, so visitors can easily get to the square without crossing any
streets at all. Besides being a major tourist attraction, Trafalgar Square is the
site of many large gatherings, such as political demonstrations and holiday
celebrations. The square honors military hero Horatio Viscount Nelson
(1758–1805), who lost his life at the 1805 Battle of Trafalgar against the French.
Nelson’s Column, with fountains and four bronze lions at its base, rises 145
feet above the square. At the top, a 14-foot-high statue of Nelson (5'4" tall in
real life) looks commandingly toward Admiralty Arch, passed through by
state and royal processions between Buckingham Palace and St. Paul’s
Cathedral. You don’t need more than a few minutes to take in the square.
The neoclassical church on the northeast corner of Trafalgar Square was
the precursor for dozens of similar-looking churches throughout colonial
New England. Designed by James Gibbs, a disciple of Christopher Wren,
St. Martin-in-the-Fields (see the map on p. 186; % 020/7930-0089) was
completed in 1726; the 185-foot spire was added about 100 years later. The
Academy of St. Martin-in-the-Fields, a famous music ensemble, frequently
performs here. Lunchtime concerts are held on Monday, Tuesday, and
Friday at 1 p.m., and evening concerts are held Thursday through Saturday
at 7:30 p.m. Concert tickets cost £6 to £15 ($11–$28). For reservations by
credit card, call % 020/7839-8362. The church is open Monday through
Saturday 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. and Sunday noon to 6 p.m.; admission is free.

Café-in-the-Crypt (% 020/7839-4342), one of the West End’s most pleas-
ant restaurants, is in the crypt of St. Martin-in-the-Fields (see Chapter 10
for the restaurant review). The busy crypt also contains the London Brass
Rubbing Centre (% 020/7437-6023), which provides paper, metallic
waxes, and instructions on how to rub your own replica of historic
brasses. Prices range from £3 to £15 ($5.55–$28). This activity is a great
diversion for kids 10 and up. The center is open Monday through Saturday
10 a.m. to 6 p.m. and Sunday noon to 6 p.m.
See map p. 186. Bounded on the north by Trafalgar, on the west by Cockspur Street,
and on the east by Whitehall. Tube: Charing Cross (the Underground station has an
exit to the square).

Victoria & Albert Museum
South Kensington
The Victoria & Albert (known as the V&A) is the national museum of art
and design. In the 145 galleries, filled with fine and decorative arts from
around the world, you find superbly decorated period rooms, a fashion
collection spanning 400 years of European designs, Raphael’s designs for
tapestries in the Sistine Chapel, the Silver Galleries, and the largest assem-
blages of Renaissance sculpture outside Italy and of Indian art outside
India. The Canon Photography Gallery shows works by celebrated pho-
tographers. In November 2001, the museum opened its spectacular new
British Galleries. Allow at least two hours just to cover the basics.
See map p. 186. Cromwell Road, SW7. % 020/7942-2000. Tube: South Kensington (the
museum is across from the Underground station). Admission: Free. Open: Thurs–Tues
10 a.m.–5:45 p.m., Wed 10 a.m.–10 p.m.; closed Dec 24–26. The museum is wheel-
chair accessible (only about five percent of the exhibits include steps).
Westminster Abbey
Westminster
The Gothic and grand Westminster Abbey is one of London’s most impor-
tant historic sites. (See the “Westminster Abbey” map on p. 207.) The pres-
ent abbey dates mostly from the 13th and 14th centuries, but a church has
been on this site for more than a thousand years. Since 1066, when William
the Conqueror became the first English monarch to be crowned here,
every successive British sovereign except for two (Edward V and Edward
VIII) has sat on the Coronation Chair to receive the crown and scepter. In
the Royal Chapels, you can see the chapel of Henry VII, with its delicate
fan vaulting, and the tomb of Queen Elizabeth I, who was buried in the
same vault as her Catholic half-sister, Mary I, and not far from her rival,
Mary Queen of Scots. In Poets’ Corner, some of England’s greatest writers
(including Chaucer, Dickens, and Thomas Hardy) are interred or memori-
alized. Other points of interest include the College Garden, cloisters, chap-
ter house, and the Undercroft Museum, which contains the Pyx Chamber
with its display of church plate, the silver owned by the church. In
September 1997, the abbey served as the site of Princess Diana’s funeral,
and in 2002, the funeral service for the Queen Mother was held there. The
abbey is within walking distance of the Houses of Parliament.
See map p. 186. Broad Sanctuary, SW1. % 020/7222-7110. Tube: Westminster (then
a three-minute walk west following Parliament Square to Broad Sanctuary). Bus:
The 77A going south along The Strand, Whitehall, and Millbank stops near the Houses
of Parliament, near the Abbey. Admission: £8 ($15) adults; £6 ($11) seniors, students,
and children 11–16; £18 ($33) families (two adults and two children). Guided tours:
Led by an Abbey Verger £4 ($7.40) (call for times); tickets for tours at Enquiry Desk in
the Abbey; audio tours £3 ($5.55). Open: Cathedral Mon–Fri 9 a.m.–3:45 p.m., Sat 9
a.m.–1:45 p.m., no sightseeing on Sun (services only); College Garden Apr–Sept 10
a.m.–6 p.m., Oct–Mar 10 a.m.–4 p.m. You can use ramped wheelchair access through
the Cloisters; ring the bell for assistance.

Oscar Wilde’s window
In 1995, 100 years after Oscar Wilde was tried for “gross indecency” and sentenced
to two years hard labor in Reading Gaol, the Church of England finally recognized his
immortal genius with a memorial window at Westminster Abbey. But because his name
is nowhere to be seen in the abbey, the blue window with its abstract design is the kind
of dubious honor that would no doubt provoke a witty quip from the great playwright.
Maybe something like, “Clear glass wasn’t good enough for me; it had to be stained.”

Finding More Cool Things to See and Do
If you think you’ve done London because you’ve marveled at Westminster
Abbey, seen where the queen lives, wandered through St. Paul’s Cathedral,
toured the Tower of London, and feasted your eyes on the masterpieces
in the British Museum, think again. London is teeming with more sight-
seeing possibilities: glorious gardens, magnificent mansions, singular
museums, ancient corners, historic churches, and many themed attrac-
tions that fill you in on the history and flavor of majestic London Town.
In the following sections, I highlight a few more of the many activities
that may tickle your fancy. For locations, see the “More London Sights”
map on p. 210.
In the following sections, I also cover four major attractions just outside
Central London and easily accessible by Tube or train — Hampstead
Heath, Hampton Court Palace, Royal Botanic Gardens, and Windsor
Castle. You can spend the better part of a day visiting any one of these
sights — all trips well worth your time — before returning to Central
London in time for a play or concert in the evening.
The following sights are fully or partially wheelchair accessible; visitors
with disabilities should call the attraction to find out about special
entrances, ramps, and elevator locations:
 Bank of England Museum
 British Library Exhibition Galleries
 Chelsea Physic Garden
 Courtauld Gallery
 Design Museum
 Hampton Court
 Imperial War Museum
 London Aquarium
 London Dungeon
 London Planetarium
 London Transport Museum
 Museum of Childhood
 Museum of London
 Regent’s Park

 Royal Academy of Arts

 Tower Bridge Experience
 Wallace Collection
Sights for history buffs
You can’t escape history in London. The past is woven into the very fabric
of the city, and it’s why many visitors want to come here. The “history”
contained in the sights in this section is as old as Rome, as new as the cur-
rent prime minister, and as dramatic as the events of World War II.
Cabinet War Rooms
Westminster
You can almost hear the air-raid sirens. In this 21-room underground
bunker, Prime Minister Winston Churchill and his War Cabinet planned out
the military campaigns of World War II. The site has been meticulously pre-
served, right down to the nightshirt and cigar waiting by Churchill’s bed.
Give yourself an hour to explore the site.
See map p. 210. Clive Steps, King Charles Street, SW1. % 020/7930-6961. Tube:
Westminster (then a ten-minute walk west, staying on the north side of the street, to
Parliament Street; turn right to reach King Charles Street). Admission: £10 ($19) adults,
£8 ($15) seniors and students, free for children under 16; a free self-guided audio tour
comes with your ticket. Open: Apr–Sept 9:30 a.m.–6 p.m., Oct–Mar 10 a.m.–6 p.m.
(last admission 5:15 p.m.).
Imperial War Museum
Lambeth
The former insane asylum known as Bedlam is now devoted to the insan-
ity of war. You can see a wide range of weapons and equipment, including
a Battle of Britain Spitfire, a German one-man submarine, a Mark V tank,
and a rifle once carried by Lawrence of Arabia. Other exhibits include
coded messages, forged documents, espionage equipment from World War
I to the present, and multimedia presentations about the Blitz and trench
warfare. The Holocaust Gallery documents one of history’s darkest
episodes through film, photos, and artifacts, many shown for the first time.
Enough history is on display to keep you occupied for a couple of hours.
See map p. 210. Lambeth Road, SE1. % 020/7416-5320. Tube: Lambeth North (then a
ten-minute walk south on Kennington, south of Westminster Bridge Road, and east
on Lambeth Road). Admission: Free. Open: Daily 10 a.m.–6 p.m. Closed Dec 24–26.

Museum of London
The City
The Museum of London is the most comprehensive city museum anywhere
in the world. Located in the original square-mile Londinium of the Romans
and overlooking the city’s Roman and medieval walls, the museum includes
archaeological finds; paintings and prints; social, industrial, and historical
artifacts; and costumes, maps, and models to recount the city’s history from
prehistoric times to today. Give yourself at least an hour to skim through
the engaging collections; although, spending more time than that is easy.
See map p. 210. 150 London Wall (in the Barbican district near St. Paul’s Cathedral),
EC2. % 0870/444-3853. Tube: St. Paul’s (then a ten-minute walk north on St. Martin
Le Grand and Aldersgate). Admission: Free. Open: Mon–Sat 10 a.m.–5:50 p.m., Sun
noon–5:50 p.m. Closed Dec 24–26 and Jan 1.
10 Downing Street
St. James’s
The prime minister’s residence is a place on many visitors’ “must-see”
lists, so I’m sorry to tell you that there’s nothing to see except a heavily
guarded gate. By peering through the gate, you can get a glimpse, on the
right side, of No. 10, the official residence of the British PM since 1732. The
sizeable Blair family (Tony, Cherie, and four kids) found No. 10 too small
and moved into No. 11, where the Chancellor of the Exchequer usually
resides. No. 12 serves as the office of the chief government whip, respon-
sible for maintaining discipline and cooperation in the vociferous House of
Commons. These three small brick terrace houses, built on a cul-de-sac in
1680, stand in sharp contrast to the enormous 19th-century offices lining
Whitehall, the government quarter around Downing Street.
See map p. 210. 10 Downing St., SW1. Tube: Westminster (then a five-minute walk
north on Parliament Street and Whitehall).
Attractions for art lovers
In addition to visiting the great art museums described in “London’s Top
Sights,” earlier in this chapter, you may want to check out some of the
city’s smaller galleries.
Royal Academy of Arts
St. James’s
Housed in 18th-century Burlington House, the site of Britain’s first art
school, the Royal Academy presents major exhibits throughout the year
and mounts a renowned (and usually jam-packed) Summer Exhibition of
juried works from around the United Kingdom. Give yourself about an hour.
See map p. 210. Burlington House, Piccadilly, W1. % 020/7300-8000. www.royal
academy.org.uk. Tube: Piccadilly Circus (then a five-minute walk down Piccadilly; the
Academy is on the north side of the street just before the Burlington Arcade). Admission:
Varies according to exhibit but usually £10 ($19) adults, £8 ($15) seniors, £2.50 ($4.65) chil-
dren. Open: Sat–Thurs 10 a.m.–6 p.m. (last admission 5:30 p.m.), Fri 10 a.m.–8:30 p.m.
Part IV: Exploring London 
212

Saatchi Gallery
South Bank
Ex-adman Charles Saatchi has amassed one of the largest independent 
collections of contemporary British and international art in the world. His
gallery shows pieces from the permanent collection, as well as changing
international exhibits. Regardless of what you think of the sometimes 
controversial works on display — many of them vapid, self-serving, and
silly — the gallery remains a showcase for the art trends of the second.
See map p. 211. County Hall, Southbank, SE1. % 020/7825-2363. www.saatchi-
gallery.co.uk. Tube: Westminster (then a five-minute walk across Westminster
Bridge to County Hall). Admission: £9 ($17) adults, £6.75 ($12) seniors and students.
Open: Sun–Thurs 10 a.m.–8 p.m., Fri–Sat 10 a.m.–10 p.m.
Somerset House
The Strand
The late Queen Mother once remarked how sad it was that the courtyard
at Somerset House had become an Inland Revenue car park. It was just the
spur that the long-running campaign needed to open up the 1,000-room
civil service palace, designed by Sir William Chambers (1724–1796), to the
public. The government moved its workers out and the Heritage Lottery
Fund coughed up the millions needed to restore the buildings, the court-
yard with its dancing fountains, and the river terrace that’s now the home
Chapter 11: Discovering London’s Top Attractions 213
Prime-time prime minister
Of course, London gossip swirls around 10 Downing Street, just as it does around
Buckingham Palace. In 1999, Cherie Blair, wife of poll-sensitive Prime Minister Tony
Blair and a high-powered lawyer specializing in employment law, announced that she
was pregnant with the couple’s fourth child and thought her husband should take
advantage of the 13-week unpaid paternity leave policy his Labour government had
incorporated into law. Mr. Blair, a seasoned spin-meister, was uncharacteristically
tongue-tied by his wife’s suggestion. In the end, he took only a week off when their
son, Leo, was born.
Gossip swirled again in July 2000, when the Blair’s 16-year-old son, Euan, was arrested
in Leicester Square for drunkenness. And again in 2001, when Cherie Blair outpolled
the queen as “Britain’s most powerful woman.” Cherie Blair is the first prime minister’s
wife to hold a full-time job and reputedly earns three times the $175,000 annual salary
of her prime minister husband. But Superwoman Cherie was forced to eat humble pie
in 2003 when it was discovered that she had participated in some rather shady real-
estate transactions, purchasing property on the advice of a convicted criminal. She
went so far as to issue a tearful public apology. After Tony Blair’s position on the Iraq
war cost his New Labour Party one-third of their seats in 2005, he announced that he
would not run for a fourth term.

of a great summer cafe. A heady mix of high culture and street entertain-
ment, the “new” Somerset House houses three noteworthy art collections.
Each gallery charges an admission fee of £5 ($9.25) for adults, £4 ($7.40)
for seniors; children under 18 enter free. The three galleries are all open
daily from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m.
The Courtauld Gallery (% 020/7848-2526) has been in Somerset House
since 1989. Impressionist and post-Impressionist paintings are still the
gallery’s main strength. Major works include Manet’s Bar at the Folies
Bergères; Monet’s Banks of the Seine at Argenteuil; Lady with Parasol by
Degas; La Loge by Renoir; Van Gogh’s Self-Portrait with Bandaged Ear; and
several Cézannes, including The Card Players. But you’ll find work by most
great names (many by Rubens), right up to modern greats Ben Nicholson,
Graham Sutherland, and Larry Rivers.
The Gilbert Collection (% 020/7420-9400), in the South Building, show-
cases the glittering gold, silver, and mosaics that were valued at £75 mil-
lion when Arthur Gilbert donated the 800-piece collection to the nation in
1996. Some objects came from Princess Diana’s old home, Althorp.
The last and perhaps most extraordinary of the treasures of Somerset
House are the Hermitage Rooms (% 020/7845-4630). This offshoot of the
State Hermitage Museum in St. Petersburg exhibits pieces from the Russian
Imperial collections in changing shows.
See map p. 210. Strand, WC2. % 020/7845-4600. www.somerset-house.org.uk.
Tube: Temple (then a five-minute walk north on Arundel Street and west on The
Strand). Admission: Somerset House free; separate admissions for the galleries.
Open: Courtyard 7:30 a.m.–11 p.m. (7 p.m. in winter); galleries daily 10 a.m.–6 p.m.
(last admittance 45 minutes to one hour earlier). Closed Jan 1 and Dec 24–26.
Wallace Collection
Marylebone
The palatial townhouse of the late Lady Wallace is the setting for a spec-
tacular collection of art, ornaments, and armaments. You can enjoy out-
standing French works by the likes of Watteau and Fragonard, as well as
masterpieces from the Dutch (Frans Hals and Rembrandt), English,
Spanish, and Italian schools. Decorative art from 18th-century France and
European and Asian weapons are also on display. Give yourself at least an
hour. The courtyard, with its new glass roof, is a pleasant spot for tea.
See map p. 210. Hertford House, Manchester Square, W1. % 020/7563-9500. Tube:
Baker Street (then a ten-minute walk south on Baker Street to the museum entrance
on the north side of Manchester Square). Admission: Free. Open: Mon–Sat 10 a.m.–
5 p.m., Sun noon–5 p.m.
Literary landmarks
Writers have been drawn to London for centuries and have left their lit-
erary imprints all over this vast metropolis. Listed in this section are
some of the unique places associated with writers who lived in London,
as well as one of the world’s great storehouses of literary treasures.
Part IV: Exploring London 
214

British Library Exhibition Centre
Marylebone
The venerable British Library moved to this new building in 1998 and displays
some of the world’s most famous books, maps, manuscripts, and documents
in a series of special galleries. This is where you can see a copy of the Magna
Carta, Shakespeare’s first folio, and handwritten manuscripts by authors such
as Jane Austen, Charlotte Brontë, and Thomas Hardy. Just as fascinating are
the audio recordings that let you hear the voices of Virginia Woolf and William
Butler Yeats among others reading from their own works. Give this sight at
least an hour; allow more time if you love literature or literary history.
See map p. 210. Euston Road, NW1. % 020/7412-7332. Tube: King’s Cross/St. Pancras
(then a five-minute walk west on Euston; the museum entrance is just beyond Midland
Road). Admission: Free. Tours: Mon, Wed, Fri 3 p.m., Sat 10:30 a.m. and 3 p.m., Sun
11:30 a.m. and 3 p.m.; £6 ($11) adults, £4.50 ($8.35) seniors, students, and children.
Open: Mon and Wed–Fri 9:30 a.m.–6 p.m., Tues 9:30 a.m.–8 p.m., Sat 9:30 a.m.–5 p.m.,
Sun 11 a.m.–5 p.m.
Carlyle’s House
Chelsea
Thomas Carlyle (author of The French Revolution and many other rarely
read books) and his witty wife, Jane (a noted letter writer), lived in this
pretty 1708 Queen Anne terrace house from 1834 to 1881. Furnished as it
was during their residence, the house is an accurate representation of
middle-class Victorian domestic life. Carlyle’s “soundproof” study in the
skylit attic is filled with memorabilia — his books, a letter from Benjamin
Disraeli, personal effects, a writing chair, and even his death mask. You
can browse through the house in about a half-hour.
See map p. 210. 24 Cheyne Row, SW3. % 020/7352-7087. Tube: Sloane Square (then
a 20-minute walk south on Lower Sloane Street and Hospital Road to Cheyne Walk
and north on Cheyne Row; or from Sloane Square, take bus 11, 19, or 22). Admission:
£3.70 ($6.85) adults, £1.80 ($3.35) children. Open: Apr–Oct Wed–Fri 2–5 p.m., Sat–Sun
11 a.m.–5 p.m.
Dickens’s House Museum
Bloomsbury
Charles Dickens lived in many places, but he and his family called this
Bloomsbury house home from 1837 to 1839. Here, the great author penned
The Pickwick Papers, Oliver Twist, and Nicholas Nickleby, the poignant and
famous portrayals of Victorian England. The museum contains the world’s
most comprehensive Dickens library, portraits, illustrations, and rooms
furnished exactly as they were in Dickens’s time. You can see everything
in a half-hour, but allow more time if you’re a Dickens fanatic.
See map p. 210. 48 Doughty St., WC1. % 020/7405-2127. Tube: Russell Square (then
a ten-minute walk up Guilford Street and turn right on Doughty Street; the museum
is on the east side of the street). Admission: £5 ($9.25) adults, £4 ($7.40) seniors, £3
($5.55) children. Open: Mon–Sat 10 a.m.–5 p.m.
Chapter 11: Discovering London’s Top Attractions 215

Dr. Johnson’s House
Holborn
Hidden away in a tiny square north of Fleet Street is the Queen Anne house
where Dr. Samuel Johnson, best known as the lexicographer who compiled
one of the first dictionaries of the English language, lived (quite humbly)
from 1748 to 1759. A copy of the original dictionary is on display, along
with Johnson memorabilia. The restored 17th-century house is close to Ye
Olde Cheshire Cheese pub (see Chapter 10), a favorite haunt of the good
doctor, who was celebrated as a storyteller of the first order. You can see
everything on view here in less than half an hour.
See map p. 210. 17 Gough Square, EC4. % 020/7353-3745. Tube: Temple (then a ten-
minute walk north on Arundel Street to Fleet Street and east on Fleet Street to
Dunstan’s Court; Gough Square is to one side of Dunstan’s Court). Admission: 
£4 ($7.40) adults, £3 ($5.55) seniors and students. Open: May–Sept Mon–Sat 
11 a.m.–5:30 p.m., Oct–Apr Mon–Sat 11 a.m.–5 p.m.
All manner of intriguing museums
London’s museums are surprisingly varied in their scope and substance.
In addition to all the great art museums that you can read about in the
section “Attractions for art lovers,” earlier in this chapter, the city has
museums dedicated to theater, architecture, design, medicine, and money.
Bank of England Museum
The City
Devoted capitalists enjoy the Bank of England Museum, housed in the
enormous Bank of England building. The museum chronicles changes in
the banking industry since the Bank of England’s beginnings in 1694, when
funds were needed to finance the war against France’s Louis XIV. On display
are documents from famous customers (including George Washington), gold

Benjamin Franklin’s London abode
A signer of the Declaration of Independence, Benjamin Franklin (1706–1790) was as
American as they come. As a writer, he coined such famous aphorisms as “A penny
saved is a penny earned.” Franklin was also an inventor, and St. Paul’s Cathedral in
London was the first public building in the world to get one of his new lightning rods.
Franklin the statesman resided in London between 1757 and 1775, and his “genteel
lodgings,” on Craven Street near Charing Cross Station, served as the first de facto
American embassy after Independence. The Benjamin Franklin House (see the map
on p. 210; 36 Craven St., WC2N; % 020/7930-9121), the only Franklin house remaining
in the world today, is scheduled to open to the public in early 2006. Opening times and
admissions weren’t available at press time, but you can find more information at
www.rsa.org.uk/franklin.

bullion, bank notes (forged and real), and coins. Interactive video displays
present information about today’s high-tech world of finance and a recon-
structed 18th-century Banking Hall. You can see it all in less than an hour.
See map p. 210. Bartholomew Lane, EC2. % 020/7601-5545. Tube: Bank (then a five-
minute walk east on Threadneedle Street; turn left on Bartholomew’s Lane for the
museum entrance). Admission: Free. Open: Mon–Fri 10 a.m.–5 p.m.
Design Museum
South Bank
If you’re a design enthusiast — or want to see how commercial design
affects our everyday lives — check out this museum in the hot “new”
Butler’s Wharf area east of Tower Bridge. You can find classical, kitsch,
modern, surreal, and innovative — from Corbusier chairs to the Coke
bottle — all chronicled here. Plus, you get to see some great river views.
Plan to spend at least an hour.
See map p. 210. Butlers Wharf, Shad Thames, SE1. % 020/7403-6933. Tube: Tower Hill
(then a ten-minute walk across Tower Bridge to Butler’s Wharf east of the bridge on
the South Bank; or London Bridge, then a ten-minute walk east along The Queen’s
Walk beside the Thames). Admission: £6 ($11) adults, £4 ($7.40) seniors and children,
£16 ($30) families (two adults and two children). Open: Daily 10 a.m.–5:45 p.m.
Old Operating Theatre & Herb Garret
South Bank
The Old Operating Theatre isn’t for the faint of heart. The roof garret of
the church of St. Thomas, once attached to St. Thomas’s Hospital, con-
tains Britain’s oldest operating theater (from 1822), where students could
witness surgical procedures on poor (literally and figuratively) patients.
You’ll shudder over the collection of mid-19th-century “state-of-the-art”
medical instruments, including amputation saws. The theater was in use
long before the advent of anesthesia in 1846. Prior to that time, if a patient
had a limb amputated, only a blindfold and a bottle of liquor were pro-
vided (and you thought your HMO was bad). The herb garret was used for
the storage and curing of medicinal herbs.
See map p. 210. 9A St. Thomas St., SE1. % 020/7955-4791. Tube: London Bridge (then
a five-minute walk east on St. Thomas Street). Admission: £4.75 ($8.80) adults, 
£3.75 ($6.95) seniors, £2.75 ($5.10) children. Open: Daily 10:30 a.m.–5 p.m.; closed 
Dec 15–Jan 5.
Sir John Soane’s Museum
Holborn
The house of Sir John Soane (1753–1837), architect of the Bank of England,
is an eccentric cache of ancient sculpture, artifacts, and art mixed in with
odd architectural perspectives, fool-the-eye mirrors, flying arches, and
domes. This captivating Holborn attraction is rarely crowded, which
makes spending an hour even more of a treat. The oldest piece in the
Chapter 11: Discovering London’s Top Attractions 217

house is the 3,300-year-old sarcophagus of Pharaoh Seti I. Top prize in the
picture gallery goes to William Hogarth’s satirical and sometimes bawdy
series from The Rake’s Progress. On the first Tuesday of every month, the
house is open in the evening and illuminated by candlelight.
See map p. 210. 13 Lincoln’s Inn Fields, WC2. % 020/7405-2107. Tube: Holborn (then
a five-minute walk south on Kingsway to Lincoln’s Inn Fields; the museum entrance
is on the north side of the street). Admission: Free. Guided tours (Sat 2:30 p.m.): 
£3 ($5.55). Open: Tues–Sat 10 a.m.–5 p.m., first Tues of every month 6–9 p.m.
Theatre Museum
Covent Garden
The National Collections of the Performing Arts are housed at this branch
of the Victoria & Albert Museum. Oddly enough, it’s kind of dull for a
museum devoted to performing arts, but you can spend a half-hour or so
checking out the collections related to British theater, ballet, opera, music-
hall pantomime, puppets, circus, and rock and pop music (both past and
present). Kids love the daily stage make-up demonstrations. The costume
workshops use costumes from the Royal Shakespeare Company and the
Royal National Theatre.
See map p. 210. Russell Street, WC2. % 020/7945-4700. Tube: Covent Garden (then
a three-minute walk south to Russell Street on the east side of Covent Garden Piazza).
Admission: Free. Open: Tues–Sun 10 a.m.–6 p.m.
Activities for teens
If you have teens in tow, you may wonder where to take them so that
they won’t feel as though their interests are being completely ignored.
The choices in this section — all places where teens hang out — provide
a few screams, a wonderland of games, and some really loud music.
London Dungeon
South Bank
Don’t bring young children here unless you want to pay for therapy, 
but teens seem to love the grisly re-creations of medieval torture and 
executions presented at this house of horrors. You find a scream (literally)
around every corner. Amid the tolling bells, dripping water, and caged rats,
you can face Jack the Ripper or witness a simulated burning at the stake.
It’s ghoulishly expensive, but some think it’s more fun than Madame
Tussaud’s.
See map p. 210. 28–34 Tooley St., SE1. % 020/7403-7221. www.thedungeons.com.
Tube: London Bridge (the exhibit is across from the station). Admission: £15 ($28)
adults, £13 ($24) students, £12 ($22) seniors and children under 15; children 14 and

Pepsi Trocadero
Piccadilly Circus
This “total entertainment complex” is right on Piccadilly Circus. The lead
attraction is Segaworld, which offers various rides, including Max Drop,
the world’s first indoor freefall ride (don’t eat for at least an hour before),
and 400 ear-splitting, eye-popping video games and simulators. Theme
restaurants include the ersatz Rainforest Café (which doesn’t pretend its
proceeds go to support the rain forests and has what may be the worst
food in London) and the 1950s-style Ed’s Easy Diner. Plan to spend some
time, because the Pepsi Trocadero is designed and packaged in such a way
that after you’re in, finding your way out again seems to take forever.
See map p. 210. Piccadilly Circus. % 09068/881100. Tube: Piccadilly Circus (then a
one-minute walk to the northeast side). Admission: Segaworld is free, but games and
rides cost £1–£3 (£1.85–$5.55). Open: Sun–Thurs 10 a.m.–midnight, Fri–Sat 10 a.m.–1 a.m.
Places that please kids
The little(r) ones probably won’t have much interest in London’s art
museums and historic buildings. But the city offers all kinds of diver-
sions for pre-teens, including a museum crammed with antique toys and
attractions related to the sea, the stars, and the subway (Tube).
London Aquarium
South Bank
London’s subterranean aquarium, located right beside the British Airways
London Eye, may be a bit disappointing if you’ve been to any of the great
aquariums in the United States. Nevertheless, children enjoy observing its
more than 350 species of fish and aquatic invertebrates, including sharks,
graceful stingrays, man-eating piranhas, and sea scorpions. Exhibits, a
couple with floor-to-ceiling tanks, re-create marine habitats from around
the world. Plan on spending at least an hour here — more if you can’t pull
the kids away.
See map p. 210. Bridge Road (beside Westminster Bridge), SE1. % 020/7967-8000.
Tube: Waterloo (then a five-minute walk west along the river). Admission: £9.75 ($18)
adults, £7.50 ($14) seniors, £6.25 ($12) children, £29 ($54) families (two adults and two
children). Open: Daily 10 a.m.–6 p.m. (last admission 5 p.m.). Closed Dec 25.
London Planetarium
Marylebone
Partnered with Madame Tussaud’s wax museum (see the listing earlier in
this chapter), the planetarium takes you on a journey to very different
stars from the ones cast in wax next door. The planetarium offers many
kid-friendly hands-on exhibits (including one that lets you see what shape
or weight you’d be on other planets). You can also hear Stephen Hawking
talk about mysterious black holes. You get to visit the major landmarks of
Chapter 11: Discovering London’s Top Attractions 219

the solar system and witness spectacular cosmic activity, all from the com-
fort of the planetarium’s auditorium. Give this sight at least an hour.
See map p. 210. Marylebone Road, NW1. % 0870/400-3000. Tube: Baker Street (then
a one-minute walk east on Marylebone Road). Admission: £8.75 ($16) adults, £5.75
($11) children under 16. Children under 5 not admitted. Combination ticket for
Planetarium and Madame Tussaud’s: £22 ($41) adults, £19 ($35) seniors, £18 ($33) chil-
dren under 16. Open: Daily 10 a.m.–5:30 p.m. Half-hour shows begin at 10 a.m. or 10:30
a.m., depending on season, and run until closing.
London Transport Museum
Covent Garden
Housed in a splendid Victorian building (once the Flower Market at Covent
Garden), this museum chronicles the development of the city’s famous
Underground and double-decker red bus system. A fabulous collection of
historic vehicles, including an 1829 omnibus, a horse-drawn bus, and
London’s first trolley bus, are on display. Several KidZones offer interactive
exhibits that enable younger visitors to operate the controls of a Tube
train, get their tickets punched, and play with touch-screen technology.
After two hours, you may have to drag them away.
See map p. 210. The Piazza, WC2. % 020/7379-6344. Tube: Covent Garden (then a
two-minute walk west to the Piazza; the museum is in the southeast corner).
Admission: £5.95 ($11) adults, £4.50 ($8.35) seniors, free for children under 16. Open:
Sat–Thurs 10 a.m.–6 p.m., Fri 11 a.m.–6 p.m. (last admission at 5:15 p.m.).
Museum of Childhood
Bethnal Green
A branch of the Victoria & Albert Museum, this museum specializes in 
toys from the past and present. You can find a staggering collection of
dolls, many with elaborate period costumes, and fully furnished doll-
houses ranging from simple cottages to miniature mansions. Optical toys,
marionettes, puppets, tin soldiers, war toys, toy trains and aircraft, and a
display of clothing and furniture relating to the social history of childhood
make this museum an enchanting place to invest a couple of hours. Oh,
how times — and toys — have changed.
See map p. 210. Cambridge Heath Road, E2. % 020/8980-2415. Tube: Bethnal Green
(then a five-minute walk north on Cambridge Heath Road to the museum entrance
on the east side of the street). Admission: Free. Open: Sat–Thurs 10 a.m.–5:50 p.m.
To see or not to see: Shakespeare sights
If you don’t have time to visit Stratford-upon-Avon (see Chapter 14),
where the great poet and dramatist William Shakespeare was born and
died, you can visit two Shakespeare-associated sights on London’s 
South Bank.
Part IV: Exploring London 
220

Shakespeare’s Globe Theatre & Exhibition
South Bank
At this full-size replica of Shakespeare’s Globe Theatre, just east of its orig-
inal site, you can take guided tours through the theater and its workshops.
You can find out about the days of Shakespeare and Elizabethan theater:
what audiences were like, the rivalry among the theaters, the cruel bear-
baiting shows, and the notorious Southwark Stews (a nearby area where
prostitutes plied their trade). Watching a Shakespeare play from one of the
benches in this roofless “wooden O” is a memorable experience, though
the hard benches can be rough on the backside. See Chapter 15 for details
on obtaining tickets for one of the performances, presented May through
September.
If you plan to see a Shakespeare play at the Globe, you can have a snack,
tea, or a full meal in the theater itself. You don’t need to make reservations
at The Globe Café; it’s open daily May through September 10 a.m. to 11 p.m.
and October through April 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. Make reservations ahead for
lunch or dinner at The Globe Restaurant (% 020/7928-9444), open daily
noon to 2:30 p.m. and 6 to 11 p.m.
See map p. 210. New Globe Walk (just west of Southwark Bridge), SE1. % 020/
7902-1500. Tube: Mansion House (then a ten-minute walk across Southwark Bridge;
the theater is visible on the west side along the river). Tours: £8 ($15) adults, £6.50
($12) seniors and students, £5.50 ($10) children, £24 ($44) family. Open: Oct–Apr daily
10 a.m.–5 p.m., May–Sept (performance season) daily 9 a.m.–noon.
Southwark Cathedral
South Bank
Chaucer and Shakespeare both worshiped at Southwark Cathedral.
London’s second-oldest church after Westminster Abbey, Southwark (pro-
nounced Suth-ick) Cathedral is in what was London’s first theater district
(as well as a church-sanctioned center of prostitution). Although the cathe-
dral was partially rebuilt in 1890, a great deal of history is associated with
this 15th-century church. In under 30 minutes, you can see the entire site,
including the Shakespeare memorial window and a 13th-century wooden
effigy of a knight. Lunchtime concerts are regularly given on Monday and
Tuesday; call for exact times and schedules.
See map p. 210. Montague Close (just west of London Bridge), SE1. % 020/7367-6700.
Tube: London Bridge (then a five-minute walk across London Bridge Road to
Cathedral Street). Admission: Free, but a £2 ($3.70) donation is suggested. Open:
Mon–Fri 7:30 a.m.–6 p.m., Sat–Sun 8:30 a.m.–6 p.m.
Ships ahoy! Nautical London
The river Thames, London’s watery artery to the English Channel, is full
of all kinds of watercraft. This section details two intriguing ships that
you can visit. I tell you about touring the Thames by boat in the “Seeing
London by Guided Tour” section, later in this chapter.
Chapter 11: Discovering London’s Top Attractions 221

Golden Hinde
South Bank
A full-scale reconstruction of Sir Francis Drake’s 16th-century flagship,
complete with a crew dressed in Tudor costumes, the Golden Hinde was
built in Devon but launched in San Francisco in 1973 to commemorate
Drake’s claiming of California for Queen Elizabeth I. Like the original, this
ship circumnavigated the globe, sailing more than 140,000 miles before
becoming a permanent floating museum in 1996. A self-guided tour of the
fully rigged ship, once the home to 20 officers and gentlemen and between
40 to 60 crew members, takes about a half-hour.
See map p. 210. St. Mary Overie Dock, Cathedral Street (west of London Bridge), 
SE1. % 08700/118-700. Tube: London Bridge (then a five-minute walk west on Bedale
and Cathedral streets). Admission: £3.50 ($6.50) adults, £3 ($5.55) seniors, £2.50 ($4.65)
children, £15 ($28) families (two adults and two children). Open: Daily, but call 
for times.
H.M.S. Belfast
South Bank
The Belfast, a huge Royal Navy cruiser built in 1938 and used in World War
II, is now moored in the Thames near London Bridge, opposite the Tower
of London. Tours of this floating 10,500-ton museum allow visitors to see
all seven decks. On-ship exhibits are devoted to the history of the ship and
the Royal Navy. You and your kids can witness a re-created surface battle.
Plan to spend about 90 minutes.
See map p. 210. Morgan’s Lane, Tooley Street (between Tower Bridge and London
Bridge), SE1. % 020/7940-6300. Tube: London Bridge (then a ten-minute walk north
across Tooley Street and north on Hays Lane toward the entrance on the river).
Admission: £7 ($13) adults, £5 ($9.25) seniors and students, free for children under 16.
Open: Mar–Oct daily 10 a.m.–6 p.m.; Nov–Feb daily 10 a.m.–5 p.m. (last admission 
45 minutes before closing).
Architectural highlights and stately homes
Stepping into one of London’s great mansions, you can see what life lived
on a grand scale was really like. The capital is also full of intriguing monu-
ments, including one called, simply, The Monument, and famous bridges,
such as Tower Bridge, which you can visit high above the Thames.
Apsley House
St. James’s
Once known as Number One London because it was the first house past
the tollgate into London, this magnificent neoclassical mansion, designed
by Robert Adam and built between 1771 and 1778, was the London resi-
dence of the first duke of Wellington. The last great London townhouse,
Apsley contains original collections that are mostly intact. After his phe-
nomenal military career, which included defeating Napoleon at Waterloo
Part IV: Exploring London 
222

in 1815, the duke was one of the most popular men in England. Apsley
House, with its sumptuous interiors and treasure trove of paintings, china,
swords, and military honors, reflects the first duke’s position as the most
powerful commander in Europe. A free audio guide explains it all on a self-
guided tour that lasts about an hour. The family is still in residence,
although you never see them.
See map p. 210. Hyde Park Corner, W1. % 020/7499-5676. Tube: Hyde Park Corner
(Exit 3 brings you up next to the house). Admission: £4.50 ($8.35) adults, £3 ($5.55) sen-
iors, free for children under 16. Open: Tues–Sun 11 a.m.–5 p.m. Closed Dec 24–26,
Jan 1, Good Friday, and May 1.
The Monument
The City
This 202-foot-high Doric column was designed by Sir Christopher Wren
and commemorates the Great Fire of 1662, which allegedly began in nearby
Pudding Lane and swept through London. The Monument is the tallest iso-
lated stone column in the world — you’ll know just how tall if you climb
the 311 steps to the viewing platform at the top.
See map p. 210. Monument Street (just north of London Bridge), EC3. % 020/
7626-2717. Tube: Monument (you get out right across the street). Admission: £2 ($3.70)
adults, £1 ($1.85) children. Open: Daily 10 a.m.–5:40 p.m.
Spencer House
St. James’s
The late Princess Diana is probably the most famous member of the
Spencer family, but she never lived in her family’s ancestral London home,
built for the first Earl Spencer in 1766. The house, one of London’s most
beautiful private palaces, hasn’t been a private residence since 1927.
Brilliantly restored and opened as a museum in 1990, its rooms are filled
with period furniture and art loans from Queen Elizabeth, the Tate Britain,
and the Victoria & Albert Museum. Guided tours (the only way to see the
place) take about an hour.
See map p. 210. 27 St. James’s Place, SW1. % 020/7499-8620. Tube: Green Park (then
a five-minute walk south on Queen’s Walk to St. James’s Place on your left).
Admission: £9 ($17) adults, £7 ($13) seniors and students. Children under 10 not admit-
ted. Open: Sun 10:30 a.m.–4:45 p.m. Closed Jan and Aug.
Tower Bridge Experience
South Bank
The “experience” lets you get inside one of the world’s most famous
bridges to find out why, how, and when it was built. Harry, a Victorian
bridge worker brought to life by animatronics, tells you the story of this
famous drawbridge with its pinnacled towers and how the mechanism for
raising the bridge for ship traffic actually works. You also meet the archi-
tect’s ghost and visit a miniature music hall. The experience takes about
Chapter 11: Discovering London’s Top Attractions 223

90 minutes. The spectacular views up and down the Thames from the
bridge’s glass-enclosed walkways double the value of this attraction.
See map p. 210. North Pier, Tower Bridge, SE1. % 020/7378-1928. Tube: Tower Hill
(then a ten-minute walk south to the north pier of Tower Bridge). Admission: £5.50
($10) adults, £4.25 ($7.85) seniors and students, £3 ($5.55) children 5–15. Open: Daily
Nov–Mar 9:30 a.m.–6 p.m., Apr–Oct 10 a.m.–6:30 p.m. (last admission 75 minutes
before closing). Closed Dec 25–26.
Parks and gardens
Part of London’s charm comes from its giant green parks, small neigh-
borhood squares, and special gardens. You never have to feel oppressed
by too much brick and concrete in this city. If the mood strikes, you may
want to visit one of the lovely spots in this section.
Chelsea Physic Garden
Chelsea
Hidden behind high brick walls, the Chelsea Physic Garden is the second-
oldest surviving botanical garden in England and one of London’s most
beautiful places. The garden, containing more than 7,000 exotic herbs,
shrubs, trees, and flowers, plus England’s earliest rock garden, was
founded in 1673 by the Worshipful Society of Apothecaries to develop
medicinal and commercial plant species. Cotton seeds from this garden
launched an industry in the new colony of Georgia. The garden is small
enough (31⁄2 acres) to wander through in an hour, but budget some more
time if you love plants.
See map p. 210. Swan Walk, 66 Royal Hospital Rd., SW3. % 020/7352-5646. Tube:
Sloane Square (then a 15-minute walk south on Lower Sloane Street and west to the
end of Royal Hospital Road). Bus: Southbound bus 11, 19, or 22 from Sloane Square.
Admission: £5 ($9.25) adults, £3 ($5.55) students and children 5–15. Open: Apr–Oct
Wed 2–5 p.m., Sun 2–6 p.m.; during the Chelsea Flower Show in May daily 2–5 p.m.

For fans of Princess Di
If you’re a true Princess Diana fan, note that she’s buried on a picturesque island on
the Oval Lake at Althorp, the Spencer family estate in Northamptonshire. The grounds
are open for a limited time each year from July through September, but you can view
the island from across the lake only. Admission costs £12 ($22) adults, £10 ($19) sen-
iors, £6 ($11) children, and £30 ($56) families (two adults and two children). The charge
includes admission to the Diana Museum set up by her brother, Earl Spencer. The
museum contains an exhibit celebrating Diana’s childhood, her royal wedding (includ-
ing her famous wedding gown), and her charitable works. You can book your tickets
in advance by calling % 0870/167-9000. You can also buy day-of tickets at the Gate
House or online at www.althorp.com.

Regent’s Park
Marylebone
Regent’s Park spans 400 acres of green, mostly open parkland fringed by
imposing Regency terraces. The park is the home of the London Zoo
(described under “London’s Top Sights,” earlier in this chapter). People
come here to play soccer, cricket, tennis, and softball; boat on the lake;
visit Queen Mary’s Rose Garden (which includes an outdoor theater —
see Chapter 15); and let their kids have fun at the many playgrounds. The
park offers summer lunch and evening bandstand concerts, as well as
puppet shows and other children’s activities on weekdays throughout
August. The northernmost section of the park rises to the summit of
Primrose Hill, which provides fine views of Westminster and the City. The
restrooms by Chester Gate, on the east side of the park, offer facilities for
persons with disabilities.
See map p. 210. Just north of Marylebone Road and surrounded by the Outer Circle
road. % 020/7486-7905, or 020/7486-2431 for advance booking for Open Air Theatre
(operating late May to early Sept). www.openairtheatre.org. Tube: Regent’s
Park or Baker Street (then a five-minute walk north to the south end of the park).
Open: Daily 5 a.m.–dusk.
Royal Botanic Gardens
Kew
Located 9 miles southwest of Central London, the Royal Botanic Gardens
at Kew — more familiarly known as Kew Gardens — are a gift to garden
lovers. A trip to Kew takes the better part of a day to allow for travel time
and garden strolling, but the enjoyment that you receive is well worth the
time investment. On display in the 300-acre gardens is a marvelous array
of specimens first planted in the 17th and 18th centuries. Orchids and
palms are nurtured in the Victorian glass pavilion hothouse. The site con-
tains a lake, aquatic gardens, a Chinese pagoda, and even a royal palace.
Kew Palace, the smallest and most lovely of the former royal compounds,
is where King George III went insane. Queen Charlotte’s Cottage served
as the mad king’s summer retreat (unfortunately, the palace and cottage
are not open to the public).
Tired of the Tube? Why not take a boat to Kew Gardens? April to late
September, vessels operated by the Westminster Passenger Service
Association (% 020/7930-4721; www.wpsa.co.uk) leave from Westminster
Pier daily at 10:15, 11:15 a.m., noon, and 2 p.m. Round-trip fare for the 
90-minute journey costs £17 ($31) adults, £11 ($20) seniors, £8.25 ($15)
children, and £41 ($76) families. The last boat from Kew usually departs
around 5.30 p.m. (depending on the tide).
Kew. % 020/8332-5622. Tube: Kew Gardens (then a ten-minute walk west on
Broomfield Street to the Victoria Gate entrance on Kew Road). Admission: £10 ($19)
adults, free for children 5–16. Tours: Mar–Nov free one-hour tours daily at 11 a.m.
and 2 p.m. Open: Gardens daily 9:30 a.m.–dusk; glass pavilion closes one hour before
gardens. Closed Dec 25 and Jan 1.

A quaint village just a Tube ride away
The London that you see today was once a series of separate villages.
The nearby village of Hampstead, with its adjacent heath land, still
retains its rural charm and makes for an excellent mini–day trip.
Hampstead and Hampstead Heath
Although only 15 minutes by Tube from Central London, Hampstead main-
tains its old-world charm. It’s filled with Regency and Georgian houses
(many set in lovely gardens) favored by artists and writers, from Keats to
John Le Carré. Flask Walk, the village’s pedestrian mall, provides an eclec-
tic assemblage of historic pubs, shops, and chic boutiques. The village itself
has a lot of old alleys, steps, courts, and groves just begging to be explored.
Adjacent Hampstead Heath is 800 acres of high parkland offering an
opportunity for picnicking, swimming, and fishing. On a clear day, you can
see St. Paul’s Cathedral and even the hills of Kent. An excursion here takes
up at least a half-day or more.
See map p. 227. Tube: Hampstead (the Tube stop is a minute from Flask Walk) or
Hampstead Heath (Parliament Hill, right behind the Tube stop, leads up into to the
park itself).
Kenwood House
This lovely neoclassical villa sits on the shore of Kenwood Lake in the
northern section of Hampstead Heath. The villa was remodeled in the 1760s
by Robert Adam. Inside, you find a small but impressive collection of paint-
ings (with works by Gainsborough, Rembrandt, Reynolds, Turner, and
Vermeer) and jewelry. You can get something to eat in the cafeteria in the
former coach house. For a remarkable summer outdoor concert experi-
ence, visit the Kenwood Lakeside concert. (See Chapter 15 for information.)

Royal castles and palaces
Everyone wants to see Buckingham Palace, the queen’s London resi-
dence. But another royal residence, accessible year-round, awaits in
nearby Windsor. Just as memorable is Hampton Court, another great
royal compound from the time of Henry VIII.
Hampton Court Palace
In 1514, Cardinal Wolsey began building the splendid Tudor Hampton
Court in East Moseley, Surrey, 13 miles west of London on the north side
of the Thames. Henry VIII nabbed Hampton Court for himself and made it

a royal residence, which it remained until 1760. The Anne Boleyn Gate,
with its 16th-century astronomical clock, and the Great Hall, with its
hammer-beam ceiling, are remnants from Hampton Court’s Tudor days.
Later, the palace was much altered by Sir Christopher Wren for William
and Mary. Wren also designed the famous Maze, where visitors can wander
in dizzy confusion. Inside the enormous palace are various state apart-
ments and private rooms, including the King’s Dressing Room and Tudor
kitchens, and containing wooden carvings by Grinling Gibbons, Italian

paintings, and guides dressed in period costumes. The manicured Thames-
side gardens are lovely. You find a cafe and restaurant on the grounds. You
need a full day for this excursion.
Hampton Court, East Moseley, Surrey. % 0870/752-7777. Train: Frequent trains from
Waterloo Station make the half-hour trip to Hampton Court Station; the round-trip
fare costs about £5 ($9.25). Admission: £12 ($22) adults, £8.70 ($16) seniors and stu-
dents, £7.70 ($14) children 5–15. Open: Apr–Oct daily 10 a.m.–6 p.m.; Nov–Feb
Tues–Sun 9:30 a.m.–4:30 p.m., Mon 10:15 a.m.–4:30 p.m. Closed Jan 1 and Dec 24–26.
Windsor Castle
Windsor is one of the queen’s official residences. The castle, with its impos-
ing skyline of towers and battlements rising from the center of the 4,800-acre
Great Park, is located in Windsor, Berkshire, 20 miles from the center of
London. Royals have used the castle as a residence since its construction by
William the Conqueror approximately 900 years ago. The State Apartments
that are open to visitors range from the intimate chambers of Charles II to
the enormous Waterloo Chamber, built to commemorate the victory over
Napoléon in 1815. All apartments are furnished with important works of art
from the Royal Collection. Queen Mary’s Dollhouse, designed by Sir Edwin
Lutyens as a present for Queen Mary in 1921, is a marvelous palace in minia-
ture. St. George’s Chapel, a Gothic masterpiece of the 14th century, is the
burial place of ten monarchs and the home of the Order of the Garter.
April through June, the Changing of the Guard takes place Monday
through Saturday at 11 a.m. (on alternate days the rest of the year). From
the ramparts of Windsor, you can look down on the playing fields of Eton
College, where aristocrats have been sending their boys for generations.
All the royals attend the famous school in the charming town of Eton
across the Thames Bridge. Give yourself a full day for this excursion.
Windsor. % 01753/831118. Train: Trains leave every half-hour from Waterloo Station for
the 50-minute trip (the stop is Windsor and Eton); the round-trip fare costs £7 ($13).

Ghost palace
So many people, from staff to visitors, have reported encounters with Catherine
Howard’s ghost in the “haunted gallery” at Hampton Court that psychologists from the
University of Hertfordshire conducted an investigation to see if they could find a sci-
entific explanation for the phenomenon — not surprisingly, the results were incon-
clusive. Catherine, the fifth wife of King Henry VIII, was locked up in Hampton Court
prior to her beheading for adultery in 1542. One day, she supposedly escaped and in
desperation ran along the 40-foot gallery to pound on the King’s door and beg for
mercy. Sightings in this gallery of a running, screaming apparition have been reported
for centuries.

Greenwich: The center of time and space
Time is of the essence in Greenwich, a town and borough of Greater
London, about 4 miles east of the City. The world’s clocks are set accord-
ing to Greenwich mean time, and visitors from around the globe flock
here to stand on the prime meridian, the line from which the world’s
longitude is measured. The historic buildings in Greenwich are impor-
tant enough that UNESCO has listed them as a World Heritage Site.
Greenwich offers enough to keep you fully occupied for a full day, and it
makes a great outing for kids.
The most interesting route to get to Greenwich is by Docklands Light
Rail from Tower Hill Gateway, which takes you past Canary Wharf and all
the new Docklands development. The one-way fare costs £2 ($3.70). Take
the train to Island Gardens, the last stop, and then walk through the foot
tunnel beneath the Thames to Greenwich. You come out next to the Cutty
Sark. You can also take the Jubilee Underground line to Greenwich North
and then bus no. 188 to the Cutty Sark. Thames River Services (% 020/
7930-4097) runs a year-round fleet of boats from Westminster Pier to
Greenwich Pier. A round-trip ticket costs £8.60 ($16) adults, £22 ($41) for
families (two adults and two children).
All the attractions in Greenwich are clearly signposted, and you can
reach them on foot. The Greenwich Tourist Information Centre (Pepys
House, Cutty Sark Gardens; % 0870/608-2000) is open daily 10 a.m. to 5
p.m. The center offers one-and-a-half-hour to two-hour walking tours (at
12:15 and 2:15 p.m.) of the town’s major sights for £4 ($7.40). Reservations
aren’t necessary, but you may want to call first to make certain that the
schedule hasn’t changed.
Cutty Sark
The majestic Cutty Sark, berthed on the river Thames, is the last of the tea-
clipper sailing ships. It was launched in 1869 and first used for the lucra-
tive China Sea tea trade. Later, the ship carried wool from Australia and
after that (up until the end of World War II) served as a training ship.
Today, the hold contains a rich collection of nautical instruments and para-
phernalia. You can visit the ship on a self-guided tour and see everything
in under an hour. Kids enjoy the experience of being aboard the old ship
as much as adults.
King William Walk. % 020/8858-3445. Admission: £4.50 ($8.35) adults, £3.75 ($6.95)
seniors and students, £3.30 ($6.10) children, £12 ($22) families (two adults and two
children). Open: Daily 10 a.m.–5 p.m; closed Dec 24–26.
National Maritime Museum
The paintings of ships are boring, but the National Maritime Museum also
displays sailing crafts and models and an extensive exhibit on Lord Nelson,
which includes hundreds of his personal artifacts (including the coat that
he was wearing when he was shot at the Battle of Trafalgar). New galleries
Chapter 11: Discovering London’s Top Attractions 229

with interactive technology explore modern maritime issues. You can sail
through in about a half-hour. There’s a nice café for lunch or a snack.
In Greenwich Park. % 020/8312-6608. Admission: Free. Open: Daily 10 a.m.–5 p.m.
(June–Sept until 6 p.m.).
Queen’s House
Adjacent to the National Maritime Museum, you can find the splendidly
restored Queen’s House, designed by Inigo Jones in 1616 and later used as
a model for the White House. The house, the first classical building in
England, was commissioned by Anne of Denmark, the wife of James I, and
completed in 1635 (with later modifications). You can visit the royal apart-
ments on a self-guided tour that takes about a half-hour. You may catch a
special exhibit being held here.
In Greenwich Park. % 020/8312-6608. Admission: Free. Open: Daily 10 a.m.–5 p.m.
Royal Naval College
Near the Cutty Sark, the Royal Naval College occupies the site of Greenwich
Palace, which stood here from 1422 to 1620 and was the birthplace of Henry
VIII, Mary I, and Elizabeth I. Badly damaged by Cromwell’s troops during
the English Civil War, the palace was later torn down, and in 1696, a naval
hospital for retired seamen was erected in its place. The Thames-side build-
ings, designed by Sir Christopher Wren, became the Naval College in 1873
and are today a UNESCO-designated World Heritage Site. The only rooms
open to visitors are the chapel and the imposing Great Hall with its daz-
zling painted ceiling. The body of Lord Nelson lay in state here in 1805.
King William Walk. % 020/8858-2154. Admission: Free. Open: Daily 10 a.m.–5 p.m.
Royal Observatory Greenwich
You can huff your way up the hill from Queen’s House (see listing earlier
in this section) in Greenwich Great Park to explore the Royal Observatory,
where you can straddle the prime meridian (longitude 0 degrees), the
center of time and space. Of particular interest inside the observatory is
the collection of original 18th-century chronometers (marked H1, H2, H3,
and H4), beautiful instruments that were developed to help mariners chart
longitude by time instead of by the stars. The prime meridian line and the
various astronomical gadgets in the observatory appeal to the imagina-
tions of older kids.
In Greenwich Park. % 020/8312-6608. Admission: Free. Open: Daily 10 a.m.–5 p.m.
(June–Sept until 6 p.m.).
Seeing London by Guided Tour
When it comes to London sightseeing tours, you’re limited only by your
imagination, stamina, and budget. You can tour London with an experi-
enced guide by bus, by boat, or on foot.
Part IV: Exploring London

Bus tours
Original London Sightseeing Tours (% 020/8877-1722; www.the
originaltour.com) maintains a fleet of double-decker buses (many of
them open on top) and offers hop-on/hop-off service at more than 90
boarding points around the city. You can choose from four tour routes.
The Original London Sightseeing Tour lasts 90 minutes and passes every
major sight in Central London and the South Bank; the tour starts from
Piccadilly Circus (Tube: Piccadilly Circus) outside the Planet Hollywood
restaurant on Coventry Street and departs every few minutes daily from 
9 a.m. to 6 p.m. (to 9 p.m. in summer). You don’t have to book any of the
sightseeing tours in advance; you can pay on the bus. A ticket good for 
24 hours on all routes costs £16 ($30) for adults and £10 ($19) for children
under 16. For more information or to book online, check out the Web site.

(4:30 p.m. in winter) on three different routes that take anywhere from
one and a half to two and a half hours. Tickets include a river cruise and
walking tours, and cost £18 ($33) for adults and £8 ($15) for children
ages 5 to 15. Valid for 24 hours, they let you hop on and off at 54 loca-
tions. Big Bus often has special offers, too, throwing in cheap theater
tickets, fast-entry to popular attractions, and so on.
Another tour company with many guided excursions is Golden Tours
(4 Fountain Square, 123–151 Buckingham Palace Rd.; % 800-456-6303
in the U.S. or 020/7233-7030; www.goldentours.co.uk). Its buses are
comfy and have restrooms, and the certified guides have a certifiable
sense of humor. The daily Historic & Modern London tour is a full-day
outing that includes the West End, Westminster Abbey, the Changing of
the Guard (at Buckingham Palace or Horse Guards Parade), the City of
London, St. Paul’s Cathedral, the Tower of London, and a cruise from the
Tower down to Charing Cross Pier; the price includes a pub lunch and
all admissions. This tour costs £64 ($118) for adults and £54 ($100) for
kids under 16. Tours depart from the office at Buckingham Palace Road
(Tube: Victoria) and other points in Central London. You can book your
tickets directly or online, or you can ask your hotel concierge to do it
two days in advance.
Boat tours
A cruise down the majestic Thames is a marvelous way to take in the
city’s sights. Sightseeing boats regularly ply the river between Westminster
and the Tower of London; some continue downstream to Greenwich
(site of the prime meridian, Cutty Sark, and Old Royal Observatory) and
upstream to Kew Gardens and Hampton Court. The main departure
points along the Thames are at Westminster Pier (Tube: Westminster),
Waterloo Pier (Tube: Waterloo), Embankment Pier (Tube: Embankment),
Tower Pier (Tube: Tower Hill), and Greenwich Pier (Tube: Greenwich).

year, Catamaran Cruisers (% 020/7987-1185; www.catamarancruisers.
co.uk) offers a one-hour circular cruise from Westminster Pier (Tube:
Westminster) that passes most of London’s major monuments and stops
at Festival Pier, Bankside Pier, London Bridge City Pier, and St. Katharine’s

An amphibious tour
London Duck Tours (% 020/7928-3132; www.londonducktours.co.uk)
has adapted several World War II amphibious troop carriers, known as
DUKWs, to civilian comfort levels and painted them bright yellow. It runs
80-minute road-and-river trips. Tours start behind County Hall (site of
the British Airways London Eye giant observation wheel). It picks up
passengers on Chicheley Street (Tube: Westminster, then walk across
Westminster Bridge), then rumbles through Westminster and up to
Piccadilly, gathering bemused stares as it passes many of London’s
Part IV: Exploring London 
232

major tourist sites. Then the vehicle splashes into the Thames at Vauxhall
for a 30-minute cruise as far as the Houses of Parliament. The tours cost
£18 ($33) for adults, £14 ($26) for seniors, and £12 ($22) for children.
Walking tours
A walking tour is an affordable way to see London from street level in
the company of a knowledgeable guide. This type of tour is great for his-
tory, literature, and architecture buffs, and older kids generally have a
good time, as well. The weekly events listings in Time Out magazine,
available at every news agent in London, include dozens of intriguing
walks; a walk happens every day.
The Original London Walks, P.O. Box 1708, London NW6 4LW (% 020/
7624-3978; www.walks.com), offers a terrific array of tours, including
Jack the Ripper’s London, Christopher Wren’s London, Oscar Wilde’s
London, and The Beatles’ Magical Mystery Tour. Guides lead different
walks every day of the week, rain or shine; tours last about two hours
and end near an Underground station. You don’t need to make advance
reservations. Call for schedules and departure points. A London Walk
costs £5.50 ($10) for adults and £4.50 ($8.35) for students with ID; kids
can tour for free if accompanied by a parent.

offered in Frommer’s Memorable Walks in London, by Richard Jones (Wiley).

Shopping the Local Stores
In This Chapter

 Visiting the big department stores
 Shopping Knightsbridge and the West End
L
ondon is one of the world’s great shopping meccas. If shopping is on
your agenda, you can find any item that you’re looking for. But you
won’t find many bargains, except during the department stores’ big sales
in January and July (see the “Saving on the London sales” sidebar).
Surveying the Shopping Scene
You get the best values on goods that are manufactured in England.
Items from the Body Shop, Filofax, or Dr. Martens cost less than they do
in the United States. Other potentially good values include woolens and
cashmeres, English brands of bone china, English toiletries, antiques,
used silver, old maps and engravings, and rare books. You can also do
well with French products; the prices are almost as good as in Paris.
You may be surprised — and perhaps disappointed — at the number of
big U.S. chains that have opened stores in London. But in addition to the
familiar chains and mega-stores, London is still the home of hundreds of
small, unique specialty shops and boutiques to delight the eye and
empty the wallet.
Normal shopping hours are Monday through Saturday 10 a.m. to 5:30
p.m., with a late closing (7 or 8 p.m.) on Wednesday or Thursday. The
law allows stores to be open for six hours on Sunday, usually 11 a.m. 
to 5 p.m.

Getting the VAT back
You have to pay a 17.5-percent VAT (value-added tax) in London and
throughout the United Kingdom on every retail item except books and
children’s clothing. Anyone who isn’t a resident of the European Union
can get a VAT refund, but every store requires a minimum purchase to
Part IV: Exploring London 
238
Saving on the London sales
Traditionally, London stores hold sales in January and July. In recent times, the July
sales have begun in June or earlier. The January sale is the main event, and it gener-
ally starts after the first week (when round-trip airfares are low).
The January sale at Harrods is the most world famous, but nearly every other store has
a big sale at the same time. Discounts usually range from 25 to 50 percent at the major
stores, such as Harrods and Selfridges. At Harrods, you can find the best buys on the
store’s logo souvenirs, English china, and English designer brands, such as Jaeger.

qualify. The exact amount varies from store to store, but the minimum
amount is never less than £50 ($93) and may be as high as £100 ($185) at
a store like Harrods. But qualifying for a tax refund is far easier in Britain
than in almost any other country in the European Union.
VAT isn’t charged on goods shipped out of the country, no matter how
much you spend. You can avoid VAT and the hassle of lugging large pack-
ages back with you by having London stores ship your purchases for
you; many are happy to do so. However, shipping charges can double the
cost of your purchase, and you may also have to pay U.S. duties when
the goods arrive. Rather than using this costly strategy, consider paying
for excess baggage (rates vary with the airlines) when you fly home.
To get a VAT refund, you must get a VAT refund form from the retailer,
and the retailer must complete the form at the time of purchase. Don’t
leave the store without a completed refund form. Don’t let any merchant
tell you that you can get refund forms at the airport.
You can get back about 15 percent of the 17.5 percent VAT that you pay
on your purchases. (You can’t get back the entire amount.) To obtain
your refund, follow these steps:
1. Ask the store whether it does VAT refunds and how much the
minimum purchase is.
2. If you’ve spent the minimum amount, ask for the VAT refund
paperwork.
The retailer must fill out a portion.
3. Fill out your portion of the form (name and address).
4. Present the form — along with the goods — at the VAT Refunds
counter at the airport.
You may be required to show the goods at your time of departure, so
don’t pack them in your checked luggage; put them in your carryon
instead.
After the paperwork is stamped, you have two choices:
 You can mail in the papers and receive your refund in a British
check (no!) or a credit-card refund (yes!).
 You can go directly to the Cash VAT Refund desk at the airport and
get your refund in cash.
If you’re traveling from London to other countries in the European
Union, don’t apply for your VAT refund at the London airport. Apply for
all your VAT refunds at one time at your final destination, prior to depar-
ture from the European Union.

Getting your goodies through Customs
The Customs authority doesn’t impose limits on how much loot U.S. citi-
zens can bring home from a trip abroad, but it does put limits on how
much they can bring back for free. You may bring home $800 worth of
goods duty-free if you’ve been out of the country at least 48 hours and
haven’t used the exemption in the past 30 days. Here’s some additional
information about the limit and Customs law:
 You can bring back not more than 1 liter of an alcoholic beverage
(you must be over 21 to carry any alcohol).
 You can carry not more than 200 cigarettes and 100 cigars.
 Antiques more than 100 years old and works of art are exempt from
the $800 limit, as is anything that you mail home from abroad.
 You may mail up to $200 worth of goods to yourself (marked “For
Personal Use”) and up to $100 worth to others (marked
“Unsolicited Gift”) once each day, as long as the package doesn’t
include alcohol or tobacco products.
 You have to pay an import duty on anything over these limits — a
flat rate of 10 percent duty on the next $1,000 worth of purchases.
 You have to show proof of ownership for any expensive items, such
as cameras or laptop computers, that you take with you to the
United Kingdom. If you don’t have proof (such as sales receipts or
insurance forms), you can register the items before your trip by
using Custom Form 4457, available through the U.S. Customs
Service.
Be sure to have your receipts with you. For more specific guidance, 
contact the U.S. Customs Service (P.O. Box 7407, Washington, DC 20044;
% 202/927-6724) and request the free pamphlet Know Before You Go. Or
check out the details and order online at the Customs Department Web
site, www.customs.ustreas.gov.
Returning Canadian citizens are allowed a C$300 exemption and can
bring back, free of duty, 200 cigarettes, 2.2 pounds of tobacco, 40 impe-
rial ounces (1.2 quarts) of liquor, and 50 cigars. Declare all valuables that
you’re taking with you to the United Kingdom, such as expensive cam-
eras, on the Y-38 Form before you leave Canada. For a clear summary of
Canadian rules, write for the booklet I Declare, issued by Revenue
Canada (2265 St. Laurent Blvd., Ottawa K1G 4KE; % 800/461-9999 or
613-993-0534).
Returning Australian citizens have a duty-free allowance of A$400 (A$200
for children under 18). Citizens can bring home, free of duty, 250 cigarettes
or 250 grams of loose tobacco, and 1.125 liters of alcohol. Australian 
citizens who plan to return home with valuable goods that they already
own (for example, foreign-made cameras) need to file Form B263 before
Part IV: Exploring London 
240

leaving Australia. For more information, contact Australian Customs
Services (GPO Box 8, Sydney NSW 2001; % 02/9213-2000).
The duty-free allowance for New Zealand citizens is NZ$700. Citizens
over 17 can bring in 200 cigarettes, 50 cigars, or 250 grams of tobacco, or
a mix of all three if the combined weight doesn’t exceed 250 grams; plus
4.5 liters of beer and wine, or 1.125 liters of liquor. To avoid paying duty
on goods that you already own (cameras and the like), fill out a certifi-
cate of export before you leave New Zealand, listing the valuables that
you’re taking out of the country. For more information, contact New
Zealand Customs (50 Anzac Ave., P.O. Box 29, Auckland; % 09/359-6655).
Checking Out the Big Names
London is full of department stores. Some, like world-famous Harrods,
may be familiar to you. Others, like Harvey Nichols, may be pleasant 
surprises. All these established department stores have their own style
and personality. For store locations, see the “Shopping in Knightsbridge
and Chelsea” map on p. 246 and the “Shopping in the West End” map on
p. 248.
Fenwick of Bond Street
Mayfair
Fenwick of Bond Street is a high-style women’s fashion store. Fenwick (pro-
nounced Fen-ick) was founded in 1891 and offers an impressive collection
of designer women’s wear, ranging from moderately priced ready-to-wear
items to more expensive designer fashions. Fenwick also sells an array of
lingerie in all price ranges.
See map p. 248. 63 New Bond St., W1. % 020/7629-9161. Tube: Bond Street. Open:
Mon–Tues and Thurs–Sat 10 a.m.–6:30 p.m. and Wed 10 a.m.–8 p.m.
Fortnum & Mason
St. James’s
Fortnum & Mason, down the street from the Ritz hotel, holds two royal
warrants (a form of official patronage that the store can use in its adver-
tising) and is the queen’s London grocer. Amid a setting of deep-red car-
pets and crystal chandeliers, you can find everything from pâté de foie
gras to Campbell’s soup. The grocery department carries the finest foods
from around the world, and on the other floors, you can find bone china,
crystal, leather, antiques, and stationery departments. Dining choices
include Patio, St. James’s, and The Fountain (see Chapter 10).
See map p. 248. 181 Piccadilly, W1. % 020/7734-8040. Tube: Piccadilly Circus. Open:
Mon–Sat 10 a.m.–6:30 p.m.
Chapter 12: Shopping the Local Stores 241

Harrods
Knightsbridge
Harrods may be the most famous department store in the world, but I’ve
always found its merchandise to be pretty dull stuff. Carrying one of the
coveted green plastic Harrods bags that you get with your purchase can
provide you with a sense of accomplishment, though. The store’s 300
departments offer an enormous range and variety of merchandise. Best of
all are the Food Halls, stocked with a huge variety of foods and several
cafes. Believe it or not, you may not be admitted if you’re wearing inap-
propriate clothing or your belly button is showing.
See map p. 246. 87–135 Brompton Rd., SW1. % 020/7730-1234. Tube: Knightsbridge.
Open: Mon–Sat 10 a.m.–7 p.m.
Harvey Nichols
Knightsbridge
Harvey Nichols, the late Princess Diana’s favorite store, has its own gour-
met food hall and fancy restaurant, the Fifth Floor, and is crammed with
designer home furnishings, gifts, and fashions. Women’s clothing is the
largest segment of its business, a familiar fact to those fans of the British
TV series Absolutely Fabulous. Harvey Nicks, as it’s called, doesn’t com-
pete with Harrods because the former features a much more upmarket,
fashionable image.
See map p. 246. 109–125 Knightsbridge, SW1. % 020/7235-5000. Tube: Knightsbridge.
Open: Mon, Tues, and Sat 10 a.m.–7 p.m., Wed–Fri 10 a.m.–8 p.m., and Sun noon–6 p.m.
Liberty
Mayfair
Liberty provides six floors of fashion, china, home furnishings, upholstery
fabrics, scarves, ties, luggage, and gifts. The store is best known for its
Part IV: Exploring London 
242
Harrods loses royal warrant
The London gossip columns were ablaze early in 2000 when Prince Philip withdrew his
royal warrant (a sign of official royal patronage) from Harrods, claiming that the royal
household just didn’t use the store as much as it used to. Harrods just happens to be
owned by Mohamed Al Fayed, father of Dodi Al Fayed, who was killed with Princess
Diana in that famous car crash. The elder Mr. Al Fayed, an Egyptian who’s been denied
U.K. citizenship, has made some startling allegations against the House of Windsor,
claiming that the deaths of Diana and his son were not accidental. Could that be the
real reason that Harrods is now warrant-less?

Liberty Prints — fine quality fabrics, typically in floral patterns. These dis-
tinctive fabrics are highly sought after by interior decorators because they
add an unmistakable touch of England to any room décor. A Liberty tie
makes a great gift for your guy back home.
See map p. 248. 214–220 Regent St., W1. % 020/7734-1234. Tube: Oxford Circus. Open:
Mon–Wed 10 a.m.–6:30 p.m, Thurs 10 a.m.–8 p.m., Fri–Sat 10 a.m.–7 p.m., Sun noon
to 6 p.m.
Marks & Spencer
Mayfair
Marks & Spencer is a private-label department store that offers basics of
all kinds. The merchandise at both locations is high quality, if a bit con-
servative.
See map p. 248. 458 Oxford St., W1 (% 020/7935-7954; Tube: Marble Arch) and 173
Oxford St., W1 (% 020/7437-7722; Tube: Oxford Circus). Open: Mon–Fri 9 a.m.–8 p.m.,
Sat 9 a.m.–7:30 p.m., and Sun noon–6 p.m.
Selfridges
Mayfair
Selfridges is one of the largest department stores in Europe. The store has
been redone to attract upscale customers, but the vast size of the store
provides room for less-expensive, mass-marketed lines, as well. More than
500 divisions sell everything, from artificial flowers to groceries. The Miss
Selfridge boutique, on one side of the store near the cosmetics depart-
ment, features teen fashions, hotshot clothes, accessories, makeup, and
moderately priced, cutting-edge fashions. While on this side of the store,
you can visit the cafe.
See map p. 248. 400 Oxford St., W1. % 020/7629-1234. Tube: Bond Street or Marble
Arch. Open: Mon–Wed 10 a.m.–7 p.m., Thurs–Fri 10 a.m.–8 p.m., Sat 9:30 a.m.–7 p.m.,
and Sun 11:30 a.m.–6 p.m.
Chapter 12: Shopping the Local Stores 243
Finding a drugstore
The English refer to a drugstore as a chemist’s shop. All over London, you can find
Boots the Chemist stores. In terms of size and convenience, the best one is just across
from Harrods (at 72 Brompton Rd., SW3; % 020/7589-6557; Tube: Knightsbridge). In
addition to medicine, Boots sells film, pantyhose (called tights), sandwiches, and all of
life’s little necessities. The store is open Monday through Friday 8:30 a.m. to 7 p.m. and
Saturday 9 a.m. to 7 p.m. One of the most centrally located chemists is Bliss the
Chemist (5 Marble Arch, W1; % 020/7723-6116; Tube: Marble Arch), open daily 9 a.m.
to midnight. Zafash Pharmacy (233–235 Old Brompton Rd., SW5 % 020/7373-2798;
Tube: Earl’s Court) is London’s only 24-hour pharmacy.

Shopping the Street Markets
Markets make for fun shopping because you never know what you may
find. Adventurous shoppers who like to browse and dawdle can really
enjoy themselves at the places listed in this section.
Chelsea and Antiquarius
In a rambling old building, the Chelsea Antiques Market (253 King’s Rd.,
SW3; % 020/7352-5686; Tube: Sloane Square; see the map on p. 246)
offers endless bric-a-brac browsing possibilities. You can search out old
or rare books at this market. You’ll probably run across Staffordshire
dogs, shaving mugs, Edwardian buckles and clasps, ivory-handled
razors, old velours, lace gowns, and wooden tea caddies; and that’s just
the beginning. The market is closed on Sunday.
Another good market is Antiquarius (131–141 King’s Rd., SW3; % 020/
7351-5353; Tube: Sloane Square; see the map on p. 246), where more
than 120 dealers offer specialized merchandise — usually of the small,
domestic variety, such as antique and period jewelry, porcelain, silver,
first-edition books, boxes, clocks, prints, and paintings. The shops and
booths are generally open Monday through Saturday from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m.
Covent Garden
The Covent Garden Market (% 020/7836-9136; Tube: Covent Garden;
see the map on p. 248) includes retail stores and two different markets (the
kind with open-air stalls), open daily 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. Traders sell all kinds
of goods at the busy Apple Market. Much of the merchandise is what the
English call collectible nostalgia, which includes glassware and ceramics,
leather goods, toys, clothes, hats, and jewelry. Antiques dealers predomi-
nate on Mondays. You can find Jubilee Market (% 020/7836-2139), a bit
more downscale market where you can find cheap clothes and books, at
the backside of Covent Garden. You can find some of London’s best shop-
ping at the restored hall on The Piazza and at specialty shops in the area.
Portobello Road
Kensington Church Street dead-ends at the Notting Hill Gate Tube sta-
tion, which is the jumping-off point for Portobello Market (no phone;
Tube: Notting Hill Gate), the famous London street market along
Portobello Road. Portobello (market and road) is a magnet for collectors
of virtually anything from precious junk to precious antiques. The
market is generally open Saturday 6 a.m. to 5 p.m. You may find that per-
fect Regency commode that you’ve always wanted or a piece of Art Deco
jewelry. But mixed in with the good stuff is an abundance of overpriced
junk. Now that everything’s been discovered and designated collectible,
the prices are often too high.
The Portobello Market on a busy Saturday is prime pickpocketing terri-
tory. Keep an eye or a hand on your wallet or purse.
Part IV: Exploring London 
244

If you want to check out the shops along Portobello Road, you may want
to visit during the week. Approximately 90 antiques and art shops are
open here during the week when the street market is closed. Weekdays
are a better time for serious collectors to shop, because they get more
attention from dealers and aren’t distracted by the throngs of shoppers.
Discovering the Best Shopping Neighborhoods
London’s two major shopping areas are Knightsbridge and the West End.
You can find some of London’s most famous and most impressive stores
along several key streets in these two areas. You also can find all the
department stores listed in the “Checking Out the Big Names” section,
earlier in this chapter.
Knightsbridge: Home of Harrods
The home of department stores Harrods and Harvey Nichols,
Knightsbridge is the second-most-famous of London’s retail districts.
(See the map “Shopping in Knightsbridge and Chelsea” on p. 246.)
Brompton Road (home to Harrods) runs southwest from the
Knightsbridge Tube stop. Beauchamp Place (pronounced Beech-um),
one of the streets running south from Brompton Road, is only 1 block
long, but it’s full of the kinds of trendy, upscale shops where young
British aristocrats buy their clothing for “the season.” In the 1980s, the
future Princess Diana and other young bluebloods and yuppies were
dubbed “the Sloane Rangers” because this area near Sloane Square was
their favorite shopping grounds (and Range Rovers were their favorite
cars). Cheval Place, running parallel to Brompton Road to the north, is
lined with designer resale shops. Sloane Street, where you can find
plenty of fashion boutiques, runs south from the Knightsbridge Tube
stop to Sloane Square and the beginning of Chelsea.
The Map House of London (54 Beauchamp Place, SW3; % 020/7589-4325;
Tube: Knightsbridge) is an ideal place to find a sophisticated souvenir,
maybe an antique map, an engraving, or an old print of London; a 
century-old original engraving can cost as little as £15 ($28).
Chelsea: The young and the antique
Chelsea is famous for King’s Road (Tube: Sloane Square). This is the
area’s main street and, along with Carnaby Street, is branded in
Londoner’s minds (those over 40, that is) as the street of the Swinging
Sixties. It’s still swinging today, especially on a Saturday, when you can
hardly find room to walk. About one-third of King’s Road is devoted to
antiques markets and multi-stores (large or small groups of indoor
stands, stalls, and booths within one enclosure); another third houses
design trade showrooms and stores of household wares; and the remain-
ing third remains faithful to the area’s teenybopper roots. King’s Road
begins on the west side of the Sloane Square Tube stop.

A Chelsea emporium founded in 1877, Peter Jones (Sloane Square, SW1;
% 020/7730-3434; Tube: Sloane Square; see the map on p. 246) is known
for household goods, household fabrics and trims, china, glass, soft fur-
nishings, and linens. The linen department is one of the best in London.
Lush (123 King’s Rd., SW3; Tube: Sloane Square; see the map on p. 246) is
an aromatherapy bath and body shop where handmade soaps are cut
from blocks, like cheese, and potential gifts include fizzing bath bombs.
The other branches are in Covent Garden, Oxford Street, Kensington High
Street, and Carnaby Street. You may also want to check out the Chelsea
Antiques Market and Antiquarius. (See the section “Shopping the Street
Markets,” earlier in this chapter.)
Kensington: Street chic
You can reach Kensington, west of Knightsbridge, by taking the Tube to
High Street Kensington, the area’s preeminent shopping street. Many of
this neighborhood’s retail shops cater to street-chic teens. Several chain
stores are here as well.
Kensington Church Street, running north to Notting Hill, is one of the
city’s main shopping avenues for antiques, selling everything from
antique furniture to Impressionist paintings.
The Children’s Book Centre (237 Kensington High St., W8; % 020/7937-
7497; Tube: High Street Kensington) is the best place in London to go for
children’s books. Fiction is arranged according to age, up to 16. The
center also sells videos and toys for kids.
Holborn: Heigh-ho, Silver!
Don’t let the slightly out-of-the-way Holborn location, or the facade’s lack
of charm, put you off visiting the London Silver Vaults (Chancery House,
53–63 Chancery Lane, WC2; % 020/7242-3248; Tube: Chancery Lane; see
the map on p. 248). Downstairs are the real vaults — 40 in all — filled
with a staggering collection of old and new silver and silver plate, plus a
collection of jewelry.
The West End: More famous 
shopping streets and stores
See the “Shopping in the West End” map on p. 248 for locations of the
West End stores that I describe in the following sections. The key shop-
ping areas in the West End are
 Oxford Street for affordable shopping
 Regent Street for fancier shops and more upscale department
stores and specialty dealers
 Piccadilly for older, established department stores
 Jermyn Street for traditional English luxury goods

 Bond Street for chic, upscale fashion boutiques
 Covent Garden for all-purpose shopping, often with a hipper edge
 St. Martin’s Court (between Charing Cross Road and St. Martin’s
Lane) for prints, posters, and books
Around Piccadilly Circus: A bit of everything
Many consider Piccadilly Circus the center of London. For the best shop-
ping in this area, head south from the Piccadilly Tube stop along Piccadilly
(the street) or northwest along Regent Street. The following list gives you
some of the most renowned stores around Piccadilly Circus:
 Burberry (18–22 Haymarket, SW1; % 020/7930-3343; Tube:
Piccadilly Circus) sells those famous raincoats, plus top-quality
men’s shirts, sportswear, knitwear, and accessories.
 Hatchards (187 Piccadilly, W1; % 020/7439-9921; Tube: Piccadilly
Circus; see the map on p. 248) was established in 1797 and is
London’s most historic and atmospheric bookstore.
 Tower Records (1 Piccadilly Circus, W1; % 020/7439-2500; Tube:
Piccadilly Circus; see the map on p. 248) is one of the largest tape
and CD stores in Europe. This store is practically a tourist attrac-
tion in its own right.
Jermyn Street: Traditional luxury
Two-block-long Jermyn Street lies a block south of Piccadilly between St.
James’s Street and Duke Street. Many of the posh men’s haberdashers
and toiletry shops along this street have been doing business for cen-
turies and cater to the Royals. They include the following shops:
 Farlows (5 Pall Mall, SW1; % 020/7839-2423; Tube: Piccadilly
Circus; see the map on p. 248) is famous for fishing and shooting
equipment and classic country clothing.
 Floris (89 Jermyn St., SW1; % 020/7930-2885; Tube: Piccadilly
Circus; see the map on p. 248) is a small mahogany-clad store that’s
been selling its own line of soaps and perfumes since 1851.
 Hilditch & Key (73 Jermyn St., SW1; % 020/7930-5336; Tube:
Piccadilly Circus; see the map on p. 248) has been selling perhaps
the finest men’s shirts in the world for more than a century. These
quality goods are 100-percent cotton, cut by hand, and sport but-
tons fashioned from real shell.
 Taylor of Old Bond Street (74 Jermyn St., SW1; % 020/7930-5544;
Tube: Piccadilly Circus; see the map on p. 248) was established in
1954 and is devoted to the shaving and personal hygiene needs of
men. The store offers the world’s finest collection of shaving
brushes, razors, and combs, plus soaps and hair lotions.
Part IV: Exploring London 
250

Regent Street: Upscale specialties
Regent Street begins in a grand sweeping curve on the west side of
Piccadilly Circus and heads north to intersect with Oxford Street. This
majestic thoroughfare is lined with upscale department stores and spe-
cialty boutiques. The Burlington Arcade is a must-see if you’re in this
area. This famous glass-roofed Regency passage, running from Piccadilly
to Burlington Gardens, is lit by wrought-iron lamps and decorated with
clusters of ferns and flowers. The arcade is lined with intriguing shops
and boutiques. (See the “Shopping in the West End” map on p. 248 for
locations of all the stores that I describe in this section.)
Savile Row, synonymous with hand-tailored men’s suits, lies a block
west of Regent Street. Its once-countercultural counterpart — in the
early Beatles years — is Carnaby Street, now making a comeback after
years as a depressing street of souvenir shops; Carnaby Street is a block
east of Regent Street. Royal Doulton Regent Street (154 Regent St., W1;
% 020/7734-3184; Tube: Piccadilly Circus or Oxford Circus) carries
English bone china, including Minton, Royal Crown Derby, and Royal
Doulton. (The Jan and July sales are excellent.) Scotch House (84–86
Regent St., W1; % 020/7734-0203; Tube: Piccadilly Circus) is known
globally for its selection of cashmere and wool knitwear for men,
women, and children; the store also sells tartan garments and acces-
sories, as well as Scottish tweed classics.
If you’re left-handed, you’re in luck at Anything Left Handed (57 Brewer
St., off Regent Street, W1; % 020/7437-3910; Tube: Piccadilly Circus).
This unique store sells practical items — everything from scissors to
corkscrews — for the southpaws in the world.
Hamleys (188–196 Regent St., W1; % 020/7494-2000; Tube: Piccadilly
Circus), the finest toy shop in the world, stocks more than 35,000 toys
and games on seven floors of fun and magic. You can get everything,
from cuddly stuffed animals and dolls to radio-controlled cars, train
sets, model kits, board games, outdoor toys, and computer games.
Oxford Street: Affordable big names
You may want to begin your shopping adventure at Oxford Street, get-
ting out at the Oxford Circus, Bond Street, or Tottenham Court Road
Tube stop. Oxford Street is more affordable than Regent Street (which
you can read about in the preceding section) — not as grand, but offer-
ing a good variety and quantity of stylish merchandise. (See the
“Shopping in the West End” map on p. 248 for the locations of all the
stores that I describe in this section.)
If you’re a chronic organizer who can’t live without your Filofax, head
immediately for The Filofax Centre (21 Conduit St., W1; % 020/7499-0457;
Tube: Oxford Circus). At this store on Conduit Street, which leads west
from Regency Street, you can find the entire range of inserts and books at
prices that are about half of what they are in the States. The Body Shop
stores are based in the United Kingdom but are now all over the States;
Chapter 12: Shopping the Local Stores 251

however, prices at the London branches are much lower. You can stock up
on their politically and environmentally correct beauty, bath, and aro-
matherapy products (375 Oxford St., W1; % 020/7409-7868; Tube: Bond
Street). You can find other branches in every shopping zone in London.
Bond Street: Designer chic
Bond Street, running parallel to Regent Street on the west and connect-
ing Piccadilly with Oxford Street, is home to all the hot international
designers and is London’s answer to New York’s Fifth Avenue. Bond
Street is divided into New (northern section) and Old (southern sec-
tion). Very expensive fashion boutiques line Bond Street and the adja-
cent streets. Davies Street, running south from outside the Bond Street
Tube station, is just one of the area’s choicer streets; Davies Mews is an
upscale shopping zone noted for its antiques dealers. You can access
the area from the north by the Bond Street Tube stop and from the
south by Green Park. (See the “Shopping in the West End” map on p. 248
for the locations of the stores that I describe in this section.)
Vivienne Westwood (6 Davies St., W1; % 020/7629-3757; Tube: Bond
Street) is one of the hottest British designers for women. This flagship
store carries a full range of jackets, skirts, trousers, blouses, dresses,
and evening dresses. Church’s (133 New Bond St., W1; % 020/7493-1474;
Tube: Bond Street) sells classy shoes easily recognized by the fashion
elite. Chocolate connoisseurs should visit Charbonnel et Walker (1 The
Royal Arcade, 28 Old Bond St., W1; % 020/7491-0939; Tube: Green Park),
famous for its hot chocolate (buy it by the tin) and strawberries-and-
cream chocolates.
Around Leicester Square: Music and memorabilia
Leicester Square itself boasts only giant movie palaces and touristy restau-
rants (and a reduced-price ticket booth). But the streets around Leicester
Square are filled with shops selling rare books, prints, and posters, some
relating to the performing arts. (See the “Shopping in the West End” map
on p. 248 for the locations of the stores that I describe in this section.)
The Leicester Square shops include the following:
 Dress Circle (57–59 Monmouth St., WC2; % 020/7240-2227; Tube:
Leicester Square) specializes in show-business memorabilia for all
West End and Broadway shows.
 MDC Classic Music (31–32 St. Martin’s Lane, WC2; %
020/7240-0270; Tube: Leicester Square), sitting right next to the
English National Opera, specializes in opera recordings; you
receive expert knowledge and personal service from the staff.
 Stanfords (12–14 Long Acre, WC2; % 020/7836-1321; Tube: Leicester
Square) was established in 1852, and is the world’s largest map shop
(many of its maps, which include worldwide touring and survey
maps, are unavailable elsewhere). Stanfords is also London’s best
travel bookstore.
Part IV: Exploring London 
252

Charing Cross Road: A book lover’s delight
Charing Cross Road is a book lover’s paradise because of its vast
number of bookstores, selling both new and old volumes. Many of these
places sell maps and guides, too, including the tourist’s necessity,
London A to Z. Remember: There is no added 17.5 percent VAT charge on
books. Some of the most fascinating bookstores include the following
(for locations, see the “Shopping in the West End” map on p. 248):
 Murder One (71–73 Charing Cross Rd., WC2; % 020/7734-3483;
Tube: Leicester Square) specializes in crime, romance, science-
fiction, and horror books. Crime and science-fiction magazines,
some obscure, are also available.
 Silver Moon Women’s Bookshop (64–68 Charing Cross Rd.; % 020/
7836-7906; Tube: Tottenham Court Road) stocks thousands of titles
by and about women, including a large selection of lesbian-related
books. Plus the shop offers videos and jewelry.
 W & G Foyle, Ltd. (113–119 Charing Cross Rd., WC2; % 020/7440-
3225; Tube: Tottenham Court Road) claims to be the world’s largest
bookstore, with an impressive array of hardcovers and paperbacks,
as well as travel maps, records, videotapes, and sheet music.
 Waterstone’s (121 Charing Cross Rd.; % 020/7434-4291; Tube:
Tottenham Court Road) is a U.K. chain with branches all over
London. You can find the latest releases and well-stocked sections
of books currently in print.
Covent Garden: Something for everyone
Try to save some of your shopping energy for Covent Garden, home of
what may be the most famous “market” in all of England: the Covent
Garden Market. (See the section “Shopping the Street Markets,” earlier
in this chapter.)
Excellent English soaps, toiletries, and aromatherapy goods, as well as
herbal goods, are available throughout the market and surrounding
streets, including at the following shops (for locations, see the
“Shopping in the West End” map on p. 248):
 Culpeper the Herbalist (8 The Market, Covent Garden, WC2; 
% 020/7379-6698; Tube: Covent Garden) sells food, bath, and aro-
matherapy products, as well as dream pillows, candles, sachets,
and that popular favorite: the battery-operated aromatherapy fan.
 Neal’s Yard Remedies (15 Neal’s Yard, off Shorts Garden, WC2; 
% 020/7379-7222; Tube: Covent Garden) is noted the world over
for its all-natural, herbal-based bath, beauty, and aromatherapy
products in cobalt-blue bottles.
Chapter 12: Shopping the Local Stores 253

 Penhaligon’s (41 Wellington St., WC2; % 020/7836-2150; Tube:
Covent Garden) is an exclusive-line Victorian perfumery dedicated
to good grooming. Choose from a large selection of perfumes, after-
shaves, soaps, candles, and bath oils for women and men.
Also in Covent Garden, you can find Dr. Martens Department Store (1–4
King St., WC2; % 020/7497-1460; Tube: Covent Garden), the flagship for
internationally famous “Doc Marts” shoes. Prices are far better here than
they are in the States.
Farther along, at 14 King St., is The Irish Shop (% 020/7379-3625; Tube:
Covent Garden), which sells a wide variety of articles shipped directly
from Ireland, including colorful knitwear, traditional Irish linens, hand-
knitted Aran fisherman’s sweaters, and Celtic jewelry.
And you can finish off at The Tea House (15A Neal St., WC2; % 020/
7240-7539; Tube: Covent Garden), which sells everything associated
with tea, tea drinking, and teatime.

Chapter 13
Following an Itinerary: 
Four Great Options
In This Chapter
 Seeing London on a reasonable schedule
 Planning fun itineraries for trips lasting three to seven days
 Visiting London with kids
E
very London visitor has to face one problem: how to see as much
as possible in a limited amount of time. You’re lucky if you have an
entire week or even more. But what if you have only three or five days at
your disposal? What if you’re bringing the family along? These questions
are what this chapter is all about. If you budget your time wisely and
choose your sights carefully, you can make the most of a limited sched-
ule or a trip with the kids.
This chapter offers four easy-to-do suggested daily itineraries. The first
itinerary covers the big sights. The next two are a little more adventur-
ous. The itinerary for families first addresses the top spots and then
heads to family-friendly destinations just outside the city.
The itineraries are common-sense, limited-time suggestions only. You
may want to spend your days doing something else entirely. Maybe
you’d really rather spend an entire day, rather than just a couple of
hours, in the British Museum. Maybe shopping in Chelsea and cafe hop-
ping in Soho is more appealing to you than watching the Changing of the
Guard at Buckingham Palace. Go for it! London can be enjoyed in count-
less ways that have nothing to do with traditional sightseeing.
For complete descriptions of the sights, plus exact street addresses,
open hours, and admission prices, see Chapter 11, unless I give you a
different chapter to check out.
London in Three Days
Three days doesn’t seem like a very long time. But in that short period,
you can hit most of the key sights in London and enjoy a memorable trip.

Start Day One with a visit to majestic Westminster Abbey, visiting the
Royal Tombs and Poets’ Corner. Afterward, because they’re right next
door, stroll around the Houses of Parliament. Unless you queue up to
hear a debate or take one of the guided tours, available from August
through September (see Chapter 11 for details), you won’t be able to get
inside, but you can enjoy a great riverside view from Westminster Bridge.
On the opposite side of the Thames is the British Airways London Eye,
a 450-foot-high observation wheel. Reserve in advance for the trip up
and over London; otherwise, you may spend at least a half-hour in line
for a ticket and another hour before your scheduled “flight.” You’re not
far from Tate Britain, so if you’re in the mood to look at great English
art, head over to Pimlico. Renting a self-guided audio tour will add to
your enjoyment. Later in the afternoon, explore Piccadilly Circus, the
teeming epicenter of London’s West End. You find great shopping on
Regent Street, Piccadilly, and Jermyn Street (see Chapter 12 for shop-
ping). If you haven’t already reserved a seat for a West End show, you
may want to stop by the half-price ticket booth in Leicester Square to
see what’s available (see Chapter 15 for info on theaters). Have dinner in
Soho before the show (see Chapter 10 for restaurants).
Greet Day Two with a walk through Green Park. You’re on your way to
Buckingham Palace to witness the pageantry of the Changing of the
Guard (check beforehand to make sure that it’s taking place that day).
For details on touring the State Rooms of Buckingham Palace during
August and September, see Chapter 11. Reserve tickets in advance, so
you know your specific entry time; otherwise, you may have to wait in
line for an hour or more to get in. If you’re not touring the palace itself,
visit the Royal Mews. From Buckingham Palace, you can stroll down 
the Mall, through St. James’s Park, passing Clarence House, where the
Queen Mother lived until her death in 2002, and St. James’s Palace, once
the London home of Prince Charles and his two sons, William and Harry.
Trafalgar Square, London’s grandest and certainly most famous plaza,
is your next stop. You can have lunch or tea at the National Gallery’s
restaurant or at Café-in-the-Crypt in St. Martin-in-the-Fields church on
the east side of the square (see Chapter 10 for more on these restau-
rants). Spend your afternoon viewing the treasures of the National
Gallery. Renting one of the self-guided audio tours will help you to home
in on the most important paintings in the collection. After dinner in the
Covent Garden area or on the Thames (see Chapter 11 for cruises), head
to one of the bars, pubs, or clubs that I describe in Chapter 16.
On Day Three, arrive as early as you can at the Tower of London and
immediately join one of the one-hour guided tours led by the Beefeaters.
Later, you can explore the precincts on your own, making certain you
allot enough time to see the Crown Jewels. From the Tower, head over
to nearby St. Paul’s Cathedral, which you can see in about a half-hour.
The British Museum, your next stop, has enough to keep you occupied
for several days; if you want to see only the highlights, allow yourself a
minimum of two hours. Finish off your afternoon in Knightsbridge at
Part IV: Exploring London 
258

Harrods (see Chapter 12), the most famous department store in London,
and perhaps the world. Knightsbridge and adjacent South Kensington
offer innumerable dining options (see Chapter 10).
London in Five Days
This section assumes that you’ve already followed the suggested itiner-
aries (see the preceding section) for your first three days.
Day Four begins at the National Portrait Gallery, where you can find the
likeness of just about every famous British person you’ve ever heard of.
Renting one of the self-guided audio tours is a good idea. From the portrait
gallery, you can easily walk to Covent Garden Market (see Chapter 12).
Scores of interesting shops are in and around the market, and Covent
Garden Piazza, a lively hub filled with restaurants, makes a perfect spot
for lunch. Spend your afternoon strolling in Kensington Gardens and visit-
ing Kensington Palace, once the London home of Princess Diana. Then go
for a traditional English dinner at Rules, London’s oldest restaurant, or
Simpson’s-in-the-Strand (see Chapter 10). Are you up for a play or a con-
cert tonight? If so, check your theater options in Chapter 15.
Day Five begins with a morning at the museum of your choice. Choosing
among the three major South Kensington museums — the Natural
History Museum, the Science Museum, and the Victoria & Albert
Museum — is entirely a matter of taste. If you like modern art, the new
Tate Modern on the South Bank is the place to spend your morning.
(See Chapter 11 for descriptions of all the museums.) In the afternoon,
expand your horizon with a short trip outside the city. Chapter 11 offers
descriptions of the Royal Botanic Gardens at Kew, Hampton Court,
Windsor Palace, Hampstead Heath, and Greenwich. None of these
places is terribly far away; the trips to reach them take anywhere from
20 minutes to an hour. You can be back in London in time for dinner.
London in Seven Days
How time flies! By now, if you follow the suggested itineraries for the last
five days (see the preceding two sections), you’ve seen most of the
major sights in London.
On Day Six, you’re ready for a day trip. Riding in one of Britain’s sleek new
trains is terrific fun. The only problem is that you have to decide where
you want to go. In Chapter 14, I give you the lowdown on five places, each
remarkable in its own way. Do you want to see Shakespeare’s birthplace 
in Stratford-upon-Avon or the famous prehistoric stone circle called
Stonehenge? Do you want to spend a day by the seaside in Brighton or
strolling around ancient Canterbury with its mighty cathedral? Or per-
haps head to Bath to discover its splendid Georgian crescents. You can
reach most of these places in 90 minutes or less.
Chapter 13: Following an Itinerary: Four Great Options 259

Day Seven is your last day in London, and you’ll want it to be special. In
the morning, visit Madame Tussaud’s wax museum or one of the muse-
ums that you haven’t yet seen. Afterward, stroll through Hyde Park and
stop at Apsley House, the London home of the first Duke of Wellington.
This house gives you a glimpse of what life was like inside one of
London’s great private palaces. If it’s Sunday, you may instead want to
visit Spencer House, the family home of the late Princess Diana. (See
Chapter 11 for descriptions of all these attractions.) You can also do
some last-minute shopping, if you prefer. Check out London’s various
shopping neighborhoods in Chapter 12, and then make your way to the
major shopping arteries: Knightsbridge, Oxford Street, Bond Street,
King’s Road in Chelsea, or Regent Street. A traditional afternoon tea at
one of London’s great hotels (see Chapter 10) makes a delightful end to
the afternoon. After that? You’ve booked theater tickets, haven’t you?
London with Kids
So you want to spend five days in London and bring along your kids? No
problem. I have a few suggestions to keep you and your kids excited and
entertained. (For tips on traveling with kids, see Chapter 6.)
Don’t schedule too much on Day One. Exercise helps ward off jet lag.
After sitting in a plane for several hours, the best option may be to take
smaller children to one of London’s great parks, so they can run and let
off steam. Depending on where your hotel is located, your destination
may be Hyde Park, Kensington Gardens, Green Park, St. James’s Park,
or Regent’s Park. If you’re traveling with teens, you may want to intro-
duce them to the city by taking a stroll through London’s four royal
parks, following the Princess Diana Commemorative Walk. (All these
possibilities are described in Chapter 11.)
You can begin more focused sightseeing on Day Two. Consider a guided
bus tour that helps orient everyone and gives you at least a glimpse of
all the major sights (see Chapter 11). Several outfits provide tours on
double-decker buses — always a treat for kids — and one outfit offers a
wonderful road and river trip on amphibious vehicles. After the tour,
make the British Airways London Eye your first stop. Reserve your
ticket beforehand to avoid waiting in a long line. Afterward, cross
Westminster Bridge and stroll over to view the Houses of Parliament
and Big Ben (if you’re lucky, the clock will strike the hour while you’re
in the vicinity). And because it’s close at hand, use this opportunity to
visit Westminster Abbey. Younger children may not get much out of
the place, but you will. Later in the afternoon, take a boat ride down the
Thames to the Tower of London; you can board the boat at Westminster
Pier near the Houses of Parliament. When you’re inside the Tower, hook
up with one of the Beefeater tours. (All the attractions suggested here
are described in Chapter 11.) If you’re with a kid ages 10 to 17, you may
want to have dinner at the Hard Rock Café in Mayfair (see Chapter 10).
Part IV: Exploring London 
260

Begin Day Three at the Natural History Museum in South Kensington,
where the dinosaur exhibit with a ferocious animatronic T. Rex captures
the imaginations of both young and old(er). If your child’s a budding
Einstein, the Science Museum with its many hands-on, interactive exhibits
may be a better choice. Afterward, if you have small children in tow, stroll
over to Kensington Gardens for a look at the famous statue of Peter
Pan. The new Princess Diana Memorial Playground in the northwest
corner of Kensington Gardens enchants little ones. You can have lunch
in The Orangery of adjacent Kensington Palace (see Chapter 11) or make
your way to Café-in-the-Crypt (see Chapter 10) in St. Martin-in-the-Fields
church in Trafalgar Square; you find a brass-rubbing center in the church,
too. If you’re with a teen, you may want to spend the morning or afternoon
Chapter 13: Following an Itinerary: Four Great Options 261
Organizing your time
You can make the most of your visit to London if you organize your days efficiently and
with common sense. Disorganized travelers waste a lot of time, show up at the
museum on the day it’s closed, and end up in the nether regions of Tooting Bec
because they hopped on the wrong Underground line. Don’t assume that every
museum or site is open every day, all day. Take a moment to look at the details that I
provide for each attraction in Chapter 11. And carry a copy of London A to Z.
An average top sight takes about two hours to visit, after you’re actually inside. Some
(Buckingham Palace and the Royal Mews) take more; others (Westminster Abbey and
St. Paul’s) take less. But other variables enter in: whether you’re taking a guided tour
(usually about an hour to an hour and a half, no matter where), whether you have kids
in tow, or whether lines move slowly due to the crowds of visitors. Predicting how
much time you’ll spend at a major attraction, such as the British Museum and the
National Gallery, is difficult. But as a general rule, you can do about three or four sights
in a day if you’re pushing yourself, fewer if you’re not.
Many of London’s major sights are concentrated in specific areas, so walking is the
best way to see several sights in a short period of time. To cover larger areas, I rec-
ommend that you take the fast and convenient Underground.
Try to hit the very top sights on your list early in the day, preferably when they open,
or late in the afternoon. Visit the places that are really important to you when you’re
feeling fresh and when they’re less crowded. I mean, in particular, Buckingham Palace
(when it’s open to the public during Aug and Sept), the Tower of London, Westminster
Abbey, and Madame Tussaud’s. Westminster Abbey, to cite just one example, can
receive upwards of 15,000 visitors per day!
Unless you have adrenaline to spare, try to unwind a little before you begin your round
of after-dark diversions. You may need some downtime between the end of your sight-
seeing day and the beginning of your evening activities. I suggest that you head back
to your hotel to take a shower or bath, to curl up with a novel or the evening paper for
an hour, or maybe to catch a quick snooze to recharge your batteries. Then it’s back
to those perennially fascinating London streets.

in Madame Tussaud’s wax museum or the London Dungeon; just keep
in mind that young children may find some of the gorier exhibits fright-
ening. In the evening, older kids and teens may also enjoy one of the
West End’s razzmatazz musicals. If dinner and a play for just the grown-
ups sounds good, you can get a babysitter for the little ones (see the
Quick Concierge, at the end of this book, for a reputable service).
Make Day Four a day trip to Brighton on the Sussex coast (see Chap-
ter 14). The quick trip takes less than an hour. After you arrive, you can
visit the Royal Pavilion and take the kids over to Palace Pier, a spot
filled with games and souvenir stands. If the weather’s warm, you can
rent a deck chair and sit on the beach. Brighton is a fun place just to
stroll around, with plenty to keep you and the family entertained.
On Day Five, head out to Hampton Court Palace, another quick train
ride of less than an hour (see Chapter 11). Hampton Court offers much
to explore, so give yourself at least four hours. Small children may not
get much out of the visit, but they’ll probably be intrigued by the staff
wearing period costumes. You can eat on the premises. Save the best
part for last: The famous maze in the gardens brings out the kid in every-
one. Finally, return to London for a good night’s rest before flying out the
next morning.

I
n comparison to the United States, England is a small country. You
can visit countless places on one-day side trips from London.
In Chapter 11, I describe the easiest side trips from London: Kew
Gardens, Hampton Court Palace, Windsor Palace, and Greenwich. In
this chapter, I venture out to some of England’s most popular, impressive,
and famous places: Bath, Brighton, Canterbury, Stratford-upon-Avon, and
Stonehenge. By train, you can get to all these sites in less than two hours
from London (see the “Day Trips from London” map on p. 264).
By Train or by Car: Weighing the Options
Because of England’s small size and easy-access train and road net-
works, this country is a joy to explore.
For all the trips in this chapter, you may want to take the train instead of
renting and driving a car. From London, you can reach Bath, Brighton,
and Canterbury in 90 minutes or less by train. The train trip to Stratford-
upon-Avon or to Salisbury (the closest large town to Stonehenge) takes
about two hours. At each of these places, the attractions are within
walking distance of the train station. The one exception is Stonehenge,
which you can reach by public bus from Salisbury. If you get an early
start, you can explore any one of these places, have lunch, and still get
back to London in time for dinner.
The following sections help you decide whether train travel or auto-
motion is for you.

Taking the train
If you plan to travel around England by train, get a BritRail pass before
you arrive (they’re not available in the U.K.) from RailEurope (% 877/
272-7245 in the U.S. or 800-361-7245 in Canada; www.raileurope.com).
The London Plus Pass gets you to three of the towns in this chapter —
Brighton, Canterbury, and Salisbury (plus Windsor, which you can read
about in Chapter 11, but not to Bath or Stratford-upon-Avon). Trains
offer first- and standard-class seating — first-class cars are less crowded,
and the seats are roomier and more comfy. Because the train trips to the
destinations in this chapter aren’t very long, standard-class may be fine
for most travelers. For 2 days of travel in an 8-day period, the pass costs
$91 first class, $69 standard class; for 4 days in an 8-day period, it costs
$169 first class, $129 standard class; and for 7 days of travel in a 15-day
period, it costs $225 first class, $169 standard class. See RailEurope’s Web
site for more information on the London Plus and other BritRail passes.
Taking a car: Driving on the left, passing on the right
I always suggest that people visiting London travel by train instead of
driving. Much of your car trip will be on motorways without much
scenery, so what’s the point? Then, when you arrive, you have to find
parking (generally outside the historic city center); if you arrive by train,
however, you can easily walk to the center of town from the train station
(or take a cab if you have mobility issues). The historic towns of England
aren’t laid out like American cities or suburbs, where you need a car to
get from point A to point B.
Before you even consider renting a car, ask yourself whether you’re com-
fortable driving with a steering wheel on the right-hand side of the vehi-
cle while shifting with your left hand (you can get an automatic, but it
costs considerably more). Remember: You must drive on the left and
pass on the right.
Although the car-rental market in Britain is highly competitive, renting a
car here costs more than in the United States — unless you can find a
special promotional offer from an airline or a car-rental agency. Most
U.K. car-rental agencies accept U.S. driver’s licenses. In most cases, you
must be 23 years old (21 in some instances), no older than 70, and have
had your U.S. license for more than a year.
You can often get a discount on car-rental rates if you reserve 48 hours
in advance through the toll-free reservations offices. Weekly rentals are
almost always less expensive than daily rates. And the rate, of course,
depends on the size of the vehicle.
When you make your reservation, ask whether the quoted price includes
the 17.5 percent VAT and unlimited mileage. Then find out whether per-
sonal accident insurance (PAI), collision-damage waiver (CDW), and any
Chapter 14: Going Beyond London: Five Great Day Trips 265

other insurance options are included. If they aren’t a part of the deal,
which they usually aren’t, be sure to ask how much they cost. When you
drive in any foreign country (or anywhere, for that matter), arrange for
as much coverage as possible.
Some credit-card companies offer the collision-damage waiver and other
types of insurance for free if you use that card to pay for the rental. If
you’re planning to rent a car, check with your credit-card company to see
what’s covered, or you may end up paying for coverage you already have.
Bath: Hot Mineral Springs and 
Cool Georgian Magnificence
Bath, 115 miles west of London, is a beautiful spa town on the Avon River
(see the “Bath” map on p. 267). Since the days of the ancient Celts — and
later the Romans — Bath has been famous for its hot mineral springs. In
1702, Queen Anne frequented the soothing, sulfurous waters and trans-
formed Bath into a spa for the elite. Aristocrats, socialites, social climbers,
and flamboyant dandies, such as Beau Nash, have added to the spa’s fash-
ionable and fascinating history. The great author Jane Austen used Bath
as an upwardly genteel setting for her class-conscious plots.
Today, the spa is a grand legacy from the Georgian era, boasting beautiful
curving crescents (a row of houses built in a long curving line) and classi-
cally inspired buildings of honey-colored stone. Must-sees are the Roman
Baths Museum and adjoining Pump Room (where visitors can continue
the long tradition of sipping water while listening to music), the adjacent
Abbey, and the Assembly Rooms (once used for balls and gaming).
Getting there
Trains for Bath leave from London’s Paddington Station every hour; the
trip takes about 90 minutes. The standard return (round-trip) fare costs
£35 ($65). By car, take the M4 to Junction 18 and then drive a few miles
south on A46.
Finding information and taking a tour
Bath’s Tourist Information Centre (% 01225/477-761; www.visitbath.
co.uk), located in the center of town on the square in front of Bath Abbey,
is open Monday through Saturday 9:30 a.m. to 5 p.m. and Sunday 10 a.m.
to 4 p.m. The Centre provides free guided walks that leave from outside
the Pump Room Sunday through Friday at 10:30 a.m. and 2 p.m. and
Saturday at 10:30 a.m. Additional walks are offered at 7 p.m. on Tuesday,
Friday, and Saturday from May through September.

One-hour, open-top bus tours with live guides and plenty of commen-
tary are presented by City Tour (% 07721/559-686). The tour costs
£6.50 ($12) for adults, £4.50 ($8.35) for seniors and students. City
Sightseeing (% 01871/666-0000) offers basically the same tour, but
with audio commentary, at a cost of £9 ($17) for adults, £6.50 ($12) for
seniors and students, and £4.50 ($8.35) for children. Tours for both com-
panies depart from the bus station every 15 minutes in summer; other-
wise, they leave hourly. Tickets are valid all day, and you can get off and
on to explore places along the route.
Seeing the sights
The Romans — who arrived in A.D. 75 — built the huge bath-and-temple
complex at the center of the Roman Baths Museum (% 01225/477-785)
beside Bath Abbey. When visitors enter, they receive a portable self-
guided audio tour keyed to everything on display, including the original
Roman baths and heating system; the audio tour is fun, informative, and
very well done. Admission costs £9.50 ($18) for adults, with discounts
for seniors, students, children, and families. The museum is open daily
March through June, September, and October 9:30 a.m. to 5 p.m.; July
and August 9 a.m. to 9 p.m.; January through February and November
through December 9:30 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. (See map p. 267.)
Overlooking the Roman baths is the late-18th-century Pump Room 
(% 01225/477-7785), where the fashionable assembled to sip the vile-
tasting but reputedly health-promoting water. You’re welcome to taste it
for yourself (your ticket to the Roman Baths Museum entitles you to one
free glass of mineral water in the Pump Room). Admission is free. In the
Pump Room, you can enjoy elevenses (morning tea), lunch, or afternoon
tea to a background of live music. Main courses cost £9 to £12 ($17–$22);
afternoon tea goes for £7 to £9 ($13–$17). The Pump Room is open
Monday through Saturday 9:30 a.m. to 4:40 p.m. and Sunday 10:30 a.m. to
4:30 p.m. (See map p. 267.)
Step inside Bath Abbey (% 01225/422-462) and view the graceful fan
vaulting, the great East Window, and the ironically simple memorial to
Beau Nash, the most flamboyant of the dandies who frequented Bath in
its heyday. Admission is by a suggested donation of £2.50 ($4.65). April
through October, the abbey is open Monday through Saturday 9 a.m. to
6 p.m. (to 4:30 p.m. Nov–Mar); year-round, it’s open Sunday 1 to 2:30
p.m. and 4:30 to 5:30 p.m. (See map p. 267.)
Another classic building worth visiting is the Assembly Rooms (Bennett
Street; % 01225/477-789), the site of all the grand balls and social climb-
ing in 18th-century Bath. Entrance is free unless you want to visit the
excellent Museum of Costume that’s part of the complex. Admission for
the museum costs £6.25 ($12) adults; £5.25 ($9.70) seniors, students, and
children 6 to 18. The museum is open daily 10 a.m. to 5 p.m.; the Assembly
Rooms are open when not in use. (See map p. 267.)

Bath’s newest attraction, the Jane Austen Centre (40 Gay St.; % 01225/
443-000), is located in a Georgian townhouse on an elegant street where
Austen once lived. Exhibits and a video convey a sense of what life in
Bath was like during the Regency period; all in all, though, this museum
is a bit of a bore to all but the most avid Austen fans. Admission costs
£5.95 ($11). The center is open daily 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. (Sun from 10:30 a.m.).
(See map p. 267.)
Bath is a wonderful walking town, filled with beautiful squares and
sweeping residential crescents. Stroll along the North Parade and the
South Parade, Queen Square, and The Circus and be sure to have a
look at the Royal Crescent, a magnificent curving row of 30 townhouses
designed in 1767 by John Wood the Younger. Regarded as the epitome of
England’s Palladian style (a classical style incorporating elements from
ancient Greek and Roman buildings), the Royal Crescent is now desig-
nated a UNESCO World Heritage site. No. 1 Royal Crescent (% 01225/
428-126) is a gorgeously restored 18th-century house with period furnish-
ings. Admission costs £4 ($7.40). The house is open mid-February through
October, Tuesday through Sunday 10:30 a.m. to 5 p.m. (to 4 p.m. in Nov).
Pulteney Bridge, built in 1770, spans the River Avon a few blocks south
of the Assembly Rooms. The bridge is one of the few in Europe lined
with shops and restaurants.
Dining locally
A popular French eatery in Bath’s city center is No. 5 Bistro (5 Argyle
St.; % 01225/444-499). The chef at this pleasant, smoke-free restaurant
produces mouth-watering dishes that may include choices such as baked
ricotta with olive, spinach, and sun-dried tomato soufflé; Provençal fish
soup; char-grilled loin of lamb; or vegetarian dishes, such as roasted
stuffed peppers and vegetable gratin. Main courses cost £14 to £16
($26–$30). The bistro is open daily noon to 2:30 p.m. and 6:30 to 10:30
p.m. The bistro accepts American Express, MasterCard, and Visa. (See
the “Bath” map on p. 267.)
Spending the night
If you want to spend the night in Bath, try the Kennard Hotel
(11 Henrietta St.; % 01225/310-472; Fax: 01225/460-054; www.kennard.
co.uk). On the east side of Pulteney Bridge, within walking distance of
everything in Bath, this elegant hotel with 13 guest rooms occupies a
beautifully restored 1794 Georgian townhouse. The rates cost £98 to
£118 ($181–$218) for a double, breakfast included. The hotel accepts
American Express, MasterCard, and Visa. (See map p. 267.)

Brighton: Fun beside the Seaside
On the Sussex coast, a mere 50 miles south of London, Brighton is
England’s most famous, and probably most popular, seaside town (see
the “Brighton” map on p. 271). Brighton was a small fishing village until
the Prince Regent, who would become George IV, became enamored
with the place and had the incredible Royal Pavilion built. Where royalty
moves, fashion follows, and Brighton eventually became one of Europe’s
most fashionable towns. The lovely Georgian terraces that you see
everywhere date from this period. Later in the 19th century, when
breathing sea air was prescribed as a cure-all for everything from
depression to tuberculosis, the Victorians descended in hordes. Today,
Brighton is a commuter suburb of London and a popular place for con-
ventions and romantic weekend getaways. Gays and lesbians are very
much a part of the local and visitor scene.
Brighton is a compact town, and the easiest way to get around is on foot.
Forget about that frantic need for sightseeing and relax. Relaxation is
what Brighton is all about. This place is for leisurely strolling, either in
the town or along the seaside promenades. The town is small enough 
so you won’t get lost and large enough to offer some good cultural 
diversions.
Getting there
More than 40 trains a day leave from London’s Victoria Station for
Brighton. The trip takes about an hour. If you travel off-peak (after 9:30
a.m.), a cheap day-return (round-trip) ticket costs £17 ($31). If you’re driv-
ing, the M23 from central London leads to Brighton. The drive typically
takes about an hour, but if roads are clogged, it may take twice as long.
Finding information
Brighton’s Visitor Information Centre (10 Bartholomew Square; % 0906/
711-2255; www.visitbrighton.com) opposite the town hall, about a ten-
minute walk south from the train station. The center is a good place to
pick up info on current events and a Gay Information Sheet listing gay
guesthouses, pubs, and clubs. If you fall in love with Brighton and decide
to stay overnight, you can reserve a room here. The center is open
Monday through Friday 9 a.m. to 5 p.m., Saturday 10 a.m. to 5 p.m., and
Sundays during summer from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. (See map p. 271.)
Seeing the sights
Brighton’s one must-see attraction is the Royal Pavilion (% 01273/
290-900), set in a small landscaped park bounded by North Street, Church
Street, Olde Steine, and New Road. The pavilion is one of the most extraor-
dinary palaces in Europe. John Nash redesigned the original farmhouse
and villa on this site for George IV (when the king was still Prince Regent),
who lived here with his mistress, Lady Conyngham, until 1827.

The exterior, as crazily wonderful as anything King Ludwig of Bavaria
dreamed up, is an Indian fantasy of turrets and minarets. The interior,
decorated in a Chinese style, is fantastically extravagant. The king’s
brother, William IV, and Queen Victoria later used the pavilion. Admission
costs £6.10 ($11) adults, £4.30 ($7.95) seniors and students, £3.60 ($6.65)
children under 16, and £16 ($30) for families (two adults and up to four
children). The pavilion is open daily October through May 10 a.m. to 5
p.m. and June through September 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. (See map above.)
Before you leave the pavilion, consider having lunch or a cream tea (tea
and scones served with clotted cream and strawberry preserves) in the
restored Queen Adelaide Tea Room (% 01723/292-736), open daily
10:30 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. (to 5 p.m. in summer). Queen Adelaide, who used
this suite in 1830, didn’t appreciate the epicurean tastes of her husband,
George IV. Dismissing his renowned French chefs, she reverted back to
British cuisine so dreary that Lord Dudley complained “you now get
cold pâté and hot champagne.” The lunch selections and cream teas
range from £6 to £12 ($11–$22).

Close to the Royal Pavilion, on Church Street, you find the small
Brighton Museum & Art Gallery (% 01273/290-900), with some inter-
esting collections of Art Nouveau and Art Deco furniture, glass, and
ceramics, plus a Fashion Gallery. Reopened in 2002 after a major refur-
bishment, it’s a good place to while away an hour. Admission is free, and
it’s open Monday, Tuesday, and Thursday through Saturday from 10 a.m.
to 7 p.m., Sunday 2 to 5 p.m. (See map p. 271.)
The town’s famous amusement area, Palace Pier, jutting out into the sea
just south of the Royal Pavilion, was built in the late 19th century. Today
the pier is rather tacky but worth visiting nonetheless. At night, all lit up
with twinkling lights, this place is almost irresistible. Spend half an hour,
but don’t expect to find much more than junk food, kiddie rides, and
arcade games. The more famous West Pier, now over 130 years old and
gradually sinking into the sea, isn’t open to the public.
Brighton and neighboring Hove stretch out along the English Channel.
The entire seafront is a pebbly public beach used for swimming and sun-
ning. Promenades for strolling are all along the seafront. If you’re into sun-
bathing au naturel, Brighton has the only nude beach in England, about a
mile west of Brighton Pier. You’ll recognize it when you get there.
Dining locally
One of the hippest (and friendliest) places for dining is the bow-fronted
Strand Restaurant (6 East St.; % 01273/747-096), which serves Modern
British cuisine with an emphasis on fish. The ever-changing menu may
include herby homemade vegetable soup, followed by chicken breast
with creamy mushrooms, smoked haddock lasagna, lamb en croute, or
pan-fried filet steak with potatoes. Main courses cost £13 to £18 ($24–$33).
The restaurant is open daily noon to 10 p.m. It accepts American Express,
Diners Club, MasterCard, and Visa. (See map p. 271.)
For a new outlook on vegetarian food, try Terre à Terre (71 Little East
St.; % 01273/729-051). Considered the best vegetarian restaurant in
England, perhaps in all Europe, this place elevates meatless cuisine to an
art form. The food is impeccably fresh and beautifully presented. You
can eat your way through the menu with the Terre à Tapas, a superb
selection of all their best dishes, big enough for two. Main courses cost
£12 to £13 ($22–$24). The restaurant is open Tuesday through Saturday
noon to 10:30 p.m., Sunday 10 a.m. to 10 p.m. (brunch 10 a.m.–1 p.m.).
Reservations are essential on weekends. The restaurant accepts Diners
Club, MasterCard, and Visa. (See map p. 271.)
Spending the night
A sophisticated new addition to Brighton’s hotel scene, the ultrastylish
Hotel du Vin & Bistro (Ship Street; % 01273/718-588; Fax: 01273/718-
599; www.hotelduvin.com) occupies a set of Mock Tudor and Gothic
Revival buildings a stone’s throw from the seafront. This is Brighton’s
Part IV: Exploring London 
272

most unique contemporary hotel, with an impressive three-story lobby,
a signature French bistro, and 37 cool, uncluttered, and very comfort-
able bedrooms featuring marvelous beds with fine Egyptian linens, deep
soaker tubs, and power showers. Rack rates for a double room with
breakfast range from £130 to £230 ($241–$426). The hotel accepts all
major credit cards. (See map p. 271.)
Canterbury: Tales from the Great Cathedral
Magnificent Canterbury Cathedral is one of the glories of England.
Spinning the yarns found in The Canterbury Tales, Chaucer’s pilgrims
made their way here. For nearly 400 years, the devout, in search of mira-
cles, salvation, and a bit of adventure, trekked to the cathedral’s shrine
of Thomas à Becket, Archbishop of Canterbury, who was murdered in
1170 by henchmen of Henry II. (The pilgrims didn’t stop coming until
Henry VIII had the shrine destroyed in 1538.) Modern pilgrims, today
called day-trippers, continue to pour into the Kentish city of Canterbury
on the river Stour, 62 miles east of London (see the “Canterbury” map on
p. 274). They come to see the cathedral, of course, but also to visit the
host of small museums and to enjoy the picturesque town surrounding it.
Getting there
Canterbury has two train stations, Canterbury East and Canterbury West,
and you can easily walk to the city center from either one. From London’s
Victoria Station, trains run about every half-hour to Canterbury East.
Hourly trains from London’s Charing Cross stop at Canterbury West. The
journey takes one and a half hours and costs £18 ($33) for a cheap day-
return (round-trip) ticket. For schedules and information, call % 0845/
484-950. To drive from London, take the A2 and then the M2; Canterbury
is signposted all the way. The city center is closed to cars, but you find
several parking areas close to the cathedral.
Finding information and taking a tour
The Visitors Information Centre (12–13 Sun St.; % 01227/378-100;
www.canterbury.co.uk), opposite Christchurch Gate at the entrance
to the cathedral precincts, is open Easter to October, Monday through
Saturday 9:30 a.m. to 5:30 p.m. and Sunday 10 a.m. to 4 p.m.; the rest of
the year, the center is open Monday through Saturday from 9:30 a.m. to 5
p.m. At the Centre, you can buy tickets for daily guided-tour walks of the
city and cathedral at 2 p.m. (additional walks in July and Aug, Mon–Sat
at 11:30 a.m.). The tour costs £4 ($7.40) adults; £3.25 ($6) seniors, stu-
dents, and children under 12; and £12 ($22) families (two adults and two
children). (See map p. 274.)

Canterbury
Canterbury Historic River Tours (Weavers House, 1 St. Peter’s St.; 
% 07790/534-744) offers half-hour boat trips on the Stour River with a
commentary on the history of the buildings that you pass. April through
September, river conditions permitting, boats depart daily each half-
hour from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. Tickets cost £5 ($9.25) adults, £3.80 ($7.05)
children, and £16 ($30) for families (two adults and two children).
Umbrellas are available in case of rain. The boats leave from behind the
15th-century Weavers House (access via the Weavers restaurant
garden).
Seeing the sights
Make your first stop the imposing Canterbury Cathedral (11 The
Precincts; % 01227/762-862), a magnificent structure that was the first
major expression of the Gothic style in England. The crypt dates from
about 1100, and the cathedral itself (rebuilt after a fire) dates from the
13th century, with a bell tower added in the 15th century.

Although Henry VIII destroyed Becket’s shrine, its site is still marked in
the Trinity Chapel near the high altar. Noteworthy features of the cathe-
dral include a number of panels of rare stained glass and the medieval
royal tombs of Henry IV and Edward the Black Prince. Admission costs
£5 ($9.25) adults; £4 ($7.40) seniors, students, and children. The cathe-
dral is open Monday through Saturday 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. (until 6 p.m. in
summer), and Sunday 12:30 to 2:30 p.m. and 4:30 to 5:30 p.m.; closed to
sightseeing during services. (See map p. 274.)
As you stroll the cathedral grounds, you may encounter flocks of well-
behaved boys and girls wearing blazers and ties: They attend King’s
School, the oldest public school in England, housed in several fine
medieval buildings north of the cathedral.
Off High Street, near the cathedral, is the entertaining exhibition known
as The Canterbury Tales (23 St. Margaret’s St.; % 01227/454-888),
where the pilgrimages of Chaucerian England are recreated in tableaux.
On audio headsets, you can hear five of Chaucer’s Canterbury Tales and
the story of the murder of St. Thomas à Becket. Give yourself 45 minutes
to an hour to see and hear the entire show. Admission costs £6.95 ($13)
adults, £5.95 ($11) seniors and students, £5.25 ($9.70) children 5 to 15.
The attraction is open daily from 10 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. (9:30 a.m. to 5 p.m.
in summer). (See map p. 274.)
Two millennia ago, the conquering Romans were living in Canterbury,
which they called Cantuaria. Their daily lives are chronicled in the small
but fascinating Roman Museum (% 01227/785-575), in the excavated
Roman levels of the city between the cathedral and High Street on
Butchery Lane. Admission costs £2.90 ($5.35) adults; £1.80 ($3.35) sen-
iors, students, and children. The museum is open Monday through
Saturday 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. (also Sunday 1:30 to 5 p.m. from June through
October). (See map p. 274.)
Although the cathedral gets the lion’s share of attention in Canterbury,
another Christian site predates it by about 600 years. Set in a spacious
park, about a ten-minute walk east from the center of town, you find 
the atmospheric ruins of St. Augustine’s Abbey (Longport; % 01227/
767-345), founded in A.D. 598 and one of the oldest Anglo-Saxon monastic
sites in the country. This UNESCO World Heritage site offers interactive
audio tours. Admission costs £3.70 ($6.85) adults, £2.80 ($5.20) seniors
and students, and £1.90 ($3.50) children. The site is open daily April
through September 10 a.m. to 6 p.m., October through March 10 a.m. 
to 4 p.m.
Trek another five minutes east from St. Augustine’s Abbey to visit the
oldest parish church in England. St. Martin’s Church (North Holmes
Road; % 01227/459-482), founded by Queen Bertha (the French wife of
Saxon King Ethelbert), was already in existence when Augustine arrived
from Rome to convert the natives in A.D. 597. Admission is free, and the
church is open daily 9 a.m. to 5 p.m.
Chapter 14: Going Beyond London: Five Great Day Trips 275

Dining locally
One of the best restaurants in Canterbury is Sully’s, located in the
County Hotel (High Street; % 01227/766-266). You can choose from a
selection of traditional English dishes or try one of the more imagina-
tively conceived platters or seasonal specialties. Reservations are rec-
ommended. A fixed-price lunch costs £17 ($31); a fixed-price dinner goes
for £23 to £28 ($43–$52). Sully’s accepts American Express, Diners Club,
MasterCard, and Visa. It’s open daily 12:30 to 2:20 p.m. and 7 to 10 p.m.
Spending the night
If you’re planning an overnight stay in Canterbury and want, like the pil-
grims of yore, to stay near the cathedral, you can’t get any closer than
the Cathedral Gate Hotel (36 Burgate; % 01227/464-381; Fax: 01227/
462-800; www.cathgate.co.uk). Dating from 1438, the 27-room hotel
adjoins Christchurch Gate and overlooks the Buttermarket. The guest
rooms are comfortable and modestly furnished, with sloping floors, mas-
sive oak beams, and winding corridors — what else would you expect
from a hotel built more than 500 years ago? Rates are £52 to £90
($96–$167) for a double, continental breakfast included. The hotel
accepts American Express, Diners Club, MasterCard, and Visa.
Stratford-upon-Avon: In the 
Footsteps of the Bard
Stratford-upon-Avon (see the “Stratford-upon-Avon” map on p. 277) is a
shrine to the world’s greatest playwright, William Shakespeare, who was
born, lived much of his life, and is buried in this market town on the
Avon River, 91 miles northwest of London. In summer, crowds of interna-
tional tourists overrun Stratford, which aggressively hustles its
Shakespeare connection.
Stratford boasts many Elizabethan and Jacobean buildings, but it’s not
really a quaint village anymore. If you’re arriving by train, your first
glimpse will be of a vast parking lot across from the station. Don’t let
this sight put you off. The charms of Stratford haven’t been completely
lost — you find lots of lovely corners as you explore. Besides the literary
pilgrimage sights, the top draw in Stratford is the Royal Shakespeare
Theatre, where Britain’s foremost actors perform.
Getting there
Direct trains leave frequently from London’s Paddington Station; the
journey takes two hours and costs £25 ($46) for a standard-class off-peak
(after 9:30 a.m.) round-trip ticket. Call % 0845/484-950 for information
and schedules. To drive from London, take the M40 toward Oxford and
continue to Stratford-upon-Avon on the A34.

Finding information and taking a tour
Stratford’s Tourist Information Centre (Bridgefoot; % 01789/293-127;
www.shakespeare-country.co.uk) provides information and maps of
the town and its major sites. Easter through October, the center is open
Monday through Saturday 9 a.m. to 6 p.m. and Sunday 11 a.m. to 5 p.m.;
November through February, it’s open Monday through Saturday 9 a.m.
to 5 p.m. and Sunday 10:30 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. (See map p. 277.)
Bus tours of Stratford, provided by City Sightseeing (% 01708/866-000),
leave from outside the tourist office. Open-top, double-decker buses
depart every 15 minutes daily 9:30 a.m. to 5:30 p.m. in summer. You can
take the one-hour ride without stops or get off and on at any or all of the
town’s five Shakespeare properties, including Mary Arden’s House in
Wilmcote (see the following section). The tour ticket is valid all day but
doesn’t include admission into any of the houses. The tours cost £8
($15) adults, £6 ($11) seniors and students, and £3 ($5.55) children
under 12. You can buy your ticket on the bus.
Seeing the sights
You can buy a combination ticket at your first stop that gets you 
into the five sites administered by the Shakespeare Birthplace Trust:
Shakespeare’s Birthplace, Anne Hathaway’s Cottage, New Place/
Nash’s House, Mary Arden’s House, and Hall’s Croft. The ticket costs
£13 ($24) adults, £12 ($22) seniors and students, £6.50 ($12) children,
and £29 ($54) families (two adults and three children).
A logical place to begin your tour is Shakespeare’s Birthplace (Henley
Street; % 01789/204-016), where the Bard, son of a glover and wool
merchant, first saw the light of day on April 23, 1564. You enter through
the modern Shakespeare Centre, where you can spend a few minutes
browsing the exhibits that illustrate his life and times. The house, filled
with Shakespeare memorabilia, is actually two 16th-century half-timbered
houses joined together. His father’s shop was on one side, and the family
residence was on the other. After visiting the bedroom where wee Willie
was (probably) born, the Elizabethan kitchen, and other rooms, you can
walk through the garden. Admission costs £6.70 ($12) adults, £5.50 ($10)
seniors and students, £2.60 ($4.80) children, and £15 ($28) families (two
adults and three children). Shakespeare’s Birthplace is open daily April
through May and September through October 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. (Sun from
10:30 a.m.); June through August 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. (Sun from 9:30 a.m.);
and November through March 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. (Sun from 10:30 a.m.).
It’s closed December 24 to 26. (See map p. 277.)
To visit Anne Hathaway’s Cottage (Cottage Lane, Shottery [about a mile
south of Stratford]; % 01789/292-100), take a bus from Bridge Street or,
better still, walk there along the well-marked country path from Evesham
Place. Anne Hathaway, who came from a family of yeomen farmers, lived in
this lovely thatched cottage before she married 18-year-old Shakespeare (a
May-December marriage in reverse, although Anne was only 25). Many
Part IV: Exploring London 
278

original 16th-century furnishings, including the courting settle (a type of
bench that courting couples often sat on), are preserved inside the house,
which was occupied by Anne’s ancestors until 1892. Before leaving, be
sure to stroll through the beautiful garden and orchard. Admission costs
£5.20 ($9.60) adults, £4 ($7.40) seniors and students, £2 ($3.70) children,
and £12 ($22) families (two adults and three children). The cottage is 
open daily April through May 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. (Sun from 10:30 a.m.); June
through August 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. (Sun from 9:30 a.m.); September through
October from 9:30 a.m. to 5 p.m. (Sun from 10 a.m.); and November
through March from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. (Sun from 10:30 a.m.). The cottage is
closed January 1, Good Friday, and December 24 to 26. (See map p. 277.)
Shakespeare retired in 1610 to New Place (Chapel Street; % 01789/
204-016). By that time, he was a relatively prosperous man whose plays
had been seen by Queen Elizabeth. New Place was a Stratford house that
he’d purchased a few years earlier and where he would die in 1616. The
house was later torn down and, today, only the gardens remain. To reach
the site from his birthplace, walk east on Henley Street and south on
High Street, which becomes Chapel Street. Visitors enter through Nash’s
House, which belonged to Thomas Nash, husband of Shakespeare’s
granddaughter. The house contains 16th-century period rooms and an
exhibit illustrating the history of Stratford. Adjoining the house is a knot
garden landscaped in an Elizabethan style. Admission costs £3.50 ($6.50)
adults, £3 ($5.55) seniors and students, £1.70 ($3.15) children, and £9 ($17)
families (two adults and three children). Hours are daily April through May
and September through October 11 a.m. to 5 p.m.; June through August
9:30 a.m. to 5 p.m. (Sun from 10 a.m.); and November through March 
11 a.m. to 4 p.m. (See map p. 277.)
Shakespeare’s daughter, Susanna, probably lived with her husband, Dr.
John Hall, in Hall’s Croft (Old Town; % 01789/292-107), a magnificent
Tudor house with a walled garden. From New Place, continue south on
Chapel and Church streets and turn east on Old Town to reach Hall’s
Croft. The house is furnished in the style of a middle-class 17th-century
home. On view are exhibits illustrating the theory and practice of medi-
cine in Dr. Hall’s time. Hours and admission are the same as for Nash’s
House (see the preceding paragraph).
Shakespeare died on his birthday, at age 52, and was buried in Holy Trinity
Church (Old Town; % 01789/266-316), a beautiful parish church beside
the Avon River. His wife, Anne, his daughter Susanna, and Susanna’s hus-
band, John Hall, lie beside him in front of the altar. A bust of the immor-
tal Bard looks down upon the gravesite. I find it a bit odd that the inscrip-
tion on the tomb of the man who wrote some of the world’s most endur-
ing lines is little more than doggerel, ending with “and curst be he who
moves my bones.” Obviously William Shakespeare didn’t want to leave
Stratford — ever. Admission to the church is free, but a small donation is
requested to see Shakespeare’s tomb. March through October, you can
visit the church Monday through Saturday 8:30 a.m. to 6 p.m. (to 4 p.m.
the rest of the year); year-round, the church is open Sunday 2 to 5 p.m.
Chapter 14: Going Beyond London: Five Great Day Trips 279

About 31⁄2 miles north of Stratford on the A34 (Birmingham) road is 
Mary Arden’s House & Shakespeare Countryside Museum (Wilmcote;
% 01789/204-016), the last of the five Shakespeare shrines. For more
than 200 years, Palmers Farm, a Tudor farmstead with an old stone
dovecote and outbuildings, was identified as the girlhood home of Mary
Arden, Shakespeare’s mother. Recent evidence revealed, however, that
Mary Arden actually lived in the house next door, at Glebe Farm. In 2000,
the house at Glebe Farm was officially re-designated as the Mary Arden
House. Dating from 1514, the house contains country furniture and domes-
tic utensils; in the barns, stable, cowshed, and farmyard, you find an exten-
sive collection of farming implements illustrating life and work in the local
countryside from Shakespeare’s time to the present. Admission costs £5.70
($11) adults, £5 ($9.25) seniors and students, £2.50 ($4.65) children, and
£14 ($26) families (two adults and three children). Hours are November
through March and September through October 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. (Sun
from 10:30 a.m.); April through May 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. (Sun from 10:30 a.m.);
and June through August 9:30 a.m. to 5 p.m. (Sun from 10 a.m.).
Seeing a play at the Royal Shakespeare Theatre
The Royal Shakespeare Theatre (Waterside; % 01789/295-623;
www.rsc.org.uk) is the home of the Royal Shakespeare Company,
which typically stages five Shakespeare plays during a season, running
from November through September (for current offerings, and to book
tickets online, visit its Web site). A few tickets are always held for sale on
the day of a performance, but if you wait until you arrive in Stratford,
you may not be able to get a good seat. The box office is open Monday
through Saturday 9:30 a.m. to 8 p.m. but closes at 6 p.m. on days when
no performances are on the schedule. Tickets cost £8 to £46 ($15–$85).
(See map p. 277.)
Stratford’s newest attraction, Shakespearience (Waterside Theatre,
Waterside; % 01789/290-111), presents the life and works of Shakespeare
in a unique way, using show technology and special effects. The show
includes information about the Bard of Stratford and dramatic highlights
from nine of his best-loved plays. Tickets cost £7.25 ($13) adults; £6.25
($12) seniors, students, and children under 12; and £23 ($43) families
(two adults and two children).
Dining locally
If you want to have lunch or afternoon tea in enjoyably old-fashioned sur-
roundings, try Hathaway Tea Rooms & Bakery (19 High St.; % 01789/
292-404). The tea rooms are on the second floor of a building that dates
from 1610. Cream tea comes with homemade fruit scones, clotted cream,
and jam, and high tea includes a variety of sandwiches. You can also get
an English breakfast and light meals throughout the day. Main courses
run from £5.50 to £7.50 ($10–$14); cream teas cost £4.50 ($8.35); and
high teas cost £6.20 ($11). This place doesn’t accept credit cards. The
tea rooms are open daily 9 a.m. to 5:30 p.m. (See map p. 277.)
Part IV: Exploring London 
280

The Oppo (13 Sheep St.; % 01789/269-980), housed in a 16th-century
building in the heart of Stratford, offers a historic setting and a mix of
traditional and Modern British cuisine. Reservations are recommended.
Main courses run from £9 to £17 ($17–$31). The restaurant accepts
MasterCard and Visa, and it’s open daily noon to 2 p.m. and 5 to 11 p.m.
Spending the night
During the long theater season, reserve in advance if you’re plan-
ning to sleep, perchance to dream, in Stratford. However, the Tourist
Information Centre (Bridgefoot; % 01789/293-127) can help you find
accommodations.
The Shakespeare (Chapel Street; % 0870/400-8182; Fax: 01789/415-411;
www.macdonaldhotels.co.uk) successfully blends old and new. Parts
of this centrally located hotel date from 1635 and preserve the original
Tudor-era beams and stone floor, but all 76 rooms were completely
refurbished in 2005 in a comfortably elegant and traditional style. The
rooms come with a host of modern amenities, and all the bathrooms
have bathtubs with showers. Rack rates for a double with English break-
fast range from £138 to £158 ($255–$292). The hotel accepts all major
credit cards. (See map p. 277.)
The Payton (6 St. John St.; %/Fax 01789/266-442; www.payton.co.uk),
a Georgian-era townhouse B&B, is located on a quiet side street that’s
just a three-minute walk from the town center. The five en-suite guest
rooms are stylish, comfortable, and charming. A double room with
English breakfast costs £68 ($126). The Payton accepts MasterCard and
Visa. (See map p. 277.)
Salisbury and Stonehenge: Gothic Splendor
and Prehistoric Mysteries
The tall, slender spire of Salisbury Cathedral rises up from the plains of
Wiltshire like a finger pointing toward the heavens. Salisbury (see the
“Salisbury” map on p. 282), or New Sarum as it was once called, lies in
the valley of the Avon River, 90 miles southwest of London. Filled with
Tudor inns and tearooms and dominated by its beautiful cathedral, this
old market town is often overlooked by visitors eager to see Stonehenge,
about 9 miles away.
Getting there
From London’s Waterloo Station, trains run hourly to Salisbury; the jour-
ney takes about one and a half hours and costs £24 ($44) for an off-peak
(after 9:30 a.m.) round-trip ticket. For information and schedules, call 
% 0845/484950. If you’re driving from London, head west on the M3 to
the end of the run, continuing the rest of the way on the A30.

Finding information
Salisbury’s Tourist Information Centre is on Fish Row (% 01722/
334-956; www.visitsalisbury.com) and is open Monday through
Saturday 9:30 a.m. to 5:30 p.m. (also Sun May–Sept 10:30 a.m.–4:30 p.m.).
(See map above.)
Seeing the sights
Visitors eager to see Stonehenge often overlook the lovely old market
town of Salisbury, but I suggest that you try to spend a bit of time wan-
dering through Salisbury Cathedral.
Salisbury
Despite an ill-conceived renovation in the 18th century, the Salisbury
Cathedral’s (The Close; % 01722/555-120) 13th-century structure remains
the best example in England of Early English and Perpendicular Gothic
style. The 404-foot spire is the tallest in the country. The beautiful 

13th-century, octagonal chapter house possesses one of the four surviv-
ing original texts of the Magna Carta. Adding to the serene beauty of the
cathedral are the cloisters and an exceptionally large close, comprising
about 75 buildings. The suggested donation for admission is £4 ($7.40)
for adults, £3.50 ($6.50) for children, and £8.50 ($16) for families. The
cathedral opens daily September through May at 7:15 a.m. and closes 
at 6:15 p.m., and June through August, it closes at 7:15 p.m. (See map 
p. 282.)
Wilton House (% 01722/746-720), in the town of Wilton, 3 miles west 
of Salisbury on the A30, is one of England’s great country estates. The
home of the earls of Pembroke, the house is noted for its 17th-century
staterooms by the celebrated architect Inigo Jones. Shakespeare’s
troupe is believed to have entertained here. Several centuries later in
this house, General Eisenhower and his advisers made preparations for
the D-Day landings at Normandy. Beautifully maintained furnishings and
paintings by Brueghel, Reynolds, Rubens, and Van Dyck fill the house.
You can visit a reconstructed Tudor kitchen and Victorian laundry, plus
the “Wareham Bears,” a collection of some 200 miniature dressed teddy
bears. The 21-acre grounds include rose and water gardens, riverside
and woodland walks, and a huge adventure playground for children.
Admission costs £9.75 ($18) adults, £8 ($15) seniors, £5.50 ($10) children
5 to 15, and £24 ($44) families (two adults and two children). Mid-April
through October, the house and grounds are open Tuesday through
Sunday 10:30 a.m. to 5:30 p.m. (last admission 4:30 p.m.). The house is
closed July 4 through 6. If you don’t have a car, you can take the bus that
stops on New Canal, a ten-minute walk north of Salisbury train station;
check with the tourist office for schedules.
Stonehenge
About 9 miles north of Salisbury, at the junction of the A303 and the
A344/A360, you find one of the world’s most renowned prehistoric sites
and one of England’s most popular attractions, the prehistoric stone
circle known as Stonehenge (% 01980/624-715). If you’re not driving,
hop on one of the Wilts & Dorset buses that depart from the Salisbury
train station daily between 11 a.m. and 2 p.m.; the trip takes about 40
minutes, and the round-trip fare costs about £5 ($9.25). The crowds can
be overwhelming as the day wears on, so arrive as early as possible.
Stonehenge is a stone circle of megalithic pillars and lintels built on the
flat Salisbury Plain. Experts believe that the site is from 3,500 to 5,000
years old. Many visitors to Stonehenge are disappointed to find that
Stonehenge isn’t as enormous as they envisioned, and is now sur-
rounded by a fence that keeps sightseers 50 feet from the stones. Keep
in mind, however, that many of the stones, which weigh several tons,
were mined and moved from distant quarries in a time before forklifts,
trucks, and dynamite.
Chapter 14: Going Beyond London: Five Great Day Trips 283

Stonehenge was probably a shrine and/or ceremonial gathering place of
some kind. The old belief that Stonehenge was built by the Druids has
been discredited (it’s probably older than the Celtic Druids). A popular
theory is that the site was an astronomical observatory because it’s
aligned to the summer solstice and can accurately predict eclipses based
on the placement of the stones. But in an age when experts think they
know everything, Stonehenge still keeps its tantalizing mysteries to itself.
Admission costs £5.50 ($10) adults, £4.10 ($7.60) seniors and students,
and £2.80 ($5.20) children. The site is open daily from March 16 through
May, and September through October 15 9:30 a.m. to 6 p.m.; June through
August 9 a.m. to 7 p.m.; and October 16 to March 15 9:30 a.m. to 4 p.m.
Dining locally
Looking for simple, healthy, homemade food? Go to Harper’s Restaurant
(7–9 Ox Row, Market Square; % 01722/333-118). You can order from two
menus, one featuring cost-conscious, bistro-style platters and the other
a longer menu with all-vegetarian pasta dishes. Reservations are recom-
mended. Main courses cost £8.50 to £13 ($16–$24), and fixed-price meals
are £7.50 ($14) at lunch and £9 ($17) at dinner. The restaurant accepts
American Express, MasterCard, and Visa. It’s open Monday through
Saturday noon to 2 p.m. and 6:30 to 9:30 p.m. (See map p. 282.)
One Minster Street (1 Minster St.; % 01722/322-024) is the new name
for a creaky-timbered, wonderfully atmospheric, 1320 chophouse and
pub that used to be called the Haunch of Venison. The trendy new menu
at the third-floor restaurant isn’t always successful but does feature
some good dishes, such as cassoulet with wild mushrooms and shank of
pork with foie gras. Main courses go for £7.50 to £15 ($14–$28); a £9.90
($18) fixed-price menu is served from noon to 1 p.m. and 6 to 7 p.m.
Food is served daily noon to 2:30 p.m. and 6 to 9:30 p.m. It accepts
American Express, MasterCard, and Visa. Do check out the ancient pub
rooms (still called the Haunch of Venison), even if you don’t dine here;
the pub is open Monday through Saturday 11 a.m. to 11 p.m., Sunday
noon to 10:30 p.m. (See map p. 282.)
Spending the night
A Salisbury landmark since Georgian times, the Macdonald White Hart
Hotel (1 St. John St.; % 01722/327-478; www.macdonaldhotels.co.uk)
was totally renovated in 1995. The hotel offers accommodations in the
older section of the building or in a new motel-like section in the rear. A
good restaurant is on-site. Rates start at £84 ($155) for a double. The hotel
accepts American Express, MasterCard, and Visa. (See map p. 282.)
Atmosphere fills every nook and cranny of the Red Lion Hotel (Milford
Street; % 01722/323-334; www.the-redlion.co.uk), founded more
than 750 years ago. The cozy lounge is a popular spot for tea, and, in
good weather, the vine-covered courtyard is a pleasant place for drinks.
Part IV: Exploring London 
284

Although now part of the Best Western chain, the hotel has maintained
its own venerable identity. Each guest room is uniquely furnished, some
with fireplaces and four-poster beds. Double rooms with breakfast cost
£88 to £109 ($163–$202). The hotel accepts American Express, Diners
Club, MasterCard, and Visa. (See map p. 282.)

Nightlife

In this part . . .
L
ondon, for some people, is synonymous with the perform-
ing arts. Planning a night out here isn’t the problem —
choosing among all the possibilities is where the difﬁculty lies.
In Chapter 15 I give you the scoop on London’s world-class 
performing arts scene, tell you how to ﬁnd out what’s going on
and how to get tickets, and provide information on the main
venues for theater, music — including opera and symphony
concerts — and dance. The performing arts are only part of
London’s pulsing nightlife, so in Chapter 16 I introduce you to
some of the many places where you can rub elbows with
Londoners and have a pint or two — pubs, bars, clubs, discos,
and jazz spots.

In This Chapter
 Getting the inside scoop on London’s theater and performing arts scene
 Going to the symphony, listening to chamber music, and hitting rock 
concerts
 Seeing opera and dance performances
 Finding out what’s on and getting tickets
L
ondon is a mecca of the performing arts, offering world-class the-
ater, a symphony orchestra, rock concerts, operas, modern dance,
and classical ballets. In a city renowned for its theater scene, you can
enjoy every kind of play or musical. Or take your pick from the city’s
own Royal Opera, Royal Ballet, English National Opera, or London
Symphony Orchestra. This chapter gives you the information that you
need to plan your trip to include the performing arts.
Getting the Inside Scoop
In the United States, people think of New York City as the theater and
performing arts capital. But from a global perspective, London may hold
that title, based on the number of offerings and the quality of the per-
formances. Of course, London didn’t attain this stature overnight. The
city has been building its theatrical reputation since the Elizabethan era,
when Shakespeare, Marlowe, and others were staging their plays in a
South Bank theater district. A strong musical tradition has been in place
since the 18th century.
The performing arts scene, in general, helps to give London such a buzz
for residents and visitors alike. Major British stars with international
screen reputations regularly perform in the West End, although you’re
just as likely to see a show starring someone that you’ve never heard
of but who’s well known in England. You can also expect to find a few
American plays and musicals, because the crossover between London
and New York is increasing.

And here’s some good news: Tickets are considerably cheaper here than
in New York. In London theaters, you rarely pay more than £50 ($93) for
the best seats in the house. The price is dramatically less for symphony
concerts, too: £5 to £20 ($9.25–$37) for excellent seats at the Barbican,
for example. The same goes for that priciest of art forms, opera — you
can get special day-of-performance seats for £5 to £20 ($9.25–$37).
Wondering what to wear to the theater? London theater audiences are,
generally speaking, pretty well dressed. There are no hard and fast rules
here, but if you arrive in a sweat suit and running shoes, you’ll be pretty
conspicuous. A “smart casual” approach is best.
Plays and performances in London have varying curtain times. Evening
performances may begin at 7:30, 8, or 8:30 p.m., and matinees at 1:30, 2,
or 2:30 p.m. Check your ticket to be certain, because if you’re late, you
won’t be admitted until the second act or a suitable pause in the action
occurs. If you come laden with packages, you can check them in the 
coatroom. Talking and noisily unwrapping pieces of candy during the
performance will be frowned upon — especially if I’m in the audience.
Finding Out What’s Playing 
and Getting Tickets
For the most comprehensive listings of London performances, buy a
copy of the weekly magazine Time Out, available at London newsstands
on Wednesdays. You can find details for all London shows, concerts, and
other performances in the daily London newspapers: the Daily Telegraph,
the Evening Standard, the Guardian, the Independent, and the Times.
Another good source is the free booklet London Planner, available at the
British & London Visitor Centre (1 Regent St., SW1), or online or by mail
from a VisitBritain travel office (see the Quick Concierge, at the end of
this book, for contact info).
To find out the performance schedule for an entire season, check out the
Web sites that I list for specific opera, symphony, and ballet groups
throughout this chapter.
The Web is one of the best places to search in advance for information

Getting tickets
If you’re in London and decide that you want to see a show, you’ll probably
be able to get a seat. Even if an announcement has been made that a show
is sold out, you can usually buy a ticket from the theater’s box office, most
of which open at 10 a.m. Ticket cancellations occur, and last-minute house
seats go on sale the day of the performance or an hour before.
If you don’t have time to go to the box office and you have a major credit
card handy, call the theater directly. Box-office phone numbers are listed
in the papers and in Time Out. Many London theaters accept telephone
credit-card bookings at regular prices (plus a minimal fee of about
£1.50/$2.80). They’ll hold your tickets at the box office, where you pick
them up any time up to a half-hour before the curtain. By buying directly
from the box office, you don’t have to pay the commission fee (up to 30
percent) that ticket agencies charge.
Buying a ticket in the stalls doesn’t mean that you’ll be seated in the
ladies’ powder room. It means that you may have one of the best seats
in the house. Stalls is the British term for first-floor orchestra. Most of
the West End theaters are fairly old, which means that they may have
boxes for sale as well; these box seats will be on the sides of the second
or third tiers.
Using ticket agencies
Ticket agencies are used for commercial West End plays and musicals,
not for opera, ballet, or other performing arts. All over the West End,
and particularly around Leicester Square, ticket agencies boldly adver-
tise that they have tickets to the sold-out hit shows. Most of these
places are legitimate, but their commission fees vary.
If you choose to use the services of a ticket agency instead of booking
directly with the box office (see the preceding section), I recommend
that you call, stop in, or book online at one of the following trustworthy
agencies:
 Keith Prowse maintains a counter at the Britain & Visitor Center
(1 Regent St., SW1; % 020/7808-3871; www.keithprowse.com;
Tube: Piccadilly Circus). The counter is open Monday through Friday
10:15 a.m. to 6:15 p.m. and Saturday and Sunday 10 a.m. to 4 p.m.
You pay a variable commission on top of the ticket price.
 The Albemarle Booking Agency (74 Mortimer St., W1; % 020/
7637-9041; www.albemarle-london.com; Tube: Oxford Circus or
Goodge Street) is another long-established agency, open Monday
through Friday 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. and Saturday 10 a.m. to 5 p.m.
Albemarle maintains dedicated theater desks at several of London’s
ritzier hotels, including the Savoy, the Park Lane Hilton, the
Dorchester, and Claridge’s (see Chapter 9). Its commission fee of
25 percent on top of the ticket price is what you can expect to pay
for just about any theater booking made through a hotel concierge.
Chapter 15: Applauding the Cultural Scene 291

Before you buy any ticket from any agency, the agent must tell you the
face value of the tickets (you can ask to see them). Before you sign the
charge receipt, be sure to check the seat numbers, the face value of the
tickets, and the agent’s booking fee. If you’re making a telephone book-
ing, the agent must disclose the face value of the tickets, their locations,
and whether you have a restricted view.
Beware of unlicensed ticket agencies that charge far more than the face
value of the ticket plus a very hefty commission fee. A commission fee
should never be more than 30 percent of the regular ticket price.
Reputable ticket agencies belong to the Society of Ticket Agents and
Retailers (STAR) and always advertise this fact.
The Society of London Theatres (% 020/7836-0971) operates a half-
price ticket booth in the clock tower building by the gardens in Leicester
Square (Tube: Leicester Square). The booth has no telephone info line,
so you have to show up in person to see what’s on sale that day. The
booth is open Monday through Saturday noon to 6:30 p.m. and noon to 
2 p.m. for matinees (which may be on Wed, Thurs, Sat, or Sun). Tickets
are sold only on the day of the performance; you can pay with cash or
by MasterCard or Visa. You pay exactly half the price plus a nominal fee
(usually about £3/$5.50). The most popular shows usually won’t be avail-
able, but you may luck out. Tickets for the English National Opera and
other events are sometimes available as well. You may want to stop by,
in any case, to pick up a free copy of The Official London Theatre Guide,
which lists every show with addresses and phone numbers and includes
a map of the West End theater district.
Ticket agencies advertising half-price or reduced-price tickets are
located around Leicester Square. Keep in mind that the Society of
London Theatres operates the only official half-price ticket booth. And
wave away those pesky scalpers who hang out in front of mega-hits.
They may indeed be selling (for an astronomical price) a valid ticket. But
some of these touts, as they’re called, also forge tickets, which means
that you’ll be out of cash and out of a show. By law, any tout must dis-
close the face value of the ticket, so you know exactly what the markup
is. The best advice: Don’t deal with them.
Raising the Curtain on the Performing Arts
London is famous for the scope and excellence of its theater scene, but
this world capital offers visitors a wealth of possibilities for enjoying all
the performing arts.
Theater
Plays and musicals are staged all over the city in approximately 100 
theaters, but the commercial hits are centered in the West End theatre
Part V: Living It Up after Dark: London Nightlife 
292

district — also called Theatreland — concentrated in the area around
Piccadilly Circus, Leicester Square, and Covent Garden. The theaters at
the Barbican and the South Bank Centre (see the following section) also
provide major theater venues. Just like New York, London is the home of
many fringe venues (the equivalent of off- or off-off-Broadway theaters).
London’s theater offerings always include new plays and musicals, long-
run favorites, and revivals of the classics, as well as Shakespeare. Some
of the shows in the West End — such as Agatha Christie’s Mousetrap and
Andrew Lloyd Webber’s Phantom of the Opera — have been running for
years and show no sign of winding down. The newest long-running musi-
cals are Mary Poppins and Billy Elliott, both of which opened in 2005. In
general, evening performances are Monday through Saturday and,
depending on the show, matinees are on Wednesday or Thursday, and
Saturday. Some shows have added Sunday performances, too. Matinees
are a couple of pounds cheaper than evening performances.
In London, theaters don’t hand out play programs free of charge to
every patron. If you want a program, you must buy it. They usually cost
£2.50 to £3 ($4.65–$5.55).
Major stages beyond the West End
I can’t list all the theaters in Theatreland, but I can highlight three stand-
out venues. They’re geographically outside London’s West End, but
they’re still considered part of the West End theater community.
 The Old Vic (The Cut, Waterloo, SE1; % 020/7928-7616; www.
oldvictheatre.com; Tube: Waterloo), on the South Bank near
Waterloo Station, has long been known as “the actors’ theatre.”
Many of England’s greatest performers have played on its stage,
including Laurence Olivier, Maggie Smith, and Judi Dench. Its adjunct
theater, the Young Vic (% 020/7928-6363; www.youngvic.org),
hosts productions of the Royal Shakespeare Company and touring
companies. The box office for both venues is open Monday through
Saturday 10 a.m. to 7 p.m.
 Shakespeare’s Globe Theatre (New Globe Walk, Bankside, SE1; 
% 020/7401-9919; Tube: Cannon Street or London Bridge) is the
newest addition to the South Bank theater scene. The Globe pres-
ents a June-through-September season of the Bard’s plays in a
reconstructed oak-and-thatch, open-air, Elizabethan theater.
(Performances may be cancelled because of rain.) The benches can
be numbing, but the discomfort is worth the opportunity to see
Shakespeare performed not far from the original theater and right
beside the Thames. Check out www.shakespeares-globe.org for
current performances.
 The South Bank Arts Centre (South Bank, SE1; Tube: Waterloo) is
home to the Royal National Theatre (% 020/7452-3000), which
performs in three theaters — the Olivier (1,160 seats), Lyttelton
Chapter 15: Applauding the Cultural Scene 293

(890 seats), and Cottesloe (a smaller theater-in-the-round). The
Royal National performs Shakespeare, but it also offers revivals 
of big Broadway musicals. Tickets cost slightly less than at the
commercial theaters on the other side of the river, generally £10 to
£35 ($19–$65) for evening performances and £9 to £30 ($17–$56) for
matinees. You can get unsold seats at even lower prices two hours
before curtain. The facility also houses cafes, bars, and a good book-
store. The box office is open Monday through Saturday from 10 a.m.
to 8 p.m. For information on performances, call % 020/7452-3400
(Mon–Sat 10 a.m.–11 p.m.). You can find all performances and an
online booking form at www.nt-online.org.
The fringe
In many ways, fringe theater is London’s real theatrical heartbeat. The
fringe, London’s equivalent of New York’s off- or off-off-Broadway, is now
commonly called Off West End. (When my own play, Beardsley, was pro-
duced in London, it was on the fringe.) Groups performing on the fringe
don’t have the big bucks to mount lavish West End productions.
With the overabundance of acting talent in London, the fringe is where
you may see tomorrow’s stars acting today and next season’s hit in its
original, bare-bones form. The plays performed on the fringe are some-
times controversial or experimental, but for true theater lovers, they can
provide a stimulating alternative to the tradition and glamour of the
West End.
The performance spaces for fringe productions are usually smaller than
for West End shows (sometimes tiny, sometimes above a pub), and the
ticket prices are usually much lower (rarely more than £12/$22). Fringe
theaters and spaces adapted to fringe productions are scattered far and
wide, so consult a London A to Z or Time Out, or call the theaters directly
for directions on how to find them.

Royal Shakespeare shake-up
The prestigious Royal Shakespeare Company (% 0870/609-1110; www.rsc.org.uk),
headquartered in Stratford-upon-Avon (see Chapter 14), dropped a theatrical bomb-
shell when it announced in 2002 that it was leaving its long-time London home, the
Barbican Centre, and would mount its London productions in West End theaters. The
RSC now mounts productions in the Gielgud Theatre (Shaftesbury Avenue, W1; 
% 020/7494-5085; Tube: Piccadilly Circus) and the Theatre Royal Haymarket
(Haymarket, SW1; % 0870/901-3356; Tube: Piccadilly Circus).

Outdoor theater
What could be more fun than watching a good play performed under the
stars? The Regent’s Park Open Air Theatre (Inner Circle, Regent’s Park,
NW1; % 020/7486-2431; Tube: Baker Street) has a May-to-August season.
This large venue offers theater seats but no roof, so rain may cancel the
show. You can find the theater on the north side of Queen Mary’s Rose
Garden. Ticket prices range from £10 to £30 ($19–$56); you can check out
the program on the theater’s Web site, www.openairtheatre.org.
Shakespeare’s Globe (see the previous section, “Major stages beyond
the West End”) is another venue that’s open to the heavens.
Opera
Two major opera companies call London home. The Royal Opera enjoys
international prestige, performs operas in the original languages, and
boasts the most famous international singers. Its home is the Royal
Opera House (Covent Garden, WC2E; % 020/7304-4000; Tube: Covent
Garden), which recently reopened after a year-long state-of-the-art refur-
bishment that added two smaller venues — the Linbury Studio Theatre
and the Glore Studio Theatre. Ticket prices for the grand opera run £10
to £150 ($19–$278), but a block of reduced-price tickets go on sale at 10
a.m. on the day of the performance. For a summary of the opera (and
ballet) season, check the Web site www.royalopera.org. If you have
your heart set on seeing an opera at the Royal Opera, book as far ahead
as you possibly can — I’m talking weeks, not days. The season runs
September through July.
The English National Opera (usually referred to as the ENO) offers 
more inventive productions than the Royal Opera. It performs at the
freshly refurbished London Coliseum (St. Martin’s Lane, WC2N; % 020/
7632-8300; Tube: Leicester Square). All the operas are sung in English.
Seats sell for £5 to £70 ($9.25–$130). The opera season runs September
through July. You can see the ENO program and book online by going to
its Web site at www.eno.org.
The following two venues also offer you the opportunity to see opera
during your time in London:
 The D’Oyly Carte Opera Company (% 020/7793-7100): For nearly
130 years, this company has been performing the comic operas of
Gilbert & Sullivan. Venues change, and the schedule is irregular, 
so you may want to check out the company’s Web site, at www.
doylycarte.org.uk, for current information.
 The Holland Park Theatre (Holland Park, W8; % 020/7602-7856;
Tube: Holland Park): London’s most charming stage uses the ruins
of a Jacobean mansion in Holland Park as a backdrop for a mid-
June–August season of opera and ballet. Tickets run £21 to £43
($39–$80). You can view the performance schedule and book tick-
ets online at www.operahollandpark.com.
Chapter 15: Applauding the Cultural Scene 295

Symphony
London offers some of the world’s finest classical and chamber music.
The home base for the London Symphony Orchestra (www.lso.co.uk)
is the Barbican Hall at the Barbican Centre (Silk Street, EC2Y; % 020/
7638-8891; Tube: Barbican), the concert hall portion of a giant perform-
ing arts complex in the City. Seats in this acoustically fabulous hall sell for
£5 to £20 ($9.25–$37). You may also catch a performance by the Royal
Philharmonic Orchestra (www.rpo.co.uk), which plays concerts here
and at the Royal Albert Hall, another all-purpose venue for classical music.
The Royal Albert Hall (Kensington Gore, SW7; % 020/7589-8212; Tube:
High Street Kensington) is an enormous, circular, domed concert hall
that has been a landmark in South Kensington since 1871. The box office
is open daily 9 a.m. to 9 p.m.; ticket prices vary by event.
The South Bank Centre (South Bank, SE1; % 020/7960-4242; Tube:
Waterloo) presents approximately 1,200 classical music and dance 
concerts per year. Performances are held year-round in three separate
auditoriums. The Royal Festival Hall presents symphonic works per-
formed by a variety of orchestras (some British, some international).
The Queen Elizabeth Hall, a smaller venue that offers chamber music
concerts and dance programs, is closed for refurbishment and will
reopen sometime in 2006. The Purcell Room, an intimate setting, is ideal
for recitals. You can get tickets and information on all three venues at
the box office (Level 1, Belvedere Road), open 10 a.m. to 9 p.m., or
online at www.sbc.org.uk; prices vary for each event. For credit-card
bookings, call % 020/7960-4242.
Wigmore Hall (36 Wigmore St., W1; % 020/7935-2141; Tube: Bond
Street) is a beautifully renovated, century-old concert hall used for
chamber-music and solo concerts and recitals. You can find perform-
ance information on the Web at www.wigmore-hall.org.uk.
Part V: Living It Up after Dark: London Nightlife 
296
Summer Proms
From mid-July through mid-September, fans of classical and pops concerts attend the
wildly popular concert series called the Proms. Featuring musicians from all over
Europe, Proms concerts are held at the Royal Albert Hall (see the “Symphony” sec-
tion, earlier in this chapter), where they began in 1895. For Proms concerts, all seats
are removed from the orchestra and gallery levels. Reserved seats are available, but
devotees stand for a close look at the orchestras. Starting in July, you can book seats
through the Royal Albert Hall box office at % 020/7589-8212. To get one of the 1,000
standing-room places (£4/$7.40), you have to queue up on the day of the performance.
You can check out the Proms schedule on the Web at www.bbc.co.uk/proms.

Concerts by candlelight
Evening candlelit concerts of baroque music are performed weekly (usu-
ally on Thurs–Sat nights) at 7:30 p.m. in the lovely church of St. Martin-
in-the-Fields (Trafalgar Square, W1; % 020/7839-8362; Tube: Charing
Cross; see Chapter 11). Lunchtime concerts are usually held on Monday,
Tuesday, and Friday at 1 p.m. Tickets run £6 to £17 ($11–$31).
Music under the stars
Kenwood House (Hampstead Lane, NW3; % 0870/890-0146; Tube: East
Finchley), a picturesque lakeside estate on Hampstead Heath, is the setting
for Kenwood Lakeside Concerts, a series of outdoor concerts held at 
7:30 p.m. on Saturdays in July and August. A free shuttle bus runs between
the East Finchley Tube station and the concert bowl. From Central London,
you need at least 20 minutes to get to the Tube stop and another 15 min-
utes for the ride on the shuttle bus. Tickets cost £15 to £20 ($28–$37). You
can find more information online at www.picnicconcerts.com.
Dance
The Royal Ballet performs at the Royal Opera House, and the English
National Ballet and other visiting companies perform at the London
Coliseum (see the “Opera” section, earlier in this chapter, for details).
Refurbished in 1998, Sadler’s Wells (Rosebery Avenue, Islington EC1R;
% 020/7863-6000; Tube: Angel) is well known for its contemporary
dance, theater, and music productions and as a venue for solo perform-
ers. Sadler’s Wells also manages the Peacock Theatre (Portugal Street,
WC2; % 020/7863-8222; Tube: Covent Garden), a home for dance in 
the West End, and the Lillian Baylis Theatre (Arlington Way, EC1; 
% 020/7713-6000; Tube: Farringdon), a smaller venue for dance and
performance. Programs for all three theaters are listed on the Web at
www.sadlers-wells.com.
The Place Theatre (17 Duke’s Rd., WC1; % 020/7387-0161; www.the
place.org.uk; Tube: Euston) is the main venue for contemporary
dance in the United Kingdom. Riverside Studios (Crisp Road, W6; % 020/
8237-1111; www.riversidestudios.co.uk; Tube: Hammersmith) is an
arts center that showcases theater, cinema, and dance.
Rock concerts
When the rock and pop stars play London, they need a huge arena to
hold their shrieking fans. The two biggest venues are Wembley Stadium
(Empire Way, Wembley, Middlesex; % 020/8902-8833; Tube: Wembley
Park) and the Earl’s Court Exhibition Centre (Warwick Road, SW5; 
% 020/7385-1200; Tube: Earl’s Court).
Chapter 15: Applauding the Cultural Scene 297

A much smaller (by that I mean less than 70,000 seats) rock-and-pop venue
is the Brixton Academy (211 Stockwell Rd., SW9; % 020/7771-3000; Tube:
Brixton).
Another big-event hall is Shepherd’s Bush Empire (Shepherd’s Bush
Green, W12; % 020/7711-3000; Tube: Shepherd’s Bush). And sometimes
the old Royal Albert Hall (see the “Symphony” section, earlier in this
chapter) rocks, too.

298
Dining before or after the performance
Will you eat dinner before or after going to the theater? Many of the restaurants that
I review in Chapter 10 serve pre-theater meals. These places are geared for the the-
ater crowd, so they know your time is limited. Restaurants usually serve their pre-the-
ater menus from 5:30 to 7 p.m. The restaurant limits your choices to a set menu, but you
can be done with your meal and out of the restaurant by 7:30 p.m. or earlier. You find
post-theater menus less often; they go into effect around 9:30 p.m. You can usually find
a good value in pre- and post-theater fixed-price menus.
The following restaurants (all of which you can read more about in Chapter 10) are
close to West End theaters and have pre-theater or post-theater menus:
 The Ivy: 1–5 West St., Soho, WC2; % 020/7836-4751; Tube: Leicester Square
 Joe Allen: 13 Exeter St., Covent Garden, WC2; % 020/7836-0651; Tube: Covent
Garden
 Rules: 35 Maiden Lane, Covent Garden, WC2; % 020/7836-5314; Tube: Covent
Garden
 Simpson’s-in-the-Strand: 100 The Strand (next to the Savoy Hotel), WC2; % 020/
7836-9112; Tube: Charing Cross
Just be certain to book a table beforehand. If you’re dining outside the West End, allot
extra time to order, eat, pay the bill, get your coats, and then hop on the Tube or hail a
taxi to make the curtain.
If you’re not fussy about what you eat and just want to keep your stomach from growl-
ing during the performance, fast-food joints are plentiful in Leicester Square and
Piccadilly Circus. And if you’re going farther afield — to the Barbican or South Bank
Centre — you can ward off impending hunger pangs with a light meal or a sandwich
at one of the cafes or restaurants on the premises.

M
aybe your idea of a perfect evening is going to an elegant hotel
bar for a cocktail or sitting back in a historic pub and quaffing a
pint of ale. In this chapter, I help you find a fun and fitting nightspot. And
if you need music to make you happy, this chapter can point you in the
direction of your kind of beat. For locations, see the “London Clubs,
Pubs, and Bars” map on p. 300.
Enjoying a Pint: London Pubs
A great way to experience real-life London is to do a pub crawl — that is,
walk from pub to pub and sample the different brews. If you’re accus-
tomed to ordering a typical American beer with a rather conventional
name, you may be bowled over by the colorful names and vast assort-
ment of British beers on tap in a pub. You can find Brakspears, Courage
Best, Friary Meux, Ind Coope Burton, Old Speckled Hen, and Wadworths
6X, to name just a few. Although you can get a hard drink at both bars
and pubs, when you’re in a pub you’re better off confining yourself to
beer because pubs don’t generally carry all the ingredients necessary
for a fancy cocktail. Of course, if you find just the right pub, you can
order a pint, get comfortable, and even order a good meal; see Chapter
10 for restaurants that serve pub grub.

Most pubs adhere to strict hours governed by Parliament: Monday
through Saturday 11 a.m. to 11 p.m. and Sunday noon to 10:30 p.m.
Americans take note: In a pub, you never tip the bartender; the best you
can do is offer to buy him or her a drink — a time-honored tradition. Ten
minutes before closing, a bell rings, signaling that it’s time to order your
last round.
A movement is afoot to abolish the strict pub hours throughout the
United Kingdom. The laws restricting pub hours were passed during
World War I so that munitions workers and others involved in the war
effort couldn’t spend too much time drinking at their “local.” The change
requires an Act of Parliament to deregulate pub hours, but the drinkers
who want pubs to remain open till the wee hours have a great deal of
public support.
When you’re in the City, try these pubs (all of which you can see on the
“London Pubs, Clubs, and Bars” map on p. 300):
 Black Friar (174 Queen Victoria St., EC4; % 020/7236-5650; Tube:
Blackfriars) is an Edwardian wonder made of marble and bronze
Art Nouveau. The interior features bas-reliefs of mad monks, a 
low-vaulted mosaic ceiling, and seating carved out of gold marble
recesses.
 Cittie of Yorke (22 High Holborn, WC1; % 020/7242-7670; Tube:
Holborn or Chancery Lane) has the longest bar in Britain and looks
like a great medieval hall — an appropriate appearance because a
pub has existed at this location since 1430.
 Olde Mitre (Ely Place, EC1; % 020/7405-4751; Tube: Chancery
Lane), named after an inn built on this site in 1547, is a small pub
with an eccentric assortment of customers.
 Seven Stars (53 Carey St., WC2; % 020/7242-8521; Tube: Holborn):
This tiny and modest pub has a collection of Toby mugs and law-
related art. You can find the pub at the back of the law courts, so a
lot of barristers drink here — you can pick up some British legal
jargon while having a pint.
When you’re in West London, check out these pubs (which appear on
the “London Pubs, Clubs, and Bars” map on p. 300):
 Churchill Arms (119 Kensington Church St., W8; % 020/7727-4242;
Tube: Notting Hill Gate or High Street Kensington) is loaded with
Churchill memorabilia. The pub hosts an entire week of celebration
leading up to Sir Winston’s birthday on November 30. Visitors are
often welcomed like regulars here, and you’ll find the overall ambi-
ence to be down-to-earth and homey.
 Ladbroke Arms (54 Ladbroke Rd., W11; % 020/7727-6648; Tube:
Holland Park) strays a bit from a traditional pub environment with
Part V: Living It Up after Dark: London Nightlife 
302

its jazz in the background and rotating art prints, but it makes for a
pleasant stop and a good meal. The pub’s changing menu may
include such items as chicken breast stuffed with avocado and
garlic steak in pink peppercorn sauce.
For more information on pubs and British beer, see Chapter 2. If you
want to try a truly historic pub, check out my suggestions in Chapter 19.
Focusing on the Music: The Best 
Jazz and Blues Clubs
Small, smoky jazz clubs are common in London. In Soho, Ronnie Scott’s
(47 Frith St., W1; % 020/7439-0747; Tube: Tottenham Court Road) has
been London’s preeminent jazz club for years, with dependably high-
caliber performances. Bring a full wallet because you have to order food
(meals or snacks) on top of the £15 to £25 ($28–$46) admission. (See
map p. 300.)
In Earl’s Court, the 606 Club (90 Lots Rd., SW10; % 020/7352-5953;
Tube: Earl’s Court or Fulham Broadway) is a basement club where young
British jazz musicians play. You don’t have to pay a cover charge to get
in, but you do have to order food. And to pay the musicians, the estab-
lishment adds to your bill an additional charge of £5 ($9.25) Sunday
through Thursday and about $1 more on Friday and Saturday. You can
find good food and diverse music (Afro-Latin jazz to rap) at the Jazz
Café (5 Parkway, NW1; % 020/7916-6060; Tube: Camden Town).
Admission costs £12 to £18 ($22–$33). (See map p. 300.)
In Soho, try the Pizza Express Jazz Club (10 Dean St., W1; % 020/7439-
8722; Tube: Tottenham Court Road). Big names from the American jazz
scene regularly perform in this intimate venue, and you can enjoy pizza,
too. The club is open daily 7:45 p.m. to midnight, and the admission is
£10 to £20 ($19–$37). In Knightsbridge, you can hear mainstream jazz per-
formed in the basement Jazz Room of Pizza on the Park (11 Knightsbridge,
SW1; % 020/7235-5273; Tube: Hyde Park Corner). The club is open daily

Shaking Your Groove Thing: 
The Best Dance Clubs
London is a large, multicultural city, and its music scene reflects its
diversity. In the London clubs, you can listen to drum ’n’ bass, indie,
Asian underground (or tabla ’n’ bass, as it’s called), chemical beats
(don’t ask), break beats, techno, trance, psychedelic, and many others.
Cover charges vary according to the day of the week and what band is
playing. For more options, check out the music and club listings in Time
Out, a weekly entertainment magazine.

The Hippodrome (at the corner of Cranbourn Street and Charing Cross
Road, WC2; % 020/7437-4311; Tube: Leicester Square) is a cavernous
place with a great sound system and lights to match. This club was a
favorite of Princess Diana during her early club-hopping days; now the

($5.55–$22). (See map p. 300.)
The Hanover Grand (6 Hanover St., W1; % 020/7499-7977; Tube: Oxford
Circus) is funky and down and dirty on Thursday, but otherwise, it’s 
cutting-edge and always crowded. Age and gender are not always easy to
distinguish here. Hours are Monday through Saturday 10 p.m. to 4 a.m.,
and the cover is £10 to £12 ($19–$22). (See map p. 300.)
Housed in a former theater, the Camden Palace (1A Camden High St., NW1;

Unwinding in Elegance: Posh Hotel Bars
Maybe you just want a quiet, romantic spot where you and your signifi-
cant other can enjoy a cocktail and actually talk to one another. Or per-
haps you’re looking for a sophisticated place to enjoy a pre- or post-theater
drink. The following establishments are just the ticket. They’re located in
grand hotels and offer a bit of privacy from the crowds. Jackets and ties are
required for gents at the American Bar; a “smart casual” dress code is in
effect at the others, so leave your jeans and sneakers in the hotel room.
Where’s the bartender who’s known for his special concoctions, the
Savoy Affair and the Prince of Wales, as well as what’s reputedly the best
martini in town? You can find him at the American Bar (in the Savoy
Hotel, The Strand, WC2; % 020/7836-4343; Tube: Charing Cross Road or
Embankment), one of London’s most sophisticated gathering places.
(See map p. 300.)
Bracewells Bar (in the Park Lane Hotel, Piccadilly, W1; % 020/7499-6321;
Tube: Green Park or Hyde Park) is chic and nostalgic, with a plush décor
of Chinese lacquer, comfortable sofas, and soft lighting. (See map p. 300.)
Looking for high ceilings, leather chesterfields, oil paintings, grand win-
dows, and old-world charm? Visit The Library (in the Lanesborough
Hotel, 1 Lanesborough Place, SW1; % 020/7259-5599; Tube: Hyde Park

Corner), one of London’s poshest drinking retreats known for its collec-
tion of ancient cognacs. (See map p. 300.)
At the Lillie Langtry Bar (in the Cadogan Hotel, Sloane Street, SW1; 
% 020/7235-7141; Tube: Sloane Square or Knightsbridge), you can go
back in time to the charm and elegance of the Edwardian era, when Lillie
Langtry, an actress and a society beauty (and a mistress of Edward VII),
lived here. Writer Oscar Wilde — often a guest in Lillie’s home and in this
hotel — is honored on the drinks menu by his favorite libation, the Hock
and Seltzer (see Chapter 9 for a description of the hotel). (See map p. 300.)
Seeking Spots for Night Owls
Except for the die-hards in the all-night discos, Londoners retire to bed
fairly early. Restaurants and bars routinely close before midnight. But a
few places in restless, nightclub-heavy Soho stay open late to accommo-
date night owls (you can see these places on the “London Clubs, Pubs,
and Bars” map on p. 300):
 Atlantic Bar & Grill (20 Glasshouse St., W1; % 020/7734-4888;
Tube: Piccadilly Circus) is open for drinks Monday through
Saturday to 3 a.m. You may have to wait in line for a place to sit.
 Bar Italia (22 Frith St., W1; % 020/7437-4520; Tube: Tottenham
Court Road) is open 24 hours for coffee and serves a limited snack
menu.
 Café Boheme (13–17 Old Compton St., W1; % 020/7734-0623;
Tube: Tottenham Court Road or Leicester Square) offers a chance
to get a drink Monday through Wednesday until 3 a.m., Sunday until
11:30 p.m., and Thursday through Saturday 24 hours.
Stepping Out: Gay Clubs and Discos
Check the gay listings in Time Out for nightclubs that have dedicated 
gay nights.
To be where it’s happenin’, stroll along Old Compton Street in Soho
(Tube: Leicester Square). You may want to duck into Admiral Duncan’s
(54 Old Compton St., W1; % 020/7437-5300) or the two-floor Compton’s
of Soho (53–55 Old Compton St., W1; % 020/7479-7961). Both of these
gay bars/pubs are Soho institutions, open Monday through Saturday
noon to 11 p.m. and Sunday noon to 10:30 p.m. (See map p. 300.)
The city’s largest women-only bar is the bilevel Glass Bar (West Lodge,
Euston Square Gardens, 190 Euston Rd., NW10; % 020/7387-6184; Tube:
Euston). The bar has a “smart casual” dress code and is open Tuesday
through Friday 5 p.m. until “late,” Saturday 6 p.m. until “late,” and
Part V: Living It Up after Dark: London Nightlife 
306

Sunday 2 to 7 p.m.; you can’t get in after 11:30 p.m. Monday through
Saturday. (See map p. 300.)
In terms of size, central location, and continued popularity, the best gay
(and everyone else) disco in London is Heaven (Under the Arches, Craven
Street, WC2; % 020/7930-2020; Tube: Charing Cross or Embankment). 
The place is open Monday and Wednesday 10:30 p.m. to 3 a.m., Friday

100-016; Tube: Tottenham Court Road) is the biggest gay dance venue in
Europe. Hours are Saturday 10:30 p.m. to 5 a.m., and admission is £10
($19). (See map p. 300.)

The Part of Tens

In this part . . .
T
his part contains plenty of suggestions for having more
fun and delving deeper into the fascinating city of
London. You can have a wonderful time in London without
reading a word of this part, or you can use it to enhance your
trip. If you’ve been to London once or twice already and are
now ready to expand your explorations, these chapters can
give you a few super ideas.
I unveil the stories behind ten famous London statues in
Chapter 17. In Chapter 18, I describe ten historic London
churches, and in Chapter 19, you get the goods on ten extra-
special London pubs. In Chapter 20, I introduce you to ten
notable royals.

Famous London Statues
In This Chapter

 Checking out London’s other statues: From Abraham Lincoln to Queen
Boudicca
U
nlike pigeons, people don’t really pay too much attention to stat-
ues of public figures anymore. The whole idea of casting a bronze
of an important public figure just doesn’t fit with the modern worldview.
Who’d qualify for such an honor in this day and age? In London, the only
person today whom may be considered deserving of such a monument
is the late Princess Diana (at least in the general public’s opinion). But
the city is filled with bronze statues commemorating all sorts of individ-
uals from the past. This chapter offers ten (or so) statues that you may
find interesting or that you may run into at some point during your
London stay and think “Who is that?” (For the location of each statue,
see the map “More London Sights,” in Chapter 11.)
Admiral Lord Nelson
In Trafalgar Square (Tube: Charing Cross), perched atop the 145-foot
Nelson’s Column, one of London’s most famous monuments, is a statue of
(you guessed it) Admiral Lord Nelson. Horatio Viscount Nelson defeated
the French and Spanish at the 1805 Battle of Trafalgar and is Britain’s
best-known naval hero. On the column, he’s 17 feet high (and had to be
hoisted up in three sections), but in real life, he was all of 5'4" tall. (Also
in Trafalgar Square, you can see an equestrian statue of George IV, who
considered himself a gentleman but was nobody’s idea of a hero.)
Charles I
In 1633, French sculptor Hubert Le Sueur completed the equestrian
statue of Charles I that stands (or rather sits) at the north end of
Whitehall, just south of Trafalgar Square (Tube: Charing Cross). For no

discernable reason, Royals seem to have elevated egos and think of
themselves as larger than life. So Charlie, who came in at just 5 feet tall,
had the sculptor tack another foot onto his frame. In real life, alas, the
monarch lost whatever symbolic stature the extra foot gave him when
Cromwell chopped off his head in 1649.
However, history has many strange twists and turns: This statue was
sold to a scrap dealer who was supposed to destroy it but instead
shrewdly buried the piece in his garden. In 1660, when the monarchy
was restored and Charles II ascended the throne, the scrap dealer was
able to sell the new king the undamaged statue. The figure didn’t go up
in its present spot on Whitehall — with a pedestal by great architect Sir
Christopher Wren — until 1765.
Duke of York and Edward VII
Just north of St. James’s Park, at the midpoint of Carlton House Terrace
(Tube: Charing Cross), you can find the Duke of York Monument. So
who was the Duke of York (not Prince Andrew), and why did he warrant
this massive 7-ton statue? Those are very good questions, and I’m com-
pletely unable to answer them. He was the second son of George III (who
was on the throne when America gained its independence from Britain),
and when he died, he was massively in debt. Sir Richard Westmacott’s
1834 sculpture, which rests on a column of pink granite, was funded by
withholding a day’s pay from every soldier in the Empire. I ask you, was
that fair? Some wags have speculated that the duke’s statue was placed
high up so his creditors couldn’t reach him.
The monument looms over Waterloo Place, an enclave of aristocratic
elegance and one of London’s greatest examples of urban planning. At
the entrance of Waterloo Place, you find a statue of Edward VII, chiseled
by Sir Bertram Mackennal in 1921 to honor the king who gave his name
to the Edwardian era. The son of Queen Victoria, “Eddie” had to wait
until he was 60 before he could ascend the throne, and he died nine
years later.
But not all is royal in Waterloo Place: You also find a statue dedicated to
the victims of the Crimean War.
Henry VIII
Wouldn’t you say that Henry VIII is England’s best-known king? You may
have “seen” him in plays, movies (such as Anne of the Thousand Days
and A Man for All Seasons), and that great Masterpiece Theatre TV
series, The Six Wives of Henry VIII. Henry VIII was a huge man, with huge
appetites, and he wouldn’t take no for an answer. (He didn’t have to —
he was king.) The much-married monarch has never been considered
anyone’s idea of a role model, so maybe that explains why London has
Part VI: The Part of Tens 
312

only one statue of him. You can see it atop the Henry VIII Gateway on
West Smithfield (Tube: Barbican). In 1702, the stonemasons who built St.
Paul’s Cathedral built the gateway, which commemorates Henry’s giving
of St. Bartholomew Hospital to the City — a gift made possible by his
dissolution of the monasteries.
James II and George Washington
Two notable statues flank the main entrance of the National Gallery,
across from Trafalgar Square (Tube: Charing Cross). On the left, you can
see British sculptor Grinling Gibbons’s fine statue of James II, from 1636,
a year after James ascended the throne. Because he immediately levied
new taxes and sought to restore Catholicism to England, this monarch
never caught on in the public popularity polls. In fact, he was ousted
from the throne and spent the rest of his life in exile in France.
The George Washington statue on the right is a Jean Antoine Houdon
replica of a statue in the capitol building in Richmond, Virginia. A gift from
that state, the statue arrived in London with boxes of earth for the base,
so the first American president would always stand on American soil.
Oliver Cromwell
The small garden in front of the Houses of Parliament (Tube: Westminster)
contains a statue of Oliver Cromwell, Lord Protector of England from
1653 to 1658. This fanatical Puritan led the Parliamentary armies during
the Civil War that dethroned Charles I. Under Cromwell’s “protectorate,”
at least 30,000 Irish men, women, and children were massacred, and vast
tracts of Ireland were handed over to the English. Small wonder that Irish
members of Parliament were outraged when Cromwell’s statue, by Hamo
Thorneycroft, was unveiled in 1899. In fact, Parliament ultimately refused
to pay for it, and Lord Rosebery, the prime minister, shelled out the
money himself. Cromwell, a sword in one hand and a Bible in the other,
appears to be averting his eyes from the bust of Charles I (the king that
he had beheaded — see “Charles I,” earlier in this chapter), which you can
see across the street above the doorway of the St. Margaret’s Westminster
church.
Peter Pan
Children love the famous statue of Peter Pan, north of the Serpentine
Bridge in Kensington Gardens (Tube: High Street Kensington). Commis-
sioned in 1912 by Peter Pan’s creator, J. M. Barrie, the bronze sculpture
by George Frampton marks the spot where Peter Pan touched down in
the gardens. Of course, this kid could fly — he didn’t have to take the
Tube like the rest of us. Peter Pan was an adored fantasy hero long
before he became a psychological “syndrome” for men who refuse to
Chapter 17: Striking a Pose: Ten (Or So) Famous London Statues 313

grow up. He was to children of earlier generations what Harry Potter is
to the kids of today. Maybe someday there’ll be a Harry Potter statue in
Paddington Station.
Prince Albert
Prince Albert of Saxe-Coburg-Gotha (a name that the Royals changed to
Windsor at the onset of World War I) was the handsome German consort
of Queen Victoria. When he died at age 42 in 1861, the grief-stricken
queen donned the black widow’s weeds she wore for the rest of her long
life. London has two statues of Prince Albert. You can find one at the
rejuvenated Albert Memorial in Kensington Gardens (see Chapter 11).
The other stands in the center of Holborn Circus (Tube: Holborn). The
latter has been dubbed “the politest statue in London” because the
prince is raising his hat.
Queen Boudicca
Who, you may wonder, is the wild-haired superwoman in the horse-drawn
chariot at the north end of Westminster Bridge (Tube: Westminster)? She’s
Queen Boudicca (or Boadicea), that’s who, with her fearless warrior-
daughters. “Bo” was a fierce Celtic queen who fought back the invading
Romans and died in A.D. 60. Thomas Hornicraft created the sculpture in
the 1850s; the figure was placed at its current site in 1902.
Winston Churchill and Abraham Lincoln
Parliament Square (Tube: Westminster) boasts more outdoor sculptures
than any other place in London. Unless you’re a student of British his-
tory, most of the bronze gentlemen (Sir Robert Peel, Benjamin Disraeli,
the 14th Earl of Derby, and General Jan Smuts) ranged around the
square won’t mean anything to you.
But you may recognize two of them. Sir Winston Churchill, the prime
minister during World War II (you can find info on the Cabinet War
Rooms, which Churchill used during the war, in Chapter 11), is at his
most bulldoggish in Ivor Roberts-Jones’s 1975 sculpture, standing in the
square’s northeast corner. A statue of Abraham Lincoln, by Augustus
Saint-Gaudens, stands across the street on the west side of the square.
The statue was a gift from the city of Chicago, which has the 1887 origi-
nal in Lincoln Park.

W
estminster Abbey and St. Paul’s Cathedral (both of which you
can read about in Chapter 11) are giant repositories of English
history and get the lion’s share of visitor attention in London. But the
city boasts scores of smaller churches also worth visiting. The area
known as the City of London is especially rich in neoclassical churches
designed by Sir Christopher Wren (1632–1723) after the disastrous Great
Fire of 1666. One of England’s greatest architects, and certainly its most
prolific, Wren designed St. Paul’s.
This chapter explores ten London churches that you may want to check
out on your ramblings around town. (For their locations, see the map
“More London Sights” in Chapter 11.)
Church of St. Bartholomew the Great
On the east side of Smithfield Square, EC1 (Tube: Barbican), you can see
a rare 16th-century gatehouse, and perched atop the gatehouse sits an
even rarer late-16th-century timber-frame house predating the Great Fire.
The gatehouse opens onto the grounds of the Church of St. Bartholomew
the Great, a little-visited gem that just happens to be the oldest parish
church in London. The church was part of an Augustinian priory founded
in 1123. Over the centuries, the building has somewhat miraculously
escaped major damage — despite being used at various times as stables
and a printing office (where Benjamin Franklin worked in 1725). The

15th-century cloisters are to your right as you enter. Inside the church is
a “weeping” 17th-century statue of Edward Cooke (the marble condenses
moisture from the air); the tomb of Rahere, the priory’s founder; and a
lovely oriel (projecting bay) window.
If you leave the churchyard by using the gate in the far-right corner, you
come out on Cloth Fair, a street with gabled houses from 1604. Like St.
Bartholomew’s, they’re among the very few surviving buildings predat-
ing the disastrous Great Fire that leveled much of London in 1666.
Church of St. Stephen Walbrook
Walbrook, EC4 (Tube: Cannon Street), a lane in the heart of the City, was
the site of a brook that was paved over in medieval times. Today, the lane
houses the Church of St. Stephen Walbrook, one of Sir Christopher Wren’s
finest works. By the 18th century, the fame of this church had spread
throughout Europe, and many still consider it the most beautiful church in
London. Its splendid dome served as a model for the one at St. Paul’s
Cathedral. The altar beneath the dome was sculpted from travertine (a
porous mineral) in 1956 by British sculptor Henry Moore, who had reserva-
tions about tackling the job because he was an agnostic. “Henry, I’m not
asking you to take the service,” said the rector who offered Moore the com-
mission. “I understand that you’re a bit of a chiseler; just do your job.”
St. Botolph’s
I think it’s appropriate to include in this chapter a church dedicated to
England’s patron saint of travelers: St. Botolph’s on Aldersgate Street,
EC1 (Tube: Barbican), close to the Museum of London (see Chapter 11).
The church interior has a fine barrel-vaulted roof. Actually, three city
churches are dedicated to St. Botolph, and all are located beside now-
vanished gates into the city. At one time, instead of being greeted by
ATMs and currency-exchange windows, travelers could pause and give
thanks to Botolph for their safe journey to London.
St. Dunstan’s-in-the-West
The octagonal St. Dunstan’s-in-the-West, on Fleet Street, EC4 (Tube:
Temple), is a fine early example of Gothic Revival architecture. That style
was in fashion when an earlier church that survived the Great Fire of 1666
was replaced between 1829 and 1833. The large clock on the tower is
something of a historical curiosity: The clock dates from 1671 and was
installed by the congregation as an offering of thanks because the church
hadn’t burned down. Every 15 minutes, two giant clubs strike a bell that
has been tolling for more than 330 years. People take clocks, watches,
and timepieces for granted nowadays, but this clock was the first in
London to have a double face and to have minutes marked on the dial.

316

St. George the Martyr Church
Also in Southwark, next to the remains of Marshalsea Prison on Borough
High Street, SE1 (Tube: Borough), you can find St. George the Martyr
Church. The church is probably more famous for its literary associa-
tions than for any beauty of the structure itself. This church is where
Dickens’s fictional heroine Little Dorrit is baptized and, at one point, is
forced to spend the night when she’s locked out of the Marshalsea
debtors’ prison; later she’s married in this church. A stained-glass
window in the east wall shows her at prayer.
St. Margaret’s Westminster
St. Margaret’s Westminster, the parish church of the House of Commons
since 1614, is on St. Margaret Street, SW1 (Tube: Westminster), and is
often mistaken for Westminster Abbey next door. St. Margaret’s is notable
for its glorious above-the-altar East Window, the stained glass of which
was presented by Ferdinand and Isabella of Spain to commemorate the
marriage of their daughter, Catharine of Aragon, to Arthur, the son of
Henry VII. By the time the glass arrived, Arthur had died and Henry VIII,
his younger brother, had wed Catherine, the first of his eight wives. (He
divorced her to marry Anne Boleyn.) The weddings of poet John Milton
(1656) and statesman (and future prime minister) Winston Churchill (1908)
were held in this church.
St. Martin-in-the-Fields
St. Martin-in-the-Fields, on Trafalgar Square, WC2 (Tube: Charing Cross),
was a stylistic prototype for hundreds of churches constructed in 18th-
century New England. James Gibbs, who was influenced by the churches
of Sir Christopher Wren, designed the church in 1726. Furniture designer
Thomas Chippendale, painters Sir Joshua Reynolds and William Hogarth,
and Nell Gwynn, mistress of Charles II, are buried within. For details about
the concerts held here, see the description of St. Martin in Chapter 11.
St. Mary-le-Bow
Established in the 11th century, St. Mary-le-Bow, on Bow Lane, EC4 (Tube:
Mansion House), is one of London’s most venerable churches. The struc-
ture that originally stood here was a casualty of the Great Fire of 1666; the
steepled church that you see today is a work by Sir Christopher Wren, who
modeled it after Rome’s Church of the Basilica of Maxentius. According to
tradition, a true Cockney (a native of the East End of London) is someone
born within hearing distance of the bells of St. Mary-le-Bow. In the church-
yard’s garden is a statue of Captain John Smith, a one-time parishioner who
left London to become one of the first settlers of Jamestown, Virginia. (He’s
the one who was saved by Pocahontas.)
Chapter 18: Making Amens: Ten Noteworthy London Churches 317

Southwark Cathedral
Southwark Cathedral, on Montague Close, SE1 (Tube: London Bridge),
is one of the oldest buildings in Southwark and also one of the most
beautiful (see Chapter 11). A church has occupied this site for at least a
thousand years; before that, a Roman villa was located here.
London’s second-oldest church, after Westminster Abbey, Southwark
Cathedral, in the 12th century, was the first Gothic church to be erected
in London. Today, you can see the 15th-century cathedral (with
Victorian restorations) that once served London’s rowdy South Bank
theater district. Chaucer and Shakespeare both worshiped here, and
Shakespeare’s brother Edmund was buried here in 1607.
Besides a memorial to the immortal Bard, the church contains a 13th-
century wooden effigy of a knight, one of the oldest surviving wooden
effigies in England. John Harvard, founder of Harvard University, was
baptized in this church.
Temple of Mithras
Not far from St. Stephen Walbrook (see “Church of St. Stephen Walbrook,”
earlier in this chapter), at the entrance to Temple Court on Queen Victoria
Street (Tube: Mansion House), you can find the remains of what’s proba-
bly London’s oldest church site. This church isn’t a Christian church,
however, but a third-century Roman temple. Unearthed during 1954 exca-
vations and raised to its present level, the Temple of Mithras is shaped
like a tiny Christian basilica with a central nave and two aisles.
The Mithraic cult, which had its origins in Persia and was brought to
London by Roman soldiers in the second century, used this temple. At one
time, when the Roman Empire still ruled the Western world, Mithraism was
as popular as Christianity. Archaeologists speculate that the pagan temple
was destroyed in the fourth century, when Christianity became the official
religion of the Empire. Some of the sculptures that were found in the
temple are displayed in the Museum of London (see Chapter 11).

Ten Historic London Pubs
In This Chapter
 Enjoying some pub history
 Finding a pub with character
P
ublic houses, better known as pubs, have been a way of life in
London and throughout the United Kingdom for centuries. Chapters
2, 10, and 16 offer information about London pubs. But I could write an
entire book just on the pubs of London because the city has hundreds of
them. Not all these pubs are old, of course, and not all have the kind of
character that accumulates over centuries of drinking, talking, smoking,
and eating. But dozens upon dozens of these pubs date back anywhere
from a century to more than 400 years.
This chapter offers descriptions of ten more pubs. Each of these places
has some special story, history, or association attached to it. (For their
locations, see the map “London Clubs, Pubs, and Bars,” in Chapter 16.)
All these pubs are open regular pub hours of Monday through Saturday
11 a.m. to 11:30 p.m.; some are open Sunday noon to 10:30 p.m.
Anchor Inn
Eighteenth-century figures, such as Samuel Johnson, who produced the
first Dictionary of the English Language, playwright Oliver Goldsmith,
whose most famous work is She Stoops to Conquer, and painter Sir
Joshua Reynolds, the first president of the Royal Academy, frequented
the Anchor Inn (Park Street, SE1; % 020/7407-1577; Tube: Southwark).
It has a nice riverside terrace.
Coal Hole
Opened in the early 19th century, the Coal Hole (91 The Strand, WC2; 
% 020/7836-7503; Tube: Covent Garden) got its name from the coal

haulers who unloaded their cargo on the Thames nearby. One of Central
London’s larger pubs, the Coal Hole has many theatrical connections
because of its West End location. Famous mid-19th-century
Shakespearean actor Edmund Kean used to hire rowdies, get them drunk
here, and then send them off to heckle his rivals in other theaters.
George Inn
You can find one of the city’s most historically important pubs in the
George Inn (in George Inn Yard off Borough High Street, SE1; % 020/
7407-2056; Tube: Borough). It’s the last remaining example in London of
an old-style coaching inn, with balconies (called galleries) around the
inner court. The George was doing business during the reign of Henry
VIII, and some claim it actually dates back to Chaucer’s era.
King’s Head and Eight Bells
Chelsea’s intimate, clublike King’s Head and Eight Bells (50 Cheyne
Walk, SW3; % 020/7352-1820; Tube: Sloane Square) opened more than
400 years ago, around 1580. Back then, of course, the area was rural;
Henry VIII’s country house stood nearby. Later, celebrated artists and
writers, such as Dante Gabriel Rossetti, Thomas Carlyle (whose house is
now a museum; see Chapter 11), Oscar Wilde, Laurence Olivier, and
Vivien Leigh made their homes in Chelsea, one of the prettiest (and now
one of the most expensive) parts of London. The neighborhood’s still
filled with literary and other luminaries, so keep your eyes open if you
stop in here. You never know who may pop in.
Lamb and Flag
The Lamb and Flag (33 Rose St., WC2; % 020/7497-9504; Tube: Leicester
Square) was once known by the grisly name “Bucket of Blood” because
prizefighters battered one another into a bloody pulp during matches
held for betting customers. The pub, a rare survivor of the Great Fire of
1666, has a couple of literary associations to offset its unsavory past. In
the 19th century, this place was one of Charles Dickens’s favorite tav-
erns. A couple of centuries earlier, poet John Dryden was attacked and
beaten just outside, probably because of a lampoon that he directed at
the earl of Rochester. Every year on December 16, the pub commemo-
rates the anniversary of the attack with a Dryden Night.
Red Lion Public House
Civil servants and members of Parliament frequent the Red Lion Public
House (48 Parliament St., SW1; % 020/7930-5826; Tube: Westminster).
So many MPs stop in here that the pub rings a special bell before a vote
Part VI: The Part of Tens 
320

is taken, allowing the lawmakers to get back in time. Charles Dickens
stopped in once for a pint of beer — he was 11 years old at the time.
(Life was different back then.)
Salisbury
I’m partial to the Salisbury (90 St. Martin’s Lane, WC2; % 020/7836-5863;
Tube: Leicester Square) because I used to hang out there. The pub sits
right in the heart of the West End theater district, dates from 1852, and
has a beautifully preserved Art Nouveau interior with marble fittings,
cut-glass mirrors, and brass statuettes. Like the Lamb and Flag noted
earlier, the Salisbury was once famous for bare-knuckle prizefights —
but that was long before my time.
Williamson’s Tavern
Williamson’s Tavern (in Groveland Court, off Bow Lane, EC4; % 020/
7248-6280; Tube: St. Paul’s) was the residence of the Lord Mayor of the
City of London before the nearby Mansion House was built. The tavern
stands behind a 17th-century gate presented to the Lord Mayor by
William and Mary. The building later served as an inn. Inside, you can
have a drink and one of its famous steak sandwiches.
Ye Olde Cheshire Cheese
Ye Olde Cheshire Cheese (Wine Office Court, 145 Fleet St., EC4; % 020/
7353-6170; Tube: Blackfriars) was established in 1667, but a tavern stood
on this site as early as 1590 (see Chapter 11). The earlier tavern burned
down in the Great Fire of 1666 and was quickly rebuilt — in fact, Ye Old
Cheshire Cheese was the first pub to reopen after the fire. Downstairs,
you can see charred wooden beams bearing witness to the massive fire
that destroyed a large portion of London. This pub was one of Charles
Dickens’s favorite hangouts, and he usually sat at a table to the right of
the fireplace on the first floor.
Ye Olde Watling
Ye Olde Watling (29 Watling St., EC4; % 020/7248-6252; Tube: Mansion
House) is a 17th-century pub that the great architect Sir Christopher
Wren used as an office when St. Paul’s Cathedral was being constructed.
The pub was built from timber taken from dismantled sailing ships.

Ten Important Royals —
Past and Present
In This Chapter
 Meeting a few notable Royals
 Noting changes in rulers and ruling over two millennia
I
am not a royalist, but the kings and queens of England fascinate me.
These are people whose lives encapsulated ultimate power and
humiliating defeat, people who killed to stay on the throne and were
killed by others who wanted it, people who inspired their subjects and
treated them like dirt, people who sometimes changed the course of his-
tory and sometimes disgraced the nation they ruled.
I had a hard time choosing just ten, but in the thumbnail sketches that
follow, you can get at least a glimpse of how the rulers of England — and
the rule of England — have changed over the past 2,000 years.
Queen Boudicca (A.D. 30?–60): 
Braveheart of the Britons
I’ve always thought Boudicca’s story would make a fantastic film, but
who would play this fierce Celtic queen who painted her face blue and
led 100,000 British troops again the invading Romans in A.D. 60? Angelina
Jolie?
Boudicca’s story harks back to the earliest period of Britain’s recorded
history. Historians think that she was born about A.D. 30. In A.D. 48, she
married Prasutagus, king of the Iceni, and bore him two daughters. The
Iceni were a Celtic tribe that had been made a Roman client-state in A.D.
43. When Prasutagus died, he left his kingdom — as required by Roman
law — to the Roman emperor. But hoping to provide for his two daugh-
ters, he left a portion of his personal estate to them. For the Romans, that
inheritance gave them a perfect excuse to confiscate all of Prasutagus’s
belongings and punish the Iceni for “disobeying” Roman law. Just days

after her husband’s death, Boudicca was tripped and publicly whipped,
her teenaged daughters raped by Roman soldiers.
The outrages committed by the invading foreigners changed Boudicca’s
life forever. As more Roman troops arrived to begin the job of conquering
all the native Britons, Boudicca managed to raise an army among formerly
warring local tribes. The Celts were much feared by the Romans because
Celtic women fought alongside the men, painting their faces blue to
frighten the enemy and uttering terrifying shrieks as they attacked with
swords, axes, and clubs. Boudicca and her army marched to Roman forts
and settlements, laid waste to them, and killed their inhabitants. Finally, at
a site that was probably somewhere in the West Midlands, Boudicca faced
the army of Suetonus Paulinus, the Roman governor of Britannia. She had
more troops, but Suetonius and his legionnaires had the discipline that
helped Rome conquer the Western world. The Celts under Boudicca were
slaughtered. No one knows what happened to Boudicca herself. Some
accounts say that she took poison. The alternative, had she lived, would
have been worse. She would have been paraded in chains at a public tri-
umph in Rome and then publicly tortured in the Coliseum.
Next time you’re crossing Westminster Bridge in London, look up and
you can see a bronze statue of Boudicca on the north side. A mid-19th-
century work by Thomas Hornicraft, it shows a wild-haired superwoman
in a horse-drawn chariot with her two daughters.
Alfred the Great (849–899): 
A Warrior and a Scholar
If you make a trip to Winchester, the capital of the old Anglo-Saxon king-
dom of Wessex, you can see a statue of Alfred the Great on Bridge Street.
Alfred is the only English monarch to carry the title “the Great,” and that
alone makes him an intriguing character. His story goes back to the
ninth century A.D. when the Danes, more commonly known as the
Vikings, were relentlessly attacking and terrorizing England.
Youngest son of King Æthelwulf, Alfred became King of Wessex in 871.
Wessex was an Anglo-Saxon kingdom patched together in southern and
southwestern England after the departure of the Romans in A.D. 410.
Following a series of attacks led by the Dane Guthorm, Alfred finally
defeated the Danes decisively at the Battle of Eddington. As a condition
of the peace treaty, Guthorm withdrew his forces from Wessex and
Alfred recognized Danish control over East Anglia and parts of Mercia.
This partition of England was called the Danelaw, and though the
English kings soon brought the Danelaw back under their rule, they did
not attempt to interfere with the laws and customs of the area, many of
which survived until after the Norman Conquest in 1066.
Part VI: The Part of Tens 
324

Alfred created a series of fortifications to surround his kingdom and 
provide security from invasion. You can still find traces of burh, the
Anglo-Saxon word for these forts, in the common English place-name
suffix –bury. The reign of Alfred was known for more than military suc-
cess, however. He promoted better education and helped make learning
important in an age when education had gone into a decline because of
Danish looting of monasteries and churches, traditional centers of learn-
ing. Alfred was also a codifier of law and a patron of the arts. A warrior
and a scholar, he translated Latin books into the Anglo-Saxon tongue.
With the kind of leadership that he provided, it’s no wonder he was pro-
claimed “the Great.”
William the Conqueror (1028–1087): 
Winner Takes All
The illegitimate son of the Duke of Normandy, William received the
duchy of Normandy upon his father’s death in 1035. He spent the next
several years consolidating his strength on the continent through mar-
riage, diplomacy, war, and savage intimidation. By 1066, Normandy was
in a position of virtual independence from William’s feudal lord, Henry I
of France, and the disputed succession in England offered William an
opportunity for invasion.
When Edward the Confessor died childless, the English crown was
offered to Harold Godwinson (an Anglo-Saxon), even though Edward had
purportedly promised the throne to William, his second cousin. Insisting
that Harold had sworn allegiance to him in 1064, William prepared for
battle. But as the new King Harold anxiously awaited William’s arrival on
England’s south shores, Harold Hardrada, the King of Norway, invaded
England from the north. Harold’s forces marched north to defeat the
Norse at Stamford Bridge on September 25, 1066. Two days after the
battle, William landed unopposed at Pevensey, forcing Harold to move
south to a new battle. What has come to be known as the Battle of
Hastings took place on October 14, 1066. Harold and his brothers died
fighting, thus removing any further organized Anglo-Saxon resistance to
the Normans. The Anglo-Saxon earls and bishops soon submitted and
crowned him William I on Christmas Day 1066.
William’s acquisitive nature never left him. His forces ruthlessly crushed
uprisings until, by 1072, the whole of England was conquered and
united. William confiscated lands and reallocated them to the Normans.
In 1085, William commissioned the Domesday Book to survey land own-
ership, assess property, and establish a tax base. Although he began his
invasion with papal support, William refused to let the church dictate
policy within English and Norman borders. Ruthless and cruel, the
Conqueror exacted a high toll from his subjects, but he also laid the
foundation for the economic and political success of England. Buildings
from his reign include Windsor Castle and the Tower of London (both of
Chapter 20: Ten Important Royals — Past and Present 325

which you can read about in Chapter 11), but you can find perhaps the
most atmospheric reminder of William the Conqueror at Battle, where
you can visit the battlefield that was William’s first conquest in England.
Henry II (1133–1189): Family Plots
Henry II, the first Plantagenet king, was one of the most effective of
England’s monarchs, refining Norman government and creating a self-
standing bureaucracy that could keep the country running even if it had
a weak or incompetent monarch. But Henry’s personal life was one
unending soap opera, with more plots and counterplots than I can 
possibly detail here.
A grandson of Henry I, Henry was raised in the French province of
Anjou. His vast continental possessions more than doubled when he
married Eleanor of Aquitane, the ex-wife of King Louis VII of France.
Eleanor was 11 years older than Henry and was rumored to have slept
with his father. Crowned King of England in October 1154, Henry was
technically a feudal vassal of the king of France but, in reality, owned
more territory and was more powerful than his French lord.
Throughout his reign, Henry instituted reforms meant to weaken tradi-
tional feudal ties and strengthen his position, but in the process of
strengthening the royal courts, he became involved in the murder of his
best friend, Thomas Beckett. The church courts instituted by William
the Conqueror had become a safe haven for criminals, and Henry
wanted to transfer sentencing in such cases to the royal courts. Thomas
Beckett, named Archbishop of Canterbury in 1162, vehemently opposed
the weakening of church courts. He also angered Henry by opposing the
coronation of Henry’s eldest son. When an exasperated Henry publicly
conveyed his desire to be rid of the contentious archbishop, four thug-
gish knights took the king at his word and murdered Beckett in his own
cathedral on December 29, 1170. (You can see the exact spot if you visit
Canterbury Cathedral; see Chapter 14.)
Henry’s plans for dividing his myriad lands and titles evoked treachery
from his sons, who, with the encouragement of their mother, repeatedly
rebelled against their father. Eleanor, equally ruthless and scheming, was
kept a virtual prison for 16 years. Henry died in 1189, two days after his
son Richard, with the assistance of Philip II Augustus of France, attacked
and defeated him, forcing Henry to accept a humiliating peace.
Henry VIII (1491–1547): 
Take My Wife — Please!
The significance of Henry’s reign is generally overshadowed by his six
marriages, a record topped only by Elizabeth Taylor. There is something
Part VI: The Part of Tens 
326

scarily pathological about Henry’s many marriages, even if they were in
pursuit of an elusive male heir.
His first wife was Catherine of Aragon (widow of his brother, Arthur),
whom he married in 1509 and divorced in 1533; the union produced one
daughter, Mary. Henry married the pregnant Anne Boleyn in 1533; she
gave him another daughter, Elizabeth, but was executed in 1536 on
trumped-up charges of infidelity, a treasonous charge in the king’s con-
sort but never for the king. The same month that Anne was beheaded,
the monarch married Jane Seymour, who died giving birth to Henry’s
lone male heir, Edward, in October 1536. After viewing Hans Holbein’s
beautiful portrait of the German princess Anne of Cleves, Henry arranged
a marriage with her early in 1540. When Anne arrived, however, Henry
found her so homely that he never consummated the marriage. In 1540,
with Anne scratched off the list, he married Catherine Howard, who was
executed for infidelity two years later and reputedly haunts Hampton
Court Palace to this day. Catherine Parr became Henry’s sixth and last
wife in 1543, and she provided for the needs of both Henry and his chil-
dren until his death in 1547.
So what did Henry do besides bed and wed? Most notably, he altered
England and the whole of Western Christendom by separating the Church
of England from Roman Catholicism. The separation actually happened
because of Henry’s obsession with producing a male heir. When Catherine
of Aragon failed to produce a male, Henry sought an annulment from the
pope in order to marry Anne Boleyn. When Cardinal Wolsey failed to
secure a legal annulment, Henry summoned the Reformation Parliament,
which passed 137 statutes in seven years, influencing political and ecclesi-
astical affairs in a way previously unknown. By 1536, all ecclesiastical and
government officials were required to publicly approve of the break with
Rome and take an oath of loyalty. Henry’s dissolution of the monasteries
filled royal coffers, as revenues from the sale of monastic lands went
either to the crown or the nobility. The break with Rome, coupled with an
increase in governmental bureaucracy, led to the royal supremacy that
lasted until the execution of Charles I and the establishment of the
Commonwealth a century after Henry’s death.
Elizabeth I (1533–1603): Heart and
Stomach of a King
In contrast to her much-married father, Henry VIII, Elizabeth I never wed
and was known as the Virgin Queen. When she ascended the throne in
1558, dissension between Catholics and Protestants tore at the very
foundation of society, and the royal treasury had been bled dry by Mary,
Elizabeth’s Catholic half-sister, and Mary’s advisors.
Instead of being a fanatic like Mary, Elizabeth was strong-willed, tolerant,
and intelligent. In religious matters, she devised a compromise that 
Chapter 20: Ten Important Royals — Past and Present 327

basically reinstated her father’s Protestant reforms. Another potentially
volatile problem was her cousin, Mary Queen of Scots, who gained the
loyalty of Catholic factions and instituted several plots to assassinate or
overthrow Elizabeth. After irrefutable evidence of Mary’s involvement in
such plots came to light, Elizabeth sadly succumbed to the pressure
from her advisors and had the Scottish princess executed in 1587.
The persecution of continental Protestants forced Elizabeth into war, 
a situation which she desperately tried to avoid. She sent an army to 
aid French Huguenots (Calvinists who had settled in France) after a 
1572 massacre in which over 3,000 Huguenots lost their lives, and she
assisted Belgium in its bid to gain independence from Spain. After
Elizabeth rejected a marriage proposal from Philip II of Spain, the indig-
nant Spanish monarch, incensed by English piracy and forays in the New
World, sent his much-feared Armada to raid England. “I know I have but
the body of a weak and feeble woman,” Elizabeth told her troops, “but I
have the heart and stomach of a king.” England won the naval battle and
emerged as the world’s strongest naval power.
In many ways, Elizabeth’s reign has come to be regarded as a Golden
Age. Literature bloomed through the works of Spenser, Marlowe, and
Shakespeare. Francis Drake and Walter Raleigh expanded English influ-
ence in the New World. Elizabeth’s religious compromise laid many fears
to rest and sought to avoid murderous strife. Fashion and education
came to the fore because of Elizabeth’s penchant for knowledge, courtly
behavior, and extravagant dress. Good Queen Bess, as she came to be
called, maintained a regal air until the day she died, at 70 years of age
and after a very successful 44-year reign. Few English monarchs enjoyed
such political power while still maintaining the devotion of the whole of
English society.
George III (1738–1820): “My Lords 
and Peacocks . . . ”
George III was in no way an exemplary ruler, but I’ve long been fascinated
by him because he was king at the time of the American Revolution and
because he went mad. The only thing he really excelled at was procre-
ation. He married Charlotte of Mecklenburg-Strelitz in 1761, and the pro-
lific couple produced 15 children.
George was descended from the Hanoverian (German) line of succession
that first came to the English throne in 1714. Determined to recover
royal prerogatives lost to the Whig Party by George I and George II,
George III methodically weakened the Whigs through bribery, coercion,
and patronage, hand-picking yes-men of mediocre talent and servile
minds to serve as Cabinet members.
Part VI: The Part of Tens 
328

George’s commitment to taxing the American colonies to pay for military
protection led to hostilities in 1775. The colonists proclaimed independ-
ence in 1776, but George obstinately continued the war until the final
American victory at Yorktown in 1781. The Peace of Versailles, signed in
1783, ensured British acknowledgment of the United States of America.
Bouts with madness (attributed to a disease called porphyria) and the
way he handled the American Revolution eroded his support.
Other major events and people marked George III’s reign. The British
Army under the Duke of Wellington (whose London residence, Apsley
House, you can visit; see Chapter 11) and the British Navy under Lord
Horatio Nelson (honored by Nelson’s Column in London’s Trafalgar
Square; see Chapter 11) defeated French forces under Napoleon.
England also went to war again with the United States between 1812 and
1814, this time over the British practice of pressing American seamen
into service in the British Navy.
It’s safe to say that by the time he began an address with “My Lords and
Peacocks,” it was time for George to step down. Personal rule was given
to his son George, the Prince Regent, in 1811. George III died blind, deaf,
and mad at Windsor Castle (see Chapter 11) on January 29, 1820. You
can see Kew Palace, his favorite residence, on a visit to the Royal
Botanic Gardens (also known as Kew Gardens; see Chapter 11).
George IV (1762–1830): A Dandy 
King for the Regency
George IV, eldest son of George III and Charlotte, was the antithesis of his
father (are we starting to see a pattern here?): conservative in his infre-
quent political involvement and licentious in affairs of the heart. As Prince
Regent, he had many mistresses until he secretly married the Catholic
widow Maria Fitzherbert in 1785. When George III found out about it, he
had the marriage declared illegal because his son would have been ineligi-
ble to reign with a Catholic wife. In 1795, George IV married again, this
time to his cousin Caroline of Brunswick, who was something of a slob
and whom he detested. Caroline took their only child and moved to Italy,
returning to England to claim the rights of queen when George succeeded
his father in 1820. George created one of the greatest scandals of his reign
when he had Caroline barred from his coronation.
Bright, witty, and able on the one hand, indolent, spoiled, and lazy on
the other, George was in some ways the psychological forerunner of
many modern royals. Although he was scandalous with his mistresses
and extravagant in his spending, he was also a patron of the arts and
donated his father’s immense book collection as the foundation of the
British Museum Library. His penchant for building projects inspired the
Regency style of architecture, at its most fanciful in the Royal Pavilion in
Chapter 20: Ten Important Royals — Past and Present 329

Brighton (see Chapter 14). But his extravagances came at a time of
social distress and general misery, following the Napoleonic Wars and
the tremendous changes brought forth by the Industrial Revolution. He
was basically a party boy who couldn’t transcend his sense of royal enti-
tlement to provide true leadership.
Queen Victoria (1819–1901): 
Mother of Monarchs
Victoria, who gave her name to an era, was the daughter of Edward,
Duke of Kent and Strathearn, and Victoria of Saxe-Coburg-Saalfeld. Her
father died when she was an infant, and her mother enacted a strict regi-
men that turned its back on the scandal-ridden courts of Victoria’s
uncles, George IV and William IV. Popular respect for the Crown was at a
low point at her coronation in 1837, but the modest and straightforward
young queen, just 18 years old, eventually won the hearts of her sub-
jects. She refused any further influence from her domineering mother,
and though she had no direct input in policy decisions, she wanted to be
informed of political matters. (After the Reform Act of 1832, legislative
authority resided in the House of Lords, with executive authority resting
within a cabinet formed by members of the House of Commons; the
monarch was essentially powerless.)
Victoria married Prince Albert of Saxe-Coburg in 1840, a marriage that
was apparently happy and certainly fecund: She bore nine children. The
public, however, was not fond of Victoria’s German prince, and Albert
was excluded from holding any official political position, was never
granted a title, and was named Prince Consort only after 17 years of mar-
riage. Victoria did nothing without her husband’s approval. His interests
in art, science, and industry spurred him to organize the Crystal Palace
Exhibition in 1851, a highly profitable industrial convention whose pro-
ceeds were used to purchase lands in Kensington for the establishment
of several museums (one of which is the Victoria & Albert Museum; see
Chapter 11). Following his death from typhoid in 1861, Victoria went into
seclusion for more than 25 years, not emerging until the Golden Jubilee
of 1887. An entire generation had never seen the face of their queen. In
that period, she had the Albert Memorial erected in Kensington Gardens
(see Chapter 11).
During her reign, the British Empire doubled in size, encompassing
Australia, Canada, India, and various locales in Africa and the South
Pacific. Victoria was named Empress of India in 1878. England’s success
in avoiding European conflicts for almost a century (1815 through 1914,
the Crimean War of 1853 to 1856 being the major exception) was due, in
large part, to the marriages Victoria arranged for her children. Either
directly or by marriage, she was related to the royal houses of Belgium,
Denmark, Germany, Greece, Norway, Romania, Russia, and Sweden.
Part VI: The Part of Tens 
330

Nicholas II of Russia married Victoria’s granddaughter Alexandra, and
the dreaded Emperor of Germany, Kaiser Wilhelm II, was her grandson
“Willy.”
The era we now call Victorian England was one in which the queen’s
rigid ethics and uninspired personal tastes generally reflected those of
the middle class. When she died of old age, an entire era died with her.
Queen Elizabeth II (1926–): 
Monarchy Amidst Media
Elizabeth II, who became queen in 1952, is the best known of the seven
remaining monarchs in Europe. The eldest daughter of George VI and
Elizabeth Bowes-Lyon, she married a distant cousin, Philip Mountbatten,
in 1947 and had four children: Charles, Prince of Wales; Anne; Andrew;
and Edward. (For an account of some recent royal scandals involving
Elizabeth’s kids and grandkids, see Chapter 2.)
In the modern world, where wealth and celebrity have taken the place of
actual accomplishment, monarchs are basically privileged show dogs
whose pedigrees allow them to amass enormous fortunes, live in a rari-
fied world, and be regarded as newsworthy for no reason other than that
they’re royal. Seen in the unflattering light of her children, Elizabeth
shines like an old-fashioned beacon of virtue and traditional values. She
has never embarrassed her nation and she is a hard and disciplined
worker, the most widely traveled head of state in the world. She cele-
brated her Golden Jubilee in 2002 and appears determined to remain on
the throne for quite some time — perhaps as long as Victoria.
And yet, overall, the popularity of the English monarchy is in sharp
decline. In large part, this is because the disliked and derided Windsor
children have tarnished the royal name (Princess Diana was the only
recent royal to reach the hearts of the public). But it also has to do with
a growing sense that the monarchy is simply irrelevant. The monarchy
provides an enormous boost to tourism and sells a lot of books and
newspapers, but in a world of democratic models and historical amne-
sia, how can an elitist monarchy achieve any meaningful relationship to
the public it is expected to serve?
It’s hard to imagine England without a king or a queen and the traditions
associated with royalty. And perhaps the monarchy is worth preserving
for that reason alone.
One of my favorite stories about Elizabeth II appeared in a book by Paul
Burrell (the queen’s butler), A Royal Duty. One night, the queen asked if
he would like to accompany her as she viewed the latest likeness of her-
self sent from Madame Tussaud’s for her approval. The queen and her
Chapter 20: Ten Important Royals — Past and Present 331

butler walked through the hallways and corridors of Buckingham Palace
until they came to an enormous, dark drawing room. When the lights
were switched on, they saw a lifelike effigy of the queen standing in the
center of the room. Elizabeth slowly circled her wax twin, carefully scru-
tinizing her image, then pronounced herself satisfied, turned off the
lights, and left her twin in the dark.

Currency Exchange
In London, you can easily exchange cash
or traveler’s checks by using a currency-
exchange service called a bureau de
change. You can find them at the major
London airports, any branch of a major
bank (including Barclays, HSBC, Midland
Bank, and NatWest), all major rail and
Underground stations in Central London,
post offices, and American Express or
Thomas Cook offices.
Customs
For complete Customs information, see
Chapter 12.
Doctors and Dentists
Most hotels have physicians on call.
Medical Express, 117A Harley St., W1 
(% 020/7499-1991; Tube: Oxford Circus), 
is a private clinic with walk-in medical
service (you don’t need an appointment)
Monday through Friday 9 a.m. to 6 p.m. and
Saturday 9:30 a.m. to 2:30 p.m. Dental
Emergency Care Service, Guy’s Hospital,
St. Thomas St., SE8 (% 020/7955-2186;
Tube: London Bridge), is open Monday
through Friday 8:45 a.m. to 3:30 p.m. for
walk-in patients.
Electricity
British current is 240 volts, AC cycle, roughly
twice the voltage of North American cur-
rent, which is 115–120 volts, AC cycle. If
you’re North American, you can’t plug the
flat pins of your appliance’s plugs into the
holes of British wall outlets without suitable
converters or adapters (which you can get
from electrical-supply shops). You can
destroy the inner workings of your appliance
(and possibly start a fire) if you plug an
American appliance directly into a European
electrical outlet without a transformer.
Embassies, Consulates, and High
Commissions
London is the capital of the United
Kingdom and therefore the home of all the
embassies, consulates, and high commis-
sions. United States: 24 Grosvenor Sq., W1
(% 020/7499-9000; www.usembassy.
org.uk; Tube: Bond Street). Canada:
MacDonald House, 38 Grosvenor Sq., 
W1 (% 020/7258-6600; www.canada.

SW1 (% 020/7930-8422; www.new
zealandhc.org.uk; Tube: Charing
Cross or Piccadilly Circus).
Emergencies
For police, fire, or an ambulance, call 
% 999.
Holidays
Americans may not know some British hol-
idays, particularly the spring and summer
Bank Holidays (the last Mon in May and
Aug), when everyone takes off for a long
weekend. Most banks and many shops,
museums, historic houses, and other
places of interest are closed on Bank
Holidays, and public-transport services are
reduced. The same holds true for other
major British holidays: New Year’s Day,
Good Friday, Easter Monday, May Day (the
first Mon in May), Christmas, and Boxing
Day (Dec 26). The London crowds swell
during school holidays: mid-July to early
September, three weeks at Christmas and
at Easter, and a week in mid-October and

Appendix: Quick Concierge 335
in mid-February (when are those kids ever
in school?).
Hospitals
The following hospitals offer 24-hour emer-
gency care: Royal Free Hospital, Pond
Street, NW3 (% 020/7794-0500; Tube:
Belsize Park), and University College
Hospital, Cecil Fleming House, Grafton
Way, WC1 (% 020/7387-9300; Tube:

other London hospitals also have accident
and emergency departments.

even threatened suicides. Doors are open
daily 9 a.m. to 9 p.m., but phones are open
24 hours. Alcoholics Anonymous (% 020/

% 0800/567-123. If you’re in some sort of
legal emergency, call Release at % 020/

Information
The main Tourist Information Centre,
Britain & London Visitor Centre, 1 Regent
St., Piccadilly Circus, SW1 (Tube: Piccadilly
Circus), provides tourist information to
walk-in visitors Monday 9:30 a.m. to 
6:30 p.m., Tuesday to Friday 9 a.m. to 
6:30 p.m., and Saturday and Sunday 10 a.m.
to 4 p.m. You can find another Tourist Infor-
mation Centre in the Arrivals Hall of the
Waterloo International Terminal (open
daily 8:30 a.m.–10:30 p.m.). For general
London information, call % 020/7234-5800.
Internet Access and Cybercafes
easyEverything (www.easyeverything.
co.uk) has cybercafes all over London.
Liquor Laws
No one under 18 can be served alcohol
legally. Children under 16 aren’t allowed in
pubs, except in dining rooms, and then
only when accompanied by a parent or
guardian. Restaurants are allowed to serve
liquor during the same hours as pubs (see
“Business Hours,” earlier in this appendix,
for these hours); however, only people who
have a meal on the premises can be served
a drink. In hotels, liquor may be served
between 11 a.m. and 11 p.m. to both guests
and non-guests; after 11 p.m., only guests
can get a drink.
Mail
A postcard or airmail letter to North
America costs 47p (85¢) for 10 grams and
generally takes about five to seven days
from London to the U.S. You can send mail
within the U.K. first or second class. See
“Post Offices,” later in this appendix.
Maps
You can get the best all-around street
directory, London A to Z, at most news-
stands and bookstores. You can obtain a
bus and Underground map at any
Underground station.
Newspapers and Magazines
The Times, Telegraph, Daily Mail, and
Evening Standard are all dailies carrying
the latest news. You can get copies of the
International Herald Tribune, published in
Paris, and an international edition of USA
Today, beamed via satellite, daily. You can
also buy copies of Newsweek and Time at
most newsstands. Magazines such as 

London For Dummies, 4th Edition 
336
City Limits, Time Out, and Where contain a
lot of useful information about the latest
happenings in London. You can pick up a
copy of Gay Times, a high-quality, news-
oriented magazine covering the gay/les-
bian community, at most news agents. See
“Where to Get More Information,” later in
this appendix, for more info.
Pharmacies
They’re called chemists in the United
Kingdom. The chain Boots has outlets all
over London. Bliss the Chemist, 5 Marble
Arch, W1 (% 020/7723-6116; Tube: Marble
Arch), is open daily 9 a.m. to midnight.
Zafash Pharmacy, 233–235 Old Brompton
Rd., SW5 (% 020/7373-2798; Tube: Earl’s
Court), is London’s only 24-hour pharmacy.
Police
In an emergency, dial % 999.
Post Offices
The Main Post Office, 24 William IV St.,
WC2 (% 020/7930-9580; Tube: Charing
Cross), is open Monday through Saturday
8:30 a.m. to 8 p.m. Other post offices and
sub-post offices (windows in the backs of
news-agent stores) are open Monday
through Friday 9 a.m. to 5:30 p.m. and
Saturday 9 a.m. to 12:30 p.m. Look for red
“Post Office” signs outside.
Radio Stations
You can tune into the following FM stations
while in London: BBC Greater London
Radio (94.9) for rock music; BBC4 (95) for
classical music; LBC Crown (97.3) for news
and reports of what’s happening in London;
Capital FM (95.8) for U.S.-style pop and
rock music; Choice FM (96.9) for jazz,
reggae, or salsa; and Jazz FM (102.2) for
jazz, blues, and big-band music.
Restrooms
The English often call toilets loos. Loos are
marked by “Public Toilets” signs on
streets, in parks, and in a few Tube sta-
tions. You can also find well-maintained
lavatories that anybody can use in all
larger public buildings, such as museums
and art galleries, large department stores,
and rail stations. You can usually use
public lavatories for free, but you may
need a 20p coin to get in or to use a proper
washroom. In some places (like Leicester
Square), you can find coin-operated “Super
Loos” that are sterilized after each use. If all
else fails, duck into the nearest pub.
Safety
Security in the London Underground was
dramatically increased following the 2005
terrorist attacks. In general, London is a
safe city. Muggings have increased in
recent years, however. As in any large
metropolis, use common sense and normal
caution when you’re in a crowded public
area or walking alone at night. The area
around Euston Station has more purse-
snatchings than anywhere else in London.
Smoking
Smoking is forbidden in the Underground
(on the cars and the platforms) and on
buses. Most restaurants have nonsmoking
tables, but they’re sometimes separated
from the smoking section by very little
space. Nonsmoking rooms are available in
more and more hotels, and some B&Bs are
now entirely smoke-free.
Taxes
The 17.5 percent value-added tax (VAT) is
added to all hotel and restaurant bills and
is included in the price of many items that
you purchase. You can get this tax refunded
if you shop at stores that participate in the

Retail Export Scheme (signs are posted in
the windows of participating stores).
Taxis
You can hail a cab from the street; if the
“For Hire” light is lit, the cab is available. You
can phone for a cab at % 020/7272-0272.
Telephone
The country code for the United Kingdom
is 44. London’s telephone area code is 020
within the United Kingdom or 20 outside
the United Kingdom. If you’re calling a
London number from outside the city, use
020 followed by the eight-digit number. If
you’re calling within London, leave off the
020 and dial only the eight-digit number.
For directory assistance in London and the
rest of Britain, dial % 192. To call England
from the United States, dial 011-44-20 and
then the eight-digit phone number. If you’re
dialing a London number within London,
drop the 020 city code.
You can find three types of public pay
phones: those that take only coins
(increasingly rare); those that accept only
phone cards; and those that take phone
cards, credit cards, and coins. You can get
phone cards in four values — £3 ($5.55), £5
($9.25), £10 ($19), and £20 ($37) — and you
can reuse them until you use up the total
value of the card. You can buy the cards
from newsstands and post offices. At coin-
operated phones, insert your coins before
dialing. The minimum charge is 20p (37¢).
The credit-card pay phone operates on
credit cards — Access (MasterCard),
American Express, Diners Club, and Visa.
To make an international call from London,
dial the international access code (00), the
country code, the area code, and the local
number. Or call through one of the following
long-distance access codes: AT&T USA
Direct (% 0800/890-011), Canada Direct
(% 0800/890-016), Australia (% 0800/
890-061), or New Zealand (% 0800/890-064).
Common country codes are: U.S. and
Canada, 1; Australia, 61; New Zealand, 64.
Time Zone
England follows Greenwich mean time
(five hours ahead of eastern standard
time). Clocks move forward one hour on
March 28 and back one hour on October 24.
Most of the year, including summer, Britain
is five hours ahead of the time observed on
the East Coast of the United States. Because
the United States and Britain observe day-
light saving time at slightly different times
of year, for a brief period (about a week) in
autumn, London is only four hours ahead of
New York, and for a brief period in spring,
London is six hours ahead of New York.
Tipping
In restaurants, service charges of 15 to 
20 percent are often added to the bill.
Sometimes, this tip is clearly marked; at
other times, it isn’t. When in doubt, ask. If
service isn’t included, adding 15 percent to
the bill is customary. Sommeliers get about
£1 ($1.85) per bottle of wine served. Tipping
in pubs isn’t done, but in cocktail bars, the
server usually gets about £1 ($1.85) per
round of drinks. Tipping taxi drivers 10 per-
cent to 15 percent of the fare is standard.
Barbers and hairdressers expect 10 to 
15 percent. Tour guides expect £2 ($3.70),
although this tip isn’t mandatory. Theater
ushers are not tipped.

ground, buses, and ferries, call % 020/7222-
