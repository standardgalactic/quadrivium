Tuan 
Nguyen
For as long as computers have been 
around, so have camps. And I’m not 
referring to the types of camps you find 
in the woods. I’m talking about sides—
people choosing one side over another 
side, and fighting about things on a near 
religious level.
You see it everywhere: Mac versus 
PC. Android versus iOS. AMD versus 
Intel. People get really passionate about 
the brands they beholden themselves 
to. When this happens, things get really 
personal. Attacks are made and insults 
are tossed across the border, as though 
one had to defend themselves on a 
personal level.
I find this to be frustrating because 
conversations tend to deteriorate, and 
the merits of a product become lost. 
For me, focusing on empirical data 
yields much better results, although 
sometimes it’s hopeless, even when data 
is presented.
For the most part, I consider myself 
to be campless. I go for the product that 
is best at that time, but I do take into 
consideration a brand’s history. Has 
said brand shown a history of making 
reliable products or providing reliable 
service? It’s easy to come up with one 
great product, but it’s much more 
difficult to land a string of home runs. 
However, many people hold on dearly to 
their brands, whether their products are 
legitimately good or not. The funniest 
part is that the same people accuse 
others of the very guilt they themselves 
hold. I say, let the data speak for itself, 
and leave feelings out of it.
But it’s difficult, isn’t it? People 
get passionate about their hardware, 
and passions run high in the PC 
community. Make no mistake, though, 
it’s no good for anyone when brands die.
Some might not remember, but there 
was a time when there were far more 
GPU options on the market than there 
are now. Today, I count two options. I 
liked it better when there were more: 
S3, ATI, Nvidia, Rendition, 3dfx, Matrox, 
PowerVR, BitBoys, 3Dlabs, Number 
Nine. I probably forgot a few, but wow, 
that was a truly glorious time. I wish 
those companies were still around. 
When there are more players in a space, 
innovation moves faster.
Right now, we’re in a risky situation. 
If one of the major two players gets 
acquired or goes bankrupt, we’re in 
big trouble. Not only does innovation 
plummet, but prices get affected, too. 
I always want all the players in the 
industry to do well.
Does that mean I wouldn’t recommend 
one brand over another? No. There are 
some brands that I would absolutely 
recommend, while others I wouldn’t, 
but that depends on the current product 
lineup as well as things like failure rates 
and customer service. Does that mean 
I wish the rotten apples would die off? 
Absolutely not. I want them to get their 
act together and make better products.
I plant my flag squarely in the middle. 
But I let my wallet do the talking.
One brand

Over half the adult population has personal data stolen
Equifax Loses Data 
on 143m Americans
you toward the website, as the 
agents had no access to Equifax 
accounts. The website suggests 
you sign up for a free year’s 
worth of its credit-monitoring 
service 
(hardly 
tactful, 
especially as initially the terms 
and conditions mean you can’t 
participate in a class-action 
suit against Equifax if you take 
the offer). The site also proved 
unhelpful for many, reporting 
that their data “may” have been 
lost. It doesn’t help that most 
people don’t know if Equifax has 
their data in the first place.
Upon the announcement, 
Equifax stock took a 13 percent 
tumble. It also emerged that 
three of its top executives had 
sold shares, $1.8m worth in all, 
between the breach and before 
the public announcement. This 
is, at best, poor timing. At worst, 
it looks illegal. The company 
claims that the executives had 
“no knowledge that an intrusion 
had occurred at the time they 
sold their shares.”
Equifax has been weathering 
a storm of criticism. When such 
important personal data is lost, 
you need to know, and know at 
once. Waiting five weeks while 
worried executives brainstorm 
damage limitation scenarios is 
unacceptable. Identity theft can 
cause huge damage—having 
your credit rating destroyed is 
no joke, for a start. 
Senator Mark Warner, vice 
chair of the Senate Intelligence 
Committee, called the data 
loss “profoundly troubling.” 
He has called for a rethink in 
data protection policies, so that 
there are “fewer incentives 
to collect large, centralized 
sets of highly sensitive data.” 
The House Financial Service 
Committee and the House 
Judiciary Committee have both 
said they will hold hearings 
on the breach. There will be 
lawsuits, 
of 
course—class 
actions in every state are in the 
pipeline, the first of which have 
been filed.
What has Equifax to say 
about all this? In a statement, 
its CEO, Richard Smith, said, 
“This is clearly a disappointing 
event for our company, and 
one that strikes at the heart of 
who we are and what we do.” 
He also said that the company 
was “conducting a thorough 
review of our overall security 
operations.” Bolt. Horse.
The breach also highlights 
what many security experts 
have been saying for some time 
now. Using personal data, such 
as your birthday and mother’s 
maiden name, are poor ways 
to validate identity. Such data 
is too easy to discover and is 
spread too widely. 
Please don’t panic. Stealing 
data is one thing, an organized 
attempt to use it illegally is 
another. Keep an eye on your 
accounts, and monitor your 
credit rating if you’re worried. 
You will be forgiven if you 
eschew Equifax’s own service. 
As yet, we have no idea who 
stole the data, and there have 
been no reports of any of it being 
used maliciously. However, this 
is a big breach, and we’ll be 
hearing more: lawsuits and 
legislation, if nothing else. –CL
On JuLy 29, credit monitoring 
company Equifax discovered 
that over the previous weeks it 
had been hacked, and a huge 
amount of personal data had 
been stolen. This included full 
names and addresses, birth 
dates, social security numbers, 
driver’s license numbers, and 
even credit card numbers. It 
is the biggest security breach 
since Yahoo in 2014. It’s not just 
the sheer volume of data stolen, 
it’s the quality. Equifax is used 
by financial institutions to check 
identities and credit worthiness 
of potential customers. The 
stolen data is ideal for credit 
fraud and identity theft.
Why are you reading this 
now? Because Equifax didn’t 
say anything for more than five 
weeks. Once it had confessed, 
a website and hotline were 
set up for worried customers. 
Given the numbers involved, the 
hotline was quickly swamped 
(2,000 agents don’t go far when 
you potentially have 143 million 
callers), and even if you did 
get through, it merely pointed 
Equifax CEO, Richard Smith, said, “This 
is clearly a disappointing event for our 
company, and one that strikes at the heart 
of who we are and what we do.”

Tech Triumphs and Tragedies
The juicero is, or rather was, an Internet-enabled 
machine that squeezed sachets of fresh vegetables 
and fruit into juice. As a start-up, the San Francisco 
company attracted some big-name investors, 
including Google Ventures. The $699 machine it finally 
delivered was lovely, but hugely over-engineered. It didn’t help that you could 
squeeze some of the packs by hand with very similar results. The machine would 
only squeeze branded packs, and refused anything out of date, no matter how 
wholesome it still was. Dropping the price to $399 didn’t help, especially as it 
was losing money, even at the higher price. 
It will be remembered, though. As a triumph of optimism over reality more 
than anything else; it has been the victim of much schadenfreude and mockery. 
Some investors say that an anti-elitist media helped bring it down—it can’t have 
helped. But they were trying to sell a $400 juice press that only used proprietary 
sachets. The company has given people 90 days to apply for a refund. –cl

The wheels of The law may move slowly, 
but they get you in the end. In 2015, it emerged that 
Lenovo had been selling laptops that came pre-installed with 
adware called VisualDiscovery, from SuperFish. This pushed pop-up ads from Lenovo 
partners when you mouse over similar content. It also collected a lot of data without 
your consent. Most worryingly, it messed with Digital Certificates, replacing them with 
less secure versions. A fuss was made, and a removal tool offered. Lenovo claimed to be 
unaware of the security implications. The Federal Trade Commission has said the company 
must gain user permission for any future adware, as well as test its software for security 
flaws for the next 20 years. The company also took home a $3.5 million fine. –cl

how is This for a deal? Take your $9.95 
a month MoviePass card into any theater 
that takes debit cards, swipe, and get a 
ticket, one per day. This is the new deal from 
MoviePass, and it has proved popular—
subscriptions jumped from around 20,000 to 
over 150,000 in just two days.
MoviePass has been around since 2011. 
It started with a cumbersome voucher 
system, and then ran through various 
pricing structures, none especially cheap. In 
2016, one of Netflix’s founders, Mitch Lowe, 
became CEO. This year, the company was 
bought out by the analytics firm Helios and 
Matheson, and on the same day it announced 
the business model that has done Netflix and 
others so well: a cheap flat-rate subscription 
that lets you binge if you wish. 
The huge surge in subscriptions has 
prompted 
teething 
troubles, 
including 
crashed websites, and delayed delivery of 
membership cards. Supposedly, you can 
also access the service using a smartphone 
app to buy e-tickets, but few theaters accept 
them, and it has been troublesome. The app 
has also proved to be awkward, demanding, 
and unpopular. 
MoviePass faces problems from within 
the industry, too, including a spat with AMC 
Theaters, the largest chain in the country, 
which is reportedly looking for a way to 
block MoviePass subscriptions. It claims the 
deal is “shaky and unsustainable.” Come on, 
guys, you still get paid full price, and think of 
all the extra popcorn you can sell.
Will it work? Mitch Lowe says he has 
the numbers and data to show it will. The 
company wants your data, of course, to use 
for targeted advertising and promotions. 
It also hopes to get a slice of movie 
marketing cash, from recommendations 
and “pay for performance” (basically a 
kickback). MoviePass even hopes to invest 
in filmmaking in time. Heavy users will lose 
the company money, but if it can reach big 
numbers, it’ll even out. There are a lot of 
industry people watching this one. –cl

The Blockchain Bonanza
This isn’t the first time we’ve seen GPU prices 
and availability affected by cryptocurrencies—in  
summer 2011, there was a rush to buy AMD’s HD 5870, 
and in late 2013/early 2014, the same thing happened 
with the R9 290/290X. It’s also unlikely to be the 
last we hear of GPU-based cryptocurrency mining, 
as both AMD and Nvidia CEOs have mentioned the 
influence of “coin miners” on the GPU market, and 
several partner companies have released dedicated 
mining cards (a GPU without video outputs).
However, where GPUs were once useful for mining 
Bitcoin directly, then used for other options such as 
Litecoin and Dogecoin, today the algorithms used 
by Bitcoin and Litecoin have transitioned to ASICs—
Application Specific Integrated Circuits designed 
purely for blockchain related solutions. But that 
doesn’t mean graphics cards are out of the picture, 
as new algorithms have sprung up that are currently 
best run on GPUs. Two prominent examples are 
Ethereum and Zcash, the former of which is largely 
to blame for the shortage of AMD GPUs.
Ethereum isn’t new—it officially launched July 30, 
2015. Like other cryptocurrencies, initial pricing was 
guesswork, with no one knowing if it would succeed. 
ETH prices remained below $10 during 2015, first 
breaking into double digits in March 2016, but that 
was nothing compared to what happened in 2017. 
First, there was a surge from single digits back into 
double digits in January, followed by record highs of 
up to $50 in March—then April and May happened, 
with ETH rocketing up to a high of around $400.
Suddenly everyone wanted in on the action, and in 
May a single RX 580 graphics card could earn over 
$5 per day from mining Ethereum—so it could pay 
for itself in under a month. Inventory disappeared, 
with prices hitting $600 and more on auction sites. 
Nvidia cards weren’t unscathed, as Zcash and other 
coins provided similarly insane returns, though the 
GTX 1080/1080 Ti mostly avoided going out of stock.
As the dust continues to settle, we’re still waiting 
for GPU prices to return to normal—“normal” being 
prices at or below the original MSRPs. AMD’s Radeon 
CryptoCurrenCies have been big news for several months, with 
prices on many graphics cards shooting into the stratosphere—for a 
while, it was almost impossible to find AMD’s RX 570 or 580 at anything 
resembling a reasonable price. The cause: cryptocurrency miners.
RX 570 4GB is nominally supposed 
to start at $170, and the RX 580 8GB 
at $240, but the last time we saw 
those prices was in April. Similarly, 
the GTX 1070 is supposed to start 
at $380, and in March/April we saw 
prices fall to $350, but combined 
with increased demand for GDDR5, 
we’ve witnessed higher graphics 
card prices on virtually all products.
The question many still have is 
whether GPU mining is worthwhile 
at these prices. The short answer: 
Probably not. The longer answer: 
It’s a gamble, but right now, on a 
daily basis, most cards generate 
more potential money (in digital 
currencies) than they use in power, 
making them profitable.
I ran some tests of current-
gen cards, to see what returns are 
possible, using a cost of $0.10 per 
kWh. You can see the approximate 
time to break even for a complete 
mining rig above. This is only an 
estimate, however, as prices and the 
difficulty of mining remain volatile.
It could take more than twice 
as long as shown, and if hardware 
breaks, which is a possibility when 
running gaming GPUs at full load 
24/7, you might never break even. 
But if you’re an optimist, even the 
current prices of over $300 for 
Ethereum and $4,400 for Bitcoin (at 
the time of writing) are undervalued.
That hope of striking it rich is 
why many continue to invest in 
PC hardware—and why it’s called 
“mining,” in reference to gold 
rushes. Don’t be surprised if, like 
the gold rush, the biggest winners 
are the companies that supply the 
hardware, rather than the miners.

It took me over a year to check out some of Keybase’s 
features. Imagine my surprise when I was tooling 
around on the Keybase website and started reading 
about something called the Keybase filesystem. 
Sounds neat. But it was nowhere to be found in the 
version that came in my distro’s official repository. 
Curious, I tried the version available on GitHub.
It turns out that the KBFS is a mountpoint (using 
Fuse) located at “/keybase” on your system. Files 
stored in subfolders of that path are automatically 
encrypted and/or signed for the recipients. A path 
such as “/keybase/public/alexcampbell” signs files 
and makes them available to anyone on the Internet. 
Saving a file to “/keybase/private/alexcampbell” 
encrypts the file so that only I can read it. Finally, 
saving a file to “/keybase/private/alexcampbell,bob” 
encrypts the file so only Bob and I can read it, and 
automatically shares it with Bob. I said it was neat.
If you’re not familiar with Keybase.io, it’s a 
service that’s built to solve one of the problems 
that’s plagued PGP: Authentication and establishing 
trust in someone’s identity is hard. There’s no real 
name enforcement when you create a PGP key. If you 
want to use the name Barack Obama and the email 
barackobama@whitehouse.gov, nothing stops you. 
That doesn’t sound so bad, but keyservers—the 
traditional repositories of public keys—don’t enforce 
identities either. The only thing you 
can use to identify a unique key is its 
fingerprint. In a way, a keyserver is 
a place where anyone can jump up 
and claim “I’m Spartacus!” Unless 
the poor Roman soldier has a copy 
of the true Spartacus’s fingerprint 
handy, there’s no reliable way to tell 
these jokers from the real McCoy.
Keybase fixes this problem by 
allowing users to offer up their 
public key as well as authenticated 
links to social media accounts, 
GitHub accounts, and personal 
websites. It’s like shouting “I’m 
Spartacus!” while holding up a birth 
certificate and driver’s license.
The Keybase filesystem is cloud 
storage in disguise. But it encrypts 
your files client-side (on your PC) 
before uploading them. As long 
as you keep your private keys to 
yourself, no one can read the files. 
There’s no sync model, so you can

How GitHub Led Me to a 
Better Version of Keybase
I’ve had a Keybase.Io account for a couple years now. Even though 
I’ve never had the need to send encrypted messages to anyone, I’ve still 
kept my account current. As a writer, you never know whether someone 
will drop the next scoop in your lap. But, if I’m being honest, I’ve really 
kept it because crypto tech is just plain cool.
only access the filesystem when 
online. If you really need sync 
capability, you can use rsync.
I like the fact that crypto is getting 
easier. Signal makes crypto as easy 
as pie for text messaging. However, 
sending files via Signal is less than 
ideal on desktop. Keybase makes 
sharing encrypted files a snap on 
top of its simplification of PGP.
Keybase offers 10GB of free 
storage for its filesystem; Google 
Drive’s free tier is 15GB. On top of 
that, files you share with others 
don’t count against your friends’ 
quota. That means if you share 
photos of your trip to the Everglades 
with your uncle Jim, he won’t curse 
your name for eating up all his 
storage space with blurry photos of 
what you claim are alligators.
If there’s a lesson to take away 
from all this (besides the fact that 
free encrypted file storage is kind 
of awesome), it’s that there’s often 
more to software packages than 
meets the eye. Updating your system 
gives you the latest patches to keep 
your system secure. But if you look 
beyond the repo, sometimes you 
can find something awesome that 
you never knew existed.

BY alex cox
As we crawl toward the end of the eighth generation of games consoles, hardware revisions 
mean prices have come down and capabilities have gone up. Time to pick the best, with a 
couple of caveats. One: The imminent release of the Xbox One X may skew these results 
significantly, but we’re working with the hardware that’s actually on the market at press 
time. Two: We’ve not included the PC. Why? Because we know, and you know, that a properly 
upgraded PC will trounce any of these made-to-a-budget boxes in just about every test.
Xbox One S vs. PS4 Pro  
vs. Nintendo Switch
Media Playback
Let’s quickly sidestep the Switch here, 
which has, basically, no media playback 
skills at all. At press time, Nintendo 
has not even offered up an official web 
browser, although a few enterprising 
individuals have found workarounds 
that enable you to at least get YouTube 
sort of working.
So, we’re left with the Xbox One S 
and the PS4 Pro, and one of the most 
perplexing design decisions in console 
history. Sony, originator of the Blu-ray 
format—the same format that flattened 
Microsoft-backed HD-DVD so long ago, 
the one that sold a metric ton of PS3s 
for Sony back in the day—released 
the PS4 Pro with no Ultra-HD Blu-ray 
support at all. The Xbox One S, on the 
other hand, can play back UHD discs, 
and it’s just about the cheapest 4K  
Blu-ray player on the market. It’s not 
the best, but it does the job. 
That’s not to say the PS4 Pro is 
completely neutered in this department, 
though. It can play 4K footage from 
USB media—and, frankly, most of 
us have moved beyond optical media 
now, right? But the Xbox One S can do 
that, too, and picture quality is all but 
indistinguishable between them.
Winner: 
Xbox One S
Gaming
Each of these machines has its own 
software library, with worthy exclusives 
on each platform, although the Switch’s 
selection of Nintendo classics stands 
out the most: You certainly won’t find the 
latest Mario or Zelda titles hitting any of 
the other consoles. That said, it was the 
latest console to launch, and has only 
a tiny fraction of the library of its big-
boy rivals. 
The Switch also possesses only a 
sliver of the power of its competitors. 
It theoretically tops out at 1080p, but 
spends most of its time dynamically 
scaling the resolution so things stay 
smooth, and its handheld mode supports 
only 720p (given that’s the resolution 
of its panel), and compensates for its 
processor’s mobile power scaling with 
some hefty frame rate drops. 
On the other side of the fight, the Xbox 
One S swishes through the console’s 
huge 1080p library very happily, boosting 
picture quality on 4K TVs with some neat 
HDR effects, while the PS4 Pro manages 
to go one better, with some games 
offering true 4K video modes—although 
developers are not shy of dynamic 
resolution scaling when things begin to 
get a little choppy. 
Winner: 
PS4 Pro
Upgradability
Coming 
at 
consoles 
from 
a 
PC 
enthusiast perspective, it’s difficult not 
to feel a little smug when discussing 
upgradability. If we want a higher 
frame rate or a resolution upgrade, we 
pick up a new GPU, some more RAM, a 
beefier processor. It’s possible to boost 
a PC entirely piecemeal,  something 
that consoles are yet to approach. 
However, it’s a matter of perspective—
compare the possibility of swapping an 
existing Xbox One S with the marginally 
better Xbox One X, due for release at 
$500, to sticking a $1,200 Titan X in 
your PCIe slot. That’s not all that bad, 
although obviously the PC component is 
rocking a massive amount more power.
The real upgrade potential for games 
consoles comes in the form of their 
peripherals. Nintendo’s tactic is to 
sell you an overpriced controller that’s 
actually made for human thumbs. You 
can boost a regular Xbox One S with 
a Kinect for a little voice and camera 
interactivity. But Sony wins the day here, 
with its PSVR headset. Yes, the PSVR 
game library isn’t the best, but this is 
120Hz console VR, with a supremely 
designed helmet that’s both comfortable 
and straightforward to set up. 
Winner: 
PS4 Pro

Form Factor and Flexibility
Finally, it’s time for the Switch to shine. 
You can play it handheld, you can play 
it docked and attached to your TV. You 
can use its Joy-cons loose, attached 
to a little plastic grip, held in all kinds 
of implausible positions. It really does 
offer up a huge number of options that 
ordinary box-under-the-TV consoles 
can’t. However, you can’t slide it 
neatly on to a shelf in your living room, 
because you need vertical access to its 
dock to insert it. And you can’t actually 
do anything else with it beyond playing 
its limited library of games.
The Xbox One S and PS4 Pro aren’t 
just games consoles—they’re media 
streamers, 
they’re 
(poor) 
Internet 
access devices. They connect you to 
a community. Tuck them away and 
(assuming you’ve chosen the black 
version of the Xbox, rather than the 
gaudy white one) they’re subtle and 
unassuming. You can even stream 
games from each directly to your PC or 
to Twitch. We can’t put an inch between 
them in terms of their flexibility, and 
there’s something about the plug-and-
play nature of a traditional console that 
really can’t be beat. 
Tie: 
Xbox One S, PS4 Pro,  
Nintendo Switch
Cost
Comparing 
our 
three 
videogame 
consoles merely on the basis of price 
offers up a clear winner. The 1TB flavor 
of the Xbox One S (retailing at $349) 
beats out the 1TB PS4 Pro ($399) and the 
Nintendo Switch ($369) handily. Opt for 
the 500GB flavor, though—something 
that Sony isn’t offering—and the Xbox 
can be had for as little as $249. The 
value equation is only likely to shift 
further in its favor once the Xbox One X 
hits the shelves. 
However, there are further costs 
to consider. Additional controllers, for 
example, to enable local multiplayer, 
come in at a painful $60 for both Sony 
and Microsoft’s consoles, though you 
may be able to find them cheaper 
somewhere. Nintendo’s cunning design 
philosophy means its detachable Joy-
cons make the Switch multiplayer-
compatible from the get-go, as long as 
you’re happy with hand cramp. It also 
comes with its own screen; if you factor 
in the cost of a display, it’s by far the 
value winner. But we’d wager you have 
a TV already, which makes that a moot 
point, and to really make the most of the 
Switch, you need to add an SD card and, 
realistically, a $70 pro controller.
Winner: 
Xbox One S
Poor Nintendo. The company has 
created a tremendously exciting device 
in the Switch, one that puts proper 
next-gen games right into your hands, 
and makes a perfect home for its 
massive range of iconic characters. 
But it couldn’t possibly win our test, 
because it’s essentially some cheap 
tablet hardware in disguise.
And so to the eternal schoolyard 
battle between Xbox and PlayStation. 
Neither shines brighter than the 
other. Which game library you prefer 
is down to personal taste, their media 
capabilities are exceptionally close, and 
even the online services—PlayStation 
Plus and Xbox Live Gold—are similarly 
priced with very similar benefits. 
At the end of the day, every argument 
boils down to a cost/benefit analysis, 
and that’s how we must settle this one. 
The Xbox One S is so much cheaper 
than its rival, with the added benefit of 
UHD Blu-ray support, that we’ve 
granted it the top spot. Whether the 
forthcoming Xbox One X does enough, 
in hardware terms, to overcome a $100 
price deficit over the PS4 Pro is another 
matter altogether.
And the
Winner Is…

RAM Drive Dilemma
Dear Doctor, I have built a 
number of computers, and on 
all of them, I set up a 24GB 
RAM drive, and point my 
temporary directories there. 
I do this for three reasons. 
First, I believe it speeds up 
the machine, particularly the 
Internet, which seems to read 
and write a lot of files. Second, 
I use an SSD for programs, 
and a mechanical hard drive 
for writing to, and I think using 
a RAM drive as intermediate 
storage space saves wear and 
tear on those other devices. 
And third, when I need to hold 
a file just long enough to send 
it somewhere else, I store it 
on the RAM drive to prevent 
clutter on disk.
Aside from the rare 
mistake where I work on 
a file on the RAM drive, I 
haven’t suffered from the fact 
that files disappear when I 
reboot. When I had less RAM, 
sometimes the temp drive was 
too small. But at 24GB, I’ve 
never had a problem.
Do you see anything wrong 
with what I am doing? If so, 
what? And is there a RAM 
drive utility that you favor? 
 
–Neal Nusholtz
THE DOCTOR RESPONDS: 
Back when the Doc spent his 
nights and weekends running 
scripts to benchmark CPUs, 
RAM drives played a critical 
role in preventing storage 
bottlenecks. Around the time 
Intel introduced its Nehalem 
architecture, however, 
the company also started 
shipping X25-M SSDs. Shortly 
thereafter, the Doc stopped 
using RAM drives and started 
running his test suite from 
solid-state storage.
The point is, for nearly a 
decade, SSDs have largely 
addressed the performance 
concerns that once made RAM 
drives necessary for I/O-bound 
applications. They’ve evolved a 
ton, too. Today’s PCIe SSDs can 
move gigabytes of information 
a second. Their NAND flash 
does have a finite lifespan 
(rated in program-erase 
cycles), so it’s understandable 
that you’re looking to minimize 
wear and tear. But most 
consumer SSDs are plenty 
robust for common desktop 
use. And although the Doc 
appreciates the use of volatile 
storage to mitigate clutter, he’d 
rather have 100 files he doesn’t 
need than lose one he does.
In the end, there’s nothing 
wrong with what you’re doing. 
It’s just not economically 
sensible. Presumably, to set 
aside 24GB of RAM, you’d want 
64GB installed. At $500 for four 
16GB modules, that’s almost 
$8/GB. Good enterprise-class 
SSDs sell for $1/GB. A 32GB 
memory kit, high-end SSD, and 
roomy mechanical disk should 
address your concerns, save 
money, and step around the 
limitations of RAM drives.
Multiple Monitors
Hello Doctor, I have an HP 
Slim Desktop 410-030. It 
currently supports up to two 
monitors. But it also has 
a PCI Express 2.0 slot. I’m 
looking for a low-profile PCIe 
2.0-compatible graphics card 
that I can use to attach three 
displays for business use.
I tried an Asus EN210 Silent 
video card with 1GB of RAM. 
Although it has connections 
for three monitors, I was 
only able to use two of them. 
The third monitor could only 
be used as a mirror of one 
of the others. I called Asus 
and it said that PCIe 2.0 only 
works with two monitors. Is 
it correct? Will I have to use a 
USB-based video card to add a 
third display? –Leon Garfield
THE DOCTOR RESPONDS: It 
sounds as though the Asus rep 
was mistaken. Your limitation 
isn’t related to PCI Express, but 
rather the GeForce 210’s GT218 
graphics processor, which can 
only output to two independent 
displays simultaneously. For 
what it’s worth, a 16-lane PCIe 
2.0 slot offers up to 8 GB/s of 
throughput—bandwidth isn’t an 
issue here.
Based on pictures of your 
chassis and the Shave-HSW 
motherboard that HP uses, a 
low-profile graphics card is 
mandatory. But it doesn’t need 
to live in a single expansion 
slot. There’s room under 
the motherboard and, more 
importantly, there’s another 
I/O bracket to accommodate a 
dual-slot form factor.
If you’d like to avoid analog 
VGA output and are willing 
to spend $120 or so, several 
low-profile GeForce GTX 
1050s support as many as four 
monitors through DVI, HDMI, 
and DisplayPort connectors. 
Nvidia recommends a 300W 
power supply for these cards. 
Because you won’t be gaming, 
though, the HP’s 180W 80 PLUS 
Bronze PSU shouldn’t have to 
work hard at all. 
Don’t go heavy on memory just 
to run a RAM drive. A fast SSD 
is more economical.

Choosing an Upgrade
Hey Doc,I have an eight-
year-old Alienware Area-51 
(Phobos) PC that’s showing its 
age. I’m hoping you can help 
me modernize it, as I spent a 
lot on it, and can’t afford to buy 
or build a new machine right 
now. The system’s current 
specs include a water-cooled 
Core i7-975 processor, 12GB 
of RAM, two GeForce GTX 295s 
in SLI, two 10K rpm 300GB 
VelociRaptor hard drives in 
RAID 0, and two 1.5TB storage 
disks in RAID 1.
I also have four 750GB 
Samsung 840 EVOs lying 
around. Do you recommend 
that I install them and sling 
them together in a RAID 
array? Also, what’s the 
best single GPU that I could 
purchase for my motherboard 
(I don’t know its make or 
model) that would allow me 
to play The Division or Call of 
Duty: Infinite Warfare?
 –An Out-of-Money Gamer
THE DOCTOR RESPONDS: Back 
in the day, Core i7-975 Extreme 
Edition was cream of the crop. 
Its complementary platform 
controller hub, X58, offered 
up to 36 lanes of PCI Express 
2.0 connectivity, 32 of which 
your GeForce GTX 295s are 
monopolizing (to the tune of 
almost 300W per card).
It would help to know the 
native resolution of your 
monitor. Given the age of your 
PC, though, the Doc is going 
to guess 1920x1080 (actually, 
1920x1200 was more prevalent 
back then). If that’s the case, a 
GeForce GTX 1060 6GB would 
better support modern DirectX 
12/Vulkan graphics APIs, offer 
plenty of performance, cut 
power consumption, and crank 
out way less heat than those 
GTX 295s. If you’re running at 
2560x1440, a GeForce GTX 1070 
would be more apropos for 
first-person shooters, but it’s 
also pricier.
Now, about those Samsung 
840 EVO SSDs. They’re lying 
around, you say? That’s 3TB of 
solid-state storage! Get at least 
one of them into your PC with 
Windows on it. The difference 
in responsiveness, even 
compared to the once-mighty 
VelociRaptors, will make you 
wonder why you didn’t make the 
switch sooner.
Laptop Storage Limits
Hi Doc, I am a long-time 
Maximum PC subscriber, and 
I love your mag! I have an 
Asus K501U gaming laptop 
that came with an M.2 drive 
loaded with Windows, plus a 
1TB mechanical drive for user 
data. I swapped out the disk 
for a Crucial 1TB SSD. The 
problem is that I like to keep 
all of my games on the new 
SSD, and I have a lot of them. 
Now I’m running out of space.
Should I switch back to a 
more spacious (but slower) 
mechanical drive, or buy an 
external SSD to run my games 
from? 
–Oleg Kravtchouk
THE DOCTOR RESPONDS: As a 
rule, the Doc avoids tacking on 
external peripherals to laptops. 
Toting around an SSD for 
gaming doesn’t sound fun. And 
dropping back to a conventional 
hard drive imposes the long 
level load times gamers try 
to get away from. Instead, 
maximize the upgradeability of 
your laptop’s M.2 2280 slot and 
SATA interface.
Assuming you purchased 
your K501U with the largest 
M.2-based SSD option, it’s 
only a 256GB drive. Crucial 
sells a compatible upgrade 
with 1TB of capacity. There’s 
also a 2TB model that pops 
into the 2.5-inch 
bay, doubling what 
you have now. Both SSDs 
maintain Asus’s clean lines 
and, together, yield up to 3TB.
Moving from Microsoft
Dear Doctor, Most of the PCs 
I own are pretty old, and the 
main reason I read Maximum 
PC is to keep up to date. I want 
to build a new system with 
current hardware soon, but 
one of the things stopping me 
is my software options.
I'm annoyed with Microsoft 
because it basically forced 
Windows 7 to die out. Among 
other problems now for 
Windows 7 is that Internet 
Explorer 12 has issues 
with many websites. Edge 
on 10 appears to run more 
smoothly, and it’s more 
regularly updated. I use other 
browsers, of course, but 
would prefer IE if it worked 
correctly. In your last issue, 
you revealed another example 
of Windows 7 getting the boot: 
It won’t support Kaby Lake. 
But the main reason that 
Microsoft wants its customers 
off Windows 7 (or anything 
older) is that it wants to 
please the entertainment and 
software industry by trying 
to stop pirating, since torrent 
sites may reject PCs running 
Windows 10. My disgust with 
Microsoft compels me to 
adopt Linux for my next build. 
I’m going to try Fedora first 
and see whether the updates 
and bugs are tolerable.
On another topic, I find it 
interesting that Maximum 
PC sees high-end Intel 
processors as over-priced 
since the release of Ryzen. 
Clearly, you don’t believe 
in the saying “you get what 
you pay for” in this case. 
Performance benchmarks of 
the Ryzen 7 1700X and 1800X 
are pretty impressive, but I’m 
curious how AMD compares 
to Intel in areas such as 
longevity, error control, and 
so on. Is there any way besides 
benchmarking to justify Intel’s 
pricing?  
–Glen Kussow
THE DOCTOR RESPONDS: 
Perceived value is relative. 
Nobody wanted to see Intel’s 
flagship high-end desktop 
CPU rise from $1,000 to over 
$1,700, but when Broadwell-E 
was the only game in town, 
enthusiasts begrudgingly 
paid up when those additional 
cores mattered. Now, power 
users have a choice, and Intel’s 
premium price doesn’t buy you 
as much extra speed.
Platform maturity plays 
into some purchase decisions 
more than others. At launch, 
Ryzen had issues. But most of 
them were worked out, and the 
Doc’s Ryzen-based test bed is 
running fine months later. Only 
time will tell if AMD built an 
infrastructure to last. Clearly, 
though, the definition of value is 
changing, thanks to AMD.
As far as Microsoft and 
Windows 10 go, the Doc 
encourages you to vote with 
your wallet (though he’s getting 
by well with a VPN and common

How to spec up your own crazy 
video-editing workstation of glory
We’ve been alluding to this build for 
a while. The king of all systems—
for the next month or so, at least. As 
processor core counts and clock speeds 
continue 
to 
advance 
ever 
onward, 
desktop performance has increased at 
an exponential rate this last year. We 
haven’t seen the likes of this since 2010, 
and it’s a joy to witness. 
Big blue and fiery red are at it again—
CPU Ragnarök has arrived, and with 
it, a new wave of performance gains, 
while the battle of the processor gods for 
market share rages on. 
Threadripper brings the very best 
of server-grade processing prowess to 
the HEDT (high-end desktop) platform. 
We’re no longer limited by a meager 8 or 
10 cores, or PCIe lanes stuck below the 
40 mark. X399 represents the finest of 
what the consumer can get their hands 
on today. With support for up to 128GB of 
quad-channel DDR4, the aforementioned 
PCIe greatness, and a plethora of other 
neat features, it’s currently the go-to 
platform for anyone who makes a living 
from the lush green fields of content 
creation, and ideal for our future plans 
and development here at Maximum PC.
So, what’s the sitch? Well, we plan 
to expand our online digital footprint 
considerably. Although our team works 
with PC  Gamer, we (the print team) 
feel there’s not enough content, nor 
budget for said content, that caters to 
our readers, you guys—gaming’s nice 
and all, but it isn’t everything. We’ve 
been trialing a few things recently, but 
to further commit to more demanding 
upload schedules and content creation, 
we’ve decided to invest heavily into 
a rendering rig. With Threadripper 
launching just last month, it makes 
perfect sense to take advantage of one 
of our powerhouses of review samples, 
and dedicate it to a full-time working

it’s incredible hoW far things have 
come in the last year. Let’s take a step 
back to October 2016 for a moment: 
Intel’s 14nm Skylake architecture was 
still kicking maximum ass, with its 
incredible IPC and strong I/O support, 
and the Core i7-6950X was still the 
only processor to have made the jump 
beyond that eight core count—but it 
came in at a staggering $,1000. AMD, 
on the other hand, was still lurking 
around in the world of super-budget 
FPU and APU rigs, with a convoluted 
platform and slim pickings when it 
came to performance. 
The rumor mill was in full flow, 
though, with rumblings of Intel’s latest 
Kaby Lake architecture soon to launch, 
and the Ryzen hype train getting up to 
speed. That aside, core count seemed to 
be resolutely staying put—for the time 
being, at least.
Twelve months later, and the entire 
ecosystem has changed dramatically. 
Ryzen was a major game-changer, 
making eight cores the norm, and 
demolishing Intel’s four-core industry; 
it’s seen both HEDT and mid-range 
systems change for the better.
The culmination of all of AMD’s hard 
work lies within the beauty that is 
Threadripper. Needing a competitive 
platform to rival Intel’s X99 series, 
AMD took a cue from its server-grade 
EPYC chips, and pulled the entire 
platform into a consumer-friendly 
variant. Utilizing half as many cores 
(so far), and quad-channel support, as 
opposed to the octo-channel featured in 
EPYC, team red kept the I/O identical 
to its server-bound child, leading to a 
phenomenal 64 PCIe lanes available 
on every X399 board. Combine that 
with a staggering 16 Ryzen cores 
communicating across AMD’s infinity 
fabric, with multithreading, and you’re 
essentially looking at 32 threads 
capable of operating at a 3.7GHz 
stock frequency in multithreaded 
applications. Something even Intel 
has struggled to achieve so far on its 
higher end cores.
As though that’s not enough, it’s 
even possible to overclock the lot of 
them. Although we’re only talking 
a small increment of 300–400MHz, 
when done across all 16 cores, the 
performance gains are almost 
unbelievable. Perfect for anyone using 
demanding processing applications.

spending far too much money on 
a motherboard is one of the easiest 
mistakes you can make as a rookie 
PC enthusiast. It’s easy to fall for the 
marketing slogans, disproportionate bar 
graphs, and everything else littering a 
manufacturer’s page, and shell out too 
much on a board that will likely give 
you just as much performance as one 
costing $100–200 less than the flagship.
That’s not to say there’s no reason to 
invest in a more premium board. I/O is a 
big deal, and once you start delving into 
the HEDT platform to look for chunky 
content-creation machines, it suddenly 
becomes far more important than any 
marginal gains you might see in game.
For us, the choice was obvious: the 
Asus Prime X399-A. With a workstation 
heritage, solid BIOS, and a plethora 
of I/O, it fits our build perfectly. We 
can throw in 128GB of DDR4 memory, 
connect the three storage devices, 
install multiple GPUs in the future, and 
still have room for our 1.2TB combined 
OS PCIe SSD and scratch disk.
Coupled with its solid BIOS, fantastic 
on-board audio, and a fairly substantial 
cooling solution for the VRMs, it’s a 
no-brainer. It also looks stellar. At first 
glance, when we started to scour the 
web for an X399 board, we assumed this 
mobo was coated in white. However, 
when it arrived, the white turned out to 
have a gorgeous silver brushed-metal 
hue to it, covering the north Digi+ Power 
VRM solution, the rear I/O, and the 
chipset at the south of the board.
For us, having an accessible and 
informative BIOS is a huge deal, and 
there are few BIOSes out there at the 
same level as that of Asus. Whether 
it’s down to its impressive design 
team, or the excessive market share the 
company has, it’s so easy to manipulate 
your hardware, adjust fan curves, and 
overclock the crap out of anything you 
need to do on the trusty platform.

We didn’t go overboard with the power 
supply solution this time, instead 
choosing to pick up this 1,000W fully 
modular PSU from Be Quiet! It’s a 
perfect fit, coming with simple black 
cables, and that’s about it. No fuss, at a 
not-so-ridiculous price.
It is, unfortunately, only rated at 
80 Plus Bronze, but as this machine 
is only going to be used in a corporate 
environment, for which Maximum PC 
doesn’t pay the bills, we can get away 
with that lack of additional efficiency. 
That said, our build can draw up 
to 721W from the wall under absolute 
full load, so we may be cutting it a 
little fine if we decide to upgrade in 
the future—but, in all honesty, the 
likelihood of needing to go beyond a 
single-card solution is slim.
for case choice, we knew we 
needed something that could cater 
for the ridiculous width of that 
E-ATX motherboard. Unfortunately, 
due to the vast swathe of VRMs 
and connectivity that Threadripper 
requires, the likelihood of finding a 
true ATX mobo is slim. This, in turn, 
also limits which chassis you can use, 
with even the chunky Evolv ATX being 
a little tighter than we’d like to admit 
for this build.
That said, it’s one of our favorite 
compact cases, and it supports a wide 
range of cooling, and support for all 
the storage we want for this machine. 
Couple that with the tempered glass 
and thick black aluminum, and it 
brightens up the office with its clean, 
chunky workstation aesthetic, too.

noW the “What” has been covered, 
it’s time to get down to the “why.” This 
system’s sole purpose is to output 4K 
video from Adobe’s Premiere Pro CC 
editing software. 
We intend to record two or three 
videos once a week, then schedule them 
to upload online over a period of time, 
via either our Facebook page or YouTube, 
producing anything from teaser system 
build shoots, to timelapsed content, 
quick and dirty unboxings, and more. 
Depending on how that goes, we’ll 
begin to push for more content to go up, 
eventually up to one or two videos a day.
Premiere Pro is our go-to video-editing 
software for a number of reasons. Most 
notably due to its ability to utilize 
desktop-based hardware on Windows. 
Apple’s Final Cut Pro is more efficient at 
rendering 4K, but for color correction and 
ease of use, Prem is the best for the job.
Traditionally, Premiere Pro thrived 
on CPU power. It wasn’t until CS5 that 
it advanced to 64-bit, 
to take advantage of 
more than 4GB of DDR, 
and finally introduced 
CUDA 
and 
OpenCL 
support, to better take 
advantage of GPUs to 
render content faster 
and more efficiently. 
CUDA is a language 
that makes the GPU 
accessible 
to 
the 
programer in a variety of applications. 
In Adobe’s case, that’s the Mercury 
Playback Engine, which lends itself to 
faster parallel processing computations, 
faster  renders, color correction, higher 
quality scaling, and more. For us, the 
best GPU for the job is the GTX 1080 Ti—
its mass of memory and the phenomenal 
number of CUDA cores makes it a sure-
fire bet for improving render times.
And, finally, there’s the scratch disks. 
Premiere allocates a unique scratch disk 
for each and every project you work on. In 
short, this is an area of disk space where 
the Creative Cloud app stores temporary 
media files while you work. You can 
choose and allocate exactly where this is 
in the Settings tab, including the scratch 
disk’s size. Setting it to a large chunk of 
PCIe storage should help decrease both 
in-app render previews and the final 
output render times significantly, when 
compared to storing your scratch disk on 
a traditional HDD.
after effects is a monster application, 
capable of everything from the simplest 
title sequences and credit rolls to more 
advanced particle effects and other 
crazy forms of media content. 
It’s quite daunting at first, but with 
a few tutorials and a quick YouTube 
search, you’ll soon be on your way to 
creating impressive intros, transitions, 
and outros. There’s little else like it at the 
consumer level.
Coming from Adobe, its computational 
prowess is similar to that of Premiere 
Pro. However, unlike Prem, which 
doesn’t benefit from access to more 
memory beyond 16GB, After Effects 
takes advantage of as much memory 
as 
you 
can 
throw 
at 
it. 
Adobe 
recommends a minimum of 2GB per 
core, HyperThreading aside. So, in a 16-
core system like ours, you should have 
a minimum of 32GB. 
Extra memory doesn’t 
hurt, 
though, 
and 
once you perform your 
final render, the more 
memory you have, the 
faster you can export 
your final effects.
Memory is shared 
between all of Adobe’s 
apps—you 
can 
run 
multiple apps at the 
same time, exporting 
from Premiere Pro, applying effects and 
color corrections in After Effects, and 
outputting via Adobe’s Media Encoder on a 
schedule, and you can allocate sufficient 
memory to each app (configurable within 
each program’s preferences). In this case, 
we’re allocating 16GB to Premiere, 96GB 
to After Effects, and the remaining 16GB 
Talking specifics
Making it Flashy

of memory to the OS and all our other 
background applications.
After Effects doesn’t use a scratch 
disk, but relies on a “Disk Cache.” Usually 
allocated to C:\Users\XXX\AppData\Local\ 
Temp, you can allocate this to a specific 
disk, and increase its size for smoother 
previews and renders.

Step-by-step guide

PG. 70
!
that’s one hell of an upgrade. We’ve 
gone from 6 to 16 cores, 32GB to 128GB 
of RAM, and 240GB to 1.2TB of PCIe SSD 
storage. We’ve also added an additional 
21TB of backup storage, swapped out to a 
larger motherboard, featuring a butt-load 
more connectivity, introduced an on-site 
RAID 1 array, and switched the Phanteks 
Eclipse P400S TG chassis for the 
masterfully crafted Evolv ATX TG. Hello, 
aluminum—boy, we’ve missed you.
But it’s performance that’s king here, 
and performance is what you get with 
such a crazy upgrade. As this is going 
to be a personal system update for our 
reviews editor, testing methodology  
and system setup are less clinical than 
with our usual builds. Typically, we do 
a fresh install of Windows 10, update it, 
then only install the programs necessary 
for benchmarking. In that way, no 
resources are held up by antivirus or 
superfluous apps, and we can get the 
best figures out of it.
In this scenario, however, there’s a 
ton of additional programs we need for 
our day-to-day work, including game 
clients, cloud sharing, LibreOffice, and 
a fair chunk of the Adobe suite. And to 
maintain benchmark integrity, the new 
build needs to mimic the old one, so 
we’ve added a few tweaks to increase 
performance: Overclocking the CPU to 
4GHz (by simply changing the ratio) was 
our first step, then tweaking the memory 
DOCP settings (think XMP, but for AMD). 
The latter was where we came 
unstuck. No matter what we tried, using 
the Asus-supported DOCP 3,200MT/s 
profile forced the system into a reboot 
loop, before resetting to default memory 
settings (2,133MT/s). We got in touch with 
Asus, and it seems that Threadripper 
only supports 128GB (8x  16GB) up to 
2,933MT/s, at the moment. Whether 
this is a limitation of the platform or it 
just requires a new AGESA update from 
AMD is yet to be established, so for the 
time being, we’re forced to run this kit at 
2,933, until support is added.
So, the figures. What a difference! 
A 230 percent gain in Cinebench, a 
phenomenal increase in decompression 
and compression speeds, and a fantastic 
improvement in real-world benchmarks. 
Those real-world figures are produced 
from a one-minute video in Premiere Pro, 
and a 12-second intro in After Effects; 
longer projects, particularly in After 
Effects, would see far more benefit from 
prolonged access to all 128GB of RAM.
For us, this system is a dream come 
true, but for the rest of the world, the 
$6,000 price tag is extortionate. However, 
a lot of the outlay is on the storage and 
memory. Given what we know now, by 
stepping down to a 64GB 3,200MT/s kit, 
and a more affordable storage solution 
(a 512GB Samsung 960 Pro, 1TB Crucial 
MX300 SSD, and two 5TB Toshiba X300 
drives), you could bring the price down to 
$3,700. Still a lot of dollar, but far easier 
to stomach for a rendering rig.
AMD has again changed the CPU world 
for the better, and with Intel responding 
with more affordable and more powerful 
cores sooner than we thought, it’s looking 
increasingly sunny for consumers.

Alex Cox and Jonni Bidwell strap 
on the goggles and enter a world 
where even hardware goes soft
Running an opeRating system on real hardware is so 
passé. All those hours ensuring your hardware is set 
up and behaving correctly? Pah. Then so many more 
hours installing and configuring all the software, so 
everything’s just right, while risking what’s on the 
machine already? Ugh. It can seem like an awful lot of 
effort just to, say, try out a Linux distribution, or create a 
clean Windows install. And, what’s worse, it can present 
you with a whole lot of extra work if something goes 
wrong. Killing your day-to-day Windows installation, 
that one you’ve spent so long lovingly streamlining 
and customizing, the one you need for work, play, and 
everything else? It doesn’t bear thinking about.
If you’re running a mission-critical system, you also 
need to figure out a backup strategy, because mistakes 
and hardware failure both happen. In fact, if you’re 
serious about these things, you’ll really want to have 
something that’s as close as possible to a mirror image 
of that machine, ready to spring into action at the first 
hint of failure. Even if you’re lucky enough to have an 
identical machine, maintaining such a thing—updates, 
drivers, software, and all—is monumentally tricky.
Contrast this with a virtual machine (VM). With a VM, 
you don’t have to worry about setting up hardware—any 
hypervisor worth its salt translates whatever machine 
it’s running on into virtual hardware that your OS can 
easily understand. You still have to set up the software 
side of things, but once done, you can replicate the 
machine at the press of a button, keeping a safe, clean 
copy for when you need it. You can test out changes by 
taking a snapshot of the machine and doing your changes 
there. If the copied VM survives, its parent will, too, as 
they’re identical. However you use your PC, the chances 
are there’s something to be gained from virtualization.

PCI Pass-through Problems
Try To run games or anything else that places any 
heavy graphical demands on a virtualBox vM, and you 
won’t have much luck. virtualBox’s 3D acceleration 
doesn’t really do anything for DirectX 10, 11, or 12 titles. 
There is a solution, but it’s one with some pretty heavy 
requirements. You need to run a linux distribution 
as your host OS, and have two graphics cards in your 
physical machine, one of which you’ll use for your 
host—integrated graphics will do—and the other 
you’ll dedicate entirely to your vM. You also need to 
have a motherboard with an iOMMu unit, a CPu that 
supports it, and iOMMu enabled in the BiOS or ueFi. 
iOMMu is essentially a translation methodology, which 
maps physical memory addresses between guests and 
hosts—on aMD machines, you need to look for aMD-
vi, and on intel, it’s intel virtualization Technology 
for Directed i/O, or vT-d. These aren’t unusual features 
for modern boards, but we recommend you check 
compatibility before you kill off your everyday OS in 
favor of a linux host.
From there, it’s a not-so-simple process of installing 
virtualBox on your host OS (after ensuring it’s running 
a kernel that’s iOMMu-compatible), adding in the PCi 
pass-through extension through the catch-all extension 
pack, which can be downloaded from www.virtualbox.
org, enabling iOMMu in your linux distro’s boot loader 
(add something such as  intel_iommu=on  to grub.cfg), 
then using the  lspci  command to check which PCi 
devices you have attached to your host hardware. 
The first column lists the PCi address of each device; 
you can then run a terminal command along the 
lines of  vBoxManage modifyvm “vM name” --pciattach 
02:00.0@01:05.0  to pass, in this case, the device at host 
address 02:00.0 to the guest address 01:05.0. Complex 
stuff, but entirely possible if you’re determined.
Want to use your GPU to its full effect with 
a VM? Pass it through....
LET’S STArT AT THE bEGInnInG: The 
easiest way to get into virtualization 
is with Oracle’s VirtualBox. It’s 
free, open source (barring some 
extensions that provide USB pass-
through), and has a friendly and 
simple GUI that enables you to set 
up a virtual machine in just a few 
clicks. Whether you want to set up 
a Windows XP VM to practice your 
hacking skills, fancy trying out a 
new Linux distro, or even if you 
want to install something far more 
weird and wonderful, it’s easy and 
intuitive with VirtualBox. Head to 
www.virtualbox.org to download the 
latest version for Windows hosts, 
and install it on your PC. We’re using 
the latest release of Ubuntu Desktop 
(download it from www.ubuntu.com/
download) to create an example VM, 
but feel free to download or use any 
other ISO you may have lying around. 
genesis of a Vm 
Start VirtualBox and click the “New” 
button at the left of the toolbar. 
Give your nascent VM a helpful or 
affectionate name—if you name it 
something like “Ubuntu-VM,” the 
software even automatically adjusts 
the “Type” and “Version” settings 
below, as well as allocating your 
VM what it considers a reasonable 
amount of memory on the next page. 
You can adjust this yourself, but don’t 
go crazy; the more RAM you give 
over to your guest system, the less 
the host has to work with.
The next step is to create a 
virtual hard disk, which is a file that 
will house our VM’s data. Choose 
“Create,” and select the default VDI 
image. In the next step, choose to 
make it “Dynamically Allocated.” 
This means the file grows as the 
virtual disk fills, rather than being a 
big, mostly empty file from the get-
go. There’s a small performance 
penalty for this luxury, so you may 
wish to opt for the more inflexible 
fixed size option if speed is a big 
concern; a plain desktop Ubuntu 
install, for example, occupies less 
than 4GB, but OSes have a habit of 
growing over time, and a Windows 10 
install would take a lot more space. 
Make sure you set the top limit of 
your virtual drive to at least 16GB, or 
more if you can spare the bytes. 
geT up and running
That’s it—machine built. You have a 
VM. But try booting it, and you won’t 
get far, since its drive is currently 
completely blank. Let’s insert a 
virtual disc and get something 
installed. Select the machine and 
click “Settings” on the toolbar. Go to 
“Storage” on the left, and you’ll see 
that a virtual optical drive (attached 
to a virtual IDE controller) has been 
set up as well as our virtual hard 
disk. Click this, then press the disc

icon on the right-hand side, and 
select “Choose Virtual Optical Disk 
File” from the drop-down menu. 
Select your downloaded Ubuntu ISO. 
Now let’s offer up some additional 
resources. In the “Settings > 
Display” section of the “Screen” tab, 
boost the Video Memory to 128MB. 
Click “OK,” and launch your VM by 
selecting it and clicking “Start.” 
You’re now free to install, or play 
in the Ubuntu live environment, 
whatever you like, in complete 
safety—there’s no way of doing 
damage to your main PC, as you’re 
operating in a completely isolated 
environment. Don’t worry about 
installation specifics—if you decide 
you want something done differently, 
it’s easy to delete the VM and start 
over. When the install finishes, the 
virtual disc is automatically ejected.
One final step to getting things 
working well: Use the “Devices” 
menu to insert VirtualBox’s guest 
additions disc into your virtual 
optical drive, and install the software 
within. Obviously, this only works for 
supported guest platforms, but once 
it’s installed, you gain access to neat 
features such as a shared clipboard 
and 
custom 
dynamic 
resizing 
options. You can also, once you head 
to the “Display” section of your VM’s 
settings, switch on 3D acceleration. 
It isn’t the best—see “PCI Pass-
Through Problems” to find out 
why—but it’s a much more pleasant 
experience than running without it.
safeTy in snapshoTs
As we’ve mentioned, the greatest 
part about running a VM is the control 
it gives you over the OS—specifically, 
the fact that once you’ve done the 
hard work of setting one up, you’ll 
never have to do it again. You’ll want 
to use two techniques: wholesale 
copying of a VM, and snapshotting. 
The former is reasonably easy. Just 
right-click a powered-down VM, and 
select “Clone.” VirtualBox creates 
an exact copy of that VM, which 
you’re free to monkey around with to 
your heart’s content, or set aside for 
later recovery. A snapshot is slightly 
different and arguably slightly more 
useful. It’s an exact copy of a running 
VM, memory state and all, giving you 
the chance to revert back to a known 
good configuration if you’re about to 
do something drastic, or to power 
down your virtual machine and 
return to the exact point you were at 
before you quit. 
VirtualBox 
can 
even 
handle 
snapshots in a tree, so you can 
create several snapshots, fork off 
in different directions, and keep the 
same core configuration. You can 
take a new snapshot at any time 
by hitting Host-T (your Host key is 
usually right-Alt), and you’re given 
the option of creating one when you 
power down a VM as well. These do 
tend to swallow up hard drive space 
after a while, so be prepared for a bit 
of periodic cleanup.
go self-conTained
Let’s take a step back now. For all 
the benefits they offer, every new 
VM spun up means a new copy of 
an operating system. This means 
lots of duplication of data and 
effort. A virtual OS still takes time 
to install, and even though this can 
be automated to some extent, most 
VMs still take some configuring 
before they’re useful. And if you’re 
using a VM for a single task, this is, 
frankly, a bit of a waste of time and 
system resources. But there’s a 
more streamlined way of isolating 
applications and services, without 
installing a whole new OS, enabled 
by the idea of containers. These 
give some access to the host OS, 
but drastically restrict access to 
anything that might break it, and 
enable applications to be deployed 
in a uniform way on any OS. Any 
sysadmin who’s had to migrate an 
old webapp to new infrastructure 
will know the special sort of pain this 
can avoid. 
The de facto king of container 
management, 
widely 
used 
and 
therefore 
widely 
supported, 
is 
Docker. Thanks to the Docker 
Hub, it’s possible to download a 
community-generated image of an 
email server, a NextCloud instance, 
a NAS appliance, or an MPD server, 
say, and have it running in a matter

of seconds. Docker’s Community 
Edition (the one we’re using here) is 
freely downloadable, and available 
for Windows 10 Pro and just about 
every Linux distro—but bear in mind 
that this means it’s not compatible 
with Windows 10 Home, the version 
most people are running. With this in 
mind, we’ll show you how to use its 
Linux flavor through Ubuntu—simply 
download and install the Community 
Edition from www.docker.com/get-
docker, then replicate the commands 
here, cutting out the “sudo” parts, 
in a Windows PowerShell window, 
and you shouldn’t run into too 
many problems.
docking for beginners
Let’s start by installing Docker on 
Ubuntu. While it’s possible to install 
through a command-line package 
manager, setting up the requisite 
repositories is a little long-winded. 
Instead, head to https://download.
docker.com/linux/ubuntu/dists/ 
and grab the latest stable version 
for your system—you’ll find a .deb 
package within the requisite /pool/ 
folder. Download it, rather than open 
it in Ubuntu’s software installer. 
Open a Terminal window, and head to 
the directory where you downloaded 
the package (typically ~/Downloads). 
Type  sudo dpkg -i docker  then, 
goIng beyond VIrtualbox
We’Ve coVered VirTualbox in detail, primarily because 
it’s free to use and pretty comprehensive in its abilities. 
For most tasks, you’re unlikely to need anything more 
complex. if you want to take virtualization further, 
though, there are a few commercial tools that can 
make the process easier and (generally) run vMs more 
efficiently. vMWare Workstation Player, free with a 
limited set of features, is a solid option, and one that’s 
compatible with the same vHDs, though you need to 
pay a license fee if you want to use it commercially. its 
level of support and development is, naturally, very 
good, it’s arguably more capable than virtualBox, and 
it’s due a major version upgrade soon, which should add 
a little spice. Check it out at www.vmware.com.
if you’re willing to create a dedicated host, it’s 
also worth considering linux-based solutions. QeMu 
(www.qemu.org) is available for just about every 
linux distribution, and it’s super-efficient, executing 
as much of the guest code as it can directly on the 
host machine, through a process known as dynamic 
binary translation. it’s also able to run without admin 
privileges, meaning you can tuck your QeMu vMs 
away on a flash drive, carry them around with you, and 
return to a familiar environment no matter which host 
machine you’re running on. There’s a version compiled 
for Windows, if you’re feeling adventurous—see  
http://qemu.weilnetz.de for the downloads. 
While we’re in the linux world, picking a distro 
based on the Xen hypervisor is a good choice for 
experimentation. Check out Qubes OS (www.qubes-os.
org), which dubs itself “a reasonably secure operating 
system” with a typical lack of hubris. all of its apps run 
in one of a number of vMs, completely isolating them 
from the others for security and efficiency reasons, and 
you can add your own vMs—including those based on a 
number of different linux architectures and, naturally, 
virtual machines based on Windows.
before hitting Return, hit Tab to 
complete the name of the package 
you just downloaded. Hit Return, and 
the installation should happen. Let’s 
check that it did: Fire up the Docker 
daemon with  sudo systemctl start 
docker , then run  sudo docker run 
hello-world . All being well, this 
pulls in a sample script and executes 
it—if you see a cheery message, 
you’re good to go.
Time to install something that 
does more than just display a 
message. Run  sudo docker pull 
nextcloud  to grab a container 
encapsulating everything required 
to run a NextCloud file server. At 
700MB, it’s fairly large, but bear in 
mind the NextCloud app is 100MB, 
plus we’ve got Apache, PHP 7, and a 
bunch of extensions, along with the 
SQLite database packaged in with 
it, all ready to go. Run the container 
with  sudo docker run -d -name 
maxcloud -p 8080:80 nextcloud  . 
The “-d” option tells Docker to run 
in the background (detached), and 
the “-p” part forwards port 80 on 
the container to port 8080 on our 
host. The “-name” part is optional; a 
random one is assigned if you don’t 
specify one here.
Assuming that command didn’t 
give you any error messages, fire 
up your web browser, and browse 
to http:// localhost:8080. Behold!

serIous VIrtual maChInes
if you begin To rely on virtual machines to a serious 
extent, enterprise-grade solutions are probably worth a 
look. The industry standard for virtualized servers is 
vMWare’s eSXi tech—available free in a package called 
vSphere Hypervisor—and Microsoft also offers up its 
Hyper-v Server 2016 without charge. Both solutions run 
a similar model: a complete hypervisor running at the 
OS level, and nothing else. in the terms we’ve used in 
this feature, they’re your host operating systems, but 
they do nothing more than host, giving their guests 
unprecedented access to system hardware, and giving 
you high-level access to the administrative tools 
you need to maintain a server full of temperamental 
yet critical systems. Typically, home users boot the 
likes of eSXi from a small local drive, such as a uSB 
stick or an SD card, with vMs stored on mass storage 
devices elsewhere.
as you might expect, running server-class software 
generally requires running server-class hardware 
to match. Of course, you’re free to install vSphere 
Hypervisor on a uSB stick and attempt to run it on 
hardware you may have on hand, and we’ve certainly 
heard tales of it working, though this isn’t incredibly 
likely, unfortunately. luckily, the unstoppable march 
of progress means that businesses are constantly 
upgrading their equipment, meaning you can often 
grab suitable rack-mount hardware for a fraction of its 
original cost if you shop around on eBay. Naturally, 
your power bill will rise, they’re noisy and hot as all 
hell, and you’ll need somewhere to put it, but a dual-
CPu Xeon system, packed with raM, could cost as 
little as $150 if you’re lucky enough to find one locally. 
Check the compatibility list at www.vmware.com/
resources/compatibility to see whether you’re likely to 
be able to easily fire up a set of vMs—and then check 
your wallet, because playing home sysadmin can be an 
expensive hobby.
with  sudo docker stop maxcloud , 
any changes are saved, unless the 
underlying image is upgraded, so 
you can resume it as it was with  
 sudo docker start maxcloud  in 
future. Note: We use our container 
name, rather than the image name 
(nextcloud), 
because 
the 
latter 
would fire off a new, unconfigured 
NextCloud instance.
physical To VirTual
As you’ve got this far, you’re probably 
starting to appreciate the value 
there is in virtualization. But there’s 
one more thing we haven’t touched 
upon, and that’s consolidation. One 
machine with a number of virtualized 
instances running on it can do the 
job of several physical units without 
the need for any extra hardware. If 
you’re in the mood to replace that 
old file server and trash that Win XP 
box that really should have been 
recycled 10 years back, there’s good 
news: You don’t need to completely 
rebuild those systems in a virtual 
environment. You can convert their 
hard drives to virtual drives, and fire 
them up in VirtualBox as though they 
were newly created VMs. 
Note that this does come with a 
couple of downsides, namely that 
Windows may need a little poking 
before it accepts your new virtual 
hardware, and that you’ll almost 
certainly invoke a new activation of 
your Windows key when you fire up 
its virtual version—major hardware 
changes tend to do that, so you 
need to erase the old hardware, 
and perhaps contact Microsoft to 
arrange reactivation. Note also that 
transferring an OEM installation of 
Windows to a virtual instance is a 
violation of the terms and conditions 
of installation, so you’re unlikely to 
get much assistance in this case.
To convert an existing installation, 
we recommend using Disk2VHD, a 
tool from Microsoft’s Sysinternals 
team. The process is really pretty 
simple. Download Disk2VHD from 
http://bit.ly/2wILzb4 and run it. 
Define the file name you want to 
give to your virtual drive, and pick 
the volumes you want to clone. 
Disk2VHD leaves your partition 
tables intact, but you can exclude the 
data of certain partitions if you want 
to keep the size down. Switch off 
VHDX, hit “Create,” and Disk2VHD 
uses 
Windows’ 
own 
Volume 
Snapshot tools to create a byte-
by-byte copy of your chosen drive. 
When it’s done, fire up VirtualBox, 
make yourself a new VM with the 
appropriate parameters for your 
cloned OS, then enter Expert mode, 
and select your .vhd file in the bottom 
box. Boot, and you’ll be away—don’t 
forget to install the Guest Additions 
for the best experience. Oh, and one 
more thing: Did you know you can 
mount VHD files natively in Windows 
using the Disk Management tool? 
There’s something to try.... 
Try attaching a VHD using Disk Management—you can 
also create VHDs with this tool.
Use Expert 
mode to 
quickly attach 
a cloned drive 
to a new VM in 
Virtualbox.

How do you define “enthusiast”? It’s 
a question we ask a lot, because it’s 
challenging to keep ourselves on track. 
It’s all too easy to go with the expensive, 
like the Hellcats and the Ferraris of  
this world, as opposed to the affordable. 
The unattainable is often the most 
desired. And as brands push their 
halo products on to us to showcase 
to the world, in an effort to secure an 
engineering reputation for the rest of 
their lineups derived from higher up, 
it’s all too easy to become distracted by 
the glitter and the glam.
For us, however, the term enthusiast 
means more than that. It’s more than 
whether you can afford whatever 
component you desire. It’s about how 
passionate you are for the work you 
produce, the content you create, the 
hobbies in which you partake, and the 
community of which you’re a part.
Threadripper belongs very much 
in that echelon. It’s designed to wow, 
and to be used by professionals. 
And with it comes a plethora of high-
end motherboards, all designed to 
take advantage of the monstrous 
connectivity 
and 
performance 
associated with those eight cores and 
beyond. And the best of the bunch? 
Asus’s ROG Zenith Extreme. The 
pinnacle of what you can achieve on 
a 
motherboard

performance, 
connectivity, and aesthetics, it’s nothing 
short of a dream. –ZAK SToREy

Of course, it wouldn’t be a high-end board without

The blockchain and the Internet 
have spawned cryptocurrency, 
and it’s here to stay
O 
n January 3, 2009, a programer (or programers) 
working under the pseudonym Satoshi Nakamoto 
launched something remarkable: a new form of 
money, a digital cryptocurrency called Bitcoin. 
The idea was that Bitcoin would be completely independent 
of outside forces—no banks, no governments. It would be a 
distributed method of wealth that required no trusted third 
party to verify transfers or hold money. Supply was limited, 
to combat inflation. A simple idea done with clever math.
Cryptocurrencies run on a peer-to-peer system. 
Transactions take place between two parties without 
intermediaries, verified by horribly involved calculations. 
This math is based on public-key cryptography; put very 
simply, each transaction is verified by the completion 
of a series of cryptographic puzzles, and added to 
the blockchain. The blockchain is the ledger, which is 
distributed and checked by the network. To reward those 
who do the hard work of maintaining the ledger, they are 
paid in coins—as you “mine,” you run the network. 
The math may be complex, and the concept big, but in 
use, it’s fairly easy. Create a wallet with public and private 
cryptographic keys, and you can buy and transfer coins. At 
first glance, there’s one clear problem: no collateral at all. 
Bitcoin is built on sand and trust, yet it works….

TOp crypTOcurrencies yOu can mine
Bitcoin was the first 
and is by far the largest 
cryptocurrency, with a 
market capitalization 
of $70-odd billion. 
However, it has 
spawned many more, 
and these are the 
current biggest 
alternatives. Values 
here are, as ever, 
volatile as anything.
EthErEum
Launched in 2015 and 
subject to huge recent 
growth, Ethereum is 
currently worth about 
$28 billion. It uses a 
scripting language that 
can be executed over 
the network, making 
it a platform for other 
applications. 
Bitcoin cash
Split from Bitcoin 
earlier this year, 
Bitcoin Cash’s coins 
are currently under 
10 percent of the value 
of the originals, worth 
$4.9 billion as a whole. 
It uses a larger block 
size to increase speed.
LitEcoin
Worth over $2 billion, 
Litecoin is technically 
very similar to Bitcoin, 
although tweaked to be 
faster—transactions 
are currently about 
four times quicker. It 
was launched in 2011, 
which makes it one of 
the old-timers. 
Dash
Worth about $1.7 
billion, Dash is 
similar to Bitcoin, 
but uses a two-tier 
structure of miners 
and masternodes, 
with a decentralized 
governance.
e
nthusiastic early adopters got the 
Bitcoin gears turning, but the initial 
value of the coins was negligible and 
negotiable, and they were traded between 
friends. The first cited proper purchase 
was in May 2010, for two pizzas, at a cost of 
10,000 coins. 
In July 2010, a Bitcoin was worth eight 
cents. By early 2011, it achieved parity 
with the dollar. Early this year, it reached 
parity with gold. Since then, it has gone 
well beyond that. As we type this, a Bitcoin 
is worth $4,159. Those pizzas cost the 
equivalent of over $41 million today. While 
that quick calculation was being made, 
Bitcoin jumped to $4,202, and then back to 
$4,130. Valuable, but also terribly volatile. 
There have been some spectacular slumps 
along the way, the value halving or worse a 
number of times. 
Money is trust, and to be worth anything, 
it must be transferable to goods or other 
currencies. At first, you would have to talk 
a merchant into accepting it; now, Bitcoin 
has reached a turning point, depending on 
where you are in the world. It is not fully 
integrated with the banking system, or even 
legal tender, yet it can be spent.
The United States Department of the 
Treasury classifies cryptocurrencies as 
virtual currencies, and therefore not under 
its remit; however, their generation counts 
as money transmitters. Last year, a federal 
judge ruled that Bitcoins are “funds within 
the plain meaning of the term.” So, it is 
money. In China, individuals can trade in 
Bitcoins, but the banks cannot. 
Elsewhere in the world, it ranges from 
being completely illegal to being widely 
accepted as money. Generally, it is treated 
as “private money,” not legal tender, but 
is still wealth, and subject to the same 
taxation. One acid test for money is whether 
you can pay your taxes with it. That next step 
has been taken. From April this year, Japan 
started counting Bitcoin as legal tender. 
Russia, Germany, and others reportedly 
have plans for similar steps. Bitcoin is on the 
verge of going fully legit. Full government 
approval inevitably leads to regulations at 
some point, or attempts, anyway. 
Until legislation fully catches up with 
cryptocurrencies, you are operating largely 
outside the traditional financial framework, 
and therefore the legal protection of the 
central banks and governments. You are 
pretty much on your own if things go wrong. 
Don’t panic, though; Bitcoin has amassed 
enough adherents to be respectably stable.  
Another acid test for money is whether 
you can swap it for other money, preferably 
the green folding kind. To do this, you need to 
go to a Bitcoin exchange. There are some 64 
of these worldwide, and levels of security, 
privacy, and control vary. Over the years, a 
number have had their security breached, 
gone bankrupt, or, in at least one case, 
simply disappeared with all the funds. This 
is where that democratic and distributed—
and hence loosely regulated—aspect of 
cryptocurrencies 
can 
look 
worryingly 
fragile. Some research is recommended 
before you start making large transactions. 
Scary? A little, but the cowboys are rapidly 
being weeded out.
The 
days 
of 
these 
unregulated 
exchanges 
may 
well 
be 
numbered, 
anyway. Becoming legal tender opens the 
way for the traditional financial institutions 
to start trading in Bitcoin. Increasingly, it 
is becoming yet another cog in the wheels 
of international business. This summer, 
the Swiss bank Falcon added Bitcoins to 
its accounts—customers can now buy and 
hold them in their own accounts. At the 
end of August, this was expanded to Ether, 
Litecoin, and Bitcoin Cash, too. Amazon, 
Apple, and Google are all working on 
integrating Bitcoin services. Widespread 
adoption is coming quickly.
Meanwhile, there are more than a 
few technical problems to deal with. 
The increasingly technical complexity of 
transactions has begun to drag. Currently, a 
Bitcoin transaction takes about 20 minutes 
to process; occasionally, an hour or more. 
On smaller deals, merchants often ignore 
this, and take the payment on trust—if 
you are buying a fancy new watch, you’ll 
probably have to wait.
This, along with the attendant meager 
results when mining, has helped spark 
a bit of a civil war in the Bitcoin camp, 
which led to it being split in two. A clone of 
Bitcoin was created—Bitcoin Cash—which 
altered the math to allow for much faster 
transitions. A software update is also due 
this fall—Segwit2x—aimed at addressing 
the speed issue as well. This is also causing 
conniptions, and a second split is in the air. 
Changes to the underlying code have huge 
effects on the whole edifice. 
The decentralized nature of Bitcoin was 
designed to ensure no single failure would 
have much impact, and no single player 
could dictate terms. That has been eroded 
considerably now; huge swathes of the

EthErEum cLassic
This was born out of a 
fork of Ethereum after 
the DAO Ethereum 
spin-off project had 
$50 of its Ether tokens 
stolen. The Classic is 
the original Ethereum 
blockchain, and is worth 
about $1.3 billion.
BitconnEct
A newcomer, launched 
in February 2016, 
BitConnect has seen 
huge growth since, 
with coins jumping 
1,800 percent in six 
months, and currently 
worth $765m in total. 
BitConnect includes the 
facility to earn interest 
on lent coins.
monEro
Based on different 
technology to Bitcoin 
and a fork of Bytecoin, 
Monero experienced 
huge growth thanks 
in part to its use on 
the darknet market 
AlphaBay (now 
defunct). Currently 
worth about $765m.
Zcash
Under a year old 
and already worth 
$452 million, Zcash’s 
blockchain can hide 
the amounts and 
recipients, or make 
selective disclosures to 
third parties—useful 
for complying with 
money-laundering or 
tax regulations.
BytEcoin
Not to be confused 
with Bitcoin (BCN 
versus BTE). The first 
currency based on the 
CryptoNote protocol, 
which is behind a 
number of coins. Old for 
a cryptocurrency, it’s 
been around since 2012, 
and is currently valued 
at $255 million.
network run in large data centers. Salcido 
Enterprises is building a data center in 
North Washington that will consume 7.5MW 
of hydro-electric power. Going further up 
the scale, in Xinjiang province in China, a 
major player called Bitmain is building a 
data center that will consume up to 135MW 
of power, and Bitcoin mining will be its main 
job. Bitcoin has come a long way from its 
hobbyist roots.
Bitcoin has an intrinsic limit of 21 million 
coins, which is expected to be more or less 
reached by around 2040, although it’ll take 
a lot longer to mine the very last block. What 
happens then could be awkward. By this 
point, the complexity of the blockchain will 
be considerable, and there will be no new 
coins to pay for running things. Transaction 
fees at some point look inevitable. 
As a cryptocurrency “matures,” it 
increasingly falls under the control of 
those with the computing power to run it. 
Control over the supposed democratic and 
distributed currency gathers around the 
big data centers and the exchanges. It’s 
an old story: The “kids” come along with 
something cool, and the “suits” take it away, 
commercialize it, and sell it back. Man. 
However, digital money’s full integration 
into mainstream financial markets is 
hampered by its very nature. The markets 
like centralized exchanges and institutions, 
and don’t like volatile currencies. 
Rapid changes in value are not too much 
of an issue when ordering pizza, but a 
corporation making a big international 
payment won’t like to see percentage 
swings in value of the currency used over 
the minutes or hours it takes to verify a 
payment, which could be millions of dollars 
either way.
The central concept of the blockchain 
is proven, though. A number of currencies 
have been created that cannot be mined, but 
concentrate on the business of transfers. 
They launch with a fixed number of tokens. 
The biggest of these is Ripple, currently 
worth over $6.1 billion. The aim is similar 
to Bitcoin: seamless and easy transfers 
of any currency to anywhere else, with 
no third-party fees or involvement. It 
positions itself as a complement to, not a 
rival of, Bitcoin. Transactions go through 
in seconds, which alleviates the problem of 
the currency’s value bouncing around too 
much. It’s designed specifically with banks 
and business in mind, citing better security 
and scalability than Bitcoin and its ilk. You 
can trade in these business-orientated 
cryptocurrencies 
on 
the 
exchanges,

The blOckchain
It’s a little complicated. 
And it should be—it’s 
cryptography. Every 
requested transaction 
is packaged into a block 
with a timestamp, and 
broadcast to every 
machine on the network, 
the nodes, to be verified. 
Once it is, the transaction 
goes through, the block 
is added to the chain, and 
all nodes are updated with 
the new longer chain. This 
blockchain is essentially a 
list of transactions. 
To verify a transaction, 
the chain must be checked 
to ensure sufficient 
coins have been added 
to your account to cover 
the output. These are 
then not considered valid 
for future transactions. 
Coins are kept in a wallet 
application, protected by 
cryptographic keys—one 
public, one private. Your 
transaction is encrypted 
using your private key and 
the recipient’s public one, 
to ensure only they can 
receive it, and they know 
it’s from you
Before a block can be 
added to the chain, each 
must contain the answer 
to a complicated math 
problem, created using 
a one-way cryptographic 
hash function, which 
essentially turns input into 
a mass of tangled data. To 
unlock this requires the 
network to guess a number 
which, combined with the 
previous block, gives the 
correct answer. Thus, each 
block is cryptographically 
locked to the previous one. 
These puzzles take 
considerable power to 
unlock. To reward those 
who go through the hard 
work, successful solutions 
receive Bitcoins. Each 
block can contain multiple 
transactions, limited by 
the block size: currently 
1MB, with typically 1,700 
transactions for a Bitcoin. 
The difficulty level is 
periodically recalculated, 
to ensure security is 
maintained, and that 
each block takes about 
10 minutes to process. 
Every four years, the block 
reward is halved—it’s 
currently 12.5 coins. 
Security is tight. 
Nodes only accept the 
longest verified chain, 
and any erroneous block 
quickly disappears. 
To force the system 
to accept a modified 
transaction would involve 
taking on the combined 
mathematical power of 
all the nodes. Blockchain 
technology isn’t limited to 
cryptocurrencies; coins 
can represent anything, 
such as shares, copyright 
registrations, digital 
identities, contracts, 
votes, or anything else you 
want to keep on a secure 
verifiable ledger. Or the 
tokens can be the data 
itself—distributed secure 
cloud storage is being 
worked on. You are going 
to hear a lot more about 
blockchain apps.
but there’s none of the fun of mining, or 
watching values bounce around.
Mining coins offers the tantalizing 
prospect of “free” money, and it’s this 
aspect of cryptocurrencies that catches the 
eye of many. Fortunes made by adopters of 
the first currencies have fueled a healthy 
interest in new launches. Getting in early 
is key: Hit on a coin that rises, be one of 
the first to mine, and you’re a millionaire 
in days. Yeah, well, probably not. It’s not 
2012 anymore, and anything that looks to 
have a chance of being remotely successful 
has serious computing power thrown at it 
in short order. Despite what the sellers of 
mining machines may say, it is a tenuous 
business to run on a small scale, unless you 
hit the right vein.
Any cryptography can be broken. The early 
years saw a number of large losses. In 2014, 
650,000 coins were stolen from what was at 
the time the biggest exchange—Mt. Gox, 
in Japan—leading to its bankruptcy, and 
the halving of Bitcoin’s value. Technology 
is improving, but there will always be the 
shadow of hacks, as there is in all electronic 
banking systems, generally originating 
from inside the company. The foundations 
of Bitcoin have proved to be robust enough 
to survive early glitches, though. 
As with any digital property, duplication 
is easy. If there can be one, there can 
be many. There are currently over 600 
cryptocurrencies, 
and 
frequent 
new 
launches. Their values drop as you scroll 
down the lists, from Bitcoin’s billions 
to virtually nothing for new contenders. 
There’s Titcoin, which is, ahem, designed to 
pay for “adult services.” And PotCoin, which 
is, well, you guessed. Others are just plain 
scams. At the bottom of the market, it’s like 
a frontier town out west: wild. 
Last year, one of the senior Bitcoin 
developers, Mike Hearn, rather publicly 
left, and told the world why. He claimed it 
was a “failed experiment.” He bemoans 
the fact that, while founded on libertarian 
principles, 
Bitcoin 
was 
effectively 
controlled by five people who have the 
authority to change the source code, and 
that there was much dissent between 
them. The other problem he cited were 
the big miners: 95 percent of the network 
is controlled by a handful of people with 
big data centers. “The fundamentals are 
broken, and whatever happens to the price 
in the short term, the long-term trend 
should probably be downward.” 
His 
points 
about 
the 
control 
of 
Bitcoin are valid; his prediction on price 
is anybody’s guess. However, Bitcoin is 
increasingly looking to be a solid bet in

mining cOins
Mining Bitcoins means 
running the SHA256 double 
round hash verification 
process, the math that 
verifies each block in the 
chain. Complete a block, 
and you are rewarded 
with a portion of a coin. 
Essentially, your processing 
power is converted into 
coins. The main cost is the 
electricity burnt to run the 
hardware. To help take 
some of the randomness out 
of hitting the solutions to 
each block, it’s best to join a 
mining pool, where efforts 
and rewards are spread.
In the early days, an 
average PC could do the 
job—the blockchain was 
short and the math simpler. 
Fat chance now; you really 
need Application-Specific 
Integrated Circuits, or ASIC 
machines. These rigs pack 
the required mathematical 
power but are otherwise 
pared down to the minimum. 
Mining power is measured 
in hashes per second (the 
base operation of the 
cryptography). These days, 
this is expressed in trillions 
of hashes per second (TH/s). 
Probably more important 
is efficiency: watts per 
gigahash (W/GH). Powerful 
machines are not cheap—a 
14TH/s box running at  
0.1W/GH would set you back 
$2,750 or so. Older and 
smaller machines are much 
cheaper—$200 or so—but 
are horribly inefficient. 
Margins are tight, and the 
field of play very fluid. It’s 
a delicate balance between 
profit and loss, and only the 
latest and most efficient 
hardware has a chance to 
run profitably.
Still want to mine? If 
you’re serious, you’ll need 
an air-conditioned room, 
with substantial racks of 
the latest ASIC machines, 
and a friendly electricity 
company. Too much? You 
can run a box or two at 
home, or cobble together 
custom rigs using high-end 
graphics cards. You don’t 
have to own the hardware 
yourself; cloud mines rent 
out capacity. You pay so 
much per TH/s, and hope it’s 
less than the returns. 
New cryptocurrencies 
are a gamble; modest 
hardware may return lots 
of coins, which the market 
may then decide are near 
worthless. Accusations 
of scams abound, and 
many clones of current 
blockchains are launched, 
and many flounder. Yes, 
you could hit a winner early 
and win big, but the mining 
world is pretty savvy now, 
and competition fierce. Or 
you could stick to one of 
the established coins, and 
find you’ve turned $500 
of electricity into $300 of 
coins. It happens.
ASIC machines do the 
majority of mining now. This 
is an Antminer S9, capable of 
13.5TH/s. The other product 
is heat. Serious farms need 
air conditioning—or, better 
yet, they operate near the 
Arctic Circle.
Cryptocurrency mining has 
recently led to a scarcity of 
certain graphics cards, such as 
AMD’s Radeon RX480.
Asus’s forthcoming B250 Mining 
Expert board will offer a staggering 19 
expansion slots, in order to fit as many 
GPUs as possible in a single system.
the long term. A number of big players 
have made considerable investments in 
cryptocurrencies: venture capital names 
and hedge fund managers, through to key 
figures in the tech business. 
Snapchat’s Jeremy Liew went as far as 
postulating a Bitcoin value of $500,000 by 
2030. If that sounds optimistic, he is not 
alone. Facebook’s Chamath Palihapitiya 
said that “it’s the ultimate insurance policy 
against autocracy, currency curbs, and 
other forms of value destruction.” The 
digital version of gold under the bed, in  
case all else fails. Cryptocurrencies are 
popular in countries that have experienced 
financial disasters, such as hyperinflation, 
or 
have 
lived 
under 
oppressive 
governments. Not quite what its originators 
had aimed for, but still. Big names invite 
confidence, and it’s this that keeps Bitcoin 
and its friends afloat. Bill Gates believes in 
it, and that’s good enough for most.
Predictions of any authority on the 
cryptocurency market in the short term are 
next to impossible. It is young and volatile, 
and we can expect more spikes and crashes 
along the way. As markets mature, they 
tend to coalesce. Many smaller currencies 
will fade. Can Bitcoin make it? In one 
form or other, probably. Most likely as 
an investment unit; it’s just too slow in its 
current form for everyday money transfers. 
It may not remain the main player, but it’s 
attracted enough investments to ensure it 
can survive pretty heavy weather.
There are some terribly enthusiastic 
supporters for Bitcoin. They talk of a 
revolution, of values hitting $250,000 a 
coin by 2020. A tantalizing possibility. 
Given its limited supply, it would take much 
investment capital moving from gold or 
shares into Bitcoin to send values skyward. 
It has reached a point for many where a coin 
or two in a balanced portfolio is well worth 
considering. Bitcoin cannot be manipulated 
by governments; you cannot simply create 
more. Soon it will be readily tradable for 
goods and services, and be part of the 
monetary system. Then you may well be 
glad you have one. There are issues, which 
Mike Hearn highlighted. It may be free from 
government control, but it is still under 
control, and currently by a rather small 
group. There are interesting times ahead. 
Yes, Bitcoin could crash and burn, but so 
can any monetary system.
It’s clear that digital currency is here 
to stay. To those raised on hard cash and 
checkbooks, cryptocurrencies look odd. 
There’s no collateral, nothing underneath. 
But the genie is out of the bottle, and our 
kids won’t know a world without them. 
Meanwhile, there’s one clear winner: 
Satoshi Nakamoto. He/she/they mined a lot 
of the early coins, a million or so.

It’s been a crazy month, with a lot 
of ups and downs, reshuffles at the 
mag, and settling into new positions. 
I’ve been itching to get into the video 
scene for a while, but finding the time 
to do so has been challenging. My job 
is intense, and it’s rare for me to find 
time outside of my regular duties. That 
said, I’m moving to a new position, and 
now have a little leeway (basically, 
I’m using my Saturdays) to hopefully 
produce video content for that old book 
of faces, and maybe even YouTube. 
Let’s be frank: Maximum PC has been 
around for a while now, and the fact we 
don’t have some form of regular digital 
content online outside of PC Gamer’s 
hardware site is a little disheartening. 
This is something I plan to rectify, 
with help from my executive editor, 
Alan Dexter. Thing is, we’re going to 
need a fairly beefy machine. The less 
time spent rendering, the better.
As we received two Threadripper 
parts with our review sample, and as 
we have a habit of holding on to our 
more affordable, mid-range parts for 
future features, it’d be a shame not 
to use that 16-core CPU. So, farewell 
Core i7-5820K workstation, and hello 
AMD Threadripper. More than doubling 
the thread count and increasing 
memory to 128GB of DDR4, with a few 
other choice components from last 
year’s Dream Machine, we should have 
the perfect proving ground for those 
video antics of ours.
Measuring ryzen TeMps 
Fed up with Ryzen temperatures measuring 20 degrees higher 
than they actually are? We are. If you head to www.hwinfo.com 
and download the free hardware analysis tool, you can deduce 
accurate Ryzen temperatures without worrying about AMD’s 
ridiculous offset. On top of that, once you’ve installed HWInfo, 
it seems HWMonitor also accounts for that temperature offset, 
too. It’s just a shame it doesn’t work at the BIOS level.

BACKGROUND
Microsoft’s hardware is having an identity crisis. The company 
calls this new Surface Pro “the most versatile laptop,” which 
means that this apparent tablet is actually a laptop (that can 
transform into a Studio Surface). Tell ya what, Microsoft, we’re 
going to reach deep inside and see if we can help.
MAJOR TECH SPECS
•  12.3-inch IPS PixelSense display with 2736x1824 resolution 
(267 ppi)
•  Intel Kaby Lake Core m3 (4M Cache, 2.7GHz) up to Core i7 
(4M Cache, 4.0GHz) CPU
•  4GB/8GB/16GB 1,600MHz DDR3L RAM
•  128GB/256GB/512GB/1TB of solid-state storage
•  8MP rear-facing 1080p camera, and 5MP front-facing 1080p 
Windows Hello camera
•  USB 3.0 port, microSD slot, Mini DisplayPort, and 
SurfaceConnect charging port.
•  802.11a/b/g/n/ac Wi-Fi, Bluetooth 4.1
KEY FINDINGS
•  We start looking for differences and pick out a whopper: 
Microsoft has traded away the removable blade SSD for 
more battery real estate. There goes the sole upgradable 
feature from last year’s model. Less exciting differences 
include a more spidery heatsink design, four-cell instead of 
two-cell battery, and svelte new black color scheme. The 
back of the display houses chips that look suspiciously 
similar to the N-trig modules found in the Surface Pro 4. 
•  Microsoft claims to have wholly redesigned the passive 
cooling, to allow both the Core m3 and Core i5 models to 
run 100 percent fanless, instead of just the m3 model, like 
last year. It looks as though most of the improvement came 
from shaping the heatsink like a certain Zerg unit. With the 
heatsink out of the way, we still have to remove a couple of 
components before the motherboard is free. It’s trapped 
under one speaker and a sensor/camera bezel.
•  If we learned anything from the last Surface Pro we tore 
down, it’s that the battery is a pain to remove, and it doesn’t 
go back quite the same. So, we’re gonna keep it glued in. 
This four-cell LiPo measures in at 45Wh (7.57V x 5,940mAh). 
That’s nearly an 18 percent increase in battery capacity (and 
100 percent increase in cell count) over the previous model. 
To compare Apples to Apples, sorry, Surfaces, the 10.5-inch 
iPad Pro sports a 30.8Wh battery.
•  All told, it’s nearly identical to its predecessor—aside from 
ditching the last remaining upgradable component, the 
modular SSD. Yeah, Microsoft impressed us—by being way 
worse than we expected. We also took a look at the Core i7 
Surface Pro, and there’s not much difference, but the 
mysterious empty space under the heatsink is filled with 
extra cooling power in the form of a fan. 
•  Repairability Score: 1 out of 10 (10 is easiest to repair). 
Although we like connectors, the ones here aren’t standard, 
making display removal tricky; the procedure is simplified 
by the use of thin foam adhesive and a fused display, but is 
still not trivial. Adhesive holds many components in place, 
including the display and battery. Replacement of any part 
requires removal of the display assembly, an easy part to 
damage. The SSD is no longer replaceable. 
Even the Core i5 doesn’t require active cooling.

Build Your Own 
Darknet with Tor
1
Stealthy onionS
To keep your hidden service hidden, you need to use “stealth” 
onion services. In brief, the way this works is that you generate 
a unique .onion address for each individual user of your website 
[image a], in addition to an authentication “cookie.” 
>> In order to connect to your Tor hidden service, users need 
both this unique .onion address and the cookie. Any other person 
or service simply sees a message saying that it failed to connect.
>> The steps in the “Set Up Your Darknet Site” walkthrough 
(pg. 63) cover generating unique authentication cookies and onion 
addresses for your contacts [image B]. You need to help them 
configure their Tor Browser Bundle on computer and/or mobile 
device to store the cookie, so they can access your service. Do this 
by modifying the “torrc” configuration file inside their Tor software. 
2
Super tailS
For this project, we’re using TAILS (The Amnesiac Incognito 
Live System). This OS has been designed with privacy in 
mind. All connections are routed through the Tor network, so 
there’s less danger of leaking your real IP address.
>> TAILS is designed chiefly for Internet users who want to access 
the darknet by booting from a USB or DVD, and loading into their 
RAM memory. The advantage of this is that after the machine 
restarts, there’s no trace left of your Internet activity.
>> The downside to this, of course, is that there is data you may 
want to save, such as passwords and email addresses. For this 
reason, TAILS comes with an optional “persistent” mode when 
installed on USB stick, to store such data. 
>> The “Persistent” section is encrypted, and you need to set a 
password to unlock it each time you boot TAILS. Follow the steps 
in the “Setting Up TAILS” boxout (pg. 62) to do this. Your website 
Tor enables you To seT up a “hidden service” on the darknet. This involves setting up a server 
using Apache2 software, and generating a .onion address, so that other Tor users can connect. By 
default, anyone in possession of the address, such as www.facebookcorewwwi.onion, can connect 
to a Tor hidden service. For big sites, such as Facebook, there’s no harm in this, because everyone 
knows who owns the site, and its business model thrives on people connecting and sharing data.
For private citizens in various parts of the world, who are subject to monitoring of web traffic, 
the very fact that they’ve downloaded server software is recorded by their ISP, as is the fact they 
are using Tor. This means that setting up a Tor hidden service anonymously is tricky. Even once it’s 
up and running, other people connecting to it risk that one of Tor’s nodes has been compromised, 
and will record that .onion address. Malicious web crawlers, such as PunkSPIDER, have even been 
able to map the entire Tor darknet, checking hidden services for vulnerabilities. This in itself is not 
a major security concern, because knowing the address of a website is only the first step to hacking 
into its server, but if you only want to share information with a limited group of people, there is a way 
to prevent rogue scanners from connecting automatically to your hidden service, and discovering 
your server’s real IP address. Read on…. –Nate Drake

onionShare 
This generates a unique .onion 
address for your contacts to 
download your files:  
https://onionshare.org.
and any associated files are stored safely inside the 
“Persistent” section. This hugely increases the physical 
security of your server, because the drive is encrypted, and 
you can easily remove or destroy it.

lightweight Server
Tor can work seamlessly with a variety of server 
software. This project focuses on Nginx-light 
which, as the name suggests, is a bare-bones version of the 
more full-featured Nginx. The server software works on 
the basis of HTTP modules, which support basic websites, 
but not more advanced features, such as mail. This tutorial 
works just as well with the full version of Nginx, although 
increasing your attack surface could make your server 
more vulnerable.
>> If you want to have extra features for your server, such 
as email, simply substitute “nginx-light” with “nginx-full” 
in the scripts.

getting Started
TAILS is not designed primarily to work as a server, 
although there are plans to introduce this ability 
as a feature in the future. However, because it’s based on 
Debian Linux, you can install all the programs you need to 
turn it into one.
>> The Debian Project is also good enough to host a mirror 
of its servers on the darknet. Given certain governments’ 
decision to monitor all Internet traffic, this is a great relief 
for some people, because as you’ll be installing via Tor

hidden services, it’s virtually impossible for anyone to tell you’re 
downloading server software in the first place.
>> Follow the steps in the boxout over the page to make sure TAILS 
connects to the darknet using “bridges.” This makes it harder for 
your ISP to detect you’re running a hidden service. 
>> At this point in time, TAILS cannot be run headlessly—that is, 
without a monitor, keyboard, and mouse—so be sure to choose a 
machine you won’t need while your hidden service is running. This 
also means that you need to be present each time TAILS boots up, 
to enter passwords and restore your data. 
>> The TAILS website says that at least a 4GB USB stick is required 
to run the OS. Play it safe, and choose at least an 8GB one, because 
hopefully your website will grow over time. 
>> Before following the step-by-step guide (pg. 63), note down the 
people who will be accessing your service, and ask each of them 
either to install the Tor Browser Bundle on their machines and/or 
Orbot on their Android device. You can always remove or add more 
users later on if you wish. 
5
Set up your weBSite
The “Set Up Your Darknet Site” walkthrough outlines how 
to create a basic index page to let you know the server is 
working correctly—however, after going to all this trouble, you will 
probably want more than this.
>> Tor hidden services can host most kinds of websites, 
though given that you’re running yours from a USB stick, the 
more lightweight the better. If, for instance, you want to run an 
imageboard, consider using vichan [image C], which is a fork of the 
now defunct tinyboard. Refer to each program’s project page to see 
whether any additional software is required, such as MySQL. If so, 
be sure to modify your “restore” script (see above) to make sure this 
can be automatically installed each time you restart TAILS.

loCk down your Server
Once your hidden service is up and running, 
consider installing a basic firewall by opening 
Terminal and running  sudo apt-get install ufw . Once the 
install is complete, run the command  sudo ufw enable  to 
start the firewall. By default, all incoming connections are 
blocked, and all outgoing connections are allowed.
>> To enable incoming connections on a certain port, use  
sudo ufw allow —for example,  sudo ufw allow 23 .
>> Once all your clients are able to connect to your 
website, you should take some time to lock down Nginx 
To run a server on TAILS, you need to save 
your software, web pages, and client keys 
so they can be restored if necessary. These 
are saved in the encrypted “Persistent” 
section of the USB stick (see box over page). 
Open Terminal in TAILS, then create a 
folder to store backups with  mkdir /home/ 
amnesia/Persistent/tails-server  . Next, 
run 
 
sudo 
nano 
/home/amnesia/
Persistent/backup.sh  and paste in:
 cp /etc/nginx/sites-available/default /  
 home/ amnesia/Persistent/tails-server/
 cp /etc/nginx/nginx.conf /home/

 cp /var/lib/tor/hidden_service/client_

 chmod -r 0777 /home/amnesia/

 echo Done.
Save and exit. Make it executable:
 sudo chmod a+x /home/amnesia/ 
 Persistent/ backup.sh
Run the backup:
 cd /home/amnesia/Persistent
 sudo ./backup.sh
Now press Ctrl-X, Y, then Enter to save 
and exit. 
Make the script executable with  sudo 
chmod a+x /home/amnesia/Persistent/
backup.sh .
Use  cd /home/amnesia/Persistent  to 
switch to the “Persistent” directory, then 
run a backup with  sudo ./backup.sh . 
To create the restore script, run the 
command  sudo nano /home/amnesia/
Persistent/restore.sh , and then paste in 
the following:
 apt-get update
 apt-get install -y nginx-light ufw
 ufw enable
 cp /home/amnesia/Persistent/tails-

“Logging Settings.” Put a  #  before the lines starting  access

>> This feature disables most logging features, which makes it 
more difficult for anyone to identify who is connecting to the server, 
although any error messages are still logged. 
>> Now restart Nginx to apply your changes with  sudo service 
nginx restart .
>> The “light” version of Nginx you’re using contains a bare 
minimum of HTTP modules to set up a basic website, although you 
can add others if you wish. Bear in mind that the more modules you 
install, the more likely it is an attacker can find one to exploit.

tailS of woe
By its very nature, TAILS is amnesiac. If you remove the USB 
stick from your computer, or restart the machine itself, all 
files and settings are lost.
>> For this reason, make sure you have enabled persistence 
[image d] by following the steps in “Setting Up TAILS” (see the box 
above) before going through the walkthrough opposite. 
>> Once you’re happy that your darknet site is up and 
running OK, be sure to go through the “Backup Scripts” 
boxout (see previous page), so that you can save and reload 
your settings. 
>> The Riseup website (https://riseup.net/en/security/
network-security/tor/onionservices-best-practices) 
contains some excellent advice for best practices with Tor 
hidden services. Pay close attention to the section on local 
host bypasses. And make sure you keep your software up 
to date, because new vulnerabilities are discovered with 
TAILS and Tor hidden services all the time.
>> That said, remember that Tor supports a number 
of hidden services, so don’t be afraid to experiment with 
running a private mail server or chat service, as opposed 
to a simple web page. A good security approach is to 
think of the authentication token as being only one layer 
of protection, and you can require users to log in with a 
separate password to your site. 
>> Also, remember that if anyone can access your 
machine while TAILS is running, they may also be able to 
access your client tokens. 
>> The only safe way to make sure that just people you 
approve can access your hidden service is if you give them 
their keys in person. Remember that anyone with access 
to their device can either use the hidden service or make 
a copy of the authentication token. Ask them to store their 
Tor Browser on an encrypted drive. Mobile device users 
should also enable encryption on their Android device, in 
case of theft or seizure. 
>> If you are worried your keys have been compromised, 
run the command  sudo shred -v /var/lib/tor/hidden_
service/client_keys  and restart Tor with  sudo service 
tor restart . The system generates new keys for your users. 
>> Finally, bear in mind that while malicious scanners 
won’t be able to automatically connect to your hidden 
service, they won’t receive the same message they would 
for an invalid onion address—in other words, they will 
know the address exists, but it will appear as though the 
server is down. This isn’t exactly plausible denial, but the 
Tor Project is working on it.

This project is designed to boot from 
the OS TAILS, installed on USB. Follow 
the steps outlined on the TAILS website 
at 
https://tails.boum.org/install/index.
en.html to do this. The USB stick must be 
at least 4GB in size.
Once installed, restart your machine 
and boot from USB. You may need to 
change your BIOS settings to do this. 
Click “Yes” on “More Options,” and type 
an admin password. 
By 
default, 
anyone 
monitoring 
outgoing connections made by TAILS 
can see you’re using Tor. You can make 
Tor traffic much harder to detect by 
visiting 
https://bridges.torproject.org/
options and choosing “obfs4” under 
“Advanced Options” to get some bridge 
addresses. Inside TAILS, click “This 
Computer’s Connection is Censored,” 
then “Configure > Yes > Next.” Paste in 
the bridge addresses. 
In TAILS, by default all data is lost 
when you restart your machine. You can 
create an encrypted volume, however, to 
store files and settings. Once the desktop 
loads, click “Applications > Tails > 
Configure Persistent Volume.” Choose a 
strong passphrase, and click “Create.” 
The wizard asks you which data to save—
select “Apt Packages,” “Apt Lists” and 
“Dotfiles,” then click “Save.”
Restart TAILS to enable persistence 
fully. On the boot screen, click “Yes” on 
“Use Persistence?” and enter your new 
password. Click “Yes” again for more 
options, and “Forward” to choose an 
admin password like before. Follow the 
steps in the “Backup Scripts” section to 
save and restore your server settings.

                       deny all;
                   }
              }
3. set up stealth serviCes
Run  sudo nano /etc/tor/torrc . Scroll down to “this section is just for 
location-hidden services.” This is where you’ll set up a hidden service 
for each user. Modify the names in the last line before pasting:
 hiddenserviceDir /var/lib/tor/hidden_service/                  
 hiddenservicePort 80 127.0.0.1:8080

Save and exit.
4. Create an index page with permissions
Create a simple landing page for your website with  sudo nano /var/
www/index.htm . Type in some text, such as “This is your secret 
page running from TAILS,” then save, and exit. Give the www user 
ownership of the “/var/www” folder with  sudo chown -rv www-
data:www-data /var/www . Restart Tor and Nginx with:
 sudo service tor restart
 sudo service nginx restart
5. set up Client aCCess (tor browser)
Run  sudo cat /var/lib/tor/hidden_service/hostname  to list 
access tokens for all users. Ask your user to open their Tor Browser 
Bundle folder and use a text editor to open the “torrc” file. This is 
found 
in 
“~/[path_to_tor_browser]/Browser/TorBrowser/Data/
Tor/torrc” on Linux. Type  hidservauth , then paste the line for 
their Hidden Service Authentication address and cookie at the end.
6. set up Client aCCess (orbot)
If your contacts prefer to use mobile devices, ask them to install the  
apps Orbot and Orweb on their Android device. Next, start Orbot  
and go to “Menu > Settings > Torrc Custom Config.” Type the word  
 hidservauth , then leave a space, and paste in their entry from 
hostname. They can now access your hidden service using the  
Orfox browser.

Go Headless with 
Your Raspberry Pi
1
Install RaspbIan
If you already have an existing Raspbian installation working 
with your Raspberry Pi, you can skip this step, and if you’re 
already using something different—such as Arch or RiscOS—your 
methodology is going to be slightly different, though the principle 
remains the same. Grab a clean Raspbian Stretch disk image from 
www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/raspbian, then download Etcher 
from https://etcher.io. The latter is a new disk image writer on the 
scene, but it’s about as foolproof as these things get. Once you have 
it up and running, click “Select image,” and pick your Raspbian file, 
click “Select drive,” and pick your SD drive, then click “Flash” to 
unite the two [Image a].
2
Heads up
With everything safely installed, hook up your Pi to your 
peripherals and monitor, then to your router, using an 
Ethernet cable if possible [Image b]. Power it up. A new Raspbian 
install automatically runs a console application called raspi-config; 
We’ve talked many times about the Raspberry Pi, and in just about every one of our Pi explorations 
we’ve mentioned the possibility of running it headlessly. This means, as the word “headless” 
obliquely suggests, cutting off the machine’s face, and disabling most of its senses—disconnecting 
the monitor, keyboard, and mouse, and running the Pi entirely as a network-attached device. This 
isn’t as mad as it may sound. The Pi can play many roles, from NAS to network administration to 
web hosting and beyond, that have no need for any attached peripherals. And, let’s face it, while the 
Raspbian desktop is functional, running graphical apps does not play to the Pi’s strengths.
So, let’s break down what you need to do to make any Pi capable of running headlessly, and the 
methods you then need to use to connect to and administer that box through a Windows machine. 
For the full effect, you need to start with peripherals attached to your Pi, but they won’t be hooked 
up for long; if you don’t have spares, borrow your regular USB mouse and keyboard. –Alex Cox

For a stable connection.
if you have an existing install, just drop to the text terminal 
(from the desktop, hit Ctrl-Alt-F1), and run  raspi-config  
to get there manually. Head to “Interface options/SSH,” 
and switch on SSH, which stands for Secure Socket Shell. 
This is the protocol we’ll use to communicate with the Pi’s 
terminal over the network. Exit raspi-config, and (still in 
the console) run  ifconfig eth0  to get the IP address of the 
Raspberry Pi.

Make It statIc
If your Pi or your router get rebooted, the IP address 
you just discovered might change—that’s not ideal, 
considering that we’re looking to access it via the network. 
So, let’s lock it down. Type  sudo nano /etc/dhcpcd.conf  
to tweak the appropriate Raspbian config file (the default 
su password is “raspberry” when you’re asked), and head 
to the bottom of the file. Add the following, replacing the 
static address with that of your Pi (leaving the “/24” part at 
the end), and the others with that of your router: 
 interface eth0
 static ip_address=192.168.0.100/24
 static routers=192.168.0.1
 static domain_name_servers=192.168.0.1

can safely replace “eth0” with “wlan0”—or even, if you like, apply

Type  sudo reboot  to reinitialize Raspbian with these new

running  ifconfig eth0 , and ensuring that the IP address is as 
you’d expect. Run  sudo service ssh status  to check that your SSH 
server is up and running, and you should be good to go. Now jump on 
your Windows machine, head to www.putty.org, and download the 
relevant PuTTY installer for your system. Install it with the default 
options, and run PuTTY. Add your Pi’s local IP address in the “Host 
Name” box at the top of the window [Image c], and click “Open.” 
You should connect directly to your Pi’s command line terminal. If 
so, feel free to disconnect your peripherals and reboot—you’re now 
running headless.

The first “S” in SSH stands for “secure,” but your current 
connection—to an open Raspberry Pi with the default 
password—is far from it. The first course of action is, naturally, to 
D
change that default Pi password by running  passwd  pi  
in the terminal. Now, on your Windows machine, run 
PuTTYgen [Image d] to begin the process of creating a 
secure key pair. Leave the options at the defaults, click 
“Generate,” and wiggle your mouse over the blank area. 
Type a long passphrase to protect your private key—this 
will be the password you use to log in, going forward—then 
click “Save private key” to generate a secure .ppk file, and 
“Save public key” to create a plain text file containing the 
public key. Put these somewhere safe.
6
lock It down
Open PuTTY, log in to your Pi as normal, and type  
 mkdir ~/.ssh  to create a directory to house the 
public portion of the key, then  chmod -R og= ~/.ssh  to 
ensure that only you are allowed to write to and read from 
that directory. Run  sudo nano ~/authorized_keys , then 
copy and paste the public key from the top of the PuTTYgen 
window into this file. Save it, and end your PuTTY session 
for now. Back in the main PuTTY interface, drill down in the 
left column to “SSH > Auth,” and use the “Browse” button 
to point it at your .ppk private key [Image e]. Log in to your 
Pi again, and you should be asked for the password of the 
private key—if all has gone well, you can now use Nano 
to edit the “/etc/ssh/sshd_config” file, and set password 
authentication to “no.” Reboot, and the only way you’ll be 
allowed in is by using your private key. 
Can you really not spare a keyboard and monitor for a 
few minutes? No problem. As long as you’re OK with using 
Raspbian as your Pi’s OS, and you’re using a Raspberry Pi 
with an Ethernet port, there’s a quick workaround to enable 
SSH—and therefore headless operation—before you’ve even 
booted the Pi once.
Write your SD card with the OS as usual, then open up the 
card in Windows’ file explorer. Right-click in the white space 
of the drive, and head to “New > Text Document.” Name this 
blank text file “ssh” with no file extension, then remove the 
SD card, insert it into your Pi, attach an Ethernet cable to 
connect it to the network, and power it up. 
Open a web browser on your main PC, and connect to your 
router’s interface. Head to its DHCP allocation table, and 
work out which IP address the Pi has been assigned; you can 
now connect to this address via PuTTY, and get on with the 
rest of that critical headless configuration.

Stabilize Your 
Wobbly Video Files
1
Convert your video file to Avi
We’re using VirtualDub to achieve our goal, because although 
Premiere Pro is fantastic (see boxout opposite), it’s also quite 
expensive and definitely overkill for a task like this. VirtualDub has 
been around since 2004, and although it’s compatible with 64-bit 
systems and Windows 10, it can be a little fussy in some respects. 
One of them is the video file types it reads: AVI is the safest bet, so 
if you have an MP4, a WMV, or (god help you) an MKV sitting on your 
desktop, ready for attention, you need to run it though a converter 
first. Browser-based converters such as Online Video Converter 
(www.onlinevideoconverter.com/cloud-converter) will do the trick 
nicely [image A]. Just ignore the advertisements asking you to 
“Come play, my lord….”
2
open it in virtuAldub
Now you have a freshly baked AVI waiting to be stabilized, 
open up VirtualDub, and either drag the video file anywhere 
within the window, or to go “File,” and “Open Video File” [image b]. 
If your video has a variable bit rate (VBR), you get a warning 
message at this point, but it’s nothing to worry about. If you don’t 
have a codec pack installed on your PC, you may also get an error 
message telling you VirtualDub can’t load the file. That’s nothing to 
lose sleep over either—just download the codec you need, install it 
to the default directory, and you’re set. Yet another possibility at this 
stage is that you get an error message about loading audio when 
you try to play the file. There are several solutions to this, but the 
easiest is to disable audio and pair it up later in a separate program.
Not all videos are created equally. You only have to sit through Suicide Squad to figure that 
much out, but we’re not taking dire scripting to task now. Instead, we’re focusing on stabilizing 
shaky video files. We don’t carry tripods everywhere we go, and last time we looked around, 
nor does anyone else. As a result, much of the smartphone and GoPro video we create contains 
juddering images due to our shaky hands or uneven terrain, and that can be fairly unpleasant to 
watch for more than a few seconds, daughter’s first steps or not. Camera hardware itself can help 
with this problem to an extent, but good stabilization lenses are expensive, and not applicable to 
GoPro recording. So, instead, we’re turning to our trusty PCs, loading some absolutely cost-free 
software up, and taking the shakiness out ourselves. 
It’s worth noting at this point that it’s more than possible to go too far when using any stabilization 
plugin or software, leaving the stabilized video looking worse. Like much of video editing, it requires 
something of a deft touch. If you don’t possess such a thing, a long evening of trial and error, and a 
handy magazine guide will get you there, too. –PHIL IWANIUK

“Deshaker” on the list, and hit “OK.” You’ll see a big window full of 
options appear [image C], which we’re about to make sense of.
4
run A video AnAlysis pAss
The tweaks you make in this window depend on what kind 
of camera you used to capture the video. GoPro footage, 
for example, benefits from selecting “Camcorder has a rolling 
shutter” on the left, and changing the value to around 85. If your 
video isn’t from a GoPro, or you’re not sure about shutter speed, 
leave this unchecked. Under “Pass 1 parameters,” however, any 
footage benefits from choose the “Full” scale option in the drop-
down menu. It works your system harder and takes longer, but it 
offers more precise results. We also had better results with “Detect 
zoom” left unchecked. Hit “OK,” and back in the main VirtualDub 
window, head to “File” and “Run video analysis pass” [image d].
5
run A seCond pAss 
That pass takes a while, so let VirtualDub do its thing, then 
repeat the previous step to bring the Deshaker menu up once 
more. Now it’s time to run a second pass, to improve results further. 
Leave the Pass 1 parameters as you set them before, and focus 
on Pass 2. This is where we eliminate the black border that often 
arises as a result of stabilization. Select “Use previous and future 
frames to fill in borders,” then check the “Soft borders” box below, 
using a value of 10. Our GoPro trail riding footage features lots of 
changes in speed, so setting zoom to 0 in the motion smoothness 
values helps to avoid any noticeable changes in zoom. These are 
D
F
the results we found to be effective, but your footage might 
work better with different values, so experimenting is key. 
Now hit “OK” again, and you’re all set [image e].
6
render the stAbilized video out
All that’s left is to save the newly stabilized file out. 
VirtualDub lets you save as an AVI in old or new 
formats, or in segments, the latter proving handy if you’re 
working with a big, space-consuming file. Take a look at 
your new file [image f], and compare it with the original. 
Check for a noticeable improvement, and for any odd 
frame pacing or zoom issues. And that’s that: smoother, 
less headache-inducing vids for free. 
E
To no one’s surprise, Premiere Pro can 
handle this type of task very effectively 
and in a slightly more user-friendly 
manner. Warp Stabilizer launched within 
After Effects in CS5.5, but as of CS6, it’s 
built into Premiere Pro itself. Applying it 
is as simple as locating it in your effects 
panel and dragging it on to a clip—usually 
the default values are more than enough 
to give you the desired effect, but you 
can adjust the smoothness if it looks too 
jarring. It takes a moment for the software 
to analyze your footage, and then... well, 
that’s it. Done. Please return to your 
homes. There’s no denying it’s an easier 
way than using VirtualDub, and the results 
are impressive, but you’d expect that 
from a professional grade software suite 
carrying a monthly subscription price.

Create a Striking 
Eclipse Montage
1
Raw mateRials
The image we’re going to create will be a montage of photos 
showing the phases of the eclipse, from first contact to greatest 
coverage (we didn’t see totality from our viewing position). We’re 
going to start in Lightroom this month, because we shot our eclipse 
photos as raw files, and we need to do some noise reduction before 
exporting them as JPEGs. The app comes bundled with Photoshop 
CC as part of Adobe’s Photographer’s Bundle, but if you prefer a 
different raw decoder, you can use that. 
>> Lightroom is pretty good at noise reduction, but careful control 
of the slider is generally required to make sure you don’t smear any 
fine detail in your image. In this case, however, there’s little detail 
on the surface of the sun, thanks to wispy cloud that spoiled the 
view for us, and we don’t care about the black space surrounding it. 
Therefore, we can just whack the Luminance slider up and not care 
about the results [image a]. A little subtle shading from the clouds 
remains, which adds interest to the image.
2
Noises off
We can quickly apply the same noise reduction to the other 
image we want to export, by right-clicking the edited image, 
and selecting “Develop Settings > Copy Settings.” Click “Check 
None,” and add a check in the “Noise Reduction” box. Then copy the 
settings. Decide which of the remaining images you want to include 
in the montage, select them with a left click and the Ctrl button, and 
paste the noise reduction in with a right click and “Develop Settings 
> Paste Settings.” Keeping the images selected, export them as 
August’s eclipse dragged a curved line of totality across the US, from northern Oregon on the 
west coast to the middle of South Carolina on the east. If you weren’t lucky enough to be on this line, 
which also took in parts of Idaho, Wyoming, Nebraska, Missouri, Kentucky, and Tennessee, you will 
have seen a partial eclipse, which is still one of the greatest sights in the entire galaxy.
The total eclipse relies on the coincidence that our moon appears the same size as the sun in our 
sky, despite one being very large and far away, and the other being small and close. No other planet 
in the solar system has total eclipses, and it’s likely to be a rarity across the universe. So, we hope 
you managed to get some pictures.
If, like us, you weren’t quite sure of your camera settings when you went out, solar filter in hand, 
to record the eclipse, you might have ended up with some less-than-optimal results. Here’s what 
you can do with them. –Ian EvEndEn

the eclipse in August.
JPEGs using “File > Export.” Keep them at their original 
size, because we’re only going to want the sun and moon, 
not the dark space around them, and we might as well keep 
them as large as possible.
3
NatuRal selectioN
Open all your images in Photoshop as separate 
files. If, like we did, you’ve ended up with a lot of 
different colors on the sun, we can even them out so that 
the resulting montage doesn’t look like a row of jelly beans. 
Photoshop has the facility to do this for us, but you need 
to select the sun in each image first. There are lots of 
ways you can do this, depending on how your image has 
come out. 
>> Our home-made solar filter (a circle cut from a 
sheet of proper solar safety film, squeezed between two 
cheap UV filters and a step-up ring) added some flare to 
the image, which isn’t going to look that good in the final 
montage, so we’ll be using the selection as an excuse to 
chop it out. We’re going to use the Elliptical Marquee, then 
tidy it up in “Select” and “Mask” [image B].

constrain it to a perfect circle with the Shift key. Concentrate on 
getting it the right size to completely surround your sun, and move it 
into position after you’ve released the mouse button. Alternatively, 
you can use the Quick Selection tool on the background followed 
by “Select > Inverse,” if you’ve got a good clean division. Darken 
the sky around the sun using Levels’ black point slider to sharpen 
the edge.
5
coloR schemiNg
Once you’ve got the sun selected on each of your images, it’s 
time to even out those colors. Pick an image that’s roughly 
in the middle of the color range, and remember its filename—this 
is going to be the source image. Select your first image, and go to 
“Image > Adjustments > Match Color.” In the window that opens, 
make sure the “Ignore Selection” box isn’t checked, and in the 
“Source” drop-down, choose the filename of your chosen source 
image [image c]. Tinker with the sliders until you like what you 
see, then do the same thing with all your other images, except the 
chosen source image. 
C
6
suNshiNe state
To finish up, arrange all your suns on a black 
background—a straight line, especially diagonally 
across your image [image d], can look good, but a curve 
has much more visual interest. Keep them selected, and 
you can simply drag and drop them into a new file, or on 
to the background of an existing image, whichever looks 
better to you. Use “Select > Modify > Feather” to slightly 
soften the edge of the sun if it looks too hard, and if there 
are any suns that are a slightly different size, shrink them 
down using “Edit > Free Transform,” holding Shift so 
they’re all the same size as the smallest—making any of 
them larger loses quality. Finally, flatten any layers in your 
image, and export your composite as a high-quality JPEG 
file ready to print. 
D
Lightroom doesn’t always get the acclaim of 
Photoshop, but it can do much more than just decode 
your raw files. It’s extremely good at managing your 
photo library, and its non-destructive editing (the 
edits aren’t applied to the image until it’s exported 
as a new file, meaning the original is never changed) 
can be applied to JPEGs as well as raws. Along 
with its spot-removal brushes, gradients to apply 
effects smoothly across an image, and ability to 
crop and resize photos, there’s so much you can do 
in Lightroom that you might not even need to open 
Photoshop for some edits, especially when tidying 
up a large number of photographs that only require 
minor crops and tweaks.

The Big Ripper 
Rendering Rig
It’s about tIme we put those rendering 
processors to work, huh? We certainly think 
so—16 cores and 32 threads are just too good 
an opportunity to pass up. And with a renewed 
push to produce more video content for our 
online platforms over the coming months, it 
makes sense to piece together a workstation 
for our reviews editor that’s a little more 
spec-driven than the Core i7-5820K and 32GB 
of DDR4 he has now.
At Maximum PC, our workstations are 
generally constructed out of parts we have on 
loan, they need to be flexible, and easy to take 
to pieces if certain components have to 
go back to their PRs. They also need to be 
versatile—from gaming, to standard office 
work, to photo editing, video rendering, and 
running through all manner of tutorials, our 
rigs have to be capable of doing it all.
This time around, our system is going to 
have a very large focus on video editing, so 
the monster component that is Threadripper 
is our processor of choice. Whether it’s 
the eight-, 12-, or 16-core parts, both the 
connectivity and quad-channel memory 
support, combined with Ryzen’s architectural 
prowess, make it the perfect match for our 
rendering aspirations, and anything else we 
want to throw at it.
So, what’s the plan? Grab the 1950X, an 
Asus Prime X399 motherboard, 128GB of 
DDR4, a plethora of PCIe solid-state storage 
for scratch disk and OS use, and 20TB or so of 
hard drives for backup. No biggy, right?

truly tItanIC
the one thIng we really enjoy about speccing systems like 
this is just how much they change over the course of the planning 
stage. First, we were going to use the 12-core Threadripper, 
and we decided the Asus Zenith Extreme was our motherboard 
of choice. NZXT promised us a swanky new chassis exclusive 
(which, unfortunately, didn’t arrive in time), so we swapped to 
the Fractal Design Meshify, but that wouldn’t support the Asus 
Prime X399-A we eventually went with, so we finally settled on 
our old favorite, the Evolv ATX, instead. Couple that with the drop 
in effective memory frequency from 3,200 to 2,933, and that’s one 
hell of a lot of different tweaks and changes to how this system 
was originally going to shape up.
It’s a monstrous beast, with a price tag to match. It may not 
quite reach the heady heights of our Dream Machine from two 
issues ago (about $4K down on it on a pure system-to-system 
comparison), but it’s still an outlandish amount of money to 
invest in any build.
The problem, as is often the case with these builds, lies with 
the storage and memory. As core counts have increased, and 
graphical prowess has accelerated headlong into the clouds, 
maximum memory capacity and hard drive prices have faltered. 
Look back two years, and the rate of improvement pales in 
comparison. That said, if you want to make this build more 
affordable, you could shave a good $2,000 off just by lopping off 
some of that excess storage. Even cutting down the memory to 
64GB at 2,933 would save you nearly $700.
phanteks’s evolv atX tg has exceptional cooling 
support. Designed with liquid cooling in mind, it 
features a unique sliding radiator bracket in the roof, 
along with a whole ton of support for additional fan 
mounting. The front of the case allows for the external 
installation of up to three 120mm fans, between the 
chassis and the front fascia panel, typically used when 
installing a radiator. If you’re installing fans without a 
rad in the front, to save space (for example, if you have 
two 3.5-inch hard drives installed below the PSU cover), 
you have to mount the fans from the rear instead of the 
front, as you would traditionally.
we knew goIng Into thIs that, by default, the Phanteks 
Enthoo Evolv ATX TG is only meant to support ATX-
sized motherboards. It can accommodate the larger 
form factor, but only with careful planning. Because 
the mobo will cover the rubber grommets used for 
cable management, it’s important in this scenario to 
install both the power supply and the cables you’re 
going to need first, before installing and securing the 
motherboard in place. This actually gives us a good 
opportunity to work on our cable management ahead 
of time—important, given the Evolv ATX TG’s clear rear 
glass panel.

InstallIng the 16-Core beast is a little daunting. Upon 
purchase, you receive an Asetek bracket for your AIO, and a 
torque screwdriver. Using the screwdriver, you undo screw 
three, then screw two, then screw one. Let the first retention 
bracket lift up, then gently pull the two blue tabs up at the top 
of the socket. With the second retention bracket, slide out the 
plastic cover, then carefully remove the additional plastic cover 
protecting the socket. Then it’s a case of sliding Threadripper 
into the second retention bracket (the one you removed the 
plastic cover from), until it clicks into place, then gently 
lowering it down on to the LGA socket, and finally resecuring the 
top retention bracket by tightening each screw until the included 
screwdriver clicks, going from screw one, to two, to three.
any opportunIty to use a magnetic LED strip and we’ll 
take it. Given the nature of this build, it doesn’t really 
need the extra lighting inside—if anything, it’s just adding 
additional power draw. That said, because power draw 
isn’t a primary concern for us here, and it’s going to be 
sitting on our desk, why not? We’ve also routed the cables 
for the Crucial MX300 around the right-hand side of the 
SSD, to ensure that we can retain the label in the correct 
orientation. It is a little snug to plug those cables in, but 
once installed, they’re not going anywhere.

although we now have access to a couple of beautiful 
Titan Xps, we’ve decided to stick with the Nvidia GeForce 
GTX 1080 Ti—it’s a beauty, and although it doesn’t quite 
reach the pinnacles of performance that the Titan does, 
it’s more than good enough for all our rendering and 
lunchtime gaming needs. We’ve also decided to pull out an 
old favorite—Intel’s 1.2TB 750 PCIe SSD—for our primary 
storage drive and scratch disk. Although we’re not massive 
fans of PCIe add-in cards like this, particularly for storage, 
the performance is exceptional, and that extra capacity is 
going to work wonders for us.
thIs was always going to be a tight build, given that meaty 
mobo and the 280mm Kraken X62 wedged into the top of the 
chassis. Fortunately, thanks to the Evolv’s removable radiator 
bracket in the top, this stage of the build is far less stressful, 
especially when installing the multiple cables going into the 
Kraken X62 CPU block, and routing fans into the motherboard. 
Simply slide the bracket out halfway, and you can easily reach 
around and gain access to the top of the board. It was also 
convenient when we first booted the board, because the stock 
BIOS on our review sample didn’t support all 128GB at any 
frequency—one slide out, four sticks removed, a BIOS update 
and reinstall of the RAM later, and we’re all good.

1,000W Be Quiet! PSU reduced cable clutter.
It’s not flawless, but for all intents and 
purposes, it’s perfect for the job at hand. 
The biggest decisions came from swapping 
and changing the spec list, and little else. 
And that’s the problem: With Threadripper, 
AMD has introduced a way for mainstream 
consumers to gain access to HEDT features far 
greater than anything we’ve seen previously. 
With 64 PCIe lanes directly connected to the 
processor alone, allowing for up to four-
way CrossFire or SLI at x16x16x16x16, it’s 
staggering what you can do. 
Alongside that, the number of cores is 
unprecedented within the industry. And 
although Intel does have solutions in the 
pipeline, they’re coming in at a minimum 
of $700 more, as standard. And they don’t 
support the insane levels of PCIe lane 
connectivity we’ve witnessed here with TR. 
This puts Threadripper in a unique position 
because, although the core architecture isn’t 
quite up to scratch compared to Intel’s well-
honed design right now, having that many 
cores, at such an affordable price, with a fairly 
weighty chipset behind it, makes it far more 
accessible and powerful than anything we’ve 
ever seen from Team Blue. For instance, 
ignoring our ridiculously pricey build here 
(thanks again, storage), you can knock up a 
fairly impressive 12-core, 24-thread, 32GB 
system for less than $2,500 relatively easily—
check out our recommended build for that at 
http://bit.ly/TRCheaper. 
Going forward, bearing in mind that these 
processor parts are based on AMD’s EPYC 
server chips, it’s entirely feasible that we 
could see core counts reaching even higher 
than the 16 cores we have today. A 32-core part 
coming out to directly combat Intel’s 18-core 
Core i9-7980XE at the same price point may 
seem outlandish, but it’s definitely something 
that’s on the table for Team Red right now, and 
it would secure its absolute dominance in the 
high-end desktop domain.
Finally, let’s make one thing clear: You can 
game, very comfortably, on Threadripper, 
outside of gaming mode, at 1080p, 1440p, 
and above, with relative ease. The difference 
between Intel and AMD is definitely there, but 
it’s marginal (3–4 percent difference at most), 
and unless you absolutely must be at the 
cutting edge for frame rates, you’re not even 
going to notice.

it’s an awesome time to be a PC enthusiast. 
Just six months ago, there was barely a 
single AMD CPU worth getting out of bed 
for. Now, we can hardly keep up with all 
the crazy new models, each with insane 
core counts and the promise of ever more 
preposterous levels of performance.
Enter the AMD Ryzen Threadripper 
1920X. We had our dirty paws on AMD’s 
flagship, the monstrous 16-core 1950X, 
last issue, so it was time to throw the $800 
offering on our bench instead. The 1920X 
packs a mere 12 cores and 24 threads, but 
that still makes for an absolute beast of a 
PC processor. One capable of on-paper 
feats of parallel processing that simply 
weren’t available until AMD shook things 
up with its awesome Ryzen architecture.
As for the specifics, the 1920X clocks 
in at a 3.5GHz base clock and 4GHz Turbo. 
Those are very healthy clocks indeed 
for a chip with so many cores, and that 
reflects AMD’s clever approach with the 
Threadripper lineup, which involves a 
pair of eight-core processor dies in a 
single package. In other words, given that 
mainstream eight-core Ryzen CPUs have 
no problem clocking up to 4GHz, it should 
be no surprise that Threadripper chips are 
also capable of a similar figure.
Of course, effectively cramming two 
CPUs as powerful as Ryzen into a single 
package has certain ramifications in terms

two separate CPU dies in one package, as is 
the case here.
To offset that architectural shortcoming, 
AMD has cooked up a special Game Mode 
for Threadripper CPUs, which does two 
things. First, it disables one of the CPU dies 
altogether, leaving you with effectively a 
conventional single-die Ryzen processor. 
It also switches the chip’s memory mode to 
NUMA, which restricts a game’s memory 
footprint 
to 
locally-connected 
RAM, 
further reducing latency issues.
The 
upshot, 
in 
theory, 
is 
that 
Threadripper in Game Mode performs on 
par with a mainstream single-die Ryzen 
processor of similar configuration. That’s 
our experience in practice. Run a game 
such as Total War: Attila on the 1920X in the 
fully-enabled 12-core Creator Mode, and it 
can be hideously stuttery. In Game Mode, 
it’s just a little stuttery, like a regular Ryzen 
CPU. It’s just a pity that you must reboot the 
system fully to jump between modes.
Not that the patchy gaming performance 
matters. This 12-core chip is hardly a cost-
effective way of gaming. For everything 
else, it’s absolutely killer. –Jeremy Laird
of power consumption, but more on that in a 
moment. First, it’s worth recalling some of 
the platform niceties that come with these 
epic Threadripper chips. Not only do you 
get quad-channel DDR4 memory support, 
but also no fewer than 60 PCIe lanes. This 
is some very serious computing hardware.
That’s 
something 
that 
socks 
you 
squarely between the eyes the moment 
you run some benchmarks. This thing flies. 
It murders Cinebench in multithreaded 
mode, with 2,308 points. The single-thread 
score of 152 is pretty tolerable, too, thanks 
to that 4GHz top Turbo speed. The raw 
memory bandwidth is also mega, hitting 
around 60GB/s for reads and writes. Ouch.
If there is a price to be paid for this 
raw computational muscle, it’s power 
consumption. At idle, our 1920X ticks 
along at a reasonable 67W. Under full CPU, 
that leaps to 243W. But we don’t have a 
major issue with that. If you want a lot of 
performance, you have to pay for the power.
What you might not be so willing to 
put up with is Threadripper’s mediocre 
gaming performance. The clever modular 
architecture AMD has come up with for 
Zen, complete with its innovative Infinity 
Fabric interconnect, is hugely effective for 
many parallelized workloads. But it does 
create certain latencies, thanks to the way 
the cores and cache memory are arranged. 
Those issues are magnified when you have

Well, folks, What can We say? AMD 
has well and truly screwed the pooch on 
this one. It’s been 16 months (at time of 
writing) since Nvidia launched its high-
end Pascal GPU lineup, featuring the GTX 
1080 and GTX 1070, and 12 months since 
AMD launched its Polaris architecture. 
In that time, we’ve seen marketing ploys, 
press events, and more, all labeling Vega 
as the new king of compute, the prodigal 
son, even demolishing Nvidia’s yet-to-be-
released Volta architecture in some cases.
What we’re left with, then, is a check that 
the mouth can’t cash. From the get-go, we 
knew something was up—the fanfare that 
surrounded the launch of Threadripper 
was suspiciously absent when it came to 
Vega’s arrival. The press reps fell quiet, 
there were no unboxing videos, no launch 
events, all was quiet. Our sample arrived in 
the post, not with the flurry of notifications 
that we’re used to, but with silence. 
We threw it on the bench and, alas, our 
suspicions were confirmed. 
Performance wasn’t as impressive as 
we first hoped. It’s a card that isn’t quite 
capable of beating the GTX 1080, never 
mind the heady heights of Nvidia’s 1080 Ti. 
At 1080p, performance was solid enough: 
We saw scores of 48fps in Total War: Attila, 
103 in Far Cry Primal, 104 in The Division, 
and 62 in Rise of the Tomb Raider. Bump up 
to 1440p, and you’re still hitting over 60fps 
in Primal and The Division, and then 40-ish 
All bark and no bite?

at 4K. Compare it to the GTX 1080, however, 
and you’ll notice that performance is ever 
so slightly lacking. Synthetic benchmarks 
score well, but aside from that, the RX 
Vega 64 falls slightly behind in all of our 
benchmarking suite.
Take it overclocking, however, and you 
can expect an extra 100MHz out of the 
core, and 200MHz out of the memory—
not a huge amount, but still enough to 
draw those Fire Strike scores up by an 
extra 500–2,000 points where it counts. 
Unfortunately, voltage control, as with 
the Fury X, isn’t available right now, so we 
can’t push it further; but, to be honest, you 
probably wouldn’t want to.
The biggest problem by far is the power 
draw. At stock, under load, our reference 
GeForce GTX 1080 in our test rig draws 
252W from the wall. Compare that to Vega, 
and the difference is staggering: 403W 
under load. That’s 151W more, and 49W 
more than even our reference GTX 1080 Ti. 
That’s no small amount. We can’t say for 
sure, but the amount of voltage AMD has 
had to throw at the architecture, purely to 
get even vaguely comparable performance 
up against its Nvidia rivals, makes us 
doubt whether we’re likely to see anything 
competitive from team red.
Then there’s the price. Partly due to 
its crazy-high hash rate drawing every 
wannabe cryptocurrency miner this side 
of the Atlantic to it, and another part due 
to a lack of available stock on AMD’s part, 
Vega 64 is available right now for $680 for 
the standard reference design—limited 
to one per customer. If that isn’t to your 
liking, you can pick up a GeForce GTX 
1080 for $510 instead. Hell, a GTX 1080 Ti 
is only $70 more than Vega, and that nets 
you an EVGA aftermarket design, with a 
20MHz overclock, and a triple-fan cooler, 
plus average performance over 22 frames 
higher in most titles.
Look, we don’t want to rage at AMD. 
We’re not doing it just for the sake of it. 
The company needs to do well—Nvidia 
needs real competition, because it drives 
innovation; we’ve already seen this with 
Intel and Ryzen. But Vega 64 has fallen well 
short of the mark and, given its current 
availability, price, performance, and power 
draw, the hype train has left both the station 
and Vega far behind. For $170 less, you can 
get similar, if not better, performance by 
going with team green, and that genuinely 
saddens us. –Zak storey

Funny how Fast things change. Eighteen 
months ago, eight cores was as good as it 
got for desktop PC processors. Not now. In 
this brave new post-AMD Ryzen world, it’s 
half as many cores as AMD now sells you in 
a single CPU. It’s not even half as many as 
Intel is planning by the end of 2017.
The flip side goes something like this: If 
eight cores is no longer exotic, it should be 
affordable, right? When it comes to AMD’s 
Ryzen processors, that’s an affirmative. As 
we go to press, Newegg happens to have 
a sale on the entry-level AMD Ryzen 1700 
eight-core chip, just squeezing it in under 
$300. That is simply awesome.
It’s also where we’d hardly blame you 
for taking issue with the new Core i7-
7820X. It’s Intel’s latest eight-core chip, 
and it arrives with an official retail price of 
$599. That’s not only double the cost of that 
fire-sale Ryzen processor, it’s also more 
than $200 more than the next CPU down in 
Intel’s new Skylake-X range, the six-core 
Core i7-7800X. Of course, not all CPU cores 
are equal. Hold that thought while we look 
at the 7820X’s vital statistics.

the 
headline numbers look good. There’s a 
3.6GHz base clock, 4.3GHz Turbo clock,

28 PCI Express lanes. OK, that’s way 
fewer than the 64 you get with an AMD 
Threadripper chip, and it’s a lot fewer than 
the 44 lanes Intel hooks up to the next CPU 
up in its own Skylake-X lineup, the 7900X. 
But it’s probably enough for all but the 
most demanding of system configurations.
Of course, the other major feature that 
comes with the 7820X is Intel’s peerless 
CPU core architecture. AMD’s Ryzen cores 
are very good, but they’re not quite this 
good. Which is why the 7820X blows every 
eight-core Ryzen CPU we’ve tested out 
of the water. OK, it’s only a little ahead of 
AMD’s fastest eight-core model, the Ryzen 
7 1800X, in Cinebench’s multithreading 
mode, and the 7820X only has a small 
advantage for video encoding, too. But it 
batters the AMD chip by 194 points to 159 in 
Cinebench’s single-threaded mode. That’s 
over 20 percent more performance.
In certain multithreaded workloads, 
it’s a lot quicker, too. Fry Render gives the 
7820X a huge 31 percent advantage for 
rendering. As for gaming, well, the raw 
numbers would have you thinking there’s 
not much in it. In practice, AMD’s modular 
Zen architecture can be stuttery in some 
game titles. It’s not a widespread issue, 
but Intel remains the obvious choice for 
consistently smooth performance in the 
widest number of games.
All of that applies to the 7820X running 
at standard clock speeds. Thanks to an 
unlocked CPU multiplier, you have easy 
access to cranking up the frequencies, too, 
if that’s your bag. In the end, then, Intel’s 
marketing boys aren’t completely crazy. 
Yes, the 7820X looks expensive in terms 
of pure core count, when you can grab an 
AMD eight-core CPU for half the money, 
but there’s more to CPU performance than 
mere core count. Intel’s cores remain the 
best you can buy on a per-core basis, and 
that, combined with healthy clock speeds, 
means the Core i7-7820X is quicker than 
any current eight-core AMD processor.
That goes some way to justifying the 
price. Whether it gets you over the line and 
makes the 7820X a completely compelling 
proposition will come down to your usage 
scenario. If all you care about, for instance, 
is video encoding, this chip probably isn’t 
for you. But as an all-round workhorse, it’s 
a seriously nice CPU. –Jeremy Laird

How mucH is too mucH? Or, why not more? 
That’s the question Acer’s Predator 21 X 
asks just by existing. An exercise in excess, 
the 21 X is a behemoth of a laptop—if you 
can call it one—that crams every possible 
bell, whistle, and kitchen sink you can think 
of inside its not-so-svelte frame. Except 
when it doesn’t. 21-inch curved ultrawide 
screen? 
Check. 
Full-size 
mechanical 
keyboard? Check. Top-end internals? 
Check. High-resolution panel? Nope. 
Before we get to that questionable 
design choice, let’s talk about what it’s like 
to use a laptop that’s upward of four times 
more expensive than a high-end desktop. 
Of course, laptop is a bit of a misnomer. 
Sure, it’s an all-in-one system with a mouse 
pad, keyboard, and screen that folds down 
in a clamshell—you know, the traditional 
hallmarks of what we call a “laptop”—but 
this is not the kind of machine you’d situate 
on your lap. First off, it weighs more than 
18 pounds, not including the two massive 
330W power bricks. That alone should be 
enough reason, but there’s also the front-
situated keyboard that makes general use 
awkward, not to mention the massive fans 
spitting hot air out of the back. Ouch! 
Portable desktop-replacement would 
be more accurate. But even then, is the 
Predator 21 X that portable? It’s not exactly 
the kind of rig you can toss in a backpack 
and take through airport security. In fact, 
the system ships with its own custom 
Pelican 
carrying 
case—a 
gargantuan 
wheeled box that you might expect to 
house a photographer’s entire livelihood. 
The (even larger) cardboard box it shipped 
in was so big that we were able to fit our

Our laptop zero-point is the Asus G752VT-DH72, with an Intel Core i7-6700HQ, GTX 970M, and 16GB of DDR4.  
Rise of the Tomb Raider tested at very high settings with SMAA at 1080p
editor in chief, Tuan Nguyen, completely 
inside. Solid Snake would have been proud. 
All of this is to say that the Predator 
21 X is hardly portable, which for a laptop, 
amounts to a contradiction that in many 
ways sums up the machine as a whole. This 
is the system that asks “why not?” Yet, we 
find ourselves asking “why?” For all the 
power and engineering inside, it’s saddled 
with a comparatively low resolution panel 
that clocks in at a mere 1080p. 
About that power. The Predator 21 X 
is outfitted with a nice suite of top-end 
internals. An Intel Core i7-7820HK pairs 
with 64GB (because why not?) of DDR4-
2400 RAM. Primary storage is handled 
by two 512GB PCIe SSDs in RAID 0 (again, 
why not?), with a backup 1TB SATA HDD for 
good measure. And for pixel-pushing, two 
GeForce GTX 1080s in SLI. Why not, indeed.
If you’ve paid attention to some of our 
previous dual-GPU system reviews, you 
may remember a common thread: SLI 
does not play nice with 1080p. Most dual-
GPU laptops we’ve tested before sported 
4K screens, and top-end dual-GPU rigs 
are usually similarly intended for higher-
resolution gaming—if not at 4K, then 1440p 
at 144Hz. And yet here we are: two GTX 
1080s in SLI chained to a criminally low 
resolution 1080p panel. 
Now, it’s worth noting that the Predator 
21 X’s panel is indeed a 21:9 ultrawide 
format, meaning the actual resolution 
is 2560x1080, as opposed to the standard 
1920x1080. But even so, we found the lower 
resolution’s issues with SLI performance 
to exist nonetheless. In some games, SLI 
played nice and offered frame rates in 
the realm we expected. The Division, for 
example, consistently returned a score 
of 115fps with SLI enabled using its built-
in benchmark on the highest available 
graphics preset, as opposed to 81fps 
without SLI. Far Cry Primal was a different 
story. It also scored around 81fps without 
SLI, but the frame rate dropped down to an 
average of 63fps with SLI turned on. 
Rise of the Tomb Raider had the same 
issue. Without SLI, the game’s three-part 
benchmark returned an average of 103fps. 
With SLI, that score dropped to 80fps. 
To make matters even more confusing, 
enabling DirectX 12 seemed to help SLI 
performance—raising the score to 127fps 
on average, but also introducing extremely 
noticeable bouts of lagging frames. Not 
exactly an enjoyable viewing experience. 
All of this is to say: why? For all the 
excessive “shoot-the-moon” attitude that 
went into the Predator 21 X, why not go all 
the way and outfit it with a proper screen? It 
doesn’t even have to be 4K—we’d be plenty 
happy with a high-refresh-rate 1440p 
panel. But 1080p? That’s unacceptable. For 
$9,000, we expect the best. –Bo moore

RemembeR when Asus more or less just 
made motherboards, or at least that’s 
how it seemed? No, us neither. Today, the 
Taiwanese megacorp has its fingers in so 
many pies, it’s hard to keep up. More to the 
point, just when you thought Asus’s product 
offerings couldn’t become more polished 
and consumer-friendly, along comes the 
Designo MX34VQ. It’s an awfully long way 
from those frills-free circuit boards of old.
It’s also far more grown-up than Asus’s 
existing ROG Swift premium monitors, they 
of the projected logos and gamer-centric 
shtick. Instead, this Designo model feels 
like a carefully aimed headshot at the likes 
of Samsung’s CF791. As it happens, the 
MX34VQ shares several key specs with that 
Sammy screen. For starters, both are 34-
inch super-wide monitors with 3440x1440 
native resolutions. They’re both curved 
and both support 100Hz refresh and AMD’s 
FreeSync tech. Then there’s a very similar 
high-end consumer electronics feel to the 
design of both. But what really marks them 
out as peas from a similar pod is the use of 
VA as opposed to IPS panel technology.
Indeed, with Asus reportedly sourcing 
its VA panel from none other than Samsung, 
you might suspect that they actually share 
the same panel. However, the Samsung 
screen sports a tighter 1500R radius to 
its curve versus the Asus’s slightly less 
extreme 1800R bend. The other major 
differentiator is the Samsung’s quantum 
dot technology to boost the fidelity of 
its backlight. Whatever, VA is always an 
intriguing choice due to the pros and cons it 
offers versus the ubiquity of IPS.
For starters, with VA, you get better 
outright contrast performance. In this case, 
a static contrast ratio of 3,000:1. Current 
IPS monitors tend to top out at 1,000:1. The 
reality isn’t as simple as the VA solution 
being three times better than IPS, but the 
advantage is real enough. On the downside, 
VA panels don’t offer the same super-wide 
viewing angles as IPS, and pixel response 
tends to be a little slower.
In practice, that’s pretty much how it 
plays out. The MX34VQ has lovely, inky 
blacks, with very little evidence of light 
bleed. However, in its standard factory 
calibrated form, the MX34VQ also exhibits 
signs of crushing shadow details, which is a 
common trait in VA panels, and the flip side 
of that awesome contrast performance. 
In test animations, that characteristic VA 
inverse ghosting can also be seen, though 
The latest Asus screen ups the slickness ante

it’s much less of a problem in practical use. 
Likewise, there’s no getting round the fact 
that the viewing angles aren’t as broad as 
an IPS panel. Most of the time, that’s fine. 
Just occasionally, however, you’ll view 
images that are particularly sensitive to 
color shifts, and it will bug you just a bit.
That said, the 100Hz refresh makes 
for a lovely gaming experience. The high 
contrast and the rich if not quite quantum-
dot-competitive colors make for a real 
spectacle in games such as Witcher III. OK, 
you don’t quite get the same fluidity and 
sharpness of input response as a 144Hz 
or 240Hz monitor, but you do get most 
of the benefit of such screens versus a 
standard 60Hz monitor. Once you go high 
refresh, you won’t want to go back, even 
for just shuffling windows around on the  
desktop—60Hz suddenly looks so very old.
Elsewhere, Asus has added a few nice 
extras, including Qi wireless charging in 
the base of the stand. That’s very cool if 
you happen to have a phone that supports 
wireless charging. All, therefore, is largely 
well? Not quite. The MX34VQ’s stand only 
supports tilt adjustment, it sits very low, 
and there’s no VESA support to fall back on. 
Apart from that, it’s a very appealing panel, 
albeit at a price. –JeRemy LaiRd

You can paY a lot for a gaming mouse. 
Over 200 bucks, in fact. And PC gaming—
indeed, PC building, too—is one of those 
hobbies where, if you’re using cheaper 
gear, you can feel like you’re being left 
behind. As though those people who buy 
the $200 mice, or the really expensive 
PSUs, or some colossal gold-plated case 
are having more fun than you are with 
some mid-range equipment. 
This is not the case. Sure, spending that 
much money on an input device might make 
you feel good—and mice are important; 
they’re the indispensable translator of 
your movements and wishes into the twitch 
of gunsights or the pixel-perfect swirl of a 
digital paintbrush—but you can feel good 
without splashing that kind of cash.
Take the Rival as an example. Logitech 
and Razer will relieve you of more green 
folding stuff for their products, but you 
won’t necessarily get a great deal more 
for your money. SteelSeries’s pair of 
revamped rodents (the ambidextrous 
Sensei, which has almost identical specs 
just in a different shell, is up to version 310, 
too) certainly punch above their cost.
Take the new sensor: The TrueMove 3 
from 
PixArt 
offers 
one-to-one 
raw 
tracking, which sounds like some ludicrous 
marketing nonsense, until you start 
thinking about who would actually need it. 
That person is the owner of a very large, 
high-resolution monitor, the kind of thing 
we all aspire to, on which the smallest 
deviation of mouse movement is magnified 
into a distinct jink.
The one-to-one tracking means the 
distance the sensor moves on your desktop 
is mirrored exactly on the screen, with as

little processing involved as possible, and 
therefore no lag. The Rival can go as high 
as 12,000 cpi, giving exceptional sensitivity 
for those who need it, and covering a decent 
bit of 4K real estate for every inch moved. 
Beneath the mouse, this remarkable 
sensor sits rather plainly—a small hole 
in the plastic base is all that betrays its 
presence. We rather like this understated 
approach 
to 
design; 
where 
other 
companies would have picked it out in 
orange, you’ll never see “12,000 CPI” 
sprayed across the back of the unit. All 
we get here is the SteelSeries logo, which 
looks rather like a sniper drawing a bead 
on Ronald McDonald (gambling debts to 
the wrong people, most likely) embossed 
into the base, and lit up again on the back, 
right under your palm. Light also leaks out 
from around the wheel, which is a thick, 
grippy one, with enough click to it that 
you’re left in no doubt as to whether it has 
gone round a notch or not—essential when 
using it to switch weapons.
Elsewhere, we’re firmly in the land of 
the matt black plastic people—but, again, 
SteelSeries has a trick up its sleeve. All the 
materials have been chosen for their light 
weight, and the plastic is fiber-reinforced. 
The shell is fingerprint-resistant, too; 
handy if you’ve ever been caught by the 
police after CSIs dusted your mouse. All 
this gets the weight down to a shade over 
three ounces.
The gray silicon side grips are certainly 
grippy, and the main buttons clicky—
they’re separate from one another and 
the rest of the body, and made from the 
same fingerprint-repelling plastic, which 
is slightly textured. They’re very pleasant 
places for your fingertips to hang out, as 
long as you’re right-handed. Underneath 
are Omron-designed switches rated for 50 
million clicks, and the restrained lighting 
does all the usual Prism-enabled tricks 
across your peripherals, the software up 
to SteelSeries’s usual standards, and the 
32-bit CPU onboard showing no signs of 
slowing anything down.
“From the creators of the #1 gaming 
mouse,” shouts the box quote from 
Maximum PC. And with its new sensor 
and complete failure to put a foot wrong, 
the new Rival should be snapping at that 
mouse’s heels. –Ian EvEndEn

When automobile manufacturers design 
a new car, they don’t just focus on the tiny 
explosion box under the hood. Every aspect 
of design is taken into consideration, every 
sense of the potential owner checked off. 
And while SteelSeries hasn’t imbued the 
Apex M750 with New Keyboard Smell 
(though, there’s an idea for future editions) 
it’s covered just about every other base. 
Visually, for example, it looks absolutely 
magnificent. Smooth curves have been 
panel-beaten out of its aircraft-grade 
aluminum base, though it’s so richly coated 
that only the weight and overall sturdiness 
really give away that this matt black 
slab is made of metal. There’s nothing 
superfluous or even slightly gamer-centric 
about its outward appearance; no harsh 
angles, no obnoxious media keys, just 
smooth lines, and a standard layout with 
readable, well-lit keys. 
SteelSeries’s Prism lighting system 
has long been one of our favorites, and 
it’s in full effect here, with a stack of 
reactive and wavy RGB functions that can 
be switched (and stored) on the keyboard 
itself, or more delicately customized 
through the SteelSeries Engine software. 
In truth, many of these are more suitable 
as showroom demos than anything you’ll 
want on your desk, but damn if they don’t 
look impressive for the five seconds you’ll 
have them active. SteelSeries’s new QX2 
mechanical keyswitches, debuting here, 
are housed in transparent plastic, which 
allows the light from the upper-mounted 
LED to bleed through to the bottom, 
creating a strong glow, even with a black 
base beneath. They’re designed to be fully 
compatible with Cherry keycaps, though

the included caps (despite their slightly 
sharp edges) are smart enough that you 
won’t want to replace them any time soon. 
One of the more subtle aspects of motor 
manufacturing is sound. The engine note, 
the clunk as you slam the door—it’s all 
designed just as carefully as the rest of the 
auto. We can’t help but feel that SteelSeries 
has done its own audio engineering work 
on the rattle of these keys. The QX2s are, 
technically, silent—press them gingerly 
enough and take advantage of the half-
press actuation distance, and there’s 
little to no noise. Hammer them in normal 
typing, though, and you’re in for a true 
aural treat. It’s a seriously satisfying 
clatter, which we’d rate above most other 
keyboards, and even if you really go to town 
on it, there’s none of the harmonic spring-
ringing that plagues some other switches. 
Not that these switches are perfect 
for every user, though. They feel amazing 
to use and are easy enough on the hands, 
but more than once we found ourselves 
resting our digits on the M750’s keys and 
activating them by accident; that super-
shallow 2mm actuation depth, coupled with 
a not quite strong enough spring, makes 
the QX2 switches unsuitable for the more 
heavy-fingered among us. Plus, if you’re 
not entirely deft, the light touch could lead 
to an increase in inadvertent typing errors. 
We do try to avoid the clichéd “personal 
preference” argument in reviews, but this 
foible of what are otherwise exemplary 
switches is something to be aware of. 
We can’t argue that SteelSeries has 
gotten everything else right, either. The 
Apex M750 lacks a few of those luxury 
options that would really make it a top-line 
driver. There’s no braided or detachable 
cable, for instance, and we don’t have 
supreme confidence in the long-term 
integrity of the one that’s included. There’s 
no USB or media pass-through, either. And 
the height adjustment just consists of an 
alternate pair of rubber feet, included in the 
box—sure, this grips the desk and doesn’t 
let go, but swapping feet is a tricky solution 
to a problem that was adequately solved 30 
years ago by clip-out legs. However, for all 
the M750’s little issues, SteelSeries has 
done the big things just right, and satisfied 
all our senses. –alex cox

There’s a renewed push toward wireless 
from peripheral manufacturers lately, 
evidenced by SteelSeries’s great Arctis 
range, and more pertinently by Corsair’s 
cable-free Void Pro RGB Wireless. As 
consumers are responding to the word 
with 
fewer 
negative 
preconceptions, 
there’s a gap in the market to be occupied 
by the headset that gets it all right, at the 
most inviting price. But let’s be direct: That 
headset isn’t the Void Pro RGB Wireless.
That’s not to say it’s an outright bad 
product. There’s plenty to like, much of 
it what we liked about the last round of 
Void headsets: decent, affordable sound, 
driven by 50mm drivers that don’t distort 
at higher volumes, sensible controls, and 
a comfortable, adjustable fit. Notable 
upgrades in this new model of Void are an 
improved microphone and memory foam 
pads. Starting with the mic, it sounds about 
the same as it does in the old model to our 
ears: a bit quieter than most and lacking 
low-end, but featuring strong and precise 
noise-canceling, which can kill the sound 
of mechanical keys tap-tapping away 
without clipping your voice.
Instead, the improvements lie in the mic 
arm. It’s a more flexible rubberized design 
this time, which can be positioned to fit, 
and there’s a mute switch built in, so that 
pushing the mic into the upward position 
mutes it. We like the red light on the mic, 
which indicates it’s muted, too, though 
we’re not sure why there’s also a separate 
mic mute button on the left earcup. It made 
sense to put it there in the old model, but 
now with the hinge mute and a power 
button positioned precariously above the 
old mute button, it seems unnecessary. 
The memory foam pads are an unreserved 
improvement, though. Although neither 
this nor the previous Void feel luxurious 
in their construction materials, this softer 
padding around the earcups and under the 
headband goes some way to addressing 
that. It certainly helps in lengthy wear

Back to the wireless, though. We’d heard 
reports that running the RGB lights 
severely impacted the 12-hour battery life 
Corsair states in its specs, and found that, 
sure enough, we got under five hours of life 
when running a lighting pattern through 
them (customizable via the CUE software). 
Turning lighting off completely actually 
extended the battery life marginally over 
12 hours, so it’s clear lighting is a huge 
drain on battery life. More annoying still, 
the headset doesn’t turn itself off after you 
shut your PC down, so it’s very likely you’ll 
return in the morning to some dead cans. 
Putting those bizarre issues behind us, 
it has plenty else to offer. If you’re a virtual 
surround hater, these cans won’t convert 
you, but for everyone else, the laudable 
Dolby Headphone 7.1 digital surround is 
well implemented. We still prefer to run 
them in stereo, though, for the improved 
precision to the mids and low-end 
frequencies, and that’s easily achieved by 
hitting a single button in CUE. As with all 
other headsets in Corsair’s fleet, there’s 
a range of EQ presets to cycle through in 
there, and although we’re stick-in-the-
muds who always favor a flat response, it’s 
nice to have the option. The wireless range 
extended across our entire apartment, 
including through walls, so there are no 
problems there. It’s worth knowing that 
the supplied charge cable is just that, 
though—you always need the USB wireless 
receiver to use these cans. Moreover, 
mobile device cables such as those offered 
by SteelSeries’s Arctis models are absent 
here, and we feel that lack keenly.
Totting up all the pros and cons, it’s 
another competent offering from Corsair, 
but it doesn’t really deliver on its central 
idea: wireless RGB sound. If you don’t care 
about lights, opt for an Arctis. If you do, 
choose a wired headset. –Phil iwaniuk

The case has the simplest job of all PC 
hardware: house all the other components, 
and look good while doing it. Granted, 
keeping everything cool, quiet, and dust-
free is important, too, but compared to the 
bazillion floating-point calculations your 
graphics card has to do, it’s an easy life. Yet 
picking a model that checks all these boxes 
is never as easy as you’d first imagine. 
We’re often channeled into distinct routes 
by manufacturers: quiet cases or cases 
with great cooling options. Budget cases or 
cases that don’t tear your hands to ribbons 
when you try to build in them. 
Fractal’s Meshify C forces no such 
compromise on you in exchange for its 
$90. As the name suggests, the all-mesh 
front panel sets the case up for a clear 
airflow, and despite its budget pricing, the 
tempered glass side panel offers a high- 
quality aesthetic. Inside, a PSU shroud 
and excellent cable management options 
double down on those existing visual and 
airflow strengths, along with nice touches 
such as a bracket behind the motherboard 
where up to three SSDs can be mounted. 
These can also be removed during a build 
to allow easy access to the motherboard’s 
rear when fitting a CPU cooler, which is 
a real blessing, because fitting coolers 
is often the most arduous part of a build. 
We’ve got the scars to prove it. 
The enclosure at the Meshify’s base 
also houses storage bays, and although it’s 
always preferable to use a modular PSU 
in this type of setup, in order to make life 
easier when it comes to cable management 
(not to mention getting the rear panel back 
on the thing), we were able to fit a non-
modular PSU, with ample room to store 
the unused cables between the unit itself 
and the storage bays. The internal panel 
on to which the motherboard is fitted also

finish it all off, the side cutaways are fitted 
with rubber grommets and are slightly 
angled, which enabled us to make those 
connections to the GPU that bit more easily. 
Despite housing ATX, mATX, and ITX 
systems, this case runs shorter along 
its length than most mid-tower models. 
We like the visual effect of that, and the 
space-saving, but it does mean that three-
fan graphics cards are a really tight fit. 
Fractal’s spec sheet states 12.4 inches 
of clearance for GPUs and, true enough, 
we could install our 12-inch Radeon HD 
6990, but it was a cigarette paper’s width 
away from the supplied Dynamix X2 GP-12 
120mm front fan. There’s always the option 
of removing that fan, but it’s something to 
be aware of if you’re packing an oversized 
chunk of PCB on graphics duty. Options for 
fitting more than the two supplied 120mm 
fans or swapping them out for radiators 
are good—there are seven fan mounts 
throughout the case, and room for radiators 
at the front and top, with dust filters placed 
here and below the PSU. Bonus points are 
awarded for a front removal mechanism 
for the bottom filter—no need to move the 
whole machine to access it. 
We’re left with very little to grumble 
about. The only obvious concessions to 
its sub-$100 pricing come in the top panel 
magnetic dust filter, which isn’t very closely 
fitted to its inlay and looks noticeably 
cheaper than the rest of the case, and a 
flimsy front panel, which has a bit too much 
give to instil any confidence. That’s literally 
it: two tiny grumbles about an otherwise 
exemplary case with features you’d expect 
from a much pricier model. Meshify, it was 
a pleasure to build in you. –Phil iwaniuk

Lone Echo, but things are very different 
aboard abandoned space station Tacoma.
There’s no VR for one thing, centrifugal 
force mostly preventing the free-floating 
that made the Kronos II so exciting. You do 
have AR, however—the station’s systems 
interface with your suit or implants to 
display a floating display in front of you.
Tacoma is a space station but needn’t 
be. You could be exploring anywhere, and 
Fullbright has previous in this area, having 
produced 2013’s Gone Home. It’s not the 
larger environment that matters, but the 
detail. The contents of lockers are what 
you’ve come to see, not the austere beauty 
of nebulae and planetary rings.
There’s a plot of sorts. You’ve come to 
download the station’s computer core, and 
that means placing a magic box on various 
conduits and waiting until the completion 
percentage inches its way painfully up. You 
need something to do while waiting—you 
could just stand there, but with 0.1 percent 
completion every 10 seconds or so, it’s not 
recommended. So you go off and explore.
That’s where the AR comes into its own.

them. Just about anything can be picked 
up and examined, and you’ll watch every 
recording several times, following each 
participant as their audio cuts out when they 
leave a room. In a concession to playability, 
discovering emails and voice messages in 
AR makes the device you’ve attached to the 
wall tick toward completion faster.
Exploration games—walking simulators 
by another name—might not be to everyone’s 
taste, and the somewhat primitive graphical 
style will do less to draw in players than 
the low system requirements and bargain 
price. But this voyeurism game shouldn’t 
be overlooked, as it does more to advance 
the cause of great writing and emotional 
characterization in games than a thousand 
ravening warriors ever could. –ian evenden
are recoverable from the environments, and 
while you watch these, you’ll find fragments 
of their own AR systems can be viewed. 
From this you build up a picture of not just 
what happened to the astronauts—a tale of 
corporate scheming and AI gone wrong—
but also the lives, hopes, fears, and dreams 
of the crew members themselves.
This is where the game becomes most 
affecting. The crew are fully drawn, a diverse 
bunch sympathetically treated, packed with 
human flaws, needing instructions on how 
to have a good time, and stuck in space with 
little to do but think about their loved ones 
and failures. Gently, you tease out their 
stories, and that of the entire human race 
since 2017 along with them. And as you 
slowly—not that slowly, it’s a quick game 
to finish—assemble the jigsaw of events 
and thoughts, something emerges from the 
conjunction of environmental design and 
conversational vignettes that makes the 
world feel complete.
It’s perhaps not the most interactive 
game, as you mainly stand and watch, 
affecting events with pause and rewind 
buttons that don’t actually change the events 
themselves but rather your perception of

A Pict who paints a thousand words
Hellblade: Senua’s Sacrifice
A lone wArrior mAking a redemptive 
journey into a terrifying place is something 
we’ve all seen before. Add mythology, 
haunting structures, some really dark bits, 
basic shape-matching puzzles, and creepy-
looking guys who want to kill you, and the 
fantasy hack ’n’ slash game is complete. 
How do you make it fresh again?
Ninja Theory, developer of PlayStation’s 
Heavenly Sword and multiplatform DmC, 
thinks it can do it with characterization. 
Senua is a Scottish tribeswoman who has 
seen her home overrun and lover killed by 
Scandinavian invaders. So, she carries his 
severed head into the Norse hell to avenge 
him. On its own, that would be easy to mock, 
but Ninja Theory has found a way to scatter 
uniqueness throughout the game: making 
Senua mentally ill.
She hears voices and has hallucinations. 
You can never be sure whether what you’re 
seeing is really real, or if it’s only real to 
Senua. Maybe she spends the whole game 
locked in a hut, her adventure playing out 
only in her mind, or maybe she really does it. 
Maybe those are the invaders she’s slaying, 
not skull-headed demons. The developers 
worked with neuroscientists and other 
this; it’s too harsh, too contrasting, and 
exactly the sort of thing games do well.
Combat is informed by its creators’ work 
on DmC, becoming a fluid dance of rolls, 
blocks, and strikes. That the game doesn’t 
think to tell you any of this is annoying—an 
early battle you’re not meant to win gives 
you just enough insight to know how to 
fight, even if the camera decided to tuck 
itself away behind a tree the first time we 
played it. Difficulty is adaptive, but if you’re 
struggling, and worried about the game’s 
threats to delete your save, it’s worth 
setting it in easy mode and persevering, 
because Hellblade has sights to show you, 
and they’re not all hellish. –iAn evenden
Senua’s model is 
highly realistic.
The lighting is extremely 
pretty at times.
Skull-headed foes are a challenge, but 
you learn to dispatch them quickly.
experts to get the tone right, hoping to stave 
off the backlash a thoughtless treatment 
of the subject would bring. Senua’s blue 
painted face and matted hair may mark her 
out among videogame heroines, and Melina 
Juergens’s mo-cap performance is spot-
on, but it’s her voices you’ll remember long 
after the game is completed.
The Unreal 4-powered environments, 
heavy on effects, often take a trip to the 
brown world, all mud and dark caves, but 
the sound design is remarkable. It tells you 
up-front that it’s best played with positional 
headphones, and whacking on a pair 
surrounds you with the voices of Senua’s 
mind, cajoling and questioning you, warning 
you, sowing doubt. It’s one of the greatest 
uses of voice acting and 3D audio we’ve 
come across, and spinning on the spot in an 
early enemy-free section is an excuse just 
to drink it all in. Played with speakers, even 
surround sound, just isn’t such an intense 
experience, with stereo being particularly 
weak, thanks to a headset’s ability to drown 
out ambient noise.
With no HUD, and subtitles off by default, 
it would be easy to describe it as “cinematic.” 
But almost no one would make a film like

 Striking Looks OK; sounds 
amazing; lots to reveal.
 Viking Puzzle sections under-developed; 
lack of combat instructions.

Intel’s 
eIghth-generatIon 
CPUs 
are 
almost upon us, and they’re already looking 
intriguing, if only for the fact that we’ll see 
three technologies under that banner: a 
Kaby Lake refresh (14nm+), Coffee Lake 
(14nm++), and Cannonlake (10nm). It’s the 
laptop chips that we’ll see first, though, 
and I’m more stoked about these than the 
desktop counterparts, if only for personal 
reasons—I’m in the market for a new laptop. 
With Ryzen kicking things up elsewhere, 
laptops feel like Intel’s last bastion of 
dominance. Its tech has focused on laptop-
loving efficiency for years, and AMD has 
always struggled to get chips into portable 
systems. Intel has come out swinging with 
its eighth-gen chips, though, squeezing an 
extra pair of cores into its mobile offerings. 
If you’re familiar with Intel’s desktop lines, 
you’ll know that traditionally the difference 
between a Core i7 and a Core i5 is that the 
latter doesn’t support HyperThreading. But 
with its eighth-gen chips, that isn’t the case. 
Four 14nm chips have been announced so 
far: Core i7-8550U, i7-8650U, i5-8350U, and 
i5-8250U, and the weird thing is that they all 
have four cores and are capable of handling 
eight threads at once. The difference? 
Cache. Both Core i7 chips have access to 
8MB of SmartCache, while the lowly Core 
i5s only lay claim to 6MB. A difference, but 
not quite in the same league as the outgoing 
lack of HyperThreading, or the fact that 
the equivalent chips from the previous 
generation had half the number of cores. 
These chips are ultra low-power models 
designed for ultrabooks, two-in-ones, and 
all-in-ones, with a TDP of just 15W, but they 
do indicate that Intel isn’t taking anything 
for granted anymore, even if it does mean 
messing with our understanding of what 
separates a Core i7 from an i5. It looks like I 
couldn’t have picked a better time to upgrade 
my old laptop, it’s just a case of seeing what 
the system builders do with these chips now.
Forget all you know about its lineup
Intel’s Perplexing 
Next Generation
Apple has just launched its 
latest iPhones, the 8, 8 Plus, 
and the new super-sized 
iPhone X (pronounced “ten,” 
which makes me wonder what 
Apple is going to do after the 
inevitable iPhone 9). The X 
is almost entirely screen on 
the front, with a notch out of 
the top for the camera. The 
A11 processor nestled inside

probably 
even

Based upon my shellacking 
of the Predator 21 X’s 1080p 
screen in my review (pg. 82), 
you might think I’m a high-
resolution purist, only willing 
to feast my eyes upon panels 
of a certain pixel density. Quite 
the opposite, in fact! 1080p 
is actually my resolution of 
choice, 
giving 
me 
access 
to higher refresh rates at a 
reasonable price point. 4K is 
an old Core 2 Duo a run for 
its money, but the iPhone X 
starts at a staggering $999, 
which is insane even by Apple 
standards. You can build a 
complete gaming desktop for 
less than that, and it will still 
be running absolutely fine in 
five years. I think the new live 
emojis basically sum things 
up, which are a step down even 
from the abysmal Emoji Movie.
chained to 60Hz until the next 
generation of high-end gaming 
panels arrives early next year, 
and while 1440p has a plethora 
of high-speed options, they 
aren’t cheap. With 1080p, I can 
easily hit top-end frame rates 
and eliminate screen tearing 
with not-absurd hardware—
and when I’m spinning my 
crosshairs around to track that

It took me a long time to get my head 
around “gaming chairs”—those bucket 
seat designs that fool nobody. Seriously, 
there are no Gs in gaming. And if there 
are, you’re doing it wrong. Problem is, 
if you’re looking for a premium office 
chair, you’re penned into one style of 
stool. As much as you hate them, gaming 
chairs are competing against one 
another in a far more aggressive market 
than standard furniture companies. 
Which means better designs, better 
prices, and greater improvements.
My gripe is that ridiculous bucket 
style. I don’t need that—I want a chair 
that looks like an office chair, not some 
plumped-up, 
go-faster 
bucket 
that 
would look more at home in a stock car 
than next to my glamorous setup.
So when Noblechairs announced 
its latest range of ICON gaming chairs, 
it was a no-brainer. Having used the 
bucket variant at work, I trotted the 
black/platinum one home, placed my 
posterior on it, and realized how much 
better it was. Consisting of a faux leather 
finish, hard padded armrests, memory 
foam, a variety of adjustments, tilts, and 
rockers, it’s a joy to sit in.
I have two setups for it: a relaxed style, 
where I can prop my feet up on my desk, 
and a serious “I care about my posture” 
style, with a higher angled backrest. It’s 
a fair price if you’ve got the dollar, and 
its comfort, ease of construction, and 
luscious style makes it stand out from 
the rest of the gaming chair market. –Zs

Dell S718Ql 4K laSer 
Projector
I’m a fan of projectors. 
There’s 
nothing 
like 
having a massive image 
on your wall to gawk at 
while relishing in the fact that no “monitor” 
can come close to a projected image. Right 
now, I use two 32-inch 4K displays, but 
Dell’s new S718QL is in a league of its own.
The S718QL is no ordinary projector. 
First, it supports 4K, which is a requirement 
for me now. I can’t go back to 1080p. Second, 
it’s got lasers! There’s no DLP. There’s no 
LED. There’s no hot bulb to burn out. The 
laser diodes in the S718QL last many times 
longer, and illuminate much better, with 
unmatched contrast. But the unique thing 
about the S718QL is its short-throw design. 
What’s that?
Usually, projectors have a minimum 
distance that they need to be away from a 
screen or wall to produce a decent image. 
If you want, say, a 100-inch image, you have 
to place a typical projector across the room, 
several feet away. Not so with the S718QL. 
Dell’s short-throw laser design enables 
the projector to produce a sharp and crisp  
100-inch image while sitting just a foot 
away from the wall. That means projector 
positioning is flexible and image contrast is 
even better. This is my ultimate “display.”

HellblaDe:  
Senua’S Sacrifice
Mixing Norse and Pictish 
mythology, 
Hellblade: 
Senua’s Sacrifice (see 
pg. 91) follows a young 
Pict warrior from the Orkney islands as 
she pursues the Viking raider party that 
slaughtered her village and decapitated her 
lover, into the depths of Viking Hell.
Except she’s not entirely there. Senua 
suffers from an aggressive form of 
psychosis, 
that 
causes 
hallucinations, 
visions, and voices. The way the devs have 
handled it is incredible. Speaking to people 
who have suffered from psychosis in real 
life, and working with a variety of doctors 
and psychologists, Ninja Theory has very 
graciously tackled an issue not often seen in 
the gaming industry.
The game is exceptionally cinematic, 
with barely any user interface whatsoever. 
But it’s the technology that really draws 
your breath away. Whether it’s the binaural 
3D audio voices whispering in your ear, or 
the graphical hallucinations and fading 
superimposed live acting on top of in-engine 
game cinematics, no two moments or two 
environments feel the same.
If you’ve ever battled the big black demon, 
you’ll find it an unnerving experience that’s 
all too relatable.

Networking Perfection
I’ve never written in before, 
but the July issue’s “Set 
Up the Perfect Network,” 
by Nick Peers, made me 
scratch my head and think, 
“Is this really Maximum?”
Don’t get me wrong—
he did a great job. His 
information is correct for 
small home networks, if 
you happen to have just a 
cable modem for your WAN, 
a wired desktop, a network 
attached printer, a laptop, 
and not much else on your 
network. If that’s the case, 
one of the good quality Port 
Address Translation (PAT) 
type devices mentioned in 
the article is a great choice.
Unfortunately, something 
like that would never cut it in 
my home network and many 
others I have come across 
as we move further into a 
more connected household 
(connected refrigerator, 
stove, and so on).
Please see the photo of 
the small rack/case that 
houses the equipment 
(above-right). Side note: 
Notice the Apple II theme. 
I happen to collect Apple II 
machines, so we wanted to 
give the network cabinet a 
theme for fun. It’s painted 
Platinum like the later Apple 
IIe Platinum Computers, 
and the patch cables, along 
with the Keystones, are done 
in the Apple Color Pattern. It 
even has an authentic color 
Apple window decal.
It would be great to do a 
follow-up article, as I am 
sure I’m not the only reader 
for whom four LAN ports 
are not going to handle 
their home network. I chose 
Ubiquiti for my equipment, 
but Netgear and Linksys/
Cisco both make some great 
and affordable SOHO/non-
enterprise level gear that is 
well suited for a medium to 
large home install. –Copper
ExEcutivE Editor,  
AlAn dExtEr rEsponds: 
You’re right, the original 
article was indeed just to 
show what you can do with 
a smaller network, with the 
idea that you can expand on 
it for larger networks. It’s 
amazing how many devices 
we have connected these 
days, especially when it 
comes to tablets, phones, 
and everything else that 
we routinely connect up 
wirelessly. A more advanced 
feature is already lined up.
Pro Thinking
I will keep this real simple: 
Why would you NOT use 
Windows 10 Pro in an 
$18,000-plus 2017 Dream 
Machine that is supposed to 
really push the limits of all 
you can do? I use Win 10 Pro 
on my $3,000-plus dream 
machine. 
–Jay Martinson
ExEcutivE Editor,  
AlAn dExtEr rEsponds: 
We may exhibit a hang-the-
cost attitude when it comes 
to hardware, but we’re still 
driven by performance, 
and that extends to the 
OS. The truth is, there’s 
nothing in the Pro version 
of Windows 10 that brings 
a performance boost to our 
Dream Machine. Sure, you 
may want things such as 
BitLocker, Domain Network 
support, Remote Desktop, 
Hyper-V, and so on, but 
none of these will make a 
difference to the underlying 
speed. The only feature of 
any interest is the amount 
of RAM supported: Windows 
Home supports up to 128GB, 
while Windows 10 Pro can 
take you to 2TB. Not an issue 
for this year’s machine, but 
it may be in the future. 
Custom Loader
I’ve been trying to install 
the Grub Customizer as 
described on page 53 of the 
June 2017 issue. I’ve entered 
all the steps, but when I do 
the last step— sudo apt-get 
install grub-customizer —I 
get an error: “This PPA does 
not support xenial.”
What do I need to do? I’m 
running Mint 18.2 Cinnamon 
edition.

ExEcutivE Editor,  
AlAn dExtEr rEsponds:
You’ll quickly find yourself 
disappearing down the 
rabbit hole trying to track 
down why this is happening, 
but it generally comes 
down to the fact that the 
Grub Customizer isn’t in the 
default repositories. The 
app is maintained by Daniel 
Richter, and the commands 
in the feature show you how 
to add the repository so that 
you can install it. 
It looks like something’s 
going awry at the install 
stage though—Xenial is the 
codename for Ubuntu 16.04, 
which forms the basis of 
your Mint 18.2 install. You 
usually see a “This PPA does 
not support xenial” error 
when the application is out 
of date, but Grub Customizer 
has been updated recently, 
so we suggest retrying (we 
don’t have a problem with 
the app here—we’ve just 
double-checked). You may 
also get this message if it’s 
already installed—so that’s 
worth checking as well. The 
only other thing we can think 
of is that you’re skipping the  
 apt-get update  after adding 
the repository, which will 
cause it to fail, so make sure 
you do so. Failing that, you 
can achieve pretty much 
everything you can do with 
Grub Customizer manually, 
although as this affects how 
your machine boots, you 
need to get a really good 
grasp of how it works first. 
Incompatible Pins
Based on the article by 
Alan Dexter in the August 
2017 issue of Maximum PC, 
I have a question: Where 
exactly is one supposed to 
connect the case fan of the 
Phanteks Enthoo Evolve ITX 
on the Asus ROG Strix B250I 
gaming motherboard? I can 
only see two places from 
the motherboard manual 
to connect fans, and both 
have four pins. The female 
connector for the fan has 
three openings. Am I missing 
something? This is my first 
attempt at a build, and I am 
hung up here.  –Don Thomas
ExEcutivE Editor,  
AlAn dExtEr rEsponds:
You’re not missing anything, 
just a slight oversight on our 
part. The four pins on the 
motherboard support PWM 
fans, while the three-pin 
versions are DC. You can 
slide that three-pin female 
connector on top of the 
four-pin male header (and 
connect a four-pin fan to 
a three-pin connector as 
well). We do it so often, we 
didn’t even think to comment 
on it. It’ll only fit one way 
round, so don’t worry about 
getting it wrong.
Smaller is Better
The “Mini-ITX vs. ATX” 
article in the Sep 2017 issue 
doesn’t say anything that 
most wouldn’t already know. 
It doesn’t go into how cool 
Mini-ITX motherboards are. 
When the third-gen Core 
i5 came out, I built my first 
Mini-ITX system—a gaming 
rig that I could take to LAN 
parties. I used a BitFenix 
Prodigy case. The case has 
room for the Asus R9-390 
video card. The motherboard 
I wanted to try was the 
Asus Z170I Pro Gaming. I 
found out I could put a Core 
i7-7700k in my system with 
a BIOS update. I also added 
a Corsair H100i. I set the 
video card to run my three 
24-inch Asus monitors, so I 
could play CS:GO over three 
screens. The mobo had EZ 
overclocking options, so I got 
the CPU up to about 5GHz. I 
have one SSD for Windows, 
and one 4TB for games and 
storage. The Mini-ITX board 
can have up to 32GB of RAM, 
which I put in. For music, I 
have a USB DAC/amp and a 
high-end USB mic. I agree 
at the end of the article that 
Mini-ITX motherboards work 
as hard as ATX boards. For 
the size of what I built, it 
does so much, and is easy 
to take to LAN parties. 
Everyone should take a look 
at Mini-ITX. 
–Chris Yusko
ExEcutivE Editor,  
AlAn dExtEr rEsponds:
Part of the point of the 
article was to highlight 
the fact that smaller form 
factors won’t hold you back. 
While you may have fallen 
in love with the convenience 
and versatility of these tiny 
machines, there are plenty 
of readers who are unaware 
of their charms. Maybe your 
letter will convince a few 
over to your way of thinking.
Processor Elimination
Just getting around to the 
Ryzen 5 1500X CPU review 
in your July issue. It looks 
solid, but is the R5 line more 
about price at four-core 
processing? AMD’s eight-
core line was already priced 
competitively, so I was 
curious about the move 
to four-core—it does box 
Intel into “innovate or keep 
pushing cores.” I’m weighing 
my options, and Intel’s Kaby 
Lake is out as I don't like the 
name (sad but true, and a 
few other choice reasons). 
Skylake-X is impressive, but 
too expensive. R7 1800X has 
my eye at the moment, just 
waiting for the last roll-outs 
this fall. I think you've 
answered this before—
maybe I just need to hear the 
answer again. With a $500 
CPU budget, should I buy 
now, or wait for the year-end 
review?  
–Ryan Anthony
ExEcutivE Editor,  
AlAn dExtEr rEsponds:
The Ryzen CPU lineup is 
complete (though we expect 
to see APUs before the 
year’s out), and we’ve given 
our opinion on pretty much 
every chip: They’re all good, 
but there are some standout 
offerings. The Ryzen 7 
1800X has the raw power, 
while the Ryzen 7 1700 can 
hit the same performance 
at a cheaper price point (but 
you need to overclock it to 
get the most from it). The 
Ryzen 5 1600X is the best 
overall value proposition, 
if you don’t need all eight 
cores, while Threadripper 
demolishes the high end. 
We are about to get a new 
generation of Intel chips, 
which could mix things up, 
though I doubt we’ll see 
any significant price drops, 
so we recommend pulling 
the trigger on the Ryzen 7 
1800X, and enjoying your 
new build. 
I wanted to share a few pictures of my gaming PC build. I 
saw a post on your Facebook page about your Dream 
Machine, and wanted to send a few pics of my own build. 
I use a wheelchair to get around, but it didn’t stop me 
from building my own PC! Thanks for all the amazing 
magazines, and I can't wait to see the latest issue!

Ryzen 3 1200 up to $450 for the Ryzen 7 1800X. For a while now, we’ve 
been recommending the Ryzen 5 1400, just to try to hit a reasonable 
price point, but the world of cryptocurrency has undermined this 
anyway, so this month we’ve decided to go with the chip we’ve wanted 
in our mid-range machine since day one, and that’s the six-core Ryzen 
5 1600. It’s a little pricier than the previous Ryzen 5 1400, but you do 
get 50 percent more cores for the extra $50 outlay. The good news is 
that we saw a significant price drop on the GTX 1070 Mini—$35, to be 
exact—and when combined with a $10 saving on the SSD and another 
$5 reduction on the case, overall we’re looking at the same total price 
as last month, yet we’ve come away with a six-core machine instead 
of a quad-core PC.
We’re all abouT saving cash when it comes to our budget build, 
so we were eyeing up the windowless version of the Enthoo Evolv 
ITX case, when we noticed that the one we had from last month had 
dropped $5. We saw a $10 saving on our motherboard of choice as 
well, which we’re never going to turn down. On top of that, we’ve seen 
the pricing on graphics cards begin to calm down, which meant we 
could snap up a Gigabyte GeForce GTX 1050 Ti for a slightly more 
reasonable $150—another $10 saving over last month’s card. The 
card comes with Rocket League, too, which is a great little game. 
RAM was $1 more expensive for the same memory as last month, 
which could be a sign that RAM price rises are coming to an end. 
That’s probably just hopeful thinking, though. We did see a price hike 
on our default SSD as well, so have switched to a Plextor drive to help 
bring the overall cost of this machine to $28 less than last month.

turBo
Now that we have the full Ryzen family to pick from, we’re 
beginning to find ourselves drawn to specific chips at certain 
price points. As we’ve shown in this month’s mid-range build, 
this six-core chip has a lot to recommend it—with plenty of 
multithreading oomph and a max turbo of 3.6GHz to help 
get the job done where straight line frequency matters. The 
pricing is good, and the Wraith Spire cooler puts in a good turn 
keeping the chip chilled if you don’t have the funds for an all-
in-one cooler. A great mainstream chip.
$215, www.amd.com 
There isn’T a loT of good neWs when it comes to the pricing of our 
turbo build this month. Memory is the big culprit once again, with the 
G.Skill TridentZ kit we’ve previously used seeing a $40 price increase 
over last month. This is enough to make us look for an alternative, but 
it actually turns out that even at its elevated cost, it’s still the cheapest 
32GB option out there. Ouch!
We saw a $10 increase on the power supply, too, which isn’t 
something that happens often. Even so, we’re happy to keep with 
the Corsair RM750X, because it has served us well. There was a $2 
increase on our SSD of choice, although it’ll take a lot more than a 
couple of bucks to turn us away from the stunning 960 Pro. At least 
until its replacement lands. 
Unfortunately, the graphics card we recommended for last month’s 
turbo build, the Gigabyte GeForce GTX 1080 Ti Gaming OC Black, was 
out of stock, and had seen a $40 price hike in the meantime, too. We’re 
loathe to drop the 1080 Ti from our high-end build, simply because 
the performance is so incredible, so instead of keeping one hand 
on our wallets and dropping down to the non-Ti version of the card, 
we’ve instead invested in the EVGA GeForce GTX 1080 Ti SC Black 
Edition. This twin-fan card has a base clock of 1,556MHz and a boost 
of 1,670MHz, which is significantly more than the stock frequencies of 
1,480MHz and 1,582MHz respectively. So, while there isn’t a lot of good 
news here, ultimately this is a slightly more powerful gaming rig than 
last month’s build.
