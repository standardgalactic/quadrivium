WHILE CATEGORICAL LOGIC is of very recent origin, its evolution is inseparable from 
that of category theory itself, so rendering it effectively impossible to do the subject full 
justice within the space of a comparatively short article. I have elected to begin with a 
historical survey in which I hope to have touched on most of the major developments 
(as well as a number of interesting minor ones) in categorical logic, following which I 
offer a more detailed presentation of a number of aspects of the subject.

1.  Categorical Logic: An Historical Sketch. 
 
 
  
Category theory was invented by Eilenberg and Mac Lane in 1945, and by the 
1950s its concepts and methods had become standard in algebraic topology and 
algebraic geometry. But few topologists and geometers had much interest in logic. And 
although the use of algebraic techniques was long-established in logic, starting with 
Boole and continuing right up to Tarski and his school, logicians of the day were, by 
and large, unacquainted with category theory. It was in fact an algebraist, J. Lambek, 
who first discerned analogies between category theory and logic, pointing out the 
similarities between the axioms for categories and deductive systems such as those 
introduced in the 1930s by Gentzen. However, the idea of recasting the entire 
apparatus of logic—semantics as well as syntax—in category-theoretic terms, creating 
thereby a full-fledged “categorical logic”, rests with the visionary category-theorist F. 
William Lawvere. In Lawvere’s pioneering work, which came to be known as functorial 
semantics (first presented in his 1963 Columbia thesis and summarized that same year 
in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the U.S.A: Lawvere 1963; see 
also Lawvere 1965), an algebraic theory is identified as a category of a particular kind, 
an interpretation of one theory in another as a functor between them, and a model of 
such a theory as a functor on it to the category of sets. Lawvere also began to extend 
the categorical description of algebraic (or equational) theories to full first-order, or 
elementary theories, building on his observation that existential and universal 
quantification can be seen as left and right adjoints, respectively, of substitution 
(Lawvere 1966a and 1967). This necessitated the introduction of the notion—one which 
was to prove of great importance in later developments—of an object of truth values so 
as to enable relations and partially defined operations to be described. The idea of a 
truth-value object was further explored in Lawvere (1969) and (1970); the latter paper 
contains in particular the observation that the presence of such an object in a category 
enables the comprehension principle to be reduced to an elementary statement about 
adjoint functors. 
But Lawvere had a still greater goal in view. He was convinced that category theory, 
resting on the bedrock concepts of map and map composition, could serve as a 
foundation for mathematics reflecting its essence in a direct and faithful fashion 
unmatchable by its “official” foundation, set theory. A first step taken toward this goal 
was Lawvere’s publication, in 1964, of an “elementary” description of the category of 
sets (Lawvere 1964) followed in 1966 by a similar description of the category of 
categories. In the former paper is to be found the first published appearance of the 
categorical characterization of the natural number system, later to become known as 
the Peano-Lawvere axiom. In another direction, reflecting his abiding interest in 
physics, Lawvere hoped to develop a foundation for continuum mechanics in category-
theoretic terms. In lectures given in several places during 1967 (as later reported in 
Lawvere 1979) he suggested that such a foundation should be sought “on the basis of a 
direct axiomatization of the essence of differential topology using results and methods 
of algebraic geometry.” And to achieve this, in turn, would require “ [an] axiomatic 
study of categories of smooth sets, similar to the topos of Grothendieck”—in other 
words, an elementary axiomatic description of Grothendieck toposes—categories of 
sheaves on a site, that is, a category equipped with a Grothendieck topology.  
 
In 1969–70 Lawvere, working in collaboration with Myles Tierney, finally wove 
these strands together (see Lawvere 1971 and Tierney 1972, 1973). Lawvere had 
previously observed that every Grothendieck topos had an object of truth values, and 
that Grothendieck topologies are closely connected with self-maps on that object. 
Accordingly  Lawvere  and  Tierney  began  to investigate in earnest the consequences 
of  

 
4
 
taking as an axiom the existence of an object of truth values: the result was a concept 
of amazing fertility, that of elementary topos—a cartesian closed category equipped with 
an object of truth values1. In addition to providing a natural generalization of 
elementary—i.e., first-order—theories, the concept of elementary topos, more 
importantly, furnished the appropriate elementary notion of a category of sheaves; in 
Lawvere’s powerful metaphor, a topos could be seen as a category of variable sets 
(varying over a topological space, or a general category). The usual category of sets 
(itself, of course, a topos) could then be thought of as being composed of “constant” 
sets.  
Lawvere and Tierney’s ideas were taken up with enthusiasm and quickly developed 
further by several mathematicians, notably P. Freyd, J. Bénabou and his student J. 
Celeyrette, G. C. Wraith, and A. Kock and his student C. J. Mikkelsen. (See Freyd 1972, 
Bénabou and Celeyrette 1971, Kock and Wraith 1971, and Mikkelsen 1976.)  
The fact that a topos possesses an object of truth values made it apparent that 
logic could be “done” in a topos; from the fact that this object is not normally a Boolean 
but a Heyting algebra it followed that a topos’s “internal” logic is, in general, 
intuitionistic. (A Boolean topos, e.g. the topos of sets, is one whose object of truth values 
is a Boolean algebra; in that event its internal logic is classical.) It was William Mitchell 
(Mitchell (1972)) who first put forward in print the idea that logical “reasoning” in a 
topos should be performed in an explicit language resembling that of set theory, the 
topos’s internal language. (The internal language was also invented, independently, by 
André Joyal and Jean Bénabou.) This language and its logic soon became identified as 
a form of intuitionistic type theory, or higher-order intuitionistic logic, and underwent 
rapid development at many hands. Systems include those of Boileau (1975), Coste 
(1974), Boileau and Joyal (1981), Lambek and P. J. Scott (1986, based on earlier work 
of theirs), Zangwill (1977), and Fourman (1974, 1977), whose system, incorporating 
suggestions of Dana Scott, includes a description operator and an existence predicate. 
In Scott (1979) a system of higher-order intuitionistic logic is described, suitable for 
interpretation in toposes, which includes a description operator and an existence 
predicate. Fourman and Scott (1979) discuss in great detail the models of this logic 
given by sheaves and presheaves  over a complete Heyting algebra Ω, the so-called Ω-
sets. It should also be mentioned that Higgs (1973) independently defined the notion of 
Ω-set and established the equivalence, for a complete Boolean algebra B, of the topos of 
B-sets both with category of sets and maps in the Boolean extension V(B)  of the universe 
of sets and with the category of canonical set-valued sheaves on B. 
Just as each topos determines a type theory, so each type theory generates a topos, 
a fact discovered independently by several mathematicians, including Coste (1974), 
Fourman (1974), Lambek (1974), Boileau (1975), and Volger (1975).  
A major stimulus behind Lawvere and Tierney’s development of elementary topos 
theory was the desire to provide a categorical formulation of Cohen’s proof (see Cohen 
1965) of the independence of the continuum hypothesis from the axioms of set theory. 
This categorical version is given in Tierney (1972); later Bunge (1974) extended the 
method to give a categorical proof of the independence of Souslin’s hypothesis. These 
results made it a pressing matter to determine the precise relationship between 
elementary topos theory and axiomatic set theory. The problem was resolved 
independently by Cole (1973), Mitchell (1972) and Osius (1975), each of whom showed 
that elementary topos theory, with the addition of certain “set-like” axioms, is logically 
equivalent to the weak (in fact finitely axiomatizable) version of Zermelo set theory in 
                                               
1 Lawvere and Tierney’s definition of elementary topos originally required the presence of finite limits and 
colimits—these were later shown to be eliminable.

which the axiom scheme of separation is taken in its “predicative” form, that is, in 
which only formulas containing bounded quantifiers are admitted.  
The relationship between (intuitionistic) Zermelo-Fraenkel set theory IZF and 
elementary topos theory has also been the focus of a number of investigations. In 
Grayson (1975), (1978), (1979), the Ω-valued universe of sets V(Ω) —equivalent to the 
topos of canonical sheaves on Ω—was introduced, shown to be a model of IZF, and 
used to establish various independence results. In Fourman (1980) , it was shown how 
the construction of the usual cumulative hierarchy of sets generated by a collection of 
atoms can be carried out within a locally small complete topos E (in particular, any 
Grothendieck topos). This leads to a topos E*—in a certain sense a well-founded part of 
E—which is a model of IZF with atoms. By starting with suitable Grothendieck toposes 
E, the associated well-founded toposes E* were shown to be the topos-theoretic 
counterparts of the various models—permutation, Boolean-valued and symmetric—
used for set-theoretic independence proofs. In Freyd (1980) a novel proof of the 
independence of the (countable) axiom of choice (AC) from (classical) ZF is presented, 
pivoting on the construction of a Boolean well-founded topos E (i.e. such that E = E*) 
containing a sequence of nonempty objects B1, B2, … with empty product. Stimulated 
by Freyd’s work, Blass and Scedrov (1989) forged a general correspondence between 
Boolean-valued models of set theory and Boolean Grothendieck toposes, explicating the 
relationship between Freyd’s topos-theoretic methods for showing the independence of 
AC and the “classical” methods of Fraenkel and Cohen. By introducing the idea of a 
Grothendieck topos representing a Boolean-valued model of set theory, Blass and 
Scedrov showed (as did also, independently, Robert Solovay), that the Boolean-valued 
model represented by Freyd’s simplest topos-theoretic model of ¬AC was actually a 
proper submodel, hitherto unnoticed by set-theorists, of the one that Cohen had 
originally constructed for the independence of AC.  
The relationship between topos theory and IZF was later fully explicated by Joyal 
and Moerdijk (1991), and especially their (1995). Their objective was to provide a 
construction of (counterparts to) cumulative hierarchies of sets within a topos—
actually, in somewhat more general categories known as Heyting pre-toposes—which is 
as independent as possible of the external notion of “completeness” of the topos. To this 
end they observed that the universe V(A) of sets built cumulatively from a collection A of 
atoms is a complete sup-lattice under the set-theoretic union operation, where by 
“completeness” is meant that all set-indexed suprema exist. In addition, V(A) is 
equipped with the unary operation sending x to {x}. Joyal and Moerdijk’s key insight 
was that, with this algebraic structure—union and singleton—V(A) is freely generated 
by A: in (1995) such structures are termed Zermelo-Fraenkel algebras. They show how 
to define V(A) when A is an object in a topos E. For this, it was necessary to specify 
what the term “set-indexed” should be taken to mean in the definition of completeness, 
for if all the objects of E were to be regarded as sets, V(A) could not exist as an object of 
E. So E was assumed to be endowed with sufficient additional structure to specify 
exactly which objects are “set-sized” or “small”. Given this, it was shown that various 
free Zermelo-Fraenkel algebras exist in E, not only V(A) itself, but also, for example, 
that corresponding to the class of von Neumann ordinals. Joyal and Moerdijk’s work, 
which unifies all previous constructions of cumulative hierarchies in toposes, may be 
considered a synthesis of intuitionistic set theory and topos theory.  
The 
connection 
between 
elementary 
topos 
theory 
and 
the 
set-theoretic 
independence proofs, in which Cohen’s notion of forcing plays a pivotal role, led Joyal to 
observe in the early 1970s that the various notions of forcing (which in addition 
included those of Robinson and Kripke), could all be conceived as instances of a general 
truth-conditional scheme for sentences in a (sheaf) topos. This concept, which first 
explicitly appeared in print in Osius (1975), came to be known as Kripke-Joyal 
semantics, sheaf semantics or topos semantics. Topos semantics showed, in particular, 

 
6
that the rules for Cohen forcing coincide with the truth conditions for sentences in the 
topos of presheaves over the partially ordered set of forcing conditions, thus explaining 
the somewhat puzzling fact that, while Cohen’s independence proofs employ only 
classical models of set theory, his (original) notion of forcing obeys intuitionistic rules. 
R. Diaconescu (1975) established the important fact, conjectured by Lawvere, that, 
in a topos, the axiom of choice implies that the topos is Boolean. This means that, in 
IZF, the axiom of choice implies the law of excluded middle. This latter formulation of 
Diaconescu’s result was refined by Goodman and Myhill (1978) to show that, in IZF, the 
law of excluded middle follows from the axiom of choice for unordered pairs. (It was 
later realized that the law or excluded middle in fact follows from the mere existence of 
a choice function on the power set of a set with two elements.) In Fourman and Scedrov 
(1982), it was shown, using a topos of presheaves, that in intuitionistic set theory even 
what they termed the “world’s simplest axiom of choice”—the assertion that every 
family, all of whose elements are doubletons and which itself has at most a single 
member—may fail. (By contrast, in Grayson 1975 it is shown that Zorn’s lemma, while 
classically equivalent to the axiom of choice, is consistent with IZF; see also Bell 1997.)  
In Bell (1993), a version of Diaconescu’s theorem was used to show that the law of 
excluded middle is derivable within the intuitionistic version of Hilbert’s ε-calculus. 
 
Of major significance in the development of topos theory was the emergence of the 
concept of classifying topos for a first-order theory, that is, a topos obtained by freely 
adjoining a model of the theory to the topos of  constant sets. The roots of this idea lie 
in the work of the Grothendieck school and in Lawvere’s functorial semantics, but it 
was Joyal and Reyes (see Reyes 1974) who, in 1972, identified a general type of first-
order theory, later called a coherent or geometric theory, which could be shown always 
to possess a classifying topos. This work was later extended by Reyes and Makkai to 
infinitary geometric theories: they showed that any topos is the classifying topos of 
such a theory (see Makkai and Reyes 1977).  In 1973 Lawvere (see Lawvere 1975a) 
pointed out that, in virtue of Joyal and Reyes’s work, a previous theorem of Deligne (see 
Artin et al. 1964, VI 9.0) on coherent toposes—the classifying toposes of (finitary) 
geometric theories—was equivalent to the Gödel-Henkin completeness theorem for 
geometric theories. He also observed that, analogously, the theorem of Barr (1974) on 
the existence of “enough” Boolean toposes was equivalent to a “Boolean-valued” 
completeness theorem for infinitary geometric theories. 
 
The practice of topos theory quickly spawned an associated philosophy—jocularly 
known as “toposophy”— whose chief tenet is the idea that, like a model of set theory, 
any topos may be taken as a taken as an autonomous universe of discourse or “world” 
in which mathematical concepts can be interpreted and constructions performed. 
Accordingly topos theorists sought to “relativize”—i.e., suitably interpret and prove—
within an arbitrary topos results which had originally been proved for the topos of sets. 
One of the most important of these results was the basic theorem of J. Giraud, 
originally presented in Grothendieck’s Paris seminars of the early 1960s, which 
characterized categories of sheaves over a site in terms of exactness and size 
conditions. Giraud himself (1972) had proved a relative version of his theorem for 
Grothendieck toposes, but it was W. Mitchell who first formulated the correct form of 
the theorem for elementary toposes. However, Mitchell was able to prove only a special 
case of the theorem; it was Diaconescu (1975) who succeeded in proving the “relative 
Giraud theorem” in full generality. (Later Zangwill 1980 and Chapman and Rowbottom 
1991 gave purely logical proofs of the theorem within the internal language.) The 
principal tool introduced by Diaconescu—his theorem characterizing geometric 
morphisms (the natural maps between toposes) to categories of internal presheaves in a 
topos—turned out also to be the key to proving the relative versions of the Joyal-Reyes 
results on classifying toposes. The major step in this direction was taken in by G. C. 
Wraith, who, in 1973, constructed the classifying topos for the theory of equality—the 

 
7
object classifier—over an arbitrary topos with a natural number object. The general 
existence theorem for classifying toposes for “internal” geometric theories soon followed: 
this was proved independently by Joyal, Bénabou (1975) and Tierney (1976). Classifying 
toposes for internal algebraic theories were constructed in Johnstone and Wraith 
(1978), and Blass (1989) showed that the existence of an object classifier over a given 
topos implies that the topos has a natural number object. 
 
Much early work in topos theory was devoted to investigating the properties of the 
natural and real numbers within a topos. Freyd (1972), for example,  showed that any 
object X of a topos isomorphic to X + 1 has a natural number object as a subobject. 
Bénabou (1973) associated a finite cardinal number with each natural number in a 
topos and showed that finite cardinals are decidable objects which behave as expected 
with respect to addition, multiplication and exponentiation, and, moreover, that the 
category of finite cardinals in a topos is itself a topos satisfying the axiom of choice, 
hence Boolean. In Coste-Roy et al. (1980) the concept of partial recursive function in a 
topos is defined and a version of Kleene’s normal form theorem formulated and proved. 
Work on the natural numbers and finiteness in a topos also includes Acuna-Ortega and 
Linton (1979), Bell (1999a,b), Grayson (1978), Johnstone and Linton (1978), Kock et al. 
(1975), Stout (1987), and van de Wauw-de Kinder (1975). While the properties of 
systems of natural numbers in toposes proved not to differ greatly from those of their 
classical counterpart (apart from the fact, apparently first pointed out by Sols (1975) 
that, in a topos, the natural numbers cannot be well-ordered without the topos being 
Boolean), a marked divergence emerged in respect of the real numbers. It was found, 
for instance, that in a topos the constructions of the real numbers by means of 
Dedekind sections and Cauchy sequences in the rationals may yield non-isomorphic 
results: the first published account of the situation was provided by Johnstone in his 
1977 book. In Johnstone (1979a) it is shown that, in a topos, the order-completeness of 
the Dedekind reals is equivalent to the truth of the logical law ¬p ∨ ¬¬p. Further study 
of the real numbers, and, more generally, of analysis and topology in topos-theoretic 
contexts was undertaken by Burden (1980), Burden and Mulvey (1979), Fourman 
(1976), Fourman and Hyland (1979), Grayson (1978), (1981), (1982), Hyland (1979), 
Johnstone (1977b), Mulvey (1974), (1980), Rousseau (1977), (1979), Stout (1975), 
(1976), (1978). 
 
The growth of topos theory, and more particularly the study of sheaf toposes, 
stimulated the development of what came to be known, punningly, as “pointless 
topology”. This arose from the observation, originating with Ehresmann (1957) and 
Bénabou (1958) that the essential characteristics of a topological space are carried, not 
by its set of points, but by the complete Heyting algebra of its open sets. Thus complete 
Heyting algebras came to be regarded as “generalized topological spaces” in their own 
right. As “frames” these were studied by C. H. Dowker and D. Papert Strauss 
throughout the 1960s and 70s (see, e.g., their 1966 and  1972. Isbell (1972) observed 
that not the category of frames itself, but rather its opposite—whose objects he termed 
locales—was in fact the appropriate generalization of the category of topological spaces. 
Locales accordingly became known as “pointless” spaces and the study of the 
properties of the category of locales “pointless topology”. It was Joyal who first observed 
that the notion of locale provides the correct concept of topological space within a topos 
(a view later exploited to great effect in Joyal and Tierney 1984) and, more generally, in 
any context where the axiom of choice is not available. This latter observation was 
strikingly confirmed by Johnstone (1981) who showed that Tychonoff’s theorem that the 
product of compact spaces is compact, known to be equivalent to the axiom of choice, 
can, suitably formulated in terms of locales, be proved without it. Johnstone became 
one of the champions of pointless topology, expounding the subject most persuasively 
in his book (1982), and elsewhere (e.g. in 1983a).  

 
8
 
A “logical” approach to pointless topology—formal spaces—was introduced by 
Fourman and Grayson (1982). Here the (constructive) theory of locales was developed in 
a logical framework using the concept of intuitionistic propositional theory. Each such 
theory was shown to engender (the dual of) a locale—its formal space—whose properties 
reflect those of the theory: in particular, semantic completeness of the theory (that is, 
possession of sufficient models for a completeness theorem to hold for it) was shown to 
correspond to the condition that the formal space be a genuine space (that is, possess 
enough points). Under the name formal topology, this approach has been considerably 
refined and developed by G. Sambin and his students and associates within the more 
demanding constructive framework of Martin-Löf type theory (see, e.g. Sambin 1987, 
1988, 1993, 1995, Valentini 1996 and Coquand et al. 2000).  
Two major further developments in topos theory must also be mentioned: the 
construction of topos models of synthetic differential geometry (or smooth infinitesimal 
analysis) and of recursion theory. The first of these originated in Lawvere’s 1967 
lectures, in which he outlined a category-theoretic account of smoothness for maps on 
manifolds and proposed a revival of the use of nilpotent infinitesimals in the calculus 
and differential geometry. The 1967 lectures include the first construction of a 
(Grothendieck) topos containing an “infinitesimal” object ∆ for which the tangent bundle 
of any space S may be identified with the function space S∆—so that, in particular, the 
tangent bundle R × R of the real line R is isomorphic to R∆. In Kock (1977) this latter 
isomorphism is given its explicit form (which led quickly to its becoming known as the 
Kock-Lawvere axiom) and systematically exploited in a development of the differential 
calculus. Dubuc (1979) contains the first construction of so-called well-adapted models 
for synthetic differential geometry, that is, of toposes realizing the Kock-Lawvere axiom 
and into which, in addition, the usual category of manifolds can be “nicely” embedded: 
in view of the fact that in well-adapted models every map between objects is “smooth”, 
such models became known as smooth toposes. Kock (1981) is the first systematic 
presentation both of the axiomatic theory and of the models of synthetic differential 
geometry. Moerdijk and Reyes (1991) contains a full account of the construction of well-
adapted models. Further work of importance in synthetic differential geometry was 
carried out by Bunge (1983a), Bunge and Dubuc (1986), (1987), Bunge and Gago 
(1988), and Bunge and Heggie (1984), Kock (1981b), Kock and Reyes (1979), (1981), 
McLarty (1983), Moerdijk (1987), Moerdijk and Reyes (1984), (1987), Penon (1981).  
In the second of these developments, Hyland (1982), building on suggestions by 
Dana Scott, introduced a topos Eff—the effective or realizability topos—in which truth 
of first-order arithmetic sentences coincides with Kleene realizability and Church’s 
thesis holds in the strong sense that every function from the natural numbers to 
themselves is recursive. Indeed, in Eff all functions between objects constructed from 
the natural numbers, for example the rationals and reals, are recursive, which makes it 
a natural setting for higher order recursion theory: Rosolini (1986) provides an 
axiomatization of a significant part of this theory. Hyland et al. (1980) develop a general 
apparatus for constructing Eff; an alternative method, due to Freyd, is presented in 
McLarty (1992). Realizability interpretations of IZF have been studied in McCarty 
[1984a, b].  
A further strand within the evolution of categorical logic derives from the algebraic 
analysis of deductive systems, which, as has been pointed out, was adumbrated by 
Lambek in the 1950s. In the 1960s Lambek and M. E. Szabo promulgated the view that 
a deductive system is just a graph with additional structure, or equivalently, a category 
with missing equations (see, e.g. Lambek 1968, 1969, Szabo 1978, and Lambek and 
Scott 1986). In his work Lambek also systematically exploited the inverse view that, by 
assimilating its objects to statements or formulas, and its arrows to proofs or 
deductions, a category can be presented “equationally” as a certain kind of deductive 
system with an equivalence relation imposed on proofs.

As touched on above in connection with toposes, categories can also be viewed as 
type theories. From this perspective, the objects of a category are regarded as types (or 
sorts) and the arrows as mappings between the corresponding types. In the 1970s 
Lambek established that, viewed in this way, cartesian closed categories correspond to 
the typed λ-calculus (see Lambek 1972, 1974, 1980 and Lambek and Scott 1986). Seely 
(1984) proved that locally Cartesian closed categories correspond to Martin-Löf, or 
predicative, type theories (see Martin-Löf 1984, Beeson 1985, and the papers collected 
in Sambin and Smith 1998). Lambek and Dana Scott independently observed that C-
monoids, i.e., categories with products and exponentials and a single, nonterminal 
object correspond to the untyped λ-calculus. Scott showed that such monoids can be 
constructed from certain topological spaces, continuous lattices (see Scott 1972, 1973)—
a startling discovery that touched off the development of domain theory—see, e.g. Taylor 
(1999). From the work of Hyland (1988) it may also be inferred that C-monoids exist in 
Eff. The analogy between type theories and categories has since led to what Jacobs 
(1999) terms a “type-theoretic boom”,  with  much  input from, and applications to, 
computer science: see, e.g. Carboni et al. (1988), Crole (1993), Ehrhardt (1988), Hyland 
and Pitts (1989) Obtulowicz and Wiweger (1979), Obtulowicz (1989), Seely (1987), 
Maietti (1998). 
A number of books have appeared on categorical logic, topos theory, and type 
theory. The first of these was Johnstone (1977), a landmark work summing up virtually 
everything that had been done up in topos theory up to that time. Next to appear was 
Goldblatt (1979), which provided an elementary introduction to first-order logic in 
toposes. Lambek and Scott (1986) cover a wide array of topics in the higher order logic 
of Cartesian closed categories and toposes, while Barr and Wells (1986) elected to 
present topos theory entirely from the standpoint of categorical algebra. In Bell (1988) 
topos theory is developed almost exclusively through the internal language. Freyd and 
Scedrov (1990) is a compressed but highly original account of toposes and what they 
term allegories, categories generalizing the category of sets and relations. McLarty 
(1992) is a lucid introduction to topos theory, including descriptions of the effective and 
smooth toposes. Mac Lane and Moerdijk (1992) provide a detailed account of topos 
theory, with the concept of sheaf occupying central stage. The two volumes of 
Johnstone (2002) provide a monumental survey of topos theory. Vickers (1988) 
presents topology from the point of view of categorical logic. Taylor (1998) is a wide-
ranging account of mathematical foundations in which categorical logic plays a major 
role. Barendrecht (1981) has become the standard work on the λ -calculus; categorical 
models of the λ-calculus are developed in Crole (1993). Jacobs (1999) is an exhaustive 
presentation of the categorical logic of type theories. The theory of continuous lattices is 
developed in Gierz et al.(1980). Martin-Löf type theory is presented in Martin-Löf (1984) 
and Nördstrom et al. (1990). Works on synthetic differential geometry include Kock 
(1981a), Moerdijk and Reyes (1991)—both mentioned above—Lavendhomme (1996) and 
an elementary book by Bell (1998).

2. Categories and Deductive Systems 
 
 
The relationship between category theory and logic is most simply illustrated in the 
case of the (intuitionistic) propositional calculus. Accordingly let S be a set of sentences 
in a propositional language L: S gives rise to a category CS specified as follows. The 
objects of CS are the sentences of L, while the arrows of CS are of two types. First, for 
sentences p, q of L we count as an arrow π: p → q any pair <P, p> where P is a proof of q 
from S ∪ {p} in the intuitionistic propositional calculus. And second, for each sentence p 
the pair      <∅, P> is to count as an arrow p → p. Given two arrows π = <P, p>: p → q 
and σ: <Q, q>: q → r the composite σ  π: p → r is defined to be the pair <PÌQ, p> where 
PÌQ is the proof obtained by concatenating P and Q. The identity arrow on p is taken to 
be <∅, p>.  
 
The category CS is called the syntactic category determined by S. Syntactic categories 
have a number of special properties. To begin with, they are Cartesian closed, with 
terminal object given by the identically true proposition , the product of two sentences 
p, q given by the conjunction p ∧ q (with canonical proofs of conjuncts from 
conjunctions as projection arrows), and the implication sentence p ⇒ q playing the role 
of  the exponential object qp. (This last follows from the fact that, for any r, there is a 
natural bijection between proofs of q from S ∪ {r ∧ p} and proofs of p ⇒ q from S ∪ {r}.) 
Moreover, CS has an initial object in the form of the identically false proposition ⊥ and 
coproducts given by disjunctions in the same way as products correspond to 
conjunctions. We may sum all this up in by saying that syntactic categories are 
bicartesian closed.  
 
So a certain kind of deductive system—intuitionistic propositional calculi—can be 
regarded as a category of a special sort. Conversely, it is possible to furnish the concept 
of deductive system with a definition of sufficient generality to enable every category to 
be regarded as a special sort of deductive system. This is done by introducing the 
concept of a graph.  
 
A (directed) graph consists of two classes: a class A whose members are called 
arrows, and a class O whose members are called objects (or vertices), together with two 
mappings from A to O called source and target. For f ∈ A  we write f: A → B to indicate 
that source(f) = A and target(f) = B.  
 
Now a deductive system is a graph in which with each object A there is associated 
an arrow 1A: A → A, called the identity arrow on A, and with each pair of arrows f: A → 
B and g: B → C there is associated an arrow   g f: A → C  called the composite of f and 
g. It is natural for a logician to think of the objects of a deductive system as statements 
and of the arrows as deductions or proofs. In this spirit the arrow compostion operation  
 
f: A → B     g: B → C 
g f: A → C 
 
may be thought of as a rule of inference.  
 
A category may then be defined as a deductive system in which the following 
equations hold among arrows: 
 
(*)         f  1A = f  =  1B  f              (h  g)  f =   h  (g  f)  
 
for all f: A → B, g: B → C, h: C → D. Thus each category is a certain kind of deductive 
system. Conversely, by identifying proofs in such a way as to make equations (*) hold, 
any deductive system engenders a unique category.

3.  Functorial Semantics 
 
 
As observed in §1, Lawvere took the first step in providing the theory of models with a 
categorical formulation by introducing algebraic theories, the categorical counterparts of 
equational theories. Here the key insight was to view the logical operation of 
substitution in equational theories as composition of arrows in a certain sort of 
category. Lawvere showed how models of such theories can be naturally identified as 
functors of a certain kind, so launching the development of what has come to be known 
as functorial semantics.  
 
An algebraic theory T is a category whose objects are the natural numbers and 
which for each m is equipped with an m-tuple of arrows, called projections,  
πi: m → 1   i = 1, …, m 
making m into the m-fold power of 1: m = 1m. (Here 1 is not a terminal object in T.) 
 
In an algebraic theory the arrows m → 1 play the role of m-ary operations. 
Consider, for example, the algebraic theory Rng of commutative rings. Here arrows m → 
n are n-tuples of polynomials in the variables x1, …, xm, with substitution of polynomials 
as composition.  The projection arrow  πi: m → 1 is just xi considered as a polynomial in 
the variables x1, …, xm. Each polynomial in m variables, as an arrow m → 1, may be 
regarded as an m-ary operation in Rng.  
 
In a similar way every equational theory—groups, lattices, Boolean algebras—may 
be assigned an associated algebraic theory. 
 
Now suppose given a category E with finite products. A model of an algebraic 
theory T in E, or a T-algebra in E, is defined to be a finite product preserving functor A: 
T → E. The full subcategory of the functor category ET whose objects are all T-algebras 
is called the category of T-models or T-algebras in E, and is denoted by Alg(T, E).  
 
When T is the algebraic theory associated with an equational theory E, it is not 
hard to see that the category of T-models in Set , the category of sets, is equivalent to 
the category of algebras axiomatized by E, that is, the category of commutative rings.  
 
Lawvere later extended functorial semantics to first-order logic. Here the essential 
insight was that existential and universal quantification can be seen as left and right 
adjoints, respectively, of substitution. 
 
To see how this comes about, consider two sets A and B and a map  f: A → B. The 
power sets PA and PB of A and B are partially ordered sets under inclusion, and so can 
be considered as categories. We have the map f –1 : PB → PA given by: 
 
f –1(Y) = {x: f(x) ∈ Y}, 
 
which, being inclusion-preserving, may be regarded as a functor between the categories 
PB and PA. Now define the maps ∀f, ∃f : PA → PB by 
 
∀f(X) = {y: ∀x(f(x) = y ⇒ x ∈ X}      ∃f (X) = {y: ∃x(x ∈ X ∧ f(x) = y}. 
 
These maps ∃f and ∀f, which correspond to the existential and universal quantifiers, are 
easily checked to be respectively left and right adjoint to  f –1. Finally, think of the 
members of PA and PB as corresponding to attributes of the members of A and B (under 
which the attribute corresponding to a subset is just that of belonging to it), so that 
inclusion corresponds to entailment. Then, for any attribute Y on B, the definition of      
f –1(Y) amounts to saying that, for any x ∈ A, x has the attribute f –1(Y) just when f(x) has 
the attribute Y. That is to say, the attribute f –1(Y) is obtained from Y by “substitution” 
along f. This is the sense in which quantification is adjoint to substitution.  

 
12
 
Lawvere’s concept of elementary existential doctrine (which we shall abbreviate to 
“elexdoc”) presents this analysis of the existential quantifier in a categorical setting. 
Accordingly an elexdoc is given by the following data: a category T with finite products—
here the objects of T are to be thought of as types and the arrows of T as terms—and for 
each object A of T a category A(A) called the category of attributes of A. For each arrow   
f: A → B  we are also given a functor A(f): A(B)  → A(A), to be thought of as substitution 
along f, which is stipulated to possess a left adjoint ∃f —existential quantification along 
f. 
 
The category Set provides an example of an elexdoc: here for each set A, the category 
of attributes A(A) is just PA and for  f: A →B, A(f) is f –1. This elexdoc is Boolean in the 
sense that each category of attributes is a Boolean algebra and each substitution along 
maps a Boolean homomorphism. 
 
Functorial semantics for elexdocs is most simply illustrated in the Boolean case. 
Thus a (set-valued) model of a Boolean elexdoc (T, A) is defined to be a product 
preserving functor M: T → Set together with, for each object A of T, a Boolean 
homomorphism A(A) → P(MA) satisfying certain natural compatibility conditions. 
 
This concept of model can be related to the usual notion of model for a first-order 
theory T in the following way. First one introduces the so-called “Lindenbaum” doctrine 
of T: this is the elexdoc (T, A) where T is the algebraic theory whose arrows are just 
projections among the various powers of 1 and in which A(n) is the Boolean algebra of 
equivalence classes modulo provable equivalence from T of formulas having free 
variables among x1, …, xn. For f : m → n, the action of A(f) corresponds to syntactic 
substitution, and in fact ∃f can be defined in terms of the syntactic ∃. It is not difficult 
to see that each model of T in the usual sense gives rise to a model of the 
corresponding elexdoc (T, A).

4. Cartesian Closed Categories and the Typed λ-Calculus 
 
 
As we have seen, when a category is considered as a deductive system, its objects are 
assimilated to statements or formulas, and its arrows to proofs or deductions. But, as 
remarked in §1, categories can also be viewed in another light, namely, as type theories. 
Here the objects of a category are to be regarded as types (or sorts) and the arrows as 
mappings between the corresponding types. In this spirit Lambek has shown that the 
typed λ-calculus corresponds to a cartesian closed category. Here we give a brief sketch 
of how this correspondence is established. 
 
A typed λ-calculus2 is a theory formulated within a certain kind of formal language 
which we shall call a λ-language. A language Λ of this kind is equipped with the 
following basic symbols: 
 
 
• 
a type symbol 1 
• 
ground types A, B, C, … (possibly none of these) 
• 
function symbols f, g, h, … (possibly none of these) 
• 
variables xA, yA, zA, … of each type A, where a type is as defined below 
• 
unique entity Ì of type 1. 
 
The types of Λ are defined recursively as follows: 
 
• 
1 and each ground type are types 
• 
A1 × ... × An is a type whenever A1, ...,  An are, where, if n = 1,     A1 × ... × An is 
A1, while if n = 0, A1 × ... × An is 1 (product types) 
• 
BA is a type whenever A, B are. 
Each function symbol f is assigned a signature of the form A → B, where A, B are 
types. We normally write f: A → B to indicate this. 
 
Terms of Λ and their associated types are defined recursively as follows. We write   
τ: A  to indicate that the term τ has type A. 
 
                 Term : type                                                    Proviso 
               Ì: 1 
 
                         xA: A (we shall usually omit 
                                      the subscript 
 
                      f(τ): B                                 
f: A → B      τ: A 
<τ1, ..., τn>: A1 × ... × An, where <τ1,...,τn> 
is τ1 if n = 1, and Ì if n = 0 
τ1: A1, ..., τn: An 
 
                      (τ)i: Ai  where  (τ)i is τ if n = 1   
τ: A1 × ... × An,  1 ≤ i ≤ n 
                      τ‘σ : B                                  
τ : BA   σ : A 
                             λxτ : BA   
x : A  τ : B 
 
 
We write τ(x/σ) or τ(σ) for the result of substituting σ at each free occurrence of x in τ, 
where an occurrence of x is free if it does not appear within a term of the form λxρ. A 
term σ is substitutable for a variable x in a term τ if variable free in σ becomes bound 
when so substituted.    
                                                            
                                               
2 For simplicity we consider only the typed lambda calculus without iterators. 

 
14
An equation in Λ is an expression of the form σ = τ, where σ and τ are terms of the 
same type. A theory in Λ (or simply a λ-theory) is a set T of equations satisfying the 
following conditions: 
 
• 
σ = σ  ∈ T     σ = τ ∈ T  ⇒  τ = σ ∈ T     
      σ = τ ∈ T  &  τ = υ ∈ T  ⇒  σ = υ ∈ T  
• 
σ = υ ∈ T  ⇒  τ‘σ  =  τ‘υ ∈ T          σ = τ ∈ T  ⇒  λxσ =  λxτ  ∈ T 
• 
T contains all equations of the following forms: 
 
τ = Ì  for τ : 1 
 
 
(<τ1, ..., τn>)i = τi      τ = <(τ)1, ..., (τ)n> 
 
 
(λxτ)‘σ = τ(x/σ) for all σ substitutable for x in τ 
 
 
λx(τ‘x) = τ for all τ : BA, provided x: A is not free in τ. 
 
Now λ-theories comprise the objects of a category λ-Th whose arrows are the so-
called translations between such theories. Let us define a translation K of a λ-language L 
into a λ-language L ′ to be a map which assigns to each type A of L a type KA of L ′ and 
to each function symbol f: A → B  a function symbol of L ′ of signature KA → KB in 
such a way that 
 
K1 = 1, K(A1 × ... ×An) = KA1 × ... × KAn,  K(BA) = KBKA. 
 
Any translation K: L →  L ′ may be extended to the terms of L in the evident recursive 
way—i.e., by defining KxA = xKA, KÌ = Ì, K(f(τ)) =    Kf(Kτ), K(λxτ) = K(λKxKτ)  etc.—so 
that if τ : A, then Kτ : KA. We shall sometimes write  αK for Kα If T, T′ are λ-theories in  
L , L ′ respectively, a translation K: L  → L ′ is a translation of T into T′, and is written   
K: T → T′ if, for any equation σ = τ in T, the equation Kσ = Kτ is in T′.  
 
As we shall see, λ-theories correspond to Cartesian closed categories in such a way 
as to make the category λ-Th  equivalent to the category Cart  of Cartesian closed 
categories. To establish this, we first introduce the notion of an interpretation I of a λ-
language L  in a cartesian closed category C. This is defined to be an assignment  
 
P to each type A, of a C-object AI such that: 
 
 
(A1× ...× An)I   =     (A1)I  × ...× (An)I, 
 
 
(BA)I   =  BIAI 
 
 
1I = 1, the terminal object of C, 
 
P to each function symbol f: A → B, a C-arrow  fI: AI → BI. 
 
We shall sometimes write AC or just A for AI.  
 
We extend I to terms of L as follows. If τ : B, write x for (x1, ..., xn), any sequence of 
variables containing all variables of τ (and call such sequences adequate for τ. Define 
the C-arrow  
aτbx: A1 ×...× An → B 
recursively as follows:

Here ^ denotes exponential transpose and ev the appropriate evaluation arrow in the 
definition of the exponential. 
 
Next, one shows that any λ-theory T determines a Cartesian closed category C(T). 
The objects of C(T) are taken to be the types of the language of T. The arrows of C(T) are 
pairs of the form (x, τ), where τ is a term with no free variables other than x, two such 
pairs  (x, τ) and  (y, σ) being identified whenever the equation τ = σ is a member of T. 
The identity arrow on a type A is the pair (xA, xA). The composite of  (x, τ): A → B and (y, 
σ): B → C is given by the pair (x, σ(y/τ)). It is now readily checked that C(T) is a 
Cartesian closed category with terminal object the type 1 and in which products and 
exponentials are given by the analogous operations on types. Moreover, 
 
1A = (xA,Ì) 
πi = (z, (z)i )  (with z: A1× . . × An) 
<(z, σ), (z, τ)> = (z, <σ, τ>) 
(z, τ)^ = (x, λyτ(<x, y>) with z: A × B, x: A, y: B 
evC,A = (y, (y)2‘(y)1)  with y: CA × A. 
 
There is a canonical interpretation of L in C(T)—which we denote by the same 
expression C(T)—given by 
 
AC(T)  = A      fC(T)  = (x, f(x)). 
 
A straightforward induction shows that, for any term τ with free variables x = (x1, ..., xn) 
of types A1, ..., An, we have 
 
aτbx = (z, τ) 
 
where z is a variable of type A1× ... ×  An. 
 
Inversely, each Cartesian closed category E determines a λ-theory Th(E) in the 
following way. First, one defines the internal language LE  of E: the ground type symbols 
of LE are taken to match the objects of E are taken to match the objects of E other than 
1, that is, for each E-object A other than 1 we assume given a ground type A. Next, we 
with each type symbol A of LE we associate the E-object AE defined by 
 
AE = A  for ground types A,  (A × B)E = AE × BE,   (BA)E = BE
AE. 
 
As function symbols in LE we take triples of the form (f, A, B) = f with f: AE  → BE in E. 
The signature of f is A → B.  
 
The natural interpretation—denoted by E—of LE in E is determined by the 
assignments 
 
AE = A  for ground types A, (f, A, B) = f. 
 
The λ-theory Th(E) of E is now defined in the following way. Given a pair of terms σ, τ of 
the same type in LE write x for the sequence of variables occurring free in either σ or τ. 

 
16
The theory Th(E) consists of all equations σ = τ for which the arrows (aσbx)E and (aτbx)E 
coincide.  
 
It can then be shown that the canonical functor F: E → C(Th(E)) defined by  
FA = A  for each E-object A 
Ff = (x, f(x)) for each E-arrow f: A → B 
 
is an isomorphism of categories.  
Similarly, for each λ-theory T there is a canonical translation G: T  → Th(C(T)) given 
by  
 
GA = A  for each type A 
Gf = ((x, f(x), A, B) for f: A → B. 
 
This translation is clearly an isomorphism in the category λ-Th.. Now let Cart  the category 
whose objects are cartesian closed categories and whose arrows are functors between 
these preserving terminal objects, products, and exponentials. The mappings C  and Th 
act as functors  λ-Th  → Cart and Cart  → λ-Th  respectively; in view of the fact that, for any 
objects E of Cart, T of λ-Th , C (Th(E)) ≅ E and Th(C (T)) ≅ T, these functors are equivalences. 
Accordingly   λ-Th   and   Cart   are  equivalent  categories.  This is one exact sense in 
which a  
formal theory is completely representable in categorical terms.

5. Local Set Theories /Intuitionistic Type Theories 
 
 
In the previous section we have described the categorical counterparts to equational 
and first-order logic. It is natural now to ask: what sort of category corresponds to 
higher-order logic? As remarked in §1, the answer to this question—an elementary 
topos— was provided in 1969 by Lawvere and Tierney. It was soon realized that the 
system of higher-order logic associated with a topos is most conveniently formulated as 
a generalization of classical set theory within intuitionistic logic: intuitionistic type 
theory. The system to be described here, local set theory, is a modification, due to  
Zangwill (1977), of that of Joyal and Boileau, later published as their (1981). 
The category of sets is a prime example of a topos, and the fact that it is a topos is 
a consequence of the axioms of classical set theory. Similarly, in a local set theory the 
construction of a corresponding “category of sets” can also be carried out and shown to 
be a topos. In fact any topos is obtainable (up to equivalence of categories) as the 
category of sets within some local set theory. Toposes are also, in a natural sense, the 
models or interpretations of local set theories. Introducing the concept of validity of an 
assertion of a local set theory under an interpretation, such interpretations are sound 
in the sense that any theorem of a local set theory is valid under every interpretation 
validating its axioms and complete in the sense that, conversely, any assertion of a local 
set theory valid under every interpretation validating its axioms is itself a theorem. The 
basic axioms and rules of local set theories are formulated in such a way as to yield as 
theorems precisely those of higher-order intuitionistic logic. These basic theorems 
accordingly coincide with those statements that are valid under every interpretation.  
In a local set theory the set concept, as a primitive, is replaced by that of type. A 
type in this sense may be thought of as a natural kind or species from which sets are 
extracted as subspecies. The resulting set theory is local in the sense that, for example, 
the inclusion relation will obtain only among sets which have the same type, i.e. are 
subspecies of the same species. 
A local set theory, then, is a type-theoretic system built on the same primitive 
symbols =, ∈, {:} as classical set theory, in which the set-theoretic operations of forming 
products and powers of types can be performed, and which in addition contains a 
“truth value” type acting as the range of values of “propositional functions” on types. A 
local set theory is determined by specifying a collection of axioms formulated within a 
local language defined as follows. 
 
5.1 Local languages and local set theories     
 
A local language L has the following basic symbols: 
• 
1 (unity type)   Ω (truth value type)  
• 
S, T, U,... (ground types: possibly none of these) 
• 
f, g, h,... (function symbols: possibly none of these) 
• 
xA, yA, zA, ... (variables of each type A, where a type is as defined below) 
• 
(unique entity of type 1) 
 
The types of L are defined recursively as follows: 
•  1, Ω are types 
•  any ground type is a type 
•  A1 × ... × An is a type whenever A1, ...,  An are, where, if n = 1,      
     
          A1 × .. ×  An is A1, while if n = 0, A1 × .. ×  An is 1 (product types) 
• 
PA is a type whenever A is (power types) 
 

 
18
Each function symbol f is assigned a signature of the form A → B, where A, B are 
types; this is indicated by writing  f: A → B. 
Terms of L and their associated types are defined recursively as follows. We write    
τ: A  to indicate that the term τ has type A.

These axioms and rules of inference yield a system of natural deduction in L. If S is 
any collection of sequents in L, we say that the sequent Γ : α is deducible from S, and 
write Γ AS α provided there is a deduction of Γ : α  using the basic axioms, the sequents 
in S, and the rules of inference. We shall also write  Γ AS α  for Γ A∅ α and  AS α   for     
∅ AS α. 
 
A local set theory in L is a collection S of sequents closed under deducibility 
from S. Any collection of sequents S generates the local set theory S* comprising all the 
sequents deducible from S. The local set theory in L generated by ∅ is called pure local 
set theory in L.  
 
5.2. Logic in a local set theory. 
 
 
The logical operations in L are defined as follows: 
 
 
                   Logical Operation                                             Definition 
 (true) 
Ì = Ì 
α ∧ β 
<α, β> = <, > 
α → β 
(α ∧ β) ↔ α 
⊥ (false) 
∀ω. ω 
 
¬α 
 
α → ⊥ 
α ∨ β 
∀ω[(α → ω ∧ β → ω) → ω] 
∃x α 
∀ω[∀x(α → ω) → ω] 
 
We also write x ≠ y for ¬(x = y), x ∉ y for ¬(x  ∈ y), and ∃!x α for ∃x[α ∧ ∀y α(x/y) →        
x = y].                                  
 
 
 
It can now be shown that the logical operations on formulas just defined satisfy the 
axioms and rules of free intuitionistic logic. (For this reason local set theories are also 
known as intuitionistic type theories.) We present just a few of the relevant derivations. 
 
We write

In any local set theory the following Modified Cut Rule holds: 
 
(i)                     Γ: α      α, Γ : β 
             ∃x1(x1 = x1), ..., ∃xn(xn = xn),  Γ: β 
 
where x1, ..., xn  are the free variables of α not occurring freely in Γ or β. 
 
 
 

 
21
 
 
(ii)                             Γ: α       α, Γ : β               
Γ : β             provided that, whenever A is the 
type of a free variable of α with no free occurrences in Γ orβ, there is a 
closed3 term of type A. 
                                               
 
5.3. Set theory in a local language 
 
We can now introduce the concept of set in a local language. A set-like term is a 
term of power type; a closed set-like term is called an  (L -) set. We shall use upper case 
italic letters X, Y, Z, ... for sets, as well as standard abbreviations such as ∀x ∈X.α for    
∀x(x ∈ X → α). The set theoretic operations and relations are defined as follows. Note 
that in the definitions of ⊆, ∩, and ∪, X and Y must be of the same type:  
 
                        Operation                                                      Definition

{u: u ⊆ X × Y ∧ ∀x∈X ∃!y∈Y. <x,y> ∈ u} 
 
 
                       
 
The standard facts concerning the set-theoretic operations and relations now follow 
as straightforward consequences of their definitions. 
 
Given a term τ such that 
<x1, ..., xn> ∈ X AS  τ ∈ Y 
we write (<x1, ..., xn> 6 τ) or simply x 6 τ for  
{<<x1, ..., xn>, τ: <x1, ..., xn> ∈ X}. 
Clearly we have 
                                               
3 A term is closed if it contains no free variables. 

 
22
AS  (<x1, ..., xn> 6 τ)) ∈ Fun(X, Y), 
and so we may think of  (<x1, ..., xn>6 τ) as the function from X to Y determined by τ. 
We now show that each local set theory determines a topos. Let S  be a local set 
theory in a local language L. Define the relation  ≈S  on the collection of all L -sets by 
X ≈S Y   iff  AS X = Y. 
This is an equivalence relation. An S-set is an equivalence class [X]S —which we 
normally identify with X—of L -sets under the relation ≈S. An S-map f: X → Y is a triple 
(f, X, Y)—normally identified with f—of S-sets such that AS f ∈ YX. X  and Y are, 
respectively, the domain dom(f) and the codomain cod(f) of f. It is now readily shown 
that the collection of all S-sets and maps forms a category C(S), the category of S-sets, in 
which the composite of two maps  f: X → Y  and g: Y → Z is given by 
g  f  = {<x, z>: ∃y(<x, y> ∈  f  ∧  <y, z> ∈ g)}. 
In fact, C(S) is a topos, the topos of sets determined by S.  It has terminal object U1, the 
product of two objects (S-sets) X, Y is the S-set X × Y , with projections given by  
π1 = (<x, y> 6 x): X × Y → X,        π2 = (<x, y> 6 x): X × Y → Y, 
its truth-value object is (Ω, t), where t: 1 → Ω is the S-map {<Ì, >}, and the power 
object of an object X is (PX, eX), where eX: X × PX → Ω is the S-map <x, z> 6 x ∈ z. All 
this is proved in much the same way as for classical set theory. 
 
5.4. Interpreting a local language in a topos. The soundness and 
completeness theorems 
 
Let L be a local language and E a topos. An interpretation I of L in E is an 
assignment: 
 
 
P to each type A, of an E-object AI such that: 
 
 
(A1 × ...× An)I   =     (A1)I × ...× (An)I, 
 
 
(PA)I   =  PAI, 
 
 
1I = 1, the terminal object of E, 
 
 
ΩI = Ω, the truth-value object of E. 
 
 
P to each function symbol f: A → B, an E-arrow  fI: AI → BI. 
 
We shall sometimes write AE or just A for AI.  
 
We extend I to terms of L as follows. If τ : B, write x for (x1, ..., xn), any sequence of 
variables containing all variables of τ (and call such sequences adequate for τ). Define 
the E-arrow

where in this last clause u differs from x1, ..., xn, is free for y in α, y is of type C, (so that

In set theory, lf (a1, ..., an) = {y ∈ C: α (y, a1, ..., an)}, so we take a{y: α}bx to be lf . 
Finally, 
aσ = τbx = eqC   a<σ, τ>bx      (with σ,  τ : C) 
aσ ∈ τbx  = eC   a<σ, τ>bx      (with σ : C, τ : PC and where eC is as defined for 
power objects.) 
If τ : B is closed, then x may be taken to be the empty sequence ∅. In this case 
we write aτb for aτb∅; this is an arrow 1 → B.

Given a formula α, let x = (x1, ..., xn) list all the free variables in Γ ∪ {α}; write 
 
Γ BI α for aΓbI, x  ≤  aαbI, x.   
 
Γ BI α is read : “Γ : α is valid under the interpretation I in E.” If S is a local set theory, we 
say that I is a model of S if every meer of S is valid under I. Notice that  
 
BI β   iff   aβb x = T. 
 
So if I is an interpretation in a degenerate topos, i.e., a topos possessing just one object 
up to isomorphism, then  BI α for all α.  
 
We write: 
 
 
Γ B α 
for      Γ BI α for every I 
 
Γ BS α    for      Γ BI α for every model I  of S. 
 
It can be shown (laboriously) that the basic axioms and rules of inference of any local 
set theory are valid under every interpretation. This yields the  
 
Soundness Theorem. 
 
Γ A α    ⇒    Γ B α        Γ AS α    ⇒    Γ BS α.    

 
24
 
A local set theory S is said to be consistent if it is not the case that  AS ⊥. The 
soundness theorem yields the 
 
 
 
Corollary. Any pure local set theory is consistent. 
 
Proof. Set up an interpretation I of L in the topos Finset of finite sets as follows: 1I = 
1, ΩI = {0, 1} = 2, for any ground type A, AI  is any nonempty finite set. Extend I to 
arbitrary types in the obvious way. Finally fI : AI  → BI  is to be any map from AI  to BI.  
 
If A ⊥, then A α, so BI α for any formula α. In particular BI u = v , where u, v are 
variables of type P1. Hence  
aubI, uv   = avbI, uv , that is, the two projections P1 × P1 → P1 
would have to be identical, a contradiction.  
 
 
Given a local set theory S in a language L, define the canonical interpretation C(S) of 
L in C(S) by: 
AC(S) = UA      fC(S) = (x 6f(x)): UA → UB      for f: A → B 
A straightforward induction establishes 
aτbC(S), x  = (x 6 τ)  
  
This yields  
(*)                                       Γ BC(S) α  ⇔  Γ AS  α. 
For:  
 
 
           BC(S) α     ⇔     aαbC(S) x  = T 
                                       ⇔   (x 6 α) = (x 6 ) 
                                       ⇔    AS  α =  
                                       ⇔    AS  α. 
Since  Γ AS  α ⇔  AS  γ → α, where γ is the conjunction of all the formulas in Γ, the 
special case yields the general one. 
 
Equivalence (*) may be read as asserting that C(S) is a canonical model of S. This 
fact yields the 
 
 
Completeness Theorem. 
  
 
Γ B α   ⇒  Γ A α        Γ BS α     ⇒     Γ AS α      
 
Proof. We know that C(S) is a model of S. Therefore, using (*),  
 
Γ BS α   ⇒  Γ AC(S) α   ⇒   Γ AS α .     
 
 
5.5. Every topos is linguistic: the equivalence theorem 
 
A topos of the form C(S) is called a linguistic topos. It can be shown that every topos 
is, in a certain sense, equivalent to a linguistic one. This fact was apparently 
established independently by a number of mathematicians: it appears for example, in 
Volger (1975), Fourman (1977), Zangwill (1977), and Boileau and Joyal (1981). 
Given a topos E, we exhibit a theory Th(E) and an equivalence  E   C(Th(E)).  
 
The local language LE associated with E—also called the internal language of E—is 
defined as follows. The ground type symbols of LE are taken to match the objects of E 

 
25
other than its terminal and truth-value objects, that is, for each E-object A (other than 
1, Ω) we assume given a ground type A in LE. Next, we define for each type symbol A an 
E-object AE by 
 
 
AE = A    for ground types A, 
 
(A × B)E =  AE × BE 
4 
 
(PA)E = P(A)E. 
 
The function symbols of L are triples (f, A, B) = f  with   f: AE → BE in E. The 
signature of f is A → B.5 
 
The natural interpretation—denoted by E—of LE in E is determined by the 
assignments 
 
AE = A  for each ground type A            (f, A, B)E = f. 
 
The local set theory Th(E), the theory of E, is the theory in LE generated by the 
collection of all sequents Γ : α such that Γ BE α under the natural interpretation of LE in 
E. Then we have 
Γ ATh(E) α  ⇔  Γ BE α. 
For if Γ ATh(E) α  then by Soundness Γ BTh(E) α , i.e., Γ : α is valid in every model of Th(E). 
But by definition E is a model of Th(E). 
 
 
It can be shown that the canonical functor F: E → C(Th(E)) defined by  
 
FA = UA   for each E-object A 
 
Ff =  (x 6 f(x): UA  → UB   for  each E-arrow f: A → B 
 
is an equivalence of categories. This is the Equivalence Theorem.  
 
 
Finally, we state two more facts about Th(E). 
  
A local set theory S in a language L is said to be 
 
• 
well-termed if whenever AS ∃!xα, there is a term τ of L whose free variables 
are those of α with x deleted such that  AS  α(x/τ); 
• 
well-typed if for any S-set X there is a type symbol A of L such that       
UA  ≅ X in C(S). 
 
Then, for any topos E, Th(E) is well-termed and well-typed. 
 
5.6. Translations of local set theories. 
 
A translation K: L → L ′ of a local language L  into a local language L ′ is a map 
which assigns to each type A of L a type KA of L ′ and to each function symbol             
f: A → B  of L  a function symbol Kf: KA → KB of L ′ in such a way that 
                                               
4 Note that, if we write C for A × B, then while C is a ground type, A × B is a product type. Nevertheless  CE = 
(A × B)E. 
 
5 Note the following: if f: A × B → D, in e, then, writing C for A × B as in the footnote above, (f, C, D) and        
(f, A × B, D) are both function symbols of LE associated with f. But the former has signature C → D, while the 
latter has the different signature A × B → D. 

 
26
 
K1 = 1,  KΩ = Ω,  K(A1 × ... × An) = KA1 × ... × KAn,  K(PA) = PKA. 
 
Any translation K: L → L ′ may be extended to the terms of L in the evident recursive 
way—i.e., by defining KÌ = Ì, K(f(τ)) = Kf(Kτ), K(σ ∈ τ) = Kσ ∈ Kτ  etc.—so that if          
τ : A, then Kτ : KA. We shall sometimes write  αK for Kα. 
 
If S, S ′ are local set theories in L, L ′ respectively, a translation K: L → L ′is a 
translation of S into S′, and is written K: S → S′ if, for any sequent Γ : α of L,  
 
(*)                       Γ AS α  ⇒   KΓ AS′  Kα, 
where if Γ = {α1, ..., αn}, KΓ = {Kα1, ..., Kαn}. If the reverse implication to (*) also holds, K 
is called a conservative translation of S into S′. If S′ is an extension of S and the identity 
translation of S into S′ is conservative, S′ is called a conservative extension of S. 
 
There is a natural correspondence between models of S in a topos E and 
translations of S into Th(E): in particular the identity translation Th(E) → Th(E) 
corresponds to the natural interpretation of Th(E) in E. 
 
Now let E, E′ be toposes with specified terminal objects, products, projection 
arrows, truth-value objects, power objects and evaluation arrows: a functor F: E → E′ 
which preserves all these is called a logical functor. It is easily seen that the canonical 
functor E → C(Th(E)) is logical. 
 
If K: S → S′ is a translation, then for terms σ, τ of L AS σ = τ  implies  AS′ Kσ = Kτ, so 
that K induces a map CK from the class of S-sets to the class of S′-sets via  
CK([σ]S) = [Kσ]S. 
CK is actually a logical functor C(S) → C(S′). Writing Loc for the category of local set 
theories and translations, and Top for the category of toposes and logical functors, C is 
a functor Loc → Top. And inversely any logical functor F: E → E′ induces a translation 
Th(F): Th(E) → Th(E′) in the natural way, so yielding a functor Th: Loc → Top. C and Th 
are “almost” inverse, making Loc and Top “almost” equivalent.  
 
Given a local set theory S in a language L, define a translation K: L → LC(S) by 
 
KA = UA,     Kf = (f, A, B)  if f: A → B. 
 
An easy induction on the formation of terms shows that, for any term τ of L, aτbC(S), x =    
aKτbC(S), Kx. It follows from this that K is a conservative translation of S into Th(C(S)). For  
 
Γ AS α  ⇔  Γ B C(S) α  ⇔  KΓ B C(S) Kα  ⇔   KΓ A Th(C(S)) Kα. 
 
Accordingly any local set theory can be conservatively embedded in one which is well-
termed and well-typed. 
 
A particularly important instance of translation is the adjunction of indeterminates 
to a local set theory. Let us define a constant of type A in a local language L to be a term 
of the form f(Ì), where f: 1 → A. Write L(c) for the language obtained from L by adding 
a new function symbol c: 1 → A and write c for c(Ì). Given a local set theory S in L, 
and a formula α of L with exactly one free variable x of type A, write S(α) for the theory 

 
27
in L(c) generated by S together with all sequents of the form : β(x/c), where α  AS  β. 
Since clearly AS(α) α(x/c), it follows that  AS(α) ∃xα. Also, an analysis of derivations 
establishes that proofs in S(α) are related to proofs in S by the condition: 
(*)                         Γ(x/c) AS(α) γ(x/c)  ⇔  α, Γ AS  γ. 
for any sequent Γ : γ of L. 
It is not hard to show that: 
AS ∃x α  ⇔  S(α) is a conservative extension of S 
AS ¬∃x α  ⇔  S(α) is inconsistent. 
In S(α), c behaves as an indeterminate of sort α in the sense that it can be 
arbitrarily assigned any value satisfying α. To be precise, the following can be proved: 
Let S* be a local set theory in a local language  L * and let K: S → S*. Then for any 
constant c* of L* of type KA such that  AS* αK(c*), there is a unique translation K*: S(α) → 
S extending K such that K*(c) = c*.  
 
If I is an S-set and α the formula x ∈ I, we write SI for S(α) and call it the theory 
obtained from S by adjoining an indeterminate element of I. It follows from (*) above that, 
for any formula γ of L in which i is free for x, 
AS(I) γ(x/c)  ⇔    AS ∀i∈I  γ(x/i). 
 
If α is the formula x = x with x : A, then S(α) is written S(A) and called the theory 
obtained from S by adjoining an indeterminate of type A. In particular, let S0 be the pure 
local set theory in the local language L0 with no ground types or function symbols. 
Evidently S0 is an initial object in the category Loc: there is a unique translation of L0 
into any given local set theory S. (Similarly, the topos C(S0) is an initial object in the 
category top.) Now consider the theory S0(A), where A is a type symbol of L0: A may be 
considered a type symbol of any local language L. If  d  is a constant of type A in L, and 
S a local set theory in L, there is then a unique translation K: S0(A) → S  mapping c to 
d. So S0(A) may be considered the universal theory of an indeterminate of type A.    
 
 
5.7. Uses of the Equivalence Theorem. 
 
As observed, e.g. in Fourman (1977), it is a consequence of the Equivalence 
Theorem that, in order to establish that all toposes have a property P preserved under 
equivalence of categories, one need only show that any linguistic topos (i.e., of the form 
C(S)) has P, and this is usually a straightforward matter. For example, it is easy to see  
that  ∅1 is  an  initial  object in C(S), so that any topos has an initial object. We write 0 
for ∅1.  
It is not hard  to  see that any linguistic topos has coproducts of each pair of its 
objects: if X and Y are S-sets, the S-set X + Y  as defined above is a coproduct and the 
arrows σ1  and  σ2 are the S-maps x 6 <{x}, ∅> and y 6 <∅, {y}> respectively. We 
conclude that any topos has binary coproducts. 
 
In the same sort of way the Equivalence Theorem can be used to show that any 
topos E possesses the following properties: 
• 
E is balanced, that is, any arrow which is simultaneously epic and monic is an 
isomorphism. 
• 
E has epic-monic factorization, i.e., each arrow f is the composite of an epic and a 
monic: this monic is called the image of f.  
• 
In E, pullbacks of epic arrows are epic. 
Let S be a local set theory. We define the entailment relation on Ω to be the S-set 
 
{
,
:
}
′
′
= < ω ω > ω →ω

 

 
28
Given an S-set X, we define the inclusion relation on PX to be the S-set 
 = X  = {<u, v> ∈ PX × PX: u ⊆ v}. 
It follows from facts concerning →, ∧, ∨ already established that 
AS <Ω,  > is a Heyting algebra with top element  and bottom element ⊥. 
Similarly, 
AS <PX, > is a Heyting algebra with top element X and bottom element ∅. 
 
Let Ω(S) be the collection of sentences (closed formulas) of L, where we identify two 
sentences α, β whenever AS α ↔ β. Define the relation ≤ on Ω(S) by  
α ≤ β  ⇔   AS α →  β.   
Then <Ω (S), ≤ > is a Heyting algebra, called the (external) algebra of truth values of S. 
Its top element is TΩ and its bottom element is the characteristic arrow of  ∅  1.  
 
If X is an S-set, write Pow(X) for the collection of all S-sets U such that AS U ⊆ V and 
define the relation  on Pow(X) by U   V ⇔ AS U  ⊆ V. 
Then (Pow(X),) is a Heyting algebra, called the (external) algebra of subsets of X.  
 
Given a topos E, we can apply all this to the theory Th(E); invoking the fact that 
ATh(E) α ⇔  BE α then gives 
B <Ω,  > and <PA, ⊆A> are Heyting algebras, 
where A is any E-object. These facts are sometimes expressed by saying that Ω and PA 
are internal Heyting algebras in E.  
 
What are the “internal” logical operations on Ω in E? That is, which arrows 
represent ∧, ∨ ¬, →? Working in a linguistic topos and then transferring the result to 
an arbitrary topos via the Equivalence Theorem shows that, in E,

We now turn to the “external” formulation of these ideas. First, for any topos E and 
any E-object A, (Sub(A), ⊆) is a Heyting algebra. For when E is of the form C(S), and A 
an S-set X, we have a natural isomorphism (Pow(X), ) ≅ (Sub(X), ⊆) given by 
U 6 [(x 6 x):U  X] 

 
29
for U ∈ Pow(X). Since we already know that (Pow(X), ) is a Heyting algebra, so is 
(Sub(X), ⊆). Thus the result holds in any linguistic topos, and hence in any topos. 
 
Since Sub(A) ≅E(1, PA), it follows that E(1, PA) (with the induced ordering) is a 
Heyting algebra. And since (E(A,Ω), ≤) ≅ (Sub(A), ⊆), it follows that the former is a 
Heyting algebra as well. Taking A = 1, we see that the ordered set  E(1,Ω) of E-elements 
of Ω is also a Heyting algebra. 
 
Recall that a partially ordered set is complete if every subset has a supremum (join) 
and an infimum (meet). Then for any local set theory S, and any S-set X, 
AS <Ω,  > and <PX, ⊆> are complete. 
For it is not difficult to show that  
 
u ⊆ Ω AS ( ∈ u) is the  -join of u, 
 
u ⊆ Ω AS (∀ω∈u.ω) is the  -meet of u, 
 
v ⊆ X AS ∪v is the ⊆-join of v, 
       v ⊆ X AS ∩v is the ⊆-meet of v. 
 
As a consequence, for any topos E,  
BE <Ω,  > and <PA, ⊆> are complete. 
That is, Ω and PA are internally complete in E. 
 
 
5.8. The natural numbers in local set theories. 
 
 
The development of the properties of the natural numbers in toposes was first 
carried out by Freyd (1972). Much of this development can be simplified by 
presentation within a local set theory. Thus let S be a local set theory in a language L. A 
natural number system in S is a triple (N, s. 0), consisting of a type symbol N, a function 
symbol  s: N → N and a closed term 0 :N, satisfying the following Peano axioms.  
 
(P1)  AS sn ≠ 0 
 
(P2) sm = sn  AS  m = n 
 
(P3) 0 ∈ u, ∀n(n ∈ u → sn ∈ u AS ∀n. n ∈ u 
 
Here m, n are variables of type N, u is a variable of type PN, and we have written sn for 
s(n). (P3) is the axiom of induction. 
 
A local set theory with a natural number system will be called naturalized. 
 
In any naturalized local set theory S, 0 is called the zeroth numeral. For each 
natural number n ≥ 1, the nth numeral n in S is defined recursively by putting               
n = s(n – 1). Numerals are closed terms of type N which may be regarded as formal 
representatives in S of the natural numbers. 
 
It is readily shown that (P3) is equivalent to the following induction scheme: 
 
For any formula α with exactly one free variable of type N, if  AS α(0) and               
α(n) AS α(sn), then AS ∀nα(n). 
 
 
It can also be shown that functions may be defined on N by the usual process of 
simple recursion. In fact we have, for any naturalized local set theory S, the following 
simple recursion principle SRP: 
 

 
30
 
For any S-set X: PA, any closed term a : A, and any S-map g: X → X, there is a 
unique S-map f: N → X such that 
AS f(0) = a ∧ ∀n[f(sn) = g(f(n)]. 
 
 
It follows from this that a natural number system on a local set theory is 
determined uniquely up to isomorphism in the evident sense.  
 
Conversely, it can be shown that SRP yields the Peano axioms, so that they are 
equivalent ways of characterizing a natural number system.  
 
Given a naturalized local set theory S, if we denote the map  n 6 s(n): N → N by s 
and the map Ì 6 0: 1 → N by o, it is easy to see, using P! and P2, that the map      
1
s
N
N
+ο
+
→
 is an isomorphism in C(S). Conversely, it can be shown that the 
presence of an S-set X with an isomorphism f: X + 1 ≅X yields a natural number 
system: this was first established, in a topos-theoretic setting, in Freyd (1972). For if we 
define 
U = ∩{u ⊆ X: fÌ ∈ u ∧ ∀x∈u.f(x) ∈ u}, 
it is straightforward to show that the triple (U, f, fÌ) is a natural number system. 
 
An important feature of a natural number system (N, s, 0) is that  the equality 
relation on N is decidable, that is, 
AS m = n ∨ m ≠ n. 
 
As shown in Bell (1999a) and (1999b), Frege’s construction of the natural numbers 
can also be carried out in a local set theory and the result shown to be equivalent to the 
satisfaction of the Peano axioms. Thus suppose given a local set theory S. We shall 
work entirely within S, so that all the assertions we make will be understood as being 
demonstrable in S. In particular, by “set”, “family”, etc. we shall mean “S-set”, “S-
family”, etc. 
A family F of subsets of a set E is inductive if  ∅ ∈ F and F is closed under unions 
with disjoint singletons, that is, if 
∀X∈ F ∀x ∈ E – X (X ∪ {x}∈ F). 
A Frege structure is a pair (E,ν) with ν a map to E whose domain is an inductive family of 
subsets of E such that, for all X, Y ∈ dom(ν), 
ν (X) = ν(Y) ⇔ X ≈ Y, 
where we have written X ≈ Y for there is a bijection between X and Y. 
It can be shown that, for any Frege structure (E, ν), there is a subset N of E which 
is the domain of a natural number system. In fact, for  X ∈ dom(ν) write X+ for X ∪ {ν 
(X)} and call a subfamily E of dom(ν) weakly inductive if ∅ ∈ E and X+ ∈ E whenever X ∈ 
E and ν(X) ∉ X. Let ` be the intersection of the collection of all weakly inductive 
families, and define 0 = ν(∅), N = {ν (X):  X ∈ `}, and s:  N → N  by s(ν (X)) = ν(X+) for X ∈ 
`. Then (N, s, 0) is a natural number system. 
Conversely, each natural number system (N, s, 0) yields a Frege structure. For one 
can define the map g: N → PN recursively by 
g(0) = ∅    g(sn) = g(n) ∪ {n}, 
and the map ν by 
ν = {(X, n)∈ PN × N: X ≈ g(n)}. 
The domain of ν is the family of finite subsets of N and ν assigns to each such subset 
the number of its elements. (N, ν) is a Frege structure. 
 
We next describe the interpretation of the concept of natural number system in a 
topos E. Let (N, s, o) be a triple consisting of an E-object N and E-arrows s: N → N,   o: 
1 → N. Let s, o be the function symbols in LE corresponding to s, o respectively and let 

 
31
0  be the closed term o(Ì). The clearly (N, s, 0) satisfies the simple recursion principle 
in Th(E) iff the following condition, known as the Peano-Lawvere axiom, first presented 
in Lawvere (1964) holds:  
 
 
For any diagram 1

                                         X 
g
→X 
 
 
commutes. 
 
A triple (N, s, o) satisfying this condition is called a natural number system, and N a 
natural number object, in E. From previous observations it follows that a topos has a 
natural number object if and only if it contains an infinite object, that is, an object A 
isomorphic to A + 1. 
 
Now let LN be the language with just one ground type symbol N, one function 
symbol s: N → N and one function symbol 0: 1 → N. Write 0 for 0(Ì). Let P be the local 
set theory in LN generated by the sequents 
 
: sn ≠ 0 
sm = sn : m = n 
0 ∈ u, ∀n(n ∈ u → sn ∈ u) : ∀n. n ∈ u 
 
where m, n are variables of type N and u is a variable of type PN. The triple (N, s, 0) is 
then a natural number system in P, so that P is a naturalized local set theory: it is 
called the free naturalized local set theory. 
 
P is particularly important because it is an initial object in the category of 
naturalized local set theories. Given two such theories S, S′, a natural translation of S  
into S ′ is a translation K: S → S′ which preserves N, s and 0. Write Natloc for the 
category of naturalized local set theories and natural translations. It should be clear 
that P is an initial object in Natloc. The associated topos C(P) is called the free topos.  
 
Lambek and Scott (1986) establish a have emphasized, P has some features which 
recommend it from a constructive standpoint: for instance it has the disjunction 
property, namely, for sentences α, β, AP  α ∨ β ⇔ AP  α or  AP  β; and it is witnessed in that 
for any type symbol A and any formula α with at most the variable x : A free, if  AS ∃x α, 
then AS α(x/τ)   for some closed term τ : A. These facts have led them to suggest that P 
is the ideal theory and its model the free topos the ideal universe, for the constructively 
minded mathematician.  
 
Lambek and Scott also show that P has a number of further features, of which the 
most remarkable is the parametrized disjunction property, namely, for any type A of the 
form Ω or PC, and x a variable of type A, if AP  ∀x [α(x) ∨ β(x)], then either AP  ∀x α(x) or 
AP  ∀x β(x)]. This means that, in P, Ω and all power types are indecomposable, that is, 
cannot be partitioned into two nonempty parts. 
 
If to the axioms of P we add the law of excluded middle 
: ∀ω. ω ∨ ¬ω, 

 
32
we get the theory Pc—the free classical naturalized local set theory—which is the 
classical counterpart of P. The associated topos C(Pc) is called the free Boolean topos. It 
would seem natural to regard this topos as the ideal universe for the classically minded 
mathematician; however, the incompleteness of first-order set theory implies that Pc is 
not complete, so that there are more than two “truth values” in C(Pc), an evident 
drawback from the classical standpoint. 
 
 
 
5.9. Beth-Kripke-Joyal Semantics for Local Set Theories 
 
Joyal’s topos semantics, mentioned in §1, admits a natural formulation in local set 
theories. Let S be a local set theory, let α be a formula of the language of S, let u, v, … 
be variables of types A, B, …, let X be an S-set and let f: X → A, g: X → B, …  be S-maps. 
We think of f, g, …, as generalized elements of A, B defined at stage X. Then we write 
X ╟S α[f, g,…] 
and say that X forces α[f, g, …] or the generalized elements f, g,… satisfy α at stage X if 
AS ∀x∈X α(u/fx, v/gx,…) 
where x does not occur in α. 
 
Recalling that SX  denotes the theory obtained from S by adding the indeterminate 
X-element c, we have 
X ╟S α[f, g,…]    ⇔ AS  α(u/fc, v/gc,…). 
This reduces the concept of satisfaction by generalized elements to the more familiar 
concept of satisfaction by elements.  
 
It is readily seen that  
AS α  ⇔ X ╟S α[f, g,…] for all f: X → A, g: X → B, …, 
that is, provability is equivalent to being forced at all stages. Moreover, 
X ╟S α[f]  ⇒ Y ╟S α[g  f]  for all f: Y → X, 
that is, satisfaction at a given stage implies satisfaction at all “previous” stages. 
 
The rules governing the forcing relation, stated below, are collectively known as 
Beth-Kripke-Joyal semantics (for local set theories). 
 
These rules are as follows: given f: X → A, 
• 
X ╟S   always 
• 
X ╟S ⊥  ⇔  X = ∅ 
• 
X ╟S (α ∧ β)[f]  ⇔ X ╟S α[f] & X ╟S β[f] 
• 
X ╟S (α ∨ β)[f]  ⇔  there are S-sets U, V such that U  ∪ V = X and  U ╟S α[f|U], V 
╟S β[f|V], where | denotes restriction in the usual sense. 
• 
X ╟S (α → β)[f]  ⇔  for all g: Y → X, Y ╟S α[f  g] implies Y ╟S β[f  g] 
• 
X ╟S ¬α[f]  ⇔  for all g: Y → X,  Y ╟S α[f  g] implies Y = ∅ 
• 
X ╟S ∀vα[f] ⇔  for all g: Y → X, h: Y → B, we have Y ╟S α[f  g, h] 
• 
X ╟S ∃vα[f] ⇔  there is an epic arrow g: Y → X and an arrow h: Y → B for which 
Y ╟S α[f  g, h]. 
 
The equivalence theorem enables these rules to be interpreted directly in toposes, 
the contexts in which Joyal had originally presented his semantics. Thus, given objects 
X, A, B, … and arrows f: X → A, g: X → B, of a topos E, and a formula α of L E, one 
writes X ╟E α[f, g,…] for X ╟Th(E)  α[f, g,…] and says, as before, that X forces α[f, g, …] or 
the generalized elements f, g,… satisfy α at stage X. The rules for ╟E are similar to those 
for ╟S. For example, the rule for forcing a disjunction becomes 
X ╟E (α ∨ β)[f]  ⇔  there are monic arrows m: U → X, n: V → X such that m + n:        
U  + V → X  is epic and U ╟E α[f  m], V ╟E β[f  n].

5.10.  Syntactic properties of local set theories. 
 
There are many natural syntactical conditions which can be imposed on a local set 
theory: these were first presented in Bell (1988). The corresponding conditions in 
toposes were first subject to systematic investigation in Johnstone (1977).  
Let S be a local set theory in a language L . We make the following 
 
 
Definitions. 
 
• 
S is classical if AS ω ∨ ¬ω. 
• 
S is sententially classical if AS α ∨ ¬α for any sentence α. 
• 
S  is complete if AS α or AS ¬α for any sentence α. 
• 
For each S-set X : PA let ∆ (X) be the set of closed terms τ such that AS τ ∈ X. 
X is standard if for any formula α with at most the variable x : A free the 
following is valid: 
AS α(x/τ)  for all τ in ∆(X) 
AS ∀x∈X α 
                  S is standard if every S-set is so. 
• 
If X : PA is an S-set, an X-singleton is an S-set U  such that  
AS U ⊆ X ∧ ∀x ∈U ∀y ∈U (x = y). 
                 Write Γ(X) for the  set  of  all  X-singletons.  X  is near-standard if 
                 for  any  formula  α  with  at  most  the  variable  x : A  free  the   
                 following is valid: 
AS ∀x∈U α  for all U in Γ(X) 
AS ∀x ∈X α 
                 S is near-standard if every S-set is so. 
• 
S is witnessed if for any type symbol A of L and any formula α with at most 
the variable x : A free the following is valid: 
             AS ∃x α 
                        AS α(x/τ)   for some closed term τ : A. 
• 
S is choice if, for any S-sets X, Y and any formula α with at most the variables 
x, y free the following version of the axiom of choice holds: 
 
 AS ∀x ∈X ∃y ∈ Y α(x, y) 
AS ∀x ∈ X α(x, fx)  for some f: X → Y 
• 
S is internally choice if under the conditions of the previous definition 
 ∀x ∈X ∃y ∈Y α(x, y) AS ∃f ∈Fun(X,Y) ∀x ∈X ∃y ∈Y [α (x, y) ∧ <x, y>∈ f]. 
• 
An S-set X is discrete if  
AS ∀x ∈X ∀y ∈ X. x = y ∨ x ≠ y. 
• 
A complement for an S-set X : PA is an S-set Y : PA such that 
AS X  ∪ Y = A  ∧  X ∩ Y = ∅. 

 
34
              An S-set that has a complement is said to be complemented.  
 
Now for some facts concerning these notions. 
 
 
 
1. Any of the following conditions is equivalent to the classicality of S: 
(i) 
AS Ω = {, ⊥} 
(ii) 
AS ¬¬ω → ω 
(iii) 
any S-set is complemented, 
(iv) 
any S-set is discrete, 
(v) 
Ω is discrete, 
(vi) 
AS 2 = {0, 1} is well-ordered under the usual ordering, 
(vii) 
if S is naturalized, AS N is well-ordered under the usual ordering. 
Proof. (iii) If S is classical, clearly {x: x ∉ X} is a complement for X. Conversely, if 
{} has a complement U, then 
AS ω ∈ U → ¬(ω = ) → ¬ω → ω = ⊥. 
Hence  AS U = {⊥}, whence AS Ω = {} ∪ U  = {, ⊥}. 
         (v)  If Ω is discrete, then AS ω =  ∨ ¬(ω = ), so A S ω ∨ ¬ω. 
  (vi) If S is classical, then 2 is trivially well-ordered under the usual well-
ordering. 
Conversely, 
if 
2 
is 
well-ordered, 
take 
any 
formula 
α, 
and                          
define X = {x ∈ 2: x = 1 ∨ α}. Then X has a least element, a, say. Clearly  AS a = 0 ↔ α, 
so, since  AS a = 0 ∨ a = 1, we get AS  a = 1 ↔ ¬α, and hence  AS α ∨ ¬α.     
  
2. S standard ⇒ S complete and classical. 
 
Proof. Let α be a sentence and suppose that not AS¬α. Let x : 1 and X = {x : α}. 
Then not AS ∀x ∈ X x ≠ x, so, if S is standard, there must be a closed term τ such that AS 
τ ∈ X. It follows that AS α, so S is complete. Since  AS α or AS ¬α, we certainly have                  
AS α ∨ ¬α, for any sentence α, whence AS ∀ω. ω ∨ ¬ω by standardness. So S is classical.  
3.  S standard and consistent ⇒ S witnessed. 
 
Proof. If AS ∃xα, then not AS ¬∃xα, whence not AS ∀x¬α, so that, by standardness, 
not AS ¬α(τ) for some closed term τ. But S is complete by 2, so  AS α(τ) as required.  
4.  For consistent S, S standard ⇔ S classical, witnessed, and complete. 
 
Proof. ⇒ has already been established. For ⇐, suppose not AS ∀x ∈X α(x). Then    
AS ¬∀x ∈X α(x) by completeness, whence AS ∃x ∈X ¬α(x) by classicality, so that             
AS ¬α(x/τ) for some τ ∈ ∆(X) by witnessing. So not  AS α(x/τ) by consistency. 
5. For well-termed S, S standard  ⇔  S  near-standard and complete.  
 
Proof.  Suppose S is standard. Then S is complete by  2. If AS ∀x ∈U α for  all  X-
singletons  U,  then AS ∀x∈{τ} α, whence AS α(x/τ) for all  τ ∈ ∆(X). So AS ∀xα by 
standardness.  
 
Conversely, suppose that S is near-standard, complete, and that AS α(x/τ) for all       
τ ∈ ∆(X). If U is an X-singleton, then by completeness of S either whence AS ∃x. x ∈ U or 
AS ¬∃x. x ∈ U.  In the former case, the well-termedness of S yields a closed term τ such 
that AS U = {τ} so that, since  AS α(x/τ), we have AS ∀x∈U α. If, on the other hand,          

 
35
AS ¬∃x. x ∈ U, then a fortiori AS ∀x∈U α. Accordingly AS ∀x∈U α for any X-singleton U, 
and near-standardness yields AS ∀x∈X α as required. 
 
6. For well-termed S, S choice ⇔S internally choice and  witnessed. 
 
Proof. Suppose S is choice. If AS ∃xα, let u : 1 and  define  β(u, x) ≡ α(x). Then       
AS ∀u∈1∃x∈Xβ(u,x). Now choice yields an S-map f: 1 → X such thatAS ∀u∈1β(u,f(u)) i.e.,    
AS β(Ì,fÌ) or AS α(fÌ). By well-termedness, fÌ may be taken to be a closed term τ, and 
we then have AS α(τ). So S is witnessed. 
 
To derive internal choice from choice, we argue as follows: let  
X* = {x ∈ X: ∃y∈Yα(x, y)}. 
Then AS ∀x∈X*∃y∈Yα(x,y). Accordingly choice yields a map f: X* → Y  such that                
AS ∀x∈X*α(x, fx), i.e. AS ∀x∈X*∃y∈Y[<x, y> ∈ f  ∧ α(x, y)]. Now 
∀x∈X∃y∈Y α(x, y)]  AS X = X*  AS f ∈ Fun(X, Y) 
so 
∀x∈X∃y∈Y α(x, y)] AS ∀x∈X∃y∈Y[<x, y> ∈ f  ∧ α(x, y)]. 
Hence 
∀x ∈X ∃y ∈Y α(x, y) AS ∃f ∈Fun(X,Y) ∀x ∈X ∃y ∈Y [α (x, y) ∧ <x, y>∈ f], 
as required. The converse is easy. 
 
7. If S is well-termed and well-typed, then S is choice ⇔ SX  (= S(X)) is witnessed for 
every S-set X. 
 
Proof. Suppose S is choice and AS(X) ∃yα(y). We may assume that X is of the form 
UA, in which case α is of the form β(x/c, y) with x : A. From AS(X) ∃yβ(x/c, y) we infer           
AS ∀x∃yβ(x/c, y). So using AC and the well-termedness  of  S  we  obtain  a  term  τ(x) 
such that AS ∀xβ(x, τ(x)). Hence AS(X) β(c, τ(c)), i.e., AS(X) α(τ(c)). Therefore SX is witnessed.  
 
Conversely, 
suppose 
SX 
is 
witnessed 
for 
every 
S-set 
X, 
and 
that                             
AS ∀x∈X∃y∈Y α(x, y)].   Then AS(X) ∃y∈Y α(c, y)], so there is a closed LX-term τ such that  
AS(X) τ ∈Y ∧ α(c, τ).  But τ is σ(x/c) for some L-term σ(x). Thus AS(X) σ(c)∈Y ∧ α(c,σ(c)), 
whence AS ∀x∈X [σ(x) ∈Y ∧ α(x, σ)]. Defining f = (x 6σ): X → Y then gives                       
AS ∀x ∈X α(x, fx)] as required. 
8.  Diaconescu’s Theorem. S choice ⇒ S classical. 
This is the version, for local set theories, of Diaconescu’s (1975) result that any topos in 
which the axiom of choice holds is Boolean. 
 
Proof. Step 1. S choice ⇒ SI  choice for any S-set I. 
 
 
Proof of step 1. Suppose that S is choice, and 
 
AS(I)  ∀x ∈X(c) ∃y ∈Y(c) α (x, y, c). 
Then  
AS  ∀x ∈X(i) ∃y ∈Y(i) α (x, y, i). 
Define  
X* = {<x, i>: x ∈ X(i) ∧ i ∈ I},    Y*  =  
( )
i I
Y i
∈∪
. 
β(u, i)  ≡  ∃x ∈X(i)∃i ∈I[u = <x, i> ∧ α(x, y, i) ∧ y ∈ Y(i)]. 

 
36
 
Then 
AS  ∀u ∈X* ∃y ∈Y* β(u, y). 
 
So choice yields f*: X* → Y*  such that 
 
AS  ∀u ∈X* β(u, f*u). 
i.e., 
AS  ∀i ∈I ∀x ∈X(i) α(x, f*(<x ,i>, i) ∧ f*(<x ,i>)∈ Y(i)], 
 
whence 
AS  ∀x ∈X(c) α(x, f*(<x c>, c) ∧ f*(<x ,c>)∈ Y(c)], 
 
Now define f = (x 6 f*(<x, c>)). Then f: X(c) → Y(c) in SI and 
AS(I)  ∀x ∈X(c) α(x, fx, c). 
This completes the proof of step 1. 
 
Step 2. S choice ⇒ S sententially classical. 
 
Proof of step 2.   Define  2  = { 0, 1}  and   let   X = {u ⊆ 2: ∃y.y ∈ u}.  Then  
AS  ∀u ∈X ∃y ∈ 2 . y ∈ u. 
So by choice there is f: X → 2 such that 
AS  ∀u ∈X . fu ∈ u. 
Now let α be any sentence; define 
U = {x ∈ 2: x = 0 ∨ α}, V = {x ∈ 2: x = 1 ∨ α}, 
Then AS U ∈ X ∧ V ∈ X, so, writing a = fU, b = fV, we have 
 AS  [a = 0 ∨ α] ∧ [b = 1 ∨ α], 
whence 
AS  [a = 0 ∧ b = 1] ∨ α, 
so that 
(*)                               AS  a ≠ b ∨ α. 
But  α AS U = V AS a = b, so that  a ≠ b AS  ¬α. It follows from this and (*) that  
AS α ∨ ¬α, 
 as claimed. This establishes step 2. 
 
 
Moral of step 2: if P2 has a choice function, then logic is classical. 
 
Step 3 (obvious). S classical ⇔ SΩ sententially classical. 
 
Finally, to prove Diaconescu’s theorem, we observe that  
 
S choice ⇒ SΩ choice ⇒ SΩ sententially classical ⇒ S classical. 
 
 
In Johnstone (1979a) and (1979b) an investigation was undertaken of the status in 
toposes of the nonconstructive De Morgan law ¬(ω ∧ ω′) → ¬ω ∨ ¬ω′. Among the more 
interesting conditions shown to be equivalent to it are every maximal ideal in a 
commutative ring with identity is prime; and the Dedekind real numbers are conditionally 

 
37
complete in their natural ordering. These results were among the first establishing an 
equivalence, in an intuitionistic context, of a purely logical with a purely mathematical 
assertion.   
 
5.11. Tarski’s and Gödel’s theorems in local set theories.  
 
The type structure of local languages makes them particularly appropriate for the 
stating (and proving) of undefinability and incompleteness theorems. Thus let L be a 
local language containing a type symbol C, which we will call the type of codes of 
formulas: letters u, v will be used as variables of type C and the letter u will denote a 
closed term of type C. We shall also suppose that L contains terms σ(u, v): C, δ(u): C, 
τ(u): Ω, and for each formula α(u), containing at most the free variable u, a closed term 
7α9 : C called the code of α. 
 
Let S be a local set theory in L. We say that 
 
• 
σ is a substitution operator in S if  
      AS  σ (7α9, u) =  7α(u)9     for any formula α(u) and any  closed term u: C. 
• 
δ is a diagonal operator in S if 
AS  δ(7α9) = 7α(7α9)9  for any formula α(u). 
• 
τ is a truth definition for S if 
AS  τ( 7α9) ↔ α      for any sentence α. 
• 
τ is a demonstration predicate for S if 
                                 AS  α  ⇔    AS  τ( 7α9)     for any sentence α. 
• 
τ is a provability predicate for S if it satisfies, for any sentences α, β,    
(a)    AS  α  ⇒    AS  τ( 7α9), 
(b)    τ(7α → β9)  AS  τ(7α9) → τ(7β9),    
                       (c)    τ(7α9)   AS  τ(7τ( 7α9)9). 
 
Note that, if  σ is a substitution operator, then σ(u, u) is a diagonal operator. 
 
We now prove, for local set theories,  
Tarski’s Theorem on the Undefinability of Truth. Let S be a local set theory 
in L  with a diagonal operator (or a substitution operator). Then if S has a truth 
definition, it is inconsistent. 
Proof. Let δ be a diagonal operator in S and τ a truth definition for S. Define β(u) 
to be the formula ¬τ(δ(u)); write u for  7β9. Then  7β(u)9 is  7¬τ(δ(u))9, 
so that  
                               τ(7β(u)9)  is  τ(7¬τ(δ(u))9),                            (*) 
Since δ is a substitution operator, we have 
AS  7β(u)9 =  δ(7β9) = δ(u),  
whence  
AS  τ(7β(u)9)  ↔ τ(δ(u)), 
i.e. by (*), 
                                                AS  τ(7¬τ(δ(u))9)  ↔  τ(δ(u)).                        (**) 
But since τ is a truth definition we have  
     AS  τ(7¬τ(δ(u))9)  ↔  ¬τ(δ(u)). 
This and (**) give 
 AS  ¬τ(δ(u))  ↔  τ(δ(u)), 

 
38
so that S is inconsistent. 
 
In a similar way one can establish, for local set theories,  
Gödel’s First Incompleteness Theorem.  Let S be a local set theory with a 
diagonal operator (or a substitution operator). Then if S is consistent and has a 
demonstration predicate, it is incomplete.  
 
Proof.  If we define the formula β(u) and the term u as in the proof of Tarski’s 
theorem, we find that 
AS  ¬τ(δ(u))  ⇔  AS  τ(δ(u)), 
so that, if S is consistent, τ(δ(u)) is neither provable nor refutable in S, and accordingly 
S is incomplete. 
 
Next, we can prove, for local set theories, the  
 
Fixed Point Lemma. Suppose that S has a diagonal operator. Then any formula 
α(u) has a “fixed point”, i.e., there is a sentence β such that 
AS  β ↔ α(7β9). 
 
Proof.  Let δ be a diagonal operator in S; given α(u) write u = 7α(δ(u))9 and define β 
to be the sentence α(δ(u)), i.e. α(δ(7α(δ(u))9)). The fact that δ is a diagonal operator gives 
AS  δ(7α(δ(u))9) =  α(δ(7α(δ(u))9)) = 7β9 . 
It follows that 
AS β ↔ α(δ(7α(δ(u))9)) ↔ α(7β9), 
as required. 
 
This leads to a version, for local set theories, of a theorem of Löb (1955). 
 
Löb’s Theorem. Suppose that S has both a diagonal operator and a provability 
predicate τ. Then for any sentence α, 
         AS τ(7α9) → α   ⇒   AS α. 
 
Proof. Suppose that 
(1)                                                           AS τ(7α9) → α. 
Applying the Fixed Point Lemma to the formula τ(u) → α yields a sentence β for which 
(2)                                                  AS  β ↔ (τ(7β9) → α), 
whence 
 AS  β → (τ(7β9) → α). 
Since τ is a proof predicate, it follows that 
       AS  τ(7β → (τ(7β9) → α)9). 
For the same reason, we have also 
 τ(7β → (τ(7β9) → α)9) AS  τ(7β9 )→ τ(7τ(7β9) → α)9). 
Accordingly 
AS  τ(7β9 )→ τ(7τ(7β9) → α)9), 
i.e., 
τ(7β9) AS  τ(7τ(7β9) → α)9). 
Again, 
τ(7τ(7β9) → α)9) ) AS  τ(7τ(7β9)) → τ(7α9)), 
so 
τ(7β9 ) AS  τ(7τ7β9)) → τ(7α9). 
But the fact that τ is a proof predicate gives 
τ(7β9 ) AS  τ(7τ(7β9)); 
this and the previous assertion give 
τ(7β9 ) AS  τ(7α9). 
Using (1), we get 

 
39
(3)                                                     τ(7β9 ) AS  α, 
whence 
AS  τ(7β9 ) → α. 
This together with (2) gives 
AS  β, 
so that, since τ is a proof predicate, 
AS  τ(7β9. 
And this together with (3) gives  AS α as claimed. 
This yields finally a version within local set theories of  
Gödel’s Second Incompleteness Theorem. Suppose that S has both a diagonal 
operator and a provability predicate τ. Then if S is consistent, the sentence ¬τ(⊥) 
expressing the consistency of S is not provable in S.  
 
Proof. If  AS ¬τ(7⊥9), then  AS  τ(7⊥9) → ⊥. So it follows from Löb’s theorem that       
AS  ⊥, i.e., S is inconsistent. 
 
5.12.  Characterization of Set

• 
For any I - indexed family {τi: i ∈ I } of closed terms of common type A, there

AS τi = ( )i
τ     for all i ∈ I, 
                 and, for any term σ(x) : A, x : I , if  AS 
( )
i
i
τ = σ   for all i ∈ I, then 
          AS  τ = σ (uniqueness condition). 
We establish: 
       1.  The following is valid for any formula α(x) with x : I : 
AS ( )i
α     for all i ∈ I 
AS ∀x α 
and similarly for more free variables. In particular, I is standard. 
 
Proof.  Assume the premises. Then for any i ∈ I we have AS 
( )i
α  =  and it follows 
from the uniqueness condition that  AS ( )
x
α
= , whence have AS ∀x α .  
 
 
2.  I  is discrete. 
 
Proof.  Given i, j ∈ I, either they are the same, or not. If the same, then AS 

i
j
=

. If 
not, define for k ∈ I the terms τk by τi = 0, τj = 1 = τk for  k ∈ I – {i, j}. There is then a term 
τ such that AS 
l

τ = τ
 for all k ∈ I. It follows that AS ( )i
τ  = 0 ≠ 1 =

Hence AS

. It now follows from 1 that                   
AS ∀x ∈ I  ∀y ∈ I  (x =  y ∨ x ≠ y); in other words, I  is discrete. 
3. If S is full, Ω(S) is complete. 

 
40
Proof. Suppose {αi: i ∈I} ⊆ Ω(S). Then by the universal condition on I  there is a 
formula β(x) with x : I  such that if  AS 
( )
i
i
α = β   for all i ∈ I. We claim that the sentence   
∃xβ(x) is the join of {αi: i ∈I} in Ω(S). First, it is an upper bound, since 
αi  AS ( )i
β   AS ∃xβ(x). 
And it is least, since if γ is a sentence with αi  ≤ γ  for all i ∈ I, then αi  AS γ ∧ αi. 
for all i ∈ I, so that αi  AS αi  = γ ∧ ( )i
β   for all i ∈ I. By uniqueness of β,  AS β(x)= γ ∧ β(x), 
whence AS β(x) → γ ,  AS ∃xβ(x) → γ and ∃xβ(x) ≤ γ. So Ω(S) is complete as claimed. 
 
Note the following: (i) if S is well-termed and well-typed, then C(S) is full iff the I-
indexed sum of 1 exists in C(S) for any (intuitive) set I. Here the I-indexed sum of an 
object X in a category C is an object I ⊗ X together with arrows σi: X → I ⊗ X (i ∈ I) such 
that, for any arrows fi: X → A, there is a unique arrow f: I  ⊗ X → A such that fi = f  σi 
for all  i ∈ I. In Set, I  ⊗ X is the disjoint union of I copies of X, so that, in particular, I ⊗1 
is essentially I itself. 
 (ii)  S is standard iff 1 is a generator in C(S). Here an object A of a category C is 
a generator if, for any pair of distinct C-arrows f, g: X → Y, there is an arrow h: A → X 
such that f  h ≠ g  h. 
Conditions (i) and (ii) are both satisfied by Set.  
 
 
  
We can now prove the 
 
Theorem. The following conditions on a well-termed, well-typed consistent local set 
theory S are equivalent: 
 
(i)  S is full and standard, 
 
(ii)  S is full, complete and choice, 
       (iii)  C(S)  Set. 
 
Proof.  (i) ⇔ (ii) follows from previously proved results, and (iii) ⇒ (i) has been 
discussed above. Now assume (i). Since S is well-termed, for any S-map f: X → Y we can 
write f(τ) for each closed term τ such that  AS τ ∈ X..  
 
We define functors ∆: C(S) → Set,  ^: Set → C(S) which we show establish an 
equivalence.  
 
First, ∆(X) is the set of closed terms τ such that  AS τ ∈ X, where we identify σ, τ if 
that  AS σ = τ. Given f: X → Y, we define ∆(f) to be the map (τ 6f(τ)): ∆(X) →  ∆(Y).  
 
Next, given I  in Set, we define I to be the S-set U I . If   f: I → J, there is a term f(x) : 
lJ  with x : I   such that that  AS l

We now claim that, for any set I and any S-set X,

from which the equivalence of  Set and C(S) follows. 

 
41
For define ηI: I → 
( )I
∆ by ηI(i) = i . Then ηI is a bijection. To see, e.g., that it is onto, 
observe that, if 
( )I
τ ∈∆ and not AS

τ =   for all i ∈ I, then, since S is complete,  AS

onto, observe that AS ∃y ε(y) = τ for all τ ∈ ∆(X) so that AS ∀x∈X∃y (ε(y) = x), yielding 
ontoness. 
 
  
5.13. Toposes of variable sets: presheaves and sheaves. 
 
While the category of sets is the most familiar, and certainly the simplest example 
of a topos, as pointed out in §1, the origins of the topos concept do not lie in set theory, 
but rather in algebraic geometry and topology. The term “topos” was introduced by 
Grothendieck and his school in the early 1960s as a generic name for a category 
satisfying certain conditions originally associated with the category of sheaves on a 
topological space. As remarked in §1, Lawvere came to describe such categories as 
toposes of variable sets. Here are some simple examples.  
 
• Set→: topos of sets varying over two possible states 0 (‘then”), 1 (“now”), with 0 ≤ 1. 
An object X here is a pair of sets X0, X1 together with a “transition” map p: X0 → X1. An 
arrow f: X → Y is a pair of maps f0: X0 → Y0, f1: X1 → Y1 compatible with the transition 
maps in the sense that the diagram                                          
                                                                    p                           
                                                              X0               X1 
 
                                                          f0                                  f1  
                                                         
                                                               Y0               Y1 
                                                                          q 
commutes. 
 
The truth value object Ω in Set→has 3 (rather than 2 ) elements. For if (m, X) is a 
subobject of Y in Set→, then we may take X0 ⊆ Y0, f0  and f1 identity maps, and p to be 
the restriction of q to X0. Then for any y ∈ Y there are three possibilities: (i) q(y) ∈ X1 
and y ∉ X0; (ii) y ∈ X0;  (iii) q(y) ∉ X1. So we take Ω to be the variable set 3 → 2, where 2 
={0, 1} nd 3 = {0, 1, 2} with 0 61, 1 6 1, 2 6 2.  
 
Moree generally, we may consider sets varying over {0, 1, …, n} or ω, or any totally 
ordered assemblage of stages. In each case there is “one more” truth value than stages: 
“truth” = “time” + 1. 
 
Still more generally, we may consider the category SetP of sets varying over a 
partially ordered set P.  As objects this category has functors P → Set, i.e., maps F which 
assigns to each p ∈ P a set F(p) and to each p ≤ q such that p ≤ q a map Fpq: F(p) → F(q) 
such that Fpp is the identity map for each p ∈ P and  Fpr  = Fqr   Fpq   whenever p ≤ q ≤ r: 
An arrow η: F → G in SetP is a natural transformation between F and G, that is, an 
assignment of a map ηp: F(p) → G(p) to each p ∈ P in such a way that, whenever p ≤ q, 

 
42
we have 
q
pq
pq
p
F
G
η
=
η
D
D
. The terminal object 1 in SetP is the functor on P with constant 
value 1 = {0}.  
 
To determine Ω in SetP we define an upper set over p ∈ P to be a subset U of Op  =    
{q ∈ P: p ≤ q} such that q ∈ U, q ≥ q ⇒ r ∈ U. Then  Ω(p) is the set of all upper sets over 
p and Ωpq(U) = U ∩ Oq for p ≤ q, U ∈ Ω(p). The arrow t: 1 → Ω has tp (0) = Op for each p ∈ 
P.  
 
Objects in SetP* where P* is the partially ordered set obtained by reversing the order 
on P, are called presheaves on P. In particular, when P  is the partially ordered set O(X) 
of open sets in a topological space X, objects in SetO(X)* called presheaves on X. So a 
presheaf on X is an assignment to each U ∈ O(X) of a set F(U) and to each pair of open 
sets U, V such that V ⊆ U of a map FUV : F(U) → F(V) such that, whenever W ⊆ U  ⊆ V, 
FUW = FVW  FUV and FUU  is the identity map on F(U). 
If s ∈ F(U), write s|V  for FUV(s)—the restriction of s to V. A presheaf F is a sheaf if 
whenever 
i
i I
U
U
∈
= ∪
and we are given a set  {si: i ∈ I}  such  that si  ∈ F(Ui) for all  i ∈ I and 
si | Ui ∩Uj = sj| Ui ∩Uj for all i, j ∈ I, then there is a unique s ∈ F(U) such that s |Ui = si  for all       
i ∈ I. For example, C(U) = set of continuous real-valued functions on U, and s|V = 
restriction of s to V defines the sheaf of continuous real-valued functions on X. 
 
The full subcategory Shv(X) of SetO(X)* whose objects are the sheaves on X is a topos 
called the topos of sheaves on X. Its truth-value object is the sheaf Ω on X given by Ω(U) 
= {V∈O(X): V ⊆U}, so that in particular Ω(X), its set of global truth values, coincides with 
O(X) itself. 
As a topos, the category of sheaves on a topological space arises from the topos of 
presheaves by confining attention to presheaves satisfying a certain covering condition. 
In the early 1960s Grothendieck extended  the notion of covering to arbitrary 
categories, by so doing conferring a generality on the concept which proved to be of 
immense fertility, a fertility extending even as far as logic. 
Grothendieck’s covering concept—which came to be known as a Grothendieck 
topology—is formulated within an arbitrary category C. First, one defines a sieve on an 
object C of C  to be a collection S of C-arrows closed under composition on the right, 
that is, satisfying f ∈ S ⇒ f  g ∈ S for any arrow g composable with f on the right. Note 
that, if S is a sieve on C and h: D → C is any arrow with codomain C, then the set 
h*(S) = {g: codomain(g) = D & h  g ∈ S} 
is a sieve on D. A Grothendieck topology, or simply a topology, on C is a map J which 
assigns to each object C a collection J (C) of sieves on C in such a way that the following 
conditions (i), (ii), (iii) are satisfied. For any arrow f: D → C, let us say that S covers f if 
f*(S) ∈ J(D). 
(i)  Reflexivity. If S is a sieve on C, and f ∈ S, then S covers f.  
(ii) Stability. If S covers f : D → C, it also covers any composite f  g. 
(iii) Transitivity. If S covers f : D → C, and R is a sieve on C which covers every 
map in S, then R also covers f.  
 
These three conditions are the counterparts, in an arbitrary category, of the natural 
conditions satisfied by covering families in the usual sense in the category of all subsets 
of a set, partially ordered by (reverse) inclusion. In this setting (i) reads: any covering 
family covers each of its members, (ii): the restriction of a covering family to a subset U 
of the set covered by it is a covering family of U, (iii): given a covering family S, and for 
each member U ∈ S a covering family SU, the family comprising the members of all the 
SU is itself a covering family.  

 
43
 
Now the concept of sheaf associated with a Grothendieck topology arises, as does 
the classical concept, from corresponding toposes of presheaves. The presheaf toposes 
in question are generalizations of the toposes of presheaves of  sets varying over a 
partially ordered set; their objects are, in fact, sets varying (contravariantly) over an 
arbitrary category C. Thus one defines a presheaf on C  to be a functor from Cop—the 
“opposite” category of C in which all arrows are “reversed”—to the category of sets. The 
presheaf category C^ has as objects all presheaves on C and as arrows all natural 
transformations between them. This is, as in the previous cases, a topos. There is a 
natural embedding Y—the Yoneda embedding—of C into C ^, whose action on objects is 
defined as follows. For each object C of C, YC is the presheaf on C  which assigns, to 
each object X of C, the set Hom(X, C) of C-arrows from X to C. The presheaf YC is the 
natural representative of C in C, and the two are usually identified.  
 
Grothendieck defined a site to be a pair (C, J) consisting of a category C and a 
topology J thereon. Since any sieve S may be regarded in a natural way as a subfunctor 
or subobject of the object YC, it may also be considered an object of C^. Now suppose 
given a C^-object F of and a C^ - arrow f: S → F. A C^-arrow g: YC → F  is said to be 
an extension of f to YC if its restriction to the subobject F of YC coincides with f. A 
presheaf F is called a (J-) sheaf if, for any object C, and any J-covering sieve S on C, any 
arrow f: S → F has a unique extension to YC. Thus, speaking figuratively, a J-sheaf is a 
presheaf F which “believes”, as it were, that (the canonical representative YC of) any C-
object C is “really covered” by any of its J-covering sieves, in the sense that, in C^, any 
arrow from such a covering sieve to F fully determines an arrow from YC to F.  
 
Grothendieck and his school assigned the term “topos” (in this case, a back-
formation from the word “topology” to its original Greek source “topos”, “place”) to any 
category of sheaves associated with a site. Thus, for any site (C, J), the full subcategory 
ShvJ(C ) was referred to as the topos of sheaves on that site. After Lawvere and Tierney 
had distilled from this the general concept of elementary topos, Grothendieck’s original 
constructs came to be known as Grothendieck toposes (cf. “Abelian” groups).  
 
Lawvere and Tierney showed that a Grothendieck topology can be regarded as an 
arrow on a truth value object. To be precise, a Lawvere-Tierney topology in a topos E is 
an arrow j: Ω → Ω which is such that  (i) j   = , (ii) j  j = j, (iii) j   ∧ = ∧  (j × j), that is, 
preserves , is idempotent, and distributes over conjunctions. It soon came to be 
recognized that a Lawvere-Tierney topology in a topos is essentially the same thing as a 
modal operator in its internal language. Stated in the context of local set theories, a 
modality in a local set theory S is a formula µ with exactly one free variable of type Ω 
satisfying the following conditions: for any formulas α, β, (i)  α AS  µ(α),  (ii) α AS  β  ⇒  
µ(α)AS  µ(β), (iii) µ(µ(α))AS  µ(α). (So µ may be thought of as a possibility operator.)  
Thus Grothendieck topologies ultimately correspond to modalities. What about 
sheaves? It turns out that they correspond to absolutely closed sets.  Given a modality µ 
in a local set theory S, we define the (µ-) closure of an S-set X to be the set {x: µ(x ∈ X)}; a 
set is said to be closed if it coincides with its closure, and separated if each of its 
singletons is closed. It is absolutely closed, or a (µ-)sheaf, if it is separated, and 
whenever it is (isomorphic to) a subset of a separated set, it is always a closed subset. 
Again, it can be shown that sheaves in this sense also give rise to toposes, that is, for 
any modality µ in S, the full subcategory Shµ(S) of C(S) whose objects are all µ-sheaves is 
a topos. Moreover, there is a natural functor L: C(S) → Shµ(S), the associated sheaf 
functor, which assigns to each S -set X a sheaf LX which is the “best approximation” to 
X by a sheaf (to be precise, the functor L is left adjoint to the insertion functor Shµ(S) → 
C(S). These constructions were originally carried out by Lawvere in the topos context, 
before the development of the internal language. Different constructions of L were also 
given by Johnstone (1974) and, within the internal language, by Veit (1981).  

 
44
 
An important special case of a modality which received intense study during the 
early development of topos theory is the so-called double negation modality defined by  
µ(α) = ¬¬α. For any  topos E, the full subcategory E¬¬ of double negation sheaves is 
Boolean—that is, its associated theory is classical. Later it was seen that the true 
reason for this is that the truth of sentences of the internal language in E and in E¬¬  
are related by a “translation” to all intents and purposes identical with Gödel’s 
translation of classical into intuitionistic logic. One of the most important early uses of 
double negation sheaves was in forging links between topos theory and independence 
proofs in set theory. Indeed, if P is a partially ordered set of conditions in the usual 
Cohen sense, then the topos of double negation sheaves in the category P^ of 
presheaves on P turns out to be equivalent to the Scott-Solovay Boolean universe V(B), 
where B is the Boolean completion of P. This observation led Tierney (1972) and others, 
as observed in §1, to analyze some of the independence proofs, notably that of the 
continuum hypothesis, in a topos-theoretic setting.

6. First-Order Model Theory in Local Set Theories and 
Toposes 
 
 
As observed in §1, Joyal and Reyes continued the search initiated by Lawvere for an 
adequate categorical formulation of the model theory of first-order languages. One way 
of doing this, as they came to see, was essentially to retain both the traditional 
presentation of first-order theories, and the concept of model, but to interpret the latter 
in an arbitrary topos, rather than in the usual category of sets. This led them to identify 
a particular class of first-order theories—the so-called geometric theories—whose 
models in toposes have a particularly simple categorical description. They showed that, 
associated with each such theory Σ, there is a topos—the so-called classifying topos of 
Σ—which contains a canonical or generic model of Σ validating exactly those (geometric) 
formulas holding in every model of Σ. (A systematic account of their work was given in 
Makkai and Reyes [1977].) Here we present the essentials of their constructions in 
terms of local set theories. 
 
We begin by introducing the first-order languages appropriate to our purposes. A 
(many-sorted) first-order language L has the following ingredients: 
 
• 
sorts A, B, … 
• 
function symbols f, g, …each of which is assigned a signature   (A→, B) where A→ 
= (A1, …, An) is a finite sequence of sorts and B is a sort. 
• 
predicate symbols α, β, … each of which is assigned a signature A→ 
• 
logical symbols  ∧, ∨, →, ∀, ∃ 
• 
propositional constants  (true), ⊥ (false) 
• 
equality symbol  = 
• 
variables xA, yA, … for each sort A. 
 
 
Terms of L and their associated sorts are defined recursively as follows: 
• 
each variable xA is a term of sort A.  
• 
if f is a function symbol of signature(A→
, B) and τ→
 = (τ1, …, τn) is a sequence of 
terms of sorts A1, …, An, then f(τ→) is a term of sort B. 
 
Finally, the formulas of L are given recursively by the following clauses: 
• 
, ⊥ are formulas 
• 
if σ, τ are terms of the same sort, σ = τ is a formula 
• 
if α is a predicate symbol of signature A→
 and τ→
 a sequence of terms of sorts  
A1, …, An, then α(τ→) is a formula  
• 
if ϕ, ψ are formulas and x a variable ϕ ∧ ψ, ϕ ∨ ψ, ϕ → ψ, ∀xϕ, ∃xϕ are formulas 
 
As usual, ¬ϕ, ϕ ↔ ψ are written for ϕ → ⊥, (ϕ → ψ) ∧ (ψ → ϕ) respectively. It is assumed 
that L is equipped with the usual deductive apparatus of intuitionistic predicate logic, 
except that the inference rule modus ponens is subject to the stipulation that every 
variable free in the rule’s premises must also be free in its conclusion. (This is to allow, 
as in “free” logic, for the possibility that the interpretation of a sort may be empty.) This 
gives rise to an intuitionistic deducibility relation A in the usual way; we shall also write 
AC for the corresponding classical deducibility relation obtained when the law of 
excluded middle ϕ ∨ ¬ϕ is added to the axioms.  
 
Now let S be a local set theory in a local language L. An interpretation I of a first-
order language L in S assigns: 

 
46
• 
to each sort A of L, a type symbol AI  of L and an S-set AI of type PAI   
• 
to each function symbol f of L of signature (A→, B), an S-map fI : A1I × …× AnI  → 
B 
• 
to each predicate symbol α of L of signature A→,a formula aαbI of L with free 
variables x1, …, xn of types A1I, …, AnI such that AS aαbI → x1 ∈ A1I  ∧ …∧ xn ∈ AnI.  
 
The interpretation I can now be extended to all terms and formulas of L in the 
obvious recursive way, with the result that, if τ is a term of sort B, then AS  τI ∈ BI, and if 
ϕ is a formula of L, then aϕbI is a formula of L.  
An interpretation I is a model in S of a set Σ of L-formulas if ASaϕbI for all ϕ ∈ Σ. Now 
write Σ B ϕ for every model of Σ is a model of ϕ. A straightforward induction on formulas 
suffices to establish the first-order soundness theorem: Σ A ϕ  ⇒ Σ B ϕ. 
Using the internal language, the notion of interpretation of a first order language, 
and the soundness theorem can be extended to toposes in the obvious way to obtain 
Joyal and Reyes’s original concept of interpretation.   
Now each set of first-order formulas Σ can be associated with certain category 
Syn(Σ)—its syntactic category—described as follows. We shall write x, y, .. for lists of 
variables of L, and ϕ(x), etc., to indicate that the free variables of ϕ are within x. The 
objects of Syn(Σ) are formal class terms, i.e, symbols of the form {x: ϕ(x)}. An arrow  in 
Syn(Σ) between two objects {x: ϕ(x)} and {y: ϕ(y)} is defined to be an equivalence class, 
modulo Σ-provable equivalence, of formulas ϑ(x, y) which are Σ-provably functional, in 
the obvious sense, with domain {x: ϕ(x)} and codomain {y: ϕ(y)}: the arrow defined by 
ϑ(x, y) is denoted by [x 6 y| ϑ(x, y)].  
A Grothendieck topology KΣ called the finite cover topology is now introduced on 
Syn(Σ). A finite family of arrows 
[xi 6 y| ϑi(xi, y)]: {xi: ϕi(xi)}  →  {y: ψ(y)}  (i = 1, …, n) 
is said to Σ-provably epic on y: ψ(y)} if the image of the family “covers” {y: ψ(y)} in the 
sense that  
Σ A ∀y[ψ(y) → ∃x1ϑ1(x1, y) ∨ … ∨ ∃xnϑn(xn, y)]. 
For each object A = {y: ψ(y) we define KΣ(A) to consist of all cosieves on A  containing a 
provably epic family. The resulting site (Syn(Σ),KΣ) is called the syntactic site determined 
by Σ.  
 
A formula of L not containing → or ∀ is called a geometric formula. A geometric 
implication is a sentence of the form ∀x(ϕ → ψ), where ϕ and ψ are geometric. A set of 
geometric implications is called a geometric theory. The geometric category Geom(Γ) 
determined by a geometric theory Γ is constructed in the same way as was the syntactic 
category, except that throughout the construction attention is confined to geometric 
formulas. The finite cover topology KΓ is introduced on Geom(Γ) analogously; the 
resulting site (Geom(Γ),KΓ ) is called the geometric site determined by Γ.  
 
Joyal and Reyes showed that models of a geometric theory Γ in a given topos E 
correspond in a natural way to the so-called geometric functors to E defined on the 
category Geom(Γ). Here a geometric functor is a functor F: Geom(Γ) → E that is (left) 
exact, that is, preserves terminal objects, products and equalizers, and which in 
addition preserves coverings. By this is meant that, for any KΓ-covering cosieve S of an 
object A, the family of arrows {Ff: f ∈ S} covers the image FA in the sense that, for any 
arrows g, h in E with common domain A, if g  Ff = h  Ff for all f ∈ S, then g = h.

Accordingly, models of geometric theories in toposes may be identified with 
geometric functors. Joyal and Reyes showed that for each geometric theory Γ, the topos 
Set[Γ] of sheaves over the geometric site determined by Γ is the topos obtained by 
adjoining a universal model of Γ to Set. To be precise, there is a model (i.e., a geometric 
functor) M of Γ in Set[Γ] with the universal property that any model of Γ in a 
(Grothendieck) topos E can be “uniquely factored” through M.  For this reason Set[Γ] is 
called the classifying topos of Γ. This fact leads quickly to the completeness theorem for 
geometric theories, namely, for a geometric theory Γ and a geometric implication ϕ, Γ A ϕ 
if and only if ϕ is true in every model of Γ. Application of a result of Barr (1974) led to 
the discovery that “A” can be replaced by “AC”, and thence to the purely logical 
conclusion that a geometric implication classically deducible from a geometric theory is 
also intuitionistically deducible from it. 
  
The known fact that only geometric theories possess classifying toposes in the 
above sense seems to have led topos-theorists to neglect the use of syntactic sites for 
the construction of models of arbitrary first-order theories. The existence of a topos 
containing a model of an arbitrary first-order theory Σ, generic in the sense that the 
sentences true in M are precisely those deducible from Σ had been pointed out in the 
1970s by Peter Freyd (see Freyd and Scedrov 1990) and by Fourman and Scott (1979)— 
from this the full completeness theorem for first-order theories, namely, that Σ B ϕ 
implies  Σ A ϕ, quickly follows.   But it was not in fact until the late 1990s—in Butz and 
Johnstone (1998) and Palmgren (1997)— that the observation was made that, for any 
first-order theory Σ, the topos of sheaves over its syntactic site actually contains such a 
generic model of Σ.

7.  Constructive Type Theory 
 
 
Finally I come to constructive type theory (CTT). The first truly constructive theory of 
types, in the sense of being both predicative and based on intuitionistic logic,  to 
undergo systematic development, was that of Per Martin-Löf (1975, 1982, 1984). In 
introducing it his purpose was to provide, as he put it in (1975) “a full scale system for 
formalizing intuitionistic mathematics as developed, for example, in the book by 
Bishop.” The chief advantage of Martin-Löf’s framework over traditional intuitionistic 
systems was in allowing proofs to be constituents of propositions, so enabling 
propositions to express properties of proofs, and not merely individuals, as in first-
order predicate logic. Indeed, it provides a complete embodiment of the “propositions-
as-types (or sets)” idea originally suggested by Curry and Feys (1958) and Howard 
(1980).  At the root of the “propositions-as-types” conception lies the idealist notion, 
which may be traced back to Kant, that the meaning of a proposition does not derive 
from an absolute standard of truth external to the human mind, but resides rather in 
the evidence for its assertability in the form of a mental construction or proof. In the 
“propositions-as-types” interpretation, and more generally, in constructive type 
theories, each proposition is the type, or set, of its proofs. A major consequence is that 
under this interpretation these are the only sets, or types. In other words, a set is a set of 
proofs, or more generally, constructions. It is this feature that has made constructive 
type theory particularly suitable for developing the theory of computer programming. 
(Here the somewhat hazy idea of “mental constructions” has been replaced by the 
precise notion of a computer program.) 
Here is Martin-Löf himself on the matter in (1975) 
 
“Every mathematical object is of a certain kind or type. Better, a mathematical 
object is always given together with its type, that is it is not just an object: it is an 
object of a certain type. … A type is defined by prescribing what we have to do in 
order to construct an object of that type… Put differently, a type is well-defined if 
we understand…what it means to be an object of that type. … Note that it is 
required, neither that we should be able to generate somehow all the objects of a 
given type, nor that we should so to say know all of them individually. It is only a 
question of understanding what it means to be an arbitrary object of the type in 
question.  
A proposition is defined by prescribing how we are allowed to prove it, and a 
proposition holds or is true intuitionistically if there is a proof of it. … It will not be 
necessary, however, to the notion of proposition as a separate notion because  of 
that proposition.  
Conversely, each type determines a proposition, namely, the proposition that the 
type in question is nonempty. This is the proposition which we prove by exhibiting 
an object of the type in question. On this analysis, there appears to be no 
fundamental difference between propositions and types. Rather, the difference is 
one of point of view: in the case of a proposition, we are not so much interested in 
what its proofs are as in whether it has a proof, that is, whether it is true or false, 
whereas, in the case of a type, we are of course interested in what its objects are 
and not only in whether it is empty or nonempty.” 
 
A key element in Martin-Löf’s formulation of type theory is the distinction, which 
goes back to Frege, between propositions and judgments. Propositions (which, as we 
have seen, in Martin-Löf’s systems are identified with types) are syntactical objects on 
which mathematical operations can be performed and which bear certain formal 
relationships to other syntactical objects called proofs. Propositions and proofs are, so 

 
49
to speak, objective constituents of the system. Judgments, on the other hand, typically 
involve the idealist notion of “understanding” or “grasping the meaning of”. Thus, for 
example, while 2 + 2 = 4 is a proposition, “2 + 2 = 4 is a proposition” and “2 + 2 = 4 is a 
true proposition” are judgments.  
Martin-Löf also follows Frege in taking the rules of inference of logic to concern 
judgments rather than propositions. Thus, for example, the correct form of the rule of 
→ -elimination is not  
 
 
   
A
A
B
B
→
 
 
but 
 
 true  
 true
 true
A
A
B
B
→
. 
 
That is, the rule does not say that the proposition B follows from the propositions A and 
A → B, but that the truth of the proposition B follows from the truth of the proposition A 
conjoined with that of A → B. In general, judgments may be characterized as 
expressions which appear at the conclusions of rules of inference. 
Another important respect in which Martin-Löf follows Frege is in his insistence 
that judgments and formal rules must be accompanied by full explanations of their 
meaning. (This is to be contrasted with the usual model-theoretic semantics which is 
really nothing more than a translation of one object-language into another.) In 
particular, the judgment A is a proposition may be made only when one knows what a 
(canonical) proof of A is, and the judgment A is a true proposition only when one knows 
how to find such a proof. Judgments, and the notion of truth, are thus seen to be mind-
dependent.  
Martin-Löf’s various systems abound in subtle distinctions. For example, in 
addition to the distinction between proposition and judgment, there is a parallel 
distinction between type (or set) and category6 (or species). In order to be able to judge 
that A is a category one must be able to tell what kind of objects fall under it, and when 
they are equal. To be in a position to make the further judgment that a category is a 
type, or set, one must be able to specify what its  “canonical” or typical, elements are. 
In judging something to be a set, one must possess sufficient information concerning 
the its elements to enable quantification over it to make sense.  Thus, for example, the 
natural numbers form a set ` , with canonical elements given by: 0 is a canonical 
element of `, and if n is a canonical element of `, then n + 1 is a canonical element of 
`. On the other hand the collection of subsets of ` forms a category, but not a set.  
The “propositions-as-types” conception (which for convenience we abbreviate to 
PAT) gives rise to a correspondence between logical operators and operations on types 
(or sets). Tait (1994)) offers a clear exposition of the idea. To begin with, consider two 
propositions/types A and B. What should be required of a proof f of the implication       
A → B ? Just that, given any proof x of A, f should yield a proof of B, that is, f should be 
a function from A to B. In other words, the proposition A → B is just the type of 
functions from A to B: 
 
A → B = BA 
                                               
6 In this usage, of course, to be distinguished from the term as employed in its mathematical sense 
throughout the present article. 

 
50
Similarly, all that should be required of a proof c of the conjunction A ∧ B is that it 
yield proofs x and y of A and B, respectively. From the construction-theoretic point of 
view A ∧ B is accordingly just the type A × B of all pairs (x, y), with x of type A (we write 
this as x: A) and y: B.  
A proof of the disjunction A ∨ B is either a proof of A or a proof of B together with 
the information as to which of A or B it is a proof. That is, if we introduce the type 2 
with the two distinct elements 0 and 1, a proof of A ∨ B may be identified as a pair (c, n) 
in which either c is a proof of A and n is 0, or c is a proof of B and n is 1. This means 
that, from the construction-theoretic point of view, A ∨ B is the disjoint union A + B of A 
and B. 
The true proposition  may be identified with the one element type 1 = {0}: 0 thus 
counts as the unique proof of . The false proposition ⊥ is taken to be a proposition 
which lacks a proof altogether: accordingly ⊥ is identified with the empty set ∅. The 
negation ¬A of a proposition A is defined as A → ⊥, which therefore becomes identified 
with the set A∅.  
As we have already said, a proposition A is deemed to be true if it (i.e, the 
associated type) has an element, that is, if there is a function 1 → A. Accordingly the 
law of excluded middle for a proposition A becomes the assertion that there is a 
function 1 → A + ∅A.  
If a and b are objects of type A, we introduce the identity proposition or type  a =A b 
expressing that a and b are identical objects of type A. This proposition is true, that is, 
the associated type has an element, if and only if a and b are identical. In that case 
id(a) will denote an object of type a.  
In PAT one must distinguish sharply between propositions, which have proofs, and 
judgements, which do not. For example 0 =2 0 is a proposition, while “0 is of type 2” is a 
judgement. Rather than being true or false, a judgement is either assertable, or 
nonsensical.  
While 2A does not have a very natural interpretation as a proposition, it may be 
considered the type of all decidable sets of objects of type A. For given f: 2A and x: A, if 
we define elementhood by  
 
x ∈A f   iff fx = 1,  
 
then it is easy to see that x ∈A f  ∨ ¬ x ∈A f .  
   
In order to deal with the quantifiers we require operations defined on families of 
types, that is, types ϕ(x) depending on objects x of some type A. (It is for this reason that 
Martin-Löf’s system is also known as dependent type theory: see Jacobs (1999).)  By 
analogy with the case A → B, a proof f of the proposition ∀x:A ϕ(x), that is, an object of 
type ∀x:A ϕ(x),  should associate with each x: A a proof of ϕ(x). So f is just a function 
with domain A such that, for each x: A, fx is of type ϕ(x). That is, ∀x:A ϕ(x) is the product 
Πx:A ϕ(x) of the ϕ(x)’s. We use the λ-notation in writing f as λxfx.  
A proof of the proposition ∃x:A ϕ(x), that is, an object of type ∃x:A ϕ(x), should 
determine an object x: A and a proof y of ϕ(x), and vice-versa. So a proof of this 
proposition is just a pair (x, y) with x: A and y: ϕ(x). Therefore ∃x:A ϕ(x) is the disjoint 
union, or coproduct x:A ϕ(x) of the ϕ(x)’s.  
Still following Tait (1994), we introduce the functions σ, π, π′ of types ∀x:A(ϕ(x) → 
∃x:A ϕ(x)), ∃x:A ϕ(x) → A, and ∀y: (∃xϕ(x)). ϕ(π(y)) as follows.  If b: A and c: ϕ(b), then 
σbc is (b, c).  If d: ∃x:A ϕ(x), then d is of the form (b, c) and in that case π(d) = b and π′(d) 
= c. These yield the equations  
 
π(σbc) = b     π′(σbc) = c    σ(πd)(π′d) = d. 
 

 
51
The axiom of choice (AC) is the proposition 
 
∀x:A∃y:B ϕ(x, y)) → ∃x:BA∀x:A ϕ(x, fx)). 
 
AC is true in PAT, as the following argument shows. Let u be a proof of the antecedent 
∀x:A∃y:B ϕ(x, y)). Then,  for any x: A, π(ux) is of type B and π′(ux) is a proof of ϕ(x, πux). 
So s(u) = λx.π(ux) is of type BA and t(u) = λx. π′(ux) is a proof of ∀x:A ϕ(x, s(u)x). 
Accordingly λu.σs(u)t(u) is a proof of ∀x:A∃y:B ϕ(x, y)) →  ∃x:BA ∀x:Aϕ(x, fx)). 
In ordinary set theory—indeed in local set theory—this argument establishes the 
isomorphism of the sets Πx:Ay:B ϕ(x, y))  and f:BA Πx:A ϕ(x, fx)), but not the validity of 
the axiom of choice. In (local) set theory AC is not is not represented by this 
isomorphism, but is rather (equivalent to) the equality in which Π is replaced by ∩ and 
 by ∪, namely

While in PAT AC has no “untoward” logical consequences, in local or intuitionistic 
set theory, or in the internal language of a topos, this is far from being the case, for 
there, as we know, AC implies the law of excluded middle. Let us repeat the argument 
in a simplified form.  
Suppose given a choice function f on the power set of the set 2 = {0, 1}. Let α be any 
proposition, and define  
 
U = {x∈2: x = 0 ∨ α}    V = {x∈2: x = 1 ∨ α}. 
 
Writing a = fU, b = fV, we have a ∈ U, b ∈ V, i.e.,  
 
(#)                                               [a = 0 ∨ α] ∧ [b = 1 ∨ α]. 
 
It follows that 
 
[a = 0 ∧ b = 1] ∨ α, 
 
whence 
 
(*)                                                            a ≠ b  ∨ α, 
 
 
Now clearly 
 
α ⇒ U = V = 2  ⇒ a = b, 
 
whence 
 
a ≠ b ⇒ ¬α. 
 
But this and (*) together imply ¬α ∨ α. (In fact, we need only assume the choice 
function to be defined on the set {U, V}.) 
Given that AC holds in PAT, it is of interest to ask why these arguments cannot be 
reproduced there. Now the first argument seems to hinge on two assumptions, first, 
that the sets U and V are well defined and satisfy the usual “eliminability” conditions 

 
52
leading to the assertability of (#) above. And secondly, that the choice function f 
satisfies extensionality in the sense that, if U and V are extensionally identical, then fU 
= fV.  It seems to be the case that when subset types are added to PAT (in Martin-Löf’s 
system), the ‘eliminability” condition 
 
a ∈ {x: ϕ(x)} → ϕ(a) 
  
fails. Concerning the second argument, this seems to fail essentially because in PAT the 
value of a function defined on a (sub)set X depends not only on the variable member x 
of X but also on the proof that x is in fact in X. Thus suppose given types A, B and a 
subset X = {x: β(x)} of A. Write p A α for “p is a proof of α”. Then in  PAT  from ∀x:A[β(x) → 
∃y:Bϕ(x, y)] we can infer the existence of a function f: {(x, p): p A β(x)} → B for which 
∀x∀p[p A β(x) → ϕ(x, f(x,p))]. Now return to Diaconescu’s argument. Here A is P2, the 
power set of 2 (supposing that to be present), β(x) is ∃x. x ∈ X (X a variable of type P2), B 
is 2 and ϕ(X, y) is y ∈ X. Now, given a proposition α, define the subsets U and V as 
before. Constructively, the only proof of ∃x. x ∈ U to be had is by exhibiting a member of 
U, and , since α is not known to be true, the only exhibitable member of U is 0. 
Similarly, the only exhibitable member of V is 1. Accordingly, writing a = f(U, 0) and b = 
f(V, 1), we derive (*) above as before (assuming subset eliminability). But now while α → 
U = V, we cannot infer that U = V → a = b, so blocking the derivation of α → a = b. 
So, as Maietti and Valentini (1999) showed, if extensional power sets are suitably 
added to PAT (or CTT), logic becomes classical there. 
 
In the “propositions as types” interpretation each logical operation corresponds to a 
categorical operation: ∧ to ×, ∨ to +, → to exponentiation, ⊥ to an initial element 0,  ¬ to 
exponentiation by 0, ∀ to product and ∃ to coproduct. This suggests that constructive 
type theory should be interpretable in suitable categories, just as local set theories are 
interpretable in toposes. For some time it was conjectured that the appropriate 
categories in this respect were the so-called locally Cartesian closed categories: these 
are finitely complete categories E such that, for each object A of E,  the “slice” category 
E/A is Cartesian closed. (Any topos is locally Cartesian closed.) It was already known 
that many of the mathematical constructions within a topos could be carried out within 
a locally Cartesian closed category. In such a category, the notion of “variable set”, for 
example an “A-indexed set” , is represented by an arrow B → A of E, that is, by an 
object of E /A. In the interpretation of constructive type theory that was explicitly 
worked out by Seely (1984), types are interpreted as objects, and terms as arrows, of a 
locally Cartesian closed category E. As Seely pointed out, this interpretation engenders 
a systematic ambiguity among the notions of type, predicate and term, and between 
object and proof: indeed a term of type A is an arrow into A, which is in turn a predicate 
over A, and an arrow 1 → A may be regarded either as an object of type A or as a proof 
of the proposition A. (This ambiguity is, of course, shared by the “propositions as types” 
interpretation.)  In precise analogy with the correspondence between local set theories 
and toposes, Seely establishes a correspondence between theories formulated in 
Martin-Löf’s 
system—constructive 
type 
theories—and 
locally 
Cartesian 
closed 
categories. 
  
These correspondences yield in turn a correspondence between local set theories 
and constructive type theories. To wit, starting with a local set theory S, we may 
consider the topos C(S) determined by S: as observed above, this is a locally Cartesian 
closed category and so has an associated constructive type theory T(S). It can be shown 
that S is witnessed and sententially classical if and only if the law of excluded middle 
for all propositions holds in T(S), and Awodey (1995) essentially shows that S is choice if 
and only if , for every S-set I, the law of excluded middle for all propositions holds in 

 
53
T(SI). On the other hand,  that the axiom of choice automatically holds in T(S) —as it 
does in any constructive type theory—corresponds merely to the easily verified fact 
that, for any family {

. This shows once more the 
essentially different status of the axiom of choice in local set theory and constructive 
type theory.   
The relationship between type theories and categories is investigated in a general 
setting in Jacobs (1999).

Appendix  
Basic Concepts of Category Theory 
 
 
A category C is determined by first specifying two classes Ob(C), Arr(C)—the collections 
of C-objects and C-arrows. These collections are subject to the following axioms: 
 
• 
Each C-arrow f is assigned a pair of C-objects dom(f), cod(f) called   the  domain  
and   codomain  of f,  respectively.  To   indicate  the  fact  that  C-objects  X  and  
Y  are  respectively   the   domain  and   codomain  of  f  we write f: X → Y or 
f
X
Y
→
. The collection of C-arrows with domain X and codomain Y is written 
C(X, Y). 
 
• 
Each C-object X is assigned a C-arrow 1X: X → X called the 
identity arrow on X. 
 
• 
Each pair f, g of C-arrows such that cod(f) = dom(g) is assigned an arrow            
g  f:  dom(f) → cod(g)   called  the  composite  of  f  and  g. Thus if f: X → Y and           
g: Y → Z  then g  f: X → Z. We also write  
f
g
X
Y
Z
→
→
for  g  f. Arrows f, 
g satisfying cod(f) = dom(g) are called composable. 
 
• 
Associativity law. For composable arrows (f, g) and (g, h), we have   h  (g  f) =    
h  (g  f). 
       
      #  Identity law. For any arrow f: X → Y, we have f  1X = f = 1Y  f. 
 
As a basic example of a category, we have the category Set of sets whose objects are 
all sets and whose arrows are all maps between sets (strictly, triples (f, A, B) with 
domain(f) = A and range(f) ⊆B.) Other examples of categories are the category of groups, 
with objects all groups and arrows all group homomorphisms and the category of 
topological spaces with objects all topological spaces and arrows all continuous maps. 
Categories with just one object may be identified with monoids, that is, algebraic 
structures with an associative multiplication and an identity element. 
 
A subcategory C  of a category D is any category whose class of objects and arrows 
is included in the class of objects and arrows of D, respectively, and which is closed 
under domain, codomain, identities, and composition. If, further, for any objects C, C′ 
of C, we have C(C, C′) = D(C, C′), we shall say that C is a full subcategory of D.

A category is cartesian closed if it has a terminal object, as well as products and 
exponentials of arbitrary pairs of its objects. It is finitely complete if it has a terminal 
object, products of arbitrary pairs of its objects, and equalizers. A topos is a category 
possessing a terminal object, products, a truth-value object, and power objects. It can 
be shown that every topos is cartesian closed and finitely complete (so that this notion 
of topos is equivalent to that originally given by Lawvere and Tierney).  
More on products in a category. A product of objects A1, ..., An in a category C is an 
object A1 × ... × An together with arrows πi: A1 × ...× An → Ai for i = 1, ..., n, such that, for 
any arrows fi: B  → Ai, i = 1, ..., n, there is a unique   arrow ,    denoted  by   <f1, ..., fn>:   
B → A1 × ...× An   such    that   πi  <f1, ..., fn> = fi, i = 1, ..., n. Note that,  when n = 0,   
A1 × ...× An is the terminal object 1. The category is said to have finite products if          
A1 × ...× An exists for all A1, ..., An. If C  has binary products, it has finite products, since 
we may take A1× ...× An to be A1 × (A2 × (...× An)...). It is easily seen that the product 
operation is, up to isomorphism, commutative and associative. The relevant 
isomorphisms are called canonical isomorphisms. 
A functor F: C → D between two categories C and D is a map that “preserves 
commutative diagrams”, that is, assigns to each C-object A a D-object FA and to each 
C-arrow f: A → B  a D-arrow Ff:  FA → FB in such a way that: 
 
 
     A 
 
                 FA 
          f       |                               Ff

                          |                                                                  F(g  f) = Fg  Ff 
               h            g                                                       Fh              Fg 
  
                y                                                      y

faithful:  Ff = Fg  ⇒ f = g. 
• 
full:  for any h: FA → FB there is f: A → B such that h = Ff. 
• 
dense:  for any D-object B there is a C-object A such that B  ≅ FA. 
Two categories are equivalent, written  , if there is an equivalence between them. 
Equivalence is the appropriate notion of “identity of form” for categories. 
 
Given functors F, G: C → D, a natural transformation between F and G is a map  η 
from the objects of C to the arrows of D satisfying the following conditions. 
 
• 
For each object A of C, ηA is an arrow FA → GA in D 
• 
For each arrow f: A → A′ in C,  
                                                           ηA 
 
                                                    FA                GA 
 
                                                         Ff                               Gf  
                                                                                        ηA′        
                                                            FA′               GA′   commutes. 
 
 
Finally, two functors F: C → D and G: D →C  and are said to be adjoint to one 
another if, for any objects A of C, B of D, there is a “natural” bijection between arrows  
A → GB in C  and arrows FA → B in D. To be precise, for each such pair A, B we must 
be given a bijection ϕAB: C(A, GB) → D(FA, B) satisfying the “naturality” conditions 
• 
for each f: A → A′ and h: A′ → GB, ϕAB(h  f) = ϕA′B(h)  Ff 
• 
for each g: B → B′ and h: A → GB′, ϕAB(Gg  h) =  g  ϕAB′(h). 
Under these conditions F is said to be left adjoint to G, and G right adjoint to F.
