Welcome to Street Hypnosis Boot Camp.
Applause
Welcome back everyone. I’ve seen a lot of familiar faces which makes me 
very excited. I know that this means our job will be so much easier, so thanks 
for coming back. Let me check, how many of you are here for the first time? 
About half. How many of you have already done some form of hypnosis 
before? 
This is going to be such a breeze, isn’t it?
Probably more then what’s going to happen.
They’re going to get in so much trouble now.
I’m thinking that’s happening.
I’m excited. Let’s just have a quick second to find out where people are from. 
How many people are here from the U.S.? I’d guess that’s most of you. Is 
anyone here from somewhere not the U.S.? 
The Netherlands.
Not bad. We have the Netherlands, the U.S., Australia (that’s a long way to 
come, I hope it’s worth it), Scotland, Canada, Sweden (we like Sweden). A lot 
of you are from Australia, guess we’ll have to go there next. That’s the place 
to be.
Australia’s in the house.
We have a nice mix here. My name is Igor Ledochowski, as you probably 
already know. I’m here with the world’s fastest hypnotist Spencer Spencer. 
You will love him. 
Applause
How many of you have seen Spencer in action before? Wasn’t he amazing?
Cool.
For the next three days, even though it’s a four day course we’ll only be 
working for three days, do you know why?

We’re going to have fun on the fourth day.
You guessed it, on the fourth day you’ll have a lot of fun. You see, our aim for 
the next four days is to drill you. This is called boot camp for a reason. We’re 
going to work you hard. We’ll work you so hard, that by the fourth day every 
one of you in this room will be doing a show up here in Vegas, filmed, you’ll 
get a tape and everything. 
You’ll love it. It’ll be so easy you’ll wonder why you ever had any nerves or 
trepidation about that before. Wouldn’t that be something?
Yes.
How many of you feel a bit nervous about that right now?
Laughter
That’s only natural. One of the keys to creating confidence is competence. 
The key to creating competence, of course, is to practice correctly the right 
things. 
One of the things I want to ask you to do over the next three days with us is 
to give it your all. These are long days. We’ll be working 12 hours a day, from 
9:00 a.m. to 9:00 p.m., long days. So, when you’re feeling tired, that’s the 
time to give it extra.
Has anyone here ever been to the Army? Isn’t that how the Army works in 
boot camp they tire you out? When you’re tired is when the skills come in, so 
when you actually being under pressure that’s where we’ll come out and we 
will tire you out, I promise you this. It’s guaranteed!
The only thing I’ll ask for you to do–
1. Number one is to keep a good attitude. Have fun with this. This is a fun 
thing to do. 
2. Number two is to give it your all, especially when you’re tired. Go that 
extra mile.
You know we’ll go to 9:30 at the latest; we will finish. Then you can go 
upstairs and collapse in your bed, and it’s done. So until 9:00 or 9:30, give it 
everything you’ve got. Are you guys going to be okay with this?
Yes!
Okay, now we’ve got some hypnotists in the room.

There we go. I wanted to add one thing real quick. Who has a cell phone in 
their pocket? Please turn it off or put it on vibrate and enjoy yourself, the 
show, your time here.
The clean show.
Okay, so we’re going to be working very hard over the next three days to 
prepare you, to teach you everything you need to know to be a great stage 
hypnotist and make a career out of this. 
Out of curiosity, how many people here are actually thinking of doing this 
part-time or full-time, as a kind of money earner, career type thing? About 
three-thirds of the group or something like that. Excellent! Well our aim is to 
give you everything you need, especially on day three, as we’ll look at things 
like the business aspect and stuff like that.
You can’t ask for better than Spencer for someone with experience on that 
side of things, so you’ll be getting Spencer not me. 
Spencer, haven’t you arranged something special as well on the last day, 
Sunday?
The last day we do have something special going down. We’ll be doing a bit 
of hypnosis for everyone here. It will be a mini demonstration of something 
you may see what I do when I do a hypnosis show, so we’ll throw something 
in for you all to enjoy. I think you’ll like that.
Then, Sunday night, I have a pass for everyone here to go to a local hypnosis 
show here in Vegas, no charge, if you’re interested. If you’re interested raise 
your hands, because I need to know how many tickets I need to get. 
This isn’t just a little show it’s like currently, the premiere hypnotist in Vegas. 
He’s on the strip at Planet Hollywood, which is a huge casino. I’ve seen the 
show it’s very exciting and fun. You’ll be seeing it right after you’ve done your 
show, so you can go in and go, I can do better then that.
Laughter
I have to tell you, you will be doing better then that, guaranteed!
You’ll have the enthusiasm still live and running inside you, whereas, doing 
these same shows every single day…he’s a great hypnotist don’t get me 
wrong, a great showman, so you’ll pick up a lot of stuff… but that’s a nice little 
bonus that Spencer arranged for you, so you can buy him a beer in the bar 
later.
Please do.

Applause
Just one note, please wait until Sunday to buy him that beer, because if all of 
you buy him a beer there’ll be no more teaching.
All right. You are about to embark on probably, one of the most fun and 
exciting careers that exists in my opinion. You’ve been doing it for what, 
some 18-20 years now?
Eighteen to twenty plus that, a long time.
When I first met Spencer I said how often do you work? He said I don’t work.
It’s not a job, its fun. When you get to travel around the world and meet 
people, get paid well and taken care of, it’s fun.
This is what I’d like all of you to understand, having the spirit of what we’re 
doing today. This is a tremendous amount of fun, so I want you to enjoy 
yourselves. We’re going to take the pressure right off you for the rest of the 
day.
In other words, whilst we’re doing the inductions and so on, you know the 
classic thing, just pretend to go into trance and just play along with it for now 
and we’ll see what happens. For those of you who have trained with me 
before kind of know what’s coming, but the point is that I don’t want you to 
feel that you have to get any specific results yet.
Right now it’s about training. The results will take care of themselves is that 
okay with you?
Yes.
All you have to do is say some words, point some things, look like a hypnotist 
and that’s pretty much it. Can you do that?
Yes.
Very good. The key thing I want you to focus on over the next three/four days 
is your attitude. In other words, how much fun, how much persona you are 
projecting. You can’t do that when you’re inhibited and in fear, unless of 
course, you’re on stage for seven days like the world’s most anxious 
hypnotist, which could be a draw all by itself.
Laughter
I’m guessing that’s not quite the stage persona you want to be cultivating, is 
that correct?

Students:
Igor:
Spencer:
Yes.
So, spend the next few days just having fun, letting that excitement you have 
come through in what you’re doing and enjoy. That’s key, because if you 
don’t have that then you don’t have a show. We’ll teach you the mechanics, 
but one thing I can’t teach you is how to be yourself, because you have a lot 
more practice at doing that then I do.
Bring yourself to the table, enjoy it, have fun with it, play around with it and it’ll 
all go well.
When it comes to actually doing this, in terms of going live out there and 
having a go in the real world, you know something that’s going to be very 
important for you because you’ll have a reference experience and know 
you’ve done it.
Before Sunday we’ll make sure that you have plenty of dress rehearsal, so 
come Sunday, you’ll already know what you’re doing. My aim is to give you a 
skill that will be with you for the rest of your life. 
When I was young and at university I was into martial arts, etc. and one of my 
instructors tried to give us a talk during the day and said you’re coming close 
to your black belt soon and there’s something you should know. 
Once you reach your black belt, no matter what happens to you, how your 
career goes and so on, you will never go hungry because all you have to do 
is hang up a shingle and there’ll always be people who want to learn how to 
defend themselves. That made sense to me and I’d like to give you the same 
piece of advice.
No matter what happens to you in your life or career, after this weekend you 
will never go hungry because you’ll always have a skill you can fall back on, a 
skill that isn’t going to go out of fashion. That’s my aim for you, and it’s not a 
backup plan, it is actually a lifestyle. 
In other words, some of you will love it so much that you might think right 
now, I’ll dabble with it a bit and do a couple shows and so on…that’s kind of 
what happened to you isn’t it?
When I first started I was doing clinical hypnotherapy and got really burned 
out on it. After doing it for about 10 years and working with thousands of 
people, I decided I needed to lighten up a little bit. So, I began dabbling with 
it, working in nightclub after nightclub and it just hit me.

I said to myself, I can’t go back and be a clinician anymore I’ve got to go out 
there and just have fun, and it overtook my entire life. And, what he’s talking 
about is so true because you can pick your hours, your days and your city, 
and there’s no reason why you can’t…any time of your life you can pick up 
the phone and say I think I’m going to go out and make $5000 tonight, and 
you do.
It might take you an hour to do that. Would that be a hard thing to do? Or 
maybe you only make $1000 for an hour.
Oh dear.
Laughter
I have to go back to working at McSpencerald’s right?
Why not, let’s go back to McSpencerald’s. So, you’ll always have these skills 
that you can take with you everywhere for the rest of your life, whether it’s 
working in nightclubs or theaters, working in the corporate world or with clubs, 
organizations and schools, it all lies within you.
And if you have a taste for adventure folks, this is a great thing. You can get 
free cruises this way. You get invited to all kinds of exciting countries, 
seriously. Weren’t you just invited somewhere cool just recently?
One of the coolest places in the entire world. I just got back from Dubai. If you 
haven’t been there, it’s a place you better take extra money with, because 
there are no bargains there. I went there and did three incredible shows and it 
went so well they invited me to stay for an extra week. They twisted my arm.
The coolest thing about that, going someplace like Dubai and on that level 
that I have many experiences most of the time is that they treat you to first-
class roundtrip airfare, five star hotels, limousine service everywhere you go 
and you have a complete staff at your beck and call, taking care of all your 
needs. All you have to do is show up.
And, you never know what kind of royalty you’ll meet in foreign countries who 
will come to your show and give you expensive gifts. 
Doesn’t that beat paying $100,000 grand to go to law school?
Laughter
Think about it.

I’ll mention this quickly but won’t tell exactly what happened because it’s not 
proper protocol, but I was doing a demonstration at a club there called 
Kavali’s, which is the most exclusive club in Dubai. It’s a very sheik place. 
Dubai is a very cosmopolitan place. 
So I’m doing this demonstration, they invited me over there because they 
heard about me on the radio and TV. I was on all the media, it was 
everywhere in the Arab world. They did this incredibly huge article in the 
Saudi paper that is distributed to over a million people.
So, I was doing this demonstration and this gentleman comes up to me, takes 
my hand and looking down I feel this big wad of cash, he goes just put it in 
your pocket. I’m going okay cool. I’m not going to say how much it was but it 
was not bad, more then most people make in a month.
A few minutes later one of the sheiks came down and wanted to meet me 
again, he pulled me down and kisses me on the head, takes a watch off his 
arm and says this is for you. Yes, it is a Rolex.
Now, results do vary. 
Laughter
It could have been a Timex or Casio.
This is where I want you to get excited, because the potential for what you’re 
learning now is immense. It’s up to you with your imagination and creativity 
and how far you push it. If you want to just do local shows that’s fine, if you 
want to go more crazy and do crazy things that’s fine as well, but I wanted 
you to be inspired in terms of where this could go, if you start applying 
yourself. It will require that you apply yourself.

Igor:
The potential is unlimited and you do need to apply yourself. It is a job, but it’s 
a fun job. It’s a lifestyle, that’s what it is. It’s something you embrace and 
sooner or later it embraces you and you become it. So, as a stage hypnotist 
you are the product and what’s being marketed is you.
Over the course of the next four days do not be me or Igor, be you. You have 
to be you, if you are just you and genuine in who you are then that’s what’s 
going to come out in the show. Don’t go out and try to emulate anybody else, 
just be you.
And perhaps one day you too will be in a city built in the middle of a desert, 
telling people things like, everyone put your hands out like this.
Exactly like that.
And, of course, that’s right…some people won’t quite understand what you 
mean…you say it’s very simple, you just put your hands out like this. 
One or two people will start catching on as you start doing this, but then 
they’ll go okay…put your hands out just like this.
When you put your hands out just like this…
Eventually, more and more people begin to understand what you’re doing. 
You’re doing a show right, put your hands out to this you’ll say to them, and 
they’ll put their hands out just like this with enthusiasm and eagerness.
They might even put their hands together.
And then perhaps interlock those fingers, as you say to them, squeeze those 
fists tightly, fingers locking tightly.
Make sure they’re locked and glued as tightly as you can imagine.
Imagine and feel those hands coming together tighter and tighter.
So tight that they do not want to come apart.
Watch those hands. Focus your mind.
Feel them tighter and tighter.
Tighter and tighter, like cement.

Like magnets stuck together.
Sticking tighter and tighter now.
Even if you wanted to take them apart they would stick tighter and tighter.
Feel that tightness developing now. Imagine it. Want it to be true and it will be 
true.
You can try to pull them apart, but they just stick tighter and tighter.
The harder you try the tighter the stick more and more, tighter together.
I’m sure you’re satisfied now how stuck they are, and I’ll know exactly how 
tight they are and how stuck they are when you close your eyes, if you want 
to.
And relax all the way down.
Just like that.
Fingers relaxing, as quickly as your mind relaxes, all the way down.
Because it just becomes easier and easier for you.
That’s right.
To let go like this.
Let those hands drift down into a comfortable relaxed place.
That’s right.
Your hands.
Letting go more.
Having a wisdom all of their own.
And each time that you respond to these ideas…
Teaching you about relaxation…
…and you just drop deeper.
…and opening up, hands releasing now.

Feel your heart

It beats automatically
Open your mind wide
And it does
To all that you are
And you are
All that you can be
And you will be
Is becoming now
And that’s why you’re here
More than you were
Feel good now
Begin to feel that inside
Let it spread
A sense of who you truly are
Throughout your mind
And bring that

Who are you?

Who are you really?

Your mind, your whole breathing, taking it in now
Everybody’s watching you
Because it’s time that you take a sense of all this and come back out only 
quickly enough for you to realize that the next four days are going to be a 
rollercoaster of fun. Don’t you think?

Embrace the Attitude
Igor:
It would be a remix if you were starting a stage hypnosis course without there 
being hypnosis. I’m sorry we’re not going to start yet, because really it’s more 
important about what you’re doing then what we’re doing isn’t it.
Isn’t it about what you can do at the end of these four days? On day four 
you’ll be showing us exactly what you’re capable of. You’ll love this.
Now, one of the things that – those of you who have trained with me before, 
of course, we’re familiar with and for those of you that haven’t we’ll be familiar 
with you very soon– is one of those important things in acquiring a skill is that 
you adopt a role, something to tell your unconscious mind what to aspire to.
When you adopt a role, what I do not mean by that is that you beat yourself 
up every time you’re not performing like that and they’re like oh, my God I’m 
supposed to be doing it like this and I’m not doing it. That’s not what I’m 
talking about. 
When you adopt a role, it’s like…has anyone ever seen kids playing let’s 
pretend…they’re pouring tea that’s not in the cup and it’s like where’s the 
tea? Do you expect me to drink air what’s going on? But they come quite 
happy to pour the tea and if they make a mistake it’s no big deal, they build it 
into their fantasy.
Would it be all right for the next three days if you jumped in and pretended 
something? Maybe that you are the world’s fastest, funniest, cleverest, most 
impressive or anxious, whatever you want, stage hypnotist in the world? 
Wouldn’t that be something? 
You all have an idea of what kind of a stage hypnotist you want to be and 
what you want to be known for, like the most exciting, speed or the fastest 
hypnotist, charisma whatever…I want you to start adopting that persona right 
now and just pretend. If you fall short of it, do you know what’s going to 
happen? Nothing, seriously.
If you say I’m the world’s most charismatic hypnotist, no one is going to say 
no you’re not look, you have the charisma of a wet leaf of cabbage, and 
you’re like all right thank you. It’s not going to happen. You can step into the 
role step-by-step and if you make a mistake or fall out of character, no big 
deal, just step back into it afterwards.
This is more about you all having fun right.

I remember a while back I went with one of my cousins to a murder mystery 
party. We dressed up like it was the 1920s or something like that, it was a lot 
of fun. Everyone is being from a fancy dressed party or something like that 
where you come as the wookie monster or shaving beast, etc.
Why do you do that? It’s so you can play out the character a little bit. So, 
would it be okay for you all to play up a little character whilst you’re here? 
Unfortunately, I don’t have any top hats and monocles to hand out, but you 
could pretend to be one of the world’s greatest hypnotists could you not?
You can be the greatest, the fastest, the cleverest or funniest, whatever 
superlative works for you, just choose one now. You don’t have to be stuck 
with it, you can cycle through them. You know the old saying ‘specialization is 
for insects.’ So you can be the fastest today and the cleverest tomorrow, and 
the funniest the day after.
Just choose one to start with, try it on for size and see what develops, is that 
fair?
Yes.
I want you to start getting into the role, by actually meeting everyone else in 
the room so everyone stand up and ask the magic questions which 
are…what do people normally ask when they meet each other. What do you 
do? And they go who the hell are you and why are you asking me these 
questions.
The typical question is simply, who are you? I don’t care if you give your 
name or not, but what I do care about is that everyone in this room knows 
you’re the world’s fastest, cleverest, etc. etc. hypnotist of all time. Who is 
really a function of what in this sense?
What do you do? Guess what, stage hypnotist, but not just a stage hypnotist 
you’re THE stage hypnotist. Then just have a couple seconds of chat about 
why you’re here and what it is that you’re going to be contributing to this 
seminar. Notice I’m not saying what are you here to learn? I’m asking you to 
tell people why I’ve invited you to come here to help me teach, because 
unfortunately, I’m nowhere near as good as you guys.
I’ll need your help, so tell everyone else why it is I invited you over and they’ll 
believe you. Is that easy to do? Three simple questions with three simple 
answers. There are eight of you in the room, so we’re going to give you eight 
minutes to meet everyone in the room. Off you go. 
Did you enjoy that so far? 
Yes.

Let’s add a little bit to it then shall we.
All right, here’s what I want you to do this time. This is something that 
happens to everybody when they begin doing stage hypnosis or even as a 
hypnotist. What I want you to do is this, nobody else knows anything about 
who you are or what you do, so when you’re doing a presentation it is your 
presentation, nobody knows what it’s about.
Even if there are other hypnotists in the room, they don’t have a clue about 
who you are or what the dynamics of your personality is or what your shows 
about, so what I want you to do now is the same exercise and let’s just 
exaggerate it. 
Imagine that you’re just talking to somebody and they know absolutely 
nothing about what it is you do, and you have to convince them right now that 
what you’re doing is the absolute best thing in the entire world. Does that 
make sense?
Yes.
Just to add something, which is whilst you’re doing this you may as well get 
outrageous. Convince them of something just totally and utterly ridiculous, as 
related to hypnosis. Why? Because you’re the authority and they will believe 
you. Now, you don’t have to do this in the real world, just here. Just go out on 
a limb for a bit and really put some conviction to what you’re saying. 
Let me tell you why this works. When I was over in Dubai, I was with a 
gentleman who wanted to do some street hypnosis, so I said okay cool let’s 
do it. We went out on the streets of Dubai hypnotizing people, it was kind of 
nutty, and I’m watching this guy who was convincing people that he knew 
what he was doing and I was watching going, they actually believe you.
That’s all it takes.
That’s all. It’s true.
Just like the Bellagio Brothers, put your hands up a second again isn’t that 
pretty much all you did? These guys here, you may have seen them on 
videos on the Internet, at the last hypnotherapy training these guys decided 
to go out randomly one day to the Bellagio.
The point is its fun isn’t it? Once you break that seal its so easy to do, so go 
ahead and do the same exercise again, only this time step into your shoes 
and through it all as fully and completely as you can by getting extravagant, 
outrageous and make claims that are crazy and people will believe you.
Are you having fun?

Now, let’s do something crazy, why is it that suddenly the energy and 
enthusiasm in the room went up the minute you didn’t have to constrain 
yourself to being any particular way? Just something to keep in the back of 
your mind and whatever it is you just did, I want you to do more of that over 
the next three days.
Once you get out into the real world its okay to start quieting it down again 
and finding a more realistic persona, but whilst you’re in here please get as 
extreme as you can whilst keeping it PG.

No nudity please, no suggestion of nudity, no mining of sex act’s that’s not 
the kind of show we’re doing here right now, just put it out there. So are you 
guys having fun with this?
Yes.

What we’re going to do now is we’re going to start going into this as an 
actual, being a hypnotist kind of thing. 
Can I borrow you sir, seeing as you’re close? Give him a round of applause.
Applause
How are you, are you good?
Yes.
Look at me, take a deep breath and sleep all the way, deeper, deeper, 
deeper that’s right all the way. I’m going to stand you up and you’re going 
deeper into trance as you stand on your own balance now. That’s right, 
deeper and deeper into trance, deeper and deeper. Hand out stiff and rigid, 
stiff and rigid.
The stiffer it gets the more you feel good inside. The stiffer it gets the better of 
a hypnotist you become. The stiffer it gets the better of a hypnotist you 
become. Stiff and rigid right now. Try and bend the arm, try as hard as you 
can, and relax. All the way down. All the way down that’s right, very good.
You’re doing a great job and because you’ve done such a great job Sperling, 
I want you to know that you’re going to be absolutely amazing at this. You’re 
going to take to this like a duck to water. People are going to look at you and 
go man, have you done this before? Of course, you have but this time you’ll 
be doing even better than ever before.
So with that thought inside your mind, one-two-three coming out slowly. Four-
five eyes open wide awake and feeling good. How are you doing?
Good.
Excellent. Good job, off you go. Applause
Slowly but surely ease back into the real world. Who wants to learn how to do 
that? Just a few people. Some of you have done this already to some extent, 
so bear with us as we build this up. We will be going into new territory I 
assure you, but we want to be sure we pick it up right at the beginning so that 
everything comes smoothly.

The most important thing when you do any form of hypnosis is that you have
to have the right context for hypnosis to occur. That could be the simplest 
thing, I am a hypnotist and people go oh, really? Do you have the right 
context now?
Yes.
Versus I’m a hypnotist, ah huh. Do you have the right context now? What’s 
missing?
Attention.
Right. In fact, if you say it the right way with the right person, you’ll have 
attention and the bypassing of the critical factor, the first three stages of 
hypnosis in the same place, so that’s all I want you guys to do is go around 
the room with as many different people as possible.
Let me borrow you again. All I want you to do is put your hand on their 
shoulders and start controlling them a little bit. Spread your feet lightly and 
look at me…that’s it…do I have his attention?
Yes.
Have I controlled that attention?
Yes.
So all I want you to do is put your hands on his shoulders, ask him for one act 
of compliance like spreading his feet apart, looking up at you just one act of 
compliance. Say please do this or if you want to have two that’s fine, now do 
this as well or adjust it this way.
Now look at me…that’s it. Is this difficult?
No.
Can anyone look at other people?
Yes.
All right, off you go.
Did you all enjoy that?
Yes.

Was it easy? Did anyone find that difficult? I should hope not, because this 
isn’t exactly rocket science, yet.
The next step is to make sure we’re looking for something now. 
Can I borrow you again? You’ll have to control them physically, so we’ll 
invade their space slightly because that puts them a little on edge and you 
want them there. You’ll control them physically, act for an act of compliance 
(come forward and look up at me).
I want you to look at and focus on their eyes until you see a slight shift. Can 
you see how his face has relaxed a little bit? He’s sinking down a little and is 
becoming a little more cataleptic, in other words, there’s less motion from 
him, he’s not doing the whole moving around and all these little mannerisms 
are disappearing. 
Can you all see that? These are the things we’re looking for, so once you 
have that there, all you need to do is take one of your hands, cup it on the 
back of his head like this and pressing a little. If they have glasses ask to 
borrow their glasses, tell them and then show them they’re going to be put 
somewhere safe, maybe in your pocket or a chair no one will be sitting on.
Take control of that for safety reasons. So, you’re here, take this hand put it 
on the back of their head and all you’re going to do now is tip that head 
forward until it touches your shoulder. Is that hard to do?
No.
A couple of warnings here. For one, don’t do this – whack- did everyone get 
that? Noses break easily. Foreheads are nice, smooth and soft and they’re 
designed to fit into shoulders, I don’t know why but it’s true, God designed us 
to be hypnotists. So make sure the forehead is guided into your shoulder, not 
the knobbly, elbowy hard bit on the corner, just the curvy part because it fits 
there naturally.
Have them there and that’s it. Gently, don’t yank them in or break their necks, 
just bring them in so you’re controlling their balance. Is that easy to do?
Yes.
We have a question.
What if you’re vertically challenged, like I am and somebody is a foot taller 
than you?
The first thing to do is work with someone like Sperling and then you’ll realize 
that you can do anything. If you’re going to have someone slightly larger, just 
take half a step back so that you can brace yourself. 

© Street Hypnosis Publishing All Rights Reserved
25
                                 
All you’re going to do at this point is bring them in, take a step back so you 
can take the weight and slide them in gently until you have it right where you 
want it. Now, even then you don’t have to go the whole way. If they’re really 
tall you may want to sit them down, that’s fine too. 
You don’t actually have to drag them down, you just have to make sure they 
start coming forward a little, even if you don’t take their balance at that point 
that’s fine, but for most people you’ll be able to do it quite comfortably from 
your shoulder without any problems.
Does that answer your question?
Yes, thank you.
Any other questions?
I want to add something to that. I get that a lot because I’m vertically 
challenged a lot. I’m not a tall guy, although I work with a lot of really big 
people so I want to add another dimension to that. I know you’re doing this 
soft thing, I’m going to borrow your subject one more time…another thing you 
can do where they don’t even have to come down…oftentimes, I’ll just say 
look right here and sleep.
I’ll hold their heads like that and it makes it real easy to do.
These things are easy and we will play with other mechanics as we go along.
I just wanted to address that because it’s easy to do so there are a lot of 
different tricks you can do or mechanics you can do.
All right, for a moment just get used to a simple mechanics like this one and 
we’ll start playing elaboration. And by the way, if you prefer that version just 
go with that and adapt whatever we’re doing, it’ll be really easy.
Does everyone know what they’re doing? If so, just to confirm…
Number 1- Control them
Number 2- Get compliance 
Number 3- Eye contact
Number 4- Look for that state of focus to start to develop
Number 5- Cup your hand on the back of their necks and gently 
guide them into shoulder
That’s it; you don’t have to do anything else. Is that easy?
Yes.

Off you go –exercise-
Stay where you are and face the front. Is that easy so far?
Yes.
Okay. We have hand and shoulders, now we’re going to bring him forward. At 
this point we’re going to do something crazy. I hope this isn’t too advanced 
for you. We’re going to speak to him at the same time.
Look at me…sleep. That’s right deeper, all the way. On the count of five 
coming back, one-two-three, you’re almost there now. Take a deep breath, 
four and five, eyes open, wide awake. Good job, well done you.
Applause
I get all the love.
Laughter
Does that seem difficult to do? I don’t care what you do afterwards, all I care 
about is you do the same stuff you did a moment ago, only this time as you’re 
guiding them forwards you just say the word sleep, that’s it. They, of course, 
will pretend to go into trance for the moment and we’ll start elaborating and 
refining as we go on.
Right now I just want you to get used to that as a dynamic. Does that make 
sense? Any questions? Off you go, thank you very much. –Exercise- This is 
way too easy isn’t it?
Yes.
Good. Is anyone struggling with this so far, it should be pretty 
straightforward? 
Here’s what we’re going to do now, we’re going to start on the same thing but 
we’re going to get a little more hypnotic. 
(Can I borrow you for a moment, since you’re close?) So, you have the same 
setup. Behind their shoulders, take a step forward please, look at me, take a 
deep breath in, breathe out and sleep, all the way. That’s right.
At this point, I just wanted to add some simple language. Let’s go deeper, 
deeper, deeper, that’s right, deeper, that’s right, deeper. Is my language 
particularly complex right now? 
Laughter

In a moment I’ll count from one to five and on the count of five you’ll come 
back refreshed, alert, simply fantastic. 
One, coming up slowly
Two, a little bit more now
Three, feeling revitalized, refreshed
Four, getting ready to meet your new day
Five, coming back as a full powerful hypnotist ready to rock n’ roll
Applause
Is that easy so far? 
Yes.
Put your hands up if you have a question.
Real quick, I noticed when you’re cupping behind the head that you tap 
sometimes, but you didn’t mention that.
Don’t worry about the tapping yet, we’ll come to that. It’s hypno-tapping. 
Would it be normal to be a little bit nervous doing the rapid induction?
Sure, until you get used to it. Here’s the thing, if you’re not trying to achieve 
anything how will you get nervous? You’re not looking for results yet and yes, 
in the real world, until you get used to it you’ll be a little nervous and then 
you’ll start doing it.
For now, just treat it like going to a weird gym, like hold the exercise machine 
like this and pull the lever forward. Then push it back and hope for results, 
just think about those pure mechanics don’t think about hypnosis or anything 
else like that and it should take care of that for now. By the time you actually 
get to do the real hypnosis it’ll be easy.
Is that okay? Very good. Any other questions or comments? No, all right can I 
borrow you for a second. Then the other thing I want you to focus on…you’ve 
done the whole sleep thing, I know the complex language deeper, deeper, 
deeper…whilst they’re here what I want you to do is feel the shoulder and the 
back of their neck for how relaxed they are.
(Tense up a second) Do you see the tension here? If I step away, do you see 
how he stands on his own? (Now relax, all the way, that’s it). Now, you can 
already see his shoulders relaxing a little bit. If I start stepping away, do you 
see how his body follows me? I can feel the weight on me, does that make 
sense?

Every time he starts relaxing a bit more or puts his weight a bit more on top of 
your shoulders so you can feel it, just say something like that’s right, 
encourage him or say you’re doing great, something along those lines. What 
you’re looking for is the whole mechanics we had there, but notice where the 
relaxation is.
If they’re really tense, don’t worry about it. If they’re really relaxed that’s fine 
too. We’re not looking for it all we want you to do is to spot what’s actually 
happening. Does that make sense? 
This means you should do this with as many different people as possible, 
because every one will be different and what you need right now is a variety 
of experience. So don’t elaborate these things, take no more then 30 
seconds, move on to someone else and so on, you’re really better served 
with a lot of practice rather than spending a long time with one person.
I want you to be aware of one thing. When he’s talking about the relaxation, 
there will be times when you’re doing this with somebody and they’re so 
relaxed that they’re going to fall to the ground. It’s up to you to make sure you 
take care of them at all times.
So, if you have somebody and you see them start to collapse or feel them 
start to collapse, you want to take control, make sure they’re not going to fall 
and tell them your legs are stiff and rigid. I’m telling you it will happen.
So just look out for it for now. A moment again, notice to what levels you get. 
You shouldn’t be getting to that extreme just yet, but soon you will be so keep 
that in the back of your minds as an idea.
All right, off you go.
Was that easy?
Yes!
Remember, you are the show. The energy you bring to this is how your show 
will be, so I strongly encourage you to train that getting excited muscle if you 
want the audience to be that way as well. It’s just part of how it is. I don’t 
mind, we’re going to do a good job whichever way it goes.
But this is for you to train your whole state and personality, remember that’s 
part of what you’re doing here. 
Who felt different levels of relaxation with different people? Who felt that 
when you said something like that’s right, you’re doing great or deeper, at the 
right time the relaxation increased? Guess what, that makes you a hypnotist. 
Seriously!

Relaxation isn’t the only way to hypnotize it’s just one of the simpler pathways 
into it. Does that make sense? We’ll cover lots of other ways of doing it in 
time too, but this is a very useful way of looking at it.
What I want you to do now is the same thing; we’re just going to add a few 
nuances, will that be okay?
Yes.
Can I borrow you, seeing that you’re close.
We have Merrick right here; we’ll do the same drill. Take a step forward or 
just take a step back. Look at me. Take a deep breath in and sleep all the 
way, that’s right. Deeper, deeper, deeper, that’s right deeper still, very good. 
What I want you to do here as he’s there going deeper into trance, I want you 
to test and feel for his balance just by slightly rocking backwards and 
forwards. Notice how much balance you have and if there’s not enough just 
lift him up a little bit until you’re balanced. 
If there’s not enough, you see how he doesn’t rock with me, I just say that’s it 
just let me have it. That’s it, a little more, that’s it there you go. So you’re 
going to encourage him to give you his balance. If he trusts you with his 
balance, chances are he’ll trust you with whatever internal process is going 
on too. 
This is just a starting point. Now, coming back 1-2-3-4-5 rock n’ roll, good job 
well done.
Applause
One last thing, in terms of what you do with the head be gentle. If you’re 
going to do more of a shocking thing, you have two choices. 
1. Do it a-la the master whom you’ll see doing it very shortly. It’s just, 
take the hand on the shoulder, the shoulder can take more force then 
the head can. But again, don’t be jerking too hard.
This is my preference, especially when you’re working with more fragile 
people. 
2. Take one of your fingers and just have the cup of the hand there for 
stability, but only one finger does the pushing. So literally, if this is his 
head I’m just letting one finger do the tapping, because one finger 
won’t have that much power in it to wrench his neck out of proportion.

You do not want to be going sleep and the head goes rolling down the other 
end of the aisle and their body collapses in a spurt of blood, that’s a lawsuit 
waiting to happen, so you probably don’t want to have that. 
So we added two things. First, we’re putting a little more shock into the 
system. The simple way to do that is when you cup, just use your index, 
middle or ring finger to tap forward slightly and if he resists that’s no problem, 
you see how he’s resisting, there’s still a little bit of shock so you can still go 
from here and gently carry on guiding with the whole hand. It is not a yank 
with the whole hand.
Have I emphasized this one enough?
Yes.
What is it not?
It’s not using the whole hand.
What is it?
It’s a finger.
I have a question with regards to their style, like usually when I do this I sync 
with my object and then I go slow, but I can’t be really forceful.
Pretend for a moment that you are. Imagine one of these guys here who’s 
done it with you. Who here is okay with just being a bit more forceful, excited 
and so on? Grab her and everyone focus on her until she gets it. You’ll get it 
very soon. And then, all you have to do is be like them. Once you’ve had it a 
few times you’ll go oh, that’s easy I can do that.
For now we’re still working with mechanics, so the key here is you have all 
this stuff here. Hand cupped, little tip for a little shock, guide them in and say 
the word sleep, then the rest and you’ll be looking for the balance. Simple, 
easy, off you go. 
How are you doing, are you having fun?
Yes! Applause
Okay, now we’re getting somewhere. These are just the core mechanics of 
an instant induction. Next we’re going to look into exactly what’s going on 
here, the dynamics you’re looking for, so that every time you do it you can tell 
is this work or is it not so you know how to troubleshoot and fix it.

So next we’ll look at the mental dynamics behind the physical mechanics 
we’ve just been doing. Then we’re going to start drilling this in with variations 
so you have lots of different exciting instant inductions that make people go 
oh, that guy’s amazing. 
In fact, my aim is that by lunchtime you can do such good hypnosis that when 
you go out there, there are lots of conferences going on, have you seen this. 
Do I need say anything more? That’s my aim for lunchtime is that a good 
aim?
