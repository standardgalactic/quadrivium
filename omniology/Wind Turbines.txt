Preface
Preface
This book is concerned with the subject of Wind Energy, as a source of clean and renewable and free 
for all. The need for this type of book is very well documented, the current consumption of energy is 
unsustainable and humans have to change their habits and or utilise this source, but there is so much 
work before we can rely completely on renewable energy. This book aims to describe the fundamentals 
of wind energy and the pertinent parameters that control the amount of energy available from a given 
wind turbine.
Coal fuelled the industrial revolution in the 18th and 19th century. It remained as the prime fuel 
supplying steam engines used in road vehicles and rail road trucks. The industrialised nations were 
in huge competition in their search for additional fuels and the discovery of oil in the Middle East 
and elsewhere extended the use oil opening the applications to a wider range. With the advent of the 
automobile, airplanes and the spreading use of electricity, oil became the dominant fuel during the 
twentieth century. The Arab-Israeli wars in the 1967 and 1972; the price of oil increased from 5 to 45 
US dollars per barrel, there was a shift away from oil. Coal and nuclear became the fuels of choice for 
electricity generation and conservation measures increased energy efficiency. The use of fossil fuels has 
continued to grow and their share of the energy supply has increased. The more recent invasion of Iran, 
and subsequently Kuwait and the eventual occupation of Iraq are all clear evidence of the importance 
of oil to the west.
In 2008, total worldwide energy consumption was 474 exajoules (474×1018 J) with 80 to 90 percent 
derived from the combustion of fossil fuels.
The estimates of remaining non-renewable worldwide energy resources vary, with the remaining fossil 
fuels totaling an estimated 400000 EJ (- - and the available nuclear fuel such as uranium 
exceeding 2500000 EJ. The Sun, provides the world with a renewable usable energy of 3800000 EJ/yr, 
dwarfing all non-renewable resources. However, it is there to be utilised. The sun energy needs to be 
harnessed, stored, and converted into the required form for a particular use. Whatever fossil fuel remains 
will be more and more difficult to mine, and as it become scarcer the security of supply will become 
a major issue, with the definite outcome that the cost will exponentially increase and that would lead 
ultimately to major quarrels and possibly wars.
In order to move away from fossil fuels it is expected to create economic pressure through Carbon trading 
and Green taxation. Some countries are taking action as a result of the Kyoto Protocol, and further steps 
in this direction are proposed. For example, the European Union Commission has proposed that the 
Energy Policy should set a binding target of increasing the level of renewable energy in the EU’s overall 
mix from less than 7% today to 20% by 2020.

Preface
Wind Energy is natural and renewable, wind turbines are similar to hydraulic turbines, hence the 
technology is mature and well establish. What is good about wind energy, its available even in winter, 
when solar energy is not so good, so it makes a natural compliment to solar energy.
Wind energy is becoming popular despite some concerns about visual impact and so on, and it is one of 
the most competitive renewable energy in most cases. According to the World Wind Energy Association, 
the installed capacity of wind power increased by 29% from the end of 2007 to the end of 2008 to total 
121 GW, with over half the increase in the United States, Spain and China.
This book tackles the fundamental principles of wind energy; and how it can be harnessed and used 
efficiently. A case study is provided at the end of the book to demonstrate how best to evaluate the wind 
energy potential for a locality, plan, select the best wind turbine for that particular application, and use 
wind energy.

Dimensions and units
Dimensions and units
Any physical situation, whether it involves a single object or a complete system, can be described in terms 
of a number of recognisable properties which the object or system possesses. For example, a moving 
object could be described in terms of its mass, length, area or volume, velocity and acceleration. Its 
temperature or electrical properties might also be of interest, while other properties – such as density 
and viscosity of the medium through which it moves – would also be of importance, since they would 
affect its motion. These measurable properties used to describe the physical state of the body or system 
are known as its variables, some of which are basic such as length and time, others are derived such 
as velocity. Each variable has units to describe the magnitude of that quantity. Lengths in SI units are 
described in units of meters. The meter is the unit of the dimension of length (L); hence the area will 
have dimension of L2, and volume L3. Time will have units of seconds (T), hence velocity is a derived 
quantity with dimensions of (LT-1) and units of meter per second. A list of some variables is given in 
Table 1 with their units and dimensions.
Definitions of Some Basic SI Units
Mass:	 	
The kilogram is the mass of a platinum-iridium cylinder kept at Sevres in France.
Length:		
The metre is now defined as being equal to 1 650 763.73 wavelengths in vacuum of the 
orange line emitted by the Krypton-86 atom.
Time:	 	
The second is defined as the fraction 1/31 556 925.975 of the tropical year for 1900. 
The second is also declared to be the interval occupied by 9 192 631 770 cycles of the 
radiation of the caesium atom corresponding to the transition between two closely 
spaced ground state energy levels.
Temperature:	
The Kelvin is the degree interval on the thermodynamic scale on which the temperature 
of the triple point of water is 273.16 K exactly. (The temperature of the ice point is 
273.15 K).
Definitions of Some Derived SI Units
Force:
The Newton is that force which, when acting on a mass of one kilogram gives it an acceleration of one 
metre per second per second.
Work Energy, and Heat:
The joule is the work done by a force of one Newton when its point of application is moved through a 
distance of one metre in the direction of the force. The same unit is used for the measurement of every 
kind of energy including quantity of heat.

The Newton metre, the joule and the watt second are identical in value. It is recommended that the 
Newton is kept of the measurement of torque or moment and the joule or watt second is used for 
quantities of work or energy.

Energy & the Environment
1	 Energy & the Environment
1.1	
Introduction
Energy is needed for two functions:
a)	 To provide heating, cooking and processing of fluids
b)	 To provide electricity to drive machines, or power lights.
The following sections will discuss the various forms of energy, and how energy can be converted from 
one form to another which convenient for heating, cooling etc.
1.2	
Forms of energy
We associate energy with devices whose inputs are fuel based such as electrical current, coal, oil or 
natural gas; resulting in outputs such as movement, heat or light.
Unit of energy is the Joule (J). The rate of producing energy is POWER which has the unit of Joule per 
second or the Watt (W).

Mechanical energy
There are FIVE forms of Energy:
• Mechanical Energy
• Electrical Energy
• Chemical Energy
• Nuclear Energy
• Thermal Energy
These energy forms are discussed in the following sections.
1.2.1	
Mechanical energy
This type of energy is associated with the ability to perform physical work.
There are two forms in which this energy is found; namely potential energy and kinetic energy.
Potential energy
As the name implies is contained in a body due to its height above its surroundings, examples such as 
the gravitational energy of the water behind a dam, and the energy stored in batteries.
Potential Energy = mass × acceleration due to gravity (9.81) × height above datum
 Ep = m × g × h
The energy produced by one kilogram of water falling from a height of 100m above ground is a potential 
energy, which can be calculated as follows:
Potential Energy = mass × acceleration due to gravity × height above datum
Ep	
= 1 × 9.81 × 100	
	
= 981 J/kg

Mechanical energy
Kinetic energy
Kinetic energy is related to the movement of the body in question. Examples of KE such as the flywheel 
effect and the energy of water flowing in a stream.
Kinetic Energy = ½ mass × velocity squared
Ek = ½ × m × v2
The water stream in a river flowing at a velocity of 2 m/s has a kinetic energy of:
Kinetic Energy = ½ mass × velocity squared = ½ × 1 × (2)2 = 2 J/kg

Electrical energy
1.2.2	
Electrical energy
This type of energy as the name implies is associated with the electrons of materials. Electrical energy 
exists in two forms:
a)	 Electrostatic electricity
This type of electrical energy is produced by the accumulation of charge on the plates of a 
capacitor. Charles Coulomb first described electric field strengths in the 1780s. He found that 
for point charges, the electrical force varies directly with the product of the charges. The greater 
the charges, the stronger the field. And the field varies inversely with the square of the distance 
between the charges. This means that the greater the distance, the weaker the force becomes. 
The formula for electrostatic force, F, is given as:
F = k (q1 × q2) / d2
Where q1 and q2 are the charges, d is the distance between the charges. And k is the 
proportionality constant which depend on the material separating the charges.
b)	 Electromagnetic energy
This type is produced with a combination of magnetic and electric forces. It exists as a continuous 
spectrum of radiation. The most useful type of electromagnetic energy comes in the form of 
solar radiation transmitted by the sun that forms the basis of all terrestrial life.

Chemical energy
1.2.3	
Chemical energy
This type of is associated with the release of thermal energy due to a chemical reaction of certain 
substances with oxygen. Burning wood, coal or gas is the main source of energy we commonly use in 
heating and cooking.
Calculation of chemical energy
The energy liberated from the combustion of a given mass of fuel, with a known calorific value in a 
combustion chamber of known efficiency is given by:
Chemical Energy = Mass of fuel × calorific value × efficiency of combustion
1.2.4	
Nuclear energy
This energy is stored in the nucleus of matter, and is released as a result of interactions within the atomic 
nucleus.
There are three nuclear reactions:
a)	 Radioactive decay:
In which one unstable nucleus (radioisotope) decays into a more stable configuration resulting 
in the release of matter and energy

Nuclear energy
b)	 Fission:
A heavy nucleus absorbs a neutron splitting it into two or more nuclei accompanied by a release 
of energy. Uranium U235 has the ability to produce 70×109 J/kg
Einstein proposed the following equation to calculate the energy produced from nuclear 
fissioning (i.e. conversion of matter (m) into energy, E are related to the speed of light C):
E = m C2
This reaction forms the bases for current nuclear power generation plants.
c)	 Fusion:
Two light nuclei combine to produce a more stable configuration accompanied by the release  
of energy. Heavy water (Deuterium) fusion reaction may produce energy at the rate of  
0.35×1012 J/kg.
This reaction is yet to be realised to produce electricity on commercial basis.

Thermal energy
1.2.5	
Thermal energy
Thermal energy is associated with intermolecular vibration resulting in heat and a temperature rise above 
that of the surroundings. Thermal energy is calculated for two different regimes:
When the substance in a pure phase, say if it is in a liquid, gas or solid, then
Thermal Energy = mass × specific heat capacity × temperature difference
During a change of phase, such as evaporation or condensation, it can be calculated by:
Thermal Energy = mass × latent heat
However, if there is a change of phase, say during the condensation of water vapour into liquid, there 
is an additional amount of heat released while the temperature remains constant during the change of 
phase. For 1 kg of water to be heated at ambient pressure from 20 to 120 oC, the requirement is
Thermal energy = heating water (20–100) oC + evaporation at 100 oC + super-heating vapour (100–120) oC
Thermal energy 	
= 1x 4.219 × (100-20) + 1x2256.7 + 1x2.01x(120-100)
= 337.52 + 2256.7 + 40.2
= 2634.42 kJ
1.3	
Energy conversion
It is important to understand that losses are encountered during the transformation of energy during the 
different conversions into the final form for a given application, for example consider a wind turbine, 
the following conversions take place:
Kinetic energy of the oncoming air strikes the rotor blades, turning them, and hence the axial kinetic 
energy is turned into mechanical energy of the rotating blades.

Energy conversion
Some of this mechanical energy is lost in the control mechanism, consisting of the gear box and brake 
to regulate the speed and match it with that of the generator. Some energy losses are encountered due 
to friction.
The shaft turning with the remaining energy will rotate in turn the generator; hence converting it’s the 
output into electrical energy (mechanical to electrical).
Some losses are dissipated through the mechanical connections between the turbine and the electrical 
generator.
Electricity is used by customers for lighting / heating or to operate electric devices such as radio, television, 
etc. electrical devices are designed to operate on an optimum condition; efficiency of the operation will 
vary depending on its use, age and maintenance.

Energy conversion
The energy flow for a typical wind turbine is shown in Figure 1.1; can be analysed in a simple way by 
considering the energy flow diagram, which may look like this:
100 units of energy are stored in the incoming air as kinetic energy.
40 units are converted into rotational /mechanical energy by the blades.
35 units are transferred by the shaft; some units are absorbed by the brake and gear.
33 units are converted from mechanical into electrical energy in the electrical generator.
30 units is the net output, as 3 units are lost in voltage conversion, storage and distribution.
The final figure depends on many factors, including the type of turbine, efficiency of the control system, 
efficiency of the generator, and the quality of the transformer and the distribution system.

Environmental Impact from fossil fuels
Coal, Oil and Natural gas have their relative merits in terms of availability, price and thermal performance. 
Table 1.3 below is constructed for comparison of the heat capacity, CO2 and SO2 production by the three 
fossil fuels. The 4th column is of particular importance in comparing all three fuels; it represents the 
quantity of carbon dioxide emitted for every unit of energy produced.
Coal produces the highest amount of Carbon dioxide for a given output of energy; then oil, then Natural 
gas which produces nearly half the emission of coal and a third less than that of oil.
The results displayed in table 1.3 for the production of CO­2 mass per unit energy compares well with 
data published by the UK government, Action on Energy, the values found in this chapter are lower 
than those quoted in the reference, the difference is that the calculations shown in this chapter were 
only concerned with the combustion process itself; there other knock on effect in the calculations when 
the life cycle of the fuel is considered, hence the addition of energy used to transport, process the fuel, 
and to include distribution losses.

Energy world-wide
The consumption of energy by humankind has evolved over the ages. It began with the invention of fire, 
man relied on wood burning to cook and to provide warmth and light for millions of years. As civilisation 
evolved, the needs for energy became greater and other sources were sought. In the long search, man 
discovered coal. Over the years coal provided much greater resource for energy, encouraging man to 
push its use into further applications.
A major leap in the nineteenth century was achieved by the discovery of oil in the Middle East. This 
unfortunate discovery eventually led to TWO World wars as the leading industrial nations attempted 
to dominate the world market and to secure the energy supply for their huge manufacturing industries.

Energy world-wide
The oil crises due to the Arab-Israeli war in 1973 resulted in tripling of oil prices, this was a major shock 
for non producing countries, particularly in Europe, on one hand it has put tremendous increase on the 
energy consumer’s budget;
The discovery of oil pushed the competition for manufacturing beyond the industrialised countries own 
borders. This competition for shares in the exports market put so much strain on the consumption of 
fossil fuel. Hubbert put foreword his caution when he published his famous curve (1956), Figure 1.2. I t 
is clear that the oil reserves of the world are consumed unsustainably and will be exhausted within this 
century. Humans have to find a new source or sources of energy to replace oil.
However, on the positive side, the depletion of oil can be considered as a major advantage to humankind 
and the environment, it will force consumers to reduce the excessive consumption of energy, it will help 
man to review manufacturing processes and attempt to increase energy efficiency, and probably it has 
already pushed governments to search for newer sources of energy. Substantial funds are allocated for 
the research into renewable resources such as Hydropower, wind turbines and solar energy.
Energy consumption world-wide has continued to rise, it is estimated that in 1900, the world consumption 
was around 22 EJ and by 1960 it rose to 128 EJ; this reached 564 EJ in 2000.
The continued increase in population and the associated increase in manufacturing industry to cater for 
greater dependence of man on energy driven devices and the culture of multi-car ownership has put even 
greater importance for energy. It is interesting to note that the energy consumption for individuals have 
increased by 10 folds over the century mentioned above. This is another proof that we are becoming too 
excessive and becoming too dependant on energy far greater than we did before.

Introduction
Figure 2.1 Wind Power developments  
Courtesy of – http://www.wwindea.org/
According to BWEA, the British Wind Energy Authority, in the UK currently there are 2896 large Wind 
turbines with installed capacity of 4532 MW, sufficient to supply over 2.5 million homes (based on annual 
household energy consumption of 4.7 MWh).
Much attention has been paid recently to Renewables as a potential source of fuel. The rising oil price 
and the logistics in supplying fossil fuel to remote areas are the main drive to Renewables as well as 
the environmental incentive. In remote locations, stand-alone Renewable energy systems can be more 
cost-effective than extending a power line to the electricity grid. In addition, the environmental benefits 
under the current international concerns on global warming makes such project much more valuable 
and rewarding.
The growth of renewable energy sources also stimulates employment, the creation of new technologies 
and new skills.

Introduction
The new Directive on renewable energy sets ambitious targets for all Member States, such that the EU 
will reach a 20% share of energy from renewable sources by 2020 and a 10% share of renewable energy 
specifically in the transport sector. It also improves the legal framework for promoting renewable 
electricity, requires national action plans that establish pathways for the development of renewable energy 
sources including bioenergy, creates cooperation mechanisms to help achieve the targets cost effectively 
and establishes the sustainability criteria for Biofuels. The new Directive should be implemented by 
Member States by early in 2010.
In a recent statement, Ed Miliband, UK Secretary of State for Energy and Climate change he spelled out 
the government strategy:
“Transforming the country into a cleaner, greener and more prosperous place to live is at the heart of 
our economic plans for ‘building Britain’s future’ and ensuring the UK is ready to take advantage of the 
opportunities ahead”.

Siting of Wind turbines
By 2020:
• More than 1.2 million people will be in green jobs.
• 7 million homes will have benefited from whole house makeovers, and more than 1.5 
million households will be supported to produce their own clean energy.
• Around 40 percent of electricity will be from low-carbon sources, from Renewables, nuclear 
and clean coal.
• We will be importing half the amount of gas that we otherwise would.
• The average new car will emit 40 percent less carbon than now.
2.2	
Siting of Wind turbines
The placement or “siting” of wind systems is extremely important. In order for a wind turbine system to 
be effective, a relatively consistent wind-flow is required. Obstructions such as trees or hills can interfere 
with the rotors. Because of this, the rotors are usually placed on towers to take advantage of the stronger 
winds available higher up. Furthermore, wind speed varies with temperature, season, and time of day. 
All these factors must be considered when choosing a site for a wind-powered generator.
The amount of Wind Energy available at any location depends on two sets of factors:
a)	 Climatic factors including: Time of day, Season, Geographic location, Topography, and Local 
weather.
b)	 Mechanical factors including: Diameter of rotor, and Type of Turbine
Utility-scale wind farms must have access to transmission lines to transport energy. The wind farm 
developer may be obligated to install extra equipment or control systems in the wind farm to meet the 
technical standards set by the operator of a transmission line.

Planning Constraints for wind turbines:
2.3	
Planning Constraints for wind turbines:
There is a number of planning related issues that may make it difficult for you to install a turbine on your 
site and it would be wise to ensure that you are not going to fall foul of any of these before proceeding.
• Military installations.
Avoid these installations, especially if it is an air force base or communication centres.
• Proximity to built-up area.
When housing estates are concerned, ideally consider a distance of at least 200m–300m 
depending on the size of the turbine.
• Designated areas or listed buildings.
National Parks or Areas of Outstanding Natural Beauty are more difficult to satisfy the local 
planning officer to install a wind turbine on it or near it.
2.3.1	
Steps to Planning and Building a Wind Farm
There are many stages of development before a wind turbine/farm can be approved and built. Once a 
site has been selected for its good overall potential, work begins on several main tasks:
• Consultation with the local authority
It is extremely important to contact the local authority in the area where the turbine is 
considered before committing any time or costs. Engage them early in the planning process, 
answer any questions and/or concerns that they might have, and keep an open dialogue with 
them throughout the whole development.
• Consultation with the Public near the site
The local community who are likely to be affected by the proposal must be met to present 
the project, solicit their feedback and seek their support. An advertisement in the local paper 
would be a good idea to inform the general public and invite them for a discussion and debate.
• Land acquisition
Early in the process, developers, if not already the owners themselves usually approach 
landowners to negotiate “option” agreements to use their land. As the project progresses, the 
developer will seek to convert the options into firm land lease agreements.
• Wind Assessment
Another very important step is assessing the wind resource. Scientists and engineers use 
meteorological masts to measure wind speed and other climatic conditions for at least one year. 
This data is then used to estimate how much energy the wind farm will produce. It is often 
assumed that this has to be carried out before any serious consideration is planned.

Steps to Planning and Building a Wind Farm
• Wind Farm Design
This is important if the project is a wind farm, Wind data is combined with topographical 
information to design the wind farm. Engineers use this data to model wind flow, turbine 
performance, sound levels and other parameters to optimize the location of the wind turbines. 
They also design the access roads, turbine foundations and local electric network, as well as 
the connection to the electricity grid.
Figure 2.3 Wind farm optimal placement
• Environmental Impact Assessment
Environmental assessments are conducted to identify any impacts on landscape, plants and 
wildlife, soil and water, land use or other activities such as aviation and telecommunications. 
If negative impacts are identified, the design is adjusted to avoid or mitigate them.

Steps to Planning and Building a Wind Farm
• Economic and Financial evaluation
To prove the economic viability of the project in order to raise the funds to build the wind 
farm. On one hand, there is a need to estimate the cost of turbines and their installation, as 
well as roads, electrical system, operation and maintenance, etc. On the other hand, there is 
a need to estimate the income from the energy production of the wind farm over the lifetime 
of the project. If there is a net profit, the project has a chance to succeed.
• Site Preparation
Build access roads and clear the areas where turbines will be erected; then prepare the 
foundations; do the excavating, followed by installing the formworks and pouring concrete.
• Construction
The wind turbine parts are manufactured and pre-assembled into the main components at 
the factory then shipped to the wind farm site where the final assembly will take place. When 
all components have been received, the assembly can take place. A crane is used to erect the 
tower and install the nacelle and rotor with its hub and blades. On the ground, the electrical 
collection network is installed and connected to the grid through the substation.
• Commissioning
Finally, the wind turbine is tested, all components are calibrated on site and verified against 
the suppliers specifications, before becoming fully operational.

Wind Energy and the Environment
In this section, both the positive and negative aspects of wind energy will be discussed.
2.4.1	
Positive environmental benefits of Wind energy
It must be stressed that wind energy involves no combustion or nuclear reaction, so it is pollution free. 
It is renewable and plentiful and free, and what is more it is available everywhere, especially in remote 
areas and often it is windier in mountains and near costal areas. There are significant environmental 
benefits obtained from using a renewable energy device attributed to preventing the release of Green 
house gases associated with fossil fuels. The general equation for estimating the reduction in emitted gas is:
Gas-emission reduction (in tonnes) = A × 0.8 × h × kG
Where
A	
is the rated capacity of the development in kW
h	
is the number of operational hours per year, = 8000 h
kG	
is the specific emitted gas constant.
Hence the following equations are used to predict environmental benefits from based on 1 kWe system:
CO2 emission reduction (in tonnes) 	
= 1x0.8x8000x862/106
= 5.5
SO2 emission reduction (in tonnes) 	
= 1x0.8x8000x9.9/106
= 0.063
NO2 emission reduction (in tonnes) 	
= 1x0.8x8000x862/106
= 0.018

Negative Impacts of Wind energy

Negative Impacts of Wind energy
These issues are often raised, some are valid, some are opinion driven, and others could be due to 
personal preferences or biasness.
a)	 Noise
Wind turbines rely on the movement of the rotor affected by wind to rotate the generator and 
make electricity. Virtually everything with moving parts will make some sound, and wind 
turbines are no exception. Turbines are an established and well developed technology, and well 
designed wind turbines are generally quiet in operation, and compared to the noise of road 
traffic, trains, aircraft and construction activities, the noise from wind turbines is relatively 
low. Outside the nearest houses, which are at least half a mile away, and more often further, 
the sound of a wind turbine generating electricity is likely to be about the same level as noise 
of leaves rustling in a gentle breeze. This is similar to the sound level inside a typical living 
room with a gas fire switched on, or the reading room of a library or in an unoccupied, quiet, 
air-conditioned office.

Table 2.1 Comparative noise levels
There are two potential sources of noise related to wind turbines: the turbine blades passing 
through the air as the hub rotates, and the gearbox and generator in the nacelle. Noise from 
the blades is minimised by careful attention to the design and manufacture of the blades. The 
noise from the gearbox and generator is contained within the nacelle by sound insulation and 
isolation materials.
Preliminary recommendations from the Wind Turbine Noise Working Group, established by 
the DTI in the UK, are that turbine noise level should be kept to within 5 dB(A) of the average 
existing evening or night-time background noise level. A fixed low level of between 35 and 40 
dB(A) may be specified when background noise is very low, ie. Less than 30 dB(A).

b)	 Bird-kill
This is a very emotionally charged subject. Bird conservationists tend to view wind turbines as 
death machines and refer to bloody bird corpses lying at the foot of turbine towers and entire 
species migrating from the areas surrounding wind farms.
Birds occasionally collide with wind turbines, as they do with other tall structures such as 
buildings. Detailed studies and monitoring following construction, at wind development areas 
indicate that this is a site-specific issue that will not be a problem at most potential wind sites. 
Also, wind’s overall impact on birds is low compared with other human-related sources of 
avian mortality. See Figure 2.4.

Negative Impacts of Wind energy
c)	 Visual impacts
Wind turbines are just normal structures to look at, just like trees, better looking than boiler 
chimneys.
In comparison to other energy developments, such as nuclear, coal and gas power stations or 
open cast coal mining, wind farms have relatively little visual impact. Wind farm developers 
recognise that visual impact can be a concern for neighbouring communities. Considerable effort 
is therefore committed to the planning stages in order to reduce the impact and gain their consent.
A number of national wind energy associations have established detailed best practice guidelines 
for the development of wind farms, including their visual impact.
Surveys of public opinion show that most people who live near wind developments find them 
less intrusive once they are operating than they might have feared beforehand. Other surveys, 
for instance in Scotland, have shown that there is no evidence that tourism is seriously affected 
by the presence of wind farms. The authors experience is the opposite to that, I found myself 
going to places never thought I would, for the simple reason to see how the wind turbines 
work and enjoy the view of clean energy machine.
Although a wind energy project can spread across a large total land area, it does not occupy all 
that space. Farming or leisure activities can still continue around the turbines. The European 
Wind Energy Association has estimated that the number of wind farms required to contribute 
20% of Europe’s electricity supply would take up only a few hundred square kilometres.
d)	 Shadow Flicker
is occasionally raised as an issue by some people. A wind turbine’s moving blades can cast a 
moving shadow on a nearby residence, depending on the time of the year (which determines 
how low the sun is in the sky) and time of day. It is possible to calculate very precisely whether a 
flickering shadow will in fact fall on a given location near a wind farm, and how many hours in 
a year it will do so. Therefore, it should be easy to determine whether this is a potential problem.
e)	 Communication interference
Wind turbines, like all structures, can interfere with communication or radar signals when these 
signals are interrupted by the turbine structure or the rotor plane. Wind turbines can sometimes 
cause electromagnetic interference affecting TV and radio reception. Electromagnetic interference 
can be caused by near-field effects, diffraction, or reflection and scattering. Such interference can 
typically be mitigated by using satellite TV or wireless cable TV. Although instances of TV or 
radio interference are infrequent and typically straightforward to mitigate, the interaction of wind 
turbines and navigational or defence radar signals is the subject of considerable recent attention.

Negative Impacts of Wind energy
A number of tools and practices are available to manage or mitigate the potential impact of wind turbine 
interference:
• Farm layout optimization, terrain masking, or reduction of the radar cross-section area may 
be sufficient to address identified interference problems.
• Coating equipment with absorbent or reflective materials to minimize the turbine’s radar 
signature.
• Often the easiest and least costly approaches involve software optimization. Other options 
include installing post-processors or adding hardware (such as processors, transmitters, 
or receivers). When such changes alone are insufficient, more involved approaches can 
sometimes be implemented. These include deploying extra radars to cover the shadow spots, 
relocating radar installations to accommodate the new wind farms, or altering air traffic 
routes around new wind farms.
Even with these mitigation methods, there will be some proposed locations where wind turbines will 
cause disruptive radar interference. In such cases, wind projects would likely be unable to proceed at 
the proposed site.

Theory of Wind Energy
3	 Theory of Wind Energy
The principles concerned with converting the potential energy of fluids into useful power relies on three 
basic fundamentals: conservation of mass, energy and momentum, so it is useful to discuss these before 
examining the operation of wind turbines.
3.1	
Conservation of Mass:
The continuity equation applies the principle of conservation of mass to fluid flow. Consider a fluid 
flowing through a fixed conduit having one inlet and one outlet as shown in Figure 3.1
Figure 3.1 Conservation of mass of a fluid flowing in a duct/pipe
If the flow is steady i.e no accumulation of fluid within the control volume, then the rate of fluid flow 
at entry must be equal to the rate of fluid flow at exit for mass conservation. If the flow cross-sectional 
area A (m2), and the fluid parcel travels a distance dL in time dt, then the volume flow rate (Vf, m3/s) 
is given by:
GW

G/

$
9I  
but since dL/dt is the fluid velocity (V, m/s) we can write: Vf = V × A
The mass flow rate (m, kg/s) is given by the product of density and volume flow rate. Between any two 
points within the control volume, the fluid mass flow rate can be shown to remain constant:

Conservation of Energy:
3.2	
Conservation of Energy:
Conservation of energy necessitates that the total energy of the fluid remains constant, however, there 
can be transformation from one form to another.
There are three forms of non-thermal energy for a fluid at any given point:-
The kinetic energy due to the motion of the fluid.
The potential energy due to the positional elevation above a datum.
The pressure energy, due to the absolute pressure of the fluid at that point.
If all energy terms are written in the form of the head (potential energy), ie in metres of the fluid, then 
conservation of energy principle requires that:

Conservation of Momentum
Consider a duct of length L, cross-sectional area Ac, surface area As, in which a fluid of densityr, is 
flowing at mean velocity V. The forces acting on a segment of the duct are that due to pressure difference 
and that due to friction at the walls in contact with the fluid.
If the acceleration of the fluid is zero, the net forces acting on the element must be zero, hence
(p1 – p2). Ac – (f r V2/2). As= 0
or	
	
p1 – p2 = r g hf
where 	 	
hf = f. (As/Ac). V2/2g
For a pipe 	
As/Ac = p D L /p D2/4 = 4L/D
hence	 	
hf = (4 fL/D). V2/2g
(3)
This is known as Darcy formula.
The value of the friction factor (f) depends mainly on two parameters namely the value of the Reynolds 
number and the surface roughness.
The Reynolds number is defined in terms of the density, velocity of flow, diameter and the dynamic viscosity

Ideal Wind Power calculations:
For Re > 2000 and Re < 4000, this region is known as the critical zone and the value of the friction 
factor is certain.
In the turbulent zone, if the surface of the pipe is not perfectly smooth, then the value of the friction 
factor has to be determined from the Moody diagram (see overleaf). The relative roughness is the ratio 
of the average height of the surface projections on the inside of the pipe (k) to the pipe diameter (D). In 
common with Reynolds number and friction factor this parameter is dimensionless.

Ideal Wind Power calculations:
In Theory, Wind power (P) is calculated by the following general equation (the proof for which will be 
derived in the following section):

Where
Cp 	
 is the power coefficient
r	
is the density of the oncoming air
A

V 	
is the velocity of the wind
The actual power is further reduced by two more inefficiencies, due to the gear box losses and the 
generator efficiency.
The value of the ideal power is limited by what is know as Betz coefficient with a value of Cp = 0.59 as 
the highest possible conversion efficiency possible.
In practice, most wind turbines have efficiencies well below 0.5, depending on the type, design and 
operational conditions.
In the operational output range, wind power generated increases with wind speed cubed. In other words, 
at a wind speed of 5 m/s, the power output is proportional with 5 cubed = 125, whereas at a wind speed 
of 10 m/s, the power output is proportional to 1000. This shows that doubling the speed from 5 to  
10 m/s resulted in a power increase of 8 folds. This highlights the importance of location when it comes 
to install wind turbines. The effect of the rotor diameter affect the power output in a square manner, i.e, 
doubling the rotor diameter results in increasing the power output by four times.
On the other hand, since power generated is related to wind speed by a cubic ratio. That means if your 
turbine is rated at producing 1KW at 12m/s then it will produce 125W at 6m/s and 15W at 3m/s.

Theory of Wind Turbines
A windmill extracts power from the wind by slowing down the wind. At stand still, the rotor obviously 
produces no power, and at very high rotational speeds the air is more or less blocked by the rotor, and 
again no power is produced.

The Power produced (Pkin) by the wind turbine is the net kinetic energy change across the wind turbine 
(from initial air velocity of V1 to a turbine exit air velocity of V2) is given as:

Theory of Wind Turbines
The theoretical maximum fraction of the power in the wind which could be extracted by an ideal windmill 
is, therefore the fraction 0.5925 is called the Betz Coefficient. Because of aerodynamic imperfections in 
any practical machine and of mechanical loses, the power extracted is less than that calculated above. 
Figure 3.7 demonstrates the effect of wind turbine design implications on the resulting power that can be 
harnessed from the incoming wind. Efficient wind turbines depend on the production of that optimum 
speed ratio giving the maximum or near the maximum power possible.
Equation 14 clearly shows that:
• The power is proportional to the density (r) of the air which varies slightly with altitude and 
temperature
• The power is proportional to the area (A) swept by the blades and thus to the square of the 
radius (R) of the rotor; and
• the power varies with the cube of the wind speed (V3). This means that the power increases 
eightfold if the wind speed is doubled. Hence, one has to pay particular attention in site 
selection.

Distinction between rated and actual power output of the turbine
3.3.2	
Distinction between rated and actual power output of the turbine
The world’s largest wind turbine generator has a rotor blade diameter of 126 metres and is located on 
offshore, at sea-level and so we know the air density is 1.2 kg/m3. The turbine is rated at 5MW in 30mph 
(14m/s) winds,
Rotor Swept area A	
= (p. 1262)/4 = 12469 m2
Wind Power 	
	
= 0.5 × A x r × V3
		
= 0.5x12469x 1.2 × (14)3 = 20.5 MW
Why is the power of the wind (20MW) so much larger than the rated power of the turbine generator 
(5MW)?
The answer lies in the fact that the Betz limit and inefficiencies in the system seriously absorbs over 60% 
of the apparent power.
There are two further factors to be considered when estimating the power output from a turbine, the 
first is the mechanical transmission and the second is the generator’s efficiency, both of which are less 
than unity, hence the real power is proportionately less than the ideal value.

By 2020, wind could provide one-tenth of our planet’s 
electricity needs. Already today, SKF’s innovative know-
how is crucial to running a large proportion of the 
world’s wind turbines. 
Up to 25 % of the generating costs relate to mainte-
nance. These can be reduced dramatically thanks to our 
systems for on-line condition monitoring and automatic 
lubrication. We help make it more economical to create 
cleaner, cheaper energy out of thin air. 
By sharing our experience, expertise, and creativity, 
industries can boost performance beyond expectations. 
Therefore we need the best employees who can

Wind Turbines types and components
4	 Wind Turbines types and 
components
4.1	
Types of Wind Turbines
There are mainly two types of wind turbine: horizontal axis and vertical axis. The horizontal axis wind 
turbine (HAWT) and the vertical axis wind turbine (VAWT) are classified or differentiated by the axis 
of rotation the rotor shafts.
Horizontal Axis Wind Turbines – Horizontal axis wind turbines, also known as HAWT type turbines 
have a horizontal rotor shaft and an electrical generator which is both located at the top of a tower.
Vertical Axis Wind Turbines – abbreviated as VAWTs, are designed with a vertical rotor shaft, a generator 
and gearbox which are placed at the bottom of the turbine, and a uniquely shaped rotor blade that is 
designed to harvest the power of the wind no matter which direction is it blowing.
The first is the Darrieus wind turbine, which is designed to look like a modified egg beater. These turbines 
have very good efficiency, but poor reliability due to the massive amount of torque which they exert on 
the frame. Furthermore, they also require a small generator to get them started.

Components of a Wind Turbine
Wind turbine usually has six main components: the rotor, the gearbox, the generator, the control and 
protection system, the tower and the foundation. These main components can be seen in figure 4.2.
Figure 4.2 Wind Turbine components 
Courtesy of National Instruments Corporation, USA.
Rotor – The rotor is an elegant aerofoil shaped blades which take the wind and aerodynamically converts 
its kinetic energy into mechanical energy through a connected shaft.
Gearbox – The gearbox alters the rotational velocity of the shaft to suit the generator.
Generator – The generator is a device that produces electricity when mechanical work is given to the 
system.
Control and Protection System – The protection system is like a safety feature that makes sure that the 
turbine will not be working under dangerous condition. This includes a brake system triggered by the 
signal of higher wind speeds to stop the rotor from movement under excessive wind gusts.
Tower – The tower is the main shaft that connects the rotor to the foundation. It also raises the rotor 
high in the air where we can find stronger winds. With horizontal axis wind turbines, the tower houses 
the stairs to allow for maintenance and inspection.
Foundation – The foundation or the base supports the entire wind turbine and make sure that it is well 
fixed onto the ground or the roof for small household wind turbines. This is usually consists of a solid 
concrete assembly around the tower to maintain its structural integrity.

Relationship between Wind speed and Rotor speed
4.3	
Relationship between Wind speed and Rotor speed
The Tip Speed Ratio – (often known as the tsr) is of vital importance in the design of wind turbine 
generators. If the rotor of the wind turbine turns too slowly, most of the wind will pass undisturbed 
through the gap between the rotor blades. Conversely if the rotor turns too quickly, the blurring blades 
will appear like a solid wall to the wind. Therefore, wind turbines are designed with optimal tip speed 
ratios to extract as much power out of the wind as possible.
The optimum tip speed ratio depends on the number of blades in the wind turbine rotor. The fewer 
the number of blades, the faster the wind turbine rotor needs to turn to extract maximum power from 
the wind. A two-bladed rotor has an optimum tip speed ratio of around 6, a three-bladed rotor around 
5, and a four-bladed rotor around 3. Figure 4.4 show some of the common Wind turbines and their 
respective efficiency against tip speed ratio (tsr).

including voltage, current or collectively electrical power, wind turbine rotational speed and the wind 
speed.

The unit of measurement of Power being the Watt (W) with prefixes used to denote milliwatts (mW = 
10-3W) or kilowatts (kW = 103W).
By using Ohm’s law and substituting for V (volts), I (amps) and R (Ω) the formula for electrical power, 
E (watts) can be found as:

Alternating Current Power
But these quantities are continuously varying. Almost always the desired power in an AC circuit is the 
average power, which is given by
Eavg = VI cosφ
(18)
Where φ is the phase angle between the current and the voltage and where V and I are understood to 
be the effective or rms values of the voltage and current, see Figure 5.2. The term cos φ is called the 
“power factor” for the circuit, a power factor of one or “unity power factor” is the goal of any electric 
utility company since if the power factor is less than one, they have to supply more current to the user 
for a given amount of power use. In so doing, they incur more line losses. They also must have larger 
capacity equipment in place than would be otherwise necessary.
Figure 5.2 Resistive AC circuit
The difference between the maximum and minimum values is called peak-to-peak voltage (Vpp) and is 
twice the peak Voltage (Vp). The RMS voltage. (Vrms) is related to the peak voltage as:
Vrms = 0,707 × Vp.
(19)
Circuit currents and voltages in AC circuits are generally stated as root-mean-square or rms values rather 
than by quoting the maximum values. The root-mean-square for a current is defined by

Since the voltage and current are both sinusoidal, the power expression can be expressed in terms of the 
squares of sine or cosine functions, and the average of a sine or cosine squared over a whole period is 
= 1/2.
5.1.4	
Electrical Measurements
Energy related measurements concerned with electricity production and consumption are usually derived 
from three elements namely: the electrical current, voltage and resistance of the load. These three variables 
are directly linked with the energy or power consumption of the load and hence it is common to see a 
single meter combining these to give a direct reading of the energy consumption.
Multimeters are very useful test instruments. By operating a multi-position switch on the meter they 
can be quickly and easily set to be a voltmeter, an ammeter or an ohmmeter. Two devices can be used 
to measure the electrical measurements: analog and digital multimeters as shown below in Figure. 5.3.

Electrical Measurements
As far as power is concerned, the most common unit of power consumption measurement on the 
electricity meter is the kilowatt hour, which is equal to the amount of energy used by a load of one 
kilowatt over a period of one hour, or 3,600,000 joules. Some electricity companies use the SI mega joule 
instead. Modern electricity meters operate by continuously measuring the instantaneous voltage (volts) 
and current (amperes) and finding the product of these to give instantaneous electrical power (watts) 
which is then integrated against time to give energy used (joules, kilowatt-hours etc). The meters fall 
into two basic categories, electromechanical and electronic, as shown in Figure. 5.4.
The mechanical electricity meter has every other dial rotating counter-clockwise.
The most common type of electricity meter is the Thomson or electromechanical induction watt-hour 
meter, invented by Elihu Thomson in 1888. it work by counting the revolutions of an aluminium disc 
which is made to rotate at a speed proportional to the power. The metallic disc is acted upon by two 
coils. One coil is connected in such a way that it produces a magnetic flux in proportion to the voltage 
and the other produces a magnetic flux in proportion to the current.

Velocity and flow measured by Anemometers
A modern digital electronic wattmeter/energy meter samples the voltage and current thousands of times 
a second. The average of the instantaneous voltage multiplied by the current is the true power. The true 
power divided by the apparent volt-amperes (VA) is the power factor. A computer circuit uses the sampled 
values to calculate RMS voltage, RMS current, VA, power (watts), power factor, and kilowatt-hours. The 
simple models display that information on LCD. More sophisticated models retain the information over 
an extended period of time, and can transmit it to field equipment or a central location.

Velocity and flow measured by Anemometers
Wind speed is the most important factor directly proportional to the power output of a wind turbine. 
Various types of anemometer are used to measure the velocity, usually of air.
5.2.1	
The ‘cup type’ air speed measurement
(Figure 5.5) is used for free air and has hemispherical cups on arms attached to a rotating shaft. The 
shape of the cups gives a greater drag on one side than the other and results in a speed of rotation 
approximately proportional to the air speed. Velocity is found by measuring revolutions over a fixed time.

The ‘vane anemometer’

The ‘vane anemometer’
(Figure 5.6) has an axial impeller attached to a handle with extensions and an electrical pick-up which 
measures the revolutions. A meter with several ranges indicates the velocity.
Figure 5.6 Vane Anemometer
5.2.3	
The ‘hot-wire’ anemometer’
(Figure 5.7) is a probe terminating in an extremely small heated wire element when subjected to a fluid 
stream it cools to an extent, which depends on the velocity of the fluid passing. The resulting change in 
resistance of the element is measured by a bridge circuit and is related to velocity by calibration.

• Mechanical Tachometer
• Digital Tachometer

• Magnetic Field Angular Position Sensors
• Wheel Encoder

Mechanical Tachometer
The choice of technique used for measurement is governed by the application range considered, degree 
of accuracy required, type of installation and original cost. In this section each type will be discussed 
and an overview of the importance of time measurement will also be discussed.
5.3.1	
Mechanical Tachometer
This type of tachometer is a linkage of shafts, gears and rotating weights. When the input shaft which 
is seen horizontal rotates the vertical shaft it also rotates the weights attached to it which are hinged 
and free to move inward and outwards. The movement of these flyweights rotates a pointer which is 
calibrated to give the speed in desired units such as RPM.
Two main drawbacks of this are that the mechanical weights have inertia and hence not very accurate 
and secondly it does not give an indication of the direction of rotation.

5.3.2	
Electrical Tachometers
This type of tachometer could be as simple as a DC or AC generator that can determine the speed of 
shaft rotation by the amount of voltage the generator produces or the frequency of the output signal. The 
magnitude of the generator voltage and the frequency of the generated voltage will increase proportionally 
with speed. Frequency can also be measured by a photocell tachometer. The number of pulses produced 
by the photocell will increase as the speed of the shaft rotation increases.

Electrical Tachometers
The rotating field and the toothed rotor tachometers produce a waveform and the photocell uses a 
rotating disk that has a number of windows in it. A light source is positioned so that it will shine light 
through each window in the disk to a photocell detector as the disk spins. The disk is connected to the 
tachometer shaft, so when it turns the windows line up with the photocell and the photocell produces 
a pulse when it is struck by light. In each of these types of tachometers a pulse stream is produced and 
it is proportional to the speed of the tachometer shaft.

Stroboscope

Stroboscope
Also known as the “strobe”, is an instrument used to make a cyclically moving object appear to be 
slow-moving, or stationary. The principle is used for the study of rotating, reciprocating, oscillating or 
vibrating objects. Machine parts and vibrating strings are common examples.
In electronic versions, the perforated disc is replaced by a lamp capable of emitting brief and rapid flashes 
of light. The frequency of the flash is adjusted so that it is an equal to, or a unit fraction below or above 
the object’s cyclic speed, at which point the object is seen to be either stationary or moving backward 
or forward, depending on the flash frequency.
Figure 5.10 Stroboscope

In order to make a measurement, a mark is made on the object when it is stationary, and the object is 
spun up to speed. The oscillator is set to a low frequency to start with, and the LED is shone at the object 
where the mark is. At first, the mark will appear at random points around the object
When it is stationary, the LED is flashing at the same frequency as the object is rotating. Since the 
frequency is known, the rotational speed is also known, and can be stated in RPM using the formula:
RPM = 60 × fstrobe

Magnetic Field Angular Position Sensors
These are similar shaft encoders, with one exception. They are capable of measuring the angle direction 
of a magnetic field from a magnet with <0.07° resolution. The advantages of measuring field direction 
versus field strength include: insensitivity to the temperature coefficient of the magnet, less sensitivity 
to shock and vibration, and the ability to withstand large variations in the gap between the sensor and 
magnet. These sensors may be operated below 3 volts with a bandwidth response of 0–5 MHz. Output 
is a typical Wheatstone bridge permitting balanced output signals for noise immunity.

Wheel encoder
The main application of this sensor is to determine the angular position of a rotary axis. In this case, a 
permanent magnet is fixed on the engine axis just above the sensor. This magnet generates a directional 
magnetic field parallel to the surface of the sensor (Figure 5.11). This field works as a contactless interface 
between the orientation of the axis and the sensor.
Figure 5.11 The permanent magnet speed sensor.

Wheel encoder
Figure 5.12 shows an example of a typical encoder wheel. The resolution of the encoder wheel is determine 
by the number of cycles or complete phases.
Figure 5.12 Wheel Encoder
The encoder is a sensor attached to a rotating object (such as a wheel or motor) to measure rotation. A 
typical encoder uses optical sensor(s), a moving mechanical component, and a special reflector to provide 
a series of electrical pulses. These pulses can be used as part of a feedback control system to determine 
translation distance, rotational velocity of a rotating component.

The importance of speed in Turbine’s measurements
For instance, to measure the time it takes motor to rotate exactly 360 degrees or more or less, an encoder 
would be ideal. The sensor would be fixed on the shaft (the encoder wheel) would rotate with the shaft. 
The output of an encoder would be a square wave, so if you hook up this signal to a digital counter or 
microcontroller you can then count the pulses. Knowing the distance/angle between each pulse, and the 
time from start to finish, you can easily determine position or angle or velocity of the motor.
5.4	
The importance of speed in Turbine’s measurements
it was discussed earlier that the power output of a wind turbine is proportional the cube of the speed. The 
speed is the most important parameter in evaluating the power from a turbine. It is often understated by 
manufacturers or misunderstood by buyers that the power rating of a wind turbine is only true at a given 
speed, know as the rated speed, which is neither too loo nor too high, but somewhere where it is trusted 
that the wind turbine will be able to withstand the forces of rotation. These speeds are distinguished into 
four different regimes (Figure 5.13):
a)	 Start-up Speed –
This is the speed at which the rotor and blade assembly begins to rotate.
b)	 Cut-in Speed –
Cut-in speed is the minimum wind speed at which the wind turbine will generate usable power. 
This wind speed is typically between 7 and 10 mph for most turbines.

The importance of speed in Turbine’s measurements
c)	 Rated Speed –
The rated speed is the minimum wind speed at which the wind turbine will generate its 
designated rated power. For example, a “10 kilowatt” wind turbine may not generate 10 
kilowatts until wind speeds reach 25 mph. Rated speed for most machines is in the range of 
25 to 35 mph. At wind speeds between cut-in and rated, the power output from a wind turbine 
increases as the wind increases. The output of most machines levels off above the rated speed. 
Most manufacturers provide graphs, called “power curves,” showing how their wind turbine 
output varies with wind speed.
d)	 Cut-out Speed –
At very high wind speeds, typically between 45 and 80 mph, most wind turbines cease power 
generation and shut down. The wind speed at which shut down occurs is called the cut-out 
speed, or sometimes the furling speed. Having a cut-out speed is a safety feature which protects 
the wind turbine from damage. Shut down may occur in one of several ways. In some machines 
an automatic brake is activated by a wind speed sensor. Some machines twist or “pitch” the 
blades to spill the wind. Still others use “spoilers,” drag flaps mounted on the blades or the hub 
which are automatically activated by high rotor rpm’s, or mechanically activated by a spring 
loaded device which turns the machine sideways to the wind stream. Normal wind turbine 
operation usually resumes when the wind drops back to a safe level.

Worked Example 6.2
If the average wind speed of 10 mph which yields 100 watts per square meter, Determine the power 
produced by a wind mill when the wind speed is 40 mph.
Solution:
The change in wind speed means that wind blows at the ratio of 
(40/10 = 4) times
Since the power is proportional to wind speed to power 3, Hence an increase in wind velocity of 4 times, 
implies that the power will be increased by a factor of:
43 = 64
Therefore, if a 10 mph wind gives you 100 watts

Site Survey of wind energy and wind turbine matching
The energy available in a wind stream is a critical element in projecting wind turbine performance and 
availability at a specific site. In general, availability of power in the wind influences the choice of a wind 
turbine in terms of the type of configuration, its rotor size and its siting.
This study will present a software package especially written using the Microsoft Excel program for 
Windows, to use the availability of wind energy on a given site under given wind conditions in order 
to evaluate the pattern and amount of energy possible to collect at any one time. The software package 
processes the data from a typical wind database, calculates and plots graphs concerning Annual Energy 
Output (A.E.O.), Power Curves for a range of manufacturers, Wind Speed Frequency, Wind Speed 
Distribution and Wind Speed Vertical Profile.
The package utilises two principles in the calculations namely: The Swept Area Method and the Power 
Curve Method.

Introduction

Introduction
Wind energy has been used for thousands of years for milling grain, pumping water, and other mechanical 
power applications. Today, there are over one million windmills in operation around the world. These 
are used principally for water pumping and providing electricity for remote regions. On a pan European 
front, a total of 8,484 MW wind power capacity was installed in the EU in 2008. This puts wind energy 
ahead of any other power technology for the first time. 36% of all new electricity producing capacity 
installed in the EU in 2008 was wind energy followed by natural gas (6,932 MW – 29%), oil (2,495 
MW – 10%), coal (762 MW – 3%) and hydro (473 MW – 2%).At the end of 2008, there were 65 GW of 
wind power capacity installed in the EU-27 producing 142 TWh hours of electricity, and meeting 4.2% 
of EU electricity demand. A binding target of 20% renewable energy has been set for the EU to achieve 
by 2020 [2]. The UK is the windiest country in Europe, and if utilised effectively it could easily provide 
power to satisfy the 20% contribution of the UK market.
The cost of wind energy equipment fell steadily between the early 1980s and the early 1990s. The 
technology is continually being improved to make it both cheaper and more reliable, so it can be expected 
that wind energy will become economically competitive with fossil fuels during the coming decades [3].

If ρ = density of air, V = relative velocity of the wind and A = flow – swept area through which the

Note that this is the ideal power available (Pw), in the wind. Only a fraction of this power can actually 
be extracted, because of losses that incurred in the energy conversion process.
Useful power which can be extracted by the turbine rotor is given by multiplying the available power by 
a coefficient of performance Cp for the particular turbine. Cp has a maximum theoretical value of 0.593 
(Betz’ law). Other losses incurred in conversion through the gearbox and generator..

Estimating the Annual Energy Output (A.E.O.)
ηgen = generator efficiency (50% for car alternator, 80% or possibly more for a permanent magnet generator 
or grid-connected induction generator)
ηgb = gearbox / bearings efficiency (depends, could be as high as 95% if good)
The wind variation for a typical site is usually described using the so-called Weibull distribution. The 
Weibull distribution represents a mathematical distribution which resembles the distribution of different 
wind speeds throughout the year. It’s a statistical model that gives the probability of occurrence. The

Wind turbine manufacturers often present performance figures for their machines using the Rayleigh 
distribution.
Figures 8.1, and 8.2 depict two different Rayleigh distributions for two different values of wind speeds 
(3 and 8 m/s respectively).

Then the wind speed frequency is matching with the power curve to estimate the Annual Energy Output 
(AEO). Thus:
(AEO) = power × wind speed frequency 	
in [kWh/yr] 
(8.7)
Finally the total annual energy output (AEO) is calculated by summing the energy produced (kWh/yr) 
at all wind speeds within the operating range of each wind turbine, and divining by 106 to get results

The Software Package
In this software package there is available a database, of seven (7) different manufacturers and twenty 
eight (28) different models of various sizes covering a wide range from 0.5 kW to 2500 kW.
Finally, the software package is quite friendly to the user because requires just 5 simple steps before the 
user can get the desirable output.
At the sheet named ‘Calculations’, [Figure 8.3] the user should enter the following inputs:
1.	 the annual average wind speed u at standard height z = 10 m
2.	 the index a which is a parameter relative to surface roughness
The user can find a Table indicating the values to be expected to certain types of terrain at the 
sheet named ‘Help Menu’.
3.	 the hub height h. In this software package there are available eight different values of  
height h
i.e. h = 10 m, 20 m, 30 m, 40 m, 50 m, 60 m, 70 m, 80 m.
Height requirements for medium and large wind turbines are 20–80 m.
Height requirements for small wind turbines are up to 20 m.
4.	 the name of the manufacturer
5.	 the name of the model 
In this software package there is available a database of seven different manufacturers and 
twenty eight different models of various sizes (from 0,5 kW–2500 kW)
Figure 8.3: Main menu
The user then get the following output:
1.	 the annual average wind speed v at hub height for the above 8 different values of height h
2.	 the total Annual Energy Output (AEO) in [GWh/yr]
The ‘Rayleigh Distribution’, [Figure 8.4] shows a graph of a mathematical distribution called the Rayleigh 
distribution which resembles the distribution of different wind speeds throughout the year.

Conclusions
Initial conditions:
Annual average wind speed at a standard height z = 10 m, u = 4,6 m/sec. and Index a = 0,1.
However, with this Software Package the user is able to produce calculations from a limited database 
of twenty eight (28) different wind turbine models. This limitation occurs due to a programming error 
of the Microsoft Excel program. Nevertheless, the existing database covers a wide range of models of 
various sizes (from 0,5–2500 kW), helping the user to decide on a model of any size and application.
8.7	
Conclusions
This study has achieved the development of a Software Package, which gives to the user the ability to 
evaluate the pattern and amount of energy possible to extract from the wind.
The package is quite accurate giving that way the opportunity to the user to make the right choice. 
It computes the wind energy resource evaluation by calculating the Annual Energy Output (A.E.O.), 
matching the best Turbine for the available wind resource. However, further considerations (i.e. the price 
of the machine, its reliability, and the cost of operation and maintenance) must be examined before the 
final decision is made.
