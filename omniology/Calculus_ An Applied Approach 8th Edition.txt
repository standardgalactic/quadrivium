A Word from the Author
Welcome to Calculus: An Applied Approach, Eighth Edition. In this revision, I
focused not only on providing a meaningful revision to the text, but also a 
completely integrated learning program. Applied calculus students are a diverse
group with varied interests and backgrounds. The revision strives to address the
diversity and the different learning styles of students. I also aimed to 
alleviate and remove obstacles that prevent students from mastering the material.  
An Enhanced Text
The table of contents was streamlined to enable instructors to spend more time on
each topic. This added time will give students a better understanding of the
concepts and help them to master the material.
Real data and applications were updated, rewritten, and added to address more
modern topics, and data was gathered from news sources, current events,
industry, world events, and government. Exercises derived from other disciplines’
textbooks are included to show the relevance of the calculus to students’ majors.
I hope these changes will give students a clear picture that the math they are
learning exists beyond the classroom.
Two new chapter tests were added: a Mid-Chapter Quiz and a Chapter Test.
The Mid-Chapter quiz gives students the opportunity to discover any topics they
might need to study further before they progress too far into the chapter. The
Chapter Test allows students to identify and strengthen any weaknesses in
advance of an exam.
Several new section-level features were added to promote further mastery of
the concepts.
■Concept Checks appear at the end of each section, immediately before the 
exercise sets. They ask non-computational questions designed to test students’
basic understanding of that sections’ concepts.
■Make a Decision exercises and examples ask open-ended questions that force
students to apply concepts to real-world situations.
■Extended Applications are more in-depth, applied exercises requiring students
to work with large data sets and often involve work in creating or analyzing
models.
I hope the combination of these new features with the existing features will
promote a deeper understanding of the mathematics.
Enhanced Resources
Although the textbook often forms the basis of the course, today’s students often
find greater value in an integrated text and technology program. With that in
mind, I worked with the publisher to enhance the online and media resources
available to students, to provide them with a complete learning program.

An online course has been developed with dynamic, algorithmic exercises tied
to exercises within the text. These exercises provide students with unlimited prac-
tice for complete mastery of the topics.
An additional resource for the 8th edition is a Multimedia Online eBook. This
eBook breaks the physical constraints of a traditional text and binds a number of
multimedia assets and features to the text itself. Based in Flash, students can read
the text, watch the videos when they need extra explanation, view enlarged math
graphs, and more. The eBook promotes multiple learning styles and provides 
students with an engaging learning experience.
For students who work best in groups or whose schedules don’t allow them to
come to office hours, Calc Chat is now available with this edition. Calc Chat
(located at www.CalcChat.com) provides solutions to exercises. Calc Chat also
has a moderated online forum for students to discuss any issues they may be
having with their calculus work.
I hope you enjoy the enhancements made to the eighth edition. I believe the
whole suite of learning options available to students will enable any student to
master applied calculus.

Study Strategies
Your success in mathematics depends on your active participation both in class and outside of class. Because the 
material you learn each day builds on the material you have learned previously, it is important that you keep up with your
course work every day and develop a clear plan of study. This set of guidelines highlights key study strategies to help
you learn how to study mathematics.
Preparing for Class
The syllabus your instructor provides is an invaluable resource that outlines the major topics to be
covered in the course. Use it to help you prepare. As a general rule, you should set aside two to four hours of study time
for each hour spent in class. Being prepared is the first step toward success. Before class:
■Review your notes from the previous class.
■Read the portion of the text that will be covered in class.
Keeping Up
Another important step toward success in mathematics involves your ability to keep up with the work. It
is very easy to fall behind, especially if you miss a class. To keep up with the course work, be sure to:
■Attend every class. Bring your text, a notebook, a pen or pencil, and a calculator (scientific or graphing). If you miss a
class, get the notes from a classmate as soon as possible and review them carefully.
■Participate in class. As mentioned above, if there is a topic you do not understand, ask about it before the instructor
moves on to a new topic.
■Take notes in class. After class, read through your notes and add explanations so that your notes make sense to you.
Fill in any gaps and note any questions you might have.
Getting Extra Help
It can be very frustrating when you do not understand concepts and are unable to complete 
homework assignments. However, there are many resources available to help you with your studies.
■Your instructor may have office hours. If you are feeling overwhelmed and need help, make an appointment to discuss
your difficulties with your instructor.
■Find a study partner or a study group. Sometimes it helps to work through problems with another person.
■Special assistance with algebra appears in the Algebra Reviews, which appear throughout each chapter. These short
reviews are tied together in the larger Algebra Review section at the end of each chapter.
Preparing for an Exam
The last step toward success in mathematics lies in how you prepare for and complete exams.
If you have followed the suggestions given above, then you are almost ready for exams. Do not assume that you can cram
for the exam the night before—this seldom works. As a final preparation for the exam:
■When you study for an exam, first look at all definitions, properties, and formulas until you know them. Review 
your notes and the portion of the text that will be covered on the exam. Then work as many exercises as you can, 
especially any kinds of exercises that have given you trouble in the past, reworking homework problems as necessary.
■Start studying for your exam well in advance (at least a week). The first day or two, study only about two hours.
Gradually increase your study time each day. Be completely prepared for the exam two days in advance. Spend the
final day just building confidence so you can be relaxed during the exam.

SECTION 2.1
The Derivative and the Slope of a Graph
115
■Identify tangent lines to a graph at a point.
■Approximate the slopes of tangent lines to graphs at points.
■Use the limit definition to find the slopes of graphs at points.
■Use the limit definition to find the derivatives of functions.
■Describe the relationship between differentiability and continuity.
Tangent Line to a Graph
Calculus is a branch of mathematics that studies rates of change of functions. In
this course, you will learn that rates of change have many applications in real life.
In Section 1.3, you learned how the slope of a line indicates the rate at which the
line rises or falls. For a line, this rate (or slope) is the same at every point on the
line. For graphs other than lines, the rate at which the graph rises or falls changes
from point to point. For instance, in Figure 2.1, the parabola is rising more
quickly at the point 
than it is at the point 
At the vertex 
the
graph levels off, and at the point 
the graph is falling.
To determine the rate at which a graph rises or falls at a single point, you can
find the slope of the tangent line at the point. In simple terms, the tangent line to
the graph of a function f at a point 
is the line that best approximates the
graph at that point, as shown in Figure 2.1. Figure 2.2 shows other examples of
tangent lines.

Differentiation
Higher-order derivatives are used to determine the acceleration function of a 
sports car. The acceleration function shows the changes in the car’s velocity. As 
the car reaches its “cruising”speed, is the acceleration increasing or decreasing?
(See Section 2.6, Exercise 45.)
Differentiation has many real-life applications. The applications
listed below represent a sample of the applications in this chapter.

Modeling Revenue
From 2000 through 2005, the revenue R (in millions of dollars per year) for
Microsoft Corporation can be modeled by
where represents the year, with 
corresponding to 2000. At what rate was
Microsoft’s revenue changing in 2001?
(Source: Microsoft Corporation)
SOLUTION
One way to answer this question is to find the derivative of the 
revenue model with respect to time.
In 2001 (when 
), the rate of change of the revenue with respect to time is
given by
Because R is measured in millions of dollars and t is measured in years, it follows
that the derivative 
is measured in millions of dollars per year. So, at the end
of 2001, Microsoft’s revenue was increasing at a rate of about $2813 million per
year, as shown in Figure 2.17.

Simplifying Algebraic Expressions
To be successful in using derivatives, you must be good at simplifying algebraic expres-
sions. Here are some helpful simplification techniques.
1. Combine like terms. This may involve expanding an expression by multiplying factors.
2. Divide out like factors in the numerator and denominator of an expression.
3. Factor an expression.
4. Rationalize a denominator.
5. Add, subtract, multiply, or divide fractions.

The Real Number Line
Real numbers can be represented with a coordinate system called the real
number line (or x-axis), as shown in Figure 0.1. The positive direction (to the
right) is denoted by an arrowhead and indicates the direction of increasing values
of x. The real number corresponding to a particular point on the real number line
is called the coordinate of the point. As shown in Figure 0.1, it is customary to
label those points whose coordinates are integers.
The point on the real number line corresponding to zero is called the origin.
Numbers to the right of the origin are positive, and numbers to the left of the
origin are negative. The term nonnegative describes a number that is either
positive or zero.
The importance of the real number line is that it provides you with a 
conceptually perfect picture of the real numbers. That is, each point on the real
number line corresponds to one and only one real number, and each real number
corresponds to one and only one point on the real number line. This type of rela-
tionship is called a one-to-one correspondence and is illustrated in Figure 0.2.
Each of the four points in Figure 0.2 corresponds to a real number that can
be expressed as the ratio of two integers.
Such numbers are called rational. Rational numbers have either terminating or
infinitely repeating decimal representations.
Terminating Decimals
Infinitely Repeating Decimals
*
Real numbers that are not rational are called irrational, and they cannot be
represented as the ratio of two integers (or as terminating or infinitely repeating
decimals). So, a decimal approximation is used to represent an irrational number.
Some irrational numbers occur so frequently in applications that mathematicians
have invented special symbols to represent them. For example, the symbols 
and e represent irrational numbers whose decimal approximations are as
shown. (See Figure 0.3.)
*The bar indicates which digit or digits repeat infinitely.

Order and Intervals on the Real Number Line
One important property of the real numbers is that they are ordered: 0 is less 
than 1,
is less than 
is less than 
and so on. You can visualize this
property on the real number line by observing that a is less than b if and only if
a lies to the left of b on the real number line. Symbolically, “a is less than b” is
denoted by the inequality 
For example, the inequality 
follows from
the fact that lies to the left of 1 on the real number line, as shown in Figure 0.4.
FIGURE 0.4
When three real numbers a, x, and b are ordered such that 
and 
we say that x is between a and b and write
x is between a and b.
The set of all real numbers between a and b is called the open interval between
a and b and is denoted by 
An interval of the form 
does not contain
the “endpoints” a and b. Intervals that include their endpoints are called closed
and are denoted by 
Intervals of the form 
and 
are neither open
nor closed. Figure 0.5 shows the nine types of intervals on the real number line.

Solving Inequalities
In calculus, you are frequently required to “solve inequalities” involving variable
expressions such as 
The number a is a solution of an inequality if
the inequality is true when a is substituted for x. The set of all values of x that
satisfy an equality is called the solution set of the inequality. The following
properties are useful for solving inequalities. (Similar properties are obtained if 
is replaced by 
and 
is replaced by 
)
Note that you reverse the inequality when you multiply by a negative number. For
example, if 
then 
This principle also applies to division by a
negative number. So, if 
then

Once you have solved an
inequality, it is a good idea to
check some -values in your
solution set to see whether they
satisfy the original inequality.
You might also check some
values outside your solution set
to verify that they do not satisfy
the inequality. For example,

The inequality in Example 1 involves a first-degree polynomial. To solve
inequalities involving polynomials of higher degree, you can use the fact that a
polynomial can change signs only at its real zeros (the real numbers that make the
polynomial zero). Between two consecutive real zeros, a polynomial must be
entirely positive or entirely negative. This means that when the real zeros of a
polynomial are put in order, they divide the real number line into test intervals
in which the polynomial has no sign changes. That is, if a polynomial has the
factored form
then the test intervals are
and
For example, the polynomial
can change signs only at 
and 
To determine the sign of the 
polynomial in the intervals 
and 
you need to test only
one value from each interval.

SOLUTION
Write original inequality.

Factor.
So, the polynomial 
has 
and 
as its zeros. You can 
solve the inequality by testing the sign of the polynomial in each of the following
intervals.
To test an interval, choose a representative number in the interval and compute
the sign of each factor. For example, for any 
both of the factors 
and 
are negative. Consequently, the product (of two negative numbers) is
positive, and the inequality is not satisfied in the interval
A convenient testing format is shown in Figure 0.7. Because the inequality is 
satisfied only by the center test interval, you can conclude that the solution set is
given by the interval

Application
Inequalities are frequently used to describe conditions that occur in business and
science. For instance, the inequality
describes the recommended weight W for a man whose height is 5 feet 10 inches.
Example 3 shows how an inequality can be used to describe the production levels
in a manufacturing plant.
Example 3
Production Levels
In addition to fixed overhead costs of $500 per day, the cost of producing units
of an item is $2.50 per unit. During the month of August, the total cost of 
production varied from a high of $1325 to a low of $1200 per day. Find the high
and low production levels during the month.
SOLUTION
Because it costs $2.50 to produce one unit, it costs 
to produce
units. Furthermore, because the fixed cost per day is $500, the total daily cost
of producing 
units is 
Now, because the cost ranged from
$1200 to $1325, you can write the following.
Write original inequality.
Subtract 500 from each part.
Simplify.
Divide each part by 2.5.
x
Simplify.
So, the daily production levels during the month of August varied from a low of
280 units to a high of 330 units, as shown in Figure 0.8.
FIGURE 0.8
✓CHECKPOINT 3
Use the information in Example 3 to find the high and low production levels if,
during October, the total cost of production varied from a high of $1500 to a
low of $1000 per day. ■

Then,

The following properties are useful for working with absolute values.
Be sure you understand the fourth property in this list. A common error in
algebra is to imagine that by squaring a number and then taking the square root,
you come back to the original number. But this is true only if the original 
number is nonnegative. For instance, if 
then
but if 
then
The reason for this is that (by definition) the square root symbol 
denotes only
the nonnegative root.

Intervals Defined by Absolute Value
Example 2
Defining an Interval on the Real Number Line
Find the interval on the real number line that contains all numbers that lie no more
than two units from 3.
SOLUTION
Let x be any point in this interval. You need to find all such that the
distance between x and 3 is less than or equal to 2. This implies that
Requiring the absolute value of 
to be less than or equal to 2 means that
must lie between 
and 2. So, you can write
Solving this pair of inequalities, you have
x
Solution set
So, the interval is 
as shown in Figure 0.11.

MAKE A DECISION
Quality Control
A large manufacturer hired a quality control firm to determine the reliability 
of a product. Using statistical methods, the firm determined that the manufacturer
could expect 
of the units to be defective. If the manufacturer
offers a money-back guarantee on this product, how much should be budgeted to
cover the refunds on 100,000 units? (Assume that the retail price is $8.95.) Will
the manufacturer have to establish a refund budget greater than $5000?
SOLUTION
Let 
represent the percent of defective units (written in decimal
form). You know that will differ from 0.0035 by at most 0.0017.
Figure 0.12(a)
Now, letting x be the number of defective units out of 100,000, it follows that
and you have
x
Figure 0.12(b)
Finally, letting C be the cost of refunds, you have 
So, the total cost of
refunds for 100,000 units should fall within the interval given by
C
Figure 0.12(c)
No, the refund budget will be less than $5000.
✓CHECKPOINT 3
Use the information in Example 3 to determine how much should be budgeted
to cover refunds on 250,000 units. ■
In Example 3, the manufacturer should expect to spend between $1611 and
$4654 for refunds. Of course, the safer budget figure for refunds would be the
higher of these estimates. However, from a statistical point of view, the most
representative estimate would be the average of these two extremes. Graphically,
the average of two numbers is the midpoint of the interval with the two numbers
as endpoints, as shown in Figure 0.13.

A graphing utility offers
several ways to calculate
rational exponents and radicals.
You should be familiar with 
the -squared key      . This 
key squares the value of an
expression.
For rational exponents or
exponents other than 2, use the
key.
For radical expressions, you
can use the square root key      ,
the cube root key       , or the 
th root key       . Consult your
graphing utility user’s guide for
specific keystrokes you can use
to evaluate rational exponents

Domain of an Algebraic Expression
When working with algebraic expressions involving x, you face the potential
difficulty of substituting a value of x for which the expression is not defined (does
not produce a real number). For example, the expression 
is not defined
when 
because 
is not a real number.
The set of all values for which an expression is defined is called its domain.
So, the domain of 
is the set of all values of x such that 
is a
real number. In order for 
to represent a real number, it is necessary that
In other words,
is defined only for those values of x that
lie in the interval 
as shown in Figure 0.14.

The zeros in Example 1(a) are irrational, and the zeros in Example 1(c) are

it cannot be factored into linear factors with rational coefficients. The next

example, factoring is used to find the zeros of each quadratic. Try using the

Factoring Polynomials of Degree Three or More
It can be difficult to find the zeros of polynomials of degree three or more.
However, if one of the zeros of a polynomial is known, then you can use that zero
to reduce the degree of the polynomial. For example, if you know that 
is a
zero of 
then you know that 
is a factor, and you can
use long division to factor the polynomial as shown.
As an alternative to long division, many people prefer to use synthetic
division to reduce the degree of a polynomial.
Performing synthetic division on the polynomial
using the given zero,
produces the following.
When you use synthetic division, remember to take all coefficients into
account—even if some of them are zero. For instance, if you know that 
is a zero of 
you can apply synthetic division as shown.

The Rational Zero Theorem
There is a systematic way to find the rational zeros of a polynomial. You can use
the Rational Zero Theorem (also called the Rational Root Theorem).
Example 4
Using the Rational Zero Theorem
Find all real zeros of the polynomial.
SOLUTION
The possible rational zeros are the factors of the constant term divided by the
factors of the leading coefficient.
By testing these possible zeros, you can see that 
works.
Now, by synthetic division you have the following.
Finally, by factoring the quadratic,
you have
and you can conclude that the zeros are

In adding (or subtracting) fractions whose denominators have no common
factors, it is convenient to use the following pattern.
For instance, in Example 1(b), you could have used this pattern as shown.
In Example 1, the denominators of the rational expressions have no common
factors. When the denominators do have common factors, it is best to find the
least common denominator before adding or subtracting. For instance, when
adding 
and 
you can recognize that the least common denominator is 
and write

Expressions Involving Radicals
In calculus, the operation of differentiation tends to produce “messy” expressions
when applied to fractional expressions. This is especially true when the fractional
expressions involve radicals. When differentiation is used, it is important to be
able to simplify these expressions so that you can obtain more manageable forms.
All of the expressions in Examples 4 and 5 are the results of differentiation. In
each case, note how much simpler the simplified form is than the original form.

Rationalization Techniques
In working with quotients involving radicals, it is often convenient to move the
radical expression from the denominator to the numerator, or vice versa. For
example, you can move 
from the denominator to the numerator in the
following quotient by multiplying by 
Radical in Denominator

Radical in Numerator
This process is called rationalizing the denominator. A similar process is used
to rationalize the numerator.

■Find the distance between two points in a coordinate plane.
■Find the midpoints of line segments connecting two points.
■Translate points in a coordinate plane.
The Cartesian Plane
Just as you can represent real numbers by points on a real number line, you 
can represent ordered pairs of real numbers by points in a plane called the 
rectangular coordinate system, or the Cartesian plane, after the French math-
ematician René Descartes (1596–1650).
The Cartesian plane is formed by using two real number lines intersecting at
right angles, as shown in Figure 1.1. The horizontal real number line is usually
called the x-axis, and the vertical real number line is usually called the y-axis.
The point of intersection of these two axes is the origin, and the two axes divide
the plane into four parts called quadrants.
Each point in the plane corresponds to an ordered pair
of real num-
bers x and y, called coordinates of the point. The x-coordinate represents the
directed distance from the y-axis to the point, and the y-coordinate represents the
directed distance from the x-axis to the point, as shown in Figure 1.2.
Example 1
Plotting Points in the Cartesian Plane

and 
SOLUTION
To plot the point
imagine a vertical line through 
on the x-axis and a horizontal line through 2
on the y-axis. The intersection of these two lines is the point

four points can be plotted in a similar way and are shown in Figure 1.3.

Using a rectangular coordinate system allows you to visualize relationships
between two variables.  In Example 2, notice how much your intuition is enhanced
by the use of a graphical presentation.
Example 2
Sketching a Scatter Plot
The amounts 
(in millions of dollars) spent on snowmobiles in the United States
from 1997 through 2006 are shown in the table, where 
represents the year.
Sketch a scatter plot of the data.
(Source: International Snowmobile Manufacturers
Association)
SOLUTION
To sketch a scatter plot of the data given in the table, you simply
represent each pair of values by an ordered pair 
and plot the resulting
points, as shown in Figure 1.4. For instance, the first pair of values is represented
by the ordered pair (1997, 1006). Note that the break in the t-axis indicates that
the numbers between 0 and 1996 have been omitted.

The Distance Formula
Recall from the Pythagorean Theorem that, for a right triangle with hypotenuse
of length c and sides of lengths a and b, you have
Pythagorean Theorem
as shown in Figure 1.5. (The converse is also true. That is, if 
then
the triangle is a right triangle.)
Suppose you want to determine the distance d between two points 
and 
in the plane. With these two points, a right triangle can be formed, as
shown in Figure 1.6. The length of the vertical side of the triangle is
and the length of the horizontal side is
By the Pythagorean Theorem, you can write
This result is the Distance Formula.

Example 4
Verifying a Right Triangle
Use the Distance Formula to show that the points 
and 
are 
vertices of a right triangle.
SOLUTION
The three points are plotted in Figure 1.8. Using the Distance
Formula, you can find the lengths of the three sides as shown below.
Because 
you can apply the converse of the Pythagorean Theorem to conclude that the 
triangle must be a right triangle.
✓CHECKPOINT 4
Use the Distance Formula to show that the points 
and 
are vertices of a right triangle. ■
The figures provided with Examples 3 and 4 were not really essential to the
solution. Nevertheless, we strongly recommend that you develop the habit of
including sketches with your solutions—even if they are not required.
Example 5
Finding the Length of a Pass
In a football game, a quarterback throws a pass from the 5-yard line, 20 yards
from the sideline. The pass is caught by a wide receiver on the 45-yard line,
50 yards from the same sideline, as shown in Figure 1.9. How long was the pass?
SOLUTION
You can find the length of the pass by finding the distance between
the points 
and

Simplify.
So, the pass was 50 yards long.

In Example 5, the scale along the goal line showing distance from the sideline
does not normally appear on a football field. However, when you use coordi-
nate geometry to solve real-life problems, you are free to place the coordinate
system in any way that is convenient to the solution of the problem.
✓CHECKPOINT 5
A quarterback throws a pass from
the 10-yard line, 10 yards from the
sideline. The pass is caught by a
wide receiver on the 30-yard line,
25 yards from the same sideline.

Estimating Annual Sales
Starbucks Corporation had annual sales of $4.08 billion in 2003 and $6.37 billion
in 2005. Without knowing any additional information, what would you estimate
the 2004 sales to have been?
(Source: Starbucks Corp.)
SOLUTION
One solution to the problem is to assume that sales followed a 
linear pattern. With this assumption, you can estimate the 2004 sales by finding
the midpoint of the segment connecting the points (2003, 4.08) and (2005, 6.37).
So, you would estimate the 2004 sales to have been about $5.23 billion, as shown
in Figure 1.11. (The actual 2004 sales were $5.29 billion.)

The Graph of an Equation
In Section 1.1, you used a coordinate system to represent graphically the 
relationship between two quantities. There, the graphical picture consisted of a
collection of points in a coordinate plane (see Example 2 in Section 1.1).
Frequently, a relationship between two quantities is expressed as an equation.
For instance, degrees on the Fahrenheit scale are related to degrees on the Celsius
scale by the equation 
In this section, you will study some basic
procedures for sketching the graphs of such equations. The graph of an equation
is the set of all points that are solutions of the equation.
Example 1
Sketching the Graph of an Equation

SOLUTION
The simplest way to sketch the graph of an equation is the point-
plotting method. With this method, you construct a table of values that consists of
several solution points of the equation, as shown in the table below. For instance,
when 
which implies that 
is a solution point of the graph.
From the table, it follows that 
and 
are
solution points of the equation. After plotting these points, you can see that they
appear to lie on a line, as shown in Figure 1.13. The graph of the equation is the
line that passes through the five plotted points.

The point-plotting technique demonstrated in Examples 1 and 2 is easy to
use, but it does have some shortcomings. With too few solution points, you can
badly misrepresent the graph of a given equation. For instance, how would you
connect the four points in Figure 1.15? Without further information, any one of
the three graphs in Figure 1.16 would be reasonable.

Intercepts of a Graph
It is often easy to determine the solution points that have zero as either the 
x-coordinate or the y-coordinate. These points are called intercepts because they
are the points at which the graph intersects the x- or y-axis.
Some texts denote the x-intercept as the x-coordinate of the point 
rather
than the point itself. Unless it is necessary to make a distinction, we will use the
term intercept to mean either the point or the coordinate.
A graph may have no intercepts or several intercepts, as shown in Figure 1.17.

Zooming in to Find Intercepts
You can use the zoom feature of a graphing utility to approximate 
the -intercepts of a graph. Suppose you want to approximate the 
-intercept(s) of the graph of
Begin by graphing the equation, as shown below in part (a). From the viewing
window shown, the graph appears to have only one -intercept. This intercept
lies between

By zooming in on the intercept, you can improve
the approximation, as shown in part (b). To three decimal places, the solution
is

(b)
Here are some suggestions for using the zoom feature.
1. With each successive zoom-in, adjust the -scale so that the viewing 
window shows at least one tick mark on each side of the -intercept.
2. The error in your approximation will be less than the distance between 
two scale marks.
3. The trace feature can usually be used to add one more decimal place of
accuracy without changing the viewing window.
Part (a) below shows the graph of

Circles
Throughout this course, you will learn to recognize several types of graphs from
their equations. For instance, you should recognize that the graph of a second-
degree equation of the form
is a parabola (see Example 2). Another easily recognized graph is that of a circle.
Consider the circle shown in Figure 1.20. A point 
is on the circle if and
only if its distance from the center 
is r. By the Distance Formula,
By squaring both sides of this equation, you obtain the standard form of the
equation of a circle.
From this result, you can see that the standard form of the equation of a 
circle with its center at the origin,
is simply

Points of Intersection
A point of intersection of two graphs is an ordered pair that is a solution point
of both graphs. For instance, Figure 1.23 shows that the graphs of
and
have two points of intersection:
and 
To find the points analyti-
cally, set the two y-values equal to each other and solve the equation
for x.
A common business application that involves points of intersection is break-
even analysis. The marketing of a new product typically requires an initial 
investment. When sufficient units have been sold so that the total revenue has 
offset the total cost, the sale of the product has reached the break-even point. The
total cost of producing x units of a product is denoted by C, and the total 
revenue from the sale of x units of the product is denoted by R. So, you can find
the break-even point by setting the cost C equal to the revenue R, and solving for x.
Example 6
MAKE A DECISION
Finding a Break-Even Point
A business manufactures a product at a cost of $0.65 per unit and sells the product
for $1.20 per unit. The company’s initial investment to produce the product was
$10,000. Will the company break even if it sells 18,000 units? How many units
must the company sell to break even?
SOLUTION
The total cost of producing x units of the product is given by
Cost equation
The total revenue from the sale of x units is given by
Revenue equation
To find the break-even point, set the cost equal to the revenue and solve for x.
Set revenue equal to cost.
Substitute for R and C.
Subtract 0.65x from each side.
Divide each side by 0.55.
Use a calculator.
No, the company will not break even if it sells 18,000 units. The company must
sell 18,182 units before it breaks even. This result is shown graphically in Figure

CHAPTER 1
Functions, Graphs, and Limits
Two types of applications that economists use to analyze a market are 
supply and demand equations. A supply equation shows the relationship between
the unit price p of a product and the quantity supplied x. The graph of a supply
equation is called a supply curve. (See Figure 1.25.) A typical supply curve rises
because producers of a product want to sell more units if the unit price is higher.
A demand equation shows the relationship between the unit price p of a
product and the quantity demanded x. The graph of a demand equation is called
a demand curve. (See Figure 1.26.) A typical demand curve tends to show a
decrease in the quantity demanded with each increase in price.
In an ideal situation, with no other factors present to influence the market,
the production level should stabilize at the point of intersection of the graphs of
the supply and demand equations. This point is called the equilibrium point. The 
x-coordinate of the equilibrium point is called the equilibrium quantity and the
p-coordinate is called the equilibrium price. (See Figure 1.27.) You can find 
the equilibrium point by setting the demand equation equal to the supply 
equation and solving for x.
Example 7
Finding the Equilibrium Point
The demand and supply equations for a DVD player are given by
Demand equation
Supply equation
where p is the price in dollars and x represents the number of units in millions.
Find the equilibrium point for this market.
SOLUTION
Begin by setting the demand equation equal to the supply equation.
Set equations equal to each other.
Subtract 150 from each side.
Add 5.8x to each side.
Divide each side by 9.
So, the equilibrium point occurs when the demand and supply are each five 
million units. (See Figure 1.28.) The price that corresponds to this x-value is
obtained by substituting 
into either of the original equations. For instance,
substituting into the demand equation produces
Substitute 
into the supply equation to see that you obtain the same price.
✓CHECKPOINT 7

Mathematical Models
In this text, you will see many examples of the use of equations as mathematical
models of real-life phenomena. In developing a mathematical model to 
represent actual data, you should strive for two (often conflicting) goals—
accuracy and simplicity.
Example 8
Using Mathematical Models
The table shows the annual sales (in millions of dollars) for Dillard’s and Kohl’s
for 2001 to 2005. In the summer of 2006, the publication Value Line listed the
projected 2006 sales for the companies as $7625 million and $15,400 million,
respectively. How do you think these projections were obtained?
(Source:
Dillard’s Inc. and Kohl’s Corp.)
SOLUTION
The projections were obtained by using past sales to predict future
sales. The past sales were modeled by equations that were found by a statistical
procedure called least squares regression analysis.
Dillard’s
Kohl’s
Using 
to represent 2006, you can predict the 2006 sales to be
Dillard’s
Kohl’s
These two projections are close to those projected by Value Line. The graphs of
the two models are shown in Figure 1.29.
✓CHECKPOINT 8
The table shows the annual sales (in millions of dollars) for Dollar General for
1999 through 2005. In the summer of 2005, the publication Value Line listed
projected 2006 sales for Dollar General as $9300 million. How does this
projection compare with the projection obtained using the model below?

Much of your study of calculus will center around the behavior of the graphs
of mathematical models. Figure 1.30 shows the graphs of six basic algebraic
equations. Familiarity with these graphs will help you in the creation and use of

Using Slope
The simplest mathematical model for relating two variables is the linear 
equation 
The equation is called linear because its graph is a line.
(In this text, the term line is used to mean straight line.) By letting 
you can
see that the line crosses the y-axis at 
as shown in Figure 1.31. In other
words, the y-intercept is 
The steepness or slope of the line is m.
The slope of a line is the number of units the line rises (or falls) vertically for each
unit of horizontal change from left to right, as shown in Figure 1.31.

Once you have determined the slope and the y-intercept of a line, it is a 
relatively simple matter to sketch its graph.
In the following example, note that none of the lines is vertical. A vertical
line has an equation of the form
Vertical line
Because such an equation cannot be written in the form 
it follows
that the slope of a vertical line is undefined, as indicated in Figure 1.32.

you can see that the 
y-intercept is 
and the slope is zero. A zero slope implies that the line is

In real-life problems, the slope of a line can be interpreted as either a ratio
or a rate. If the -axis and -axis have the same unit of measure, then the slope
has no units and is a ratio. If the -axis and -axis have different units of 
measure, then the slope is a rate or rate of change.
Example 2
MAKE A DECISION
Using Slope as a Ratio
The maximum recommended slope of a wheelchair ramp is 
A busi-
ness is installing a wheelchair ramp that rises 22 inches over a horizontal length
of 24 feet, as shown in Figure 1.34. Is the ramp steeper than recommended?
(Source: American Disabilities Act Handbook)
SOLUTION The horizontal length of the ramp is 24 feet or 
inches.
So, the slope of the ramp is
So, the slope is not steeper than recommended.

Example 3
Using Slope as a Rate of Change
A manufacturing company determines that the total cost in dollars of producing
units of a product is 
Describe the practical significance of the
-intercept and slope of the line given by this equation.
SOLUTION
The -intercept 
tells you that the cost of producing zero
units is $3500. This is the fixed cost of production—it includes costs that must
be paid regardless of the number of units produced. The slope of 
tells you
that the cost of producing each unit is $25, as shown in Figure 1.35. Economists
call the cost per unit the marginal cost. If the production increases by one unit,
then the “margin” or extra amount of cost is $25.

Finding the Slope of a Line
Given an equation of a nonvertical line, you can find its slope by writing the 
equation in slope-intercept form. If you are not given an equation, you can still
find the slope of a line. For instance, suppose you want to find the slope of the
line passing through the points 
and 
as shown in Figure 1.36. As
you move from left to right along this line, a change of 
units in the 
vertical direction corresponds to a change of 
units in the horizontal
direction. These two changes are denoted by the symbols
the change in y
and
the change in x.
(The symbol 
is the Greek capital letter delta, and the symbols 
and 
are
read as “delta y” and “delta x.”) The ratio of 
to 
represents the slope of the
line that passes through the points 
and 
Be sure you see that 
represents a single number, not the product of two 
numbers 
and x). The same is true for 
When this formula is used for slope, the order of subtraction is important.
Given two points on a line, you are free to label either one of them as 
and the other as 
However, once you have done this, you must form the
numerator and denominator using the same order of subtraction.
For instance, the slope of the line passing through the points 
and 
can
be calculated as

per share in terms of the year. Then predict the cash flow for 2006.
(Source: Ruby

SOLUTION

represent 2004. Then the two given values are represented
by the data points 
and 
The slope of the line through these
points is 
Using the point-slope form, you can find the equation that relates the cash flow y
and the year t to be 
According to this equation, the cash flow
in 2006 was $2.79, as shown in Figure 1.39. (In this case, the prediction is fairly
good—the actual cash flow in 2006 was $2.96.)
✓CHECKPOINT 6

2006. (Source: Energizer Holdings, Inc.) ■
The prediction method illustrated in Example 6 is called linear extrapolation.
Note in Figure 1.40(a) that an extrapolated point does not lie between the 
given points. When the estimated point lies between two given points, as shown in
Figure 1.40(b), the procedure is called linear interpolation.
Because the slope of a vertical line is not defined, its equation cannot be 
written in slope-intercept form. However, every line has an equation that can be
written in the general form
where A and B are not both zero. For instance, the vertical line given by 
can be represented by the general form

Extended Application: Linear Depreciation
Most business expenses can be deducted the same year they occur. One exception
to this is the cost of property that has a useful life of more than 1 year, such as
buildings, cars, or equipment. Such costs must be depreciated over the useful life
of the property. If the same amount is depreciated each year, the procedure is
called linear depreciation or straight-line depreciation. The book value is the
difference between the original value and the total amount of depreciation 
accumulated to date.

Functions

■Decide whether relations between two variables are functions.
■Find the domains and ranges of functions.
■Use function notation and evaluate functions.
■Combine functions to create other functions.
■Find inverse functions algebraically.
Functions
In many common relationships between two variables, the value of one of the
variables depends on the value of the other variable. For example, the sales tax on
an item depends on its selling price, the distance an object moves in a given
amount of time depends on its speed, the price of mailing a package with an
overnight delivery service depends on the package’s weight, and the area of a 
circle depends on its radius.
Consider the relationship between the area of a circle and its radius. This
relationship can be expressed by the equation
In this equation, the value of A depends on the choice of r. Because of this, A is
the dependent variable and r is the independent variable.
Most of the relationships that you will study in this course have the property
that for a given value of the independent variable, there corresponds exactly one
value of the dependent variable. Such a relationship is a function.
In Figure 1.43, notice that you can think of a function as a machine that
inputs values of the independent variable and outputs values of the dependent
variable.
Although functions can be described by various means such as tables,
graphs, and diagrams, they are most often specified by formulas or equations. For
instance, the equation
describes y as a function of x. For this function, x is the independent variable and
y is the dependent variable.

Definition of Function
A function is a relationship between two variables such that to each value 
of the independent variable there corresponds exactly one value of the
dependent variable.
The domain of the function is the set of all values of the independent 
variable for which the function is defined. The range of the function is the
set of all values taken on by the dependent variable.

Example 1
Deciding Whether Relations Are Functions
Which of the equations below define y as a function of x?
a.
b.
c.
d.
SOLUTION
To decide whether an equation defines a function, it is helpful to 
isolate the dependent variable on the left side. For instance, to decide whether the
equation 
defines y as a function of x, write the equation in the form
From this form, you can see that for any value of x, there is exactly one value of
y. So, y is a function of x.
Original Equation

Test: Is y a function of x?
a.
Yes, each value of x determines
exactly one value of y.
b.
No, some values of x determine
two values of y.

The procedure used in
Example 1, isolating the
dependent variable on the left
side, is also useful for graphing
equations with a graphing 
utility. In fact, the standard
graphing program on most
graphing utilities is called a
“function grapher.” To graph 
an equation in which is not a
function of 
such as a circle,
you usually have to enter two 
or more equations into the
graphing utility.

The Graph of a Function
When the graph of a function is sketched, the standard convention is to let the
horizontal axis represent the independent variable. When this convention is used,
the test described in Example 1 has a nice graphical interpretation called the 
Vertical Line Test. This test states that if every vertical line intersects the graph
of an equation at most once, then the equation defines y as a function of x. For
instance, in Figure 1.44, the graphs in parts (a) and (c) pass the Vertical Line Test,
but those in parts (b) and (d) do not.
The domain of a function may be described explicitly, or it may be implied
by an equation used to define the function. For example, the function given by
has an implied domain that consists of all real x except 
These two 
values are excluded from the domain because division by zero is undefined.
Another type of implied domain is that used to avoid even roots of negative
numbers, as indicated in Example 2.
Example 2
Finding the Domain and Range of a Function
Find the domain and range of each function.
a.
b.
SOLUTION
a. Because 
is not defined for 
it follows
that the domain of the function is the interval 
or 
To find the
range, observe that 
is never negative. Moreover, as x takes on the
various values in the domain, y takes on all nonnegative values. So, the range
is the interval 
or 
The graph of the function, shown in Figure
1.45(a), confirms these results.
b. Because this function is defined for 
and for 
the domain is 
the entire set of real numbers. This function is called a piecewise-defined
function because it is defined by two or more equations over a specified
domain. When 
the function behaves as in part (a). For 
the value
of 
is positive, and therefore the range of the function is 
or 
as shown in Figure 1.45(b).
A function is one-to-one if to each value of the dependent variable in the
range there corresponds exactly one value of the independent variable. For
instance, the function in Example 2(a) is one-to-one, whereas the function in
Example 2(b) is not one-to-one.
Geometrically, a function is one-to-one if every horizontal line intersects 
the graph of the function at most once. This geometrical interpretation is the 
Horizontal Line Test for one-to-one functions. So, a graph that represents a one-
to-one function must satisfy both the Vertical Line Test and the Horizontal Line
Test.

Functions, Graphs, and Limits
Function Notation
When using an equation to define a function, you generally isolate the dependent
variable on the left. For instance, writing the equation 
as
indicates that y is the dependent variable. In function notation, this equation has
the form
Function notation
The independent variable is x, and the name of the function is “f.” The symbol
is read as “f of x,” and it denotes the value of the dependent variable. For
instance, the value of f when 
is
The value 
is called a function value, and it lies in the range of f. This means
that the point 
lies on the graph of f. One of the advantages of function
notation is that it allows you to be less wordy. For instance, instead of asking
“What is the value of y when 
” you can ask “What is 
”

cost $60 to produce. To encourage large orders from distrib-
utors, the manufacturer will reduce the price by $0.01 per
unit for each unit in excess of 100 units. (For example, an
order of 101 units would have a price of $89.99 per unit, and

■Find limits of functions graphically and numerically.
■Use the properties of limits to evaluate limits of functions.
■Use different analytic techniques to evaluate limits of functions.
■Evaluate one-sided limits.
■Recognize unbounded behavior of functions.
The Limit of a Function
In everyday language, people refer to a speed limit, a wrestler’s weight limit, the
limit of one’s endurance, or stretching a spring to its limit. These phrases all 
suggest that a limit is a bound, which on some occasions may not be reached but
on other occasions may be reached or exceeded.
Consider a spring that will break only if a weight of 10 pounds or more is
attached. To determine how far the spring will stretch without breaking, you
could attach increasingly heavier weights and measure the spring length s for
each weight w, as shown in Figure 1.51. If the spring length approaches a value
of L, then it is said that “the limit of s as w approaches 10 is L.” A mathematical
limit is much like the limit of a spring. The notation for a limit is
which is read as “the limit of 
as x approaches c is L.”

There are three important ideas to learn from Examples 1 and 2.
1. Saying that the limit of 
approaches L as x approaches c means that the
value of 
may be made arbitrarily close to the number L by choosing x
closer and closer to c.
2. For a limit to exist, you must allow x to approach c from either side of c. 
If 
approaches a different number as x approaches c from the left than it
does as x approaches c from the right, then the limit does not exist. [See
Example 2(b).]
3. The value of 
when 
has no bearing on the existence or nonexistence
of the limit of 
as x approaches c. For instance, in Example 2(a), the limit of
exists as x approaches 1 even though the function f is not defined at 
Properties of Limits
Many times the limit of 
as x approaches c is simply 
as shown in
Example 1. Whenever the limit of 
as x approaches c is
Substitute c for x.
the limit can be evaluated by direct substitution. (In the next section, you will
learn that a function that has this property is continuous at c.) It is important that
you learn to recognize the types of functions that have this property. Some basic
ones are given in the following list.

Functions, Graphs, and Limits
Techniques for Evaluating Limits
Many techniques for evaluating limits are based on the following important
theorem. Basically, the theorem states that if two functions agree at all but a
single point 
then they have identical limit behavior at 
To apply the Replacement Theorem, you can use a result from algebra which
states that for a polynomial function 
if and only if 
is a factor
of 
This concept is demonstrated in Example 4.
Example 4
Finding the Limit of a Function
Find the limit:
SOLUTION
Note that the numerator and denominator are zero when 
This
implies that 
is a factor of both, and you can divide out this like factor.
Factor numerator.
Divide out like factor.
Simplify.
So, the rational function 
and the polynomial function
agree for all values of x other than 
and you can apply the
Replacement Theorem.
Figure 1.54 illustrates this result graphically. Note that the two graphs are
identical except that the graph of g contains the point 
whereas this point is
missing on the graph of f. (In the graph of f in Figure 1.54, the missing point is
denoted by an open dot.)

When you try to evaluate a 
limit and both the numerator
and denominator are zero,
remember that you must rewrite
the fraction so that the new
denominator does not have 0 
as its limit. One way to do this
is to divide out like factors, as
shown in Example 5. Another
technique is to rationalize 
the numerator, as shown in 
Example 6.

CHAPTER 1
Functions, Graphs, and Limits
One-Sided Limits
In Example 2(b), you saw that one way in which a limit can fail to exist is when
a function approaches a different value from the left of c than it approaches from
the right of c. This type of behavior can be described more concisely with the
concept of a one-sided limit.
Limit from the left
Limit from the right
The first of these two limits is read as “the limit of 
as x approaches c from
the left is L.” The second is read as “the limit of 
as x approaches c from the
right is L.”
Example 7

Example 9 shows a limit that fails to exist because the limits from the left and

increases or decreases without bound as x approaches c.

An Unbounded Function
Find the limit (if possible).
SOLUTION
From Figure 1.59, you can see that 
decreases without bound as
x approaches 2 from the left and 
increases without bound as x approaches 2
from the right. Symbolically, you can write this as
and
Because f is unbounded as x approaches 2, the limit does not exist.

■Use compound interest models to solve real-life problems.
Continuity
In mathematics, the term “continuous” has much the same meaning as it does in
everyday use. To say that a function is continuous at 
means that there is no
interruption in the graph of f at c. The graph of f is unbroken at 
and there are
no holes, jumps, or gaps. As simple as this concept may seem, its precise defini-
tion eluded mathematicians for many years. In fact, it was not until the early
1800’s that a precise definition was finally developed.
Before looking at this definition, consider the function whose graph is shown
in Figure 1.60. This figure identifies three values of x at which the function f is
not continuous.
1. At 
is not defined.
2. At 
does not exist.
3. At 
At all other points in the interval 
the graph of f is uninterrupted, which
implies that the function f is continuous at all other points in the interval 
Roughly, you can say that a function is continuous on an interval if its graph
on the interval can be traced using a pencil and paper without lifting the pencil
from the paper, as shown in Figure 1.61.

Continuity of Polynomial and Rational Functions
1. A polynomial function is continuous at every real number.
2. A rational function is continuous at every number in its domain.
In Section 1.5, you studied several types of functions that meet the three con-
ditions for continuity. Specifically, if direct substitution can be used to evaluate
the limit of a function at c, then the function is continuous at c. Two types of 
functions that have this property are polynomial functions and rational functions.

Polynomial functions are one of the most important types of functions used
in calculus. Be sure you see from Example 1 that the graph of a polynomial
function is continuous on the entire real line, and therefore has no holes, jumps,
or gaps. Rational functions, on the other hand, need not be continuous on the
entire real line, as shown in Example 2.

Most graphing utilities
can draw graphs in two
different modes: connected
mode and dot mode. The
connected mode works well 
as long as the function is 
continuous on the entire inter-
val represented by the viewing
window. If, however, the 
function is not continuous at
one or more -values in the
viewing window, then the
connected mode may try to
“connect” parts of the graphs
that should not be connected.
For instance, try graphing the
function

Consider an open interval I that contains a real number c. If a function f
is defined on I (except possibly at c), and f is not continuous at c, then f is said 
to have a discontinuity at c. Discontinuities fall into two categories: removable
and nonremovable. A discontinuity at c is called removable if f can be made 
continuous by appropriately defining (or redefining) 
For instance, the 
function in Example 2(b) has a removable discontinuity at 
To remove the
discontinuity, all you need to do is redefine the function so that

Continuity on a Closed Interval
The intervals discussed in Examples 1 and 2 are open. To discuss continuity on 
a closed interval, you can use the concept of one-sided limits, as defined in
Section 1.5.
Similar definitions can be made to cover continuity on intervals of the form 
and 
or on infinite intervals. For example, the function
is continuous on the infinite interval

Notice that the domain of f is the set 
Moreover, f is 
continuous from the left at 
because
For all 
the function f satisfies the three conditions for continuity. So,
you can conclude that f is continuous on the interval 
as shown in

The Greatest Integer Function
Many functions that are used in business applications are step functions.
For instance, the function in Example 9 in Section 1.5 is a step function. The
greatest integer function is another example of a step function. This function is
denoted by
greatest integer less than or equal to x.
For example,
greatest integer less than or equal to 
greatest integer less than or equal to 
greatest integer less than or equal to 
Note that the graph of the greatest integer function (Figure 1.66) jumps up one
unit at each integer. This implies that the function is not continuous at each 
integer.
In real-life applications, the domain of the greatest integer function is often
restricted to nonnegative values of x. In such cases this function serves the 
purpose of truncating the decimal portion of x. For example, 1.345 is truncated
to 1 and 3.57 is truncated to 3. That is,

utility, you must be familiar with the utility’s programming language.

functions. One is IPart
and it yields the truncated integer part of 
For
example, IPart

The other function is Int
which is the greatest integer function. The graphs of these two functions are

Extended Application: Compound Interest
Banks and other financial institutions differ on how interest is paid to an account.
If the interest is added to the account so that future interest is paid on previously
earned interest, then the interest is said to be compounded. Suppose, for 
example, that you deposited $10,000 in an account that pays 6% interest,
compounded quarterly. Because the 6% is the annual interest rate, the quarterly
rate is 
or 1.5%. The balances during the first five quarters are
shown below.

Algebra Review
Order of Operations
Much of the algebra in this chapter involves evaluation of algebraic expressions.  When
you evaluate an algebraic expression, you need to know the priorities assigned to different
operations. These priorities are called the order of operations.
1. Perform operations inside symbols of grouping or absolute value symbols, starting with
the innermost symbol.
2. Evaluate all exponential expressions.
3. Perform all multiplications and divisions from left to right.
4. Perform all additions and subtractions from left to right.

Functions, Graphs, and Limits
Solving Equations
A second algebraic skill in this chapter is solving an equation in one variable.
1. To solve a linear equation, you can add or subtract the same quantity from each side of
the equation. You can also multiply or divide each side of the equation by the same
nonzero quantity.
2. To solve a quadratic equation, you can take the square root of each side, use factoring,
or use the Quadratic Formula.
3. To solve a radical equation, isolate the radical on one side of the equation and square
each side of the equation.
4. To solve an absolute value equation, use the definition of absolute value to rewrite the
equation as two equations.
Example 2

The equations in Example

you have a graphing utility, try
using it to solve graphically the

You should be aware that
solving radical equations can
sometimes lead to extraneous

Study Strategies
■Use a Graphing Utility
A graphing calculator or graphing software for a computer can help you in this course in two
important ways. As an exploratory device, a graphing utility allows you to learn concepts by allowing you to compare 
graphs of equations. For instance, sketching the graphs of 
and 
helps confirm that adding 
(or subtracting) a constant to (or from) a function shifts the graph of the function vertically. As a problem-solving tool, a 
graphing utility frees you of some of the drudgery of sketching complicated graphs by hand. The time that you save can be
spent using mathematics to solve real-life problems.
■Use the Skills Review Exercises
Each exercise set in this text begins with a set of skills review exercises. We urge you
to begin each homework session by quickly working all of these exercises (all are answered in the back of the text). The “old”
skills covered in these exercises are needed to master the “new” skills in the section exercise set. The skills review exercises
remind you that mathematics is cumulative—to be successful in this course, you must retain “old” skills.
■Use the Additional Study Aids
The additional study aids were prepared specifically to help you master the concepts 
discussed in the text. They are the Student Solutions Guide, student website, and the Graphing Technology Guide.

Differentiation
Higher-order derivatives are used to determine the acceleration function of a 
sports car. The acceleration function shows the changes in the car’s velocity. As 
the car reaches its “cruising”speed, is the acceleration increasing or decreasing?
(See Section 2.6, Exercise 45.)
Differentiation has many real-life applications. The applications
listed below represent a sample of the applications in this chapter.

Tangent Line to a Graph
Calculus is a branch of mathematics that studies rates of change of functions. In
this course, you will learn that rates of change have many applications in real life.
In Section 1.3, you learned how the slope of a line indicates the rate at which the
line rises or falls. For a line, this rate (or slope) is the same at every point on the
line. For graphs other than lines, the rate at which the graph rises or falls changes
from point to point. For instance, in Figure 2.1, the parabola is rising more
quickly at the point 
than it is at the point 
At the vertex 
the
graph levels off, and at the point 
the graph is falling.
To determine the rate at which a graph rises or falls at a single point, you can
find the slope of the tangent line at the point. In simple terms, the tangent line to
the graph of a function f at a point 
is the line that best approximates the
graph at that point, as shown in Figure 2.1. Figure 2.2 shows other examples of
tangent lines.
FIGURE 2.2
Tangent Line to a Graph at a Point
When Isaac Newton (1642–1727) was working on the “tangent line
problem,” he realized that it is difficult to define precisely what is meant by a
tangent to a general curve. From geometry, you know that a line is tangent to a
circle if the line intersects the circle at only one point, as shown in Figure 2.3.
Tangent lines to a noncircular graph, however, can intersect the graph at more
than one point. For instance, in the second graph in Figure 2.2, if the tangent line
were extended, it would intersect the graph at a point other than the point of tan-
gency. In this section, you will see how the notion of a limit can be used to define
a general tangent line.

Slope of a Graph
Because a tangent line approximates the graph at a point, the problem of finding
the slope of a graph at a point becomes one of finding the slope of the tangent line
at the point.
Example 1
Approximating the Slope of a Graph
Use the graph in Figure 2.4 to approximate the slope of the graph of 
at
the point 
SOLUTION
From the graph of 
you can see that the tangent line at
rises approximately two units for each unit change in x. So, the slope of the
tangent line at 
is given by
Because the tangent line at the point 
has a slope of about 2, you can 
conclude that the graph has a slope of about 2 at the point 
Example 2
Interpreting Slope
Figure 2.5 graphically depicts the average monthly temperature (in degrees
Fahrenheit) in Duluth, Minnesota. Estimate the slope of this graph at the indi-
cated point and give a physical interpretation of the result. (Source: National
Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration)
SOLUTION
From the graph, you can see that the tangent line at the given point
falls approximately 28 units for each two-unit change in x. So, you can estimate
the slope at the given point to be
degrees per month.
This means that you can expect the average daily temperatures in November to
be about 14 degrees lower than the corresponding temperatures in October.

When visually approximating the slope of a graph, note that the scales on the
horizontal and vertical axes may differ. When this happens (as it frequently
does in applications), the slope of the tangent line is distorted, and you must
be careful to account for the difference in scales.

Slope and the Limit Process
In Examples 1 and 2, you approximated the slope of a graph at a point by mak-
ing a careful graph and then “eyeballing” the tangent line at the point of tangency.
A more precise method of approximating the slope of a tangent line makes use of
a secant line through the point of tangency and a second point on the graph, as
shown in Figure 2.6. If 
is the point of tangency and 
is a second point on the graph of f, then the slope of the secant line through the
two points is
Slope of secant line
The right side of this equation is called the difference quotient. The denominator
is the change in x, and the numerator is the change in y. The beauty 
of this procedure is that you obtain more and more accurate approximations of the
slope of the tangent line by choosing points closer and closer to the point of
tangency, as shown in Figure 2.7. Using the limit process, you can find the exact
slope of the tangent line at 
which is also the slope of the graph of at

Algebra Review

It is important that you see the distinction between the ways the difference
quotients were set up in Examples 3 and 4. In Example 3, you were finding the
slope of a graph at a specific point 
To find the slope, you can use the
following form of a difference quotient.
Slope at specific point
In Example 4, however, you were finding a formula for the slope at any point on
the graph. In such cases, you should use x, rather than c, in the difference quotient.
Formula for slope
Except for linear functions, this form will always produce a function of x, which
can then be evaluated to find the slope at any desired point.

Differentiation
Differentiability and Continuity
Not every function is differentiable. Figure 2.11 shows some common situations
in which a function will not be differentiable at a point—vertical tangent lines,
discontinuities, and sharp turns in the graph. Each of the functions shown in
Figure 2.11 is differentiable at every value of x except
FIGURE 2.11
Functions That Are Not Differentiable at 
In Figure 2.11, you can see that all but one of the functions are continuous at
but none are differentiable there. This shows that continuity is not a strong
enough condition to guarantee differentiability. On the other hand, if a function is
differentiable at a point, then it must be continuous at that point. This important
result is stated in the following theorem.

Note in Figure 2.12 that the Constant Rule is equivalent to saying that the

■Use derivatives to answer questions about real-life situations.
The Constant Rule
In Section 2.1, you found derivatives by the limit process. This process is tedious,
even for simple functions, but fortunately there are rules that greatly simplify
differentiation. These rules allow you to calculate derivatives without the direct
use of limits.

Let

Informally, the Constant Multiple Rule states that constants can be factored
out of the differentiation process.
The usefulness of this rule is often overlooked, especially when the constant
appears in the denominator, as shown below.
To use the Constant Multiple Rule efficiently, look for constants that can be 
factored out before differentiating. For example,

The Sum and Difference Rules
The next two rules are ones that you might expect to be true, and you may have
used them without thinking about it. For instance, if you were asked to differen-
tiate 
you would probably write
without questioning your answer. The validity of differentiating a sum or differ-
ence of functions term by term is given by the Sum and Difference Rules.
PROOF
Let 
Then, you can prove the Sum Rule as shown.

So,
The Difference Rule can be proved in a similar manner.
The Sum and Difference Rules can be extended to the sum or difference of
any finite number of functions. For instance, if

Some Rules for Differentiation
133
With the four differentiation rules listed in this section, you can differentiate
any polynomial function.
Example 8
Using the Sum and Difference Rules
Find the slope of the graph of 
at the point 
SOLUTION
The derivative of 
is
So, the slope of the graph of f at 
is
as shown in Figure 2.15.
✓CHECKPOINT 8
Find the slope of the graph of 
at the point 
■
Example 8 illustrates the use of the derivative for determining the shape of a
graph. A rough sketch of the graph of 
might lead you to think
that the point 
is a minimum point of the graph. After finding the slope at
this point to be 
however, you can conclude that the minimum point (where
the slope is 0) is farther to the right. (You will study techniques for finding
minimum and maximum points in Section 3.2.)
Example 9
Using the Sum and Difference Rules
Find an equation of the tangent line to the graph of
at the point 
SOLUTION
The derivative of 
is 
which implies
that the slope of the graph at the point 
is
as shown in Figure 2.16. Using the point-slope form, you can write the equation
of the tangent line at

Modeling Revenue
From 2000 through 2005, the revenue R (in millions of dollars per year) for
Microsoft Corporation can be modeled by
where represents the year, with 
corresponding to 2000. At what rate was
Microsoft’s revenue changing in 2001?
(Source: Microsoft Corporation)
SOLUTION
One way to answer this question is to find the derivative of the 
revenue model with respect to time.
In 2001 (when 
), the rate of change of the revenue with respect to time is
given by
Because R is measured in millions of dollars and t is measured in years, it follows
that the derivative 
is measured in millions of dollars per year. So, at the end
of 2001, Microsoft’s revenue was increasing at a rate of about $2813 million per
year, as shown in Figure 2.17.

Average Rate of Change
In Sections 2.1 and 2.2, you studied the two primary applications of derivatives.
1. Slope The derivative of f is a function that gives the slope of the graph of f at
a point 
2. Rate of Change The derivative of f is a function that gives the rate of change
of 
with respect to x at the point 
In this section, you will see that there are many real-life applications of rates of
change. A few are velocity, acceleration, population growth rates, unemployment
rates, production rates, and water flow rates. Although rates of change often
involve change with respect to time, you can investigate the rate of change of one
variable with respect to any other related variable.
When determining the rate of change of one variable with respect to another,
you must be careful to distinguish between average and instantaneous rates of
change. The distinction between these two rates of change is comparable to the
distinction between the slope of the secant line through two points on a graph and
the slope of the tangent line at one point on the graph.

CHAPTER 2
Differentiation
A common application of an average rate of change is to find the average
velocity of an object that is moving in a straight line. That is,
This formula is demonstrated in Example 2.
Example 2
Finding an Average Velocity
If a free-falling object is dropped from a height of 100 feet, and air resistance is
neglected, the height h (in feet) of the object at time t (in seconds) is given by 
(See Figure 2.20.)
Find the average velocity of the object over each interval.
a.
b.
c.
SOLUTION
You can use the position equation 
to determine
the heights at 
and 
as shown in the table.
a. For the interval 
the object falls from a height of 84 feet to a height of
36 feet. So, the average velocity is
feet per second.

Instantaneous Rate of Change and Velocity
Suppose in Example 2 you wanted to find the rate of change of h at the instant
second. Such a rate is called an instantaneous rate of change. You can
approximate the instantaneous rate of change at 
by calculating the average
rate of change over smaller and smaller intervals of the form 
as
shown in the table. From the table, it seems reasonable to conclude that the
instantaneous rate of change of the height when

feet per second.

Position function
The general position function for a free-falling object, neglecting air
resistance, is
where h is the height (in feet), t is the time (in seconds),
is the initial velocity
(in feet per second), and 
is the initial height (in feet). Remember that the 
model assumes that positive velocities indicate upward motion and negative
velocities indicate downward motion. The derivative 
is the
velocity function. The absolute value of the velocity is the speed of the object.
Example 4

a diver jumps from a diving board that is 32 feet high, as shown in

Rates of Change in Economics: Marginals
Another important use of rates of change is in the field of economics. Economists
refer to marginal profit, marginal revenue, and marginal cost as the rates of
change of the profit, revenue, and cost with respect to the number x of units 
produced or sold. An equation that relates these three quantities is
where P, R, and C represent the following quantities.
total profit
total revenue
and
total cost
The derivatives of these quantities are called the marginal profit, marginal 
revenue, and marginal cost, respectively.
In many business and economics problems, the number of units produced or
sold is restricted to positive integer values, as indicated in Figure 2.22(a). (Of
course, it could happen that a sale involves half or quarter units, but it is hard to
conceive of a sale involving 
units.) The variable that denotes such units is
called a discrete variable. To analyze a function of a discrete variable x, you can
temporarily assume that x is a continuous variable and is able to take on any real
value in a given interval, as indicated in Figure 2.22(b). Then, you can use the
methods of calculus to find the x-value that corresponds to the marginal revenue,
maximum profit, minimum cost, or whatever is called for. Finally, you should
round the solution to the nearest sensible x-value—cents, dollars, units, or days,
depending on the context of the problem.

Finding the Marginal Profit
The profit derived from selling x units of an alarm clock is given by
a. Find the marginal profit for a production level of 50 units.
b. Compare this with the actual gain in profit obtained by increasing the 
production level from 50 to 51 units.

So, the additional profit obtained by increasing the production level from 50
to 51 units is
Extra profit for one unit
Note that the actual profit increase of $11.53 (when x increases from 50 to 51
units) can be approximated by the marginal profit of $11.50 per unit (when
), as shown in Figure 2.23.
✓CHECKPOINT 5

The profit function in Example 5 is unusual in that the profit continues to
increase as long as the number of units sold increases. In practice, it is more com-
mon to encounter situations in which sales can be increased only by lowering the
price per item. Such reductions in price will ultimately cause the profit to decline.
The number of units x that consumers are willing to purchase at a given price
per unit p is given by the demand function
The total revenue R is then related to the price per unit and the quantity demanded
(or sold) by the equation
Example 6
Finding a Demand Function
A business sells 2000 items per month at a price of $10 each. It is estimated that
monthly sales will increase 250 units for each $0.25 reduction in price. Use this
information to find the demand function and total revenue function.
SOLUTION
From the given estimate, x increases 250 units each time p drops
$0.25 from the original cost of $10. This is described by the equation
Solving for p in terms of x produces
Demand function
This, in turn, implies that the revenue function is

CHAPTER 2
Differentiation
Modeling a Demand Function
To model a demand function, you need data that indicate how many 
units of a product will sell at a given price. As you might imagine, such
data are not easy to obtain for a new product. After a product has been on the
market awhile, however, its sales history can provide the necessary data.
As an example, consider the two bar graphs shown below. From these
graphs, you can see that from 2001 through 2005, the number of prerecorded
DVDs sold increased from about 300 million to about 1100 million. During
that time, the price per unit dropped from an average price of about $18 to an
average price of about $15.
(Source: Kagan Research, LLC)
The information in the two bar graphs is combined in the table, where x
represents the units sold (in millions) and p represents the price (in dollars).
By entering the ordered pairs 
into a graphing utility, you can find
that the power model for the demand for prerecorded DVDs is:

Writing a demand function in the form 
is a convention used in 
economics. From a consumer’s point of view, it might seem more reasonable
to think that the quantity demanded is a function of the price. Mathematically,
however, the two points of view are equivalent because a typical demand
function is one-to-one and so has an inverse function. For instance, in
Example 7, you could write the demand function as x  60,000  20,000p.

is simply the sum or difference of their derivatives. The rules for the derivative of
a product or quotient of two functions are not as simple.
PROOF
Some mathematical proofs, such as the proof of the Sum Rule, are
straightforward. Others involve clever steps that may not appear to follow clearly
from a prior step. The proof below involves such a step—adding and subtracting
the same quantity. (This step is shown in color.) Let

that the Constant Multiple Rule deals with the product of a constant and a 
variable quantity:

whereas the Product Rule deals with the product of two variable quantities:

The Quotient Rule
The derivative of the quotient of two differentiable functions is equal to 
the denominator times the derivative of the numerator minus the numerator
times the derivative of the denominator, all divided by the square of the
denominator.

Not every quotient needs to be differentiated by the Quotient Rule. For
instance, each of the quotients in the next example can be considered as the
product of a constant and a function of x. In such cases, the Constant Multiple

In the examples in this section, much of the work in obtaining the final form
of the derivative occurs after the differentiation. As summarized in the list below,
direct application of differentiation rules often yields results that are not in
simplified form. Note that two characteristics of simplified form are the absence
of negative exponents and the combining of like terms.

and back through the veins, the systolic blood pressure continuously drops.
Consider a person whose systolic blood pressure P (in millimeters of mercury) is
given by
where t is measured in seconds. At what rate is the blood pressure changing 
5 seconds after blood leaves the heart?

Section 2.5
The Chain Rule
■Find derivatives using the Chain Rule.
■Find derivatives using the General Power Rule.
■Write derivatives in simplified form.
■Use derivatives to answer questions about real-life situations.
■Use the differentiation rules to differentiate algebraic functions.
The Chain Rule
In this section, you will study one of the most powerful rules of differential
calculus—the Chain Rule. This differentiation rule deals with composite functions
and adds versatility to the rules presented in Sections 2.2 and 2.4. For example,
compare the functions below. Those on the left can be differentiated without the
Chain Rule, whereas those on the right are best done with the Chain Rule.
Without the Chain Rule
With the Chain Rule
Basically, the Chain Rule states that if y changes 
times as fast as 
and
u changes 
times as fast as 
then changes
times as fast as 
as illustrated in Figure 2.28. One advantage of the 
notation for derivatives is that it helps you remember differentiation rules, such
as the Chain Rule. For instance, in the formula
you can imagine that the du’s divide out.

FIGURE 2.28

When applying the Chain Rule, it helps to think of the composite function
or 
as having two parts—an inside and an outside—as
illustrated below.
The Chain Rule tells you that the derivative of 
is the derivative of the
outer function (at the inner function u) times the derivative of the inner function.
That is,

Examples 1 and 2 show how to find higher-order derivatives of polynomial
functions. Note that with each successive differentiation, the degree of the
polynomial drops by one. Eventually, higher-order derivatives of polynomial
functions degenerate to a constant function. Specifically, the nth-order derivative
of an nth-degree polynomial function
is the constant function
where 
Each derivative of order higher than n is the zero
function. Polynomial functions are the only functions with this characteristic. For
other functions, successive differentiation never produces a constant function.

Acceleration
In Section 2.3, you saw that the velocity of an object moving in a straight path
(neglecting air resistance) is given by the derivative of its position function. In
other words, the rate of change of the position with respect to time is defined to
be the velocity. In a similar way, the rate of change of the velocity with respect to
time is defined to be the acceleration of the object.
To find the position, velocity, or acceleration at a particular time t, substitute the
given value of t into the appropriate function, as illustrated in Example 4.
Example 4
Finding Acceleration
A ball is thrown upward from the top of a 160-foot cliff, as shown in Figure 2.31.
The initial velocity of the ball is 48 feet per second, which implies that the
position function is
where the time t is measured in seconds. Find the height, the velocity, and the
acceleration of the ball when

Acceleration is measured in
units of length per unit of time

velocity is measured in feet per
second, then the acceleration is
measured in “feet per second
squared,” or, more formally, in
“feet per second per second.”
160 ft
Not drawn to scale
FIGURE 2.31

In Example 4, notice that the acceleration of the ball is 
feet per second
squared at any time t. This constant acceleration is due to the gravitational force
of Earth and is called the acceleration due to gravity. Note that the negative
value indicates that the ball is being pulled down—toward Earth.
Although the acceleration exerted on a falling object is relatively constant
near Earth’s surface, it varies greatly throughout our solar system. Large planets
exert a much greater gravitational pull than do small planets or moons. The next
example describes the motion of a free-falling object on the moon.
Example 5
Finding Acceleration on the Moon
An astronaut standing on the surface of the moon throws a rock into the air. The
height s (in feet) of the rock is given by
where t is measured in seconds. How does the acceleration due to gravity on the
moon compare with that on Earth?
SOLUTION
Position function
Velocity function
Acceleration function
So, the acceleration at any time is
feet per second squared
—about one-sixth of the acceleration due to gravity on Earth.
The position function described in Example 5 neglects air resistance, which is
appropriate because the moon has no atmosphere—and no air resistance. This
means that the position function for any free-falling object on the moon is given by
where s is the height (in feet), t is the time (in seconds),
is the initial velocity,
and 
is the initial height. For instance, the rock in  Example 5 was thrown
upward with an initial velocity of 27 feet per second and had an initial height of
6 feet. This position function is valid for all objects, whether heavy ones such as
hammers or light ones such as feathers.
In 1971, astronaut David R. Scott demonstrated the lack of atmosphere on
the moon by dropping a hammer and a feather from the same height. Both took
exactly the same time to fall to the ground. If they were dropped from a height of
6 feet, how long did each take to hit the ground?

The acceleration due to gravity 
on the surface of the moon is only
about one-sixth that exerted by Earth.
So, if you were on the moon and
threw an object into the air, 
it would rise to a greater height 
than it would on Earth’s surface.

intervals are shown in Figure 2.32. Find the velocity and acceleration of the auto-

SOLUTION
To find the acceleration function, differentiate the velocity function.

In the table, note that the acceleration approaches zero as the velocity levels off.
This observation should agree with your experience—when riding in an acceler-
ating automobile, you do not feel the velocity, but you do feel the acceleration. In
other words, you feel changes in velocity.

Explicit and Implicit Functions
So far in this text, most functions involving two variables have been expressed in
the explicit form
That is, one of the two variables has been explicitly
given in terms of the other. For example, in the equation
Explicit form
the variable is explicitly written as a function of 
Some functions, however, are
not given explicitly and are only implied by a given equation, as shown in
Example 1.
Example 1
Finding a Derivative Explicitly

SOLUTION
In this equation, y is implicitly defined as a function of 
One way
to find 
is first to solve the equation for 
then differentiate as usual.
Write original equation.
Solve for y.
Rewrite.
Differentiate with respect to x.
Simplify.
✓CHECKPOINT 1

■
The procedure shown in Example 1 works well whenever you can easily
write the given function explicitly. You cannot, however, use this procedure when
you are unable to solve for y as a function of x. For instance, how would you find
in the equation
where it is very difficult to express y as a function of x explicitly? To do this, you
can use a procedure called implicit differentiation.

Implicit Differentiation
To understand how to find 
implicitly, you must realize that the differentia-
tion is taking place with respect to 
This means that when you differentiate terms
involving alone, you can differentiate as usual. But when you differentiate terms
involving 
you must apply the Chain Rule because you are assuming that 
is
defined implicitly as a differentiable function of 
Study the next example
carefully. Note in particular how the Chain Rule is used to introduce the 
factors in Examples 2(b) and 2(d).

Applying the Chain Rule
Differentiate each expression with respect to x.

SOLUTION
a. The only variable in this expression is 
So, to differentiate with respect to x,
you can use the Simple Power Rule and the Constant Multiple Rule to obtain
b. This case is different. The variable in the expression is 
and yet you are asked
to differentiate with respect to 
To do this, assume that 
is a 
differentiable function of and use the Chain Rule.

Related Variables
In this section, you will study problems involving variables that are changing with
respect to time. If two or more such variables are related to each other, then their
rates of change with respect to time are also related.
For instance, suppose that and are related by the equation 
If both
variables are changing with respect to time, then their rates of change will also be
related.

Guidelines for Solving a Related-Rate Problem
1. Identify all given quantities and all quantities to be determined. 
If possible, make a sketch and label the quantities.
2. Write an equation that relates all variables whose rates of change are
either given or to be determined.
3. Use the Chain Rule to differentiate both sides of the equation with
respect to time.
4. Substitute into the resulting equation all known values of the variables
and their rates of change. Then solve for the required rate of change.
The solution shown in Example 2 illustrates the steps for solving a related-
rate problem.
In Step 2 of the guidelines, note that you must write an equation that relates
the given variables. To help you with this step, reference tables that summarize
many common formulas are included in the appendices. For instance, the volume
of a sphere of radius is given by the formula
as listed in Appendix D.
The table below shows the mathematical models for some common rates of
change that can be used in the first step of the solution of a related-rate problem.

Study Strategies
■Simplify Your Derivatives
Often our students ask if they have to simplify their derivatives. Our answer is “Yes, if you
expect to use them.” In the next chapter, you will see that almost all applications of derivatives require that the derivatives be
written in simplified form. It is not difficult to see the advantage of a derivative in simplified form. Consider, for instance, the
derivative of
The “raw form” produced by the Quotient and Chain Rules
is obviously much more difficult to use than the simplified form
■List Units of Measure in Applied Problems
When using derivatives in real-life applications, be sure to list the units of
measure for each variable. For instance, if 
is measured in dollars and is measured in years, then the derivative 
is
measured in dollars per year.

■Use increasing and decreasing functions to model and solve real-life
problems.
Increasing and Decreasing Functions
A function is increasing if its graph moves up as x moves to the right and
decreasing if its graph moves down as x moves to the right. The following 
definition states this more formally.
The function in Figure 3.1 is decreasing on the interval 
constant on
the interval 
and increasing on the interval 
Actually, from the
definition of increasing and decreasing functions, the function shown in Figure
3.1 is decreasing on the interval 
and increasing on the interval 
This text restricts the discussion to finding open intervals on which a function is
increasing or decreasing.
The derivative of a function can be used to determine whether the function is
increasing or decreasing on an interval.

and increasing on the open interval
SOLUTION
The derivative of f is
On the open interval 
the fact that x is negative implies that 
is
also negative. So, by the test for a decreasing function, you can conclude that f is
decreasing on this interval. Similarly, on the open interval 
the fact that x is
positive implies that 
is also positive. So, it follows that f is increasing
on this interval, as shown in Figure 3.2.

SOLUTION
The derivative of this model is 
For the
open interval 
the derivative is positive. So, the function is increasing,
which implies that the consumption of Italian cheeses was increasing during the
given time period.

Critical Numbers and Their Use
In Example 1, you were given two intervals: one on which the function was
decreasing and one on which it was increasing. Suppose you had been asked to
determine these intervals. To do this, you could have used the fact that for a 
continuous function,
can change signs only at x-values where 
or at
x-values where 
is undefined, as shown in Figure 3.4. These two types of
numbers are called the critical numbers of f.

You can use the trace feature of a graphing utility to 
confirm the result of Example 3. Begin by graphing the
function, as shown at the right. Then activate the trace feature
and move the cursor from left to right. In intervals on which
the function is increasing, note that the -values increase as the
-values increase, whereas in intervals on which the function is
decreasing, the -values decrease as the -values increase.*

The functions in Examples 1 through 4 are continuous on the entire real line.
If there are isolated x-values at which a function is not continuous, then these 
x-values should be used along with the critical numbers to determine the test
intervals. For example, the function
is not continuous when 
Because the derivative of f
is zero when 
you should use the following numbers to determine the test
intervals.
Critical numbers
Discontinuity
After testing 
you can determine that the function is decreasing on the inter-
vals 
and 
and increasing on the intervals 
and 
as
shown in Figure 3.7.
The converse of the test for increasing and decreasing functions is not true.
For instance, it is possible for a function to be increasing on an interval even
though its derivative is not positive at every point in the interval.
Example 5
Testing an Increasing Function

SOLUTION
From the derivative of f
you can see that the only critical number is 
So, the test intervals are
and 
The table summarizes the testing of these two intervals.
From Figure 3.8, you can see that f is increasing on the entire real line, even
though

Relative Extrema
You have used the derivative to determine the intervals on which a function is
increasing or decreasing. In this section, you will examine the points at which a
function changes from increasing to decreasing, or vice versa. At such a point, the
function has a relative extremum. (The plural of extremum is extrema.) The
relative extrema of a function include the relative minima and relative 
maxima of the function. For instance, the function shown in Figure 3.10 has a
relative maximum at the left point and a relative minimum at the right point.
For a continuous function, the relative extrema must occur at critical
numbers of the function, as shown in Figure 3.11.

Let be continuous on the interval 
in which is the only critical
number. If is differentiable on the interval (except possibly at ), then 
can be classified as a relative minimum, a relative maximum, or neither, as
shown.
1. On the interval

to the right of 
then 
is a relative minimum.
2. On the interval

is positive to the left of 
and negative
to the right of 
then 
is a relative maximum.
3. On the interval 
if 
is positive on both sides of 
or

The First-Derivative Test
The discussion on the preceding page implies that in your search for relative
extrema of a continuous function, you only need to test the critical numbers of the
function. Once you have determined that c is a critical number of a function f, the
First-Derivative Test for relative extrema enables you to classify 
as a rela-
tive minimum, a relative maximum, or neither.
A graphical interpretation of the First-Derivative Test is shown in Figure 3.12.

There are several ways to use technology to find relative extrema of a
function. One way is to use a graphing utility to graph the function,
and then use the zoom and trace features to find the relative minimum and
relative maximum points. For instance, consider the graph of
as shown below.
From the graph, you can see that the function has one relative maximum and
one relative minimum. You can approximate these values by zooming in and
using the trace feature, as shown below.
A second way to use technology to find relative extrema is to perform the 
First-Derivative Test with a symbolic differentiation utility. You can use the
utility to differentiate the function, set the derivative equal to zero, and then
solve the resulting equation. After obtaining the critical numbers, 1.48288 
and 0.0870148, you can graph the function and observe that the first yields 
a relative minimum and the second yields a relative maximum. Compare the
two ways shown above with doing the calculations by hand, as shown
below.

Absolute Extrema
The terms relative minimum and relative maximum describe the local behavior of
a function. To describe the global behavior of the function on an entire interval,
you can use the terms absolute maximum and absolute minimum.
Be sure that you understand the distinction between relative extrema and
absolute extrema. For instance, in Figure 3.16, the function has a relative
minimum that also happens to be an absolute minimum on the interval 
The
relative maximum of 
however, is not the absolute maximum on the interval
The next theorem points out that if a continuous function has a closed
interval as its domain, then it must have both an absolute minimum and an
absolute maximum on the interval. From Figure 3.16, note that these extrema can
occur at endpoints of the interval.
FIGURE 3.16
Although a continuous function has just one minimum and one maximum
value on a closed interval, either of these values can occur for more than one 
-value. For instance, on the interval 
the function 
has a
minimum value of zero when 
and when

critical numbers of the function. You can use the guidelines below to find extrema
on a closed interval.

Finding the minimum and maximum values of a function is one of the most
common applications of calculus.
Example 5
Finding the Maximum Profit
Recall the fast-food restaurant in Examples 7 and 8 in Section 2.3. The restau-
rant’s profit function for hamburgers is given by
Find the sales level that yields a maximum profit.
SOLUTION
To begin, find an equation for marginal profit. Then set the marginal
profit equal to zero and solve for x.
Find marginal profit.
Set marginal profit equal to 0.
Subtract 2.44 from each side.
Critical number
From Figure 3.19, you can see that the critical number 
corresponds
to the sales level that yields a maximum profit. To find the maximum profit,
substitute 
into the profit function.

■Find the points of diminishing returns of input-output models.
Concavity
You already know that locating the intervals over which a function f increases or
decreases is helpful in determining its graph. In this section, you will see that 
locating the intervals on which 
increases or decreases can determine where the
graph of f is curving upward or curving downward. This property of curving
upward or downward is defined formally as the concavity of the graph of the
function.
From Figure 3.20, you can observe the following graphical interpretation of 
concavity.
1. A curve that is concave upward lies above its tangent line.
2. A curve that is concave downward lies below its tangent line.
This visual test for concavity is useful when the graph of a function is given. To
determine concavity without seeing a graph, you need an analytic test. It turns out
that you can use the second derivative to determine these intervals in much the
same way that you use the first derivative to determine the intervals on which f is
increasing or decreasing.

For a continuous function f, you can find the open intervals on which the

that is not continuous, the test intervals should be formed using points of discon-
tinuity, along with the points at which 
is zero or undefined.]

CHAPTER 3
Applications of the Derivative
Definition of Point of Inflection
If the graph of a continuous function has a tangent line at a point where its
concavity changes from upward to downward (or downward to upward), then
the point is a point of inflection.
Points of Inflection
If the tangent line to a graph exists at a point at which the concavity changes, then
the point is a point of inflection. Three examples of inflection points are shown
in Figure 3.24. (Note that the third graph has a vertical tangent line at its point of
inflection.)
FIGURE 3.24
The graph crosses its tangent line at a point of inflection.
Because a point of inflection occurs where the concavity of a graph changes,
it must be true that at such points the sign of 
changes. So, to locate possible
points of inflection, you only need to determine the values of for which 
or for which 
does not exist. This parallels the procedure for locating the
relative extrema of by determining the critical numbers of f.

Finding Points of Inflection
Discuss the concavity of the graph of f and find its points of inflection.
SOLUTION
Begin by finding the second derivative of f.
Write original function.
Find first derivative.
Find second derivative.

From this, you can see that the possible points of inflection occur at 
and
After testing the intervals 
and 
you can
determine that the graph is concave upward on

you can conclude that the graph has points of inflection at these

It is possible for the second derivative to be zero at a point that is not a point
of inflection. For example, compare the graphs of

shown in Figure 3.26. Both second derivatives are zero when

The Second-Derivative Test
The second derivative can be used to perform a simple test for relative minima
and relative maxima. If f is a function such that 
and the graph of f is 
concave upward at 
then 
is a relative minimum of f. Similarly, if f is a
function such that 
and the graph of f is concave downward at 
then 
is a relative maximum of f, as shown in Figure 3.27.

SOLUTION
Begin by finding the first derivative of f.
From this derivative, you can see that 
and 
are the only 
critical numbers of f. Using the second derivative
you can apply the Second-Derivative Test, as shown.

Because the test fails at

that the point

for concavity would show that this point is a point of inflection. The graph of f is

Extended Application: Diminishing Returns
In economics, the notion of concavity is related to the concept of diminishing
returns. Consider a function
where x measures input (in dollars) and y measures output (in dollars). In Figure
3.29, notice that the graph of this function is concave upward on the interval 
and is concave downward on the interval 
On the interval 
each addi-
tional dollar of input returns more than the previous input dollar. By contrast, on
the interval 
each additional dollar of input returns less than the previous
input dollar. The point 
is called the point of diminishing returns. An
increased investment beyond this point is usually considered a poor use of capital.
Example 5
Exploring Diminishing Returns
By increasing its advertising cost 
(in thousands of dollars) for a product, a
company discovers that it can increase the sales 
(in thousands of dollars)
according to the model
Find the point of diminishing returns for this product.
SOLUTION
Begin by finding the first and second derivatives.
First derivative
Second derivative
The second derivative is zero only when 
By testing the intervals 
and 
you can conclude that the graph has a point of diminishing returns
when 
as shown in Figure 3.30. So, the point of diminishing returns for
this product occurs when $20,000 is spent on advertising.

individual or group to fraudulently acquire information by
masquerading as a trustworthy person or business in an
electronic communication. Criminals create spoof sites on
the Internet to trick victims into giving them information.

■Solve real-life optimization problems.
Solving Optimization Problems
One of the most common applications of calculus is the determination of
optimum (minimum or maximum) values. Before learning a general method for
solving optimization problems, consider the next example.
Example 1
Finding the Maximum Volume
A manufacturer wants to design an open box that has a square base and a surface
area of 108 square inches, as shown in Figure 3.31. What dimensions will
produce a box with a maximum volume?
SOLUTION
Because the base of the box is square, the volume is
Primary equation
This equation is called the primary equation because it gives a formula for the
quantity to be optimized. The surface area of the box is 
Secondary equation
Because V is to be optimized, it helps to express V as a function of just one 
variable. To do this, solve the secondary equation for h in terms of x to obtain
and substitute into the primary equation.
Function of one variable
Before finding which x-value yields a maximum value of V, you need to deter-
mine the feasible domain of the function. That is, what values of x make sense in
the problem? Because x must be nonnegative and the area of the base 
is
at most 108, you can conclude that the feasible domain is
Feasible domain
Using the techniques described in the first three sections of this chapter, you can
determine that on the interval 
this function has an absolute
maximum when

CHAPTER 3
Applications of the Derivative
In studying Example 1, be sure that you understand the basic question that it
asks. Some students have trouble with optimization problems because they are
too eager to start solving the problem by using a standard formula. For instance,
in Example 1, you should realize that there are infinitely many open boxes 
having 108 square inches of surface area. You might begin to solve this problem
by asking yourself which basic shape would seem to yield a maximum volume.
Should the box be tall, squat, or nearly cubical? You might even try calculating a
few volumes, as shown in Figure 3.32, to see if you can get a good feeling for
what the optimum dimensions should be.
FIGURE 3.32
Which box has the greatest volume?
There are several steps in the solution of Example 1. The first step is to
sketch a diagram and identify all known quantities and all quantities to be deter-
mined. The second step is to write a primary equation for the quantity to be 
optimized. Then, a secondary equation is used to rewrite the primary equation as
a function of one variable. Finally, calculus is used to determine the optimum
value. These steps are summarized below.

Guidelines for Solving Optimization Problems
1. Identify all given quantities and all quantities to be determined. If possible,
make a sketch.
2. Write a primary equation for the quantity that is to be maximized or min-
imized. (A summary of several common formulas is given in Appendix D.)
3. Reduce the primary equation to one having a single independent variable.
This may involve the use of a secondary equation that relates the
independent variables of the primary equation.
4. Determine the feasible domain of the primary equation. That is, determine
the values for which the stated problem makes sense.
5. Determine the desired maximum or minimum value by the calculus
techniques discussed in Sections 3.1 through 3.3.

Remember that you are not
ready to begin solving an 
optimization problem until you
have clearly identified what the
problem is. Once you are sure
you understand what is being
asked, you are ready to begin
considering a method for 
solving the problem.
S T U D Y  T I P
When performing Step 5,
remember that to determine the
maximum or minimum value 
of a continuous function on 
a closed interval, you need to
compare the values of at its
critical numbers with the values
of at the endpoints of the 
interval. The greatest of these
values is the desired maximum
and the least is the desired
minimum.

Finding a Minimum Sum
The product of two positive numbers is 288. Minimize the sum of the second
number and twice the first number.
SOLUTION
1. Let x be the first number, y the second, and S the sum to be minimized.
2. Because you want to minimize S, the primary equation is
Primary equation
3. Because the product of the two numbers is 288, you can write the secondary
equation as

Using this result, you can rewrite the primary equation as a function of one
variable.

5. To find the minimum value of S, begin by finding its critical numbers.

Choosing the positive x-value, you can use the First-Derivative Test to con-
clude that S is decreasing on the interval

Applications of the Derivative
As applications go, the four examples described in this section are fairly 
simple, and yet the resulting primary equations are quite complicated. Real-life
applications often involve equations that are at least as complex as these four.
Remember that one of the main goals of this course is to enable you to use the
power of calculus to analyze equations that at first glance seem formidable.
Also remember that once you have found the primary equation, you can use
the graph of the equation to help solve the problem. For instance, the graphs of
the primary equations in Examples 1 through 4 are shown in Figure 3.35.

Price Elasticity of Demand
One way economists measure the responsiveness of consumers to a change in the
price of a product is with price elasticity of demand. For example, a drop in the
price of vegetables might result in a much greater demand for vegetables; such a
demand is called elastic. On the other hand, the demand for items such as milk
and water is relatively unresponsive to changes in price; the demand for such
items is called inelastic.
More formally, the elasticity of demand is the percent change of a quantity
demanded x, divided by the percent change in its price p. You can develop a
formula for price elasticity of demand using the approximation
which is based on the definition of the derivative. Using this approximation, you
can write
Price elasticity of demand is related to the total revenue function, as indicated
in Figure 3.41 and the list below.
1. If the demand is elastic, then a decrease in price is accompanied by an increase
in unit sales sufficient to increase the total revenue.
2. If the demand is inelastic, then a decrease in price is not accompanied by an
increase in unit sales sufficient to increase the total revenue.

A real estate office handles a 50-unit
apartment complex. When the rent is $580 per month, all

23. Minimum Cost
A power station is on one side of a river
that is 0.5 mile wide, and a factory is 6 miles downstream
on the other side of the river (see figure). It costs $18 per
foot to run overland power lines and $25 per foot to run
underwater power lines. Write a cost function for running
the power lines from the power station to the factory. Use a
graphing utility to graph your function. Estimate the value
of that minimizes the cost. Explain your results.
24. Minimum Cost
An offshore oil well is 1 mile off the
coast. The oil refinery is 2 miles down the coast. Laying
pipe in the ocean is twice as expensive as laying it on land.
Find the most economical path for the pipe from the well to
the oil refinery.
Minimum Cost
In Exercises 25 and 26, find the speed
in miles per hour, that will minimize costs on a 
110-mile delivery trip. The cost per hour for fuel is

llinois native Jim Bell moved to California in
1996 to pursue his dream of working in the
skateboarding industry. After a string of sales
jobs with several skate companies, Bell started
San Diego-based Jim Bell Skateboard Ramps in
2004 with an initial cash outlay of $50. His 
custom-built skateboard ramp business brought
in sales of $250,000 the following year. His 
latest product, the U-Built-It Skateboard Ramp,
is expected to nearly double his annual sales.
Bell marketed his new product by featuring it
at trade shows. He backed it up by showing 
pictures of the hundreds of ramps he has built.
So, Bell was able to prove the demand existed,
as well as the quality and customer satisfaction
his work boasted.
45. Research Project
Choose an innovative product
like the one described above. Use your school’s
library, the Internet, or some other reference source
to research the history of the product or service.
Collect data about the revenue that the product or
service has generated, and find a mathematical
model of the data. Summarize your findings.

Asymptotes
■Find the vertical asymptotes of functions and find infinite limits.
■Find the horizontal asymptotes of functions and find limits at infinity.
■Use asymptotes to answer questions about real-life situations.
Vertical Asymptotes and Infinite Limits
In the first three sections of this chapter, you studied ways in which you can use
calculus to help analyze the graph of a function. In this section, you will study
another valuable aid to curve sketching: the determination of vertical and
horizontal asymptotes.
Recall from Section 1.5, Example 10, that the function
is unbounded as x approaches 2 (see Figure 3.44). This type of behavior is
described by saying that the line 
is a vertical asymptote of the graph of f.
The type of limit in which 
approaches infinity (or negative infinity) as x
approaches c from the left or from the right is an infinite limit. The infinite 
limits for the function 
can be written as

Horizontal Asymptotes and Limits at Infinity
Another type of limit, called a limit at infinity, specifies a finite value approached
by a function as increases (or decreases) without bound.
Figure 3.49 shows two ways in which the graph of a function can approach
one or more horizontal asymptotes. Note that it is possible for the graph of a
function to cross its horizontal asymptote.
Limits at infinity share many of the properties of limits discussed in Section
1.5. When finding horizontal asymptotes, you can use the property that
and
The second limit assumes that 
is defined when

Applications of Asymptotes
There are many examples of asymptotic behavior in real life. For instance,
Example 7 describes the asymptotic behavior of an average cost function.
Example 7
Modeling Average Cost
A small business invests $5000 in a new product. In addition to this initial invest-
ment, the product will cost $0.50 per unit to produce. Find the average cost 
per unit if 1000 units are produced, if 10,000 units are produced, and if 100,000
units are produced. What is the limit of the average cost as the number of units
produced increases?
SOLUTION
From the given information, you can model the total cost 
(in 
dollars) by
Total cost function
where 
is the number of units produced. This implies that the average cost 
function is
Average cost function
If only 1000 units are produced, then the average cost per unit is
Average cost for 1000 units
If 10,000 units are produced, then the average cost per unit is
Average cost for 10,000 units
If 100,000 units are produced, then the average cost per unit is
Average cost for 100,000 units
As x approaches infinity, the limiting average cost per unit is
As shown in Figure 3.52, this example points out one of the major problems of
small businesses. That is, it is difficult to have competitively low prices when the
production level is low.
✓CHECKPOINT 7
A small business invests $25,000 in a new product. In addition, the product 
will cost $0.75 per unit to produce. Find the cost function and the average cost 
function. What is the limit of the average cost function as production increases?

Applications of the Derivative
Example 8
Modeling Smokestack Emission
A manufacturing plant has determined that the cost C (in dollars) of removing p%
of the smokestack pollutants of its main smokestack is modeled by
What is the vertical asymptote of this function? What does the vertical asymptote
mean to the plant owners?
SOLUTION
The graph of the cost function is shown in Figure 3.53. From the
graph, you can see that 
is the vertical asymptote. This means that as the
plant attempts to remove higher and higher percents of the pollutants, the cost
increases dramatically. For instance, the cost of removing 85% of the pollutants is
Cost for 85% removal
but the cost of removing 90% is
Cost for 90% removal

Summary of Curve-Sketching Techniques
It would be difficult to overstate the importance of using graphs in mathematics.
Descartes’s introduction of analytic geometry contributed significantly to the
rapid advances in calculus that began during the mid-seventeenth century.
So far, you have studied several concepts that are useful in analyzing the
graph of a function.
• x-intercepts and y-intercepts
(Section 1.2)
• Domain and range
(Section 1.4)
• Continuity
(Section 1.6)
• Differentiability
(Section 2.1)
• Relative extrema
(Section 3.2)
• Concavity
(Section 3.3)
• Points of inflection
(Section 3.3)
• Vertical asymptotes
(Section 3.6)
• Horizontal asymptotes
(Section 3.6)
When you are sketching the graph of a function, either by hand or with a
graphing utility, remember that you cannot normally show the entire graph. The
decision as to which part of the graph to show is crucial. For instance, which of
the viewing windows in Figure 3.54 better represents the graph of
The lower viewing window gives a more complete view of the graph, but the
context of the problem might indicate that the upper view is better. Here are some
guidelines for analyzing the graph of a function.

So, the x-intercepts occur when 
and 
The derivative is
First derivative
Factored form
So, the critical numbers of f are 
and 
The second derivative of f is
Second derivative
Factored form
which implies that the second derivative is zero when 
By testing the
values of

as shown in the table, you can see that f has one relative
minimum, one relative maximum, and one point of inflection. The graph of f is
shown in Figure 3.55.

is similar to the function in the example, but it does not factor with integer
coefficients. Using a graphing utility, you can determine that the function
has only one -intercept, x 	 5.0275.

DISCOVERY
A polynomial function of degree 
can have at most 
relative extrema
and at most 
points of inflection. For instance, the third-degree 
polynomial in Example 1 has two relative extrema and one point of 
inflection. Similarly, the fourth-degree polynomial function in Example 2 
has one relative extremum and two points of inflection. Is it possible for 
a third-degree function to have no relative extrema? Is it possible for a
fourth-degree function to have no relative extrema?

SOLUTION
The y-intercept occurs at 
Using the Quadratic Formula on
the numerator, you can see that there are no x-intercepts. Because the
denominator is zero when 
(and the numerator is not zero when 
), it
follows that 
is a vertical asymptote of the graph. There are no horizontal
asymptotes because the degree of the numerator is greater than the degree of the
denominator. The derivative is
First derivative
Factored form
So, the critical numbers of f are 
and 
The second derivative is
Second derivative
Factored form
Because the second derivative has no zeros and because 
is not in the
domain of the function, you can conclude that the graph has no points of
inflection. By testing the values of 
and 
as shown in the table, you can
see that f has one relative minimum and one relative maximum. The graph of f is
shown in Figure 3.57.

Differentials and Marginal Analysis

■Find the differentials of functions.
■Use differentials to approximate changes in functions.
■Use differentials to approximate changes in real-life models.
Differentials
When the derivative was defined in Section 2.1 as the limit of the ratio 
it seemed natural to retain the quotient symbolism for the limit itself. So, the
derivative of y with respect to x was denoted by
even though we did not interpret 
as the quotient of two separate quantities.
In this section, you will see that the quantities dy and dx can be assigned
meanings in such a way that their quotient, when 
is equal to the
derivative of y with respect to x.
One use of differentials is in approximating the change in 
that
corresponds to a change in x, as shown in Figure 3.61. This change is denoted by
In Figure 3.61, notice that as 
gets smaller and smaller, the values of dy and 
get closer and closer. That is, when 
is small,

Marginal Analysis
Differentials are used in economics to approximate changes in revenue, cost, and
profit. Suppose that 
is the total revenue for selling x units of a product.
When the number of units increases by 1, the change in x is 
and the
change in R is
In other words, you can use the differential dR to approximate the change in the
revenue that accompanies the sale of one additional unit. Similarly, the differen-
tials dC and dP can be used to approximate the changes in cost and profit that
accompany the sale (or production) of one additional unit.
Example 2

The demand function for a product is modeled by

Error Propagation
A common use of differentials is the estimation of errors that result from inaccu-
racies of physical measuring devices. This is shown in Example 5.
Example 5
Estimating Measurement Errors
The radius of a ball bearing is measured to be 0.7 inch, as shown in Figure 3.64.
This implies that the volume of the ball bearing is 
cubic
inches. You are told that the measurement of the radius is correct to within 0.01
inch. How far off could the calculation of the volume be?
SOLUTION
Because the value of r can be off by 0.01 inch, it follows that
Possible error in measuring
Using 
you can estimate the possible error in the volume.
Formula for volume
Formula for differential of V
The possible error in the volume is
Substitute for r and dr.
cubic inch.
Possible error
So, the volume of the ball bearing could range between
1.3752 cubic inches
and
cubic inches.
In Example 5, the relative error in the volume is defined to be the ratio of
dV to V. This ratio is
This corresponds to a percentage error of 4.29%.

Solving Equations
Much of the algebra in Chapter 3 involves simplifying algebraic expressions (see pages
196 and 197) and solving algebraic equations (see page 106). The Algebra Review on page
106 illustrates some of the basic techniques for solving equations. On these two pages, you
can review some of the more complicated techniques for solving equations.
When solving an equation, remember that your basic goal is to isolate the variable on
one side of the equation. To do this, you use inverse operations. For instance, to get rid of
the subtract 2 in
you add 2 to each side of the equation. Similarly, to get rid of the square root in 
you square both sides of the equation.

CHAPTER 3
Applications of the Derivative
Study Strategies
■Solve Problems Graphically, Analytically, and Numerically
When analyzing the graph of a function, use a variety 
of problem-solving strategies. For instance, if you were asked to analyze the graph of
you could begin graphically. That is, you could use a graphing utility to find a viewing window that appears to show the
important characteristics of the graph. From the graph shown below, the function appears to have one relative minimum,
one relative maximum, and one point of inflection.
Next, you could use calculus to analyze the graph. Because the derivative of is
the critical numbers of are 
and 
By the First-Derivative Test, you can conclude that 
yields a relative 
minimum and 
yields a relative maximum. Because
you can conclude that 
yields a point of inflection. Finally, you could analyze the graph numerically. For instance, you
could construct a table of values and observe that is increasing on the interval 
decreasing on the interval 
and
increasing on the interval 
■Problem-Solving Strategies
If you get stuck when trying to solve an optimization problem, consider the strategies below.
1. Draw a Diagram.
If feasible, draw a diagram that represents the problem. Label all known values and unknown values on
the diagram.
2. Solve a Simpler Problem.
Simplify the problem, or write several simple examples of the problem. For instance, if you are
asked to find the dimensions that will produce a maximum area, try calculating the areas of several examples.
3. Rewrite the Problem in Your Own Words.
Rewriting a problem can help you understand it better.
4. Guess and Check.
Try guessing the answer, then check your guess in the statement of the original problem. By refining
your guesses, you may be able to think of a general strategy for solving the problem.

Exponential and 
Logarithmic Functions
On May 26, 2006, Java, Indonesia experienced an earthquake measuring 6.3 on 
the Richter scale, a logarithmic function that serves as one way to calculate an
earthquake’s magnitude. (See Section 4.5, Exercise 87.)
Exponential and logarithmic functions have many real-life 
applications. The applications listed below represent a sample 
of the applications in this chapter.

Exponential Functions
You are already familiar with the behavior of algebraic functions such as
and
each of which involves a variable raised to a constant power. By interchanging
roles and raising a constant to a variable power, you obtain another important
class of functions called exponential functions. Some simple examples are
and
In general, you can use any positive base 
as the base of an exponential
function.
When working with exponential functions, the properties of exponents,
shown below, are useful.

Dating Organic Material
In living organic material, the ratio of radioactive carbon isotopes to the total
number of carbon atoms is about 1 to 
When organic material dies, its
radioactive carbon isotopes begin to decay, with a half-life of about 5715 years.
This means that after 5715 years, the ratio of isotopes to atoms will have 
decreased to one-half the original ratio, after a second 5715 years the ratio will
have decreased to one-fourth of the original, and so on. Figure 4.1 shows this
decreasing ratio. The formula for the ratio R of carbon isotopes to carbon atoms is
where t is the time in years. Find the value of R for each period of time.

Natural Exponential Functions
In Section 4.1, exponential functions were introduced using an unspecified base
a. In calculus, the most convenient (or natural) choice for a base is the irrational
number e, whose decimal approximation is
Although this choice of base may seem unusual, its convenience will become
apparent as the rules for differentiating exponential functions are developed 
in Section 4.3. In that development, you will encounter the limit used in the 
definition of e.

Exponential functions are often used to model the growth of a quantity or a
population. When the quantity’s growth is not restricted, an exponential model is
often used. When the quantity’s growth is restricted, the best model is often a
logistic growth function of the form
Graphs of both types of population growth models are shown in Figure 4.6.

Extended Application: Compound Interest
If 
dollars is deposited in an account at an annual interest rate of (in decimal
form), what is the balance after 1 year? The answer depends on the number of
times the interest is compounded, according to the formula
where 
is the number of compoundings per year. The balances for a deposit of
$1000 at 8%, at various compounding periods, are shown in the table.
You may be surprised to discover that as increases, the balance 
approaches
a limit, as indicated in the following development. In this development, let
Then 
as 
and you have
Substitute x for 
This limit is the balance after 1 year of continuous compounding. So, for a
deposit of $1000 at 8%, compounded continuously, the balance at the end of the
year would be

The average interest rates paid by banks on savings accounts have varied
greatly during the past 30 years. At times, savings accounts have earned as much
as 12% annual interest and at times they have earned as little as 3%. The next
example shows how the annual interest rate can affect the balance of an account.
Example 3
MAKE A DECISION
Finding Account Balances
You are creating a trust fund for your newborn nephew. You deposit $12,000 in
an account, with instructions that the account be turned over to your nephew on
his 25th birthday. Compare the balances in the account for each situation. Which
account should you choose?
a. 7%, compounded continuously
b. 7%, compounded quarterly
c. 11%, compounded continuously
d. 11%, compounded quarterly
SOLUTION
a.
7%, compounded continuously
b.
7%, compounded quarterly
c.
11%, compounded continuously
d.
11%, compounded quarterly
The growth of the account for parts (a) and (c) is shown in Figure 4.8. Notice the
dramatic difference between the balances at 7% and 11%. You should choose the
account described in part (c) because it earns more money than the other accounts.
✓CHECKPOINT 3
Find the balance in an account if $2000 is deposited for 10 years at an interest
rate of 9%, compounded as follows. Compare the results and make a general
statement about compounding.
a. quarterly
b. monthly
c. daily
d. continuously ■
In Example 3, note that the interest earned depends on the frequency with
which the interest is compounded. The annual percentage rate is called the stated
rate or nominal rate. However, the nominal rate does not reflect the actual rate
at which interest is earned, which means that the compounding produced an
effective rate that is larger than the nominal rate. In general, the effective rate 
corresponding to a nominal rate of that is compounded 
times per year is

Derivatives of Exponential Functions
In Section 4.2, it was stated that the most convenient base for exponential 
functions is the irrational number . The convenience of this base stems 
primarily from the fact that the function 
is its own derivative. You will
see that this is not true of other exponential functions of the form 
where
To verify that 
is its own derivative, notice that the limit
implies that for small values of 
or 
This
approximation is used in the following derivation.

Example 4
Analyzing a Catenary
When a telephone wire is hung between two poles, the wire forms a U-shaped
curve called a catenary. For instance, the function
models the shape of a telephone wire strung between two poles that are 60 feet
apart (x and y are measured in feet). Show that the lowest point on the wire is 
midway between the two poles. How much does the wire sag between the two
poles?
SOLUTION
The derivative of the function is
To find the critical numbers, set the derivative equal to zero.
Set derivative equal to 0.
Multiply each side by 2.
Add 
to each side.
If 
then 
Multiply each side by 60.
Add x to each side.
Divide each side by 2.
Using the First-Derivative Test, you can determine that the critical number 
yields a relative minimum of the function. From the graph in Figure 4.10, you can
see that this relative minimum is actually a minimum on the interval 
To find how much the wire sags between the two poles, you can compare its
height at each pole with its height at the midpoint.

From this, you can see that the wire sags about 7.7 feet.

To find the maximum revenue analytically, you would set the marginal revenue,
equal to zero and solve for . In this problem, it is easier to use a 
graphical approach. After experimenting to find a reasonable viewing window,
you can obtain a graph of 
that is similar to that shown in Figure 4.11. Using the
zoom and trace features, you can conclude that the maximum revenue occurs
when is about 83,300 units. To find the price that corresponds to this production
level, substitute 
into the demand function.
So, a price of about $20.61 will yield a maximum revenue.

Logarithmic Functions
317
■Sketch the graphs of natural logarithmic functions.
■Use properties of logarithms to simplify, expand, and condense 
logarithmic expressions.
■Use inverse properties of exponential and logarithmic functions 
to solve exponential and logarithmic equations.
■Use properties of natural logarithms to answer questions about 
real-life situations.
The Natural Logarithmic Function
From your previous algebra courses, you should be somewhat familiar with 
logarithms. For instance, the common logarithm
is defined as
if and only if
The base of common logarithms is 10. In calculus, the most useful base for 
logarithms is the number .
This definition implies that the natural logarithmic function and the natural
exponential function are inverse functions. So, every logarithmic equation can be
written in an equivalent exponential form and every exponential equation can be
written in logarithmic form. Here are some examples.
Logarithmic form:
Exponential form:
Because the functions 
and 
are inverse functions, their
graphs are reflections of each other in the line 
This reflective property is
illustrated in Figure 4.13. The figure also contains a summary of several properties
of the graph of the natural logarithmic function.
Notice that the domain of the natural logarithmic function is the set of 
positive real numbers—be sure you see that 
is not defined for zero or for 
negative numbers. You can test this on your calculator. If you try evaluating
or 
your calculator should indicate that the value is not a real number.

Finding Doubling Time
You deposit 
dollars in an account whose annual interest rate is , compounded
continuously. How long will it take for your balance to double?
SOLUTION
The balance in the account after years is
So, the balance will have doubled when 
To find the “doubling time,”
solve this equation for .
Balance in account has doubled.
Divide each side by P.
Take natural log of each side.
Inverse property:
Divide each side by r.
From this result, you can see that the time it takes for the balance to double is
inversely proportional to the interest rate . The table shows the doubling times
for several interest rates. Notice that the doubling time decreases as the rate
increases. The relationship between doubling time and the interest rate is shown
graphically in Figure 4.15.

Carbon Dating
In Exercises 83–86, you are given the
ratio of carbon atoms in a fossil. Use the information
to estimate the age of the fossil. In living organic
material, the ratio of radioactive carbon isotopes to
the total number of carbon atoms is about 1 to 
(See Example 2 in Section 4.1.) When organic material
dies, its radioactive carbon isotopes begin to decay,
with a half-life of about 5715 years. So, the ratio 
of carbon isotopes to carbon-14 atoms is modeled by

Finding a Rate of Change
Radioactive carbon isotopes have a half-life of 5715 years. If 1 gram of the 
isotopes is present in an object now, the amount 
(in grams) that will be present
after years is
At what rate is the amount changing when 
years?
SOLUTION
The derivative of 
with respect to t is
When 
the rate at which the amount is changing is
which implies that the amount of isotopes in the object is decreasing at the rate
of 0.000036 gram per year.

■Use exponential growth and decay to model real-life situations.
Exponential Growth and Decay
In this section, you will learn to create models of exponential growth and decay.
Real-life situations that involve exponential growth and decay deal with a 
substance or population whose rate of change at any time t is proportional to the
amount of the substance present at that time. For example, the rate of decompo-
sition of a radioactive substance is proportional to the amount of radioactive 
substance at a given instant. In its simplest form, this relationship is described by
the equation below.
Rate of change of y
is
proportional to y.
In this equation,

is a function of 
The solution of this 
equation is shown below.

for half of the atoms in a sample of radioactive material to decay. The half-lives
of some common radioactive isotopes are as shown.

MAKE A DECISION
Modeling Radioactive Decay
A sample contains 1 gram of radium. Will more than 0.5 gram of radium remain
after 1000 years?
SOLUTION
Let 
represent the mass (in grams) of the radium in the sample.
Because the rate of decay is proportional to 
you can apply the Law of
Exponential Decay to conclude that is of the form 
where t is the time
in years. From the given information, you know that 
when 
Substituting these values into the model produces
Substitute 1 for y and 0 for t.
which implies that 
Because radium has a half-life of 1599 years, you
know that 
when 
Substituting these values into the model allows
you to solve for k.
Exponential decay model
Substitute for y and 1599 for t.
Take natural log of each side.
Divide each side by 1599.
So,
and the exponential decay model is 
To
find the amount of radium remaining in the sample after 1000 years, substitute
into the model. This produces
gram.
Yes, more than 0.5 gram of radium will remain after 1000 years. The graph of the
model is shown in Figure 4.18.
Note: Instead of approximating the value of k in Example 1, you could leave the
value exact and obtain
This version of the model clearly shows the “half-life.” When

In a research experiment, a population of fruit flies is increasing in accordance
with the exponential growth model. After 2 days, there are 100 flies, and after 
4 days, there are 300 flies. How many flies will there be after 5 days?
SOLUTION
Let 
be the number of flies at time 
From the given information,
you know that 
when 
and 
when 
Substituting this
information into the model 
produces
and
To solve for k, solve for C in the first equation and substitute the result into the
second equation.
Second equation
Substitute 
for C.
Divide each side by 100.
Take natural log of each side.
Solve for k.
Using 
you can determine that 
So,
the exponential growth model is
as shown in Figure 4.19. This implies that, after 5 days, the population is

Example 3
Modeling Compound Interest
Money is deposited in an account for which the interest is compounded continu-
ously. The balance in the account doubles in 6 years. What is the annual interest
rate?
SOLUTION
The balance 
in an account with continuously compounded interest
is given by the exponential growth model
Exponential growth model
where 
is the original deposit,
is the annual interest rate (in decimal form), and
is the time (in years). From the given information, you know that 
when
as shown in Figure 4.20. Use this information to solve for 
Exponential growth model
Substitute 2P for A and 6 for t.
Divide each side by P.
Take natural log of each side.
Divide each side by 6.
So, the annual interest rate is
or about 11.55%.
✓CHECKPOINT 3
Find the annual interest rate if the balance in an account doubles in 8 years
where the interest is compounded continuously. ■
Each of the examples in this section uses the exponential growth model in
which the base is 
Exponential growth, however, can be modeled with any base.
That is, the model
also represents exponential growth. (To see this, note that the model can be 
written in the form 
) In some real-life settings, bases other than 
are more convenient. For instance, in Example 1, knowing that the half-life of
radium is 1599 years, you can immediately write the exponential decay model as
Using this model, the amount of radium left in the sample after 1000 years is
which is the same answer obtained in Example 1.

Fitting an Exponential Model to Data
Most graphing utilities have programs that allow you to find the least
squares regression exponential model for data. Depending on the type of
graphing utility, you can fit the data to a model of the form
Exponential model with base 
or
Exponential model with base 
To see how to use such a program, consider the example below.
The cash flow per share for Harley-Davidson, Inc. from 1998 through 2005
is shown in the table.
(Source: Harley-Davidson, Inc.)
In the table,
corresponds to 1998. To fit an exponential model to these
data, enter the coordinates listed below into the statistical data bank of a
graphing utility.
After running the exponential regression program with a graphing utility that
uses the model 
the display should read 
and 
(The coefficient of determination of 
tells you that the fit is very
good.) So, a model for the data is
Exponential model with base 
If you use a graphing utility that uses the model 
the display should
read 
and 
The corresponding model is
Exponential model with base 
The graph of the second model is shown at the right. Notice that one way to
interpret the model is that the cash flow per share increased by about 21.5%
each year from 1998 through 2005.
You can use either model to predict the cash flow per share in future years.
For instance, in 2006 
the cash flow per share is predicted to be
Graph the model 
and use the model to predict the cash
flow for 2006. Compare your results with those obtained using the model

Example 4
Modeling Sales
Four months after discontinuing advertising on national television, a manufacturer
notices that sales have dropped from 100,000 MP3 players per month to 80,000
MP3 players. If the sales follow an exponential pattern of decline, what will they
be after another 4 months?
SOLUTION
Let 
represent the number of MP3 players, let represent the time
(in months), and consider the exponential decay model
Exponential decay model
From the given information, you know that 
when 
Using this
information, you have
which implies that

dating assumes that the carbon
dioxide on the Earth today has the same radioactive content
as it did centuries ago. If this is true, then the amount of 
absorbed by a tree that grew several centuries ago should
be the same as the amount of 
absorbed by a similar tree
today. A piece of ancient charcoal contains only 15% as
much of the radioactive carbon as a piece of modern char-
coal. How long ago was the tree burned to make the ancient
charcoal? (The half-life of

Solving Exponential and Logarithmic Equations
To find the extrema or points of inflection of an exponential or logarithmic function, you
must know how to solve exponential and logarithmic equations. A few examples are given
on page 321. Some additional examples are presented in this Algebra Review.
As with all equations, remember that your basic goal is to isolate the variable on one
side of the equation. To do this, you use inverse operations. For instance, to get rid of an
exponential expression such as

Study Strategies
■Classifying Differentiation Rules
Differentiation rules fall into two basic classes: (1) general rules that apply to all 
differentiable functions; and (2) specific rules that apply to special types of functions. At this point in the course, you have
studied six general rules: the Constant Rule, the Constant Multiple Rule, the Sum Rule, the Difference Rule, the Product 
Rule, and the Quotient Rule. Although these rules were introduced in the context of algebraic functions, remember that they
can also be used with exponential and logarithmic functions. You have also studied three specific rules: the Power Rule, the
derivative of the natural exponential function, and the derivative of the natural logarithmic function. Each of these rules 
comes in two forms: the “simple” version, such as 
and the Chain Rule version, such as 
■To Memorize or Not to Memorize?
When studying mathematics, you need to memorize some formulas and rules.
Much of this will come from practice—the formulas that you use most often will be committed to memory. Some formulas,
however, are used only infrequently. With these, it is helpful to be able to derive the formula from a known formula. For
instance, knowing the Log Rule for differentiation and the change-of-base formula,
allows you to
derive the formula for the derivative of a logarithmic function to base a.

Antiderivatives
Up to this point in the text, you have been concerned primarily with this problem:
given a function, find its derivative. Many important applications of calculus
involve the inverse problem: given the derivative of a function, find the function.
For example, suppose you are given
and
Your goal is to determine the functions f, g, and s. By making educated guesses,
you might come up with the following functions.

This operation of determining the original function from its derivative is the
inverse operation of differentiation. It is called antidifferentiation.
If 
is an antiderivative of 
then 
where C is any constant, is
also an antiderivative of

because the derivative of each is 
As it turns out,
all antiderivatives of 
are of the form 
So, the process of antidifferen-
tiation does not determine a single function, but rather a family of functions, each
differing from the others by a constant.

symbol

Finding Antiderivatives
The inverse relationship between the operations of integration and differentiation
can be shown symbolically, as follows.
This inverse relationship between integration and differentiation allows you to
obtain integration formulas directly from differentiation formulas. The following
summary lists the integration formulas that correspond to some of the differenti-
ation formulas you have studied.
Be sure you see that the Simple Power Rule has the restriction that n cannot
be 
So, you cannot use the Simple Power Rule to evaluate the integral
To evaluate this integral, you need the Log Rule, which is described in Section 5.3.

Particular Solutions
You have already seen that the equation 
has many solutions, each
differing from the others by a constant. This means that the graphs of any two
antiderivatives of f are vertical translations of each other. For example, Figure 5.1
shows the graphs of several antiderivatives of the form
for various integer values of 
Each of these antiderivatives is a solution of the

determine a particular solution. To do this, you only need to know the value of

In Chapter 2, you used the general position function (neglecting air resistance) for

Deriving a Position Function
A ball is thrown upward with an initial velocity of 64 feet per second from an
initial height of 80 feet, as shown in Figure 5.3. Derive the position function
giving the height s (in feet) as a function of the time t (in seconds). Will the ball
be in the air for more than 5 seconds?
SOLUTION
Let 
represent the initial time. Then the two given conditions
can be written as
Initial height is 80 feet.
Initial velocity is 64 feet per second.
Because the acceleration due to gravity is 
feet per second per second, you
can integrate the acceleration function to find the velocity function as shown.

Solve for t.
Because the time must be positive, you can conclude that the ball hits the ground
5 seconds after it is thrown. No, the ball was not in the air for more than 5 seconds.

The General Power Rule
In Section 5.1, you used the Simple Power Rule
to find antiderivatives of functions expressed as powers of x alone. In this section,
you will study a technique for finding antiderivatives of more complicated 
functions.
To begin, consider how you might find the antiderivative of

might discover the antiderivative as shown.
Use Chain Rule.
Divide both sides by 4.
Write in integral form.
The key to this solution is the presence of the factor 
in the integrand. In other
words, this solution works because 
is precisely the derivative of 
Letting 
you can write
This is an example of the General Power Rule for integration.
When using the General Power Rule, you must first identify a factor u of the
integrand that is raised to a power. Then, you must show that its derivative 
is also a factor of the integrand. This is demonstrated in Example 1.

If you use a symbolic integration utility to find indefinite integrals,
you should be in for some surprises. This is true because integration 
is not nearly as straightforward as differentiation. By trying different 
integrands, you should be able to find several that the program cannot 
solve: in such situations, it may list a new indefinite integral. You should
also be able to find several that have horrendous antiderivatives, some with 
functions that you may not recognize.

Substitution
The integration technique used in Examples 1, 2, and 4 depends on your ability
to recognize or create an integrand of the form 
With more complicated
integrands, it is difficult to recognize the steps needed to fit the integrand to a
basic integration formula. When this occurs, an alternative procedure called
substitution or change of variables can be helpful. With this procedure, you
completely rewrite the integral in terms of u and du. That is, if

To become efficient at integration, you should learn to use both
techniques discussed in this section. For simpler integrals, you should use pattern
recognition and create 
by multiplying and dividing by an appropriate 
constant. For more complicated integrals, you should use a formal change of 
variables, as shown in Examples 5 and 6. For the integrals in this section’s 
exercise set, try working several of the problems twice—once with pattern 
recognition and once using formal substitution.

Extended Application: Propensity to Consume
In 2005, the U.S. poverty level for a family of four was about $20,000. Families
at or below the poverty level tend to consume 100% of their income—that is, they
use all their income to purchase necessities such as food, clothing, and shelter. As
income level increases, the average consumption tends to drop below 100%. 
For instance, a family earning $22,000 may be able to save $440 and so consume
only $21,560 (98%) of their income. As the income increases, the ratio of 
consumption to savings tends to decrease. The rate of change of consumption
with respect to income is called the marginal propensity to consume.
(Source:
U.S. Census Bureau)
Example 7
MAKE A DECISION
Analyzing Consumption
For a family of four in 2005, the marginal propensity to consume income x can
be modeled by
where Q represents the income consumed. Use the model to estimate the amount
consumed by a family of four whose 2005 income was $33,000. Would the 
family have consumed more than $30,000?
SOLUTION
Begin by integrating 
to find a model for the consumption Q.
Use the initial condition that 
and 
Marginal propensity to consume
Integrate to obtain Q.
Rewrite.
General Power Rule
Use initial condition to find C.
Using this model, you can estimate that a family of four with an income of
consumed about $30,756. So, a family of four would have consumed
more than $30,000. The graph of Q is shown in Figure 5.4.

Area and Definite Integrals
From your study of geometry, you know that area is a number that defines the size
of a bounded region. For simple regions, such as rectangles, triangles, and circles,
area can be found using geometric formulas.
In this section, you will learn how to use calculus to find the areas of 
nonstandard regions, such as the region 
shown in Figure 5.5.
Example 1
Evaluating a Definite Integral
Evaluate
SOLUTION
This definite integral represents the area of the region bounded by
the graph of 
the x-axis, and the line 
as shown in Figure 5.6. The
region is triangular, with a height of four units and a base of two units.

In the development of the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus, was assumed
to be nonnegative on the closed interval 
As such, the definite integral was
defined as an area. Now, with the Fundamental Theorem, the definition can be
extended to include functions that are negative on all or part of the closed 
interval 
Specifically, if 
is any function that is continuous on a closed
interval 
then the definite integral of 
from

is defined to be
where 
is an antiderivative of . Remember that definite integrals do not 
necessarily represent areas and can be negative, zero, or positive.

Marginal Analysis
You have already studied marginal analysis in the context of derivatives and
differentials (Sections 2.3 and 3.8). There, you were given a cost, revenue, or
profit function, and you used the derivative to approximate the additional cost,
revenue, or profit obtained by selling one additional unit. In this section, you will
examine the reverse process. That is, you will be given the marginal cost,
marginal revenue, or marginal profit and will be asked to use a definite integral
to find the exact increase or decrease in cost, revenue, or profit obtained by 
selling one or several additional units.
For instance, suppose you wanted to find the additional revenue obtained by
increasing sales from 
to 
units. If you knew the revenue function R you could
simply subtract 
from 
If you didn’t know the revenue function, but did
know the marginal revenue function, you could still find the additional revenue
by using a definite integral, as shown.
Example 6
Analyzing a Profit Function
The marginal profit for a product is modeled by 
a. Find the change in profit when sales increase from 100 to 101 units.
b. Find the change in profit when sales increase from 100 to 110 units.

Average Value
The average value of a function on a closed interval is defined below.
In Section 3.5, you studied the effects of production levels on cost using an 
average cost function. In the next example, you will study the effects of time on
cost by using integration to find the average cost.
Example 7

Finding the Average Cost
The cost per unit of producing CD players over a two-year period is modeled by
where is the time in months. Approximate the average cost per unit over the 
two-year period. Will the average cost per unit be less than $15?
SOLUTION
The average cost can be found by integrating 
over the interval
(See Figure 5.12.)
Yes, the average cost per unit will be less than $15.

Annuity
A sequence of equal payments made at regular time intervals over a period of
time is called an annuity. Some examples of annuities are payroll savings plans,
monthly home mortgage payments, and individual retirement accounts. The
amount of an annuity is the sum of the payments plus the interest earned and
can be found as shown below.
Example 9

Area of a Region Bounded by Two Graphs
With a few modifications, you can extend the use of definite integrals from
finding the area of a region under a graph to finding the area of a region 
bounded by two graphs. To see how this is done, consider the region bounded by
the graphs of f, g,
and 
as shown in Figure 5.14. If the graphs of both
f and g lie above the x-axis, then you can interpret the area of the region between
the graphs as the area of the region under the graph of g subtracted from the area
of the region under the graph of f, as shown in Figure 5.14.
FIGURE 5.14
Although Figure 5.14 depicts the graphs of f and g lying above the x-axis,
this is not necessary, and the same integrand 
can be used as long as
both functions are continuous and 
on the interval a, b.

Sometimes two graphs intersect at more than two points. To determine 
the area of the region bounded by two such graphs, you must find all points of
intersection and check to see which graph is above the other in each interval
determined by the points.
Example 4
Using Multiple Points of Intersection

To find the points of intersection of the two graphs, set the functions

These three points of intersection determine two intervals of integration:

So, you must use two integrals to determine
the area of the region bounded by the graphs of

So, the region has an area of 24 square units.

It is easy to make an error when calculating areas such as that in Example 4.
To give yourself some idea about the reasonableness of your solution, you
could make a careful sketch of the region on graph paper and then use the
grid on the graph paper to approximate the area. Try doing this with the
graph shown in Figure 5.18. Is your approximation close to 24 square units?

Consumer Surplus and Producer Surplus
In Section 1.2, you learned that a demand function relates the price of a product
to the consumer demand. You also learned that a supply function relates the price
of a product to producers’ willingness to supply the product. The point 
at
which a demand function 
and a supply function 
intersect is
the equilibrium point.
Economists call the area of the region bounded by the graph of the demand
function, the horizontal line 
and the vertical line 
the consumer 
surplus. Similarly, the area of the region bounded by the graph of the supply
function, the horizontal line 
and the vertical line 
is called the 
producer surplus, as shown in Figure 5.19.
Example 5
Finding Surpluses
The demand and supply functions for a product are modeled by
Demand:
and
Supply:
where 
is the number of units (in millions). Find the consumer and producer 
surpluses for this product.
SOLUTION
By equating the demand and supply functions, you can determine
that the point of equilibrium occurs when 
(million) and the price is $3.96
per unit.
The consumer surplus and producer surplus are shown in Figure 5.20.

Application
In addition to consumer and producer surpluses, there are many other types of
applications involving the area of a region bounded by two graphs. Example 6
shows one of these applications.
Example 6
Modeling Petroleum Consumption
In the Annual Energy Outlook, the U.S. Energy Information Administration
projected the consumption 
(in quadrillions of Btu per year) of petroleum to
follow the model
where 
corresponds to 2000. If the actual consumption more closely 
followed the model
how much petroleum would be saved?
SOLUTION
The petroleum saved can be represented as the area of the region
between the graphs of 
and 
as shown in Figure 5.21.
So, about 7.1 quadrillion Btu of petroleum would be saved.
✓CHECKPOINT 6

(in millions of dollars per year) for a trucking
company from 2008 through 2020 is 
where 
corresponds to 2008. If the company purchases more efficient 
truck engines, fuel cost is expected to decrease and to follow the model
How much can the company save with 
the more efficient engines? ■

after its outbreak it had infected
people. Twenty-five weeks after the outbreak, a vaccine was
developed and administered to the public. At that point, the
number of people infected was governed by the model
Approximate the number of people that the vaccine

51. Consumer Trends
For the years 1996 through 2004, the
per capita consumption of fresh pineapples (in pounds per
year) in the United States can be modeled by
where 
is the year, with 
corresponding to 1996.
(Source: U.S. Department of Agriculture)
(a) Use a graphing utility to graph this model.
(b) Suppose the fresh pineapple consumption from 2001
through 2004 had continued to follow the model for
1996 through 2000. How many more or fewer pounds
of fresh pineapples would have been consumed from
2001 through 2004?
52. Consumer and Producer Surpluses
Factory orders
for an air conditioner are about 6000 units per week 
when the price is $331 and about 8000 units per week 
when the price is $303. The supply function is given by
Find the consumer and producer surpluses.
(Assume the demand function is linear.)
53. Consumer and Producer Surpluses
Repeat Exercise
52 with a demand of about 6000 units per week when the
price is $325 and about 8000 units per week when the price
is $300. Find the consumer and producer surpluses.
(Assume the demand function is linear.)
54. Cost, Revenue, and Profit
The revenue from a manu-
facturing process (in millions of dollars per year) is
projected to follow the model 
for 10 years. Over
the same period of time, the cost (in millions of dollars per
year) is projected to follow the model 
where is the time (in years). Approximate the profit over
the 10-year period.

56. Lorenz Curve
Economists use Lorenz curves to 
illustrate the distribution of income in a country. Letting 
represent the percent of families in a country and y the
percent of total income, the model 
would represent 
a country in which each family had the same income. The
Lorenz curve,
represents the actual income 
distribution. The area between these two models, for
indicates the “income inequality” of a
country. In 2005, the Lorenz curve for the United States
could be modeled by
where x is measured from the poorest to the wealthiest 
families. Find the income inequality for the United States
in 2005.
(Source: U.S. Census Bureau)
57. Income Distribution
Using the Lorenz curve in
Exercise 56 and a spreadsheet, complete the table, which
lists the percent of total income earned by each quintile in the
United States in 2005.

■Use the Midpoint Rule to approximate definite integrals.
■Use a symbolic integration utility to approximate definite integrals. 
The Midpoint Rule
In Section 5.4, you learned that you cannot use the Fundamental Theorem of
Calculus to evaluate a definite integral unless you can find an antiderivative of the
integrand. In cases where this cannot be done, you can approximate the value of
the integral using an approximation technique. One such technique is called the
Midpoint Rule. (Two other techniques are discussed in Section 6.4.)
Example 1

Use the five rectangles in Figure 5.22 to approximate the area of the region
bounded by the graph of 
the -axis, and the lines 
and
SOLUTION
You can find the heights of the five rectangles by evaluating at the
midpoint of each of the following intervals.
The width of each rectangle is 
So, the sum of the five areas is

The approximation procedure used in Example 1 is the Midpoint Rule. You
can use the Midpoint Rule to approximate any definite integral—not just those
representing area. The basic steps are summarized below.
An important characteristic of the Midpoint Rule is that the approximation
tends to improve as 
increases. The table below shows the approximations for
the area of the region described in Example 1 for various values of . For 
example, for 
the Midpoint Rule yields
Note that as increases, the approximation gets closer and closer to the exact value

CHAPTER 5
Integration and Its Applications
The easiest way to use the
Midpoint Rule to approxi-
mate the definite 
integral 
is to 
program it into a computer 
or programmable calculator. For
instance, the pseudocode below
will help you write a program
to evaluate the Midpoint Rule.
(Appendix E lists this program
for several models of graphing
utilities.)
Program
• Prompt for value of a.
• Input value of a.
• Prompt for value of b.
• Input value of b.
• Prompt for value of n.
• Input value of n.
• Initialize sum of areas.
• Calculate width of 
subinterval.
• Initialize counter.
• Begin loop.
• Calculate left endpoint.
• Calculate right endpoint.
• Calculate midpoint of 
subinterval.
• Add area to sum.
• Test counter.
• End loop.
• Display approximation.
Before executing the program,
enter the function. When the 
program is executed, you will
be prompted to enter the lower
and upper limits of integration
and the number of subintervals
you want to use.

In Example 1, the Midpoint Rule is used to approximate an integral whose
exact value can be found with the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus. This
was done to illustrate the accuracy of the rule. In practice, of course, you
would use the Midpoint Rule to approximate the values of definite integrals
for which you cannot find an antiderivative. Examples 2 and 3 illustrate 
such integrals.

Example 2

Use the Midpoint Rule with

SOLUTION
With 
the interval 
is divided into five subintervals.
The midpoints of these intervals are

Because each subinterval
has a width of 
you can approximate the value of the definite
integral as shown.
The region whose area is represented by the definite integral is shown in Figure
5.23. The actual area of this region is 
So, the approximation is off
by only 0.001.
Example 3

Begin by dividing the interval 
into 10 subintervals. The 
midpoints of these intervals are

The region whose area is represented by the definite integral is shown in Figure
5.24. Using techniques that are not within the scope of this course, it can be
shown that the actual area is
So, the approximation is off by only 0.001.

The Midpoint Rule is necessary
for solving certain real-life
problems, such as measuring
irregular areas like bodies of
water (see Exercise 38).

The Definite Integral as the Limit of a Sum
Consider the closed interval 
divided into n subintervals whose midpoints
are 
and whose widths are 
In this section, you have seen that
the midpoint approximation
becomes better and better as 
increases. In fact, the limit of this sum as 
approaches infinity is exactly equal to the definite integral. That is,
It can be shown that this limit is valid as long as 
is any point in the th interval.

Approximating a Definite Integral
Use a computer, programmable calculator, or symbolic integration utility to 
approximate the definite integral
SOLUTION
Using the program on page 404, with 
20, 30, 40, and 50, it
appears that the value of the integral is approximately 0.7468. If you have access
to a computer or calculator with a built-in program for approximating definite
integrals, try using it to approximate this integral. When a computer with such a
built-in program approximated the integral, it returned a value of 0.746824.

“Unsimplifying” an Algebraic Expression
In algebra it is often helpful to write an expression in simplest form. In this chapter, you
have seen that the reverse is often true in integration. That is, to fit an integrand to an
integration formula, it often helps to “unsimplify” the expression. To do this, you use the
same algebraic rules, but your goal is different. Here are some examples.

Study Strategies
■Indefinite and Definite Integrals
When evaluating integrals, remember that an indefinite integral is a family of 
antiderivatives, each differing by a constant 
whereas a definite integral is a number.
■Checking Antiderivatives by Differentiating
When finding an antiderivative, remember that you can check your 
result by differentiating. For example, you can check that the antiderivative
is correct by differentiating to obtain
Because the derivative is equal to the original integrand, you know that the antiderivative is correct.
■Grouping Symbols and the Fundamental Theorem
When using the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus to 
evaluate a definite integral, you can avoid sign errors by using grouping symbols. Here is an example.

Integration by Parts
In this section, you will study an integration technique called integration by
parts. This technique is particularly useful for integrands involving the products
of algebraic and exponential or logarithmic functions, such as
and
Integration by parts is based on the Product Rule for differentiation.
Product Rule
Integrate each side.
Write in differential form.
Rewrite.
Note that the formula for integration by parts expresses the original integral
in terms of another integral. Depending on the choices for u and dv, it may be 
easier to evaluate the second integral than the original one.

When using integration by parts,
note that you can first choose 
dv or first choose u. After you
choose, however, the choice of
the other factor is determined—
it must be the remaining portion
of the integrand. Also note that
dv must contain the differential
dx of the original integral.

Example 1
Integration by Parts
Find 
SOLUTION
To apply integration by parts, you must rewrite the original integral
in the form 
That is, you must break 
into two factors—one “part”
representing u and the other “part” representing dv. There are several ways to 
do this.
Following the guidelines, you should choose the first option because 
is the most complicated portion of the integrand that fits a basic integration 
formula and because the derivative of 
is simpler than x.
With these substitutions, you can apply the integration by parts formula as shown.

Before starting the exercises in this section, remember that it is not enough 
to know how to use the various integration techniques. You also must know when to
use them. Integration is first and foremost a problem of recognition—recognizing
which formula or technique to apply to obtain an antiderivative. Often, a 
slight alteration of an integrand will necessitate the use of a different integration 
technique. Here are some examples.

Present Value
Recall from Section 4.2 that the present value of a future payment is the amount
that would have to be deposited today to produce the future payment. What is 
the present value of a future payment of $1000 one year from now? Because of
inflation, $1000 today buys more than $1000 will buy a year from now. The 
definition below considers only the effect of inflation.
Ignoring inflation, the equation for present value also applies to an interest-
bearing account where the annual interest rate r is compounded continuously and
c is an income function in dollars per year.
Example 6
Finding Present Value
You have just won a state lottery for $1,000,000. You will be paid an annuity of
$50,000 a year for 20 years. Assuming an annual inflation rate of 6%, what is the
present value of this income?
SOLUTION
The income function for your winnings is given by 
So,
Because you do not receive this entire amount now, its present value is
This present value represents the amount that the state must deposit now to 
cover your payments over the next 20 years. This shows why state lotteries are so
profitable—for the states!

On February 18, 2006, a group of
eight coworkers at a meat processing
plant in Nebraska won the largest 
lottery jackpot in the world. They
chose to receive a lump sum payment
of $177.3 million instead of an annuity
that would have paid $365 million
over a 29-year period. The odds of
winning the PowerBall jackpot are
about 1 in 146.1 million.

■Use partial fractions to find indefinite integrals.

Partial Fractions
In Sections 5.2 and 6.1, you studied integration by substitution and by parts. In
this section you will study a third technique called partial fractions. This 
technique involves the decomposition of a rational function into the sum of two
or more simple rational functions. For instance, suppose you know that
Knowing the “partial fractions” on the right side would allow you to integrate the
left side as shown.
This method depends on the ability to factor the denominator of the original 
rational function and on finding the partial fraction decomposition of the function.

You can check the partial
fraction decomposition in
Example 2 by combining the
partial fractions to obtain the

Example 1(b) in the Chapter 6
Algebra Review, on page 470.
Also, for help with the algebra
used to simplify the answer, see
Example 1(c) on page 470.
Algebra Review
The use of partial 
fractions depends on 
the ability to factor the 
denominator. If this cannot 
be easily done, then partial
fractions should not be used.
For instance, consider the 
integral
This integral is only slightly
different from that in Example 2,
yet it is immensely more 
difficult to solve. A symbolic
integration utility was unable 
to solve this integral. Of course,
if the integral is a definite 
integral (as is true in many
applied problems), then you can
use an approximation technique

CHAPTER 6
Techniques of Integration
You can use the partial fraction decomposition technique outlined in
Examples 1 and 2 only with a proper rational function—that is, a rational 
function whose numerator is of lower degree than its denominator. If the
numerator is of equal or greater degree, you must divide first. For instance, the
rational function
is improper because the degree of the numerator is greater than the degree of the
denominator. Before applying partial fractions to this function, you should divide
the denominator into the numerator to obtain
Example 3
Integrating an Improper Rational Function
Find 
SOLUTION
This rational function is improper—its numerator has a degree greater
than that of its denominator. So, you should begin by dividing the denominator
into the numerator to obtain
Now, applying partial fraction decomposition produces
Multiplying both sides by the least common denominator 
produces the
basic equation.
Basic equation
Using techniques similar to those in the first two examples, you can solve for A,
B, C, and D to obtain
and
So, you can integrate as shown.

Logistic Growth Function
In Section 4.6, you saw that exponential growth occurs in situations for which the
rate of growth is proportional to the quantity present at any given time. That is,
if 
is the quantity at time 
then 
The general solution of this 
differential equation is 
Exponential growth is unlimited. As long as 
and are positive, the value of 
can be made arbitrarily large by choosing
sufficiently large values of 
In many real-life situations, however, the growth of a quantity is limited and
cannot increase beyond a certain size 
as shown in Figure 6.3. This upper limit
is called the carrying capacity, which is the maximum population 
that can
be sustained or supported as time increases. A model that is often used for this
type of growth is the logistic differential equation
Logistic differential equation
where and are positive constants. A population that satisfies this equation does
not grow without bound, but approaches 
as increases. The general solution of
this differential equation is called the logistic growth model and is derived in
Example 4.

SOLUTION
The value of L determines the horizontal asymptote of the graph to

limit of L (see Figure 6.4).
The value of b determines the point of inflection of the graph. When

Example 6
Modeling a Population
The state game commission releases 100 deer into a game preserve. During the
first 5 years, the population increases to 432 deer. The commission believes that
the population can be modeled by logistic growth with a limit of 2000 deer. Write
a logistic growth model for this population. Then use the model to create a table
showing the size of the deer population over the next 30 years.
SOLUTION
Let y represent the number of deer in year t. Assuming a logistic
growth model means that the rate of change in the population is proportional to
both y and 
That is
The solution of this equation is
Using the fact that 
when 
you can solve for b.
Then, using the fact that 
when

So, the logistic growth model for the population is

Integration Tables
■Use integration tables to find indefinite integrals.
■Use reduction formulas to find indefinite integrals.
Integration Tables
You have studied several integration techniques that can be used with the basic
integration formulas. Certainly these techniques and formulas do not cover every
possible method for finding an antiderivative, but they do cover most of the
important ones.
In this section, you will expand the list of integration formulas to form a table
of integrals. As you add new integration formulas to the basic list, two effects
occur. On one hand, it becomes increasingly difficult to memorize, or even
become familiar with, the entire list of formulas. On the other hand, with a longer
list you need fewer techniques for fitting an integral to one of the formulas on the
list. The procedure of integrating by means of a long list of formulas is called
integration by tables. (The table in this section constitutes only a partial listing 
of integration formulas. Much longer lists exist, some of which contain several
hundred formulas.)
Integration by tables should not be considered a trivial task. It requires 
considerable thought and insight, and it often requires substitution. Many people
find a table of integrals to be a valuable supplement to the integration techniques
discussed in this text. We encourage you to gain competence in the use of 
integration tables, as well as to continue to improve in the use of the various 
integration techniques. In doing so, you should find that a combination of 
techniques and tables is the most versatile approach to integration.
Each integration formula in the table on the next three pages can be
developed using one or more of the techniques you have studied. You should try
to verify several of the formulas. For instance, Formula 4
Formula 4
can be verified using partial fractions, Formula 17
Formula 17

A symbolic integration utility
consists, in part, of a database
of integration tables. The 
primary difference between
using a symbolic integration
utility and using a table of 
integrals is that with a symbolic
integration utility the computer
searches through the database 
to find a fit. With a table of

Trapezoidal Rule
In Section 5.6, you studied one technique for approximating the value of a
definite integral—the Midpoint Rule. In this section, you will study two other
approximation techniques: the Trapezoidal Rule and Simpson’s Rule.
To develop the Trapezoidal Rule, consider a function f that is nonnegative
and continuous on the closed interval 
To approximate the area represented
by 
partition the interval into n subintervals, each of width
Width of each subinterval
Next, form n trapezoids, as shown in Figure 6.9. As you can see in Figure 6.10,
the area of the first trapezoid is
The areas of the other trapezoids follow a similar pattern, and the sum of the n
areas is
Although this development assumes f to be continuous and nonnegative on 
the resulting formula is valid as long as f is continuous on a, b.

Of course, for this particular integral, you could have found an antiderivative and
used the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus to find the exact value of the definite

There are two important points that should be made concerning the
Trapezoidal Rule. First, the approximation tends to become more accurate as n
increases. For instance, in Example 1, if 
the Trapezoidal Rule yields an
approximation of 1.7188. Second, although you could have used the Fundamental
Theorem of Calculus to evaluate the integral in Example 1, this theorem cannot
be used to evaluate an integral as simple as 
because 
has no 
elementary function as an antiderivative. Yet the Trapezoidal Rule can be easily
applied to this integral.

Simpson’s Rule
One way to view the Trapezoidal Rule is to say that on each subinterval, f is
approximated by a first-degree polynomial. In Simpson’s Rule, f is approximated
by a second-degree polynomial on each subinterval.
To develop Simpson’s Rule, partition the interval 
into an even number
n of subintervals, each of width
On the subinterval 
approximate the function f by the second-degree 
polynomial 
that passes through the points
and
as shown in Figure 6.13. The Fundamental Theorem of Calculus can be used to
show that
Repeating this process on the subintervals 
produces
By grouping like terms, you can obtain the approximation shown below, which is
known as Simpson’s Rule. This rule is named after the English mathematician
Thomas Simpson (1710–1761).

Programming Simpson’s Rule
In Section 5.6, you saw
how to program the
Midpoint Rule into a computer
or programmable calculator. The
pseudocode below can be used
to write a program that will eval-
uate Simpson’s Rule. (Appendix
E lists this program for several
models of graphing utilities.)

Error Analysis
In Examples 1 and 2, you were able to calculate the exact value of the integral
and compare that value with the approximations to see how good they were. In
practice, you need to have a different way of telling how good an approximation
is: such a way is provided in the next result.
This result indicates that the errors generated by the Trapezoidal Rule and
Simpson’s Rule have upper bounds dependent on the extreme values of 
and 
in the interval 
Furthermore, the bounds for the errors can be
made arbitrarily small by increasing n. To determine what value of n to choose,
consider the steps below.

Improper Integrals
The definition of the definite integral
includes the requirements that the interval 
be finite and that f be continuous
on 
In this section, you will study integrals that do not satisfy these 
requirements because of one of the conditions below.
1. One or both of the limits of integration are infinite.
2. f has an infinite discontinuity in the interval 
Integrals having either of these characteristics are called improper integrals. For
instance, the integrals
and 
are improper because one or both limits of integration are infinite, as indicated in
Figure 6.17. Similarly, the integrals
and
are improper because their integrands have an infinite discontinuity—that is,
they approach infinity somewhere in the interval of integration, as indicated in
Figure 6.18.

Integrals with Infinite Limits of Integration
To see how to evaluate an improper integral, consider the integral shown in Figure
6.19. As long as b is a real number that is greater than 1 (no matter how large),
this is a definite integral whose value is
The table shows the values of this integral for several values of b.
From this table, it appears that the value of the integral is approaching a limit as
b increases without bound. This limit is denoted by the improper integral shown

that the areas shown in Figure 6.20 are very different. The region lying between

Had you not recognized that the integral in Example 6 was improper, you
would have obtained the incorrect result
Incorrect
Improper integrals in which the integrand has an infinite discontinuity 
between the limits of integration are often overlooked, so keep alert for such
possibilities. Even symbolic integrators can have trouble with this type of 
integral, and can give the same incorrect result.

Application
In Section 4.3, you studied the graph of the normal probability density function
This function is used in statistics to represent a population that is normally 
distributed with a mean of 
and a standard deviation of 
Specifically, if an 
outcome x is chosen at random from the population, the probability that x will
have a value between a and b is
As shown in Figure 6.26, the probability 
is
FIGURE 6.26
Example 7
Finding a Probability
The mean height of American men (from 20 to 29 years old) is 70 inches, and the
standard deviation is 3 inches. A 20- to 29-year-old man is chosen at random from
the population. What is the probability that he is 6 feet tall or taller?
(Source:
U.S. National Center for Health Statistics)
SOLUTION
Using a mean of 
and a standard deviation of 
the
probability 
is given by the improper integral
Using a symbolic integration utility, you can approximate the value of this integral
to be 0.252. So, the probability that the man is 6 feet tall or taller is about 25.2%.

Present Value of a Perpetuity
Recall from Section 6.1 that for an interest-bearing account, the present value
over 
years is 
Present value
where 
represents a continuous income function (in dollars per year) and the
annual interest rate 
is compounded continuously. If the size of an annuity’s 
payment is a constant number of dollars 
then 
is equal to 
and the present
value is 
Present value
Suppose you wanted to start an annuity, such as a scholarship fund, that pays 
the same amount each year forever? Because the annuity continues indefinitely,
the number of years 
approaches infinity. Such an annuity is called a perpetual
annuity or a perpetuity. This situation can be represented by the following
improper integral.
Present value
This integral is simplified as follows.
Definition of improper integral
Find antiderivative.
Apply Fundamental Theorem.
Evaluate limit.
Simplify.
So, the improper integral converges to 
As shown in Figure 6.27, this implies
that the region lying between the graph of 
and the -axis for 
has
an area equal to the annual payment 
divided by the annual interest rate

Present value of a perpetuity
with payment P
Present value of an annuity
with payment P

The present value of a perpetuity is defined as follows.
This definition is useful in determining the amount of money needed to start an
endowment, such as a scholarship fund, as shown in Example 8.
Example 8
MAKE A DECISION
Finding Present Value
You want to start a scholarship fund at your alma mater. You plan to give one
$9000 scholarship annually beginning one year from now, and you have at most
$120,000 to start the fund. You also want the scholarship to be given out 
indefinitely. Assuming an annual interest rate of 8% (compounded continuously),
do you have enough money for the scholarship fund?
SOLUTION
To answer this question, you must find the present value of the 
scholarship fund. Because the scholarship is to be given out each year indefinitely,
the time period is infinite. The fund is a perpetuity with 
and 
The present value is
The amount you need to start the scholarship fund is $112,500. Yes, you have
enough money to start the scholarship fund.

Study Strategies
■Use a Variety of Approaches
To be efficient at finding antiderivatives, you need to use a variety of approaches.
1. Check to see whether the integral fits one of the basic integration formulas—you should have these formulas memorized.
2. Try an integration technique such as substitution, integration by parts, or partial fractions to rewrite the integral in a form
that fits one of the basic integration formulas.
3. Use a table of integrals.
4. Use a symbolic integration utility.
■Use Numerical Integration
When solving a definite integral, remember that you cannot apply the Fundamental 
Theorem of Calculus unless you can find an antiderivative of the integrand. This is not always possible—even with a 
symbolic integration utility. In such cases, you can use a numerical technique such as the Midpoint Rule, the Trapezoidal
Rule, or Simpson’s Rule to approximate the value of the integral.
■Improper Integrals
When solving integration problems, remember that the symbols used to denote definite integrals 
are the same as those used to denote improper integrals. Evaluating an improper integral as a definite integral can lead 
to an incorrect value. For instance, if you evaluated the integral
as though it were a definite integral, you would obtain a value of 
This is not, however, correct. This integral is actually 
a divergent improper integral.

The Three-Dimensional Coordinate System
Recall from Section 1.1 that the Cartesian plane is determined by two perpendicular
number lines called the -axis and the -axis. These axes together with their point
of intersection (the origin) allow you to develop a two-dimensional coordinate
system for identifying points in a plane. To identify a point in space, you must
introduce a third dimension to the model. The geometry of this three-dimensional
model is called solid analytic geometry.
FIGURE 7.1
You can construct a three-dimensional coordinate system by passing a 
-axis perpendicular to both the - and -axes at the origin. Figure 7.1 shows the
positive portion of each coordinate axis. Taken as pairs, the axes determine three
coordinate planes: the xy-plane, the xz-plane, and the yz-plane. These three
coordinate planes separate the three-dimensional coordinate system into eight
octants. The first octant is the one for which all three coordinates are positive. In
this three-dimensional system, a point 
in space is determined by an ordered
triple 
where , , and are as follows.
directed distance from 
-plane to 
directed distance from 
-plane to 
directed distance from 
-plane to 
A three-dimensional coordinate system can have either a left-handed or a
right-handed orientation. To determine the orientation of a system, imagine that
you are standing at the origin, with your arms pointing in the direction of the 
positive - and -axes, and with the -axis pointing up, as shown in Figure 7.2.
The system is right-handed or left-handed depending on which hand points along
the -axis. In this text, you will work exclusively with the right-handed system.

The Distance and Midpoint Formulas
Many of the formulas established for the two-dimensional coordinate system 
can be extended to three dimensions. For example, to find the distance between
two points in space, you can use the Pythagorean Theorem twice, as shown in
Figure 7.4. By doing this, you will obtain the formula for the distance between
two points in space.

The Equation of a Sphere
A sphere with center at 
and radius r is defined to be the set of all points
such that the distance between 
and 
is 
as shown in
Figure 7.6. Using the Distance Formula, this condition can be written as
By squaring both sides of this equation, you obtain the standard equation of 
a sphere.

Finding the Equation of a Sphere
Find the standard equation of the sphere whose center is 
and whose
radius is 3. Does this sphere intersect the 
-plane?
SOLUTION
Write standard equation.
Substitute.
Simplify.
From the graph shown in Figure 7.7, you can see that the center of the sphere lies
three units above the 
-plane. Because the sphere has a radius of 3, you can 
conclude that it does intersect the

SOLUTION
You can obtain the standard equation of the sphere by completing the
square. To do this, begin by grouping terms with the same variable. Then add “the
square of half the coefficient of each linear term” to each side of the equation. For
instance, to complete the square of

Traces of Surfaces
Finding the intersection of a surface with one of the three coordinate planes 
(or with a plane parallel to one of the three coordinate planes) helps visualize the
surface. Such an intersection is called a trace of the surface. For example, the 
-trace of a surface consists of all points that are common to both the surface and
the 
-plane. Similarly, the 
-trace of a surface consists of all points that are
common to both the surface and the 
-plane.
Example 7
Finding a Trace of a Surface
Sketch the 
-trace of the sphere whose equation is
SOLUTION
To find the 
-trace of this surface, use the fact that every point in
the 
-plane has a -coordinate of zero. This means that if you substitute 
into the original equation, the resulting equation will represent the intersection of
the surface with the 
-plane.
Write original equation.

Equations of Planes in Space
In Section 7.1, you studied one type of surface in space—a sphere. In this section,
you will study a second type—a plane in space. The general equation of a plane
in space is
General equation of a plane
Note the similarity of this equation to the general equation of a line in the plane.
In fact, if you intersect the plane represented by this equation with each of the three
coordinate planes, you will obtain traces that are lines, as shown in Figure 7.10.
In Figure 7.10, the points where the plane intersects the three coordinate axes
are the -, -, and -intercepts of the plane. By connecting these three points, you
can form a triangular region, which helps you visualize the plane in space.
Example 1

Drawing Planes in Space
The planes shown in Figures 7.10 and 7.11 have three intercepts. When this
occurs, we suggest that you draw the plane by sketching the triangular region
formed by connecting the three intercepts.
It is possible for a plane in space to have fewer than three intercepts. This
occurs when one or more of the coefficients in the equation 
is
zero. Figure 7.12 shows some planes in space that have only one intercept, and
Figure 7.13 shows some that have only two intercepts. In each figure, note the use
of dashed lines and shading to give the illusion of three dimensions.

Quadric Surfaces
A third common type of surface in space is a quadric surface. Every quadric 
surface has an equation of the form
Second-degree equation
There are six basic types of quadric surfaces.
1. Elliptic cone
2. Elliptic paraboloid
3. Hyperbolic paraboloid
4. Ellipsoid
5. Hyperboloid of one sheet
6. Hyperboloid of two sheets
The six types are summarized on pages 490 and 491. Notice that each 
surface is pictured with two types of three-dimensional sketches. The computer-
generated sketches use traces with hidden lines to give the illusion of three
dimensions. The artist-rendered sketches use shading to create the same illusion.
All of the quadric surfaces on pages 490 and 491 are centered at the origin
and have axes along the coordinate axes. Moreover, only one of several possible 
orientations of each surface is shown. If the surface has a different center or is 
oriented along a different axis, then its standard equation will change accordingly.

DISCOVERY
One way to help visualize a
quadric surface is to determine
the intercepts of the surface with
the coordinate axes. What are
the intercepts of the ellipsoid 
in Figure 7.14?

When classifying quadric surfaces, note that the two types of paraboloids
have one variable raised to the first power. The other four types of quadric 
surfaces have equations that are of second degree in all three variables.

will discover that sketching surfaces in space is not a simple task—even with a
graphing utility.

Functions of Several Variables
So far in this text, you have studied functions of a single independent variable.
Many quantities in science, business, and technology, however, are functions not
of one, but of two or more variables. For instance, the demand function for a
product is often dependent on the price and the advertising, rather than on the
price alone. The notation for a function of two or more variables is similar to that
for a function of a single variable. Here are two examples.

Definition of a Function of Two Variables
Let 
be a set of ordered pairs of real numbers. If to each ordered pair 
in 
there corresponds a unique real number 
then f is called a 
function of x and y. The set 
is the domain of , and the corresponding set
of -values is the range of 
Functions of three, four, or more variables are

The Graph of a Function of Two Variables
A function of two variables can be represented graphically as a surface in space
by letting 
When sketching the graph of a function of 
and 
remember that even though the graph is three-dimensional, the domain of the
function is two-dimensional—it consists of the points in the 
-plane for which
the function is defined. As with functions of a single variable, unless specifically
restricted, the domain of a function of two variables is assumed to be the set of
all points 
for which the defining equation has meaning. In other words, to
each point 
in the domain of 
there corresponds a point 
on the
surface, and conversely, to each point 
on the surface there corresponds a
point 
in the domain of .
Example 2
Finding the Domain and Range of a Function
Find the domain and range of the function
SOLUTION
Because no restrictions are given, the domain is assumed to be the
set of all points for which the defining equation makes sense.
Quantity inside radical must be nonnegative.
Domain of the function
So, the domain is the set of all points that lie on or inside the circle given by
The range of f is the set
Range of the function
As shown in Figure 7.18, the graph of the function is a hemisphere.

A surface in space 
represents the graph of a 
function of and only if
each vertical line intersects
the surface at most once. For
instance, the surface shown

Some vertical lines intersect this surface more

Vertical Line Test and is not a function of x and y.

Contour Maps and Level Curves
A contour map of a surface is created by projecting traces, taken in evenly
spaced planes that are parallel to the 
-plane, onto the 
-plane. Each projection
is a level curve of the surface.
Contour maps are used to create weather maps, topographical maps, and
population density maps. For instance, Figure 7.19(a) shows a graph of a 
“mountain and valley” surface given by 
Each of the level curves in
Figure 7.19(b) represents the intersection of the surface 
with a plane
where 
Example 3
Reading a Contour Map
The “contour map” in Figure 7.20 was computer generated using data collected
by satellite instrumentation. Color is used to show the “ozone hole” in Earth’s
atmosphere. The purple and blue areas represent the lowest levels of ozone and
the green areas represent the highest level. Describe the areas that have the 
lowest levels of ozone.
(Source: National Aeronautics and Space Administration)
SOLUTION
The lowest levels of ozone are over Antarctica and the Antarctic
Ocean. The ozone layer acts to protect life on Earth by blocking harmful 
ultraviolet rays from the sun. The “ozone hole” in the polar region of the Southern
Hemisphere is an area in which there is a severe depletion of the ozone levels in
the atmosphere. It is primarily caused by compounds that release chlorine and
bromine gases into the atmosphere.
✓CHECKPOINT 3
When the level curves of a contour map are close together, is the surface 
represented by the contour map steep or nearly level? When the level curves 
of a contour map are far apart, is the surface represented by the contour map
steep or nearly level? ■

Reading a Contour Map
The contour map shown in Figure 7.21 represents the economy of the United
States. Discuss the use of color to represent the level curves.

SOLUTION
You can see from the key that the light yellow regions are mainly
used in crop production. The gray areas represent regions that are unproductive.
Manufacturing centers are denoted by large red dots and mineral deposits are
denoted by small black dots.
One advantage of such a map is that it allows you to “see” the components
of the country’s economy at a glance. From the map it is clear that the Midwest
is responsible for most of the crop production in the United States.
✓CHECKPOINT 4
Use Figure 7.21 to describe how Alaska contributes to the U.S. economy. 
Does Alaska contain any manufacturing centers? Does Alaska contain any 
mineral deposits? ■

Applications
The Cobb-Douglas production function is used in economics to represent 
the numbers of units produced by varying amounts of labor and capital. Let 
represent the number of units of labor and let represent the number of units of
capital. Then, the number of units produced is modeled by
where C is a constant and 
Example 5
Using a Production Function
A manufacturer estimates that its production (measured in units of a product) 
can be modeled by 
where the labor 
is measured in 
person-hours and the capital y is measured in thousands of dollars.
a. What is the production level when 
and 
b. What is the production level when 
and 
c. How does doubling the amounts of labor and capital from part (a) to part (b)
affect the production?
SOLUTION
a. When 
and 
the production level is
b. When 
and 
the production level is
c. When the amounts of labor and capital are doubled, the production level also
doubles. In Exercise 42, you are asked to show that this is characteristic of the
Cobb-Douglas production function.
A contour graph of this function is shown in Figure 7.22.

For many Americans, buying a house 
is the largest single purchase they will
ever make. During the 1970s, 1980s,
and 1990s, the annual interest rate on
home mortgages varied drastically. It
was as high as 18% and as low as 5%.
Such variations can change monthly
payments by hundreds of dollars.

■Find the first partial derivatives of functions of two variables.

■Find the partial derivatives of functions of several variables.
■Find higher-order partial derivatives.
Functions of Two Variables
Real-life applications of functions of several variables are often concerned with
how changes in one of the variables will affect the values of the functions. For
instance, an economist who wants to determine the effect of a tax increase on the
economy might make calculations using different tax rates while holding all other
variables, such as unemployment, constant.
You can follow a similar procedure to find the rate of change of a function 
with respect to one of its independent variables. That is, you find the derivative
of with respect to one independent variable, while holding the other variable(s) 
constant. This process is called partial differentiation, and each derivative is
called a partial derivative. A function of several variables has as many partial
derivatives as it has independent variables.

Consumer products in the same market or in related markets can be 
classified as complementary or substitute products. If two products have a
complementary relationship, an increase in the sale of one product will be 
accompanied by an increase in the sale of the other product. For instance, DVD
players and DVDs have a complementary relationship.
If two products have a substitute relationship, an increase in the sale of one
product will be accompanied by a decrease in the sale of the other product. For
instance, videocassette recorders and DVD players both compete in the same
home entertainment market and you would expect a drop in the price of one to be
a deterrent to the sale of the other.

the graph of this function, you can see that for a fixed price

increase in

product. So, if 
the two products have a substitute relationship.

From the graph of this function, you can see that for a fixed price

Remember that an increase in

Functions of Three Variables
The concept of a partial derivative can be extended naturally to functions of three
or more variables. For instance, the function 
has three 
partial derivatives, each of which is formed by considering two of the variables 
to be constant. That is, to define the partial derivative of

Higher-Order Partial Derivatives
As with ordinary derivatives, it is possible to take second, third, and higher 
partial derivatives of a function of several variables, provided such derivatives
exist. Higher-order derivatives are denoted by the order in which the differentiation
occurs. For instance, there are four different ways to find a second partial derivative
of 
Differentiate twice with respect to 
Differentiate twice with respect to 
The third and fourth cases are mixed partial derivatives. Notice that with the
two types of notation for mixed partials, different conventions are used for
indicating the order of differentiation. For instance, the partial derivative
Right-to-left order
indicates differentiation with respect to first, but the partial derivative
Left-to-right order
indicates differentiation with respect to first. To remember this, note that in each
case you differentiate first with respect to the variable “nearest”

Notice in Example 6 that the
two mixed partials are equal.
This is often the case. In fact, it
can be shown that if a function
has continuous second partial
derivatives, then the order in
which the partial derivatives 
are taken is irrelevant.
Differentiate first with respect to x and
then with respect to y.
Differentiate first with respect to y and
then with respect to x.

A function of two variables has two first partial derivatives and four second
partial derivatives. For a function of three variables, there are three first partials
and
and nine second partials
and
of which six are mixed partials. To find partial derivatives of order three and 
higher, follow the same pattern used to find second partial derivatives. For

n 1996, twin sisters Izzy and Coco Tihanyi
started Surf Diva, a surf school and apparel
company for women and girls, in La Jolla,
California. To advertise their business, they
would donate surf lessons and give the surf
report on local radio stations in exchange for
air time. Today, they have schools in Japan and
Costa Rica, and their clothing line can be found
in surf and specialty shops, sporting goods
stores, and airport gift shops. Sales from their
surf schools have increased nearly 13% per
year, and product sales are expected to double
each year.
71. Research Project
Use your school’s library,
the Internet, or some other reference source to
research a company that increased the demand 
for its product by creative advertising. Write a
paper about the company. Use graphs to show 
how a change in demand is related to a change 
in the marginal utility of a product or service.

Functions of Several Variables
■Understand the relative extrema of functions of two variables.
■Use the First-Partials Test to find the relative extrema of functions of 
two variables.
■Use the Second-Partials Test to find the relative extrema of functions 
of two variables.
■Use relative extrema to answer questions about real-life situations.
Relative Extrema
Earlier in the text, you learned how to use derivatives to find the relative
minimum and relative maximum values of a function of a single variable. In this
section, you will learn how to use partial derivatives to find the relative minimum
and relative maximum values of a function of two variables.
To say that 
has a relative maximum at 
means that the point
is at least as high as all nearby points on the graph of 
Similarly, has a relative minimum at 
if 
is at least as low as all
nearby points on the graph. (See Figure 7.26.)
FIGURE 7.26
Relative Extrema
As in single-variable calculus, you need to distinguish between relative
extrema and absolute extrema of a function of two variables. The number 
is an absolute maximum of in the region if it is greater than or equal to all other
function values in the region. For instance, the function 
graphs as a paraboloid, opening downward, with vertex at 
(See Figure
7.27.) The number 
is an absolute maximum of the function over the
entire 
-plane. An absolute minimum of in a region is defined similarly.

The First-Partials Test for Relative Extrema
To locate the relative extrema of a function of two variables, you can use a
procedure that is similar to the First-Derivative Test used for functions of a single
variable.
Relative maximum
Relative minimum
FIGURE 7.28
An open region in the 
-plane is similar to an open interval on the real 
number line. For instance, the region 
consisting of the interior of the circle
is an open region. If the region 
consists of the interior of the 
circle and the points on the circle, then it is a closed region.
A point 
is a critical point of if 
or 
is undefined 
or if
and
Critical point
The First-Partials Test states that if the first partial derivatives exist, then you need
only examine values of 
at critical points to find the relative extrema. As is
true for a function of a single variable, however, the critical points of a 
function of two variables do not always yield relative extrema. For instance, the
point 
is a critical point of the surface shown in Figure 7.29, but 
is
not a relative extremum of the function. Such points are called saddle points of
the function.

The Second-Partials Test for Relative Extrema
For functions such as those in Examples 1 and 2, you can determine the types
of extrema at the critical points by sketching the graph of the function. For 
more complicated functions, a graphical approach is not so easy to use. The
Second-Partials Test is an analytical test that can be used to determine whether
a critical number yields a relative minimum, a relative maximum, or neither.

47. Hardy-Weinberg Law
Common blood types are
determined genetically by the three alleles A, B, and O.
(An allele is any of a group of possible mutational forms of
a gene.) A person whose blood type is AA, BB, or OO is
homozygous. A person whose blood type is AB, AO, or BO
is heterozygous. The Hardy-Weinberg Law states that the
proportion P of heterozygous individuals in any given 
population is modeled by
where p represents the percent of allele A in the population,
q represents the percent of allele B in the population, and 
r represents the percent of allele O in the population.

must equal 100%) to show that the maximum proportion 
of heterozygous individuals in any population is

annual labor and equipment cost. What is this cost?
50. Medicine
In order to treat a certain bacterial infection, a
combination of two drugs is being tested. Studies have
shown that the duration of the infection in laboratory tests
can be modeled by
where x is the dosage in hundreds of milligrams of the first
drug and y is the dosage in hundreds of milligrams of the
second drug. Determine the partial derivatives of D with
respect to x and with respect to y. Find the amount of each
drug necessary to minimize the duration of the infection.

Lagrange Multipliers with One Constraint
In Example 5 in Section 7.5, you were asked to find the dimensions of the rectan-
gular box of maximum volume that would fit in the first octant beneath the plane
as shown again in Figure 7.35. Another way of stating this problem is to say that
you are asked to find the maximum of
Objective function
subject to the constraint
Constraint
This type of problem is called a constrained optimization problem. In Section
7.5, you answered this question by solving for z in the constraint equation and
then rewriting V as a function of two variables.
In this section, you will study a different (and often better) way to solve
constrained optimization problems. This method involves the use of variables
called Lagrange multipliers, named after the French mathematician Joseph
Louis Lagrange (1736–1813).
The Method of Lagrange Multipliers gives you a way of finding critical
points but does not tell you whether these points yield minima, maxima, or
neither. To make this distinction, you must rely on the context of the problem.

Finding a Maximum Production Level
A manufacturer’s production is modeled by the Cobb-Douglas function
Objective function
where x represents the units of labor and y represents the units of capital. Each
labor unit costs $150 and each capital unit costs $250. The total expenses for
labor and capital cannot exceed $50,000. Will the maximum production level
exceed 16,000 units?
SOLUTION
Because total labor and capital expenses cannot exceed $50,000, the
constraint is
Constraint
Write in standard form.
To find the maximum production level, begin by writing the function
Next, set the partial derivatives of this function equal to zero.
Equation 1

The strategy for solving such a system must be customized to the particular
system. In this case, you can solve for

You should also enter initial

For many industrial applications, a 
simple robot can cost more than a
year’s wages and benefits for one
employee. So, manufacturers must
carefully balance the amount of 
money spent on labor and capital.
AP/Wide World Photos

Economists call the Lagrange multiplier obtained in a production function
the marginal productivity of money. For instance, in Example 2, the marginal
productivity of money when 
and 
is
This means that if one additional dollar is spent on production, approximately
0.334 additional unit of the product can be produced.
Example 3
Finding a Maximum Production Level
In Example 2, suppose that $70,000 is available for labor and capital. What is the
maximum number of units that can be produced?
SOLUTION
You could rework the entire problem, as demonstrated in Example 2.
However, because the only change in the problem is the availability of additional
money to spend on labor and capital, you can use the fact that the marginal 
productivity of money is
Because an additional $20,000 is available and the maximum production in
Example 2 was 16,719 units, you can conclude that the maximum production is

CHAPTER 7
Functions of Several Variables
In Example 4 in Section 7.5, you found the maximum profit for two
substitute products whose demand functions are given by
Demand for product 1
Demand for product 2
With this model, the total demand,
is completely determined by the
prices 
and 
In many real-life situations, this assumption is too simplistic;
regardless of the prices of the substitute brands, the annual total demands for
some products, such as toothpaste, are relatively constant. In such situations, the
total demand is limited, and variations in price do not affect the total demand as
much as they affect the market share of the substitute brands.
Example 4
Finding a Maximum Profit
A company makes two substitute products whose demand functions are given by
Demand for product 1
Demand for product 2
where 
and 
are the prices per unit (in dollars) and 
and 
are the numbers
of units sold. The costs of producing the two products are $0.50 and $0.75 per
unit, respectively. The total demand is limited to 200 units per year. Find the
prices that will yield a maximum profit.
SOLUTION
From Example 4 in Section 7.5, the profit function is modeled by
The total demand for the two products is
Because the total demand is limited to 200 units,
Constraint
Using Lagrange multipliers, you can determine that the maximum profit occurs
when 
and 
This corresponds to an annual profit of $712.21.

The constrained optimization problem in Example 4 is represented graphically
in Figure 7.36. The graph of the objective function is a paraboloid and the
graph of the constraint is a vertical plane. In the “unconstrained” optimization
problem on page 520, the maximum profit occurred at the vertex of the 
paraboloid. In this “constrained” problem, however, the maximum profit 
corresponds to the highest point on the curve that is the intersection of the
paraboloid and the vertical “constraint” plane.

Lagrange Multipliers with Two Constraints
In Examples 1 through 4, each of the optimization problems contained only one
constraint. When an optimization problem has two constraints, you need to
introduce a second Lagrange multiplier. The customary symbol for this second
multiplier is 
the Greek letter mu.

Measuring the Accuracy of a Mathematical Model

model that is both as simple and as accurate as possible. For instance, a simple
linear model for the points shown in Figure 7.37(a) is

To measure how well the model 
fits a collection of points, sum the
squares of the differences between the actual -values and the model’s -values.
This sum is called the sum of the squared errors and is denoted by .
Graphically,
can be interpreted as the sum of the squares of the vertical 
distances between the graph of and the given points in the plane, as shown in

In Example 1, note that the 
sum of the squared errors for the
quadratic model is less than the
sum of the squared errors for the
linear model, which confirms
that the quadratic model is a
better fit.

Least Squares Regression Line
The sum of the squared errors can be used to determine which of several models
is the best fit for a collection of data. In general, if the sum of the squared errors
of f is less than the sum of the squared errors of g, then f is said to be a better fit
for the data than g. In regression analysis, you consider all possible models of a
certain type. The one that is defined to be the best-fitting model is the one with
the least sum of the squared errors. Example 2 shows how to use the optimization
techniques described in Section 7.5 to find the best-fitting linear model for a  
collection of data.
Example 2
Finding the Best Linear Model
Find the values of a and b such that the linear model
has a minimum sum of the squared errors for the points
SOLUTION
The sum of the squared errors is
To find the values of a and b for which S is a minimum, you can use the
techniques described in Section 7.5. That is, find the partial derivatives of S.
Differentiate with respect to a.
Differentiate with respect to b.
Next, set each partial derivative equal to zero.
Set 
equal to 0.
Set 
equal to 0.
The solution of this system of linear equations is
and
So, the best-fitting linear model for the given points is
The graph of this model is shown in Figure 7.39.

The line in Example 2 is called the least squares regression line for the given
data. The solution shown in Example 2 can be generalized to find a formula 
for the least squares regression line, as shown below. Consider the linear model
and the points 
The sum of the squared errors is
To minimize S, set the partial derivatives 
and 
equal to zero and solve
for a and b. The results are summarized below.
In the formula for the least squares regression line, note that if the x-values
are symmetrically spaced about zero, then
and the formulas for a and b simplify to
and
Note also that only the development of the least squares regression line involves
partial derivatives. The application of this formula is simply a matter of computing
the values of a and b—a task that is performed much more simply on a 
calculator or a computer than by hand.

Least Squares Regression Quadratic
When using regression analysis to model data, remember that the least squares
regression line provides only the best linear model for a set of data. It does not
necessarily provide the best possible model. For instance, in Example 1, you saw
that the quadratic model was a better fit than the linear model.
Regression analysis can be performed with many different types of models,
such as exponential or logarithmic models. The following development shows
how to find the best-fitting quadratic model for a collection of data points.
Consider a quadratic model of the form
The sum of the squared errors for this model is
To find the values of a, b, and c that minimize S, set the three partial derivatives,
and 
equal to zero.

SECTION 7.8
Double Integrals and Area in the Plane
545
■Evaluate double integrals.
■Use double integrals to find the areas of regions.
Double Integrals
In Section 7.4, you learned that it is meaningful to differentiate functions of 
several variables by differentiating with respect to one variable at a time while
holding the other variable(s) constant. It should not be surprising to learn that you
can integrate functions of two or more variables using a similar procedure. For
instance, if you are given the partial derivative
Partial with respect to x
then, by holding y constant, you can integrate with respect to x to obtain
This procedure is called partial integration with respect to x. Note that the
“constant of integration”
is assumed to be a function of y, because y is 
fixed during integration with respect to x. Similarly, if you are given the partial
derivative
Partial with respect to y
then, by holding x constant, you can integrate with respect to y to obtain
In this case, the “constant of integration”
is assumed to be a function of x,
because x is fixed during integration with respect to y.
To evaluate a definite integral of a function of two or more variables, you can
apply the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus to one variable while holding the
other variable(s) constant, as shown.
Note that you omit the constant of integration, just as you do for a definite 
integral of a function of one variable.

A symbolic integration
utility can be used to 
evaluate double integrals. To 
do this, you need to enter the
integrand, then integrate
twice—once with respect to 
one of the variables and then
with respect to the other 
variable. Use a symbolic

Finding Area with a Double Integral
One of the simplest applications of a double integral is finding the area of a plane
region. For instance, consider the region R that is bounded by
and
Using the techniques described in Section 5.5, you know that the area of R is
This same area is also given by the double integral
because

In Figure 7.42, note that the horizontal or vertical orientation of the 
narrow rectangle indicates the order of integration. The “outer” variable of
integration always corresponds to the width of the rectangle. Notice also that
the outer limits of integration for a double integral are constant, whereas the
inner limits may be functions of the outer variable.

In setting up double integrals, the most difficult task is likely to be
determining the correct limits of integration. This can be simplified by making a
sketch of the region R and identifying the appropriate bounds for x and y.
Example 5
Changing the Order of Integration
For the double integral
a. sketch the region 
whose area is represented by the integral,
b. rewrite the integral so that is the outer variable, and
c. show that both orders of integration yield the same value.
SOLUTION
a. From the limits of integration, you know that
Variable bounds for x
which means that the region 
is bounded on the left by the parabola 
and on the right by the line 
Furthermore, because
Constant bounds for y
you know that the region lies above the -axis, as shown in Figure 7.45.
b. If you interchange the order of integration so that is the outer variable, then
will have constant bounds of integration given by 
Solving for 
in the equation 
implies that the bounds for 
are 
as shown in Figure 7.46. So, with 
as the outer variable, the integral can be
written as
c. Both integrals yield the same value.

As you are working the exercises for this section, you should be aware that
the primary uses of double integrals will be discussed in Section 7.9. Double 
integrals by way of areas in the plane have been introduced so that you can gain
practice in finding the limits of integration. When setting up a double integral,
remember that your first step should be to sketch the region R. After doing this,
you have two choices of integration orders: dx dy or dy dx.

Applications of
Double Integrals
■Use double integrals to find the volumes of solids.
■Use double integrals to find the average values of real-life models.
Volume of a Solid Region
In Section 7.8, you used double integrals as an alternative way to find the area of
a plane region. In this section, you will study the primary uses of double integrals:
to find the volume of a solid region and to find the average value of a function.
Consider a function 
that is continuous and nonnegative over a
region R. Let S be the solid region that lies between the xy-plane and the surface
Surface lying above the xy-plane
directly above the region R, as shown in Figure 7.48. You can find the volume of
S by integrating 
over the region R.

Functions of Several Variables
Example 1
Finding the Volume of a Solid
Find the volume of the solid region bounded in the first octant by the plane
SOLUTION
FIGURE 7.49
To set up the double integral for the volume, it is helpful to sketch both the solid
region and the plane region R in the xy-plane. In Figure 7.49, you can see that 
the region R is bounded by the lines 
and 
One way to
set up the double integral is to choose x as the outer variable. With that choice,
the constant bounds for x are 
and the variable bounds for y are
So, the volume of the solid region is

In Example 1, the order of integration was arbitrary. Although the example
used x as the outer variable, you could just as easily have used y as the outer
variable. The next example describes a situation in which one order of integration
is more convenient than the other.

In the xy-plane, the bounds of region R are the lines

The
two possible orders of integration are indicated in Figure 7.52. If you attempt to
evaluate the two double integrals shown in the figure, you will discover that the
one on the right involves finding the antiderivative of 
which you know is not
an elementary function. The integral on the left, however, can be evaluated more
easily, as shown.

A population density function
is a model that describes density
(in people per square unit) of a region. To find the population of a region 
evaluate the double integral
Example 4
MAKE A DECISION
Finding the Population of a Region
The population density (in people per square mile) of the city shown in Figure
7.54 can be modeled by
where and are measured in miles. Approximate the city’s population. Will the
city’s average population density be less than 10,000 people per square mile?
SOLUTION
Because the model involves the absolute value of 
it follows that
the population density is symmetrical about the -axis. So, the population in the
first quadrant is equal to the population in the fourth quadrant. This means that
you can find the total population by doubling the population in the first quadrant.
So, the city’s population is about 422,810. Because the city covers a region 
4 miles wide and 10 miles long, its area is 40 square miles. So, the average 
population density is
No, the city’s average population density is not less than 10,000 people per square
mile.

Solving Systems of Equations
Three of the sections in this chapter (7.5, 7.6, and 7.7) involve solutions of systems of
equations. These systems can be linear or nonlinear, as shown at the left.
There are many techniques for solving a system of linear equations. Two of the more
common ones are listed here.
1. Substitution: Solve for one of the variables in one of the equations and substitute the
value into another equation.
2. Elimination: Add multiples of one equation to a second equation to eliminate a
variable in the second equation.

Angles and Degree Measure
As shown in Figure 8.1, an angle has three parts: an initial ray, a terminal ray,
and a vertex. An angle is in standard position if its initial ray coincides with the
positive x-axis and its vertex is at the origin.
Figure 8.2 shows the degree measures of several common angles. Note that
(the lowercase Greek letter theta) is used to represent an angle and its measure.
Angles whose measures are between 
and 
are acute, and angles whose 
measures are between 
and 
are obtuse. An angle whose measure is 
is
a right angle, and an angle whose measure is 
is a straight angle.
FIGURE 8.2
Positive angles are measured counterclockwise beginning with the initial ray.
Negative angles are measured clockwise. For instance, Figure 8.3 shows an angle
whose measure is 
Merely knowing where an angle’s initial and terminal rays are located does
not allow you to assign a measure to the angle. To measure an angle, you must
know how the terminal ray was revolved. For example, Figure 8.3 shows that the
angle measuring 
has the same terminal ray as the angle measuring 
Such angles are called coterminal.

Trigonometric Functions
Although it may seem strange to consider angle measures that are larger than
such angles have very useful applications in trigonometry. An angle that is
larger than 
is one whose terminal ray has revolved more than one full 
revolution counterclockwise. Figure 8.4 shows two angles measuring more than
In a similar way, you can generate an angle whose measure is less than
by revolving a terminal ray more than one full revolution clockwise.

Radian Measure
A second way to measure angles is in terms of radians. To assign a radian measure
to an angle 
consider 
to be the central angle of a circular sector of radius 1,
as shown in Figure 8.6. The radian measure of is then defined to be the length of
the arc of the sector. Recall that the circumference of a circle is given by
So, the circumference of a circle of radius 1 is simply 
and you can conclude
that the radian measure of an angle measuring 
is 
In other words
or
Figure 8.7 gives the radian measures of several common angles.
FIGURE 8.7
Radian Measures of Several Common Angles
It is important for you to be able to convert back and forth between the
degree and radian measures of an angle. You should remember the conversions
for the common angles shown in Figure 8.7. For other conversions, you can use

The Trigonometric Functions
There are two common approaches to the study of trigonometry. In one case the
trigonometric functions are defined as ratios of two sides of a right triangle. In the
other case these functions are defined in terms of a point on the terminal side 
of an arbitrary angle. The first approach is the one generally used in surveying,
navigation, and astronomy, where a typical problem involves a triangle, three of
whose six parts (sides and angles) are known and three of which are to be 
determined. The second approach is the one normally used in science and 
economics, where the periodic nature of the trigonometric functions is 
emphasized. In the definitions below, the six trigonometric functions are defined
from both viewpoints.

CHAPTER 8
Trigonometric Functions
Trigonometric Identities
In the circular function definition of the six trigonometric functions, the value of
r is always positive. From this, it follows that the signs of the trigonometric 
functions are determined from the signs of x and y, as shown in Figure 8.13.
The trigonometric reciprocal identities below are also direct consequences of
the definitions.
Furthermore, because
you can obtain the Pythagorean Identity 
Other trigonometric
identities are listed below. In the list,
is the lowercase Greek letter phi.
Although an angle can be measured in either degrees or radians, radian 
measure is preferred in calculus. So, all angles in the remainder of this chapter are
assumed to be measured in radians unless otherwise indicated. In other words,
sin 3 means the sine of 3 radians, and 
means the sine of 3 degrees.

identities and formulas from geometry. The next three examples illustrate the

altitude of the triangle bisects its base, you know that

CHAPTER 8
Trigonometric Functions
To extend the use of the values in the table on the previous page to angles in
quadrants other than the first quadrant, you can use the concept of a reference
angle, as shown in Figure 8.15, together with the appropriate quadrant sign. The 
reference angle 
for an angle 
is the smallest positive angle between the 
terminal side of and the x-axis. For instance, the reference angle for 
is 
and the reference angle for 
is

To find the value of a trigonometric function of any angle 
first determine the
function value for the associated reference angle 
Then, depending on the
quadrant in which 
lies, prefix the appropriate sign to the function value.

Furthermore, most calculators have only three trigonometric functions:
sine, cosine, and tangent. To evaluate the other three functions, you should
combine these keys with the reciprocal key. For instance, you can evaluate

Calculating Peripheral Vision
To measure the extent of your peripheral vision, stand 1 foot from the corner of a
room, facing the corner. Have a friend move an object along the wall until you can
just barely see it. If the object is 2 feet from the corner, as shown in Figure 8.18,
what is the total angle of your peripheral vision?
SOLUTION
Let 
represent the total angle of your peripheral vision. As shown
in Figure 8.19, you can model the physical situation with an isosceles right
triangle whose legs are 
feet and whose hypotenuse is 2 feet. In the triangle,
the angle is given by
Using the inverse tangent function of a calculator, you can determine that

Solving Trigonometric Equations
An important part of the study of trigonometry is learning how to solve
trigonometric equations. For example, consider the equation
You know that 
is one solution. Also, in Example 3(d), you saw that 
is another solution. But these are not the only solutions. In fact, this equation has
infinitely many solutions. Any one of the values of 
shown below will work.
To simplify the situation, the search for solutions is usually restricted to the
interval 
as shown in Example 6.
Example 6
Solving Trigonometric Equations
Solve for 
in each equation. Assume 
a.
b.
c.
SOLUTION
a. To solve the equation 
first remember that
Because the sine is negative in the third and fourth quadrants, it follows that
you are seeking values of 
in these quadrants that have a reference angle of
The two angles fitting these criteria are
and
as indicated in Figure 8.20.
b. To solve 
remember that 
and note that in the interval
the only angles whose reference angles are zero are zero,
and 
Of these, zero and 
have cosines of 1. The cosine of 
is 
So, the
equation has two solutions:
and
c. Because 
and the tangent is positive in the first and third
quadrants, it follows that the two solutions are

Graphs of Trigonometric Functions
When you are sketching the graph of a trigonometric function, it is common to
use x (rather than ) as the independent variable. On the simplest level, you can
sketch the graph of a function such as
by constructing a table of values, plotting the resulting points, and connecting
them with a smooth curve, as shown in Figure 8.21. Some examples of values are
shown in the table below.
In Figure 8.21, note that the maximum value of 
is 1 and the minimum value
is 
The amplitude of the sine function (or the cosine function) is defined to
be half of the difference between its maximum and minimum values. So, the
amplitude of 
is 1.
The periodic nature of the sine function becomes evident when you observe
that as x increases beyond 
the graph repeats itself over and over, continuously
oscillating about the x-axis. The period of the function is the distance (on the 
x-axis) between successive cycles. So, the period of 
is

DISCOVERY
When the real number line is
wrapped around the unit circle,
each real number corresponds
with a point 
on the circle. You can visualize
this graphically by setting your
graphing utility to simultaneous
mode. For instance, using radian
and parametric modes as well,
let
X1T = cos(T)
Y1T = sin(T)
X2T = T
Y2T = sin(T).
Use the viewing window 
settings shown below.
Tmin = 0
Tmax = 6.3
Tstep = .1
Xmin = –2
Xmax = 7
Xscl = 1
Ymin = –3
Ymax = 3
Yscl = 1
Now graph the functions. Notice
how the graphing utility traces
out the unit circle and the sine
function simultaneously.
Try changing Y2T to cos T 
or tan T.

Figure 8.22 shows the graphs of at least one cycle of all six trigonometric
functions.
Familiarity with the graphs of the six basic trigonometric functions allows
you to sketch graphs of more general functions such as

Limits of Trigonometric Functions
The sine and cosine functions are continuous over the entire real line. So, you can
use direct substitution to evaluate a limit such as
When direct substitution with a trigonometric limit yields an indeterminate form,
such as 
you can rely on technology to help evaluate the limit. The next exam-
ple examines the limit of a function that you will encounter again in Section 8.4.
Example 4
Evaluating a Trigonometric Limit
Use a calculator to evaluate the function
at several x-values near 
Then use the result to estimate
Use a graphing utility (set in radian mode) to confirm your result.
SOLUTION
The table shows several values of the function at -values near zero.
(Note that the function is undefined when 
)
From the table, it appears that the limit is 1. That is
Figure 8.26 shows the graph of 
From this graph, it appears that
gets closer and closer to 1 as x approaches zero (from either side).

CHAPTER 8
Trigonometric Functions
Applications
There are many examples of periodic phenomena in both business and biology.
Many businesses have cyclical sales patterns, and plant growth is affected by 
the day-night cycle. The next example describes the cyclical pattern followed by
many types of predator-prey populations, such as coyotes and rabbits.
Example 5
Modeling Predator-Prey Cycles
The population P of a predator at time t (in months) is modeled by
and the population p of its primary food source (its prey) is modeled by
Graph both models on the same set of axes and explain the oscillations in the size
of each population.
SOLUTION
Each function has a period of 24 months. The predator population
has an amplitude of 3000 and oscillates about the line 
The prey 
population has an amplitude of 5000 and oscillates about the line 
The graphs of the two models are shown in Figure 8.27. The cycles of this 
predator-prey population are explained by the diagram below.

Graphing Trigonometric
Functions
A graphing utility allows
you to explore the effects
of the constants 
and 
on the graph of a function of
the form
After trying several values for
these constants, you can see
that 
determines the amplitude,
determines the period,
determines the horizontal shift,
and 
determines the vertical
shift. Two examples are shown
below. In each case, the graph
of is compared with the graph
of 
For instance, in
the first graph, notice that rela-
tive to the graph of 
the graph of is shifted 
units to the right, stretched 
vertically by a factor of 2, and
shifted up one unit. Similarly,
in the second graph, notice 
that relative to the graph of
the graph of is
shifted 
units to the right,
stretched horizontally by a 
factor of 
stretched vertically
by a factor of 3, and shifted

Modeling Biorhythms
A popular theory that attempts to explain the ups and downs of everyday life
states that each of us has three cycles, which begin at birth. These three cycles can
be modeled by sine waves

Derivatives of Trigonometric Functions
In Example 4 and Checkpoint 4 in the preceding section, you looked at two
important trigonometric limits:
and
These two limits are used in the development of the derivative of the sine function.
This differentiation rule is illustrated graphically in Figure 8.29. Note that the
slope of the sine curve determines the value of the cosine curve. If u is a function
of x, the Chain Rule version of this differentiation rule is

Modeling Seasonal Sales
A fertilizer manufacturer finds that the sales of one of its fertilizer brands follows
a seasonal pattern that can be modeled by
where 
is the amount sold (in pounds) and is the time (in days), with 
corresponding to January 1. On which day of the year is the maximum amount of 
fertilizer sold?
SOLUTION
The derivative of the model is
Setting this derivative equal to zero produces
Because cosine is zero at 
and 
you can find the critical numbers as shown.
The 151st day of the year is May 31 and the 334th day of the year is November
30. From the graph in Figure 8.32, you can see that, according to the model, the
maximum sales occur on May 31.

Graphing Trigonometric
Functions
Because of the difficulty of
solving some trigonometric
equations, it can be difficult to 
find the critical numbers of a
trigonometric function. For 
example, consider the function
Setting 
the derivative of this function equal
to zero produces
This equation is difficult to solve
analytically. So, it is difficult to
find the relative extrema of 
analytically. With a graphing utility,
however, you can easily graph the
function and use the zoom feature
to estimate the relative extrema. In
the graph shown below, notice that
the function has three relative 
minima and three relative maxima
in the interval 
Once you have obtained rough
approximations of the relative
extrema, you can further refine 
the approximations by applying
other approximation techniques,
such as Newton’s Method, which 
is discussed in Section 10.6, to the
equation
Try using technology to locate the
relative extrema of the function

Note that this list gives you formulas for integrating only two of the six
trigonometric functions: the sine function and the cosine function. The list
does not show you how to integrate the other four trigonometric functions.
Rules for integrating those functions are discussed later in this section.

If you have access to a
symbolic integration 
utility, try using it to integrate
the functions in Examples 1, 2,
and 3. Does your utility give
the same results that are given

Study Strategies
■Degree and Radian Modes
When using a computer or calculator to evaluate or graph a trigonometric function,
be sure that you use the proper mode—radian mode or degree mode.
■Checking the Form of an Answer
Because of the abundance of trigonometric identities, solutions of problems in 
this chapter can take a variety of forms. For instance, the expressions 
and 
are equivalent. 
So, when you are checking your solutions with those given in the back of the text, remember that your solution might be 
correct, even if its form doesn’t agree precisely with that given in the text.
■Using Technology
Throughout this chapter, remember that technology can help you graph trigonometric functions,
evaluate trigonometric functions, differentiate trigonometric functions, and integrate trigonometric functions. Consider,
for instance, the difficulty of sketching the graph of the function below without using a graphing utility.

Sample Spaces
When assigning measurements to the uncertainties of everyday life, people often
use ambiguous terminology such as “fairly certain,” “probable,” and “highly
unlikely.” Probability theory allows you to remove this ambiguity by assigning a
number to the likelihood of the occurrence of an event. This number is called the
probability that the event will occur. For example, if you toss a fair coin, the
probability that it will land heads up is one-half or 0.5.
In probability theory, any happening whose result is uncertain is called an
experiment. The possible results of the experiment are outcomes, the set of all
possible outcomes of the experiment is the sample space of the experiment, and
any subcollection of a sample space is an event.
For instance, consider an experiment in which a coin is tossed. The sample
space of this experiment consists of two outcomes: either the coin will land heads
up (denoted by H) or it will land tails up (denoted by T). So, the sample space S is
Sample space
In this text, all outcomes of a sample space are assumed to be equally likely. For
instance, when a coin is tossed, H and T are assumed to be equally likely.
Example 1
Finding a Sample Space
An experiment consists of tossing a six-sided die.
a. What is the sample space?
b. Describe the event corresponding to a number greater than 2 turning up.
SOLUTION
a. The sample space S consists of six outcomes, which can be represented by the
numbers 1 through 6. That is

Note that each of the outcomes in the sample space is equally likely.

S. That is

Definition of Discrete Random Variable
Let 
be a sample space. A random variable is a function that assigns a
numerical value to each outcome in 
If the set of values taken on by the
random variable is finite, then the random variable is discrete. The number
of times a specific value of occurs is the frequency of and is denoted 
by nx.

Discrete Random Variables
A function that assigns a numerical value to each of the outcomes in a 
sample space is called a random variable. For instance, in the sample space
the outcomes could be assigned the numbers 2, 1, and 0,
depending on the number of heads in the outcome.
Example 2
Finding Frequencies
Three coins are tossed. A random variable assigns the number 0, 1, 2, or 3 to each
possible outcome, depending on the number of heads that turn up.

Find the frequencies of 0, 1, 2, and 3. Then use a bar graph to represent the result.
SOLUTION
To find the frequencies, simply count the number of occurrences of
each value of the random variable, as shown in the table.
This table is called a frequency distribution of the random variable. The result
is shown graphically by the bar graph in Figure 9.1.
✓CHECKPOINT 2
Use a graphing utility to create a bar graph similar to the one shown in 
Figure 9.1, representing the frequency for tossing two six-sided dice. Let 
the random variable be the sum of the points when the dice are tossed. ■

In Example 2, note that the sample space consists of eight outcomes, each of
which is equally likely. The sample space does not consist of the outcomes
“zero heads,” “one head,” “two heads,” and “three heads.” You cannot 
consider these events to be outcomes because they are not equally likely.

the number of ways an event
can happen, see the Chapter 9

Discrete Probability
The probability of a random variable x is
where 
is the number of equally likely outcomes in the sample space. By this
definition, it follows that the probability of an event must be a number between 0
and 1. That is,
The collection of probabilities corresponding to the values of the random vari-
able is called the probability distribution of the random variable. If the range of
a discrete random variable consists of m different values 
then the sum of the probabilities of

Expected Value
Suppose you repeated the coin-tossing experiment in Example 3 several times.
On the average, how many heads would you expect to turn up? From Figure 9.2,
it seems reasonable that the average number of heads would be 
This 
“average” is the expected value of the random variable.

Example 5
Finding an Expected Value
Over a period of 1 year (225 selling days), a sales representative sold from zero
to eight units per day, as shown in Figure 9.3. From these data, what is the 
average number of units per day the sales representative should expect to sell?
SOLUTION
One way to answer this question is to calculate the expected value of
the number of units.
✓CHECKPOINT 5

Variance and Standard Deviation
The expected value or mean gives a measure of the average value assigned by a
random variable. But the mean does not tell the whole story. For instance, all
three of the distributions shown below have a mean of 2.
Distribution 1
Distribution 2
Distribution 3
Even though each distribution has the same mean, the patterns of the distributions
are quite different. In the first distribution, each value has the same frequency. In
the second, the values are clustered about the mean. In the third distribution, the
values are far from the mean. To measure how much the distribution varies from
the mean, you can use the concepts of variance and standard deviation.
632
CHAPTER 9
Probability and Calculus
When the standard deviation is small, most of the values of the random
variable are clustered near the mean. As the standard deviation becomes larger,
the distribution becomes more and more spread out. For instance, in the three
distributions above, you would expect the second to have the smallest standard
deviation and the third to have the largest. This is confirmed in Example 6.

Games of Chance
If 
is the net gain to a player in a
game of chance, then 
is usually negative. This
value gives the average amount per game the player
can expect to lose over the long run. In Exercises 35
and 36, find the expected net gain to the player for
one play of the specified game.
35. In roulette, the wheel has the 38 numbers 00, 0, 1,
34, 35, and 36, marked on equally spaced slots. If a player
bets $1 on a number and wins, then the player keeps the
dollar and receives an additional $35. Otherwise, the dollar
is lost.
36. A service organization is selling $2 raffle tickets as part of
a fundraising program. The first prize is a boat valued at

$400. In addition to the first and second prizes, there are 25
$20 gift certificates to be awarded. The number of tickets
sold is 3000.
37. Market Analysis
After considerable market study, a
sporting goods company has decided on two possible cities
in which to open a new store. Management estimates that
city 1 will yield $20 million in revenues if successful and
will lose $4 million if not, whereas city 2 will yield $50
million in revenues if successful and lose $9 million if not.
City 1 has a 0.3 probability of being successful and city 2
has a 0.2 probability of being successful. In which city
should the sporting goods company open the new store
with respect to the expected return from each store?

of city 1 and city 2 being successful are 0.4 and 0.25,
respectively.

■Use continuous probability density functions to answer questions

Continuous Random Variables
In many applications of probability, it is useful to consider a random variable
whose range is an interval on the real number line. Such a random variable is
called continuous. For instance, the random variable that measures the height of
a person in a population is continuous.
To define the probability of an event involving a continuous random variable,
you cannot simply count the number of ways the event can occur (as you can 
with a discrete random variable). Rather, you need to define a function f called a
probability density function.

the interval 
The function is a probability density function if it is
nonnegative and continuous on the interval 
and if
The probability that lies in the interval

Finding a Probability
For the probability density function in Example 1
find the probability that x lies in the interval 
SOLUTION
Integrate

So, the probability that x lies in the interval 
is approximately 0.262 or
26.2%, as indicated in Figure 9.8.
✓CHECKPOINT 3
Find the probability that lies in the interval 
for the probability 
density function in Checkpoint 1. ■
In Example 3, note that if you had been asked to find the probability that x
lies in any of the intervals 
or 
you would have
obtained the same solution. In other words, the inclusion of either endpoint adds
nothing to the probability. This demonstrates an important difference between
discrete and continuous random variables. For a continuous random variable, the
probability that x will be precisely one value (such as 0.5) is considered to be
zero, because
You should not interpret this result to mean that it is impossible for the 
continuous random variable x to have the value 0.5. It simply means that the 
probability that x will have this exact value is insignificant.
Example 4
Finding a Probability
Consider a probability density function defined over the interval 
If the
probability that x lies in the interval 
is 0.7, what is the probability that x lies

Because the probability that x lies in the interval

Modeling Weekly Demand
The weekly demand for a product is modeled by the probability density function
where x is the number of units sold (in thousands). What are the minimum and
maximum weekly sales? Find the probability that the sales for a randomly 
chosen week will be between 2000 and 4000 units. Will this probability be at least
50%?
SOLUTION
Because 
the weekly sales vary from a minimum of 0 to
a maximum of 6000 units. The probability is given by the integral
Integrate 
over 
Find antiderivative.
Simplify.
Approximate.
So, the probability that the weekly sales will be between 2000 and 4000 units is
about 0.481 or 48.1%, as indicated in Figure 9.10. No, the probability will not be
at least 50%.
✓CHECKPOINT 6

to have smaller standard deviations than distributions that are more dispersed. For
instance, all three of the probability density distributions shown in Figure 9.12
have a mean of

So, about 61.3% of the distribution lies within one standard deviation of the

Median
The mean of a probability density function is an example of a measure of central
tendency. Another useful measure of central tendency is the median.
Example 4
Comparing Mean and Median
In Example 5 in Section 9.2, the probability density function
was used to model the useful lifetime of a product. Find the mean and median
useful lifetimes.
SOLUTION
Using integration by parts or a symbolic integration utility, you can
find the mean to be
Mean
The median is given by
Median
From this, you can see that the mean and median of a probability distribution can
be quite different. Using the mean, the “average” lifetime of a product is 10 years,
but using the median, the “average” lifetime is 6.93 years. In Figure 9.14, note
that half of the products have usable lifetimes of 6.93 years or less.

Normal Probability
Density Function
The normal probability
density function does not
have an antiderivative that is an
elementary function. However,
it does have an antiderivative.
Finding its antiderivative 
analytically is beyond the 
scope of this text. You can 
use a graphing utility, a sym-
bolic integration utility, or a
spreadsheet to evaluate this
function.* Use one of these
tools to evaluate the function 
in Example 6.
T E C H N O L O G Y
S T U D Y  T I P
In Example 6, note that 
probabilities connected with
normal distributions must be
evaluated with a table of values,
with a symbolic integration 
utility, or with a spreadsheet.

found at college.hmco.com/info/larsonapplied.

Example 7
Modeling Body Weight
Assume the weights of adult male rhesus monkeys are normally distributed 
with a mean of 15 pounds and a standard deviation of 3 pounds. In a typical 
population of adult male rhesus monkeys, what percent of the monkeys would
have weights within one standard deviation of the mean?
SOLUTION
For this population, the normal probability density function is
The probability that a randomly chosen adult male monkey will weigh between
12 and 18 pounds (that is, within 3 pounds of 15 pounds) is
So, about 68% of the adult male rhesus monkeys have weights that lie within one
standard deviation of the mean, as shown in Figure 9.17.
FIGURE 9.17
The result described in Example 7 can be generalized to all normal 
distributions. That is, in any normal distribution, the probability that x lies 
within one standard deviation of the mean is about 68%. For normal distributions,
95.4% of the x-values lie within two standard deviations of the mean, and almost
all (99.7%) of the x-values lie within three standard deviations of the mean.

Using Counting Principles
In discrete probability, one of the basic skills is being able to count the number of ways an
event can happen. To do this, the strategies below can be helpful.
1. The Fundamental Counting Principle: The number of ways that two or more events can
occur is the product of the numbers of ways each event can occur by itself. These ways
can be listed graphically using a tree diagram.
2. Permutations: The number of permutations of n elements is n!.
3. Combinations: The number of combinations of n elements taken r at a time is
Example 1

Sequences
In mathematics, the word “sequence” is used in much the same way as in 
ordinary English. To say that a collection of objects or events is in sequence
usually means that the collection is ordered so that it has an identified first 
member, second member, third member, and so on. 
Mathematically, a sequence is defined as a function whose domain is the set
of positive integers. Although a sequence is a function, it is common to represent
sequences by subscript notation rather than by the standard function notation. For
instance, the equation 
defines the sequence below.

can write

The Limit of a Sequence
The primary focus of this chapter is sequences whose terms approach limiting
values. Such sequences are said to converge. If the limit of a sequence does not
exist, then the sequence diverges. For instance, the terms of the sequence
approach 0 as n increases. You can write this limit as 
Although there are technical differences, you can for the most part operate
with limits of sequences just as you did with limits of continuous functions in
Section 3.6. For instance, to evaluate the limit of the sequence whose nth term is
you can write
Take limit as

In this chapter you will learn that many important sequences in calculus
involve factorials. If n is a positive integer, then n factorial is defined as
As a special case, 0! is defined to be 1.
Factorials follow the same conventions for order of operations as exponents. That
is, just as 
and 
imply different orders of operations,
and 
imply
different orders, as shown.
Try evaluating 
for several values of n. You will find that n does not have to be
very large before 
becomes huge. For instance,
Example 3
Finding the Limit of a Sequence
Find the limit of the sequence whose nth term is 
SOLUTION
One way to determine the limit is to write several terms of the
sequence and look for a pattern.
From these terms, it is clear that the denominator is increasing without bound
while the numerator is bounded. So, you can write
This result is shown graphically in Figure 10.1. Note that the terms of the sequence
oscillate between positive and negative values.

Pattern Recognition for Sequences
Sometimes the terms of a sequence are generated by a rule that does not explicitly
identify the nth term of the sequence. In such cases, you need to discover a pattern
in the sequence and find a formula for the nth term.
Example 4
Finding a Pattern for a Sequence
Consider the function given by 
Determine the convergence or diver-
gence of the sequence whose nth term is
where 
and 
is the nth derivative of f.
SOLUTION
Begin by calculating several derivatives of f and evaluating the
results for 
as shown in the table.
From this table, you can see that the pattern is
So, you can write
which means that the sequence converges to zero.
✓CHECKPOINT 4
Complete a table similar to the one shown in Example 4 to find the first four
terms of the sequence whose th term is 
where 
and 
is the th derivative of 
Then determine the convergence 
or divergence of the sequence. ■

Without a specific rule for the nth term of a sequence, it is not possible to
determine the convergence or divergence of the sequence; knowing the first
several terms is not enough. For instance, the first three terms of the four
sequences below are identical. Yet, from their nth terms, you can determine that
two of the sequences converge to zero, one converges to 
and one diverges.
So, if only the first several terms of a sequence are given, there are many possible
patterns that can be used to write a formula for the nth term. In such a situation,
remember that your decision as to whether the sequence converges or diverges
depends on your description of the nth term.

Application
There are many applications of sequences in business and economics. The next
example involves the balance in an account for which the interest is compounded
monthly. The terms of the sequence are the balances at the end of the first month,
the end of the second month, and so on.
Example 6
Finding Balances
A deposit of $1000 is made in an account that earns 6% interest, compounded
monthly. Find a sequence that represents the monthly balances.
SOLUTION
Because an annual interest rate of 6% compounded monthly corre-
sponds to a monthly rate of 0.5%, the balance after 1 month is
After 2 months, the balance is 
Continuing this pattern, you can determine that the balance after n months is 
This implies that the first several terms of the sequence are
or
$1005.00, $1010.03, $1015.08, $1020.15, .  .  . .
Note that this sequence is of the form 
which agrees with the 
formula for the balance in an account.

Interest rates on savings accounts are
related to inflation rates. Throughout
most of the twentieth century, the
United States experienced very little
inflation. In fact, from 1914 to 1939,
the average annual inflation rate was
only 1.6%. From 1940 to 1969, the
average annual inflation rate was
about 3.4%, from 1970 to 1982,
the average annual inflation rate 
was 7.8%, and from 1983 to 2007,
the average annual inflation rate 
was 3.1%.

The nth-Term Test for Divergence
The two primary questions regarding an infinite series are as shown.
1. Does the series converge or does it diverge?
2. If the series converges, to what value does it converge?
A simple test for divergence gives a partial answer to the first question.

Modeling Market Stabilization
A manufacturer sells 10,000 units of a product each year. In any given year, each
unit has a 10% chance of breaking. That is, after 1 year you expect that only 9000
of the previous year’s 10,000 units will still be in use. During the next year, this
number will drop by an additional 10% to 8100, and so on. How many units will
be in use after 20 years? Is the number of units in use stabilizing? If so, what is
the stabilization point?

51. Consumer Trends: Multiplier Effect
The annual
spending by tourists in a resort city is 100 million dollars.
Approximately 75% of that revenue is again spent in the
resort city, and of that amount approximately 75% is again
spent in the resort city. If this pattern continues, write the
geometric series that gives the total amount of spending
generated by the 100 million dollars and find the sum of the
series.
52. Consumer 
Trends: Multiplier

Exercise 51 assuming the percent of the revenue that is
spent in the city is 60%.
53. Depreciation
A company buys a machine for $225,000
that depreciates at a rate of 30% per year. Find a formula
for the value of the machine after years. What is its value
after 5 years?
54. Depreciation
Repeat Exercise 53 assuming the
machine depreciates at a rate of 25% per year.
55. Salary
You accept a job that pays a salary of $40,000 the
first year. During the next 39 years, you will receive a 4%
raise each year. What would be your total compensation
over the 40-year period?
56. Salary
You go to work at a company that pays $0.01 for
the first day, $0.02 for the second day, $0.04 for the third
day, and so on. If the daily wage keeps doubling, what
would your total income be for working (a) 29 days, (b) 30
days, and (c) 31 days?

61. Profit
The annual revenues for eBay from 2001 through
2006 can be approximated by the model
where 
is the annual revenue (in millions of dollars) and
is the year, with 
corresponding to 2001. Use the
formula for the sum of a geometric series to approximate
the total revenue earned during this 6-year period.

62. Environment
A factory is polluting a river such that at
every mile down river from the factory an environmental
expert finds 15% less pollutant than at the preceding mile.
If the pollutant’s concentration is 500 ppm at the factory,
what is its concentration 12 miles down river?
63. Physical Science
In a certain brand of CD player, after
the STOP function is activated, the disc, during each 
second after the first second, makes 85% fewer revolutions
than it made during the preceding second. In coming to
rest, how many revolutions does the disc make if it makes
5.5 revolutions during the first second after the STOP 
function is activated?
64. Finance: Annuity
The simplest kind of annuity is a
straight-line annuity, which pays a fixed amount per month
until the annuitant dies. Suppose that, when he turns 65,
Bob wants to purchase a straight-line annuity that has 
a premium of $100,000 and pays $880 per month. Use
sigma notation to represent each scenario below, and give
the numerical amount that the summation represents.
(Source: Adapted from Garman/Forgue, Personal Finance,
Eighth Edition)
(a) Suppose Bob dies 10 months after he takes out the
annuity. How much will he have collected up to that
point?
(b) Suppose Bob lives the average number of months
beyond age 65 for a man (168 months). How much
more or less than the $100,000 will he have collected?
In Exercises 65–70, use a symbolic algebra utility to
evaluate the summation.

Determine whether each p-series converges or diverges.
a.

SOLUTION
a. For the p-series 
Because 
you can conclude that the series diverges.
b. For the p-series
which means that the series is the harmonic series. Because 
you
can conclude that the series diverges.
c. For the p-series
Because 
you can conclude that the series converges.
In Example 2, notice that the p-Series Test tells you only whether the series
diverges or converges. It does not give a formula for the sum of a convergent 
p-series. To approximate such a sum, you can use a computer to evaluate several
partial sums. More is said about this on the next page.

Series and Taylor Polynomials
Approximating the Sum of a p-Series
It can be shown that the sum S of a convergent p-series differs from its
th partial sum by no more than
Maximum error
When p is greater than or equal to 3, this means that you can approximate
the sum of the convergent p-series by adding several of the terms. For
instance, because
Tenth partial sum
and
you can conclude that the sum of the infinite p-series with 
is 
between 1.19753 and 
or 1.20253. For convergent 
p-series in which p is less than 3, you need to add more and more terms 
of the series to obtain a reasonable approximation of the sum. For instance,
when 
you can use a computer to find the sums below.
Tenth partial sum
100th partial sum
1000th partial sum
Because
you can conclude that the partial sum 
is within 0.001 of the actual 
sum of the series.
When p is close to 1, approximating the sum of the series becomes
difficult. For instance, consider the partial sums below.
Tenth partial sum

Because 
you can see that even the partial sum 
is not very close to the actual sum of the series.

The Ratio Test
At this point, you have studied two convergence tests: one for a geometric series
and one for a p-series. The next test is more general: it can be applied to infinite
series that do not happen to be geometric series or p-series.
The Ratio Test is particularly useful for series that converge rapidly. Series
involving factorial or exponential functions are frequently of this type.
Example 3

Determine the convergence or divergence of the infinite series
SOLUTION

Because this limit is less than 1, you can apply the Ratio Test to conclude that the
series converges. Using a computer, you can approximate the sum of the series to

Example 3 tells you something about the rates at which the sequences 
and 
increase as n approaches infinity. For example, in the table below,
you can see that although the factorial sequence 
has a slow start, it quickly
overpowers the exponential sequence 
From this table, you can also see that the sequence 
approaches infinity more
slowly than the sequence 
This is further demonstrated in Example 4.

SOLUTION
Using the Ratio Test with

Because this limit is less than 1, you can apply the Ratio Test to conclude that the
series converges. Using a computer, you can determine that the sum of the series
is 
When applying the Ratio Test, remember that if the limit of
as 
is 1, then the test does not tell you whether the series converges or
diverges. This type of result often occurs with series that converge or diverge
slowly. For instance, when you apply the Ratio Test to the harmonic series in
which
you obtain
So, from the Ratio Test, you cannot conclude that the harmonic series diverges.
(The Ratio Test is also inconclusive for any p-series.) From the p-Series Test, you
know that it diverges.

Power Series
In the preceding two sections, you studied infinite series whose terms are 
constants. In this section, you will study infinite series that have variable terms.
Specifically, you will study a type of infinite series that is called a power series.
Informally, you can think of a power series as a “very long” polynomial.

Radius of Convergence of a Power Series
A power series in can be viewed as a function of 
where the domain of f is the set of all x for which the power series converges.
Determining this domain is one of the primary problems associated with power
series. Of course, every power series converges at its center c because
So,
is always in the domain of 
In fact, the domain of a power series can take
three basic forms: a single point, an interval centered at 
or the entire real line,
as shown in Figure 10.5.
FIGURE 10.5
Three Types of Domains
In the second case, the series converges in the interval
and diverges in the intervals 
and 
Determining the 
convergence or divergence at the endpoints 
and 
can be difficult, and,
except for simple cases, the endpoint question is left open. To find the radius 
of convergence of a power series, use the Ratio Test, as illustrated in Examples 2
and 3.

Taylor and Maclaurin Series
The problem of finding a power series for a given function is answered by
Taylor’s Theorem, named after the English mathematician Brook Taylor
(1685–1731). This theorem shows how to use derivatives of a function f to write
the power series for f.
Example 4

gence of the series?
SOLUTION

Write original function.
Find first derivative.
Find second derivative.
Find third derivative.
Find fourth derivative.

Why are power series useful? The reason is that power series share many of
the desirable properties of polynomials—they can be easily differentiated and
easily integrated. This means that if you wanted to integrate a function such as

represent the function with a power series and then integrate the power series.

A Basic List of Power Series
Example 6 illustrates an important point in determining power series 
representations of functions. Although Taylor’s Theorem is applicable to a wide
variety of functions, it is often tedious to use because of the complexity of 
finding derivatives. The most practical use of Taylor’s Theorem is in developing
power series for a basic list of elementary functions. Then, from the basic list, you
can determine power series for other functions by the operations of addition,
subtraction, multiplication, division, differentiation, integration, and composition
with known power series.
The last series in the list above is called a binomial series. Example 7 
illustrates the use of such a series.

Taylor Polynomials and Approximation
In Section 10.4, you saw that it is sometimes possible to obtain an exact power
series representation of a function. For example, the function
can be represented exactly by the power series
The problem with using this power series is that the exactness of its representation
depends on the summation of an infinite number of terms. In practice, this is not
feasible, and you must be content with a finite summation that approximates the
function rather than representing it exactly. For instance, consider the sequence of
partial sums below.
Zeroth-degree Taylor polynomial
First-degree Taylor polynomial
Second-degree Taylor polynomial
Third-degree Taylor polynomial
Fourth-degree Taylor polynomial
Fifth-degree Taylor polynomial
...
nth-degree Taylor polynomial
Each of these polynomial approximations of 
is a Taylor polynomial for

Example 1
Finding Taylor Polynomials
Find a Taylor polynomial that is a reasonable approximation of
in the interval 
What degree of Taylor polynomial should you use?
SOLUTION
To begin, you need to define what constitutes a “reasonable” approx-
imation. Suppose you decide that you want the values of 
and 
to differ
by no more than 0.01 in the interval 
To answer the question, you can
compute Taylor polynomials of higher and higher degree and then graphically
compare them with 
For instance, the fourth-, sixth-, and eighth-
degree Taylor polynomials for f are as shown.
Fourth-degree Taylor polynomial
Sixth-degree Taylor polynomial
Eighth-degree Taylor polynomial
To compare 
and 
graphically, use a graphing utility to graph both equa-
tions in the same viewing window, as shown in Figure 10.9. Then, use the trace
feature of the graphing utility to compare the y-values at 
and 1. When you do
this, you will find that the y-values differ by more than 0.01.
Next, perform the same comparison with 
and 
With these two
graphs, the y-values still differ by more than 0.01 in the interval 
Finally,
by graphically comparing 
and 
you can determine that their graphs 
differ by less than 0.01 in the interval 
To convince yourself of this, try
evaluating 
and 
when 
You should obtain the values 0.368 and
0.375, which differ by 0.007.

Taylor’s Theorem with Remainder
In Example 1, you studied a graphical procedure for determining how well a
Taylor polynomial approximates a function f. The theorem below gives you an
analytic procedure for determining this.
Although this theorem appears to give a formula for the exact remainder,
note that it does not specify which value of z should be used to find 
In other
words, the practical application of this theorem lies not in calculating 
but in
finding bounds for

SOLUTION
Using the fourth-degree Taylor polynomial for 
you obtain the

By Taylor’s Theorem with Remainder, the error in this approximation is
Because 
has a maximum value of 1 in the interval 
it follows that
So, the approximation is off by at most 0.002.

Earlier in the text, you looked at different ways to approximate a definite
integral: the Midpoint Rule, the Trapezoidal Rule, and Simpson’s Rule. The next
example shows how you can use a power series to approximate a definite integral.
Example 3
Approximating a Definite Integral
Use the eighth-degree Taylor polynomial for 
to approximate the definite
integral.
SOLUTION
The eighth-degree Taylor polynomial for 
is
Using this polynomial, you can write the approximation as shown.
This result is shown graphically in Figure 10.10. Try comparing this result with that
obtained using a symbolic integration utility. When such a utility approximated 
the integral, it returned a value of 0.746824. So, the approximation has an error of
less than 0.001.
✓CHECKPOINT 3

■
When using a Taylor polynomial to approximate a function on an interval,
remember that as you move farther away from the center of the Taylor
polynomial, you must use a polynomial of higher and higher degree to obtain an
indicated accuracy. For definite integrals, it helps to locate the center of the Taylor
polynomial at the midpoint of the interval of integration. For instance, if you want
to approximate the definite integral
you could use a Taylor polynomial centered at 1. If you try this with an eighth-
degree Taylor polynomial, you will obtain an approximation of 0.882.

Applications of Probability
Many applications of probability involve experiments in which the sample space is

As is always true in probability, the sum of the probabilities of the various 
outcomes is 1. That is, if 
is the probability that n will occur, then
The next example shows how this concept is used in a coin-tossing experiment.

where the random variable assigned to each outcome is the number of tails that
have consecutively appeared before a head is tossed (which automatically ends
the experiment). Show that the sum of the probabilities in this experiment is 1.
SOLUTION
The probability that no tails will appear is 
The probability that
exactly one tail will appear is 
The probability that exactly two tails will
appear is 
and so on. So, the sum of the probabilities is given by a geometric
series.

This series is not geometric, so to find its sum you need to resort to a different
tactic. Using the binomial series from Section 10.4, you can write
which implies that
So, you can conclude that the expected value is
This means that if the experiment were conducted many times, the average

■Use Newton’s Method to approximate the zeros of functions.
■Use Newton’s Method to approximate points of intersection of graphs.
Newton’s Method
Finding the zeros of a function is a fundamental problem in algebra and in
calculus. Sometimes this problem can be solved algebraically. For instance, you
can find the zeros of the quadratic function
by applying the Quadratic Formula to the equation
In real life, however, you often encounter functions whose zeros cannot be found
so easily. In some cases, you can use various approximation methods to find the
zeros. One such method, called Newton’s Method, is described in this section.
Consider a function f, such as the one whose graph is shown in Figure
10.12(a). An actual zero of the function is 
To approximate this zero,
choose 
close to c and form the first-degree Taylor polynomial centered at 
First-degree Taylor polynomial
Graphically, you can interpret this polynomial as the equation of the tangent line
to the graph of f at the point 
Newton’s Method is based on the assump-
tion that this tangent line will cross the x-axis at about the same point as the graph
of f crosses the x-axis. With this assumption, set 
equal to zero, solve for x
and use the resulting value as a new, and hopefully better, approximation of the
actual zero c. So, from the approximation 
you form a second approximation
Second estimate
If you want to obtain an even better approximation, you can use 
to calculate 
Third estimate [see Figure 10.12(b)].
Repeated application of this process is called Newton’s Method.
For many functions, just a few iterations of Newton’s Method will produce
approximations having very small errors.

Convergence of Newton’s Method
When, as in Examples 1, 2, and 3, the approximations approach a zero of a func-
tion, Newton’s Method is said to converge. You should know, however, that
Newton’s Method does not always converge. Two situations in which it may not
converge are as shown.
1. If 
for some n. (See Figure 10.16.)
2. If 
does not exist. (See Figure 10.17.)
The type of problem illustrated in Figure 10.16 can usually be overcome with a
better choice of 
The problem illustrated in Figure 10.17, however, is usually
more serious. For instance, Newton’s Method does not converge for any choice
of 
(other than the actual zero) for the function
Using a graphing utility, try running the program discussed at the left to approx-
imate the zero of this function. If you do, you will find that the program fails.

Programming Newton’s
Method
Technology can be used in a
variety of ways to approxi-
mate zeros of functions. Earlier in
the text, you saw how the zoom
feature of a graphing utility could
be used to approximate a zero
graphically.
Another way to use technology
to approximate the zeros of a 
function is to program Newton’s
Method into a graphing utility.
Appendix E lists the programs for
several models of graphing utilities.
Before running the program,
enter the function into the utility.
Then graph the function and
estimate one of its zeros. When you
run the program, you will be
prompted to enter the estimate as 
After two successive approxima-
tions differ by less than
0.0000000001, the program will
display the refined approximation.
For instance, to use the program 
to approximate the zero of the
function in Example 3
begin by graphing the function,
as shown below. Then run the 
program and enter 
as the 
initial approximation. The calculator
should display a refined approxima-
tion of 
using 
four iterations.
Approximate

■Using the List of Basic Power Series
To be efficient at finding Taylor series or Taylor polynomials, learn how to 
use the basic list below.
■Using Technology to Approximate Zeros
Newton’s Method is only one way that technology can be used to 
approximate the zeros of a function. Another way is to use the zoom and trace features of a graphing utility, as shown 
below. (Compare this with the procedure described on page 715.)

You accept a job that pays a salary of $32,000 the
first year. During the next 39 years, you will receive a 5.5%
raise each year. What would be your total compensation
over the 40-year period?
44. Market Stabilization
A company estimates the annual
sales of a new product to be 8000 units. Each year, 15% 
of the units that have been sold become inoperative. So,
after 1 year 8000 units are in use, after 2 years
units are in use, and so on. How
many units will be in use after 
years?
Multiplier Effect
In Exercises 45–48, use the 
following information. A tax rebate has been given to
property owners by the state government with the
anticipation that each property owner spends 
approximately 
of the rebate, and in turn each
recipient of this amount spends 
of what they
receive, and so on. For the given tax rebate, find the
total amount put back into the state’s economy, if this
effect continues without end.

49. Compound Interest
The holder of a winning
$1,000,000 lottery ticket has the choice of receiving a lump
sum payment of $500,000 or receiving an annuity of
$40,000 for 25 years. Find the interest rate necessary if the
winner wants to deposit the $500,000 in a savings account
in order to have $1,000,000 in 25 years. Assume that the
interest is compounded quarterly.
50. Depreciation
A company buys a machine for $120,000.
During the next 5 years it will depreciate at a rate of 30%
per year. (That is, at the end of each year the depreciated
value will be 70% of what it was at the beginning of the
year.)
(a) Find the formula for the th term of a sequence that
gives the value 
of the machine full years after it was
purchased.

■Approximate the areas of regions using Riemann sums.
■Evaluate definite integrals.
In this appendix, a summation process is used to provide an alternative
development of the definite integral. It is intended that this supplement follow
Section 5.3 in the text. If used, this appendix should replace the material
preceding Example 2 in Section 5.4. Example 1 below shows how the area of a
region in the plane can be approximated by the use of rectangles.
Example 1
Using Rectangles to Approximate the Area of a Region
Use the four rectangles indicated in Figure A.1 to approximate the area of the
region lying between the graph of
and the x-axis, between 
and 
SOLUTION
You can find the heights of the rectangles by evaluating the function
f at each of the midpoints of the subintervals
Because the width of each rectangle is 1, the sum of the areas of the four
rectangles is
So, you can approximate the area of the region to be 10.5 square units.

The procedure shown in Example 1 can be generalized. Let f be a continuous
function defined on the closed interval 
To begin, partition the interval into
n subintervals, each of width 
as shown.
In each subinterval 
choose an arbitrary point 
and form the sum
This type of summation is called a Riemann sum, and is often written using sum-
mation notation as shown below.
For the Riemann sum in Example 1, the interval is

the width of each subinterval is

in each subinterval is its midpoint. So, you can write the approximation in

Example 2 illustrates an important point. If a function f is continuous and
nonnegative over the interval 
then the Riemann sum
can be used to approximate the area of the region bounded by the graph of f and
the x-axis, between 
and 
Moreover, for a given interval, as the 
number of subintervals increases, the approximation to the actual area will
improve. This is illustrated in the next two examples by using Riemann sums to
approximate the area of a triangle.

The approximations in Examples 2 and 3 are called left Riemann sums,
because 
was chosen to be the left endpoint of each subinterval. If the right 
endpoints had been used in Example 3, the right Riemann sum would have been
Note that the exact area of the triangular region in Example 3 is
So, the left Riemann sum gives an approximation that is less than the actual area,
and the right Riemann sum gives an approximation that is greater than the actual
area.
In Example 4, you will see that the approximation improves as the number
of subintervals increases.

From the results of Example 4, it appears that the Riemann sums are approach-
ing the limit 9 as n approaches infinity. It is this observation that motivates the
definition of a definite integral. In this definition, consider the partition of

as shown.
Moreover, consider

To
say that the number of subintervals n approaches infinity is equivalent to saying

If f is continuous and nonnegative on the interval 
then the definite
integral of f on 
gives the area of the region bounded by the graph of f, the 
x-axis, and the vertical lines 
and 
Evaluation of a definite integral by its limit definition can be difficult.
However, there are times when a definite integral can be solved by recognizing
that it represents the area of a common type of geometric figure.
Example 5
The Areas of Common Geometric Figures
Sketch the region corresponding to each of the definite integrals. Then evaluate
each definite integral using a geometric formula.

c.
SOLUTION
A sketch of each region is shown in Figure A.4.
a. The region associated with this definite integral is a rectangle of height 4 
and width 2. Moreover, because the function 
is continuous and 
nonnegative on the interval 
you can conclude that the area of the
rectangle is given by the definite integral. So, the value of the definite integral
is
b. The region associated with this definite integral is a trapezoid with an altitude
of 3 and parallel bases of lengths 2 and 5. The formula for the area of a
trapezoid is 
and so you have
c. The region associated with this definite integral is a semicircle of radius 2. So,
the area is

This limit can be evaluated in the same way that you calculated horizontal asymp-
totes in Section 3.6. In particular, as n approaches infinity, you see that 
approaches 0, and the limit above is 9. So, you can conclude that
From Example 6, you can see that it can be difficult to evaluate the definite
integral of even a simple function by using Riemann sums. A computer can help
in calculating these sums for large values of n, but this procedure would only give
an approximation of the definite integral. Fortunately, the Fundamental
Theorem of Calculus provides a technique for evaluating definite integrals using
antiderivatives, and for this reason it is often thought to be the most important 
theorem in calculus. In the remainder of this appendix, you will see how 
derivatives and integrals are related via the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus.
To simplify the discussion, assume that f is a continuous nonnegative 
function defined on the interval

C Differential Equations
General Solution of a Differential Equation
A differential equation is an equation involving a differentiable function and
one or more of its derivatives. For instance,
Differential equation
is a differential equation. A function 
is a solution of a differential 
equation if the equation is satisfied when y and its derivatives are replaced by 
and its derivatives. For instance,
Solution of differential equation
is a solution of the differential equation shown above. To see this, substitute for y
and 
in the original equation.
Substitute for y and 
In the same way, you can show that 
and 
are
also solutions of the differential equation. In fact, each function given by
General solution
where C is a real number, is a solution of the equation. This family of solutions
is called the general solution of the differential equation.

Differential Equations
Particular Solutions and Initial Conditions
A particular solution of a differential equation is any solution that is obtained
by assigning specific values to the constants in the general equation.*
Geometrically, the general solution of a differential equation is a family of
graphs called solution curves. For instance, the general solution of the differen-
tial equation 
is
General solution
Figure A.7 shows several solution curves of this differential equation.
Particular solutions of a differential equation are obtained from initial 
conditions placed on the unknown function and its derivatives. For instance,
in Figure A.7, suppose you want to find the particular solution whose graph 
passes through the point 
This initial condition can be written as
when
Initial condition
Substituting these values into the general solution produces 
which
implies that 
So, the particular solution is

Example 3
Finding a Particular Solution
You are working in the marketing department of a company that is producing a
new cereal product to be sold nationally. You determine that a maximum of 10
million units of the product could be sold in a year. You hypothesize that the rate
of growth of the sales x (in millions of units) is proportional to the difference
between the maximum sales and the current sales. As a differential equation, this
hypothesis can be written as
The general solution of this differential equation is
General solution
where t is the time in years. After 1 year, 250,000 units have been sold. Sketch
the graph of the sales function over a 10-year period.
SOLUTION
Because the product is new, you can assume that 
when 
So, you have two initial conditions.
when
First initial condition
when
Second initial condition
Substituting the first initial condition into the general solution produces
which implies that 
Substituting the second initial condition into the 
general solution produces
which implies that

Separation of Variables
Use separation of variables to solve differential equations. • Use differential equations to model and solve 
real-life problems.
Separation of Variables
The simplest type of differential equation is one of the form 
You know
that this type of equation can be solved by integration to obtain
In this section, you will learn how to use integration to solve another important
family of differential equations—those in which the variables can be separated.
This technique is called separation of variables.
Essentially, the technique of separation of variables is just what its name
implies. For a differential equation involving x and y, you separate the x variables
to one side and the y variables to the other. After separating variables, integrate
each side to obtain the general solution. Here is an example.

Example 1
Modeling Advertising Awareness
The new cereal product from Example 3 in Section C.1 is introduced through an
advertising campaign to a population of 1 million potential customers. The rate at
which the population hears about the product is assumed to be proportional to the
number of people who are not yet aware of the product. By the end of 1 year, half
of the population has heard of the product. How many will have heard of it by the
end of 2 years?
SOLUTION
Let y be the number (in millions) of people at time t who have heard
of the product. This means that 
is the number of people who have not
heard of it, and 
is the rate at which the population hears about the product.
From the given assumption, you can write the differential equation as shown.
Using separation of variables or a symbolic integration utility, you can find the
general solution to be

Example 2
Modeling a Chemical Reaction
During a chemical reaction, substance A is converted into substance B at a rate
that is proportional to the square of the amount of A. When 
60 grams of A
is present, and after 1 hour 
only 10 grams of A remains unconverted.
How much of A is present after 2 hours?
SOLUTION
Let y be the amount of unconverted substance A at any time t. From
the given assumption about the conversion rate, you can write the differential
equation as shown.
Using separation of variables or a symbolic integration utility, you can find the
general solution to be

Using the model, you can determine that the amount of unconverted substance A
after 2 hours is
In Figure A.14, note that the chemical conversion is occurring rapidly during the
first hour. Then, as more and more of substance A is converted, the conversion
rate slows down.

Earlier in the text, you studied two models for population growth:
exponential growth, which assumes that the rate of change of y is proportional to
y, and logistic growth, which assumes that the rate of change of y is proportional
to y and 
where L is the population limit.
The next example describes a third type of growth model called a Gompertz
growth model. This model assumes that the rate of change of y is proportional to
y and the natural log of 
where L is the population limit.
Example 3
Modeling Population Growth
A population of 20 wolves has been introduced into a national park. The forest
service estimates that the maximum population the park can sustain is 200
wolves. After 3 years, the population is estimated to be 40 wolves. If the
population follows a Gompertz growth model, how many wolves will there be 
10 years after their introduction?
SOLUTION
Let y be the number of wolves at any time t. From the given
assumption about the rate of growth of the population, you can write the 
differential equation as shown.
Using separation of variables or a symbolic integration utility, you can find the
general solution to be

In genetics, a commonly used hybrid selection model is based on the 
differential equation
In this model, y represents the portion of the population that has a certain charac-
teristic and t represents the time (measured in generations). The numbers a, b, and
k are constants that depend on the genetic characteristic that is being studied.
Example 4
Modeling Hybrid Selection
You are studying a population of beetles to determine how quickly characteristic
D will pass from one generation to the next. At the beginning of your study
you find that half the population has characteristic D. After four
generations 
you find that 80% of the population has characteristic D. Use
the hybrid selection model above with

population that will have characteristic D after 10 generations.

Modeling a Chemical Mixture
A tank contains 40 gallons of a solution composed of 90% water and 10% alcohol.
A second solution containing half water and half alcohol is added to the tank at 
the rate of 4 gallons per minute. At the same time, the tank is being drained at the
rate of 4 gallons per minute, as shown in Figure A.17. Assuming that the solution
is stirred constantly, how much alcohol will be in the tank after 10 minutes?
SOLUTION
Let y be the number of gallons of alcohol in the tank at any time t.
The percent of alcohol in the 40-gallon tank at any time is 
Moreover,
because 4 gallons of solution is being drained each minute, the rate of change of

Checkpoint 6
(a) About 0.259
(b) About 0.259
Because the graph of the probability density
function is symmetric about the line 
,
you know that the area under the graph over
the interval 
is equal to the area under
the graph over the interval 
From Example 6, you know that the probabili-
ty over 
is about 0.481. If you subtract
0.481 from 1 you obtain 0.519. Then divide
0.519 by 2 to obtain approximately 0.259,
which is the probability from parts (a) and (b).
