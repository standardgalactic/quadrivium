OPERATING SYSTEM
FUNDAMENTALS FOR HACKING
AND PENETRATION TESTING
Operating systems (OS) are the bedrock of
digital environments, and ethical hackers
must grasp the nuances of various OSs,
including Windows, Linux, and macOS, to
navigate their vulnerabilities effectively.
Windows, due to its widespread usage, is a
primary focus for hackers. However, Linux's
robust security features and open-source
nature make it invaluable for ethical hackers.
Operating system knowledge is a strategic
asset in the field of ethical hacking.
