THE APPROVED DOCUMENTS
This document is one of a series that has been
approved and issued by the Secretary of State
for the purpose of providing practical guidance
with respect to the requirements of Schedule 1
to and regulation 7 of the Building Regulations
2000 (SI 2000/2531) for England and Wales. SI
2000/2531 has been amended by the Building
(Amendment) Regulations 2001 (SI 2001/3335),
the Building (Amendment) Regulations 2002 (SI
2002/440), the Building (Amendment) (No 2)
Regulations 2002 (SI 2002/2871), the Building
(Amendment) Regulations 2003 (SI 2003/2692),
the Building (Amendment) Regulations 2004 (SI
2004/1465) and the Building (Amendment) (No
3) Regulations (SI 2004/3210).
At the back of this document is a list of all
the documents that have been approved and
issued by the Secretary of State for this
purpose.
Approved Documents are intended to provide
guidance for some of the more common
building situations. However, there may well be
alternative ways of achieving compliance with
the requirements. Thus there is no obligation
to adopt any particular solution contained in
an Approved Document if you prefer to meet
the relevant requirement in some other way.
Supplementary guidance
The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister
occasionally issues additional material to aid
interpretation of the guidance contained in
Approved Documents. This material may be
conveyed in official letters to Chief Executives
of Local Authorities and Approved Inspectors
and/or posted on the web sites accessed
through: http://www.odpm.gov.uk/building-
regulations.
Other requirements
The guidance contained in an Approved
Document relates only to the particular
requirements of the Regulations which the
document addresses. The building work will
also have to comply with the requirements of
any other relevant paragraphs in Schedule 1 to
the Regulations. 
There are Approved Documents which give
guidance on each of the Parts of Schedule 1
and on Regulation 7.
LIMITATION ON REQUIREMENTS
In accordance with regulation 8, the
requirements in Parts A to D, F to K, N and P
(except for paragraphs H2 and J6) of Schedule
1 to the Building Regulations do not require
anything to be done except for the purpose of
securing reasonable standards of health and
safety for persons in or about buildings (and
any others who may be affected by buildings or
matters connected with buildings). This is one
of the categories of purpose for which Building
Regulations may be made.
Paragraphs H2 and J6 are excluded from
regulation 8 because they deal directly with
prevention of the contamination of water. Parts
E and M (which deal, respectively, with
resistance to the passage of sound, and
access to and use of buildings) are excluded
from regulation 8 because they address the
welfare and convenience of building users. Part
L is excluded from regulation 8 because it
addresses the conservation of fuel and power.
All these matters are amongst the purposes,
other than health and safety, that may be
addressed by Building Regulations.
MATERIALS AND WORKMANSHIP
Any building work which is subject to the
requirements imposed by Schedule 1 to the
Building Regulations should, in accordance
with regulation 7, be carried out with proper
materials and in a workmanlike manner.
You may show that you have complied with
regulation 7 in a number of ways. These
include the appropriate use of a product
bearing CE marking in accordance with the
Construction Products Directive (89/106/EEC)1,
the Low Voltage Directive (73/23/EEC and
amendment 93/68/EEC)2 and the EMC Directive
(89/336/EEC)3, as amended by the CE marking
Directive (93/68/EEC)4, or a product complying
with an appropriate technical specification (as
defined in those Directives), a British Standard,
or an alternative national technical
specification of any state which is a
contracting party to the European Economic
Area which, in use, is equivalent, or a product
covered by a national or European certificate
issued by a European Technical Approval
issuing body, and the conditions of use are in
accordance with the terms of the certificate.
You will find further guidance in the Approved
Document supporting regulation 7 on materials
and workmanship.

Independent certification schemes
There are many UK product certification
schemes. Such schemes certify compliance
with the requirements of a recognised
document which is appropriate to the purpose
for which the material is to be used. Materials
which are not so certified may still conform to
a relevant standard.
Many certification bodies which approve such
schemes are accredited by UKAS.
Technical specifications
Under section 1(1)(a) of the Building Act 1984,
Building Regulations may be made for various
purposes including health, safety, welfare,
convenience, conservation of fuel and power
and prevention of contamination of water.
Standards and technical approvals are relevant
guidance to the extent that they relate to these
considerations. However, they may also
address other aspects of performance such as
serviceability, or aspects which, although they
relate to the purposes listed above, are not
covered by the current Regulations.
When an Approved Document makes reference
to a named standard, the relevant version of
the standard is the one listed at the end of the
publication. However, if this version has been
revised or updated by the issuing standards
body, the new version may be used as a source
of guidance provided it continues to address
the relevant requirements of the Regulations.
The appropriate use of a product which
complies with a European Technical Approval
as defined in the Construction Products
Directive will meet the relevant requirements.
The Office intends to issue periodic
amendments to its Approved Documents to
reflect emerging harmonised European
Standards. Where a national standard is to be
replaced by a European harmonised standard,
there will be a co-existence period during
which either standard may be referred to. At
the end of the co-existence period the national
standard will be withdrawn.
MIXED USE DEVELOPMENT
In mixed use developments part of a building
may be used as a dwelling while another part
has a non-domestic use. In such cases, if the
requirements of the Regulations for dwellings
and non-domestic use differ, the requirements
for non-domestic use should apply in any
shared parts of the building.
THE WORKPLACE (HEALTH,
SAFETY AND WELFARE)
REGULATIONS 1992
The Workplace (Health, Safety and Welfare)
Regulations 1992 as amended by The Health
and Safety (Miscellaneous Amendments)
Regulations 2002 (SI 2002/2174) contain some
requirements which affect building design. The
main requirements are now covered by the
Building Regulations, but for further information
see: ‘Workplace health, safety and welfare.

The Workplace (Health, Safety and Welfare)
Regulations 1992 apply to the common parts
of flats and similar buildings if people such as
cleaners and caretakers are employed to work
in these common parts. Where the
requirements of the Building Regulations that
are covered by this Part do not apply to
buildings other than dwellings, the provisions
may still be required in the situations
described above in order to satisfy the
Workplace Regulations.

THE BUILDING REGULATIONS 2000

This Approved Document, which takes effect
on 1 January 2005, deals with the requirements
of Part P of Schedule 1 to the Building
Regulations 2000 (as amended by SI
2004/3210).
NOTES
Examples of application of Part P 
Part P applies to electrical installations in
buildings or parts of buildings comprising:
•
dwelling houses and flats;
•
dwellings and business premises that
have a common supply – for example
shops and public houses with a flat
above;
•
common access areas in blocks of flats
such as corridors and staircases;
•
shared amenities of blocks of flats such
as laundries and gymnasiums.
Part P applies also to parts of the above
electrical installations: 
•
in or on land associated with the
buildings – for example Part P applies to
fixed lighting and pond pumps in
gardens;
•
in outbuildings such as sheds, detached
garages and greenhouses.
Changes to the Building
Regulations 2000 (as amended by
SI 2004/3210)
Interpretation (regulation 2)
Regulation 2 is amended to explain the Limit
on Application in Schedule 1, Part P and to
include fixed electrical installations in relation
to which Part P imposes a requirement:
•
The definition of ‘Controlled service or
fitting’ in regulation 2 is changed to:
‘Controlled service or fitting means a
service or fitting in relation to which Part
G, H, J, L or P of Schedule 1 imposes a
requirement.’
•
Definitions of ‘electrical installation’, ‘low
voltage’ and ‘extra-low voltage’ are
added.
Requirements relating to material change of
use (regulation 6)
Regulation 6(1)(a) is amended to include Part P
so that, when relevant, work in connection with
a material change of use must comply with the
technical requirements in Part P.
Limitation on requirements (regulation 8)
Regulation 8 is amended to include Part P so
that work covered by Part P is only needed for
the purpose of securing reasonable standards
of health and safety.
Exempt buildings and work (regulation 9)
Regulation 9 is amended so that the
requirements of Part P apply to electrical
installations in any greenhouse, small detached
building, conservatory, porch, covered yard or
way, and car port open on at least two sides.

Further guidance is available from the IEE
(Institution of Electrical Engineers) at
www.iee.org/Publish/WireRegs/IEE_Building_Re
gs.pdf. The NICEIC (National Inspection
Council for Electrical Installation Contracting)
and the ECA (Electrical Contractors’
Association) have also published the ‘Electrical
Installers’ Guide to the Building Regulations’
available from www.niceic.org.uk or
www.eca.co.uk.
Regulation 4(2) states that, on completion of
the work, the building should be no worse in
terms of the level of compliance with the other
applicable Parts of Schedule 1 to the Building
Regulations. For example, one or more
perforations of a ceiling lining beneath a floor -
made to accommodate recessed lighting or
similar fittings - may have an adverse effect on
that floor’s performance in terms of its
resistance to fire and sound penetration. Due
regard should therefore be paid to the
guidance in Approved Documents B and E on
the performance of compartment floors.

Section 0: 
GENERAL GUIDANCE
Performance
0.1
In the Secretary of State’s view, the
requirements will be met by adherence to the
‘Fundamental Principles’ for achieving safety
given in BS 7671: 2001 Chapter 13. To
achieve these requirements electrical
installations must be:
a.
designed and installed to afford
appropriate protection against
mechanical and thermal damage, and
so that they do not present electric
shock and fire hazards to people;
b. suitably inspected and tested to verify
that they meet the relevant equipment
and installation standards.
General
0.2
A way of satisfying the fundamental
principles would be to follow:
a.
the technical rules described in the
body of BS 7671: 2001, or an
equivalent standard approved by a
member of the EEA that includes
issuing an electrical installation
certificate to the person ordering the
work; and
b. guidance given in installation manuals
that are consistent with BS 7671:
2001, such as:
i)
the IEE (Institution of Electrical
Engineers) On-Site Guide;
ii)
the series of IEE Publications,
Guidance Notes Nos 1 to 7.
0.3
The diagrams in Appendix A give an
indication of the sorts of electrical services
encountered in dwellings, some of the ways
they can be connected and the complexity of
the wiring and protective systems necessary to
supply them. They are intended as an
indication of the scope of Part P for those
who are not electricians; they must not be
used for installation purposes.
Definitions
0.4
The following meanings apply throughout
this document:
Electrical installation is defined in BS 76711
as ‘an assembly of associated electrical
equipment supplied from a common origin to
fulfil a specific purpose and having certain co-
ordinated characteristics.’ For the purposes of
Building Regulations an electrical installation
means fixed electrical cables or fixed electrical
equipment located on the consumer’s side of
the electricity supply meter.
Extra-low voltage is defined in BS 7671 as
‘normally not exceeding 50 V ac or 120 V ripple-
free dc, whether between conductors or to earth.’
Low voltage is defined in BS 7671 as ‘normally
exceeding extra-low voltage but not exceeding
1000 V ac or 1500 V dc between conductors,
or 600 V ac or 900 V dc between conductors
and earth.’
Kitchen is defined in the Building Regulations
as ‘a room or part of a room which contains a
sink and food preparation facilities’.
As a guide only, in open plan areas the zone of
a kitchen may be considered to extend from the
edge of the sink to a distance of 3m or to a
nearer dividing wall.
Other Regulations
0.5
Electrical work is also affected by the
Electricity at Work Regulations 1989 as
amended and the Electricity Safety, Quality and
Continuity Regulations 2002 as amended, as
described in paragraphs 3.1 to 3.13.
Notification of work
0.6
The requirements apply to all electrical
installation work.
When necessary to involve building control
bodies
0.7
Except in the circumstances outlined in
paragraph 0.8 below, notification of proposals to
carry out electrical installation work must be given
to a building control body before work begins.
When not necessary to involve building control
bodies
0.8
It is not necessary to give prior
notification of proposals to carry out electrical
installation work to building control bodies in
the following circumstances:
a. The proposed installation work is
undertaken by a person2 who is a
competent person registered with an
electrical self-certification scheme
authorised by the Secretary of State.
In these cases the person is
responsible for ensuring compliance
with BS 7671: 2001 and all relevant
Building Regulations. On completion
of the work, the person ordering the
work should receive a signed Building
Regulations self-certification
certificate, and the relevant building
control body should receive a copy of
the information on the certificate. The
person ordering the work should also
receive a duly completed Electrical

Installation Certificate as or similar to
the model in BS 76713 (see
paragraphs 1.6 to 1.12). As required
by BS 7671, the certificate must be
made out and signed by the
competent person or persons who
carried out the design, construction,
inspection and testing work. Copies
of relevant BS 7671: 2001 model
forms are shown in Appendix B.
OR
b. The proposed electrical installation
work is non-notifiable work of the
type described in Table 1 and does
not include the provision of a new
circuit.
i)
When the non-notifiable work
described in Table 1 is to be
undertaken professionally, a way
of showing compliance would be
to follow BS 7671: 2001 and to
issue to the person ordering the
work a Minor Electrical
Installation Works Certificate as or
similar to the model in BS 76713
(see paragraphs 1.6 to 1.12). A
copy of this form is shown in
Appendix B. As required by BS
7671, the certificate must be
made out and signed by a
competent person in respect of
the inspection and testing of an
installation. The competent
person need not necessarily be a
person registered with an
electrical self-certification
scheme, and may be a third party. 
ii)
When the non-notifiable work
described in Table 1 is to be
undertaken by a DIY worker, a
way of showing compliance would
be to follow the IEE guidance or
guidance in other authoritative
manuals that are based on this,
and to have a competent person
inspect and test the work and
supply a Minor Electrical
Installation Works Certificate. The
competent person need not
necessarily be registered with an
electrical self-certification scheme
but, as required by BS 7671, must
be competent in respect of the
inspection and testing of an
installation.
iii) In any event, non-notifiable works
should be drawn to the attention
of the person carrying out
subsequent work or periodic
inspections. A way of doing this
would be to supply Minor
Electrical Installation Works
Certificates covering the additions
and alterations made since the
original construction of the
installation or since the most
recent periodic inspection.

ELECTRICAL SAFETY
DESIGN, INSTALLATION,
INSPECTION AND TESTING
General
1.1
Where electrical installation work is to be
carried out professionally, compliance is
necessary with the Electricity at Work
Regulations 1989 as amended.
1.2
Electrical installations should be
designed and installed, suitably enclosed and
separated by appropriate distances to provide
mechanical and thermal protection, so that
they incorporate measures that afford
appropriate protection for persons against the
risks of electric shock, burn or fire injuries.
1.3
The Electricity Safety, Quality and
Continuity Regulations 2002 require the
electricity distributor to install the cut-out and
meter in a safe location, where they are
mechanically protected and can be safely
maintained. In compliance with this
requirement, the electricity distributor and
installer may be required to take into account
the risk of flooding4.
1.4
In accordance with the Electricity Safety,
Quality and Continuity Regulations 2002 and
the contract for a mains supply, proposals for
new installations or significant alterations to
existing ones must be agreed with the
electricity distributor.
Accessibility
1.5
Wall-mounted switches and socket-
outlets should be located so that they are
easily reachable where this is necessary to
comply with Part M of the Building Regulations.
Approved Document M shows ways of
complying. Accessible consumer units should
be fitted with a child-proof cover or installed in
a lockable cupboard.
Inspection and testing before
taking into service
1.6
Electrical installations should be
inspected and tested during and at the end of
installation, before they are taken into service,
to verify that they are reasonably safe, that is
to say that they comply with BS 7671: 2001.
1.7 
A way of demonstrating this compliance
would be to follow the procedures in Chapter
74 of BS 7671: 2001, and to supply:
a. to the person ordering the work
copies of the forms called for, signed
by a person competent to do so; and
b. in the case of a competent person
registered with an electrical self-
certification scheme, to the building
control body a declaration that
compliance with the Building
Regulations has been achieved.
1.8
The forms called for in paragraph 1.7a.
above should show that the electrical
installation work has been:
a. Inspected (this is necessary during
erection as well as on completion) to
verify that the components are:
i) 
made in compliance with
appropriate British Standards or
harmonised European Standards;
ii) selected and installed in
accordance with BS 7671
(including consideration of
external influences such as the
presence of moisture);
iii) not visibly damaged or defective
so as to be unsafe.
b. Tested to check satisfactory
performance in relation to continuity
of conductors, insulation resistance,
separation of circuits, polarity,
earthing and bonding arrangements,
earth fault loop impedance and
functionality of all protective devices
including residual current devices.
1.9 
Section 712 of BS 7671: 2001 provides a
list of all the inspections that may be necessary
although in particular cases only some
elements may be relevant. A schedule of
inspections is given in Appendix 6 of BS 7671,
and a copy is included in this Approved
Document at Appendix B.
1.10 Section 713 of BS 7671: 2001 provides a
list of all the tests that may be necessary
although in particular cases only some
elements may be relevant. A blank schedule of
test results is given in Appendix 6 of BS 7671,
and a copy is included in this Approved
Document at Appendix B. Tests should be
carried out using appropriate and accurate
instruments under the conditions given in BS
7671, and the results should be recorded on
forms like the model in Appendix 6 of BS 7671.
The results should be compared with the
relevant performance criteria to confirm
compliance.
1.11 The inspection and testing of DIY work
should meet the above requirements.

CHANGES OF USE
2.1
Where any electrical installation work is
classified as an extension, a material alteration
or a material change of use, the addition and
alteration work must include:
a. such works on the existing fixed
electrical installation in the building as
are necessary to enable the additions
and alterations, the circuits which
feed them, the protective measures
and the relevant earthing and bonding
systems to meet the requirements;
and
b. establishing that the mains supply
equipment is suitable.
2.2
A way of complying would be to follow
the guidance given above in relation to design
and installation and to show that for the altered
circumstances:
a. the rating and the condition of the
existing equipment belonging to both
the consumer and to the electricity
distributor:
i) 
can carry the additional loads
being allowed for, or 
ii) are improved so that they can
carry the additional loads being
allowed for; and
b. the correct protective measures are
used; and
c. the earthing and equipotential
bonding arrangements are
satisfactory.

present state of the Electricity at Work
Regulations 1989 following amendments by
Statutory Instruments 1996/192, 1997/1993
and 1999/2024.
3.3 
Regulation 3 imposes duties on
employers, employees and the self-employed.
Regulation 3(2)(b) places duties on employees
equivalent to those placed on employers and
self-employed persons where there are matters
within their control.
3.4 
The text of the Electricity at Work
Regulations and guidance on how to comply
with them are contained in the Health and
Safety guidance document ‘Memorandum of
Guidance on the Electricity at Work Regulations
1989 – HSR25’. Important elements of the
Regulations include:
a. The Electricity at Work Regulations
require that electrical work is only
carried out by persons that are
competent to prevent danger and injury
while doing it, or who are appropriately
supervised (Regulation 16).
b. The Electricity at Work Regulations
set general requirements for the
design, construction and suitability of
equipment for its intended use
(Regulations 4(1), 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10,
11, 12).
Electricity Safety, Quality and
Continuity Regulations 2002
3.5 
The Electricity Safety, Quality and
Continuity Regulations 2002 (Statutory Instrument
2002/2665) came into force on 31 January 2003.
These Regulations replaced the Electricity Supply
Regulations 1988 (as amended).
3.6 
The Regulations specify safety standards
which are aimed at protecting the general
public from danger. In addition, the Regulations
specify power quality and supply continuity
requirements to ensure an efficient and
economic electricity supply service for
consumers. The Regulations were introduced to
improve standards in public safety and to align
requirements to modern electricity markets.
3.7 
The duty holders are generators,
distributors, suppliers, meter operators,
consumers and specified persons. Most of the
duties apply to distributors who own or operate
networks used to supply consumers’
installations, street furniture or other networks.
3.8 
Amongst other duties, distributors are
required to provide an earthing facility for new
connections (unless this would be inappropriate
for safety reasons), to maintain the supply within
defined tolerance limits and to provide certain
technical and safety information to consumers
to enable them to design their installations.
3.9 
Distributors and meter operators must
ensure that their equipment on consumers’
premises is suitable for its purpose and safe in
its particular environment and that the polarity
of conductors is clearly indicated.
3.10 The Regulations allow the Secretary of
State to issue safety enforcement notices to
consumers in circumstances where consumers’
installations outside buildings present a danger
to the public.
3.11 In relation to ‘embedded’ generation6 , the
Regulations require persons operating ‘switched
alternative’ sources of energy in their installations
to prevent a parallel connection occurring with
the distributor’s network and to comply with BS
7671. Sources of energy that operate in parallel
with the distributor’s network must meet certain
additional safety standards: for example the
equipment must not be a source of danger or
cause interference with the distributor’s network.
Persons installing domestic combined heat and
power equipment must advise the local
distributor of their intentions before or at the time
of commissioning the source.
3.12 Distributors are prevented by the
Regulations from connecting installations to their
networks which do not comply with BS 7671.
Other persons may connect installations to
distributors’ networks providing they obtain the
prior consent of the distributor, who may require
evidence that the installation complies with BS
7671 and that the connection itself will meet
safety and operational requirements. Distributors
may disconnect consumers’ installations which
are a source of danger or cause interference with
their networks or other installations. 
3.13 Detailed Guidance on the Regulations is
available at www.dti.gov.uk/electricity-regulations.
Functionality requirements
3.14 Part P of the Building Regulations makes
requirements covering the safety of fixed
electrical installations, but does not cover system
functionality. The functionality of electrically
powered systems such as fire alarm systems,
fans and pumps is covered in other Parts of the
Building Regulations and other legislation. 
Section 3:
6
‘Embedded’ generators are those connected to the
distribution networks of public electricity suppliers
rather than directly to the National Grid. Most CHP and
renewable generating stations are embedded.

Notes
1)
The diagrams do not give all the
information needed to achieve compliance with
BS 7671, nor do they cover all the electrical
services found in dwellings, some of which (eg
swimming pools and saunas) are subject to
special requirements specified in Part 6 of BS
7671: 2001. The diagrams must not be used
for installation purposes.
2) 
The diagrams are simplified examples of
what may be encountered. They are not a
substitute for the proper consideration of for
instance:
a) Cross-sectional areas (csa) of the
phase and neutral conductors of
circuits. The minimum csa required by
BS 7671 depends on a number of
variables, including: type of cable,
number of cores, type and nominal
current of overcurrent protective
device, grouping with other circuits,
ambient temperature, contact with
thermally insulating materials, and
circuit length.
b) Cross-sectional areas of protective
conductors. BS 7671 contains
different rules, involving a number of
variables, for determining the
minimum csa for each type of
protective conductor, including the
earthing conductor, circuit protective
conductors, main equipotential
bonding conductors, and
supplementary bonding conductors.
c) Types and nominal current ratings of
fuses or circuit breakers. These
particulars depend on the circuit
design current and load
characteristics, and need to be co-
ordinated with the circuit conductors
and with the earth fault loop
impedance of the circuit.
d) Types of wiring or wiring system.
While PVC insulated and sheathed
cables are likely to be suitable for
much of the wiring in a typical
dwelling, other types of cable may
also be necessary. For example, heat-
resisting flexible cables are required
for the final connections to certain
equipment; the cable to the garage or
shed, if run underground, is subject to
certain requirements; and cables
concealed in floors and walls in
certain circumstances are required to
have an earthed metal covering, be
enclosed in steel conduit, or have
additional mechanical protection.
e) Principles of cable routing. BS 7671
contains criteria for the routing and
positioning of cables, so as to give
protection against electric shock and
fire as a result of mechanical damage
to a cable. For example, such criteria
are given for cables concealed in
walls or buried in the ground.
f) Current ratings of circuits to fixed
current-using equipment such as a
shower or cooker.
In the above context, diagrams are given as
follows:
Diagram 1(a) indicates the many electrical
appliances that can be found in the home and
how they might be supplied.
Diagram 1(b) indicates earthing and bonding
arrangements that can be necessary.
Diagram 2(a) indicates earthing arrangements
as might be provided by electricity distributors.
Diagram 2(b) indicates the earthing
arrangement as might need to be provided by

GUIDANCE FOR RECIPIENTS
This safety Certificate has been issued to confirm that the electrical installation work to which it relates has
been designed, constructed and inspected and tested in accordance with British Standard 7671 (The IEE
Wiring Regulations).
You should have received an original Certificate and the contractor should have retained a duplicate
Certificate. If you were the person ordering the work, but not the user of the installation, you should pass this
Certificate, or a full copy of it including the schedules, immediately to the user.
The "original" Certificate should be retained in a safe place and be shown to any person inspecting or
undertaking further work on the electrical installation in the future. If you later vacate the property, this
Certificate will demonstrate to the new owner that the electrical installation complied with the requirements of
British Standard 7671 at the time the Certificate was issued. The Construction (Design and Management)
Regulations require that for a project covered by those Regulations, a copy of this Certificate, together with
schedules is included in the project health and safety documentation.
For safety reasons, the electrical installation will need to be inspected at appropriate intervals by a
competent person. The maximum time interval recommended before the next inspection is stated on Page 1
under "Next Inspection".
This Certificate is intended to be issued only for a new electrical installation or for new work associated with
an alteration or addition to an existing installation. It should not have been issued for the inspection of an
existing electrical installation. A "Periodic Inspection Report" should be issued for such a periodic inspection.

ELECTRICAL INSTALLATION CERTIFICATE
GUIDANCE FOR RECIPIENTS (to be appended to the Certificate)
This safety Certificate has been issued to confirm that the electrical installation work to which it relates has
been designed, constructed and inspected and tested in accordance with British Standard 7671 (The IEE
Wiring Regulations).
You should have received an original Certificate and the contractor should have retained a duplicate
Certificate. If you were the person ordering the work, but not the user of the installation, you should pass this
Certificate, or a full copy of it including the schedules, immediately to the user.
The "original" Certificate should be retained in a safe place and be shown to any person inspecting or
undertaking further work on the electrical installation in the future. If you later vacate the property, this
Certificate will demonstrate to the new owner that the electrical installation complied with the requirements of
British Standard 7671 at the time the Certificate was issued. The Construction (Design and Management)
Regulations require that for a project covered by those Regulations, a copy of this Certificate, together with
schedules is included in the project health and safety documentation.
For safety reasons, the electrical installation will need to be inspected at appropriate intervals by a competent
person. The maximum time interval recommended before the next inspection is stated on Page 1 under "Next
Inspection".
This Certificate is intended to be issued only for a new electrical installation or for new work associated with
an alteration or addition to an existing installation. It should not have been issued for the inspection of an
existing electrical installation. A "Periodic Inspection Report" should be issued for such a periodic inspection.
The Certificate is only valid if a Schedule of Inspections and Schedule of Test Result are appended.

NOTES ON COMPLETION OF MINOR ELECTRICAL INSTALLATION WORKS
CERTIFICATE
Scope
The Minor Works Certificate is intended to be used for additions and alterations to an installation that do not
extend to the provision of a new circuit. Examples include the addition of a socket-outlet or a lighting point to
an existing circuit, the relocation of a light switch etc. This Certificate may also be used for the replacement of
equipment such as accessories or luminaires, but not for the replacement of distribution boards or similar
items. Appropriate inspection and testing, however, should always be carried out irrespective of the extent of
the work undertaken.
Part 1 Description of minor works 
1,2
The minor works must be so described that the work that is the subject of the certification can be
readily identified.
4
See Regulations 120-01-03 and 120-02. No departures are to be expected except in most unusual
circumstances. See also Regulation 743-01-01.
Part 2 Installation details 
2
The method of protection against indirect contact shock must be clearly identified, e.g. earthed
equipotential bonding and automatic disconnection of supply using fuse/circuit-breaker/RCD.
4
If the existing installation lacks either an effective means of earthing or adequate main equipotential
bonding conductors, this must be clearly stated. See Regulation 743-01-02.
Recorded departures from BS 7671 may constitute non-compliance with the Electricity Supply
Regulations 1988 as amended or the Electricity at Work Regulations 1989. It is important that the client
is advised immediately in writing.
Part 3 Essential tests 
The relevant provisions of Part 7 (Inspection and Testing) of BS 7671 must be applied in full to all minor works.
For example, where a socket-outlet is added to an existing circuit it is necessary to:
1
establish that the earthing contact of the socket-outlet is connected to the main earthing terminal
2
measure the insulation resistance of the circuit that has been added to, and establish that it complies
with Table 71A of BS 7671
3
measure the earth fault loop impedance to establish that the maximum permitted disconnection time is
not exceeded
4
check that the polarity of the socket-outlet is correct
5
(if the work is protected by an RCD) verify the effectiveness of the RCD.
Part 4 Declaration 
1,3
The Certificate shall be made out and signed by a competent person in respect of the design,
construction, inspection and testing of the work.
1,3
The competent person will have a sound knowledge and experience relevant to the nature of the work
undertaken and to the technical standards set down in BS 7671, be fully versed in the inspection and
testing procedures contained in the Regulations and employ adequate testing equipment.

MINOR ELECTRICAL INSTALLATION WORKS CERTIFICATE 
GUIDANCE FOR RECIPIENTS (to be appended to the Certificate)
This Certificate has been issued to confirm that the electrical installation work to which it relates has been
designed, constructed and inspected and tested in accordance with British Standard 7671 (The IEE Wiring
Regulations).
You should have received an original Certificate and the contractor should have retained a duplicate. If you
were the person ordering the work, but not the owner of the installation, you should pass this Certificate, or a
copy of it, to the owner.
A separate Certificate should have been received for each existing circuit on which minor works have been
carried out. This Certificate is not appropriate if you requested the contractor to undertake more extensive
installation work, for which you should have received an Electrical Installation Certificate.
The Certificate should be retained in a safe place and be shown to any person inspecting or undertaking
further work on the electrical installation in the future. If you later vacate the property, this Certificate will
demonstrate to the new owner that the minor electrical installation work carried out complied with the
requirements of British Standard 7671 at the time the Certificate was issued.

Appendix C: Older practice that can be
encountered in alteration work
When carrying out work on existing, older
installations, some features will be encountered
which differ from those found in modern
installations.
Electrical installations began to be
commonplace in domestic dwellings as early as
the 1920s, and over the years there have been
considerable changes to the types of wiring
materials and other equipment being installed,
and in the ways that electrical installations are
structured. From the electrical safety point of
view, these changes have had two main
causes: advances in technology, and
amendments to the Wiring Regulations
published by the Institution of Electrical
Engineers (issued as British Standard BS 7671
since 1992).
This appendix presents examples of the types
of features just mentioned, which may be
unfamiliar to those who find them and may be
a safety hazard. Also included, where
applicable, are comments about changes in the
Wiring Regulations relevant to the equipment
concerned.
Use of a gas, water or other
service pipe as an earth
(No proper means of earthing for the
electrical installation)
It is not permitted to use a gas, water or other
metal service pipe as a means of earthing for
an electrical installation. (This does not
preclude equipotential bonding connections to
these pipes.) It never has been permitted for
gas pipes, and has not been permitted for
other service pipes since 1966. 
Every electrical installation requires a proper
means of earthing. The most usual type is an
electricity distributor’s earthing terminal, provided
for this purpose near the electricity meter.
Absence of, or inadequately sized,
main equipotential bonding
conductors
Prior to 1966 the Wiring Regulations contained
no requirements for main equipotential bonding.
Since then, the installation of main equipotential
bonding conductors has been required to water
service pipes, gas installation pipes, oil supply
pipes, and certain other ‘earthy’ metalwork that
may be present on the premises.
During the 1980s new Regulations were
introduced, requiring the minimum size of main
equipotential bonding conductors to be larger
than previously called for, particularly where
there is a PME (protective multiple earthing)
electricity supply. For most dwellings the
minimum size now permitted to be installed is
10 mm2. 
OLDER PRACTICE AND ALTERATION WORK

Electrical safety
Approved Document P
35
P
OLDER PRACTICE AND ALTERATION WORK
Absence of, or inadequately sized,
supplementary equipotential
bonding
Prior to 1981 there were virtually no
requirements in the Wiring Regulations for
supplementary equipotential bonding
conductors.
Since then, the installation of supplementary
equipotential bonding conductors has been
required in installations and locations of
increased electric shock risk, such as
bathrooms and shower rooms.
During the 1980s and 1990s the requirements for
the sizing of supplementary equipotential
bonding conductors were amended. For most
dwellings the minimum size now permitted to be
installed without mechanical protection is 4 mm2.
Double-pole fusing
In many installations put in up to the 1950s,
the circuits have a fuse in the neutral
conductor as well as in the phase conductor.
This is a potentially dangerous practice for ac
installations, and ceased to be permitted by
the Wiring Regulations in about 1955.
In the event of a short-circuit, there is a 50%
chance that the fuse in the neutral conductor
will operate. When this happens, the phase
conductor is not automatically disconnected
from the faulty circuit as would now normally
be expected, thereby leaving a danger for
the unwary.
Voltage-operated earth-leakage
circuit-breakers
Two basic types of earth-leakage circuit-
breaker used to be recognised by the Wiring
Regulations: the current-operated type and the
voltage-operated type. Today, only the current-
operated type is recognised (now called
residual current devices or RCDs).
The voltage-operated type ceased to be
recognised in 1981. It can be distinguished by
its two separate earthing terminals – one for an
earthing connection to the load and one for an
earthing connection to a means of earthing
(often a driven rod). The major drawback with
this type of device is that a parallel earth path
can render it disabled.
No circuit protective conductors
in lighting circuits
Lighting circuits installed before 1966, and not
including any metalwork needing to be earthed,
often do not include a circuit protective
conductor. Consequently, any new or
replacement light fittings, switches or other
components must be of a type not requiring
earthing, eg non-metallic varieties, unless new
circuit protective (earthing) conductors are
provided. Otherwise, there will be a potential
danger of indirect contact (electric shock).
All lighting circuits installed since 1966 (with
the exception of certain extra-low voltage
circuits) have been required to include a circuit
protective conductor.

OLDER PRACTICE AND ALTERATION WORK
Non-13 A socket-outlets
The installation of socket-outlets other than the
current standard 13 A square-pinned type was
common prior to the early 1950s. These outlets
accept non-fused plugs (some with an earth pin
and some without), generally having round pins.
These older types of socket-outlet designed for
non-fused plugs must not be connected to a ring
circuit. Such an arrangement can be dangerous.
In addition, socket-outlets that will accept
unearthed (2-pin) plugs must not be used to
supply equipment needing to be earthed. It is
strongly recommended that such outlets be
taken out of service. 
No RCD protection for socket-
outlets likely to supply portable
equipment outdoors
(or an insufficient number of such
socket-outlets so protected)
A person receiving an electric shock when
using portable electrical equipment outdoors
can be at great risk of death or serious injury.
The risk is significantly reduced if the socket-
outlet supplying the equipment is provided with
sensitive RCD protection  (fitted either at the
socket-outlet itself or at the consumer unit).
However, prior to 1981 the Wiring Regulations
did not require such protection.
Nowadays, sensitive RCD protection1 is
required for all socket-outlets which are
installed having a rating of 32 A or less, and
which may reasonably be expected to supply
portable equipment for use outdoors. The initial
requirement, in 1981, was for this protection to
be provided to at least one such socket-outlet.
However, this was found to be inadequate.
Green coloured protective
conductors or sleeving instead of
green-yellow
The Wiring Regulations used to accept the
single colour green for the identification of
protective conductors.
However, since 1977 a green-yellow coding has
been required for all protective conductors
installed.
The older green sleeving or tape should be
replaced with the new green-yellow striped
variety whenever connections are re-made.
Concealed cables outside of
permitted zones in walls
Until the latter part of the 1980s the Wiring
Regulations did not contain any specific
requirements for the positioning of cables
concealed in walls and partitions.
Today’s requirements are given in Regulation
522-06-06 in BS 7671, and are illustrated here.
To avoid striking a cable, extreme care should
always be taken in any activity that involves
penetrating a wall or partition, even when it is
known that any concealed cables were
installed in recent years. Where the cables
were installed prior to 1980 they are
particularly likely to be found outside of the
zones illustrated opposite. A cable and stud
detector should always be used before
attempting to drill into walls, floors or ceilings.

current of not more than 30 mA

OLDER PRACTICE AND ALTERATION WORK
2.5 mm2 twin-and-earth cables
incorporating circuit protective
conductor of only 1.0 mm2
For some years, 2.5 mm2 twin & earth pvc/pvc
cables to BS 6004 were manufactured with a
circuit protective conductor (cpc) of only 1 mm2,
rather than 1.5 mm2 as is incorporated today. 
The size of the cpc was increased to 1.5 mm2
in BS 6004 because in certain circumstances
the 1 mm2 cpc may not always be properly
protected against thermal effects in the event
of an earth fault. This is where the cable is
used in a ring final circuit protected by a 30 A
semi-enclosed (rewirable) fuse. If this is the
case, a competent electrician should be
consulted about upgrading the cables and/or
the consumer unit. 
Accessories on wooden
mounting blocks
It was commonplace up to the mid 1960s for
accessories such as socket-outlets, lighting
switches and ceiling roses to be fixed to
wooden mounting blocks.
The design of the accessories is often such
that the wooden block is used to form part of
the enclosure for the unsheathed cores and
terminations of cables connecting to the
accessory. However, depending on the
particular characteristics of the material from
which the block is made, it may not satisfy the
ignitability requirements of the current Wiring
Regulations (BS 7671) for such use. 
Cables of imperial (non-metric)
sizes
Up until the beginning of the 1970s, cables
could still be purchased having imperial, rather
than metric, sized conductors. Many such
cables are still to be found in older installations.
Their conductors may be single-stranded (as in
1/.044) or may have three, seven or more
strands (as in 3/.029, 7/.029 and 19/.044). To
the inexperienced eye these cables may be
difficult to recognise, other than perhaps by
comparison of their conductors with those of
metric cables. The important thing to
appreciate, however, is that their current
carrying capacity and voltage drop
characteristics are likely to be different from
those which may at first be expected. It would
therefore be prudent to engage a competent
electrician to establish whether the
performance limits are being exceeded, or
would be if a new appliance with a higher
rating (eg washing machine, dishwasher, towel
rail, appliances rated at more than 2 kW) were
to be connected.
Finally, it should be noted that copper
conductors of imperial cables may be of the
tinned type, giving them an unfamiliar colour.

OLDER PRACTICE AND ALTERATION WORK
Tough rubber sheathed (TRS),
vulcanised rubber insulation
(VRI) cables
Prior to the use of pvc insulated cables
becoming common in the 1960s, most cables
installed in domestic dwellings were of the
rubber insulated, tough-rubber sheathed (TRS)
type. These are easily recognizable by their
black exterior.
The extent to which the insulation and sheath
deteriorate in service depends very much on
whether the cable has been subjected to
overloading and/or excessive temperature, or
the rubber has been exposed to direct sunlight.
Deterioration results in a loss of insulating
properties, with the rubber becoming dry and
inflexible – perhaps with a tendency to crumble.
Such wiring installations should be tested by a
competent person at the earliest opportunity,
but otherwise left undisturbed until
replacement, as they are beyond their normally
expected safe working life. 
Lead-sheathed cables
Lead sheathed cables may be found in some
installations dating from before about 1948.
These have rubber insulated, tinned copper
conductors and an outer sheath of lead.
For reasons of protection against indirect
contact (electric shock) it is essential that the
lead sheath of every such cable is, and will
remain, properly earthed.
The conductor insulation, being made of
rubber, is prone to deterioration as described
above for TRS cables.
Again, such wiring installations should be
tested by a competent person at the earliest
opportunity as they are beyond their normally
expected safe working life.

Amendment No 2 to BS 7671: 2001 published
on 31 March 2004 specifies new (harmonised)
cable core colours for all new fixed wiring in
electrical installations in the UK. It includes
guidance for alterations and additions to
installations wired in the old cable colours.
Table D1 below gives the new cable core
colours for ac power circuits. Figure D1 shows
examples of flat and armoured single phase
and 3-phase ac power cables with the old and
the new harmonised colours.
The new (harmonised) colour cables may be
used on site from 31 March 2004. New
installations or alterations to existing
installations may use either new or old colours,
but not both, from 31 March 2004 until 31
March 2006. Only the new colours may be used
after 31 March 2006.
For single phase installations in domestic
premises, the new colours are the same as
those for flexible cables to appliances, namely
green-and-yellow, blue and brown for the
protective, neutral and phase conductors
respectively.

identification colours for extra-low voltage and
dc power circuits, is available from the
following sources:
