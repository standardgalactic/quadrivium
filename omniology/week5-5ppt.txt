Ventilation & Alveolar Gas Pressure  
Hypoventilation: 
CO2 production > alveolar 
ventilation (increased PCO2 in 
arterial blood). 
 
 
Hyperventilation: 
CO2 production < alveolar 
ventilation (decreased PCO2 
in arterial blood).

O2 Transport 
Normally, diffusion of O2 across pulmonary capillaries is 
always sufficient, even with exercise.  
 
PAO2 determines the diffusion gradients throughout the 
cardio-pulmonary system.

Hemoglobin 
Total amount of O2 in blood depends on PO2 and amount of Hb in blood! 
98-99% is O2-Hb in RBC, 1-2% is free in plasma

Hb affinity for O2 changes: “loading” (left shift)  
 
                  “unloading” (right shift) 
Near active cells, unloading due to:  
** elevated PCO2, 2,3DPG, & temperature as well as low pH (acidity).

•
Alveolar PO2 is determined by the PO2 of 
atmospheric air, the alveolar ventilation rate, 
and RQ. 
 
•
Oxygen transport is not limited by diffusion. 
 
•
Oxygen is transported in blood by binding to 
Hb which increases its concentration 70-fold 
compared to its intrinsic solubility.
