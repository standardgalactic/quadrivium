Introduction
The Value of Economics in Daily Life
You may be reading this because you have enrolled in an economic principles 
class, or you may be simply curious about basic economics. In buying it, you 
probably thought you were signing up for a discussion of inflation, unemployment, 
interest rates, whether the standard of living is going up or down, outsourcing, 
the gyrations of the stock market, and other topics that seem somehow to be 
related to “economics” and often find their way into the news.
All in good time. But before gaining any further understanding on these 
matters, we have to start from the foundation of the economic way of thinking. 
For that is what economics is—not a list of specific topics, but a systematic 
way of thinking about all topics. The list of concepts to which the economic 
way of thinking can be applied vastly exceeds the short list just mentioned. 
To tackle those things without mastering the economic way of thinking about 
them is to put the cart before the horse. This way of thinking has taken 
several centuries to develop and has proven its usefulness in addressing one 
social problem after another. But it is not the only way to think about society 
and how it works. As you read this, try to fit what you learn about economics 
into what else you have learned about the world and how to think about 
it—history, philosophy, psychology, and even literature all have useful things 
to say about human decision making and the society that results from it.

The Foundation of Modern Economics:  
The Idea of Scarcity
Consider the following questions, which might seem far removed from the 
seemingly “core” economic topics in the first paragraph:
• 
Q1.1 Look at a photograph of a public scene—on a 
street, in a baseball stadium—or a private one like this 
party for college freshmen1 at Rice University in the early 
1970s. In addition to somewhat different standards of 
dress, one thing obvious from the party picture is that 
people were much thinner then. Why have people in the 
United States gotten so much heavier over the years? 
Before you answer, realize that this is a phenomenon that 
is occurring not just in the U.S. but in countries all over 
the world.
• 
Q1.2 Much commentary in recent years has focused 
on rising inequality of income in the U.S. Despite that, 
a phenomenon associated with previous centuries of 
inequality has almost disappeared: the personal servant. 
Noble families in Europe might easily have had dozens of 
household servants. Yet even the wealthiest now get by 
with relatively few; it is hard to imagine Bill Gates having 
the kind of massive household staff that the typical English 
manor in the mid-1800s might have. What changed? (See 
Arnold Kling’s blog post “Where Are the Servants?”2 for 
a few suggestions.)
• 
Q1.3 Why are people in small towns generally friendlier 
than people in big cities?
• 
Q1.4 The last 50 years have seen the introduction of an 
incredible wave of time-saving machinery, plus an increase 
in wealth that allows almost everyone in prosperous 
countries such as the U.S. to obtain what used to be 
considered the basic necessities of life. And yet, according 
to survey data, people report that they are pressed for time  
and money. (You may feel the same way, despite having  
much more disposable income than your grandparents 
did.) Why?

Q1.5 In a photo3 bouncing around the Internet, suppos-
edly taken of Northeast Asia at night, one can see clearly 
the massive, busy, nocturnal civilization going on in the 
Pacific coast of Japan and in South Korea. The photo also 
shows North Korea, which basically has no light at all. 
This is an indication that South Korea is a much wealthier 
country than North Korea, despite the fact that South 
Korea was dirt poor at the end of the Korean War in the 
early 1950s—poorer in fact than the North (because the 
South inherited fewer factories built under the Japanese 
colonial occupation). Since the end of the war, in the 
North, famine has occurred more than once, even as 
South Korea has built one of the most technologically 
advanced societies in the world. Given that they share a 
common language and more or less a common culture, 
what explains this difference?
Clearly these questions concern different topics, yet a single method can be 
used to try to answer all of them.4 The foundation for this method is called 
scarcity. The word is a little unfortunate, because most people take it to mean 
“the state of being rare.” A better word would be finiteness, but scarcity is the 
word that, thanks to the history of economic writing, we are stuck with.
The foundational assumption of scarcity, which defines how economists 
think about everything, has only two very large bricks: our desire to have 
more of what we want is infinite, but our means of satisfying our wants are 
finite. The first assumption, which is commonly misunderstood, simply says 
that as long as we don’t have to give up anything else, more money is bet-
ter than less. Four cars are better than three (assuming that “as long as we 
don’t have to give up anything else” means we won’t run out of driveway 
space). And more leisure time is better than less. So this assumption that 
our desire for more is infinite is very defensible. Even Mother Theresa and 
Albert Schweitzer had infinite desires—they surely believed that if one more 
poor person could be helped without cost, he5 should be.
Invoking scarcity is not synonymous with saying that people have limitless 
greed for material things. Many people derive satisfaction in life from sources 
that go far beyond such things and so might easily decide that two cars, two 
children, or two bedrooms in the house are enough. People routinely pursue

objectives that don’t revolve around material goods. They sacrifice wealth to 
care for their children; they take care of the world’s most desperate poor or 
provide financial, technical, or other kinds of literacy to people who need it; 
they get out of the rat race at an early age and retire to fish and read philosophy 
even though if they had waited ten years they would have had a lot more 
money to retire on; they major in French or classics instead of accounting or 
engineering just for the sheer joy of it.
But these are only arguments about what their wants are, not about their not 
having unlimited wants. If someone had given Mother Theresa enough money 
to take care of one more beggar on the streets of Calcutta for one year 
without strings attached, she would have taken it. If the student who majors 
in philosophy but has even a minimal interest in engineering could magically 
absorb information about the latter while he slept, without distracting him from 
his other course work, he would do so. Life is about more than money, and 
nothing in the economic way of thinking suggests otherwise. That is because 
it is defined around goals, not material things. Further, each goal is unique to the 
person who has it.
And so in economics we do in fact assume that scarcity is a problem that is 
always with us—no matter how much you have, more is better. If Bill Gates 
is walking down the street and sees a $100 bill on the sidewalk, does he 
pick it up? Surely he does, despite the billions he already possesses. All that 
is required in the economic way of thinking is that those billions plus $100 
are better than those billions without the $100. Bill Gates can find some use 
for the money that justifies the cost of his bending over to pick it up (which, 
in light of his and his wife’s extensive charitable activities, almost certainly 
does not involve him buying some material possession for himself). Limitless 
desires, properly defined, apply to everyone.
Note
■
■
  In principle, we all have limitless desires. But the ability to attain them is limited by 
finite means.
The second brick of scarcity’s foundation is that we cannot have more of 
what we want without paying some kind of cost. Every choice, in other words, 
has consequences. There are undoubtedly people who are currently not  
giving money to Mother Teresa’s organization but would be willing to do so if 
asked. How does the organization find them? And how much are they willing 
to donate, given that they have other uses for their money? Such knowledge 
does not fall freely from the sky, and the more resources the organization 
spends trying to find gain that information, the fewer it has to actually help 
the poor (or to help them right now, anyway). To major in one field is to 
forgo majoring in another. To go on vacation on the spur of the moment may

mean having less money set aside for retirement; it certainly means having 
less money available for something. To have a child (and indeed to have a 
first) means giving up time and money that could be spent on other things. 
If you want something of value, you must give up something else that you 
also value. The most common way economists speak about this phenom-
enon is so widely used that it has become an abbreviation, particularly on the 
Internet—TNSTAAFL (there’s no such thing as a free lunch).
The lack of a free lunch is true at the social level as well. To make a college edu-
cation or health care “free” is to do the impossible. There will be a cost. The only 
question is who will bear it. This insight in fact does not just apply to “standard” 
economic questions like why oil is so expensive or the unemployment rate is so 
high. In fact, it applies to almost the entire spectrum of human activities.
The combination of limitless wants and limited possibilities means that 
choices must be made. And this is what economics is about—the need to 
make decisions in an environment of scarcity. If no one can have everything 
they want, some procedures will be found to decide who gets what.
Rules and Freedom
Some years ago, the Danish town of Christiansfeld launched what must be 
reckoned an extraordinary experiment.6 In the center of town, the city fathers 
got rid of all traffic lights and warning signs and turned the central district into 
a zone where cars, bicycles, pedestrians and even buses and trucks could all 
move through without rules of any sort. The policy was called “ambiguity and 
urban legibility,” which does not sound like a promising formula to regulate 
the flow of traffic, an environment where one would suppose ambiguity—
uncertainty about who has what obligations to whom, who has to follow what 
rules—to be the enemy of safety. Everybody was thrown together in a single 
space, and it was left only to the discipline of each participant, whether in a 
car, on a bike, or on foot, to avoid colliding with others.
Remarkably, the accident rate fell dramatically, to a level of zero over three 
years.7 Even travel time fell, despite the fact that the only traffic discipline was 
self-discipline. Travelers used hand and eye signals and their own instincts to 
get through the shared space more safely and more quickly. A similar experiment 
was also successful in Bohmte, Germany,8 despite the presence of a major 
highway in that city.

How could it be that traffic interaction without rules, where the only things one 
could rely on were just one’s own self-control and the self-control of others, 
outperformed the system we have grown accustomed to, where everybody has 
rules they must follow in order to prevent dangerous choices? The reason is that 
traffic accidents are a thing that people want to avoid, even as they also want 
to get where they are going as expeditiously as possible. Allowing everyone to 
rely on his own self-interest leads to a system that functions not perfectly—the 
naïve pursuit of perfection has been known to ruin many a government policy—
but as effectively as possible. No driver gives much thought to the interests of the 
other drivers, only to his own; and yet everybody’s interest is served simply by 
relying on each individual to pursue his own.
The flow of traffic is like human society in miniature. There is a fixed amount 
of space that all travelers must share; space, in other words, is scarce. And in 
these towns there is no central coordination of who is entitled to be in what 
space when. Yet the space is quickly and efficiently allocated, despite the fact that 
nobody knows, or cares about, where everybody else is going. Could such a 
thing work in a big city, with huge volumes of traffic and people desperate to get 
somewhere quickly? But in a sense it does work there as well! In fact, on freeways 
in particular, one of the reasons the traffic flows so smoothly with remarkably 
few accidents is precisely because when we want to change lanes, we rely on the 
rational self-interest of others not to aggressively grab the space. Through this 
process of uncoordinated but nonetheless actual cooperation, traffic flows.
There are, of course, traffic laws in Los Angeles and Atlanta (although they 
are often observed mostly in the breach), but on any given road at any given 
time traffic is flowing in an undirected way yet efficient way, where people get 
where they are going as effectively as possible by relying on the willingness 
of other drivers to look after their own self-interest. So too it is with the 
broader society: there are only so many workers, so much land, so much oil, 
so many hours in the day, so much money saved up, yet some way has to be 
found to decide how, precisely, each of these scarce things should be used. 
And through a coordination process that we will investigate more thoroughly, 
those resources end up being used for some purposes and not others through 
the peaceful cooperation that we will call the market.
I do not know whether the traffic engineers of northwestern Europe have 
read it, but in the year 1776 (a momentous year for other reasons, too) a 
Scotsman named Adam Smith wrote a book that argued in particular that 
often the same principle that motivated the design of the open traffic spaces 
in these towns should also underlie the way we decide how resources get 
used—the way we decide who gets what.
The book was called An Inquiry into the Nature and Causes of the Wealth of 
Nations. It was written at a time when economics was beginning to mature as 
a distinct area of intellectual inquiry. He was actually known then as a “politi-
cal economist,” because much controversy, then as now, was attached to the

relation between things the government did and people’s material quality of life. 
It is a remarkable book that touches on a wide variety of subjects, but what is 
of interest here is two contentions about human nature and human society:
In civilized society he [man] stands at all times in need of the cooperation 
and assistance of great multitudes, while his whole life is scarce sufficient 
to gain the friendship of a few persons. In almost every other race 
of animals each individual, when it is grown up to maturity, is entirely 
independent, and in its natural state has occasion for the assistance of 
no other living creature. But man has almost constant occasion for the 
help of his brethren, and it is in vain for him to expect it from their 
benevolence only. He will be more likely to prevail if he can interest their 
self-love in his favour, and show them that it is for their own advantage 
to do for him what he requires of them. Whoever offers to another a 
bargain of any kind, proposes to do this. Give me that which I want, and 
you shall have this which you want, is the meaning of every such offer; 
and it is in this manner that we obtain from one another the far greater 
part of those good offices which we stand in need of. It is not from the 
benevolence of the butcher, the brewer, or the baker, that we expect 
our dinner, but from their regard to their own interest. We address 
ourselves, not to their humanity but to their self-love, and never talk to 
them of our own necessities but of their advantages.9
The language of course is somewhat archaic, but the passage essentially means 
that we get that which we desire by relying on the pursuit by others of their 
own self-interest and not of ours, with the result nonetheless that we all 
simultaneously do better. Why does the guy we hire to fix our leaky pipe or 
the merchant we patronize to sell us lettuce generally try to do right by us? 
Because his business depends on it. At this level the idea is blindingly obvious, 
but people often ignore or even deny that people generally seek to follow 
their self-interest, and sometimes go so far as to assert that a society built on 
“selfishness” simply cannot succeed.
In contrast, the economist assumes that human behavior and human society 
are best understood by assuming that people always pursue their self-interest 
as they see it. In the words of the economist Steven Landsburg, evoking the 
legendary Jewish philosopher Hillel’s clever remark: “Most of economics can be 
summarized in four words: ‘People respond to incentives.’ The rest is commen-
tary.”10 In other words, people do things when the benefits exceed the costs, and don't 
do them when the costs exceed the benefits. So already we began to get some insight

into the questions raised at the beginning of the chapter, although I’m not ready 
to answer them just yet. In each case, the economist would say that the changes 
have occurred because the incentives have changed—in other words, because 
the costs and benefits of various actions have changed. If people are becoming 
heavier, for example, the benefits to doing things that make one heavier must 
have risen and/or the cost of being heavier must have declined for the average 
person. To think economically, always think in terms of benefits and costs.

  To think as an economist would, always think in terms of benefits and costs.
Remarkably, it is usually true that allowing everyone to pursue his own self-
interest leads to a sort of coordination whereby we are as well-off as we 
can be.11 Of course, nothing in a market system is literally coordinated if that 
word means someone giving explicit commands that others must obey. But 
coordination nonetheless happens; goods and services are produced and  
distributed to people, and those people in turn are able to support themselves. 
This happens because the process of market exchange—people going to work, 
buying and selling on mutually agreeable terms (or refusing to buy and sell on 
other terms)—knits us all together and gives us a reason to work together for 
mutual benefit. People may think they are working for themselves, but in a sense 
they are actually working for everyone else. Adam Smith’s butcher’s main social 
function is to provide meat for his customers, and by giving him a reason to 
do so (a reason that involves rewards and not punishment) everyone is more 
likely to have good meat at a good price. In other words, when we let people 
do what is best for them alone, society as a whole benefits because everybody 
is given an incentive to work together, given that we can’t have everything that 
we want. Much of this book is devoted to exploring why that happens.
The Wealth of Nations is a long, complicated, historically important book. There 
is far more in it than the excerpts above, and there are some things in it that 
indicate suspicion of self-interest. For example, elsewhere in the book Smith 
argues very strongly that relying only on individual pursuit of self-interest can 
be a mistake, as in the case of businesses that try to fix prices. He also argues 
that government is essential to provide “certain public works and certain 
11The argument being made here—that letting everybody pursue his self-interest is also 
in the best interest of the entire society—is sometimes called the invisible hand, which 
is supposed to lead everybody do the right thing for society in the course of doing 
what is right for them individually. Adam Smith created the phrase in The Wealth of 
Nations, although as noted earlier the book is more nuanced on the broader question 
of the proper scope of government, and of trade, in promoting the broader social good. 
However, given the prevailing environment of late-1700s Britain, which was rife with 
special government privileges for big business and extensive restrictions on foreign trade, 
all imposed in the belief that the government could control resource use for this broader 
good, this was a radical statement.

public institutions, which it can never be the interest of any individual or small 
number of individuals to erect and maintain.” However, the book introduced 
the world to the idea of organizing society the way Bohmte organizes traffic: 
allow people to interact freely, and you be will more likely to like the results. 
This process is often called “spontaneous order” or “spontaneous adjustment,” 
because we rely on individuals to change their economic behavior in response 
to changed circumstances, in contrast to trying to impose order from above.
This idea—that the best rules are often no rules—is sometimes difficult to accept. 
We see a world in which many problems appear to be unsolved and feel that if we 
could organize resources in some other way, there would be less poverty, things 
that seem unfair wouldn’t happen, etc. But the basic argument made here is that 
in fact these things are the result of scarcity. “Solving” them through nonmarket 
means in the face of scarcity often creates other problems that are worse. Relying 
on chaos and the free interplay of individuals generally does a better job of 
solving such problems, with some limited exceptions outlined in Chapter 10.
Rules amid the Chaos
And yet I pulled a fast one in describing the rules of Bohmte and Christiansfeld 
as “no rules.” If you and I were driving our cars in the central space, and I 
suddenly decided to ram yours, I would be charged with violation of a rule. 
So too would I be if I decided to drive through the town square carefully, but 
in your car instead of mine. The fact that we are allowed to interact freely 
doesn’t give me the right to take what is yours, or to damage what is yours. 
And so we are introduced to the idea of property rights. The law vests us with 
rights to what is ours, which means that there are indeed rules that define 
what is mine and what is yours. My car is mine, and you can’t drive or damage 
it without my permission. Burglary and pickpocketing are crimes, as is violence 
outside of self-defense. But we only call these things “rules” because someone 
is empowered to force the person who breaks them to pay consequences.
In most modern societies that “someone” is the government, and Adam 
Smith’s vision—a pursuit of self-interest generally serving the common good—
assumes a government that can enforce people’s rights to property, including 
the right to sell their property to someone else on whatever terms the two 
parties can agree to. Because societies have discovered historically that such 
a system works reasonably well, a group of individuals called “the government”   
generally possesses the power to enforce laws against theft and violence, and 
often against many other things as well. We could not harness the self-interest 
of the “brewer, butcher, or the baker” for the greater good of society unless 
the brewer, butcher, and baker could do business securely, confident they can 
keep much of the money they make and that their property is safe from 
vandalism or seizure not just by thieves on the street but by petty government 
officials too. And so it falls to government to, at a minimum, enforce property

rights and make prosperity achievable through the pursuit of self-interest, 
while at the same time not becoming a source of problems itself.
It is also worth thinking why Bohmte and Christiansfeld have roads to begin 
with. They are old cities, and their history is not one likely to be repeated 
in a modern country. (Christiansfeld was apparently founded thanks to a 
gift from the King of Denmark, who exempted its citizens from trade taxes 
and paid for the town’s founding.) In modern societies, many public services, 
including roads, are generally paid for not through voluntary trade but by the 
government assessing taxes (and punishing people who don’t pay them!) to 
pay directly for their construction. Roads are built not by asking people for 
contributions the way an apricot farmer would ask people if they want to buy 
his fruit, but by telling people they have to contribute in the form of taxes and 
fining or imprisoning them if they don’t pay.
Roads are socially valuable without question (although they are socially costly 
too), but government is a tricky thing. Even when democratically selected, it 
depends on the imposition or threatened imposition of force to get what  
it wants. If the government needs your property to build a school or military 
base, the penalties for failing to hand it over are likely to be severe. If the govern-
ment wants to spend some money on something or other, those who don’t pay 
are punished. If the government tells businesses that they may not hire workers 
for less than $7.50 an hour, any business that does so faces legal sanction, and it 
doesn’t matter that it can find workers happy to work at that wage.
Government force is a tool that must be used with care. Human history is 
replete with instances in which the application of force on a large scale by govern-
ments has resulted in untold human misery. In the 20th century, much of this 
horrendous violence was done explicitly to achieve better social outcomes—
for example, societies where workers and not “capitalists” ran factories, where 
poverty was abolished, etc. In addition, particularly in modern democratic soci-
eties, there is a tendency to mistake what is good for me with what is good for 
everyone, and to ignore the consequences for the goals, dreams, and ambitions 
of other people of using the government instead of the market to get what we 
want. For these reasons, this application of force—the overriding of the rela-
tions humans have organized on their own by the imposition of laws and pun-
ishments for not complying with the relations dictated by the government—is 
something that should be done with care, as Chapter 5 discusses in detail.

  Government “force” must be used with care—the totalitarian states of the 20th century are 
testament to the damage excessive force can do to society.
To summarize, economics is based on the idea that we have unlimited wants 
but limited means to satisfy them. This requires that we make choices. There 
are many ways to make those choices. One way is to send people out into

the market and trade on the basis of their self-interest. We assume that those 
people will do that which is best for them, and if the incentives they face 
change, their behavior will change too. Another way is to regiment society—
to have a king, the Party, elected representatives, or bureaucrats make the 
decisions about whether and if so how to build factories, how to regulate the 
terms of exchange and the prices that people may charge for things, or how 
to take resources and the opportunities they create from some people and 
give them to others (the poor, companies that produce “green technology,” 
the elderly, people who have given campaign donations to the politicians 
currently in office, and so on).
Throughout this book, I compare these two ways of deciding how to solve the 
fundamental problem of scarcity.
Answers to In-Text Questions
1.1.	 Why have people in the United States gotten so much heavier 
over the years? Economics focuses a lot on prices and pref-
erences. Here the most sensible answer seems to involve 
prices—it seems unlikely that people subject to millions 
of years of evolution have suddenly in the last few decades 
developed a taste, so to speak, for eating large amounts 
of food generally or fattening foods in particular. Since 
changes in weight are a function of changes in calories 
in minus calories out, I would look for an answer that is 
based on the idea that the price of expending calories 
has gone up (for example, because people have chosen to 
live so far from work that they choose to use motorized 
transportation to get there, even as the cost of being away 
from work to go to the gym has also gone up), and the 
price of consuming it has gone down. That’s because the 
money price of food as a share of total income earned has 
gone continuously down, because Styrofoam boxes make 
it easy to take home incredible amounts of restaurant left-
overs, because food-storage technology including refrig-
erators and boxes that can hold Twinkies for long periods 
of time without the contents spoiling also leaves large 
amounts of food easily available at easy reach in the home, 
etc. Improved medical care—pills and surgery—have also 
made being overweight less costly, although some of these 
advances were probably themselves driven by the rising 
rates of obesity. Economic growth and the greater afford-
ability of food that it generates it are phenomena seen not 
just in the United States but worldwide.

1.2.	 Why have personal servants largely disappeared from our 
society? As we will see in the next chapter, if one chooses 
to be a personal servant, as with any job, one must give 
up some other activity that is also valuable, including but 
not limited to other kinds of work. Salaries have risen 
immensely over the years, meaning that what people have 
to give up to be a personal servant has also risen in value. 
There was an ample supply of people with few alterna-
tives in the days of the large manor, and so the number 
of people who were eager to get that work, which might 
make the difference between being able to support 
yourself or not, was correspondingly large. Not so any-
more. The increasing difficulty of persuading people to be 
servants because they have more options than they used 
to is what has made the number of servants fewer.
1.3.	 Why are people in small towns generally friendlier than people 
in big cities? I would say that the cost of getting to know 
about people is lower in a small town because you run 
into them more frequently, it’s more likely that you have 
common friends, and for other reasons. When we don’t 
know someone, we may for safety reasons have to assume 
the worst about whether or not they are honest and safe 
to be around. In the big city, we’re surrounded by people 
we don’t know anything about. In the small town, we’re 
surrounded by people we have had plenty of opportunity 
to get to know, by running into them repeatedly (which 
makes us more willing to engage them) or by introduc-
tion or reputation. It is easier to be friendly to people you 
know a lot about, provided that what you know is good.
1.4.	 Why, despite the increase in wealth and time-saving machinery, 
do people often feel short of time and money? Time-saving 
machinery has obviously released a great deal of time 
from uses that used to claim it, but it has also opened up 
many other possibilities for using time. What one gives up 
by sitting around doing very little has grown spectacularly 
(new entertainment options, new travel possibilities, etc.), 
and so the attractiveness of sitting around doing nothing  
relative to the alternatives has declined. “Free” time is 
not really free. People who used to spend tremendous 
amounts of time doing household chores or farming the 
fields don’t have to do that anymore. Instead they take 
yoga classes or do market work to earn money that 
enables them to buy new things. So all the hours in the 
day still get consumed, along with other things made 
possible by having more money.

1.5.	 Why has South Korea flourished compared to North Korea? 
The ability to use scarce resources more effectively in the 
South, because the government enacts policies that encour-
age resources to be used effectively, makes South Korea 
wealthier. The North, in contrast, as an economic dicta-
torship, has policies that almost guarantee that resources 
will be used ineffectively. The difference in the two sets of 
policies is a big part of what this book is about.

who run a government lie in having ambiguous laws? 
(As always in economics, this is about someone’s self-
interest.)
1.2.	 This Café Hayek14 article points out how unions are 
paying low wages and benefits to people whom they 
hire to picket for them, while punishing them for exces-
sive breaks. What self-interest is the union able to pursue 
more effectively by hiring cheaper workers and demand-
ing that they work harder? (The answer is not simply 
“lower costs.” It is what they are able to do more of by 
lowering the costs of picketing.) What self-interest are 
the companies a union negotiates with able to pursue 
by successfully turning away union demands? Is there a 
moral difference between the two situations?

Why Red-Eye Flights Are Always Full Now  
and Other Puzzles Explained
Asked what something costs, your reply will almost surely be in the form 
of a number, expressed in dollars if you are an American. But why is the number 
what it is? Why does a sandwich cost $3.50, a gallon of gas $4.00, some 
books $20, others $40, a new car $20,000? Probably you have some sense 
of the answer, which involves the costs for the things needed to make these 
items. Sandwiches need meat and bread, and books need paper and ink. Cars 
need rubber, several kinds of metals, upholstering, and all manner of other 
resources. All of these things cost money, as does the time of workers hired.

Opportunity Cost
But that just kicks the can down the road a bit. Why do these things cost 
what they cost? In fact, the way economists think about cost does not directly 
lead to a number, although a number may sometimes be used to represent it. 
But the number per se is uninformative. Say you learn that a company in the 
country of Fredonia plans to export its new smartphone to the U.S., and right 
now the company is selling it in Fredonia for twelve doubloons (the currency 
in Fredonia). All that tells you nothing. But translating that price to dollars is 
informative not because they’re dollars, but because expressing it in dollars 
tells you what sacrifice you have to bear to buy one when they are sold here, 
compared perhaps to the sacrifice required to obtain an existing smartphone. 
Cost is therefore not an absolute. Rather, it only makes sense in the context 
of comparisons to something else. The numbers we sometimes attach to costs 
are merely reflections of this. Knowing something costs $1,000 is meaningless 
until you know what else $1,000 will buy. Everything in economics is about 
relative analysis—that is, comparisons. The classic example is a comparison of 
benefits and costs when thinking about an action.
It must also be noted that things do not really have costs. Rather, actions have 
costs. College students naturally wonder why the cost of college is so high, 
and I will return to that shortly. But in the meantime, we must differentiate 
between the cost of acquiring a college education and the cost of providing one, 
which are two different things. In each action mentioned here, I will talk about 
its cost as its opportunity cost, which means the value of what must be given up 
to take the action.
Sometimes a choice is easy to analyze. A student sleeps in and skips his 
economics class when he expects that the opportunity cost of doing so—the 
value of what he expects to learn in the class—will be low enough to justify 
staying home. Note that tricky word value. There is clearly a cost to sleeping 
in and missing a day’s worth of material. Is that a monetary cost? Can one 
attach a dollar value to it? In principle yes, but practically no. The value of the 
material to some other classmate who really enjoys economics, or who needs 
to get a very high grade in the class for some reason, may well be higher than 
it is to some other student for whom these conditions are not true. So value, 
and therefore the opportunity cost of an action, is context-dependent. Value 
depends not just on the action, but on the person thinking about taking it, and 
in particular on the value he attaches to the alternative he is contemplating 
giving up in order to take that action.
Note also that we need consider only one alternative. Say our student has  
multiple choices if he doesn’t go to class: sleeping in, watching television, or 
cleaning up the dishes left over from the night before. If sleeping in is what he 
will in fact choose if he doesn’t go to class, the other choices are irrelevant. Only 
the value to him of sleeping in is the true opportunity cost of going to class.

Reasonably Simple Economics
17
So what then is the opportunity cost of the action of acquiring a college 
education? (I mean acquiring a full degree, not one day’s worth of material 
in one class.) If we think of cost only as a number, we think of the money 
spent on tuition and books and stop. But money is just a number, an index.  
It doesn’t really tell us what was sacrificed. Money (at least American money) 
is just green pieces of paper in one sense (more about this in Chapter 11) and 
only acquires value insofar as it can be exchanged for other things. If tuition is 
$3,000 a quarter, we need to think (perhaps, in light of actual college tuition,1 
after counting our blessings) about what that money would have been spent 
on—putting money aside for a house, maybe, which reduces the time and 
money one has to spend to live in an apartment, or buying a car that would 
otherwise be unaffordable.
But even this omits what is perhaps the most substantial cost of college. 
Everyone who is not a slave, a child, or incarcerated has command over one 
key resource: his time. What is the opportunity cost of being in college for 
four years? The value of whatever that time would have otherwise been used 
for. For almost every student, this would have been time in the labor force. 
According to U.S. government data, which are not available for those under 25,  
the median annual earnings of someone with only a high school degree were 
about $28,000 in 2008. So that is what on average must be given up every year 
one attends college.2
What about the cost of providing college? This is obviously a different action, 
taken by different people. If the school is a typical private university, it is run 
as a kind of nonprofit corporation. The people who run it hire a certain 
number of faculty. Faculty are not enough to make the university run by itself; 
it also requires staff to run the offices and supervise and operate units of the 
university (secretaries, deans, custodians, a president, vice presidents, librar-
ians). Each of these people has an opportunity cost of time, and it is in fact 
society that bears the cost of their working at the university. Why? Because 
these people are not doing what they otherwise would be doing, because the 
university is paying them a salary that persuades them to work there. What 
society gives up when people work at a university instead of doing something 
else is obviously a hard and often impossible thing to nail down because it 
is context-dependent for each individual, but the fact that these costs exist 
is often critical when we judge whether or not it is worthwhile to rely on 
markets to make these decisions. The costs of any activity ought to be taken 
account of when deciding whether it should be taken, and so the degree to 
which markets take account of these costs is a central issue.

2Technically, it is the value of what the dollars would have been used for, although it is 
often convenient to summarize this way as long as we remember what the dollars really 
stand for.

Chapter 2 | Supply and Demand, Considered Separately
18
Most universities also possess land. The land is already paid for, so should 
it be considered costless? It should not. The people who run the university 
are choosing not to close it down and sell that land off to some other party 
who would do something else with it—build houses, tear everything down 
except the football stadium and use that to attract an NFL team, turn it into 
a wildlife preserve, whatever. Whichever party would be willing to pay the 
most for the land (and that depends on how much value that party attaches 
to the alternate use) doesn’t get that chance, and so for society that has to be 
counted as part of the opportunity cost of operating a university there.
In fact, all the resources that the university uses in its operation must be 
counted—the computers provided to students, the exercise equipment in 
the fitness center, all the way down to the paperclips used in every office. All 
of these things are used by the university instead of being used by others in 
society, and so have to be counted as part of the cost of providing the services 
of that university. So the cost of running a university is actually borne by the 
rest of us, who are deprived of other things because the university, by trad-
ing in the marketplace, has acquired control over a set of resources that are 
then not used to produce other things. This point is fundamental: the cost of 
producing is a cost to society (technically to specific but unknown people in 
society) which is deprived of other things of value when this thing of value—a 
university education—is produced.
Question 2.1
■
■
  Why do universities these days often spend so much money on facilities like 
apartments—which more and more are replacing old-fashioned dormitories—and state-of-the-art 
exercise facilities?
And so it is with any activity, in particular commercial activities. (I’m using 
commercial here to mean something that is provided in exchange for money, 
even if the university itself is nonprofit, and not simply for-profit activity.) Any 
activity requires claiming resources that have opportunity costs because they are 
scarce. As a result, we will eventually want to know whether the benefits from 
the activity justify those costs. And we have to think beyond the opportunity 
cost as simply, for example, “workers.” We must think instead in terms of 
what those workers would otherwise be doing. We also want to avoid think-
ing about cost as a number, except as a measure of the actual cost, which is a 
thing or things given up.

Sunk vs. Marginal Costs
My example about the opportunity cost of going to college is a little 
incomplete, because many students work while they are in college, which 
changes the calculations. Note first that the work students do is likely to 
be work that is quite different from what they would be doing had they not 
decided to go to college. If a student graduates high school and decide not to 
enroll in college, the chances are excellent that he will search for work that 
has some kind of long-term payoff, that serves as the foundation for a career. 
The work that students do in college, in contrast, is often part-time. It provides 
little in the way of long-term training that will raise future earnings (there are 
exceptions, of course), although done well it does signal to future employers 
that the student has a record of working responsibly. So the student would 
have to subtract his part-time earnings from what he would earn if he went 
straight into the labor force, including the value of the training he is getting 
in his full-time career-based job. But even if we assumed that the value of this 
training were zero, and that the income from the part-time work is 20 hours 
a week times $15 an hour times 50 weeks a year (and each student has to 
decide if this is a realistic estimate or not), that comes to $15,000 a year, 
meaning that the marginal opportunity cost for a student with that amount of 
part-time working of going to college must include $28,000 (the amount not 
earned by not working full-time but with only a high-school degree) minus 
$15,000 (the amount earned working part-time). That equals $13,000, which 
is nonetheless more than the explicit money spent on tuition.

Chapter 2 | Supply and Demand, Considered Separately
20
But I smuggled a word in there: marginal. What does that mean? In economics, 
marginal generally has the meaning of “extra” or “additional.” It is true that by 
going to college you are forgoing, using these numbers, $28,000 in annual sal-
ary, but you will still earn $15,000 of that in your part-time work. So the net 
forgone3 income is the marginal cost, which is only $13,000.
The decision to work has other marginal costs too—costs that still lie in front 
of you. If you decide to work in the third year of college, it may be that this will 
extend your time until graduation by a year. Is it worth it? Well, you’ll incur 
(by our earlier numbers) 3 quarters × $3,000/quarter = $9,000 in marginal 
tuition expense (assuming you pay the same regardless of how many classes 
you take), but you’ll offset that with $15,000 in income. But wait! By deferring 
graduation, you also defer a chance to earn a college graduate’s first-year salary, 
which according to the government for those aged 25–29 is $42,000. That 
number minus $15,000 equals $27,000, which is the marginal salary forgone. 
So really, the monetary value of the full opportunity cost is $9,000 (dollars 
spent on tuition) + $27,000 (dollars not earned because you’re not working 
full-time with a college degree) = $36,000. Thus, extending the time until you 
graduate is, at least by these numbers, quite costly.
To take a different problem, suppose instead that you decide after your sopho-
more year to change majors from computer science to petroleum engineering, 
because you find that the starting salary of a computer programmer right now 
is $40,000 instead of the $70,000 you expected, whereas the starting salary of 
a petroleum engineer is $60,000 instead of the $45,000 you expected. (I just 
made the numbers up.) But it will take you an extra year to graduate. What 
should count as cost? This time assume, to make it easy, that the student’s par-
ents have chosen to pay his college costs. Time out of the labor force would 
count, as before, but how much time? If you don’t change majors and wait two 
years to graduate, you give up the high-school salary of $28,000 for each of 
the two years still to go, but you were doing that anyway. Let’s further assume 
that while in college you don’t work part-time. So that’s not marginal, given the 
decision you are considering (graduating in two years or three). You do have 
to give up what you expect to be $40,000 (the actual number may turn out, 
because of market changes, to be higher or lower) in computer-science salary 
in your fifth year, plus $9,000 in tuition. In exchange, you will earn $70,000 in 
the first year and more (presumably) every year after. So, assuming you have no 
intrinsic enjoyment for either job (that is, you are just considering money),4 the 
benefits will, at least in expectation, exceed the costs.
3 Note that that word forgone shows up a lot in discussion of opportunity cost, because you 
have to forgo some action to take some other action.
4 Which, frankly, is often a mistake, because you will be spending so much time at work that 
enjoyment of it is also an important consideration.

  The only costs that matter are the costs you can still control—that is, marginal costs.
Here is another problem to think about. Think about an airline decid-
ing whether to discontinue a flight. A writer on a blog in 2007 wrote the 
following:
Time was, red-eye flights were half empty, or more. You could often 
spread out on two or even three adjacent seats, and it really was like 
a little in-flight hotel room. But that time has passed, and red-eyes,  
as most of the fights, are now full or close to full.5
This raises a couple of questions. First, why would an airline ever choose to 
send a plane out half empty? Planes are expensive, after all. But most of the 
costs related to paying for the plane, even if the airline had borrowed to buy 
them, are not marginal but sunk. Sunk costs are costs that involve no opportunity 
for choice because they are in the past. So the airline wants to know whether 
running that flight will incur more in extra (marginal) costs than it will yield 
marginal benefits. And to be sure there are marginal costs—the crew has to 
be paid instead of staying at home, extra food and drinks have to be ordered, 
there is extra wear and tear on the airplane, and there is fuel used instead of 
paying to store the plane overnight at the airport. As long as there are enough 
passengers to pay off these marginal costs, including the cost of storing the 
plane overnight, the plane should fly.
But that raises the second question: what happened? Why, in other words, 
are red-eyes full now when they were not before? One marginal cost, fuel, is 
significantly more expensive than it used to be. The airline presumably wants 
to run fewer flights to save on fuel-buying costs, and some of those red-eye 
flights no longer make the cut. The ones that remain are therefore fuller. So 
again, the economically relevant comparison is to compare costs you still have 
control over with benefits you still have control over. In other words, you 
want to compare marginal costs and marginal benefits. So, modify the rule 
in Chapter 1—that actions should be taken when benefits exceed costs—
accordingly; it is really marginal benefits and costs that matter.
So in sum: costs relate to actions, not goods (although buying a good is an 
action). They are the value to the person taking the action of what he is giving 
up to take it, and the costs that matter are marginal.

Costs and Supply
You are probably familiar with the term supply and demand and may even 
have some knowledge of it. If giant new oil fields are discovered, we expect 
gasoline prices to decline. If we suddenly have large amounts of immigration, 
we expect the locals who compete with those workers to see their wages 
decline. (This is why natives competing against immigrants in the labor market 
are the most likely to oppose such immigration) If war disrupts oil production, 
we expect oil to be harder to come by and its price to go up.
But what is “supply” of, for instance, gasoline? The first thing to recognize is 
that it is not the amount or quantity supplied at any given moment in time. 
That is merely something called quantity supplied. Instead, supply is a functional 
relation between a hypothetical price obtained and the amount producers of 
something are willing to offer, based on whatever conditions prevail, other 
than price, that affect the capacity to produce gasoline. For example, for a 
given number of oil wells, a given technology for getting oil out of the ground, 
and a given set of alternative demands on the resources needed to extract 
oil, refine it into gasoline, and bring that gasoline to market, we can imagine 
a relation between the price society might offer companies that produce oil 
and the amount the companies are willing to produce. One can imagine taking a 
survey of one oil producer (if it is that company’s personal supply curve, which 
is perfectly reasonable to analyze) or all possible producers (since their so-
called market supply curve can just as reasonably be investigated) and asking, 
“At $90.00 a barrel, how many barrels will you supply? What about at $90.01? 
At $90.02?” and so on down the line. If we do that, we have a relation that tells 
us at any price how much oil will be available for consumers to buy.
Well, what will that relation be like? To think about that, we need to think a 
little bit about the action of supplying. To recapitulate, producers need to stake 
claims to resources to supply things of value, because it takes resources—
natural resources, worker time, certain kinds of talents, land, paper clips in the 
various offices of the oil company, and so on—to make a good that consumers 
will buy. If we are thinking about the production of gasoline, we need, among 
many other things, the natural resource oil. If we left it to oil producers to 
decide where to produce it, to make as much money as possible naturally 
they would go first to places where it could be extracted very cheaply, as 
they would first try to get all the resources they wanted from the lowest-cost 
source. So, if they only got a relatively low price for each unit of the good or 
service they were selling, producers could still find resources at low enough 
cost to produce some. But as they are asked to produce more and more, 
they need to get control of resources with higher and higher opportunity 
costs, which means the price they need to get to make it worthwhile to buy 
the rights to those resources gets higher and higher. The initial oil to make 
gasoline (or plastics, or heating oil) can be had very cheaply in some place like 
Saudi Arabia where huge amounts of it can be drilled for at very low cost. 

Reasonably Simple Economics
23
Likewise, if we want to grow grain, one of the resources we need is land, and 
plenty of high-quality land can be had at low costs in thinly populated parts of 
the Great Plains.
But if we wanted companies that produce gasoline to bring more of it to 
market, the easy oil would be used up quickly, and we would have to start 
looking in places like thousands of feet under the sea, or in seams in beds of 
shale under the ground, where extraction itself requires more costly resources. 
Greater oil production would also require more workers, more machinery, 
etc., and these resources also get costlier as they get scarcer. So the price the 
companies need to cover costs per unit of oil produced will continue to get 
higher. So too with corn. One supposes that the land under Denver (which 
actually sits not in the Rocky Mountains but at the edge of the Great Plains) 
or Kansas City or suburban Chicago would also be suitable for grain production 
in a strict horticultural sense, as would the land near where those cities end. 
But the land in the center of the big cities has a very high opportunity cost, 
because a lot of activity that people find valuable is already going on in the city 
itself, and would have to be abandoned if crops were grown there. That would 
be the last land used, one supposes, in the supplying of American-grown corn, 
and the price required to persuade owners of buildings in Denver and Chicago 
to tear them down and start growing corn would be very high.
We now have reasoned out the relation between the amount produced and 
the price producers would need to get to supply that amount—they are 
positively related. Another way of saying this is that there is a supply curve, 
and it is positively sloped (see Figure 2-1).

Figure 2-1. The supply curve
Note that this could be the supply curve for anything: lollipops, gasoline from 
the station at the corner of 5th and Main, the global supply of iPads, the supply 
of people teaching at universities, the supply of strawberries from California’s 
Central Valley, whatever. All of them are subject to this basic implication of 

Chapter 2 | Supply and Demand, Considered Separately
24
scarcity on the one hand and pursuit of self-interest (profit, in this case) by 
producers on the other: because producers will naturally first seek resources at 
the lowest cost, producing more requires that they be paid more for their output in 
compensation for having to use progressively higher-cost resources.
Demand
A supply curve to this point is only a theoretical exercise, the hypothetical 
consequences of resources becoming progressively scarcer. To find out how 
markets actually make decisions, we need to match supply with demand. To 
think about demand, we ask how the number of times an individual worker 
will eat out as the price of doing so changes, or how many napkins Americans will 
collectively buy as the price changes. Assuming that people are acting in their 
rational self-interest, then as we ask them to make greater sacrifices to take the 
same action (in particular, to consume the same good), they should be less willing 
to do so, so that the quantity demanded should fall. Thus, the relation between 
price and quantity in a hypothetical survey of consumers is the opposite of that 
in our survey of producers, which we can summarize in the law of demand: as the 
price consumers face goes up (down), the quantity they are willing to purchase goes 
down (up). The demand curve, in other words, is negatively sloped.
Law is of course a pretty strong word. It implies this relationship is always 
negative. Is that true? The most commonly raised objection is that of luxury 
or brand-name goods. A pair of warm-up pants with the name Adidas or Nike 
on it might sell for considerably more than an otherwise identical pair with 
no recognizable brand name. When getting off the exit ramp after a day of 
driving, one may be willing to pay more for a brand-name hotel room than for 
another room at Joe’s Inn, which may or may not be of identical quality. But in 
the first example, one is arguably not simply buying a pair of pants or shoes 
as much as buying the brand name itself, which lends a certain prestige to the 
wearer. You are obtaining, in addition to the actual value the pair of pants will 
render by covering your legs, the value to you of other people seeing you 
wearing it, the latter service being something the no-brand pair does not offer. 
In the second case, by adding the phrase “may or may not be,” I have glossed 
over a cost that is often very important: the cost of search. When you check 
into a Holiday Inn or Hilton, you know pretty much what you will get, because 
the companies that own those names have spent years investing resources 
in standardizing the product they offer and in making the public aware of the 
exact nature of that product. When you check into a non-brand-name hotel, 
you are flying blind. You save money, but you don’t necessarily know the quality 
of what you’re getting. (You could of course have looked up the hotel’s ratings 
online, but ignore this possibility.) To find out, you would actually have to go 
investigate a room, which requires you to spend time, which is also a cost. 
All things considered, the brand-name hotel saves you on these costs, and 

Reasonably Simple Economics
25
that is reflected in its higher money price.6 We are confident that this idea of 
incentives affecting behavior is quite robust: when you raise the price of an 
action, people will take it less, and lowering the price of an action increases 
the amount of it we would expect to see. When Professor Landsburg says, 
“People respond to incentives,” this is a big part of what he means. It is con-
ceptually simple, but the trick often lies in remembering always to apply it.
Note finally that willingness to pay, which determines demand and is deter-
mined by the available substitutes, is context-dependent. Week-old French 
bread is more valuable to someone who hasn’t eaten in a week (or someone 
who has a hankering for bread salad) than to others. Some people value 
wearing nice clothes, some value the comfort of shorts and a T-shirt. And 
when we speak of market demand, we are speaking of the aggregation of all 
these individuals in all their particular circumstances.
Tip

  Remember that demand and supply are functions, that is, relations between quantity and 
price. If we speak of shifts in supply or demand, we are speaking of shifts in that entire relation; if we 
speak of the amount of a good or service hypothetically supplied or demanded at a particular price, 
that is known as quantity supplied or demanded (depending on which relation we are talking about).
Elasticity of Demand
Another aspect of demand of interest is how sensitive the quantity demanded 
is to changes in price. Consider the two demand curves shown in Figure 2-2.

At any given price, the curve in (a) is considerably steeper than the curve in 
(b). This means that quantity is considerably more sensitive to price in figure 
(b) than in figure (a). In economic language, we say that demand in figure (b) is 
more elastic than demand in figure (a). The definition of elasticity of demand is the 
sensitivity of quantity demanded to changes in price.7 When demand is very elastic, 
a small increase (decrease) in price by sellers will lead to consumers buying far 
less (more) of the product, and when demand is very inelastic a big increase 
(decrease) in price leads to a small decrease (increase) and in the amount con-
sumers buy. The same logic holds for big and small decreases in price by sellers.
What determines whether demand is elastic or inelastic? Think about some 
actual examples. If the price of gasoline went up significantly, do you think 
quantity demanded would fall by a little or by a lot? As always, the question is 
context-dependent. Some individuals are more dependent on their cars than 
others. And we might not even be talking about individual demand, we might be 
talking about demand in a particular jurisdiction, or even demand for gasoline 
across the planet. Once we have defined what market we are talking about, 
we have to think about what alternatives consumers have to not consuming 
this product. For someone who lives 50 miles from work in an area with poor 
mass transit, there are substitutes available for getting to work—he could buy 
a more fuel-efficient car, he could move closer to work, he could search for 
people to carpool with so as to share expenses, he could even ride a bicycle. 
But these are relatively poor substitutes, especially the latter. (Actually, consis-
tent with the idea of opportunity cost as the single best alternative given up, we 
really need only consider the next best alternative.) If he is on the misanthropic 
side, carpooling will be a lousy option like all the others, and so we would 
predict that while he will be a little more careful about the trips he makes, the 
quantity of gasoline he buys will not drop much in response to the higher price, 
which means his demand for gasoline is relatively inelastic.

  Do you think your personal demand for purchasing gasoline is very elastic or 
very inelastic?

, which just means 
the absolute value of the percentage change in quantity divided by the percentage change 
in price. If this number is greater than 1, we say that demand is elastic, that is, quantity 
demanded is relatively sensitive to changes in price; if it is less than 1, we say that demand 
is inelastic, that is, quantity demanded is relatively insensitive to changes in price. If by 
some strange coincidence elasticity of demand were exactly equal to 1, demand would 
be unit-elastic.

Question 2.4
■
■
  Is the demand for purchasing gasoline by an individual driver likely to be more 
elastic in the short run, say over the span of a few weeks, or in the long run, after the driver has had 
time to make major lifestyle changes if he needs to?
On the other hand, think about the demand for gasoline at a particular gasoline 
station that is one of four at some freeway exit off the interstate. If everybody 
else is charging $3.50 a gallon, and one bold station owner decides out of the 
blue to raise his price to $3.60, what should happen to the amount of gasoline 
he sells? Gasoline is pretty much gasoline, chemically identical from one seller 
to the next (marketing hype to the contrary), and so one brand of gasoline 
is an excellent substitute for any other. The only extra cost incurred from 
changing from one station to another one is that one turns right instead of 
left, or drives a little farther down the street, and these are practically no costs 
at all. We would thus predict that elasticity of demand at a particular station is 
quite elastic. In other words, if that station adjusts its price holding the behavior 
of all its competitors constant, quantity demanded should fall by a lot.
This gets at the general principle governing elasticity of demand: demand is 
more elastic the more and better the substitutes are. When there are high-quality 
substitutes readily available, it doesn’t take much of a price hike for consumers  
to be willing to consume something else that is almost as good. By the same 
token, if they are currently consumers of those substitutes, the producer 
of this good doesn’t have to drop his price much to lure large numbers of 
consumers his way. On the other hand, if we are talking about a life-saving 
medicine, the only gasoline station for 100 square miles, or other products for 
which substitutes are few and poor, demand should be less elastic. (Note that 
“less elastic” is the same thing as “more inelastic,” and “more elastic” is the 
same thing as “less inelastic.”)
Finally, we can also talk in principle about elasticity of supply. Elastic supply means 
that the amount producers are willing to supply increases (decreases) a lot 
when the price they are offered only increases (decreases) a little. Inelastic supply  
means that big price hikes (cuts) elicit little increase (decrease) in quantity 
supplied. What determines elasticity of supply is the number and closeness of 
alternative uses for the resources needed to supply this particular good. If peo-
ple who know how to run well-drilling equipment are hard to come by, then the 
rate at which workers get more expensive will also be high as the quantity of oil 
produced increases, so the supply curve should be steep. If extra resources are 
easy to get, then the supply curve should be relatively flat. Elasticity of supply 
seems not to come up as much as elasticity of demand, so we spend less time on 
it, but it is just as meaningful a concept economically as elasticity of demand.

Answers to In-Text Questions
2.1.	 Why do universities these days often spend so much money on 
facilities like apartments and state-of-the-art exercise facilities? I 
can think of two possibilities. Colleges may have an interest  
in their students being more comfortable (hence the nice 
apartments) and healthy (hence the gyms). Once upon a 
time this attitude of colleges toward their students was 
known as in loco parentis, or taking the role of parents when 
parents aren’t around. But many colleges since the 1960s 
have abandoned this goal, so I suspect this is not the case. 
It is more likely that students want these things, and so  
colleges find it in their interest to provide them. The same 
argument may apply to big-time college sports, which on 
their own (without taking account of their effect on enroll-
ment) often lose money.
2.2.	 a–b.  What are the opportunity costs, worker and otherwise, 
of making iPads in the U.S. or in a foreign country? 
Regardless of where the iPads are produced, the 
possible resources available to produce them are 
close to the same in each country. Obviously these 
include employees to run the assembly lines, differ-
ent employees to manage the factories (one could 
even say the time of both kinds workers), the land 
on which the factory sits, the various metals and 
chemicals that have to be used to run the assembly 
lines and have to be put into the iPads, the paper 
clips needed to hold office memos together, any vehi-
cles needed to transport them from the factory to 
the port, and so on. The opportunity cost of these 
resources may well differ in the two countries, which 
means that the resources may be used in different 
combinations. In China, they might use more workers 
and fewer machines, for example. But even after that, 
it will probably also mean that the iPads can be pro-
duced at lower social opportunity cost in only one 
of the two countries, and judging by where they are 
made now that country is likely to be China.
c.  What are the opportunity costs of publishing an online 
newspaper? Time of reporters and other staff, any 
costs that must be incurred to acquire the server or 
cloud space to hold content, probably the acquisition 
of at least some office space, etc.

Reasonably Simple Economics
29
d.  What are the opportunity costs of publishing a print news-
paper? Reporter and staff time again, plus more space 
for the physical production facilities, transportation 
equipment to get the papers from the printing press 
to where they are purchased, etc. Is it any wonder—
without even considering that a virtual newspaper 
can hold much more content than a paper one—that 
paper newspapers are rapidly disappearing in the age 
of the Internet?
e.  What are the opportunity costs of designing video games? 
Probably the most important input is the time, and 
highly skilled time at that, of the people who come 
up with video game concepts.
f.  What are the opportunity costs of manufacturing video 
games? Assuming the game comes on a CD or other 
disk format and is not accessed purely online, land 
and workers and the other kinds of things from parts 
(a)–(b), which also involve factory production, must 
be acquired to manufacture these discs. I would guess 
that this kind of work can be done by many more 
people, so it will not be as pricey as acquiring the time 
of the people who design the games.
g.  What are the opportunity costs of producing and selling  
a textbook on your own and then selling it as an e-book? 
The primary input is probably the time of the author. 
Once the book is uploaded, the opportunity cost of 
the storage space is practically zero. Indeed, once the 
book has been written, the author’s time becomes a 
sunk cost, so that the marginal costs of another copy 
of the book are infinitesimal. This helps explain why 
e-books are becoming more and more popular.
h.  What are the opportunity costs of producing and selling 
a textbook published traditionally? Now the costs of 
all the workers who work at the publishing com-
pany that specializes in finding markets for the book, 
workers who clean the office building, workers who 
arrange the president’s schedule and keep unwanted 
people out of his office, etc., must be paid. The ben-
efit, which is why we still observe such companies 
existing, is that people have an incentive to acquire 
expert knowledge in how best to market books.

2.3. Is your personal demand for purchasing gasoline very elastic 
or very inelastic? This depends on you of course. What are 
the next-best alternatives to your using your car for the 
things you use it for? The better your alternatives, the 
more elastic your demand for gasoline will be.
2.4. Is the demand for purchasing gasoline by an individual driver 
likely to be more elastic in the short run, say over the span 
of a few weeks, or in the long run, after the driver has had 
time to make major lifestyle changes if he needs to? I would 
say demand is more likely to be more elastic in the short 
run. The reason is that in a longer period of time people 
have more possibilities to make substitutions—they can 
move closer to the places they go, they can buy a more 
fuel-efficient car, they can seek out carpool partners, etc. 
I would go so far as to say that short-term demand is 
almost always more inelastic than long-term demand for 
the same action.
2.5. Is the elasticity of supply for gasoline likely to be higher in the  
short or long run? Same answer, for almost the same reason.  
Over the long term, people in a position to supply 
something have more possibilities for making alternative 
arrangements when their short-run plans face new obsta-
cles. If a revolution happens in the Middle East, taking oil 
off the market, or if the government imposes dramatic 
new regulations that make crude oil much costlier to drill 
for, in the short run the producers have little choice but 
to sit there and take it. In the long run they can discover 
new kinds of production technologies, find other locations 
to drill for oil at lower cost, etc.

Supply and 
Demand, 
Considered 
Together
Why Gasoline Is $4 a Gallon—or Isn’t
To repeat: we live in a world of scarcity, so no one can have everything he 
wants. Some procedures have to be found to decide how resources will be 
used and who will get how much of the resulting output. One way to do that 
is the market, to whose workings I now turn.
Equilibrium
It is first necessary to take our two curves, supply and demand, and place them 
in the same space, as shown in Figure 3-1.
3
C H A P T E R 

Chapter 3 | Supply and Demand, Considered Together
34
The supply of and demand for actions in Figure 3-1 are those for the buying 
and selling of gasoline. The more gasoline we ask producers to produce, the 
progressively more costly it gets at the margin as resources become scarcer, 
so we have the positively sloped supply curve. As the hypothetical price 
consumers (which includes all users of gasoline, not just drivers of private cars) 
may face gets lower (higher), gasoline becomes more (less) desirable relative 
to its alternatives, and so we have the negatively sloped demand curve.
Without for now wondering why, suppose oil companies really had no idea 
what price to charge. And so just to see what happened, on a particular day 
they decided to charge a price of $1.00 a gallon. At that relatively low price, 
they are willing to secure control over enough resources (oil-field workers, 
refinery workers, land, tanker capacity, paper clips, and so on) to produce, and 
do in fact produce, the amount noted on the chart as QS1 (with QS standing 
for quantity supplied). Unfortunately, at that price consumers are very keen 
to buy gasoline. The amount they’re willing to buy, in fact, extends all the way 
to QD1 (quantity demanded), which of course vastly exceeds QS1. So by 10 
in the morning, all the gasoline is gone, and consumers collectively still want 
QD1–QS1, which the producers are unwilling to supply. Thus many consumers 
show up at the station and leave frustrated, with their tanks having as little gas 
as when they got there.
In economics, this situation has a particular name: a shortage, meaning that at 
the prevailing market price quantity supplied is less than quantity demanded. 
Note what it does not mean: the fact that I want a new BMW but don’t have 
one does not indicate a shortage of BMWs, because I could get one if I were 
willing to pay the price the BMW dealer is offering. In the example shown in 
Figure 3-1, a lot of people are willing to pay a dollar a gallon for gas, but there 
is not enough gas to satisfy them all.
This sounds like a pretty unfortunate state of affairs. But the good news is that 
if the price increases above $1.00 a gallon, sellers will be willing and able to

bring more to market, and although the amount of gas consumers want at that 
price will still be higher than this new amount, the shortfall will be less than 
it was before. Gasoline producers can produce more and still sell everything 
they produce at a price that covers even the most expensive of all the new 
resources they need to acquire. Thus they will make more money than if they 
turned those consumers away. So producers are still willing to secure more 
resources and increase production, meaning that this problem tends to elimi-
nate itself. What we call excess demand, in other words, is a signal to gasoline 
producers to bring more to market.
Now consider the opposite problem, shown in Figure 3-2.
Suppose that oil companies’ initial reaction to the shortage is to guess that 
they should increase the price from $1.00 a gallon to $10.00 a gallon. Then 
society now faces the opposite problem—there is more gas produced (QS2) 
than consumers want (QD2). At that price, if it persists, individual consum-
ers make major shifts in their behavior. In the short run, they may carpool, 
work from home if they can, combine trips, give up the marginal vacation 
over Labor Day that has less value (but perhaps still take the big driving trip 
at Thanksgiving), etc. Over a longer time horizon,1 they may buy more fuel-
efficient cars, move closer to work, even retire if they are old enough. But one 
thing they do not do immediately is buy as much gasoline as producers pro-
duce. They demand QD2, while at that high price, sellers offer QS2. Gasoline 
piles up unsold, and over the long term that is no way to run a profitable 
business, since unsold gasoline would back up throughout the system and take 
up costly storage space. So prices come down, and this means resources are 
released to earn their opportunity costs in other industries. Oil gets used for 
something besides gasoline (and the oil that is the most expensive to extract

actually stays in the ground), workers working the high-cost fields must find 
other work, some wells are capped, some of the paperclips that the company 
would have bought for their office when they expected to sell at $10.00 a gallon 
are not bought and are thus available for others to use, and so on. There is 
a natural social pressure to decrease an activity (gasoline production) that 
is not valuable enough to consumers to justify the $10.00 price necessary to 
produce it in that quantity. In other words, the excess supply that results from 
the $10.00 price signals producers to produce less.
The moral of the story may be coming into focus at this point. There is 
only one price that elicits a change in neither quantity supplied nor quantity 
demanded, and that ensures that the amount produced is exactly equal to the 
amount desired. That price is where the supply curve crosses the demand 
curve, say at $4.00 a gallon (Figure 3-3).

The equilibrium quantity is denoted by Q*; if we are looking at individual

market we might want to inspect, it would be some considerably larger 
number. As economists generally do, I denote this equilibrium price and 
quantity—the price and quantity that stabilize this market—with asterisks.
It is important to realize what we have just done here. We have built a model 
of some market for gasoline. What, in economics, is a model? It is not an 
exact description, because to describe a thing exactly would require that we 
duplicate the thing exactly—in this case people producing and buying gaso-
line. A completely accurate model of the gasoline market would be an exact 
duplicate of the gasoline market, and thus of no use in analyzing the real one. 
The same problem haunts mapmaking. The more detailed the map you want, 

Reasonably Simple Economics
37
the bigger it must be, and an exact map would have to be the same size as the 
thing you want a map of, rendering the map useless.
In using models like the one for gasoline, we are trying to describe approxi-
mately how markets decide who gets what. Is it a good model? Sometimes 
it doesn’t work; after the September 11 attacks, gasoline pumps really did 
run out of gas for a few days, and car makers sometimes underestimate (and 
sometimes overestimate)2 how many cars of a new model they will sell. But 
overall, we seldom observe consumers unable to get their hands on pencils, 
cars, houses, a college education, and indeed most things, provided only they are 
willing to pay the prevailing price. That, of course, is different from saying that 
anyone who wants a thing (health care, a college education, a particular job) 
can get it on the terms they want. Overall, our little model seems to give us a 
good understanding of how markets make decisions. We will see shortly that 
it also helps us understand the reaction to economic change.
But before going on to that, it is worth investigating what is going on behind 
the market equilibrium. As hinted at earlier, the market is simply a system for 
deciding what will get made and what won’t, and who will get how much of 
what is made. The market is the system of reliance on self-interest and on 
people using their resources as they see fit (and not having them taken away 
without their consent, for example through taxation or regulation, which lim-
its the use of some resources) to allocate resources. This is like a form of 
cooperation. No, strike that—it is cooperation. There is gasoline because oil 
companies have gone to the ends of the earth looking for crude oil and have 
paid workers to extract it. They have purchased oil tankers and hired work-
ers to staff them. They have rented space at ports (if the oil is imported) to 
unload it and have transported it in trucks to a refinery. That refinery was built 
on land acquired by the oil company, and the gasoline that emerges from it 
is shipped to thousands of stations that exist because small business owners 
have negotiated franchise agreements with Shell, BP, and others. And these 
franchise owners have their own employees, their own negotiations with pur-
veyors of junk food, playing cards, and the other ephemera found in the con-
venience stores that have so efficiently attached to gasoline stations.3
None of this happens because it has been designed. Rather, it all happens one 
bargain at a time. And the result is that all the gas that we are willing to use, 
and no more, is there when we want it. It is a sort of un-conducted symphony,

3Once upon a time, gas stations had car-repair bays and mechanics but nothing to eat or 
drink that didn’t come out of a soda machine. Competition has long since pushed car 
repair to shops that specialize in that, and the service garages in gas stations have been 
replaced by convenience stores. Why? Because it is a more efficient use of space—a use 
that creates more value after taking account of the cost of providing it.

Tip
■
■
  Remember that “the market” is simply one way of reconciling conflicting individual interests 
and deciding how scarce resources get used. Prices perform a critical function of giving people 
guidance about how to act in a market setting, given that others have their own goals too.
To help you think about how it works, here’s something to consider that 
may not have occurred to you. In recent years, the economies of China and 
India have been rising rapidly, although both countries are still very poor. One 
byproduct is that a lot of young Chinese and Indians are studying extremely 
hard, trying to get into good schools and believing that their hard work will 
pay off in far better jobs than their parents could have imagined were possible. 
But young people needing to do their homework and practice for exams has 
caused demand for pencils to increase extraordinarily. More and more young 
people who used to quit school at a very young age (if they went at all) to 
start working, especially on farms, are staying in school later and studying 
harder. So pencils are, seemingly, scarcer.
But have we noticed this in the office supply stores in the U.S.? Probably 
not. Every time we want a pencil, we need only go to the local store and the 
shelves are full of them. So a significant social change has occurred, a modifica-
tion in the value humanity collectively attaches to pencils. There is a greater 
demand for pencils than there was before, and markets have responded by 
prompting pencil companies to bid for more resources, figure out ways to 
either get production costs down (for example, by moving pencil production 
to places where the cost of acquiring resources, like worker time, is lower), 
or charge more by making the pencils more valuable (for example, through 
the development of ever-more sophisticated mechanical pencils). As a result, 
people who desire pencils get them at a price most are willing to pay. No one 
gives it any thought, but it happens anyway, without any guiding hand, just like 
the drivers in Christiansfeld.
Pencils of course are individually negligible, and even collectively are small in 
the grand scheme of human affairs, but pencilmaking is also a vast industry 
whose production and distribution is part of a global system. They are really 
no different from anything whose production and delivery we unfortunately

take for granted. The lesson, to which we will return, is that the market does 
not really allocate things in the sense of consciously making decisions, although 
we often use that term as shorthand. Rather, the market is the mechanism 
by which people pursue their interests cooperatively by using resources in 
conjunction with others to get things done. It is individuals who are consciously 
making decisions, using only their power to persuade based on the offers they 
are willing to make. It is a different way of deciding what gets used to do what 
than a bureaucrat or president ordering people to do things under penalty of 
law. And the constant delivery of these things under the market mechanism—
in the presence also of constant change—is something that our supply-
and-demand model can help us understand better.
Changes in Supply and Demand
Remember first the distinctions between supply and quantity supplied, and 
demand and quantity demanded. When I talk about a “change in supply” or 
“change in demand,” I’m talking about something that shifts the entire sup-
ply curve or demand curve in one direction or another. The equilibrium 
quantity—“quantity supplied”—will also change, but that is something we can 
think about only after we think about which curve shifts which way. And here are 
the first rules in trying to decide which curve to shift:
1.	 Supply curves shift if and only if something changes to 
affect the difficulty of getting the necessary resources  
to produce the good at any price. This is a change that 
affects producers primarily—it only indirectly affects con-
sumers after the supply curve has shifted.
2.	 Demand curves shift if and only if something changes to 
affect consumers’ willingness to pay for the product at 
any price. Producers are affected only secondarily after 
the demand curve has shifted.
The most common thing that shifts a supply curve is technological progress.  
I do not mean progress in the product itself—for example, a cell phone with 
new capabilities. Instead I mean progress that allows producers to produce 
the good while needing to procure fewer resources. Perhaps the single most 
powerful example of this in modern times was the creation of the assembly 
line, which allowed workers to concentrate on particular tasks rather than 
produce an entire product on their own from start to finish. The assembly line 
made it much easier—in other words, possible at much lower resource cost—
to produce large numbers of standardized products. In 1876, Philadelphia held 
a grand Centennial Exposition, one of whose exhibits involved leather work-
ers making saddles individually, finishing one every two days. By the time of the 
Panama Pacific International Exposition in San Francisco in 1915, Ford ­workers 

Chapter 3 | Supply and Demand, Considered Together

were making one Ford car every half hour on their specially constructed 
assembly line. Figure 3-4 shows what such technological progress (applied to 
one particular good, like autos in 1890 versus autos in 1920) looks like in a 
supply-demand diagram.

Figure 3-4.  Supply shifts right (for example, through technological progress)
Technological progress means that to produce the same quantity, whatever 
that quantity is, now requires incurring lower resource costs than before. 
So any quantity can be produced at lower price compared to before, and 
the entire supply curve shifts to the right,5 from the curve labeled S0 to that 
labeled S1. The fundamental value of the product to the consumer at any price 
does not change in any way, so the demand curve stays the same. The result 
is that equilibrium price falls, from P0* to P1*, and equilibrium quantity goes 
up, from Q0* to Q1*. (By convention, in this book a 0 indicates the situation 
before the change, and 1 is the situation after. In this exercise, the supply curve 
shifts, but the demand curve does not; if either curve shifts, the equilibrium  
P and Q must both change.) And this is what should happen. The fact that we 
can produce something of value to consumers at lower opportunity cost than 
before means we should expect to see more of it produced, and we should 
expect to see its price fall.
This kind of technological progress is actually a continuous story in human 
civilization, especially in the last 300 years. We can now obtain climate control, 
calories, transportation, and information at far lower cost than prior genera-
tions could, and so our consumption of these things has gone up. Although 
5Note that it is confusing to say “supply shifts down,” since this is easy to confuse with the 
statement that “quantity supplied shifts down,” when it actually goes up, from Q0* to Q1*. 
I prefer to talk about supply curves shifting to the left or to the right, and to be consistent 
I will use the same language for demand.

we tend to focus on things that seem to be getting more expensive, such as 
health care (which is actually available in much better quantity and quality to 
more people around the world than at any other time in history) and higher 
education (ditto), the overwhelming fact of modern life is our ability to obtain 
more of the things we want at lower cost than before. The reason for this is 
explored in detail in Chapter 9.
Another possible change is that a resource becomes harder to get, perhaps 
because of greater competition for it or disruption in supply. Figure 3-5 shows 
what the situation would look like in the supply-demand model.

Figure 3-5. Supply curve shifts left/constriction of supply (for example, through embargo, 
war, or new competition for resources)
When a big new factory opens in town, there is greater competition for 
employees, land, etc. (When a big factory closes, of course, the effect is the 
opposite.) Land rents go up, and finding workers may become harder, so it 
becomes more expensive to operate other businesses. The supply curve for 
other nearby businesses that compete for the same resources should shift left. 
When New York City is booming and there is a lot of new demand for office 
space, a landlord who owns many apartment buildings will find it harder to 
turn down higher offers for his property. Many such landowners will choose 
to convert their land from residential use to commercial use—office towers, 
shopping centers, and so forth. So the land gets reallocated from lower-prior-
ity uses to higher-priority ones. Housing becomes scarcer and more expen-
sive. Naturally, people who lose their apartments when landlords sell these 
properties are not happy about it. But the opportunity cost of allowing them 
to stay would be that businesses that can also do things of value for their 
customers by locating in New York City will be unable to do so. So again, the 
market is simply a way of prioritizing.
Note that the same effect just illustrated can occur when supplies are cut off 
because of bad weather, war, or political decisions. A classic example was the

embargo on oil exports imposed by Arab countries from October 1973 to 
March 1974 because of U.S. support for Israel during the war that began in 
the former month. This made gasoline, which relies on oil as a key resource, 
costlier to produce and should have caused gasoline prices to go up in the U.S. 
Indeed it did, although not as much as it should have, for reasons I discuss later. 
The Chinese government has for some time now limited exports of so-called 
rare earth metals,6 which are used in computer screens, computer chips, and 
environmentally friendly energy production such as wind power, among other 
things, and this should serve to make these things costlier outside of China.7
Note that in each of these cases, we are observing more intense competi-
tion for certain resources, which serves to drive up their price and therefore 
the price of goods that use the resources. In some cases this is because new 
demanders enter the market (such as the factory opening and seeking work-
ers and land), and in other cases it is because sellers take resources off the 
market (the oil embargo, a military blockade, the Chinese rare-earth policies). 
Changes in the terms of competition will again shift supply or demand (it is 
the supply curve that will shift in the examples discussed so far in this section)  
and thus cause society to make changes in what gets made. And this again 
is how markets make decisions. If the Chinese rare-earth limits continue, 
I would predict that at least in the short term, goods that are made with these 
elements will become more expensive, and in the long term I would predict 
that alternatives to these metals would be found, that other ways besides 
relying on these now more expensive resources for manufacturing would be 
developed. I would expect, in other words, people to respond to incentives.
Demand curves can also shift as well. Recall that the things that shift demand 
curves are different from the things that shift supply curves. Demand curves 
shift because the value of the product to consumers had changed, whereas 
supply curves shift when the ease with which suppliers can get resources 
changes.
In Figure 3-6, demand has shifted to the right. We can think, for example, 
about the product becoming more useful to someone. As the marginal reward 
for having a college degree goes up, people find they are more willing to pay 
for it than before. At least in the short term, with the number of available 
college seats relatively fixed, there is nothing to do but move up along the 
existing supply curve. More people—professors, secretaries, deans, librarians, 
tech-support experts, to mention just a few—have to be lured away from 
alternative activity and paid at least their opportunity cost. And if new buildings

have to be built and new equipment purchased, these resources become more 
costly, because the supply curve is positively sloped after all, and so tuition 
goes up.
This reveals an often underappreciated aspect of supply/demand thinking: the 
cause of higher prices often can be traced back to the demand side. In the case of 
rapidly escalating college costs, much criticism has focused on rising expenses 
for some elements of a university education, from the salaries of university 
presidents8 to academic journal subscription fees.9 Defensive university offi-
cials, when asked about why tuition is rising so fast, invariably point to higher 
costs. But that simply raises another question: why are these costs higher? I 
would suggest that the rising demand for a college degree is partly responsible 
for this. This is especially compelling given that new colleges of the traditional 
form rarely open, so the number of seats can only be expanded modestly in 
the short run. Supply, in other words, is inelastic in the short run, so rising 
demand causes price to escalate significantly.10

Demand can also shift to the right if a substitute for the good disappears. In 
that case, I would also expect demand to become less elastic. We see this 
when one grocery store closes in an area that used to have two, or when 
laws are passed restricting consumers’ ability to buy foreign products, and 
they must turn to domestic ones. In general, anything that increases consumer 
willingness to pay for the product, whether the product is better or because 
alternatives become fewer or worse, should shift demand to the right.
The last possible type of curve shift is the demand curve shifting to the left 
(Figure 3-7).
If demand shifting to the right reflects higher willingness to pay, it stands to 
reason that shifting to the left means lower willingness to pay. The primary 
reason for this is the introduction of a substitute, which can also be phrased as 
increased competition. (Products seldom become intrinsically less valuable, only 
less valuable relative to the alternatives.) A second restaurant in town should 
cause demand at the first to go down, so it sells fewer meals and charges less 
(or increases portions at the existing price). At a much greater level, the intro-
duction of cell phones appears to have dramatically lowered the demand for 
landline phones, and presumably for phone wiring and employees of landline 
phone services.
The good news about all this is that we always have a way forward. When 
change happens, markets provide a way, mediated by changes in prices, of 
transferring resources through competition to minimize adjustment costs. 
The invention of digital photography and later the insertion of digital cameras 
in cell phones dealt a near-death blow to film and film cameras, and factories 
that made them were closed. As a result, land and workers were released, and 
investment funds were transferred to other uses. Note particularly in the case 
of workers that many of the workers are future workers, who no longer take 
jobs at Kodak at the age of 20 and are thus employed in industries with brighter

futures. In reality, because of a constant flow of innovation, some activities are 
constantly staking claims to more resources, and others constantly releasing 
them. Although the graphs so far in this chapter illustrate simple one-time 
adjustments, the economy is constantly in flux, with resources gradually mov-
ing to where they are in greatest demand at the moment because consumers 
are willing to pay more for those goods than for others that use the same 
resources.
Prices in this system play a critical role, in particular as a way of making people 
take account of the consequences for everyone else of their choices. When 
the price, because of a shortage, goes up, it tells consumers that if they want 
to continue to buy a good, they will be imposing greater social costs because 
resources are diverted to this industry from their best alternate use; they will 
only buy if the value to them justifies paying that price. Similarly, producers are 
told, as the price of what they sell goes up, that in fact society does value more 
of their goods to an extent sufficient to justify their acquiring those resources. 
(The opposite reasoning holds true when prices decline in response to a 
surplus.) If prices are not allowed to freely move up or down, bad things 
happen because people do not have to face all of these consequences.
This is often not how prices are seen. Prices are often viewed not as a device 
for coordinating the resolution of conflicting desires over scarce resources, 
but as acts of will, especially when they are too high, and as the result 
of “sinful” conduct by one party or another. Following the term coined by 
Thomas Sowell, volitional pricing, I refer to this belief as the fallacy of volition—
the contention that prices are what they are because sellers or buyers with 
substantial degree of freedom over what the price will be choose them to be 
very high or very low.
In fact, our model suggests that the reason prices are what they are is that 
those are the terms given to us by supply and demand. In my experience, there 
are few markets more subject to the fallacy of volition than that of gasoline, 
with 2012 polling data indicating,11 for example, that the most widely shared 
reason among the American public for high gasoline prices (when they are 
high) is “oil companies that want to make too much profit.” It would be an 
interesting experiment, when gas prices are low, to discover how many people 
credit “oil companies that want to forgo high profits in the public interest.” In 
the meantime, one can only note that oil companies in the long term are not a 
particularly high-profit industry. And consider the chart shown in Figure 3-8.

the oil curve lies above the gasoline curve as the curves actually work out.)

So the primary determinant of gasoline prices seems to be oil prices. Oil com-
panies are not unusually greedy when gasoline prices go up, just as they are 
not unusually benevolent when they go down (which, from time to time, they 
do, as Figure 3-8 shows). Oil companies are trying to make as much money 
as possible—pursuing their self-interest—by providing gasoline to consumers, 
for whom buying it is in their self-interest. The existence of a market for gaso-
line allows both oil companies (including their shareholders and workers) and 
the people who want to drive (or fly, for that matter, although jet fuel is a dif-
ferent product) to cooperatively pursue their interests. This is fundamentally 
what markets are about: they are a way to get everyone to work together to 
enable us to do things.
So why the eagerness to blame oil companies when prices go up? There is 
little understanding of the complex network these companies have woven 
together to drill for oil in far-flung places by hiring workers, building and 
running refineries, contracting with other companies to buy equipment, 
and organizing transport networks all over the globe, in order to get gaso-
line to the pump. It is an amazingly complex problem, and its cost fluctuates 
wildly, especially because of changes in beliefs about the scarcity of crude oil. 
That such beliefs and the resulting changes in oil prices would be the primary 
determinant of what we pay at the pump is really not such an outrageous 
thing to believe. But pointing fingers, in the manner of those who charge that 
prices are high because people are being “ripped off,” starts from a different 
premise, which is that prices could be changed without any significant con-
sequences other than someone not earning money that they don’t deserve 
anyway. But the same people who complain about the greed of others when 
it means they are not getting the terms they want, the same people unwill-
ing to believe that prices reflect scarcity and value, may be quick to engage in 
exactly the same behavior when they are on the other side of the transaction, 
as when labor unions who agitate for higher wages for their own members 
pay people low wages and no benefits to do the union’s own work.12 (Recall 
that this was the topic of Economics Out There reading 1.2) But if prices are 
set because of scarcity and competition, altering them by force of law cannot 
but have negative consequences, as we are about to see.
Price Controls
As noted earlier, prices are the key mechanism markets use to allocate 
resources when people disagree about how they should be used. But some-
times prices cause disquiet. Health services cost so much that some people 
who could benefit immensely nonetheless go without some health services.

The downside of Manhattan being, in some respects, the center of American 
if not global business and media is that lots of people want to use the very 
limited amount of land on that tiny island. And so if one wants to live in an apart-
ment there, one must pay a price (rent) sufficient to compensate the owners 
for the opportunity cost of not using the land for some other purpose.
Prices that are “too high” (or “too low” when, for example, small farmers go 
bankrupt because the revenue from their farming cannot support the costs 
they face, or when workers earn wages that are less than what it takes for 
them to buy things seen as the minimum marks of a decent life) thus draw 
public concern. And occasionally this concern leads to passing laws that limit 
the freedom to charge or pay certain prices, especially via the imposition of 
legally mandated maximum or minimum prices. By general convention, econo-
mists refer to these measures as price controls.
The supply/demand model allows us to think about what happens under such 
measures, and why. Refer back to Figure 3-1. At the time, the figure represented 
only a temporary situation in the market, before the adjustment to equilibrium 
had been carried out. Left to its own devices, as we saw, the price would drift 
up to its equilibrium level P* ($4.00), quantity demanded would decline from 
QD1 to Q*, and quantity supplied would increase from QS1 to Q*.
Now, if the law imposes a maximum ceiling on prices at $1.00 a gallon, what 
happens? Proponents of the law, or at least of price controls in general, believe 
that the primary consequence is that people who cannot afford the good—
gasoline, apartments in Manhattan, health care, whatever—will simply get 
what they need when before, because of the greed of sellers, they couldn’t. 
But everything about that belief is wrong. First, “need” is not a word with an 
objective meaning; there are only tradeoffs. Second, the reason that at the low 
price only QS1 is supplied is because the marginal cost of supplying more is 
constantly increasing—in other words, the supply curve is positively sloped. 
If we cap the price that can be charged at $1.00 a gallon, what was a tempo-
rary situation now becomes a permanent one. Unfortunately, the amount that 
consumers want at that price, QD1, significantly exceeds the amount that 
producers are willing to offer them. We have scarcity just like before, but we 
are no longer allowed to use price to change behavior on both the selling and 
buying sides of the market.
The scarcity is still there, however; there is still a gap between the amount 
consumers want and the amount producers will offer them. If price cannot 
do the job, some other way will be found to allocate something scarce among the 
people who are competing for it. If people are not allowed to bid money, in other 
words, they will have to bid something else to get their hands on this valuable 
good. In the case of gasoline in particular, along with a great many other goods, 
one alternate rationing method is time. You can see what that looks like in 

Chapter 3 | Supply and Demand, Considered Together
50
a scene13 from the country of Nigeria. It is one of the largest oil producers in 
the world, and yet people frequently wait hours and even days in line for gas. 
Asked why they must endure this, people might blame some proximate cause 
like the lack of investment in infrastructure or of delivery trucks or refining 
capacity in their country. But this simply begs the question of why is there 
inadequate investment in such things?
Through a variety of limits on the ability of producers to earn more revenue by 
selling gasoline, Nigeria, like China, Iran, and other countries, provides insuffi-
cient incentive to invest in such infrastructure. If price were the only rationing 
device, the price of gasoline in Nigeria would be much higher, people would 
correspondingly consume less, but every time they wanted it, it would be 
there. But if price is limited as a rationing device, then waiting in line for gas 
(until it runs out, at which point one must wait for the next delivery) becomes 
another cost of acquiring gasoline. In the U.S., to get gasoline one pays P* and 
one is done, while in other countries one must pay a small monetary price 
but a huge time price. People who are willing to wait to get gasoline get it, and 
people who are not, don’t. (Of course, someone who is not willing to wait to 
get gasoline can pay someone to wait in line for him, which is another com-
mon consequence of price ceilings of this kind. Society must then pay the cost 
of whatever else the person waiting would have been doing.)
Well, you may say, these are the kinds of things that happen in Nigeria and 
China, but they couldn’t happen here because the U.S. is a more advanced 
country. But they did happen in the U.S. Because of inflation in the early 1970s, 
Congress gave the administration of President Richard Nixon the power to 
control prices of many goods, including crude oil, the key ingredient in gasoline. 
Beginning in 1972, lines began to appear at U.S. gas stations. As noted above, 
after the U.S. supported Israel against several Arab countries in its 1973 war, 
the latter countries retaliated by refusing to sell oil (that is, by embargoing oil) 
to the U.S., substantially exacerbating the problem.
Remarkably, in response, more power was granted to the president to direct 
the allocation of oil in addition to its price by the creation of the Federal 
Energy Administration, which developed a mathematical formula for decid-
ing how much oil went not to each driver, as sellers in a free market would 
do, but to each state. Bureaucrats in Washington, instead of oil companies 
responding to the supply, demand, and prices they faced while trying to make 
money, decided where gasoline should be allocated. The result was that gaso-
line stations routinely ran out of gas; this was what motivated people to get 
in line very early to begin with. (Back in those days, gasoline stations had no 
convenience stores and were not open 24 hours.)

Lines dissipated somewhat with the ending of the embargo, but returned 
with a vengeance in 1979, partly due to political instability in Iran, a major 
oil exporter to the U.S. Although by this time the deregulation of oil prices 
had been planned, it had yet to take effect, and at one point during this time 
crude oil prices in the U.S. secondary market (the market for people who had 
bought barrels of oil and wanted to sell them) were in some contexts limited 
to $6 a barrel while the global price at which oil was trading was $30 a barrel. 
In January, 1981, all price controls on crude oil production ended, and gas lines 
have essentially been unknown in the U.S. since that time. (Their absence 
after the Iraq invasion of Kuwait in 1991 and, after a few days had passed, after 
the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks is telling.) Instead, prices are used 
to ration supplies.
I argued earlier that this system of letting supply and/or demand to adjust 
allows society to most easily accommodate changed circumstances, and that 
is in fact what has happened in recent years. The rapid development of popu-
lous countries such as China, India, and Brazil has led to demand for oil in 
those places and others to increase rapidly. That increased demand has been 
transmitted as higher prices, and Americans have made marginal adjustments 
in their driving habits to accommodate this rise.14
Other kinds of price controls have analogous effects. New York City intro-
duced sharp limits on apartment rents and the rate at which they could 
increase during World War II, and many of those restrictions remain even 
today. Unsurprisingly, New York City (and other cities where apartment rent-
als are subject to legal maximums) is a very difficult place to find an apartment. 
If you are a landowner, why should you use that land to provide relatively 
low-rent housing when the government of the city of New York is prepared 
to limit your ability to earn income—and while using the land for other pur-
poses by not building the apartments to begin with is not subject to such 
restrictions?
In another example of the effects of preventing prices from doing their job of 
resolving competing demand for scarce goods, in 2010 a senator from New 
York, using the persuasive space that is often available more to politicians than 
to others (in the form of a press that loves to cover everything politicians say), 
got airlines to promise not to charge for overhead-bin space. (So far, they may 
charge for checked bags without incurring any senator’s wrath.) Since that 
time, the scramble for such space has deteriorated, as passengers ignore the 
pleas of airline crews and fill the space as fast as they can, often with luggage 
14 Note also that an oil embargo, which was so traumatic under price controls in 1973, was 
also imposed by Arab countries during the previous 1967 Arab-Israeli war, but there 
were no price controls in effect then, and not coincidentally no gas lines either.

Chapter 3 | Supply and Demand, Considered Together
52
that takes up large amounts of bin space. Were the airlines allowed to charge 
a price for the space that reflected its value, it would be used more wisely 
(and passengers would pack more sparingly).
Note also that price-control laws can establish legal minimum prices as well as 
legal maximum prices. In that case, we would start from the position depicted in 
Figure 3-2. There is an initial price above the market-clearing (that is, equilibrium) 
price, which ordinarily induces consumers to buy less and producers to pro-
duce less, therefore releasing resources to earn their opportunity cost in some 
other activity whose output consumers are willing to buy at prevailing prices. 
The analysis is similar to the case of legal maximum prices, in the sense that an 
adjustment that would ordinarily happen due to competition now does not, or 
at least happens in a very costly way. Because producers are given the signal that 
the price they will get for their output is very high ($10.00 in the figure), they 
continue to produce very high levels of that output, while consumers facing that 
price are not willing to buy as much. And so we have a permanent surplus, the 
mirror image of the permanent shortage when there is a legal maximum price.
So what happens? A more costly form of reaction to the prevailing incentives. 
Because of widespread sympathy for farmers as a repository of traditional 
values, a reluctance to import food from other countries in the belief that 
such supplies are unreliable, and the political power of farmers’ lobbyists, many 
countries guarantee their farmers minimum prices for their output. If those 
prices were below the equilibrium price it would not matter, but because the 
goal is to keep farmers who would otherwise exit the industry employed 
producing agricultural products, that of course seldom happens. In India, the 
government as of this writing uses a classic price-support scheme in which 
it buys various kinds of beans and grains, cotton, and crops used for cooking 
oil from farmers at an announced minimum price if the market price of these 
goods falls below the minimum. Unsurprisingly, despite India’s poverty, huge 
amounts of surpluses are generated, some of which was actually exported in 
the 2000s because prices were higher overseas. In addition, the highest-quality 
grain is often sold by farmers to grain traders, meaning the government gets 
crops more prone to spoilage.15
The governments of the U.S. and the European Union, historically among 
the world’s greatest sinners with regard to giving direct price supports to 
farmers, have changed their policies and now support farmers not by buying 
up surpluses at great expense16 but by giving them crop insurance at 
below-market rates (U.S.) or loans to buy equipment, again at below-market

rates (Europe). These policies continue to generate large amounts of agricultural 
surplus, which is frequently disposed of by selling it to very poor countries 
at a price that is above the marginal cost of continued storage but below the 
marginal cost of production in those countries, so that development of local 
agricultural capacity which would otherwise make sense is deterred.
Another oft-cited example of minimum prices is the minimum wage. Many 
countries, including the U.S., have minimum-wage laws. Many American states 
also have higher minimum wages than the federal minimum. Under such laws, 
if an employer offers a wage, and an employee is willing to accept it, the two 
parties are nonetheless prohibited from striking a bargain if the wage agreed 
to falls below the legal minimum. The result is that jobs demanded exceed 
jobs supplied, permanently.
Most economists tend to discuss the effect of such laws on the ability of 
people to get jobs (about which I say more later in this chapter). But the pri-
mary effect is actually the output not produced because production costs are 
higher. After the disastrous 2004 tsunami that killed over 100,000 people in 
countries bordering the Indian Ocean, for example, relief groups immediately 
set to work clearing debris and bodies, and in Indonesia paid the prevailing 
local wage of just over three dollars a day.17 This illustrates two aspects of 
supply and demand that are often neglected.
First of all, from the point of view of the entire society, jobs are a means to an 
end and not the end itself. Again, we like to think that we work for ourselves, 
but in some sense we actually work for everybody else, providing things that 
they value. The market for labor, like the market for everything else, is simply 
a way of tying us together for mutual gain. (See the discussion of cost here 
for a reminder.)
And this raises the second point, which is that from the point of view of a 
business and from society, employees are actually a cost. Employees must be 
paid salaries and benefits, and there’s no reason to do that unless the benefits 
to the employer of doing so exceed these costs. But the amount of money an 
employee earns is in part dependent on the opportunity cost of the worker’s 
time, which means that to hire a person, society gives up that worker’s next-
best alternative use of time. Businesses, to the surprise of many, are not in 
business to provide jobs, and so it is somewhat misleading to refer to them as 
“employers.” They are in business to make money, and typically the primary 
way they do this is by selling a good product at a good price. Jobs are simply 
one of many costs incurred in the process of doing that, and when we raise 
those costs, for example via a minimum wage, we must have less of the 
things that that business was producing before. In the case of the Indonesian

example, had the charities described in the article been required to pay the 
Western idea of a “living wage,” not only would far fewer people have been 
hired, but the cleanup work would have been much more costly and taken 
much longer.
Note

  Businesses do not exist to provide jobs. Employee costs are but one of the costs a 
business, and hence society, incurs on the road to making a profit. Businesses exist to advance their 
owners’ interests, which is generally done by producing things that people want to buy.
But of course a price floor for labor has effects on those who are willing to 
offer their labor in the market—employees or workers, in other words—as 
well. Note first that minimum-wage laws do not affect everyone; they are 
only operative for people whose productivity is not high enough to allow 
them to command a wage above the minimum. (I discuss the economics of 
compensation more thoroughly in Chapter 6). However, the flip side of this 
is that the people who are unable to find work are precisely those whose 
productivity is below the minimum, who one might suppose are those most 
in need of accumulating work experience. What is more, the existence of 
minimum wages allows employers to be choosy in ways that they could not 
in its absence. They may indulge discriminatory tastes to weed out workers 
that do not differ in terms of productivity from the ones hired, but whose sex, 
race, sexual orientation, and so on make the employer uncomfortable. Those 
workers might then find it harder to find a job. Among other places, research 
has demonstrated that this effect exists in Canada, where minimum-wage laws 
tend to cause substitution away from younger workers (who are more of a 
gamble for an employer) toward older ones (who have more of a record that 
the employer can use to estimate how productive they are likely to be), and 
for women workers in Japan.18
The bottom line with price controls is that the fundamental problem they are 
meant to address is scarcity, and prices are simply a way of bringing the news—
they are not the news itself. Relying on price to allocate scarce resources is 
of course only one way of solving that problem. But other methods of adjust-
ments bring social costs that reliance on price does not. The most important 
is deadweight costs, which Paul Heyne defines with beautiful simplicity as “costs 
to the purchaser that are not simultaneously benefits to the seller.”19 Time is

the most obvious example. The hours that Nigerians must stand in line waiting 
to buy gasoline are without question a cost to them. But unlike the money 
costs they must shoulder, time costs do not benefit sellers, and therefore do 
not motivate them to bring more gasoline to market.
In the case of rent control, an entire industry has arisen that helps people find 
the very small number of apartments that become available. These apartment 
brokers are a completely unnecessary cost; the dollars that would-be tenants 
pay for their services is a very real social cost, but to the extent that tenants 
pay fees to the brokers rather than to landlords, landlords again receive no 
signal that society would value the provision of more apartments given the 
social opportunity cost of doing so. If rent control disappeared tomorrow, 
some apartment brokers would still exist, but they would (much like real-
estate brokers in the uncontrolled market for home sales) charge not tenants 
but landlords, who would be paying to inform potential tenants that apart-
ments are available. The supply of apartments would go up, and people in New 
York would do what people in cities without rent control do—spend a day or 
two looking at a few apartments, and then rent one.
Tip
■
■
  Recall the old saying about not shooting the messenger. Prices are messages about 
the consequences of particular choices, and people or companies that post them are merely 
messengers.
Note also that sometimes people actually manage to evade price controls, but 
only by generating other deadweight losses. Landlords often adopt a require-
ment that tenants put up thousands of dollars in key money, which is not a 
deposit but basically a one-time fee to start living in the apartment, on top of 
their monthly rent. This requires that potential tenants either borrow money 
or save money for months or years, money that they would otherwise spend 
on other things. In short, this creates an unnecessary extra step to obtaining 
a scarce good. In addition, the problem of revenues being too low to cover 
the cost of the action of providing apartments can also be abated by getting 
cost down—for example, by refusing to maintain building quality at a level that 
would prevail if tenants were allowed to use money to express their willing-
ness to pay for the extra upkeep.
Another form of deadweight loss occurs because the scarce resources do not 
end up in the hands of those who value them the most. An elderly widower 
who has been living in a spacious rent-controlled apartment since the 1940s 
and raised his children there could now get by on less space, if the choices of 
elderly people in non-price-controlled environments who move into smaller 
spaces once they retire are any guide. But because he is paying an artificially 
limited rent, he is earning a huge surplus by getting to live in a large space in 

Chapter 3 | Supply and Demand, Considered Together
56
Manhattan. This has the social cost of preventing someone who values the 
space more—a family with three children that looks just like the widower’s 
did once upon a time, for example—from using it.
When prices can adjust freely, people whose willingness to pay is at least 
as high as the posted price get things. People without that same willingness 
don’t get them. When prices are not allowed to do this work (and assuming 
some method like key money or bribery is not found to duplicate, albeit with 
deadweight costs, the market price), scarce resources are basically allocated 
by luck. Some people who want apartments cannot get them and thus fail to 
come to New York City to pursue their goals, or else live farther away and 
incur deadweight transport and other costs. Even those who find apartments 
often wish they could pay more for a bigger one, but the rent lottery leaves 
them unable to.
And sometimes luck’s got nothin’ to do with it. It emerged several years ago 
that the powerful New York City Congressman Charles Rangel had four 
rent-controlled apartments in a single Manhattan building,20 using three as a 
residence and a fourth as an office. Although there is no way of knowing the 
impact for sure, Congressmen often by the very nature of their job build up 
useful connections with local movers and shakers and certainly have a mea-
sure of power to restrict the trading possibilities of ordinary citizens, which 
may have had a role in this particular allocation of these particular scarce 
resources. As a consequence, Congressman Rangel gets four apartments, and 
three people who might have used these apartments to pursue their dreams 
of a career in acting, finance, or web design—or who could have come to 
Manhattan to take care of a sick relative—get none.
But ’twas ever thus. There have been price controls for as long as there 
have been governments to set them. The Code of Hammurabi, which was 
promulgated in approximately the 18th century B.C. in Babylon by the 
king of the same name, is most famous for its requirement of the “eye 
for an eye, tooth for a tooth” punishment. But in fact much of the code is 
devoted (as in the early Roman legal code known as the Twelve Tables21) 
to setting prices on goods and services. The historical record is not exten-
sive enough to allow us to know whether the predicted shortages devel-
oped, but we do know that around the time of the promulgation of this 
code, many Babylonian business organizations disappeared. Sometimes we 
know that the controls are ineffective because of the extreme penalties 
for merchants who violate them—which historically was often death. Such

was the case in the Golden Age of Athens, where a prosecutor made the 
following plea to the jury:
But it is necessary, gentlemen of the jury, to chastise them 
[businessmen charging prices above what was allowed] not only for 
the sake of the past, but also as an example for the future; where as 
things now are, they will hardly be endurable in the future. And 
consider that in consequence of this vocation, very many have already 
stood trial for their lives; and so great are the emoluments which 
they are able to derive from it that they prefer to risk their life every 
day, rather than cease to draw from you, the public, their improper 
profits… If then, you shall condemn them, you shall act justly and you 
will buy grain cheaper; otherwise the price will be much more.22
And yet much more the price continued to be, judging by the continuing need 
after this anonymous speech to put merchants on trial for their lives. Note 
the something-for-nothing promise of capital punishment allowing the public 
to “buy grain cheaper”; such promises are common features of competition 
among politicians for public favor. Price controls in the Roman Republic in 
the first century B.C. resulted in farmers no longer bringing food from the 
countryside to the city. In 301 A.D., during the Roman Empire, the Emperor 
Diocletian issued a sweeping edict controlling the price of foodstuffs, clothing, 
and other goods, with the usual remedy of capital punishment for violators. 
The result was that far fewer goods were brought to market, and the prices 
of those that did arrive were often, precisely because of the effect of the 
controls, much higher than the price permitted by law.
During and after the Black Death in England, which killed perhaps a third of 
that country’s population, labor shortages increased competition for workers 
and hence their wages, and this time it was employers rather than consumers 
who were upset with the news prices were delivering, leading the Crown to 
impose a law against “the malice of laborers,” which controlled their wages 
and prevented them from leaving employment. Laborers unsurprisingly hated 
the measures and went from town to town looking for the highest wages they 
could get, disrupting production. This was ultimately followed by an uprising 
known as Wat Tyler’s Rebellion, in which a peasant army of 50,000 to 100,000 
people marched into London and killed, among many others, the Archbishop 
of Canterbury and the uncle of King Richard II. Although the proximate cause 
was a tax introduced shortly before by the King, earlier restrictions on labor 
may have had much to do with the economic collapse that made the tax 
necessary. In any event, as usual, the wage control failed to have its desired 
effect of allowing people to magically acquire more of what they wanted  
(in this case, the services of labor) at a lower price. Limits on wages and prices 
during the French Revolution generated hoarding by merchants for personal

use or for the (deadweight-cost–generating) black market, and so too did 
price controls on oil and gasoline in the United States in the 1970s fail to have 
their intended effect.
Prices are telling us things. An action that a person or group of people or 
society might take is like a box, which we can open or not. Some boxes have 
nasty surprises inside—famines, crops rotting in the field, green companies 
producing things that no one wants to buy before going bankrupt and throwing 
valuable assets into the trash23)—others have wonderful contents like cars 
that get us from point A to point B in style, dream homes, food to feed our 
families, and the other products of the spontaneous order. Prices are like 
labels on these boxes, giving us a guide to what’s inside and thus whether 
these actions are actions we want to take.
Note
■
■
  Never forget that prices communicate something important to us all—they guide us 
toward, or away from, actions we might take.
When we allow prices to transmit information about the consequences of 
choices people might make, resources go to those who are willing to pay the 
most, including those who are willing to pay the most because they have the 
most money as well as those who attach intrinsically high value to the good. 
This is true for all things—housing (mobile home versus mansion or studio 
apartment), cars (10-year-old used car versus high-end SUV), food (Hamburger 
Helper and rice versus organic food), and anything else that is scarce. As we 
will see in Chapter 9, reliance on the spontaneous order and prices (the same 
thing, really) means that the quality of all goods for all people, rich and poor 
alike, rises dramatically over time. But additional benefits are that resources 
gravitate to their most valued uses, and we avoid the social waste of dead-
weight costs as well as the incentive to resort ever more to political interven-
tion to solve the problems created by the last political intervention.24
And ultimately the greatest benefit of all of letting prices run free is that we 
are given a way to accommodate as easily as possible the unending tide of 
social change that occurs in a society characterized by hard work and the 
desire to move up in the world. This is why the removal of comprehensively 
choking price controls in postwar Germany25 (imposed ironically by American 
occupation authorities lamentably ignorant of the function of prices) was a big

more affordable housing, the shortage of which was created by price controls restricting

part of the reason why the German postwar economic miracle took place, 
which completely transformed a nation devastated by bombing and invasion 
into a prosperous, peaceful society.
The lesson, and this is not the last time you will hear it, is that inefficiency—
the inability to use scarce resources for greater social value—is not a trivial 
matter. It involves entire neighborhoods that are not renovated for lack of 
incentives (many cities around the world are full of run-down buildings that 
would be renovated if only the owners could capture the value to society 
doing so), the appalling waste of time and money that could be used to do 
more socially useful things, and even the frustration of dreams for all of those 
who have grand plans for scarce resources but who find themselves unable 
to obtain them.
That fundamentally is what economics is about—the shifting of curves on a 
diagram reflects far more profound realities about allowing us to live to our 
potential by relying on markets and prices as the system for moving scarce 
resources to the best of their various competing uses.

The Economics 
of Information 
or Knowledge
We All Want to Know What You Know
What do the following have in common: the surprising difficulty of making a 
rubber band, a car warranty, the questions a car salesperson asks you shortly 
after meeting you, and the rise and fall of the Sony Corporation? Unless you 
have an unusual gift for the economics of information, you may say nothing, at 
least on first reading. But it turns out they are all implications of information 
being scarce and therefore costly. That information is costly follows immedi-
ately from the fact that it has value and requires the expenditure of resources 
to acquire. But this simple fact has powerful implications for the behavior of 
people seeking it, the behavior of people trying to take advantage of it, and 
the best way to organize society to harvest this costly but incredibly valuable 
resource.
First, a few words on the concept of information. Economists often use this 
word interchangeably with the word knowledge. I will do so as well. The two 
terms throughout this book refer to exactly the same thing. And what is that? 
It is not the conventional idea of book knowledge—for example, such things 
as Boyle’s Law (pV = k), the capital of Norway (Oslo), or the definition of 
opportunity cost (you’re on your own). In economics, information or knowl-
edge is valuable data about a particular economic environment. It is awareness of

unexploited opportunities (actually all opportunities are, by definition, unex-
ploited), of the cost of particular choices, and of tradeoffs and consequences. 
One of the most accomplished economists of the 20th century, Friedrich 
Hayek, writing in a research article written for other economists who would 
know what he meant, called it “knowledge of the particular circumstances of 
time and place.” He went on to offer the following examples:
To know of and put to use a machine not fully employed, or somebody’s 
skill which could be better utilized, or to be aware of a surplus stock 
which can be drawn upon during an interruption of supplies, is socially 
quite as useful as the knowledge of better alternative techniques. And 
the shipper who earns his living from using otherwise empty or half-
filled journeys of tramp-steamers, or the estate agent [here he means 
real-estate agent] whose whole knowledge is almost exclusively one 
of temporary opportunities, or the arbitrageur who gains from local 
differences of commodity prices, are all performing eminently useful 
functions based on special knowledge of circumstances of the fleeting 
moment not known to others.1
All of these things represent knowledge of opportunities, knowledge that 
perhaps only one or a few individuals have. Let us elaborate a little on the 
economic importance of what would happen if these little pieces of economic 
knowledge—because they were too costly to learn—went unlearned by any-
one. A machine not fully employed means that more goods could be pro-
duced if only it were. If oil supplies were interrupted because of an embargo 
or strike by workers somewhere up the line, and if millions of barrels of oil 
sat idly in storage facilities because no one knew they were there, people 
would be forced to give up perhaps very important trips because of unneces-
sarily higher prices. A steamer (or an 18-wheeler, nowadays) that goes out 
half empty every night is using almost the same amount of fuel to deliver less 
cargo than it could. If real estate agents don’t know about houses for sale that 
buyers will like at that price, people will be prevented from consummating 
mutually beneficial exchanges. Even the behavior of the arbitrageur (some-
one who buys something at a low price and sells it at a higher one) has this 
function of preventing waste, although you will have to wait until later in the 
chapter to get a thorough understanding of why. And if it seems unlikely to 
you that real estate agents would not know about such opportunities, or that 
a shipper would routinely send out trucks half full, that is testimony to the way 
we have given people proper incentives to put their knowledge to use for the 
greater gain of everyone else (for compensation, of course). That too is laid 
out later in this chapter.

Decentralized Knowledge and the

Imagine you are in an unfamiliar city—Tokyo, say—and you have a goal: to get 
to a particular place, a restaurant in a particular neighborhood—Harajuku, say. 
(The neighborhood may be obscure to you, which serves to illustrate how 
little economic actors know.) It’s a foreign city where you have no experience, 
and you don’t speak the language. If all you had to work with was a map of the 
Asian continent, it would be as if you knew nothing at all.
This problem actually bears some resemblance to that of someone trying 
to impose a particular economic vision on society. Standing in a legislative 
chamber or bureaucratic office somewhere, writing laws and rules, you do 
not actually know the trade-offs that individual decision makers face when 
they decide to use their resources in ways that are different from those you 
want to achieve through your rules. If you impose the rules anyway, bad things 
are probably going to happen—resources will be used inefficiently, there will 
be unintended (bad) consequences, and the goals that you seek to achieve 
will probably not come to pass. This task is like trying to navigate through 
Harajuku with only a map of Asia, or a crude view of Asia from a satellite 
orbiting the earth, to guide you.2
The reason for the problem of trying to guide an economy by laws rather 
than relying on individuals trading in the market has to do with the fact that 
information is scarce. No one can know everything. But lots of little pieces of 
information are known by individuals, and if we could get that information out 
to the public, then resources could be used more efficiently. And we do, in 
fact, do that in a market system. People who think they see opportunities can 
make money by exploiting them. But opportunity is simply a circumstance that 
no one else has seen—information that is possessed by the person taking the 
action, and not possessed by other people.

will be rewarded for discovering valuable opportunities are much more likely to uncover them than 
officials in government office buildings.
Examples of things that can be known locally abound, in addition to those 
Hayek uses earlier. Where is the best location for that factory? Is this the best 
use of that space in that strip mall? Should that computer have that feature or

not? Should I start my business in this town or that, manufacture my product 
in this country or that one over there? Should I change my restaurant menu 
from high cuisine to casual, or change my produce supplier? All of these things 
are costly to discover, and the farther away you are from the scene, and the 
less you personally have a stake in getting the decision right, the more your 
map looks like Asia and the less it looks like Harajuku (which is still not, 
and can’t be, an exact duplicate of the neighborhood). That some people see 
grand things that no one else can see is obvious from the great entrepre-
neurial experiments in history. John D. Rockefeller became the world’s first 
billionaire because he saw a way, even if he only saw it one step at a time as 
his business expanded, to improve upon a cumbersome, underdeveloped oil 
production and distribution system. His insights didn’t just change the way oil 
was taken out of the ground and transported, they also—by making it cheaper 
to obtain—made it rational to use oil in ways that no one had thought to 
use it before. A compelling example is the creation of plastics, themselves 
key ingredients in many modern machines and consumer goods whose uses 
­neither Rockefeller nor anyone else could have predicted at the time.
But the modern, global oil-distribution system, which is built on the founda-
tion Rockefeller laid, is an extraordinarily complicated system. Oil is extracted 
from under the ground or ocean before being transported great distances to 
large refineries, which transform the oil into products that will heat buildings, 
power vehicles, and so forth. Rockefeller saw farther than anyone in laying 
down the basics of this system, from his first days refining oil for Standard 
Oil (which would eventually become the largest company in the world) in 
Cleveland. He and his employees and partners were also visionaries in figuring 
out refining techniques that wasted less oil, and in using refining byproducts 
for such useful products as gasoline, pavement tar, petroleum jelly, and paraf-
fin. Standard Oil employed hundreds of chemists to figure out ways to refine 
more oil at lower cost and to find new uses for what came out of the refining 
process. Rockefeller also anticipated a development often credited to Henry 
Ford by paying his workers far more than market conditions suggested he 
needed to in the belief that this was the way to retain quality employees and 
prevent labor unrest, thus lowering long-run costs. The proof of the wisdom 
of this tactic was the rarity with which he faced labor unrest.3
Rockefeller was handsomely compensated to be sure for his innovation, 
becoming the world’s first billionaire and, in inflation-adjusted terms, one of 
the wealthiest people who ever lived. But this compensation was a reward 
for the value of what he thought he knew, which turned out to be true: crude 
oil—seen as a useless by-product of salt mining until a chemist at Yale saw 
how it could be chemically transformed and used to heat indoor spaces more

effectively than increasingly expensive whale oil—could be turned into heating 
oil and therefore transform the way we live. By making nighttime illumination 
affordable, it made nighttime entertainment in general and reading in the 
evening (the only part of the day when time to read was available) accessible not 
just to the wealthy, who could afford whale oil, but to all. Crude oil enabled much 
of the industrial innovation that took place after 1860, including the profoundly 
liberating technologies of the automobile4 and the modern airplane. Rockefeller 
saw farther than others, and the market—members of society, in other words, in 
their role as buyers of products made from refined oil—rewarded him for it.

  Entrepreneurs who spot huge opportunities often, if they are correct, amass huge fortunes 
to match them. And they deserve them precisely because the value of their discoveries is so high to 
the rest of us.
Even small-scale knowledge that fails to produce these revolutionary effects 
is rewarded. The company that masters a more efficient transportation route 
from point A to point B or figures out how to better transport goods by 
changing vehicle types is also able to do more for less, and this knowledge 
too is rewarded. Many of the complicated systems that characterize mod-
ern society—including those for transportation, communication, distribution, 
selling, and others too numerous to mention—were built spontaneously by 
entrepreneurs taking risks, and by sellers selling and buyers buying.
And this is where the virtues of the market come into sharpest focus. None 
of these systems, in the sense of networks of exchange, were built by a cen-
tral designer issuing orders from high. Even when, say, roads are built by the 
government, the decisions about how many and what kind of trucks to put on 
them, where they come from and go to, and what should be in them, which 
is the true essence of a transportation system, are made by risk-takers with 
skin in the game. Even Rockefeller’s Standard Oil was only one of several oil 
companies at the time, each with its own refinery network, each negotiating 
separate contracts as needed with transporters and retailers. The entire way 
that oil, and what it can become, gets from underground and into gas tanks as 
fuel and machines as lubricants and onto roads as asphalt and into appliances 
as electric power and chemically woven into plastics and into the soil as fertil-
izers to increase our ability to feed more people at lower cost—all this has 
happened because people have spied opportunities and built little pieces of 
the system. It is impossible to design anything like that in total from a central 
plan conceived on high.

Countries have tried, such as the Soviet Union from 1917 to the late 1980s, 
China from 1949 to 1980, Italy from 1922 to 1943, and Cuba from 1959 to 
the present day. All are examples of societies that believed the way to use 
resources most effectively was to plan their uses from inside the walls of a 
large government office building, giving orders that so much oil be shipped here 
and fertilizer be shipped there, so that the “waste” of competition and profit 
would not inhibit society from using scarce resources to their greatest benefit. 
But Thomas Sowell describes the phenomenon in the former Soviet Union of 
rotting fields of wheat just a short distance from an urban center with huge 
lines of people wanting to buy bread. If someone both knew these things and 
had the ability to capitalize on what he knew, by cutting wheat on time in one 
place and delivering the bread to the other, this breathtakingly large waste of 
resources would not occur. But that person did not exist among the endless 
rows of bureaucrats in faraway Moscow calculating prices and quantities and 
deciding how many workers this farm should have and how much fertilizer it 
should get. Those bureaucrats could not succeed without knowing the infor-
mation that prices communicate to profit-seeking merchants about the value 
of different uses of and sources for scarce resources.
Modern human society is a phenomenally complex thing, and its construction 
reflects the embedded knowledge that the shipping center functions best here, 
the retail store ought to be located there, strawberries should be grown on this 
land instead of wheat (or instead of putting houses on it), and a million other 
little bits of knowledge that people have discovered through trial and error. 
The more local the place, the harder the knowledge is to get from on high. It 
is common in modern cities for planning commissions to decide, using zoning 
rules and other exercises of raw power, what kinds of buildings can be built 
where, and so the members of these commissions, secure in their advanced 
training, might argue for example that cul-de-sacs encourage isolation from the 
broader community and are thus antisocial—without realizing what homebuild-
ers learned when they put their own money on the line. Homebuilders know 
that cul-de-sacs deter crime by making it difficult and risky5 for ill-intentioned 
outsiders to get into and out of the neighborhood. Similarly, controlling growth 
by limiting the types of homes that can be built limits the ability of develop-
ers to try different kinds of real estate experiments. In particular it makes 
construction of not just homes but all buildings more expensive generally, 
so that extensive land-use restrictions yield the unintended and unexpected 
consequences6 of cities that are too expensive for families to live in, such as 
San Francisco. In addition, zoning allows special interests—for example, very 
wealthy existing homeowners—to become expert in how the process works 
and then manipulate it to prevent undesirable people and the undesirable

(and cheaper) properties they would build from “ruining the neighborhood.” 
That this shuts off opportunity for people of more modest means of securing 
their dream is not in the self-interest of these current residents.
Houston, in contrast, rejects most zoning and restrictions on how landown-
ers can use their land,7 with the result that housing is among the cheapest 
in the country and business startup rates tend to be high, simply because 
people are free to look for opportunity where they find it. This lack of rules 
in lieu of reliance on self-interest means that residences are usually none-
theless surrounded by other residences and not loud bars, while loud bars 
are surrounded by other loud bars and not residences, all in defiance of the 
predictions of what should happen without zoning. Houston relies on the 
self-regulating spontaneous order, in which people looking to open a bar have 
the freedom to decide what the best place for it is, while people who seek to 
build housing developments put them where they are likely to make the most 
money selling to aspiring homeowners.
Note

  Houston’s lack of zoning and land restrictions has resulted in low housing prices and high 
rates of business formation.
When people are free to organize their resources according to the knowledge 
they possess and to seek out the goods that best meet their needs, the process 
ensures that local knowledge—what buyers want and what it costs to bring it 
to them—is harvested to the greatest extent possible. In a planned city or a 
planned economy, in contrast, there is no way to discover the costs and benefits 
of different resource uses from the central planning authority, with the result 
that tremendous waste and frustration occurs. A useful contrast to the flexible 
housing markets in Houston would be the planned housing developments in 
Chicago and St. Louis built in the 1950s and 1960s, which resulted not in the 
paradise for the poor that was envisioned but in nightmarish housing projects 
with completely unexpected problems. That’s because no one had a real incen-
tive to make money avoiding such problems or eliminating them quickly once 
they appeared. These projects eventually had to be destroyed.8
The distance of government planners from the knowledge needed to arrange 
resources intelligently (not to mention the fact that planners are often spend-
ing other people’s money rather than their own) means that much knowledge 
is lost along the way. Planners, in other words, even if they have the incentive 
to use resources for greatest social benefit (and if they are simply trying to

preserve or maintain power, that is doubtful) do not have the means to seek 
out the costly information that the pursuit of profit creates.
The Indian subsidiary of the giant consumer-products firm Unilever9 got poor 
people in India to begin washing their hands frequently, thus preventing the 
transmission of diarrheal diseases and saving many lives. They did so by hiring 
locals in pairs to go into villages and tell parents in their native language how 
hand-washing could prevent infections in their children. In so doing, their sales 
of hygiene products, and hence their profits, increased. The effective market-
ing strategy—it is better to say the discovery, at some cost, of knowledge about 
an effective marketing strategy—was driven by their desire to make money.10
This is the spontaneous order in action: the adaptation of resource uses and 
behavior to local circumstances. It determines how many Chinese restaurants 
a city will have—Tupelo, Mississippi, has a few, but not as many as Jacksonville, 
Florida, which has fewer than Los Angeles. How did this get decided? It did not, 
in the sense of a formal decision. Instead, people seek out locations for Chinese 
restaurants and are more likely to build them when they discover a place where 
the benefits are likely to exceed the costs. Naturally, bigger cities have a larger 
number of restaurants (and a wider variety, probably because of greater variety 
of population and hence greater variety in tastes), and indeed a larger variety of 
food of all sorts. This seems obvious, but has happened without a central plan.
Food is not ordered by any central authority, yet grocery stores in big cities 
and small towns are chock full of food of every variety. How did it get there? 
People who grow crops negotiated with people who ship them to grocery 
stores, and the stores are put in places where the people who own them 
expect to make the most money, and those places in turn are the locations 
that are the most convenient for the greatest number of shoppers. Such ques-
tions as “What kind of food should we sell, and where should we sell it?” get 
answered through the spontaneous order. Its power is seldom appreciated, 
but it is vital to providing the sustenance of life and to allowing people to 
adjust to change in pursuit of their interests.
To take another example, people move to San Jose to pursue their high-tech 
dreams, in part because the people with the necessary skill and experience 
(not just in design, but in related things like financing startups) are more likely 
to be found there. By taking advantage not just of what they know but what 
other people know in moving to places where high tech is well entrenched, 
people are able to acquire the necessary resources and information at lower 
cost. This phenomenon was unplanned and unpredictable, yet it happened, 
despite—or rather, because of—the spontaneous order. Over several decades 
 9Unilever’s brands include Vaseline and Dove soap among many others.
10The story of Unilever in India is told in C.K. Prahalad, The Fortune at the Bottom of the 
Pyramid: Eradicating Poverty Through Profits (New York: Pearson Prentice Hall, 2008).

San Jose has metamorphosed from a sleepy town built on tourism and agricul-
ture into the center of the high-technology capital of the world, Silicon Valley. 
And this is not just a phenomenon for wealthy countries. The traditional trad-
ing markets in developing countries are also full of people who have figured 
out how to buy products efficiently and where to sell them. Trading markets 
with many vendors selling many kinds of goods, like the traditional Arab souk, 
economize on the costs of searching for things to buy, just as Walmart or 
other superstores do in the U.S. Again, knowledge of how best to do things is 
harvested by reliance on self-interest, for the benefit of all.
The contrast can be seen by comparing two kinds of “ecosystems,” not literal 
ones but metaphorical ones. One is used by people every day—it is the eco-
system of the smartphone, in which companies that design the phones and 
their operating systems (like the iPhone and Android interfaces) choose to 
rely on third-party app designers to decide what the phone will be able to do. 
App designers see what they think is an unmet desire and design software to 
satisfy it. It is not, in other words, Apple or Samsung that decides most of what 
the phone will be able to do. It is instead software writers who market their 
wares to consumers through the system set up by Samsung and Apple, some 
with great success,11 others not so much.12
On the other hand, consider the “ecosystem” described and depicted in this 
essay13 by the writer Howard Silverman. In it, the author confidently lists a 
series of jobs he views as clearly important for the economy of the future, 
including (for the area in which he lives, the Pacific Northwest) “feller buncher 
operators, specializing in individual tree harvest, and fisheries trust managers, 
enabling community driven marine stewardship in prosperous coastal areas.”14 
(To get the full sense of how detailed Mr. Silverman’s blueprint for our future 
is, look at the picture at the link.)
Are those likely to be the important jobs of the future? The only sensible 
answer is, “Who knows?” What will be required in the future is largely 
unknowable, because human possibilities are limitless, and it is almost impos-
sible to acquire the necessary information now about what experiments will 
even be tried, let alone succeed, in the future. Thus, the trade-off among dif-
ferent human desires—what we must give up if resources are to be used this 
way—is also impossible to know. Rather, the future must be discovered. In the 
drawing for the article, it appears that there is a place for everything, or at 
least everything that passes Mr. Silverman’s personal test of what is essential.

But its flaw lies precisely in the belief that the future is a thing certain, a target 
that we will inevitably reach.
Mr. Silverman’s essay in some sense is harmless, because he does not assert that 
this is how the future must be, by the application of laws and taxes if necessary, but 
it betrays the planner’s fallacy—the belief that the planner, in moving resources 
by the stroke of his pen, has enough knowledge to know the consequences of his 
decision. When government is fooled by its ignorance of its limits, things usually 
turn out differently from what was predicted, as when solar energy companies, 
flush with taxpayer subsidies because everyone knows solar is the energy of the 
future, are unable to sell their products and then go bankrupt, or when compa-
nies that received lavish governments subsidies are unable to profitably produce 
vehicle fuel made from coal, oil shale, and other unconventional sources. In the 
latter case, over $1 billion of taxpayer money was spent on the government 
Synthetic Fuels Corporation from 1980 until it was eliminated in 1985. Needless 
to say, most people who drive do so in gasoline-powered cars to this day.

  Society is far too complex, and the future too unknowable, for anyone to make predictions 
that are more than mere wish lists or guesses about what may come about.
And government economic planning—the reliance on the force of law to order 
people to use resources in particular ways to achieve social goals instead of the 
decentralized competitive process of the spontaneous order—far more often 
than not generates these kinds of problems. When he was Vice President, Al 
Gore analogized government to a computer and made these observations in 
an interview with the magazine Red Herring:
Just as you saw the progressive switch from central processing units 
to massively parallel supercomputing, our democratic system made it 
possible for the average citizen to participate in the decision-making of 
this nation by processing the decision-making directly relevant to him or 
her in an individual congressional district or state. Then, in the process 
of biennial or quadrennial elections, our process harvests the sum total 
of those decisions and uses it as a basis for guiding the nation.
Central processing refers to computers that operate independently, with one 
core processor doing all the calculations in sequence. In traditional computing 
architecture, the only way to get the computer to do more work is to make 
the processor more powerful. In parallel computing, roughly speaking, comput-
ing is instead speeded up by dividing a big calculation problem into smaller  
sub-problems and farming each one out to a separate processor. One computer, 

Reasonably Simple Economics
71
in other words, has multiple processors, and only at the end is the task completed 
at the highest processor (Wikipedia has a description of the technology.)15
So what the vice president is saying is that state governments and individual 
congressmen harvest information necessary for good decision making from 
individual constituents, who tell them about problems that need to be solved. 
This knowledge is then passed up the chain to Congress, which is able to use 
all the information collected to do what is best for the nation.16 But informa-
tion is not like that—it’s not something harvested by a central authority, like 
a giant field of wheat being cut by agricultural machines. Information is pos-
sessed by individuals, and as it is passed up the political line from citizen to 
city councilman to state senator to Congressman to legislation, some of it is 
lost at every stop along the way. It is like electricity going through a substance 
that does not conduct electricity very well; much is lost along the way, so that 
by the time the state of California, for example, is deciding17 how small houses 
should be and where they should be built, other unexpected problems arise. 
We saw how regulating land use ends up making home ownership for young 
families nearly impossible.
The same phenomenon was on display in the decision in the 1990s and 2000s 
by politicians of both parties to second-guess the decisions of real estate lend-
ers as to who should and shouldn’t get a home loan. The second-guessing was 
on the grounds that the percentage of people owning homes was actually not 
the best result, even though each lender and home buyer was interacting in 
the marketplace based on what he believed about the desirability of particu-
lar houses and the credit-worthiness of particular borrowers. Instead, home 
ownership was too low by some politician’s arbitrary standard. (Should 60% of 
Americans own their own homes? 30%? 90%? Does anyone know?) Pressure 
was placed on lenders to relax their lending standards (with these standards 
sometimes criticized as racially discriminatory) to “allow” (as if there were 
some unnatural barrier having nothing to do with risk or opportunity cost) 
more Americans to buy homes.
Standards were relaxed, home lending went up, and home ownership for 
Americans reached a historic high in the middle part of the decade of the 
2000s. Only later did those chickens come home to roost, when many of 
these borrowers proved—just as lenders had predicted when they had origi-
nally refused to make those loans—unable to make their payments, which 
contributed to the financial crash of 2007–8. The best evidence for the vir-
tues of letting people make money off what they know is that the real estate 
market was functioning well prior to the second-guessing of its results by

Menand. See Louis Menand, “After Elvis,” The New Yorker (October 26, 1998).

bureaucrats, precisely because people lending their own money had incentives 
to try to make good loans and avoid bad ones. Only when lending below some 
arbitrary target set by bureaucrats became a potentially criminal matter were 
excessive risks taken.18
The bottom line is that information is simply too widely distributed for govern-
ments to have much wisdom about how to use scarce resources. Even events 
that are relatively easy to take precautions against in the abstract nonetheless 
happen, as anyone who has ever spilled his drink that he arrogantly set near 
his notes or laptop, secure in his “knowledge” that nothing can go wrong, can 
attest. Some of the difficulty in the idea of relying on central authorities to guide 
resource use can be had from a simple thought experiment, carried out by the 
author Virginia Postrel.19 A single deck of cards has 52 elements. How many dif-
ferent card orderings are there? The answer is just less than 1068, a number that 
is meaningless in the abstract.20 But to get some sense of how big it is, note that 
it is far more than the estimated number of seconds since the Big Bang, more 
than the estimated number of molecules in the Milky Way galaxy. And yet that is 
the number of ways to combine a mere 52 objects. How many ways are there to 
combine all the available scarce resources with competing uses in an economy? 
In the answer to that question lies the essence of the planner’s fallacy.
The Importance of Learning from Mistakes
But the alert reader may well object at this point that I have cherry-picked 
my examples. Rockefeller and smartphones and a historically well-functioning 
home-loan market are examples of success generated by relying on the spon-
taneous order to harvest and make use of socially valuable knowledge. Are 
there not many examples of failure as well? Indeed there are, but in failure too 
lies an important function of the spontaneous order.
18It should be noted that many place the blame for the housing disaster on progressively 
easier lending standards imposed by mortgage lenders at the time, including pressure 
on sales personnel to increase volume regardless of the risks. While certainly true as 
a proximate cause, this argument however raises more questions than it answers. Why 
did standards suddenly depart so much from historical norms? What were the likely 
consequences of engaging in riskier lending, and who would bear them—the people who 
made the decisions, the people who borrowed the money, taxpayers, or someone else? 
All we can say in terms of good rules for lending is that people who lend money should 
have the proper incentives to make good loans and avoid bad ones.
19Virginia Postrel, The Future and Its Enemies: The Growing Conflict Over Creativity, Enterprise, 
and Progress (New York: The Free Press, 1999).
20The calculation comes from noting that there are 52 possibilities for the first card.  
There are 51 cards left that can be laid on each of those 52 cards, and for each of those 
52 × 51 combinations there are 50 possibilities for the third card, and so on. The total 
number of possibilities is 52 × 51 × 50 … × 2 × 1, which is about 8.07 × 1067.

Businesses fail all the time. What then happens? The resources they were using 
are released to earn their opportunity cost in some other use. When a dry-
cleaner closes, the storefront after the passage of some amount of time goes 
to a restaurant or an office-supply store, workers must find other work, the 
paper clips the dry cleaner would have used in his back office must be sold to 
someone else to use in some other back office, etc. If the business owner had 
known this was going to be the result, he would not have claimed the resources 
to begin with. Thus, even in the private sector, knowledge is very far from perfect. 
Business owners take risks, workers expect their careers to have a certain tra-
jectory, and college students predict that their course of study will have certain 
results in the labor market. But life throws us curveballs—what we thought at a 
particular time turns out not to be what is so. Indeed, inherent in the word risk 
or expect is the idea that things can turn out differently than what we planned. 
This is just another way of saying that knowledge is costly and that the supply 
curve of knowledge is, like all others, positively sloping, so that at some point it 
becomes inefficient to try to acquire more before we act.
Note
■
■
  When a business fails, the resources it employed are then released and can be used more 
profitably elsewhere.
And this is the source of economic correction: businesses close at least as 
often as they open, companies introduce products that bomb in the market-
place, people make investments in real estate or stocks and find that they 
go bad. Consider the case of a small business that fails quickly—a common 
occurrence. No one would purposely set out to engage in a failed economic 
activity, so it must be that the business expected something to happen that 
did not. In other words, it possessed information that was either insufficient 
or incorrect—it misjudged the number of people willing to buy that product, 
underestimated the cost of obtaining resources or its own time costs, or failed 
to anticipate changes in population, technology, local economic circumstances, 
or something else.
What, economically, does it mean that the business failed? It means that the 
revenue it earned from selling this particular mix of things to consumers was 
insufficient to allow it to retain all its resources (the owners of which must 
be paid compensation at least as high as the resources’ opportunity costs). 
But this is what we want to happen—if resources used this way cannot earn 
their opportunity cost, society is better served by releasing them from this 
use. Failed economic experiments also yield knowledge—the knowledge of 
what not to do.
And it is not just businesses that fail shortly after their creation that can be 
damaged by faulty information. Companies that have long histories of success 
can fail to adapt to social change and pay the price. The Sony Corporation, 

Chapter 4 | The Economics of Information or Knowledge
74
mentioned at the beginning of the chapter, was once seen as the most innova-
tive company in the world when it rode inventions like the Walkman, which 
made music portable for the first time by allowing people to take cassettes 
in little cases with them and listen to the music privately on headphones, to 
great commercial success. But it largely missed the boat when the preferred 
style of storing music switched from cassettes to digital files. At the same 
time, the television sets and computers that allowed Sony to reap huge profits 
in the 1980s and 1990s became standardized devices that many manufacturers 
could make, often in China, at less cost. As I write this, Sony, which sparked 
paranoid fears of a Japanese takeover of the American economy in 1989 when 
it bought Columbia Pictures Entertainment,21 the producer of such legendary 
films as Mr. Smith Goes to Washington and On the Waterfront, has lost money for 
four years running. Sony has lost money both because it cannot make money 
on hardware anymore and because the movies it makes are less important as 
an entertainment option because of the rise of the Internet.
A company can even go from right to wrong to right again. The Apple 
Corporation was a star in the early years of the personal computer, but by the 
mid-1990s was losing money because of failed ventures such as its Newton 
personal digital assistant, as well as poor marketing and technology decisions 
regarding its desktop computers. And yet by 2012 it had—via its iPhone, 
iPad, and similar products, as well as an array of easy-to-use and powerful 
software—become perhaps the most successful and influential technology 
company in the world. The late Steve Jobs, Apple’s long-time chief executive, 
was credited in particular (like John D. Rockefeller) with a gift for knowing 
what it was that consumers wanted out of technology, even if they did not 
know it themselves yet. And yet by early 2013 (after Jobs had died) it had had 
a series of disappointing product launches, its stock had fallen dramatically, and 
its ability to remain at the cutting edge was increasingly questioned.
Nothing, including the value of knowledge previously exploited, lasts forever. 
Apple was able to recover from its troubles in the early 1990s because of 
the ingenuity of those who ran it and worked for it, but there are no guar-
antees if it is unable to best predict which uses of the resources it controls 
create the most value for its customers. Even mighty Google, which rose to 
prominence and made its founders and many lower-level employees phenom-
enally wealthy by creating a better method of Internet search, now faces new 
competition22 from people reimagining Internet search as built around one’s 
Facebook friends or vocal requests asked of one’s smartphone, rather than 
typing text into a search engine. And it is an interesting experiment to look

which was later made into a movie.

at changes in the Fortune 500, an annual ranking by Fortune magazine of the 
largest corporations in the U.S. (ranked by annual sales). Of the companies on 
the list in 1970, the Economist magazine reports, one-third were gone (through 
failure, merger, or acquisition) by 1983—only 13 years later. To take a par-
ticular case, Eastman Kodak, the maker of cameras and film, was number 43 
in the first full list in 1955, rose as high as number 18 in 1980–1990, and went 
bankrupt in 2012.

Other companies will come along with cheaper and/or better substitutes for the wares and services 
they sell so profitably now.
Competition
Why do activities succeed or not in the marketplace? In each case, whether 
we are talking about a new business or long-standing one, competition is the 
playing field, and profits are the scoreboard, for economic success and failure. 
Competition between restaurants, between different ways of organizing a busi-
ness, between using workers with and without college degrees to do particular 
kinds of work, between imported and domestic cars, between public schools, 
private schools, and homeschooling are all ways of discerning what does more 
for society at lower cost. Because knowledge is so decentralized, because pre-
dicting the future is so hard, the best way to achieve as much social progress as 
possible is to have as much competition as possible. Those competitive experi-
ments that lose money will end, as they should, and those experiments that are 
able to make money will continue, as they should. Indeed, those experiments 
that make the most money are those where knowledge has proven most valu-
able. Competition among products or companies is really competition among ideas, 
among different ways of deploying scarce resources to meet human needs.
A humble example serves to illustrate what is going on. Imagine a random 
resident of town X who discovers that he can buy jam for $2.00 a jar while 
people 30 miles away in town Y, where people are insular and have high costs 
of living, pay $3.00 a jar for it.23 (As a reminder, people who discover and 
capitalize on such price differences for the same good in different places are 
called arbitrageurs, and Hayek speaks of them in the quote earlier.) The $1.00 
difference (minus whatever it costs him to get jam from stores in X to the 
hands of buyers in Y) represents the value to society of this knowledge. 
23I owe this example to Walter Block, Defending the Undefendable (Auburn, Alabama: 
Ludwig von Mises Institute, 2008).

Chapter 4 | The Economics of Information or Knowledge
76
If people in Y were actually paying $5.00 a jar, it would be even more useful to 
society to save them money by seizing the opportunity to exploit this differ-
ence. Of course, the seller wants to charge as close to the price that prevails 
in Y as possible ($2.99 in the first case, $4.99 in the second). But that is the 
value of his knowledge, and so as the first to discover it he should benefit from 
it. The good news is that others will soon see him exploiting the opportunity 
and do the same—not just by charging a lower price, although that will be 
one method of competition, but also by offering a wider range of goods or 
more convenient purchasing options and locations. Eventually the benefits 
will spread widely among consumers as well, and indeed if more products are 
offered in better ways, the social gains will be even greater than envisioned by 
the first person who brought jam from X to Y.
But all competition is in some sense like this—discovering and exploiting 
opportunities to trade. Many American cities now have food trucks—large 
motor coaches out of which food is served, especially at lunchtime. There is 
nothing new about using vehicles to bring food to the diner instead of making 
the diner come to the food, of course; the American West had its chuck wag-
ons, and armies their mobile canteens. In the 1980s and 1990s in Los Angeles, 
people discovered that they could make money parking these trucks near 
construction sites, which exploded in number during the real-estate boom 
of the 2000s. But in recent years truck owners have begun sending them to 
a wider variety of places, and some of these food trucks have developed cult 
followings, with owners using Twitter to announce where they will be. In each 
case, customers get something they didn’t have before, and truck owners 
make money because they learned about this unfilled desire.
Food truck success in turn has inspired other types of information-based 
gambles. Companies have emerged spontaneously to lease trucks to chefs and 
handle the chores of ordering supplies, making it easier for would-be truck 
chefs to enter the business by lowering costs and allowing cooks to specialize 
in what they do best—cooking. More substantially, Rockefeller made millions 
of people he never met aware of the ways in which oil—when incorporated 
into gasoline, kerosene, and later jet fuel and plastics—could enable them to 
do new things (from throwing a Frisbee to being able to read at night, to fly-
ing around the world at much lower cost) that they could not do before. His 
compensation reflected the value of the possibilities that, by building his vast 
network to drill for, refine, and distribute oil, he informed society of.

development of products and services to support them (like custom truck makers and food brokers 
who handle purchases).

But not everything pans out. Of course, some of those food trucks and truck-
leasing companies fail, and they are those whose opportunities were revealed to 
be not sufficiently valuable relative to cost. The Segway scooter, which accord-
ing to breathless media coverage at the time it came out was supposed to 
change the way we get around, has proven far too expensive for most uses, and 
therefore not revolutionary in the way (to go far back in history) the cart (still 
used today), the wheeled cycle, the vehicle powered by the internal combustion 
engine, or the airplane has been. The Apple Newton, the Nintendo Virtual Boy,24 
and the Ford Edsel were examples of new opportunities consumers elected to 
take a pass on, so society learned not to try mistakes like those again. Indeed, in 
the case of the Virtual Boy gaming platform, repeated price drops by Nintendo 
failed to find a point at which consumers thought this new opportunity worth 
it. Even Rockefeller would have been unknown to later generations had he not 
continuously innovated, creating new products such as paints and varnishes, 
investing heavily in speculative Ohio oil fields after oil in Pennsylvania—where 
the modern oil industry was born—became too costly to extract, creating new 
techniques to purify the high-sulfur oil found in Ohio, discovering new people 
to sell to in India and China, and on and on. Had he not done so, he would have 
suffered the same fate as our hypothetical jam seller would once the price of 
jam in Y had come down to just cents over $2.00. Instead, his continuous stream 
of economically useful discoveries changed the world. Competition is a merciless 
scorekeeper, but unlike every political process for allocating scarce resources 
ever conceived, it is completely objective: make enough money to cover your 
costs, and you get to keep playing. Those who succeed by its rules are those 
who discover and capitalize on the most useful information. 
Profit as Markup
There is a commonly held contrary view of profit—not as the reward for dis-
covering something valuable about how to use scarce resources, but as useless 
surplus piled up by overcharging for goods and then distributing them without 
rhyme or reason or “social justice” to people who don’t need or deserve them. 
But the approach I’m describing suggests a different idea—of profit as the mea-
sure of the best use of scarce resources. Criticisms of profitable businesses are 
ubiquitous, and the larger and more profitable they are, the louder these criti-
cisms often are. But consider a nonprofit institution—the university. For decades, 
college tuition in the U.S. has soared much faster than the rate of inflation, and 
this rise in the cost of procuring a college education is seen as a major social 
problem. But most colleges are nonprofit associations! They are legally bound to 
not seek to maximize the excess of revenues over costs, so the revenue that the 
university earns, much of it from students, need not be wasted as profit.

Chapter 4 | The Economics of Information or Knowledge
78
Profit can be increased by two ways: revenues can go up (for example, via higher 
tuition without a correspondingly large drop in enrollment) or costs can go 
down. The absence of profit-seeking means there is little incentive to get costs 
down. Universities have many expenditures that might seem peculiar to some-
one trying to maximize profits. They are laden more and more by fully staffed 
administrators who are in charge of arguably extraneous (in the sense that 
what is invested in may not be justified by what is gained) activities such as “civic 
engagement,” particular conceptions of “diversity, “athletics, and so on. (Note: 
the argument is not that such activities have zero benefits, just that their benefits 
may not justify their costs.) This—along with granting low teaching responsibili-
ties to many professors, often those with the highest salaries, ironically—means 
that other teachers have to be hired to teach the courses these professors 
would otherwise teach.25 These sorts of practices drive up costs.
These are not the only reasons for higher costs—extensive government 
subsidy of college education means that universities are incented to build 
more campuses and buy more frills. But the lack of the desire to pursue 
profit means no one has the incentive to discover what for students would 
be socially useful knowledge—how to provide more education at less cost. 
Partly due to the revolutionary technology of the Internet, for-profit alterna-
tives are increasingly rising to challenge the old higher-education model. Some 
of them—offering “badges” for completing a curriculum or creating “mas-
sive open online courses”—offer tremendous potential. On the other hand, 
some for-profit colleges have revenue that comes mostly from students who 
take out student loans to afford the tuition. The money flows directly to the 
colleges (and especially to those who run them in the form of high salaries), 
while the students who acquire education that turns out to be of little value 
are, unlike most other debtors, currently unable to use bankruptcy law to 
discharge their debt burdens. What should happen is that competition should 
force such programs to offer more useful courses. But the model in which 
benefits accrue right now to firms while the costs are borne later only by 
borrowers (and taxpayers) may prove to be a deficient one, and if so we are 
likely to discover that only after a great deal of political finger-pointing, pre-
cisely because higher education is so extensively political.26 The contrast with 
the hyper-efficient “supply chains” of for-profit corporations—which enable 
things like shipping produce in giant ships and planes around the world in a 
matter of days so that it arrives to stores fresh, and to distribute manufacturing 
25It is instructive that some university professors refer to their “teaching load,” suggesting that 
for them teaching is to some degree adistraction from other activities, for example research.
26The new communications technology is (I, with my very incomplete information, will 
speculate) likely to dramatically change the nature of higher education. In the course of 
this process, many mistakes will be made and many lessons will be learned. A theme of 
this chapter is that this process should be allowed to unfold as quickly as buyers and 
sellers want to make it unfold.

activities around the world at astonishingly low cost, and in which businesses 
are rewarded only for providing things that consumers want and are willing to 
pay their own money for—is conspicuous.
The Market as What We Know Together 
Because competition is a way of rewarding useful knowledge and punishing 
false (mistaken is perhaps a better word) information, market competition is a 
way of amassing knowledge. There is an idea known as the wisdom of crowds 
which essentially means that many people acting independently to solve a 
problem will create a solution that is much better than the solution cre-
ated by one person, even if that person is very intelligent or an “expert.” The 
Chronicle of Higher Education published a fascinating account27 on scientists try-
ing to figure out how molecules of RNA in the body work by coming up with 
designs for molecules that will actually work in nature. Historically, one or a 
few highly trained scientists have developed programs that allow computers 
to try to build such models, with limited success. Now, scientists at Stanford 
farm this work out to thousands of gamers, each of whom comes up with his 
own design, with the players then collectively deciding which models among 
those they have created are best. The models produced considerably outper-
form those created by traditional methods.
Here we actually have a pretty good facsimile of the market process. There 
is decentralized knowledge (each player’s idea), there is competition (to win 
the game), and there is a way of measuring the value of the result (whether it 
does or doesn’t satisfy the scientists’ goals). What is more, there is also con-
tinuous improvement as gamers learn from the results of previous rounds of 
the game how to make better designs, which is just like innovation that occurs 
in a market setting from watching both the successes and failures of others. 
The collective outperforms its most knowledgeable individual member (the 
scientist in charge). Note that the reason the process works is not because all 
participants are trying to solve a common problem per se, but because they 
are competing to solve it through a system that makes their private knowledge 
public and relies on incentives (the desire of gamers to win). This “market” 
has harvested all the knowledge available in this community at any moment in 
time about how to solve this problem. 
It is perhaps not surprising that markets incorporate information on a mas-
sive scale. When the space shuttle Challenger exploded on January 29, 1986, 
the cause of the disaster was a complete mystery. An investigation that took 
months to play out eventually discovered that a part called an O-ring had failed, 
27http://chronicle.com/blogs/wiredcampus/the-public-playing-a-molecule-
building-game-outperforms-scientists/32835

Chapter 4 | The Economics of Information or Knowledge
80
causing fuel to leak into a place where it wasn’t supposed to be, causing in turn 
a catastrophic ignition. But on the day of the explosion itself, this was com-
pletely unknown. There were four primary contractors on the space-shuttle 
program—Morton Thiokol, Lockheed, Martin Marietta, and Rockwell—and 
presumably the failure would be ultimately laid at the feet of just one of them. 
Yet on the day of the crash the stock of Morton Thiokol—the company that 
made the O-ring—fell more than 11.86%—a large one-day move—while 
none of the other three companies saw their stock fall more than 3.25%. 
The market collectively seemed to know that it was Morton Thiokol’s fault. 
Even though presumably there was probably not a single trader who could 
explain in detail how the shuttle worked, traders made it their business to 
follow Morton Thiokol and other companies, to observe general and specific 
strengths and weaknesses of their quality control, management, and so on, and 
each trader who knew each little thing acted on it that day, with the collective 
result that the market partially anticipated the result of the federal investiga-
tive commission, with its exhaustive investigation, by months. The decentral-
ized information used in each stock trade affected stock prices (each person 
who thought Morton Thiokol had many problems, for example, sold it and 
generated downward pressure on prices), and those prices assimilated all that 
information to produce the final result in the change in market value, on that 
day, of the company that ultimately proved to be at fault.
Note

■
  The market seemed to know, before any official investigation, that Morton Thiokol had a 
major part in the Challenger disaster.
Of course, that could just be random chance; there were only four contractors, 
and prices would go on to fluctuate in the months before the commission made 
its judgment. But another striking example comes from World War II. In his book 
Wealth, War and Wisdom (Wiley, 2009), Barton Briggs investigates, among other 
things, the ups and downs of the stock market in the U.S. and Great Britain dur-
ing World War II. Militarily, according to much contemporaneous press cover-
age, the most critical part of the European war was the Battle of Britain in the 
fall of 1940, when the Nazis, having defeated France and pushed British forces 
out of Western Europe, were bombing Britain continuously to gain control of 
the air and degrade British warmaking capacity in preparation for an invasion 
of the islands. Although Hitler would go on to conquer vast new territories 
in Eastern Europe, Greece, and the Soviet Union and obtain control over new 
military forces in Hungary, Romania, and Bulgaria in 1941, one could argue that 
the failure to invade Britain was the decisive moment for that country. However, 
press coverage continued to express uncertainty about whether Hitler could 
be defeated until the epic battle of Stalingrad, which ended with Axis defeat 
amid at least half a million casualties in February 1943. At that point the method, 
if not the timeline or ultimate cost, of victory could be seen by many.

Reasonably Simple Economics
81
But the financial markets did not see it that way. According to Biggs’s analysis, 
the London stock exchange fell almost 40 percent between 1937 and early 
1940, putting the lie to the hoary cliché that “war is good for business,” but 
began to rise after the British saved many of their soldiers in France with their 
historic evacuation at Dunkirk. In the eyes of the public and British political 
leaders, the fall of France was the darkest hour yet, as well as a harbinger of 
darker times yet to come, in the form of an invasion of Britain. And yet in 
the eyes of investors, the saving of so many soldiers seems to have marked a 
turning point, meaning that the market collectively seems to have been a bet-
ter gauge of the future than popular opinion. By the time of Hitler’s defeat at 
Stalingrad, the market had more than doubled.
It was the same story, with slightly different details, in the U.S. After the attack 
on Pearl Harbor, Japan quickly expelled British, Australian, and Dutch forces 
from Malaysia, captured the mighty British military base at Singapore, then cap-
tured Burma and Indonesia, and by the spring of 1942 was conducting bombing 
raids on Australia and India. In the naval battle between the U.S. and Japan in 
the Coral Sea in early May 1942, Japan was able to inflict more damage on U.S. 
naval power than the inverse, but that marked the low-water mark of the mar-
ket, which began a sustained rise through the end of the war, even before the 
Battle of Midway in early June 1942, which was decisively won by the U.S. Navy 
and was seen only in hindsight as the turning point in the Pacific war.
Financial markets—which are constantly incorporating the individual knowl-
edge of each investor trying to trade on that knowledge for profit—are now 
increasingly used to try to predict events, and it is now widely accepted that 
the stock market begins to fall or recover before the broader economy does. 
The trouble is, of course, that at any time it is not clear whether the current 
fall is short or long term, which is why investing is so hard. That the market 
represents all of what is known doesn’t mean it knows everything, and no 
single individual, as we have seen, is likely to know more than what everyone 
collectively knows.
Monopoly and Its Meaning, or Lack Thereof
People think they know things; sometimes what they think they know is right, 
and sometimes it is not. If competition rewards that which turns out to be 
true and punishes that which turns out to be false, then the first person to dis-
cover something of immense social value—the first person to inform others 
of a possibility in trade that didn't exist before—ought to make a lot of money. 
This is John D. Rockefeller’s story. But not all new discoveries are the same. 
Some are easy to duplicate, whereas others depend on resources so rare that 
it is extremely difficult for other people to horn in on the extraordinarily high 
returns being earned.

Chapter 4 | The Economics of Information or Knowledge
82
It is critically important to understand this when thinking about competi-
tion and its absence. Most people are familiar with the word monopoly, which 
supposedly describes the opposite of competition. But monopoly is actually a 
word without any economic content, a word that does not map to any real 
economic phenomenon. The word comes from Greek, mon (“one”) and poˉlein 
(“seller”). But all producers of all goods face competition, because no demand 
curves are perfectly inelastic. Name any seller you like that you consider to 
be a monopoly, and it will turn out to face competition. Microsoft sells the 
Windows operating system, but ultimately this is just a way to manage infor-
mation. People can use personal computers running on different operating 
systems such as Apple’s Mac OS or Linux, they can use cell phones and tablets 
and forgo the need for a personal computer entirely, or they can use diction-
aries, encyclopedias, and phonebooks. In each case they give up some things 
(convenience, perhaps) and get others (the use of the money saved in not buy-
ing a Windows machine), so that in each case we have an imperfect substitute 
for what Microsoft is selling.
John D. Rockefeller’s Standard Oil? Rockefeller himself always noted that they 
always had competitors, always would, and indeed needed them. People had 
lived without heating oil before Rockefeller and somehow managed to live 
without petroleum jelly and varnish, and could easily do so again if Rockefeller's 
asking price were too high. The local modern electric utility? In some places, 
multiple companies offer electric power services, and even where they don’t, 
one can still live off the grid by installing solar panels so as to minimize or 
eliminate one’s use of the utility’s electricity—or indeed live without electric-
ity, as people did for most of human history. Of course, in some cases, the 
substitutes are not very good, but they are substitutes just the same.
From one point of view, no one is a monopolist, because all producers must 
deal with other producers who are selling goods that compete with what they 
sell. From the other point of view, everyone is a monopolist. Someone who 
owns a gasoline station that sells gasoline with the brand name BP may have to 
share that intersection with gas stations on two other corners, but his prod-
uct is still distinct. It may allow people to accumulate points to be used by gas 
or junk food via a company-issued card, it may have a car wash whereas the 
other two do not, it may have a different mix of food in the market attached 
to it, and it may even require a right instead of a left turn, saving a tiny bit of 
driving time. These differences are not great, but they are differences, and in 
practical terms we have the opposite phenomenon from that in the previous 
paragraph—here substitutes are extremely close, but they are not perfect. So 
all people, because they sell unique products, are monopolists. What we learn 
from this is that the word monopoly is not helpful, and it depends on how we 
arbitrarily define the product. Either everyone is a monopolist, or no one is.

Reasonably Simple Economics

  Nobody really has a monopoly, because even if there are not direct competitors to your 
product or service, there are substitutes that might satisfy the same desires, so that people can 
always choose to go without your particular product. Alternatively, everybody has a monopoly, 
because each product is distinct.
From now on we will jettison the term monopoly. However, we have already 
learned, in Chapter 2, an idea to describe the degree of competition that is 
more concrete: elasticity of demand. We can speak of some producers—the 
makers of life-saving medicine subject to patent protection, the local electric 
utility—as having very inelastic demand. Products for which the substitutes 
are few and poor have inelastic demand. On the other hand, people selling 
other products—such as farmers growing corn that is essentially identical to 
the corn sold by thousands of other farmers—face extremely elastic demand. 
Generally, the more elastically one’s product is demanded, the easier it is for 
one’s profits to be dissipated by the entry of competing producers.
Consider first our jam vendor from earlier. He has discovered a socially valu-
able piece of knowledge—that residents of Y are paying a price for jars of 
jam that is one dollar higher than the price he can purchase them for in X. 
He begins buying them in X, selling them in Y at $2.99 a box, and thus earns 
a huge markup per jar sold. However, we must confess that although it took 
some work to discover this activity, and society is better off for our vendor 
having done so, the work is not excessively complicated. So what would prob-
ably happen is that other people would observe his cart on the streets of Y or 
observe him buying jam in large amounts in X, infer what is going on, and start 
trying to get some of that action themselves. They would do that by buying 
their own jam in X and selling them in Y at a lower price than $2.99. As more 
people are buying jam in X, they will drive up the price there. (The supply 
curve of jam in X is positively sloped after all, so higher demand for buying 
that jam against that supply curve will cause price to go up.) Combined, these 
two effects will eliminate the unusually high profits to this activity. The initial 
vendor had socially useful knowledge, but it was knowledge that required no 
unusually scarce resources to benefit from.
The Indifference Principle
Steven Landsburg has called the phenomenon just described the indifference 
principle. Ask yourself which is more desirable as a place to live: San Diego or 
Dayton? The answer at first seems to be San Diego, because of the weather, 
the nearby natural beauty from beach to desert to mountains, the ethnic 
diversity, the cuisine, etc. But note first that not everyone values these things. 
People who value ties to nearby family members, their perception of the 
nature of social interchange where they are (“people are friendlier here,” 

Chapter 4 | The Economics of Information or Knowledge
84
people from everywhere seem to say), or the local habits they have acquired 
over a lifetime in Dayton have no wish to leave. But some will. And as they 
do, they will drive up the price of housing in San Diego. And with fixed free-
way space, more people means more time spent in traffic. Eventually, as home 
prices go up and the freeways become more crowded, people more or less 
stop moving to San Diego. (In fact, California in general became a state with 
net out-migration of Americans in the last decade.)
What has happened is that the excess return to living in San Diego has been com-
peted away. The new migrants drive up prices, and eventually the last person 
to move there basically could flip a coin as to whether to move or stay—in 
economic jargon, he is indifferent between staying and going. Our jam seller is 
in the same position—his excess profits should be competed away by people 
entering the business, who undersell him in Y and drive up the price in X. We 
can state this as a more general principle: when an activity is easy to duplicate 
and entry is open, excessive returns should be competed away. What makes the 
surplus to living in San Diego vanish is that anyone can move there, but hous-
ing and freeway space are scarce.28 What makes our jam seller’s high profits 
analogously vanish is that his activity, once he has learned of it and revealed it 
through his seizing profits by trading in the market, can be easily duplicated.
When the Indifference Principle Does Not Hold
But consider instead the phenomenon of the elite athlete. Albert Pujols29 plays 
first base for the California Angels, and until 2011 played for the St. Louis 
Cardinals. Based on his salary between 2008–2010 for the Cardinals, he made 
over $20,000 per plate appearance during that time. The world is full of peo-
ple who would be willing to do his job for free, and many others who would 
do it for substantially less than he is paid. But of course they wouldn’t do it 
nearly as well as he does. Taking an average baseball fan off the street and 
writing his name in the St. Louis Cardinals lineup every night would mean an 
automatic out once every nine players instead of having Pujols’s prodigious 
offensive production. The Cardinals, during the time Pujols played for them 
under contract, decided it wasn't even worthwhile to get rid of Pujols and 
replace him with another major-league-caliber baseball player who would have 
come cheaper, let alone someone who might’ve done it for $50 a night. Albert 
Pujols makes a phenomenally high salary because he has remarkably rare  
talent in an environment—Major League Baseball—where a large amount of 
money is divided up among a very small number of people. He is not nearly as 
subject to competition as our jam vendor.
28That the construction of housing in San Diego is artificially constrained by zoning and 
other government land-use planning makes it even more expensive there, but that is 
another problem.
29http://www.baseball-reference.com/players/p/pujolal01.shtml

Reasonably Simple Economics
85
As with Albert Pujols, so too with supermodels, musicians with very rare 
voices or instrumental gifts, and movie stars with unusually powerful public 
appeal, whether because of their looks or some other reason. All of these 
people possess a type of talent with very few decent substitutes and so are 
relatively invulnerable to competition, until such time as the public tires of 
them or their skills deteriorate with age. But this kind of skill need not be 
thought of as a mere gift of physical appearance or athletic talent. (It should 
be noted that most people who make it as supermodels, athletes, or enter-
tainers have spent years in training or auditions developing their skills, so 
the word gift is only partly accurate.) What made John D. Rockefeller and 
Steve Jobs great was their very rare ability to see around the economic 
corner—to see what was coming or what needed to be done—before oth-
ers did. Rockefeller, recall, had a whole series of innovations that meant that 
his money was not just made in his initial construction in Ohio of his oil-
trading system, but in his discovery of and acting on one very valuable idea 
after another.
So, it is within the power of some to exploit the inherent and long-lasting 
scarcity of skills they possess. They as individuals are not subject to the 
indifference principle. Indeed individuals seldom are—the first expatriate 
Daytonian to buy a house in San Diego might have gotten it relatively cheap 
and later could have sold it for an immense amount of money. But the ordi-
nary state of affairs is that high profits bring competition, and the only way 
to keep making money is to benefit from a resource in permanently short 
supply or to keep discovering new, also valuable, knowledge. Indeed, at the 
market level, the indifference principle is still in play. No one can compete 
away the immense returns of being Julia Roberts in particular, but for every 
Julia Roberts there are vast numbers of people who come hoping to be the 
next Julia Roberts but end up only doing local theater for low pay or wait-
ing tables, thus in a sense losing more than is gained, if we count all the time 
spent waiting unsuccessfully to be a star. The same logic holds for would-be 
Major League Baseball players who spend years training but never get near 
the major leagues. On average, the net income (compensation minus oppor-
tunity cost) to all people who try to become major leaguers or Hollywood 
stars may well be zero.30

30However, these activities are not without value, even to the person who fails to make it 
big, because he has fun playing and because sports teach teamwork, the value of pushing 
yourself, and other traits that are liable to be valuable. Becoming a better actor, even one 
destined to remain obscure, also has its nonmonetary rewards.

Chapter 4 | The Economics of Information or Knowledge

But many people make their fortunes large and small not by winning the race 
to be the next Hollywood movie star or NFL first-round draft pick, but by 
discovering valuable knowledge. The next section gives some thought to the 
process of trying to discover that knowledge.
Speculation
There is a way of thinking that economists probably overuse. When asked 
why businesses or industries or broad patterns of society are one way and 
not another, they say that if the other way were better that is what would be 
done. But this is flawed in that it assumes that the process of competition has 
always eliminated all better alternatives. Because there is a constant flow of 
new ideas and discoveries, and of people discovering unexploited opportuni-
ties, there is constant adjustment of resource use. And because not all ideas 
are created equal (competition will eliminate some and reward others), it 
is always possible that any individual’s idea about how to rearrange the way 
resources are used will be a good one relative to the existing substitutes.
We actually have a word for the act of setting out on this journey to an 
unknown destination, although the word generally has a different, and indeed 
often negative, connotation in the public’s mind. That word is speculation. Upon 
hearing it, many people think of people frantically buying and selling stocks 
or oil contracts in chaotic trading pits in New York or Chicago, or flipping 
houses.31 These things are indeed speculation, although only a few of an infinite 
variety of types of speculation. Many people also view speculators as socially 
useless people or people whose rapid-fire buying and selling—of technology 
stocks during the late 1990s bubble in those assets, say, or of Florida condo-
miniums during the real-estate bubble of the 2000s—needlessly inflate prices 
of these things beyond reason, causing social chaos when the bubbles pop. 
Many people even commit the fallacy of volition and assert that speculators 
purposely cause prices to go up so that they can make money. This charge 
comes up most frequently with regard to crude oil and gasoline prices, even 
among highly educated and accomplished people. Here32 is Joseph Kennedy II, 
the founder of a nonprofit group that provides energy assistance to the poor 
and a former Congressman from Massachusetts:
Because of speculation, today’s oil prices of about $100 a barrel have 
become disconnected from the costs of extraction, which average 
$11 a barrel worldwide. Pure speculators account for as much as 40 
percent of that high price, according to testimony that Rex Tillerson,

the chief executive of ExxonMobil, gave to Congress last year. That 
estimate is bolstered by a recent report from the Federal Reserve 
Bank of St. Louis.
Many economists contend that speculation on oil futures is a 
good thing, because it increases liquidity and better distributes 
risk, allowing refiners, producers, wholesalers, and consumers (like 
airlines) to “hedge” their positions more efficiently, protecting 
themselves against unseen future shifts in the price of oil.
But it’s one thing to have a trading system in which oil industry players 
place strategic bets on where prices will be months into the future; 
it’s another thing to have a system in which hedge funds and bankers 
pump billions of purely speculative dollars into commodity exchanges, 
chasing a limited number of barrels and driving up the price.
There is nothing new under the sun here. Mr. Kennedy is not the first person 
to criticize “speculation.” Vladimir Lenin, reacting to the chaos caused by his 
own policies after the Communist seizure of power, reacted with his typical 
terroristic excess, saying, “For as long as we fail to treat speculators the way 
they deserve—with a bullet in the head—we will not get anywhere at all.” 
Closer to home,  Abraham Lincoln also on several occasions expressed near-
fanatical criticism of speculators. Of those who bought and sold gold during 
the Civil War, he asked in a meeting with the governor of Pennsylvania, 
“What do you think of those fellows in Wall Street, who are gambling in gold 
at such a time as this?” The governor replied, “They are a set of sharks” (a vicious 
carnivore, note), whereupon Lincoln replied, “For my part, I wish every one of 
them had his devilish head shot off.”33 After a major stock bubble popped in 
1720, causing severe economic dislocation in Great Britain, the British govern-
ment banned the issuing of any stocks by business, believing that the specula-
tion in stock shares was useless.
Mr. Kennedy gives speculation some grudging praise, but this is a rare conces-
sion. People looking for simple explanations of complex financial trends often 
point their finger at “speculators” who make nothing real but through their 
“gambling ” cause tremendous damage. So what can we make of this hostility? 
First, Mr. Kennedy’s concessions are correct. The existence of oil-future con-
tracts does allow people to manage risk. If Southwest Airlines is worried that 
fuel prices may be very high in two months at the holiday travel season, they 
can buy a contract that allows them to obtain delivery of the fuel during that 
time at a price locked in today. (This is what futures contracts are—contracts 
to buy or sell a certain amount of something at a given price on a certain 
date in the future.) Mr. Kennedy is right to raise that benefit of these contracts.

But in fact, the primary benefit of this market does not lie here but precisely in 
the benefits speculation generates for the rest of society, not for the speculator.
To see why, consider the problem in Figure 4-1, from a slightly different, and 
amateurishly drawn, perspective.34
X
Y
Figure 4-1.  X and Y as places
X and Y are two villages separated by a mountain. They both produce their 
own grain, which they turn into bread. One year, Y has an unusually bad harvest.  
Someone in X hears information about it. He’s not sure it's true, but he thinks 
it might be. He decides to buy a lot of grain in X for $4.00 a bushel and then 
at some expense transports it across the mountain to see if he can sell it at 
a much higher price in Y. It turns out he can. The harvest is so bad there that 
the price is $6.00 a bushel. The collective effect of all this buying grain in X 
forces up the price there, causing people in X to consume less. In ways that 
we have already discussed, the money he makes doing this reflects the value 
of his knowledge that right now grain is more valuable at the margin in Y—in 
other words, that on the whole, X and Y will be better off if people in X who 
have grain are persuaded by payment to give up some of it to be bought 
by people in Y. And some of the more risk-taking people in X who see him 
doing this may themselves decide to sell more grain themselves in Y instead of 
consuming it locally in X, forcing the price in X up further and inducing more 
restraint in X so that yet more grain is available for consumption in Y, which 
up to a point is what we want to happen. Naturally, we wouldn’t want people 
in X to go without grain either, which will not happen because movement of 
grain from X to Y stops as soon as the rising grain price in X and the falling 
grain price in Y (because of more grain coming in from X) are even, once we 
include the cost of transporting grain from one place to the other. So, the 
price system is doing what it is supposed to do.
34I owe much of this analogy, although I do not implicate him in the artwork, to Don Boudreaux  
(www.newsday.com/opinion/oped/boudreaux-don-t-curse-the-oil-speculators-1.3645329).

So far we are on familiar ground. But what the enterprising individual in X has 
done, it should be noted, is to engage in act of speculation—he has guessed, 
based on some imperfect information that he has, that he can make money by 
transferring resources from one place to another. In this case, the only differ-
ence between the two forms of resource use is geographical—some grain is 
turned into bread in Y instead of in X.
But suppose we reconceive of what X and Y represent, as shown in Figure 4-2.
X
Y
The
Future
Right
now
Figure 4-2.  X and Y as times instead of places
X and Y are now not geographic places but periods of time. Someone hears 
some information that the grain harvest for next year is likely to be much 
worse than usual. He’s not sure it’s true, but he thinks it might be. He buys a 
futures contract that will allow him to buy grain to be stored now and deliv-
ered at period Y, but when it is delivered he will pay today’s price, allowing him 
to resell it at Y at the (higher, he hopes) market price prevailing then. But his 
doing so generates upward pressure in the market for grain to be delivered 
today. People who live in date X now and make it their business to pay atten-
tion to such things—call them speculators—notice this, and the more risk-
taking people living in X now who see him doing this may themselves decide 
to sell more grain themselves in the future instead of consuming it “locally” 
in period X, forcing the price now (in period X) up further and thus inducing 
more restraint now so that grain is available for consumption in the future (in 
period Y), which up to a point is what we want to happen. There is no mean-
ingful difference between transporting goods to different places on the basis 
of a belief that one can make money and transporting goods across time in the 
belief that one can make money.
The beauty of having contracts for delivering goods in the future is that when 
people expect the price of a good to go up in the future, they either buy it 
cheaply now (especially if it can be stored cheaply) or they buy futures con-
tracts that allow them to buy the good at a now seemingly relatively low price 
in the future, which induces people to observe that the price of this good is 
likely to rise in the future. Either way, we learn ahead of time that a shortage 
appears to be in the offing, prices go up now, and we begin to economize on 
use now, leaving more grain available to be consumed in the future. So when 
people blame oil speculators for increasing the price of gasoline, what they are 
really blaming is a new belief that oil will be scarcer in the future for making 
it more expensive now, which speculators, having formed this belief through 

Chapter 4 | The Economics of Information or Knowledge
90
their research, are informing us of with their “gambling.” If speculators could 
simply drive up prices at will, one would suppose that the price of oil would 
never go down, but of course it does. In addition, for everyone who buys an 
oil contract there is someone selling it to him, which indicates that people are 
disagreeing about the likely future circumstances of the oil market. It is only 
when sentiment about future prices tilts sufficiently toward the idea that they 
will rise a lot that those oil futures prices, and then shortly after the prices of 
oil now, rise significantly.
So all speculation is just making a guess about the future, and quite a bit of 
it has the salutary effect of bringing future developments to our attention 
now, alleviating the dislocation from those developments when they actually 
happen. Again, just as in the case of the financial markets we analyzed earlier, 
not every market prediction necessarily comes true. People lose money on 
futures contracts all the time, just as they choose college majors that don’t 
lead to high-paying jobs or they open small businesses that do not succeed. 
But the collective knowledge that is reflected in the futures price is the 
best guess we have (remember the wisdom-of-crowds idea), and repressing 
speculation would take away people’s incentive to try to learn about the 
future in order to make money off it. Venture capitalists speculate when 
they decide to invest money in company Y and not company X, although 
venture capitalists who disagree with the rosy assessments others are  
making about company Y, especially in light of the fact that it now costs 
more money to buy a share of investment in it, may choose instead to invest 
in X or seek out some new company Z. People who read that majoring in  
Y now leads to higher salaries than majoring in X may choose to major in 
Y in large numbers. The number of X majors shrinks, leading universities to 
hire more professors of Y and fewer professors of X, and indeed perhaps to 
open departments of Y for the first time.
Economically, all this activity is the same. Everybody buying, and everybody  
selling, is trying to pursue his self-interest as best he can while not possessing 
full information; maybe the future reveals him to be right, maybe it doesn’t. 
Each person has information, but no one has certainty. And, for reasons we 
have seen throughout this chapter, allowing people to make money is a good 
way to motivate them to reveal their information by acting on it, and to do 
some research (that is, to harvest information) before acting. Censoring  
speculators would, in other words, leave us considerably more ignorant, and 
economic ignorance is not bliss.

been around for decades, is financially successful, and attri-
butes much of its success to its lack of a rigid hierarchy.

Why Sugar Beet Farmers Get Government 
Subsidies but Apple Farmers Don’t
Markets and governments are perhaps, along with religion, the oldest human 
institutions. According to some research,1 stone axes may have been traded 
by humans hundreds of thousands of years ago. Adam Smith in The Wealth 
of Nations described the urge to “truck, barter and exchange” as a “general 
disposition” of men. As for government, the idea of a caste of humans with 
the power to forcibly extract resources (as with modern taxation) and use 
them for the ruler’s purposes (sometimes for the broad benefit of the public, 
sometimes not) and to tell people what they are not allowed to do (or are 
required to do) has been around at least since humans made the transition 
from hunter-gatherer to agricultural society, the latter generating for the first 
time large amounts of produce that had to be stored and allocated.

But the two institutions, because of the incentives they face, are different. To 
make this claim, the people who participate in each activity need not be dif-
ferent, one kind immoral and the other not, and I will assume throughout, in 
the usual economist’s way, that they are all pursuing self-interest. But the self-
interest of those in government often leads them to make different choices 
than occur when self-interested people interact in the market, and that is the 
focus of this chapter. Here we focus on situations in which government deci-
sion making is likely to lead to worse outcomes than when people trade what 
they own freely. The very real set of circumstances in which incentives mean 
that relying on markets to allocate resources with competing uses may be the 
inferior choice is deferred until Chapter 10.

  Government is run by people, and the people in government have incentives, just like the 
people they govern do. When thinking about whether we are likely to get the results from government 
we want, it helps to think about the incentives of those in government, and not to automatically 
assume that this incentive, unique to those in government, is “to do what is best for the public.”
Who Is the Government, and What Does  
It Want?
Actually, this question is not a sensible one. Government is not an organism 
with a brain and consciousness. It is rather a human institution, made up 
of individual human beings who are responding to the incentives they face. 
Individuals who work for the government want the same things as everybody 
else—money, prestige, authority over others, successful children, and an end 
to human suffering. They are no better, or no worse, than people who work 
for or own private businesses. But as we have seen, government is a dis-
tinctive social institution. It has power. What does power mean? To consider 
this I invoke Paul Heyne’s idea of coercion. According to his view, to coerce 
someone is to induce cooperation by threatening to reduce someone’s options,2 or 
alternatively, to persuade someone to do something you want by offering a set 
of choices, all of which make him worse off.
Note that this is generally not what happens in a market setting—compa-
nies make offers to consumers or workers, and if they turn the offer down 
they are simply where they started, rather than worse off. But a robber who 
points a gun in one’s face and says, “Your money or your life” is engaged in 
an act of coercion. So too is a boss who demands of a subordinate that she

Hall, 2000): 352.

sleep with him or lose her job. Power then is the ability to coerce others. As 
these examples suggest, it is not only government officials who possess power 
over others. But it is only government that is intrinsically about power. If the 
­government wants you to do something, you either do it (and because you 
didn’t voluntarily choose to do it, you are worse off) or you pay a fine or go to 
jail. Government is intrinsically coercive, and so its power should be rationed 
carefully.
Anytime the government exercises its lawmaking authority to take resources 
from some people and give them to others, or to prevent people from using 
resources they own in a way they would have chosen, it is leaving them worse 
off than they otherwise would be. This is not enough to argue that the coer-
cion should not happen, but it should give us pause. Keep this in mind as we 
investigate the ways markets and governments decide the question of how to 
use scarce resources.
Problem 1: Government as Subject to  
Special-Interest Capture
The first problem descends from the analysis in Chapter 4 about competition 
and its value. Recall that competition is a way to enable people both to try out 
their knowledge (with the market rewarding socially valuable knowledge and 
punishing informational mistakes) and to drain away unusually high rates of 
return accruing to people who are the first ones to think of a new way to do 
something—in other words, to make the indifference principle play out. One 
circumstance that prevents competition from draining away these profits to 
the broader benefit of society is when a resource—whether it is Albert Pujols’s 
talent for hitting a baseball a long way, Elvis Presley’s voice and carefully crafted 
public image, or John D. Rockefeller’s drive and knack for spotting things that 
ought to be done but haven’t been—has so few substitutes that the owner of 
it can earn very high rates of return for an extended period of time.
The good news is that although individuals can (and should) earn immense 
amounts of money based on the value of their ideas over an extended period 
of time, history suggests that high profits for a company that is founded by one 
of those individuals can only persist for so long. We saw that Apple Computer 
itself was in a lot of trouble in the late 1980s and early 1990s, and is tremen-
dously vulnerable to competition, as the once-mighty Nokia company 
was when the cell phones it made were swept aside by the smartphone revolu-
tion. Nokia may yet recover, and Apple may still prove to be a great innovator; 
all of this is left to the judgment of consumers. No company is invulnerable to 
competition—not the investment bank Bear Stearns (founded in 1923, died 
in the financial crash of 2008), not Bethlehem Steel (the twelfth largest com-
pany in the United States by revenue in 1955, vanished in 2003), not Chrysler 
(declared bankrupt in 1980, rebounded under bankruptcy organization, but 

Chapter 5 | Public and Private Decision Making
98
bought and sold before declaring bankruptcy and being sold again in 2009), 
not Microsoft, not Google. Companies stay in business only with permission 
of their customers and of the owners of the resources they seek to use to 
make what they sell. Competition is an extremely vigorous force over the long 
term. In the long term, essentially, the demand for everything is elastic.
So every seller must constantly be on the lookout for entry from new com-
petitors. But what if a seller could use the law to prevent such entry? Achieving 
that would be good for the seller but bad for the rest of society, and hence 
is a thing to be opposed, but it is distressingly common, often ironically in the 
name of protecting consumers.
For example, numerous states require those who cut hair and do makeovers 
to have cosmetology licenses. But in recent years, those who merely braid 
hair—a business that has grown both due to greater public demand and the 
arrival of many immigrants from Africa who want to enter the business—have 
also sometimes been required to go through the training that is required 
before the license is granted, which can amount to over 1,000 hours of course 
time, often in fields that have nothing to do with braiding. In Washington state, 
one must go through 1,700 hours of instruction3 to get a license to be a 
barber or beautician, whereas one needs only 130 hours to become an emer-
gency medical technician, which is a job where people’s lives are actually at 
stake. The requirement, it should be noted, is not that one pass a test certify-
ing the knowledge, but that one actually take the courses (for a fee of course), 
to the benefit of the schools offering the training.
State bar associations similarly require that to become a lawyer one cannot 
just pass the bar exam, but that one spend three years in an officially cre-
dentialed law school first, again at considerable expense in money and time.  
One story by National Public Radio has reported4 that whereas several 
decades ago fewer than one in twenty occupations required a license, now 
about a third do.
Who benefits from these license requirements? In principle the requirements 
need not exist but could be replaced by customers deciding for themselves 
whether a seller of services—who might possess a non-mandatory certifica-
tion offered by private agencies as a means to inform consumers that the 
certification’s requirements have been met, a purely voluntary kind of cer-
tification that the spontaneous order could create—should be patronized 
or not. Consumers benefit, nominally, because they have assurance that the 
seller of services is safe or qualified. But obtaining certification is costly, and 
those costs will eventually have to be passed on, or else the number of ­sellers

99
will have to decrease; either way, prices increase, partially canceling out or 
even outweighing greater confidence in the quality of the seller. Mandatory 
certification, of course, raises all sellers’ costs. And mandatory or voluntary 
certification is not the only signal of quality; a long record of doing business 
with customers who come away from the experience very satisfied performs 
the same function, as do groups such as the Better Business Bureau (which 
monitors member businesses for complaints of fraud) and Consumers Union 
(publishers of Consumer Reports, which rates a wide variety of goods and 
­services for safety, reliability, and cost).
But mandatory certification has one effect that is unambiguously bad: it makes 
it harder to enter a business and compete with people who already possess 
the certification. We would have more people willing to practice law, braid 
hair, and do contracting work if these things and others (such as auctioneer-
ing) did not require expensive credentialing. In states where braiders must get 
cosmetology licenses after training, the entire content of which is something 
extraneous to what they do, these requirements increase entry costs while 
doing little, arguably nothing, for consumers. And higher entry costs generate 
higher profits for existing sellers.
According to an account from The New York Times in 1997, at that time, when 
New York State’s mandatory cosmetology curriculum requirement for braid-
ers had been in place for a number of years, no one had successfully completed 
the curriculum, so that only those existing braiders who were demanding the 
license requirement and because of their political influence were exempted 
from having to take the courses could obtain a license. Those who are least 
able to afford the time and money required by the curriculum are those who 
would also be likely to charge the lowest prices and therefore would benefit 
consumers the most; but many of these competitors, alas, are immigrants 
with little political influence or knowledge of the American bureaucracy. 
Some people choose to enter the business anyway, without a license, but this 
makes them vulnerable to customers who refuse to pay, knowing that they 
can report the seller for operating without a license.5 If the reader doubts 
that this credentialing—the requirement that licenses be acquired, often after 
the acquisition of expensive instruction—is usually about protecting existing 
competitors from competition from new entrants rather than about benefit-
ing consumers, note that Louisiana requires florists to have a license, and 
Nevada requires one of interior designers.
5For more on how the people demanding the curriculum for braiding managed to get 
themselves exempted from it, see Lena Williams, “The Battle of the Braid Brigade,” The 
New York Times (January 26, 1997). For information on the way the licensing requirement 
makes unlicensed braiders vulnerable to theft (that is, unable to benefit from the rule of 
law), see Monte Williams, “Bargain Braiders Battle for Heads: Hair Stylists From Africa 
Arrive, Driving Down Prices,” The New York Times (May 19, 2001).

Chapter 5 | Public and Private Decision Making

Note also that British Columbia ended the requirement that beauty workers, 
and people doing several other kinds of work besides, acquire a license, and 
there is no evidence the sky has fallen there. For many years, people in the 
United States got their hair done license-free without any outbreak of social 
chaos, as indeed they do in most countries around the world. Competition 
and reputation instead serve as their guides. (People who sell services that 
are performed unsafely are always very vulnerable to competition from those 
who sell them safely.) And note finally that civilization somehow managed to 
survive for many centuries without requiring workers to get permission from 
the government for entering a trade, with the uncredentialed lawyer Abraham 
Lincoln, who attended no law school and acquired no law license, being an 
instructive example.
Credentialing is an example of a much broader problem called an artificial 
entry barrier—a law or rule or specifically and arbitrarily applied government 
expenditure or tax that helps some sellers protect themselves from compe-
tition that would otherwise occur. Licenses are a common example, as are 
restrictions on imports (which protect domestic producers at the expense of 
consumers), and so are laws requiring that governments contract only with 
companies that have union contracts (preventing competition from compa-
nies and workers that wish to work outside a union framework). Other noto-
rious examples include Jim Crow laws in the former Confederate states, and 
even more so the Black Codes that preceded them. The latter referred to 
regulations passed by white governments in the newly defeated Confederacy 
to limit the ability of freed slaves to compete with white workers. Here is an 
excerpt from the Mississippi Black Code, which was typical:
Section 5. Every freedman, free negro and mulatto shall, on the second 
Monday of January, 1866, and annually thereafter, have a lawful home 
or employment, and shall have written evidence thereof as follows, 
to wit: if living in any incorporated city, town, or village, a license 
from that mayor thereof; and if living outside of an incorporated city, 
town, or village, from the member of the board of police of his beat, 
authorizing him or her to do irregular and job work; or a written 
contract, as provided in Section 6 in this act; which license may be 
revoked for cause at any time by the authority granting the same.
Section 6. All contracts for labor made with freedmen, free negroes 
and mulattoes for a longer period than one month shall be in writing, 
and a duplicate, attested and read to said freedman, free negro or 
mulatto by a beat, city or county officer, or two disinterested white 
persons of the county in which the labor is to performed, of which 
each party shall have one: and said contracts shall be taken and held as 
entire contracts, and if the laborer shall quit the service of the employer 
before the expiration of his term of service, without good cause, he  
shall forfeit his wages for that year up to the time of quitting.

Note that the law applied only to non-whites (“freedmen, free Negroes and 
mulattoes”) and gave government officials (white, naturally) near-absolute 
authority to decide whether blacks could do work their customers wanted 
them to do. Needless to say, in the environment of post-Civil War Mississippi,  
it would be difficult for a newly freed slave to round up “two disinterested 
white persons of the county in which the labor is performed” to authorize 
his labor contract (which in this time would have been mostly for work or 
mechanical labor using skills that slaves had acquired either during or after 
their enslavement). Note finally the onerous conditions of contracting imposed 
on non-whites, who would have to return already-paid wages if they quit a 
job before their contract had expired. The arrival of Reconstruction forces 
meant the overturning of these Black Codes, but once the U.S. military left 
after the 1876 election, the codes substantially came back as the now notori-
ous Jim Crow laws, which imposed mandated racial segregation on a wide 
variety of business activities. Like the Black Codes before them, Jim Crow 
laws, by preventing entry by non-white workers into many commercial activi-
ties, benefited existing white workers and damaged not just black workers but 
consumers too.
These entry barriers are common and also damaging, both to entrepreneurs 
who want to pursue a living and to consumers who must pay higher prices. 
A woman named Robin Smith, who had practiced as an independent paralegal 
for many years, once started a business doing routine legal work that did not 
require a lot of high-powered courtroom expertise (filing wills, for example) 
for much lower prices than lawyers were charging. She was successfully sued 
by the Oregon State Bar, a group that regulates and lobbies for lawyers in 
that state. The association also controls entry into the trade via the require-
ment that people who want to be lawyers pass American Bar Association-
administered exams and go to ABA-credentialed law schools. The alleged 
offense was practicing law without a license, and the ABA’s successful lawsuit 
resulted in her business being closed down. The Florida Bar did something 
similar to Rosemary Furman, a legal secretary who sold relatively uncompli-
cated legal forms and services to people of modest means, with the result that 
she was initially sentenced to actual jail time, although never served any.6
In the last 150 years, one of the most effective entry barriers in countries 
throughout the world has been the labor union. At its core, a labor union is sim-
ply an agreement by workers to negotiate their working conditions—salaries, 
promotion procedures (seniority versus productivity), procedures for arbi-
trating disputes between workers and management—collectively, instead of 
each worker negotiating for himself the deal that is best for him. The belief by

supporters of unions, and it is not unreasonable, is that when workers coop-
erate by saying all of us will work at this salary or none of us will work at all, 
employers will pay more than when workers have to compete individually for 
jobs. When companies that sell products do this, they violate the law by com-
mitting an act called price-fixing, but unions—organizations of people that sell 
labor—are exempt from the laws governing price-fixing behavior in the United 
States and in many countries.
As we proceed through this section, it is good to recall the earlier argument 
that in terms of the entire society, a job is merely a means to an end, not the 
end itself. The aim of any business activity is to produce things that custom-
ers want to buy because these things create more value for customers than it 
costs to bring it to them. Increasing production costs by mere legal manipu-
lation thus destroys value. Higher production costs make consumers worse 
off. It is true that lower wages make workers worse off, but it is precisely the 
function of the market to sort out these contending claims. If workers see 
that their interests are best served by negotiating collectively, then the prin-
ciple of reliance on self-interest for the betterment of society suggests that 
they be allowed to do so.
However, the problem arises when the law requires that any time a sufficiently 
large percentage of the workforce—at present in much of the U.S., a bare 
majority is all that is required—approves representation by the union, they 
may impose the legal obligation on the employer to negotiate with it, whether 
the employer wants to or not, and impose on others who want to work for 
that employer the legal requirements to work under the union contract or 
not work for the employer at all. This prevents workers from competing on 
any grounds—more flexible scheduling, higher productivity requirements, less 
compensation initially or later, agreeing that the employer has the option of 
ignoring seniority in deciding which workers deserve promotion—not per-
mitted by the union contract.
Question 5.1
■
 Why do you suppose labor unions so often demand in their negotiations that 
promotion and compensation be based on seniority rather than on merit or productivity?
But the world of course is full of workers—workers who are younger, who 
are ambitious to prove their worth for this or for a future employer, who can’t 
work a standard 9–5 shift but who would be very productive if allowed to 
work weekends, the list is practically endless—who would love to compete 
on different terms. The union contract prevents that. And if the law requires 
the imposition of the union contract even though there are workers would 
like to work outside it, this is an entry barrier in the market for labor, just as 
surely as requiring 1,700 hours of cosmetology classes is an entry barrier in 
the market for hair braiding.

Reasonably Simple Economics
103
It is really no surprise that laborers who expect to benefit from limits on com-
petition enthusiastically seek to be the exclusive negotiator for compensation 
and working conditions through the union-contract framework, and then to 
use this framework to deter other workers from filling the positions vacated 
by strikers. Such laborers cannot succeed in limiting employment terms to a 
collectively bargained contract unless all workers in a facility work through 
the union contract rather than work out their own terms., People trying to 
organize collective bargaining at a particular workplace, unsurprisingly, often 
want that support to be expressed through openly signing (or, critically, openly 
refusing to sign) a petition rather than secret ballots. Without a secret ballot, 
an individual’s refusal to support collective bargaining is known by all.
During organizing or during a strike, such people will also have an incentive 
to use whatever tactics are legal, and sometimes some that are illegal, such 
as violence against the strikebreakers, to prevent competition from limiting 
their control of bargaining. And, as in the case of the Mississippi Black Codes, 
if their membership is of one ethnic group, they may seek to use ethnic-
based rules to limit competition from members of different ethnic groups. 
This is undoubtedly why white labor groups were supporters of the 1879 
Constitution of the State of California, which prevented the state government 
and any company chartered in the state from hiring Chinese workers.7
When a government agency starts out with a stated purpose of imposing rules 
to benefit a certain group in society—consumers, for example—but ends up 
enacting rules that benefit another group—like existing producers—we have a 
phenomenon known as regulatory capture. Often those who purport to speak 
for consumers demand that governments regulate prices that these advocates 
view as too high. Legal ranges for prices may be imposed, despite the delete-
rious effects of such controls noted in Chapter 3. Yet despite technological 
progress in the industry whose prices are being regulated, prices frequently do 
not come down. Instead, the companies being regulated work with the regu-
latory authorities to make sure these ranges, once seen as maximum prices, 
become minimum prices—below which no new entrant can compete legally.
For example, in 1938, at the tail end of Franklin Roosevelt’s New Deal, the 
airline industry was in its infancy. Consistent with the tenor of the times, 
which owing to the Great Depression were marked by profound skepticism 
7The California Workingmen’s Party, founded in 1877 to stand up for a certain conception 
of worker’s rights, had as one of its leaders a man named Dennis Kearney, an immigrant 
himself from Ireland, who had a habit of winding up speeches by saying, “The Chinese 
must go!” To him, the presence of the “Chinese coolie” in the United States served only 
to “degrade white labor.” That Chinese workers and employers who hired them were 
both better off by having the right to contract and thus better serve their customers was 
of no concern to these white unions, as it is of no concern to anyone seeking to impose 
an entry barrier.

of business, legislation was passed in 1940 that resulted in the creation of the 
Civil Aeronautics Board. The Board was charged with (among other things) 
regulating airline fares and the routes the airlines were allowed to fly, with the 
goal of preventing exploitation of consumers through high fares. Here is how 
one author describes the change in the way airlines competed:
In the 1930s nurse-stewardesses were a popular frill that not all young 
airlines could afford. By the late 1940s carefully chosen hostesses 
became more central to the maturing airline industry’s marketing 
and service objectives because other avenues of competition had 
narrowed. After the federal government undertook economic 
regulation of the industry in 1938, airlines staked their reputation 
more closely on the quality of in-flight services and the charms of the 
stewardesses who delivered them. Deregulated airlines scrambled 
to win travelers’ business with luxurious innovations in air transport 
and even more emphasis on fulfilling the promise of an attractive, 
attentive hostess.8
An entire television show (ABC’s Pan Am) was once created on the mythol-
ogy of the purported glamour of this era in flying, which stemmed from the 
fact that airlines were prevented from competing on the basis of lower prices. 
Most passengers would prefer more luxury (small white tablecloths for the 
tray tables, high-quality food) to less. (Those who want such things are still 
free to buy first-class tickets.) Some, perhaps many, male passengers would 
prefer very attractive flight attendants. But such things are subject to trade-
offs, and what the results of freer competition have taught us is that many 
passengers do not care about them much and attach much more importance 
to getting where they’re going quickly and cheaply. They are glad to give up 
these luxuries of a bygone era in exchange for lower fares, which were a 
major result of the airline deregulation of 1978, which ended government 
control over airfares.
Suddenly, how many flights there should be, from where to where, what 
should be charged for them, and the amenities that should be offered in-flight 
(flight attendants expected to flaunt their sex appeal, fine cuisine elegantly 
served) were no longer dictated directly or, through price floors, indirectly by 
bureaucrats, but instead came about through the spontaneous order, through  
the market negotiation process between buyers and sellers of airline flights. 
After competition played out without artificial government restraint, we 
learned something we did not know before—that frills are not important 
enough to justify the fares that supported them or the limitation on flexibility

in introducing new routes. New airlines, a concept almost unknown during 
the years of airline regulation, began to rise and fall all the time after 1978. 
Society was clearly better off, but two groups that had fought hardest to keep 
the entry barriers of price regulation and a lengthy governmental approval 
process for new airlines struggled—the existing airlines and their unionized 
workers. Under regulation, they had been able to pass on higher wages to 
consumers in the form of higher prices. Many of the “great” airlines of the 
regulated era—Eastern Airlines, Pan Am, TWA—failed to survive the transi-
tion to deregulation. But air travel expanded far beyond the core market of 
wealthy leisure travelers and businessmen going far from home. It began to 
accommodate backpackers who wanted to see the world, full-time workers 
who wanted a quick weekend getaway, people who just wanted to fly home 
to spend time with old friends or see their children on the other side of the 
country,9 and others whose willingness to pay to go from certain places to 
certain other places under certain conditions could never have been known 
to the Civil Aeronautics Board.
Yet it took 40 years to get rid of airline price and route regulation. What took 
so long? As noted, although airline regulation was bad for society as a whole, 
it was good for several groups in particular—the people who owned stock in 
the regulated airlines (which could charge higher prices and face less competi-
tion) and the people who worked for them.
The process by which political decisions get produced is not the simple demo-
cratic model taught in high school, that of  “take a vote, and the majority 
rules.” Instead, one has to invest resources to learn the knowledge about how 
regulatory agencies and legislatures make their rules. Indeed, bright law-school 
graduates and former congressmen with a lot of experience often specialize 
in helping people who want to get benefits from the government navigate 
congressional and bureaucratic procedures. We call these people lobbyists. 
Businesses will invest in the production of entry barriers by lobbying when 
they expect at the margin to make higher profits spending the money that 
way then they would by spending money competing in the market—especially 
competing against new entrants in possession of superior knowledge that 
would cause existing firms to lose business.
Ordinary people are busy, and paying attention to the lawmaking process for 
them is often difficult to justify. This is even truer when the costs of an entry 
barrier or other kinds of government regulation of the market are borne in 
small amounts by large numbers of people. For example, sugar-beet farmers 
in the United States benefit from the entry barrier of high tariffs (the formal

air travel, of course.

term for taxes on imported goods) and from dramatic numerical limitations 
imposed on imported sugar. There is no free lunch, so the cost of limiting 
entry into the sugar market in the U.S. is borne first by those who make goods 
that use sugar or who don’t use it and instead substitute a higher-cost sub-
stitute such as high-fructose corn syrup. This in turn is passed on ultimately 
to workers and shareholders of these companies and to consumers who buy 
their products. But because the amount per candy bar or soda purchased is 
so small, it makes little sense for each consumer to spend a lot of time figuring 
out whether changes in the law could make those products cheaper.
But sugar-beet farmers who grow sugar in the United States each have a 
gigantic amount at stake if the tariffs and quotas are eliminated—very possibly 
hundreds of thousands of dollars per farmer. For the several thousand sugar-
beet farmers in the U.S., it is indeed rational to pay very close attention. These 
farmers thus make campaign donations, scrutinize the laws governing the 
sugar trade, regularly communicate with their representatives in Washington, 
spend lots of money on lobbyists, and do the other things necessary to get 
things done in the manufacturing of laws. The lesson? Entry barriers involving 
arcane topics are likely to benefit small, well-organized groups who have a lot 
at stake, and their burdens are likely to be born in largely invisible ways by 
large groups. What Americans pay extra, because of limits on imports of sugar, 
for example, comes to about $150 per American per year.10 Whether that is 
a small amount over the course of a year I leave to the reader’s judgment, 
but if we add up all entry barriers in markets for all goods, the cost must be 
substantial.
Another informative example of regulatory capture is compensation for gov-
ernment employees. In many states, government-employee unions were long 
ago recognized as the sole legitimate bargaining agent through which workers 
could face off against taxpayers and their representatives. For public employ-
ees, the issues of their compensation and fringe benefits are critically impor-
tant. For taxpayers, who have many other things, both in their private lives 
and with regard to politics, that they must pay attention to, time is extremely 
scarce. Naturally, there is a tendency for politicians to reward those who 
scream the loudest. A phrase of unknown provenance says that 90% of life 
is just showing up, and when lots of money and protection from competition 
are at stake, public employees, like many other relatively small groups before 
them, had the incentive to show up when the taxpayers did not. The result 
tends to give public employees compensation—especially taken as retirement 
benefits and job security—that is greater than that for private-sector workers 
who do similar work.

The Congressional Budget Office estimates,11 for example, that the federal 
workforce earns 16% more in total wages and compensation than a private-
sector work force with the same levels of education and experience would.12 
City bus drivers generally enjoy better wages and benefits than private-sector 
bus drivers do, and those who deliver mail for the U.S. Postal Service simi-
larly are favorably situated relative to those who work for FedEx or UPS. 
In addition, the unions representing these employees can and do use their 
salaries, which come from taxpayers, to lobby against the privatization of the 
services they offer. Like any other pressure group, they lobby, make campaign 
donations, and buy televised political ads. If we assume a politician’s primary 
interest is in electoral success, then he will have an incentive to inflate public-
employee compensation and benefits now, secure in the knowledge that the 
bill will come due when someone else is in office.
Indeed, the short-term-nature of political decision making is rooted in the fact 
that future generations are not represented in any legislature, so there is a 
natural tilt toward spending now and paying later. This presumably is why so 
many U.S. states have run into budgetary crises13 in part because of what has 
been promised in the past to public employees, relative to what is available 
now. The same problem is afflicting public pensions and health care systems 
in some European countries such as Spain and Greece, and may soon beset 
Social Security and Medicare in the United States. Promising benefits is in the 
short-term interest of politicians; paying the bill is not.
Overall, in the U.S. the value of the limitations on competition and spe-
cial privileges14 that Washington hands out can be gleaned from a Forbes ­ 
magazine list15 of the wealthiest counties in the U.S. Of the top ten, five are 
in Virginia or Maryland, adjacent to Washington, D.C. Some of this is due to 
federal employees who live there, but much of it is due to the presence of 
huge numbers of people engaged in regulatory and legislative warfare—the 
attempt to make sure Congress takes from those guys over there, who are 
perhaps not paying much attention, and gives to me. Whether people lobby 
to increase the amount taken from others and given to them or decrease the

bachelor’s or a high-school diploma. The former earned 36% more in wages and benefits, 
the latter 15%. Those with professional degrees or doctorates received 18% less.

specific groups in society at the expense of everyone else.

amount taken from them and given to others, they need high-priced legal tal-
ent and researchers writing advocacy reports to make it happen. That these 
lobbyists earn so much money is a reflection of what legislative privileges are 
worth. Indeed, the D.C. area fared better than almost any metropolitan region 
in the country after the financial crash in 2008 and subsequent depression, 
with home prices and income continuing to increase.16 Note also that one 
county on the Forbes list, Los Alamos County in New Mexico, is nowhere near 
Washington but is dominated by a federal military-research laboratory, which 
means that it attracts many people who do business with the military, at high 
rates of pay.

  Competing is hard. It is often attractive to people to get the government to limit their 
competition rather than doing the hard work of competing. The easier it is to do the former, the less 
competition we will have.
Problem 2: The Incentive to Accumulate 
Knowledge in the Private Sector and in the 
Government
In Chapter 4 I discuss the problem of decentralized knowledge. Here I discuss 
in more detail the incentives of the government to accumulate knowledge, 
and the consequences of this incentive system.
Knowledge is costly, and people invest in its acquisition as long as the marginal 
benefit to doing so is expected to exceed the marginal cost. But what is the 
marginal benefit of information acquisition for a politician or bureaucrat? In 
some cases, it’s nothing more than the increase in his ability to acquire power 
or win elections. (In other cases, to be sure, it’s the imposition of some set 
of laws that the politician or bureaucrat believes will improve society.) But 
given that the knowledge is down below, and the politician or bureaucrat is 
looking down from on high, he will never have the incentive to acquire all the 
knowledge he needs to make the decision in the most efficient way possible. 
This is why, recall, zoning and other land-use controls (for example, the decla-
ration of some land as wetlands, which makes it illegal to use the land for any 
other purpose than the current one, which invariably means leaving it idle), 
create so many unexpected, negative consequences. The incentive to acquire

109
knowledge is never as focused for a government decision maker—unless the 
knowledge is about how to be reelected or how to acquire the legal authority 
to accomplish some desired task—as it is for a private trader in the market. 
This is not a statement about who is good and who is evil, only about incen-
tives. Market participants have a lot of their own resources at stake and tend 
to be much closer to the local knowledge that is needed to make a better 
decision. Politicians, in contrast, are distant and have different goals. It is no 
surprise that the rules they impose on who may be paid what, how land may 
and may not be used, which financial trades are and are not legal, and so forth 
generate so many surprising outcomes.
And thus we have Harold L. Ickes, longtime Secretary of the Interior and war-
time “petroleum coordinator” for President Franklin D Roosevelt, pronounc-
ing with complete confidence that the gasoline rationing imposed shortly 
before the U.S. entry into World War II could not possibly generate bootleg-
ging (creation of a black market in gasoline):   “Oil stations have to get their sup-
plies from somewhere—you can’t make gasoline in your bathtub, you know.” 
In fact, wartime rationing generated black markets in a wide variety of goods, 
including gasoline. This frustrated the original goal of conserving fuel for the 
military and generated policing costs to try to get the various black markets 
under control. Why did Ickes make such an obvious mistake—obvious at least 
to someone with an appreciation for the depth of decentralized knowledge 
and for the ability of entrepreneurs to harvest it? I would guess that he was 
informed by his own recent experience of Prohibition, when people really did 
make bootleg alcohol in their bathtubs. But no other model of a black market 
for gasoline occurred to him, because he had no powerful incentive to go out 
and look for it.
In fact, gasoline bootleggers were cleverer than he imagined possible. Ickes 
thought about the problem in this way despite the experience of the 1930s, 
when equally extensive price controls were imposed under the authority of 
the National Recovery Agency. That agency was established in 1933 to try to 
end the Great Depression by micromanaging the price system—in particular 
by raising prices that in the judgment of the authorities were too low and 
lowering those that were thought to be too high. The result:
The NRA was discovering it could not enforce its rules. Black 
markets grew up. Only the most violent police methods could 
procure enforcement. In Sidney Hillman’s garment industry the code 
authority employed enforcement police. They roamed through the 
garment district like storm troopers. They could enter a man’s 
factory, send him out, line up his employees, subject them to minute 
interrogation, take over his books on the instant. Night work was 
forbidden. Flying squadrons of these private coat-and-suit police 
went through the district at night, battering down doors with axes 
looking for men who were committing the crime of sewing together 

Chapter 5 | Public and Private Decision Making
110
a pair of pants at night. But without these harsh methods many code 
authorities said there could be no compliance because the public 
was not back of it.17
So, rules on which kinds of trades are not allowed beget unexpected conse-
quences, and these consequences beget anger at those in the economy who 
are only pursuing their interest, often by working around the rules because 
it is better for both buyer and seller. That in turn begets more rules and 
more enforcement against these ne’er-do-wells. All of this ignores that costly 
information is a problem, and that giving people a reason to harvest it is the 
solution.
All the people who have been able to get a flight since 1978, who would not 
have been able to under the old airline price-control system, have deregula-
tion of the airline industry to thank for it. It never occurred to any of the 
regulators that there was a social need for routes that were not authorized 
by law, and at fares that were lower but still economically feasible—provided 
only that people trying to make money were allowed the freedom to try to 
discover low-cost ways to run these flights. The airline industry itself, despite 
being subject to endemic bankruptcy and not being a particularly high-profit 
industry, estimates that the real price of air travel has fallen over 40 percent 
since deregulation, helping to turn air travel from a luxury into an ordinary, 
widely accessible form of transportation. This didn’t happen immediately. It 
happened through trying out different types of competitive experiments until 
the airlines settled on funneling flights from many more cities through hubs 
like Chicago and Atlanta and, as noted earlier, trading off in-flight amenities for 
lower fares.
In contrast, consider this woeful tale18 of an airport built in Castellon, Spain. 
The airport was extraordinarily expensive but ended up with a runway that 
was too narrow to handle most of the air traffic it was built to accommodate. 
It turns out also that the area where it was built was already served by several 
major airports, indicating that the marginal benefit of building a another one 
might be rather small. Imagine that building this airport were being pondered 
by a private developer. Is it likely that such fundamental mistakes as building an 
unnecessary airport or making the runway too narrow would have happened? 
It is not necessary to believe that the people who built the airport were acting 
with bad intentions—that they wanted to fleece the public. (Although some

of that was probably going on too, according to media reports19 about this 
airport.) This example suggests that governments make a lot of bad decisions 
because, even if they are acting out of the highest motivations, compared to 
people with their own money at stake, there is very little incentive for decision 
makers to learn what needs to be learned to do the job well. Much sustained 
inefficiency that we observe around us, public or private, can be attributed to 
the lack of a compelling incentive to learn how to do things better.

  When there are great benefits to getting something right and great costs to getting them 
wrong, decisions are likely to be better. In the political system, sometimes those benefits and costs 
are not the same as they are in a non-political environment.
Problem 3:  The Democracy Problem
Earlier I noted that small, focused groups often have an advantage in using the 
government to extract wealth at the expense of large, unfocused groups with 
little at stake per person. But when benefits are obvious, large numbers can 
be an advantage. American sugar farmers have an advantage over American 
consumers of sweets in lobbying the government because the latter seldom 
have the time to find out the details of the various government programs 
that take from them and give the farmers. (That these transfers of wealth are 
dispersed through many complicated laws and programs—subsidy of farmers, 
limitation on competition from imports, and so on—to begin with, rather 
than only one, is part of the informational problem for the consumer.) But 
sometimes having the public on your side allows you to use government to 
take from your neighbor.
In Chapter 3, during discussion of price controls, rent control is briefly 
­mentioned. Legal ceilings on apartment rents are something that has a clear 
and obvious effect on large numbers of people, mostly tenants. Some tenants 
may know that allowing them to pay less rent than a landlord would charge in 
a free market constrains the landlord’s possibilities, but may not care because 
they assume that as a landlord he has a lot of money to spare anyway. Others 
may well not know about the informational and incentive functions of prices, 
including apartment rents, which are set by the market. In any event, there are 
likely to be far more tenants than apartment-building owners in New York 
City. The City Council in New York reflects the will of constituents, and so 
it becomes nearly impossible in a democratic setting for rent controls, once 
done, to be undone. Tenants simply outvote landlords on an issue that is

easy for tenants to understand and which clearly has major effects on their 
self-interest.20 In most advanced countries, a majority of public expenditure 
is simply the redistribution of wealth from some to others, usually based on 
a system of taxation and distribution of benefits that results in taking more 
from those with a lot of money to give to those with less.
As evidence for this assertion, Table 5-1 presents data on the percentage of 
income and social security and government medical-care taxes paid by the 
richest 30 percent of the population in a variety of wealthy democracies, as 
well as payments received through retirement, medical, and other universal 
programs.
20 Potential future tenants, people who might move to New York City if only they could be 
confident of finding a place to live, do not get to vote for members of the New York City 
Council, of course.

In each case, the richest 30 percent pay substantially more than 30 percent of 
the taxes and receive less, often substantially less, than 30 percent of transfer 
spending. (Note also that, contrary to conventional wisdom, the United States 
is actually a country where the wealthy bear a relatively high proportion of 
the tax burden.) This may seem perfectly natural to many readers: of course 
the wealthy should pay more and get less; that is the nature of funding govern-
ment. But a reaction of of course reveals how we have internalized the idea 
that redistribution from those with more to those with less is natural, and I 
would suggest that this policy and belief are normal outcomes in democratic 
societies. 
Is this policy a bad outcome? Not necessarily; one could make all kinds of 
ethical arguments in favor of this purpose for government funding and expen-
diture. However, if such policies also have negative economic consequences 
(as they clearly do in the case of price controls, whether for New York City 
apartments or toilet paper and milk, currently hard to get in Venezuela, which 
is packed with price controls on such daily goods), then such consequences 
must be counted in the ledger of the effects of relying on government to pre-
side over the decision of how scarce resources get used.
Problem 4:  The Abuse-of-Power Problem
When government passes rules to change the way scarce resources are used, 
it is doing so because the result that has occurred when individuals have freely 
chosen to trade or not to trade is seen as undesirable. It thus must exer-
cise power or coercion in the sense defined earlier. Unfortunately, because 
of Problem 2, the informational problem, government intervention frequently 
makes things worse. This naturally causes many politicians and bureaucratic 
rule makers to believe, as indicated earlier, not that their making the rules 
about how resources should be used is itself unwise because of what they 
don’t know, but that they now do know these things and can make more 
rules to fix the problem caused by their first set of rules. And this argument 
assumes that the exercise of power is always employed with the goal of mak-
ing society better in some way, as opposed to the goal of staying in power or 
rewarding political supporters and punishing political enemies. But for as long 
as men have had power over others, they have also had the potential to use 
that power to reward their friends and punish their enemies. And thus we 
have the final problem of excessive government control of the economy: the 
use of that power to abuse some economic actors.
In October 1929, the U.S. stock market fell dramatically, triggering several 
years of severe economic depression. In 1933, the new president, Franklin 
Roosevelt, and a new Congress had a mandate from the public to take dra-
matic measures to fix the economy. In the new government’s judgment, one 
of the main reasons the American economy continued to struggle was that 

Chapter 5 | Public and Private Decision Making
114
prices kept falling (a problem known as deflation), and the reason that they 
fell was because firms were competing excessively. Falling wages meant less 
willingness to buy goods and services, so the demand for all goods and ser-
vices and hence their prices fell, and falling prices meant businesses and farm 
owners went bankrupt. In the new government’s way of thinking, which many 
economic historians have disputed in recent years, this price-cutting increased 
unemployment and therefore caused wages to fall further, generating a vicious 
cycle. To break it, Congress empowered Roosevelt’s administration to get 
workers and companies to cooperate in setting prices so as to eliminate what 
was seen as harmful competition.
Unsurprisingly, this generated tremendous economic problems, none of which 
was anticipated by the people drawing up the price regulations. This element 
of the story is familiar to us from the discussion of Problem 2. However, the 
reaction of government officials is what is of interest here. The federal gov-
ernment established policing authorities to inspect businesses to make sure 
that the pricing rules were being followed—the government, in other words, 
sent cops around to check whether the prices businesses were charging were 
the correct ones. At least one merchant, the tailor Jacob Magid of Jersey 
City, spent 3 days of a 30-day sentence in jail for offering to dry-clean a suit  
for $0.35 instead of the government-mandated minimum price of $0.40.  
(The regulations he violated, which also cost him a $100 fine for his $0.05 
violation, were imposed by the State of New Jersey as reinforcement of the 
national price codes.) We do not know whether he emerged shaken or intimi-
dated by the experience, but upon leaving jail after the remainder of his sen-
tence was suspended, he pronounced the pricing rules “a good thing” and 
indicated he would comply with them.
The owners of one other business chose not to submit. The Schechter Poultry 
Corporation was a business owned by four Orthodox Jewish men, who ran a 
kosher butcher shop that among other things sold whole chickens. As part of 
the Roosevelt attempts to revive the economy, the Schechters had to operate 
their business consistent with something called the Code of Fair Competition 
for the Live Poultry Industry of the Metropolitan Area in and about the City 
of New York. Astonishingly, these rules prohibited customers from selecting 
their own chickens, which would strike most of us, I suspect, as a bad business 
practice for a butcher to follow, and which the brothers in particular felt vio-
lated their ethical duties to their customers. The right of customers to refuse 
specific birds was in fact part of the Jewish dietary laws, which the Schechters 
adhered to and which placed far more demanding obligations on them to 
satisfy their customers than any government rules.
Having to tell customers that they didn’t have the right to select individual 
birds, often under the eye of government inspectors who frequently visited 
their store, naturally hurt their business. Despite their years of formal educa-
tion, these government inspectors did not have the knowledge of particular 

Reasonably Simple Economics
115
circumstances and opportunities that a market economy harvests so effectively. 
One of the brothers, Joseph Schechter, once described one of the inspectors 
“by the name of Bob” as someone who “don’t know from a chicken. And I 
started into teaching him what a chicken is, and my man and myself teach him 
what a chicken is, what a rooster is.” Aaron Schechter described inspectors 
abusing his customers, saying of an inspector named Philip Alampi, “He told 
the customer that he is full of shit, and ‘I am the Code Authority, and I got 
a right to do anything I want, and if you don’t like it, get out.’” Later Aaron 
Schechter did manage to expel Alampi. He returned with a local policeman, 
and yet Aaron Schechter still refused to let the arbitrary bureaucrat, autho-
rized by the faraway ruling class in Washington, D.C., enter.21
At the trial of the brothers (and remember, people were being put on crimi-
nal trial here for allowing customers to select the chickens they wanted to 
buy), the idea of government abuse arising from its ignorance about the eco-
nomics of information was on display several times. The prosecutor asked 
Martin Schechter, “Your price is not very stable, is it?” (Remember, the goal 
of the government was to stop prices from falling.) Schechter replied, “The 
market isn’t stable… We got our prices according to what the market might 
be.” Prosecutors asked them who their “stockholders” were, a question that 
puzzled them, because there were only the brothers themselves operating 
without a formal contract among themselves or their suppliers. A business-
man who bought and sold chickens (known as a middleman, whose role will 
be examined in Chapter 7) named Louis Spatz had the following exchange 
with the prosecutor Walter Rice:
Rice:  You are an expert?
Spatz:  I am experienced but not an expert.
Rice:  You are not an expert on the effect of competitive conditions upon 
the prices of live poultry?
Spatz:  I am experienced—(he is cut off)
Rice:  Are you an expert?…
Spatz:  I am not an expert about anything.
…
Rice:  You have not studied agricultural economics?
Spatz: No, sir.
21This history of the Schechter brothers and their trials is taken from Amity Shlaes,  
The Forgotten Man: A New History of the Great Depression (New York: Harper Perennial, 
2008), Chapter 8.

Chapter 5 | Public and Private Decision Making
116
Rice:  Or any sort of economics?
Spatz: No, sir.
Rice:  What is your education?
Spatz: None, very little. In my business, I am the best economist.
Rice:  What is that?
Spatz: In my business I am the best economizer.
This is really a very striking exchange. Note the contrast between an expert, 
which to the prosecutor seems to mean someone with a lot of credentials 
and formal education that qualify him to say what the price of chicken ought 
to be, and the actual businessman Spatz’s idea of experience actually buying 
and selling chickens, which is where he gets his knowledge about what the 
prices of chickens in a particular set of circumstances ought to be. According 
to Amity Shlaes’ account of the trial cited in note 12, in order to make the 
poorly educated Schechter brothers look ignorant for the record, prosecutor 
Rice demanded to “have that word [economizer] spelled in the minutes, just 
as he stated it.”
The jury ultimately convicted them, and the judge fined them $7,425—a huge 
amount for those people in those times. Joseph Schechter got three months in 
jail,  Alex two, and the other two brothers one month each. But the brothers 
chose to fight, and what they were fighting for was a civil right. It was the right 
to peacefully pursue your goals in life through voluntary exchange with others 
in the market, and in doing so to be free from hindrance by a government at 
best motivated by unjustified confidence in its abilities, at worst by corrup-
tion or the desire to oppress.  This right is every bit as important in allowing 
people to live with dignity as the other more well-known civil rights that 
we properly celebrate. They appealed the case all the way to the Supreme 
Court. The Court ruled in their favor, deciding that the law authorizing the 
massive web of price regulation, the National Industrial Recovery Act, was 
unconstitutional.
Such things have happened in the United States, where regulation of people 
buying and selling in the spontaneous order is by world standards relatively 
restrained. But in other places, the degree of oppression and humiliation 
that citizens suffer from regulation of the market is considerably worse. On 
December 16, 2010, a fruit vendor in Tunisia named Mohamed Bouazizi was 
once again harassed, as he was frequently, by police, who accused him of not 
having a required permit to sell goods. Every day throughout the world, peo-
ple in such circumstances get out of this arrest by paying a bribe, but Bouazizi 
did not have the money. The police confiscated his scales and tossed his wares 
onto the ground. Bouazizi went to local authorities to complain and ask for 
his scale back, but could not get anyone who mattered to see him. Later that 

Reasonably Simple Economics
117
day, in desperation, he set himself afire on the street and died soon after. 
The result was angry protests that ultimately led to the ouster of Tunisia’s 
longtime dictator, which itself sparked what is now known as the Arab Spring 
movement.
The reason the police could harass this man literally just trying to go about 
his business was that Tunisia, like many developing countries, has an endless list 
of rules that it is very easy to knowingly or unknowingly violate. The reason 
they wanted to confront him with this rules violation (and they had many 
rules to choose from) was that they could make money by taking a bribe to 
look the other way. In countries like Tunisia there is thus an awful dynamic 
that has been established: government officials establish rules just to have the 
opportunity to make money by writing them a certain way or, at the level of 
the local police officer or bureaucrat, ignoring the rule. (Think about campaign 
contributions to members of Congress in exchange for manufacture of entry 
barriers or for providing access to taxpayer money that their competitors 
who do not lobby or contribute so effectively will not get.) This makes careers 
in “public service”—the presiding over the creation and auctioning off of laws 
and their enforcement—the most lucrative in the country, ensuring that the 
country’s best and brightest want to go into the bureaucracy and politics 
rather than start companies and create wealth.
The economist Gordon Tullock tells the story of the mystery of the popular-
ity of customs-clerk jobs in a particular developing country. Customs clerks 
in some sense do very little that is of value—all they do is check to see 
whether imported goods are allowed or not under a country’s (often very 
complicated) import restrictions and therefore decide whether people who 
desire those imported goods will be allowed to have them. And in the coun-
try Tullock mentions, these clerks have salaries that are extremely low. And 
yet they hold among the most desirable jobs in the country. To become a 
customs clerk one has to pass a very competitive examination, with perhaps 
only a few candidates out of every hundred passing every year. Many of those 
who fail simply wait until next year to try again, thus depriving the productive 
sector of the economy of their talents and effort during that time.
Precisely because these exams are so difficult, these people are among the best 
and brightest in the country, and so society pays the opportunity cost of them 
not actually creating wealth but merely presiding over its distribution. Why do 
such bright people try so hard to get jobs with such menial salaries? A big part 
of the answer is that the customs clerk owns a very powerful resource that is 
needed to obtain resources in this country—his permission. Like the owners 
of labor, skill, land, machines, and oil, economic theory predicts that the owner 
of this resource of permission will be likely to sell it to the highest bidder. In 
other words, he will only give it to those who pay the necessary bribes. Rules 
restricting exchange generate opportunities for politicians and bureaucrats 
to shake down citizen-supplicants who want either to get the rules written 

Chapter 5 | Public and Private Decision Making
118
in their favor (in the case of politicians, for example, by outlawing competi-
tion for those supplicants) or to allow these citizens to violate the rules. This 
creates an incentive to write ever more of these rules. Thus it was that the 
Roman historian Tacitus, writing in the second century A.D. about the collapse 
of the Roman Republic and its displacement by the Empire, could write of the 
late Republic, “And now bills were passed, not only for national objects but 
for individual cases, and laws were most numerous when the Commonwealth 
was most corrupt.” Laws were written, in other words, to reward and punish 
individuals who had or had not, respectively, paid the requisite bribe.22
Figure 5-1 provides some support for the idea that interference in the mar-
ketplace promotes abuse by government officials. Both axes measure data 
recorded by the World Bank. On the horizontal axis is an index of how many 
bureaucratic procedures are required overall to start a business, register a 
contract, and gain title to property. This is thus a measure of how many legal 
hoops citizens must jump through to do business with their fellow citizens. 
The vertical axis is the bank’s corruption measure of how effectively a coun-
try controls corruption, which generally ranges from –2 to 3, with a lower 
number indicating more corruption. The figure suggests strongly that more 
government procedures are associated with more corruption. Indeed, many of 
the world’s most corrupt countries are also among the world’s poorest, which 
would suggest support for the model just developed, in which when governing 
is too intrusive, too much activity is diverted toward trying to become some-
one with the power to prevent someone else from trading, which means that 
less trading and more government predation happens. This forces the coun-
try into a quagmire of low productivity and an extensive amount of wasteful 
transfer of wealth presided over by highly educated and ambitious politicians 
and bureaucrats.

Figure 5-1.  Corruption and government involvement in the economy

Chapter 5 | Public and Private Decision Making
120
The final and, I would suggest, most important danger of extensive govern-
ment intervention into the spontaneous order is that the rules developed to 
carry out the desired intervention empower government officials to abuse 
the citizenry and violate their most fundamental human rights. The power 
to regulate is the power to prevent people from using that which they own 
to make their way in the world, to achieve their goals in life, to provide for 
their families—the power to destroy, in other words. So, the road of rules and 
control is a dangerous one to start out on. As I note at the beginning of this 
chapter, government is as old as human society itself, and there are functions 
only it can perform. George Washington is supposed to have said that “a gov-
ernment is like fire, a handy servant, but a dangerous master.”
I end this chapter with a quote from the writer Richard Fernandez, who 
describes how the rules of politicians and bureaucrats—sometimes done 
with conceptions of noble public interest and sometimes done for purely 
selfish reasons—come to create the kinds of societies that lead to results like 
Mohamed Bouazizi ending his life for desperate lack of any other choice:
The common face of totalitarianism is not, as cinema often depicts, 
that of uber-Nazis marching in satanic rows, or of cultured madmen 
planning the extinction of millions with violin music softly seething 
in the background. Its quotidian face is one of petty, arbitrary, 
unappealable abuse. For the average man life under tyranny consists 
of being precisely zero in a society that can do anything — anything 
at all—to him.23
Answer to In-Text Question
5.1.	 Seniority-based promotion and pay prevents workers from 
competing against one another through lower salaries and 
working harder, making the lives of some of the workers 
(those wanting the most money for the least work) easier. 
Union advocates say that seniority-based promotion pro-
tects them from unfair behavior by management, which 
undoubtedly happens from time to time, despite its costs. 
But there are undeniable costs to promotion by seniority 
instead of productivity in terms of frustrating the ability 
to provide more of what consumers want and of allowing 
workers whose interests are different from that of union 
members to pursue them.

barriers, which claim seems more reasonable to you—that 
the amount of government-manufactured entry barriers is 
more determined by the demands of campaign donors or 
by government officials’ ability to use legal powers to supply 
these barriers in exchange for campaign donations?

entry barrier or, as they claim, incent them to produce more 
textbooks (or both)?

These are all examples of entry barriers. What are the barriers? What costs 
do they produce? What benefits might they produce? In the end, do you think 
the barriers have benefits that justify the costs?
5.5. NPR has an article31 about someone complaining about the 
power of the Internet merchant Amazon.com. Do Amazon’s 
tactics benefit anyone? Whom do they damage? Who is 
more likely to be more able to effectively make their case

tactics or the people who benefit from them?
5.6. This blog entry32 is a story about the government of Miami 
spending a large amount of money on Toyota Priuses that

caused this to happen and indeed caused the government to 
purchase a car like the Prius in particular?
5.7. This article33 is an occasionally comical story of the difficul-

rules themselves benefit?
5.8. Reason magazine has a story34 a about the licensing process 
for providers of in-home health care in Washington, D.C. In 
the article, the executive director of the D.C. Home Health 
Association is quoted as saying that the very low rate of 
approval for licenses is “like you saying to a certain extent 
that you have enough doctors in the District of Columbia 
so you won’t license any more doctors…You can’t do that 
really. No one ought to have the ability to do that. The mar-
ketplace will dictate that—if, in fact, doctors are not receiv-
ing enough clients. What will they do? They’ll go where they 
can find the opportunity.” To what extent is the “market” 
dictating the provision of home health care in D.C.? Given 
that doctors also must be licensed, to what extent is the 
“market” providing M.D.s (or not)?

Chapter 6 | Who Makes How Much, and Why
126
The last chapter noted the costs of government rearrangement of resources 
and imposition of restrictions on people’s freedom to trade with one another. 
And yet it must be admitted that such restrictions are common and are often 
imposed with some idea of improved justice in mind. Without question, one 
of the most frequent sources of belief in social injustice, and of social revolu-
tion itself, is the size of the gap in income and wealth between those who 
have more and those who have less. Widespread poverty has toppled many 
a dynasty in China and spawned revolutions with disastrously bloody conse-
quences there, in Russia, and elsewhere in the 20th century. In modern demo-
cratic societies, this belief has led to a vast growth in government regulation 
of and displacement of private activity in spheres such as medical care and 
the provision of retirement income. In the U.S., violence over who should 
do work and how much they should get for doing it is far from unknown—
it occurred in places like Chicago and the surrounding area,1 Rock Springs, 
Wyoming,2 and throughout the Northeast United States in the latter half of 
the 19th century and again in the 1930s. So it is worth exploring why people 
obtain the compensation they do in a market setting, so that we can better 
understand the consequences of using politics to do something about it.
The Market for Compensation
First, there are two terms that need to be distinguished: income and wealth. 
Wealth is simply a number, referring to the total amount of assets possessed—
things that have value in market exchange. In common usage, wealth includes 
things such as cash, physical property (homes, cars), land, and financial assets 
such as stocks and bonds. Add the tradable value of all that up and you have 
how much wealth a person has. Before proceeding further, though, it should be 
noted that there is one asset that is typically not counted as wealth, but by this 
definition should be counted: a person’s marketable skill. A person who pos-
sesses knowledge about how to design valuable pharmaceuticals but who is 
only 20 years old and hasn’t started engaging in this task yet clearly possesses 
a resource of immense value, but this is not usually included when people say 
how “wealthy” this person is. (The reason for this is that this ­component of 
the person’s wealth is not very liquid, a concept whose discussion is deferred 
until Chapter 11.) But no matter what you count and what you don’t, 
wealth is measured merely as a number—that person is worth $4 ­million, 
for example.
Income is a little different. It refers to a one-time or periodic receipt of new 
wealth, which can be spent immediately on a nice meal (in which case it

was not additional wealth for very long) or added to one’s stock of wealth  
(by being put in a bank, used to buy stocks, etc.). It often has a time compo-
nent to it—this person earns $40,000 a year, that person owns stocks that 
pay 3% dividends four times a year. But not always. If I receive $20,000 in cash 
from a deceased relative or win $10,000 in the lottery, many people would 
consider that income, although it is only received once, and legally it certainly 
qualifies as income, in the sense that you have to declare it on your taxes.
Definition
■
■
  Wealth is what you have, and income is what you get, usually for performing some 
task and often measured per period of time.
But most income is not received as the result of chance events like these. 
Most income is received in compensation for providing value to someone else 
in exchange. The landowner who receives income from renting property to a 
resident or a store owner is providing that person with a place to live or do 
business, and the rent he receives, like all prices, is determined by supply and 
demand and hence, in part, by the value of that land to the tenant when he 
can use it for the purpose he wishes to use it for. So too with labor income, 
which is a sizable part if not the outright majority of compensation for most 
people for much of their life span, not just in the United States but around the 
world. And it is important to remember that the market for labor looks like 
any other market, as Figure 6-1 shows.

Figure 6-1. The market for a particular kind of labor
As before, the equilibrium price (in this case, the price for labor, W*, which  
I call the wage) and the equilibrium quantity (in this case of workers, denoted N*, 
with N sort of standing for employment) is found where the supply curve and 
the demand curve intersect. The supply curve tells us how the amount of labor 

Chapter 6 | Who Makes How Much, and Why
128
that people are willing to supply varies with the wage, and the demand curve 
tells how much labor employers are willing to buy as the wage varies. The sup-
ply curve of labor is a function of how many alternatives workers have. People 
who have a spouse who is capable of earning quite a bit of money may demand 
a relatively high wage to induce them to come out of the home, and so their 
individual supply curve would be to the left. When there are very many workers 
capable of doing a particular job, the market supply curve for such workers is 
farther to the right, and the equilibrium wage is correspondingly lower.
The examples of labor-market violence from the United States cited earlier 
involved activities such as mining and manufacturing work, which in those 
days involved relatively little skill (in stark contrast to now, when operating 
advanced machinery often requires highly particular skills) and also occurred 
at a time of mass immigration. The result was that lots of workers were com-
peting for the same amount of work. Thus, we are not surprised that the 
equilibrium wage would be lower. In general, immigrants with a particular 
skillset will compete against domestic workers with the same skillset and 
hence lower their wages and their job opportunities. We are thus also not 
surprised that domestic workers frequently oppose immigration of workers 
who might compete against them, whereas employers support more open 
immigration. In short, the more competition there is to do a particular kind 
of work, the more elastic and farther to the right the supply curve is, thus the 
lower the equilibrium wage is, other things being equal.
But the demand for labor is also critical in determining compensation. 
Fundamentally, the demand for labor is a function of how much revenue a 
worker can generate for his employer. Indeed, a sufficient condition for an 
employer to be willing to hire a worker is that the worker’s wage be less than 
what economists call his marginal revenue product, which means “the amount 
that revenue for the business increases when that worker is hired.” One more 
assembly-line worker hired increases the amount of output coming off the 
line, one more professor hired means more students are taught, one more 
lawyer hired means more billable hours charged, and one more software engi-
neer hired increases the rate at which code is written and debugged. If hiring 
a worker brings more money in than the money required to pay all of his 
compensation (including benefits), hiring him makes profits go up.
As usual, what a worker is “worth” is not an absolute number but is context-
dependent. A worker with a college degree in a particular field and a particu-
lar set of work experiences will be more productive in some circumstances 
than in others, and hence employees in some circumstances will be willing to 
pay more than employers in others. We have already seen how supermodels 
who possess spectacular good looks not available to most of us make quite a 
bit of money and are relatively invulnerable to competition. It also turns out 
that the top female supermodels make significantly more money than the top 
male ones, so that even within the rarefied circle of extremely good-looking 

Reasonably Simple Economics
129
people, compensation can vary quite a bit depending on the particular circum-
stances of the market.
At my university (and, I suspect, at most), professors in departments like 
accounting and engineering earn significantly more money than professors 
in departments like English and history. Indeed, it is not uncommon for a 
newly hired professor in a field like computer science to make more money 
than someone with 20 years of experience in a field such as philosophy. The 
person who comes off worse in such comparisons is likely to invoke the idea 
of “fairness,” to say that he “deserves” more money, because he’s been there 
longer, because he’s older, etc. Of course, few of us can resist the temptation 
from time to time to believe that we deserve more than we are getting. But 
our supply/demand framework suggests that people do not get paid what they 
think they deserve—they get paid what other people think they deserve, given 
the alternatives those other people have.
Note
■
■
  You don’t get paid based on what you think you deserve. Rather, you get paid what others 
think you deserve based on the alternatives they have (like working willing current workers harder, 
using a machine instead of hiring you, hiring someone else, outsourcing your skills, etc.).
And if true, this plays out two ways. First, on the labor supply side, people with 
many and good alternatives will have high opportunity costs of time, so that 
their supply curve will be farther to the left than those with fewer and poorer 
alternatives. This is, I suspect, a big reason why accounting and engineering 
professors make more than philosophy and history professors do. Philosophy 
and history professors have a lot of expertise, but for many of them it is not 
expertise that people will pay a lot for outside the university setting. But 
people in some departments have skills that are very lucrative outside the 
ivory tower, and so to get them to work for the university, the administration 
has to pay them enough to offset that.
The idea that you get paid what other people think you deserve plays out 
on the demand side as well. First, I’ll introduce a new term: human capital, 
a perfectly good definition of which is skill that other people think is valuable. 
However, I will use the term human capital in addition to skill because capital 
suggests the idea of something that can grow and that one can invest in, 
not just something that one is born with. Some people are born smarter 
than others, but one can invest in marketable skills through formal educa-
tion, on-the-job experience, building up a network of sales contacts, and 
so forth.
Personality traits are also part of one’s stock of human capital—risk takers 
and people who have gifts of persuasion may earn more than others without 
these traits. And it is important to actually distinguish between skill and human 

Chapter 6 | Who Makes How Much, and Why
130
­capital in one critical way: skill is not the same thing as marketable skill. The 
ability to recite Moby Dick from memory while riding a unicycle is undoubt-
edly a rare skill (as of now, there may not be a single person in the world who 
possesses it), but it is not necessarily a skill that anyone is willing to pay for.
Instead of referring to a person’s human capital as more or less, it is perhaps 
better to refer to it as more valuable or less valuable. (Even then, it would be 
more accurate to say more or less valuable in a particular situation.) People who 
have more valuable human capital in a particular relationship with any potential 
buyer of their labor will earn more than people who have less valuable human 
capital who are in that same relationship. So, some of the discussion about how 
to help people earn more money becomes more nuanced. Should we provide 
college education for more people to raise the average standard of living? It is 
true that on average, those with bachelor’s degrees make more than those who 
only went to high school, but it is also true that not all bachelor’s degrees are 
equally valuable in the marketplace. If a person emerges from college heavily in 
debt and with an education that makes him unattractive to those making deci-
sions about filling jobs in which the recent graduate has interest, it will not help 
the graduate to complain that he “deserves” a better-paying job. Any employer 
who must earn profits to stay in business will hire employees based on what 
the employees can do for them—on how productive their human capital is 
when applied to the task the employer wants done.
Can we make any general statements about what kinds of human capital are 
“more valuable”? It is easy to be pessimistic. Why does one artist become 
popular while another languishes in obscurity? That seems to be a function 
only of vagaries in public taste. It is possible to copy the style of painters like 
Pablo Picasso or Claude Monet (and indeed popular artists often talk about 
who their “influences” are), but why the original source of influence becomes 
influential to begin with is largely a mystery. Yet many things qualify as gen-
eral human capital, which means widely applicable in a wide variety of tasks that 
employers will rate favorably. Proper use of the English language, for example, is 
valued much more highly than improper use in a wide variety of jobs. Fluency 
in a foreign language might not be important in as many tasks, but is likely to 
be in more than a few. Other important elements of relatively general human 
capital include the habits of working hard, dedication to task, and showing up 
on time. A person who has these habits may well, in the expectation of the 
employer, have the potential to be a much more productive employee than 
someone with a particular university degree.
Specific human capital, in contrast, is a highly particular ability that is only valuable in 
one or a few tasks. When thinking about specific human capital, it is important to 
remember that many people pursue goals that have nothing to do with money. 
The starving artist is someone who is content to earn a little money doing 
something he loves, and I (and very many others) believe that it is much more 
important to have a job you love than a job you hate that pays a lot more money. 
People thus may acquire this specific human capital without expecting to make  

Reasonably Simple Economics
131
a great living.  But with regard to monetary compensation, specific human capital—
a degree in biology, work experience repairing computers (other than whatever 
value it signals in terms of doing work responsibly), knowledge of Java program-
ming—will make much more difference in some tasks than others. Outside its 
appropriate environment, such capital is of little use.
Nowadays many people, lamentably, obtain PhDs in fields with little value 
attached to them by employers outside academia. Given that the number of 
jobs available in universities is much smaller than the number of people with 
those PhDs, the inevitable result is that those people compete the level of 
compensation down and become willing to take jobs as adjunct faculty (teach-
ing one or two courses a term for minimal pay) in lieu of having the sort of 
full-time tenure-track job that they expected in graduate school. On the other 
hand, people with such unusual skills as knowing how to drive a Zamboni3 
have been able to parlay that into high-paying jobs as child-care workers.  
Elite programmers can write video-game software or create data-processing 
tools sold to millions of people. If this is a sufficiently rare skill, the people who 
do it will make a lot of money.
Ditch digging is not morally any less worthy than writing software, but it may 
be a skill possessed by larger numbers of people, and it is not a highly special-
ized skill—what one has to learn to do it well is modest. (This is not the same 
thing as being willing to exert the immense physical effort needed to do it well, 
which might be rarer.) Those who do it are subject to much more competi-
tion—the demand for their individual services, in other words, is much more 
elastic. Thus those who do it are easily replaceable, and over time competition 
should drive their wages down, in accordance with the indifference principle. 
This will change if machinery is created that allows many ditches to be dug by 
one person operating it, which in many ways has already happened because of 
mechanically powered construction equipment. That has raised the marginal 
product and hence the wages of ditch diggers. In that case, some ditch diggers 
will be replaced, but the ones who stay will make more, and more ditches will 
be dug thanks to the lower opportunity costs of digging one.
So, why do people make what they make? In short, because of supply of and 
demand for what they can do. Demand curves reflect the value of what we 
are being asked to purchase, and the demand for labor reflects the value of 
that labor not in some philosophical sense but to the person—an employer, 
typically—who might contract to buy it. (The value of human capital, in other 
words, is context dependent.) Supply curves reflect the ease with which more 
of a particular kind of human capital can be procured and the willingness of 
people to offer more labor in response to a higher wage. The market for 
labor, in other words, is like the market for anything else.

Power in the Employer-Employee Relationship
Despite this, much regulation of the labor market comes from the belief that 
in the employer-employee relation, it is the employer who has most of the 
“power.” In this view, employers can dictate wages to workers who are forced 
to accept them, and so workers need protection to ensure they make enough 
to live on. These protections include minimum-wage laws, the ability to require 
a company to negotiate all labor contracts through a union, guaranteed annual 
vacations, etc. This belief that employers have “power” and employees don’t 
results in vastly different treatment of employers and employees under labor 
law. Under federal law, for example, in some contexts it is illegal to lay large 
numbers of workers off without providing six months’ notice, whereas an 
employee need not provide six months’ notice before quitting. Similarly, it is 
illegal for employers to discriminate against employees—by paying them less, 
refusing to hire them, or firing them—on grounds of race, sex, or age, yet 
employees are perfectly free to refuse to work for someone whose race, sex, 
or age they do not like. 
Questioned about this distinction, people (or at least professors in other dis-
ciplines at my university with whom I have discussed this question) generally 
answer that the two parties are not the same. Employers are said to have the 
power in the bargaining relationship with their employees, and employees are 
said to be correspondingly vulnerable. By the definition of power used earlier, 
no one, when applying for a job, has power over anyone else. Both parties are 
free to negotiate over the terms of employment, and both parties are free 
to reject terms they find unacceptable, leaving them in the same situation as 
before. In fact, employees with relatively valuable human capital are able to 
use the alternative opportunities it generates to extract more compensation 
from employers all the time. The most obvious example is in professional 
sports, where players who are free to negotiate with other teams can use 
that freedom as leverage to extract higher contract offers from their cur-
rent one. Of course, professional athletes are a very rare breed, and so a 
reader might reasonably object that this is not a fair example. But other 
people whose human capital is relatively inelastically demanded can also be 
said to possess most of the room for maneuver in a bargaining relation-
ship. University professors, for example, frequently take job offers from other 
universities into the offices of their deans and tell them that they will take 
the job if they don’t get a raise. (Legend has it that some professors actually 
go out and seek job offers precisely to use them to use them as bargaining 
leverage back home.) Software engineers in Silicon Valley routinely quit their 
jobs to look for something better. Research suggests that every month in 
the U.S. the percentage of Americans who change jobs within a field is about 

Reasonably Simple Economics
133
3.2% and another 3.5% change fields at least to some degree.4 Moving from 
one job to another frequently represents the exit from something worse to 
something better.
Of course, it is a different matter if you have been working at a car factory for 
20 years and the factory closes. Workers in this situation have spent 20 years 
accumulating human capital highly specific to the job they have been doing—
human capital that (for the same reason the factory closed) is not likely to 
be highly valued elsewhere, except perhaps in factories outside the country. 
If the workers are older, other potential employers will fear that they will not 
stay long in a new job and that their human capital (including physical strength, 
which is a component of human capital) is diminishing because of age. Many 
employers may be willing to offer such workers jobs, although such employers 
may be very rare locally, meaning that unless the employee is willing to move he 
will not be able to find such work. Even if he does, it is possible that compen-
sation is much less than in his previous job. Without question, the mismatch 
between his specific human capital and what is currently most valued by the 
market leaves him much worse off. It is also possible that he and his coworkers 
may retain their jobs if they are willing to take substantial pay cuts.
This is not an exercise of power, but rather a reflection of changed market 
conditions. New ways have been found to bring valued goods to consumers at 
lower cost—for example, producing in foreign countries where workers have 
lower opportunity costs of time.  The alternative is not preserving an obsolete 
ideal of “good jobs at good wages.” As noted earlier, wages are purely a func-
tion of the alternatives workers have and the value to employers of the human 
capital possessed by particular workers. Indeed, some manufacturing jobs pay 
very high wages, precisely because workers have learned how to operate 
very productive machinery and/or possess high spatial-reasoning abilities that 
mean that workers themselves contribute a lot to the company’s bottom 
line.5 Workers in places like South Carolina or Ohio who are more than ten 
times as productive as workers in places like China and Mexico can earn ten 
times the wage and still have a job.  And often this productivity depends on 
highly specific human capital. 
Workers who possess such human capital often possess most of the bargain-
ing leverage in their negotiations with their employers, whether they super-
vise complicated machines or design software concepts. (The actual writing of 
software code, as opposed to coming up with the idea for a game interface,   
for example, might be a fairly routine task that could be outsourced some-
where else.) In short, the key to earning a high salary lies in being indispensable 
(or nearly so, since nothing is perfectly inelastically demanded). The closer to 
indispensable you are, the more the leverage is yours and not your employer’s.

(Note, though, that in the long term, people who sell their labor are in the 
same competitive position as people who sell anything else—subject to a 
greater degree of competition than in the short run. But a person with a 
­continual gift for creating new forms of near-indispensability will also be able 
to receive high rewards over a long period of time.)
In that sense, much of the history of labor-management (and labor-owner) rela-
tions in the U.S. is poorly taught and misunderstood. From the 1870s–1890s, 
and again in the 1930s, there was a great amount of often violent conflict 
between workers who abandoned their jobs over demands for higher pay (that 
is, went on strike) and the employers who had to answer to their customers 
by getting their product out on time at a good price. During those times, both 
because manufacturing was far more standardized and easier to learn than 
now and because of waves of new workers coming in from farms and for-
eign countries, workers were a dime a dozen, easily replaceable. The violence 
between workers and owners, which involved the police, the military/National 
Guard, private security agencies like the Pinkertons,6 and unionized workers 
themselves almost invariably followed the same pattern: workers struck or 
wanted to strike, employers hired workers who were willing to work on bet-
ter terms than strikers demanded, and violence was carried out or threatened 
against the strikebreakers, whom unionists dismissed as “scabs.”
Contrary to the argument that labor-market violence was initiated by employers 
who wanted to “bust unions,” research suggests that the overwhelming majority 
of court cases involving violence or threatened violence between workers and 
owners during this time exhibited this pattern: actual or threatened violence 
by laborers against those who wished to work, in an attempt to restrict com-
petition.7 Also contrary to the labor-is-powerless story, wages generally rose 
throughout most of this period of intense conflict (the Great Depression was 
an exception), the more so after the increase in labor supply slowed down with 
the decline in movement from the farms to cities and the imposition in 1924 
of sharp limits on immigration. (These immigration limits may well have been 
unwise, despite their beneficial effects of restriction of labor supply for some 
Americans. Not only did they raise prices for consumers because of restricted 
competition for workers, they also deprived Americans of immigrants’ entre-
preneurship, ingenuity, and new ideas. But that is a separate question.)

The Distribution of Income
The title of this section is actually a horrible one, but I use it anyway because 
it is so common in public discourse. The phrase—especially when used in 
a context like What can we do about the distribution of income?—implies that 
“income” is a cake baked in an oven in City Hall, which politicians remove and 
take out onto the steps before cutting it up and “distributing” it to the grateful 
populace. But again, ignoring anomalous one-time circumstances such as slot-
machine winnings or inheritances, income is generally provided as compensa-
tion for the provision of valuable services to others, with the degree of value 
context dependent as usual. It is thus unavoidably true that at any moment 
in time, income—whether it comes from current labor services provided or 
as interest payments on loans made in the past or as investment returns for 
having provided capital at a critical juncture in a company’s growth—flow in 
larger amounts to some than to others, based on the value to others of what 
they have been able to provide in market transactions.
Thinking about “income distribution” this way means that data on it must be 
interpreted with some care. First, income ultimately accrues to individuals. 
Individuals, of course, earn compensation for the labor they supply, but even 
income that accrues to a business is ultimately distributed to individuals. These 
individuals can be the company’s employees, from the CEO to the assembly-
line worker, salesperson, middle manager, or custodial staff. Individuals can also 
include shareholders, who receive dividend payments on the stock shares they 
own (more on this in Chapter 7) or lenders who receive interest payments 
based on contracts they have signed with the business. But the U.S. federal 
government often publishes income data as “family income” or “household 
income.”
The trouble with these statistics is that households and families vary by size. 
Three generations living in the same home are, from the point of view of 
government statistics, identical to a young single person who is living alone 
just one year after graduating from college and still working in his first job. 
We would not necessarily expect people of the same age or with different 
numbers of children and adults of working and non-working age to earn the 
same income, and as the proportion of households of different kinds in the 
population changes, “median household income” should change as well.
Indeed, if the salary of young people in their 20s rises enough to allow them 
to move out of their parents’ home and live with roommates or alone, aver-
age household income may actually decline despite a higher standard of liv-
ing, reflected in the ability of young singles to afford their own household. 
In addition, one must take into account the changing age structure of the 
population even at the individual level, because people’s salaries (there are 
many exceptions, of course) tend to rise throughout their 20s, 30s, 40s, and 
into their 50s as they accumulate human capital through work experience. 

Chapter 6 | Who Makes How Much, and Why
136
Then, as retirement approaches, people begin to ease off accumulating human 
capital (because there is a shorter period of time to earn the revenue neces-
sary to justify the cost of accumulating it) and suffer the negative salary effects 
of physical and cognitive depreciation. That is a fancy way of saying people in 
their late 50s and 60s generally find it more physically and mentally demand-
ing to work hard than people in their mid-20s. (With seeming complete ran-
domness, the government also counts some government transfer programs in 
calculating the distribution of income, but not others. Some in particular that 
are targeted to the poor are not counted.)
And people can be substantially mobile within the distribution of income 
across generations. From the 1970s through 2002, 63% of people without a 
college degree and 74% of people with a college degree earned more in real 
terms than their parents. For people in the bottom 20% of the income distri-
bution, the figures were 81% and 96%. (Across all quintiles—20% slices—of 
the income distribution, for people with and without college degrees, only 
those in the top 20% who possessed no college degree did not out-earn their 
parents at the same age.)8 Downward mobility, to be sure, is not unknown 
either. The researchers defined falling out of the middle class as growing up 
in a household where the adults’ earnings were in the 30th to the 70th per-
centiles of the income distribution in the past, but were now below the 30th 
percentile. Among the most important factors that have been identified are: 
becoming divorced, widowed, or separated, or never marrying (especially 
men); failing to get education beyond high school; scoring poorly on tests of 
reading comprehension, math, and word knowledge; and serious drug use. 
Among ethnic and sexual categories, black men were also significantly more 
likely to drop out of the middle class, and white men were more likely to than 
white women.9
It has long been known that single-parent households are disproportionately 
represented in the poorest segment of the income distribution, and married 
families in the highest. Those in the poorest 20% are also less likely to work 
full-time, while those in the top 20% are far more likely to do so; a similar 
disparity exists for total hours worked. Americans at the 20th percentile of 
the distribution in 2006 (those who earn more income than only 20% of the 
population) had just over 12 years of education on average, whereas those 
at the 80th percentile (earning more than 80% of the population) had over 
16 years of education.

I cite these statistics—which indicate the role of choice in outcome—not to 
assess blame, but merely to note that employers offer higher compensation to 
those who produce more for them. Some circumstances (for example, being 
in a single-parent household) substantially increase the difficulty of accumulat-
ing either education or on-the-job training, both of which improve produc-
tivity, as well as make it more difficult to work extended or irregular hours. 
Those who are married can benefit from two incomes and from specialization 
in what economists who study families call household production and market 
work (that is, one spouse concentrates more on household work, the other 
more on earning money). In other words, there are reasons why people earn 
what they earn that do not necessarily signal grand cosmic injustice.
Having said that, it would be foolish to claim that such factors entirely explain 
who earns what. Major economic changes can certainly catch significant 
percentages of the population unprepared. Under those circumstances, the 
people who are responsible for creating or who are well prepared for those 
changes do better, and the people whose work is made obsolete do worse. 
People who create web-based mapping apps gain immensely from their cre-
ativity, and the people who have worked for years producing the hardcover 
version of the Rand McNally Road Atlas lose out. This is unavoidable if we want 
to enable people to do more with less, to live better than those who came 
before us. However, those whose investments in specific human capital are 
now less valuable are undeniably hurt by this change, at least until they acquire 
human capital that is more valuable under the new circumstances. Insuring 
against the negative consequences of such adverse change (from the point of 
view of those workers, not the whole society) would probably require that a 
person invest thoroughly in more general human capital such as high-quality 
English, fluency in other languages, a solid record of achievement and reliability 
that can be documented for future potential employers, etc. This is the kind 
of human capital valuable in a wide variety of jobs. Having a lot of it makes it 
easier to find a new one.
In a dynamic, truly progressive society, change is constant, and so are fluc-
tuations in income distribution. Insuring people against the consequences of 
progress while allowing that progress to play out primarily requires two ingre-
dients: the widespread provision of very general human capital and the lack 
of legal or cultural barriers to entry in the new fields on the rise. Examples 
of the former include the provision of universal basic schooling; examples of 
the latter include ending the ability of competitors to get the government to 
kneecap their competition and legally limit certain jobs to certain arbitrarily 
chosen people. Historically, such practices have included the feudalistic prac-
tice of passing on trades from father to son. The origin of last names such 
as Smith, Carter, Baker and Dyer lies in the tasks once associated with these 
names, and the intimate tying of who your parents were to what you do was 
also the cornerstone of the Indian caste system, which still exists in residual 

Chapter 6 | Who Makes How Much, and Why
138
form in rural India even today. But the modern-day equivalent of these restric-
tions exists in the entry barriers outlined in Chapter 5, which lower social 
mobility.
Despite the inevitability of income non-uniformity (a better word than equality, 
which suggests a morally desirable state of affairs), the state of income “dis-
tribution” is frequently seen as an indictment of a society, and governments 
across the world, as noted previously, take substantial steps to try to dampen 
it. Most notably, in the name of such distributive “justice,” it is common for 
people to advocate that those who earn the most income pay a vastly dispro-
portionate share of taxation. Yet as we saw in Table 5-1, it is not clear that 
such policies are effective. Among the countries listed in the table, only France 
and Ireland take a higher percentage of taxation from the top 30% of earners 
than the U.S., yet income distribution at any moment in time is likely to be 
far more non-uniform in the U.S. than in almost every country in that table 
(although it is perhaps hard to tell, given the transfer programs that are not 
counted in U.S. calculations). A great many things besides tax law affect the 
momentary distribution of income—age structure, immigration, and the rate 
of overall economic dynamism, just to name a few.
The Economics of  Taste-Based Discrimination
Once upon a time, discrimination was a word with overwhelmingly positive 
connotations. People spoke approvingly of a person with discriminating tastes. 
That usage still exists, but if the only thing you hear today is that a person 
discriminates, your impression is not likely to be a good one. The original 
meaning has value in one of the two ways economists speak of discrimination, 
in that the person who discriminates is the one who makes an effort based on 
group traits to discard that which is less valuable in favor of choosing only that 
which is more valuable—for example, to avoid less productive workers and 
choose only more productive ones. This kind of choice is known as statistical 
discrimination.
But first we must take the uglier sense of the term. When people say that an 
employer discriminates on the basis of race, sex, sexual orientation, and so 
on, what is meant? (The same framework applies to landlords who refuse to 
rent or businesspeople who refuse to sell to members of certain groups, but 
I will speak of employers, because this is the kind of discrimination that most 
preoccupies the public.) Presumably what is meant is that the discriminator 
refuses to hire people from the disfavored group, or perhaps he hires them 
in limited numbers but pays them less (as was common in the post-Civil War 
U.S. for black Americans).

Reasonably Simple Economics
139
In yet more testimony to its usefulness, our supply/demand model can be 
used to think productively about this discrimination based on raw dislike, 
which is usually called taste-based discrimination. Consider the adjusted ­version 
of Figure 6-2.

Figure 6-2. The market for a particular kind of labor, with taste-based discrimination

The demand curve simply labeled Demand is the same as in Figure 6-1 but 
now reflects only employers who do not discriminate, and is for members of 
the disfavored group only. Discriminating employers, on the other hand, have 
a lower demand curve for members of this group. Their lower demand curve 
means that the discriminating employer is less willing to pay for any level of 
workers than the non-discriminating one. Why? Because his monetary gain—
the productivity his workers generate—is partially offset because he dislikes 
them. Although at equilibrium, non-discriminating employers are willing to 
hire N* workers and pay them W*, to persuade non-discriminating employers 
to hire that amount they must be allowed to pay W* – z, with z represent-
ing the offsetting distaste discriminating employers have for their workers 
from the disfavored group. If there were only discriminating employers, they 
would pay a lower wage WD (the D standing for discriminating) and hire only 
the number ND of workers. If there are two separate labor markets, then 
workers caught in the discriminatory one will earn less and be hired less (or 
perhaps not at all, depending on the intensity of the employer’s discriminatory 
tastes). Because this is more or less the common conception of taste-based 
employment discrimination, the model seems like a reasonable one.
But is this outcome likely to prevail over the long term? Discriminating 
employers are paying workers of equal productivity lower wages. Based on 
the indifference principle, we would expect those excess returns to employers 

Chapter 6 | Who Makes How Much, and Why
140
to be competed away—for workers, in other words, to gradually be paid more 
until they are getting paid what their human capital makes them worth in 
this industry. The lesson? Free competition is a powerful force against taste-based 
discrimination. Is it guaranteed to eliminate all taste-based discrimination? Of 
course not. Compensation gaps having only to do with fundamental sex, race, 
and other differences10 can exist, but there is an extensive history of competi-
tion eroding them.
During the brief interval between the end of the Black Codes, mentioned 
in Chapter 5, and the departure of Reconstruction soldiers, blacks in the 
former Confederacy saw their wages grow significantly faster than those of 
whites, despite facing widespread white racism. One of the most notorious 
legal cases in American history is Plessy v. Ferguson, which some Americans 
have heard of but whose details, lamentably, almost none know. The facts of 
the case were that railroads had begun, for efficiency reasons (lower costs, 
customer desires), to start running integrated first-class cars, but this practice 
was later banned by Louisiana’s Jim Crow laws. The railroad then purposely 
had a man of mixed race but classified as “black” under Louisiana law defy the 
law demanding segregation of railroad cars by sitting in a whites-only cabin, to 
set up a test case. The case went all the way to the U.S. Supreme Court, which 
ruled that separate but equal public accommodations were constitutional.  
So, the facts of the case were that a business wanted to break down racial 
barriers, but the governments of the South, whose regulatory power had been 
captured by white racists, wouldn’t allow it. It was 70 years before the federal 
government, through the civil-rights legislation of the 1960s, not only over-
turned Jim Crow laws but banned discrimination in public accommodation—
laws that may well have turned out to be unnecessary had competition been 
allowed to follow its course.
In India, with a long history of harsh social and occupational segregation on 
the basis of their jajmani or caste system, economic reform in the 1980s and 
1990s that loosened the government’s limits on competition opened many 
opportunities to historically excluded castes.11 And during Britain’s colonial 
rule in what is now Malaysia and Singapore, people flocked to those places from 
China, despite a complete lack of voting or indeed any political rights, because 
local courts, operating under British law, effectively protected their rights 
to make contracts and buy and sell property—to compete, in other words. 
This was in stark contrast to the situation that prevailed among their ethnic  
compatriots back in China. People are black, white, brown, red, and yellow, but 
money (at least American money) is all green. Give people an alternative to

high-cost accommodation of discriminatory tastes, and people—entrepreneurs 
and customers—will grab it in the pursuit of money. Taste-based discrimina-
tion is extremely vulnerable to the power of the market.

  Taste-based discrimination is more difficult to practice with more intense competition 
(among businesses to hire workers, among landlords to rent to tenants, and so on).
Statistical Discrimination
I know from personal experience that when universities post an opening for 
a new young professor, they are very likely to receive over 100 applications. 
How to give them all the attention they deserve? It is very difficult, because of 
the deadline for decision making (applicants want to be informed in time to tie 
up their affairs where they currently live) and because the time taken by the 
professors making the decision has an opportunity cost—they must teach, do 
research, do dreary committee work, and so forth. The professors’ task is to 
devote time until the marginal cost of another minute going over the pile of 
applications (a cost that is increasing, because time is being diverted from ever 
more valuable alternate uses) has caught up to the marginal benefit. The mar-
ginal benefit is likely to be falling, because one wants to hire the applicant likely 
to be the most productive by whatever criteria the department doing the 
hiring is using, but one is also becoming ever more familiar with the applicant 
pool as one spends more time on the task. At some point, in other words, 
more time spent reading files and discussing applicants is likely to be not 
worth it. Is this equilibrium amount of time likely to be one that leads to every 
publication of every applicant being read and every reference checked out? 
Not likely. Instead, shortcuts will be employed. Candidates who have already 
published research articles in excellent journals, who have solid evidence of 
excellent teaching, and who have degrees from first-rate universities are likely 
to get a lot of attention; others will get very little. And the hiring committee 
here is actually doing something that has a disreputable connotation—they 
are stereotyping. It is possible that the best candidate lies in the pile of dis-
carded applications, among those candidates with degrees from second-tier 
schools and no evidence so far of excellence in teaching or research. But it is 
less likely, perhaps much less likely, and given scarcity of time, choices must be 
made about whom to interview.
Employers almost always engage in stereotyping. They look at previous work 
experience, quality of the university attended, testimonials by others, and other 
factors. Universities, too, stereotype when they try to pick the students who 
are likely to succeed there. They look at standardized test scores and read 
the students’ essays and make their choices accordingly.  (Which components 

Chapter 6 | Who Makes How Much, and Why
142
of the applicant’s package best predict his ultimate success, and the extent 
to which standardized test scores in particular do, is an active controversy.) 
Economists refer to this practice not as stereotyping, although it is that, but as 
statistical discrimination—the use of categories an individual belongs to as sources 
of information about the individual. The definition suggests a certain unfairness—
why should a job applicant be judged by, say, his graduation from a particu-
lar university when he has his own individual productivity? But search time is 
not free, and at some point continuing to search becomes too burdensome. 
Employers use shortcuts to save costly time.
The kinds of information from which statistical discrimination is built have 
surprising range. A friend of mine who owns his own business, which at any 
time has several employees, has told me of receiving applications for job open-
ings that list obscene-sounding e-mail addresses for correspondence, contain 
harshly critical remarks about former employers (and in one case, even an 
announcement in the application letter that the applicant was suing a former 
employer), and have cover letters riddled with grammatical and spelling errors. 
My friend is convinced, not without reason, that on average applicants with 
these characteristics are likely to be less productive than those without them.
But when people use group membership such as race or sex instead of ­college 
attended or GPA or grammatical quality of the candidate’ materials to statis-
tically discriminate, people object. This is probably because one is born into 
these former categories, whereas GPA and other non-innate characteristics 
can be affected by individual effort. But if racial groups and sexes differ by 
productivity, these characteristics are informative, and it would be foolish to ignore 
them completely. To be sure, they may not be very informative. But if the pile of 
applications is high enough, any information may have to enter the calculation.
It is important to say at this point that these group differences need not be 
genetic differences. A study by Duke University researchers generated an 
astonishing amount of controversy by showing that black students, as well as 
admits of all races who were children of Duke alumni, had a much higher 
chance of switching out of demanding majors in the sciences and economics. 
The authors found that the entire gap was explained by differences in academic 
preparation, and was in the case of black students unrelated to racial category 
per se. On the other hand, there is a vast scientific literature, for example, 
generally but not unanimously supporting the idea that men take more risks 
than women. (Think of the different driving habits of women and men.) Men 
are also more prone to violence. Why do these differences exist? The profit-
maximizing business owner does not care. He is not doing social science and 
cares only that they exist, not why. It is possible that ethnic group membership 
or sex will carry weight in the decision to offer a job, just as graduating from 
Harvard or having a high GPA does.
Negative stereotypes of groups exist all over the world, toward ethnic Malays 
in Malaysia and Singapore, who on average are less economically successful than 

Reasonably Simple Economics
143
Chinese in those countries, and in India, where stereotyping against members 
of lower castes exists. But stereotypes need not be negative:  Thomas Sowell 
cites the examples of Mohawk Indians in New York, who have a reputation 
for skill in the construction trade in New York City. Gardeners in Los Angeles 
once included many Japanese and now are dominated by Latinos. Insurance 
companies make money off statistical discrimination by giving female and 
older drivers more favorable auto insurance rates than the young and male 
(especially young men), and not without reason: males 16–25 in the U.S. are 
by far the likeliest to have an accident or get a ticket. (Insurance companies, 
which only pay out in the event of an accident, of course use a history of get-
ting ticketed, even without causing an accident, as yet another layer of statisti-
cal discrimination.) Women also pay lower life insurance rates because they 
are less likely than men to die young.12 There are of course many men who 
will not have accidents, and many women who will have one or more, but   
(in conjunction with other information such as type of car owned, neighbor-
hood of residence, etc.) insurance companies have discovered that the sex of 
the insured is informative with regard to the expected costs to the company 
of taking on the policyholder. For women, this statistical edge results in a 
positive stereotype. According to the Scandinavian insurance company Tryg, 
Danish people on average are much worse skiers than Norwegians,13 which 
generates interesting questions discussed further in Problem 6.4 later in this 
chapter. So is it really a surprise that groups differ in ways that affect the 
human capital they bring to market on average, even if no individual in the 
group necessarily has those traits, positive or negative?
In sum, statistical discrimination is unlike taste-based discrimination in that it 
is something done not in opposition to but in the service of making money. 
Unfortunately, it is for that reason harder to displace than taste-based dis-
crimination. Unless the group-based differences vanish, the only way to escape 
taste-based discrimination is for the stereotypers to come up with ways to 
more closely tie productivity information to the individual. The more an 
employer (or landlord, or insurance-policy underwriter) knows about a par-
ticular individual, the less information is imparted at the margin by group 
membership. In a perfect world, every employer would know every applicant’s 
productivity with certainty. But “perfect world” here means “costless informa-
tion,” and that is a world that can never be. Banning statistical discrimination in 
the face of costly information will lead to worse decision making—employees 
on average will be less productive, admitted freshmen will perform on average 
worse in school, etc. But because group membership, whether the group is

144
“black females” or “Harvard graduates,” is imperfectly informative, there are 
always incentives to develop new individual-specific measures of productivity, 
especially productivity and skills tests.14
Note
■
■
  Statistical discrimination is harder to reduce through competition than taste-based 
discrimination, precisely because it is done to try to increase profits.
There is now more good news (at least from the employer’s point of view): 
many job applicants have left footprints all over the Internet, which employers 
can readily access to find out information about these applicants that is infor-
mative regarding their likely productivity. The bad news is that at least some 
of this information is damaging. My business-owner friend I mentioned earlier 
reports seeing online pictures of applicants passed out from excessive alcohol 
consumption or with captions like “**** yeah, it’s 4/20” (a date that apparently 
has grand significance in the marijuana subculture). One need not rely on ste-
reotypes about young men or graduating from a “party school” after finding 
individual-specific information of that sort. Note that individuals too can try 
to disentangle themselves from stereotypical judgments—or, more accurately, 
associate themselves with more favorable ones—by dressing for job inter-
views or, in a broader context, adopting the public norms of majority culture. 
Many economists view “assimilation” by immigrants and members of minority 
groups as a way of persuading evaluators that they do not share the negative 
features that these evaluators statistically associate with their group.
Tip
■
■
  The more precise an employer’s information is about a particular job applicant’s expected 
productivity, the less he needs to rely on statistical discrimination. In the Internet era, very specific 
information about most individuals is available, and not all of it is flattering. So think twice before 
uploading that picture; it may be there forever.
Who Makes What, by Ethnicity and Sex
As just noted, there are indeed ethnicity- and sex-based differences in income, 
not just in the contemporary U.S. but in every society in history. According 
to some estimates,15 adjusted for cost of living, the group of people who live

doing what Google wants done.

in the Western states have the lowest standard of living in the U.S., and those 
who live in the Northeast have the highest. The group of people in the sixth 
decade of their lives (that is, in their 50s) earn more than the group in the third 
decade. But of course the group membership that draws the most attention 
are differences by race, ethnicity, and sex. Two kinds of comparisons are par-
ticularly popular: what members of non-Hispanic white (NHW) males make 
compared to males from other groups, and what women make compared to 
men. Figures 6-3 through 6-5, based on data from the Current Population 
Survey of the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, show annual earnings for various 
groups relative to NHW males and NHW females, and male/female earnings 
for the racial groups officially designated by the U.S. government (B = black,  
A = Asian, H = Hispanic, M = male, F = female).

The definition of earnings in the government statistics used here includes 
wage compensation, which is most of compensation for most people, as 
well as investment income. The figures collectively tell three stories. First, 
Asian males and females have approximately the same earnings as, respec-
tively, NHW males and females. (Asian females actually slightly out-earn NHW 
females.) Second, women make less than men, although the ratios of female 
to male compensation within each racial/ethnic group have been rising. Third, 
black females have seen their earnings rise to very close to those of NHW 
females, although progress stopped in the early 2000s. Fourth, Hispanic males 
and females have seen their wages rise very little relative to those of NHW 
males and females.
So why do average earnings differ when we divide the population into groups 
by race/ethnicity or sex? Because statistical discrimination is really a reflection 
of underlying group average human-capital differences, there are really two

possible explanations for groups to have average incomes that differ substan-
tially: taste-based discrimination or human-capital differences.16 Which of our 
two prime candidates provides the best explanation? Recall first the argument 
that taste-based discrimination is always vulnerable to elimination by competi-
tion, and then the counter-argument that vulnerability to elimination is not the 
same thing as actual elimination. Note also that Asians earn approximately the 
same as NHWs, so either any taste-based discrimination somehow exempts 
them, or Asians have far more human capital than NHWs but taste-based 
discrimination nonetheless brings their earnings down to approximately the 
level of that of NHWs.
However, taste-based discrimination becomes harder to accept once we see 
that there are vast differences in compensation among different kinds of Asians.

Some of these Asian subgroups earn more than the median U.S. worker,  
and some earn less. The fact that median compensation varies so widely 
among different types of Asians is hard to square with a theory of pure 
taste-based discrimination if that means malicious prejudice against people 
who are racially or ethnically different from you. Why would the amount of 
taste-based discrimination be much greater against Laotians and Hmong than 
against Indians and Japanese? Such taste-based discrimination exists, in the 
contemporary U.S. as in every other society in history, but as noted earlier, 
competition is a potential remedy—those who discriminate in employment 
lose high-quality workers to those who don’t.
Does human capital then explain earnings differences? Groups certainly do 
differ in the average amount of various human-capital components. Table 6-2 
uses data from the federal National Center on Education Statistics to break 
down college graduating classes for different years in the U.S. from the 1970s 
to the 2000s by sex and race/ethnicity. In each case, a comparison is made 
between the percentage consisting of each group and that group’s overall 
representation in the college-age population. If the figure is in bold, this indi-
cates that that group’s percentage of the college graduate pool in that year is 
meaningfully higher than its percentage of the overall population. If the figure 
is italicized, the group’s percentage of college graduates is significantly less 
than its percentage of the overall population. If the number is neither in bold 
or italics it means that the percentage that group represents in the graduat-
ing class is not significantly different from its share of the population.18 For 
example, in the class of 1977, NWH males were 47.7% of college graduates, 
which was significantly greater than their percentage of the population.

18Here significant refers to statistical significance, at the 10% standard.
In 1977, NHW males were the only group overrepresented among college 
graduates, whereas Asian males, Asian females, and NHW females had roughly 
equivalent shares of both the graduating class and the overall population. Black 
males and females and Hispanic males and females were both underrepresented. 

Chapter 6 | Who Makes How Much, and Why
150
By 2003–4, Asian males and females and NHW females were overrepresented 
in this crude sense, whereas NHW, black and Hispanic males, and Hispanic 
females were underrepresented. As noted earlier, years of formalistic educa-
tion are not the same thing as human-capital acquisition, not by a long shot. 
But it is striking that Asians have a higher propensity to go to college, while 
the wages for both Asian males and females have caught up to those for NHW 
males and females for the data depicted in Figures 6-3 through 6-5. Groups 
also differ significantly in their propensity to have children outside of marriage 
and to go on to graduate degrees. And the average woman works significantly 
fewer hours per week in the market than the average man. So it would not be a 
surprise at all if human capital told most if not all of the story of these group-
based earnings differences, which would mean it is silly to speak of  “overrep-
resentation” or  “underrepresentation,” unless groups are by design deprived 
of the opportunity to invest in human capital.

The Middleman 
and the 
Entrepreneur
The Economy’s Matchmakers  
and Little Revolutionaries
Up until now we have paid attention largely to abstract things—markets, 
information, competition, and so on. This chapter investigates the role of two 
particular actors in the economic drama who play starring roles in it: the 
middleman specifically, and the entrepreneur more generally.
The Middleman
What do Apple’s iTunes, Walmart, and a literary or theatrical agent have in com-
mon? None of them directly produces things that consumers buy. Although 
two of them directly sell to consumers, one doesn’t even do that, but as an 
agent merely negotiates with music or publishing companies that will eventu-
ally sell the work produced by writers or actors to the public.
To think about what these people do, imagine what would have to be done 
if they weren’t there. If Walmart (and, just to make the argument more per-
suasive, all other retail stores) disappeared, consumers would still like to buy 
7

Chapter 7 | The Middleman and the Entrepreneur

microwave ovens, hammers, and patio furniture. There would still be compa-
nies that wanted to stake claims to scarce resources to make these things in 
response to this demand. But now it would be up to the companies and the 
consumers themselves to find each other. A consumer interested in buying 
a microwave would have to seek out manufacturers and then either go to 
one of its retail stores or use its mail-order service to get the microwave he 
wanted. Could such a thing be done? Almost certainly. Could it be done at 
lower cost than the current system centered around Walmart and other retail 
stores? Almost certainly not.
Suppose you are new to Hollywood, and no one has ever heard your name. 
You certainly want studios or theater groups to hear of it. You may not know 
where to audition for the roles you are interested in or who the right people 
to contact are for someone with your specific thespian human capital. At the 
same time, the studios and theater groups simply do not have time to meet 
and audition everyone in Los Angeles who wants to be a star. If studio person-
nel spent all day long meeting and sifting through these people, many more 
people would have to be hired to hire the actors who actually perform in the 
movies. The result? The spontaneous order’s creation of a different kind of 
work for the modern era of mass entertainment: the agent. The agent seeks 
out potential actors, decides to represent them (or not), and brings them to 
the attention of the people who need actors in their productions. The studios 
and directors then find it easier to cast their films, and would-be stars brand 
new to Hollywood find it easier to concentrate on acting rather than learning 
the mechanics of the movie business.
iTunes performs a similar function. Musicians record their own music, and 
iTunes merely sells it. The iTunes search system makes it easy for fans to find 
the music they want and even suggests music they might like based on what 
they have ordered in the past. (Other music-subscription services have similar 
systems, as does Amazon.com for books.) To be sure, unless the musicians 
directly retail their music to iTunes, then in this case there is more than one 
layer of activity between those who make the good (recorded music) and 
those who consume it (listeners/fans). In particular, many record labels (as they 
are still called, in deference to the vinyl records on which music used to be 
released) look for and sign music acts, record their music digitally, and then sell 
those wares to consumers—and also to aggregators such as iTunes, Spotify, or 
Rhapsody. The employees of these record labels—whether their job is going to 
clubs every night looking for the next big thing, deciding which acts to sign, or 
organizing promotional concert tours—do not themselves make music. And 
the musicians who do make it ordinarily do not sell directly to consumers.
Question 7.1
■
 Under what circumstances do you think musicians might choose to sell directly to 
consumers, and how you think they would go about making themselves known to fans?

155
Reasonably Simple Economics
Walmart, iTunes, and agents are all examples of middlemen, which we can 
define as someone who does not himself make the product that consumers 
buy, but buys it from others and sells it to the consumer. Sometimes, as in  
the case of a record company, the middleman adds value to the product,  
by organizing songs on CDs for example. But often, as in the other cases,  
the middleman simply offers the product unchanged to its final buyer.
The middleman has a very specific economic function: namely, to lower the 
costs of manufacturers and sellers finding one another. For buyers to find sell-
ers and buy directly from them, and for sellers to find buyers and sell directly 
to them, is too costly because each side lacks knowledge about the other. 
Absent iTunes and record companies, consumers must find recording artists 
on their own—through word of mouth, going to clubs, or other relatively 
costly methods. Finding good music (in a context-dependent sense, that is, 
good to the particular fan) is not impossible this way, but it is costlier than 
allowing Apple and the labels to organize the available music in a format that 
is easy to access. The literary agent tells book companies which authors have 
which types of books available. (And then the bookstore or Amazon organizes 
the book companies’ products for consumers.) The real estate agent makes it 
easy for house buyers to know what’s for sale and lets sellers know who the 
buyers are and what they’re willing to pay.
Many people react negatively to middlemen (sometimes to extreme degrees, 
as we will see later). They believe their role is unnecessary, that they only 
drive up costs. But middlemen are a huge part of any economy. Poor coun-
tries have traders who specialize in buying products in larger quantities in big 
stores in the countries’ bigger cities and then reselling them in small villages 
or in those same cities from small carts. These people are usually known 
as peddlers. On their carts can be found fruits, sundries, textiles for sewing, 
shoes, and all manner of other goods bought in bigger quantities and resold in 
smaller ones. The retail establishments or wholesale stores where they buy 
their goods to begin with are like retail establishments in developed econo-
mies (whether physical, as in the case of Walmart, or virtual, as in the case 
of Amazon.com), and they are also middlemen. Indeed, as already hinted at, 
it is common for several layers of middlemen to lie between the maker of 
a product and its final purchaser, as in the case of a musician who is paid by 
the record company, which then pays money to iTunes, which then resells the 
digital music to the consumer.
In highly developed societies, there can be many middlemen for any particular 
good. Why do consumers buy this way instead of “cutting out the middleman”?  
Because it is a more effective way of buying, presumably—it lowers cost  
(in money or time), increases buying and selling options, or both. We have 
the seemingly paradoxical result that increasing the number of stages in get-
ting a good from producer to consumer causes the costs of getting it to go 
down. But it is no paradox at all, once we remember that information is costly.  

Chapter 7 | The Middleman and the Entrepreneur
156
If a maker of a product sells directly to consumers, he must spend time seek-
ing out customers, and the opportunity cost of this time is time not spent not 
devoting attention to increasing production and product quality. Customers  
in turn must spend time seeking out manufacturers, leaving them fewer 
resources to actually buy the product. Middlemen specialize in knowledge 
about where buyers and sellers are, and their compensation reflects this. 
(Recall the jam reseller earlier.)
Note

  The middleman exists so that sellers can specialize in production and buyers can save on 
search costs. The middleman, in turn, specializes in learning about buyers and sellers.
An article from 1920 headlined “Farmers to Fight Grain Middlemen: American 
Bureau Federation Discusses Plans for Cooperative Marketing” describes the 
federation’s efforts to increase farmers’ income by eliminating the middleman. 
The group’s official name was actually the American Farm Bureau Federation, 
and in those days it was an organization of farmers that sought to act col-
lectively to increase the price they could get for their produce and provide 
information about farming techniques to its members. (It now also specializes 
in lobbying the government for special privileges in the manner discussed  
in Chapter 5.1) In particular, a leader of the group, J. R. Howard, was quoted 
as saying: “We plan to organize local grain interests in every State, so that the 
producers will have control of the grain until it reaches the manufacturer. This 
is a fight against the broker and the middleman.” (The “brokers” actually were 
middlemen too.) The article goes on to indicate that such middlemen charged 
farmers $50 million a year for their services. As the quote suggests, the Bureau 
also sought to eliminate the speculator, but as we learned in Chapter 4, the 
speculator is only the deliverer of news, not the maker of it.
It is now the second decade of the 21st century, and despite the Farm 
Bureau’s best efforts, grain middlemen are still with us. And this is not surpris-
ing, because they perform all manner of valuable functions that make food 
cheaper. First, many farmers produce in volume. With such wide geographic 
dispersion, going to the farmers to buy would be very costly for sellers of food 
such as bakeries, restaurants, and grocery stores (who manufacture nothing 
except the opportunity to buy conveniently and are thus middlemen them-
selves) to slog through as they searched for the products they wanted either  
to sell directly (groceries) or make into food (bakeries,  restaurants).  So the 
makers of grain store their grain in grain elevators, which keep track of 
every farmer’s deposits of grain during harvest season and upon receiving 
1The web site of the American Farm Bureau now describes it as the “unified national 
voice of agriculture.” Most groups that lobby the government often claim to be the sole 
representative of some large and important group in society.

authorization to sell that farmer’s grain package it with the grain of other 
farmers and sell it in larger quantities. Those who buy the grain may in turn 
sell it to other middlemen who deal in even larger quantities. Eventually it 
ends up in the hands of those with the transportation equipment to ship it in 
very large quantities across the nation or around the world, where it ends up 
on the grocery shelves or in a bakery backroom or restaurant kitchen.2 The 
result? Measured as a percentage of our income, the amount we spend on 
food is less than it has ever been.
And yet at the same time, the percentage of the food dollar that goes to the 
farmer has declined, from $0.41 in 1952 to $0.21 in 2001. Where did the 
rest of it go? Some of it goes to advertising (which serves in part to inform 
consumers of what choices are available) and a very small amount of it goes 
to packaging—but most of it goes to people who stand between the farmer 
and the consumer, from the grain elevator all the way to the grocery store. 
This is not surprising, because in food systems all over the world, middlemen 
are part of the distribution system. In Africa, parts of which are among the 
poorest regions in the world and where farms are often very small, there may 
be three or four middleman between farmer and consumer.3 As mud crabs 
produced in Bangladesh have become more popular in other parts of Asia, the 
fishermen sell (live) crabs to collectors, the collectors sell to fatteners, who 
mass the crabs and fatten them for 10–21 days, and the fatteners sell them to 
agents who gather them in even larger amounts and send them to the capital 
of Bangladesh, Dhaka, in preparation for export, whereupon exporters buy 
them in presumably even larger quantities and send them to retailers over-
seas.4 (These overseas retailers too are middlemen.) Even in a poor country 
like Bangladesh, people are immensely clever in creating new chains of spe-
cialization to get things from where they are originally made to where they 
are wanted. The freeing up of farmers in China in the early 1980s to sell their 
crops privately instead of to the government led almost immediately to the 
spontaneous generation of middleman activity in the production of strawber-
ries, and I would guess in all other crops else as well.5
2The dramatic improvements in the technology of container ships since the end of  World 
War II has allowed farm-production activity to be disbursed across much greater distances. 
For example, it is possible to get summer fruit from New Zealand and Chile in American 
supermarkets in the winter.

Chapter 7 | The Middleman and the Entrepreneur
158
Despite the caution expressed in Chapter 4 on inferring the permanent 
inevitability of something from the fact that it exists right now, the fact that 
middlemen are found in the production of food throughout time and space 
suggests they are doing something valuable for society. The farmers in 1920 
who wanted to avoid them were thus tilting at windmills. Middlemen exist in 
the getting of food from farmers to consumers precisely because it is efficient 
for people who make things to specialize in that and not so much in market-
ing and in searching for final consumers, and for consumers to be able to find 
large amounts of goods in one physical or virtual place. On the highways in 
Kansas, one sees many signs that say “One Kansas farmer feeds several hun-
dred people, including you.” True enough, in the sense that absent farmers, 
the only way people could eat would be to grow their own food. But absent 
everybody else in the food-distribution system who stands between the farmer and 
the people who eat, his food would be much more expensive, consumers would 
thus consume less of it, and farmers would live much worse.
As usual, there is a hidden logic in the spontaneous order. Middlemen are 
people who make money by searching for (actually, by finding) more efficient 
ways to get stuff from those who make it to those who want it. Middlemen 
can discover ways to package foodstuffs in amounts that are cheaper to trans-
port per unit. They specialize in having backup sources of supply (either other 
farmers or other middlemen somewhere in the middle of the distribution 
chain) if there are problems growing in one particular region due to weather, 
war, or some other reason. And they can use the price system to tell them 
where demand is suddenly higher and suddenly lower, enabling the shifting of 
resources from lower- to higher-valued uses. All this happens because they 
make money doing so, and indeed it is the opportunity to make that money 
that causes middlemen to sprout up to begin with.
Note
■
■
  Consider the overlap between what these middlemen do and what speculators do; 
middlemen must frequently speculate about where things are likely to be found and where they are 
likely to be desired. Our intrepid traders who took wheat from X to Y both geographically and across 
time were middlemen too.
Financial Middlemen
One of the most important classes of middlemen in any economy of any level of 
sophistication—be it ancient Rome, medieval Venice, or modern America—is 
that of the middlemen for funds, otherwise known as the finance industry. 
Imagine you are someone with a great idea. To bring your ideas to market will 
take a great deal of cash right now. Research on production technology, on 
consumer preferences, and on locations for production has to be conducted, 
factories have to be built, employees will have to be hired. But as great as 

159
Reasonably Simple Economics
you are convinced your idea is (and as Chapter 4 shows, competition will be 
the judge of that), money is the one thing you lack. That is all right; there are 
plenty of people with lots of money sitting around doing nothing. But where 
are they? You could go out and try to find them, perhaps by knocking on every 
door in the city and asking people if they have any money to spare and if so 
are willing to invest it with you. But it would be much easier to go to a bank, 
or even a venture-capital fund (which pools money the way food distributors 
pool foodstuffs) and ask them instead.
There are two reasons for this. First, it’s easy. Banks, venture-capital firms, and 
other financial middlemen spend money to make themselves known to people 
who have promising ideas. This saves you what we call search costs. Second, 
they know what they are doing compared to some random guy whose door 
you just knocked on. They have specialists who guide them on which ideas are 
better and worse, which would-be recipients have well-thought-out business 
plans, and so forth. There are no sure things of course; venture-capital firms 
make bum investments all the time. (Banks are immunized against this risk to 
some degree by the fact that they insist on collateral, which they can seize if 
the loan payments are not made.)
What we have here is a classic middleman. It is the function of banks,  
venture-capital firms, and every other element of the financial industry to match 
people with ideas and no money to people with money and no ideas.  For each 
side of that transaction, it would be very difficult to find the other. Thanks to  
the existence of financial middlemen, they don’t have to. Even the ordinary 
bank customer who simply wants to borrow money to buy a car or home 
benefits from this institution. By investigating how likely you are to pay the 
money back after looking at your credit report (in other words, by engaging in 
statistical discrimination), the bank will offer an interest rate that reflects the 
expected cost of providing you with funds that otherwise would go to some-
one else. And the standard middleman benefits are still there. The would-be 
homebuyer need not wander around cup in hand, looking for someone who 
happens to have the money he needs. The bank collects funds from many 
depositors, pays them an interest rate to persuade them to forgo the use of 
their money for a period of time, and lends that money at a somewhat higher 
rate to people who want to use it to consume (buy cars or homes) or invest 
(in their own business ideas). Each depositor has no idea what happens to 
the funds he deposited, and each borrower has no idea whom the funds bor-
rowed came from. Indeed, given the electronic nature of modern banking, the 
idea of borrowed money belonging to some particular depositor doesn’t even 
make sense.
The bank collects money from some people and lends it to others and in so 
doing lowers the cost of borrowing, therefore creating opportunities that 
would otherwise not exist. It is a classic middleman, from the giant global 
banking company Citibank on down. Indeed, a revolutionary development of 

Chapter 7 | The Middleman and the Entrepreneur
160
recent years has been the opposite of Citibank: microlending,6 which was 
originally developed by a man named Mohammed Yunus7 to lend money to the 
poor of Bangladesh who did not have access to credit. Most of his borrowers 
were women, and just as he thought they would, many were able to succeed 
without the collateral and connections that traditional borrowers there use 
in dealing with traditional lenders. Similar activities have spread to the U.S., 
with companies like Kiva and Kickstarter providing a way to match people 
looking for funds and people who have them, but on a much smaller scale than 
in the typical bank. This is a powerful response of the spontaneous order to 
the emergence of the Internet, and an indication too of the importance of 
financial middlemen.
This in turn is strongly suggestive of what is given up once such middlemen 
begin to be regulated in the same way many emergent social institutions are. 
Such regulations may or may not achieve their avowed goal, but they will 
surely raise the cost of doing business—of matching up those with dreams 
and those with the resources to make them happen. Note finally that we can 
match up the middleman role of finance with its important role in speculation 
by noting that much investment in embryonic businesses is highly uncertain. 
People who want to perform this financial middlemen function must have an 
incentive to seek out information on which investments are likely to be the 
most profitable, and it follows that they should avoid having artificial incentives 
to make loans that are likely to go bad.

  Financiers—investment banks like Goldman Sachs, commercial banks like Citibank, 
venture-capital firms, hedge funds, and so on—are largely middlemen. They marry people with ideas 
or goals—but not many resources—to people with lots of resources but without many promising 
options for what to do with them.
The Middleman in Society
Given the essential function that middlemen perform, the way they have often 
been seen in the public eye is unfortunate. In fiction by such distinguished 
writers as Shakespeare, Dickens, Balzac, and Dumas, the banker or financier is 
depicted as obsessed with borrowers’ collateral, unimaginative, greedy, unfeel-
ing, and even incompetent in any matters (love in particular) that do not 
involve money.8

Reasonably Simple Economics
A compelling example of the middleman is provided by the experience of  
R. A. Radford, who was a trained economist by the time he joined the mili-
tary during World War II. He was taken prisoner and held in a German POW 
camp. After returning, he wrote a scholarly article about his experience. One 
aspect of life in the camp that caught his attention derived from the fact 
that all prisoners were eligible for weekly packages from home and the Red 
Cross. The Red Cross packages contained uniform amounts of canned milk, 
jam, butter, biscuits, sweets, and cigarettes. Some prisoners also got clothing, 
toiletries, and cigarettes from home. Almost immediately, a trade, particularly 
in cigarettes for food, developed. This is not surprising; demand for any good 
is context dependent, and not everybody smokes or is a fan of canned milk. 
If everyone starts out with the same goods, but doesn’t have the same tastes, 
opportunities arise for people to become better off through trade (a small 
model of the entire economy).
But which people like which goods? That information is costly. Quickly traders 
developed who made it their business to find out the best place to get surplus 
amounts of things from people who didn’t want them so much in exchange for 
things they wanted more, which the traders had acquired from other people. 
Seen from the point of view of the middleman developed in this chapter, these 
people were clearly doing the prisoners a favor. But were they admired for 
their hard work and ingenuity, as a high-tech entrepreneur might be? Hardly. 
In Radford’s account:
Taken as a whole, opinion was hostile to the middleman. His 
function, and his hard work in bringing buyer and seller together, 
were ignored; profits were not regarded as a reward for labor, but 
as the result of sharp [i.e., devious] practices. Despite the fact that 
his very existence was proof to the contrary, the middleman was 
held to be redundant.9
And it is often like this. People with no practical experience in buying and 
selling are convinced that the middleman markup is pure social waste, gouging 
simply because one has the opportunity to. The Soviet Union’s first dictator 
Vladimir Lenin viewed middlemen as parasitical and exploitive, even though 
they reappeared almost immediately when, because of economic collapse 
brought on by his policies, Lenin was forced to loosen control over exchange 
of goods and services among people in 1921. A key belief of the populist 
movement at the tail end of the 19th century in the U.S. was that middlemen 
connived to force farmers to accept lower prices for their output, and that 
farmers could do better by cutting them out. (This belief was very similar to

the hostility noted earlier of the American Farm Bureau to “middlemen” and 
“brokers”. )
In feudalistic Japan, there were four social classes. Samurai warriors were 
at the top, farmers and fishermen second, artisans who made consumption 
goods (clothing, eating utensils, tools, and so on) were in the third tier, and 
mere merchants were at the bottom. There, as in so many times and so many 
places, merchants were thought of as parasites who added nothing and merely 
lived off the work of others. They were not allowed to interact with members 
of the other classes except for clear business reasons, and for many centu-
ries were segregated in their own parts of town. (The great Chinese scholar 
Confucius, from whose work Japan probably got the idea, also relegated mer-
chants to the bottom of four classes.)
Occasionally, this condemnation reaches alarming levels. Violent and nonvio-
lent targeting of stores owned by members of ethnicities vastly overrepre-
sented (in the statistical sense) in merchant activities—a phenomenon that 
economists call the middleman minority—has frequently occurred. The world 
is full of such minorities, who have chosen to specialize in middlemen mer-
chant activity. They don’t produce tangible goods but sell the produce of 
others, the availability of which they have discovered by looking for it. These 
minorities often encounter intense hostility from those who do not under-
stand their indispensability. South Asians in East Africa (expelled previously by 
law in at least two countries in that part of the world), Korean merchants in 
New York City (the victims of boycotts),10 and Chinese in Southeast Asia have 
been among the victims since the end of World War II.11 Jews were relegated 
to finance in medieval Europe by laws that prohibited them from engaging 
in other activities and by contemporaneous Christian theological doctrines 
against charging interest. They often drew resentment because they were 
perceived as charging unjustifiably high interest rates. Especially in such ethnic 
contexts, middleman minorities are often seen as parasites, and indeed that 
word, along with bloodsuckers and other terms suggesting vermin in need of 
elimination, is applied to these groups all too often.
Such ignorance about the function of the middleman is both widespread and 
tragic. Even economists, before the revolutionary development of the theory 
of costly information, were inclined to believe that only actual “productive”

11It is said that the Chinese in Indonesia, who are relatively prosperous and dominate 
merchant activity there despite their small share of the population, always have a packed 
suitcase—in case hostility suddenly breaks out against them and they need to evacuate 
their families in a hurry. Such an event did happen in 1998 after a financial crisis had 
broken out the previous year. Many Chinese-owned businesses were looted or burned, 
Chinese women were raped, and hundreds of people were killed, both Chinese and  
non-Chinese.

activity was valuable. A school of economists in France in the 18th century 
called the physiocrats12 believed that all wealth was based on farming, fishing, 
and hunting, all of which depended on soil, the ultimate resource. Anything 
else—manufacturing or, especially, the mere reselling of goods produced by 
others—therefore did not add value. Even today, some modern economists, 
along with many in the broader public, distinguish between “useful” work such 
as manufacturing and the empty casino gambling that they perceive finance 
to be. But because the middleman’s role is so essential, he always appears 
or reappears despite the risks of public disapproval. (The economist Walter 
Block has argued the one reason prices are higher in poor neighborhoods in 
the U.S. is that middleman merchants, especially those of different ethnicity 
from local residents, must be compensated for enduring local hostility.13)
Whether it is people engaged in microfinance and crowdsourcing (discussed 
earlier), ancient traders from Phoenicia and Middle Age merchants from Italy 
who moved spices, cloths and metals at great risk across vast ocean distances, 
or George Bailey, the banker in the classic film It’s a Wonderful Life, middlemen 
exist precisely because there is a demand for their services. In their absence 
society would be much poorer with regard to the decentralized knowledge 
they were not around to harvest, and therefore much poorer in general.

  Middlemen are often seen as doing nothing more than marking up something produced by 
someone else, who did all the real work. The lack of understanding of their critical role in producing 
information has frequently fed a sometimes-dangerous hostility.
The Entrepreneur More Generally
The middleman is someone who performs the function of getting goods from 
where they are made to where they are used. By the time a middleman reaches 
the stage of Walmart or Bank of America, it may be hard to see where the 
original middleman opportunity was spied and seized. As it happens, the Bank 
of America was founded as the Bank of Italy by an Italian immigrant named 
Amadeo Giannini in San Francisco in 1904. It specialized in serving Italian 
immigrants who were turned down by other banks. (Note the example of 
competition addressing taste-based discrimination.) Giannini took the name 
Bank of America from one of the banks he bought during his rise. Walmart 
was founded by Sam Walton, who had accumulated human capital specific to 
the retail business as a worker at a J.C. Penney store and as a franchisee for 
two other stores. He learned how that business worked, combined it with

his own unique insights about how it could work better, and his innovative 
approach led to a global corporation that saves consumers 25% on their food 
expenses and more on the purchases of some other items. (Note that lower 
prices raise one’s standard of living just as surely as higher income does, a fact 
often forgotten in criticism of Walmart.) As we have seen, the economic term 
best applied to these giant ventures is middlemen. But they are mere examples 
of another broader type of economic actor, which we call the entrepreneur,   
a word that comes to English directly from French. It has the same etymologi-
cal roots as enterprise, which The Oxford English Dictionary indicates combines 
the words for “between” (entre) and “to take” (the French verb for which   
is prendre, with a past participle of pris). So the original meaning of enterprise
is to take something in hand, with the implication of controlling and directing it. 
That, it turns out, is also the economic function of the entrepreneur, whose 
role I now explore.
The Entrepreneur as Residual Claimant
Imagine that someone wants to open a small stationery store, where he will 
sell greeting cards, office supplies, and so on. He does some calculation and 
expects to incur the following expenses:
Workers: 3 @ $20,000/year = $60,000
Annual rent for storefront: $100,000
Annual expenses for merchandise: $50,000
Annual miscellaneous expenses (utilities, office supplies such as paper clips for 
his own use, and so on): $10,000
Total = $220,000
What is his goal? Economists often model business owners as having the goal 
of maximizing profit.14 Profit is defined as revenues minus costs. I have pur-
posely omitted revenues—the money the business brings in—from the figures 
just given for the stationery store. I will instead assume, properly, that when 
this person opens his business, its success is not a sure thing. I model this by 
assuming in particular that he doesn’t know what his revenue will be. We do 
know the sum of his monetary costs: $220,000. How much profit he makes in 
monetary terms depends on what his revenue is. Let us assume that it turns 
out to be $270,000 per year. If we subtract monetary costs from this then he 
seems to be earning a profit of $50,000 ($270,000–$222,000) annually.
14 Many people also reap the satisfaction of being their own boss, although no business 
owner can dictate the prices of the resources he needs, or dictate that consumers buy 
things at the prices he prefers. So in some sense even a business owner answers to 
others.

165
Reasonably Simple Economics
But we are neglecting at least one cost that is very important in terms of  
predicting his decision making but which does not show up in the figures yet: 
the opportunity cost of devoting himself to his new business.  He had some other  
activity, probably a salaried job, that he must sacrifice to become his own boss. 
Let us suppose that he was an engineer, and his annual salary was $100,000. 
When we include this figure (as we should), his $50,000 in seeming profit 
turns into a $50,000 loss (ignoring any intrinsic value he attaches to running 
his own business.) At this point we must distinguish between accounting profits 
and economic profits. Accounting profits are defined as revenues minus explicit 
monetary costs, in other words money in minus money out. But the profits that 
are relevant for decision making, economic profits, are defined as revenues 
minus all costs, including non-explicit, non-monetary costs. In this example, the 
only non-explicit cost is the cost of the work the owner gives up, but it is 
a substantial one, enough to make him change his decision from “continue 
operation of this business” to “shut this business down.”
Note
■
■
  Economic profits drive decision making, and these profits are defined relative to what 
the entrepreneur would earn elsewhere if he did not engage in his venture. But a company (a farm,  
for example) can earn profits in an accounting sense even as farming as a whole may not generate 
any economic profits, and hence not induce other people to enter the farming business.
What level of revenue would be enough to persuade him to continue operating 
the business? Any level that fully covers all costs. If we add the $100,000 opportu-
nity cost of the owner’s engineering work to the explicit monetary costs, we get 
a figure of $320,000 for economic costs. (Economic costs are all costs, explicit 
and non-explicit, that go into the calculation of economic profits.) Revenue of 
$320,000 would leave him indifferent between keeping the store open or not, 
and anything above that would cause him to keep operating the business.
But while revenue is uncertain, it is decisive in determining his compensation. 
If he was wildly pessimistic and actual revenue turns out to be $1,000,000, his 
economic profit equals $1,000,000—$320,000 = $680,000. If it turns out he 
was not wildly but merely mildly pessimistic, and actual revenue is $400,000, 
he earns $400,000–$320,000 = $80,000. And if it turns out that he was actu-
ally optimistic, and revenue is only $200,000, he generates an economic loss of 
$120,000, and the business shuts down (as it does for any amount of revenue 
less than $320,000).15
15Note that because of the way economists define losses, any losses mandate shutdown. 
In practice, the owner may be willing to stick it out, but this willingness is encoded into 
the idea of his opportunity cost of time—economic losses mean that this is not the best 
use of these resources, including his time. Accounting losses can be withstood for a time, 
but not economic ones.

Chapter 7 | The Middleman and the Entrepreneur
166
So, the owner’s compensation varies widely, depending on how the prior 
uncertainty that existed before the establishment of the business plays out. 
This is in stark contrast to his employees. Assuming the business doesn’t 
fail (which of course it might), their compensation is the same rain or shine: 
$20,000 a year.16 If the business does fail, the owner of course loses as well. 
He and his workers will both have to earn their opportunity cost by engaging 
in their next-best labor-market action. If the owner has made long-term com-
mitments to secure the resources he needs to operate his store (in particu-
lar if he signed a long-term lease), he’s still on the hook for these payments 
regardless of whether his business closes.
In general, the owner is facing much more uncertainty and risk than his work-
ers. Indeed, uncertainty is what generates profit opportunities in the first 
place. He thought he saw an opportunity—and grabbed it. But if his seizing of 
this opportunity is easily duplicated by others, such as our jam vendor from 
before, temporary profits are eliminated by the movement of resources from 
where they are earning less to where they are earning more. Nonetheless, 
he saw something others didn’t, and it is only a continual tide of these new 
(uncertain) opportunities that prevents the indifference principle from being 
in operation all the time, everywhere. As discussed in Chapter 4, those who 
possess information about unexploited opportunity that turns out to be cor-
rect make money, and those whose information turns out to be incorrect lose 
money. Our stationery-store owner is the very example of this. He thinks he 
can make money by using resources in a different way from how they were 
used before, but he doesn’t know that he can. And the risks that he is wrong 
are not small. There are lots of claims in cyberspace about the failure rate 
of small businesses, and solid information is hard to find. But one estimate 
based on rigorous research17 suggests that 36% of businesses founded in 1992 
were gone by the end of 1994, and 71% of them were gone by the end of 
2002—within 10 years.
Profit—which comes from the exploitation of opportunity—is often fleet-
ing. The only reason there is any profit at all is because there is a constant 
tide of new ideas and improvements and seizing of these previously unseen 
opportunities. From the point of view of an individual entrepreneur, only a 
continuous flow of innovations insures that he continues to earn money, as 
with a Rockefeller or Jobs. If your innovation is easily duplicated, in contrast, 
profits are competed away.
16Actual compensation can be more complicated than this. Many business owners, to give 
their employees a very direct interest in the success of the business, will adjust their 
compensation according to that success, either through raises in good times or giving 
them a share of profits as part of their pay.

Reasonably Simple Economics
Economists refer to this relatively risky nature of the owner’s compensa-
tion by calling the entrepreneur (the person who takes a perceived opportu-
nity in his hands and acquires command over resources to try to exploit it)  
a residual claimant. Residual just means “what’s left over.” In this case, it means 
what’s left over after all other resource owners have obtained the compen-
sation necessary to persuade them to allow the resources they own—their 
land, time, etc.—to be used for the purpose the entrepreneur wants to use 
them for. $100,000, for example, is what is necessary to persuade the owner 
of the storefront to rent it to the entrepreneur so that it is used for selling 
stationery instead of selling fast food. $20,000 is the amount necessary to 
persuade each worker to participate in the selling of stationery rather than 
doing whatever he would be doing otherwise. So, after the owners of these 
resources have received compensation necessary to secure their cooperation 
in the entrepreneur’s idea, the entrepreneur is only left with the residual—big, 
small, or negative.
Being exposed to this greater uncertainty, it seems reasonable to suppose 
that the owner would insist on some measure of control over how decisions 
regarding the business are made. And indeed he does. It is he who makes 
the rules (but only after knowing that the owners of the other resources he 
needs, especially his employees, will consent) about opening and closing hours. 
It is he who makes the rules (but only after paying a price that the vendors 
from whom he buys his wares are willing to accept) about what merchandise 
will be sold. It is he who makes the decision about the terms under which  
he will or will not offer refunds to customers. And so on. The nature of busi-
ness is that owners are exposed to uncertainty in their compensation in exchange 
for greater control over how the business is operated. This is the essence of the 
bargain in the idea of the entrepreneur as residual claimant.
Our stationery store, in which one owner really does make these decisions 
himself, is an obvious example of this bargain at work. But many companies 
are not small storefronts with single owners. They are large, perhaps multina-
tional corporations that have leaders (known as presidents or chief executive 
officers). Individuals do not own these businesses in the same way that our 
hypothetical stationery-store owner does. Rather, they are owned by many 
stockholders.
Here it is worth briefly discussing what exactly stock is. One can think of it as a 
piece of paper (although most stock now merely exists as ones and zeros in a 
computer) that is issued by a company and bought by individuals who think it 
is worth buying. Traditionally, this piece of paper entitles them to a share of the 
company’s profits, paid four times a year as a dividend. In exchange, they liter-
ally own a portion of the firm and can contribute to decisions on every detail 
about how it is run. To be sure, for many large companies there are millions 
of shares of stock outstanding, and so most holders of that stock exercise no 
meaningful control over its decision making. Indeed, even large stockholders 

Chapter 7 | The Middleman and the Entrepreneur
168
may have little role to play in day-to-day decision making. Instead, the stock-
holders delegate this decision-making power to the officers of the firm—the 
chief executive officer, chief financial officer, assorted vice presidents, and the 
other elements of the company’s management. But even here the ultimate 
word is that of the stockholders. If the existing management team is seen to 
have run the business in such a way that profits are not as high as they could 
be, stockholders can and frequently do band together—perhaps under the 
leadership of someone with a lot of money who can buy a lot of shares of 
stock in an attempt to make his voice heard—to try to change the way the 
business is run. They may demand ending unprofitable product lines, closing 
surplus factories, acquiring businesses that should be acquired, whatever.
Note
■
■
  Stock shares are shares of ownership in the company that issued the stock. Usually the 
reason for owning stock is hope that its price will increase, which will happen if the company is run 
profitably. Ultimately, through the ability to band together, stockholders can direct these companies, 
although they do not usually exercise day-to-day control.
Although often disparaged as “corporate raiders,” it is the function of such 
large shareholders to put their money behind their belief in the information 
they have harvested that the corporation is underperforming. They thus per-
form a critical function in allowing shareholders to assert meaningful control 
over the company. So, even though there is a degree of separation between 
ownership and decision making in a large corporation that is not there in 
our stationery store, it is still fundamentally true that the owners exercise 
ultimate control.
The Entrepreneur as Social Reorganizer
Let us take a broader, society-wide perspective on what our stationery-store 
owner has done in opening his business. Previously, all the resources he has 
now claimed were being used for some other purpose (perhaps low-value). 
His workers were working elsewhere (or unemployed), the storefront was 
being used for some other business (or was idle), and the office supplies and 
merchandise that would otherwise end up in his store ended up someplace 
else. What this means is that society’s fixed (at any moment in time) stock 
of resources has been moved from some other uses to a new one. Because 
the entrepreneur has presided over this reallocation of resources, we can 
also refer to him as a social reorganizer—somebody who moves resources from 
some uses that he judges to be less valuable to society to uses that he believes to 
be more valuable to society. Society is a little bit different after he opens this 
business than it was before, as indeed it will be again if the business fails, or if 
it expands (perhaps he opens several stores and even eventually develops  

169
Reasonably Simple Economics
a regional, national, or global franchise) and claims even more resources.  In short, 
our stationery-store owner is a mini-revolutionary, and his revolution is car-
ried out without firing a shot, purely through securing voluntary cooperation 
(through perceived potential mutual gain) of other resource owners.
Because of incomplete, costly information, there are always ways to do things 
better than they are being done now. The entrepreneur is the agent of 
attempted change, and if his venture succeeds he leaves society better than he 
found it. This is true whether at the obvious, large-scale level—for example 
Henry Ford revolutionizing freedom of movement by lowering the costs of 
getting from point A to point B with his Model T—or at a more modest level, 
such as our stationery-store owner giving his customers a place to buy his 
wares that is more useful for them than the alternatives they had before. 
Successful entrepreneurship, on a small or large scale, rearranges resources 
and improves society. Once those improvements accumulate, the total amount 
of change can be astonishing, as we will see in Chapter 9.

7.1.	 If it becomes possible for musicians on their own to dis-
cover places where large numbers of people who will buy 
their music are likely to “be,” either physically or virtually, 
they will tend to do their marketing themselves. I have 
attended free concerts where CDs are sold, and music 
can presumably be marketed either by the song or by the 
whole CD in particular places on the Internet. It is easy 
for musicians to announce at their concerts that they can 
be visited on Facebook or Twitter, and their music can 
again be sold there. At least temporarily, the Internet has 
allowed sellers of this particular product to go around 
the traditional middleman, which is something that cuts 
against the general trend over the centuries of more and 
more middleman and specialization.

Some Economics of Now and Later
No matter what it is that people want, it sometimes seems that there is 
inevitably a market for it. Got an old cell phone you want to unload but don’t 
want to haggle? Done.1 Interested in a paternity test but don’t want to go to 
a doctor to get one? Get it from the paternity testing truck.2 Got a rambunc-
tious cat but are too frail or otherwise unwilling to corral it yourself? There 
is someone in New York3 who will, for a fee of course, do it for you. So per-
haps we should not be surprised that there are extensive markets that allow 
people to engage in trade across time. Such markets, which are among the 
oldest in continuous existence, sprout up because people with different goals 
in certain circumstances find it worthwhile to forgo using their resources now 
or to acquire the use of resources now that they don’t currently possess. To 
understand how some of these markets function, this chapter discusses the 
ideas of investment, trading across time, attitudes of individuals toward risk, 
and the markets that these opportunities and attitudes generate.

opportunity now for what one believes to be a better opportunity in the future. This 
simple category of action encompasses a phenomenally large range of things. 
A company that earns revenue now may choose to distribute it to various 
groups of people now. It may choose to pay higher wages to its workers in 
hopes that it can keep them. Or, an individual owner may choose to take it 
as profit, which he may then spend on his own consumption. In the case of a 
publicly owned corporation, the management of the firm may correspondingly 
choose to distribute higher dividends to the firm’s stockholders. But on the 
other hand, the owner or managers of the firm may believe that the better 
action to take is not to use those revenues now in the ways just described, 
but to spend them on increasing the productive capacity of the firm so that it 
will earn even more revenues in the future.
The obtaining of another degree at the margin—high school, bachelor’s, graduate,  
or professional—also involves giving up opportunities now, because that 
degree must be paid for and because to get a college degree, one generally 
chooses for now not to work full-time. This acquisition of human capital 
results (it is hoped) in future income that is sufficiently higher to justify the 
sacrifice made now. Individuals may choose to take some of their pay and use 
it not for consumption now but to buy various financial instruments, such as 
stocks and bonds, or do something more prosaic like putting the money in 
the bank. For some reason, when an individual does the latter we call it saving, 
whereas when he does the former we generally call it investing. But from the 
point of view of the economy as a whole, the actions are really the same: 
resources that could have been spent now on consumption are instead put 
aside so that more consumption is available later. This is the general frame-
work of what investment is.
Note
■
■
  Investment is any sacrifice of opportunities now in the hope of using the resources 
saved to generate more opportunities later. This is true for individuals investing in higher education, 
companies investing in research and development, or governments building infrastructure that will 
last a long time.
Interest Rates
But if one puts part of one’s salary in the bank or in the stock market, as 
already noted an opportunity cost must be paid—the action of using that  
salary to consume now. If a business forgoes the distribution of revenue now, 
the people who would have received that revenue must be willing to accept 
that they will not in fact get it now. So, to persuade people to take these 
actions, there must be found an amount of potential wealth in the future suf-
ficiently large to convince people to forgo the sure opportunity now.

Reasonably Simple Economics
173
How would this work? Think about a simple loan. I lend you $1,000, and you 
pay me back $1,100 a year from now. This loan thus has an annual interest 
rate of 10%. We have also clearly engaged in exchange, just as people do in 
the job market or the market for paper clips. But what have we traded? You 
are getting $1,000 right now, and I am getting $1,100, but not until a year from 
now. In other words, the lender gives up the opportunity to buy $1,000 worth 
of things now in exchange for the opportunity to buy $1,100 worth of things 
in a year. The interest rate we agree on is thus an indicator of a price—in this 
case, the price of wealth right now in terms of wealth in the future. In general, 
if the interest rate is i% (for example, 10%), this means that to get $1 today 
requires giving up $(1 + i) a year from now (that is, $1.10). If the rate is 20% 
instead of 10%, getting your hands on $1 today requires you give up $1.20 
a year from now. Present wealth, in other words, is now more expensive in 
terms of future wealth. The economics jargon of what an interest rate reflects 
is that it is an intertemporal price—the price at which wealth across different 
periods of time trades. (Intertemporal just means “across time.”) Note that this 
means that a phrase one sometimes hears—that the interest rate is the price 
of “money”—is simply wrong. The price of a dollar is just a dollar; why would  
anyone give up dollar and get back less than that? Rather, in a sense, the interest  
rate is the price of money (or of any form of wealth, technically—many ancient 
societies defined interest rates in terms of grain) now.
There is a market for loans, and this market functions like any other. As the 
price of getting a loan—the interest rate—goes up, the amount that potential 
lenders are willing to supply goes up. (The supply curve for loans, in other 
words, is positively sloped.) The law of demand is also in effect in the market 
for loans, so that the higher the interest rate, the less potential borrowers 
are willing to borrow. The interest rate is just another equilibrium price—in 
this case, the price that coordinates the willingness of borrowers to borrow 
and the willingness of lenders to lend. The market must—and will—find a 
rate that is sufficient to persuade people with wealth now, but no perceived 
high-value uses for it currently, to offer it, and to persuade people with poten-
tially high-value uses for it, but no wealth now, to offer wealth later (principle 
plus interest) that they expect to earn from that wealth they borrow now. 
Interest, in other words, is the price that allows people with resources but 
no ideas for future productivity (lenders) and people with wonderful ideas 
but no resources (borrowers) to engage in what they expect to be mutually 
beneficial exchange. (Recall that this phrasing was also used in the description 
of the finance industry.)

  An interest rate is the price, in terms of wealth to be repaid later, of obtaining wealth now. 
(Or from the lender’s point of view, the price in terms of wealth received later, of giving up control 
over wealth now.)

Chapter 8 | Time and Risk

Like any price, the price at which wealth in different periods of time trades 
differs for a variety of reasons, because of where both the supply curve and 
demand curve are located. Note also that the market for loans is really many 
different markets, depending on the term of the loan. One can borrow over 
a very short term—three months, say—or a very long term—30 years, the 
longest term over which the U.S. government borrows, and also a very 
common term for home loans. (During World War I, the British government 
took out loans to be paid back in 100 years.) In general, if you’re willing to lend 
to someone and give him longer to pay it back, the chances that he will default 
go up. In addition, your money, which has alternative uses, is locked up for a 
longer period of time. As a general rule, therefore, longer-term interest rates 
tend to be higher than shorter-term rates. In addition, poor credit risks have a 
higher probability of default, and the interest they are charged must cover this 
probability. This is true whether they are companies with iffy prospects (who 
must pay high interest rates when they borrow from financial institutions or 
issue bonds) or individuals with bad credit ratings, who end up at payday lenders 
instead of borrowing at lower rates from conventional banks.
People attempting to get their very small company started may be charged 
high rates, for example, if the company is seen as highly speculative, but they 
may be willing to pay those rates if they are convinced of the value of their 
idea. In addition, the more easily risk can be spread around and insured against, 
the more willing people are to supply loans, and the lower interest rates will 
be. People who can put up collateral, or who live in societies with highly 
developed credit markets, get credit supplied more readily, that is, they pay 
lower interest rates. Indeed, much of human progress is partly creditable to 
the creation of social institutions in general, and financial institutions and 
instruments in particular—from metal coins to banking to futures contracts 
to modern “credit default swaps”—that have allowed people to lend with 
more confidence. It is not surprising that interest rates on the highest-quality 
loans were often 33% in antiquity, yet rates on such loans in the most stable 
countries have fallen relentlessly over time, from 10–15% percent in medieval 
times to a good deal less than 5% now. This democratizing of the access to 
credit in turn has increased the number of people who can engage in entre-
preneurial experimentation and therefore has increased the amount of such 
experimentation and social progress. 
It is also worth noting that a lender expects that the interest rate he gets 
on his loan will cover inflation, which is the decrease in buying power of his 
money over the course of the loan. If inflation is 5% a year, and he charges 
4% on a $1,000 loan to be repaid in 1 year, the $1,040 he gets back actually 
buys less than the thousand dollars he lent out. If he expects inflation to be 
5% and he charges 5%, then what he gets back buys exactly the same amount 
of stuff as it did before—stuff that costs $1,000 when he lent out the money 
costs $1050 when he is repaid. But this means that he gets no advantage from 
giving up wealth now in exchange for wealth in the future. What we say in 

Reasonably Simple Economics
175
this case is that the real interest rate—the rate he gets over and above the rate 
of inflation expected to occur over the course of the loan—is zero percent. 
Because having wealth to lend right now is valuable, we would expect him to 
get more than just an inflation adjustment for giving up that wealth now. And 
so the actual interest rate that one pays is really implicitly divided into two 
parts. One part is this real rate, which is compensation for advancing wealth 
to somebody else right now. Like provision of anything valuable, provision 
of wealth now has value that ought to be compensated—in this case, by the 
provision of more wealth later. The proportion of the interest rate that com-
pensates the lender for the depreciation in the value of his money over the 
course of the loan is the expected inflation component. The formula for the 
interest rate actually paid (called the nominal interest rate) is thus:
Nominal interest rate = Real interest rate + expected inflation rate
Thus, in high-inflation societies, interest rates tend to be very high, just to 
cover the fact that money is losing value very rapidly. These high interest rates 
are part of the reason high inflation destroys lending markets, which I discuss 
in more detail in Chapter 11.
Note
■
■
  The actual interest rate paid on a loan will be higher than what the lender expects the 
inflation rate to be over the course of the loan. Only after the lender is compensated for this expected 
depreciation in the buying power of money can he earn a real interest rate, which, possessing wealth 
now desired by the borrower, he will. (How high the real interest rate is is a function of the supply of 
and demand for loans.)
Risk and Risk Trading
As has been emphasized repeatedly, one of the most important, if not the 
most important, economic phenomena is that of costly, dispersed information. 
Looked at another way, this simply means that the future is difficult to predict. 
Just as people have different attitudes toward certain kinds of food or toward 
what (if anything) they want to watch on television, they have different atti-
tudes toward risk. Risk means exposure to multiple possible outcomes, some 
better and some worse. Some people are willing to pay a lot to avoid it, some 
are not much bothered by it, and a few even go out of their way to seek it. 
This difference in attitude is known as risk preference.
To think about different attitudes toward risk, including your own, conduct 
the following thought experiment. Suppose I offer you the following bet: flip a 
coin, and if it comes up heads, I pay you $100. If it comes up tails, you pay me 
$100. If you are not willing to take that bet, you have some degree of what 
is known as risk aversion, which means that you are unwilling to take a “fair 
bet.” What is a fair bet? It is one for which the expected value is zero. In this 

Chapter 8 | Time and Risk
176
case, you have a 50/50 chance of winning $100 and a 50/50 chance of losing 
$100. In the language of probability, the expected value of this bet is zero.4 
Some people will take a bet in which losing requires that they pay $100 to the 
professor while winning means the professor pays them $120. Others will not 
even take that bet, but will take one in which winning means receiving $200, 
and losing still means only paying $100. The more you have to receive in the 
event of winning to be willing to tolerate the chances of losing $100, the more 
risk-averse you are. If you are willing to take a bet in which losing means you 
pay the professor $100 and winning means you will get $99 (or less), you are 
said to be risk-loving or risk-preferring. In the case that you are willing to take 
a fair bet but are not risk-loving, in other words you will not take a bet with 
negative expected value, you are said to be risk-neutral.
People have all sorts of different attitudes toward risk, and these differences 
(as with all differences among humans) generate opportunities for mutually 
beneficial trade. In this case, the phenomenon we are talking about is called 
risk-trading. Risk-trading happens when a person who is less willing to be 
exposed to risk pays someone who is more willing to be exposed to it to 
bear the risk for him. This is an extremely common phenomenon. There are 
two factors that make it possible. The first is that people have different risk 
preferences. If one person is very risk-averse, and another is less risk-averse 
or even risk-loving, the second person may be willing to bear the risk of some 
event in exchange for payment. (Often, as we will see, this payment only hap-
pens if the event generating the risk turns out well.)
The second way risk-trading can be enabled is if the party that chooses to 
bear the risk is able to capitalize on something called the law of large numbers. 
The law of large numbers basically means that the more events with the same 
risk an individual is exposed to, the more reliably he can predict his eventual 
gains or losses. If one flips a coin one time, there is a 50/50 chance one will 
get no heads at all. If one flips it twice, there is still a one in four chance of no 
heads, and one in eight if it’s flipped three times. But if one flips it 1,000 times, 
the chances of having no heads are essentially zero, as are the chances of only 
getting heads 25% or less of the time. In fact, with 1,000 flips, one can be quite 
confident that the percentage of heads will be close to 50%.5
4In general, if an event has two possible outcomes with monetary outcomes A and B, the 
expected value of the event is pAA + pBB. In the example here, A is +100 and B is –100, 
whereas pA = pB = 1/2. A one-third chance of winning $200 and a two-thirds chance of 
losing $100 would also be a fair bet.
5Ironically, as the number of flips goes up the chances of getting exactly 50% heads goes 
down. The chance of getting exactly 50% with only one flip is one in two, whereas the 
chance of getting exactly 500 heads in 1,000 flips is very small. However, the chance of 
getting less than 25% heads or less than 25% tails with 500 flips is also very small, and the 
chances of getting somewhere between 480 and 520 heads is fairly high.

Reasonably Simple Economics

If one or both of these conditions exist, we expect to observe entrepreneurs 
creating ways to trade risk. One of the most obvious examples of how this 
is done is insurance. Assume that all houses are the same—that they are all 
worth $100,000 to the owners and that each house has a 0.1% (1 in 1,000) 
chance of being destroyed in a fire every year. Most people only own one 
house, and if it does burn down it is a catastrophe. If they are risk-averse, they 
are willing to pay more than the expected loss from a fire each year (0.1% × 
$100,000 + 99.9% × 0 = $100) to insure against this potential disaster. The 
more risk-averse they are, the more they are willing to pay in insurance pre-
miums. The insurance company, in contrast, has many customers. In any given 
year, they may have more customers’ homes than expected burned down, 
and in other years, fewer. But the more customers they have, and the longer 
the period of time we are considering, the more predictable their payouts 
become. So, if they charge a premium of $110 or $120, it is almost a license to 
print a small amount of money. The insurance business is simply an exercise 
in risk-trading between risk-averse customers and less risk-averse (because of 
the law of large numbers) businesses.
Question 8.1
■
■
  Under what circumstances could the insurance companies charge $120 
instead of $110?
Another example is the tort lawyer. You may have seen, either on late-night 
television or on the back of the phone book, lawyers who (often very 
aggressively) promise to represent clients in a way such that if the client 
wins nothing, the lawyer gets paid nothing. This system is called a contingency 
fee, and it means that the attorney takes a fixed fraction (often one-third) of 
whatever amount the attorney is able to recover, whether via an out-of-court 
settlement or at trial. If the client receives nothing, since one-third of zero is 
zero, the client pays nothing. The more he does receive, the more in dollar 
terms the attorney’s fee is. 
The client is in a similar position to the homeowner in the last example. He 
has only one case, and is thus exposed to a relatively large amount of risk. The 
attorney, in contrast, has many cases, and so his expected income over all of 
them may be relatively easy to predict. If the client paid his attorney by the 
hour, he would be exposed to the possibility that his legal fees would exceed 
the amount recovered, leaving him worse off than when he started. The 
outcome would be the worst if he went all the way to a trial verdict (so that 
the hours billed are likely to be the highest) and then recovered nothing. Such 
share payments in lieu of payment for hours worked are actually quite common. 
It is how real estate and entertainment agents are paid. In many developing 
countries (including Europe and the United States in earlier periods), farmers 
work land as sharecroppers—an arrangement in which the rent they pay is not 
a fixed amount but instead a share of the crops they are able to reap.
r

Chapter 8 | Time and Risk
178
Other examples of risk-trading abound in any market economy. But for pur-
poses of our discussion, the most significant example of risk-trading is the 
organization of the firm itself. Recall from the previous chapter that one of the 
models of the entrepreneur is as residual claimant. His pay depends entirely 
on the performance of the firm overall—a relatively risky scheme of compen-
sation, especially for a new company at its most uncertain stage. The employ-
ees, in contrast, are exposed to risk primarily to the extent that the firm 
may fail. Even then, if they have alternative employment available to them, the 
consequences of being exposed to this risk may be less for them than for the 
owner, who may have a huge fraction of his wealth tied up in the business.6
So, the trade discussed earlier—the owner taking on more risk in exchange 
for control and for the potential to earn very high rewards—is also a form 
of risk-trading. This suggests that people who start and run businesses tend 
to have more tolerance for risk than people who work for salaries. Because 
the number of such people in any society may be a rather small percentage of 
the entire population, it may be rather important (via allowing those entre-
preneurs who successfully discover and take advantage of valuable opportu-
nities) to give that small slice of the population a reason to take those risks. 
If not, as we are about to see in Chapter 9, the future may not be what it 
could be.

  Risk-trading is a key part of any economy. It is also the cornerstone of business creation, 
with the entrepreneur as residual claimant staking claim to the residual in compensation for bearing 
much of the risk of business failure.
Answers to In-Text Questions
8.1.	 The most obvious answer is that people who are willing 
to pay $120 to avoid an expected loss of $100 are more 
risk-averse than those who are only willing to pay $110 
to avoid the same expected loss.
6Not always of course; many entrepreneurs already possess wealth from prior business ventures, 
and many employees, for reasons of highly specific human capital or generally depressed 
economic conditions, may actually have very poor alternatives to their current job.

Economics Out There
8.1.	 Sometimes the real boundaries between economic cat-
egories are fuzzier than depicted in the textbooks.  
A 1997 issue of Businessweek tells the story of a person in 
Silicon Valley who quit her job and took one as a recep-
tionist with many responsibilities at a small technology 
company. She got a salary much smaller than in her previ-
ous job, but also a lot of company stock and options to 
buy more later at a guaranteed price. What kind of atti-
tude toward risk do you think she had relative to some-
one who insists on being paid only in salary? Was she a 
residual claimant?
8.2.	 In his essay “On Usury,” the writer Hilaire Belloc argued 
that we should distinguish between productive and 
unproductive loans, with only the former being a justified 
reason to charge interest. He provided an example of 
each type:
Supposing a man comes to you and says: “There is a 
field next to mine which is a very good building site; if 
I put up a good little house on it I shall be able to let 
that house at a net profit—all rates, taxes and repairs 
paid—of £100 a year. But I have no capital with which 
to build this house. The field will cost £50 and the 
house £950. Will you lend me £1,000, so that I can buy 
the field, put up the house, and enjoy this nice little 
income?” You would presumably answer, “Where do 
I come in? You get your £100 a year all right; but you 
only get it by my aid, and therefore I ought to share in 
the profits. Let us go fifty-fifty. You take £50 every year 
as your share for your knowledge of the opportunity 
and for your trouble, and hand me over the other £50. 
That will be five percent on my money, and I shall be 
content.”
This answer, granted that property is a moral right, is a 
perfectly moral proposition. The borrower accepting 
that proposition certainly has no grievance. For a long 
time [theoretically, forever] you could go on drawing 
five percent on the money you lent, with a conscience 
at ease.

Chapter 8 | Time and Risk
180
Now let us suppose that man comes to you and says: 
“I know the case of a man in middle age who has been 
suddenly stricken with a terrible ailment. Medical aid 
costing £1,000 will save his life, but he will never be able 
to do any more work. He has an annuity of £100 a year 
to keep him alive after the operation and subsequent 
treatment. Will you lend the £I,000? It will be paid 
back to you on his death, for his life has been insured in 
a lump payment for the amount of £I,000.” You answer: 
“I will lend £1,000 to save his life, but I shall require of 
him half his annuity, that is £50 a year, for every year 
he may live henceforward; and he must scrape along 
as best he can on the remaining £50 of his annuity.” 
That answer would make you feel a cad if you have any 
susceptibilities left, and if you have not—having already 
become a cad through the action of what the poet has 
called “the soul’s long dues of hardening and decay”—
it would be a caddish action all the same, though you 
might not be disturbed by it.
It seems therefore that there are conditions under 
which you may legitimately and morally lend £1,000 
at five percent in perfect security of conscience, and 
others in which you cannot.
Is the latter loan merely an exchange of something 
valuable for something else also valuable, or is there 
more to it than that?
8.3.	 On his blog7 at The New York Times web site, the econo-
mist Paul Krugman displays a chart showing the long-term 
trend in U.S. tariffs—they go up and down over time, but 
the general trend has been down. What does freer inter-
national trade do in terms of the reliability of supply of 
various resources? What does it do to the competitive 
risk faced by any individual businesses that compete with 
foreign firms and that get resources from them? Do you 
think freer trade over the centuries is one of those inno-
vations alluded to in this chapter that has served to lower 
interest rates over the long term?

Q: Is the future going to be better than the past?
A: It always has been.
It has probably never occurred to you to think about it, but the man who 
invented the snowblower is responsible for saving at least hundreds of lives. 
Shoveling snow is vigorous exercise, especially when done under the burden 
of several layers of winter clothing. It is quite an exertion for someone who is 
middle-aged or older and thus prone to heart disease. It used to be common 
in winter to read about people who suffered heart attacks while shoveling 
snow and died shortly thereafter if not immediately. But the invention of the 
snowblower changed all that. It allows people to do a necessary but histori-
cally unpleasant chore with much less work. It is almost certainly true that

the inventor of the snowblower, whom Wikipedia credits1 as being Arthur 
Sicard of Quebec, did not create it or the successful company to market it 
with the goal of saving lives. Rather, he thought it would sell because people 
were looking for a tool to save them time and discomfort. So, in a sense the 
lives saved are a free benefit of his entrepreneurial experiment. It turns out 
more generally that entrepreneurs like Mr. Sicard are a prime if not the prime 
mover of human achievement and progress, and so it is worth considering the 
magnitude of what they have done.
Pessimism Amidst Miracles
In the course of my work I meet professors from many disciplines, and I try to 
read ideas from people with a wide variety of points of view. A sentiment that 
I sometimes run into that always disappoints me is the reluctance of people 
to have children. It must be admitted that there are good reasons for deciding 
not to have children, in particular if one is confident that one will make a ter-
rible parent, or if one has life plans that do not leave room for them. But the 
belief I want to investigate here is that it is a bad idea to have children because 
the world into which one would bring them is terrible and getting worse.  
I often run into this sentiment, particularly from people who have strong 
beliefs with regard to the environment. Strongly religious people also often 
worry about the collapsing state of morals, but these religious people often 
also believe that they are religiously obligated to have many children, so this 
type of pessimism does not so much affect their decision to bring children 
into the world or not.
Throughout the world, especially but not exclusively in wealthy countries, 
birth rates have fallen spectacularly in the last several decades. Some of this 
is easy to understand economically. Wealthy societies mean that people can 
easily earn enough during their working years not just to fund their own 
retirement, but actually to leave large amounts of wealth behind for their 
children. They therefore do not have large numbers of children to care for 
them in their old age. And in some ways the opportunity cost of the action of 
raising children is much higher than before, because of the intense time com-
mitment required to do it properly, and in the U.S. in particular, owing to the 
high cost of purchasing their higher education. But many kinds of pessimism 
are completely misplaced.
Such pessimism is easy to understand. Popular entertainment and news com-
panies often emphasize it. But this is because broadcasters know that if you 
want people to watch, emphasize stories involving violence, the more hideous 
the better. And so local news follows the “if it bleeds, it leads” principle; it is 
1http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snow_blower

183
Reasonably Simple Economics
replete with video of robberies, the aftermaths of shootings, spectacular car 
accidents, and so on. At the level of national and international news, we hear 
of wars, famines, and environmental devastation. Both people of the political 
left and right have their own favorite catastrophes. People of the left worry 
about environmental calamities, worsening standards of living, and “income 
inequality,” while those on the right worry about the breakdown of long-
standing moral codes, the spread of ignorance about the glorious past of their 
society, and also about falling standards of living.
If you want more evidence of the omnipresence of pessimism, consider pop 
culture. Most readers are familiar with the term utopia, which is taken from a 
1516 novel by Thomas More describing a perfect society of the future. There 
is a corresponding antonym, called dystopia, and there are plenty of books 
and movies representing the idea that things are getting relentlessly worse, or 
indeed that they have already collapsed. In the 1993 movie Falling Down, the 
main character played by Michael Douglas is caught one day in a traffic jam 
on his way to work when he decides to just get out, abandon his vehicle, and 
start walking. His day winds up with him killing himself on Venice Beach, but not 
before strolling through a Los Angeles beset with white supremacists, selfish-
ness, and greed, vast income inequality, and senseless street crime and outbursts 
of violence. The Terminator movies depict a world in which the few remaining 
humans fight the killing machines that they themselves inadvertently created.
And these examples barely scratch the surface. What is striking about dysto-
pian fiction, besides its frequency, is the nature of the things imagined to do 
humanity in. Frequently, mysterious, powerful corporations have either engi-
neered human disaster or are actually using it to their benefit. In the 1975 
movie Rollerball, corporations actually run the world, and one part of the cor-
porate ruling class, called the Energy Corporation, runs a sport characterized 
by extreme violence whose goal is to make sure no player can succeed for 
too long (to make people unwilling to believe in the power of the individual 
to succeed). In Blade Runner (1982), the Tyrell Corporation plays a large role 
in operating the world—and a lovely world it is, characterized by pollution so 
severe that the sun is almost never seen and most natural life has been wiped 
out and by seemingly inescapable police surveillance. In the Terminator series, it 
is the Cyberdyne Corporation that (unwittingly) sets down the path that leads 
to humanity’s near-destruction. Skepticism of business and its role in society, 
without all of the dystopian overtones, is also far from rare. The movie Alien 
has a sinister “company,” never explicitly identified but which might (based on 
letters on various items in the film) be the Weyland-Yutani Corporation. In the 
immensely popular movie Avatar, a private corporation seeks to seize control 
of a faraway planet’s resources even if it means destroying the society of the 
planet and enslaving everyone on it if necessary. At the level of the individual’s 
relation to business, such movies as Wall Street (both the 1987 original and 
2010 sequel) depict financiers not as middlemen linking ideas and money but 

Chapter 9 | The Entrepreneur and Some Economics of the Future
184
as greedy destroyers of all that is decent and noble. In Arthur Miller’s Death 
of a Salesman, considered among the greatest of all American plays, the title 
character is a seemingly helpless near-slave of his ruthless corporate employer, 
which resolutely refuses to ease his emotional burdens by letting him work 
closer to home and fires him when he reacts angrily to its refusal to do so.
Seen from the opposite point of view, utopian visions often rest on the aboli-
tion of commerce. Plato’s Republic, the ancient Greek philosopher’s guide to 
the ideal society, abolishes private property. In the Star Trek television series 
and films, the various intelligent beings who inhabit the galaxy produce amaz-
ing technological and material advances, but have no desire for material things 
and generally use no money, human nature apparently having been adjusted 
somehow to move beyond self-interest. How people were motivated to cre-
ate all the marvelous technology is not specified.
Another common theme of dystopian art is environmental catastrophe. Films 
like Silent Running (1972) and Blade Runner depict human-caused mass species 
extinction. Logan’s Run (a 1967 novel made into a movie in 1972) and Soylent 
Green (1973) both hinge on overpopulation. Logan’s Run depicts a future U.S. 
in which everyone is executed at 30 to avoid overcrowding. Soylent Green is 
set in a world in the later stages of being destroyed simultaneously by over-
population, global warming, and mass extinction, depicting a society in which 
people passively and unknowingly consume a product made from the flesh of 
the dead in order to stay alive. Waterworld (1995) is about a lawless world 
after the polar ice caps have melted, the Mad Max series of movies is about 
the collapse of civilization after the near-exhaustion of the world’s oil, and The 
Day after Tomorrow (2004) depicts the catastrophic effects of humans dumping 
greenhouse gases into the atmosphere. Even children are not protected from 
the genre; the generally very charming movie Wall-E (2008) is about humans 
living a life of utter but empty leisure in space because their ancestors made 
the earth uninhabitable by treating it as a mere bottomless trashcan.
It is striking how far these works of art part from what actually happened in 
the depicted year that in reality has now already passed or is about to. Blade 
Runner takes place in 2019, and the decision to prevent anyone from reaching 
old age that is the basis for Logan’s Run takes place in 2000—because of rapid 
growth in the numbers of young people. As it turned out, as noted above, eco-
nomic growth has caused population growth rates to plummet, and predic-
tions made several decades ago about the number of people and what they’re 
going to do to the planet now look wildly pessimistic if not paranoid.2
2 George Orwell’s 1984 is another example of disproven dystopia. Although there the 
nightmare there is political, the predictions were in most respects equally misplaced.

185
Reasonably Simple Economics
In contrast, there are very few movies made about a future that is brighter in 
every respect than the present, where people get along more or less (amaz-
ingly well by historical standards, in fact), where racial conflict and war are 
much less severe than they once were, where many health problems that used 
to be scourges are now largely solved.3 And yet that is pretty much how the 
future always turns out to be.
The Way Things Used to Be
One of the unfortunate negative effects of modern technology is that people 
tend to think more in terms of the here and now, because they don’t depend 
on the recounting of ancient myths and struggles for knowledge or entertain-
ment. One reason Homer’s Iliad and Odyssey became classics is that they were 
orally recounted by traveling professionals before eager crowds for centuries 
before they were finally committed to paper. But in our age of instant infor-
mation, that is a poor way to spend an evening, and in general our electronic 
age has probably made what’s happening now seem very important, and what 
happened before, so to speak, yesterday’s news. People have always had a 
natural tendency to suppose that everything that matters in human affairs 
started within the span of their own lives, despite the thousands of years of 
human civilization that preceded them. (When I ask students to identify the 
most important innovations in history, invariably many offer up the computer 
or the Internet. Important as these seem to be—admittedly at a time when 
they are still in their infancy—they do not yet compare to the wheel, writing, 
mechanical power, or even eyeglasses or the mechanical screw.)
In fact, most of human history was frankly awful. In 476 A.D., the last Western 
Roman emperor (the 8-year-old boy Romulus Augustulus) was forced by the 
barbarian invaders to leave the throne, and Western civilization entered what 
we call, not without reason, the Dark Ages. During this long span of history, 
not only was life miserable, it was unchangingly so for centuries. Uncountable 
millions of numbers of people were born with no chance to travel more than 
five miles from where they were born. Life expectancy was perhaps 30 years, 
and the rate at which young children died was staggering. Many people didn’t 
make it to adulthood, and those who did died not from cancer and heart 
disease, diseases of advanced age that are the preoccupations of the modern

world, but in horrible ways: from smallpox, plague, and yellow fever.4 Now all 
of these diseases are preventable by vaccine and other public-health improve-
ments. On and on it went like this, generation after generation. Not only did 
you live the same life your great-great-great great grandparents did, you had 
every reason to expect that your great-great-great-grandchildren would live 
that life too.
But from about 1780 on, everything changed. Consider Figure 9-1.

whose lethal effect lies partly in its victims bleeding profusely from every orifice until they

an infected blister after playing tennis at the White House.

Reasonably Simple Economics
Figure 9-1 shows per capita gross domestic (GDP) product over a very long 
period of time. Per capita GDP, the total amount produced in a society divided by  
population, is a good index of material standard of living.  (I discuss GDP in more 
detail in Chapter 11.) Looking at the chart, one sees the pattern is nothing 
much to write home about until 1820.  Indeed, the stagnation of the Dark Ages is 
plainly visible in the figures for Western countries. But sometime before 1820 
(1780 is probably the best guess) something dramatic changed—standards 
of living, especially in Western countries, began to increase substantially and  
without relent. Many people in 1870 had standards of living that were 
unimaginable in 1700, and we live now in ways that were inconceivable to 
even the wealthiest people in 1870. In fact, in the United States, since 1820, 
every generation (if a generation is defined as 30 years) can expect to live 
40–50% better than its parents did. Here are some other things we know 
about life in the United States:
Since 1965, the average American man has 6–9 more lei-
• 
sure hours per week, the average woman 4–8. This is 
equivalent to an extra 5 weeks of vacation. Less-educated 
adults have seen the biggest increase in leisure time.
Since 1900, the average workweek has declined from  
• 
60 hours to 40.
In 1900, almost 75% of males aged 16–19 were in the 
• 
labor force. Now, only about one in four teenagers works, 
and many work as much for spending money as to provide 
their families with essential income.
In 1900, only about 25% of the population could retire at 
• 
65. Now, about 84% do, and most who don’t retire keep 
working because they simply want to.

Chapter 9 | The Entrepreneur and Some Economics of the Future
188
In the 19th century, the average woman spent about  
• 
70 hours a week on household chores. In 2011, men and 
woman combined spent fewer than five. 
Life expectancy since 1900 has gone up from 48 to  
• 
78 years.5
And this hardly begins to state the ways in which life is different. It used to 
be common for Americans to live with their parents until and even after they 
got married. Now for many it is expected that they leave home at a young 
age. (Indeed there is a stigma to being a “boomerang baby” who returns home

my part. We do know that in 1900 the median number of years of school completed 
was fewer than 8 for males of 21 years of age, and high-school graduates made up fewer 
than 25% of that group. From that it can be presumed that most 15-year-old males were 
working. Fifteen-year olds are now strictly limited in the work they may do because of the 
Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938, but even before this time, high-school graduation rates 
began to surge. These data on education are from Claude S. Fischer and Michael Hout,

after graduating from college.6) If one wishes to read more vivid testimony 
about how good we have it, consider the following from the writer Steven 
Pinker on what life was like in Europe in the 17th century:
Our ancestors…were infested with lice and parasites and lived above 
cellars heaped with their own feces. Food was bland, monotonous, and 
intermittent. Health care consisted of the doctor’s saw and the dentist’s 
pliers. Both sexes labored from sunrise to sundown, whereupon they 
were plunged into darkness. Winter meant months of hunger, boredom, 
and gnawing loneliness in snowbound farmhouses.7
Truth be told, this doesn’t sound much different from life in Rome in the 
second century B.C.:
Ordure as well as water flowed through her streets. If the noblest and most 
enduring virtues of the Republic found their expression in the murmuring 
of a public fountain, then its horrors were exemplified by filth. Citizens 
who dropped out of the obstacle race that was every Roman’s life risked 
having shit—literally—dumped on their heads. Plebs sordida, they were 
called—“the great unwashed.” Periodically, waste from the insulae would 
be wheeled out in barrows to fertilize gardens beyond the city walls, but 
there was always too much of it, urine sloshing over the rims of fullers’ 
jars, mounds of excrement submerging the streets. In death, the poor 
themselves would be subsumed into waste. Not for them the dignity of 
a tomb beside the Appian Way. Instead their carcasses would be tossed 
with all the other refuse into giant pits beyond the easternmost city gate, 
the Esquiline. Travelers approaching Rome by this route would see bones 
littering the sides of the road. It was a cursed and dreadful spot, the haunt 
of witches, who were said to strip flesh from the corpses and summon the 
naked specters of the dead from their mass graves.8
In terms of filth on the streets, although not in terms of the disposal of dead 
bodies, such scenes still exist in many cities in many poor countries. But in the 
cities of wealthy countries—a club that has expanded considerably in recent

years by moving beyond Western Europe, the U.S., Canada, Australia, and New 
Zealand to include Japan, Taiwan, South Korea, Singapore, Chile, and several 
other nations—they are inconceivable. Go back less than 20 generations  
(or far fewer than that in the newly wealthy countries), and the ancestors of 
99.9 percent of the people reading this lived on less than a dollar a day, if they 
weren’t outright slaves or serfs.
As with our material standard of living, so too with the tendency of humans 
to do violence to one another. Random, senseless violence is another preoc-
cupation of modern pop culture—think of the appeal of slasher movies, for 
example. In fact, violence both in war and as homicide has declined spectacu-
larly over the centuries in the industrial world. Despite the ghastly death toll 
of the two world wars, both the frequency of and death rate in war declined 
throughout the 20th century. Europe itself is now, along with parts of East 
Asia, the most peaceful region of the world, where people have long lives, and, 
compared to earlier generations, crime is by historical standards a non-factor 
(although fear of crime, driven in part by the media, is not). Homicide rates 
in Europe are less than 10% of what they were in the Middle Ages, when they 
were already considerably lower than what they were, according to many 
estimates, in the pre-agricultural hunter-gatherer societies often wrongly 
romanticized by writers. According to Pinker, whose research provides the 
information used in this paragraph, there are several causes for this decline in 
violence.
But one that is worth our attention is the gradual spread throughout the 
world of the market process—the widening and deepening of ties through the 
market that connect us in ways that give us opportunities for mutually ben-
eficial bargains. Politics, as we have seen, is very often zero-sum (meaning the 
only way one person or group wins is for another to lose), whereas market 
exchange is by definition positive-sum (that is, win-win). I don’t do business 
with you unless I expect to be better off, and the same is true for you. But pol-
itics is all too often about whether the government gives me something and 
you pay for it, or vice versa. The more we rely on markets to decide who gets 
what, the greater the possibilities for us to decide that the way to get what 
we want is to peacefully trade with other people rather than forcibly take 
things from them. The decline in human violence, partly driven by the spread 
of the market as the way of deciding who gets what, has been one of the great 
triumphs of human history, even if it doesn’t make for a good movie.9
9In addition to the spread of market exchange to a greater and greater percentage of the 
population in a larger number of countries, Pinker also credits the spectacular decline in 
violence to the ability of governments to establish enough authority to provide law and 
order, and to the spread of abstract thinking, which allows people to see others as having 
interests and moral rights equal to their own.

Statistics about the bounty of modern life are everywhere; we worry now 
about the homeless in our major cities, but as late as the mid-19th century 
European cities, notably London, had a vast population of “vagrants,” “pau-
pers,” and “street Arabs” (homeless children).10 Between 1990 and 2010, vac-
cines are estimated to have saved 20 million lives. Since 1960, the average 
daily caloric intake in developing countries has risen from 1,900 to 2,700, the 
latter about what a person needs daily to live a physically active lifestyle in 
good health. And we live longer, have more free time, have opportunities to 
travel that would be unimaginable to previous generations, and have exposure 
to more of the world’s diversity than ever before. (Think about how easy it is 
not just to go to China or Brazil but to learn Chinese and Portuguese, thanks 
to the glut of teachers and software, compared to even 50 years ago.) We are 
actually smarter too. A person who scores 100 on an IQ test now, which is by 
design the average score, would have scored 118 as recently as 1950, and 130 
(putting him in the 90th percentile) in 1910.11 Literacy is essentially universal 
in many societies, which is all too easy to take for granted. At the time of the 
French Revolution, literacy in France was probably very far below 50%, but 
illiteracy essentially doesn’t exist there now.
In addition to dystopia, another common theme of culture is nostalgia. In 
America, for example, many television shows and movies have been devoted 
to the golden age of the 1950s and even the 19th century, when people cared 
more about each other, and the complications of modern life—the violence, 
the dehumanizing nature of modern industrial society, the decay of family 
life—didn’t yet exist. But for people who think things used to be better, there 
is good news. It is possible to live a 1950s life, with 1950s choices. Indeed, 
occasionally people conduct such experiments and report the results, not 
all of which are bad. (Two examples, both by women, are here12 and here.13) 
But to live this nostalgic life, not only will you have to give up all communica-
tions technology beyond the rotary phone and over-the-air television chan-
nels. Your house will also be smaller, although it will cost less. Air travel will 
be unaffordable. Many modern medicines that we take for granted will be 
unavailable. If you are disabled, your ability to manage in modern society will 
be profoundly limited, and you will almost certainly not work. So even the 
recent nostalgized past is not necessarily all it is cracked up to be. And the

How Intellectuals and Politicians Have Seen 
the Future in the Past—a Brief History
The discussion so far strongly suggests that the main story of the human con-
dition is now progress—by technological, medical, intellectual, material, or any 
other criteria. And yet the public conversation frequently acts as if this prog-
ress doesn’t exist. And that is substantially because the people who set the 
parameters of this discussion—intellectuals and politicians—either can’t or 
won’t see it. Here we look at the long history of such unjustified pessimism.
Malthusianism
It has been said that there is a difference between knowledge and wisdom. 
Nowhere is this more obvious than in the tendency of highly educated, highly 
credentialed people to think that everything is getting worse. In my research 
on this topic, I have been unable to nail down the first appearance of this 
belief. But a good place to start is probably with the English demographer and 
(unfortunately) economist Thomas Robert Malthus, who had a view of popula-
tion dynamics that still bears the name “Malthusian.” For Malthus, the primary 
good that people cared about was food (not an unreasonable view in the late 
1700s and early 1800s, when he wrote his most famous works), and food was 
produced through two resources: land and people. When times were good, 
people tended to have a lot of children, and given that land was fixed and its 
productivity could not be enhanced, this meant that eventually population 
overtaxed the land’s productive capacity. This led to famine, which killed off 
so many people that the ratio of persons to land fell dramatically, which meant 
that the amount of food per person, and hence general prosperity, could go up 
again. Mankind was forever trapped in this boom-and-bust cycle.
Ironically, even as Malthus was writing, the great long boom that had begun in 
the late 18th century was beginning to make a real difference, but he couldn’t 
see it. Rising productivity was allowing people to grow more food on less land, 
because it turned out that the resources that went to produce food went 
far beyond land and labor and included various productivity enhancements 

193
Reasonably Simple Economics
such as more advanced mechanical tools, ever-cleverer techniques to rotate 
crops and to grow the right crops in the right places, and eventually chemical 
enhancements to productivity such as pesticides and fertilizers.
Luddism
Shortly after Malthusian doomsdayism, the Luddite version emerged. The 
Luddites were supposedly named after Ned Ludd, a weaver from England 
who destroyed knitting machines in a fit of anger whose source history does 
not reliably record. In 1811, upset by automated looms that were replacing 
unskilled textile workers, those workers began adapting Ludd’s tactics to save 
their jobs by destroying machinery and continued to do so (along with threat-
ening factory owners and local officials) until the movement was crushed 
in 1813. Their belief was that if machines destroyed jobs, those whose jobs 
were destroyed would forever be unemployed. Society would be divided into 
a small class of those with work, and a large underclass without. Needless to 
say, this future failed to play out. For the next 200 years, unemployment in 
industrialized countries usually ranged between 3% and 10%. The reason the 
mass-unemployment scenario didn’t occur is that released workers are an idle 
scarce resource, and their underuse (or non-use) provides an opportunity 
for new economic activities to take place—either new enterprises in existing 
activities or the creation of new activities entirely. Out of destruction comes 
renewal, rather than permanent stagnation. Despite this logic, and 200 years 
of mass unemployment in the industrial and post-industrial era consistently 
failing to appear for an extended period, the idea that work permanently dis-
appears, in a way that deprives people of income rather than providing them 
leisure because of machines replacing men, can still be found—by the author 
Jeremy Rifkin14 for example.
Marxism
Despite the fact that most societies once governed by people who called 
themselves Marxist have changed their systems (and two still nominally 
Marxist societies, China and Vietnam, rely more and more on property rights 
and free exchange to decide who gets what, with the beneficial results that 
one would expect), the most famous kind of doomsdayism is probably the 
Marxist variety. Here we must note that in the Marxist vision, doomsday is 
only a way-station on the road to Utopia. What was supposed to happen was 
that the people who owned the factories would constantly have power over 
workers and could keep a “reserve army of the unemployed” to bolster this

leverage. They would pay workers only a subsistence wage, just large enough 
to enable them to buy the food and shelter they needed to be able to keep 
working, but pocket for themselves all the profits thereby generated. If work-
ers tried to improve their lot, they could be cast aside and replaced by the 
unemployed.
In the context of the mid-1800s—with vast movements of labor from coun-
tryside to city, and from Europe to North America, which represented con-
stant rightward shifts in the supply curve for people doing factory work—this 
had a certain surface plausibility. But wages in fact rose throughout this period 
as they did before and after, and the predicted revolution of the working class 
never actually arrived in an industrial country, only in agricultural ones like 
1917 Russia and 1949 China. In the meantime, living standards rose relent-
lessly in the so-called “capitalist” societies, and communism became (in addi-
tion to one of humanity’s great crimes) a dinosaur ideology.
Permanent Economic Stagnation
Sad to say, economists are not invulnerable to the doomsday mentality. A certain 
kind of economist is especially likely to invoke the idea of the “end of progress,” 
or of “permanent stagnation.” To be fair, this way of thinking is not as common 
as it used to be; it was especially popular during the Great Depression, unsur-
prisingly. The writer Deirdre McCloskey summarizes this point of view:
During the 1930s and early 1940s the prospect of diminishing returns 
deeply alarmed economists such as the British economist John Maynard 
Keynes and the American follower of Keynes at Minnesota and Harvard, 
Alvin Hansen. They believed that the technology of electricity and the 
automobile were exhausted, and that sharply diminishing returns to capital 
were at hand, especially in view of declining birthrates. People would save 
more than could be profitably invested, the “stagnationists” believed, and 
the advanced economies would fall into chronic unemployment. In line 
with the usual if doubtful claim that spending on the war had temporarily 
saved the nonbombed part of the world’s economy, they believed that 
1946 would see a renewal of the Great Depression.
But it didn’t. Stagnationism proved false. Instead, world income per head 
grew faster from 1950 to 1974 than any time in history, and the liberal 
[i.e., pro-market] countries boomed. That is, innovation prevented the 
return to capital from declining.15

(Chicago, IL: University of Chicago Press, 2010): 134. In economics writing, liberal generally 
means pro-free market.

195
Reasonably Simple Economics
This idea that we have run out of progress to make is also not new. A Roman 
named Julius Frontinus is said to have said that “[i]nventions reached their limit 
long ago when I see no hope for further development.”16 It is known that the 
Scottish physicist William Thomson, in a letter written to Major B.F.S. Baden 
Powell on December 8, 1896 (just a few years before the flight of the Wright 
Brothers at Kitty Hawk), announced his refusal to join Britain’s Aeronautical 
Society, because “I have not the slightest molecule of faith in aerial navigation 
other than ballooning or of expectation of good results from any of the trials 
we hear of.” So, the belief that we have hit the wall economically and techno-
logically has been around awhile. Make a note of that remark about inventions; 
we will return to it. In the meantime, note that all of these doomsday visions 
have proven spectacularly false.
Overpopulation/Sustainability
And yet doomsdayism is still with us. Its most prominent modern form is 
environmental doomsdayism, which itself takes two forms, both based on 
the idea that there are too many people in the world: sustainability and 
overpopulation.
As near as I can tell, the modern fear of overpopulation dates to work by 
the Stanford biologist Paul Ehrlich in the 1960s.17 In a 1968 book of the same 
name written with his wife Anne Ehrlich, he coined the phrase “the popula-
tion bomb.” A copy of it dutifully sat on my parents’ bookshelf, and it warned 
readers (not, thankfully, including my parents, who never urged their children 
to go out and not give them grandchildren) that there were simply too many 
of us humans. We couldn’t possibly manage to grow enough food to feed 
them all. (Recall how this theme shows up in the 1970s in Soylent Green and 
elsewhere, which reflects the broad cultural influence of Erlich’s work.) Unlike 
a lot of doomsdayists, and to his credit, Professor Ehrlich did actually make 
predictions. Thankfully, they did not come true. He predicted in particular 
16Sometimes rendered as “I also lay aside all ideas of any new works or engines of war, 
the invention of which long ago reached its limits, and in which I see no hope for further 
improvement.”
17The broader eugenics movement, which sought to improve the quality of the human race 
by making sure the “good” types of people reproduced and the “bad” types—the poor 
and the dark-skinned—did not, was also worried about overpopulation, especially of 
darker people, as documented extensively in Robert Zubrin, Merchants of Despair: Radical 
Environmentalists, Criminal Pseudo-Scientists, and the Fatal Cult of Antihumanism (New York: 
Encounter Books, 2012). The Erlichs describe being appalled by the tide of desperate 
people they saw on a visit to India. Since they appear to be concerned more with the 
problem of too many people generally rather than too many of the “wrong” type of 
people, it is not fair to call them eugenicists. But historically many others who advocated 
population control have clearly been in this camp.

that hundreds of millions of people would die in famines in the 1970s. The 
annual global death rate would “substantial[ly] increase.” But malnutrition as a 
percentage of the population has in fact declined by about half since the book 
was published, and calories consumed by the average person worldwide have 
increased substantially.
In a speech on the original Earth Day in 1970, Ehrlich pronounced that “In ten 
years all important animal life in the sea will be extinct. Large areas of coast-
line will have to be evacuated because of the stench of dead fish.” And Great 
Britain? Not so great anymore. “By the year 2000 the United Kingdom will 
be simply a small group of impoverished islands, inhabited by some 70 million 
hungry people… If I were a gambler, I would take even money that England 
will not exist in the year 2000.”
And here is another prediction, from Sandra Postel of the Worldwatch 
Institute, an organization that has long been concerned about “sustainability”:
As a result of our population size, consumption patterns, and technology 
choices, we have surpassed the planet’s carrying capacity. This is plainly 
evident by the extent to which we are depleting natural capital. The earth’s 
environmental assets are now insufficient to sustain both our present 
patterns of economic activity and the life-support systems we depend 
on. If current trends in resource use continue and if world population 
grows as projected, by 2010 per capita availability of rangeland will drop 
by 22 percent and the fish catch by ten percent. Together, these provide 
much of the world’s animal protein. The per capita area of irrigated land, 
which now yields about a third of the global food harvest, will drop by  
12 percent. And cropland area and forestland per person will shrink 
by 21 percent and 30 percent, respectively.18
This prediction was made in 1994, and the doom prophesied in it was sup-
posed to have happened by now. And yet much of 1994–2010 was a global 
boom, when people became better nourished and more prosperous, 
untroubled by such things as “per capita availability of rangeland” and “the 
fish catch.” (I investigate overfishing and why it happens in Chapter 10.) 
But having certain amounts of these things are not goals per se, because 
they are resources—means to an end, not the end itself. The end is, and 
always should be, human welfare. If people are eating better (and they are), it 
is generally because we can get more food with fewer resources than before, 
as has happened around the world for decades. The planet per se has no 
“carrying capacity”; this can only be defined relative to our ability to convert

its resources into human purposes, something that constantly improves over 
time because supply curves shift right thanks to technological improvement. 
Pay attention to outputs—human welfare, manifested as nutrition and health, 
opportunity, peaceful coexistence, and so on—and not to inputs.

  Pay attention to outputs like improved health and economic opportunity throughout the world 
and not to inputs like carbon-based fuels, cropland available, and so forth. You’ll put your mind at ease.
The older sustainability concerns, in which humanity outruns the means to 
feed itself, date back to Malthus and have been given a gloss for our media age 
by people like the Ehrlichs. But now, after several decades in which the things 
that population doomsdayists were most concerned about failed to happen, 
a new set of concerns about sustainability has been expressed. Some of these 
involve human pollution of the environment, especially carbon dioxide, which 
influences climate. In earlier decades, most concern about pollution involved 
substances that are directly toxic to human health—poisons in the air and 
water. But a huge body of research shows that as countries industrialize, while 
their pollution may initially increase, it eventually declines sharply as its peo-
ple become wealthy enough to be in a position to trade off some economic 
growth for cleaner air and water. In every major city in the United States, for 
example, the air is much cleaner now than it was in the early 1970s, when laws 
requiring strenuous efforts to prevent pollution first began to bite.
In addition to other concerns about running out of rain forest and cropland, 
the latter seemingly hard to reconcile with the declining proportion of the 
world’s population that is malnourished, the primary concern of the new sus-
tainability movement is climate. Fairly representative is the following, which is 
from the promotional materials for the 2006 film An Inconvenient Truth:
Humanity is sitting on a time bomb. If the vast majority of the world’s 
scientists are right, we have just ten years to avert a major catastrophe 
that could send our entire planet’s climate system into a tail-spin of 
epic destruction involving extreme weather, floods, droughts, epidemics 
and killer heat waves beyond anything we have ever experienced— 
a catastrophe of our own making.
This prediction, it should be noted, was made in 2006, so as I write this the 
time limit for preventing these catastrophes is already over half over. Whether 
humans influence the climate, and if so by how much, is a question of chemis-
try, and I am not in the least qualified to answer it. If chemists say that human 
emissions of carbon dioxide interact with solar radiation and the surface of 
the earth in ways that should cause atmospheric trapping of heat to increase, 
it is basic chemistry and that is that. Predictions about what will happen to 

Chapter 9 | The Entrepreneur and Some Economics of the Future

the climate in the future are also a scientific matter, although one considerably 
harder to resolve (at least so far) using the scientific method. Climatologists 
typically fit their models to the data they have available from the past. This 
is an acceptable scientific method, and economists use it all the time. But the 
acid test of a climate model, or an economic one, is its ability to predict the 
future. As far as I know, climatologists have not been able to consistently 
accurately predict in several decades of climate modeling what global tem-
perature would do in light of human carbon-dioxide emissions.
Here’s what we do know. Predictions of climate doomsday fit comfortably 
within a long tradition of doomsday philosophizing, none of which has been 
borne out. We also know that it does not follow that just because human 
activity influences the environment—even the climate—a massive, centralized 
government program to limit the human activities that generate these effects 
is called for. Such dramatic intervention in the trading networks people 
have built over time is frequently called for by people most concerned about 
carbon-dioxide emissions, and indeed given the role carbon-based energy plays 
in modern life, intervention from on high could hardly help but be sweeping, 
even compared to prior anti-pollution measures. But carbon dioxide is not 
emitted by people out of malice. Emissions are instead a byproduct of useful 
human activity—ambulances taking people to the hospital to save their lives, 
young people getting on airplanes exploring the world, people in buildings all 
over the world taking night classes in rooms lit by electricity to improve them-
selves, people reading books for pleasure and edification, factories churning 
out medicines and electricity-generating and transportation machines, people 
being liberated by central heating and air conditioning from freezing in the 
winter and suffering heat stroke in the summer, and so on. The benefits of 
those activities must of course be considered in addition to the costs.
Even the benefits of climate change itself must enter our deliberations. It may 
well make many areas of the world more agriculturally productive (although it 
will surely make some areas less productive as well). The problems of govern-
ment limitations on human exchange that were discussed in Chapter 5—the 
problems, in other words, that government regulation creates in limiting the 
ability to use scarce resources to meet human goals—must also enter our cal-
culations. In discussions of environmental problems, people will often raise the 
“precautionary principle,”19 which says that when humans engage in activities 
that might damage the environment, we must err on the side of caution—we 
must allow no action that might cause such damage to occur, even though we 
don’t yet have scientific certainty that it will. But the precautionary principle 
cuts both ways. It is true that allowing the activity to go ahead might lead 
to the environment being changed by human activity in this particular way 
19http://www.sehn.org/ppfaqs.html

199
Reasonably Simple Economics
(although humans have always changed the environment, as do all living things, 
since they first emerged), so that the current state of the environment, itself 
a product of hundreds of millions of years of interaction among living things, 
is something that must be given up to allow humans to take the actions they 
are contemplating.
But if you prohibit people from changing the environment, that also has costs—
businesses don’t get started or expanded, people don’t have access to food 
and medicine at lower cost (a substantial cost in poor countries), dreams don’t 
get pursued (and surely human satisfaction must be taken account of in our 
deliberations about the impact of greenhouse-gas emissions), they don’t get 
to drive a car but instead have to take public transportation, which deprives 
them of a significant amount of mobility. Most substantially, the expansion of 
government control over what we may not do—you may not drive certain 
kinds of cars (or perhaps someday any kind of car), you may only employ 
certain technologies to control the climate in your home (in other words, 
you will have to forgo some amount of climate control), your consumption of 
electricity and all you get out of it will have to fall—also carries costs.
And it also carries risks, because we know from Chapter 5 that governments 
tend to choose relatively poorly because of lack of information, that their 
tools of control tend to be hijacked by special interests, and that they tend to 
use the power that they possess to punish their enemies and suit their own 
interests. Expansion of government control over how people can recombine 
scarce resources, in other words, also ought to be subject to a precautionary 
principle. There is no way to take environmentalists’ precautionary principle 
seriously without accepting uncritically the idea that the social cost of chang-
ing the environment as it currently is exceeds the social cost of preventing any 
environmental change. This is madness.
It is also unwise to view nature as a temple that cannot be profaned, as some-
thing that humans spoil whenever they interact with it in any way. Human 
alteration of the environment is not an act of sacrilege, but something done in 
the pursuit of human happiness and achievement. Sometimes, if the damage to 
other humans, either now or in the future, from human interaction with the 
environment is great enough, then the actions may have to be limited (a topic 
explored in detail in Chapter 10.) But humans, like all species, are constantly 
changing the environment in the course of surviving and advancing, and what 
they do is worthwhile in making other humans better off. The Grand Canyon 
is indeed extremely beautiful, and it would be a tragedy if future generations 
were not allowed to see it in all its beauty because humans had altered it. 
But this kind of beauty is not all there is. Humans create their own kind of 
beauty. The Golden Gate Bridge is beautiful, as is the Sistine Chapel, as is 
the Manhattan skyline, as is a chrome-laden Harley Davidson motorcycle. So 
too is a well-crafted cell-phone interface. Indeed, the network that has been 
built to allow us to link with one another over the Internet and cell-phone 

Chapter 9 | The Entrepreneur and Some Economics of the Future
200
networks is profoundly beautiful in a certain way, as are the commercial net-
works that people build to trade with one another and pursue their goals.20
The risks to human dignity, achievements, and welfare from the expansion of 
the state to keep the climate exactly as it is right now (itself a dubious propo-
sition given the other factors, notably the cycles of the sun, that also affect 
it) may well exceed the costs that result from changes in the climate. This is 
especially true because the spontaneous order reacting locally can deal with 
the latter—if the climate changes, flood-control systems can be built, people 
can move, new technologies can be produced, different crops can be invented 
and then grown in various places. The number of possible human reactions to 
changed circumstances, climate or otherwise, is limitless. For many decades, 
coastal cities in the United States have had to deal with the problem of sub-
sidence, the threatened surrendering of coastal land to the ocean because of 
some combination of rising sea levels and the pumping out of groundwater 
and oil and gas. Local authorities have managed these problems through com-
binations of letting the water reclaim some areas and building various kinds 
of infrastructure to divert the water. The end result is that life, and human 
achievement, go on.
So what do the facts say in terms of threats to humans from climate change? 
In the grand scheme of things, weather-related events are an infinitesimal 
contributor to human mortality. In 2002, 57 million people died worldwide 
from all causes. Accidents killed 5.2 million, including 1.2 million who died in 
auto accidents. War killed 200,000, and other violence 600,000. Deaths from 
“weather-related extreme events,” in contrast, summed to 19,900, and have 
been declining throughout the last 90 years.21 And the vast majority of these 
deaths occur in countries that are very poor—countries, in other words, 
whose economies have not yet grown enough to allow them to buy protection against 
the climate.
What does kill the most people? Disease, both communicable (parasites, 
tuberculosis, AIDS, and malaria, for example) and non-communicable (heart 
disease, cancer). And disease is something that can be controlled with pros-
perity; there is no malaria or yellow fever in New Orleans or Florida anymore, 
although they were once endemic. If control of greenhouse gases were to 
come at the expense of economic growth for the poor, thus, it would do much 
more harm than good. There is a cost of not doing anything about climate

change, but there is also a cost of “doing something” about it, too, a cost that 
can vary with the means we choose to address this problem. The notion 
of opportunity costs of actions taken—for example, electricity that doesn’t 
get generated and pesticides that don’t get applied because of environmental 
desires of people in wealthy countries, where the tradeoffs are different—can 
help us think more comprehensively and sensibly about sustainability.
Note
■
■
  Climate change, and environmental problems generally, are costs resulting from the 
benefits of the valuable use of modern technology. Unavoidably, controlling these costs requires 
giving up some of these benefits, and sometimes the tradeoff will be worth it, sometimes not. The 
costs will often hurt the poor the worst, and will increase as the solutions become more centralized 
and hence inflexible. Excessive government control of the exchange process is also something to 
take “precautions” against.
The final environmental fear is a different kind of “unsustainability”: resource 
exhaustion—the idea that we are running out of oil, coal, aluminum, rare-
earths metals, trees, etc. Usually such thinking operates by making some 
calculation of per-person use of, say, oil, and then predicting population and 
economic growth, estimating the amount of oil in the ground, doing some 
simple arithmetic, and finally pronouncing authoritatively that the oil will all be 
gone in year X. But this way of thinking about resource sustainability ignores 
two related phenomena. The first is the mediating role of prices. Oil is valu-
able because it does useful things for people. If it becomes more costly to 
extract, its price will go up, inducing consumers to use less and entrepreneurs 
to invent new technologies to find more, or to find substitutes they can sell 
profitably. Indeed, as noted earlier, oil itself from the point of view of human 
purposes was once seen merely as a wasteful by-product of salt mining; sperm-
whale oil (and before that, wood) was used to heat buildings. It was only with 
the discovery of new technology allowing oil to do what we take for granted 
now that it became useful, replacing the older sources of heat, concerns over 
whose “exhaustibility” were also expressed once upon a time. (Indeed, John D. 
Rockefeller, by making oil and, indirectly, natural gas a cheap source of heating, 
may have done more to save whales than anyone who has ever lived, although 
he is seldom credited with it.)
As it once was with fears of England running out of wood and the oceans run-
ning out of whale oil, so too it is now with oil. And yet these predictions are 
not new, as the science writer Ronald Bailey notes:
Predictions of imminent catastrophic depletion are almost as old as the 
oil industry. An 1855 advertisement for Kier’s Rock Oil, a patent medicine 
whose key ingredient was petroleum bubbling up from salt wells near 

Chapter 9 | The Entrepreneur and Some Economics of the Future
202
Pittsburgh, urged customers to buy soon before “this wonderful product 
is depleted from Nature’s laboratory.” The ad appeared four years 
before Pennsylvania’s first oil well was drilled. In 1919 David White of 
the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) predicted that world oil production 
would peak in nine years. And in 1943 the Standard Oil geologist 
Wallace Pratt calculated that the world would ultimately produce 600 
billion barrels of oil. (In fact, more than 1 trillion barrels of oil had been 
pumped by 2006.)
During the 1970s, the Club of Rome report The Limits to Growth 
projected that, assuming consumption remained flat, all known oil 
reserves would be entirely consumed in just 31 years. With exponential 
growth in consumption, it added, all the known oil reserves would be 
consumed in 20 years.22
The chief geologist of the state of Pennsylvania, then the most important 
oil-drilling region in the U.S., argued that “[t]he U.S. has enough petroleum 
to keep its kerosene pumps burning for only four years.” He said this, alas, 
in 1874. To restate: what resource doomsdayists always ignore is both the 
ability of prices to let us know about scarcity long before a resource is physi-
cally gone, and the ability of the profit motive to come up with other ways to  
do things.
Modern environmentalism can be dated, perhaps, to the publication of Rachel 
Carson’s book Silent Spring, which warned of pesticide overuse and generated 
a consciousness that led to the first marking of Earth Day in 1970. To the 
extent that it is a movement that makes us more aware of costs of our actions 
that we did not know about, it is a useful idea. To the extent that it views 
all habitats without humans as sacred, and human activity as a poisonously 
disruptive force, it has become a religion, a belief system rather than anything 
anchored in science. Humans impact the world around them, as they, like all 
life forms, always have. There are some aspects of the natural world that we 
ought to preserve for future generations to see because of their inordinate 
beauty—it is easy to justify (on grounds laid out in Chapter 10) creating a 
national-park system, for example. But to suppose that the environment as it 
is today, the set of species found in particular numbers in a particular place,  
is untouchable is to make a completely arbitrary choice, to impose your 
beliefs about how land should be used on other people with different goals 
from you.
Thus it is, for example, that in California a solar-energy project that promises 
to produce electricity with less pollution (greenhouse and otherwise) is now

threatened with fatal legal obstacles because of its effect23 on a proportion 
(not even the entire population) of a species of desert tortoise. This is the 
arbitrary privileging of one interest—the desire of some people that a certain 
number of a certain kind of turtle be found in a certain place—over all other 
conflicting interests. It is the kind of conflict that politics is bound to produce. 
Environmental fetishism fundamentally neglects the limits the restrictions it 
advocates impose on human possibilities and achievement.

Why We Think Things Keep Getting Worse
So, people can and do complain about the results of the market process all the 
time. They lament that there is too much poverty (even though the poor in 
modern societies today have opportunities unimaginable to an 1870s tycoon 
or a 1770s king), the environment is falling apart, etc. But complaining exclu-
sively or excessively about these dissatisfactions suggests a certain ignorance 
about the past. The data demonstrate clearly that across a wide variety of 
dimensions—health, opportunity, exposure to culture, violence—things are 
better, and have been getting better for a long time. Why is the contrary so 
often suggested? To oversimplify a little bit, there are three kinds of people 
who actually have an interest in promoting the view that things are getting 
worse. As noted above, one of them is people in the media and entertainment 
businesses. It is a natural human drive to want to be shocked and alarmed, 
perhaps because our evolutionary drive makes us very sensitive to threats. 
So profit-maximizing media and movie companies, have powerful incentives 
to churn out blood and gore and fear in the news, in movies, in books. And  
this output in turn may reinforce our fear and dystopian inclinations. We are 
hard-wired to be scared, to be alarmed, to perceive risk. So it is unsurpris-
ing that the media and entertainment industries trying to maximize profits 
emphasize danger.
The second sort of person who has both an interest in propagating fear of this 
or that and the platform from which to do so is the intellectual. For purposes 
of this discussion I will define an intellectual as someone who traffics in ideas 
and wants to persuade other people (other intellectuals and the general  
public alike) that his ideas merit our attention. This class includes university  
23http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/unleashed/2010/01/clash-of-
environmental-ideals-in-the-mojave-desert-solarenergy-project-vs-
endangered-desert-tortoise.html

Chapter 9 | The Entrepreneur and Some Economics of the Future
204
professors, authors, journalists, and others. In the postwar world, with the 
spread of higher education and democratic politics, the intellectual has become 
a distinct participant in a vast market, the market for ideas.24 Just as someone 
who makes pens is naturally inclined to think that his company’s pens are the 
best product at the best price, intellectuals tend to believe that the ideas that 
they are selling are not just good but the best ones. But if one sells the idea 
that everything is getting better, the natural response is to do nothing.
On the other hand, if as an intellectual you are selling the idea that there is 
some terrible problem that must be solved, then the natural response is to 
listen to the intellectual for ideas about what to do. Such intellectuals, I think, 
have a natural incentive to see big problems, because they believe their highly 
specific knowledge is the key to solving these problems. They generalize their 
knowledge, and suppose it is all that matters in terms of thinking about human 
problems—to make society better, they often think, you must listen to me.   
(I leave it to the reader to decide whether I am committing the same error in 
this book.) There is not necessarily anything dishonest about this, although the 
unwillingness to look beyond your own tiny sphere of knowledge bespeaks a 
parallel unwillingness to think critically.
To predict the future, it is not enough to know the chemistry of pesticides, 
or of atmospheric carbon dioxide, or of the biology of biodiversity. One must 
also know history, politics, economics. The implication of the tendency of 
many intellectuals to overemphasize the importance of the specific things they 
know is that they naturally tend to paint things in the worst possible light, 
and equally naturally tend to think that they must be relied on for solutions. 
If they are believed, this will provide them with both the satisfaction of public 
approval, material advantages from people buying their books, and even the 
rush of having the political system adopt their views about how to regiment 
society. They are also naïve about government and how it really operates.
Finally, there is the political class. When people see problems, they want to 
be protected. Intellectuals offer this possibility of protection, but not nearly 
as much politicians do. If we become convinced that we are on the edge of 
environmental crisis, a family-structure crisis, a race-relations crisis, or what-
ever crisis will get the job done, naturally we want someone to save us. And 
politicians are all too eager both to persuade us to listen to them describe 
how terrible things are and to run into their embrace to save us from that 
which they have so strenuously warned us about. On this I leave you with 
the words of the noted wisecracking Baltimore writer H.L. Mencken, who 
said on one occasion that “[t]he whole aim of practical politics is to keep the 
populace alarmed (and hence clamorous to be led to safety) by menacing it 
24 This is not to suggest that intellectuals are merely a postwar phenomenon, just that the 
market for ideas has grown dramatically in recent decades.

205
Reasonably Simple Economics
with an endless series of hobgoblins, all of them imaginary,” and then went on 
to add that “[t]he urge to save humanity is almost always only a false-face for 
the urge to rule it.”
How Things Got Better
Why have so many wonderful things happened, and so many horrible things 
failed to happen? As noted earlier, a key part of the story is the creation 
of positive-sum situations. But this only describes the environment, not the 
precise driver of the changes. And I will contend that the person responsible 
for the most human progress—the people who do the heavy lifting that has 
made life so much better over time—is the entrepreneur in his role as social 
reorganizer.
In the American South, one can still occasionally hear people refer to refrig-
erators as iceboxes. The reason for that is that once upon a time, before 
the invention of mechanical refrigeration, food was placed in a box that was 
cooled by ice, and the term stuck around after the technology changed. But 
it has probably never occurred to you to ask how it is that one could ship 
ice to a place like Dallas, Texas, and sell it every day in the summer, given 
that the temperature there could easily be over 100 degrees for days on end. 
In fact, the story of how ice came to be shipped across great distances is an 
amazing story of entrepreneurial triumph. In September 1833, the U.S. ship 
Tuscany arrived in the blisteringly hot city of Calcutta, India with a shipload of 
… ice. How such a thing became possible had to do with a Bostonian named 
Frederic Tudor, who after visiting the Caribbean had decided that there was 
money to be made shipping ice from the U.S. Northeast, where it was all too 
plentiful in the winter, to a place where it was desperately wanted during the 
seemingly endless summer. Because this had never been done before, it was 
up to him figure out how to do it. After trial and error, he finally found infor-
mation that earned reward from the market—in particular, that storing the ice 
in a ventilated chamber with sawdust insulation allowed ice to be profitably 
taken from the Northeast to the Caribbean. While in the Caribbean, he real-
ized he could make more money taking fruit in both directions—apples from 
New England to Cuba, oranges the other way. So ice was harvested in the 
American Northeast and upper Midwest, allowing for the chilling of fruit and 
flowers.25 By 1833, Tudor could use what he was calling his “ice plantations” to 
ship ice to Calcutta, where in September more than 100 out of 150 tons made 
25One of the places Tudor’s workers got their ice was near Walden Pond, which local 
resident Henry David Thoreau in his journal took a dim view of because of the disturbance, 
although he expressed amazement that his “pure” water would end up in India, mixed 
with the “sacred” water of the Ganges.

it from Boston after a four-month journey. Later, other entrepreneurs work-
ing through the spontaneous order began to ship American beef to London, 
where Queen Victoria pronounced her first taste of the U.S. product “very 
good.”26
In the context of the 19th century, this is an amazing achievement. But in fact 
entrepreneurs are constantly doing things that others think are impossible. 
That is what it means to reorganize society—to do something that others 
have, out of ignorance of the idea itself or of knowledge about how to make 
it work, left undone. Although there are of course a number of great indi-
viduals who have done great things through social activism, leading military 
campaigns, or politics, the prime mover of history—of changes in how we 
live—has been the entrepreneur. He has been the lone genius like Thomas 
Edison, who believed that by tinkering in his lab, things thought to be undoable 
actually weren’t. He has been the eccentric dreamer, like the Wright brothers, 
who thought that William Thomson27 and the uncountable thousands who 
thought the way he did were simply wrong, and that it was possible to make 
a heavier-than-air flying machine, which has gone on to provide boundless 
opportunity for people to see new places, to do business with people in far-
away lands, and to generally shrink the world. They have been the graduate 
students at Stanford who had the vision to see28 that there is a better way 
to rank web pages, by how popular they are with everybody else rather than 
by the keywords the web page designers select themselves. They then used 
this insight to create Google, which in addition to organizing the information 
on the Internet much more effectively, has given us new maps, new tools 
for translators, new ways of sharing our lives, and perhaps soon new ways to 
drive cars.29
These are the people who make history. With a small number of excep-
tions—Edison, Ford, the “robber barons”—history books do not concentrate 
on entrepreneurs and the role they have played in reorganizing society for 
the better, and when they mention them, they often emphasize their negative 
aspects. But it is they at least as much and perhaps in some ways more than

with success, was recounted in “The Ice Trade Between America and India,” Mechanics’

presidents, kings, popes, and generals, who have allowed us to escape the life 
“infested with lice and parasites,” and the city with ordure flowing through the 
streets. It is true that many improvements in our lives have been built by sci-
ence and by governments—the discoveries of vaccines, the construction of 
public-health infrastructure, etc. But to be a scientist is not to be a seller— 
a person who actually figures out ways to make scientific breakthroughs prac-
tically useful and distributes them via the construction (in the pursuit of self-
interest) of trading networks to those who can benefit from them. To invent 
a marvelous medicine is not the same thing as figuring out how to get it into 
the hands of as many people as possible, and to make it at lower resource 
cost. And such contributions as government has made to prosperity have 
been built mostly on the wealth generated by people buying and selling in the 
market, whether they are grand visionaries like Ford or small-scale dreamers 
like our stationery-shop owner.
How is it that entrepreneurs’ dreams become life-changing reality? A while 
back I mentioned the year 1780, and while one could quarrel about the exact 
year that the modern miracle began, it is clear that around that time in England 
something changed that led to the creation of modern industry, whose ben-
efits have since spread around the world. England was a country that pro-
tected property rights better than most, and following their two revolutions 
in the 1600s those rights were sufficiently well entrenched to set the table 
for the Industrial Revolution. A key lesson of all economic history is that 
for entrepreneurs to work their magic, they must have the freedom to try, 
which means also the freedom to fail. From both successes and failures, soci-
ety learns how to do things better. The fruits of economic freedom are plain 
to see not just in the achievements already of those countries that have relied 
on it the longest, but in the new success in places like China and India, where 
the degree of control the state has over private individuals in the economic 
arena has loosened dramatically in recent decades. Entrepreneurs make prog-
ress, and economic freedom makes entrepreneurs.
This freedom to experiment is necessary because the future is almost impos-
sibly hard to predict. It is not hard, in addition to the earlier predictors of 
doom, to find more mundane predictions about what the future would be 
like that failed to hold true. Artists gave it a shot, predicting (without much 
accuracy in the end) at the beginning of the 20th century what life would be 
like in Paris at the end of it.30 Science-fiction writers have also tried, imagin-
ing robots that would resemble humans physically, while cognitively remaining 
very fast computers. Such is the nature of the droids in Star Wars and, comi-
cally, the robot character in the over-the-top campy 1960s TV series Lost in

Space. (Look up a picture of this character if you want to see an example of 
what robots turn out not to look like.) Instead, they are industrial robots, like 
the one here.31
The movie 2001: A Space Odyssey had, by 2001, an elegant space station that 
among other things gave people a place to rest on their way to the permanent 
base on the moon. We have had space stations, of course, but they are con-
siderably more spartan. That movie also featured the human-like computer 
HAL, which malfunctioned when it was asked to lie like humans, forcing a 
human crew member to destroy it. In fact, computers became the incredibly 
useful things they are not just by becoming more powerful but by being linked 
together, first in local area networks and later across the planet through the 
Internet.
When the artificial language Esperanto was created in the second half of the 
19th century by Ludwig Zamenhof, it was assumed by many that it would 
become the language of the world, shoving aside widely spoken but paro-
chial languages like English and French. In fact, perhaps precisely because it 
was a centrally planned language with a set of rules imposed by its designer, 
Esperanto had no chance against the spontaneously ordered, constantly evolv-
ing languages that people actually speak. Indeed, if there is anything close to 
a world language now it is English, itself a spontaneously ordered combina-
tion of Germanic and Latin-descended languages that absorbs foreign words 
(pajamas, ennui) happily and is constantly in motion. Language is constantly 
evolving and wonderfully effective despite (because of?) the lack of central 
design. In that, it is like all economic change.
Much of humanity’s progress does not come from mere small extensions of 
the status quo, but consists of dramatic advances that come from unexpected 
places. They became important precisely because a free society already 
existed to create them, play with them, and see how best to use them. An 
example is the antibiotic penicillin, which was the result of an unexpected 
contamination of a laboratory experiment, which gave Alexander Fleming 
and other scientists a moment to seize in order to transform the way we 
treat bacterial diseases. (Antibiotics, like vaccines, have probably saved tens of  
millions of lives since their invention.) Tim Berners-Lee, the person credited 
with inventing HTML code (the primary language for building webpages), 
probably had no idea that his invention would lead to people engaging in 
microlending to fight poverty and fund businesses, solving previously unsolv-
able scientific problems through crowd-sourcing, and doing things as mundane 
as watching cats making music or a robust defense of Britney Spears on 
YouTube. Charles Townes, one of the men credited with helping invent the 
laser—a device now widely used to fix detached retinas and address retinal

damage caused by years of high blood sugar in older diabetics—was asked 
by The Economist in 2005 to talk of this use, and he replied by saying he had 
never heard of a detached retina. So it goes in a society willing to rely on the 
freedom to constantly experiment, in part on the basis of other experiments 
before yours.
The seductiveness of big centrally directed plans—the siren song of the poli-
tician who tells us that such-and-such are the jobs of the future or that the 
preservation of our way of life requires keeping this or that bankrupt com-
pany afloat with taxpayers’ money—probably comes from the way they seem 
to reflect our instinct as individuals. We are constantly, and properly, urged to 
prepare for the future by saving for retirement and our children’s education, 
to buy insurance against unexpected calamities, and so on. Many feel a little 
dismissive at the person who is unprepared, and this is a belief that cuts across 
cultures. Aesop had his fable of the ant and the grasshopper; the great ancient 
Indian sage Kautilya wrote in his work Arthashastra, which was advice for the 
leader who wanted to be wise, that “Tomorrow’s deed should be done today. 
What is to be done in the afternoon should be done in the forenoon.” Or, 
more straightforwardly, “Money should be saved for difficult days.” But this is 
advice for the individual, given precisely because the individual cannot predict 
what may come, and savings are a way to be ready for anything. The problem 
in the economy, in contrast, is that because we cannot from our satellite pre-
dict what people will invent or see down on the ground, what the details of 
trade-offs in the economy are, we must avoid committing to a specific path. 
The future is not a thing to be reached, it is a thing to be discovered or, better 
still, created.
The song “The Internationale,” originally written in France in 1871 as an anthem 
for the then-rising socialist movement, suggests in its American version that a 
better future only comes from organized agitation, even violent revolution—
that, to quote its words directly, through socialism “a better world’s in birth” 
and that “[t]he earth shall rise on new foundations.” Alas, it didn’t work out 
that way, as socialism failed in Russia, China, and pretty much everywhere it 
was tried for reasons outlined earlier in this book. It turns out that building a 
brighter future does not involve a lot of marching and violence against one’s 
oppressors. It is actually rather boring, not the stuff of movies or novels. It is 
nerds working late into the evening at Microsoft, it is stationery-store owners 
hoping their little economic experiment succeeds, it is hard-working immi-
grants in Los Angeles putting in 60-hour weeks so they and their children can 
move up to something better. It is competition and exchange and experiments 
successful and unsuccessful. It is not sexy, but it is how the future happens. 
There is only one dystopia, and it is the planner’s. Economic planning almost 
never works—regulating monopolies only strengthens them through regula-
tory capture, minimum wages for women unemploy them, helping “the work-
ing class” by strengthening unions keeps many workers from finding work, 
rent control limits lodging for the poor, zoning rules make housing impossibly

expensive, 116 agencies (the number of entities in the federal government 
controlling financial trading) worth of stock regulations don’t eliminate finan-
cial turmoil but do raise the cost of issuing and trading stock, and a $750 bil-
lion economic stimulus doesn’t lower the unemployment rate.32
On and on it goes, but still we never learn. Any society with decentralized, 
costly information—which is to say any society at all—must endure periods of 
instability and even painful retrenchment if it is to progress. It is entrepreneurs 
who carry out this process, who do the hard work of discovering a brighter 
future. Granting entrepreneurs the freedom to do their thing, including the 
freedom to fail, is the best solution for making a better world if that world is 
full of imperfect people making imperfect decisions. With any luck, with the 
passage of time, the role of the entrepreneur in building our better future will 
be more appreciated.

The Things Only 
Government 
Can Do
The Economics of “Market Failure”
Much of this book to this point has been a caution against—some might say 
a tirade against—excessive reliance on government to make sound decisions 
when resources are scarce, people pursue their self-interest, and information 
is costly. But as noted previously, government is among the oldest human 
institutions, and human institutions do not persevere so long—since the dawn 
of settled agriculture, perhaps 7,000 years ago—unless they bring some benefits. 
And although much of what government can do, as we have seen, is inimical 
to human achievement precisely because prices ordinarily provide incentives 
for people to use scarce resources to greatest social benefit, it turns out 
that sometimes market prices provide poor incentives. Government, by using 
its power to take command of resources or limit how they are used, can in 
fact use them more efficiently under these circumstances. The conditions 
required for this to be true, which also have relevance even outside the 
question of government versus private responses to resource-use decisions, 
must be carefully delineated, and this chapter does that.

Setting the Table for the Entrepreneur  
and the Market
The analysis so far has indicated first that markets, operating via the signals 
given by prices, cause resources to move toward where they can create the 
most value. In addition, it has argued that giving entrepreneurs (and everyone) 
the incentive to harvest costly decentralized knowledge ensures that as 
much of that knowledge as can be used will be used. But this requires that the 
government set up the institutions that allow people to trade, institutions that 
are easy to take for granted. Thus, it is important to understand that from the 
economic point of view the first task of government is to facilitate trade.
Foremost in the effort to facilitate trade is giving people confidence that their 
property is secure from seizure, both by private thieves and by agents of the 
government itself committing thievery under the color of authority. Recall our 
stationery store owner from Chapter 7. In recounting his little revolutionary 
act, we have actually assumed quite a bit. We have assumed first that it was 
a straightforward matter for him to come to an agreement with the owner 
of his storefront, to sign a contract that would allow him to use the space 
for a specified period of time in exchange for a specified payment. But who 
will make sure this agreement is held to? To some extent, it is self-enforcing. 
A store owner renting the store space who suddenly refused to pay the rent 
(perhaps by physically threatening the shopping-center owner) would acquire 
a reputation of being a deadbeat, and an owner of a shopping center who 
suddenly expelled his tenant halfway through the lease, perhaps by relying 
on his own private muscle, would have to cope with the reputation of being 
unreliable. So, people can uphold their agreements without the law.
Hasidic diamond traders, who operate in New York, Antwerp (Belgium), 
Israel, and India, among other places, are famous for doing business with one 
another without contracts, a common practice among middleman minorities. 
But sometimes people have honest disagreements about what a contract 
means—whether the store owner or shopping-center owner really can get 
out of the lease agreement—so the government’s courts provide a means 
for resolving these conflicts. The ability to enforce contracts makes people 
willing to commit to trade with each other, especially with people they don’t 
know well, which increases the amount of trade that occurs. In addition, if the 
person who owns the shopping center wants to sell it, the government can 
guarantee that the rights to decide how the property should be used can be 
reliably transferred from the old owner to the new. If someone vandalizes his 
property, lowering its value by making people more reluctant to do business 
there and increasing his costs, the state can after due process of law inflict the 
necessary punishment, thus deterring (imperfectly) that damage.

Reasonably Simple Economics
215
In general, in addition to enforcing contracts, another key function of   
government then is to protect the property rights of people from being violated. 
Government punishes those who steal cars or rob others at gunpoint, who 
commit acts of violence, who write contracts they never intend to fulfill (by 
selling fraudulent medicines, for example), and do other things that result 
in the destruction of value. Enabling exchange by enforcing property and con-
tract rights is the first economic task of the state. A society without meaningful 
enforcement of property rights is one in which people have to waste inor-
dinate amounts of resources defending themselves from others—by driving 
around in very costly armored vehicles, living in fortresses, and hiring private 
security guards, for example—all of which claim resources that could have 
been used to create wealth. And everyone’s potential gains from trade are 
lowered when people are unwilling to shop in or do business in certain 
neighborhoods because of the sense of danger. A society without contract 
enforcement is one in which people lack the confidence to do business with 
people whose reputations they do not know or trust (in other words, 
people for whom information on reliability or creditworthiness is too costly 
to obtain). If the would-be stationery-store owner is sufficiently worried that 
the contractual agreements he enters into will not be enforced, or that his 
profits will be taken (by robbers on the way home from work or by the govern-
ment in the form of an unanticipated tax on his profits), he will not take the 
risk of opening the store to being with.1
Note
■
 To talk meaningfully about exchange and property rights, we must assume an entity that 
can enforce property and contract rights. In every successful society, the government performs 
these tasks.
Note that, contrary to the claims of some, protecting property and contract 
rights is not something that benefits primarily the rich but actually the poor. 
The rich find it much easier to buy their way out of dangerous neighborhoods 
and can buy security protection that the poor cannot afford. The rich can leave 
their region or country if things get too bad, and they can rely on their reputa-
tions and their collateral to get access to capital. It is the poor—lacking assets 
to pledge as collateral or to use to protect themselves and their property 
1 The owner runs the risk of too much government as well as too little. If there are 1,000 
regulations that his store might violate, he runs the risk nearly every day of police officers 
coming in demanding bribes to look the other way rather than cite him for the 40 or 50 
obscure rules he is currently breaking. He might also have to worry, if the government 
itself can violate his property rights with impunity, that some official could take his store 
and give it to a crony just at the moment as it is starting to succeed. These things 
routinely happen every day in countries around the world.

Chapter 10 | The Things Only Government Can Do
216
(whether in rich countries like the U.S. or poor ones like Brazil or India, poor 
neighborhoods are the most dangerous ones)—who benefit most from the 
establishment of the rule of law. The law, uniformly and reliably enforced for 
rich and poor alike, is the key to providing the poor the capacity to work their 
way into something better. It is also the poor, people like Mohammed Bouazizi, 
who are most vulnerable to the power of the state to change the rules and to 
use its power to abuse and rob the citizenry. It is the poor who suffer most 
from high crime, abusive police, bureaucrats’ shakedowns, and the inability to 
get justice from the courts. The poor do not have access to these things until 
their rights are respected before the law. (If you do not believe that it is the 
poor who benefit the most from establishment of law and order, think about 
who is victimized most by crime and violence in contemporary America.)

When Prices Are Wrong
But there are times when simply allowing people to establish ownership of 
and use property in particular ways (whether it is actual land, other physical 
property such as vehicles, or abstract but nonetheless valuable property like 
human capital or time) actually leads to inferior results for society as a whole. 
To see how this happens, I will repeat a point I made in Chapter 3: prices are 
a way of making people take account of the consequences for everyone else 
of their choices. If they are not allowed to freely move up or down, bad things 
happen because people do not have to face all of these consequences.
Recall that the reason this happens is that supply and demand reflect, respec-
tively, social cost and social value. The supply curve tells us the price produc-
ers need in order to be willing to produce various quantities of goods, and this 
reflects the alternate uses the resources needed to produce this good have— 
in other words, the opportunity cost society must pay to use resources to 
produce any amount of this good. Demand tells us how much people will buy 
at any price, which is a sign of what each quantity is worth to them. Excessively 
high (low) prices lead to an adjustment downward (upward) in price and a 
corresponding adjustment in quantity, so that the price system reconciles the 
conflicting uses we have for scarce resources. In the (very simple) example 
from Chapter 7, those resources were a store location in a shopping center, 
the time of five workers, the supplies needed to run the stationery store, and 
the time of the entrepreneur/owner.
But now consider another kind of market—the market for steel. Manufacturing 
steel, like selling stationery, is an action that requires the imposition of costs 
on society in order to produce something that other members of society 

Reasonably Simple Economics
217
value. To oversimplify dramatically (to make the problem easy to explain), 
assume that to manufacture steel requires the entrepreneurs who own the 
company to stake claims to the following resources: the time of their workers, 
land to put their factory on, iron ore, and miscellaneous supplies. Just as in the 
case of the stationery store, the steel company will purchase these resources 
and combine them in whatever way maximizes profits and will only stay in 
business if the price they get for the steel they produce exceeds the combined 
opportunity cost of these resources. So far, the problem is just like that of 
the stationery-store owner. We may rely entirely on the market process  
to decide whether this steel company should continue to exist or not, and if 
so how much steel it should produce.
But in fact, the action of manufacturing steel imposes a major social cost 
that is not generated in any significant way by the action of selling stationery. 
In particular, the manufacture of steel also generates substantial air pollution. 
Is this a social cost? Certainly. It damages the health of others, and air pollu-
tion has also been shown to damage personal property of others—car wind-
shield wipers and tires wear out faster because of damage from all the gunk 
in the air in places like Los Angeles and Houston, for example. Next to human 
health, this is a secondary effect, but we still want to count it. The difference 
between this cost and other costs is that the entrepreneurs making decisions 
about the steel factory need not take account of this cost when they decide 
whether to pollute, and if so how much.
The pollution is thus an example of an external cost or negative externality—a 
cost of an action taken that is imposed on others but that does not have to be taken 
account of by the person taking the action. This is distinct from the cost imposed 
by the decision of the entrepreneurs to hire workers, buy land, and acquire all 
the other resources they need to make steel. Taking the action of luring them 
away from other uses also imposes costs on society, because those resources 
are not being used for some other purpose. But the entrepreneurs must take 
account of this cost because they must pay the owners of those resources a 
price that persuades the owners to allow them to be used for the purpose 
the entrepreneurs want to use them for. (This was a point made in Chapter 7.) 
We call these kinds of costs private costs—costs that must be taken account of 
by the person taking the action, or in the jargon of the economics trade, costs 
that must be internalized by the decision maker.
The same negative-externality effect is actually at work in traffic jams. When 
someone decides to take a trip in a car, he must take account of the private 
costs he imposes on himself. Among others, there is the marginal cost of the 
gasoline his car uses on the trip, wear and tear on the car, and the time costs 
he has to spend driving. He will not take a trip unless the benefits he expects 
to receive from it exceed these costs. But in fact he also imposes costs on 
others, because the fact that he is on the road means that other drivers have 
to slow down. He thus imposes external time costs on them. This effect may 

Chapter 10 | The Things Only Government Can Do
218
seem very small, but one need only look at a freeway in Los Angeles or Atlanta 
at rush hour to understand how small costs imposed by any individual can add 
up to dramatic costs in the aggregate. There is thus again a clear distinction 
between private costs and external costs. In a delicious irony, drivers who 
complain about the traffic problem are the problem, by their very presence 
on the road.
The trouble with external costs is that they are not included in the prices 
that guide decision making, but should be. Thus, the statement I made earlier 
about prices giving people reasons to take account of the consequences of 
their actions for others is no longer operative. Another way to think about 
it is in terms of our supply/demand model from Chapters 2–3. It can take 
account of the external-cost problem by altering it, as shown in Figure 10-1.

Figure 10-1.  Supply and demand with a negative externality
The solid black curve labeled “Supply (private costs)” is the supply curve 
based on the cost of a steel maker obtaining control over land, workers’ time, 
iron ore, and supplies. In essence, it is the supply curve we have been using 
up until now. But this curve neglects the external pollution costs. The dashed 
curve labeled “Supply (private + external costs)” incorporates these costs. 
It is assumed, for the sake of convenience, that each unit of steel produced 
imposes costs in the amount a on society, so that the two supply curves are 
parallel. This may not be true, but it makes explanation easier. The demand 
curve is just the demand curve, and reflects the value of various quantities of 
steel to society, measured as usual by what buyers—other businesses using 
steel in making the things they make; no one buys steel to keep around the 
house—are willing to pay. The graph simply depicts the idea outlined earlier, that 
the total cost to society of producing steel is higher than the costs that the 
steelmakers take into account when deciding how much steel to produce.

Reasonably Simple Economics
219
This means that the market equilibrium is not the best one, in the sense 
used in Chapter 3. Recall that that equilibrium occurs where the supply curve 
crosses the demand curve, at price P* and quantity Q*. But we want steel  
producers to take account of all of their costs, not just the private ones. If they 
had to take those into account, their decision making would be different.  
I denote this equilibrium with two asterisks instead of one, because it is a 
better equilibrium for society overall, if it can actually be achieved. If we incor-
porate the pollution costs into our decision making, as we should, then the 
price of steel will go up to P**, and quantity will go down to Q**. The failure 
of the steelmakers to take account of the external costs in their decision to 
make steel in whatever quantity means that steel is underpriced, that is, that 
the price does not reflect the full social cost of the action of making steel. 
Precisely because steel is too cheap, it is over-consumed. If we can figure out 
some way to lower steel production, preferably in a way that directly requires 
steel consumers to take account of the external costs their decision to buy 
steel imposes on society, in addition to the private (and therefore already 
internalized) ones, society will be better served.2
The traffic problem is the same in its nature, although not necessarily in its 
solution. Every traveler should be required to take account of the crowding 
costs imposed on other drivers if we are to achieve the efficient amount of 
(that is, reduce the number of) car trips. However, there is a way to make this 
happen. If the road is privately owned, the owner of the road will charge a 
price that takes account of the negative impact of each paying driver on his 
other paying drivers. This reveals a powerful insight about what negative exter-
nalities really are. They are simply a property right that is missing or, more accu-
rately, a right that is too costly to enforce. Road space is typically (although not 
always) available free of explicit monetary charge. If it were not, the owners of 
the road would set the price in the same way that the owner of the stationery 
store does for the things he sells. Frequently, costs that are external at the 
local level are not external at the level of the person making the decision.
For example, in restaurants if smokers and non-smokers are at adjacent tables 
there will be local externalities. If you like to smoke with dinner, and I hate hav-
ing my meal surrounded by cigarette smoke, then your act of lighting up makes 
my meal worse and thus imposes a negative externality on me. Critically, note 
that if you are not allowed to smoke with dinner, that makes the value of your 
meal worth less to you as well. In a sense, no matter how we best allocate the 
right—either I get the right to tell you not to smoke or you get the right to 
blow smoke over my table—someone will lose out. However, the restaurant 
owner wants to maximize profits. He will therefore have an incentive to trade 
2Note that even if steel producers are initially made to bear these costs—for example, by 
installing pollution-control equipment or paying a pollution tax on every ton of steel they 
produce—these costs will be passed on to consumers, as they should be.

Chapter 10 | The Things Only Government Can Do
220
off what smokers are willing to pay to smoke with their meals and what 
non-smokers are willing to pay to eat without the irritation of others’ smoke. 
At the level of the restaurant owner, in other words, there are no external 
costs. The system of property rights is sufficient to enable him to make the 
decision that balances the conflicting interests properly.
Note finally that the possible solutions to this conflict over the air are not 
limited to allow smoking everywhere or allow smoking nowhere. The restaurant 
owner also has it within his power to set up smoking and non-smoking sections, 
and to do so in ways that really do allow non-smokers to eat in the way they 
prefer. Thus, laws to prohibit smoking in all bars and restaurants, which of 
course exist in many locations, are actually inefficient, because they ignore the 
interests of smokers. (Although it makes no difference to whether the argu-
ment is a good one or not, I say this as someone who does not smoke and 
does not like the people at the table next to me to do so.) That restaurant 
owners in areas without laws that prohibit smoking do come up with a wide 
variety of smoking policies for their restaurants is testimony to the power of 
the spontaneous order in promoting social experimentation and the accom-
modation of disagreement about how scarce resources (restaurant seating in 
this case) should be used.
Note

  Externalities only matter if there is no market decision maker who can internalize them.
But whereas smoking in restaurants and taking up space on a road are locally 
external costs that can be internalized higher up by decision makers who own, 
respectively, the entire restaurant or the entire road, sometimes negative 
externalities are really not amenable to this kind of solution. The pollution 
problem in particular cannot be solved by relying on property rights. The prob-
lem of pollution, in essence, is that there is no way to enforce a right to air (or 
water, in the case of water pollution). There is no way to meaningfully enforce 
the idea that this air is mine and that air is yours, so that you are not allowed 
to pollute “my” air without my consent. In economic terms, a property right 
to air—dividing the air into mine and yours—is too costly to enforce, so 
there is no point in trying. In such circumstances, we have to try something 
else. One could require that certain kinds of pollution-control machinery be 
installed on all cars and in all factories. The problem with this approach is that 
the decisions about which controls to require will be made by self-interested 
politicians and bureaucrats, who will be ignorant about all possible pollution-
control options and may have an incentive to favor those who are closest to 
them or give them the most cash, as suggested in Chapter 5. A better solution 
is simply to limit the amount of pollution a factory is allowed to emit and leave 
it to factory owners to decide the lowest cost way to get pollution down to 
this level. This solution allows us to take advantage of the spontaneous order

to solve the pollution problem in the lowest-cost way possible by allowing the 
company to innovate in its pollution-control techniques.
Note that I say limit and not eliminate pollution. The reason is because of what 
pollution is. In economic thinking, pollution is not a sin, it is simply a bad (and 
unpriced) side effect of doing something good. The manufacture of steel, as 
with most actions that generate pollution, is an activity that also generates 
many social benefits. Steel enables modern transportation, allows the creation 
of taller, stronger buildings (both commercial and residential), and is generally 
nearly indispensable to modern life. As of now, there is no way to manufacture 
it without generating external pollution costs. So, bringing pollution from the 
steel industry down to zero would mean having no steel, which be a different 
kind of—and much more substantial—cost. The trick is to balance the two 
good things—less pollution and modern life—at the right place.
It is sometimes proposed that rights to pollute be created, in the form of 
permits that can be acquired which entitle the holder to generate the amount 
of pollution specified in the permit. These permits would be tradable like 
any other kind of property, allowing those companies that have no way of 
reducing their emissions except at very high cost to buy the permits from 
companies that can reduce emissions at very low cost. Such programs exist 
for air pollution in the Southern California region and for carbon emissions in 
the nations of the European Union. Unfortunately, because of such problems 
as uncertainty about how the market rules might change, it is not clear that 
these programs achieve substantial cost savings. It is also possible simply to 
tax the output of the item whose manufacture generates the pollution. In the 
situation in Figure 10-1, this is an easy solution. Every steel company should 
simply be required to pay tax in the amount of a on every unit of steel they 
produce. This approach makes the pollution generated into a private cost, 
eliminating the externality problem. Because a is the amount of social cost 
that the manufacturers were not taking account of because it was external 
and not private, the market now properly harmonizes the cost of manufactur-
ing steel with the value to society of making it.
As a practical matter, though, pollution externalities may not be constant over 
all ranges of production, and so this approach too may have limits. Sometimes, 
outright bans might be the lowest-cost way to solve externalities. If your loud 
parties are keeping me awake in the apartment upstairs, that is a negative 
externality imposed by your guests on me, and the typical approach to that is 
simply to have the police threaten legal sanction for those who do not get the 
noise down. That is almost certainly the most straightforward way to solve 
that problem, rather than having people buy and sell “permits” to make noise. 
So, all we can say about the negative externality is the following: if a reliable 
property right can be created or already exists at some higher level of decision mak-
ing, the externality problem can be resolved easily. If not, we just have to do the best 
we can in figuring out the lowest-cost way to solve it, by the application of some kind 
of government rules if necessary.

Chapter 10 | The Things Only Government Can Do
222
Positive Externalities
In principle, there is no reason why the value to society of an action taken 
cannot exceed the value to the person taking the action. Thomas Sowell cites 
the example of mudflaps. With the exception of the value that some people 
take from having what we can charitably call mudflap artwork on the backs of 
their vehicles, almost all the social value of installing a mudflap actually accrues 
to other drivers. One’s own vehicle does not ordinarily throw rocks that 
damage one’s own windshield. Instead, the crack happens because of a rock 
that somebody else’s car threw up. Again, as with the case of an outright ban 
on loud parties, the most straightforward solution is probably just to require 
that owners of sufficiently large vehicles (certainly semi trucks, perhaps large 
pickup trucks as well) install them. People who keep their homes well maintained 
do so at some cost to themselves, but some of the benefits flow to the neigh-
bors in the form of less irritation from looking at dilapidated property and 
from higher property values. The social benefit to a well-maintained home, in 
other words, is greater than the private benefit to the homeowner. Of course, 
this is often an externality that is local at the level of the individual owner but 
which real estate developers properly internalize by including rules on home 
upkeep in their housing-association rules.3
What to Do
The externality problem is a complicated one. It is easy to invoke whenever 
we don’t like the choices someone else has made. Almost any action can be 
held to cause emotional externalities to people who get sufficiently upset 
because the action was performed, and many actions that are more concrete 
externalities are trivial in scale. Paul Heyne has noted that “the beginning of 
all wisdom on this topic is a clear recognition that negative externalities  
cannot be completely eliminated.”4 Good manners (knocking on your neigh-
bor’s door and asking him to turn the music down, keeping your property well 
maintained) eliminate many negative externalities, and self-sorting through 
the market process eliminates others.
Near where I live, which is in the countryside a bit but where many larger 
homes are currently being constructed, there is a farmer who has erected 
a sign by the road that tells others that agricultural activities from time to 
3Note that these are not the same thing as zoning rules, because there is no criminal 
penalty for failing to observe them and because it is much easier to choose whether or 
not to live in a particular housing development on the basis of its rules rather than, for 
example, to choose whether or not to live in California, which has extensive land-use 
controls imposed on the entire state.

time generate noise and stench, that he was there first, and to keep that in 
mind when deciding whether to move here and complain about it. People 
sufficiently bothered by such things will be inclined not to live there rather 
than move there and demand that the externality—the result of farming 
as it is most efficiently done, externality aside—be eliminated by legal action. 
In cities, one often observes families with children, or singles who want to live 
near active night life, tending to self-sort into neighborhoods full of others 
like them, meaning that not every problem that crosses a property line calls 
out for a law. But we must confess that there are times when the externality 
is so pronounced that we must consider legally mitigating it in the interest of 
the greater social good.
The “Market Failure” of Nonexcludability  
and Nonrivalry
Several times a year, public television and radio stations have fundraisers. 
In these events, the stations engage in various activities to persuade people to 
give money to support something that they can get for free. As an aside, as best 
I can tell, the ways in which public TV stations do this has changed over time. 
When I was young, they had the pledge drive, in which staff members of the 
stations standing in front of a phone bank beseeched the public to give money. 
Later this was replaced by an auction, in which local merchants would donate 
goods to be sold to the highest bidder, with the station getting funds. Now, it 
seems that they run previously aired concerts and other beloved programs 
designed to appeal to public TV viewers to give money, usually accompanied 
by a prerecorded announcement by the station and a continuous subtitle with 
the number to call. This shows that even nonprofit institutions like public TV 
stations still respond to some degree to incentives, and to some degree are 
entrepreneurs constantly in search of new ways to do things.
The audience for public broadcasting values it as a good. But public broad-
casting is unlike many goods in that one can consume it whether one pays 
a monetary price or not. (One must still pay a time price, although increas-
ingly new entertainment technology allows people to watch shows when they 
want to rather than when the TV network wants them to, allowing the viewer 
to select the block of time with the lowest opportunity cost.) Standard eco-
nomic theory would predict that people would tend not to pay money for 
things that they can get, in monetary terms, for free. And indeed the vast 
majority of people who consume public broadcasting do not contribute to 
the stations they watch and listen to. There would be a simple way to solve 
this problem, which is the way private, for-profit broadcasters solve it, that 
is, by charging businesses for the rights to broadcast commercials on these 
stations. But public broadcasters are unwilling to use these methods, and so 
they choose the method of begging instead. This means their budget is lower, 

Chapter 10 | The Things Only Government Can Do
224
but it also means they are less constrained in their broadcast choices, by not 
having to worry about whether advertisers are willing to be associated with 
certain programs. (Or maybe they face different constraints, since they do have 
to worry about what their donors want to watch.)
I’ll Eat, You Pay: Nonexcludability
The core problem of the public broadcaster is actually relatively common. 
It is called nonexcludability, which means the inability to prevent people who do 
not pay for a service from consuming it. In a sense, this too is the problem of 
a property right that is too costly to enforce. If technology were available 
that allowed only people who paid for public broadcasting to receive it, in 
the same way there is technology (and there are laws and social norms) that 
prevents people from walking in to Walmart and walking out with a computer 
without paying for it, the public radio station would simply make its signal 
available only to those who had paid. Indeed there are such technologies, such 
as cable, satellite radio, and satellite TV. In these technologies, nonpayers are 
clearly excludable. Thus, these companies need not go periodically to their 
audiences pleading for money. And even over-the-air broadcasters possess 
one excludable resource: their programming time. Only those who pay for ad 
space actually get to run them on a commercial radio or television station, and 
so, as with all normal market processes, the amount of commercial time, and 
the specific commercials that fill it, are entrepreneurial decisions made in the 
context of the known trade-offs, so as to maximize profit.
But nonexcludability presents a significant economic problem. If people do 
not have to pay, no matter how valuable an action taken by an entrepreneur is 
to them, entrepreneurs get inadequate signals as to how valuable the action 
is, and under-produce it. In general the things will, depending on the circum-
stances, be overused or under-produced. In the public radio example, the 
fact that many consume without paying probably means that there is less 
public radio then there should be, evaluated by the usual economic criterion 
of whether a marginal increase in the production of it would create more  
marginal value than marginal cost. The reliance on the volunteer model means 
that public radio stations have fewer reporters, less variety of music, fewer 
features on their web sites, and so on than listeners would be willing to pay 
for—if only some way could be found to get them to do so.
What to do about such underpayment? As with externalities, if it is possible 
to make the good excludable, that is the ideal solution. For example, there 
is constant warfare between for-profit makers of digital content (software, 
books, songs, etc.) and some of the users of such content. When a book 
means a physical good that one buys at a bookstore and holds while reading, 
the value lost to nonpayers consuming the product is relatively small. 
One person who buys it can share it with a friend, or a person can at great 

Reasonably Simple Economics
225
expense (probably much greater than the cost of simply buying the book) 
copy it. He can also borrow it from a library, but libraries typically wait until 
prices have come down before ordering books, so libraries are a poor sub-
stitute for the customers who want the book the most and are most willing 
to pay the most for it. So, there is a nonexcludability problem for physical 
books, but it is small.
But the turning of more and more human knowledge, including books and 
music, into digital form has generated new problems for creators of such 
content. In principle, one can write a book or record a song, have one 
person pay for it as digital content, and then watch helplessly as that person 
transmits it freely around the world. One response to this nonexcludability 
problem is the law-first response, to impose legal penalties on people who 
access such content without paying for it, in violation of what are known as 
copyright laws. In addition, in an effort to prevent so-called “piracy” of content, 
many sellers of DVDs, digital music, etc. include coding that makes it diffi-
cult for the content to be copied.5 When one downloads music from iTunes, 
for example, one cannot just e-mail the music at will to all of one’s friends. 
Naturally, people who want to access this content without paying for it, and to 
allow others to do the same, try to break these digital barriers through their 
own computer coding. This practice is generally illegal under the 1998 Digital 
Millennium Copyright Act and other laws in the U.S. and elsewhere. Given 
the large number of people engaging in efforts to break through the copying   
barriers imposed by content producers and access the content, the battle 
against piracy is probably a losing proposition, although the entertainment 
industry is nonetheless committed to fighting it.
5 Some of these barriers are implemented as much to enable what is known as price 
discrimination—charging different prices to different people for the same products—as 
to prevent copying. When one buys a videogame or DVD in East Asia, regional coding 
will sometimes mean that one cannot use it on a machine purchased in North America. 
This means that consumers cannot buy the content where it is cheaper than in their 
local market and then have it shipped, nor can they buy it where it is cheaper and resell 
it where it is more expensive. The fact that price is set differently in different markets is 
an act of price discrimination by the sellers of the content—trying to match prices to 
willingness to pay. If people in Asia aren’t willing to pay as much for video games as people 
in North America, then it is profitable to charge people in North America more, and 
regional coding helps achieve this. Other examples of price discrimination include giving 
veterans and some students discounts for movie tickets (their average willingness to pay 
is lower), charging higher prices to airline customers to buy their tickets a few days before 
the flight leaves (done mostly by business travelers or others with higher willingness to 
pay), and college financial aid, which operates by extracting from every applicant detailed 
financial information, which also suggests his personal willingness to pay. What do you 
suppose would happen if a seller were required by law to charge the same price to all 
customers? (Go to http://www.insidehighered.com/news/2012/04/17/supreme-
court-will-hear-case-major-implications-textbook-prices to read a legal case 
that involves price discrimination in the college-textbook market, although it is not the 
central issue in the case.)

The author Stephen King in 2000 tried a different approach, releasing a book 
called The Plant one chapter at a time online, and “charging” a dollar for each 
chapter, but without restricting people’s access rights if they didn’t pay. This 
model is very similar to the public broadcasting one and it had similar results. 
Some people did contribute, but King said he would not continue to put out 
chapters unless 75% of those who downloaded chapters paid the fee. In the 
end, he decided not to finish releasing the book, because too few people 
were paying. It remains unfinished, an example of a valuable product that is 
under-produced because those who are willing to pay are not made to pay as 
a condition of acquiring it—an example, in other words, of nonexcludability, 
although a nonexcludability that King consented to.
Nonexcludability can also result in over-consumption as well as under- 
production. The classic example was provided by the writer Garrett Hardin, 
an ecologist very concerned about over-consumption of the world’s natural 
resources. He asked us to think about a pasture that is used for grazing by a 
group of people, each of whom owns his own cattle. The pasture is not fenced 
in, and anyone is free to use it. Each cattle owner is assumed to be interested 
only in maximizing the income from his own cattle. Each time a cow grazes, 
the owner of the cow receives the entire benefit, but there is less grass 
available for all the other owners. Thus, benefits are private but costs are 
collective. This, he claims, is a recipe for overuse of the resource. In deciding 
how many cattle to own and how frequently to graze them, each owner will 
consider only his own private benefit. This will mean that there are too many 
cattle, and that the pasture is over-grazed.
Hardin’s example itself turns out not to be such a problem, precisely because 
individuals, left their own devices, have come up with ways to manage this 
problem by allocating rights to use the “common” pasture—in other words, 
by making it not so common after all. Closely knit communities seem to be 
able, according to the research of another economist named Elinor Ostrom, 
to limit overuse. In a far different time and a far different place, Governor 
William Bradford of Plymouth Plantation in 1623 fretted over the fact that his 
colonists chronically ran short of grain and produce. He eventually decided, 
in consultation with the colonists, to change the method of ownership from a 
common field worked by all to a series of private plots of land, each entrusted 
to one family. The result? According to Bradford’s own testimony:
This had very good success, for it made all hands very industrious, 
so as much more corn was planted than otherwise would have been 
by any means the Governor or any other could use, and saved him 
a great deal of trouble, and gave far better content. The women 
now went willingly into the field, and took their little ones with

them to set corn; which before would allege weakness and inability; 
whom to have compelled would have been thought great tyranny 
and oppression.
The experience that was had in this common course and condition, 
tried sundry years and that amongst godly and sober men, may 
well evince the vanity of that conceit of Plato’s and other ancients 
applauded by some of later times; that the taking away of property 
and bringing in community into a commonwealth would make 
them happy and flourishing; as if they were wiser than God. For this 
community (so far as it was) was found to breed much confusion 
and discontent and retard much employment that would have been 
to their benefit and comfort. For the young men, that were most 
able and fit for labour and service, did repine that they should spend 
their time and strength to work for other men’s wives and children 
without any recompense. The strong, or man of parts, had no more 
in division of victuals and clothes than he that was weak and not 
able to do a quarter the other could; this was thought injustice. 
The aged and graver men to be ranked and equalized in labours and 
victuals, clothes, etc., with the meaner and younger sort, thought 
it some indignity and disrespect unto them. And for men’s wives 
to be commanded to do service for other men, as dressing their 
meat, washing their clothes, etc., they deemed it a kind of slavery, 
neither could many husbands well brook it. Upon the point all being 
to have alike, and all to do alike, they thought themselves in the 
like condition, and one as good as another; and so, if it did not cut 
off those relations that God hath set amongst men, yet it did at 
least much diminish and take off the mutual respects that should be 
preserved amongst them.6
The making of a nonexcludable resource into an excludable one, in other 
words, not only increased production but increased people’s respect for one 
another, perhaps because it made them more conscious of the costs they 
imposed on others in their decisions. Markets and property rights once again 
became a way to peacefully and productively resolve conflicts over scarce 
resource use.
But in other circumstances, this over-consumption, which is called the tragedy 
of the commons (a term Hardin invented), is a severe problem. In recent years 
the European Union has expressed great concern about overfishing by its  
fishermen in the waters of the Mediterranean, in the North Sea, and off the 
coast of Northwest Africa. This problem has arisen because in recent decades 
6http://press-pubs.uchicago.edu/founders/documents/v1ch16s1.html

Chapter 10 | The Things Only Government Can Do
228
there have been dramatic technological improvements in the ability of 
fishermen to harvest more fish with fewer resources, particularly through 
the use of large drift nets, which stretch miles across the ocean and trap huge 
numbers of fish, which the fisherman then sell. Unfortunately, those fish are 
necessary to produce the next generation of fish, and so to take them now 
imposes negative externalities on future generations of fishermen. But since 
that cost will not be borne by any individual fishermen, he neglects it.
This is the overuse version of the nonexcludability problem in a nutshell: 
benefits are privatized, costs are externalized. As a result, fish stocks in these 
regions (and elsewhere) seem to have declined substantially in recent years. 
Indeed, if each farmer is aware of the tragedy of the commons problem, he 
has an incentive to take as many fish as possible as quickly as possible, before 
some other fisherman does, in the manner of two people both given straws 
to drink out of the same glass—each one feels compelled to drink faster to 
make sure he gets it and the other guy doesn’t.
Other examples abound. Apparently, people who run marathons are growing 
increasingly irritated at people who run in the races without paying the neces-
sary entry fees.7 Operating a marathon requires acquiring control over scarce 
resources, in particular the time of staff members, the food and water that 
runners use during and after the race, T-shirts and medals, and the police who 
must be hired to shut down roads and patrol them while the race is going on. 
Apparently the nonexcludability problem is partially combated by race organiz-
ers hiring people to try to look out for counterfeit bibs that that these so-called 
“bandits” print themselves using the latest technology, but this is largely futile. 
There was also a time when American coffee shops used to charge people for 
access to Wi-Fi on their premises, because they had the problem of people 
buying one coffee and staying for hours and using the Internet, preventing the 
tables from being used by other paying customers. (In some other countries 
this charge is still the practice in places like Starbucks. Why the practice is 
different in different places is an interesting topic for speculation.) During the 
Occupy Wall Street protests in 2011–2012, a group of activists, secure in their 
knowledge of the wickedness of private property, took over8 a foreclosed 
home in New York City and announced that it would be made available to the 
homeless. By the time journalists got around to visiting the house two months 
later, the original occupants were gone, and there were new squatters occupy-
ing the property. Meanwhile, the property had been destroyed and valuable 
equipment stolen—over-consumed, in other words.

But once again, the problem is not greed or sin or insufficient lack of green 
consciousness; the problem is simply an inability to establish property rights. 
Private fish farms exist all over the world, and they never run out of fish. The 
reason for that is that when the farm’s owner sells a fish to some middleman 
who wants to sell it to a restaurant or a supermarket, the fisherman must 
think about the consequences for his own future fish stocks. In addition, 
private fish farms can erect fences that prevent those unauthorized by the 
owners from harvesting the fish there. In short, a nonexcludable resource in 
the ocean is an excludable one in a fish farm. If nonexcludable resources can 
be made excludable, the tragedy of the commons is solved.
Southern Africa has long had a problem with poaching of large mammals, 
elephants in particular. But in the 1980s and 1990s, several southern African 
governments stopped using environmental ministries to create national parks 
to try to manage elephant populations and prevent poaching, and replaced 
this approach with one in which local authorities were given the rights to 
manage their own elephant populations in their own self-interest. Whereas 
for the poacher the primary task is to get elephants as quickly as possible so 
that their ivory may be sold to make goods (primarily medicines sold in the 
Far East)—meaning that the best choice is to look for elephants and shoot 
them—giving local people an ownership right to the elephants gave them both 
better incentives than the government had to fight poaching and an incentive 
to manage the populations intelligently. As a result, sharp population declines 
were reversed9 in countries like Zimbabwe, partly by obtaining the ivory by 
simply culling it from tusks without killing the elephant.
Even without guidance from a very distant administration in Washington, new 
landowners in the American West in the latter half of the 19th century devel-
oped cattle branding as a way to distinguish the cattle of different owners, and 
later entrepreneurs developed barbed wire to make cattle excludable. As a 
result, in sharp contrast to relatively rare animals which some humans value 
but which lack property-rights protection (also known as endangered species), 
no one ever worries about running out of cattle. (The unowned buffalo of the 
Plains, in contrast, were nearly hunted to extinction, partly but not entirely as 
a tactic of war against the Plains Indians.) Again, the spontaneous order is very 
creative in coming up with ways to solve “market failure” problems.
Sometimes, whether a situation reflects over-consumption or under-production 
really depends on the perspective from which one looks at the problem. In 
February 2006, in the town of Monett, Missouri, the local fire brigade—which 
is funded entirely by dues collected from people who choose to pay them—
went to the scene of a house fire but refused to put the fire out because the 
home was owned by someone who was not a member of the association.

Chapter 10 | The Things Only Government Can Do
230
His unwillingness to pay annual dues meant that the association had less 
money to spend on equipment purchases and maintenance, and so to provide 
service to all comers—in other words to make the resource nonexcludable—
would have resulted in, depending on how one looks at it, over-consumption 
by the residents given the amount of equipment bought, or inadequate equip-
ment bought given the number of people to be protected.10 But no matter 
how one looks at it, nonexcludability is a social problem. The inability to make 
users pay fees commensurate with the value they attach to particular goods 
means that resources are used inefficiently. When nonexcludable resources 
can be made excludable, just as when external costs can be made internal, 
the problem ceases to exist.
But once again, the creation of private property rights is not always possible. 
The problem of air pollution mentioned earlier can also be thought of as a 
tragedy of the commons problem. Clean air and water are common, unowned 
resources. People “over-consume” them by dumping pollutants into them in 
the course of their private activities. Eventually, the air and water become 
dangerously poisonous. Here, as suggested previously, there are no alternatives 
to using government to limit these costly decisions. In such cases as overfishing 
on the open sea (it is very difficult to divide up the ocean into mine and yours 
in a meaningfully enforceable way) or air pollution, government intervention 
to limit this over-consumption has the potential to force resources to be used 
more efficiently.
A similar problem occurs nearly every day in the campus restaurant where  
I get my afternoon snack. Every morning the floor is clean, but people choose 
to “consume” this clean space by leaving food all over it. By the time I get 
there, the place is routinely filthy. Ideally, the cost of that dirtying should be 
borne by the people causing it. The expense necessary to police each diner’s 
behavior (and the negative effect it would have on demand to attend or work 
at my university if people, both those who clean up after themselves and 
those who don’t, felt like they were constantly being monitored) means that 
those who consume the clean space cannot be excluded. In principle, social 
norms, as Elinor Ostrom suggested, are sufficient to keep the nonexcludable, 
rivalrous resource from being over-consumed. (Indeed, some public spaces 
are not trashed in this manner, although many are; I am hard-pressed to think 
of an explanation other than differences in the probability of being caught or 
differences in moral codes that will explain this.) Most problems of dirtying 
the environment have this tragedy-of-the-commons feel to them.
But note also that the definition of “dirtying” is context-dependent. Every 
major-league baseball game is attended by thousands of individuals, many of

whom throw all kinds of trash on the stadium floor over the course of the 
game. And yet the next night when the first fans enter the ballpark, all of that 
trash is gone. Obviously, the owners have seen to it that this trash is hauled 
away expeditiously; because their consumers have made it clear to them that 
they attach value to the seating being litter-free when they get there, even as they 
apparently also value the ability to throw peanut shells at will on the ground.  
The contrast to many public highways, where litter is common, is striking.
Nonrivalrous Consumption—of Public Goods
The Coca-Cola Corporation is famous for protecting its “secret formula,” the  
ingredients and instructions for making its famous signature drink. Indeed, 
the secrecy of the recipe (although versions of it can be found all over the 
Web) is marketed by the company as part of the product’s appeal. There is 
now a World of Coca-Cola in Atlanta, a sort of theme park/museum for the 
sugary, caffeinated drink, and the formula is actually said to be in a large vault 
there, with the vault (although of course not the formula itself) on display 
in the building. Taking for granted the company’s assertion that the formula 
really is a secret, it is clear why they would want it to remain so. The formula 
is a form of knowledge, and the thing about knowledge is that your having it 
doesn’t prevent my having it also. Unlike many goods—for example, a sand-
wich, where my consumption of it leaves less available for you—if you and  
I both copy the formula down, the fact that I know it doesn’t mean you can’t 
also know it. Our brains can both “consume” the knowledge at the same 
time. But we cannot both consume the same sandwich—it must only go to 
one of us. In most contexts, including some of the ones mentioned in Chapter 
4, making knowledge publicly available is actually a good thing. It is better if 
more people know how to read and do math than if fewer do, and it is good 
that a new scientific breakthrough is immediately propagated to the scientific 
community. Einstein’s theory of general relativity, the formulas in Newtonian 
mechanics that it partly replaced, the Darwinian theory of evolution, the eco-
nomic distinction between marginal and sunk cost, and every other form of 
scientific knowledge can be held simultaneously by many people. Indeed, it can 
be acquired at near-zero marginal cost by a large number of people. Think 
about a number of people sitting in a large lecture hall, listening to a phys-
ics professor talk about Newton’s three laws of motion. The student in the 
middle of the front row sits, listens, and learns, but the student sitting right 
behind him does much the same thing, with no extra effort required on the 
part of the professor. He speaks simultaneously to the entire classroom.
This characteristic of some goods, whereby consumption by one person 
does not come at the expense of consumption by others, is called nonrivalry.  
Its opposite then is called rivalry, which means that when I consume it there 
is indeed less available for you. Most of the goods discussed in previous 
chapters have been rivalrous. If I buy a computer, the only way you can buy 

Chapter 10 | The Things Only Government Can Do
232
one is for one more to be made. If six cupcakes have been baked, my eating 
one means one less for everybody else. And in some of this chapter’s exam-
ples too, the good in question is rivalrous. An elephant slain and its tusks’ 
ivory turned into medicine means that there are fewer elephants avail-
able for others. The examples in the prior paragraph, in contrast, are nonri-
valrous. At first, nonrivalry seems to contradict the idea of scarcity—if  
I can consume without lowering the amount available for you, what exactly is 
scarce? But remember that the production of the goods still requires acquisi-
tion of resources that are scarce.
Nonrivalry introduces a complication into market decision making. The 
increase in production of a good resulting from one person’s decision to pay 
for it actually becomes available to many other people at the same time, so 
that the total social value of the decision to pay for the good is actually much 
greater than the value to the individual who makes the payment.11 In some 
sense, in fact, the action of making a nonrivalrous good available is really just 
generating a large-scale positive externality, that is, a positive externality that 
affects many other people.
What kinds of goods might have these characteristics? Think about flood con-
trol. Suppose we survey each individual who might be potentially protected by 
a levee constructed next to a river to lower the probability of it flooding and 
ask him how much he would be willing to pay to construct it. When answer-
ing this question (assuming he answers it honestly and is only considering his 
self-interest), he will think about the benefits of having the levee protect his 
own house. If it exists, it will provide some protection for his house against 
the risk of flooding. But the levee will protect all homes in the neighborhood 
simultaneously. And the higher the levee, the higher the flood has to be before 
the levee is breached. So in terms of benefits to residents, higher is better. But 
each individual is only thinking about his own private benefits, even though 
social benefits for every extra row of bricks in the levee are much higher 
than the benefits to any individual homeowner. The result of the fact that any 
individual’s financial contribution has far greater social benefits than private 
ones to that individual is that each individual, under voluntary provision of 
resources to build the levee, contributes too little. Each individual free-rides, in 
other words, just as in the public-radio example.
Our flood-control system has another problem, namely that there is no way 
to build the dam in such a way that only those who have paid for it are pro-
tected by it. This of course is the excludability problem already discussed. 
When a good is both nonrivalrous and nonexcludable, it is called a public good. 
(Note that this definition is very specific and is not the same thing as a good 
11Technically, the marginal social value of one individual’s purchase of a nonrivalrous 
good is actually equal to the sum of the marginal values of all the individuals who 
can consume it. This is a mathematical detail that is not particularly important for the 
discussion that follows.

Reasonably Simple Economics
233
used by the public.) What to do about this problem? One way to overcome 
it is to have the government simply forcibly extract the amount of resources 
necessary to build the levee to a height at which the marginal value of the 
last dollar spent—a little more protection for a slightly more serious flood 
times the damage to all homes if this flood happens—equals the marginal cost 
to the citizens of the last dollar taken from them. Such direct provision, or 
at least construction, of a good (management can be contracted out to a 
private company, although owing to the power of government workers in 
government decision making, outlined in Chapter 4, this may not happen) 
is nearly universal for some kinds of goods. Almost every country on earth 
takes money from its citizens to pay for its military, which provides a non-
excludable product—how can the military defend everybody but me?—that 
is probably also nonrivalrous (adding 10,000 more soldiers simultaneously 
makes everybody safer from invasion from Canada or Mexico). So too is the 
navigational information provided by GPS. So too is mosquito control in hot, 
Gulf Coast cities. In each case, if individuals contributed voluntarily, they would 
do so by treating their own private benefit from increased contributions 
as the full social benefit, when in fact, their contribution is benefiting many  
others as well.
Infrastructure also has this quality to some degree. A broadband network can, 
up to a point, be used by many people simultaneously, as can a road grid or 
electricity system. If a private company sought to build such a system, an indi-
vidual’s willingness to pay would reflect only the value of the grid to him, even 
though the broadband cables, roads, and power lines can simultaneously be 
used by many. Thus, relying on such private fees paid voluntarily would lead to 
a system with too little capacity. Therefore, infrastructure is often built under 
public authority.12 Again, once the infrastructure has been constructed, each 
individual can pay for his own use, so there is no reason that governments 
must manage infrastructure that has already been built. But it is plausible that 
government construction of it by reliance on forcibly confiscated tax revenues 
yields an outcome that is better than the free-market solution. It is up to the 
government perhaps (at least for now) to launch satellites that make GPS 
navigation possible, but the software enabling one to use it can be designed in 
an excludable way. And thus…
Excludability Is the Key Issue
Another example of a nonrivalrous good has already been mentioned: broad-
cast signals. If I am watching ESPN in my apartment, there is not less ESPN 
signal available for you. This is a classic example of a nonrivalrous good, as 
12Note, though, that access to broadband cable is excludable, requiring a device that can 
access the information of the company that offers the service. The ease of laying these 
cables down has made broadband excludable from the beginning.

Chapter 10 | The Things Only Government Can Do
234
is any radio or television broadcast. But the signals are excludable, and so 
there is no reason to suppose that relying on private entrepreneurs to decide 
how many television programs to broadcast will fail to capture the full social 
value of these programs. If a lot of people like the television show on a cable 
channel, advertisers will pay higher fees to advertise on that show, which 
makes that channel more willing to carry it. The advertising space itself is 
both excludable and rivalrous, so no issue of “market failure” presents itself.  
Over-the-air broadcasts can be accessed without paying a fee, but the 
commercial spaces are also excludable and rivalrous. What these examples 
suggest is that nonrivalry per se is not a bar to private production—what  
matters is whether nonpayers can be excluded. The very fact that advertising 
rates for radio and television shows are based on ratings is evidence that 
buyers and sellers of advertising take account of the nonrivalry effect when 
deciding what programs to broadcast on. If universities offer courses over 
the Web (a nonrivalrous medium), all that is required to elicit the right 
amount of such courses is the ability to limit participants to those who pay 
whatever price is charged.
Indeed, the modern telecommunications/Internet revolution has demon-
strated that as long as nonpayers can be excluded, there is sufficient incentive 
even to construct infrastructure for nonrivalrous goods. Cell-phone towers 
now dot the landscape, with several companies often building their networks 
of them from sea to shining sea.13 Much broadband infrastructure has been 
publicly constructed, especially overseas, but much of it has also been laid 
down at private expense, as some railroads were, contrary to conventional 
wisdom, in the 19th century.14
The reluctance, for electoral reasons, to means-test many government-benefit 
programs—in other words, to only make them available to people whose 
income falls below a certain level—is a practice that enables another tragedy 
of the commons. People can consume government spending, which is pro-
vided by others, and only think about the costs to themselves, in the form of 
higher taxes they personally will have to pay. There is a natural tendency to 
13One of the most frequent obstacles encountered is not any public-goods problem but 
special-interest opposition by those who find the towers aesthetically displeasing or, 
despite much evidence to the contrary, to be emitters of dangerous radiation. This 
opposition is willing to get the government to forcibly deprive others of the opportunity 
to communicate so that their tastes may be indulged (http://ridgewood.patch.com/
articles/poll-is-cell-tower-opposition-nimby). This is an illustration of the 
ability of small, motivated groups to disproportionately affect the political process, as 
noted in Chapter 5.
14For an interesting account of how one private entrepreneur, James J. Hill, was able 
to build a private railroad and make money from it, while other railroads looted the 
taxpayers and purposely built the railroads inefficiently to extract more government 
subsidies, see the account of Mr. Hill’s life given in Chapter 3 of Burton Fulsom’s The Myth of 
the Robber Barons (Hemdon, VA: Young America’s Foundation, 1987).

Reasonably Simple Economics
235
want to displace the expenses of, for example, medical care and retirement 
onto other people. Government spending thus becomes a sort of commons, 
which the citizenry over-consumes. Even means-tested programs (programs 
that can only be used by people whose income is below a certain level, like 
food stamps or Medicaid) are subject to this problem, if people who will pass 
the means test are allowed to vote on whether to enact the benefit. This is 
undoubtedly part of the reason why government spending has expanded to 
incorporate so many activities that individuals were expected to fund on their 
own in previous generations, with retirement and health care being the two 
biggest examples. Government spending thus becomes a kind of unfenced 
pasture, which the citizenry over-grazes.
The Creation of Scientific Knowledge
As noted earlier, the discovery of new knowledge—such as the creation 
of new radioactive elements, the conducting of experiments that reveal 
unknown truths about atomic structure or the cataloging of plants and animals 
in the rain forest—creates a good that is nonrivalrous. Again, the fact that 
one person knows a thing doesn’t leave any less of the knowledge available 
for anyone else (although each person has to spend resources individually 
to acquire the knowledge). But in some contexts, companies may want to 
keep information they discover about how to create better products secret—
and better here, as always, means of more value to consumers, as revealed 
by their willingness to pay. The Coca-Cola formula is one obvious example. 
But companies often hold their employees to agreements not to reveal 
trade secrets—information that, if it falls into the hands of a competitor, will 
lower the company’s profits by increasing the substitutability of competi-
tors’ products. This is information that is costly to create (how many unsuc-
cessful experiments were there before the Coca-Cola secret formula was 
perfected?), but which can be possessed by many people simultaneously.   
If most of the social benefits flow to others, the incentive for the company 
to invest in producing knowledge is insufficient. But if the knowledge can 
be made excludable by keeping it a secret, then the company keeps all the 
benefits itself. It is thus adequately incented to create a better-tasting soda, a 
better tablet computer, a better piece of word-processing software, etc.
But if all knowledge is nonrivalrous in this way, there is nonetheless some 
knowledge that we do not want kept secret. If individuals produce it and 
try to keep it secret, society will suffer. Scientific knowledge is generally of 
this character. The discovery of a new scientific principle may have implica-
tions for increasing productivity in many industries and thereby dramatically 
improving the way we live. But those applications are very far down the road 
and involve commercial skills that the scientist probably does not possess. 
Therefore, the market is not effective in getting those who benefit from 

Chapter 10 | The Things Only Government Can Do
236
the knowledge the scientist creates to pay him for its social value. The fact 
that scientific knowledge generates so many nonrivalrous benefits and that 
those benefits are often created in unpredictable ways many years after the 
discovery is made (and often after being modified by other scientists) is often 
used to argue that governments—that is to say, taxpayers—should fund basic 
scientific research.
Crowding
Note finally, with regard to public goods, that they may not be nonrivalrous 
over all levels of consumption. To listen to a lecture inside a classroom is to 
consume a good that is nonrivalrous up to a point. It doesn’t matter whether 
there are 2 students in the classroom or 50—the lecture is available in identical 
quantity to all of them. But as more and more students enter the classroom, 
crowding starts to set in. All the seats are used up, requiring students first to 
sit on the floor and then to crowd closer and closer together. The discomfort 
makes it harder to assimilate the knowledge from the lecture. Even if the 
lecture is held outdoors, as people get farther and farther away from 
the microphone, the value of the lecture is lower and lower. This crowding—the  
turning of a nonrivalrous good into a gradually more rivalrous one once  
the number of consumers reaches a certain level—means that the good can 
no longer be treated as purely public. Shortly beyond the primary entrance 
to the Grand Canyon on the southern side there is a viewing area, and every-
body standing on it gets the same spectacular view of the canyon below. But 
the more crowded the viewing space gets, the more unpleasant it becomes, 
and if it were crowded enough that a new person could enter only after 
someone else exited, the space would be completely rivalrous.
Many of the infrastructure examples mentioned earlier, especially roads, fall 
into this category. If an interstate highway has sufficiently few cars that no 
one car meaningfully slows down the others, then it is close to a nonrivalrous 
good. Once the road has been constructed, therefore, the primary reason to 
charge for use is merely to keep the road maintained. But once enough cars 
are on the road, each additional one meaningfully slows down every other car 
on the road. (This is of course the situation prevailing on many freeways in 
many cities around the world.) The proper price to charge then must include 
the negative externality of these crowding effects, and if the road were pri-
vately owned, the owner would of course have every incentive to charge 
that price. It used to be true that broadband cable and many web sites with 
unexpectedly large numbers of visitors were subject to crowding, but as tech-
nology improves, this effect is diminishing. As always, the key task is exclud-
ability. And many goods are nonrivalrous at small levels of consumption, but 
become rivalrous at higher levels. If the good is excludable—the ability to 
enter Yosemite National Park, or to use a swimming pool—then controlling 
quantity will be one thing that the owner of the site will want to do.

The Taxonomy of “Market Failure”  
and its Absence
Table 10-1 summarizes the pure categories of goods, with examples in each 
category.

Excludable
Private good
Sandwich, car, PC, fish raised 
on fish farms, plants and 
animals raised on private land

Public goods
National defense, the construction 
(although not necessarily the operation) 
of infrastructure, the creation of basic 
scientific knowledge.
As the chapter has suggested to this point, it is in the second row—the 
nonexcludability row—where potential “market failure” arises.
Conclusion
The reader may have noticed by now that the language in this chapter has 
been rather equivocal. Whether or not any particular potential “market 
failure” justifies government action to address it is, I confess, not an easy ques-
tion to answer. As noted earlier, government has been around since humans 
first began settled cultivation. It was created from the desire of some people 
to be in control of the distribution of the new surplus that was created from 
the productivity advantage cultivation has over hunting and gathering (that is, 
to have power over who eats and who doesn’t) and from the need to enable 
people to work more effectively together (that is, to correct “market failure”). 
If one is trying to resolve this difficult question of when to rely on government 
and when to rely on free people interacting on their own terms to solve social 
problems generated by scarcity, we might start with a general rule of thumb:  
if people can solve this problem better on their own, let them; if not, rely on the state, 
but do not have unrealistic hopes about what it can achieve.
In practical terms, there is one essential task that history suggests only govern-
ment can achieve. None of the virtues of the market process can be achieved 
without it. That task is the establishment and preservation of law and order. 
If people can freely prey on one another, it does not make any sense to talk 

Chapter 10 | The Things Only Government Can Do
238
about “property rights.” Punishing those who steal and commit violence, and 
who deceive in the course of their interactions with other people, is acknowl-
edged by social thinkers of all stripes as an essential task of the state.
The second arena of state action, which is fuzzier, is the correction of “market 
failures.” Without question, individual interaction through the market some-
times leads to worse outcomes than when those actions are limited by the 
state. But the state is not perfect; it uses its immense power to punish its 
enemies and reward its friends, often by taking wealth from the former and 
giving it to the latter. It is often captured by special interests. Its decisions are 
often flawed because of its inability, relative to individuals acting in their own 
interest, to harvest costly decentralized information. But sometimes it is the 
only game in town.
When there are externalities or problems of nonexcludability—in other 
words, when property rights that we wish were there are too costly to 
enforce—the state may make things better, although it may also make things 
worse. A good rule of thumb is that the more important the effect per person, 
and the greater the number of people affected by it, the more likely it is that 
government restriction of individual freedom will do good. Environmental 
pollution, because of the ways it damages human health and because of the 
complete inability of individuals who have no direct contact with one another 
to resolve their conflict over property use, is likely to be a prime candidate 
for government activity. (But only up to a point; if people with extreme views 
on how much pollution, pesticide residues, etc., should be allowed capture 
the regulatory process, much will have to be sacrificed in the course of 
the government producing the regulations it enacts under their influence.) 
National defense is easy to abuse—a people convinced of their military superi-
ority may wish to seize things by war instead of obtaining them peacefully)—
but the fact that almost every country in history has resorted to government 
seizure of resources, including conscription, to defend the country suggests 
that defense has major public-goods aspects.
Over the centuries, more and more human activity has taken place in the 
market, and this is a good thing. Even when governments do things, they don’t 
do them with the same severity and cruelty as was once true. If the government 
had announced it was going to build the Golden Gate Bridge or the Empire 
State Building by conscripting slave labor, people would have properly been 
outraged. But many ancient monuments throughout the world were built this 
way, so it is a sign of progress that the state nowadays gets the resources it 
needs by demanding money (taxes) rather than labor. Over the long course of 
time people have come to understand the dangers of ceding too much power 
to government.
Throughout this chapter when I have used the term “market failure” I have put 
it in quotation marks. That is because this “failure” is defined only relative to an 
ideal in which market prices incorporate all aspects of every action. However, 

Reasonably Simple Economics
239
governments fail too, for reasons covered in Chapter 5. The solutions about 
how to solve any market failure—for example, imposing a tax of just the right 
amount on just the right people, or setting up a trading market for rights to 
pollute the air that will function just like the existing market for wheat—work 
perfectly on the blackboard, but the government we have is not the govern-
ment of the blackboard. (To consider an absurd yet revealing example of the 
difference between what the law ought to be and what lawmakers want it to 
be, one need only consider this example15 of a proposal to tax all men because 
of the social cost imposed by violence against women committed by some— 
perhaps a very small percentage—of them.) Ultimately, the question of whether 
a particular market has the shortcomings defined by the term “market failure” 
can be objectively answered. It must be characterized either by externalities 
or nonexcludability. The question of whether that failure is substantial enough 
to justify government action is not so easy to answer; every citizen has to 
decide for himself.

Macroeconomics
The Big, Often Blurry Picture
I suspect that when many people pick up a book about “economics,” they 
expect to be reading about such things as unemployment, inflation, and eco-
nomic growth. And yet it is not until here, in the final chapters, that I address 
these questions. The reason for that is related to something I hinted at in 
the introduction: an economy is merely a description of the ways in which 
people with different interests in the presence of scarcity reconcile those dif-
ferences. It does not make any sense to describe the functioning of an entire 
economy unless we understand this fact and use it to think about the terms 
under which people relate to one another and about how much they can 
expect to gain at any moment from participating in “the economy.” So-called 
“macroeconomics”—the study of aggregate-level phenomena such as unem-
ployment, inflation, and economic growth, usually at the level of the nation-
state—depends critically on so-called “microeconomics”—the ways in which 
individuals respond to the incentives they face.
Note
■
■
  Macroeconomics (overall economic growth, the rate of inflation, and so on) is utterly 
dependent on microeconomics—the daily decisions we make based on the incentives that either 
motivate us to act, or don’t.
To talk of “the economy” is to make crude generalizations about a vast conglom-
eration of individuals, some of whom at any moment might be doing well, some 
not so well. So it is with all aggregate descriptions of complicated phenomena. 
One may say at any moment that one’s body (or more likely, “health”) is bad, 
because one has a cold. But one’s brain still functions normally, one’s heart still 
vigorously pumps blood, one’s arms and legs still do exactly what is expected of 
11

them. It is only the runny nose, the coughing, and the fatigue that mark depar-
tures from the norm. People might describe “the earth” as “in crisis,” but life 
in all its marvelous complexity still reproduces, and many kinds of pollution, 
including natural pollution such as dangerous diseases, decline. (Remember the 
stories of the conquest of public filth and infectious diseases in the discussion 
of the environmental benefits of economic growth in Chapter 9).
Another reason I resisted speaking of “the economy” as a whole until the 
end is that to speak this way encourages a fallacy of control, a mistaken 
belief in the omniscience and omnipotence of politicians in the face of con-
stant economic change. People who are concerned about their prospects 
or poverty, or the prospects or poverty of their neighbors, will be eager 
to listen to any politician who promises to fix things, and politicians either 
out of deception or delusions of grandeur will be all too happy to oblige 
these wishes. But what if we entertain a terrifying thought? That thought is 
that any set of politicians may be powerless to do anything about the short-
term fluctuations of “the economy.” If the economy is really 310 million 
people (in the case of the U.S.—7 billion if we think globally) interacting in 
the presence of costly, decentralized information, the president—let alone 
any particular senator or representative—may in other words get far too 
much credit when “the economy” is looking up and far too much blame 
when it is, by conventional ways of looking at things, struggling. Economists 
over the years have been very willing to deceive themselves about the 
amount of control they can provide politicians with, especially in the short 
run. (The long run, as we will see, has more possibilities.) If I were to 
put this discussion of “the economy” at the beginning of the book, read-
ers might well wonder, after reading about the difficulty of achieving many 
macroeconomic goals, whether economics has any use at all, when in fact, 
in terms of analyzing the trade-offs of individuals, it is profoundly useful. 
So keep these themes in mind: (1) The economy is a complicated, evolved 
structure, so any modeling of it taken as a whole must be of limited use; 
(2) the power of any political system to influence it over the short run may 
be very constrained. With that in mind, let us proceed to the first task, 
which is to define some terms.
Note
■
■
  Because at any moment people’s opportunities and available resources differ, the idea of 
talking about how “the economy” is doing is unavoidably imprecise. In addition, it may generate an 
unjustified confidence that any problems in “the economy” can be easily fixed.
The Concept of Gross Domestic Product
Gross domestic product (GDP) is the estimated monetary value, measured at 
prices at which things are actually sold, of everything produced and sold within a 
jurisdiction (a country, multinational organization, county, state, and so on) in a given 

 Reasonably Simple Economics
243
period of time. The jurisdiction is usually a country, and the period of time is 
usually a year.1
To build a very simple model of how GDP is calculated, imagine that people 
consume only two goods: food and clothing. Table 11-1 represents the quan-
tity and price of food and clothing consumed (and produced—assume there 
is no foreign trade) in 2010.
Table 11-1. A Simple GDP Model
2010
Quantity
Price
Value = P × Q
Food
10,000
$10
$100,000
Clothing
4,000
$50
$200,000
GDP
$300,000
Here it is worth saying a few words about economic modeling. The model in 
Table 11-1 assumes, as if we live in some dystopian science-fiction future, that 
there is only one kind of food. The market-equilibrium price is $10. Clothing, 
too, is uniform (so to speak), and every year 4,000 units are produced and 
sold at $50 each. Reality is naturally much more complicated. There are many 
kinds of food—high-end, low-end, meat, vegetables, grains, junk food, and so 
on. So too with clothing. And real people consume far more than two goods. 
They buy cell-phone services, paper clips, medical consultation and treatment, 
child-care services, on and on. But to express this more complicated reality 
would simply require adding more rows to the table, generating little marginal 
insight while generating high marginal costs because of extra computational 
complexity. So in this simple but illustrative example, the GDP is the sum of 
the value of all food sold in 2010 ($100,000) plus the value of all clothing sold 
in 2010 ($200,000), or $300,000.
But when one reads about GDP, one usually sees it expressed as real GDP. To 
think about what this means, imagine that for some reason (and we’ll get a 
better feel for what that reason might be later in the chapter), next year the 
amount of food and clothing we consume is unchanged, but the price of each 
has increased, so that the new figures are as shown in Table 11-2.
1 There is also a term called gross national product (GNP) that is defined differently, but for 
many countries, including the U.S., these differences do not matter significantly, and so  
I will speak of GDP rather than GNP from now on. If you read a report the news about 
one or the other in the U.S., you can treat them as essentially the same.

Chapter 11 | Macroeconomics
244
So what we call nominal GDP—current quantities times current prices for 
each good, the latter of which are $12 and $75 respectively—has gone up by 
40% ($120,000/$300,000), and yet we aren’t materially any better off. For this 
reason, economists like to talk in terms of real GDP, which means GDP based 
on this year’s quantities, but some previous base year’s prices. If we use 2010 prices 
and multiply them by 2011 quantities (unchanged from 2010, by assumption), 
we find that real GDP in 2011 is the same as that for 2010: $300,000. The 
economy did not grow at all, in other words.
Let us do one more year (see Table 11-3).
In 2012, clothing prices are stable, food prices are higher again (again, don’t 
worry about why yet), and quantities of both goods are higher. So, nominal 
GDP grew by 12.62% (($473,000 – $420,000) / $420,000) over last year’s 
$420,000, whereas real GDP, using 2011 prices as the base, requires that we 
multiply this year’s quantities times 2011 prices (see Table 11-4).
So, growth in real GDP in 2012 was ($462,000 – $420,000) / $420,000 = 10.5%. 
Why make this distinction? Ultimately, what we are interested in is how much

better (at least materially) people are living, and this is measured in this simple 
model by how well fed and well clothed they are. To get quantity changes, we 
have to net out price changes from growth in nominal GDP. Calculating real 
GDP allows us to measure how much the quantity of each good, weighted by 
its share of the economy, has gone up or down. From this point forward, when 
I speak of changes in GDP it will mean changes in real GDP. As a reminder, the 
actual calculation of GDP (done by the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis) has, 
in effect, a table with very many rows for the very many goods and services 
produced in a modern economy. It is also subject to constant revision as new 
goods and industries are born and old ones fade away.

  GDP is, approximately, the value, as determined by buyers and sellers interacting in the 
market, of what was produced and sold in a particular place in a particular year.
The Broader Significance of GDP
Economists do emphasize GDP growth a lot and often equate it with growth 
in the standard of living, implying that growth in GDP is synonymous with 
improvement in the quality of life. Indeed, I engaged in this exercise myself 
when I showed the figure on growth in GDP around the world and the West 
in particular in Chapter 9. But many criticize this focus on GDP, arguing that 
it neglects things in life that really matter. It is certainly true that GDP is lim-
ited as a measure of quality of life because it can only measure things that 
are explicitly traded in a market. Some services that are provided out of love 
rather than for money—for example, parents leaving their jobs early to watch 
their children play Little League baseball—are important parts of human hap-
piness and achievement, of the life well lived, but do not show up in GDP. In 
addition, precisely because it ordinarily cannot be mediated through the price 
mechanism, environmental damage such as that generated through pollution 
damage is not incorporated into GDP, and indeed remedying it may lower GDP 
growth. On the one hand, companies that make goods that control pollution 
see demand increase after anti-pollution regulations are imposed, but on the 
other hand, installation of pollution-control equipment raises costs for the 
products made in the factories that must install it, lowering GDP. On the other 
hand, reducing pollution lowers health damage, which on the one hand lowers 
demand for health-care services, which lowers GDP, but on the other hand 
allows workers to be more productive, which raises it. By now, we have to 
keep track of so many hands that it is clear that one can’t make any unambigu-
ous statements about the relation between pollution control and GDP. We 
can generally rely on the intuition that pollution is a market failure, and people 
would be willing to pay to get rid of some of it if only property rights to clean 
air and water existed. So, in this dimension, GDP is clearly an incomplete 

Chapter 11 | Macroeconomics
246
measure of human welfare. Other things that GDP does not directly measure, 
such as crime, also reflect this phenomenon. Crime is damaging to human 
happiness, but controlling it adds to measured GDP in the short run, even as 
in the long run it might make it harder for people to cooperate in producing 
things, because they’re afraid to go out, because certain neighborhoods must 
be avoided, and so on.
But I contend that GDP is still a very good measure of quality of life. I will mus-
ter two arguments in this regard. First, global migration (apart from refugees 
fleeing to neighboring countries due to civil war) is overwhelmingly from low-
GDP to high-GDP countries. (Some of my research suggests that this is true 
even when we take account of the fact that high-GDP countries tend to be 
politically freer than low-GDP ones.) This suggests that the material benefits 
available in high-GDP countries are things that people value. Secondly, we can 
spare a few moments’ reflection to think about what it is exactly that GDP 
buys. In the anti-consumerist stereotype that is fairly common nowadays, high 
GDP allows people to buy bigger houses, bigger plasma TVs, a third car, and 
trips to Disney World, but nothing of profound value.
This view I totally reject. It is growth in GDP that has allowed us to buy public 
health (for example, clean water and vaccinations that have vanquished many 
communicable plagues in wealthy countries), safer accommodations (solid 
roofs and floors instead of thatched-leaf and dirt ones, climate-control tech-
nology, and so on), opportunities for personal enrichment and travel, expo-
sure to new ideas, and a host of other things that the critics of focus on 
GDP growth claim to value. (In general, countries with high per-capita GDP 
also have less crime and invest more in pollution control than countries with 
lower per-capita GDP.) So I will take it as given that although production 
of some goods generates negative externalities—so that more production 
of them, other things being equal, makes some people worse off—trying to 
achieve a growing economy is a perfectly valid goal, maybe the primary goal, 
of economic policy.
Note

 Per capita GDP is not a perfect measure of the quality of human life, but it is probably the 
best one we have.
Unemployment
As noted in Chapter 9 in the discussion of Luddite doomsdayism, the unem-
ployment rate in the economy has fluctuated between 3–10% for most of 
the time it has been measured in the U.S. However, it should be noted that 
the definition of unemployment does not exactly correspond to that used by 
most people, which would probably be: want a job, don’t have one. Instead, the 

 Reasonably Simple Economics
247
Bureau of Labor Statistics counts as officially unemployed only those who did 
no work for pay in the last week, but who have actively looked for work in the 
last four weeks. (For some reason, people who have been on layoff within  
the last week but expect to be recalled within the next six months, a situation 
that historically has affected manufacturing workers most, are also counted 
as unemployed.) If one has not looked for work in the last four weeks, one is 
not in what is called the labor force (although the BLS keeps track of such 
people in other categories). And the unemployment rate is simply those who 
are officially unemployed divided by the sum of those who are officially unem-
ployed plus those who did at least some work in the last week, with this sum 
being the labor force. Unemployment, in other words, is given by this formula:
#  
 
 
#  
 
Unemployment rate

As written, the definition looks perfectly sensible, but those who have not 
looked for work in the last four weeks are not counted as being in the labor 
force. Some of these are people who have chosen to stay home and care for 
children, or who are full-time students or retired or otherwise not particu-
larly interested in work at this time; excluding them from the calculations 
is perfectly reasonable. But some are people who have simply given up on 
looking for work because they cannot find jobs they are willing to accept, 
even when they are willing to accept relatively low wages. Most people would 
accept that many of these people qualify as “unemployed” in the common-
sense definition of the term, but they are not so counted. Figure 11-1 shows 
the combined percentage of the population that is in the labor force—that is, 
either working or officially unemployed. It too wanders within a relatively nar-
row range, ranging between approximately 58% and just over 67% between 
1948–2011. Much of the surge in the 1960s was probably due to the larger 
percentage of Americans who were of traditional working age, owing to the 
entry of baby boomers into the workforce, as well as the surge of American 
women into careers. 

Chapter 11 | Macroeconomics
248
Figure 11-1 indicates that this rate peaked in the mid-1990s and has fallen 
more or less steadily since then, including sharply during the so-called Great 
Recession, which started in late 2007. This drop is probably due to some 
combination of an increase in people who have stopped looking for work out 
of frustration, baby-boom retirements (the first baby boomer reached 65 in 
2010), and a rise in claims for disability,2 some of the latter reflecting people 
choosing to receive government checks instead of paychecks. As we will see, 
the economy is prone to natural fluctuations, and the unemployment rate 
with it. But that does not stop unemployment, when it is at the high end of its 
historical range, from being a very potent political issue.
Money
Next we turn to money. We have a natural tendency to think of money pri-
marily in terms of the pieces of paper with images of important national fig-
ures or architectural landmarks on them—currency, in other words. But in fact 
the definition of money is a little trickier than that. First note that money is

simply a way of holding a person’s wealth. Again, wealth is slightly different 
from income, in that wealth is generally a number (usually translated into 
currency units) and income is more likely to be considered as a number per 
period of time. So we say someone’s total wealth is $200,000, while his income 
from his job is $4,000 a month.
How did we come up with this figure of $200,000 for “wealth”? Probably this 
person holds his wealth in several forms. He may own part of the equity in a 
house. (In other words, he has borrowed to buy the house, and only paid part 
of the money back. Were he to sell the house before the loan had been paid 
off, he would be responsible for paying the loan back, and would be able to 
keep the remainder of the cash.) He may have some money invested in the 
stock market, either directly or through a retirement plan at work. He may 
have an account at the local bank that is credited currently with a certain 
amount of “dollars.” Add it all together, along with the value of his miscel-
laneous personal property (cars, entertainment, and information technology, 
and so on), and this will probably constitute what he thinks of as his wealth.
Strictly speaking, wealth is everything that a person owns that could be used 
in trade with others. Although all those things certainly qualify, recall that he 
also owns another form of wealth—another asset, in other words—that we 
have not counted. This asset is his skill, or his human capital (to use a term 
from Chapter 6). If a person has received extensive training in video-game 
design or carpentry, those are certainly valuable assets. If he wants to, the 
person can with some difficulty convert this asset into something he wants to 
consume. He can do this in two ways. The most straightforward way is simply 
to find someone who has use for that training and is willing to pay him for 
its use—a company that sells video games to consumers, or a company that 
builds houses. Alternatively, he could directly exchange his services for some-
thing someone else has that he values. Unfortunately, this process, known 
as bartering, is very cumbersome. It requires that what I have coincide with 
what you want, and vice versa. Unless you, the pediatrician, need your house 
remodeled, and I, the contractor, need my child’s broken arm set, we have no 
opportunity for such barter Having some kind of asset that everybody will 
take in any exchange means we need not have this coincidence of desires. So, 
sometimes money is known as a medium of exchange, which we can define as 
the asset that all sellers will accept in exchange for that which they sell. Note that 
U.S. paper currency says on it that This Note Is Legal Tender for All Debts, Public 
and Private, which is suggestive of this idea of the medium of exchange.
Unfortunately, not all the assets that this person holds are as useful as oth-
ers in market exchange, which is to say they will not be accepted as legal 
tender for all debts. For a person to trade on, for example, his skills requires 
at a minimum going to work and waiting until he is paid in the asset known 
as cash, or perhaps waiting longer (until he finds someone to barter with) if 
he chooses to rely on barter. In addition, in some sense he “owns” part of 

Chapter 11 | Macroeconomics
250
his house, but if he wants to go to the store and buy dinner, he can’t carve a 
couple of bricks off and take that in as payment. Nor will the grocery store 
accept any of his personal property, which in any event he probably gets use 
out of and doesn’t want to give up. The one asset that he does possess that 
any seller of any product will take is his physical currency, with wealth credited 
to a bank account and accessible via an ATM card a close second in terms 
of acceptability (limited only by the ever-smaller number of businesses, for 
example some vendors in farmers’ markets, that do not take debit cards). This 
is how we should think about money—not as a specific asset, for example the 
green pieces of paper with deceased prominent citizens on them, but as all 
kinds of assets that satisfy a certain minimum level of universal acceptance in 
trade with others. This trait—the ability to use an asset to obtain in trade that 
which one wants from others—is called liquidity. Money, then, is simply all the 
assets that have at least a certain minimum level of this liquidity. By any defini-
tion we can come up with, paper currency will certainly qualify, and we should 
probably also always count money stored in accounts accessible by an ATM.
Given that money, however we define it, is the easiest asset to use in exchange, 
why would one ever store one’s wealth in any other kind of asset? For wealth 
such as skill, storage (in one’s brain) is essentially free, and converting this 
wealth into exchange power is relatively hard. Other kinds of assets, for 
example a house, also provide consumption services—namely, you get to live 
there—in addition to being a store of wealth. But some assets—stocks, bonds 
(more on what these are below), real estate where one does not live—do not 
have this quality. Although they are worth something, they are not easy to use 
to obtain other things. But one quality they do have is that they either pay 
out income periodically (if one owns an apartment building, one earns rent 
monthly from the tenants, and if one owns various stocks, one often earns 
dividend payments from the companies that issue the stock), or they have a 
chance of going up in value over time. Money, unless one puts it in a bank, earns 
no returns, and if there is inflation (about which more below), simply holding 
one’s wealth as cash in the house exposes one to this inflation tax. (Holding 
one’s wealth as cash also exposes one to the risk of theft of one’s wealth by 
others, in the form of robbery or burglary. Banks can also fail, although in the 
U.S. bank deposits are partially insured by the federal government.) So there’s 
a trade-off. On the one hand, the types of assets that we call “money” have 
the benefit of being very easy to use in market exchange. On the other hand, 
other kinds of less-liquid assets tend to grow in value and be less exposed to 
some kinds of risk, whereas cash tends to lose value over time and be more 
exposed to these kinds of risk. So most people ordinarily choose to hold 
some fraction of their wealth (often a very small fraction for older people 
with a greater amount of wealth accumulated over their lifetimes, which they 
have invested in less liquid kinds of assets) in very liquid forms, and the rest of 
it in forms that they cannot access immediately but which will grow in value 
over time. Those most liquid forms we will call money.

 Reasonably Simple Economics
251
In the modern era, we have generally thought of paper currency as the most 
widely, indeed near universally accepted, medium of exchange. There are 
some times and places when this is not true, especially when the government 
implicitly breaks the deal by which currency is not promiscuously supplied 
(which causes inflationary problems, to be discussed soon). But currency, or 
something like it, is almost as old as civilization itself; some have suggested 
that the Incas of what is now Peru, a not very advanced civilization even by 
the standards of the time, were the most advanced civilization not to have 
some form of money. Thus, the productivity-enhancing effects of having a 
medium of exchange seem to be substantial. Some ancient settlements in 
what is now China used cowry shells as the medium of exchange, and to this 
day many Chinese characters involving money use the symbol meaning sea-
shell (貝, bei). Other areas of Australia, Africa, and the South Pacific have also 
operated with seashell currency. The items people would use as a medium 
of exchange depends on the confidence that they have that those items will 
retain their value, primarily by not being over-supplied. Some years ago in 
the West African country of Cameroon, beer-bottle caps with prizes on the 
inside were for a time accepted as currency by many,3 which suggests that 
they were more desired than the Cameroonian currency, the CFA franc. One 
supposes that this was because the supply of these caps was relatively pre-
dictable, and owning one gave the right to some other specific kind of wealth. 
Interestingly, even though the caps themselves only entitled the holder to 
one specific prize, the prizes themselves were sufficiently widely useful and 
sufficiently valuable that many, especially taxi drivers, were willing to accept 
them in lieu of cash.
So to repeat, by this way of thinking there is not a definite class of assets 
known as “money,” but money rather is simply the set of assets that are the 
most liquid. The U.S. federal government does have official measurements of 
money. The most widely used and monitored (by the government, for reasons 
of policy discussed below) measure is known as M1, and its primary compo-
nents are paper currency held by the private sector but outside bank vaults 
plus demand deposits. Demand deposits are official terminology for a set of dif-
ferent kinds of bank accounts, dominated by checking accounts. As noted pre-
viously, in any society where the currency is intelligently managed, that paper 
currency will be the most liquid asset, as close to a universally acceptable 
medium of exchange as it is possible to have. Demand deposits are not quite 
that liquid; there are some transactions (often off-the-books ones) where using  
an ATM card or writing a check would be undesirable, and there are even some 
registered businesses that will not take checks or debit cards. But the number 
of the latter has declined with the rise of debit cards, which settle immedi-
ately (although at the cost of a fee charged to the merchant), as opposed to the

Chapter 11 | Macroeconomics
252
old paper checks, which take longer to clear.4 The “clearing” process is sug-
gestive of how banking works. When I use a debit card or write a check at 
your business, my bank electronically deducts the amount of payment from 
my numbered account and transfers it to yours, whether at the same bank 
or not. With a check, the process is the same, but historically paper checks 
had to be transferred from where they were written to the bank where the 
deposit existed, which then transferred the money out of the writer’s account 
and into the receiver’s. A lot of money is purely notional in this way, rather 
than an actual piece of paper with a numerical amount on it.
There are slightly broader federal measures of money as well. M2 includes 
everything that is in M1, as well as savings deposits and what are known as 
time deposits. A time deposit, also known frequently as a certificate of deposit, is 
an account in which you give a bank cash or transfer funds out of your demand 
deposit, and the bank sets up an account and promises to pay you a slightly 
higher interest rate than you would get from a checking or saving account, in 
exchange for your not touching the account for some fixed period of time. 
Obviously, acceding to a requirement that one’s account stay untouched for 
a period of time makes that account less liquid than one from which one 
can withdraw money at will, and so these time accounts properly belong in 
a category of money defined by lower standards of liquidity. (Whether sav-
ings accounts in the modern age of debit cards are less liquid than demand 
deposits is an interesting question, but in any event they are included in M2 
and not M1.)
The final thing to note about money is that, fundamentally, banks create most 
of it. Once this used to be literally true in the case of paper currency; banks 
would issue their own currency notes, which were as good as they were 
acceptable to other people. In Hong Kong, the government issues paper cur-
rency, but so too do three private banks. But nowadays currency issuance is 
monopolized in most countries by the national government. And so banks 
cannot create at will the single most liquid kind of asset. But if I go to my bank 
and borrow $5,000 to start a business, then that bank will create an account 
for me and credit it in the amount of $5,000. By the definition of how M1 is 
calculated, its quantity has just gone up by $5,000. Of course, I immediately 
withdraw that money to spend on my business plan; for the sake of argument, 
say I immediately withdraw all of it. (The fact that the merchants are willing 
to take my debit card suggests that the money contained within the account 
it represents really is a nearly universally excepted medium of exchange.) It 
would seem at first that the money supply has just gone down by $5,000, 
exactly canceling the bank’s loan. But in fact M1 is still ahead $5,000, because 
4Currency by itself that is in circulation in the economy rather than in bank vaults is known 
as M0, but since demand deposits are almost as liquid and their value vastly exceeds that of 
current U.S. currency, the value of this circulating currency by itself is not so interesting.

 Reasonably Simple Economics
253
the businesses where I spend that money will in turn deposit it in their banks. 
So a bank loan actually increases the money supply. Indeed, since any deposits 
into a banking system can be lent against, and the businesses where I spend 
my loan deposit those funds into their banks, those banks will then all lend 
against much of that (minus what they keep as reserves), increasing the money 
supply further. This process goes on until the amounts in question are too 
small to lend out.
The process by which newly created loans ricochet through the banking sys-
tem is known as the money multiplier. On the other hand, when I pay the loan 
back, say in the amount $5,200 (which includes interest), the bank transfers 
money from my account (which has been swelled to at least $5,200 because of 
the success of my business) and into its own coffers, and thus the money sup-
ply has gone down by $5,200. Thus, the quantity of money—in other words, 
the quantity of the most liquid forms of wealth—goes up only when banks are 
making loans at a faster rate than loans are being paid back, and goes down 
when the opposite circumstances prevail.
So if money can be created in this fashion at will, why don’t banks create 
more of it? The reason is that they don’t want to make a loan unless they are 
confident that the loan will be paid back. Furthermore, deposits credited in 
the account of one bank will not be accepted as payment by businesses unless 
people are confident that that the transfer of virtual, liquid wealth from that 
bank’s computers to the computers of the bank of the business owner will 
really increase the business owner’s wealth. If business conditions are gener-
ally bad, and/or banks are failing left and right (as they did, for example, in the 
early years of the Great Depression), banks become unwilling to lend except 
to the safest borrowers. So the creation of loans is limited by the particular 
economic circumstances, whether deriving from an individual’s creditworthi-
ness or the overall state of the economy, that determine whether loans are 
wise or not. Loans have opportunity costs; anything that is lent to you is 
not being used to buy something that in the judgment of the bank might be 
safer—the transferring of electronic deposits to very reliable Swiss banks, the 
purchase of gold, even the buying of U.S. government debt, the creation of 
which is explained in more detail in the next chapter. So, in fact, money can-
not be created at will, because its creation, even though it is a private act of a 
bank, has an opportunity cost. Influencing this opportunity cost, and therefore 
influencing the rate of bank lending, it turns out, is a key task when govern-
ment attempts to manage the economy in general.5
5This explanation of money and how it works is very similar to that in Chapter 14 of Paul 
Heyne, Peter Boettke, and David Prychitko, The Economic Way of Thinking, 12th Edition 
(Upper Saddle River, NJ: Prentice Hall, 2010).

Note

■
  Because money simply means the most liquid ways of holding wealth, the dividing line 
between what is money and what is not is arbitrary. But banks have it within their power to create what 
the government defines as “money” simply by lending money to someone and therefore crediting his 
account with a higher balance.
Inflation
Very closely related to the official notions of “money,” and the rate at which 
these measures of “money” grow, is the idea of inflation. Note first that infla-
tion refers not to high prices, but to prices increasing over some significant 
period of time. The city of Tokyo is one of the world’s most expensive, but 
the rate at which prices have increased in the last 10 years, for example, is not 
particularly high. So, Tokyo is not a high-inflation city, merely a high-cost one.
Note also that our ability to measure or estimate inflation falls short of some 
actual overall theoretical idea of rises in all prices, for the same reason that 
measured GDP is not the same thing as all valuable activity. There is simply no 
way to keep track of the fluctuations in the rate at which the money price of 
every good in the economy changes. In addition, different people can consume 
different combinations of consumer goods. Younger people like smartphones, 
more people in middle and old age than you might think6 like tablet comput-
ers, some people like to eat at restaurants, some people like to eat simply at 
home, and so on. Products also change their features all the time, and their 
prices change accordingly. A 2013 model car is a very different thing from a 
1990 model car, and so simply saying that the 2013 version is more expensive 
does not imply that the price for the same amount of consumption has gone 
up. So these kinds of quality changes must also be accounted for. Measuring 
inflation, in short, is a tricky thing.
Nonetheless, despite this problem of costly, decentralized knowledge, the gov-
ernment does try. The most widely used measure (and one adequate for all 
the analysis that we will do here) is called the Consumer Price Index. Data on 
it are published once a month, and one will often read in news articles report-
ing on this month’s data how much higher (they are almost never lower) prices 
are than a year ago. The CPI is almost always used to make this claim about 
overall “inflation.” How is it calculated? Economists working for the Bureau of 
Labor Statistics select a basket of goods that they decide some hypothetical 
ordinary American is likely to consume frequently. They then survey what the 
prices are for these goods every month and attempt to adjust for changes in 
6http://money.usnews.com/money/blogs/the-best-life/2011/04/25/why-the-
ipad-appeals-to-older-users

255
the quality of the products. Every month, they are published in an index, which 
is measured against some base year, the choice of which is arbitrary (similarly 
to the GDP base year). The year-to-year change in the price of this basket of 
goods is the best measure we have of the “inflation rate.” Figure 11-2 shows 
the CPI from 1870–2011, with the base year (when the index takes a value of 
100) being the average of the period 1982–1984.
Inflation can also be shown as the annual rate of change, as in Figure 11-3 
(which is shown, because of data limitations, for a shorter period of time: 
1960–2011).

So, when the inflation rate is higher in Figure 11-3, the slope of the rate of 
increase of the Consumer Price Index in Figure 11-2 is also higher. Both dia-
grams tell the same story, which is that inflation was highest (that is, consumer 
prices grew at the fastest rate as measured by the CPI) from approximately 
1968–1981. Figure 11-2 suggests that there was no tendency toward inflation 
and even some deflation from 1871 to about 1920, there was modest inflation 
from 1920 until the early 1970s, and then temporarily the rate of inflation 
grew in the late 1970s and early 1980s, before falling back to a level that was 
not as high as during that time but is nonetheless higher than what prevailed 
before 1920. So, in general, to the surprise of few readers, I suspect, a lot of 
things are much more expensive now in money terms than they were several 
decades ago. The analysis of aggregate demand management in Chapter 12
tries to explain these patterns.
No one will be surprised to read that inflation is an economic problem, but 
perhaps the reasons will not be what the reader expects. When asked why 
he should worry about inflation, the typical person might answer, “Because 
everything is getting more expensive.” But in theory, this is no problem at all. If 
all prices adjust immediately and in the same proportion, this kind of inflation 
has no effect on economic activity—on the ability of people to trade pro-
ductively with one another. Why? Because one of the prices that will adjust

automatically is the price of all kinds of human capital and other sources of 
income that people use to buy the goods whose prices are going up. To take 
a simple example, if the prices of all consumption goods went up by 10%, all 
your income came from your salary, and your salary also went up by 10%, 
there would be no problem, apart from the minor inconvenience of having to 
carry around paper currency that was worth 10% less. Even very large price 
increases, say 10,000% a year, would be no problem as long as they were con-
sistent (in other words, the prices of everything, including the price of one’s 
skill and labor, also went up by 10,000%). All this simply requires is that we 
periodically add zeros to the currency. Some countries from time to time 
have in fact removed zeroes from their currency to try to restore faith in and 
stability of the currency, precisely because the inflation they are trying to con-
trol is far from benign. But inflation, in fact, generates all manner of economic 
difficulties, and so it must be that the way I stated the nature of inflation—all 
prices change by the same amount, along with compensation—is mistaken.
In fact, prices do not change in this uniform, mechanistic way, and this is why infla-
tion becomes a problem. The primary problem arising from non-mechanistic 
inflation derives from what prices are supposed to do in a market economy—
give people guidance on the consequences of their decisions and hence induce 
them to make better decisions from the point of view of the entire society. 
The robotic model of automatic adjustment of all prices in uniform propor-
tions that I just described is not what real inflation looks like. For a variety of 
reasons, prices for different goods adjust at different rates. Tenants might sign 
contracts one year at a time, so that apartment rents adjust rather slowly. But 
the cost of acquiring, for example, heating oil may change on a day-to-day or 
even an hour-to-hour basis. In a high-inflation environment, people who own 
buildings may be reluctant to be exposed to this risk of putting apartments 
on the market (their heating costs may rise dramatically, but their rents are 
frozen until the end of the year), and so perhaps apartments will be converted 
to other uses. Someone who is committed to a two-year contract to build a 
factory or skyscraper for a fixed price may find at the end of the contract that 
the money he is being paid back will buy less than he expected it to, because of 
inflation that has occurred in the meantime. Indeed, in general, inflation exacts 
its biggest toll on exchanges carried out over a long period of time. Assets 
that hold their value best in a time of high inflation—land, for example—may 
see a purely artificial and unnecessary increase in demand, which comes at the 
expense of, for example, investing in new entrepreneurial experiments.

  Inflation is a problem precisely because prices—and wages—do not rise in lockstep 
fashion. Rather, prices for different goods and services rise at different rates, meaning some people 
in the economy can get hurt more than others by a run of high inflation, and the usefulness of prices 
as a guide to action declines.

When I was young, I used to listen to AM radio late at night, and it would 
sometimes be possible to pick up signals from stations in different cities. The 
value of that activity depended on how much of what I heard was actual lan-
guage that I could make out and how much of it was just static. If there was 
a lot of static, listening to the station was just about useless. Prices are infor-
mation in a market economy, and inflation decreases what engineers might 
call the “signal-to-noise ratio” that people get from the prices they see. The 
more chaotic the overall inflation situation, the less informative specific prices 
become about which activities are useful and which are not, because prices are 
not changing at uniform rates. The whole ability of the price system to rec-
oncile conflicting uses for scarce resources unravels. In some ways, the effect 
that inflation has on the ability of prices to give guidance to economic actors 
about what they should do is like the pernicious effect of well-documented 
grade inflation7 at U.S. universities on the informational value of a transcript. 
Just as someone reading a transcript now has little idea if someone who got an 
A in 2012 is as capable as someone who got one in 1970, someone who sees 
the price of gasoline going up by 8% when general inflation is 10% may not be 
able to tell whether gasoline is “really” cheaper relative to other goods, which 
is the only way that matters.
The second problem with inflation is that it represents a tax on long-term 
thinking. When there is high inflation, paper currency loses value in market 
exchange almost right before one’s eyes, and so there is no reason to put it 
away in the bank. Instead, one wishes to spend it as soon as one gets one’s 
hands on it. But of course the entire financial system, which partly funds the 
process of entrepreneurial experimentation, is a series of middlemen who 
take money from people with no particularly good uses for it and lend it to 
people with potentially very good uses for it but no money on hand. If people 
become unwilling to save, the whole entrepreneurial process grinds to a halt. 
Indeed, a closely related problem to the unwillingness to save is the unwilling-
ness to lend. If the inflation rate is zero percent, and one lends money for five 
years, even if one is wrong about the inflation rate that prevails over the next 
five years, one won’t be wrong by much. Inflation might be 2%, or it might 
be –1% (in which case it would be deflation). Either way, one can be pretty 
confident what the money one gets repaid in five years will buy. If inflation is 
very high, this is not true. If inflation is 100% this year, it might be 500% next 
year and in 2000% in five years. Or it might be 300% next year and 500% 
in five years. Thus, the opportunity for error is much greater. The fact that 
lending money to entrepreneurs is already a very risky endeavor means that 
people are very unwilling to court the extra risk of high inflation, which would 
devastate the value of the money they are paid back in the future. In short, 
in addition to taxing saving, inflation makes lenders unwilling to lend for any 
period of time.

  Long-term credit markets basically disappear in high-inflation countries because no one 
wants to save and no one wants lend over an extended period, and thus so too does entrepreneurial 
risk taking.
In addition, precisely because inflation may damage the prospects of some 
people (namely, people whose costs may go up faster than their compensa-
tion), people work very hard to try to avoid this punishment. They will in 
other words try to rearrange how they hold their wealth—get out of money, 
get into real estate or gold or other assets that are likely to preserve their 
value. But none of this is free. Some people don’t know, at least initially, how to 
manage their wealth in a high-inflation environment, and so they are penalized 
by foolishly holding large balances of, say, cash. Eventually they find their way to 
offices that more knowledgeable people found out about long ago, the offices 
of financial advisors who, for a perhaps substantial fee, will help people man-
age their assets in a way that protects them against the inflationary tax. But 
all of the time and effort spent defending oneself against this inflation, plus the 
resources paid to the professionals who manage wealth for people unable to 
protect themselves, are a sort of deadweight cost, an unnecessary cost made 
necessary only because of the presence of inflation.
In high-inflation societies, even the act of businesspeople having to constantly 
change prices is another sort of deadweight cost. In some cases of very high 
inflation, known as hyperinflation, food markets have been known to raise the 
prices of the goods they sell several times a day. This is also deadweight cost 
from the point of view of society as a whole, because those workers could 
be spending their time trying to find out more valuable products for their 
customers to buy, trying to figure out how more efficiently to organize the 
shelf space, and so on. Expressed this way, the cost seems rather small, but 
in hyperinflationary societies it is not, and in fact is part of the much larger 
problem of the opportunity costs of managing inflation.
Finally, the fact that inflation playing out in a non-mechanistic way makes many 
people substantially worse off means that people demand the government “do 
something” about the problem. But most of the things that the government 
ends up doing, whether the people directly demand them or not, will make 
things worse.8 Governments impose price controls, for example, forbidding 
sellers from raising prices above some certain percentage every year. This 
simply prevents these sellers from passing on their higher monetary costs to 
their customers, and unavoidably causes them to decrease their willingness

occurred in the early 1980s in the U.S., for example.

to take risks and to supply goods. Groups with more political influence in 
society (be they unionized workers, government workers, retirees, or others) 
will demand that the government act in a discriminatory way protect them 
(and only them) from inflation—for example, by requiring that their contracts 
include automatic adjustments to take account of the average calculated infla-
tion rate. (In post-World War I Germany, as inflation rose, the government 
relied on ration cards to allocate increasingly scarce foodstuffs.)
Citizens without so much political influence, on the other hand, will not get 
these benefits, and so will lose out to those with more political influence in 
the ability to acquire goods and services. And ultimately all of this serves to 
increase the amount of government control over the economy, of the abil-
ity of government to dictate who gets more and who gets less, who gets 
rewarded and who gets punished. Given the pernicious effects of govern-
ment control over the economy outlined in Chapter 5, this cannot be good.  
A striking account of how inflation affected the ability of the economy to func-
tion properly was given by Anna Eisenmenger, a resident of Vienna, as inflation 
began to surge in immediate post-World War I Austria, whose hyperinflation, 
which peaked in 1922 at 1,426%, is not quite as well known is that of postbel-
lum Germany:
In the large banking hall a great deal of business was being done … 
All around me animated discussions were in progress concerning the 
stamping of currency, the issue of new notes, the purchase of foreign 
money and so on. There were always some who knew exactly what 
was now the best thing to do! I went to see the bank official who 
always advised me. “Well, wasn’t I right?” he said. “If you had bought 
Swiss francs when I suggested, you would not now have lost three-
fourths of your fortune”. “Lost!” I exclaimed in horror. “Why, don’t 
you think the krone will recover again?” “Recover!” he said with a 
laugh…
Heightened class-consciousness is daily being instilled into the manual 
workers by the Socialist government, and, in heads bewildered by 
catchwords, leads to an enormously exaggerated estimate of the value 
of manual labor. Only in this way could it come about that the wages 
of manual workers are now far higher than the salaries of intellectual 
workers. Even our otherwise honest old house-porter is demanding 
such extravagant sums for performing little jobs that I prefer to do 
the heavier and more unpleasant household work myself…
I survey my remaining 1,000-kronen notes mistrustfully, lying by 
the side of the pack of unredeemed food cards in the writing table 
drawer. Will they not perhaps share the fate of the food cards if 
the State fails to keep the promise made on the inscription on 
every note? The State still accepts its own money for the scanty 
provisions it offers us. The private tradesman already refuses to sell

his precious wares for money and demands something of real value 
in exchange. The wife of a doctor whom I know recently exchanged 
her beautiful piano for a sack of wheat flour.9
In this extract, we see much of what was discussed earlier. There are the 
arbitrary goods whose value is preserved in the marketplace, that is, some 
prices inflating at higher rates than others. (In addition to the piano men-
tioned, Eisenmenger’s husband’s collection of cigars was also useful in barter, 
but note that it was wheat whose value relative to that of a piano soared.) 
There are people running to politically ambitious people, in the form of social-
ist politicians, for protection. There was Eisenmenger herself, ignorant about 
how to protect herself from inflation and thus vulnerable to its ravages. The 
diary itself does not mention the disappearance of long-term lending, but one 
must suppose based on historical experience that this too occurred.
Austria is far from the only example of hyperinflation in the last hundred 
years. The worst cases during this time are listed in Table 11-5, according to 
Steve Hanke’s and Nicholas H. Krus’s calculation.10

These are of course extreme cases, and the chaos that such inflations intro-
duce is also extreme. But relatively “moderate” inflation has also been far 
from rare in the last hundred years. Many Latin American countries and Israel, 
among others, have suffered inflation in the hundreds of percent per year. 
Even in the U.S., where inflation peaked at just under 14% during the period 
of worst inflation, the period of wringing it out of the economy was associated 
with very low rates of GDP growth.

So inflation is clearly a costly phenomenon. Why does it happen? There are 
two reasons. The first is, according to some, a side effect of policies designed 
to stimulate an economy that is growing too slowly for public tastes, which is 
again a topic for the next chapter. However, the other reason is related to the 
direct, socially toxic incentives of politicians. They seek to benefit from some-
thing called money illusion, the short-term response by people to the creation 
of “money” by banks in response to changed incentives given to them by the 
government, which pumps up economic growth, but only for a brief period.
To see how money illusion works, imagine the following: you wake up one 
morning, go to your ATM to withdraw money, and you find that the amount 
of cash in your checking account has mysteriously doubled. Being an honest 
sort, you immediately report this error to your bank, but they assure you that 
there is no mistake, that everything is as it is supposed to be, so you needn’t 
worry about it. Undoubtedly you treat this as an unexpected gift, and you go 
out and spend some of the money on purchasing goods. However, suppose 
that in fact everyone’s bank account doubled overnight, and everyone goes out 
and spends some of the money in about the same portion you do. The under-
lying productivity of the economy has not changed. The amount of the various 
scarce resources needed to produce things that people value is the same as 
it was yesterday, there has been no technological improvement that allows us 
to produce more with less, and so there is no reason to think that this should 
result in any long-term increase in economic activity. In fact, the money price 
of goods and services is just an artificial unit of measure. Thinking in terms 
of the previous idea in which all prices and earnings increase in the same 
proportion, whether we say that the amount of “money” needed to purchase 
a new car is $10, $10,000, or $10 million, is completely arbitrary, as long as 
one’s income is adjusted accordingly. It is like expressing height in the larger 
quantity of centimeters instead of the smaller quantity of inches; the actual 
height of the person is the same either way. And so the extra money in the 
economy should eventually play out simply as higher money prices of goods, 
which, as we have seen, once we move away from the mechanistic inflation 
model, becomes a serious social problem.
But it may take people a short time to figure out that their increase in money—
which after it plays out is not, note, an increase in wealth—is not just confined 
to them. And so when the government increases the amount of “money” in 
the economy and distributes it through the banking system, whether by print-
ing it or through other means outlined in the next chapter, people may for a 
short time engage in more economic activity because the increased liquidity 
of the economy is confused with increased wealth. Why would the govern-
ment do such a thing? It may be in the government’s short-term interest to 
cause people to think the economy is performing better, because then they 
may return the government to power. This effect is known as the political 
business cycle. It is unclear how important it is, but to the extent that it exists 
it suggests that governments will be prone to manipulating the economy’s 

 Reasonably Simple Economics

liquidity in their own political interest. If one accepts the common definition 
of inflation as “too much money chasing too few goods,” this will result over 
the long term in increasing inflation, which may eventually have to be wrung 
out of the economy at significant cost.
Note
■
■
  The government sometimes adds liquidity to the economy in a way that makes it seem as 
if we are all wealthier, at least in the short term. It is quite possible for this political business cycle to 
result in inflation.
Sometimes the highest levels of inflation result from an even more direct 
incentive—the government must create money simply to pay its bills. When 
governments spend more than they take in in taxes, they are sometimes able 
to simply borrow money, by issuing what are known as bonds. Once upon 
a time, bonds were mostly in the form of paper—you may have seen old-
fashioned savings bonds that are still sometimes given to children by relatives 
when the children are born—and now they are electronic credits. A bond 
is a promise to pay a person who has lent the government money. He has 
done this by buying a bond in a certain amount of money, in exchange for 
which the government pays him interest periodically over a certain period 
of time, before he gets the money he originally spent purchasing the bond 
back. A person may, for example, spend $9,800 on a U.S. government bond, 
which means that the government now has that additional amount of dollars 
available to spend on things it wants to purchase. Depending on the kind of 
bond, you may receive regular interest payments, or you may simply receive a 
higher amount when the bond expires—say, 13 weeks later at $10,000. Either 
way, you are in essence lending money to the government. (Large corpora-
tions also issue bonds.) The bonds issued by the U.S. federal government in 
particular are known as Treasury bonds, after the Department of the Treasury 
that issues them.
For many governments this is a routine matter. But if the cumulative govern-
ment debt becomes too much, people may begin to doubt that the bonds 
issued by this government will be paid back. They will thus stop buying the 
bonds, and the government will become unable to borrow money, in the same 
way a person who had defaulted on numerous loans would be unable to bor-
row money from a bank. Then, if government spending continues to exceed 
taxes, the only way for the government to pay its bills is simply to print new 
money and to give that as payment to those selling it goods. But all of this 
printing money, again for the same reason as above, does not create any addi-
tional productive capacity. Instead, it simply adjusts upwards the monetary 
prices of more or less everything (although not at the same rate, as already 
indicated.

Chapter 11 | Macroeconomics
264
As prices of things get higher, the government must print even more money 
to pay its excess expenditures, and indeed as inflation damages economic 
activity, its tax intake will fall even further, worsening the problem. The coun-
try thus enters into a hyperinflationary spiral, which are the sorts of situa-
tions seen back in Table 11-5. Hyperinflation, in other words, is always and 
everywhere a political phenomenon. It would thus be nice to insulate the 
portions of the government responsible for managing the amount of “money” 
in the economy from daily political pressure, because absent such insulation, 
that pressure tends to lead both to creating “money” every time an election 
comes up and to printing more money to fund more government spending, 
which if it exceeds taxes by enough for long enough, leads to hyperinflation. 
Thus, there is a phenomenon in many advanced countries called independent 
central banking, which we turn to in the next chapter.

Macroeconomics
Stabilizing the Economy, or Not
As noted in the previous chapter, “the economy” is really, in the case of the 
U.S., just a description of the trading relations among our 310 million people 
at any given moment. As one might imagine, when there is a constant tide of 
private-sector economic experimentation, and information about prospects 
and outcomes of those experiments is costly and dispersed, this description 
is unavoidably vague. At any moment, some people may be doing better and 
some not so well, and the economy is constantly in flux. What is more, there 
is some reason to doubt how effectively people in Washington, D.C., can push 
the buttons they have in front of them to make “the economy” better when it 
seems to be going badly on balance at any moment.1 But people understandably 
dislike circumstances in which unemployment is high, and economic growth 
(growth in real per-capita GDP) low. In the modern era, in which it is assumed 
that government is primarily a vehicle to solve social problems (as opposed to, 
say, an organization designed to enable people to solve their own problems by 
setting up and enforcing contract and property rights and addressing market 
failures), when “the economy” is bad, many people, especially those suffering 
the most, will demand that government “do something.” Economists in the 
20th century created a vast apparatus of theoretical tools to tell government 
officials what to do when it is time to “do something.” Because “the economy” 
is so complex, encompassing many different individuals with their own specific 
circumstances, I personally am somewhat skeptical of the ability of these tools 
to achieve their goals. However, many people much smarter than I developed 
these tools and believe in their use. This chapter therefore describes how

much of the modern macroeconomic policy—that designed to stabilize the 
economy in particular—is said to work, and evaluates it.
The Goals of Economic Policy
To understand the goals of what is generally seen as good economic policy 
(as opposed to the goals of any particular politician at any moment, which is 
a different thing entirely), it is helpful to look at a diagram showing growth in 
U.S. real GDP per capita from 1870–2010 (Figure 12-1).

Figure 12-1. Growth in real per-capita U.S. GDP, 1870–2010
Recall first from Chapter 11 that real per-capita (that is, per-person) GDP 
refers to analysis of changes in quantities, while holding prices fixed at some 
base-year standard. In the chart shown in Figure 12-1, the base year is 1990. 
In addition, the thick line represents actual GDP. The thin curve represents 
the best fit of what is known as an exponential function to these data. In other 
words, this is the smooth exponential function that most closely approxi-
mates the actual data on U.S. GDP growth.2 The details of this function are not 
important, but the estimation of it indicates that over this time real per capita 
GDP in the U.S has grown at an average annual rate of 1.97%.
2 If U.S. economic growth were exactly characterized by an exponential function it would 
indicate that the U.S. economy grows at some fixed rate every year, without fluctuations 
around that trend.

267
Reasonably Simple Economics
This means that the material standard of living has doubled about every  
35 years, consistent with the discussion throughout Chapter 9 about things 
constantly getting better. This pattern of growth is the first key thing to notice 
about Figure 12-1. We should not be surprised that, over time, income per 
person tends to grow. There is a constant flow of new entrepreneurs with 
new ideas, people figuring out new ways to meet human needs by using scarce 
resources differently, and the best ideas are the ones that best survive the 
competitive process. New ideas allow us to find useful resources where none 
were known to exist before. The former waste product of oil, the scientific 
plaything that was the laser, and the one-time laboratory curiosity of the semi-
conductor that went on to power the computer are vivid examples. History 
is a constant tide of technological improvement.
In most countries, long-term growth of real per-capita GDP is an important 
objective of government policy. This is as it should be. There are some people 
who object, as noted in Chapter 11, that GDP is not a very good measure of 
quality of life. Accordingly, some people have developed alternative measures 
of what they view as the important components of quality of life—the Human 
Development Index3 or the Genuine Progress Indicator,4 to name two. Indeed, 
a former king of the South Asian country of Bhutan once said that his goal 
was to maximize something he called “gross national happiness.”5 But I would 
argue that maximization of real per-capita GDP growth is in fact what we 
should be aiming for. GDP is not a perfect measure of human welfare, but it is 
an objective index. The prices used to calculate it, to the extent that the cal-
culations are correct, reflect the value people actually attach to various goods 
themselves, as revealed through the market process, as opposed to the value 
an arbitrary but powerful individual might assign to, say, a mandatory minimum 
wage, a piece of land being preserved as wetlands instead of being used for a 
parking lot, or a Beethoven symphony.
Because the market process is a way to reconcile conflicting human desires as 
efficiently as possible, a growing economy reflects the fact that human desires 
as humans themselves define them are being better satisfied than before. Thus, 
the more rapidly an economy grows, the more comprehensively human desires 
are being met, even when particular desires of particular people conflict 
(as they usually do). These other measures, in contrast, depend on the subjec-
tive interpretations of the people who construct them (the King of Bhutan, 
for instance) to determine what is important. When the economy is grow-
ing, people are living together more productively and helping each other to 
achieve their goals more effectively. Hence, economic growth is a worthy goal

But there’s another thing to note about Figure 12-1. Although the general pat-
tern over the long run is a positive one, in the short run there can be significant 
instability. Per-capita income may grow on average at 1.97% per year, but in any 
given year it may grow more than that, less than that, or even fall. Inspection of 
Figure 12-1 suggests that these periods are not rare. The two worst episodes in 
absolute terms were the 1930s (the Great Depression) and the demobilization 
after World War II. It turns out that when looking at the percentage by which 
real GDP per capita—instead of its absolute level—fell, we see that there were 
also serious economic reversals from 1873–1878 and 1893–1895.
These fluctuations are normal. Figure 12-2 shows a slice of U.S. macroeco-
nomic history—namely, growth in real per-capita GDP over a portion of the 
earlier data set, from 1890–1921.
So, even in the short run, there are substantial economic fluctuations, even 
from one year to the next, and GDP itself is merely an average of all growth 
across all goods whose market trade is measured by the government. This 
seemingly constant instability generates a significant problem—not economic, 
but political. When GDP is falling (or even, in an economy with rapid growth 
like China, not growing as fast as it was before), this means that more people 

269

than usual have planned for a future that is not going to happen, at least not 
yet. Companies have, more than usual, staffed their factories and offices in the 
belief that demand for their products will increase by a large amount, but it 
turns out that this does not happen, and demand for what they sell may even 
decrease. Given that businesses cannot hold onto their resources unless they 
can pay them compensation at least as high as their opportunity cost, and 
given that this requires that they make economic profit, this declining demand, 
which may occur in many places simultaneously, requires that costs come 
down. One way this brutal yet inescapable economic arithmetic plays out is 
that workers are let go.
Question 12.1
■
■
  If there is a layoff, and the factory is subject to a collective-bargaining contract, 
according to what rules and procedures might these layoffs be carried out?
And make no mistake about it—an increase in unemployment is a problem 
that the citizenry wants politicians to address. People who lose their own 
jobs naturally want “the economy” to recover so that they may find good jobs 
again. And people who are merely worried about losing their jobs may also 
want the government to “do something.” This is unsurprising. Losing one’s 
job is a major setback. Many people depend on income from employment as 
their primary source of resources to fund their consumption, their retirement 
savings, and so on. If they cease drawing this compensation, their horizons 
diminish considerably. So if we can lower economic instability—make it so 
that hiring is not far above trend sometimes and far below it at other times, 
and losing one’s job is not a constant fear, and we can do this without sacrific-
ing economic growth (in other words, without sacrificing the ability of people 
to reconcile their conflicting needs, and ensuring that our children live better 
than we do, as we live better than our parents did)—this would seem to be 
a worthy goal. (If stabilizing the economy comes at the expense of slower 
growth on average, the trade-off is not so clear.)

  In the long run, a well-managed economy will grow because of new ideas. In the short run, 
anything can happen because of unpredictable change that is often brought about by such ideas. If 
the short-run changes are bad ones for more people than usual, this becomes a political problem.
Precisely in the belief that this is the case, that government can and should 
stabilize the economy, for much of the 20th century the government in most 
advanced nations, including the United States, has under the guidance of many 
smart economists engaged in such stabilization policies, which are often known as  
aggregate demand management. (I will use this term and economic stabilization.) 

Chapter 12 | Macroeconomics

Its goal is to iron out economic fluctuations—to prevent severe downturns, 
which put people out of work in large numbers, from happening and to pre-
vent excessive booms too, on the assumption that it is their unsustainability 
that leads to severe economic contractions in the first place.
The “Business Cycle”
The term aggregate demand management is revealing. It suggests that there 
is something called aggregate demand. To this point, we have thought about 
demand as something that occurs in individual markets—there is a demand 
for shoes, for accounting services, for paperclips. And this demand depends on 
the quantity and quality of available substitutes. But aggregate demand means 
we’re aggregating everything—it refers to the general demand for all goods. 
Already, this seems a little peculiar, because goods do not really have a single 
price. Rather, each good has a price, and we buy some goods and decline to 
buy others partly based on those different prices. It is true that when one 
spends money on goods, one is not saving, so that one can think about the 
interest rate foregone on savings not made as the “price” of consumption, but 
consumption itself has many possibilities. Nonetheless, built into models of 
aggregate demand management is the assumption that “the economy” goes 
bad because consumers are not demanding enough goods overall, and can in 
fact grow too fast (for reasons outlined later in this chapter) because con-
sumers are demanding too many. Before getting into this in more detail, a few 
other terms about the overall trend of the economy must be defined.
When real GDP (not even real GDP per capita, note) is growing, this is known 
as an expansion. Expansion can be brisk—in the U.S., any growth rate of real 
GDP of about 4% probably qualifies—or it can be slow—anything between 
0–2% is generally what people mean by slow growth. (Note that in other 
countries where recent economic growth has been much faster, such as 
China, even 4% would be disappointing.) When real GDP contracts for two 
consecutive quarters as measured by a private group, the National Bureau of 
Economic Research (NBER), the official term for this is recession. When real 
GDP contracts either by a large amount or for extended period of time, this 
is generally referred to as a depression, although not even the NBER has an 
official definition for where a recession stops and a depression begins.
Perhaps because economists are reluctant to admit that the toolkit they 
developed to manage the economy (described in upcoming sections) cannot 
prevent depressions, they have basically been unwilling to use the word since 
the Great Depression of the 1930s. But in my view, the period 2007–2012 
(which includes, in addition to an officially certified recession, a recovery very 
weak by postwar standards) certainly qualified. In addition, fluctuations of the 
economy—its pattern of growing fast, growing slowly, and shrinking—also 
make up what is known as the business cycle. This is in truth an unhelpful term, 

271
Reasonably Simple Economics
because it suggests a regularity to the economy—it grows for four years, 
then declines for one, then grows for another four—that doesn’t really exist. 
Economic growth is not like a sine wave, with an identical pattern of fluctua-
tions around some basic growth rate. Rather, precisely because innovations, 
discovery of information, and entrepreneurial experimentation are mostly 
random, the economy could very easily grow for an extended period of time, 
have a brief recessionary interruption, grow for two years, and then have 
a severe recession. The economy, in other words, rises on average, but its 
short-term fluctuations are best thought of as random.
When the economy goes into recession, or certainly into depression, many 
businesses find that the information they had about future demand for their 
product was unjustifiably optimistic. Overall, the sellers of goods and services 
estimated that demand for what they produce would grow more than it in 
fact did. As noted earlier, it is urgent for them, if they want to stay in business, 
to cut costs. Cutting labor is an easy way to do that very quickly, especially if 
demand for that type of labor is relatively elastic, that is, if there is no over-
whelming incentive to preserve a particular employee or kind of employee 
through bad times. In contrast, when the economy begins to recover or is in 
a sustained expansion, employers find that their expectations were too pessi-
mistic (as do people who had thought about starting their own businesses but 
were worried about the risk in a bad economy), and so they begin to expand 
production or open new businesses. Thus, in the early stages of recession or 
depression unemployment goes up, just as it goes down in the early stages of 
an expansion. High unemployment as the economy adjusts more than usual 
often generates a great amount of political pressure to end the recession 
or depression. As already noted, even if economic fluctuations are partly or 
substantially random, this does not in and of itself mean that economic stabi-
lization is a mistake, as long as the stabilization is effective and doesn’t cost us 
growth in the long run. The government, in its attempts to stabilize, has two 
tools in its toolkit: monetary policy and fiscal policy.
Note

  Stabilization or aggregate demand management is about the short term only. Is it a good 
idea? That depends on its effectiveness and long-term cost.
Economic Stabilization—Monetary Policy
Monetary policy refers to attempts by the government to influence the rate of 
“money” creation by private banks. Its goal as an aggregate-demand-manage-
ment or economic-stabilization tool is to keep the economy going on an even 
keel. In explaining monetary policy this way, remember that the dividing line 
among different kinds of wealth assets between “money” and non-“money” is 
arbitrary. But clearly among the most liquid assets are those that are known as  

Chapter 12 | Macroeconomics
272
demand deposits. The government can influence the rate at which banks are 
willing to make loans and thus influence the total value of demand depos-
its that exist at any time. The organization responsible for doing that is a  
government entity known as the  Federal Reserve System, which is the U.S. central 
bank. Most countries have such a bank, and its primary tasks are to over-
see the health of the banking system, to regulate banks, and to oversee the 
implementation of monetary policy. The system in the U.S., based on similar 
entities that already existed in several European countries, was born in the 
Federal Reserve Act of 1913. The modern Federal Reserve has evolved sig-
nificantly since this act was passed. As currently structured, it is overseen 
by a Board of Governors, consisting of seven members, including one chair 
and one vice-chair. There are also 12 regional banks housed in various cities 
around the country. The regional banks do not have any direct control over 
monetary policy and will not be further considered. Each private bank in the 
country may choose whether or not to participate in the lending system that 
the Federal Reserve controls, which requires that they be subject to its rules. 
Most U.S. banks choose to do so.
But the Board of Governors is where monetary policy decisions are made. 
It must be noted that the structure of the Federal Reserve is different from 
that of much of the rest of the federal government. Typically, when we think 
of “federal agencies,” what we are really thinking of are organizations partly 
or entirely under the direction of the executive branch. And those organiza-
tions come with a significant degree of political accountability. The secretary 
of agriculture, for example, must be named by the president and approved 
by the Senate, but the president may remove him at any time, and Cabinet 
secretaries can even be impeached and removed from office by Congress, 
although only one secretary has been so impeached in American history, and 
he was impeached after he had announced his resignation but before it had 
taken effect. (He was never tried.) It is taken for granted in the American 
system that the secretary of agriculture is an ordinary political officer. If the 
presidency changes hands, the secretary of agriculture may and probably will 
leave with the departing president, in particular if a new party takes over the 
White House. The terms of Cabinet secretaries, thus, seldom exceed those 
of the presidents who appointed them.
Federal Reserve governors are also appointed by the president and confirmed 
by the Senate and may also be impeached and removed, but the other ele-
ments of political accountability are not there. First, the president cannot 
simply dismiss a governor of the Federal Reserve Board the way he can a 
Cabinet secretary who no longer has his confidence. Second, five of the seven 
governors are appointed to serve 14-year terms, an extremely long term for 
any officer in the American constitutional system. (Only federal judges, with 
lifetime terms, serve longer.) Third, the other two members (the chair and 
vice-chair) serve four-year terms, but they are purposely set up to straddle 
presidential terms—each officer is appointed in the middle of one presidential 

273
Reasonably Simple Economics
term, and his term expires in the middle of the next. The Federal Reserve 
system has thus been built in a way that means that its members reach office 
in the same way that executive-branch officers do, but once they are in, they 
are supposed to be immune from the short-term political pressures we actu-
ally want the president and his secretary of agriculture to be subject to. This 
is because it is believed that making the central bank subject to these kinds 
of pressures will yield worse results because of the temptation to subordi-
nate monetary-policy decision making to short-term electoral considerations, 
especially the temptation to take advantage of money illusion as described 
in Chapter 11. Monetary policy, in other words, is unlike other kinds of gov-
ernment decision making in that it should not be exposed to the vagaries of 
public opinion.
So what is it that the Federal Reserve Board of Governors does to merit this 
exemption? Recall from Chapter 11 that banks can create money by making 
loans. The Fed has a lot to do with how willing they are to do this. It may or 
may not make you uncomfortable (it shouldn’t), but banks routinely in a sense 
run out of money. They would prefer not to keep deposits on hand, because 
they must pay interest on them. Instead, they want to lend that money out, 
so that they can earn interest. In the language of accounting, deposits are 
liabilities, loans are assets. The bank of course wishes to keep some “money” 
on hand—deposits that haven’t been lent out—to be able to meet the daily 
desires of depositors to withdraw cash. Indeed, the Federal Reserve has a 
minimum reserve requirement—a rule that each member bank must keep a 
certain percentage of money on deposit, both as cash in the vault and with the 
Fed itself. The Fed can lower this requirement—say, from 5% to 4%—and then 
banks may lend at a faster rate. If the reserve requirement is raised, lending 
similarly slows down. However, because of the “money multiplier” mentioned 
in Chapter 11, one dollar in new lending by one bank creates other lend-
ing down the road—the reserve requirement is a relatively clumsy tool.  If the 
reserve requirement is lowered from 6% to 5%, it means that for every dollar of 
every loan made, 95 cents instead of 94 cents is available for creating new lending, 
and that continues to be true as each loan moves through the banking system 
and creates more loans. It is thus powerful, but can easily result in a vast increase 
or decrease in lending. For this reason this tool is relatively seldom used.
The Fed also has direct control over two interest rates, which are known as 
the Fed funds rate and the discount rate. The former rate involves the rate the 
Federal Reserve requires be charged when member banks borrow from other 
member banks from funds the latter have on deposit at the Fed (hence the 
name Fed funds). These are short-term loans, often overnight, and are made 
because banks have liquidity constraints—that is, they fear they won’t have, 
or may indeed not have, enough “money” on hand to fulfill their day-to-day 
obligations. These loans are perfectly normal. The other rate is the discount 
rate, the rate at which member banks borrow directly from the Fed itself.  
If the Fed raises either of these rates (and the Fed funds rate is the most 

Chapter 12 | Macroeconomics
274
often-used tool), banks become more reluctant lenders because the cost of 
having to borrow from another bank’s Fed funds or from the Fed itself will 
be higher. Lending will go down. If the rates are lowered, lending will similarly 
go up as banks know that the consequences of having to engage in this short-
term borrowing are lower. In addition, raising these two rates will cause banks 
to raise the rates they charge on their other loans, whereas lowering them 
also causes banks to pass on their lower costs to customers in the form of 
lower rates on home and business loans.
The final tool is known as open-market operations. To understand it, one 
needs to know first that the Department of Treasury of the United States  
(an ordinary political agency, distinct from the quasi-independent Fed by vir-
tue of being a normal Cabinet department subject to the usual Congressional  
and Presidential controls) routinely borrows money on behalf of the government  
of the U.S. (because this government runs a deficit). The financial assets 
through which it borrows money are the Treasury bonds mentioned in 
Chapter 11. These bonds are freely bought and sold just like Microsoft stock 
or the futures contracts mentioned in Chapter 4. Many of those buying and 
selling these bonds are speculators working for financial trading firms, but 
some of them work for central banks and other government agencies around 
the world, who like to hold Treasury bonds because they are seen as very 
likely, compared to the bonds issued by governments of other countries or by 
private companies, to be paid back.
Question 12.2
■
■
  When people speculate on bonds, what are they speculating about, and what 
information do they generate for the rest of us?
The U.S. Federal Reserve is also a major buyer and seller of Treasury bonds. It 
buys and sells them as an instrument of monetary policy. The process can be 
illustrated through the simple model contained in Figures 12-3 and 12-4.

The two boxes represent two separate worlds—the economy, where all of us 
live, engage in exchange, take risks and pursue our interests, and the coffers 
of the Fed, which hold large amounts of both cash (electronic) and bonds. 
Figure 12-3 depicts expansionary open-market operations, which are designed 
to increase economic activity by injecting “money” into the economy. In these 
operations, the Fed buys bonds from the public. Cash that it had held enters the 
economy, and bonds leave the economy to be held by the Fed until the direc-
tion of open-market operations turns. This means that bonds—a less-liquid 
asset—have been removed from the economy and replaced by a more-liquid 
asset. (Bonds are very liquid compared to, say, real estate, but there are many 
obligations they cannot be directly used to settle.) This means that, at least in 
the short term, people will be more likely to spend, because their wealth is 
now held in proportions that make spending easier. This is why the situation 
in Figure 12-3 is called expansionary open-market operations—because it is 
believed that the Federal Reserve swapping cash for bonds will cause spending 
and lending to increase and the economy thus to expand. It is worth noting 
that in response to the unusually severe economic downturn beginning in 
2007, the Fed began years of unprecedented levels of bond buying. Whether 
it was effective in reviving the economy is a very open question.
In Figure 12-4, the direction is reversed. A more liquid asset, cash, is spent 
by the public to buy a less-liquid asset, bonds, from the Fed, because the Fed 
has decided to sell some of the bonds it holds. The overall liquidity of the 
nation’s wealth goes down, and so do lending and spending. In other words, 
this policy contracts economic activity, so Figure 12-4 depicts contractionary 
open-market operations.
Interest rates can also be adjusted in an expansionary way, with the goal of 
increasing economic activity, or a contractionary way, decreasing economic 
activity. When the Fed lowers the rates it controls, this lowers the cost for 
banks to lend aggressively, thus banks lend more. This should result in more 
people taking out loans to buy homes and cars, and more people borrow-
ing to expand or set up businesses. When interest rates are raised, eco-
nomic activity should similarly slow down. Although (as noted) it is a fairly 
clumsy tool, reserve requirements also have an expansionary and contrac-
tionary side. To lower the reserve requirement is to give banks the ability to 
lend a greater fraction of every dollar they take in in deposits, and to raise 
reserve requirements is to require them to set aside a greater fraction of 
every dollar. Lowering the requirement is thus expansionary, and raising it is 
contractionary.
So when the economy is entering, threatening to enter, or stuck in a con-
traction (recession or depression), the Fed will lower interest rates and buy 
bonds from the public. Occasionally, it will lower the reserve requirement. 
When the economy is growing too fast, it raises rates, sells bonds to the public, 

Chapter 12 | Macroeconomics
276
and occasionally raises the reserve requirement. This is essentially how monetary 
policy works.
But a new question then arises. In Chapters 9 and 11, I argued that economic 
growth is a powerful force for bettering the human condition. Why would the 
Fed be worried about growth that is too fast? The reason is that there is a 
common belief among macroeconomists that growth in excess of the econo-
my’s underlying capacity will cause inflation, which we know from Chapter 11
is a bad result. The argument works through what is called the wage-price spi-
ral. Suppose that the economy is going great guns, and businesses become so 
optimistic that they begin over-hiring. What does over-hiring mean? It means 
that, running short of labor, they hire workers to satisfy short-term demand 
even though the workers aren’t any more productive, and they drive unem-
ployment down below what is known as the natural rate—the rate of unem-
ployment consistent with the normal flow of people leaving their jobs because 
of family reasons, because they have found something better, because they are 
fired for misconduct, and so on.
This natural rate of people transitioning between jobs, called frictional unem-
ployment, is thought to be different from people losing jobs because the overall 
“economy” is bad. Even a rapidly growing economy ought to have some of 
this frictional unemployment, so that the efficient rate of unemployment is 
never zero. But when demand for labor becomes very high in very good times, 
wages begin to be bid up by employers desperate for workers despite the lack 
of higher productivity. When workers are paid more because they are more 
productive, higher wages need not translate as higher consumer prices. But 
if the labor market becomes cramped, workers may be hired in short-term 
desperation despite no advances in productivity. Now, higher wages do have 
to be passed on as higher prices for the goods the workers are making. But 
the workers, having the upper hand in the labor market because of artificially 
low unemployment (the opposite of Marx’s argument of the “reserve army of 
labor,”6 which is part of the overall Marxist doomsday argument outlined in 
Chapter 9), can simply demand, and get, higher wages to make up for higher 
prices of consumer goods, themselves caused by their original demands for 
higher wages, which are passed on to consumers. This means that prices go 
up yet again, and suddenly the inflationary spiral is on.
To prevent this, the Fed will begin to engage in contractionary policy not 
just at the first sight of incipient inflation, by which time many macroecono-
mists believe it is too late to prevent the spiral from kicking in, but merely 
at the onset of growth that is thought to be unsustainable. What is this level 
of growth? It surely is difficult to say. A former chairman of the Fed, Alan 
6http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reserve_army_of_labour

277
Reasonably Simple Economics
Greenspan, took a lot of criticism for his belief that the popularization of the 
Internet in the 1990s (which, he believed, raised productivity dramatically) 
meant that the sustainable growth rate of the economy was higher than in the 
past. While there was no outburst of high inflation during the period, the lack 
of sufficiently contractionary monetary policy, in the view of some, led not to 
unsustainable wage inflation but a bubble in the stock market, which popped 
ferociously after April 2000. The argument was that increased liquidity in the 
economy had to be invested somewhere, and one of the places it was invested 
was in the stock market, driving up stock prices unsustainably. (This interpre-
tation, like much in macroeconomics, is disputed by some.)
But in any event, the fear is that an economy that grows in excess of its 
underlying capacity, which may lead to unemployment lower than its natural 
amount, will cause inflation. And so like all central banks, the Fed must walk 
a tightrope—on the one hand, keeping policy sufficiently contractionary to 
prevent inflation from developing, and on the other hand keeping policy suf-
ficiently expansionary so as not to push the economy into recession. If infla-
tion arises because monetary policy is unwisely loosened, then later on it will 
have to be dramatically tightened. In the 1970s, when oil prices surged on two 
occasions because of turmoil in the Middle East, it was reasonable to expect 
that this would cause a major economic slowdown—people had planned that 
oil would be much cheaper than it turned out to be. But in an effort to pre-
vent that slowdown from happening, the Fed engaged in aggressive expansion-
ary monetary policy. This did not solve the underlying problem of the need 
to adjust to a new world, a world in which oil was now much scarcer. So this 
meant those adjustments took place anyway, but with a lot more “money” 
sloshing around in the economy than before. The result was both recession 
and inflation, which necessitated a major episode of contractionary monetary  
policy after 1979 to wring money out of the economy by increasing interest  
rates (thus slowing down bank lending) and engaging in contractionary 
open-market operations, in order to bring inflation down. This result was 
achieved, but only at the cost of inciting what might once have been called a 
depression.
When a recession happens (assuming it is not intentionally brought about by 
the need to wring out inflation caused by excessive expansionary monetary 
policy), it is pretty obvious what should be done—expansionary monetary  
policy should occur to get the economy moving again. But when to raise  
interest rates to prevent inflation from taking hold because of the wage-price 
spiral is much harder to figure out. Some economists even believe that the 
wage-price spiral is nothing to worry about. If the labor market becomes exces-
sively tight, we would expect business owners to figure out ways to substitute  
away from workers and towards other kinds of resources. When grocery 
workers become expensive in a tight labor market, self-checkout machines 
are introduced, causing demand for grocery clerks to go down. When drive-
through clerks are hard to get, their jobs are outsourced to people taking 

Chapter 12 | Macroeconomics
278
orders hundreds or even thousands of miles away7 over the Internet. Thus, 
in this view, higher wages unjustified by higher productivity should frequently 
induce a substitution of machines for workers (or cheaper workers, perhaps 
overseas, for more expensive ones), nipping the spiral in the bud. Although 
below-“natural” unemployment can indeed cause wages to go up once, per-
haps even in excess of productivity, in this view the problem is temporary and 
self-solving.
The last thing to note with regard to monetary policy is that it is relied on 
much more than in the past. In the time before the creation of the Federal 
Reserve, the government had no instruments by which to conduct any sort 
of monetary policy, and recall that at that time, banks often issued their own 
currency notes. But monetary policy has in the postwar period been a, if not 
the, primary tool of economic stabilization. This has coincided with a gen-
eral increase in the average rate of inflation, as documented in Figure 11-2. 
According to the data there, the CPI went up and down until almost exactly 
1913, the year of the creation of the Fed. Since then, the index has gone up 
continuously, and hence the buying power of U.S. currency has declined con-
tinuously. As we saw in Chapters 9 and 11, standards of living in general and 
real GDP in particular have soared during this period, so it must be that com-
pensation is going up faster. But if the problems of inflation noted in Chapter 
11 hold at lower levels of inflation as well as under hyperinflation (and that is 
not clear), the era of modern central banking has brought us more stability 
(GDP fluctuations are probably lower than in the pre-Fed era), but has also 
increased these inflationary costs over the long term.
Economic Stabilization—Fiscal Policy
The toolbox for stabilizing the economy contains one other element besides 
monetary policy: fiscal policy, best defined as the use of the government’s taxing 
and spending powers for stabilization purposes. Note that here “government” 
does not mean some quasi-independent organization like the Federal Reserve, 
but instead the ordinary executive and legislative branches of government, and 
the process by which they make tax policy and spend money.
The Coming of John Maynard Keynes
Fiscal policy as a stabilization tool is not as old as monetary policy. It made its 
appearance in a big way after World War II, but its genesis lies in the Great

Depression. This event was easily the worst in U.S. economic history. It is an 
instructive experience if you ever meet people with personal memories of the 
Depression to talk with them, although obviously there are fewer and fewer of 
them now.8 It was a horrendous experience. Unemployment peaked at almost 
25 percent, there was an explosion of soup kitchens and homeless encamp-
ments, the banking system almost fell apart between 1929 and 1932, and many 
Americans bewildered by the catastrophe flirted with fascism, socialism, and 
communism. Because the country itself was not nearly as wealthy as now, the 
Depression’s impact on ordinary people’s ability to survive day to day was 
dramatic, and the era produced some of our most compelling art describing 
these effects—the books of John Steinbeck and the photographs of Dorothea 
Lange, among others.
As an epidemic of bank failures tore through the nation because of a series 
of bank runs by panicky depositors, monetary policy became less and less 
relevant, and in any event, monetary policy was not well understood and was 
used poorly. Many economists of the time also had only one answer beyond 
monetary policy, and that was to do nothing. According to standard economic 
theory, if unemployment had skyrocketed, the thing to do was to wait for 
wages to come down until equilibrium had been restored in the labor market, 
just as the standard supply-demand model for labor suggests. And yet the 
Depression did not end. Part of this was due to the aggressive intervention 
of President Hoover, who used persuasion and the law to try to keep wages 
up and prevent jobs from being eliminated—two things the standard theory 
would suggest was something that had to happen for the economy to resume 
its normal growth path. History has painted Hoover as someone who believed 
in doing nothing and letting the market correct itself, but more recent his-
tory calls that depiction very seriously into question. He aggressively leaned 
on chief executive officers and union leaders to avoid layoffs and intervened 
dramatically in international markets by signing a massive increase in taxes on 
imported goods known as the Smoot-Hawley tariff. So the perception of him 
as some ideologue who wanted to wait for the Great Depression to fix itself 
is far from the mark.
The depth and length of the Depression cost Herbert Hoover his job, and it 
also prompted economists to think about why the economy continued not 
to get better. The smartest was an Englishman named John Maynard Keynes 
(rhymes with “gains”). He had become famous in the early 1920s by correctly

predicting that the Treaty of Versailles that ended World War I would impose 
impossible obligations on the defeated Germans, and indeed the Germans 
hyperinflated their way out of that debt (that is, printed so much currency 
that the value of the money they were using to pay back debts deteriorated 
to essentially nothing). But his most influential work was The General Theory of 
Employment, Interest and Money, which was published in 1936, nearly at the end 
of Franklin Roosevelt’s mostly unsuccessful first term.
Keynes’ diagnosis of the Depression was revolutionary. In his judgment, it was 
not like an ordinary economic breakdown. During such events, monetary pol-
icy could work just as the theory predicted it should. The Fed would engage 
in expansionary monetary policy, and under the greater liquidity and lower 
interest rates businesses would be more willing to take risks. (Consumer bor-
rowing was a smaller phenomenon then than it is now, so monetary policy 
was thought mostly to influence business and not the consumer.) But after 
the Depression had been bad enough for long enough, people lost hope that 
the future would ever be better. They became permanently unwilling to spend 
money, and this made business correspondingly unwilling to build new plants 
or otherwise increase production, and so they also refused to hire workers. 
In other words, consumers weren’t willing to spend because they had no job 
or feared losing the one they had, and businesses refused to hire because 
consumers weren’t willing to spend. Under circumstances like this, simply 
lowering interest rates did no good, because there was no rate low enough  
to induce businesses to borrow money to expand.
When Interest Rates Hit Rock-Bottom—The Need 
for Fiscal Policy
Recall that interest rates reflect the rate at which wealth today trades for 
wealth in the future. People who are very optimistic about their future might 
be willing to pay high interest rates, people who are pessimistic will not. 
(Note that this is an argument about the demand for loans. Most of the 
examples in the earlier discussion of interest rates focused on things affecting  
the supply of loans.) So now Keynes’s argument becomes a little clearer.  
After the Depression had gone on a few years, people began to adopt an atti-
tude of permanent pessimism. There was no longer any reason for businesses 
to engage in any expansion or risk taking, because things were bad and likely 
to stay that way. Interest rates cannot go below zero, because anyone can 
earn zero interest just by taking cash and putting it in his mattress. So if I as a 
businessman am offered a chance to borrow $20,000 at a rate barely above 
zero, I am still unwilling to do it. No investment opportunity that I have will 
earn enough money to allow me to pay the loan back, and there is a signifi-
cant chance that I will default because the economy is so bad. Interest rates 
therefore become completely impotent as an expansionary tool. The Fed can 

281
Reasonably Simple Economics
lower interest rates almost to zero (as it essentially did), but the economy will 
stay depressed.
But Keynes’s great genius was to think about very low interest rates in a dif-
ferent way. As we just saw, very low rates indicate that there are not a lot of 
people standing in line to borrow money. People are so pessimistic that very 
few projects are seen as worth the risk. But this means that if the govern-
ment charges in and borrows huge amounts of money, the social opportunity 
cost—investment projects that don’t occur because the money is lent to the 
government instead—is minimal, close to zero in fact. This is thus the ideal 
time for the government to come in and borrow that money and use it to 
put people to work. Doing this will cause large numbers of people to start 
earning regular paychecks again. They will then spend this money on goods, 
which will give business the confidence it needs to begin investing in expan-
sion again. Massive public spending of borrowed money, in other words, is a 
way to jump-start the economy. Those people could be hired to build valuable 
public infrastructure—roads, bridges, schools, hospitals, and so on—at sub-
stantially lower opportunity cost than if those projects were undertaken at a 
time of economic boom. However, Keynes went so far as to suggest that the 
goal was not to build infrastructure per se, but to end the economy’s coordina-
tion failure—the fact that employers would hire if only they knew that there 
would be demand for their goods by the time their projects were finished, but 
workers would signal a willingness to buy products only if they knew that they 
would have jobs. Indeed Keynes famously said that it would be sufficient to 
hire people to do nothing more than bury cash in abandoned coal mines and 
then dig it up again. The main issue was not to invest in productive activities 
per se—if the results of public spending were productive, that would just be a 
bonus—but to break the iron grip of pessimism.
And so Keynes built an impressive intellectual foundation under an idea that 
had already existed, that the government should build public-works projects 
when times are really bad. In the past, this had been done sometimes merely 
to cultivate political support—to keep people from taking out their rage on 
the current politicians—as much as to revive the economy. But Keynes pro-
vided a powerful theoretical justification for doing this, and for doing it on 
a large scale. As noted, President Hoover had himself, contrary to conven-
tional wisdom, engaged in very activist attempts to right the ship after the 
October 1929 stock market crash, urging businesses to keep wages up and 
engaging in numerous infrastructure projects. Once he took office in 1933, 
Franklin Delano Roosevelt did much the same, hiring people to manage the 
national parks, create art, build major electric-power projects in the Tennessee 
Valley and in rural America more generally, construct such urban projects as 
LaGuardia Airport, and to do many other tasks.
But of course the Depression lasted until close to the end of the 1930s, and 
many take that as evidence that the Keynes approach failed. Others contend, 

Chapter 12 | Macroeconomics
282
however, that the New Deal projects were too few and too small-scale to do 
what Keynes said needed to be done. Note that the same argument occurred 
over the gigantic economic-stimulus legislation passed in 2009, after the great 
financial-market crash of 2008. The fact that the economy failed to grow  
vigorously after this legislation passed is taken by many as an indictment of 
the whole Keynes approach, while others argue, just like before, that the main 
flaw was that the stimulus package was too small. This reminds us that mac-
roeconomics, or at least the macroeconomics of economic stabilization, is 
considerably less well established than microeconomics.
Lost in Translation—How the Economics of 
Keynes Became Keynesian Economics
Keynes died in 1946, which means he did not live to see the movement of 
economic stabilization to the top of economists’ (and politicians’) priorities. 
Because the Depression was such a catastrophic event, attention naturally 
turned after the war to making sure that such a thing never happened again. 
Some people began to conceive of using fiscal policy not as a cure for an 
economy that had already fallen apart, but as prevention to keep a slowing 
economy, or an economy that had already entered into a recession, from fall-
ing into full-on depression. Once the economy began to slow, people could 
be hired by the government with borrowed money to do the same sorts of 
things that were done in the 1930s, and their paychecks would be spent at 
stores and elsewhere, and so businesses would see their incomes go up, and 
the recession would either never happen or quickly end. And to prevent over-
heating, when the economy was growing too fast, fiscal policy should be used 
just like monetary policy to slow it down. In other words, when a recession 
is imminent or has begun, the government should engage in expansionary fiscal 
policy—increasing spending (or cutting taxes) to put money in people’s pockets to 
restore economic growth to its normal level. When the economy is growing faster 
than its underlying capacity, threatening inflation through the wage-price spiral, 
the government should engage in contractionary fiscal policy—cutting spending 
or increasing taxes. This aggressive use of fiscal policy came to be known as 
Keynesian economics, which in its aggressive, preemptive use of fiscal policy was 
a step beyond the crisis rationale that Keynes himself had offered.
The Depression had firmly cemented in the American mind the idea that 
it was the responsibility of government to fix “the economy” when it was 
broken, and so Keynesian economics fit comfortably with this belief. The 
rise of Keynesian economic theory after the war, which built mathematical 
models showing that government spending could promote stability, led to 
governments hiring large numbers of economists to build complicated mac-
roeconomic models to predict where the economy was headed. By the early 
1970s, when Republican President Richard Nixon told the country, “I am now 

283
Reasonably Simple Economics
a Keynesian in economics,” this approach was nearly universally accepted as 
a means to prevent excessive economic volatility. The transformation of fis-
cal policy (and monetary policy too, for that matter) from cure to prevention 
supposed that every ordinary recession was just like (or could easily become 
like) the catastrophe of the 1930s.
Problem 1—Crowding Out
But in fact, the argument that garden-variety recessions were not the same 
thing as the Great Depression led to the first of three criticisms of Keynesian 
economics, the idea of crowding out. Remember that during the Depression, 
nominal interest rates fell to almost zero. The discussion of interest rates 
earlier in this chapter indicates that this meant the social opportunity cost 
of massive government borrowing was also nearly zero. But in an ordinary 
recession, businesses are still making long-term plans, and because of that, real 
interest rates, although lower than during an expansion, are still significantly 
above zero. In this environment, government borrowing to spend on public 
works is no longer a nearly free activity. Every dollar that the government 
borrows is bid away from some private-sector actor, an entrepreneur or a 
business who would’ve used it to take risks. Any workers hired to do the gov-
ernment projects built with borrowed money who were previously working 
creating something else for society, also have to count as crowding out. And 
there is no reason to think that public-sector employment comes primarily 
from workers who were unemployed before the project began. Indeed, to the 
extent that federal and state government work is carried out through union-
ized contractors, the workers who get those jobs may well be those who 
were highest on the union’s priority list—who were precisely those who were 
most likely to be working before.
Of course, if the value of what the government spends the money on exceeds 
the value of what the private-sector actor would’ve spent it on, the borrowing 
can still be justified. However, the entire analysis of Chapter 5 indicates there are 
reasons to doubt this. If there is extensive waste or corruption in government 
spending, there will be a net social loss from having government spending crowd 
out private spending. If the government spends most of the money reward-
ing not the unemployed but the politically well-connected by building, in the 
colorful expression of the economist Gordon Tullock, “tunnels to nowhere,” 
Keynesian fiscal policy during a recession has made us worse off.
Problem 2—Fiscal Policy Mechanics
The second problem is the actual mechanics of fiscal policy, as opposed to  
the mechanics of fiscal policy as described in a textbook or on a chalkboard. 
The U.S. Constitution is designed to make lawmaking difficult, and budget  

Chapter 12 | Macroeconomics
284
legislation is no different. (There are many years when the U.S. government 
fails, despite being legally obliged to, to officially pass a unified budget, instead 
opting for piecemeal agency-by-agency and department-by-department bud-
gets.) Even if the orthodox process is followed, three quarters of a year may 
lapse between the time fiscal stimulus (that is, laws carrying out expansionary 
fiscal policy) is proposed and the time it is adopted. The time when the money 
actually arrives in the hands of those who were supposed to spend it is farther 
still in the future. This clumsiness is depicted in Table 12-1, which shows the 
official beginning and ending dates of postwar recessions as certified by the 
National Bureau of Economic Research (not including the great financial crash 
of 2008), along with the dates when fiscal stimulus was enacted.

In fairness, it must be said that the NBER only announces that recessions 
have begun and ended several months after the event or more, because the 
necessary data have to be compiled. Of course, looked at another way, this 
delay suggests that it is difficult to use fiscal policy in a timely way to address 
economic downturns. And late fiscal policy is worse than no fiscal policy at all, 
because once the recovery has begun, the opportunity cost of public borrow-
ing in terms of private risk taking forgone is even higher than it was during the 
ordinary recession, that is, crowding out is worse. And this inefficiency of tim-
ing must be added on to the previously mentioned inefficiency of corruption 
and regulatory capture in determining how the money is spent.
Problem 3—Rational Expectations
The third cost involves people learning not to be surprised by fiscal policy, 
whose very effectiveness depends on surprise. This criticism, that people learn 
from the past when they try to predict the future, is known as the rational 

285
Reasonably Simple Economics
expectations problem. In the first recession after the creation of Keynesian fis-
cal policy, it may be that unemployed workers are put to work building roads, 
or Congress passes a big tax cut to put money in people’s pockets, which 
they immediately spend. However, what is supposed to happen is that after 
the economy recovers, spending is supposed to be cut and/or taxes are sup-
posed to be raised to retire the recently issued debt. People will learn about 
this pattern, and will start saving their tax cuts instead of spending them. Or, if 
they are businesses depending on the spending of the newly hired construc-
tion workers, they will quickly learn that this too was a flash in the pan, and 
so they should just put most of that money aside. Over time, in other words, 
fiscal policy will lose its effectiveness.
So does Keynesian fiscal policy work? The trouble with macroeconomic 
research is that it is possible to come up with statistical models with results 
that can confirm the belief that it does or that it doesn’t; there was in fact a 
vigorous debate among very accomplished economists in the 1970s over this 
very question. (If one wishes to read more recent popular commentary from 
an advocate of Keynesian fiscal policy, Paul Krugman is one of its most con-
sistent and vigorous advocates; he blogs here9 and has also written books on 
this topic. For criticism, see this essay by Robert Higgs on the topic of “vulgar 
Keynesianism.”10) It is a mistake, I think, to suppose that the question can ever 
be conclusively answered. It seems to be true that before the great crash of 
2008, the postwar period had been marked by greater economic stability than 
before the war. Until this crash, the kinds of booms followed by severe down-
turns that took place in 1873, 1893, 1907, shortly after World War I, and in 
1929 were not found after the war. That is an argument in favor of Keynesian 
macroeconomic management. But clearly very aggressive fiscal policy in the 
immediate aftermath of the 2008 crash, not just in the U.S. but in a number of 
countries around the world, conspicuously failed to get advanced economies, 
including that of the U.S., moving again. Then again, radical budget-cutting in 
the name of improving a country’s fiscal situation (so-called “austerity), which 
is supposed to restore investor confidence, has also been argued by the finan-
cial writer Martin Wolf to be of little value.11 Taken in total this suggests that 
macroeconomists may know little about the very things we want them to 
know the most about.
Keynes himself may have been right in his supposition that the macroecon-
omy can take care of itself until such time as it enters a severe depression, 
although even that is arguable in light of the recovery from the often very 
severe depressions before Keynes, when the only response was to do nothing.

But the post-2008 experience suggests that stimulus is not sufficient to end 
major downturns. Higgs argues12 in a research paper presented for scholars of 
political economy that the politicized decision making of the Depression years 
actually increased investor uncertainty about what policies would come next 
and therefore decreased their willingness to invest. As we have seen, such 
politicization is an unavoidable part of Keynesian expansionary fiscal policy. 
But here the interested reader is best advised to go out and explore the 
issues himself.
Answers to In-Text Questions
12.1. The layoffs must occur according to the procedures spec-
ified in the contract. The contract will have been negoti-
ated by representatives of the existing workers and will 
probably be designed to minimize management flexibility, 
if history is any guide. Layoff protection will thus tend to 
reward seniority and not past productivity. Indeed, col-
lective bargaining can have the perverse effect of senior 
workers who will be the last to be laid off to support 
layoffs in lieu of reducing everyone’s hours when demand 
for a firm’s products declines. The article is older, but that 
unionized businesses tend to be more prone to laying  
workers off has been demonstrated in James L. Medoff, 
“Layoffs and Alternatives Under Trade Unions in U.S. 
Manufacturing,” American Economic Review 69 (3) (June 1979):  
380–395.
12.2. They are speculating that the rate of return, adjusted for 
such risks as the risk of nonrepayment, are higher for 
the bonds in question than for other investment options 
like other bonds, stocks, or directly investing in some 
local startup. Thus, when there is a crisis in, say, Cyprus, 
that may prompt investors to be eager to invest in bonds 
issued by the much stabler government of Germany. The 
government of Cyprus, in contrast, will, in order to per-
suade people to buy its bonds, have to agree to pay higher 
interest rates than before. When bond speculators drive 
the interest rate on bonds up or down, they are revealing 
what they think they know about how risky those invest-
ments are relative to the alternatives.

Economics Out There
12.1.	 In an interview posted at the web site of The Washington 
Post,13 the writer Michael Grunwald says that the fact that 
the economic stimulus of 2009–10 seems to have left us 
with nothing as clearly useful as the Golden Gate Bridge 
or La Guardia Airport (products of government spend-
ing in the 1930s) is not a problem, because the stimulus 
benefits “[are] often invisible. Even the stuff where you 
actually build big things—the world’s largest wind farm, 
a half dozen of the world’s largest solar farms—you’ll 
still use your X-Box the same way. The energy is just 
coming from somewhere different.” He also notes that 
the fact that the highest amount of job creation in years, 
which occurred after the stimulus passed but also after 
the worst episode of job destruction since the Great 
Depression, indicates that “[e]verything people think they 
know about the stimulus is wrong” (that is, that it worked 
much better than people thought).
Are the benefits of a more efficient energy system more 
“invisible” than the benefits of the X-Box? If so, what are 
those benefits? Is the fact that jobs fell sharply, the stim-
ulus passed, then jobs grew really sharply an indication 
that the stimulus worked? What would a relatively slow 
rate of job creation in subsequent years indicate about 
its efficacy, and the reasons for it (or lack thereof)? Under 
what circumstances would you expect public perception 
of the benefits of economic stimulus to be at variance 
with the reality?
12.2.	 If you search the Internet for “Did the stimulus work?” 
you get a wide variety of pages with a wide variety of 
answers. One of the more cautious (although somewhat 
technical) attempts to answer this question is from Dylan 
Matthews here.14 Surveying some research, he argues that 
the evidence is mixed but on balance positive.

theory of gravity “works”? How could we be confident 
about the claim (made in this book, among other places) 
that a low price ceiling on gasoline prices will often cause 
people to have to wait in line a long time to get it? What 
criteria should we use to decide whether the stimulus

Macroeconomics
The Short and the Long Runs
Chapter 12 was devoted to the study of how government manages short-
term economic fluctuations. This policy is not difficult to justify, at least on the 
surface. Economic downturns cause some people, often seemingly randomly 
and unfairly, to bear the costs of losing jobs. Sometimes downturns pass with 
little pain, sometimes (the 1930s, the years after 2007) they endure. Assuming 
the flow of technological innovation doesn’t come to a permanent halt, which 
it never has before in human history (and especially since 1780), the economy 
will eventually right itself. But how long must we wait? Keynes himself famously 
dismissed the preoccupation with the tendency of the economy to eventually 
recover with a famous quote:
But this long run is a misleading guide to current affairs. In the long run 
we are all dead. Economists set themselves too easy, too useless a task if 
in tempestuous seasons they can only tell us that when the storm is long 
past the ocean is flat again.1
Although Keynes was actually talking about economic problems after World 
War I, especially hyperinflation in Europe, the remark is often tied to his belief 
that when the economy is not growing—and in fact is in severe depression—it 
doesn’t do any good to talk about its ultimate self-restorative powers. Instead, 
something must be done now. This is unquestionably short-term thinking, but 
is it wrong?

What Are We Aggregating?
First, remember that the government is like a low-magnification satellite trying 
to observe street-level details on a planet below. It is also an entity that has a 
very hard time making decisions. It is possible, therefore, that overly aggressive 
management—some call it micromanagement—of the economy does more 
harm than good, even discounting the effect (which we should not) of corrup-
tion on its decision making. But even apart from this, the core of the concept 
beloved by Keynes, and by his Keynesian followers after the war, deserves 
more scrutiny. That concept is aggregate demand, which Keynes felt declines 
during a depression and is then in need of revival by monetary and especially 
fiscal policy. When large numbers of people lack jobs, both those people and 
others become scared and stop spending their carefully hoarded savings on 
anything. Fiscal policy restores their confidence, and with it economic growth. 
Typically, Keynesians who want to model economic downturns refer to the 
concept of aggregate demand as completely chained to aggregate supply, which 
refers to the willingness of producers to supply more of some generic amount 
of everything as the price of this generic production changes. The standard 
supply-demand model of Chapters 2 and 3 is altered so that the supply of, for 
example, sofas becomes the aggregate supply of all goods and services, and the 
demand for sofas becomes the aggregate demand for everything. Figure 13-1 
shows how this new model looks.
This way of thinking about the economy has a certain surface explanatory 
power. When the stock market crashes, as it did in 1929 for example, peo-
ple feel less wealthy. (Those who own assets such as stocks that decline in 
price are less wealthy.) Their demand for a wide variety of goods goes down, 
although demand for others—for example, low-cost substitutes for consumer

goods or tomato seeds instead of fresh tomatoes—probably increases. In the 
Keynesian framework, it is simply demand for everything (aggregate demand) 
that has declined, and so the aggregate demand curve shifts left and the quan-
tity of everything produced goes down, as does the overall price level (as 
measured, for example, by the consumer price index).
This seems to be a pretty good account of what happened during the Great 
Depression. People did start consuming a lot less, driven by the collapse in the 
values of their stocks, the massive wave of bank failures, and a terrifying defla-
tion that took place during the first three or four years of the Depression. 
Fixing the economy is thus a simple matter of doing something to pump up 
aggregate demand, and massive government spending will, by shifting the 
aggregate demand curve to the right, seemingly do the trick. Thus the aggre-
gate supply/aggregate demand model allows us to depict the idea of economic 
stimulus as a rightward shift in the aggregate demand curve—increased gov-
ernment demand for goods increases total social demand, because of the lack 
of crowding out during depression times owing to massive amounts of idle 
resources. The inability of the market (or really, of participants in all markets) 
to achieve this result without government prodding, because of the coordina-
tion failure between businesses and consumers, means that action is needed 
to revive the economy now—otherwise, the long-run growth we take for 
granted can’t resume. This is Keynes’s argument.
However, economics is all about making choices, and markets in particular are 
about making choices based on the price system among a near-infinite variety 
of different activities. Here is Robert Higgs, mentioned in Chapter 12, on the 
risks we take in engaging in this potential fallacy of composition, the treatment 
of “the economy” like a single market within it:
This way of compressing diverse, wide transactions into single 
variables has the effect of suppressing recognition of the complex 
relationships and differences within each of the aggregates. Thus, 
in this framework, the effect of adding $1 million of investment 
spending for teddy-bear inventories is the same as the effect of 
adding one million dollars of investment spending for digging a 
new copper mine. Likewise, the effect of adding a million dollars of 
consumption spending for movie tickets is the same as the effect of 
adding $1 million of consumption spending for gasoline. Likewise, 
the effect of adding $1 million of government spending for children’s 
inoculations against polio is the same as the effect of adding $1 
million of government spending for 7.62 mm ammunition. It does 
not take much thought to conceive of ways in which the suppression 
of the differences within each of the aggregates might cause our 
thinking about the economy to go seriously awry.
In fact, “the economy” does not produce an undifferentiated mass 
we call “output.” Instead, the millions of producers who bring forth 

Chapter 13 | Macroeconomics
292
“aggregate supply” provide an almost infinite variety of specific 
goods and services that differ in countless ways. Moreover, an 
immense amount of what goes on in a market economy consists of 
dealings among producers who supply no “final” goods and services 
at all, but instead supply raw materials, components, intermediate 
products, and services to one another. Because these producers are 
connected in an intricate pattern of relations, which must assume 
certain proportions if the entire arrangement is to work effectively, 
critical consequences turn on what in particular gets produced, 
when, where, and how.
These extraordinarily complex micro-relationships are what we are 
really referring to when we speak of “the economy.” It is definitely not 
a single, simple process for producing a uniform, aggregate glop.2
So, if expansionary fiscal policy is targeted precisely at activities that need 
to shrink—because new alternatives for those activities have been found, or 
because the resources needed to carry out those activities now have bet-
ter alternate uses, or are only in such high demand because their owners 
have unusual political power—throwing money at them will actually make the 
economy less able to use resources to meet people’s conflicting needs in the 
most effective way. Higgs’s analysis seems to suggest that we can think of fiscal 
policy as applied indiscriminately across a wide variety of activities, but there 
is some reason to think that it will be targeted not just at those with the best 
connections to the politicians dispensing the money (although that is a prob-
lem too) but to those activities that are in the most trouble—those activities, 
in other words, that the competitive process has most revealed to be in need 
of paring back. If Keynes is wrong about why depressions happen, aggregate 
demand management thus postpones the necessary reckoning.

In the Long Run, the Short-Run Bill Comes Due
In addition, Keynesian thinking is short-term thinking, as even Keynes himself 
would agree, but it faces a long-term constraint: the total sum of govern-
ment spending from now until infinity cannot exceed the total amount the

Orthodoxy,” The Independent Review 14 (3) (2010): 466–467.

­government takes in in revenue from now until infinity. The government can 
borrow money today, keep borrowing it tomorrow, and maybe even the day 
after that, but eventually that which has been borrowed has to be paid back, so 
that eventually we must pay out more than we spend for some period of time 
if we borrow today. (Unless we default, which will make it harder to borrow 
in the future.) Any individual managing his own finances knows this instinc-
tively. And the analysis of Keynesian fiscal policy presented in Chapter 12  
indicated that the original idea was that governments would run deficits when 
the economy was struggling, and it would run surpluses when it was doing 
very well—especially if it was in danger of overheating. So is that what actu-
ally has happened? Figure 13-2 suggests not. It shows the federal government’s 
budget deficit (the annual amount by which federal spending exceeds taxes 
taken in) or surplus (the opposite circumstances) from 1930–2011. The chart 
is expressed as surplus or deficit as a percentage of GDP, with surpluses being 
greater than zero. This, rather than the absolute dollar amount of the surplus 
or deficit, is the best way to think about it.

and Budget)

Note first that there are several parts of the chart that deserve more expla-
nation. The rapid rise in the budget deficit in the early 1930s (which means 
that net federal spending goes farther below the horizontal axis) was partly 
due to aggressive increases in federal spending to try to promote employ-
ment, but also to the collapse in tax revenues resulting from the Depression. 
The huge increase in the deficit during the World War II years was obviously 
to pay for the war; a huge amount of so-called war bonds were issued for 
precisely this purpose. And the elimination of the budget deficit for a short 
period in the late 1990s was significantly due to a booming stock market 
owing to the introduction of the Internet and other dramatic high-technol-
ogy productivity improvements, which dramatically increased tax revenue. 
(This is a reminder of how important economic growth is in making things 
possible, in this case even government things.) But these anomalous periods 
aside, the chart suggests that the federal deficit on average has relentlessly 
increased as a percentage of GDP in the postwar period. The surpluses that 
are supposed to be run during good economic times never seem to arrive, 
while the average size of the deficit when times are bad seems to get relent-
lessly larger. The United States is not alone in this regard; many European 
countries and Japan have also seen the “normal” budget deficit expand in the 
postwar decades.
This may be because political incentives are heavily tilted toward the short 
term. Politicians serve a few terms, and then move on. Even a career politician 
will only be around 20 or 30 years. If the consequence of running a deficit 
now is that the politician who votes for the spending gets reelected, while 
the consequences in terms of debt obligation to future generations are some 
future politician’s problem, the urge to vote to spend more is irresistible. But 
of course, if debt levels relative to the overall productive capacity of a society 
get large enough, people begin to doubt whether the economy whose govern-
ment has issued that debt will generate enough economic growth in order to 
produce the taxes to pay it back. At this point, all the choices become bad. 
On the one hand, government spending must be cut significantly and/or taxes 
must go up significantly. To the extent the Keynesian model is correct, this 
will lead to significant economic difficulty. Alternatively, those who hold the 
debt of this government may decide to get rid of it, which will make it difficult 
to issue new debt at anything other than astronomical interest rates in the 
future. (Recall the discussion on interest rates. If lenders increase their belief 
that repeat borrowers won’t pay money back, lenders start charging borrow-
ers higher interest rates to compensate them for that higher perceived risk.) 
Or, the government that represents the people of the society may simply 
decide to repudiate the debt so as to avoid the hardest choices. It may do this 
by simply not paying interest that is due (perhaps negotiating with bondhold-
ers for partial repayment, but perhaps not), or by inflating the currency so 
badly that in real terms the bond payments are worth little.

  Running fiscal deficits is politically easy. Running the surpluses needed to pay them back 
is politically hard.
People often do not realize it, but government debt is not certain in the same 
way that day following night is. Any government bond is only as safe as the 
willingness of future taxpayers in the society that has issued the bond to make 
the payments on it. The same argument applies to promised government pay-
ments for retirement. If future taxpayers are unwilling to shoulder these bur-
dens, the debt becomes worthless. As I write this in 2013, several countries 
in Europe—Greece, Cyprus, and Spain especially—are going through precisely 
these horrible choices. If political incentives are short term enough, an eco-
nomic policy focused on the short term may lead to a steadily deteriorating 
government financial profile. As noted earlier, this is a different kind of tragedy 
of the commons—everybody over-consumes government services now for 
short-term (that is, stabilization) benefit, because they won’t be around to pay 
the bills.
Is Stabilization, in the End, the Primary 
Economic Objective?
For much of global economic history, economic instability was largely a nonis-
sue. This was because the change that generates instability was slow and rare. 
It is change at whatever speed that generates both growth and contraction. 
The creation of a new technology, most obviously, presents new but uncertain 
opportunities, but it also brings with it a need to replace some existing ways 
of doing things. Because of decentralized, costly information, both the oppor-
tunities and what precisely they make obsolete take time to discover, and 
people may make mistakes in the course of applying the new breakthroughs. 
In ancient times, new technologies were rare, although new resources could 
be brought into use through discovery (new deposits of lead, say, which human 
ingenuity turns into a mine) or even through conquest. In Roman times, for 
example, there was constant pressure to obtain new resources, especially 
gold, other metals, and slaves, through conquest to preserve the standard of 
living of those already living in Roman territory. This ultimately contributed 
to struggles for power over the treasures that came with it, and thus to the 
breakdown of Roman law.
Rome was certainly not the only society to become great and then become 
ruthless in this way. In feudal times, after the Roman empire had fallen, the 
social structure kept everyone—from the king to the lowliest serf—in his 
place, and the nature of production was mostly agricultural and unchanging. 
Economic instability of the sort that we take for granted now was scarcely 

Chapter 13 | Macroeconomics
296
conceivable. There were few “booms” and “busts” unless there was a freak-
ish event like the Black Death. It was only the creation of the modern tidal 
wave of innovation, which accompanied the stabilization of property rights 
and the industrialization it helped create, that ushered in the modern concept 
of expansions and depressions, of rising expectations, and of unemployment—
layoffs in declining industries, for example. And even in the industrial era, the 
belief in the relevance of public policy toward economic stabilization—the 
idea that there was an “economy” that could and should be stabilized—did 
not exist until the early 20th century. It was just assumed that industries rose 
and industries fell, and it was the job of people to leave where the opportunity 
now wasn’t and go to where it now was.
But now technological change (and the spread of the modern economic sys-
tem to places full of potential innovators like China and India) is ubiquitous 
and not going away. The clamor for easing the pain when the costs, in terms 
of unemployment from liquidation, seemed at a particular moment to out-
pace the beneficial effect of new innovations led to the modern theory and 
practice of stabilization. But a good argument can be made that stabilization 
is not really the most compelling economic problem, that by focusing only on 
the short term we are missing what is important. The French political and 
economic thinker Claude Frédéric Bastiat (1801–1850) told a story that came 
to be known as the broken-windows fallacy. Thinking ahead of his time about 
the weakness of economic stimulus and the mistake of focusing on short-term 
growth in GDP (although the concept of GDP would not itself be created 
until the mid-20th century), he argued if current additions to national income 
(that is, short-term GDP growth) are the only things to think about in terms 
of economic policy, then breaking a window actually makes society better off, 
by increasing the window repairman’s income, and then the income of the 
stores where he spends his newly acquired money, and the income of the 
stores where those store owners spend their money, and so on down the line. 
But then, why stop there? Breaking all the windows will increase all repair-
men’s income, and hence GDP goes up that much more. And in a sense this 
claim might be right. This year’s GDP might well go up, but over the long term 
the need to replace the windows draws resources away from activities that 
are more lucrative and exposes people unnecessarily, whether in the buildings 
in which they live or those in which they work, to disease and the weather. 
Breaking windows might increase income right now, but destroys some of the 
ability to use resources to produce wealth. (People in colder buildings are less 
productive.)
The key reason the fallacy fails to hold is the difference between income and 
wealth. As noted in Chapter 6, wealth includes all assets of value. At the 
national or global level, it includes things like oil in the ground, machinery, 
land, improvements to the land, and, most importantly, human capital—the 
accumulated human knowledge about how to combine the other resources 
better. The more wealth an individual—or any group of individuals,  including 

Reasonably Simple Economics
297
a nation or the entire human race—has, the more things he or it can do, 
the greater the gains to trade, and the more human problems can be solved. 
Income, in contrast, is gains earned over some period of time as the result of 
bringing more existing wealth to the market—turning useless oil into valuable 
gasoline, a bad farmer selling his land to a better one, the invention of a new 
smartphone app. The creation of income—which is usually, recall, money paid 
to individuals in exchange for using the resources they control (especially 
their human capital) to help someone else create new wealth—will add more 
wealth to the extent it is not immediately consumed.
To use an example popular with economists, if we eat this year’s seed corn, it 
is not available to create more corn next year. But if we avoid eating it, we have 
more corn to plan for next year, leading to even more corn then. But in the 
Bastiat example, there is the paradoxical problem of a destruction of wealth—
the windows, whose elimination makes the buildings containing them less pro-
ductive. It might well increase income earned right now, especially those of 
repairmen, for a few weeks, but the destructive effects of diverting resources 
to repair destroyed wealth instead of using that wealth to produce more new 
things soon outweighs that. (And recall that this assumes no political waste 
in how public stimulus money is spent.) As obvious as this seems, similar mis-
taken arguments exist today. Some economists, for example, argued that the 
horrible Japanese earthquake and tsunami of 2011, which killed thousands and 
wiped out many buildings in coastal areas near Sendai, could serve to stimulate 
an economy that had been growing slowly since the early 1990s. Apart from 
the sheer emotional horror of the event, it is clear that the Japanese people 
were worse off because of the awful destruction of so much human capital 
and infrastructure. Even if it could be guaranteed that no humans would be 
injured, the idea that Japan would prosper with an 8.9 earthquake every year 
is obviously preposterous.
To be sure, this reasoning, and the broken-windows fallacy, do not per se indict 
short-term economic stabilization, because the former two involve active 
destruction of wealth, and stabilization policy does not intrinsically do so. 
However, by diverting resources toward politically directed ends, such policies 
may lower future wealth creation. And either way, stabilization shares with 
these two examples the emphasis on short-term changes in economic activity 
as the primary economic problem. In fact, income earned in any given time 
period (in a year, say, which is the common measuring period for growth in 
real per-capita GDP) is a function of how much wealth exists to be deployed 
to produce that income. To the extent that short-term stabilization detracts 
from the long-term creation of wealth, either by using resources inefficiently 
or by consuming politicians’ attention so that the production of such wealth 
is neglected, it damages a society’s long-term growth prospects.
But does it? If aggregate-demand management (another term for stabiliza-
tion policy, recall) targets economic stability as the main goal of government

visiting India. He may have said it, but the history of this story suggests that

policy, rather than the need to encourage the creation of new technologies, 
it may actually increase the frictions that prevent adjustment. If the president 
calls union leaders and big-business CEOs into the Oval Office and urges 
that wages be propped up instead of being allowed to fall, in order to prevent 
an economic downturn from becoming worse, or if government regulations 
prevent prices from falling because it thinks “destructive competition” dur-
ing a depression are the problem and not merely the messenger (both of 
which happened after the 1929 stock market crash), it is because he views the 
economy as a single entity, as a machine that when broken can be repaired 
by pushing the right button, and not the infinitely complex reconciling of the 
conflicting goals of hundreds of millions of people.
Inevitably, stabilization privileges some activities (by allowing them to earn or 
charge more than if prices were able to adjust freely, or by giving them access 
to taxpayer money) and therefore penalizes others by causing them to lose 
access to resources. Given the costly-information problem, there is reason 
to wonder whether viewing the economy as a lumpy “aggregate” does more 
harm than good. The short-term focus of economic stabilization, especially 
during a depression, means that it views the primary problem as jump-starting  
“the economy,” rather than facilitating the movement of resources from 
where they mistakenly ended up (in the construction of too many houses, in 
the example of the 2007–08 housing crash) to where they ought to be. The 
latter task actually requires that liquidation and change happen faster while 
reviving a depressed economy. Stabilization policy—as opposed to government 
spending designed to achieve some other purpose, with recession-fighting as 
an alleged ancillary benefit—is really about preventing change. This is just as 
true if stabilization props up the construction industry by spending money on 
infrastructure, or by passing laws making homes easier to buy, or by trying to 
prevent workers’ wages in some industries facing lower demand from falling.
There is a story about a Canadian politician named William Aberhart, who 
visited a public-works project at an airport in the 1930s and discovered 
that workers were being given “picks and shovels [instead of machinery] to 
lengthen the work,” according to newspaper accounts. Machines get the job 
done faster, but shovels allow more people to draw paychecks, just as Keynes 
indicated was necessary. But Aberhart acerbically responded that if jobs were 
the goal, then if workers were given spoons and forks instead of shovels even 
more jobs could be created.3 A very high-cost way of doing things shoved 
aside a lower-cost way. (Note that Keynes, who was willing to bury wealth

­underground and dig it up again to create jobs, would have thought this per-
fectly acceptable.) If creating “jobs” is the primary objective of economic 
policy, other objectives—building airports that open on time and have lower 
(not higher) social cost, for example—don’t get done. Short-term economic 
stabilization, thus, is not the only game in town and may require us to give up 
other things over the longer term.

with short-term economic management.
Economic Policy for the Long Term
The preceding analysis suggests that the modern miracle outlined in Chapter 9 
depends critically on giving people reasons to think for the long term, and the 
analysis in Chapter 4 and throughout the book suggests that an important task 
is the seeking out (or discovering) through competition of better ways to do 
things. One other school of macroeconomic thought, distinct from Keynesian 
economics, is often known as supply-side economics, which asserts that gov-
ernment taxes and regulation of economic activity destroy the incentive to 
take risks and engage in otherwise useful activities. If government focuses on 
enabling potentially profitable risk taking by enforcing property and contract 
rights and controlling market failures but otherwise refraining from taxing and 
regulating, then over the long haul entrepreneurs do their thing and progress 
happens as fast as it can. In the view of the modern supply-sider, taxes are 
always too high and regulation too extensive (and thus too expensive).
That taxes damage the incentive to do socially useful things (while perhaps 
being spent on other socially useful things) is almost beyond dispute. Supply 
and demand tell us that when the returns to activities are lower, people 
will engage in them less. If, say, the income tax goes up from 30 percent to 
50 percent, many attempts to earn more income through entrepreneurial 
gambles (and many other attempts to earn more income through sure things, 
like working more hours) that make the cut at 30 percent will not seem 
worthwhile at 50 percent. This does not in and of itself make the increase 
in tax rates a bad thing; if the money is spent on economically useful things 
(public goods, especially) or people believe the forgone economic growth 
and wealth accumulation are worth the things they get from higher taxes, the 
taxes may be justified. Some of these things that higher taxes may accomplish— 
more uniform allotment of goods, such as health care, for example—are 
things that must be judged morally. Economics is of little help in making these 
calls, although it can help suggest to us the consequences of trying to achieve 
these goals.

Creating a more uniform allotment of goods this year (such as “improving 
income distribution”), by having the state assess high taxes and make sure that 
poorer people get more medical care and rich people less than they other-
wise would, may decrease risk taking and innovation in the medical industries. 
Yet whereas today’s poor do better, the poor and wealthy in the future, who 
aren’t around yet to vote, get less than they otherwise would. This is an inevi-
table cost if progress is the fruit of constant entrepreneurial risk taking, and 
a decrease in such risk taking is the consequence when taxes go up, because 
risk taking has costs. This is nothing more than the implication of positively 
sloped supply curves. This in effect is also a lesson in the importance of think-
ing about the future, as well as of the weakness of democracy (people alive 
today vote, people born tomorrow don’t) as a means for achieving economic 
efficiency. It is no surprise coming from this point of view that public debt and 
deficits in many democracies have increased for decades.
And while the supply-sider criticizes the destructive effects of high taxes, he 
is really, even if unknowingly, criticizing the extensive array of things modern 
governments spend money on. Much of this—in the U.S. context, the retire-
ment program Social Security, the medical programs Medicare and Medicaid, 
the provision of income support to single mothers, and assorted other spend-
ing programs like subsidy of farming—has the effect of lowering much of the 
risk of modern life. No one, as long as Social Security is solvent, need worry 
that his retirement income will fall below a certain level. Of course, its sol-
vency depends on the willingness of future generations to keep paying Social 
Security taxes, which in a climate of diminished economic growth might van-
ish. In that sense, there are no “entitlements,” only claims on future resources 
that future taxpayers may or may not be willing to honor. And government 
spending must of course be funded either out of wealth creation by private 
individuals or else by enslavement of the population, the latter presumably not 
in the offing.
In that sense it is striking that by 2010 the average of government expenditure 
to GDP in the 27 countries of the European Union, according to the EU’s 
statistical office Eurostat, had reached 50.3 percent, with Denmark leading the 
way at 58.2 percent and France in second at 56.2 percent.4 (The comparable 
figure for the U.S. is about 40 percent for all levels of government, but it has 
risen almost continuously for over 100 years.5) The opportunities foregone

301
because of massive government spending are unseen, as most opportunity 
costs are. But as the state has monopolized more and more problem solving, 
it is quite possible that those problems have been solved by political rather 
than economic competition, with all that entails, and that other problems have 
gone unsolved because higher taxes leave fewer resources for entrepreneurs 
to use in trying to solve them. One supposes (and indeed the evidence from 
Communist societies in the 20th century would seem to confirm) that there 
is only so much activity decided on the basis of markets that can be shoved 
aside by the state before the people become unable to effectively coordinate 
scarce-resource use, but I cannot say (no one can, in fact) whether modern 
societies such as the U.S. have reached that point.
On Government Budget Deficits  
and Your Children
The most common argument against restraint of taxation is that it causes 
budget deficits to go up. The supply-sider would reply that cutting taxes 
actually makes revenue go up, because the lower haul of each earned dollar 
taken as taxes encourages people to start and expand their businesses in 
great numbers. A smaller share of much more economic activity thus causes  
revenue to go up. At some level this effect is certainly true; at a tax rate of 100 
percent no activity (outside the nontaxable black market) takes place, because 
all income-earning activity incurs some opportunity cost, and thus ceases to 
be rational. (People would resort to the black market to get that which they 
desired.) Cutting the rate to 90% cannot help but increase revenue. Cutting 
taxes from 90 to 10 percent would almost certainly also increase taxes taken 
in for this reason. But whether cutting taxes from where they are in the U.S. 
now to a modestly lower rate would achieve this is a deeply controversial 
issue, with a majority of economists dismissing this argument. (Google “The 
Laffer Curve” if you are interested.) But if too few taxes are collected rela-
tive to government expenditure, deficits are incurred, and it is often argued 
that tax cutting is damaging to society because of this increase in debt, which 
places obligations on future taxpayers.
Steven Landsburg has offered, in his book The Armchair Economist (Free Press, 
2012) a provocative way of thinking about this problem. (The argument actu-
ally dates to the early 18th-century economist David Ricardo.) Suppose the 
government has decided to spend $1,000 per person on some Critical Task 
and must decide whether to borrow the money or raise it in current taxes. 
Suppose too that you as an individual have $5,000 that you want to set aside 
for your child to receive in 20 years. Suppose finally, for simplicity’s sake, that 
there is only one interest rate paid on your savings and on government bonds, 
and it is the rate that causes one dollar saved today to become two dollars in 

Chapter 13 | Macroeconomics
302
6One can solve for this interest rate by noting that $1(1 + i)20 = $2, with i being the interest 
rate in question. Solving for it yields a rate of approximately 3.53%. (I am assuming no 
inflation, so this is a real interest rate.)
20 years.6 (Assuming multiple interest rates complicates the problem without 
adding much to the analysis.) 
The irresponsible thing to do, we are told, is to borrow the money. Doing that 
means that you put away the $5,000 for your child, which in 20 years becomes 
$5000 × 2 = $10,000, but when he gets it, he also inherits a $1,000 × 2 = 
$2,000 debt obligation. He thus is left with only $8,000, and not the $10,000 
he would’ve otherwise received. So don’t borrow from the children, in other 
words. Pay for things now. But, doing that (by funding the Critical Task through 
taxes levied now) leaves you only $4,000 to save for your child today, which 
thanks to the magic of interest in 20 years becomes $4,000 × 2 = … $8,000! 
Thus, the decision to tax or borrow is irrelevant, and the only thing that takes money 
away from your child is the decision by the government to spend $1,000 of your 
money today instead of allowing you to save it for your own children.
So, the key question is not deficits or taxes, but whether to spend the money 
to begin with. How can we make this decision? Economic theory per se offers 
no conclusive guidance, but there is one distinction that sensible people make 
in their own lives that is useful. That distinction is between consumption and 
investment. The former, recall, is the act of using wealth right now so it is 
unavailable for future use, and the latter is using it to construct something 
that takes a while to finish in the hopes that it will yield greater opportunity 
to consume later. At the individual level, the act of investment, as the term 
is commonly used, is often indistinguishable from saving, although when busi-
nesses invest in factories instead of distributing profits to workers as higher 
wages or to stockholders as higher dividends, the definition becomes clearer. 
For the individual, spending money on a vacation is consumption, and putting 
it away in a retirement fund is investing.
When is it acceptable to borrow money? Sound financial practice generally 
requires that individuals limit their borrowing except to purchase assets that 
will provide extensive value and be used over a long period of time, and per-
haps increase in value in the interim. A house can qualify on both grounds, and 
a car on the first (by enabling someone to drive to work). In each case, bor-
rowing opens up doors to future opportunities to consume or earn income. 
As long as the increase in income allows a person to make his loan payments, 
the investment can be justified (depending on the interest rate, individual 
tastes for the good in question, and so on). Borrowing money for a vacation 
is clearly foolish, because that is momentary consumption today that pro-
duces nothing in the future and will limit consumption opportunities then, as 
opposed to an asset (like a house) that will provide consumption benefits and

would be an investment, and perhaps a justifiable one.
(probably) increased income or wealth in the future. For businesses, too, the 
distinction is clear. Borrowing money to build a new factory may be justifiable 
if the income from the factory allows loan payments to be made and profits 
still to increase. Borrowing money to rent the local NFL stadium for the office 
Christmas party or to make a gold-plated bathroom for the company presi-
dent would be an exercise in self-indulgent consumption and might induce 
shareholders to fire the company president who made that decision.7
In private decision making, the lesson is that borrowing is defensible if you get 
something (get enough, actually) to repay down the line what you have bor-
rowed, whereas borrowing for the here and now is foolish (as is borrowing to 
make investments that are foolish, such as a home that is too expensive). And it 
is the same with government decision making. It is perfectly justifiable for gov-
ernments to borrow money to build projects that over the long term will allow 
citizens to trade more productively with one another and create more wealth. 
Public water and health systems, transportation and other infrastructure, and 
the construction of school buildings are examples of these kinds of investments, 
and governments routinely borrow money to make them. A road, if it enables 
enough wealth creation to generate at least enough tax revenue to pay the loans 
taken out to build it back, can be a justifiable investment, even if it means we go 
into debt right now. As we have seen, private entrepreneurs can provide many of 
these services once the basic infrastructure is built, but the record of increased 
wealth as a result of investments of this kind is impressive. People who live in 
nations with good transportation, communications, and public-health systems 
are, other things equal, more able to convert what they know and have into 
goods they can use by obtaining them through trade with others.
On the other hand, borrowing money to consume right now is just as foolish 
as a family borrowing money to go on vacation. Current expenses—defending 
the country right now, paying retirement benefits right now, subsidizing farm-
ers right now to produce this year’s crop—should be funded out of current 
taxes if the system is to be sustainable. Again, as a reminder, people who lend 
money to the government do not have an ironclad claim to future wealth. The 
security of a government bond is only as good as future taxpayers’ willing-
ness to pay the money the small print in the bonds says they owe, and those 
who have bought bonds issued in recent years by the country of Greece (as 
with many other countries before it; dozens of countries and numerous U.S. 
municipalities defaulted on their debt in the last century) have discovered 
just how shaky those promises are. So a good recipe for responsible govern-
ment decision making, in addition to those mentioned earlier, is to borrow 
money only to fund projects that will raise private productivity enough to justify the 
investment. In that sense, the long-term deterioration in government deficits

in the United States, which have grown in recent years to approach 10% of 
GDP, are worrisome, given that the fastest-growing and largest component of 
federal spending is entitlement spending,8 much of which is the payment of 
cash for living expenses right now, rather than any investments that will make 
us wealthier in the future. (Spending that substantially improves the health of 
the poor, because it would improve the current generation of poor’s human 
capital, might be an exception.)
Note

  The alleged choice between borrowing and burdening our children or taxing now and 
burdening ourselves is usually a false one. The true choice is whether to take resources from people 
in the future or not, regardless of whether we take them now through taxation or later through 
repayment of public debt..
Note finally that the so-called supply-side perspective also includes the deter-
rent effect of regulations (in addition to taxation) on wealth creation. Just 
as with taxes, there is once again a trade-off. Taxes are essential to fund 
government, and government is essential to make private exchange possible. 
But excessive taxation, including in particular when it is imposed on people 
in the future, kills the golden goose, even as it has a certain appeal in demo-
cratic societies. So too with regulations. Regulations to control market failure 
clearly make people better off on balance. We are healthier when people are 
not allowed to pollute the air as the mood strikes them. The state’s effective 
control of theft and violence (offset to some extent by its propensity to wage 
war against other states), something only thoroughly achieved in the last few 
centuries, has been an important human achievement. 
But once the government is accepted as an arbiter of what kinds of trades 
may and may not happen, the regulatory-capture problem quickly surfaces. If 
regulations are used merely to keep foreign airlines from carrying passengers 
within the U.S., thus raising ticket prices, to keep workers who don’t wish to 
join a union from coming on their own to an agreement with their employer, 
or to allow people who oppose real estate development to use wetlands 
regulation to prevent homebuilders from achieving their dream instead of 
bargaining with those homeowners over how to use the land through the 
market (and the market’s value lies precisely in its ability to peacefully arbi-
trate these kinds of disputes), this impoverishes society as a whole. Just as 
public borrowing should be limited to true investments, regulations should be 
limited to those that control externalities that cannot properly be controlled

fix-the-economy/
through the market, and to prevent true tragedy-of-the-commons problems. 
Remember that what economics has to say about whether public spending is 
a good thing or not is limited to talking about its costs. People may decide that 
using the government to insure themselves against life’s setbacks is justified 
despite its cost, and the economist may help inform the public what the costs 
of doing so are likely to be.
If much of this chapter seems like a contradiction of the optimism of Chapter 9, 
remember that it is speculative. I am speculating that the appetite of those 
living today for the money of those yet to be born is very high, and that the 
diversion of resources needed to fund these appetites to government from 
private citizens trying to pursue their interests will cause the economy to 
grow too slowly to generate the taxes in the future needed to pay what has 
been promised today. As we have seen, speculation about the future is difficult, 
and pessimistic speculation is very likely to be wrong. What does differentiate 
the analysis here and the earlier analysis in Chapter 9 is that Chapter 9 takes 
comfort in the long history of entrepreneurs solving what were thought to 
be unsolvable problems, whereas this chapter takes caution from the history 
of government and what drives it, and its frequent hostility towards those 
entrepreneurs in particular. The incentives of those who govern and those 
who create are at odds from time to time. In a book on economics, perhaps 
that is as good a place to end as any.
Economics Out There
13.1.	 In 2011, CNN hosted a discussion between two econo-
mists of some renown9 on how to get the economy mov-
ing again, three years after it crashed. They disagree on 
the wisdom of issuing a lot of new government debt to 
revive it. (Paul Krugman, who supports the debt, actu-
ally colorfully updates the Keynes metaphor by suggesting 
the government persuade the people that an attack from 
outer space is imminent, so that the defenses we build 
will jump-start the economy.) When the government bor-
rows money, it spends scarce resources now. Borrowed 
wealth is spent now. Where is that wealth borrowed 
from? (Hint: the primary answer is not a place or activ-
ity but a time.) Under what circumstances would you be 
prepared to say that large-scale public borrowing, for the 
primary purpose of stimulating the economy, is worthwhile?

Chapter 13 | Macroeconomics

13.2. In an influential piece called “The Burden of the Public 
Debt,” (in Lloyd A. Metzler et al. (eds.), Income, Employment 
and Public Policy, Essays in Honour of Alvin Hanson, (New 
York, NY: W. W. Norton, 1948): 255–275, Abba P. Lerner 
made an argument that public debt is of no consequence 
per se because, in essence, “we owe the money to our-
selves.” In particular, he argued:
A variant of the false analogy is the declaration that 
national debt puts an unfair burden on our children, 
who are thereby made to pay for our extravagances. 
Very few economists need to be reminded that if our 
children or grandchildren repay some of the national 
debt these payments will be made to our children 
or grandchildren and to nobody else. Taking them 
altogether they will no more be impoverished by 
making the repayments than they will be enriched 
by receiving them.
In attempts to discredit the argument that we owe 
the national debt to ourselves it is often pointed out 
that the “we” does not consist of the same people as 
the “ourselves.” The benefits from interest payments 
on the national debt do not accrue to every 
individual in exactly the same degree as the damage 
done to him by the additional taxes made necessary. 
That is why it is not possible to repudiate the whole 
national debt without hurting anybody. While this is 
undoubtedly true, all it means is that some people 
will be better off and some people will be worse off. 
Such a redistribution of wealth is involved in every 
significant happening in our closely interrelated 
economy, in every invention or discovery or act of 
enterprise. If there is some good general reason for 
incurring debt, the redistribution can be ignored 
because we have no more reason for supposing that 
the new distribution is worse than the old one than 
for assuming the opposite. That the distribution will 
be different is no more an argument against national 
debt than it is an argument in favor of it. (p. 256)
Suppose that “the money borrowed now” is given to 
“some people” whose last name starts with a letter 
drawn randomly from an urn, and the necessary taxes 
are later paid by other people whose last names start 
with a different random letter. Will this affect how “some 

Reasonably Simple Economics
307
people,” other people, and the rest of us behave when it 
is possible to issue public debt? (Hint: think about the act 
of deciding how much to consume now and how much to 
invest in hopes of future rewards.) What if “some people” 
receive a check in the name of stimulating the economy 
because they currently do not work for pay, while other 
people later on are made to pay additional taxes because 
the companies they own happen to have a lot of cash to 
spare when it comes time to repay the debt?
Suppose we decide to cancel all homeowner mortgage 
debt in the U.S. because we know that while “some peo-
ple” who held those mortgages and were expecting them 
to be paid off are worse off, other people who are paying 
off (or trying to pay off) those mortgages will be bet-
ter off. Since the mortgages are just “money we owed 
ourselves,” is the forgiveness costless? Is it something we 
should only evaluate on the basis of whether there is “a 
good general reason for it”? As a general rule, to what 
extent is public spending based on debt like or not like an 
“invention or discovery or act of enterprise”?

To my students, past, present, and future

About the Author
Evan Osborne is professor of economics at Wright State University. He 
has taught principles of economics for 20 years and has used economics to 
write about a wide array of topics. His current research interests involve the 
economics of sports and of ancient and contemporary China, and the history 
of individual liberty. But he is interested in everything.

Acknowledgments
First and foremost, I owe a great deal of gratitude to those students who 
ask the most interesting questions and challenge me to back up what I claim. 
Much of what I have learned about how to teach is due to learning from 
them. In addition, teaching and learning do not end at the classroom door, 
and so I have also been very lucky to have two demanding children, the ever-
curious Weymar and the ever-skeptical Victoria, neither of whom will ever 
settle for a lazy answer. I am blessed every day to be able to watch and help 
you grow and to prepare to direct the grand journey of your lives.
Writing a book is a pleasure, but the writer’s ego is far too powerful a force 
to allow him to properly scrutinize his own writing. I thus also owe a lot to 
Jeff Olson and Corbin Collins, whose meticulous attention to every word 
made all those words taken together easier on the reader.

Preface
This is a book originally written for students in the general-education course  
on economics at Wright State University, but my editor at Apress, Jeff Olson,  
told me that it might be helpful for those in the general public who wanted to  
understand economics better. It is not designed for the person who plans to major 
in economics in college, although I would be gratified if such students, and readers 
generally, also found it of use. It is also not written as a standard textbook, with a 
lot of text boxes, mathematicized problem sets, and fancy graphics (although there 
are some simple graphs for discussing supply and demand, because I use them in 
class). It is rather designed to emphasize the fundamentals that, I have noticed over 
the years, some students tend not to remember at exam time, perhaps because 
of the overall volume of material. Much of economics seems easy, obvious even, 
when you learn how to use it, but unless you constantly remind yourself about 
the essentials, it is equally easy to forget how to do so. This text, I hope, provides 
some of the fundamentals of economic thinking as I teach it.
I include some questions in the text, with the answers at the end of each  
chapter. These are not questions about solving supply/demand intersections, 
calculating the optimal amount of output, or doing the other sorts of exercises that 
clog standard undergraduate textbooks. They are usually just extensions of what  
I am discussing in the text, or ways to get students in the habit of applying economic 
reasoning outside its normal domain. There are also questions concerning readings 
that that I have found over the years to be vivid illustrations of some of the principles 
discussed in each chapter (though the reader is supposed to figure out why).
This book has been a lot of fun to write. It has also been a relief to get my 
increasingly chaotically edited notes down on record. I must also note forcefully 
that there is no engaged teaching without engaged students, and I have been 
blessed to have many of those over the years. In addition, I have drawn on the 
wisdom of many others. The thing about being a teacher of college economics 
is that one both makes up and picks up many good stories over the years that 
can be used to illustrate economic ideas. However, with the passage of time, it is 
hard to remember what one came up with on one’s own and what one got from 
elsewhere. So, know that I have been influenced in particular by Paul Heyne’s The 
Economic Way of Thinking (Prentice Hall), particularly the long out-of-print eighth 
edition, Thomas Sowell’s Basic Economics (Basic Books, 2010), Steven E. Landsburg’s 
The Armchair Economist: Economics and Everyday Life (Free Press, 2012), and the 
many insightful posts and stories at Don Boudreaux’s and Russ Roberts’ terrific 
Café Hayek blog. I have tried to credit these authors and others whenever I know 

Preface
xiv
I have taken a story or example from them, but it is possible but I have missed 
some. If so, I apologize.
As a final note, I have one compositional eccentricity. I do not believe in using “he 
or she,” “s/he,” or “they” when what is called for is a singular pronoun. I follow 
the lead of the writer Charles Murray, who believes that sentences calling for a 
singular pronoun ought to have one, and for convenience’s sake that that pronoun 
should just have the same sex as the writer. So when I use “he,” I am making no 
statements about the roles of men and women in economic theory, or in society.
Anyone with comments—approving, dismissive, argumentative, error-flagging 
(including dead web links), curious, or other—is welcome to contact me at
