Unit 6 – segment 1  A conceptual introduction to the 2nd law of 
thermodynamics 

Refrigeration and Heat Pump Cycles 
Where does the ice box fit in our refrigeration cycle? 

A conceptual introduction to the 2nd Law of Thermodynamics 
The 1st law of thermodynamics tells us if a process is allowed or does the process violate the 
conservation of energy? 
 
 
 
 
 
The 2nd law of thermodynamics tells us the allowed direction of a process.  
 
 
 

A conceptual introduction to the 2nd Law of Thermodynamics 
The 2nd law of thermodynamics also allows us to quantify limiting behavior, i.e. maximum and 
minimum values for processes. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The 2nd law of thermodynamics also introduces a lot of other powerful and interesting concepts like 
the absolute temperature scale and the thermodynamic property, entropy = S [kJ/K] and specific 
entropy = s [kJ/(K kg)].  

The 2nd Law of Thermodynamics and Cycles! 

A heat engine only requires a temperature difference to create work.   Some people propose the 
temperature difference between the water at the surface of the ocean (Tocean surface = 22 oC) and the 
ocean floor (Tocean floor = 4 oC at 2000 m below sea level) could be used to create a power plant from this 
free and sustainable resource.  What is the maximum thermodynamic efficiency of such a system?

Unit 6 – segment 2 – the Carnot cycle 

A heat engine only requires a temperature difference to create work.   Some people propose the 
temperature difference between the water at the surface of the ocean (Tocean surface = 22 oC) and the 
ocean floor (Tocean floor = 4 oC at 2000 m below sea level) could be used to create a power plant from this 
free and sustainable resource.  What is the maximum thermodynamic efficiency of such a system? 
 
What are some practical challenges to such a power plant? 
 
There are so many challenges to this type of system! 
Off shore power requires long transmission distances.  Deep ocean depths requires large expensive 
pumps.  The ocean water will cool and heat during transport up and down the pipeline, lowering the 
plant thermal efficiency.  May cause stress on ocean ecosystem due to changes in water movement 
patterns.  The salinity of the water requires expensive equipment for durability.  And may more…

Which power plant will have a higher theoretical efficiency, a power plant

Unit 6 – segment 3 – the Rankine power plant 

 
Which power plant will have a higher theoretical efficiency, a power plant 
that uses water or air? 
 
The composition and phase of the working fluid doesn’t matter.  The 
temperatures of the heat source and cold sink determine the maximum 
theoretical efficiency.

What is the practical lower limit to Plow for a power plant? 

Unit 6 – segment 5 –  more advanced methods to increase the 
efficiency of Rankine power plants 

 
 
 
What is the practical lower limit to Plow for a power plant?  
Ambient pressure, i.e. 1 atm.   
If we go too far below 1 atm, we need to maintain leak-tight connections, which 
will increase the costs of our power plant. 
 

Real power cycles – where are the losses? 

More advanced methods to increase the efficiency of Rankine power 
plants – superheaters. 

More advanced methods to increase the efficiency of Rankine power 
plants – re-heaters. 

There are other methods to further improve the performance of power 
plants, like regeneration, the use of feed water heaters, etc. 
But we will consider a method to dramatically improve the thermal 
efficiency of our power plant by changing their function…
