Why Do You Need
Why Do You Need
Security Consulting?
Security Consulting?
• To find out what you have on
the network
With networks changing so much, few
organizations have an idea of what they
actually have on the network
How can you secure something that
you don’t know you have?

• To find out where your problems are
Virtually all networks have problems,
the difficulty is detecting them and

Security Consulting?
Security Consulting?
• To find out what to do about
the problems
Many problems can be corrected in
house, it’s just a matter of knowing
what to do
Very few network administrators have
the time, experience, and the resulting
expertise to address the intricacies
of security issues

Cisco Differentiators—Personnel
Cisco Differentiators—Personnel
As far as qualifications go, reading the
supplied consultant profiles is like
placing a Tom Clancy character in a
William Gibson novel…
 You can’t help but get the feeling these
people are pretty serious about security

Cisco Differentiators—Personnel
• Primarily from government/military
backgrounds such as:
• AFIWC, SEC, White House, NSA, CIA
Served on UN Inspection Teams to Iraq
Briefed National Security Council
• “White Hat” experience
Not exhackers; most have had top secret
clearances or higher
• Not “script kiddies”
Not dependant on automated tools to do work

• Proprietary tools
Scanning tool is proprietary and developed
and maintained in-house
Beyond standard commercial tools
“Don’t go to a dentist to have teeth
cleaned with toothbrush”
Proprietary tools are highly efficient;
Permits consultants, instead of development
staff, to add new vulnerabilities and modify
code on the fly during an engagement

Common Findings
Common Findings
• External, perimeter systems mostly
secure individually but not together;
gaps common
Dial-in systems are very vulnerable
• Internally, security is practically nonexistent
• Vast majority of clients don’t know of the
systems that are on the network
“You can’t secure it if you don’t know it’s there”
