INTRODUCTION
This book presents the classic relative consistency proofs in set theory 
that are obtained by the device of‘inner models’. Three examples of such 
models are investigated in Chapters VI, VII, and VIII; the most important 
of these, the class of constructible sets, leads to Godel’s result that the 
axiom of choice and the continuum hypothesis are consistent with the 
rest of set theory [1] k
The text thus constitutes an introduction to the results of P. Cohen 
concerning the independence of these axioms [2], and to many other 
relative consistency proofs obtained later by Cohen’s methods.
Chapters I and II introduce the axioms of set theory, and develop such 
parts of the theory as are indispensable for every relative consistency 
proof; the method of recursive definition on the ordinals being an import­
ant case in point. Although, more or less deliberately, no proofs have 
been omitted, the development here will be found to require of the reader 
a certain facility in naive set theory and in the axiomatic method, such 
as should be achieved, for example, in first year graduate work (2e cycle 
de mathematiques).
The background knowledge supposed in logic is no more advanced; 
taken as understood are such elementary ideas of first-order predicate 
logic as prenex normalform, model of a system of axioms, and so on. They 
first come into play in Chapter IV; and though, there too, all the proofs 
(bar that of the reduction of an arbitrary formula to prenex normal form) 
are carried out, the treatment is probably too condensed for a reader 
previously unacquainted with the subject.
Several leading ideas from model theory, not themselves used in this 
book, would nevertheless make the understanding of it simpler; for 
example, the distinction between intuitive natural numbers and the 
natural numbers of the universe, or between what we call formulas and 
what we call expressions, are easier to grasp if something is known about

INTRODUCTION
non-standard models for Peano arithmetic. Similarly, the remarks on p. 
44 will be better understood by someone who knows the completeness 
theorem for predicate calculus.
All these ideas can be found for example in [4] (Chapters I, II, III) 
or [5] (Chapters I, II, III).
The approach of the book may appear a little odd to anyone who thinks 
that axiomatic set theory (as opposed to the naive theory, for which, per­
haps, this is true) must be placed at the very beginning of mathematics. 
For the reader is by no means asked to forget that he has already learnt 
some mathematics; on the contrary we rely on the experience he has 
acquired from the study of axiomatic theories to offer him another one: 
the theory of binary relations which satisfy the Zermelo/Fraenkel axioms. 
As we progress, what distinguishes this particular theory from other 
axiomatic theories gradually emerges. For the concepts introduced 
naturally in the study of models of this theory are exactly parallel to the 
most fundamental mathematical concepts - natural numbers, finite sets, 
denumerable sets, and so on. And since standard mathematical vocabulary 
fails to provide two different names for each idea, we are obliged to use 
the everyday words also when referring to models of the Zermelo/Fraenkel 
axioms. The words are thereby used with a completely different meaning, 
the classic example of this being the ‘Skolem paradox’, which comes 
from the new sense that the word ‘denumerable’ takes when interpreted in 
a model of set theory.
Eventually it becomes obvious that even the everyday senses of these 
words are by no means clear to us, and that we can perhaps try to 
sharpen them with the new tools which are developed in the study of set 
theory. Had this problem been posed already at the beginning of the 
study it would have been tempting to shirk it, by saying that mathematics 
is merely the business of manipulating meaningless symbols.
It is an open question how much set theory can do in this field; but 
it seems likely that what it can do will be of interest beyond mathematical 
logic itself.

tions to the original French edition.

CHAPTER I
THE ZERMELO/FRAENKEL AXIOMS OF SET THEORY
When we formulate the axioms of set theory, we have to rely on an intuitive 
understanding of sets, in much the same way that we develop the axioms 
for a vector space from commonsense ideas about three-dimensional 
space. Despite this, once we have the axioms of set theory written down 
we are free to study any other structure in which they hold, just as we 
study many vector spaces over and above the Euclidean space R3. Thus 
set theory is no different from any other axiomatic theory familiar to the 
reader. It is, like the theories of groups, rings, fields, vector spaces, 
lattices, and so on, an abstract theory.
A structure satisfying the axioms of set theory is called a universe. A 
universe is basically a collection of objects called sets. We do not say 
‘a set of objects’, since what we are going to call sets are just those objects 
of which % is a collection. It is a straightforward precaution when defining 
vector spaces, for example, not to use the same word both for the vector 
space and for a vector in it. The same applies here.
Also involved in is a single undefined binary relation, a relation 
which links some of the objects of with others. It is called the member­
ship relation, and is denoted by e. We read the expression ‘x e y9 as ‘x 
belongs to y9, or ‘the set x belongs to the set y9, or ‘x is a member of y9, 
or ‘x is an element of y’, or even ‘the set y contains the element x’.
Since e is a relation on the universe it holds only between sets. The 
symbol ‘e’ and the words ‘belong’, ‘contain’, ‘member’, and ‘element’ will 
be used only when this particular relation is intended; and should we 
ever use any of these words in their everyday senses, we shall state this 
explicitly. For example, we will not normally say ‘the object x is an element 
of the collection but ‘x is in W,
So a universe can be pictured as a graph of the kind shown in figure 1; 
the arrow indicates that the object at its head is an element of the one at 
its tail. For example, b e a, c e c.
Nothing said so far imposes any restriction on the binary relation e. 
In order to do just this we now begin to list the axioms of set theory.

INTRODUCTION TO AXIOMATIC SET THEORY
Fig. 1.
1. AXIOM OF EXTENSIONALITY
No two distinct sets in $1 have the same elements. We write this as
VxVy [Vz (z e x <-> z e y) -> x = y] .
This axiom is not satisfied by the binary relation shown in the figure; for 
b and c are different, yet each has c as its only element.
A useful ‘axiom’ to put down now, though we will not number it since 
it turns out to be a consequence of later ones, is the pairing axiom. Given 
two sets a and Z>, this axiom guarantees the existence of a set c containing 
a and b as its only elements. By the axiom of extensionality there is only 
one such set c. We write the pairing axiom as
VxVyBzVt[t e z *-> t = x v t — y].
We write {a, b} for the set c whose only elements are a and b. A special 
case is when a and b are the same set; it follows from the axiom that there 
is a set {a} containing a, and a alone.

THE ZERMELO/FRAENKEL AXIOMS

If a we call {a, b} a pair. The set {a} is sometimes called a singleton 
or unit set.
From two sets a and b three applications of the pairing axiom yield 
the set {{a}, {a, b}}, called the ordered pair of a and b and usually denoted 
by <a, by. The following theorem justifies this definition.
Theorem : If {a, by = <a', b'y then a=a' and b=b'.
Proof: If a=b then <a, by = {{a}}, and so <a, by has only one element. 
Thus <a', b'y is also a singleton, which means that a'=b'. It follows that 
{{#}} = {{a'}}, and so a = a'; thus b = b' too.
When a^b. {a, by is a pair, and so <a', b'y must also be one. This can 
only be true if a' ^ b'.
But as {{a}, {a, b}} = {{a'}> {a’> £'}}> either
{a} = {a', b'} and {a, b] = {a'} 
or
{a} — {a'} and {a, b} = {a', b'} .
The former possibility is ruled out simply because {a} is a singleton whilst 
{a', b'} is a pair. Thus {a} = {a'} - and so a=a' - and {a, b} = {a', b'} - and 
sob=b'. |
If a, b, c are sets, the set <#, <Z>, c>> is called the ordered triple of a, b, c, 
and is denoted by <a, b, cy.
Theorem: If {a, b, dy = ^a\ b', c'y then a=a' ,b=b', c=c'.
Proof: From the identity of <6Z, <Z>, c» and <#', <Z/, c'» we get a=a' 
and <Z>, cy = (b', c'y. Thus also b=b' and c=c’. |
In the same way we can define the ordered quadruple <a, 6, c, dy by
<a, &, c, dy — (a, <&, c, ,
and for any n>0 the ordered n-tuple <a0, a19..., by

INTRODUCTION TO AXIOMATIC SET THEORY
It should be noted that, given three distinct sets a, b9 c in the universe 
we do not yet have any way of proving the existence of a set d containing 
just a, Z>, and c as members. The next axiom fills this gap.
2. UNION AXIOM (OR SUM-SET AXIOM)
According to this axiom, to every set a there corresponds a set b whose 
members are precisely the members of the members of a. We write this 
formally as
Vx3yVz[zGy«->EU(£gx a zet)].
The set b9 called the union of the members of a (or, more briefly, the union 
of a) and denoted by |J x (or is unique; for any set b' having the 
x e a
same property would necessarily have the same elements as, and so be 
identical with, b.
This axiom solves the problem posed above. For if a9 b, and c are sets, 
the set d= |J {{a9 b}9 {c}} contains a, b, and c, and nothing more besides. 
We write the set d as {a9 b, c}.
More generally, any finite number of sets a0, 6^,..., an-.1 can be 
collected together into a set {aQ, ..., containing them and them 
only. This is easily proved by induction on n; we need only observe that 
IJ {{fl0, #!,..., 
has the desired property for n if
{a0, an_2}hasitforw — 1.
If a and b are sets, then the union of {a, b} is called the union of a and b, 
and written a u b. It is trivial that a u (b u c) = (a u b) u c = (b u a) u c = 
=the union of the set {a, b, <?}.
The same applies for any finite number of sets a0, an-i; the 
union of the members of {fl0> a19...9 an-i} is called the union of a0, al9 
and ..., andan-i and written a0 u a± u ... u .
3. POWER-SET AXIOM
Let a and b be sets in The statement Vx(x g a -> x e b) is abbreviated 
a c b9 and read 'a is included in or ‘a is a subset of b\
The power-set axiom tells us that, given a set a, there exists a set b 
whose members are just a’s subsets; in symbols it becomes
Vx3yVz [z G y z c: x] .

THE ZERMELO/FRAENKEL AXIOMS

By the axiom of extensionality only one set b can have this property. It is 
called the power-set of a and written
It is worth emphasizing at this point that we shall now use the words 
‘subset’ and ‘include’ only in the sense given them above, to express a 
relation between two objects of the universe. This sense is quite different 
from the usual one (when we say, for instance, that a class is included 
in the universe). We call it the formal sense of the word ‘include’ (or 
‘subset’), and the usual one will be called the intuitive sense. To avoid 
from the start any possible confusion that might arise, let us agree that 
when we use the words ‘subset’ and ‘include’ without qualification, we 
are using them in their formal senses; any use of these words in their 
intuitive senses will be noted as such explicitly.
For instance: each set a defines a subset (in the intuitive sense) of the 
universe namely the part A composed of the elements of a. Now if b 
is a set included in a, then the corresponding B is included (in the intuitive 
sense) in A. But there may be - and indeed often are - subsets (in the 
intuitive sense) of A to which no object of the universe corresponds; to 
which, that is, there is no corresponding subset of a.
Before giving the remaining axioms of set theory we must discuss how 
relations, over and above those we already have, can be defined on <%. At 
present we have only the membership relation xey, and the equality 
relation x=y (which is satisfied by a and b if and only if a and b are the 
same object). The following rules allow us to define others.
I. Given a relation (of three arguments, for instance) R(x, y, z), and 
an object a in ^/, then we can define a binary relation R(a9 y, z), to be 
satisfied by the objects b and c iff R(a, b, c) holds.
II. Given a relation (three arguments, say) R (x, y, z), then we can define 
a binary relation R(x, x, z); this is satisfied by a and b iff R(a, a, b) holds.
III. Given any relation (say of two arguments) 7?(x, y), we can define 
“i R(x, y), a relation satisfied by a and b iff R(a, b) does not hold.
Likewise from two relations (of three arguments again) R(x, y, z) and 
S(u, x, v) we can define a relation R(x, y, z) v S(u, x, v) of five arguments 
satisfied by a, b, c, d, e iff one or other of R(a, b9 c) and S(d, a, e) holds.
IV. Again, from a ternary relation R(x, y, z) we can define a binary 
relation 3y7?(x, y, z) which is satisfied by a and c iff R(a, b, e) holds for 
some b in

6
INTRODUCTION TO AXIOMATIC SET THEORY
Starting from the two binary relations x e y and x=y we can, by repeated 
applications of these rules, obtain relations of any number of argu­
ments.
Suppose that R(x, >’) and 5(y, z) are two binary relations; then the 
relation ~1R v 5 is written R -> 5. The relation “i(tRv-iS) is 
written R a 5; it is satisfied by a, b, and c iff R(a, b) and S(b, c) both 
hold. Similarly, R S abbreviates (R -> 5) a (5 -> R), and is satisfied 
by a, b, c iff R(a, b) and S(b, c) either both hold or both fail.
Likewise, the singulary relation ”i3x”iR(x, y), written YxR(x,y) is 
satisfied by b iff R (a, b) holds for every object a in
Relations constructed from xey and x=y by rules I-IV are thus 
defined by formulas composed (though not in an arbitrary fashion) from 
the symbols =, e, , v, 3, the variables x, y,z,u,v,..., and objects in
It is clear that further relations on can be defined by other methods. 
But we shall not consider them in this book.
A relation R(x) of a single argument is usually called a class. A class is 
a subcollection (intuitively speaking) of the universe $1. For example, the 
formula
Vw [w e x -> 3r[u e x a W(t ev t = u v t e w)]] 
defines a class; the formula
u e x 3v[v e x a Vr(t ev t = u v tew)] 
defines a binary relation R(u, x). So if a is in the formula R(a, x), 
namely
a e x 3v\y e x a Vt(t ev <-+t = a v tea)],
defines a class.
Objects of % which appear in a formula E are called the parameters 
of E. R(u, x), for example, has no parameters; R(a, x) has the object a as 
its sole parameter.
A formula of no arguments at all, a closed formula or sentence as it is 
called, is either true or false in the universe. For example, the formula 
3x3y[Vz(z^y) a yex a VwR(m, x)] (where the relation R is defined 
above) is a sentence without parameters (it will later turn up in a slightly 
different form as the axiom of infinity).
The theorems of set theory (and the axioms in particular) are all closed 
formulas without parameters.

THE ZERMELO/FRAENKEL AXIOMS

Equivalence Relations: A binary relation R(x, y) is an equivalence relation 
if, whatever objects a, b, c might be,
R(a, b) R(a, a) a R(b, b);
R(a, b) -> R(b, a);
R(a, b) a R(b, c) -> R(a, c).
The class R(x, x) is called the domain of the equivalence relation. R(a, b) 
is also written a~b (mod. R). For any set a in the class R(a, y) is 
called the equivalence class of a.
Ordering Relations (in the weak sense): A binary relation R(x, y) is an 
ordering relation (or, briefly, an ordering) in the weak sense if for every 
a, b, and c z , x z x z 1 x
R (a, b) -> R (a, a) a R (b, b);
R(a, b) a R(b, a) -> a — b;
R(a, &) a R(&, c) -> R(a, c).
The class R(x, x) is the domain of the ordering. R(a, b) is also written 
a^b (mod. R); R(a, b) a b^a may similarly be abbreviated as a<b 
(mod. R).
R is a (weak) linear (or simple, or total) ordering if, over and above all 
this, one or other of R(a, b) and R(b, a) holds for any two objects a, b 
in R’s domain.
Ordering Relations (in the strict sense): A binary relation R(x, y) defines 
a strict ordering on a class D(x) if for all a, b9 c,
R(a, b) D(a) a D(b);
n (R(a, b) a R(&, a));
R(a, b) a R(&, c) -> R(a, c).
R(a, b) may again be written a<b (mod. R). It is obvious that if R(x, y) 
is a strict ordering, then the relation R(x,y) v [Z>(x) a D(y) a x=y] 
is a weak one, with domain D.
A strict ordering R on D is linear if for any objects a and b in the class 
D, either R(a, b) or R(Z>, a) or a—b.
Functional Relations: Consider by way of illustration a ternary relation 
R(x, y, z). We will call it a functional relation of two arguments if
VxVyVzVz' [R(x, y, z) a R(x, y, z') -> z = z'] .

8
INTRODUCTION TO AXIOMATIC SET THEORY
The binary relation 3zR(x, y9 z) is then called the domain of the func­
tional relation R. The class 3x3yE(x, y9 z) is called the range of the 
functional relation R.
For any (for example binary) functional relation defined everywhere 
(in other words, a functional relation with domain x = x a y =y) we can 
introduce a new symbol and write the functional relation as z = <P(x, y). 
Then, for any formula E(u9 v, w), the formulas
3z[jR(x, y9 z) a E(z, v9 w)] 
and Vz [jR (x, y9z) E (z, v, w)J
(which are equivalent to one another) can be written simply as
E[$(x9 y), v9 w].
For example, the functional relation
Vt[t e z <-> t = x v t = y]
is written z = {x, y); thus the equivalent formulas
3z[Vt(t e z t = x v t = y) a zea] 
Vz [Yt(t e z <-> t = x v t = y) z e a] 
can both be abbreviated by {x, y] e a.
We can now go on to state the other axioms of set theory.
4. AXIOM SCHEME OF REPLACEMENT (OR SUBSTITUTION)
Suppose a formula E(x9 y, a0,..., ak_r) with parameters a09 ...9ak_± 
defines a singulary functional relation; and let a be any set. Then we shall 
postulate that the universe contains a set b whose elements are just the 
images under this functional relation of those elements of a within its 
domain. The demand on % that it satisfy this condition for any singulary 
functional relation is known as the axiom scheme of replacement. The 
scheme is rendered symbolically by the following infinite list of sentences:
Vx0 ... Vxfe _ t {VxVyVy' [E (x, y, x0,..., xk_ t) 
a E(x, y', x0?Xfc-i) -> y = y'] 
-> Vt3wVu[u e w <-> 3u [u e t a E(u9v9 x0, ..., xk_ t)]]}.
Here E(x, y, x0,..., x^-J may be any parameter-free formula with at 
least two free variables x and y.

THE ZERMELO/FRAENKEL AXIOMS
9
The axioms 1, 2, 3, the scheme 4, and the axiom of infinity (introduced 
on p. 29 below) make up the set theory of Zermelo and Fraenkel, usually 
abbreviated ZF.
Easily derived from the scheme of replacement is the following scheme.
Scheme of Comprehension: If a is a set, and A(x, 
ak-±) any formula
of one free variable (and parameters #0,..., we can establish that 
there is a set whose elements are exactly those elements of a for which A 
holds. This is the content of the comprehension scheme, which consists 
of the following infinite list of sentences:
Vx0 ... VXfc-iVxSyVzfz e y <-*(zex a A(z, x0,..., xfc_x))] .
Here A(x, x0,..., xfc-i) is any parameter-free formula of at least one free 
variable x. To derive any instance of the scheme from the scheme of 
replacement it is enough to note that the formulay=x a A(x, aQ9...9ak_f) 
defines a singulary functional relation F whose domain is the class 
A(x, a0,..., By replacement then, there is a set b whose elements 
are just the images under F of those members of a in F’s domain; it is 
immediate that b is the set whose existence we set out to prove.
The set b is usefully represented by the notation
{xea\A(x,a0,...,ak-1)}.
Theorem : There is one and only one set without elements.
Proof: Let a be any set at all. We apply the comprehension scheme to 
the set a and the formula x^x to get a set b = {x e a | x^x}, which is 
obviously without elements. That there cannot be more than one such 
set follows at once from the axiom of extensionality. |
The set just defined is called the empty set and is denoted by 0.
Let us give a derivation of the pairing axiom from axiom 3 and the 
scheme 4. First of all, every subset of 0 is empty, so that ^(0) has 0 as 
its only element; thus {0} exists. This latter set is a singleton, so if a <= {0} 
then a=0 or a = {0}. So ^({0}) has just two distinct elements, 0 and {0}; 
thus {0, {0}} exists. Now let a and b be any sets you like. It is apparent 
that the relation (x=0 a y=a) v (x={0) a y=b) is a singulary func­
tional relation, so we can apply the replacement scheme to it and consider 

10
INTRODUCTION TO AXIOMATIC SET THEORY
the image of the set {0, {0}} thereunder. This turns out to be the set 
{a9 b}9 and thus the pairing axiom is proved.
We say that a class A (x) corresponds to a set (or even, twisting language a 
bit, is a set) if there is a set a such that Vx(x e a ^(x)). More generally, 
a relation (of three arguments, for example) A(x, y, z) corresponds to a 
set, or even is a set, if there is a set a for which we have VxVyVz[<x, y, z) e 
e a A(x, y, z)].
It is not true that every class corresponds to a set; for example, the 
class x^ x does not. If it did, indeed, we would for some a have that 
Vx(x e a x x); so, in particular, ae a+-* a$ a9 which is evidently 
false. (This is Russell’s paradox.)
The class x=x (the universe in other words) also fails to correspond 
to a set. For were there any set a such that Vx(x e a) were true, we could, 
by using the comprehension scheme, produce a set b such that Vx(x e b 
<->xea a x^x); that is, Vx(x e b <-> x £ x). So Russell’s paradox would 
turn up all over again.
Cartesian Product of two sets: Consider the formula X(z) abbreviated by 
3x3 y [z = <x, y) a xea a y e &].
To write this out in full we would first have to use the definition of the 
functional relation z = <x, y>, obtaining
3x3y3w3r[z = {u, u} a u = {x} a v — {x, y}
a x e a a yeb],
The braces could then be eliminated with the definition of the functional 
relation z—{u, v}9 leaving
3x3y3w3r[Vr(t e z <-> t = u v t = v) 
a Vt'(t' e u <-> t' = x) 
a ev<->t" = x v t" = y) 
a xe a a yeb].
So X(z) is just this last formula, and it clearly is the class of all ordered 
pairs <x,y> such that xea and yeb. (We will not bother to carry 
out this sort of check in the future; but it is suggested that the reader try 
a few, to get himself used to the business of manipulating formulas.)
Nowthisclass X is in fact a set; for if x e a and yeb then (by the defini­

tion of <x, y» <x, y) e&(0*(a u &)). But then X(z) is equivalent to 
X(z) a ze^(^(a u Z>)), so that by the comprehension scheme X is 
a set.
This set X is called the Cartesian (or direct, or cross) product of the sets 
a, b, and it is written a x b. The Cartesian powers ax a, ax (ax a), and so 
on, are sometimes abbreviated a2, a3,....
A singulary functional relation R(x, y) whose domain is a set is itself 
a set. For suppose that the domain is a; then by the replacement scheme 
there is a set b consisting of the images of a under R, Consequently 
R(x, y) is equivalent to R(x, y) a <x, y> eaxb, and this class is a set 
f by the comprehension scheme. Such a set f is called a function defined 
on a, with values in b, or a map from a to b, or a family of sets indexed by a. 
If a is a map we will sometimes write dom(a), rng(a) for its domain and 
range respectively.
The formula ‘/is a map from a into b\ written more compactly f:a 
b
is therefore just the following formula:
f caxb a VxVyVy' [<x, y> e f a <x, y'> e / -► y = y'J 
a Vx [x e a -► Sy (y e b a <x, y> e /)].
We leave to the reader the task of eliminating the defined symbols <=, x, 
and < >.
If a and b are sets the class X of all maps from a into b is again a set. For 
a map from a to b is a subset of a x b, and therefore a member of &(a x b). 
So X(f) is equivalent to X(f) a f e &(axb). Comprehension yields 
the desired result.
This set of maps is written ab.
Union, Intersection, and Cartesian Product of a family of sets: Let a be a 
family of sets indexed by I; a is of course just a map whose domain is I, 
and to indicate this we will usually write a family as (a^ieI,
The union of the family (a^)ieI, written IJai> is the union of the range 
i e I
of the map a. By the replacement scheme and union axiom it is a set b, 
and we have Vx[x e b 3i(i el a x e af)].
Likewise the intersection of the family (at)ieI is the class X(x) defined 
by Vz(* e I -> x e af). If 7=0, then X is the class of all sets, and so not a 
set itself. Otherwise, take any i0 e I; then A"(x) is equivalent to x e aiQ a

Note that for the rest of the book we shall be using the words ‘map’ and 
‘function’ in the sense defined above, which is by no means their every­
day mathematical sense (since here, for example, all maps f\ a b 
are in the universe). As we proliferate definitions the same thing will 
happen to nearly all the familiar words of mathematical language. If we 
ever use the words in their normal senses (and this will not happen often), 
we will, as we decided before, say so explicitly. For example: let a and b 
be two sets, and A, B be the corresponding parts of the universe. If f 
maps a into b there will correspondingly be a map (in the intuitive sense) 
from A to B. But there may well be, intuitively speaking, maps from A 
to B to which there are no corresponding maps from a into b.

CHAPTER II
ORDINALS, CARDINALS
Well-ordering Relations: Let a be a set, all of whose elements lie in the 
domain of some linear ordering R(x, y). We say that a is well ordered 
by R if every non-empty subset of a has a smallest element (mod. R). It 
is immediate that if a is well ordered by R then every subset of a is also 
well ordered by R.
If r c a x a then the pair <a, r> is said to be a well-ordered system if a 
is well ordered by the relation <x, e r.
Suppose that the set a is well ordered by the relation R. A subset s of a 
is said to be an initial segment of a if x e £ and y < x (mod. R) imply yes, 
for any x, y e a. For each x0 in a we write SXQ(a, R) (or SXo(a) if there is 
no danger of ambiguity) for the set {xea | x<xQ (mod. R)}, and this 
set is evidently an initial segment of a.
Indeed, a subset s c a is an initial segment of a iff s = a or s = SXo(a) for 
some Xq e a.
This is easily proved by noting that if s is an initial segment of a, but 
not a itself, then the set {x e a | x $ 5} is non-empty. Consequently, 
it has a least element x0; so if x<x0, x must be in s; and conversely, if 
x> x0, we cannot have xes (for that implies that x0 e s).
An initial segment of a which is not just a itself is called a proper initial 
segment of a.
If R is a linear ordering, and x is in the domain of R, let 5X(R) stand 
for the class of y’s in the domain of R which are <x (mod. R). Then R 
is called a well-ordering (relation) if, for any x in its domain, the class 
SX(R) is a set, and is also well ordered by R.
If R is a well-ordering with domain D, and T any non-empty subclass of 
D (that is, Vx ( T(x) -* D (x)) a 3xT(x)), then Thas a least element (mod. R).
For Tis non-empty, so take x0 in T. Either x0 is the least element of T, 
or else the class T a SXo(R) is non-empty. This class is however a set 
(since 5X0(R) is a set), and indeed a non-empty subset of 5Xo(R), which 
is well ordered. It therefore has a least element, which is obviously also 
the least element of T.

INTRODUCTION TO AXIOMATIC SET THEORY
(Our talk here of elements of the class T is to be understood as using 
‘element’ in an informal way only.)
The Class of Ordinals: A set a is called transitive if every element of a is 
also a subset of a; that is, if Vx (x e a -> x c a). A set a is called an ordinal 
if, in addition to being transitive, it is strictly well ordered by the member­
ship relation x e y.
The class 6a is an ordinal’ is written On(a); spelt out more or less in 
full this becomes
VxVy [xea a y e a -> x y v y x]
a VxVyVz[xea a yea a z e a a xey a ye z -> xez] 
a Vz [z c a a z / 0 -> 3x(x e z
a Vy (y e z -> x e y v x — y))] 
a VxVy[xea a y ex -> y ea].
(In this extensive formula there is no explicit mention of the fact that the 
ordering x e y is linear; however, no such clause is needed, since we have 
stated that every non-empty subset of a contains a smallest element, 
and a fortiori this applies to subsets of two elements.)
Examples of ordinals that are easily shown to be such are 0, {0}, 
{0X0}}-
Let a be an ordinal. Then the initial segments of a are a itself and the 
elements of a.
For a proper initial segment of a is 5^(a) for some £ e a; and S$(a) = 
= {rj 
— e a\r] g £} = £ n a. But since £ c a, this last term
reduces to and the result is proved.
Every element of an ordinal is an ordinal.
Take £ea; then ^ca, so membership well-orders £ Furthermore, 
if y e x and x e £ then xea (since £ <= a); so x c: a, so y e a. Now 
membership strictly orders the elements of a, so from y e x and x e we 
get y e £. Thus x e £ implies that x c and the two conditions for £ 
to be an ordinal are established.
For every ordinal a, a $ a.
If f is any element of a, then £ since e strictly orders a. So if a is 
an element of a we must have a £ a. Thus a £ a.
For every two ordinals a, /?, either a = ft, or ft e a, or a e ft; moreover, the 
three cases are mutually exclusive.

ORDINALS, CARDINALS
15
Put i = a n p. Then £ consists of all members of a that are < P (mod. e), 
and so is an initial segment of a. Thus £ = a or £ e a. Likewise f is an initial 
segment of /?, so <!;=/? or £ e /?. All in all then, there are four possibilities:
£ = a
and t~P;
then
01 = p.
£ = a
and
iep-,
then
ae p.
t = P
and
£ e a;
then
Pea.
£ea
and
£e/?;
then
£ e a n p, so by the definition
of £, £ e But this is a contradiction, since f is an ordinal. 
Furthermore, a=P and a e P together would imply that pe P; similarly, 
if a e /?, then a cz /?, so if /? e a were also true, we would have P e p again.
But p $ p. Thus the three cases are mutually exclusive.
The membership relation on the class On (that is, the relation x e y a 
a On(x) a On(y)) is a well-ordering.
We have just shown the relation in question to be a strict linear ordering. 
So we need only note that since £ <a <-> £ e a, Sa(e) = a for every ordinal 
a, and a is well ordered by e.
Observe that if a, p are ordinals then a^P «-► a cz p.
On is not a set.
Suppose On is a set a. Then a is well ordered by e. Moreover, every 
element of a is an ordinal, therefore a set of ordinals, therefore a subset 
of a. But then a qualifies as an ordinal; so a e a. But this is impossible 
for ordinals.
If a is an ordinal the least ordinal greater than a is a u {a}. This is called 
the successor of a, and written a 4-1.
It is easily checked that if a is an ordinal then so is P = a u {a}. Now 
sinceae P, wehavea</?;andifa<y thenaey, soa c y,soa u {a} cz y. 
Thus/?^y.
Since 0 cz a for any a, the ordinal 0 is the least ordinal of all. We call 
it 0. Its successor {0} is called 1; its successor 1 u {1} (that is, {0, {0}}) is 
called 2; and so on.
The union of any set of ordinals is the least upper bound of the set.
Let a be any set of ordinals, and p = (J a. If x is a non-empty subset 
otea
of P, then for at least one a0 e a we will have x r\ a0 non-empty. Since 
a0 is well ordered, its subset x n a0 will therefore have a least element, 
which is clearly also the least element of x. Since x was an arbitrary 
non-empty subset of p, it follows that p is well ordered by e. Now suppose 

16
INTRODUCTION TO AXIOMATIC SET THEORY
that y ex and xe p, Then x e a for some a e a, so yea since a is an 
ordinal. We conclude that yefi, and this establishes that p is transitive. 
It is thus an ordinal. Moreover a p for any a e a, so P is an upper 
bound of a, And if a y for any a e a, then a cz y for any a e a, so p cz y, 
so p y. Thus p is the least upper bound of a.
Theorem : Let a, p be ordinals, and f an order-preserving isomorphism 
from a on to p, Then a = p, andf is the identity map.
Proof: Suppose f is not the identity, and let £ be the least member 
of a for which /(£)?££. Then t] e £ -> f {r]) = q, so £ cz p. Being an 
ordinal, £ is an initial segment of p; but it is not P itself, for in that case 
f would map a proper initial segment of a on to the whole of p, which is 
not possible if/is an isomorphism. Thus £ e
Since /is order-preserving, >?<£ ->/(>?)</(£); by the definition of £ 
therefore, ti<f{£) for every qe^, Thus £ cz/(£), or, equivalently, 
£ </ (£). Equality is ruled out, so £ </ (£). We now ask which element of 
a is mapped by / to £ (which is in P, as proved above). It is easily seen 
that there cannot be one, since ->/(*)>£ and x<£ ->/(x)<£; 
thus/is not an isomorphism from a on to p, |
Theorem: For each well-ordered system u = (a,r) there exists exactly one 
(order-preserving) isomorphism from a on to an ordinal.
Proof: {Uniqueness) Suppose/maps a one-one on to a, and g does the 
same on to p. Then g ° f ~1 is an isomorphism from a on to /?, and it can 
only be the identity. So/=#.
{Existence) Put b = {x e a \ Sx{a) is isomorphic to an ordinal}. By 
uniqueness no such Sx{a) can be isomorphic to more than one ordinal, 
so let P(x) be the ordinal that Sx{a) is isomorphic to.
If yeb and x<y then x must be in b, and, indeed, p{x)<p{y)\ for 
under the isomorphism from Sy{a) on to P{y), the proper initial segment 
Sx{a) of Sy{d) becomes a proper initial segment of P{y), and therefore 
an ordinal less than P{y), therefore P{x), Thus b is an initial segment of a.
By replacement we can form the set P of those ordinals P{x) where 
x e b. Now £ P{x) implies that £ is isomorphic to an initial segment of 
Sx{af say Sy{a) for some y ^x (so that £=P{y)). It follows that p is an 
initial segment of the ordinals, and therefore itself an ordinal.
Thus the map sending x to p{x) is an isomorphism from b on to p.

ORDINALS, CARDINALS
17
Our existence proof will be complete if we can show that b=a. And 
this is simply done. For suppose b^a; since b is an initial segment of a, 
it must be true for some x0 e a that b = SXQ(a). We have just proved that 
b is isomorphic to an ordinal, so it follows from the definition of b that 
x0 eb; but it is impossible that xQ e SXQ(a), by the very definition of 
initial segment. Thus b=a after all. |
Consider now any well-ordering R(x9y) whose domain D is not a set; 
we shall define a functional relation J which establishes an isomorphism 
between D and On.
The functional relation J(x) = a is defined by the formula ‘a is an 
ordinal isomorphic to the segment Sx(Rf. This is a functional relation all 
right, and its domain is D; for whatever x we pick in D there is one and 
only one ordinal isomorphic to SX(R). It is also an order-preserving 
isomorphism. For if x <y (mod. 7?) then SX(R) is a proper initial segment 
of Sy(R). But Sy(R) can be isomorphically mapped on to J(y), and the 
image of SX(R) under this mapping will form a proper initial segment 
of J(j>), which is thus an ordinal J(x)
Furthermore, the range of J is an initial segment of On; for if p^ 
J(x) then when J(x) is mapped on to SX(R), p is mapped on to an initial 
segment of the latter, Sy(R) say, for some j^x. Thus P=J(yy Since Jis 
one-one it has an inverse J-1 which maps the range of J into D. But D is 
not a set, so by replacement the domain of J-1 is not a set. Thus the 
range of Jis some initial segment of On; but not a set.
Under these circumstances it can only be On itself, which establishes 
that Jis a surjection.
Note that no other functional relation J' could be used to establish an 
isomorphism between D and On. For whatever x in D we choose, J'(x) 
is an ordinal isomorphic to Sx(7?); only one ordinal has this property, and 
this is J(x). Thus J' (x)=J(x) at every point x in D.
Proof by Induction on the Ordinals: Let E(x) be some formula containing 
only the variable x free. If E(a) is to hold for every ordinal a, it is necessary 
and sufficient that E(d) holds whenever E(fi) holds for every P <a; more 
succinctly, that
holds generally.

18
INTRODUCTION TO AXIOMATIC SET THEORY
The proof falls out at once. If F(a) is false for any ordinal at all, we 
let a be the least such ordinal. Then £(/?) is true whenever /?<a, and so 
by hypothesis E(a) is true, which is a contradiction.
This method of proof of VaE(a) is called proof by induction.
Definition by Recursion on the Ordinals: Suppose that F is a functional 
relation and T a subclass of F’s domain. That functional relation y = 
= F(x) a F(x) which restricts F to T is written F f T; in particular, 
if a is a subset of the domain of F, then F fa represents a map, the re­
striction of Fto a.
Theorem: Let a be an ordinal; A a class; M the class of all maps defined 
on ordinals less than a, and taking values in A; and H a functional relation 
with domain M, and taking values in A. Then there exists one and only one 
map f defined on a for which f(fi) = H(f\P) for every Pea.
Proof: (Uniqueness') This is routine. Suppose distinct functions f and g 
both did the job required, and let p be the least ordinal in a where
Then/(?) = # (y) for y<p, so /f p = g f p. But this means 
that f (P) = H(f f p) = H(g \ P) = g (P), which is impossible.
(Existence) Let t be the set of all p <a on which there is defined a map 
fp satisfying ff(y)=H(ff f y)for every y<j8.
It is clear that t is an initial segment of a. By the uniqueness part of 
the theorem, indeed, we actually have fp—fytP for p<pfei:. Thus 
t is an ordinal ^a, and we can define a map/. on t as follows: fi(P) = 
= H(ff), for every P e t.
Suppose ye per; then/I(?)=jff(4)=jff(4 t y)=4(?)- Thus/p=/t f 0. 
Consequently,fffi) = H(fx\ P) for all per.
But this means that if ?<a then it satisfies the defining property of t; 
in other words that t g t, which is impossible. Thus t, which is an initial 
segment of a, is actually equal to a, and so fi. is the function we are looking 
for. |
Let A be a class; M the class of all maps defined on ordinals, and taking 
values in A; and H a functional relation with domain M, and taking values 
in A. We can now define a unique functional relation F with domain On, 
and taking values in A, which for every ordinal a satisfies F(a) — H(F f a).
The functional relation y=F(a) is supplied by the formula ‘there is a 

ORDINALS, CARDINALS
19
map fa defined on a such that, for all /?< a,/a (/?)== #(/a f/?), an^ 
y=H(fay.
We have just proved that for each ordinal a there is a unique map fa 
of this sort, and this establishes that the relation just defined is afunctional 
relation with domain On.
To prove that F has the right values, take <a. Then=/a T /? simply 
because the latter map has all the properties defining/^. Thus
F(j8) = lT(4) = H(/arJ8) = /a(^)
for all /?<a. Manifestly then, /a=Fta; but F(a) = 7/(/a), so F(a) = 
= #W).
That F is the only such functional relation is proved in the same way 
as before. Suppose G is another, and let a be the least ordinal where 
F and G differ (if there is one). Since F(j}) = G(jj) for all /?<a we must 
have FT a = G T a, so H(F[ a) = H(G f a). Thus F(a) = G(a), a contra­
diction. It follows that F and G are equal for every ordinal a.
THE AXIOM OF CHOICE
The axiom of choice (AC for short) is the following assertion:
If a is a set of pairwise disjoint but non-empty sets, then there is a set 
whose intersections with elements of a are always singletons.
Spelt out more fully this becomes
Va {[Vx (x e a -> x 0)
a VxVy(x e a a y e a -> (x = y v x n y = 0))] 
-> S&VxBw (xea->&nx = {w})}.
Given the other axioms the following statements are equivalent to the 
axiom of choice.
AC': For any set a there is a function h mapping the set of all non-empty 
subsets of a into a in such a way that h(x} ex for all non-empty 
x c a.
AC": The Cartesian product of a family of non-empty sets is itself non­
empty.
AC' -> AC: Let Z> = |J a. We apply AC' to b. Every element x of a, 
being non-empty, is a non-empty subset of b. So take the function h that 
AC' guarantees, and consider {h(x) | x e a}. This set has exactly one ele­
ment from each xe a, and is the set needed to establish AC.

20
INTRODUCTION TO AXIOMATIC SET THEORY
AC 
Let (60l6j be a family ofnon-empty sets, and put 6;==
Then the family (Z>Jf6l consists throughout of pairwise disjoint non-empty 
sets. Let £ be a set with just one element in each b^i e Z). Then £ e ai9 
iel
by the definition of X-
AC" -> AC: Take any set a and form the product X x- By AC" this 
x <= a 
x ¥= 0
is not empty, so choose an element <p. It is easily checked that <p(x) e x 
for every non-empty subset x of a.
A further equivalent of the axiom of choice is the following statement.
Zermelo’S Theorem: Every set can be well ordered.
Proof: AC' follows at once from this. For take some r cz a2 that well­
orders a and define a map h: &(a)\{9} -> a by putting h(x) = the least 
element of x (mod. r).
Conversely, suppose that AC' is true and that the map
h:&(d)\{$} -> a 
satisfies the requirement that h(x) ex for every non-empty x cz a. Define 
a second map
g:0>(a)\{a} -> a 
by putting g(x)=h(a\x). Then this satisfies the requirement that 
g (x) $ x for any proper x cz a.
Let 0 be some object that is not an element of a (since the class of all 
sets is not itself a set, there is no difficulty about finding such a 0). We 
define by recursion a functional relation F: On av {0} by decreeing
F(a) =
9 ({^(0) | 0 < «}) 
(F(0) | 0 < <= «
(that is, if it is in the domain of g);
0 otherwise.
Suppose that F never takes the value 0; in other words, that F(a) e a for 
every ordinal a. Then {F(/3) | /?<«} is in g's domain, whatever ordinal 
a is. But F(a) cannot equal any F(/?) for /? <a, because
F(a) = g({F(fi) [/?<«})£ {F(JS) | p < a}
by the definition of g. Thus F is an injection; On is its domain, and all 
its values are in a. Inverting F, therefore, and using replacement, we can 

ORDINALS, CARDINALS
21
infer that On is a set. Since this is false we must conclude that F(a) is not 
always in a.
Thus F(a) = 0 for some ordinal a, and we may suppose a0 to be the 
least such. In this case F(fl) e a for every P <a0, and so {F(P) | P <a0} is 
a subset of a; yet it is not in the domain of g (since F(ao) = 0). By the 
definition of g9 {F(f) | P«Zq} can then only be a itself; so the range of 
Ft a0 is a.
But Ft a0 is also an injection; for if P<aQ9 F(p) = g({F(y) | y<P}) $ 
$ {F(y) | y < P}9 so that (as before) F(JJ) F(y) when y<p.
Thus F t a0 is a bijection from the ordinal a0 on to a9 and conse­
quently a can be well ordered. |
Note that what we have just proved can be stated as follows: whether 
or not AC holds, a set can be well ordered if and only if there is a map h: 
^(a)\{0) -> a for which h(x) ex for every non-empty x cz a.
Definition: If R is an ordering and T a subclass of the domain D of R9 
then an object x of D is called an upper bound (respectively, a strict upper 
bound) of Tif, for every y e T9 we have x^y (respectively, x>y), If Thas 
a strict upper bound we call it dominated. If the class of upper bounds of 
T has a smallest element under R9 then this element is called the least 
upper bound of T,
An object x in D is called a maximal element of D if there exists no 
greater element of D (under the ordering F).
We now prove yet another equivalent of the axiom of choice.
Zorn’S Lemma: Let u be an ordered system, every well-ordered subset of 
which has an upper bound. Then u has a maximal element.
Proof: Put u=<6Z, r> where r cz a2 is an ordering. Assuming the axiom 
of choice in the form AC' we have a map h\ ^(a)\{0} -> a for which 
h(x) ex for every non-empty x cz a.
Let c be the set of all dominated subsets of a (subsets with strict upper 
bounds). We define a map m from c into a by putting
m(x) = h (the set of strict upper bounds of x).
Then for x e c9 m(x) itself is a strict upper bound of x, and so m(x) cannot 
be a member of x.
Choose again some 0 which is not a member of a. As in the proof of 

22
INTRODUCTION TO AXIOMATIC SET THEORY
Zermelo’s theorem, we can define a functional relation F: On ->■ a u {0} 
as follows:
F(a) =
m{F(F)\0 <«} if {F(fl)\P<<x}ec;
0 otherwise (that is, if {F(J3) | /? < a}
has no strict upper bound or is not included in a).
Again we show that F must take the value 6 at least once. For, were it 
otherwise, and F(a) e a for every ordinal a, we would have {F(f>) | /? < a} e c 
for every ordinal a. Moreover, since F(a) dominates {F(/?) | <oc}, it 
cannot belong to this set, and so for /?<a, we get F(/?)/F(a). Thus Fis 
one-one; once more the scheme of replacement applied to F~l would 
deliver On as a set, and so we have a contradiction.
So let a0 be the least ordinal for which F(ao) = 0. Any smaller ordinal 
a will satisfy F(a) e a; and so {F(fl) | ft<a} e c; thus F(a) will be a strict 
upper bound to {F(/?) | and /?<a<a0 F(ft)<F(a) (mod.r). It 
follows that F f a0, which maps a0 one-one into a9 is also order­
preserving. Consequently {F(fi) | P<oc0} is going to be a well-ordered 
subset of a, and so by hypothesis it has an upper bound, d say. But it has 
no strict upper bound, for the existence of such an object would put 
{F(/?) | /?<a0} in c; and this would mean that F(a0)e6Z, contrary to 
supposition.
Thus there is no element of a that is greater than d (under the ordering 
r); and so d is the desired maximal element of a. |
Conversely, we can show that a seemingly weaker statement than Zorn’s 
lemma is sufficient to entail the axiom of choice.
Converse : Suppose that there is a maximal element in every ordered system 
whose linearly ordered subsets all have least upper bounds. Then the axiom 
of choice is true.
Proof : Let a be a set of non-empty pairwise disjoint sets; and let b = (J a. 
Put X equal to the set of all subsets of b which do not have more than one 
element in common with any x e a; then X is ordered by set inclusion.
Suppose Y is any linearly ordered subset of X, We shall show that Y 
has a least upper bound in X, Now the least upper bound of Y (under 
the c-ordering) is (J y: so we will show that IJ y e X, 
ye Y

than two elements. There are two cases to be considered. In the first, 
x n y = 0 for every y e Y; here we have at once x r\ (J y=0, and nothing 
yeY
remains to be proved. In the second, x n y is a singleton for one or more 
yeY. But however many yeY yield a singleton when intersected with x, 
it will always be the same singleton. For suppose x n y0={u} and x n y± = 
= {u}. Then since Y is linearly ordered, y0 u yt is one or the other of 
y0, yi> which means that x r\ (y0 u yx) = {w} u {u} is a singleton; and this 
means that u = v. It follows at once from all this that, in this second case, 
x n U y is itself a singleton, so that (J y e X9 as was required.

By supposition, then, X has a maximal element yQ. We claim that 
n x has exactly one element for each x e a. Were it otherwise, indeed, 
y0 n x would have to have no elements for some x e a (since >’o e X). In 
this case we could take any element of x and form the set j0 u {£}. This, 
however, would equally be in X, and would destroy y0’s maximality. |
CARDINALS
(In this section the axiom of choice will be used.)
Two sets a and b are termed equipollent (or equinumerous, or sometimes 
just equivalent) if there is a one-one map (a bijection) from a on to b.
It is to be observed that two sets a, b can be equipollent in an intuitive 
sense without being so according to this definition; for if A, B are the 
parts of the universe corresponding to a, b, there may be a bijection, in­
tuitively speaking, from A on to B. But unless this bijection itself corre­
sponds to an object of the universe there is no reason to suppose that a 
and b are therefore equipollent.
It is obvious enough that the relation ‘x is equipollent to y' is an 
equivalence relation whose domain is the class of all sets. With the axiom 
of choice, however, we can say more than this; namely that every set is 
equipollent to an ordinal. For if a set can be well ordered, it is certainly 
equipollent to the ordinal of its well-ordering.
The least ordinal equipollent to a set a9 written a, or sometimes 
card(a\ is called the cardinal of the set a. It is trivial that a and b are 
equipollent if and only if a = B.
We write Card for the class of all cardinals. It is defined by the formula

Cardfx): ‘a is an ordinal not equipollent to any smaller ordinal’.
Lemma: Let a be an ordinal and £ a subset of it. Then the ordinal of the 
well-ordering induced on £ by the ordering of a is less than or equal to a. 
Proof: Let fi be the ordinal in question, and /:£->/? the isomorphism 
between £ and /?. We show that for y e £, f(y)^y9 which immediately 
gives P <= a, and so p < a as required.
Suppose, on the contrary, that f(y)>y for some y e£. There will be 
a least such, y0. For y e £ we have then
7 < 7o -> f(y) < 7 < ?o;
and also
7 > 7o -» f(y) > f(y0) > 7o •
As in an earlier theorem,/clearly misses out on y0; but since it does take 
greater ordinals as values (for example,/(y0)>y0), it cannot after all 
have an ordinal for its range; and this contradicts the hypothesis. |
Theorem: Let a and b be non-empty sets. Then the following conditions are 
equivalent.
(1) There is a one-one map from a into b.
(2) There is a map from b on to a.
(3) a ^5.
Proof: ((1) -> (2)) Let j be an injection from a into b. We define a 
surjection s in the opposite direction as follows. Take any x0 in a, and 
let s'(y) be x0 for any y in b that is not in the range of j; and for elements 
y of b that are in the range of j we can take .s(y) as the inverse image of 
y under j, since j is one-one on its range.
((2) -> (1)) Conversely, suppose s: b -> a is a surjection. AC gives us 
a map h: 
b such that h(Y) e Yfor every non-empty Y c: b.
So for x e a we putj(x) = h({y g b \ s(y) = x}). This is manifestly one-one.
((3) -> (1)) If a < 5 we have two bijections/: a -> a and g: b -> and, 
since a <= 5, anidentityinjectionz:a -> b. Composing these into g~l 0 i°f9 
we produce what is clearly an injection from a into b.
((1) -> (3)) Suppose J: a b is an injection. Then, with / and g defined 
as above, the map g °j °f~1 is an injection k from a into 5. The range 
of k is some subset c 5 which, according to the previous lemma, is

isomorphic to some ordinal p^B. Thus a is equipollent with /?, and since 
it is a cardinal, a < /?; so a < B, |
Corollary (Cantor/Bernstein Theorem): For two sets a, b to be 
equipollent it is necessary and sufficient that there be injections from each 
one into the other.
Proof: For given the two injections we get at once a^B and 5^3, and 
thus a=5. |
(Although the axiom of choice was used in this theorem, and thereby 
in the proof of the corollary, it could, in the latter case, have been 
dispensed with.)
Theorem (Cantor) : For every set a, a <&(a).
Proof: Suppose that a^^(a); then there exists a map h from a on to 
0*(a), Let b = {x e a | x $ h(x)}, Then b cz a, so there is a c g a such that 
h(c) = b, But c e b is equivalent to c £ h(c)9 and this is equivalent to c $ b; 
and this is a contradiction. |
Note that in proving this we have also proved the following theorem. 
For neither it nor the next one do we need rely on AC,
Theorem: For no set a does there exist a map from a on to and, a 
fortiori, no injection of &(a) into a.
Theorem : The class of cardinals is not a set.
Proof: Suppose it were, x for example. Then x would be a set of ordinals 
with a least upper bound 2= IJ a. Since every ordinal is equipollent 
a e x
with some cardinal or another, every ordinal is equipollent with some 
subset of 2. Now let Y be the class of all well-orderings defined on subsets 
of 2. Every r e Y is a subset of A2; so Y(r) is equivalent to the formula 
rG^(A2) a T(r), which establishes that Y is a set (by the scheme of 
comprehension).
But every r in Y is associated with a unique ordinal (namely, the ordinal 
of the well-ordering r). Consequently, we can write down a functional 
relation performing this association, and the range of this functional 
relation is On, Since Y is a set, this contradicts the replacement scheme. |
Let a, b be two disjoint sets, and a', b' two more, respectively equipollent 

26
INTRODUCTION TO AXIOMATIC SET THEORY
with a and b. Then a kj b and a' u b' are equipollent too; for from the 
first to the second there is a bijection whose restrictions to a and b are 
just the given bijections from a to a' and from b to b'.
So let a, p be cardinals. There certainly exist disjoint sets a, b with these 
cardinalities, for we can, if we like, take a x {0} for a and p x {1} for b. 
Whatever disjoint a and b we actually choose, we define the cardinal sum 
a + P as the cardinal of a u b; it is easily seen that a + P is quite independ­
ent of the choice of a and b.
Amongst the properties easily proved to hold for cardinal addition are 
commutativity (a +/? = /? + a) and associativity (a+(p + y) = (a + /?)+y).
To get at cardinal multiplication we can drop the disjointness conditions 
on a, b and a', b’ that were imposed above. If/: a -> a’ and g: b bf are 
some appropriate bijections, then we can define a bijection h'.axb-* a' xb' 
by writing h«x,y» = </(%), 0(y)> for all xea and yeb; thus these 
Cartesian products are equipollent.
So if a, p are cardinals we define the (cardinal) product of a and p, 
written for brevity a/?, or a-/?, as the cardinal of a x /?. It should be clear 
that if a has cardinal a and b has cardinal P, then a x b has cardinal a/?.
If a, p, y are all cardinals we can easily check that the commutative 
(aP = Pa) and associative (a (Py) = (aP) y) laws of multiplication hold; there 
is no more difficulty involved in checking the distributive law (a(P + y) = 
= a/? + ay); we simply pick three sets, a, b, c, the latter two disjoint, and 
observe that a x (b u c)=(a x b) u (a x c).
More generally, let (at)fejr, (b^)ieI be families of sets each indexed by L 
Suppose that for every iel we have Then y^at and are 
ie I 
iel
equipollent. This is proved by noting that for any iel the set Bi of 
bijections from at on to bt is non-empty; by AC", therefore, the product 
of the family is not empty. So there is a family ((Pi)ieI of maps, each 
q>i being a bijection from at on to bt. We now define the required bijection 
from Xa» on to XX by associating each element (xi)ieI of the former set 
iel 
iel
with (<?>i(xi))iei in the latter.
If (ai)ieI is a family of cardinals we call the cardinal of the set Xa/ the 
iel
product of the family, and write it 
az. It is easily checked that this cardinal
i e I
is the cardinal of the Cartesian product of any family indexed by I 
and satisfying at=af for all i e L

Similar considerations for addition lead us to the following. Let (at)ie/ 
and be families as above which satisfy the further condition that 
i^j at r\ aj==bi n Z>7 = 0. Then |Jai and U^i are equipollent. As 
iel

before, we prove this with the axiom of choice, which supplies us with 
a family (cpt)ieI of maps, each cpt being a bijection of at on to Then if 
x e it can only be in one of the ai9 say ai(x), and so we can couple it 
iel
with epi (x) (x) in |J bb thus establishing the desired correspondence between 
iel
IJ^and IJ^i-

iel
Given any family of cardinals (az)feJ we can construct a family of 
disjoint sets which are equipollent to them for every iel, by 
writing a^o^x {/}. The cardinal of U^i, which is quite independent of 
iel
the choice of the disjoint family, is called the sum of the family (ai)iel9 
and written £ af.

To define exponentiation of cardinals, let a=a' and 5=5'. Then 
ba (the set of maps from b into a) is equipollent with b'a'. For suppose f: 
a -+ a' and g\b b' are appropriate bijections. Then to each <p e ba we 
can associate the map e b'a' defined by
= 
g"1 •
This clearly establishes a bijection between the two sets of maps.
So if a, p are cardinals, the cardinality of the set is called the ftth 
power of a, and written If a, b have cardinalities a, P respectively, it is 
easily checked that ba has cardinality
The usual laws of exponentiation for cardinals, that a^+y=a^. a7 and 
that (</)y = a^7 are easily established from this definition.
FINITE ORDINALS
(This section does not use the axiom of choice.)
We recall that the next greatest ordinal after a given ordinal a is its 
successor a u {a} (or a +1 for short; but this + is different from the + of 
cardinal addition above). If p is the successor of a we say that a is the 
predecessor of p.
An ordinal a is called finite if every P a (apart from 0) has a pre­
decessor. The formula ‘a is a finite ordinal’ is easily expanded into

28
INTRODUCTION TO AXIOMATIC SET THEORY
On(a) a Vp[On(p) a P cz a a /?00 -> 3y(/? = y u {y})]. Finite ordinals 
are also known as natural numbers. It should be obvious that if a is a 
finite ordinal and /?^a, then P is finite; and that if a is finite, so is a+1.
Mathematical Induction: Let P be a class such that P(0) is true, and for 
every finite ordinal a, P(a) -> P(a+1) is also true. Then P(f) is true for 
every finite ordinal a.
For if not, take the smallest finite ordinal a0 not in P. Since 0 is in P, 
ao0O. Thus it has a predecessor PQ, As a0 was the smallest finite ordinal 
not in P, we must have P(Pq)- We are given that P(/?o) -> P(Po +1). So 
P(a0)> which is impossible.
It is worth pointing out again that the definitions above of the words 
‘finite’ and ‘natural number’ are not intended to provide for them their 
usual senses. In future, therefore, everyday uses of the words will be 
explicitly recorded as such.
It is easily seen that what we would intuitively say was an ordinal a 
with a finite number of elements is indeed finite according to the 
above definition. But it could happen that a finite ordinal p had, intui­
tively speaking, infinitely many elements; in this case since p c a is ruled 
out, p would be greater than a. In addition, the part of the universe made 
up of these finite ordinals (in an intuitive sense) could not then be a class; 
for supposing P(x) to define the class, we would have ~iP(/?), and so 
could prove the existence of a least ordinal pQ for which -\P(Pq), Then 
if pQ were equal to y0 +1, we would have P(yo), showing that, intuitively 
speaking, y0 had finitely many elements; but with Po=yQ u {y0} this 
would hardly be possible.
Theorem : Every finite ordinal is a cardinal.
Proof: This is proved by induction. 0 is obviously a cardinal. So suppose 
that a is a finite ordinal which is a cardinal, whilst a+l = a u {a} is not. 
Then there must exist an ordinal y <a+1 and a bijection f from a+l on 
to y. As a +100, y cannot be 0; thus it is P u {/?} for some /?, and since 
y <a+1, we get P <a.
Were f (a) equal to /?,/ f a would map a one-one on to /, which would 
contradict the fact that a is a cardinal. So/ (a) = £ 0/, and as f is bijective 
f(ri)=P for some 77 e a+1; 0a, soy ea. We now define a map g which 

ORDINALS, CARDINALS
29
does map a one-one on to /?, by setting g(x)—f (x) for all x in a except 
for yi ; and g (?/) = £. Since a is a cardinal, we have a contradiction. |
We call a cardinal finite if it is a finite ordinal. Let us note the following 
consequence of the theorem above. If a is a finite ordinal, then its suc­
cessor a 4-1 is indeed the cardinal sum of a and 1. Thus within the domain 
of finite ordinals our notation is unambiguous.
Theorem : Ifa, P are finite cardinals, so too are a+P, off of.
Proof: Each proof is done by induction on /?. It is trivial that if a is finite 
and P is 0 then a + /Hs finite. Moreover, since a + (j8+l)=(a + j8)+l, a 
finite a + P means a finite a + (/? +1). This proves the first part.
The proof for multiplication is similar. Since 
l) = a/? + a, the
assumption that a/? is finite when a, P are, together with the previous 
result, yields at once that a(/?+1) is finite. Again, the identity a^+1 = a^-a 
supplies all that is needed to establish that of is finite. |
We are now in a position to state the one remaining axiom of Zermelo/ 
Fraenkel set theory.
5. AXIOM OF INFINITY
This axiom says, in effect, that there is an ordinal which is not finite.
On the strength of the axiom we write co (or, in some cases, N) for the 
first ordinal which is not finite. Thus co is the set of finite ordinals. For 
if a is a finite ordinal we do not have (which would make co finite); 
so, necessarily, a<co or, equivalently, aeco. Conversely, if ye co we 
have y <co, and so y is finite, by the definition of co.
Thus the axiom of infinity can be stated in the form: the class of finite 
ordinals is a set. For the class in question is an initial segment of On and 
so, if a set, is an ordinal co; but it is not a finite one, since no ordinal 
belongs to itself, and in particular co $ co.
An ordinal a 00 without a predecessor is called a limit ordinal; it is 
thus a non-zero ordinal for which 
Alternatively, a
non-zero ordinal a is a limit if and only if a=sup p= |J p.
0<a P<a
For if a is not a limit it is y 4-1, which means that sup /?=y. If it is a
limit, put sup j?=y; since y<a anyway, suppose y<a. By the definition 
p<a 

30
INTRODUCTION TO AXIOMATIC SET THEORY
of limit, then, y+1 <a, and so y is not the supposed supremum after all, 
since y-I-1 £y.
So another way of formulating the axiom of infinity is: there is a limit 
ordinal.
For, given the axiom, co could only have a predecessor if that predecessor 
were finite; which would make co finite too, directly contrary to its defini­
tion. Since a limit ordinal is necessarily not finite, the converse holds too.
A fourth way of expressing the axiom of infinity is by
Bx [0 e x a Vj'(y ex -> }' u {}'> ex)].
Given the axiom we can take co itself for x. Conversely, suppose the above 
sentence holds, and choose any a satisfying it. Let a be the least ordinal 
not in a. It cannot be 0, and if a = /? u {fi} we get <a; thus e a, so by 
the characterization of a, u {ft} ea, a contradiction. Thus a is not a 
successor either, so it must be a limit, which is all we need to prove.
INFINITE SETS AND INFINITE CARDINALS
(Unless otherwise stated, the axiom of choice will be 
allowed in this section.)
A set a is called finite if its cardinal is finite, infinite otherwise; if a < co, 
we say that a is denumerable.
Every infinite set includes an infinite denumerable subset (one, that is, 
equipollent with co).
For if a is infinite and f a bijection of a on to a, the range of f f co is 
a subset of a equipollent to co.
Theorem : A set a is infinite iff it is equipollent with one of its proper subsets. 
Proof: If a is finite, and b a proper subset, take x e a\b. The cardinality 
of a is certainly not zero, but it is finite, so of the form a +1 = a u {a}. 
There is no difficulty in finding some bijection f from a on to a u {a} 
which maps x to a; in this casef f b maps b one-one into a. Consequently 
B < a, so 5 <a, and b is not equipollent with a.
If a is infinite, a co. Writing f for some bijection from a on to a, we 
define an injection g from a into itself by setting
g (x) = x, if /(x) > co;
9 (x) = y , if /(x) < co and f(y) = /(x) + 1.

ORDINALS, CARDINALS
31
The range of g is a proper subset of a since it does not contain f 1(0); 
thus g is a bijection from a on to a proper subset. |
We will write Card' for the class of infinite cardinals; it is a subclass of 
On, but not a set (for then Card would be too, since co, the class of finite 
cardinals, is a set). So Card' is just a well-ordered class, and therefore 
there must be a functional relation y = K(a) establishing an isomorphism 
between On and Card'. For simplicity we write the infinite cardinal 
K(a) as Ka; the relation y = Ka then abbreviates ‘y is an infinite cardinal, 
and the set of infinite cardinals that are less than y is isomorphic, as a 
well-ordered set, to a’.
We have Ko = co; and, for each a, Ka+1 is the first cardinal > Ka.
Ifa is a limit ordinal,^ a= (J
0<a
To show that (J is a cardinal, suppose that y< (J so 
0<a 
0<a
y e (J so y e for some <a. Thus y cz giving 
P<a
cz (J Kjj, 
P<a
since a is a limit ordinal.
This proves that (J ^>7 and that there is no bijection from |J 
P<a 
0<a
on to any smaller ordinal y.
Since this cardinal |J for all /?<a, it is also >Ka. But con- 
0<a
versely cz Ka for all /? <a, so (J cz Ka, and this proves the result. 
0<a
By Cantor’s theorem we have 2K“>Xa+1, since 2K“ is the cardinal of 
^(Xa).
The continuum hypothesis (CH) is the sentence 2Ko=X1; alternatively, 
^(co) can be so well ordered that every strict initial segment is denumerable.
To show that this second formulation entails the first (the converse is 
clear), note that the ordinal of such a well-ordering could not in any case 
be denumerable, since, by Cantor’s theorem, ^(<u) is not. By the speci­
fication of the well-ordering, it follows that the ordinal in question is 
the first non-denumerable ordinal, that is Xi.
The generalize d continuum hypothesis (GCH) is the sentence: 2K“ = Xa+1 
for every ordinal a.

32
INTRODUCTION TO AXIOMATIC SET THEORY
Write On2 for the class of all ordered pairs of ordinals <a, /?>. On this 
class we can define a well-ordering relation R as follows:
<a, /?> <y, (5> (mod. 7?) if and only if 
sup (a, p)< sup(y, 5)
v sup (a, P) = sup(y, <5) a a < y
v sup (a, p) = sup (y, 5) a a = y a /? < 5.
Every segment is seen to be a set. For if S^(R) is an initial segment, 
and £ = <a0, and <a, py < <a0, Pq) (mod. R), then
sup (a, p) < sup(a0, p0).
Putting y0 = sup(a0, p0), we note that every pair <a, py in S^(R) is a 
member of the set (y0 +1)2; so S%(R) is a subclass of that set, and thus 
a set itself.
On the other hand, take a non-empty set X all of whose elements are 
in On1; the set of all sup(a, P) for <a, py e X has a smallest element y0; 
the set of all a such that for some p we have both <a, py e X and 
sup(a, p)=y0 has a smallest element a0; and the set of p for which 
sup(a0, P) = yQ and <a0, py e Xhas a least element PQ.
From all this it drops out that <a0, pQy is the least element of X (mod. 
R); and so 7? is a well-ordering.
Since On2 is therefore a well-ordered class, but not a set, a relation 
y = «7(a, P) can be found which establishes an isomorphism between On2 
and On. In the definition of J, be it noted, there is no need for the axiom 
of choice.
Theorem : For each ordinal a, K* — Ka.
Proof: If the theorem is false, it fails first at some ordinal p. To obtain 
a contradiction we need only show that Kp • Kp < Kp, since there is no 
trouble with Kp > Kp. Restricting J to Kp x Kp we get a one-one map, and 
so the proof reduces to showing that for a, P e Kp, J(a, P) e Kp.
Now J(a, P)e^p<-> J(a, p)<Kp, so, Kp being a cardinal,
J(a, p)eXp^7^)<Xp.
So if we prove that J(a, P) <Kp for a, P e Kp, we are finished.
Since J(a, P) is the set of ordinals less than J(a, p), it is the range of J 
restricted to the set of all <a', /?'> less than <a, py (mod. R). Writing y

for sup(a, fi), we easily see that this latter set is included in (y +1)2 (since 
<a',/?>-> a'<y+l a )8'<y+l). Thus its cardinal cannot 
exceed the cardinal of (y + 1)2; but as y<Kp, so is y+1, and therefore 
by the definition of p there are just two cases: y +1 is finite, or
(y + l)2 = y+l <KP. 
Each case separately yields J(a, /?)<KP, and so the theorem is proved. |
Corollary: K”=Ka/or every natural number n^l, and every ordinal a. 
Proof: Immediate, by induction on n. |
Corollary : Ka • = sup(Xa, K^).

An isomorphism between the class of finite sequences of ordinals and On: 
(To establish this we do not need the axiom of choice.)
For a class C, a finite sequence s of objects of C is, by definition, a map 
whose domain is a natural number, and whose values are in C, This 
natural number, the domain, is otherwise called the length of the sequence, 
and is written l(s). We write a(C) for the class of all finite sequences of 
objects of C.
An ordering R can be defined on a(Orif the class of finite sequences of 

34
INTRODUCTION TO AXIOMATIC SET THEORY
ordinals, by setting
set (mod. R) if and only if 
sup(s) < sup(t) v 
sup(s) = sup(t) a l(s) < Z(t) v 
sup(s) = sup(t) A l(s) = l(t) A S A 
s(n) < t(n) for the first n where 
s (n) 
t(n).
(Here sup(s) stands for the greatest value taken by the function s.)
We show that R, defined in this way, is a well-ordering. This involves, in 
the first place, that the class St(^) of sequences <t (mod. R) be a set; but 
since everything in this class is also in the set a(y +1) for y = sup(z), this is 
easily proved.
So let X be a non-empty set of finite sequences of ordinals. As s ranges 
over X9 sup(^) takes on various ordinals as values, and of these there 
must be a least, y say. Amongst the sequences s in X for which sup(^)=y, 
there will be at least one of minimal length, of length n say. Now define 
recursively a map f with domain n as follows: if i e «,/(/)=the smallest 
ordinal of the form s(i) for seX satisfying supfs) = y, l(s) = n9 and 
s( for every; < z.
Now f9 as thus defined, is a member of X9 and, further, sup(/) = y and 
/(/) = «. For it is immediate, by induction on z, that for every i^n 
there is an s e X for which sup(.s)=y, l(s} = n9 and s f i=f f z; whence, 
putting i=n9 the result. Moreover,/is the smallest element of X. For take 
some s in X, distinct from /. If sup (s) / y we must have sup (s)>y = sup (/), 
by the definition of y. Thus s>f. If supfs) = y, however, and l(s)^n9 
we have in the same way Z(.y)>« = /(/); and so s>f. Finally, if sup(s)=y 
and l(s) = n9 let i <n be the first integer where s(i) f (z). By the definition 
of/, s(f)> f (z), so once more£>/.
But a well-ordered class that is not a set is isomorphic to On; and there 
is consequently a functional relation s = J(a) which establishes an iso­
morphism between On and a (On}.

CHAPTER III
THE AXIOM OF FOUNDATION
The axiom of foundation (/IF for short) is the sentence
Vx [x t6 0 -> 
(>’ e x a y r\ x = 0)] ;
in other words, the axiom states that every non-empty set has an element 
which is disjoint from it.
From the axiom it follows that there is no infinite sequence (that is, 
no map with domain co) (wn)neco for which un+l e un for all neco; for if x 
were the set of terms of such an infinite descending sequence (its range, 
in other words), it would fail to contain an element disjoint from itself.
In particular, therefore, the axiom implies that for every x, x £ x; and, 
more generally, that there are no e-cycles - finite sequences x0,..., xn_t 
that is, satisfying x0 ext e ... exw_1 e x0. For, again, the set {x0,..., xn-i} 
would contradict AF,
We can take advantage of the axiom to provide a more simple definition 
of ordinals than the one given earlier. This is established in the following 
theorem.
Theorem: For X to be an ordinal it is necessary and sufficient that the two 
conditions
YuYv [u e X a veX -> (uev v u = v v v 6 u)] 
and
Yu [u e X u cz X] 
be satisfied. 
Proof: The necessity of both conditions is immediate. Conversely, we 
note first that e imposes a strict linear order on any X satisfying them. 
For by AF we cannot have u e v and v e u together; moreover, when u 
v, w e X, and u e v and v e w, the possibility u=w is ruled out (for then 
u e v and v e w), and the possibility w e u is ruled out (for then we get the 
cycle u e v e w e w); and so by the first condition all that is left is u e w.
To show that this ordering is a well-ordering, we take any non-empty 
Y cz X\ by AF there is some u e Y satisfying u n T=0. But this means

that if v g Y then v $ u9 and therefore that u is the desired least element 
(mod. g) of Y. |
Without necessarily supposing the axiom of foundation to hold in the 
universe we can define by recursion a functional relation y—Vx by 
Setti"g Ko = 0;
V.- U ^(r,).
0<a
It is clear enough from this that a^a' Va cz Va,. Consequently, since 
Pa+1 = U we have Kx+i — ^(y<x)for every ordinal a.
On the other hand, for limit a we have p<a->p+l<a, so 
Pa = U 
U ^+i= U Vp for every limit ordinala.
P<ct 
fi<a 
P<ct
The class of all elements of some Va or another is called V; it is defined 
by the formula Y(x): Ba (On (a) a x g Pa).
For any x in V we define the rank of x, rn(x), as the least ordinal a for 
which xe Va. Since for limit a we have xe Va -> xe IJ Vfi9 rn(x) is 
always a successor, of the form p +1. 
fi<a
Lemma : A set a is in V iff all its elements are; if rn(a)=a, then every element 
of a has rank <a.
Proof: Suppose a is in V9 and its rank is a=/?+l. Then ae Vfi+19 so 
a cz Thus all a’s elements are in V; moreover, their ranks are all
/?, and so <a. Conversely, suppose that every element of x is in V. The 
ranks of these elements form a set, and so must be bounded above by 
some ordinal a. It follows that a cz Va, whence a e Va+i; thus a is in V. |
Theorem : Every ordinal a is in V, and the rank of a is a+1.
Proof: If there is one, let a be the first ordinal for which a $ Va+l; then
P e a -> P e P^+1, and so

fi<a
from which a g Va+1, contrary to hypothesis.
Likewise, let a be the first ordinal, if there is one, such that a g Va. Then 
a g (J ^(Vp), so a is in &(Vp) for some P <a. But then a cz Vp, and since 
P<a
P g awe obtain P e Vfi9 in contradiction to the definition of a. |

THE AXIOM OF FOUNDATION

Theorem: The axiom of foundation holds if and only if V is the whole 
universe; or, briefly, AF <-> VxK(x).
Proof: Supposing VxF(x) to hold, we pick a non-empty set #, and from 
its elements pick some set b of minimum rank a. Then 6’s elements all 
have rank <a, and so cannot themselves be in a. Thus b n a=0, as 
required for AF.
The converse is most easily proved by defining the transitive closure 
of a set as follows. Recall that a set X is transitive if VxVy [x e X a y ex
ye X]. The transitive closure of X is defined as the most restricted (that 
is, smallest under the order <=) set <£(X) which is transitive and includes 
X. That this definition is a correct one is established by the theorem which 
we interpose here.
Theorem: For any set X there exists a unique transitive set Y which includes 
X and is itself included in every transitive set including X.
Proof : We define a map/on co by recursion:/ (0)=X\f (n +1) = U *• 
x e f(n)
Let y= IJ f(rif Then it is obvious that X <= T; and further, Y is 
neo
transitive. For if x e Y, then xef(n) for some n e co, so x <= f (n +1), so 
x <= Y. Now if Z is a transitive superset of X, we prove by induction that 
every f(n)<a Z; w = 0 is immediate; if xe f (n) c: Z, x e Z, so x cz Z, 
because Z is transitive; therefore / (n +1) = (J x cz Z as required.
X e f(n)
This completes the inductive step, and we can conclude that
r=U/(«) = ^.| 
n e co
Returning to the stranded theorem, suppose that AF holds, but that 
some object a is not in K Let b be a transitive set including a, and b' the 
set of elements of b that are not in V.
Then b' is non-empty; for a is not in V, so has an element x0 not in F; 
and since a c b, x0 is also in b'.
But for every x e b' we also have b' n x non-empty. For if x e b', it is 
not in V, so has an element y not in V. Since y e x e b, and b is transitive, 
y e b; and thus y e b', by the definition of b'. But then y e b' n x, which 
therefore cannot be empty.
Thus b' contradicts AF, and the theorem is established. |
Let us note one property of transitive closures.

Well-founded Relations and Extensional Relations: Let r be a binary relation 
on a set a (so r cz a2); r is said to be well founded on a if for every non­
empty X c: a there exists an x e X such that <y, x> e r holds for no 
y e X, It should be clear that if b cz a9 the restriction r n b2 of r to b is 
well founded on b.
A map <p with domain a is called collapsing for r if for all x e a we have
<p00 = {^(y) I y e a A <y> x>s r} ■
Evidently, if cp is collapsing the range of cp is a transitive set, since each 
element of cp(x)9 for x e a, is of the form cp(y).
Theorem: If r is a well-founded relation on a there exists one and only one 
map with domain a which collapses for r. Moreover, the range of this map 
is in the class V.
Proof: (Uniqueness) Let q>, if/ be two such collapsing maps, and write X 
for {xea | (p(x)^il/(x)}. If (p^i//9 X must be non-empty, so there will 
be an xoeX for which Vy e X«y, x0> ^r). Since xQeX9 we have 
<p(x0) ^*A(x0), and so without loss of generality we can assume a u that 
is in (p(xQ) but not in i/<(x0). Now cp is collapsing, so there is a y e a for 
which <p(y) = w and <y, x0> e r. By the specification of x0> J cannot be 
in X; so ^(y) = ^(y) = w. But i// collapses too, so from il/(y) = u and 
<y, x0> e r we get w e iA(xo), which is a contradiction.
(Existence) A subset Z of a is called r-transitive if x e Z a <y, x) e r 
ye Z. Clearly if (p has domain a and is collapsing for r then (p f Z is 
collapsing for r n Z2 when Z is an r-transitive subset of a. If Z, Z' are

lapsing maps with domains Z,Z' respectively, £ f Z n Z'and#' fZnZ' 
are also collapsing maps, both with domain Z n Z'; and so, by the 
uniqueness part of the theorem, they are identical.
So let cp be the union of all the collapsing maps £ that are defined on 
any r-transitive subset of a. From our discussion above it follows that cp 
is also a map, and that its domain Y is also an r-transitive subset of a 
(since it is the union of a set of r-transitive subsets).
Now (p is obviously collapsing; and so Ymust be the largest r-transitive 
subset of a which is the domain of a collapsing map.
Is Y equal to a itself? If not, take some xoea\Y such that 
Vy ea\F«y, x0> ^r); that such an x0 would exist under these con­
ditions follows at once from the well-foundedness of r on a. We now 
define a map on f u {x0} such that and cp are identical on Y and 
^(xo)“{<P(jO I >’e A 
(this definition is a correct one
since <y, x0> e r y e F).
But now it falls out at once that Y u {x0} is an r-transitive subset of a 
and that ip is collapsing. And this is impossible, since the domain of 
ij/isYu {x0}, which properly includes Y.
Consequently Y—a\ and cp is a collapsing map with domain a.
It remains to show that rng((p) is in V9 or, what is the same thing, that 
all its elements y are. Suppose otherwise, and put X= {x e a | 
F(<p(x))};
X is then non-empty. As r is well founded there must be an x0 e X such 
that Vy e X«y, x0) r). Thus “i K(<p(x0)), which means that there is 
awe <p(x0) such that F(w).
On the other hand, as cp is collapsing, there exists a y e a such that 
<p(y) = w and <y, x0>er. Thus y$X9 in view of the choice of x0; so 
K(<p(y)), so F(w); and this contradicts the conclusion of the previous 
paragraph. |
A binary relation r on a set a is called extensional if, whatever elements x, 
y may be of w, if Vz e a[<z, x> e r <z, y> e r] then x=y; or, more 
succinctly, if the set a, together with the relation r, satisfies the axiom of 
extensionality.
A set a is called extensional if the membership relation is extensional 
on a; that is, ifx n a=y c\a x=y for any x,yinw.
Observe that every transitive set is extensional; for if a is a transitive 
set and x e a then x n a=x.

INTRODUCTION TO AXIOMATIC SET THEORY
Theorem: Let r be an extensional relation which is well founded on a. Then 
there exists a unique isomorphism from a, together with the binary relation 
r, on to a transitive set (together with the membership relation); and this 
transitive set is in V.
Proof : Any isomorphism such as that required by the theorem is evidently 
a collapsing map; and so by the previous theorem we have uniqueness. 
To prove that there is any such isomorphism at all, we consider that one 
map (p defined on a which collapses for r, and show that it fills the bill. 
Let b be the range of cp; we have already seen that b is transitive and in V.
Firstly, (p is injective. For otherwise there would be an element d of 
b of minimal rank for which there were two inverse images x, y e a; that 
is to say, x, yea, x^y, and <p(x) = <p(y) = d. As x, y are distinct and r is 
extensional, we can assume, without loss of generality, that we have some 
u e a for which <w, x> e r and <w, y) $ r. The former yields <p(u) e <p(x) - 
since cp is collapsing; so <p(w) e <p(y) too. Thus for some v e a we have 
<rj>er and <p(u) = <^(w); and as <w, y)$r, we also have v?£u. But 
cp (u) = cp (v) e d, whence cp (w), cp (y) are of rank less than d, in contradiction 
to the definition of d.
Secondly, <y, x> e r -> cp(y) e cp(x), since cp is collapsing. And lastly, 
the converse of this is proved as follows. If cp(y) e <p(x) then there is a z e a 
such that <z, x> e r and (p(z) = cp(y) (since cp is a collapsing map). But 
cp is also injective, so z—y. Thus <y, x> e r.
This concludes the proof that cp is indeed an isomorphism. |
Note that this theorem is a generalization of the theorem on pp. 16f. For 
if r is a strict well-ordering on a it is easily seen to be both extensional and 
well founded. What is more, the range set of the collapsing isomorphism 
is transitive and well ordered by e; an ordinal, no less.
The following corollary is proved with the help of the axiom of founda­
tion. It will be used in Chapter VIII.
Corollary: Every extensional set is isomorphic, under a unique isomor­
phism, to a transitive set.
Proof: Let a be extensional, and r the restriction of the membership rela­
tion to a; thus r = {<x, y) e a2 | xey}. It follows at once from AF that 
r is well founded; it is extensional, by hypothesis; and so the theorem 
above gives the result. |

THE AXIOM OF FOUNDATION

THE HEREDITARILY FINITE SETS
A set a is called hereditarily finite if it is in or, in other words, if it is 
in Vn for some natural number n. Without having to use the axiom of 
choice we are able to define a functional relation without parameters that 
maps V& one-one on to co.
Lemma: If n is a natural number, "{0, 1} is equipollent with a unique natural 
number.
Proof: The uniqueness is trivial since no natural number is equipollent 
with any ordinal apart from itself. The rest is a simple induction on n. 
Given that "{0, 1} is equipollent with k, say, "+1{0, 1} is equipollent with 
k x {0, 1}, and thus with 2k. And that is all. |
We now define recursively on the natural numbers a sequence of 
bijections cpn from Vn on to a natural number vn. For w = 0, cpn = 9. So 
suppose that we are presented with <pn: Vn vn; our object is to define 
<Pn + l* Vn + 1 ^n + 1*
In terms of cpn we can define a bijection i//n: ^(Vn) -» ”n{0, 1} (that is, 
from K+i on to ”n{0, 1}) by
^(^)(i) = l if
^„(X)(0 = O if
whereX c Fnand0^z<r„.
But ”n{0, 1} is a set of finite sequences of ordinals, binary sequences in 
fact (that is, the only ordinals appearing are 0, 1), of length vn. It is thus 
well ordered by the relation R(x, y) defined on a (On) on pp. 33f. By the 
lemma, the ordinal isomorphic to this well-ordering is some natural 
number vn+1. Thus we get our bijection <pn+1 from Vn+1 on to vn+1 by 
writing cpn+l=H(cpn), where cp' = H((p) is the relation ‘Where u is the 
domain of cp and v the range, cp' is that map from 0>(u) which is composed 
of the following two maps: the map i/s: 0>(u) -> ”{0, 1} developed from 
cp, and the unique isomorphism from v{0, 1} (as well ordered by R) on to 
its ordinal’. This relation is determined by a parameter-free formula, and 
so the functional relation defined on co is also void of parameters.
So we have a parameter-free functional relation n rn which associates 
with each natural number n a well-ordering rn on Vn (rn is the inverse image 
under cpn of the well-ordering of vn). We can now define a well-ordering r 

42
INTRODUCTION TO AXIOMATIC SET THEORY
on Vm by setting x <y (mod. r) iff
rn(x) < rn(y) v [rn(x) = rn(y) = n a x < y(mod. rw)] .
Every initial segment under r is isomorphic to a natural number; for the 
set of r-predecessors of x0 is a subset of Vn where n is rn(x0); and so its 
ordinal is finite.
This shows that the well-ordering r on V„ is isomorphic to the well­
ordering of co; and the isomorphism K between co (ordered by member­
ship) and the well-ordered system <7^, is the functional relation sought, 
since it has been defined without parameters.
RELATIVIZED FORMULAS
Let X be some class, and E(x0,..., xw_j) some formula in (at most) the 
variables x0,x„_19 whose parameters are all objects of X. We write 
Ex(x09xn_t) for the relativization of the formula E to X, namely that 
formula defined in the following way by (informal) recursion on the length 
of E. (Since the formulas are not objects of the universe, there is no 
question here of a recursion on the integers of the universe, but one on 
intuitive objects.)
(1) 
E is of the form x e y, x = y, x e a, x = a, a e x, a = x, 
a e b, a = b (a, b, objects of X). E is in this case called 
atomic, and is its own relativization.
(2) 
Eis-iF; then Ex is -1 Fx.
(3) 
E is F v G; then Ex is Fx v Gx.
(4) 
E is 3x7 (x, x0,..., xw_t);
then Ex is 3x [X(x) a Fx(x, x0, ..., xw_t)] .
It follows at once from (2) and (4) that if E is VxF(x, x0,..., xrt_t) - that 
is, at length, ~i3x~iF(x, x0,..., x^-J - then Ex is Vx[X(x) -> Fx(x, x0, 
•••» ^n —1)1*
Note that if the class X qualifies as a set, then the relation X(x) takes 
the form x e X.
Consider any n objects a0,..., 6Zw_t of the class X. Then it is apparent 
that the formula Ex(a0,..., an-i) is true in the universe iff the formula 
E(a0,..., an-i) is true in the class X (augmented by the binary relation 
e f X). As an example, a set X is extensional if and only if the formula Ex 
is true (in the universe), where E itself is one form of the axiom of

RELATIVE CONSISTENCY OF THE AXIOM OF FOUNDATION
In this section we shall show that the deployment of the axiom of founda­
tion cannot of itself lead to contradiction within ZF9 by assuming a 
model for ZF - that is, a universe - and from it constructing a model 
for ZF+AF\ this latter model will be a set (in the intuitive sense), 
augmented by a binary relation, for which all the ZF axioms hold, and 
the axiom of foundation too. More precisely, we show that if ZF has a 
model, so also has ZF+AF\ this is what is meant by relative consistency. 
In fact, if % is a universe, then the ZF axioms and the axiom of foundation 
all hold in the class V constructed within Ql.
This amounts to proving that for each axiom A of ZF+AF, Av holds 
in
Axiom of Extensionality: If x, y are in F, so too are all their members; 
so if they have the same members in F, they have the same members all 
told. Thus x=y9 since the axiom of extensionality holds in
Union Axiom: If x is in V9 anything in (Jx is obviously also in F, so by 
the lemma on p. 36, IJX itself is in V.
Power-set Axiom: If x is in V and y e ^(x), then y <= x, and so all y’s 
elements are in F; thus y is too, and by the same lemma, ^(x) belongs 
to V.
Scheme of Replacement: Let a be a set in F, and R(x9 y) some formula 
(whose parameters are in V) which, within the class V9 defines a functional 
relation. Clearly this functional relation is defined in W by the formula 
V(x) a V(y) a Rv (x9 y)'9 since replacement holds in <%9 we can apply it 
to this functional relation, and obtain in a set b made up of the images 
of a under it. Since everything in b is in V9 b itself must be, and the proof is 
complete.

INTRODUCTION TO AXIOMATIC SET THEORY
Axiom of Infinity: Every ordinal is in V, co in particular. Since 0 e co a 
a Vx[x e co -> x u {x} e co], the axiom of infinity holds in V.
Axiom of Foundation: Take a non-empty set a in K Let b be some element 
of a of minimal rank. But every element of b is of lower rank than b, 
and therefore cannot appear in a. Thus b n a=0.
This proof of relative consistency - like all others - can be looked at 
from a different angle. Without reference to models, we can treat the 
theory ZF as a formal system, in the sense that its axioms and, more 
generally, its parameter-free formulas are regarded as mere finite 
sequences of symbols. The rules of inference (which need not be spelt 
out here, but can be found in [4] for example) are then formal rules 
allowing the derivation of certain finite sequences from certain others. 
A proof is just a finite sequence of formulas Ao,..., An_19 each of which, 
if not an axiom, is derivable from earlier formulas in the sequence by 
one of the rules of inference. A theorem of the theory is any sentence 
which is the last formula of some proof, and the theory is called consistent 
(or non-contradictory) if and only if 0 / 0 is not a theorem.
The relative consistency of the axiom of foundation can then be ex­
pressed as: if 0/0 is not a theorem of ZF, then it is not a theorem of 
ZF+AF We can prove this straightforwardly by supposing a proof of 
0/0 in ZF+AF, say the sequence Xo,..., An_2, 0/0, and constructing 
from it a proof of 0 / 0 in ZF alone.
To do this we note that every parameter-free sentence E which we have 
shown to hold in any universe % has in effect been proved from the 
axioms of ZF by means of the formal rules of inference. We can thus 
consider the sequence of relativized formulas Af,..., A^2, (0/0)r. If 
A i is an axiom of ZF, we have just shown that A? is a theorem of ZF, Thus 
this sequence furnishes a proof in ZF of (0/0)F, and therefore one of 
(0/0) itself.
We give two more simple examples of relative consistency proofs.
CONSISTENCY OF THE NEGATION OF THE AXIOM OF INFINITY
We shall show here that if ZF is consistent then so also is the theory T 
obtained by striking out the axiom of infinity from the list of axioms, and 

THE AXIOM OF FOUNDATION

admitting its negation in its place. In fact, if % is a universe, the set Va 
(together with the membership relation) satisfies every axiom ofT.
Since is a transitive set, the extensionality axiom automatically holds. 
To show the union axiom holds, take aeV^; for some neco, then, 
a e Vn, in which case (Ja cz Vn for sure, so (Ja e 7n+1. Thus 
e
Likewise, every subset of a is in 7b+1, so that 0(a) <= Vn+1, which gives 
0>(a) e Vn+2; and this shows that the power-set axiom holds.
Let a be in Vm9 and take an arbitrary formula jR(x, y) with parameters 
in which, interpreted in V^, defines a functional relation. In then, 
the functional relation can be defined as x e a y e VC) a RV(O(x,y) 
- indeed, since its domain is a set, this functional relation is a map f 
with values in Let <p: a -> co assign to each element x of a the rank 
of f (x); then since a c: Vn for some n e co, a is equipollent with a finite 
ordinal, and so the values of <p are all less than some natural number k. 
Thus Z>, the set of images of members of a under fi is a subset of Vk, and so 
b e Vk+l as desired.
But the axiom of infinity fails in VM. For suppose that a is a set, that 
0 e a, and that if x e a so is x u {x}. Then every n e co is in a, so that 
co cz a. But an element of V„ cannot have co as a subset since it is 
bound to be equipollent to some finite ordinal. Thus no such a is in V„.
CONSISTENCY OF THE AXIOM OF ACCESSIBILITY
In this section we suppose that the axiom of choice holds in the universe
A cardinal 2 is called (strongly) inaccessible if it has the following three 
properties:
(1) 2>co;
(2) If ft is a cardinal <2, then <2;
(3) If is a family of cardinals less than 2, indexed by a 
cardinal 7<2, then sup & <2.
iel
A cardinal that is not inaccessible is called accessible. Note that nothing 
prevents a cardinal less than an accessible cardinal from being inaccessible; 
for example, if 2 is inaccessible, 2A, though strictly greater than 2, is 
accessible.
Lemma : If 2 is an inaccessible cardinal then Vk=2; a set a is in V^iffa cz Vx

INTRODUCTION TO AXIOMATIC SET THEORY
Proof: Since A c Vx we certainly have Fa>A. To obtain the reverse 
inequality we first show that if a<A then Fa<A. So let a be the first 
ordinal <A, if there is one, for which We have Va— (J 
... 
— 
0<a
< Z = sup 2F^), by the corollary on p. 33. But if /?<a, 
j}<oi 
0<a
then F^<A by the definition of a, and so since A is inaccessible. 
For the same reason, the supremum of the family of cardinals (2Vf))p < a, 
being indexed by a<A, must be less than A. Thus Va is not greater in 
cardinality than the supremum of two cardinals each strictly <A; so
Va < A, which contradicts our assumption about a.
So Fa<A for all a<A, which means that FA= sup Fa^A, and so 
--  
a< A
Ifae Vi thenae K.soa c K for some a<2, so a < V,; thus a<2.
Conversely, suppose a <= Vx and a <A. The map x -> rn(x) defined on a 
is a family of cardinals each less than A, indexed by a set a whose cardinal 
is also less than A. Thus the least upper bound of the family is some 
cardinal Kp < A.
So for every x e a, rn(x)<Kp, and therefore rn(x)<Kp+1 =y. Thus 
a <= Vr But y=Kp+1 < 2Kp < A. Consequently a e |
If A is inaccessible then in Vx hold all the axioms of ZF, together with AF 
and AC.
It is easy to check that the axioms of extensionality, union, power-set, 
foundation, and infinity are satisfied.
For the axiom of choice, let a e Vx be a family of disjoint non-empty 
sets. Then (since AC is here imagined to hold in <) there is a set b <= |J a 
whose intersection with each x e a is a singleton. Since a c: Va for some 
a<A, b <= Va too, so b e Va+19 so b e Vx.
For the replacement scheme we take a e FA, and pick any formula 
7?(x, j), with parameters in Vx only, that within Vx defines a functional 
relation. Within % the functional relation is defined by the formula 
x e Vx a y e Vx a Rv*(x, y). As its domain is a set, it corresponds to

some map /, and the range of f is a set b cz 
Since trivially B < a < 2, it
follows that b e Vx.
The axiom of accessibility ACC denies the existence of inaccessible 
cardinals: All cardinals are accessible.
We can prove the relative consistency of ACC (relative, that is, to 
ZF+AC) as follows. Take a universe % where AC holds. Either ACC 
does too - in which case nothing needs to be proved - or there is an in­
accessible cardinal in the first such being n say. Then, by the above, 
Vn satisfies ZF+ AF+ AC. We shall see that it satisfies ACC too.
The ordinals ofVn are the ordinals <rc.Forifais an ordinal of Vn9 it is a 
transitive element of Vn linearly ordered by e. But then it is an ordinal in 
since it must be in Vn it is an ordinal less than n.
The cardinals ofVn are the cardinals <n. If a is a cardinal <n9 we have 
a e Vn; and within Vn there is no one-one map of a on to a smaller ordinal, 
since there is not one even in % itself. Thus a is a cardinal of Vn.
Conversely, if a <n is not a cardinal we can map it by some bijection f 
on to a smaller ordinal y. So f <= axy, so / cz ax a; thus/eFa+3. 
Consequently f e Vn and there is in Vn a bijection from a on to y, which 
proves that a is not a cardinal of Vn.
So let a be a cardinal <rc; by the definition of n it is accessible in 
and so one of (1), (2), (3) above must fail for a. Therefore one of the 
following holds.
(T) a co; here a must be accessible in Vn.
(2') There is a cardinal /?<a for which 2^a; then e Vn9 
2P e Vn9 and so a is accessible in Vn.
(3') a^ (J fii9 where Z is a cardinal less than a and every fit is 
id
likewise a cardinal <a. The map i fit is a subset of Zxa 
and therefore of a x a; so it belongs to Vn. Thus a is accessible 
inK-
This suffices to establish that the axiom of accessibility holds in Vn.

CHAPTER IV
THE REFLECTION PRINCIPLE
Let X be a class and E(x0,..., a formula with all parameters 
confined to X. We shall say that X mirrors the formula E (or is a mirror 
for E) if, for arbitrary #0,ak_1 in X, E holds if and only if Ex also 
holds. That is, ‘the class Xmirrors the formula E’ is none other than
Vx0...VxJt_1[X(x0) A ... A X(xft_1)
-* (E(x0,..., Xfc-i) **Ex(x0,Xfc-t))].
Note that if E is quantifier-free then Ex is E itself, and so any class 
whatever is a mirror.
A formula E is said to be prenex (or in prenex normal form) if it is 
Ar0N1...7Vr_1E', where each Nt either is “1 or is 3 followed by some 
variable x, and E' is free of quantifiers. For prenex formulas E, F we say 
that F is a truncation of E if it is obtained from the latter by removing 
some of the "Ts and 3x’s at the beginning. So if E is NQN1...Nr^1E/9 for 
some p > 0 the formula Fis of the form NpNp+1 ...N^E'.
It is well known, and will not be proved here, that every formula A 
is equivalent to a prenex formula Econtaining exactly the same parameters 
and exactly the same free variables (see [4] or [5]).
Lemma: Let Ebe a prenex formula without parameters, and let (^„)weci) be 
an increasing sequence of sets whose limit (that is, (J Xn) is X. If each 
neo)
Xn is a mirror for E and all its truncations, then X too is a mirror for E and 
all truncations.
Proof: We prove this lemma by informal (metamathematical) induction 
on the number of “1 ’s and 3x’s at the front of E. When E is quantifier-free 
there is nothing to prove since either E has no truncations or all its 
truncations are quantifier-free as well; in either case every set is a 
mirror.
If Eis HF suppose that each Xn mirrors E and all its truncations; then 
it obviously mirrors F and all its truncations, and so by the induction

THE REFLECTION PRINCIPLE
49
hypothesis X mirrors F and all truncations. Consequently,
Vx0 ... Vxk_t [X(x0) A ... A ^(x^j)
(E(x0,..., xk_i) Fx(x0,..., Xfc-t))],
and since Fis “IF, Ex is “1FX, and so Xmirrors E.
Likewise, if E is 3xF(x, x0,..., xft-i) and every Xn mirrors E and its 
truncations, then every Xn mirrors F and its truncations; so (induction 
hypothesis) X mirrors F and its truncations. It remains to show that X 
is a mirror for E.
Pick a09..., ak-i in X. If Ex(aQ9...9 is true we have 3x(xe Z a 
a Fx (x, aQ9..., ak_ i)), and so there is an a e Xfor which Fx(a, a0,..., ak_ t). 
As X mirrors F, this gives F(a, a0,...5 «k-i) and so 3xF(x, a09...9 ak_i). 
But this is E(a09..., a^-i), which is thereby established.
For the converse suppose that E(a09..., By taking n sufficiently 
big we can ensure that each of a09..., ak_t is in Xn (since they are in X). 
As Xn is a mirror for E we get EXn(a0,..., ak~i)9 or
3x[x eXn a FXn(x, aQ,..., afc-i)].
Thus there is an element a of Xn for which FXn(a9 a09..., ak-1f Now Xn 
mirrors F, so it follows from this that F(a, a09...9 ak~fy And Xalso mir­
rors F, so Fx (a9 aO9...9 ak-f) too. But this entails that 3x(xeX a 
a Fx (x, aQ9...9 flfc-i)) or, what is the same thing, Ex(a09..., ak_fy 
And this proves the lemma. |
Note that this lemma is in effect a lemma scheme, since for each 
formula E it yields the proof of a true formula depending on E,
The reflection principle is another theorem scheme derivable (if AF is 
assumed) within the theory ZF. According to the principle, for every 
parameter-free formula F(x0,..., xk_i) there exists an arbitrarily large 
limit ordinal ft for which V$ mirrors E. More formally, we state it as follows.
Theorem : For every parameter-free formula F(x0,..., xfc _ t) we have
YaSfi > oNxq ... Yxk_ i [/? is a limit ordinal
a (x0 e Ve A ... A xk-! e Vfi
-> (E(x0,..., xk-1) <-* E¥f(x0,..., xk_x)))].

INTRODUCTION TO AXIOMATIC SET THEORY
Proof: We suppose Eto be in prenex normal form, and prove by informal 
induction on its length that for each ordinal a there is a greater limit 
ordinal /? such that Vp mirrors E and all truncations.
If E is quantifier-free we take for /? the first limit ordinal > a, since 
every set - and therefore - is a mirror for E.
If £is “1F we can find a limit p > a such that Vp mirrors F and all trunca­
tions of F. So for a0,in Vfi we get
F(a0,..afc_ t) w FVfi (a0......ak_ t),
and so
•••> ak-i) Evp(aQ9..., 
;
thus also mirrors E.
So suppose E is 3xF(x, x0,according to the induction 
hypothesis, whatever ordinal a is there is a larger limit /? such that Vp 
mirrors F and all its truncations.
We define the functional relation y=<P(x0,..., 
of k arguments to
mean that 6y is the set of all x of minimal rank for which F(x, 
xfc_t) holds, if there are such x, and the empty set otherwise’. It is clear 
from the definition that
3xF(x, x0,...,xft_i)
<->3x[xG$(xQ,...,xk-i) A F(x, x(h...9xk_iy].
We now proceed to define an cosequence of ordinals, (/?„)„ e£0, as follows.
PQ is the first ordinal > a such that Vfio is a mirror for F and all its 
truncations.
When Pi is defined for each i^2n we put p2n+1 equal to the first 
ordinal > p2n such that
$(a0,afc_i) <= Vp2n+1
for every k-tuple aQ,..., ak _ t drawn from Vfi2n. (Since
U {$(a0,afc_i) I <a0,e Vk02n}
is a set, it is included in some V7, and so P2n+l is well defined.)
Pin+2) on the other hand, is put equal to the first ordinal y>P2n+1 for 
which we get a mirror V7 for F and all truncations.
The sequence Pn is strictly increasing, as is plain enough. So if 
P = swppn9 P is a limit ordinal and |J Vfin= U But, by 
neco 
neo 
neo 

THE REFLECTION PRINCIPLE
51
stipulation, each VPln mirrors F and all truncations; and therefore, by 
the lemma, Vp is also a mirror for F.
It remains to prove that Vp is a mirror for E. Take, then, any 
a0,..., ak~t e Vp9 andfixwlarge enough to fit all these objects into VPln.
If E(a0,...»is true we have 3xF(x, ak-\) and so 
3x (x g & (a09..., ak_ t) a F(x9 aQ,..., ak_ J). This gives an a g $ (a0,..., ak_ t) 
for which F(a9 aQ9..., ak_f). As each of a0, ...,tzfc_1 is itself in VPln9 a 
qualifies for VP2n+i9 so ae Vp. Vp9 however, mirrors F9 so Fvp(a9 aQ9...9 
ak_f)9 so 3x(xe Vp a Fvp(x9 aQ9...9 ^-1)), so Evp(aQ9...9 ak-^) as 
required.
Conversely, given the latter fact there must exist an a g Vp verifying 
Fvp(a9 aQ9...9 Since Vp mirrors F, we have then F(a9 a0,..., ak^±) 
for this a9 and so E(a09..., which concludes the proof. |
To see the significance of this theorem in a special case, note first that 
if E is a closed formula, a sentence, then to say that Vp is a mirror for 
it is just to say that it is true in the universe iff it is true in Vp. Thus if E 
is a sentence which is true in the universe, there are arbitrary large limit 
ordinals fi such that E is true in Vp.
In later parts of the book we shall make use of a somewhat more general 
principle of reflection. Consider a functional relation y = Wa with domain On, 
increasing -> Wa a Wp)and continuous (for limit a, Wa— U Wp).
fl<a
Let W be the union (in the intuitive sense) of all the - that is, the class 
defined by 3a[0w(a) a xg WaJ. Then, provided E(x09...9 xfc_t) has no 
parameters, there is9 for every ordinal a, a greater limit ordinal such that
Vx0 ... Vxfc_t [x0 g Wp a ... a xk_1eWp
-+(Ew(x0,xk_1)~Er'(x0,..., Xfc-i))] ■
No real modification of the proof is required to establish this form of the 
principle; for, apart from its continuity, the only fact about the functional 
relation y= Va used above was that it was increasing. In this more general 
case, the expression ‘the set X mirrors the formula F’ can be taken as 
shorthand for the assertion that every member of X is in the class W and
Vx0... Vxfc_t [x0 eX a ... a Xfc-i eX
-► (Ew(x0,x^J <-► Ex(x0,x*-!))].

52
INTRODUCTION TO AXIOMATIC SET THEORY
It should be observed that the axiom of foundation is no longer needed 
for the more general form of the reflection principle; its only use pre­
viously was in guaranteeing that every set belonged to some Va.
COMPARISON OF THE THEORIES OF ZERMELO 
AND ZERMELO/FRAENKEL
Let a be a limit ordinal > co (a is then not less than co + co). There is no 
difficulty in showing that in the set Va (enriched with the membership 
relation) all the following axioms hold.
(1) Axiom of Extensionality.
(2) Pairing Axiom: VxVy3zVz[z e z 
Z — x v Z=y].
(3) Union Axiom.
(4) Power-set Axiom.
(5) Axiom of Infinity: 3x[0 e x a Vy(y e x -> y u {y} e x)].
(6) Scheme of Comprehension: for every formula A(x, x0,..., xk_t) 
without parameters, the axiom
Vx0 ... VXfc-iVxByVzfz e y <-> [z e x a A(z, x0, ..., x&_t)]].
(1) and (3) hold because Va is transitive; (2) and (4) because a is a limit 
ordinal - for if x, y e Va, we get x, y e Vfi for some fi <a, so {x, y} e 
and ^(x)eP^+1, where /?+l<a; and (5) holds because coe Va - we 
selected a above co.
Lastly, to show that all the comprehension axioms (6) hold, suppose 
a, ak_± e Va; they then belong to some Vp for /?<a, so any 
subset of a, for example the set b = {z e a | AVa(z, ^-i)} is in 
and so in Va as required.
We designate by Z the theory (Zermelo set theory) axiomatized by 
(1), (2), (3), (4), (5), (6).
It is not hard to see that, provided Z is consistent, it is strictly weaker 
than ZF. For we can find a sentence - for example ‘Every well-ordered 
system is isomorphic to an ordinal’ - which is derivable in ZF but not 
inZ.
For suppose given some universe in 7^+^ (co + co is the first limit 
ordinal >co), as we have just seen, all the axioms of Zhold. The ordinals 
of K)+co - the sets, that is, that satisfy the relativization of Ow(x) to 
- are simply the ordinals <co + co. But ^(co x co) e Va)+(0, so every 

THE REFLECTION PRINCIPLE
53
well-ordering of co, being a subset of co x co, is in V(o+(a, Among these well­
orderings is one whose ordinal is co + co; but this ordinal is not an ordinal 
of Va+(O, so the well-ordering in question is isomorphic to no ordinal. Thus 
Ko+co t0 satisfy the sentence mentioned, which therefore cannot be 
derived in Z.
Note that the foundation axiom also holds in Va (a being a limit ordinal 
beyond co). We now intend to prove that no consistent extension of 
ZF+AF can be obtained by adding finitely many new axioms to Z+AF; 
put another way, this means that whatever sentence, consistent with Z+AF, 
A may be, we can find a formula B which is a consequence of ZF+AF+A, 
but not ofZ+AF+A.
The formula B is ‘there exists a limit ordinal fi>co such that AVfi\ This 
is certainly a consequence of ZF+AF+A, since A is a consequence of 
that theory. We need only apply the reflection principle with co for a.
Now if a is a limit ordinal, it is easily checked that Va is a mirror for 
all the following formulas (whose free variables are just £, x, y).
(1) On(f>\ when it is written out as
Vx(x e £ -> x cz £) a VxVyfx e £ a y e £ ->
xey v x=y v y ex].
(2) is a limit ordinal’, that is, 
On(g) a a 
u {%}].
(3) y = ^(x),thatisVz[zey z cz %].
(4) y = is, Vw [w e y 3z(z e x a we z)].
(5) x e V%, that is, On(f) a 3/ [/is a map with domain f +1 such 
thattyef+lU ^(/(O)) a xe/(£)].
Set/
Taking these as proved we can proceed to the following lemma.
Lemma: Let E(xQ,...,xk-^ be a parameter-free formula, and a a limit 
ordinal. Then Va mirrors EF?(x0,..., xfc-i) (whose free variables are 
•Xo> • • •> Xk — l)*
Proof: We use metamathematical induction on the length of E, again 
assumed to be in prenex normal form. If E has no quantifiers there is 
nothing to prove, and if E is "IF then EF$is "1FF$; so Va mirrors £F$ iff 
it mirrors Ff? (which it does, by the induction hypothesis).

54
INTRODUCTION TO AXIOMATIC SET THEORY
So suppose that E(x0,..., xk_t) is 3xF(x9 xOt...9 xft_t), F itself being 
a formula for which the lemma holds. Then EF? is the formula 3x [x e a 
a Ff§(x, xQ9..., xfc_i)] and so [,£F?(x0,..., x^)]1'* is 3x[xe7aA 
a (x e V^)v‘ a (FV!S(x, x0,..., xt-i))r'].
We have noted above (in (5)) that Va mirrors the formula of two varia­
bles x e V^. As a consequence, if x, { e Va9 we get (x e V^)Vk x e V^9 
furthermore, since £ is in Va it is less than a, so x e Va a x e 
x e V%.
And again, since Va mirrors Ff? (induction hypothesis), we have for 
x, x0,..., xfc_t e Fathat
(Ff« (x, x0, ..., xk _ i))r“ 
FVf (x, x0,..., xk_ i).
Gathering together all these remarks, we can conclude that for £, 
x0,..., Xfc-i e Va we have
[£r?(*o......«3x[xe E a FV((x, x0,x^J] ;
and this latter being EVt(x0,x^-j, the result follows. |
So let a be the first limit ordinal greater than cd for which Va mirrors the 
sentence A; since A is true in W9 a is the least limit ordinal > cd such that AVa.
By the lemma Va mirrors the formula Av* (of one free variable only, 
£). 2? is just 
is alimit ordinal > cd a Av*]9 so BVa is e V* n (£
is a limit ordinal >co)Fa a (^4f?)f<x]. Since mirrors both x4F? and is 
a limit ordinal >co’, 2?Fa is equivalent to 
e Va a £ is a limit ordinal
> cd a Av*]. However, as a was chosen to be the least limit above cd for 
which Av«9 we cannot have, for a limit both Av* and £ e Va*
9 and, as 
we can see, Bv* requires both to be true. Thus Bv* is false. This proves 
that, though Va satisfies all the axioms of Z, AF9 and A (by the choice of a), 
the formula B does not hold in it. So B cannot be a consequence of 
Z+AF+A.
As a corollary to the above result we may note that if ZF is consistent, 
it is not finitely axiomatizable. For the assumption of consistency allows 
us to assume ZF+AF consistent; so if ZF were equivalent to a single 
sentence A9 ZF+AF would be equivalent to Z+AF+A.
Note that even if A is an arithmetical formula (by this we mean one 
relativized to P^), B is not. Godel’s second incompleteness theorem 
provides us with another proof of the above result, but one which associates 

THE REFLECTION PRINCIPLE
55
with every A consistent with ZF+AF an arithmetical Bf following from 
ZF+ AF+ A, but not from Z+AF+ A.
The following, however, remains an open problem: if ZF is consistent, 
does there exist a sentence A, consistent with Z, such that Z+A is 
equivalent to ZF+A1 From what we have just shown it is clear that such 
a sentence A would have to contradict the axiom of foundation; for 
otherwise Z+AF+A would be consistent and equivalent to ZF+AF+A.

CHAPTER V
THE SET OF EXPRESSIONS
In the first two chapters we constructed, within each universe a sort 
of replica for several of the fundamental ideas of mathematics; the idea 
of a mapping, for example, or that of a natural number. And we agreed 
thenceforth to use these words in the senses we had given them in 
and not at all in their everyday senses.
We are now going to carry out the same ‘reconstruction’ for the idea 
of a formula of set theory. In this case, however, we shall continue to use 
the word ‘formula’ in its intuitive sense only, as we have used it up to 
now, and will take advantage of the word "expression" in order to refer 
to the kind of objects that we shall define in the universe.
Choose from % any five distinct sets, to be denoted by v, ~, 3, £, and 
=; these sets might be, for instance, the sets 0, 1,2, 3, 4. Choose also a 
denumerable set whose elements, called variables, differ from all five 
sets chosen above - might consist of the natural numbers > 5. If x 
is a variable we shall write the ordered pair <3, x) as 3x.
We define by recursion a map n with domain co: 0 is the set 
of ordered triples <e, x, and < =, x, where x, y are in ; more 
formally,
<f0 = [{e}x^2]u[{ = }x^2].
The elements of <f0 are called atomic expressions. Further,
^n+l = 
E{~} X <,] U [{v} X
u[({H}x^)x<f„];
it consists therefore of everything in £n, together with ordered pairs and 
triples of the form < ~< v, 
<3x, for 0,^6^ and xe
Writing £ for |J we call £ the set of all expressions.
neo
It is easy to check by induction on n that, in virtue of our choices for 
v, 3, e, = , and every c: V„9 and so S c: every expression 
is a hereditarily finite set.

THE SET OF EXPRESSIONS
57
Given an expression we shall call the first n for which $ e the 
depth of
Lemma: For each expression 0 one and only one of the following possi­
bilities is realized:
0 is atomic;
0 is of the form <;
0 is of the form < v, T7, !P'>;
0 is of the form <3x, V7).
Furthermore, lP and Y' are expressions determined by and strictly lower 
in depth than itself
Proof: Bearing in mind that the ordered triple <a, b, c> is defined as the 
ordered pair (a, (b, c», it is clear that each expression is an ordered pair. 
Also clear is the fact that the first element of such a pair is bound to be 
s, =, ~, v, or 3x (where x e 7^); and these objects are distinct from one 
another, as that is the way we chose them.
If the first element of a pair is e or = we must have 0 e <^0; if it is ~, the 
second element of the pair is an expression ¥. Writing n+1 for the depth 
of 0 we have <~, ¥) e 4?n+1 and <~, 
so by the definition of
^w+1 we get and therefore the depth of ¥ is less than n +1. On 
the other hand it is obvious that *P is determined uniquely by 0. Exactly 
the same goes if the first element of the pair is 3x. If, however, it is v, 
then the second element takes the form <!P, V7'), *P and ¥' being deter­
mined by 0, obviously enough. From < v, !P'> e ^n+1 and < v, 
it again follows at once that lF, V7' e £n, and therefore Y and 
have depth less than n + 1. |
In the sequel the expressions <e, x, yf < =, x, y), < ~, 0), < v, 0, 
and <3x, will be shortened to x s y, x—y, (0) v (!P), and 3x cP 
respectively; the sets s, =, ~, v will be called the membership sign, the 
equals sign, the negation sign, and the disjunction sign respectively; and 
3 is the existential quantifier.
The expressions (~3>) v (!P), 
v (^T7)), ~3x(~cP) will be
still further shortened to (0) => (!P), (0) a (!P), Vx(3>) respectively; 
and the expression ($ => V7) a (fP => #) will be written (cP)o (^).
We now define recursively on the depth of an expression a map w 
from into the set of all finite subsets of "K; w(cP) will be called the set 

58
INTRODUCTION TO AXIOMATIC SET THEORY
of free variables of the expression <P.
Definition:
If 0 = x s y or 0 = x = y then w(0) = {x, y} ;
w(~ 0) = w(0);
w(0 v = w(<P) u w(?z); 
w(3x0) = w(0)\{x}.
An expression 0 is called closed if w(<P) = 0.
It should be noted that each parameter-free formula A corresponds in an 
obvious way to an expression, an expression we shall denote by rA~\ 
But the converse is false. Were there to exist in Ql a natural number n 
with, intuitively speaking, infinitely many elements, then there would be 
an expression with n as its depth, but no formula could be expected to 
correspond to it. In fact, one can readily see that an expression corre­
sponds to a formula if and only if its depth is a natural number with only 
a finite number of elements (in the intuitive sense of the words).
We can also define (recursively on the depth of the expression $) a binary 
functional relation K=Val(<P, X) whose domain is ‘0 is an expression 
and X is a set’. Y is called the value of the expression in the set X, and 
it is a subset of W(0)X
Definition:
(1) 
If 0 is x £ y (respectively, x = y) then 
Val (0, X) = {<5 e{x-y}X | 5 (x) g 5 (y)} 
(respectively {<5 g <x> ?}X | <5 (x) = <5 (y)});
(2) 
If </> = ~ <p then Val (0, X) = wW (X) \ Val (S', X);
(3) 
If 0 = 'F v ¥" then Val(0>, X)
= {5 g wWX | <5 t w(F) g Val(’P, X)
v d t w(*P') g Val(*P', X)};
(4) 
If = BxF then Val($, X)
= {5 g W(0,X | 35' => 5(5' g wWX a 5' g Val (S', X))} 
(remember that in this case w (<P) = w(!P)\{x}).
If 0 is the expression corresponding to the formula A(x0,..., xfc_i) it is 
simple to see that Val(0, X) is the set of maps b from {x0,..., x^^ into 

THE SET OF EXPRESSIONS
59
Xfor which ^4x(<5(x0),..., ^(x^.J) holds; this is easily proved by informal 
metamathematical induction on the length of the formula A.
We shall write an expression 0 whose free variables form a finite set 
{x0,..., xfc-i} (indexed by a natural number k) as #(x0,..., x^.J; such 
an expression will, for brevity, be called k-adic.
An expression with parameters <PQ is by definition an ordered pair 
<0, where 0 is an expression and rj a map defined on some subset of 
w(0) (perhaps w(<P) itself). If the free variables of cP are x0,..., xk_19 
y0,..., yt-t (and they are all different), and the domain of rj is the subset 
{x0,..., xfc-i} of w(cP), and the value of t] at each xf (for i<k) is ai9 then 
the expression <P0 with parameters is written $(a0,..., 
y0,..., j^-i).
The set {y0,..., 
- that is, w(^)\dom(p) - is, by definition, the set
of free variables of the expression 0O with parameters, and is denoted by
Suppose now that X is a set and 0O = <0, an expression all of whose 
parameters are taken from X. Such an expression will sometimes be called 
an X-expression. We extend the earlier definition of Vai so that Val(<P0> ^) 
becomes the set of all maps S g w^X such that <5 u rj g Vai (cP, X) - 
here <5 u rj is the map defined on w(<£>) as equal to S on w(cP0) and to rj 
on w(0)\w(0o)-
If A(x0,..., Xjt-i) is any formula whatever with parameters, there 
corresponds to it in an obvious fashion an expression with parameters, 
rA"1 for short. Val(rA"1, X) will be properly defined if all the parameters 
of the formula A are elements of X; in which case Val(r24n, X) is the 
set of all maps <5 from {x0,..., x^} into X for which the formula 
^x(<5(x0),<5(xk-i)) holds; this again follows easily by informal 
induction on the length of A.
An expression 0 with parameters is said to be closed if w(cP) = 0. If 0 
is a closed X-expression - so that the set X contains all the parameters of
- then Val(0, X) is a subset of 0X={0}. Accordingly, Val(0, X) = l 
or 0. If it is 1 we say that cP is satisfied in the set X.
The following theorem, proved with the help of the axiom of choice, will 
be used in Chapter VIII.
Theorem (Lowenheim/Skolem) : Let X be a set, P a subset of it, and the 
set of all closed P-expressions which are satisfied in X. Then there is a

subset Y c: X such that every expression in is satisfied in Y, y<P+K0, 
andP <= K.
Proof: The axiom of choice is needed to ensure a map 0: ^(X)\{0} -> X 
such that for every non-empty U <= X, 6(U)gU.
Using the map 0 we define recursively an cosequence Pn of subsets of 
X: Po is just P itself; and Pn+i is defined from Pn in the following manner.
Let &n be the set of monadic P„-expressions <P(x, a0,..., ar^1) for which 
Hx*P(x, a0,..., 6Zr_t) is satisfied in X. Let U0={£ e X | cP({, a0,..., ar_t) is 
satisfied in X}. Then Pn+1 is defined as the set of all 0(U0) for cP in
Thus Pn+1 contains, for each monadic <P e at least one ‘satisfier’ 
of in X, namely 0(U0).
Observe first of all that Pn+1 Pn; for if aePn then the expression 
x=a belongs to &n, and, for this expression, U^ = {a}; thus 0(U&)=a, 
and a e Pn+i.
Secondly, since the set of expressions with parameters in Pn has 
cardinality P„ + Ko, we have ^„^Pw + ^o- But the map sending the ex­
pression cP to 0(U0) is by definition a surjection, a map from on to 
P„+1. Thus P„+1 ^P„ + Ko. By induction, therefore, P„^P+K0.
We set IJ Pn. ThenP c K; and Y^ X 
new 
neto
Now let d>(aQ...., ak^t) be any closed expression whose parameters are 
in y. We show by induction on its depth that cP is satisfied in X if and 
only if it is satisfied in K
For atomic 0 the result is obvious. If cP is ~ (or v W'), $ is satis­
fied in yiff is not (or one or other of is); the induction hypothesis 
then tells us that 0 is satisfied in Y iff Y is not satisfied in X (or either 
T or Y' is satisfied in X); so that cP is satisfied in Y iff it is satisfied in X.
If 0 (a0,..., ak_1) = '3x'P(x, a0,..., ak-±) we suppose to start with that 
0 is satisfied in X, Then, for a big enough n, we will have aQ,..., ak_± all 
in Pn, and therefore ’P(x, a0,..., e Then
0(1^) = a,
say, where aeP„+1, and so ¥(a, a0,..., is satisfied in X (by the 
definitions of 0 and U^). The depth of ¥(a, aQ,..., ak-^, however, is 
strictly less than that of and so, by the induction hypothesis, !P(a, 6Z0,

..., tffc-i) is satisfied in Y; from this it follows at once that 3x?z(x, a0,..., 
which is just 0(ao,..., ^-0, is satisfied in Y.
Conversely, if 3x!P(x, aQ,is satisfied in Y, there must be an 
ae Y for which !P(a, a0,..., is satisfied in K By the induction 
hypothesis !P(a, aQ,is also satisfied in X, so Hx!P(x, a0, 
is too.
In particular we have proved that every expression in is satisfied 
in KJ
The relativization of an expression to a set: Suppose we are presented with 
an expression <P(x0,..., xfc-15 aQ,whose parameters a0,at-± 
are all in a. We define, recursively on the depth of another expression 
<Pa(x0,..., Xfc-t, aQ,..., az_t) known as the relativization of $ to the set a.
Definition : If 0 is atomic then $a = 0;
then
If <2=^ v ¥2 then 0"=^ v ¥a2;
If 0 = then ^a = '3x(x ea a !Fa).
Clearly enough the expressions 0, have the same free variables. The 
parameters of $a, however, are a,a0,...,al^l.
We shall use the following theorem in Chapter VIII.
Theorem: Suppose that a e b and a <= b. If 0 is an expression with para­
meters in a, then Val($, a)=wma r\ Val(^a, b).
Proof: The proof is by induction on the depth of 0. For atomic 0 the 
result is obvious. For molecular 0, suppose $ = ~ (the proof is more or 
less identical, mutatis mutandis, for 0= v !P2). Then
Val(0, a) = w(%\Val(^, a) 
= w(0)6z\Val(Va, b} 
= wWa n Val(0a, b),
since, by hypothesis, the theorem holds for T.
Now suppose 0 to be We have that
Val(0, a) = {<5 e wWa | 35' o 5(5' e w^(a)
a 5'eVal(¥', a))}.

62 
INTRODUCTION TO AXIOMATIC SET THEORY
The induction hypothesis gives Val(*P,a) equal to n Vai (•?“, b), so
Val(<Z>, a) ={(5e w(0)a | 35' => 5(3' e a 5' e ValC?0, b))}
= {<5 e wW a | 3 e Val(3x(x & a a &)}
= wWu r> Val(<Z>°, h).|

CHAPTER VI
ORDINAL DEFINABLE SETS
Relative Consistency of the Axiom of Choice
Notation: Let <£(x) be a monadic expression whose parameters are all in 
some set X; the value of this expression in X is then a subset of {x}X. By the 
canonical bijection of {x}X on to X (that which sends {<x, u)} to u, for 
every u e X) there corresponds to this subset a subset of X itself, written 
val(0, X\ and also called, by a slight abuse of language, the value of 
0inX
We now consider a universe where the axiom of foundation holds, and 
define a class OD, the ordinal definable sets, by the following formula, 
OD (x): ‘There are an ordinal a and a monadic expression 0 (^, a0,..., ar _ x) 
whose parameters are ordinals <a and whose value in the set Va is {%}’.
Lemma: Let a be a set, and A(x, a0,ak_t), whose parameters are 
ordinals, be a formula with a single free variable. If a is the only set for 
which A holds, then a is ordinal definable.
Proof: Since we have chosen a universe in which AF holds, we can 
make use of the reflection principle to obtain an ordinal a not only 
greater than a0,afc_t but also large enough for a to be in Fa, and such 
that Fa mirrors the formula A(x, a0,Then a is the only member 
of Va for which the formula AVa(x, a0,..., afc_t) holds, and so the value 
of the expression rA(x, a0,..., in the set Va is {a}. Thus a is ordi­
nal definable. |
Converse: Let a be ordinal definable. Then there is a formula A(x, 30) 
of one free variable and one parameter (the ordinal b0) which holds for a 
and a alone.
Proof: Consider the parameter-free formulas s=J(a) and x=K(n) 
which establish, respectively, bijections from On on to o(0n) (the class 
of finite sequences of ordinals), and from co on to VC). These formulas have 
been discussed above on pp. 33 and 41 respectively.
With the help of J one can easily define a parameter-free functional

64
INTRODUCTION TO AXIOMATIC SET THEORY
relation = J'(a) which is a surjection from On on to the class of functions 
rj with a finite domain included in and with values in On,
Since a is ordinal definable, there are an expression 0o(xj oc0j. ar-i) 
with parameters in On, and an ordinal y0, such that val(0o, Lyo) = {fl}.
We therefore consider the following quaternary parameter-free formula 
E(x, n, y, /?): is a natural number, /?, y are ordinals, the ordered pair 
<7£(h), J'(fi)y is an expression 0 whose parameters are ordinals less than 
y, andval($, 7y) = {x}’.
Writing then n0 for that natural number such that K(nQ) is the parameter- 
free expression 0o(x, x0,..., x^) and for that ordinal such that
is the function rjQ = {^x0, a0>,..., 
it is apparent that
the formula E(x, n0, y0, /?0) holds for a and for nothing else; this formula, 
however, has three parameters, the ordinals «0, y0, and /?0.
To reduce the number of parameters to one, we write 50 for the inverse 
image under J of the sequence nQ, y0, 
; then the formula A (x, 8Q): ‘there
are a natural number n and two ordinals y, fi, such that J(<50) is the se­
quence {<0, «>, <1, y), <2, py} and E(x, n, y, /?)’ has 80 as its sole para­
meter, and holds for a and a alone. |
A formula like A(x, 80) is said to be a definition of a in terms of ordinals, 
or an ordinal definition of a.
Note that what we have actually produced above is a parameter-free 
formula A(x, y) of two free variables such that if a is ordinal definable 
there is an ordinal for which A(x, provides a definition of a. In 
other words, the following theorem: Vx[OP(x) 3<5(On(<5) a 
Vw (A (u, 6) u = x))].
The class OD is not necessarily a transitive class, for there may be ordi­
nal definable sets a not all of whose elements are ordinal definable. 
However, we can readily isolate a subclass HOD of OD, the hereditarily 
ordinal definable sets, which is transitive, by the formula H0D(x}: 
‘Every element of ^({x}) is ordinal definable’. (Remember that ^(a) is 
the transitive closure of a, the smallest transitive set, that is, which includes 
a; and ({x}) = {x} u ^(x) - see p. 38.)
It should be observed that HOD has been defined by a formula without 
parameters.
Lemma : A set a is hereditarily ordinal definable if and only if it is ordinal 
definable and all its elements are hereditarily ordinal definable.

ORDINAL DEFINABLE SETS
65
Proof: The condition is obviously necessary. So suppose that every 
element of a is in HOD, and that a is in OD. We must show then that 
a is in HOD.
From the properties of transitive closures investigated on p. 38 we 
havethat ^({a})=={a} u ^(a) = {a) u a u IJ and so 
%({a}) = {a} u U (W #&) 
yea
= {a} u U #(&)■ 
yea
By assumption every element of &({y}) is in OD, whatever element y 
may be of a. Since a is in OD, this shows that every element of # ({a}) 
is in OD ; and so HOD (a). |
Our main task in this chapter will be the proof of the relative con­
sistency of the axiom of choice. We do this by constructing from a model 
of ZF another model, one for ZF+AF+AC. Moving off from we 
first construct a model <%, as we have done before (p. 43), for ZF+AF. 
We then show that not only ZF+ AF but also AC holds in the class HOD 
constructed within °U.
Axiom of Extensionality: Obvious, since if a, b are in HOD, so are all 
their elements.
Union Axiom: If a is in HOD, let b = |J a. It is clear that every element 
of b is in HOD. According to the above lemma, all that remains to be 
shown is that b is ordinal definable.
Now a is certainly ordinal definable, so is the only set for which a 
certain formula A (x, a) holds; as b is the only set for which
B(y,a): Vz(ze y e a a z e w))
holds, we can combine the two into
3x[A(x, a) a B(y, x)]
which is a formula of one free variable, and one ordinal parameter. It 
obviously holds just for b, so by the lemma on p. 64, b is ordinal 
definable.
Power-set Axiom: Suppose a to be in HOD, and b the set of all hereditarily 
ordinal definable subsets of a. We want to show HOD(b), and since we 
have at once HOD(x) for every x in b, we need only check that OD(b}. 

66
INTRODUCTION TO AXIOMATIC SET THEORY
If A (x, a) is an ordinal definition of a, since b is the only set for which
B (y, a): Vz [z e y <-> HOD (z) a z <= d\
holds, it is clear that 3x[^4(x, a) a B{y, x)] holds for b and for nothing 
else. Thus OD(b).
Scheme of Replacement: Let a be some object of HOD, and R(x, y9 a09 
...,ak_f) be a binary relation with parameters in HOD. If, interpreted 
in HOD, R defines a functional relation, then the formula HOD(x) a 
a HOD(y) \ RHOD(x,y, aQ,..., ak-t) defining it in the universe also 
defines a functional relation, S(x, y, a0,..., ak_f) say, for brevity. Let b 
be the set of images under S of elements of a. Since every element of b is 
in HOD, we need only prove that OD(b). So let A(x, a), A(x0, a0),..., 
A(xk-19 afc-i) be ordinal definitions of a, aQ,..., ak_x respectively.
Then since b is the only object for which the formula
B(y, a, a0,- -, a4-i):
Vz[z e y e a a S(t,z, aQ,t))] 
holds, it enjoys the same distinction with respect to the formula
3x3x0... 3xfc_i [y4(x, a) a A(x0, a0)
a ... a A(xk^1,ak^1) A B(y,x,x0,...,xk-1)'],
whose only parameters are the ordinals a, a0,..., Thus OD(b), as 
required.
Axiom of Infinity: If a is any ordinal it is obviously ordinal defined by 
x = a; so every ordinal is in fact in HOD. HOD{co) in particular, and the 
axiom of infinity holds for co in HOD.
Axiom of Foundation: If a non-empty set a is in HOD, and b is one of its 
elements bearing minimal rank, then b is in HOD and b n a = 0.
Axiom of Choice: We can define, by a formula without parameters as 
follows, an injective functional relation a = 0(x) which associates an 
ordinal with each monadic expression whose parameters are in On. 
Starting from such an expression 3>(x, a0,..., ar_t) we go first to the 
parameter-free expression 0(x, x0,..., x^J, which is an element of 

ORDINAL DEFINABLE SETS
67
yo. Using our bijection K from co on to we let n be the natural number 
for which K(ri)=$(x, x0,..., xr_t). In a similar way we let be the first 
ordinal for which J' (/?) is the function {<x0, ao\ • • • -1> ar -1>} where J' 
is the functional relation defined on p. 64. Then a = 6>(0(x, a0,..., ar-t)) 
is taken as that ordinal a associated with the pair <w, /?> by the isomorphism 
between On2 and On,
Granted O then, we proceed to define another functional relation 
P=D(x), from OD into On, by the formula 6fi is the least ordinal to 
represent a pair of ordinals <a, y> where y = 6>(0) for some monadic 
expression cP with parameters in a and value {x} in Va’,
The formula P=D(x) has no parameters; what is more, it defines an 
injection, for x^x' -> D(x)^D(x’}, as is easily checked.
It is clear now that the relation R(x, y) defined by the parameter- 
free formula OD(x) a OD(y) a Z>(x)<Z>(y) is a well-ordering of the 
class OD,
So suppose a to be any hereditarily ordinal definable set. Restricting 
the well-ordering R to a yields the set
b = {<x, y> e a2 | D(x) < D(y)},
and it is this set which we shall show to be a well-ordering of a, and itself 
in HOD,
Taking the latter point first, note that all of b’s elements are in HOD, 
so we have only to prove that OD(b), But since the formula
B(y, a): Vz[z ey 
e a a vea a
z = <w, v> a D(u) < Z>(r))]
holds only for b, and we may assume that some ordinal definition of a, 
A(x, a), holds only for a, it is clear once more that b is ordinal defined 
by the formula 3x[^4(x, a) a B{y, x)]. So HOD(b),
As far as % is concerned, b certainly well-orders a\ that this is also the 
case in HOD is apparent from the fact that all non-empty subsets of a, 
those lying in HOD in particular, have a smallest element (mod. Z>).
Thus Zermelo’s theorem holds in HOD; so AC too. This concludes the 
proof that AC is consistent relative to ZF,
The ordinals of HOD are the same as the ordinals of ; and the natural 
numbers of % appear unchanged in HOD too. Note that since AF holds 

68
INTRODUCTION TO AXIOMATIC SET THEORY
in HOD we can write On(x) here as
Vy(y gx -> y <= x) a Vz[(y ex a z ex)
-> (z e y v y = z v y g z)] .
Moreover, VCi is in HOD, For the bijection x — K(n) from co on to V„ 
provides, for every hereditarily finite set, a definition whose only para­
meter is a natural number. Thus everything in V„ is in OD, and since Vm 
is transitive, this means in HOD too. being definable by the parameter- 
free formula 6x is the set of hereditarily finite sets’, is itself in OD, so too 
inJTOD.
Continuing on these lines, we see that if f is the map n Vn defined 
on co, then HOD{f)\ for any element of f is a pair <w, Fw>, clearly 
hereditarily finite, and so in HOD, And f can be defined by the following 
parameter-free formula: ‘/is a map defined on co such that/(0)=0 and 
f(k+1) = ^ (/(&)) for each k e co\
The upshot is that the class HOD is a mirror for the formula x e 
in other words, that (x e Vf)303 ^xeVa. For xeV^ can be written
3/3 n [/ is a map defined on co such that /(0) = 0, 
f(k + 1) = ^(/(fc)) for all fc g co, and neat and x e /(«)] .
This fact, coupled with the relative consistency proof of AC just given, 
yields the following result.
Theorem : If an arithmeticalformula E (one whose quantifiers are relativized 
to V^, that is) is derivable in the theory ZF+AC, it is derivable already 
in ZF,
Proof: Since (xg F0)f/OD^>xG we can see without difficulty that 
Ehod 
E, if E has been relativized to V„,
So if E is a theorem of ZF+AC, there is a proof Ao,An-2,E °f it 
in that theory. We have shown, however, for each axiom A of ZF+AC 
that AH0D is a theorem of ZF, Thus A3OD,..., A3?3, EHOD is a proof of 
E3OD9 and so of E, from ZF alone. |
The Choice Principle', We say that the choice principle holds for a universe 
if there is a formula A(x, y) of two free variables and no parameters 
which defines a well-ordering of the entire universe.
In such a case the axiom of choice is easily seen to hold. We should 

ORDINAL DEFINABLE SETS
69
note however that, as it stands, the choice principle is not only not an 
axiom, it is not even a scheme of axioms; rather, it is something like an 
‘infinite disjunction’ of sentences, of all those sentences, that is, which 
say, of a binary relation without parameters, that it well-orders the 
universe <%. Nevertheless, we can establish the following result.
Theorem: If AF holds in then the choice principle holds in % if and 
only if the axiom YxOD(x) holds in $1.
Proof: If the choice principle holds, some parameter-free formula A (x, >’) 
defines a well-ordering of So there will be generated by this well­
ordering an isomorphism x=J(d) from On on to and this isomorphism 
will be definable by a formula free of parameters. Thus x=J(a) will 
provide an ordinal definition for every element of and therefore 
VxOD(x) will hold.
Conversely, given that VxCZD(x) holds, we can proceed as above to 
write down the formula D(x)^D(j); this is parameter-free, and it 
defines a well-ordering on |
In particular, granted AF, the parameter-free formula D(x)^D(y) 
has the following property. If there is any parameter-free formula A(x, >’) 
defining a well-ordering of the universe, then D(x)^D(y) defines a well­
ordering of the universe.
In Chapter VIII we will be able to show the relative consistency of the 
axiom Vx<9Z>(x).

CHAPTER VII
FRAENKEL/MOSTOWSKI MODELS
Relative Consistency of the Negation of the Axiom of Choice 
(Without the Axiom of Foundation)
Let R(x, y) be a relation of two arguments that establishes a bijection 
from the universe % on to itself; that is, a relation which satisfies the 
following conditions:
VxVyVy'[R(x, y) a R(x, y') -> y = y'] ;
VxVx'Vy [R(x, y) a R(x', y) -> x = x'] ;
Vx3yR(x, y) a Vy3xR(x, y).
We shall write this functional relation asy = F(x); and the binary relation 
x g F(y) will be written x g' y. Likewise, the formula obtained from the 
formula E(x0,..., xk_t) by changing g throughout to g' will be written 
E'(x0,...,xk-l).
We shall show that every ZF axiom holds in the class of all sets, 
enriched with the relation g' (a universe we shall call <%'). This amounts 
to proving that if A is an axiom of ZF, then A' holds in
Axiom of Extensionality: We must show that
VxVy [x = y <-> Vz (z g' x z g' y)].
So let a, b be two sets in % such that Vz(z g' a z g' Z>); by the definition 
of g' we then have
Vz (z g F (a) <-» z g F (6)).
Thus F(a)=F(b). Since Fis bijective, this means that a = b.
Union Axiom: If a is a set then the class By [y g' a \ x g' y] is one too. 
For this formula is just an abbreviation of 3y[yGF(a) a xGF(y)], 
and so is equivalent to x g |J F(y). Putting this last set equal to c, we 
obtain 
yef(fl)
Vx [x g c <-> By (y g' a a x g' y)],
whence, letting b stand for F~1 (c),
Vx [x g' b By (y g' a a x g' y)], 
which shows that the union axiom holds.

FRAENKEL/MOSTOWSKI MODELS 
71
Power-set Axiom: If a is any set, the formula Vy(y e' x -> y e' a) is just
Vy[yeF(x)-4jeF(o)];
that is, it is equivalent to F(x) cz F(a) or, putting c for ^(F(a)), to 
F(x) g c. Defining b by F(b) = {x | F(x) g c}, and remembering that F is 
bijective, we get F(x) g c equivalent to x g F(b). Thus
x g' b <-> Vy [y g' x -> y g' a] , 
proving that the power-set axiom also holds.
Scheme of Replacement: Let a be a set and R(x, y) a formula such that 
jR'(x, y) defines a functional relation. Let c be the set of images of elements 
of F(a) under this functional relation. Then
Vy [ye c <-> 3x(x e F(a) a R'(x, y))] ;
so by writing again b for F~1 (c) we have
Vy [y g' b <-> Sx(x g' a a R'(x, y))].
Thus the replacement scheme holds.
Axiom of Infinity: We define by recursion a map f with domain co :/(0) = 
=F-1(0); /(zi+l) is defined by F(f(n+ l))=F(/(«)) u {/(«)}. 
Writing rj for the range off9 we then set 0 = F~1 (rf).
Since Vx(x F-1(0)), the set F-1(0) must be the empty set 0' of 
Since 0' g ?/, we get 0' g' 0.
Moreover, if xg'0, then xgjj, so x=f(n) for some «gco. Now 
Vz\ze’fty+l)*-* ze’f(ri) v z=/(w)], from the definition of /(« + l); 
consequently,
f(n + 1) = x u' {x}',
and so Vx[x g' 0 -> x u' {x}' g' 0]; thus 0 is a set satisfying the axiom 
of infinity in
If the axiom of choice holds in 
it holds also in W.
For suppose that a is a set for which, in the formula ‘the elements 
of a are non-empty but pairwise disjoint’ holds. Then
Vx [x e' a -> Sy (y g' x)]
and
VxVy [(x g' a a y g' a a x / y) -> Vz (z x v z$ y)].

72
INTRODUCTION TO AXIOMATIC SET THEORY
Put ar for {F(x) | x e F(fl)} ; then the two sentences above say that the 
elements of a± are non-empty and disjoint in pairs. So if the axiom of 
choice holds in we can find a set br which intersects each member of 
at a single point; that is,
VxBy [x e -► Vz (y = z z e x a z e &J],
or, alternatively,
VxBy [F(x) e at -> Vz(y = z <-> z ef(x) a z e & J] .
Now the definition of ar implies that F(x) e ar iff x e F(a)\ if and only 
if, that is, x e' a. Thus we get
Vx3y [x e' a -> Vz(y = z z e' x a z e & J] .
Write now b for F~1 (&J; we obtain
VxBy [x e' a -> Vz(y = z z e' x a z e' &)], 
showing that the axiom of choice holds in
A set a is called an atom of the universe if a — {a}; or (equivalently) if 
Vx(x e a <-> x=a) holds in No atoms can exist, it is clear, where the 
axiom of foundation holds.
IfZFis consistent so is ZF+ 'there is an atom".
To prove this we define a simple bijection F from % on to itself by the 
formula (x = 0 a y=l) v (x=l a y — 0) v (x^O a x/1 a x=y). In 
the universe obtained by applying this bijection to <, the empty set 
of namely 0, is an atom. For since F(0) = {0}, we have at once 
Vx(x e' 0 <-> x = 0).
It is possible, by a suitable choice for the bijection F, to show that several 
other sentences, stronger than the negation of AF, are consistent with 
ZF; for example, the sentences asserting the existence of e-cycles 
aQea1 e... e an.±e a0.
For the rest of this chapter we shall rely on the following example only.
If ZF is consistent, so is ZF+‘there exists a set of atoms that is equi­
pollent to co'.
Define F by setting F(ri) — {n}9 F({«})==« for every natural number 
h>1, and F(x) = x everywhere else. This is a bijection all right since n 
and {p} must be different if n andp are both positive natural numbers.

fraenkel/mostowski models
73
Since for every we have Vx(xe' n <-+x=ri) we see that n is an 
atom of We must now show that, within this set of atoms is 
equipollent to cd.
Given two objects a, b we write (we have already done this above, 
without explanation) {a, b}' for their pair in it is clear that {a, />}' = 
= F"1({tz, Z>}). <a, by is similarly the ordered pair in of a and b, so 
that <a, &>'=F-1({F-1({a}), F~\{a, />})}).
We can recursively define a function f with domain co by setting
Vx[x e' f(n) <-> 
< n(x = /(i))] ;
thus /(«+l) = F-1({/(0),/(I),...,/(«)}) and /(O) = 0'. From this 
definition it is clear that when n runs through co, f («) runs through the set 
of natural numbers in
By putting <x, y>' e' g 
<x, y> e f, we can then define a map g in
We obtain <x, y>' e F(g) 
<x, y> e f9 and thus if h is the set of images of
elements off under the map <x, y) <x, y)', we have g=^F~r (ti).
After all this, it is clear that in g is a bijection from the natural 
numbers of W to the natural numbers of Since all the positive natural 
numbers of are atoms in we have shown that the latter universe 
contains a set of atoms equipollent to co.
RELATIVE CONSISTENCY OF THE NEGATION OF
THE AXIOM OF CHOICE
In this section we shall provide a model of ZF in which the axiom of 
choice fails. From what we have just proved we can suppose given a 
universe ^/0 in which there is a set of atoms, X, equipollent to co.
We begin by defining a functional relation y= Wa on the ordinals by 
W0 = X'9Wa= U (for all a^0).
0<a
Note that since X is a set of atoms, Wo is transitive. Thus Wo <= 0*(Wq) = 
= W±. For 1 furthermore, it is clear that Wfi cz Wa. It follows that 
whatever ordinals a, ft are, if ft a then cz Wa.
In the same way as we proved similar results for Va in Chapter III, 
we can show that Wa+1==0*(W^, and Wa= (J Wp when a is a limit 
j?<a
ordinal. The union (in the intuitive sense) of all the Wa we denote by FT; 
W(x), then, is the formula 3a[O«(a) axe FKa].

INTRODUCTION TO AXIOMATIC SET THEORY
If a is in W we again call the least ordinal a for which a e Wa the rank 
of a.
Lemma: An object a is in W if and only if all its elements are. The rank 
of any element of a is strictly below that of a itself, provided only that a does 
not have rank 0. The axioms of ZF hold in the class W.
Proof: All parts of the lemma are proved in the same way as similar 
results were proved for V in Chapter III. |
The set X is in W since X e PFP Moreover, every atom in W is an 
element of X. For suppose, on the contrary, that there were an atom a 
of W whose rank were non-zero. Since no limit ordinal is the rank of 
anything, we can suppose a’s rank to be a +1. Thus a e Wa+19 so a cz Wa; 
but a e a, so a e Wa, contradicting the definition of rank. Thus a has 
rank 0, so is in X.
Again, the bijection f from X on to co is in for f consists only of 
pairs <a, n) with a e X and n e co; <#, is therefore in Wn+3.
Although W does not satisfy the axiom of foundation, it does satisfy 
the sentence
Vx [x 0 Sy [y e x a (y n x — 0 v y = {y})]] .
For if a non-empty set a is in W, let b be an element of it of least rank. If 
the rank in question is positive, every element of b is of lower rank, so 
b n a — 0; but if it is zero, b is an atom.
Consequently the class W proves the consistency of the axiom system 
T given by: ZF+‘the class of all atoms (defined by the formula x = {x}) 
is a set equipollent to co'+Vx[x00 -> 3y[y e x a (y n x = 0 v y= 
={?})]]•
We now consider a universe satisfying all these axioms; and, writing 
X for the set of atoms of we carry out the above construction within 
Thus PF0 = Arand if a>l, PFa = (J 
PF is the class defined by
3a[6>fl(a) a xe JVa]. 
fi<a
Every object of is in PF; equivalently, satisfies the axiom 
Vx3a[Ow(a) a xe PFJ. For suppose the existence of an a not in PF; 
let b be its transitive closure, and c the set of those elements of b not in PF. 
Since a is not in PF, some element x of a is not in PF; and since this x will 

fraenkel/mostowski models
75
be in c, c cannot be empty. So take any y e c; it is not in W, so has an 
element z not in W, Since yeb and b is transitive, z is also in b. Thus z 
qualifies for c, which means that y n c^O, for every yec. Moreover, 
no such y can be an atom either, for in this universe all atoms are in W. 
The set c thus contradicts the axiom
Vx [x / 0 -► Sy O 6 x a (y n x = 0 v y = {y})]].
If a is a bijection from X on to itself (a permutation it is also called), 
we can define by recursion a functional relation cra such that (1) if a is an 
ordinal aa is an e-automorphism of Wa and (2) a0 = a, and if 
then (?p is an extension of Op,. For suppose the family (crj3)j3<a has 
been defined to meet these requirements. Then for limit a we have 
PKa= U ^0? so we can define tra simply as (J and the proof that 
fi<at 
fi<a.
aa has properties (1) and (2) is entirely straightforward.
For a = j8 + l we have PFa=^(PF^), so can define cra by setting cra(w)= 
= {ajS(x) | x g u} for every u e Wa. Since Op is a permutation of Wfi, it is 
clear that aa is a permutation of ^(Wp). In addition, cra is an extension of 
Op; for if u g Wp each x g u belongs to Wp, and since Op is an e-automor- 
phism of Wp, we have x g u ^(x) g &p(u), so that Gp(u)={^(x) | x g u} = 
=<7«(w).
Finally, cra is itself an automorphism of Wa, as can be shown by proving 
that, for arbitrary x, u g Wa,
xeu <-> o’a(x)g<ra(u).
But if x g u, we get x g Wp, so a^(x) g aa(w) - by the definition of aa -, so
Conversely, if aa(x) g aa(w), then aa(x) g Wp, As aa is a permutation of 
Wa which simply extends the permutation of Wp, we have x g Wp, so 
Gp(x) e Ga(u), and therefore x g u, by the definition of aa.
Starting from cr0 = cr then, the functional relation a -> cra as recursively 
defined above has all the required properties.
From it we can define another functional relation, y=«^a(x), as the 
common extension of all the tra; this functional relation, defined by
3a[0n(a) a x g Wa a y = aa(x)], 
has domain and, indeed, is an automorphism of <%l9 so that the

following are all true in :
VxVx' [^(x) = ^(x') -> x = x'] ;
Vy3x[y = ^ff(x)];
VxVx' [x e x' «-* «^„(x) e ^(x')].
(The proof of these sentences is immediate from the definition of
Thus for each permutation a of the set X of atoms we have defined a 
functional relation y — ^ff(x) which is an automorphism of the entire 
universe For notational simplicity we shall from here on write 
y = (?(x) for y = ^ff(x); since for any atom x we have cr(x) = t9:7<r(x), this 
convention will not precipitate any confusion.
Lemma: Let E(a0,..., an_f) be a sentence with parameters a0,...,an^1; 
and let a be a permutation of X. Then E(aQ,..., an_^+-+ E(aa0,..., aan-^. 
Proof: The proof is by informal induction on the length of the formula 
E(a0,..., tfn-i); if this formula is atomic, that is, a0 e a± or aQ — a19 then 
the theorem holds because a is an e-automorphism of the universe
If E(a0>...,(!„-!) is -iF(a0,..., «„_!) we have F(a0......a„_i)
<-*F(cra0,..., oan _ J by the induction hypothesis; and therefore the required 
equivalence holds also for E. When E(a0,..., an_i) is F(a0,..., v 
v G(a0,..., J the pro of is the same.
If E(a0,..., an-i) is 3xF(x, a0,..., suppose it to be true in 
then for some object a we have F(a, a0,..., an_f), and so F(pa, aaQ,..., 
oan~f) by the induction hypothesis; thus 3xF(x, cra0,..., The 
converse is handled likewise. |
Note that this lemma is another example of a theorem scheme, this 
time in the theory T defined on p. 74 above. What we have shown is the 
sentence ‘For every permutation cr of the set of atoms, and for every 
Xoj.-.jXn-i, E(xQ,..., Xn-i) E(px0,..., crxn_i)’ for an arbitrary para­
meter-free formula E(xQ,...,
Lemma: Let A(x, a0,..., ak~f) be a formula of one free variable holding 
for just one set, the set a; let a be a permutation of X. Then oa is the only 
set for which the formula A (x, crfl0,..., aak _ t) holds.
Proof: By assumption we have Vx[x=a ^4(x, aQ,..., so, by 
the previous lemma,
Vx [x = oa <-> A(x, aaQ,..., aak_ J] . I

Lemma : If a is an ordinal, and a is a permutation of X, then aa = a.
Proof: Otherwise, suppose a is the first ordinal for which cra^a; then 
(?P = P for all Pea, so cra = {cr/? | P e a} = a, which contradicts the 
supposition. |
Within the universe we can apply the generalized reflection principle 
(p. 51) to the functional relation y = Wa. Since the universe is exhausted 
in this case by the (intuitive) union of all the Wa9s, we can conclude that 
for every formula E that is without parameters
Vail/? > aVx0 • • • Vxk_ t [x0 e Wfi a ... a xk_ t e Wfi
-> (E(x0>..xk~ J 
Ew“ (x0,..xk_x))].
We can proceed to define the class ODr by the formula ODr (x), ‘There 
are an ordinal a and a monadic expression #(y, a0,..., ar_1? a0,..., as_t) 
all of whose parameters are atoms or ordinals <a, and val(<P, W^ = {x}\
This class will be referred to as the class of sets definable by ordinals 
and atoms. As in Chapter VI we can prove the following result.
Lemma: Let A(x, a0,..., ar~19 u) be a singulary formula whose parameters 
a0,..., ar^19u are all ordinals, except for u, which is a finite sequence of 
atoms (a map, that is to say, from some natural number s into X). Then if 
a is the only set for which the formula A holds, a is definable by ordinals 
and atoms.
Proof: The generalized reflection principle provides us with an ordinal 
a>a0,..., ar_± and big enough for u and a both to belong to Wa, and 
such that Wa mirrors the formula A.
Then the value of the expression rA(x, a0,..., ar_1; w)n in Wa is {a}. 
Write !P(x, a0,..., ar_1? w) for this expression. Since u is a finite sequence 
a0,..., as _ i of atoms we have
u = {<0, a0>,<s - 1, as-!>}.
Thus the expression
ezo t = <0, a0> v ... v 
t = O - 
A y(x,a0......
gets the value {a} in Wa and has only ordinals and atoms for parame­
ters. |
The converse can also be obtained.

78
INTRODUCTION TO AXIOMATIC SET THEORY
Converse: If a is a set definable by ordinals and atoms, then there is a 
formula A(x, So, u) of one free variable that holds for a and a alone; the 
parameters of A, moreover, are just two - the ordinal <50 and the finite 
sequence of atoms u.
Proof: By the specification of a we have an ordinal y0 and an expression 
0(x, a0,..., ar_1? a09..., as_i) whose parameters are the atoms a09..., as-1 
and the ordinals a0,..., 
<y0; and the value of 0 in WY0 is {a}.
Such an expression specifies uniquely a natural number (the one asso­
ciated with the parameter-free expression $(x, x0,..., xr_1? y09..., JVi))> 
an ordinal (the one associated with the finite sequence of ordinals 
a0,..., ar-i), and a finite sequence u—a0,of atoms; and therefore 
it singles out an ordinal and a finite sequence of atoms, u. A formula 
with three parameters E(x, yQ, fi09 u)9 namely ‘the expression (whose 
parameters are ordinals and atoms) associated with the ordinal /?0 and the 
finite atom-sequence u has the value {x} in the set W70’ is therefore at 
hand. The number of parameters can then be reduced to two by means of 
the bijection from On2 on to On; and this yields a formula A(x9 6Q9 u) 
holding, as required, for a and nothing else. Such a formula A(x, <50, u) 
will be said to be a definition of a by ordinals and atoms. |
Note that the class ODr has been defined by a parameter-free formula. 
Also parameter-free is the formula HOD^x) which defines the class of 
sets hereditarily definable by ordinals and atoms, HODr. It is simply 
‘Every element of ({x}) is in ODf.
Lemma: A set a is in HODr if and only if a is in ODr and every element of 
a is in HODr.
Proof: The proof is the same as that of the corresponding lemma in 
Chapter VI. |
That the class HOD1 satisfies the axioms of ZF can also be proved in the 
way the same claim for HOD was proved in the last chapter.
We can prove that the set X of atoms is in HODr. For every atom a 
is definable by the formula x=a9 so is in ODr. As ^({a}) = a, each atom 
is in HODr. So we need only show that Xis in ODr; but since it is the set 
of atoms, it is definable by Vz(z ex <-> z = {z})9 so certainly qualifies for 
ODt.
But the axiom of choice is not satisfied in HODr; worse, the set of atoms 
cannot even be linearly ordered.

fraenkel/mostowski models
79
For suppose in HOD^ there were a set v which imposed a strict linear 
order on X. Let A(x9 30, u) be some definition of v by ordinals and atoms. 
Then since u is only a finite sequence of atoms a0,..., as_i9 and X is 
equipollent with co (in ^), there must be two atoms b9 c different from 
all the a09..., as_ t. v linearly orders X9 however, so without loss of generality 
we can suppose <Z>, c) e v. Let a be that permutation which switches b and 
c round, but otherwise leaves X unaltered; then nothing happens to any 
of the atoms aQ9..., as_r under cr, so ctm=m. Moreover, 
since
is an ordinal. But, by the lemma on p. 76 ov is defined by the formula 
A(x9 (h)q9 gu)9 so av actually equals v. Now <Z>, e v by assumption, so 
e &v9 so <c, by e v. Thus v is not a strict order, which contradicts 
our hypothesis.
Let us note two other properties of X which contradict AC and yet are 
true of yin HODr.
Every subset of X either is finite or has a finite complement with respect to X.
Let Y be some object of HODr which is a subset of X9 but not finite 
(that is to say, it is not equipollent with any natural number); and 
suppose A (x, y0, u) to be a definition of Tin terms of ordinals and atoms. 
As Y is not finite we can certainly find a b e Y which is not among the 
terms of the finite atom-sequence u. Let c be any other atom ignored by 
u9 and let a be that permutation of X which switches b and c round 
whilst keeping the other atoms fixed. We have at once that ou=u and 
ay0 = y0 (since y0 is an ordinal). And as Y is defined by the formula 
t4(x, y0, w), we must also have aY= K As 6 g T we get ab e crF, so c e Y. 
Thus every atom like e9 that is every atom not accounted for in u9 is an 
element of Y. Thus y\T is finite.
X is not finite, but it has no infinite denumerable subset (subset equipollent 
with co).
As X is equipollent with co within <%19 it cannot in HOD± be equipollent 
to a natural number. If Y is a subset of X that is equipollent with co9 it 
cannot be finite; and so y\Tis finite according to the previous result. 
But then X itself is equipollent with co9 which means that it can be well 
ordered. And this, we know, is false.
Note that the model of ZF+ AC just constructed does not satisfy 

80 
INTRODUCTION TO AXIOMATIC SET THEORY
AF, so it does not solve the problem of whether ZF+AF+ ~\AC is 
consistent. Indeed, the set here which cannot be well ordered is a patho­
logical one, the set of atoms. The results of P. Cohen described in [2] yield 
far more interesting relative consistency results; for example that of 
ZF+AF+ 6^(co) cannot be well ordered’.

CHAPTER VIII
CONSTRUCTIBLE SETS
Relative Consistency of the Generalized Continuum Hypothesis
Given a set X and a subset Y of it we say that Y is a subset of X definable 
by parameters, if there is a monadic expression $(x, «0,..., ak_.f) which 
has parameters aQ9..., ak _ t in X and the value Yin the set X
We define a functional relation y=n(x) 011 c^ass °f sets 
the formula ‘y is the set of subsets of x definable by parameters’.
If the axiom of choice holds, then if a is an infinite set, fj (a) =a.
For, first of all, every member b of a provides a subset of a9 {b}9 definable 
by parameters by way of the expression x=Z>; so f](fl)^«. And the set 
of expressions with parameters in a has cardinality K0-a(a)=3 (since 
any such expression can be specified by a parameter-free expression and a 
finite sequence of members of a); so fl (fl) <3.
This proves that for infinite a9 f](fl) is a proper subset of ^(«).
Observe however that the functional relation J-HW not increasing 
with x; that, in other words, we can have a <= b without having 
II(a) 01 IW For if a is a subset of b9 but not one definable by para­
meters, then aeJJ(a) (defined as it is by the expression x=x), but 
a $ IW However, if a is also a member of b9 this possibility no longer 
obtains.
Theorem: If a cz b and aeb then f](fl) c= fl(^)’
Proof: If c g fj(fl) then c=val(0, a) for some monadic expression <f>(x) 
whose parameters a0, ak_r are in a. Thus z g c iff z g val(3>, a), that 
is iff {<x, z>} g Val(0, a). But by the theorem on pp. 61f., Val(0, a) = 
=Val(0a, b) n {x}a*9 thus z g c iff {<x, z>} g Val(<Pa, b) \ {<x, z>} g {x}a. 
Consequently,
z g c <-» z g val(0a, b) a z g a,
so c=val(0a, b) r\ a.

82
INTRODUCTION TO AXIOMATIC SET THEORY
It follows at once that c=val[#a(x) a xea, &], since in general 
val($, b) is the set of elements of b that satisfy 0. But all the parameters 
of the expression <£>a(x) a x s a, namely a, a0,..., ak^i are elements of b. 
Thus c e fl (6). |
By setting first Lo = 0 we can define recursively a functional relation on 
the whole of On by setting thereafter

P<a
The class L defined by the formula £(x): 3a[On(a) a xe £a], the union 
(in the intuitive sense) of all the La, is called the class of constructible sets. 
Appropriately enough, a set a is called constructible if it is in £; if, there­
fore, it is in La for some ordinal a.
The axiom of constructibility is the sentence ‘Every set is constructible’, 
or, equivalently, Vx3a[(?w(a) a xeLj. The main business of this 
chapter will consist in showing that if ZF is consistent, it remains so on the 
addition of the axiom of constructibility. We do this by proving that the 
class L with the usual membership relation satisfies all the ZF axioms and 
the axiom of constructibility too.
We first prove some results for the Za’s very similar to ones proved already 
for the y/s. If a'Rathen La, cz La, since La> = |J FI(^) c U II (^) =

recent theorem then, since Lp c: La and L^eL^ we have fj (Lp) <= fj (La).
As £a+1= (J n(^) we have Ax+i^IICAx) for every ordinal a. On

Corresponding to the definition of rank, we now provide a definition 
of order. The order of a constructible set x is the first ordinal a for which 
x eWe write it od(x), and note that od(x) is never a limit ordinal; 
for if a is a limit and x e La then x is already in Lfi for some smaller /?.

CONSTRUCTIBLE SETS

Lemma: If a is constructible, so are all its elements; their orders, moreover, 
are strictly less than the order of a.
Proof: Let a=/?+l be the order of a. Then aeLp+19 so
Thus a <= Lfi, and every element of a must belong to Lp; these elements, 
therefore, have lower order than a. |
It follows that for any ordinal a the set £a is transitive; for if a e La 
and be a, the order of a is a, so also the order of b.
Theorem : Every ordinal a is constructible, and the order of a is a +1. 
Proof: If there is an ordinal a for which a e La, let a0 be the least. Then 
aoe IJ IW and so ao e IB) f°r some ^ea0; thus a0 <= Lfi9 
fieao
giving p e Lfi9 in contradiction with the definition of a0.
That much done, it remains to prove that a e £a+1 for every ordinal a. 
Again, let a0 be the least ordinal, if there is one, such that a0 ££ao+1. 
For every ft e a0 then, we have ft e Lp+19 so ft e flCM* follows that 
a0 <= |J 
and therefore that a0 cz £ao.
P<ao
Consider now the parameter-free expression #(x) of one free variable
V«V v[u8XA.V8X=>U8VVUssVVV8u]
A XfuXfv \ll 8 X A V 8 U => V 8 x].
Let the value of this expression in the set Lao be Y9 which is thus the set 
of elements x of Lao for which the following formula, which is relativized 
to £ao, holds.
VwVt; [w e Lao a v e Lao [(« e x a vex) 
(u e v v u = v v v e «)]]
a VuVu [u e Lao a v e Lao -> ((u e x a v e u) -> v e x)].
Seeing that Lao is transitive, an element x of it will satisfy this formula if 
and only if
VuVt; \u e x a v ex u ev v u~v v v e u]
a VwVu [u e x a veu rex] ; 
just, that is, when it is an ordinal.
The value of $(x) in Lao is therefore the set of ordinals belonging to 
Lao. We have proved that a0 anyway is not one of these, and therefore 

84
INTRODUCTION TO AXIOMATIC SET THEORY
no greater ordinal is (since Lao is transitive). Moreover, as shown above, 
a0 ^ao*
As a consequence, 0 (x) takes the value a0 in £ao, so a0 e 
Az0) = ^a0+1 >
which contradicts the definition of a0. |
We can now proceed to check that all the axioms of ZF+AF hold in the 
class L.
Axiom of Extensionality: If a is constructible, its elements are too. So 
this axiom holds.
Union Axiom: Let a be constructible, and a some ordinal for which 
a e £a. As La is transitive, the set b = (J a is a subset of La. Since, more­
over, the value in £a of the expression 3y (y ea a x ey)~ which has one 
free variable x, and a single parameter a, in La by assumption - is clearly 
b9 we can conclude that b e La+1, and that b is constructible.
Power-set Axiom: Let a be constructible, b the set of constructible subsets 
of a. The map x -> od(x) defined on b has some subset of the ordinals 
for its range, and some ordinal a will therefore be an upper bound to 
this subset. So for all xeb we will have od(x)^a, so that b cz La. 
Nothing prevents us from setting a so high that a is a member of La.
Take the expression e x => u 8 a]. It has one free variable, x, one 
parameter a e £a. Its value in La is the set of elements x of £a which are 
subsets of a; b then, by the definition of a. Thus eLa+1, and so b is 
constructible.
Scheme of Replacement: Let R(x, y, a0,..., be a formula of two free 
variables whose parameters a0,..., ak-± are in L; and suppose that, when 
interpreted in L, it defines a functional relation. Within the universe 
this functional relation is defined by the formula L(x) a Lfy) a 
a Rl(x9 y, 
^_x); both domain and range are subclasses of £.
Let b stand for the set of images of the elements of some constructible 
set a under this functional relation. We must show b to be constructible. 
Each element of it certainly is, so pick some ordinal a0 exceeding the 
order of any element of b and big enough for a. aQ,.... to be in 
Lao. Thenft c Lao.

CONSTRUCTIBLE SETS
85
We now take the parameter-free k+2-ary functional relation R(x, y, 
x0,..., Xjt-t), and apply to it the generalized reflection principle (p. 51), 
using the functional relation y=La. This provides us with an ordinal 
/?>a0 such that
VxVyVx0 ...Vxfc-ifx e Lfi a y g
a xoeLp a ... a xk_keLfi (RL(x, y, x0,x^) 
"RL,(x, y, x0,...,x*-i))].
Since a0,..., ak~i e Lp we have
(*) VxVy [x e Lfi a yeLf
-> (Rl(x, y, a0,ak^i) <■+ RLf(x, y, a0,..., a*-i))].
Now the expression rR(u, v, a0,..., has two free variables 
u, v, and parameters a0,e Lp; call it <P(u,v) for short. Thus 
Vai (0, is the set of maps f: {w, u} -> Lp such that jRL/J(/(w),/(r), 
a0,By (*), however, this set is the set of maps f: {w, v} -> Lfi for 
which RL(f(u), f(y), a0,..., Consequently, Val(3w(weaA 
0(w, 10), Z^) is the set of maps /: {u} -► Lp for which 3x(xea a 
7?L(x,/(r), 6Z0,..., flk-i)); so val(3w(we6Z a 0(w, r)), Z^)isjustthesetof 
elements of L which are images of members of a under the functional 
relation RL(x, y, a0,..., in fact, b, in view of the choice of fi. Thus 
b e Lp+1, and is constructible.
Axiom of Infinity: Every ordinal is constructible, as we have seen; so co 
is constructible.
Axiom of Foundation: Let a be constructible and non-empty, and b be 
an element of it of lowest possible order. Every element of b has strictly 
lower order than b itself, so no element of b is an element of a. Thus 
b n a = 0.
We have now proved that all the axioms of ZF+ ^Fhold in L.
Note that the ordinals of L are the ordinals of the universe For all 
ordinals a are constructible, and clearly they all satisfy O«L(a). Con­
versely, a constructible a satisfying OnL(a) is transitive and linearly or­
dered by e; so an ordinal.

INTRODUCTION TO AXIOMATIC SET THEORY
THE AXIOM OF CONSTRUCTIBILITY HOLDS IN L
We must now show that the axiom of constructibility holds in L.
Absolute Formulas: A parameter-free formula ^(x0,..., xft_t) is called 
absolute if it can be obtained by applications of the following rules.
(1) A formula without quantifiers is absolute.
(2) If A and B are absolute, then A v B and A a B are absolute.
(3) Ify4(x, x0,..., x„-i) is absolute then 3x4 (x, x0,..., 
is absolute.
(4) If A(x, y, x0,xn-i) is absolute, then
Vx[xey -+ A(x, y, x0,xn-i)],
a formula with free variables y, x0,..., xn_ t, is absolute.
On the basis of this definition we call a relation absolute if it can be 
defined in by an absolute formula.
Theorem: Let E(x0,..., xft_t) be an absolute formula, W a transitive class 
(that is, VxVy[PF(x) a y e x -> VF(y)]), and W' an extension of

Ew (aQ...., «t-i) true> then EW•••> ak-i) is ais° true. Equivalently,
Vx0...Vxft_1[lF(x0) a ... a W(xk_f)

Proof : The proof is an informal induction on the length of the absolute 
formula E. For quantifier-free E the result is immediate since Ew and 
Ew’ are the same as E.

as required. The same proof works if E is F a G.
If E(x0,..., x^) is 3xF(x, x0,..., Xfc-i), take any 6Z0?...,

So for someain PF we have 
(a, a0,ak-i). By the induction hypothesis
therefore Fw'(a, a0,whence 3x[PF'(x) a Fw'(x9 a09..., 
This isE^^ao,..., ^-i)-
Lastly, suppose that E(y9 x0,..., xfc-i) is Vx[x ey -> F(x, y9 x0,

Then
Vx[PF(x) -> (x 6 b -> Fw(x9 b9 a09..., ak_t))]
which is the same thing as
Vx[x 6 b a W(x) -> Fw(x9 b9 aQ9..., afc-i)] .
But as b is in W9 which is a transitive class, x e b -> PF(x). Moreover, by 
the induction hypothesis, (PF(x) a Fw(x9b9aQ9...9ak-}f) -> Fw\x9b9 
aQ9...9 ak-i). Thus the last inset formula yields
Vx[x 6 b -> Fw'(x9 b9 a0,...,
and so Ew'(b9 CIq9 ..., ak_ i). f
Note that the definition of absolute relation given here is equivalent to 
that of P. Cohen in [2]; it is not the same as K. Godel’s definition in [1].
If the relation G(y, z0,..., ^;-i) and the functional relation y=F(x0, 
Xfc-i) are absolute, then the relation G(F(xQ9 ..., xfc_t), z0,..., z^f) is 
absolute.
The relation in question can be defined by
3y[y = F(x0,...,xt_1) A G(y, z0,zz_t)],
so can be realized by application of rules (2) and (3) to the absolute 
relations given.
In particular, if a is a set for which y = a is equivalent to some absolute 
formula R(y), and if G(y9 zQ,...9 z^) is absolute, then G(a9 zO9..,9 z^J 
is absolute.
For the rest of this section we shall assume the axiom of foundation to 
hold for %9 and our efforts will be directed towards proving that the 
functional relation y = La is absolute. From this it will follow easily that 
the axiom of constructibility holds in L.

INTRODUCTION TO AXIOMATIC SET THEORY
The (singulary) relations On (x) and x = co are absolute.
Nothing has to be proved for the former, since AF holds,1 and so On{x) 
can be written
VwVu \u e x a v e x u e v v u = v v veu]
a Wu [u e x Vv (v e u v e x)] , 
For the latter we simply check the absoluteness of the following relations: 
x=0, defined by Vy(y g x -> y $ x).
y = x u {x}, defined by Vz(z ey -> z = x v z g x) a
x = co, defined by Vz(z e x - z ey) a x ey.
On{x) a 0 g x a Vj [y g x -> j u {y} g x]
a Vj[y gx -> (y = 0 v 3z(y = z u {z}))]. 
We have shown above that certain compositions of absolute relations are 
themselves absolute. Since the functional relation y—La, whose absolute­
ness we are after, is defined by recursion, we shall want to show that func­
tional relations defined recursively from absolute functional relations are 
themselves absolute. And we shall also want to show that the functional 
relation (x) is absolute. These results are the content of the next two 
lemmas.
Lemma: Let y = H(x) be an absolute functional relation whose domain is 
the class of all maps defined on the ordinals. Then the functional relation F 
recursively definedfor every ordinal a by
F(a) = H{F f a)
is absolute.
Proof: We check successively the absoluteness of a dozen or more 
relations.
z = {x, y} :xgzaj>gza W(/gz -> t — x v t=y).
z — <x, y> : z = {{x}, {x, j>}} (composition of absolute functional relations). 
y <= x: Vz [z g y -> z g x].
z — x uy.xczAyczzA W(/gz -► tex v tey),

z=x\y: zcx a W[7 ex -> {t$y <-> t gz)].
z <= xxy: Mt[tez -> 3u3v[ue x a vey a t = (u, u>]].
z ==> xxy: Vw[wgx -> Vr[rGj> -> 3t{tez a f=<w, v>)]].
1 The formula On (a) as written on p. 14 is patently not absolute. What is more, 
it can be shown not to be equivalent, in ZF, to any absolute formula.

z=x x y: the conjunction of the previous two relations.
z maps x into y: z cz x x y a

y=/(x) (a binary functional relation): (/is a map) a <x, y>e/.
We can now write the formula y=F(a) which we are interested in as 
On (a) a 3/[(/ is a map with domain a) a
e a /(/?) = H(f f /?)) a y = H(f)].
If the relation y = H(f) is absolute, so too is this. |
We shall need also the following absolute relations.

a Vt [r e h -> SwMw [<«, v) e g a </, w> e /
a t = <w, w)]].
Now the relation y = La, whose absoluteness is in question, is a functional 
relation defined by recursion. We shall therefore apply the above lemma. 
For the relation y = H(f) we take y= |J II(/(X))’ anc^ we

however, as
Vx [x e dom (/) -> f] (/W) c XI
a Vz[z e y -> 3x[x e dom(/) a z e JI(/(x))]] .
The following lengthy lemma will therefore complete the proof that y = La 
is absolute.
Lemma: The functional relation y=fl(x) ™ absolute.
Proof: As the relations x = 0 andy = x u {x} are absolute, it follows that 
the relations x= 1, x = 2, ... are absolute (by successive composition). As 
~, v, 3, e, =, and y^ are respectively 0, 1,2, 3,4, and the set of natural 
numbers >5, the relations x = ~, x= v, x=H, x = s, x= = , and x=i^ 
(this latter being written x = co\{0, 1, 2, 3, 4}) are absolute. From 
this we can derive the absoluteness of several other relations, as follows.
z=(the set of atomic expressions):
z = ({e} x fx ({ = } x y^ x/)
(a composition of absolute functional relations). 
z= (a functional relation of one argument, fc):
3/ [(/ is a map with domain co) a f (0) = 0 
a Vn [n e co -> f(n + 1) = M (/(n))] a z = f (fc)],
where the functional relation y = M(x) is given by the absolute formula
y = x u J{~} xx]u[{v} xx xx] u [({3} x y^xx].
ze £ (the set of parameter-free expressions): 3k(k e co a z e <ffc). 
z = £: Vfcjfceco -> <£k c z] a Vy[yez -> y e <f].

expression z):

y» = /(y)\{x}] a y = /(z)].

We now have to show that the binary functional relation y=w(F)X is 
absolute. Note that the formula y = YX (three variables, y9 X, Y) is not 
absolute; for if Z is a transitive set, (y = YX)z means that y is the set of 
maps from Y into X that are elements of Z, and clearly there is no reason 
for supposing that y is the set of all maps from Y into X. By the theorem 
on p. 86 then, the formula y = rXis not absolute. Only because w(F) is 
always finite can we expect to get the result we want.
Some more absolute relations first.

In this way the relation y = fJ(X) is shown to be absolute. |
Theorem : The relation y=La is absolute.
It follows at once that the axiom of constructibility holds in L. For since 
ZF+AF holds in the class L, the relation (y = Fa)L is a functional relation. 
Moreover, according to the theorem on p. 86 we have
VyVa[L(y) a L(a) a (y = La)L -> y = Lj,

CONSTRUCTIBLE SETS
93
since L is transitive and y=La is an absolute formula. So let a be some 
object in L. For some a0 then, a e £ao; and since a0 is an ordinal of £, 
there is a unique constructible set yQ for which (yQ=Lao)L holds; as 
(Jo=LX0)L y0=Lxo, we get y0=Lao, so a e y0.
Thus (a e Lao)L is true, and so [3a(a e La)]L is also true.
The axiom of constructibility asserts that the three classes tfl, V, L are 
identical (this axiom therefore implies AF). The axiom of constructibility 
is usually denoted V=L, which is an abbreviation of the formula Vx[F(x) 
<-> £(x)] (when this notation is used, AFis understood to hold). What we 
have shown, therefore, is that if ZFis consistent, then so is ZF+AF+ V=L.
The axiom of constructibility has many important consequences. We 
shall now show that it entails the axiom of choice, in particular - and 
even the choice principle stated on p. 69-, and the generalized continuum 
hypothesis. These two sentences are thus satisfied in L, and therefore 
consistent relative to the remaining axioms.
V=L IMPLIES AC
Consider a universe which satisfies the axiom of constructibility.
With a parameter-free formula we shall define on the class of well­
orderings in % a functional relation v = F(u) having the following property. 
If u is a well-ordering of the set X, F(u) is a well-ordering of the set of 
monadic expressions with parameters in X.
Let £ be the set of parameter-free expressions; it is a subset of Vm9 and 
we have already defined (on p. 41) an injection, itself without parame­
ters, which maps one-one into co. This injection, K~r, is the inverse of 
K, suitably restricted. Let j be the isomorphism from u on to its ordinal a.
A monadic expression with parameters in X is a pair (Jf if) where 
Ee and r\ maps some subset of w(E) into X. If u well-orders X, each 
element of ?/, <x, y), where x e F and y e X, can be associated one-one 
with a pair of ordinals; namely x itself (remember the definition of F as 
co\5) and the ‘place-number’ of y in the well-ordering u of X (that is, 
the ordinal of the well-ordered initial segment Sy(x, w)). This pair 
of ordinals can itself be associated one-one with an ordinal, by the 
isomorphism from On2 on to On, defined on p. 33. Thus q can be asso­
ciated one-one with a finite sequence of ordinals - namely the sequence 

94
INTRODUCTION TO AXIOMATIC SET THEORY
which takes in their natural order the ordinals associated with its elements. 
As a consequence, and using the injection AT -1 noted above, we can find an 
injection from the set of monadic expressions with parameters in X into 
cox a (On), aclass which is well ordered by the well-ordering already defined 
on a (On). In this way we can obtain the well-ordering v of the set of 
monadic expressions with parameters in X.
We can now define recursively on the ordinals a parameter-free func­
tional relation y = B (a) which to each ordinal a associates a well-ordering 
2? (a) of La, such that for Lp is an initial segment of La under B(a); 
and on Lp, B(a) and B(fi) are identical.
For the definition, suppose B(fi) suitably defined for all /?<a; then 
if a is a limit ordinal, La= (J Lp and so we write B(a) = |J B(fi), the 
p<a /3<a
common extension of all the B(ft) for /?<a. If a = /?+!, we use the fact 
that B(P) well-orders Lp, so that Vp — F(B(P)) well-orders the set of mon­
adic expressions whose parameters lie in Lp. For the well-ordering 2?(a) 
of La = n (Lp) we therefore write
x y (mod. B (a)) <-> [x e Lp a y e Lp a x y (mod. B (/?))] 
v [xcLp a y eLa\Lp] 
v [xeLa\L^ a yeLa\Lp a
the first expression defining x in Lp is earlier, in the well-ordering of 
the monadic expressions with parameters in Lp, than the first expression 
defining y in Lp],
It is obvious that the ordering B(a) thus defined on La has all the re­
quired properties.
The functional relation y = B(a) is thus completely defined by recursion. 
A binary relation R(x, y) without parameters which well-orders the whole 
of %is then available from the formula 3a[(?H(a) a x^y (mod. 2?(a))].
This shows that the choice principle holds in %; by a result on p. 69, 
the axiom ‘every set is ordinal definable’ holds also in
V=L IMPLIES THE GENERALIZED CONTINUUM HYPOTHESIS
The proof of this result relies on a certain property of absolute relations, 
dealt with in the next theorem.
Theorem: Let % be a universe where ZF+AF+AC holds, and E(x, y) an

CONSTRUCTIBLE SETS
95
absolute formula defining in % a functional relation y = 0(x) of a single 
argument. Then 0(x) 
(x) + ^for every x in the domain of <P.
Proof: Let a be in the domain of 0, and a an ordinal for which a e Va, 
0(a) e Va, and such that
VxVy[x e Va a y e Va -> (Ev*(x,y)<->E(x y))].
That there is such an ordinal is guaranteed by the reflection principle for 
the formula E(x, y).
Let P stand for the transitive closure of {a}, that is ^({a}). Since 
{a} <= Fa and Fa is transitive, we have P cz Va. Moreover, P=&(a) u {a}, 
soP=&(a) + 1.
Let be the set of all closed expressions that are satisfied in Fa and 
have all their parameters in P. By the Lowenheim/Skolem theorem (pp. 
59-61) there is a subset X of Va, including P, satisfying all the expressions 
in and of cardinality not exceeding P+Ko.
Since Vx is a transitive set, the axiom of extensionality holds in it; so 
the corresponding expression
VxVy [x = y o Vz (z e x <=> z e y)]
is in 
and is therefore satisfied in X. Thus X is an extensional set.
By the corollary on p. 40 we can find an isomorphism j of X on to 
some transitive set T; in consequence, Y will satisfy all the expressions 
in the set which is produced from by replacing each parameter u 
(in P, and so in X) by j(u).
But j(u) = u for every ueP, as can be seen by supposing w0 to be an 
element of P for which j(u0)^u09 and one of least rank at that. For then 
j(y) is equal to v for all v e u0; for P=^({a}) is transitive, so any such 
v e P. However, j(uQ) = { j (y) | v e u0} = uQ, which contradicts the defini­
tion of uQ.
Thus P <= Y, and Y satisfies all the expressions of in addition, 
t=x^p+k0.
We chose Va to mirror the formula P(x, y), so since a and 0(a) are 
both in Va, and E(a, 0(a)) is true, we have also Ev*(a, $(a)). Thus the 
sentence E(a, $(a)) is true in Va, and so 3y£(a, y) is also true in Va. The 
expression r3yE(a, y)n is thus satisfied in 7a, and has a single parameter 

96
INTRODUCTION TO AXIOMATIC SET THEORY
a, in P; so it belongs to and is therefore satisfied in Y. Consequently, 
the formula 3yE(a, y) holds in Y, and for some b e Twe will have EY(a, b).
But as E(x, y) is an absolute formula and Y is a transitive set, we also 
have EY(a, b) E(a, b). Thus E(a, b), and so b — <P(a). But b was in Y, 
so 0(6z)e Y, and Y being transitive, #(a) c: Y. Thus 
and so 0(a)^^(cz) + Ko. |
As a particular case of this theorem, suppose a is an object of defined 
by an absolute formula £(y); in other words, that Vy[y==cz £(y)]; 
thena^K0.
It is enough for our purpose to put x—0 and to apply the above theorem 
to a formula £(y) which does not contain x at all. We can deduce in this 
way that, for example, if ZF+AF+AC holds in then the formula 
y=£P(co) is not equivalent to any absolute formula.
Theorem: Suppose again that ZF+AF+AC holds in 
Then La=a for
every ordinal a co. If a is a constructible set, od(a) ^(cz) + Ko.
Proof: We have seen already that a c La, so that oi^La. To show the 
converse inequality for all a > co we proceed by induction. For co we note 
that Ln— Vn for every n e co (a trivial induction proves this); thus L^V^, 
so £0 = co.
Now La= (J nCM, and by the induction hypothesis if 
co p < a. But for infinite a we have IJ(cz)=a, so
S II(lp)= E 
£ /?<a-a = a.
P<ct 
p<a 
P<a
An alternative proof of this would apply the previous theorem to the 
absolute relation y = La. It is in this way that we demonstrate the second 
part of the theorem.
Recall that od(cz) is the first ordinal a for which cze£a; the relation 
y = od(x) is absolute since it can be written
On (y) a x e Ly a Vz [z g y -> x £z] ,
and the relation y=Lx is absolute. At once then, od(tz)^^(a)+K0. |

CONSTRUCTIBLE SETS
97
With all this achieved, let be a universe satisfying the axiom of con- 
structibility. We have already proved that the axiom of choice holds in 
so the theorems above can be applied. Any set a is constructible, so 
if a cz we have
od(a) <V(^) + No
since cz Thus od(a)<Kp+1, so a e L#p+l. But a is any subset of 
so ^(Kp) c whence ^(Np)<LK/)+1. Thus ^(Kp)<Kp+1.
Cantor’s theorem gives us the reverse inequality, so we can conclude that 
^(Kp) = Kp+1, which is the generalized continuum hypothesis.
As far as arithmetical formulas are concerned, we have an analogue of 
the result obtained in Chapter VI.
If E is an arithmeticalformula (a formula whose quantifiers are relativized 
to VJ that is derivable with the help of the axiom of choice and the generali­
zed continuum hypothesis (and, more generally, the axiom of constructi- 
bility), then E is already derivable from ZF alone.
For K£0 = ££0, as we have seen. A formula E with quantifiers relativized 
to is absolute, and so EL E is a consequence of ZF.
Let, then, Ao,..., An_2, E be a proof of E from ZF+ V=L. If At is 
an axiom, we know that Af is a theorem of ZF. The sequence Aq, ..., 
^n_2, EL is thus a proof of EL from ZF alone. With EL E also a 
theorem of ZF, we see that E itself is a theorem of this theory.
