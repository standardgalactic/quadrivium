A.  Expansion and compression work – the work to raise or lower a piston 
What does a constant pressure compression process look like on a pressure 
volume diagram?  

Shaft work, extension work, electrical work, film work, etc. 

Let’s review - sign conventions for energy transfer: 
Work out of a system is positive, W>0, and work is done 
by the system. 
Work into a system is negative, W<0, and work is done 
on the system. 

If a turbine generates power via shaft work, what is the sign for 
the work done by the system? 

Unit 2 Segment 2 

If a turbine generates power via shaft work, what is 
the sign for the work done by the system? 
Work done by the system is work out of the system 
and should have a positive value (W>0). 

Let do an example of work transfer analysis with numbers. 
We have air in a piston that is undergoes 2 processes in series.   
 In the first step, the air is compressed such a way that the process is described a polytropic, where PVn = constant.  The initial state 
of the air is 100 kPa, 0.04 m3/kg.  The final specific volume at the end of the first process is 0.02 m3/kg.  n = 1.3 
 In the second step, the air is subject to a constant pressure process where the final specific volume is equal to the initial state. 
a) 
sketch the processes on a P-v diagram and label the states, 1, 2 and 3. 
b) 
determine the specific work (work per unit mass of air) for each step and the overall process.

What would the P-v diagram look like if step 
one was a polytropic expansion process?

The First Law of Thermodynamics – relates changes in energy states to work and 
heat transfer. 
The First Law of Thermodynamics defines the conservation of energy. 
The conservation of mass (COM) states that mass can never be destroyed. 
The conservation of energy (COE) states that energy can never be destroyed.  
 
E2-E1 = Q-W 
 
 
 

E2-E1 = Q-W 
the details of COE… 
 
an adiabatic process is one where Q = 0 
E is the total energy of the system 
E = KE + PE + U 
U = the internal energy of the system 
u = the internal energy per mass 

Q 
Q is the energy transfer due to heat transfer 
Q is NOT a property 
Q depends on the process path 
Q>0 is heat transfer into the system 
Q<0 is heat transfer out of the system 
The sign convention for heat transfer is (typically) opposite that of work! 

What’s wrong with this statement: ∫δQ = Q2- Q1? 

Unit 2 Segment 4 

What’s wrong with this statement: ∫δQ = Q2- Q1? 
 
Heat transfer is NOT a system property!  A system does not possess heat or 
work.   The correct notation is ∫δQ = Q = 1Q2 

There are three types of heat transfer: conduction, convection 
and radiation.   
Heat transfer is a discipline in an of itself. 
 

COE can be memorized using the simple 
expression: 
 In – Out = Change 
net heat transfer in – net work transfer out = 
change in system energy (for some time 
interval) 
Can also write COE on a rate basis. 

So we have some ideas on how to quantify Q and W, what about E?  
More specifically, U. 
We need to know the state of the system (at equilibrium), which is 
described by the system properties. 
It was determined a long time ago, that you need 2 independent, 
intensive thermodynamic properties to completely describe the state 
of a simple compressible substance. ß what’s that??? 

What are the 3 phases of matter? 

Unit 2 Segment 5 

What are the 3 phases of matter? 
solid, liquid and gas of course.  The phase of a substance can be 
determined or identified by the state of the substance.  

Lots of definitions now. 
saturation state -  state which begins or ends a phase change 
critical point – defined by the critical temperature and is the maximum 
temperature where liquid and vapor phases can co-exist at 
equilibrium.
