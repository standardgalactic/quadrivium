About the Authors
Alan L. Rubin, MD, is one of the nation’s foremost experts on diabetes. He 
is a professional member of the American Diabetes Association and the 
Endocrine Society and has been in private practice specializing in diabetes 
and thyroid disease for over 30 years. Dr. Rubin was assistant clinical profes­
sor of medicine at University of California Medical Center in San Francisco for 
20 years. He has spoken about diabetes to professional medical audiences 
and nonmedical audiences around the world. He has been a consultant to 
many pharmaceutical companies and companies that make diabetes 
products.
Dr. Rubin was one of the first specialists in his field to recognize the signifi­
cance of patient self-testing of blood glucose, the major advance in diabetes 
care since the advent of insulin. As a result, he has been on numerous radio 
and television programs, talking about the cause, prevention, and treatment 
of diabetes and its complications. His first book, Diabetes For Dummies, now 
in a third edition, is a basic reference for any nonprofessional who wants to 
understand diabetes. It has sold more than 1 million copies and has been 
translated into 15 languages including French, Chinese, Spanish, and Russian. 
He is also the author of Thyroid For Dummies, High Blood Pressure For Dummies, 
Type 1 Diabetes For Dummies, and Prediabetes For Dummies.
Cait L. James, MS, is a Senior Health Educator at Kaiser Permanente in San 
Francisco. After receiving her undergraduate degree in Journalism and Health 
from the University of Oregon, she spent several years counseling clients in 
individualized nutrition and personal fitness plans. Her Master of Science 
degree in Health Education focused on the prevention and treatment of obe­
sity. This led her to Kaiser Permanente’s Pediatric Clinic, working with chil­
dren suffering from or at risk of medical complications due to weight. While 
she now oversees a wide variety of health promotion programs for patients 
and staff, the promotion of healthy nutrition choices continues to be her big­
gest passion. She loves great food and wine, so thankfully she balances it 
with avid running and yoga!


Dedication
This book is dedicated to the great chefs and restaurant owners, especially 
the ones in this book, who spend all their time and creative energy producing 
delicious and nutritious food in a beautiful environment and making sure that 
it is served in a way that complements the taste.
Authors’ Acknowledgments
Acquisitions editor Michael Lewis, who shepherded this third edition 
through all the committees that had to approve it, deserves special commen­
dation. Our project editor, Jennifer Connolly, made certain that the book is 
understandable and readable in the great For Dummies tradition.
Heather Dismore is responsible for most of the discussions of food and the 
organization of the recipes in the book, and she also contributed a number of 
excellent recipes. Her tremendous skill in doing so is apparent in this book 
and in another book that she helped author, Cooking Around the World All-in-
One For Dummies.
Reviewers Dawn Ayers, MD, Emily Nolan, and Patty Santelli did a fantastic job 
of ensuring that the information in the book is accurate.

Introduction
P
eople with diabetes can eat great food! We don’t have to prove that 
statement anymore. The recipes in Dr. Rubin’s previous book, Diabetes 
For Dummies, 3rd Edition (Wiley), and the second edition of this book show 
that people can follow a diabetic diet at home or anywhere they travel and 
still enjoy a five-star meal. They just have to know how to cook it or where to 
go to get it.
More and more eating is being done away from home or, if at home, from 
food in the form of take-out from a local supermarket or restaurant, and 
people with diabetes want to know what they can and can’t eat.
If you bought Diabetes For Dummies, 3rd Edition, you know that you can find 
such food in Chicago, New York City, Santa Monica, and San Francisco. But 
what about the rest of the world? This book is both a cookbook that shows 
you how to prepare great foods in your own home and a guide to eating out 
in restaurants and fast-food places.
Is diet important for a person with diabetes? Do salmon swim upstream? The 
Diabetes Control and Complications Trials showed that a good diabetic diet 
could lower the hemoglobin A1c, a test of overall blood glucose control, by 
over 1 percent. That much improvement will result in a reduction of compli­
cations of diabetes such as eye disease, nerve disease, and kidney disease 
by 25 percent or more. The progression of complications that have already 
started to occur can be significantly slowed.
Of course, there’s much more to managing diabetes than diet alone. In this 
book, you can discover the place of diet in a complete program of diabetes 
care.
This edition will feature a lot more about vegetarian eating. People who eat 
that way tend to be lighter and healthier. Many of the animal protein recipes 
in previous editions will be replaced by vegetarian food. We have tried them 
all, and they are delicious. We hope you will agree.
	
Cherry pie is good. But if you eat a whole lot of it, it’s going to make you sick.

Diabetes Cookbook For Dummies, 3rd Edition 
About This Book
You wouldn’t read a cookbook from cover to cover, and this book is no 
exception to that rule. There’s no reason to read about setting up your 
kitchen if you simply want a place to eat in New York where you can find 
healthy nutrition for your diabetes. You may want to read the first few 
chapters to get an overview of the place of diet in your overall diabetes man­
agement, but if you just need a great entree for tonight’s supper or a great 
restaurant wherever you are, go right to that information. The book is written 
to be understood no matter where you find yourself in it.
Conventions Used in This Book
The recipes in this book are produced in a standard form that tells you what 
you’re cooking, how much you’re cooking, and how to cook it. The prepara­
tion time, cooking time (which is in addition to the prep time), and yield, or 
number of servings, are all presented at the beginning of the recipe, followed 
by a list of ingredients. We suggest that you always read through a recipe 
completely before you start preparing it so that you can make sure you have 
all the ingredients and equipment you need.
Chefs sometimes use exotic ingredients that may not be easily available 
to you. With the permission of the chefs, we have tried to substitute more 
common ingredients. On the other hand, walking into a store that sells spe­
cial ingredients for a Chinese meal or an Indian meal, for example, can be a 
fascinating experience. We always define ingredients that are unfamiliar to 
English-speaking eaters in the introduction to the recipe.
You can find nutrition information at the end of every recipe so that you can 
incorporate the recipe into your nutrition plan. The nutrition information is 
always given in the following order:
	
✓	Kcalories (see Chapter 1)
	
✓	Kcalories from fat
	
✓	Grams of fat
	
✓	Grams of saturated fat
	
✓	Milligrams of cholesterol
	
✓	Milligrams of sodium

3
 Introduction
	
✓	Grams of carbohydrate
	
✓	Grams of fiber
	
✓	Grams of protein
If salt is listed in a recipe as an optional ingredient or listed “to taste,” it isn’t 
figured into the nutritional information; but if a specific amount of salt is 
listed in the recipe, that amount is calculated into the nutritional information. 
Serving sizes are always calculated as the total recipe divided by the number 
of servings listed at the beginning of the recipe.
Here are a few other guidelines to keep in mind about the recipes:
	
✓	All butter is unsalted. Margarine is not a suitable substitute for butter, 
because of the difference in flavor and nutritional value. Butter is a natu­
ral product, while margarine is man-made and contains trans fatty acids.
	
✓	All eggs are large.
	
✓	All flour is all-purpose unless otherwise specified.
	
✓	All milk is lowfat unless otherwise specified.
	
✓	All onions are yellow unless otherwise specified.
	
✓	All pepper is freshly ground black pepper unless otherwise specified.
	
✓	All salt is table salt unless otherwise specified.
	
✓	All mentions of Splenda refer to the regular sugar substitute unless 
Splenda for Baking is specified.
	
✓	All dry ingredient measurements are level — use a dry ingredient mea­
suring cup, fill it to the top, and scrape it even with a straight object, 
such as the flat side of a knife.
	
✓	All temperatures are Fahrenheit. (See Appendix D for information about 
converting temperatures to Celsius.)
	
✓	A handful of recipes that appeared in the first edition of this book are 
featured in this edition and called “Classics” in their recipe names.
	
T	If you need or want vegetarian recipes, scan the list of “Recipes in This 
Chapter” on the first page of each chapter in Part II. A little tomato, 
rather than a triangle, in front of the name of a recipe marks that recipe 
as vegetarian. (See the tomato to the left of this paragraph.)
This isn’t a complete book about diagnosing and treating diabetes and its 
complications. Check out Diabetes For Dummies, 3rd Edition, if you need diag­
nosis and treatment information.

Diabetes Cookbook For Dummies, 3rd Edition 
What You’re Not to Read
All For Dummies books have shaded areas called sidebars. They contain inter­
esting but nonessential information. If you aren’t interested in the nitty-gritty, 
you can skip these sidebars. We promise not to include that information on 
the test.
Foolish Assumptions
The book assumes that you’ve done some cooking, you’re familiar with the 
right knife to use to slice an onion without cutting your finger, and you can 
tell one pot from another. Beyond that, you can find many cooking terms in 
Appendix C at the end of the book.
How This Book Is Organized
The book is divided into five parts to help you incorporate the benefits of a 
good diet into your diabetes management program, while showing you that 
the food can be great.
Part I: Thriving with Diabetes
This part takes you on the road to long life and great health as you incor­
porate the needs of being a person with diabetes into the rest of your life. 
It begins by showing you all aspects of a healthy lifestyle and continues by 
focusing on food and its importance to you. When you cook for a person 
with diabetes (either yourself or a loved one), you must keep some special 
considerations in mind, but this part shows you that a diet for diabetes is an 
excellent diet for anyone. We guide you around the kitchen and take you to 
the supermarket to find out about meal-enhancing ingredients, as well as the 
ones to bypass as you navigate the aisles.
Part II: Healthy Recipes That Taste Great
This part presents recipes from A to Z (apples to zucchini) and everything in 
between. The chapters take you through your eating day, starting with your 
breakfast, providing snacks for midmorning and midafternoon, and offering 
larger meals at lunch and dinner. They end, naturally, with wonderful des­
serts, which show that you’re not doomed to give up what you may consider 

5
 Introduction
the best part of the meal. You just need to be careful about calories. In this 
part, we feature the recipes from the great restaurants that have participated 
in the creation of this book.
Part III: Eating Away from Home
In this book, we can’t cover every city and every restaurant you may visit. 
What do you do if you find yourself without a suggestion from this book? 
Part III tells you how to eat well and stay healthy wherever you are. You can 
always visit a fast-food franchise, but a lot of that food isn’t good for you. 
If you pick and choose well, however, you’ll be able to select a meal even 
when your only choice is the one fast-food restaurant off the next exit on the 
freeway.
Part IV: The Part of Tens
We love to help you solve your problems in groups of ten. If you have 13 
problems, you’ll just have to wait for the next book to solve the last 3. In 
this part, we provide ten steps to improve your eating habits and ten food 
substitutions that you can easily make within a recipe. You can explore ten 
strategies to normalize your blood glucose and ten ways to promote healthy 
eating in children.
Part V: Appendixes
Appendix A has info about the restaurants that provided many of the deli­
cious recipes in this book. You find out about their particular style of cook­
ing and the chefs who make this possible. Appendix B contains a glossary 
of key cooking terms. In Appendix C, you can find guidelines if you want to 
substitute other sweeteners for sugar, as well as cooking equivalents, such as 
how many tablespoons make up a cup. Appendix D offers other resources in 
books and on the Web for recipes and nutritional information for people with 
diabetes.
Icons Used in This Book
The icons in this book are like bookmarks, pointing out information that 
we think is especially important. You may want to pick out one particular 
icon that appeals to you. For example, if you like stories about people, the 
Anecdote icon is for you. The Anecdote icon points you to a lot of interesting 

6
Diabetes Cookbook For Dummies, 3rd Edition 
stories about others with diabetes and how they cope with their diets. If your 
interests lie in the direction of very mild fear, look for the Warning icon. Here 
are the icons used in this book:
	
We use this icon whenever Dr. Rubin tells a story about his patients.
	
Whenever we want to emphasize the importance of the current information to 
your nutritional plan, we use this icon.
	
When you see the Remember icon, pay special attention because the informa­
tion is essential.
	
This icon flags situations when you should see your doctor (for example, if 
your blood glucose level is too high or you need a particular test done).
	
This helpful icon marks important information that can save you time and 
energy.
	
Watch for this icon; it warns about potential problems (for example, the pos­
sible results if you don’t treat a condition).
Where to Go from Here
Where you go from here depends on your immediate needs. If you want an 
introduction to the place of nutrition in diabetes management, start with 
Chapter 1. If you are hungry and want some lunch, go to Chapter 8 or 9. If you 
are about to travel or eat out, head for Part III. At any time, the Part of Tens 
can provide useful tips for healthy eating. Finally, the appendixes help you 
cook for yourself or choose a restaurant. Feel free to jump around, but take 
the time to go through Part II so that you realize that diabetes and great food 
are not mutually exclusive.

with Diabetes
In This Chapter
▶	Getting a grip on diabetes
▶	Controlling calories
▶	Working exercise into your schedule
▶	Keeping your blood pressure down
▶	Making lifestyle changes that count
S
ince the second edition of Diabetes Cookbook For Dummies came out, 
there have been a number of studies that indicate that a vegetarian diet 
may be beneficial in the prevention and treatment of diabetes. In this new 
edition, we provide some of the rationale for that type of diet. You will also 
find 28 new recipes from some of the finest vegetarian restaurants in the 
country. They and the older vegetarian recipes will be marked with a tomato.
In this chapter, you get the latest information about what diabetes means, 
how diabetes is diagnosed, and the things you need to do to thrive with dia­
betes. Don’t waste another minute. Get started right away. 
Recognizing Diabetes
With so much diabetes around these days, you may think that recognizing it 
should be easy. The truth is that it’s not easy, because diabetes is defined by 
blood tests. You can’t just look at someone and know the level of glucose — 
blood sugar — in his or her blood.

10
Part I: Thriving with Diabetes 
Diabetes by the numbers
The level of glucose that means you have diabetes is as follows:
	
✓	A casual blood glucose of 200 milligrams per deciliter (mg/dl) or more at 
any time of day or night, along with symptoms such as fatigue, frequent 
urination and thirst, slow healing of skin, urinary infections, and vaginal 
itching in women. A normal casual blood glucose should be between 70 
and 139 mg/dl.
	
✓	A fasting blood glucose of 126 mg/dl or more after no food for at least 
eight hours. A normal fasting blood glucose should be less than 100 mg/dl.
	
✓	A blood glucose of 200 mg/dl or greater two hours after consuming 75 
grams of glucose.
	
A diagnosis of diabetes requires at least two abnormal levels on two different 
occasions. Don’t accept a lifelong diagnosis of diabetes on the basis of a 
single test.
A fasting blood glucose between 100 and 125 mg/dl or casual blood glucose 
between 140 and 199 mg/dl is prediabetes. See Dr. Rubin’s book Prediabetes 
For Dummies (Wiley). Most people with prediabetes will develop diabetes 
within ten years. Although people with prediabetes don’t usually develop 
small blood vessel complications of diabetes like blindness, kidney failure, 
and nerve damage, they’re more prone to large vessel disease like heart 
attacks and strokes, so you want to get that level of glucose down. Sixty 
million people in the United States have prediabetes.
Types of diabetes
The following list describes the three main types of diabetes:
	
✓	Type 1 diabetes: This used to be called juvenile diabetes or insulin-
dependent diabetes. It mostly begins in childhood and results from the 
body’s self-destruction of its own pancreas. The pancreas is an organ of 
the body that sits behind the stomach and makes insulin, the chemical 
or “hormone” that gets glucose into cells where it can be used. You can’t 
live without insulin, so people with type 1 diabetes must take insulin 
shots. Of the 24 million Americans with diabetes, about 10 percent have 
type 1.
	
✓	Type 2 diabetes: Once called adult-onset diabetes, type 2 used to begin 
around the age of 40, but it is occurring more often in children, many of 
whom are getting heavier and heavier and exercising less and less. The 
problem in type 2 diabetes is not a total lack of insulin, as occurs in type 
1, but a resistance to the insulin, so that the glucose still doesn’t get into 
cells but remains in the blood.

11
 Chapter 1: What It Means to Thrive with Diabetes
	
✓	Gestational diabetes: This type of diabetes is like type 2 diabetes but 
occurs in women during pregnancy, when a lot of chemicals in the mother’s 
blood oppose the action of insulin. About 4 percent of all pregnancies are 
complicated by gestational diabetes. If the mother isn’t treated to lower 
the blood glucose, the glucose gets into the baby’s bloodstream. The baby 
produces plenty of insulin and begins to store the excess glucose as fat in 
all the wrong places. If this happens, the baby may be larger than usual and 
therefore may be hard to deliver. When the baby is born, he is cut off from 
the large sugar supply but is still making lots of insulin, so his blood glucose 
can drop severely after birth. The mother is at risk of gestational diabetes in 
later pregnancies and of type 2 diabetes as she gets older.
	
✓	Other types: A small group of people with diabetes suffer from one of 
these much less common varieties of diabetes:
 
• Latent autoimmune diabetes on adults (LADA), which has charac­
teristics of both type 1 and type 2 diabetes
 
• Genetic defects of the beta cell, which makes insulin
 
• Medications that affect insulin action like cortisol or prednisone
 
• Diseases or conditions that damage the pancreas like pancreatitis 
or cystic fibrosis
 
• Genetic defects in insulin action
Consequences of diabetes
If your blood glucose isn’t controlled — that is, kept between 70 and 139 mg/
dl after eating or under 100 mg/dl fasting — damage can occur to your body. 
The damage can be divided into three categories: irritations, short-term com­
plications, and long-term complications.
Irritations
Irritations are mild and reversible but still unpleasant results of high blood 
glucose levels. The levels aren’t so high that the person is in immediate life-
threatening danger. The most important of these irritations are the following:
	
✓	Blurred vision
	
✓	Fatigue
	
✓	Frequent urination and thirst
	
✓	Genital itching, especially in females
	
✓	Gum and urinary tract infections
	
✓	Obesity
	
✓	Slow healing of the skin

12
Part I: Thriving with Diabetes 
Short-term complications
These complications can be very serious and lead to death if not treated. 
They’re associated with very high levels of blood glucose — in the 400s and 
above. The three main short-term complications are the following:
	
✓	Ketoacidosis: This complication is found mostly in type 1 diabetes. It 
is a severe acid condition of the blood that results from lack of insulin, 
the hormone that is missing. The patient becomes very sick and will die 
if not treated with large volumes of fluids and large amounts of insulin. 
After the situation is reversed, however, the patient is fine.
	
✓	Hyperosmolar syndrome: This condition is often seen in neglected 
older people. Their blood glucose rises due to severe dehydration and 
the fact that the kidneys of the older population can’t get rid of glucose 
the way younger kidneys can. The blood becomes like thick syrup. The 
person can die if large amounts of fluids aren’t restored. They don’t 
need that much insulin to recover. After the condition is reversed, these 
people can return to a normal state.
	
✓	Hypoglycemia or low blood glucose: This complication happens when 
the patient is on a drug like insulin or a pill that drives the glucose down 
but isn’t getting enough food or is getting too much exercise. After it 
falls below 70 mg/dl, the patient begins to feel bad. Typical symptoms 
include sweating, rapid heartbeat, hunger, nervousness, confusion, and 
coma if the low glucose is prolonged. Glucose by mouth, or by venous 
injection if the person is unconscious, is the usual treatment. This com­
plication usually causes no permanent damage.
Long-term complications
These problems occur after ten or more years of poorly controlled diabetes 
or, in the case of the macrovascular complications, after years of prediabetes 
or diabetes. They have a substantial impact on quality of life. After these 
complications become established, reversing them is hard, but treatment is 
available for them early in their course, so watch for them five years after 
your initial diagnosis of diabetes. See Dr. Rubin’s book Diabetes For Dummies, 
3rd Edition (Wiley), for information on screening for these complications.
The long-term complications are divided into two groups: microvascular, 
which are due at least in part to small blood vessel damage, and macrovascu­
lar, associated with damage to large blood vessels.
Microvascular complications include the following:
	
✓	Diabetic retinopathy: Eye damage that leads to blindness if untreated.
	
✓	Diabetic nephropathy: Kidney damage that can lead to kidney failure.

13
 Chapter 1: What It Means to Thrive with Diabetes
	
✓	Diabetic neuropathy: Nerve damage that results in many clinical symp­
toms, the most common of which are tingling and numbness in the feet. 
Lack of sensation in the feet can result in severe injury without aware­
ness unless you carefully look at your feet regularly. Such injury can 
result in infection and even amputation.
Macrovascular complications also occur in prediabetes and consist of the 
following:
	
✓	Arteriosclerotic heart disease: Blockage of the blood vessels of the 
heart. This is the most common cause of death in diabetes due to a 
heart attack.
	
✓	Arteriosclerotic cerebrovascular disease: Blockage of blood vessels to 
the brain, resulting in a stroke.
	
✓	Arteriosclerotic peripheral vascular disease involving the blood ves­
sels of the legs: These vessels can become clogged and result in ampu­
tation of the feet or legs.
	
If you control your blood glucose, none of these complications need ever 
occur. Controlling your blood pressure and your cholesterol also helps pre­
vent these complications.
Treating diabetes
Treatment of diabetes involves three essential elements:
	
✓	Diet: If you follow the recommendations in this book, you can lower 
your average blood glucose by as much as 30 to 50 mg/dl. Doing so can 
reduce the complication rate by as much as 33 percent.
	
✓	Exercise: We touch on exercise in Chapter 3 and cover it more exten­
sively in Diabetes For Dummies, 3rd Edition (Wiley).
	
✓	Medication: Diabetes medications abound — there are far too many to 
discuss here, but you can find out about them in Diabetes For Dummies, 
3rd Edition.
Controlling Calories
Just as the three most important factors in the value of a house are location, 
location, location, the three most important factors in diet for people with 
diabetes are moderation, moderation, moderation. If you’re overweight or 
obese, which is true of most people with type 2 diabetes and a lot of people 
with type 1 diabetes who are on intensive insulin treatment (four shots of 

14
Part I: Thriving with Diabetes 
insulin daily), weight loss will make a huge difference in your blood glucose 
levels. If you maintain the weight loss, you’ll avoid the complications of dia­
betes discussed earlier in this chapter.
To successfully lose weight, you need to control your total calories. You 
must burn up the same amount of calories you take in by mouth, or you will 
gain weight. To lose weight, you need to burn up more calories than you 
eat. Sounds simple, eh! And it doesn’t matter where the calories come from. 
Studies that compare diets low in fats, proteins, or carbohydrates result in 
the same weight loss after a year.
	
As you reduce your portions, reduce your intake of added sugars, fats, and 
alcohol. These items contain no nutrients such as vitamins and minerals and 
are simply sources of empty calories.
	
If you are predisposed to have diabetes because, for example, your parents 
both had diabetes, you can prevent it by maintaining a healthy weight. If you 
already have diabetes, you can minimize its impact by losing weight and keep­
ing it off.
Do you need a highly complicated formula to figure out how to moderate 
your food intake? No! It’s as simple as looking at the portions you currently 
eat and cutting them in half. At home, where you control the amount of food 
on your plate, you can start with a small portion, so you may not need to 
reduce it by half. However, in restaurants, where more and more people are 
eating their meals, especially the fast-food restaurants, discussed extensively 
in Chapters 17 and 18, the rule of eating half may not be strong enough. 
There you may need to eat only a third of the portion. You may need to apply 
the same portion control when you eat at someone else’s home. Figure 1-1 
shows you the difference between reasonably sized portions and ones that 
are too big.
Use these tips to help you visualize portion sizes:
	
✓	An ounce of meat is the size of a pack of matches.
	
✓	Three ounces of meat is the size of a deck of cards.
	
✓	A medium fruit is the size of a tennis ball.
	
✓	A medium potato is the size of a computer mouse.
	
✓	A medium bagel is the size of a hockey puck.
	
✓	An ounce of cheese is the size of a domino.
	
✓	A cup of fruit is the size of a baseball.
	
✓	A cup of broccoli is the size of a light bulb.

Figure 1-1: 
Eating in 
modera-
tion means 
choosing 
the portion 
sizes on the 
left, rather 
than those 
on the right.
	
You don’t need to take in many extra calories over time to gain weight. Just 
100 extra kilocalories (see the “Kilocalories versus calories” sidebar for an 
explanation of kilocalories) on a daily basis results in a weight gain of 12 
pounds in a year. An extra glass of wine is that many kilocalories. On the 
other hand, if you reduce your daily intake by 100 kilocalories, you can lose 
those 12 pounds over a year.
Look at a few examples of the portion sizes provided today compared to 20 
years ago. Table 1-1 shows the kilocalories in the portions of 20 years ago 
and today and how much exercise you have to do to burn up the extra kilo­
calories so you don’t gain weight.

Part I: Thriving with Diabetes 
Including Exercise (And Rest)
Exercise is just as important as diet in controlling your blood glucose. A 
group of people who were expected to develop diabetes because their par­
ents both had diabetes was asked to walk 30 minutes a day. Eighty percent of 
those who did walk did not develop the disease. These people didn’t neces­
sarily lose weight, but they did exercise.
	
Too many people complain that they just can’t find the time to exercise. But 
a recent study showed that just 71⁄2 minutes of highly intense exercise a week 
had a profound effect on the blood glucose. So this excuse isn’t acceptable, 
especially when you realize how much difference exercise can make in your 
life and your diabetes. Here are some ways that different amounts of exercise 
can help you:
	
✓	Thirty minutes of exercise a day will get you in excellent physical shape 
and reduce your blood glucose substantially.
	
✓	Sixty minutes of exercise a day will help you to maintain weight loss and 
get you in even better physical shape. 
	
✓	Ninety minutes of exercise a day will cause you to lose weight.
	
An exercise partner helps ensure that you get out and do your thing. We find 
it extremely helpful to have someone waiting for us so that we can exercise 
together.
Here are some more facts about exercise to keep in mind:
	
✓	You don’t have to get in all your minutes of exercise in one session. Two 
30-minute workouts are just as good as and possibly better than one 
60-minute workout.
	
✓	Although walking is excellent exercise, especially for the older popula­
tion, the benefits of more vigorous exercise and for a longer time are 
greater still.
Kilocalories versus calories
I use the term kilocalories (or kcalories) rather 
than calories because experts in health and 
medicine measure energy in a diet plan or in 
food in kilocalories (a kilocalorie is 1,000 times 
greater than a calorie). Unfortunately, the term 
calories has been established on food labels 
and in diets, and health officials don’t want to 
confuse the public by attempting to correct this 
error.
Calorie counts in the text of this book and in the 
nutritional analyses of the recipes are given in

 Chapter 1: What It Means to Thrive with Diabetes
	
✓	Everything counts when it comes to exercise. Your decision to take the 
stairs instead of the elevator may not seem like much, but if you do so 
day after day, it makes a profound difference. Another suggestion that 
may help over time is to park your car farther from your office or bike to 
the office.
	
✓	A pedometer (a small gadget worn on your belt that counts your steps) 
may help you to achieve your exercise goals. The objective is to get up 
to 10,000 steps a day by increasing your step count every week.
You also want to do something to strengthen your muscles. Larger muscles 
take in more glucose, providing another way of keeping it under control. 
You’ll be surprised by how much your stamina will increase and how much 
your blood glucose will fall.
	
Place a daily limit on activities that are completely sedentary, such as watch­
ing television or surfing the Web. Use the time you might have once spent on 
these activities to exercise. This advice is especially helpful for overweight 
children who should be limited to two hours a day.
You want to be active, but don’t do it at the cost of getting plenty of rest each 
day. People who sleep eight hours a night tend to be less hungry and leaner 
than people who sleep less.
Of course, it is possible to overdo it. One French diplomat found the phenomenal 
energy of President Theodore Roosevelt too much for him. After two sets of 
tennis at the White House, Roosevelt invited him to go jogging. Then they had a 
workout with a medicine ball. “What would you like to do now?” the president 
asked his guest when his enthusiasm for the exercise seem to be flagging. “If it’s 
all the same to you,” gasped the exhausted Frenchman, “lie down and die.”
Keeping up to speed on treatment developments
By the time you read this book, several months 
will have passed since we wrote these words. 
Several important discoveries about diabetes or 
related medical information may have occurred 
that you need to know about. How can you keep 
up with the latest and greatest treatments?
	✓	Take a course with a certified diabetes edu­
cator (CDE). Here you learn how to manage 
your diabetes right now and find out about 
what’s coming up.
	✓	Go to the Web and do a search for diabe­
tes. If you want to be sure that the sites you 
come up with are both accurate and helpful, 
go to his Web site, www.drrubin.com, 
where you’ll find a page on Useful Diabetes 
Related Web sites. He has checked all of 
them out for you, so you know you can rely 
on them.
	✓	Come to your doctor prepared to ask ques­
tions. If you don’t get a satisfactory answer, 
see a specialist.
	✓	Take another certified course after several 
years. You’ll be amazed at the changes.

Controlling Your Blood Pressure
Keeping your blood pressure in check is particularly important in preventing 
the macrovascular complications of diabetes. But elevated blood pressure 
also plays a role in bringing on eye disease, kidney disease, and neuropathy. 
You should have your blood pressure tested every time you see your doctor. 
The goal is to keep your blood pressure under 130/80. (See Dr. Rubin’s book 
High Blood Pressure For Dummies, 2nd edition, published by Wiley, for a com­
plete explanation of the meaning of these numbers.) You may want to get 
your own blood pressure monitor so that you can check it at home yourself.
The statistics about diabetes and high blood pressure are daunting. Seventy-
one percent of diabetics have high blood pressure, but almost a third are 
unaware of it. Almost half of them weren’t being treated for high blood pres­
sure. Among the treated patients, less than half were treated in a way that 
reduced their pressure to lower than 130/80.
You can do plenty of things to lower your blood pressure, including losing 
weight, avoiding salt, eating more fruits and vegetables, and, of course, exer­
cising. But if all else fails, your doctor may prescribe medication. Many blood 
pressure medicines are available, and one or two will be exactly right for you. 
See High Blood Pressure For Dummies, 2nd Edition, for an extensive discus­
sion of the large number of blood pressure medications.
	
One class of drugs in particular is very useful for people with diabetes with high 
blood pressure: angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACE inhibitors), 
which are especially protective of your kidneys. If kidney damage is detected 
early, ACE inhibitors can reverse the damage. Some experts believe that all 
diabetics should take ACE inhibitors. We believe that if there’s no evidence of 
kidney damage and the diabetes is well controlled, this isn’t necessary.
Considering the Rest of Your Lifestyle
Diabetes is just one part of your life. It can affect the rest of your lifestyle, how­
ever, and your lifestyle certainly affects your diabetes. In this section, we take 
up some of these other parts of your lifestyle, all of which you can alter to the 
benefit of your health and your diabetes. Try making changes one at a time, 
and when you think you have that one under control, move on to the next.
Drinking alcohol safely
A glass of wine is a pleasant addition to dinner, and studies show that alcohol 
in moderation can lower the risk of a heart attack. For a diabetic, it is espe­
cially important that food accompany the wine because alcohol reduces the 

19
 Chapter 1: What It Means to Thrive with Diabetes
blood glucose; a complication called hypoglycemia may occur (see the sec­
tion “Short-term complications,” earlier in this chapter).
	
Never drink alcohol without food, especially when you’re taking glucose-
lowering medication.
The following people should not drink alcohol at all:
	
✓	Pregnant women
	
✓	Women who are breastfeeding
	
✓	Children and adolescents
	
✓	People who take medications that interact with alcohol
	
✓	People with medical conditions that are worsened by alcohol, such as 
liver disease and certain diseases of the pancreas
The amount of wine that is safe on a daily basis is a maximum of two 4-ounce 
glasses for a man or one 4-ounce glass for a woman. Men metabolize alcohol 
more rapidly than women, so they can drink more. But you should drink no 
more than a maximum of five days out of seven.
In terms of alcohol content, 11⁄2 ounces of hard liquor, such as gin, rum, 
vodka, or whisky, or 12 ounces of light beer are the equivalent of a 4-ounce 
glass of wine.
	
Alcohol adds calories without any nutrition. Alcohol has no vitamins or min­
erals, but you do have to account for the calories in your diet. If you stop 
drinking alcohol, you may lose a significant amount of weight. For example, 
a person who has been drinking three drinks a night and stops will lose 26 
pounds in a year.
Alcohol can cause cirrhosis of the liver and raises blood pressure. It also 
worsens diabetic neuropathy. Do you need any more reasons not to drink 
alcohol?
In addition to drinking alcohol in moderation, here are major ways you can 
improve the rest of your lifestyle:
	
✓	Avoid tobacco in any form. It is the number-one killer.
	
✓	Avoid illicit drugs.
	
✓	Drive safely.
	
✓	Benefit from relationships.
	
✓	Maintain your sense of humor.

▶	Eating enough micronutrients (vitamins and minerals)
▶	Timing your food
O
besity is getting bigger. As defined by a body mass index of 30 m2 or 
greater, the percent of Americans who were obese went from 23.9 in 
2005 to 25.6 in 2007. During the same period, the prevalence of people with a 
diagnosis of diabetes went from 20.8 million in 2005 to 23.6 million in 2007.
The United States must reverse this trend. Otherwise, millions of people will 
become blind, develop kidney failure, and require amputations. In addition, 
millions of people will become heart attack victims, many of whom will not 
survive their first heart attack.
Diet can lower the hemoglobin A1c, a measure of the average glucose in the 
blood for the last 90 days, by 1 percent or more. For every 1 percent reduc­
tion in hemoglobin A1c, there is a 33 percent reduction in complications of 
diabetes. See Diabetes For Dummies, 3rd Edition (Wiley), for more informa­
tion on hemoglobin A1c.
This chapter tells you how much to eat, what to eat, and when to eat. 
Because most people with diabetes are overweight, I provide advice so that 
eating healthy becomes a way of life for you. And don’t forget the important 
value of exercise, particularly “skipping” soda, “skipping” fatty foods, and 
“skipping” desserts.

22
Part I: Thriving with Diabetes 
	
The first thing you need to know when you plan your diet is how much you 
should be eating. To find out how many kilocalories (commonly called calo­
ries) you need, you have to do a little math. Chapter 3 shows you how to 
determine your ideal weight and the number of kilocalories you need, depend­
ing on your lifestyle and weight goals.
After you know your total calorie intake objective, break it down into the 
three sources of energy: carbohydrates, protein, and fat.
Considering a Vegetarian Diet
The evidence for the benefits of vegetarian eating for your health is growing. 
There are several degrees of vegetarian eating:
	
✓	Vegan leaves out all animal meats and products including dairy.
	
✓	Lacto-ovo vegetarian includes eggs, milk, and milk products.
	
✓	Pesco-vegetarian includes fish with eggs, milk, and milk products.
A study in the May 2009 issue of Diabetes Care compared the eating patterns 
in Seventh Day Adventists, a group in whom there were different patterns of 
vegetarianism. The study found that the group that followed a vegan diet had 
the lowest average body mass index (BMI), 23.6, while lacto-ovo vegetarians 
had a BMI of 25.7, pesco-vegetarians had a BMI of 26.3, and nonvegetarians 
had an average BMI of 28.8. The prevalence of diabetes increased from 2.9 
percent in vegans to 7.6 percent in nonvegetarians.
A second key study in the March 2007 issue of The Archives of Internal 
Medicine looked at 322,263 men and 223,390 women who provided detailed 
histories of their diet and other habits including smoking, exercise, alco­
hol consumption, education, weight, and family history of cancer. Over the 
course of ten years, 47,976 men and 23,276 women died. Their meat con­
sumption varied from 1 ounce to 4 ounces a day and processed meat (like 
hot dogs, salami, etc.) ranged from once a week to one and one half ounces a 
day. The number of excess deaths attributed to high meat consumption was 
large. The authors drew the following conclusions:
	
✓	If these groups are representative of all Americans, over the course of a 
decade, the deaths of 1 million men and half a million women could be 
prevented by eating less red and processed meats.
	
✓	People should eat a hamburger only once or twice a week maximum.
	
✓	People should eat steak only once a week maximum.
	
✓	People should eat processed meats less than once in six weeks.

23
 Chapter 2: How What You Eat Affects Your Diabetes
The study didn’t begin to calculate the benefits to the environment of pro­
ducing much less meat, which are enormous.
As a result of studies like these and many others, we are emphasizing veg­
etarian eating much more in this edition and may, perhaps, publish a whole 
edition of vegetarian recipes. Whether you will benefit is entirely up to you.
Calculating Carbohydrates — 
Precursors of Glucose
When you eat a meal, the immediate source of glucose in your blood comes 
from the carbohydrates in that meal. One group of carbohydrates is the 
starches, such as cereals, grains, pastas, breads, crackers, starchy veg­
etables, beans, peas, and lentils. Fruits make up a second major source of 
carbohydrate. Milk and milk products contain not only carbohydrate but 
also protein and a variable amount of fat, depending on whether the milk is 
whole, lowfat, or fat-free. Other sources of carbohydrate include cakes, cook­
ies, candies, sweetened beverages, and ice cream. These foods also contain a 
variable amount of fat.
	
To determine what else is found in food, check a source such as The 
Official Pocket Guide to Diabetic Exchanges, published by the American 
Diabetes Association and the American Dietetic Association, or The Diabetes 
Carbohydrate and Fat Gram Guide, published by the American Diabetes 
Association.
Determining the amount of carbohydrate
How much carbohydrate should you have in your diet? The current recom­
mendation is between 40 to 65 percent of daily calories. In our experience, 
those who keep their carbohydrate intake on the lower side of that range 
have less trouble controlling their blood glucose levels and maintaining 
lower levels of blood fats. Your registered dietitian may recommend more. 
We wouldn’t argue as long as you can maintain satisfactory blood glucose 
levels while not increasing the level of triglyceride, a blood fat.
Considering the glycemic index
	
The various carbohydrate sources differ in the degree to which they raise the 
blood glucose. This difference is called the glycemic index (GI), and it refers to 
the glucose-raising power of a food compared with white bread.

24
Part I: Thriving with Diabetes 
In general, choose foods with a lower glycemic index in order to keep the 
rise in blood glucose to a minimum. Predicting the glycemic index of a mixed 
meal (one that contains an appetizer, a main dish, and a dessert) is nearly 
impossible, but you can make some simple substitutions to lower the glyce­
mic index of your diet, as shown in Table 2-1.
Table 2-1	
Simple Diet Substitutions to Lower GI
High GI foods
Low GI foods
Whole meal or white bread
Whole-grain bread
Processed breakfast cereal
Unrefined cereals like oats or processed 
low-GI cereals
Plain cookies and crackers
Cookies made with dried fruits or whole 
grains like oats
Cakes and muffins
Cakes and muffins made with fruits, oats, 
and whole grains
Tropical fruits like bananas
Temperate-climate fruits like apples and 
plums
Potatoes
Pasta or legumes
Rice
Basmati or other low-GI rice
Many of these lower glycemic index foods contain a lot of fiber. Fiber is a 
carbohydrate that can’t be broken down by digestive enzymes, so it doesn’t 
raise blood glucose and adds no calories. Fiber has been shown to reduce 
the risk of coronary heart disease and diabetes while it improves bowel func­
tion, preventing constipation. For the person who has diabetes already, fiber 
reduces blood glucose levels. The riper the fruit, the higher the GI.
	
If a food has a lot of fiber in it (more than 5 grams per serving), you can sub­
tract the grams of fiber from the grams of carbohydrates in that food in deter­
mining the calories from carbohydrate.
The best sources of fiber are fruits, whole grains, and vegetables, especially 
the legumes. Animal food sources don’t provide fiber. It is recommended that 
you consume 25 grams of fiber daily. Table 2-2 shows some sources of larger 
amounts of fiber.

Fiber can be present in two forms:
	
✓	Insoluble: It doesn’t dissolve in water but stays in the intestine as rough­
age, which helps to prevent constipation; for example, fiber found in 
whole-grain breads and cereals, and the skin of fruits and vegetables.
	
✓	Soluble: It dissolves in water and enters the blood, where it helps lower 
glucose and cholesterol; for example, fiber found in barley, brown rice, 
and beans, as well as vegetables and fruits.
	
You can take a spoonful of sugar in your coffee and have a little sugar in your 
food, but be aware of the number of calories you are adding with no micro­
nutrients (vitamins and minerals present in tiny amounts but essential). See 
“Monitoring Your Micronutrients,” later in this chapter, for more info.
Choosing sugar substitutes
Although people with diabetes are allowed to have some sugar in their diet, 
sugar is more appropriate for a diabetic who is at normal weight than an 
obese diabetic. Preventing obesity may be a matter of avoiding as little as 50 
extra calories a day. If this can be accomplished by using artificial sweeten­
ers, which provide sweetening power but no calories, so much the better.
	
Some of the recipes in this book call for 1⁄4 cup or more of sugar. These are per­
fect opportunities to use a sugar substitute and significantly lower the calories 
from sugar.
Kilocalorie-containing sweeteners
Several sugars besides sucrose (table sugar) are present in food. These 
sugars have different properties than glucose, are taken up differently from 
the intestine, and raise the blood level at a slower rate or not at all if they’re 
not ultimately converted into glucose. They sometimes cause diarrhea.
	
Although these kilocalorie-containing sweeteners are sweeter than sugar and 
you use them in smaller amounts, they do have calories that you must count 
in your daily intake.

26
Part I: Thriving with Diabetes 
The following sweeteners contain kilocalories but act differently in the body 
than sucrose:
	
✓	Fructose, found in fruits and berries: Fructose is sweeter than table 
sugar and is absorbed more slowly than glucose, so it raises the glucose 
level more slowly. When it enters the bloodstream, it is taken up by the 
liver, where it is converted to glucose.
	
✓	Xylitol, found in strawberries and raspberries: Xylitol is also sweeter 
than table sugar and has fewer kilocalories per gram. It is absorbed 
more slowly than sugar. When used in gum, for example, it reduces the 
occurrence of dental caries (tooth decay).
	
✓	Sorbitol and mannitol, sugar alcohols occurring in plants: Sorbitol and 
mannitol are half as sweet as table sugar and have little effect on blood 
glucose. They change to fructose in the body.
Sweeteners without calories
This group of non-nutritive or artificial sweeteners (with the exception of 
Stevia, which comes from a plant) is much sweeter than table sugar and con­
tains no calories at all. Much less of these sweeteners will provide the same 
level of sweetness as a larger amount of sugar. However, the taste of some of 
them may seem a little “off” compared to sugar or honey. They include the 
following:
	
✓	Saccharin: This has 300 to 400 times the sweetening power of sugar, and 
it is heat stable so it can be used in baking and cooking. Brand names for 
saccharin are Sucaryl, SugarTwin, and Sweet’N Low.
	
✓	Aspartame: This is more expensive than saccharin, but people often prefer 
its taste. It is 150 to 200 times as sweet as sugar. Equal and Sweetmate are 
two of the brands. It loses its sweetening power when heated, so it can’t be 
used if food has to be cooked for longer than 20 minutes.
	
✓	Acesulfame-K: This is 200 times sweeter than sugar and is heat stable, 
so it is used in baking and cooking.
	
✓	Stevia: This is 250 to 300 times sweeter than sugar. It was approved by 
the FDA in 2008 and marketed as Rebiana in Coca-Cola.
	
✓	Sucralose: This sweetener, which is made from sugar, is 600 times 
sweeter than its parent, sucrose. The brand name is Splenda. It remains 
stable when heated and has become a favorite sweetener in the food 
industry. Because foods don’t bake the same when made with Splenda, a 
combination of Splenda and sugar called “Pure Magic” is sold to reduce 
calories while providing the baking characteristics of sugar.
Appendix C shows the amount of these various sweeteners that will give the 
sweetening power of a measured amount of sucrose (table sugar). Feel free to 

27
 Chapter 2: How What You Eat Affects Your Diabetes
substitute calorie-free sweeteners whenever sugar is called for. The calories 
you save could make a big difference in your diabetes.
Contrary to opinions that you may hear or read, there is no scientific evi­
dence that these sweeteners are associated with a higher incidence of 
cancer.
Getting Enough Protein 
(Not Just from Meat)
Most Americans are already eating more than the recommended daily intake 
of protein. Protein comes from meat, fish, poultry, milk, and cheese. It can also 
be found in beans, peas, and lentils, which we mention in the carbohydrate dis­
cussion in the preceding section. Meat sources of protein can be low or very 
high in fat, depending on the source. Because people with diabetes should be 
trying to keep the fat content of their diets fairly low, lowfat sources of protein, 
such as skinless white meat chicken or turkey, flounder or halibut, and fat-free 
cheese are preferred. Beans, peas, and lentils, which can be very good sources 
of protein, don’t contain fat but do contain carbohydrate.
	
How much protein should you eat? We recommend that 40 percent of your 
calories should be carbohydrate, and in the next section, we suggest that you 
limit your fat intake to 30 percent of your calories. The remaining 30 percent is 
protein.
Protein doesn’t cause an immediate rise in blood glucose, but it can raise 
glucose levels several hours later, after your liver processes the protein and 
converts some of it into glucose. Therefore, protein isn’t a good choice if you 
want to treat low blood glucose, but a snack containing protein at bedtime 
may help prevent low blood glucose during the night.
Focusing on Fat
Fat comes in many different forms. The one everyone talks about is cho­
lesterol, the type found in the yolk of an egg. However, most of the fat that 
people eat comes in a chemical form known as triglyceride. This term refers 
to the chemistry of the fat, and we don’t have to get into the details of it for 
you to understand how to handle fat in your diet. In the following sections, 
we start with a discussion of cholesterol and then turn to other forms of fat.

28
Part I: Thriving with Diabetes 
Zeroing in on cholesterol
These days, just about everyone knows his or her cholesterol level. You 
usually find out your total cholesterol level, a combination of so-called good 
cholesterol and bad cholesterol. If your total is high, much of that cholesterol 
may be the good kind — HDL (high-density lipoprotein) cholesterol. If you’re 
interested in knowing the balance between good and bad cholesterol in your 
body, talk with your medical practitioner, who may recommend a lipid panel 
that delivers more details.
The Framingham Study, an ongoing study of the health of the citizens of 
Framingham, Massachusetts, has shown that the total cholesterol amount 
divided by the good cholesterol figure gives a number that is a reasonable 
measure of the risk of a heart attack. People who had results that were less 
than 4.5 were at lower risk of heart attacks, while those with results of more 
that 4.5 were at higher risk. The risk increases as the number rises.
More recently, another component of the total cholesterol in your blood, the 
so-called bad cholesterol or LDL-C (low-density lipoprotein cholesterol) has 
been found to have a very important role in causing heart attacks. For people 
at high risk of a heart attack, the recommended level for LDL used to be less 
than 100 mg/dl but has recently been lowered to less than 70 mg/dl.
	
Most foods don’t contain much cholesterol — with the exception of eggs. The 
daily recommendation for cholesterol is less than 300 milligrams, and one egg 
almost reaches that level. Some doctors say that eating an egg two or three 
times a week won’t hurt you, but this isn’t true if you have diabetes. Avoid 
eggs and foods such as organ meats that are high in cholesterol, or use egg 
substitutes instead.
Taking a look at other types of fat
Although cholesterol gets all the press, most of the fat you eat is in the form of 
triglyceride, the fat you see on fatty meats, contained in whole-fat dairy prod­
ucts, and in many processed foods. There are several forms of triglyceride:
	
✓	Saturated fat is the kind of fat that comes from animal sources like that 
big piece of rib-eye steak you ate the other night. Butter, bacon, cream, 
and cream cheese are other examples. Saturated fat increases your bad 
cholesterol levels and should be avoided.
	
✓	Trans fats were invented by food manufacturers to replace butter, 
which is more expensive. Unfortunately trans fats, which are currently 
listed as partially hydrogenated oil on food labels, may be worse than 
saturated fat in causing coronary heart disease. They’re found in mar­
garine, cake mixes, dried soup mixes, many fast foods, and many frozen 

29
 Chapter 2: How What You Eat Affects Your Diabetes
foods, doughnuts, cookies, potato chips, breakfast cereals, candies, and 
whipped toppings. Keep them out of your diet by reading food labels, 
which must list them.
	
✓	Unsaturated fats come from vegetable sources such as olive oil and 
canola oil. There are two forms of unsaturated fats:
 
• Monounsaturated fats, which don’t raise cholesterol in the blood. 
Olive oil, canola oil, and avocado are some examples. The oil in 
nuts is also monounsaturated.
 
• Polyunsaturated fats, which don’t raise cholesterol but can lower 
good or HDL cholesterol. Corn oil, mayonnaise, and some marga­
rines have this form of fat.
Curbing your fat intake
Fat has concentrated calories, so don’t eat too much fat in your diet. 
However, monounsaturated fats seem to protect against heart disease. The 
increased intake of olive oil by people living around the Mediterranean Sea 
may be the reason for their lower incidence of heart disease.
Although vegetable sources of fat are generally better than animal sources, 
the exceptions are palm oil and coconut oil, which are highly saturated fats.
Demystifying fatspeak
If you’re concerned about the amount of fat in 
your diet (and of course you are), you should 
understand the government definitions of words 
describing the amounts of fat in various foods.
Here are the definitions:
	✓	Fat-free: Less than 0.5 grams of fat per 
serving
	✓	Lowfat: Less than 3 grams of fat per serving
	✓	Reduced fat: 25 percent less fat when com­
pared with a similar food
	✓	Lean meat: Less than 10 grams of fat, less 
than 4 grams of saturated fat, and less than 
95 milligrams of cholesterol per serving
	✓	Low saturated fat: 1 gram or less of satu­
rated fat and no more than 15 percent of 
calories from saturated fat
	✓	Cholesterol-free: Less than 2 milligrams of 
cholesterol per serving or 2 grams or less of 
saturated fat per serving
	✓	Low cholesterol: Less than 20 milligrams 
of cholesterol or less than 2 grams of satu­
rated fat per serving
	✓	Reduced cholesterol: At least 25 percent 
less cholesterol compared to a similar food 
and 2 grams or less of saturated fat

30
Part I: Thriving with Diabetes 
	
Here’s my bottom line recommendation: No more than 30 percent of your kilo­
calories should come from fat, and of that, no more than a third should come 
from saturated fats. For a person eating 1,500 kilocalories a day, this recom­
mendation would mean 450 kilocalories from fat, and 150 of those kilocalories 
from saturated fat.
	
Use vegetable oils, preferably canola oil and olive oil, as your primary sources 
of fat, because these lower cholesterol.
Choose fish or poultry as your source of protein in order to avoid consuming 
too much fat along with your protein. If you remove the skin from chicken, 
you’ll get little fat. Fish actually has certain fatty acids that lower cholesterol.
There’s a little danger in eating too much salmon, however. One man ate so 
many salmon croquettes, salmon steaks, and salmon salads that he had to 
fight the urge to go north and spawn.
Figuring Out Your Diet
After you know how much to eat of each energy source (carbohydrate, fat, 
and protein), how do you translate this into actual foods? You can use two 
basic approaches and a new, even simpler technique.
Using the food guide pyramid
The federal government, with the assistance of many experts, has come up 
with a simple way for you to eat a good, balanced diet: the food guide pyra­
mid. This pyramid was recently completely revised so that you can be more 
specific about food choices and portions depending on your specific needs. 
For complete information about the new pyramid and how you can use it to 
your best advantage, be sure to check out www.mypyramid.gov. After you 
enter some basic information about yourself, using the site’s interactive tool, 
you can get specific portion sizes for each food group. This Web site is full of 
great nutritional information and tips on how to adapt the pyramid’s recom­
mendations to your lifestyle.
	
The food guide pyramid is probably a good tool for a person with type 2 dia­
betes who doesn’t tend to gain weight, but the person with type 1 diabetes 
or the person who is obese with type 2 diabetes needs to know the specific 
number of calories and particularly the carbohydrate calories that he or she is 
eating. That’s the reason I provide information about carbohydrate counting 
as well as a new calculation method in the next sections.

31
 Chapter 2: How What You Eat Affects Your Diabetes
Working with diabetic exchanges
Diabetic exchanges were first developed by the American Diabetes 
Association and the U.S. Public Health Service in the 1950s. They were 
revised in 1976, 1986, and 1995, but dietitians, in general, ignore it in advising 
patients with diabetes. We believe it is time to drop it from the teaching of 
good food practices in diabetes. If you have a previous version of this book, 
please cross it out! Carbohydrate counting, in the next section, is a much sim­
pler and more useful approach.
Counting carbohydrates
People with type 1 diabetes and those with type 2 diabetes who take insulin 
may find the technique of counting carbohydrates to be the easiest for them. 
You still need to know how much carbohydrate you should eat in a given day. 
You divide the total into the meals and snacks that you eat and then, with the 
help of your doctor or certified diabetes educator, you determine your short-
acting insulin needs based upon that amount of carbohydrates and the blood 
glucose that you measure before that meal.
For example, suppose that a person with diabetes is about to have a break­
fast containing 60 grams of carbohydrate. He has found that each unit of 
lispro insulin controls about 20 grams of carbohydrate intake in his body. 
Figuring the proper amount of short-acting insulin can be accomplished by 
a process of trial and error: knowing the amount of carbohydrate intake and 
determining how many units are needed to keep the blood glucose level 
about the same after eating the carbohydrate as it was before. (The number 
of carbohydrate grams that each unit of insulin can control differs for each 
individual, and another person might control only 15 grams per unit.)
In this example, the person’s measured blood glucose is 150 mg/dl (milli­
grams per deciliter). This result is about 50 mg/dl higher than he wants it to 
be. He knows that he can lower his blood glucose by 50 mg/dl for every unit 
of insulin he takes. Therefore, he needs 3 units of lispro for the carbohydrate 
intake and 1 unit for the elevated blood glucose for a total of 4 units. For 
more information on lispro, other types of insulin, and figuring out insulin 
sensitivity, see Dr. Rubin’s book Diabetes For Dummies, 3rd Edition (Wiley).
He has a morning that is more active than he expected. When lunchtime 
comes, his blood glucose is down to 60 mg/dl. He’s about to eat a lunch con­
taining 75 grams of carbohydrate. He takes 4 units of lispro for the food but 
reduces it by 1 unit to a total of 3 units because his blood glucose is low.

32
Part I: Thriving with Diabetes 
At dinner, he is eating 45 grams of carbohydrate. His blood glucose is 115 mg/
dl. He takes 2 units of lispro for the food intake and needs no change for the 
blood glucose, so he takes only 2 units.
	
To be a successful carbohydrate counter, you must
	
✓	Have an accurate knowledge of the grams of carbohydrate in the food 
you are about to eat and how many units of insulin you need for a given 
number of grams of carbohydrate.
	
✓	Measure your blood glucose and know how your body responds to each 
unit of insulin.
You can make this calculation a little easier by using constant carbohydrates, 
which means that you try to choose carbohydrates so that you are eating 
about the same amount at every meal and snack. This approach makes deter­
mining proper amounts of insulin less tricky; just add or subtract units based 
upon your blood glucose level before that meal. A few sessions with your 
physician or a certified diabetes educator can help you feel more comfort­
able about counting carbohydrates.
Using a simple calculation
For patients with type 1 diabetes and those with type 2 diabetes who take 
a shot of rapid-acting insulin before meals and a shot of long-acting insulin 
once a day, this may be the easiest way to go. And it is just as effective as car­
bohydrate counting in lowering the hemoglobin A1c.
The method is based on a study published in Diabetes Care in July 2008. The 
authors compared their method with a group that did traditional carbohy­
drate counting and found no difference. Both techniques lowered the hemo­
globin A1c into the normal range.
The targets were a fasting blood glucose of less than 95 mg/dl, blood glucose 
before lunch and dinner of less than 100 mg/dl, and bedtime glucose of less 
than 130 mg/dl.
The initial dose of the long-acting insulin (in this case, insulin glargine) was 
determined by adding all the insulin taken in a day before the study began. 
The dose was then started at 50 percent of the previous total daily insulin. 
The dose was adjusted by taking the mean of the previous three day’s fasting 
glucose levels. The adjustment was then made as follows:
If the mean of the last three-day fasting glucose was
	
✓	Greater than 180 mg/dl: Increase 8 units
	
✓	140 to 180 mg/dl: Increase 6 units

33
 Chapter 2: How What You Eat Affects Your Diabetes
	
✓	120 to 139 mg/dl: Increase 4 units
	
✓	95 to 119 mg/dl: Increase 2 units
	
✓	70 to 94 mg/dl: No change
	
✓	Less than 70 mg/dl: Decrease by the same units as the previous 
increase or up to 10 percent of the previous dose
The dose of the rapid-acting insulin before meals (in this case insulin gluli­
sine) at first totaled the other 50 percent of the pre-study daily insulin. It was 
divided into 50 percent for the meal with the most carbohydrate, 33 percent 
for the middle meal, and 17 percent for the meal with the least carbohydrate. 
Table 2-3 shows the adjustments made to the rapid-acting insulin based on 
the pattern of the pre-lunch, pre-dinner, and bedtime glucose patterns of the 
previous week.

Try this system for yourself. It’s easy and it works.
Monitoring Your Micronutrients
Food contains a lot more than just carbohydrate, protein, and fat. Most of the 
other components are micronutrients (present in tiny or micro quantities), 
which are essential for maintaining the health of human beings. Examples of 
micronutrients include vitamins (such as vitamin C and vitamin K) and miner­
als (such as calcium, magnesium, and iron). Most micronutrients are needed 
in such small amounts that it’s extremely unlikely that you would ever suffer 
a deficiency of them. A person who eats a balanced diet by using the pyramid 
technique or the exchange technique doesn’t have to worry about getting suf­
ficient quantities of micronutrients — with a few exceptions, which follow:
	
✓	Adults need to be sure to take in at least 1,000 milligrams of calcium 
each day. If you’re a young person still growing, pregnant, or elderly, 
you need 1,500 milligrams daily. The best food sources of calcium are 

34
Part I: Thriving with Diabetes 
plain nonfat yogurt, fat-free or lowfat milk, fortified ready-to-eat cereals, 
and calcium-fortified soy beverages.
	
✓	Some menstruating women lose more iron than their bodies can spare 
and need to take iron supplements. The best sources of iron are iron-
rich plant foods like spinach and lowfat meats.
	
✓	You probably take in 20 to 40 times more salt (sodium) than you need 
and are better off leaving added salt out of your diet.
	
✓	You should increase your uptake of potassium to help lower blood pres­
sure. The best sources are leafy green vegetables, fruit from vines, and 
root vegetables. For more information on micronutrients, check out 
Diabetes For Dummies, 2nd Edition.
Recognizing the Importance of Timing 
of Food and Medication
If you take insulin, the peak of your insulin activity should correspond with 
the greatest availability of glucose in your blood. To accomplish this, you 
need to know the time when your insulin is most active, how long it lasts, and 
when it is no longer active.
	
✓	Regular insulin, which has been around for decades, takes 30 minutes 
to start to lower the glucose level, peaks at three hours, and is gone by 
six to eight hours. This insulin is used before meals to keep glucose low 
until the next meal. The problem with regular insulin has always been 
that you have to take it 30 minutes before you eat or run the risk of 
becoming hypoglycemic at first, and hyperglycemic later when the insu­
lin is no longer around but your food is providing glucose.
	
✓	Rapid-acting lispro insulin and insulin glulisine are the newest prepara­
tions and the shortest acting. They begin to lower the glucose level 
within five minutes after administration, peak at about one hour, and 
are no longer active by about three hours. These insulins are a great 
advance because they free the person with diabetes to take a shot only 
when he or she eats. Because their activity begins and ends so quickly, 
they don’t cause hypoglycemia as often as the older preparation.
	
Given a choice, because of its rapid onset and fall-off in activity, I recommend 
either lispro or glulisine as the short-acting insulins of choice for people with 
type 1 diabetes and those with type 2 diabetes who take insulin.

35
 Chapter 2: How What You Eat Affects Your Diabetes
If you’re going out to eat, you rarely know when the food will be served. 
Using rapid-acting insulins, you can measure your blood glucose when the 
food arrives and take an immediate shot. These preparations really free you 
to take insulin when you need it. They add a level of flexibility to your sched­
ule that didn’t exist before.
If you take regular insulin, keep to a more regular schedule of eating. In addi­
tion to short-acting insulin, if you have type 1 diabetes, or in some instances 
type 2 diabetes, you need to take a longer-acting preparation. The reason is 
to ensure that some insulin is always circulating to keep your body’s metabo­
lism running smoothly. Insulin glargine and insulin detemir are preparations 
that have no peak of activity but are available for 24 hours. You take one shot 
daily at bedtime, and they cover your needs for insulin except when large 
amounts of glucose enter your blood after meals. That is what rapid-acting 
insulins are for.
	
Each person responds in his or her own way to different preparations of 
insulin. You need to test your blood glucose to determine your individual 
response.
An additional factor affecting the onset of insulin is the location of the injec­
tion. Because your abdominal muscles are usually at rest, injection of insulin 
into the abdomen results in more consistent blood glucose levels. If you use 
the arms or legs, the insulin will be taken up faster or slower, depending on 
whether you exercise or not. Be sure to rotate sites.
The depth of the injection also affects the onset of activity of the insulin. A 
deeper injection results in a faster onset of action. If you use the same length 
needle and insert it to its maximum length each time, you’ll ensure more uni­
form activity.
You can see from the discussion in this section that a great deal of variation 
is possible in the taking of an insulin shot. It’s no wonder that people who 
must inject insulin tend to have many more ups and downs in their blood glu­
cose. But with proper education, these variations can be reduced.
If you take oral medication, in particular the sulfonylurea drugs like micro­
nase and glucotrol, the timing of food in relation to the taking of your medi­
cation must also be considered. For a complete explanation of this balance 
between food and medication, see Diabetes For Dummies, 3rd Edition.

Chapter 3
Planning Meals for 
Your Weight Goal
In This Chapter
▶	Deciding how many calories to eat
▶	Shedding weight quickly at 1,200 kilocalories
▶	Dropping weight more slowly at 1,500 kilocalories
▶	Staying at your current weight with 1,800 kilocalories
▶	Looking at other diets
You can eat wisely, get all the nutrients you need, and continue to eat 
great food, but you do have to limit your portions. In this chapter, we 
show you how to plan three different daily levels of kilocalories (the proper 
term for what most people call calories). You can lose weight rapidly, lose 
more slowly, or maintain your weight.
We prefer the slower approach to losing weight. With this method, you’ll 
probably feel less hungry, and cutting back a few hundred kilocalories a day 
doesn’t cause a major upheaval in daily life. Also, maintaining a weight loss 
may be easier if you lose the weight slowly.
	
Exercise can help speed up weight loss or permit you to eat more and still lose 
weight. Twenty minutes of walking burns up 100 kilocalories, and 30 minutes 
of walking burns up 150 kilocalories. Walk for 30 minutes a day, and you lose 
about 1⁄3 of a pound per week (7 times 150 equals 1,050 kilocalories divided into 
3,500) — without reducing your calories. That activity amounts to an annual 
weight loss of 17 pounds in a year. Who says you can’t lose weight by exercis­
ing but not dieting?

38
Part I: Thriving with Diabetes 
Figuring Out How Many 
Calories You Need
Before planning a nutritional program, you need to know how much you need 
to eat on a daily basis to maintain your current weight. Then you can figure 
how rapidly a deficit of calories will get you to your goal.
Finding your ideal weight range
The ideal weight for your height is a range and not a single weight at each 
height, but we use numbers that give a weight in the middle of that range. 
Because people have different amounts of muscle and different size frames, 
you’re considered normal if your weight is plus or minus 10 percent of this 
number. For example, a person who is calculated to have an ideal weight of 
150 pounds is considered normal at a weight of 135 (150 minus 10 percent) to 
165 (150 plus 10 percent) pounds.
	
Because no two people, even twins, are totally alike in all aspects of their lives, 
we can only approximate your ideal weight and the number of calories you 
need to maintain that weight. You’ll test the correctness of the approximation 
by adding or subtracting calories. If your daily caloric needs are 2,000 kilocalo­
ries and you find yourself putting on weight, try reducing your intake by 100 
kilocalories and see whether you maintain your weight on fewer kilocalories.
Considering the calories you’re storing
Patients often worry that they’re going to feel 
hungry if they take in fewer calories than they 
need. Does a bear feel hungry as it lives off its 
fat all winter long? No, it sleeps.
One of our favorite tasks is to point out how 
many calories of energy are stored in the 
body of an overweight or obese person. Each 
pound of fat contains 3,500 kilocalories. If 
you’re 25 pounds overweight, you have 87,500 
kilocalories (25 times 3,500) of stored energy 
in your body. We can give you an idea of what 
you could do with that much energy. You need 
100 kilocalories to walk 20 minutes at 4 miles an 
hour. So a walk of 11⁄3 miles (one-third of 4 miles) 
burns 100 kilocalories. Your stored energy — 
87,500 kilocalories — would take you about 
1,100 miles (87,500 divided by 100 times 11⁄3)!
We certainly don’t suggest that you stop eating 
and fast for any length of time in order to lose 
weight, but recognize that your stored energy, 
in the form of fat, will provide all the calories 
necessary to continue your daily activities with­
out fatigue and often without hunger.

39
 Chapter 3: Planning Meals for Your Weight Goal
If you’re a male, your approximate ideal weight is 106 pounds for 5 feet of height 
plus 6 pounds for each inch over 5 feet. If you’re a female, your ideal weight is 
100 pounds for 5 feet plus 5 pounds for each inch over 5 feet tall. For example, a 
5-foot-4-inch male should weigh 130 pounds while the same height female should 
weigh 120 pounds. Your ideal weight range is then plus or minus 10 percent. The 
male could weigh 117 to 143 pounds and the female 108 to 132 pounds.
Now you know your ideal weight for your height. What a surprise! Yes, we 
know. You have big bones, but bear with us. It is amazing how often we have 
seen big bones melt away as weight is lost.
Determining your caloric needs
After you know about how much you should weigh, figure out how many calories 
you need to maintain your ideal weight. Start by multiplying your ideal weight 
by ten. For example, if you’re a male, 5 feet, 6 inches tall, your ideal weight is 142 
pounds. Your daily kilocalorie allowance is about 1,400. But this number is ideal 
only if you don’t take a breath or have a heartbeat. It is considered your basal 
caloric need. You must increase your calorie intake depending upon the amount 
of physical activity you do each day. Table 3-1 shows this graduated increase.
Table 3-1	
Kilocalories Needed Based on Activity Level
Level of Activity
Kilocalories Added
5’6’’ Male
Sedentary
10% more than basal
1,540 kilocalories
Moderate
20% more than basal
1,680 kilocalories
Very active
40%+ more than basal
1,960+ kilocalories
The “Very active” line displays a plus sign because some people doing hard 
manual labor need so many extra calories that they should not be held 
to only 40 percent more than their basal calorie intake. This requirement 
becomes clear as the person gains or loses weight on his or her food plan.
You gain weight when your daily intake of kilocalories exceeds your daily 
needs. Each pound of fat has 3,500 kilocalories, so when the excess has 
reached that number of calories, you are a pound heavier. On the other hand, 
you lose weight when your daily expenditure of calories exceeds your daily 
intake. You lose a pound of fat each time you burn up 3,500 kilocalories more 
than you take in, whether you do it by burning an extra 100 kilocalories per 
day for 35 days or an extra 500 kilocalories per day for 7 days.
Now you can create a nutritional program and fill in the blanks with carbohy­
drates, proteins, fats, and real foods.

40
Part I: Thriving with Diabetes 
Losing Weight Rapidly 
at 1,200 Kilocalories
If you’re a moderately active male, 5 feet, 6 inches tall, you need 1,680 or 
approximately 1,700 kilocalories daily to maintain your weight. (Refer to 
Table 3-2.) If you eat only 1,200 kilocalories daily, you’ll have a daily deficit of 
approximately 500 kilocalories. By dividing the kilocalories in a pound of fat 
(3,500) by 500, you can see that you’ll lose 1 pound per week (3,500 divided 
by 500 is 7, so the loss will take 7 days).
In Chapter 3, you find that you want to eat 40 percent of your calories as 
carbohydrate, 30 percent as protein, and 30 percent as fat. Multiplying 1,200 
kilocalories by those percentages, a 1,200 kilocalorie diet would provide 480 
kilocalories of carbohydrate, 360 kilocalories of protein, and 360 kilocalories 
of fat. Because there are 4 kilocalories of energy in each gram of carbohy­
drate and protein, dividing the kilocalories by 4, you can eat 120 grams of car­
bohydrate and 90 grams of protein. Because there are 9 kilocalories in each 
gram of fat, you can eat 40 grams of fat.
You can create your diet using recipes where you know the grams of carbo­
hydrate, such as the ones in this book. Table 3-2 shows you such a diet.

All we did in making up this diet was to make sure the carbohydrate total 
came to about 120 grams. It was purely accidental that the grams of protein 
and fat worked out so well. If they had not, my next day’s diet would have 
been more of what was missing and less of what was present in too large an 
amount.
You can see how easy it is to create a diet when the grams of protein, fat, and 
carbohydrate are listed for you as they are in this book. It is very difficult 

41
 Chapter 3: Planning Meals for Your Weight Goal
to do the same thing when you go to a restaurant and have no idea of the 
contents of the food. At the grocery store, the food label gives you the break­
down that you need. That is why it is so important to check the food labels, 
as explained in Chapter 5, to find out how much carbohydrate, protein, and 
fat the food actually contains.
	
The portions on all food labels are based on a 2,000-kilocalorie diet. Not one of 
the diets in this chapter allows you to eat that many calories. Such a portion 
may be much too large for a person on a 1,200-kilocalorie diet.
Losing Weight More Slowly 
at 1,500 Kilocalories
The smaller the deficit of calories between what you need and what you eat, 
the more slowly you’ll lose weight. If your daily needs are 1,700 kilocalories 
and you eat 1,500, you’ll be missing 200 kilocalories each day. Because a 
pound of fat is 3,500 kilocalories, you’ll lose a pound in about 17 days (3,500 
divided by 200). You’ll lose almost 2 pounds a month, or 24 pounds in a year. 
You can accomplish this loss by reducing your daily intake by only the equiv­
alent of a piece of bread and two teaspoons of margarine. Put that way, losing 
the weight doesn’t seem difficult at all.
Below we use the recipes in this book to make up a 1,500-kilocalorie diet. In 
this plan, you’re eating 600 kilocalories of carbohydrate or 150 grams, 450 
kilocalories of protein or 112 grams, and 450 kilocalories of fat or 50 grams.

protein, and 1 gram low on fat. This allows you to have some fruit with the

meal or snacks in between to make up the difference. An apple, half banana, 
and 12 cherries will provide 45 grams of carbohydrate because each is 15 
grams. A tablespoon of cashews and 6 almonds will provide 10 grams of 
unsaturated fat. Two ounces of ricotta cheese with 5 grams of fat per ounce 
will provide 10 grams of fat.
As you create your meals, you’ll be amazed at how small the portions really 
are. Four ounces of lean meat isn’t much compared to what most people 
are used to eating at home or in restaurants. Eating proper portions is very 
important because it will ultimately make the difference between weight 
gain and weight maintenance or loss. Portion size may also be the difference 
between controlling your blood glucose and not controlling it. Check out 
Chapter 1 for more about portion sizes.
	
Think of the money you will save if — each time you go to a restaurant — your 
knowledge of portion sizes allows you to take home half of your meal to eat 
another day.
Maintaining Your Weight 
at 1,800 Kilocalories
Suppose that you have finally reached a weight (not necessarily your “ideal” 
weight that we calculate in the section “Figuring Your Daily Caloric Needs”) 
that allows your blood glucose levels to remain between 80 and 140 mg/dl all 
the time. Now, you want to maintain that weight. You want to eat about 1,800 
kilocalories, up another 300 from the previous diet in this chapter. Compared 
to the 1,200-kilocalorie diet, this may seem like a lot of food.
This plan provides 180 grams of carbohydrate, 135 grams of protein, and 60 
grams of fat, maintaining the 40:30:30 division of calories. You can use the 
recipes to create this diet as well, as shown in Table 3-4.
Exercise for prevention
A study published in the June 2007 edition of 
Applied Physiology, Nutrition, and Metabolism 
looked at numerous studies of the effect of 
exercise on the occurrence of diabetes. The 
study concluded that 30 minutes per day of 
moderate- or high-level physical activity can 
effectively and safely prevent type 2 diabetes 
in all populations.

This time, the plan is short 16 grams of carbohydrates and 11 grams of pro­
tein and has the right amount of fat. You can make up the difference with 
fruits, crackers, and other sources of carbohydrate and protein but not fat.
If you have type 2 diabetes, this plan is an excellent way for you to eat the 
right amount of calories in the right ratios of energy sources. If you have type 
1 diabetes, or you have type 2 and take insulin, you need to know the grams 
of carbohydrate in each meal in order to determine your insulin needs for 
that meal.
Checking Out Other Diets
If you go to the diet section of any large bookstore, you’ll be overwhelmed by 
the choices. You’ll find diets that recommend protein and no carbohydrate, 
carbohydrate and no protein, one type of carbohydrate and not another, all 
rice, all grapefruit, and on and on. How is it possible for all these diets, many 
of which are exactly the opposite of others on the same shelf, to actually 
work for you? The answer is they do and they don’t. If you follow any diet 
closely, you’ll lose weight. But will the weight stay off? That is the most dif­
ficult part (as we’re sure you know).
In this section we tell you about the most popular diets presently recom­
mended by this or that brilliant “scientist.” Which one do we recommend? 

44
Part I: Thriving with Diabetes 
None of them and all of them. If you find that you can get started losing 
weight successfully with one of these programs, go ahead and do it, but 
remember that in the end you want to eat a balanced diet that is low in fat 
and protein and uses carbohydrates that emphasize whole grains and fiber. 
And remember that you won’t be successful without exercise.
	
Reduction of any source of calories — by reduction of carbohydrates, protein, 
or fat — has been shown to be equally effective.
The low carbohydrate group
These diets are based on the claim that carbohydrates promote hunger. By 
reducing or eliminating them, you lose your hunger as you lose your weight. 
The first of them, the Atkins Diet, promotes any kind of protein, including 
protein high in fat. Naturally, other diets were developed promoting very 
little carbohydrate but less fatty protein. Here are your choices:
	
✓	Atkins Diet: This plan allows any quantity of meats, shellfish, eggs, and 
cheese but doesn’t permit high-carbohydrate foods like fruits, starchy 
vegetables, and pasta. Small quantities of the forbidden foods are added 
in later. The program does recommend exercise but doesn’t suggest 
changes in your eating behavior.
	
✓	South Beach Diet: This diet restricts carbohydrates while the recom­
mended proteins are low in fat, unlike the Atkins Diet. Daily exercise is an 
important component, but the plan doesn’t suggest any changes in eating 
behavior. Over time some carbohydrate is reintroduced into the diet.
	
✓	Ultimate Weight Solution: This plan recommends a lot of protein, 
which naturally results in a reduction in carbohydrate. This program 
also advises you not to eat foods that are high in fat. Support groups in 
which you learn how to modify your eating behaviors are very impor­
tant, and you’re supposed to stay in these groups throughout your life. 
The plan also emphasizes regular exercise, such as walking.
	
✓	Zone Diet: In this diet, you have to balance your food intake into exact 
amounts of carbohydrate, protein, and fat. You’re not permitted to eat 
high-carbohydrate and high-fat food. Regular exercise is recommended, 
but the plan doesn’t suggest changes in your eating behavior. You have to 
continue with this balance throughout life to maintain your weight loss.
The portion control group
These diets recognize that it’s not what you eat but how much you eat that 
determines your weight. They generally follow the recommendations of the 
government food guidelines. Here are some examples of portion control diets:

45
 Chapter 3: Planning Meals for Your Weight Goal
	
✓	DASH Diet: Here, the emphasis is on grains, fruits, and vegetables and 
restricting the amounts of fat. A further modification for those with high 
blood pressure recommends very little salt. Animal protein, such as 
meat, fish, and poultry, is limited. An exercise program is suggested but 
not defined. This diet suggests changes in eating behavior. It is a diet for 
life (and a very good one).
	
✓	Jenny Craig: This diet is balanced in terms of carbohydrates, protein, 
and fat but pushes its own food products, which can get expensive. You 
are directed to exercise by the counselor, who is an important (and 
costly) part of the program as well. To stay on this diet, you need their 
products lifelong.
	
✓	Weight Watchers: This plan uses a point system in which foods are 
given points according to the amount of fat, fiber, and calories in them. 
To get to and maintain a certain weight, you’re given a daily number 
of points. As long as you stay within these points, you’ll be successful. 
Therefore, foods that have large amounts of calories will use up your 
daily points quickly. The program suggests exercise and changes in your 
lifestyle.
A diet that emphasizes weight training
The Abs Diet is similar to the diets that recommend a balanced approach 
to eating, with carbohydrates that aren’t refined and dairy and meat that 
are low in fat as the most suggested foods. However, the major emphasis in 
this diet is on a program called “Total Body Strength Training Workout” to 
build up the muscles. Changes in eating behavior aren’t a large part of the 
program. To maintain weight loss, you must eat and exercise as the diet pre­
scribes for your entire life.
More extreme diets
These diets require a level of participation that may be difficult for people 
who have a life. You really need to give your time and energy to staying on 
the diet. If you go away for a few weeks and stay within their program, you’ll 
have some short-term success. But after you return home, sticking to the pro­
gram gets difficult. Here are the two major programs currently available:
	
✓	Dean Ornish Program: This plan allows fruits, vegetables, and whole 
grains along with the leanest of meats and poultry. You can’t eat pro­
cessed foods or drink caffeine or alcohol, and you must avoid sugar, 
salt, and oil. Exercise is recommended as is help with eating behaviors. 
Meetings are an important part of this program, which you’re supposed 
to follow for life.

46
Part I: Thriving with Diabetes 
	
✓	Pritikin Eating Plan: Whole grains, vegetables, and fruits are essential 
foods, and the diet allows almost no protein or fat. Exercise is a part 
of the program as is changing your lifestyle to promote better eating 
behaviors. You’re expected to follow this program for life.
	
With the exception of the DASH Diet, which is recommended by the U.S. gov­
ernment, none of the diets described in the preceding sections have long-term 
studies that show, convincingly, that they’re better than any other. Each one 
of them has anecdotal evidence, meaning that one or two or ten people tell 
you how great they did on this or that diet. But you never hear from those 
who didn’t do so great.

H
aving diabetes doesn’t mean you have to give up the foods that you 
grew up with and the foods you love the most. Some parts of every 
ethnic diet fit well in a diabetic regimen. You can find recipes to prove this 
premise in Part II of this book. You can also use all kinds of tricks to substi­
tute good-for-you ingredients for those that won’t help your diabetes. That’s 
what this chapter is all about. Even foods that seemingly have no business on 
the plate of a diabetic can be enjoyed if eaten in small portions.
We wish we could eliminate the word “diet” from the diabetic vocabulary. The 
word implies taking something away or having to suffer somehow in order to 
follow it. This is not the case at all. You can eat great food and enjoy the taste 
of every ethnic variety, provided you concentrate on the amount of food and 
its breakdown into the sources of energy, keeping fats and carbohydrates in 
control. Perhaps the phrase “nutritional plan” would be better than “diet.”
Stop dieting and start eating delicious foods. It may take a lot of willpower, 
but you can give up dieting if you try hard enough.
Following Your Eating Plan
Creating an eating plan that provides the proper number of kilocalories from 
carbohydrate, protein, and fat (see Chapter 3) is particularly important when 

48
Part I: Thriving with Diabetes 
you have diabetes. After you know how much of each you need, you can 
translate those numbers into recipes and pick out the food that is the deli­
cious end point of all the calculating. Make sure that your choices come from 
a variety of foods rather than eating the same thing over and over. You will 
be much more likely to stay on your program if you aren’t bored with what 
you eat.
	
Before you cook, make sure that the recipes fit into your eating plan. If you 
have already eaten your carbohydrate portions for the day, make sure that 
the food you’re about to eat has little carbohydrate in it. The same is true for 
protein and, of course, fat. If you think “moderation” as you make your meal 
plan, you’ll keep to the portions you need to eat and no more.
Seasonal foods should play a primary role in your eating plan for several 
reasons:
	
✓	Seasonal foods are the freshest foods in the market.
	
✓	They are the least expensive foods.
	
✓	The recipes you can prepare with these fresh foods are some of the 
most delicious. The recipes in this book show the tremendous influence 
that fresh ingredients have had on the imaginations of the best chefs in 
the United States and Canada.
In addition, time is an important factor in your eating plan. You may not have 
a great deal of time to prepare your food, and some of the recipes in this book 
may take more time than you can spare. Choose the meals that fit into your 
schedule. But remember that after you’ve prepared a recipe a few times, prepa­
ration is much faster and easier. Consider the time you spend preparing deli­
cious, healthy food as an investment in your well-being. Take the time to eat 
properly now so that later you won’t have to give up your time being sick.
As a person with diabetes, especially if you have type 1 diabetes, you must 
figure the timing of your food in your eating plan. You need to eat when your 
medications will balance your carbohydrates. This process is much easier 
with the rapid-acting insulins, lispro and glulisine, but if you’re still using 
regular insulin, you’ll have to eat about 30 minutes after you take your shot.
Another essential part of your planning is what to do when you feel hungry 
but shouldn’t eat. You can prepare a low-calorie snack for such occasions, or 
you can provide yourself with some diversion, such as a hobby, a movie, or, 
best of all, some exercise. Examples of low-calorie snacks are baby carrots, 
cherry tomatoes, a piece of fruit, and lowfat pudding.
Your diabetes medication may require you to have three meals a day, but 
if not, having three meals is still important. This approach spreads calories 

49
 Chapter 4: Eating What You Like
over the day and helps you avoid coming to a meal extremely hungry. Try not 
to skip breakfast, even though society doesn’t encourage taking the time for 
this meal. Making your own lunch as often as possible gives you control over 
what you eat. The fast lunches served in restaurants may not provide the 
lowfat nutrition that you think you’re getting. For example, salads are often 
covered with a lot of oil. It may be the right type of oil, but it still provides a 
lot of fat calories.
Eating the Best of Ethnic Cuisines
If you become diabetic, you don’t have to give up the kinds of food you’ve 
always eaten. You can eat the same foods but decrease the portions, par­
ticularly if you’re obese. People in ethnic groups who are normal in weight 
are doing two things that you need to do as well: eating smaller portions and 
keeping physically fit with exercise. Every ethnic choice also has vegetarian 
foods, which will be mentioned as we describe the foods.
	
After you receive a diagnosis of diabetes, try to find a dietitian who treats many 
members of your ethnic group. This person will be best trained to show you 
how to keep eating what you love, while altering it slightly to fit your needs. 
The alteration may be no greater than simply reducing the amount of food 
that you eat each day. Or it may involve changing ingredients so that a high-fat 
source of energy is replaced by a lowfat energy source with no loss in taste.
Valuing African-American food
African-American food, sometimes called soul food, combines the food pref­
erences and cooking methods of the African slaves with the available ingre­
dients and available fuel found in the United States. Slow cooking with lots 
of vegetables and meats, eating lots of greens, combining fruits and meats 
in main dishes, and deep-frying meats and vegetables were cooking tradi­
tions brought to the United States. At the time, their foods, which contained 
too much fat, cholesterol, sugar, and salt, did not hurt the overworked and 
abused slaves because their daily energy needs were so great. Today, the 
more sedentary African-American population suffers from one of the high­
est incidences of obesity and diabetes, not to mention high blood pressure 
and the consequences of those diseases. As their energy needs fell, African 
Americans didn’t reduce their calorie intake.
The term soul food also points to the central place of eating in the African-
American population. In the slave quarters, the preparation and sharing of 
good food helped the slaves to maintain their humanity, helping those even 

50
Part I: Thriving with Diabetes 
less fortunate than themselves, who might have had no food at all. Because 
they had no other material possessions, food became the one symbol of 
wealth that wasn’t taken from them. It also served as the focus of the creativ­
ity and artistic expression of the female slave.
But people don’t have to abandon soul food. African-American cooks at home 
and chefs in restaurants have learned to use all the healthful ingredients, 
such as fruits, vegetables, and grains, with much smaller amounts of fat, 
sugar, and salt. They use spices in place of salt in very creative ways to bring 
out the taste of their fresh ingredients. The meats are leaner, and they use 
egg whites instead of the whole egg. They also avoid deep-frying as much as 
possible.
A new book published in March 2009 called Vegan Soul Kitchen by Bryant 
Terry (Da Capo Press) shows that you can make great soul food without 
animal protein or dairy.
	
The psychological implications of food in the African-American population 
means that changing from less healthy to more healthy food requires a change 
in mindset. African-American cooks can be just as creative or even more so 
with healthful ingredients. The use of less fat, less salt, and less sugar is essen­
tial, but other ingredients have to take their place. Quantities of food must be 
modified, and this may be the most difficult change, given the importance of 
food both as a symbol of wealth and for sharing. People must eat fewer cakes, 
pies, and cookies and find ways to creatively prepare fruit to take the place of 
sweet baked goods.
Appreciating Chinese food
When you think of Chinese food, you think rice. But China is such a huge 
place, and rice can’t be grown everywhere. In the north, millet is used 
to make cereal. About 1500 BC, wheat was introduced from West Asia. 
Vegetables such as soybeans and cucumbers were added to the rice, and 
occasionally a little bit of chicken or beef was added. Ginger became a favor­
ite flavoring because it was so readily available.
The Thais gave chicken to China, and pork was already there, while Westerners 
brought sheep and cattle. The Chinese, mostly peasants, had little fuel and 
little cooking oil. Consequently, they learned to cut their food into very small 
pieces so it would cook rapidly, using little oil for their stir-frying.
Around 1000 AD, because Buddhists, who made up a large part of the popula­
tion, wouldn’t eat meat, tofu or bean curd was introduced. The Chinese also 
learned to make long noodles from wheat and rice.

51
 Chapter 4: Eating What You Like
Chinese cuisine is generally healthful. It includes lots of vegetables, fruits, 
and seafood, while keeping sugar and desserts to a minimum. People with 
diabetes need to avoid eating too much rice. Chinese restaurants offer won­
derful vegetable dishes, many with tofu as a protein source. You can go into 
any Chinese restaurant and find numerous dishes that have only vegetables 
with tofu as a protein source.
	
When you cook Chinese food, use as little sugar and fat as possible, and steer 
clear of making deep-fried dishes.
Welcoming French food
French food is always associated with the term “haute cuisine,” which means 
fine food prepared by highly skilled chefs. This kind of cooking derives from 
Italy and was introduced to France by Catherine de Medici. The French added 
their own subtle techniques to the methods of the Italians from Florence, 
adopting their use of truffles and mushrooms and preparing lighter sauces.
The French gave the world the technique of serving a series of dishes, one 
after the other, instead of a large buffet where people helped themselves to 
everything at once.
France has several distinct culinary regions:
	
✓	The north: Abundant forests provide game, and streams provide fish.
	
✓	The central area: The red wines provide the basis for much of the 
cooking.
	
✓	The south: Goose liver, truffles, and Roquefort cheese combine with 
Mediterranean olive oil, garlic, and tomatoes to produce the distinctive 
cuisine that is loved throughout the Western world, especially in its new 
lighter form.
	
You can go to Paris and find plenty of vegetarian restaurants. French chefs — 
some of the best in the world — are geniuses at using whatever ingredients 
are at hand to make delicious meals.
Enjoying Italian food
Italian food reflects the history of Italy. Until 1870, Italy was divided into 
many different regions, with each one developing its own cuisine. Therefore, 
there is no one Italian food, but there are some common trends:

52
Part I: Thriving with Diabetes 
	
✓	The food of northern Italy features more wild game, such as deer and 
rabbits, along with some farm animals, such as beef, chickens, and 
goats. Seasonings include garlic, onions, rosemary, and bay leaf.
	
✓	In the south, much closer to the sea, seafood received much more 
emphasis. Southerners also developed some of the famous cheeses like 
ricotta and pecorino. It was here where the Italian staple, the artichoke, 
was first discovered and cultivated.
The invasions of Arabs from North Africa in southern Italy around 800 AD 
brought some of the foods that are now most typically thought of as Italian, 
things like melons, dates, rice, and lemons, but their major contribution was 
pasta. The Spanish gave the tomato to Italy, but the Italians took it over and 
made it their own.
Today, northern Italian cooking emphasizes cream and meat sauces. Rice 
dishes like risotto and polenta made from yellow corn are enjoyed along with 
gnocchi, a dumpling contributed by Germany.
As you move south, the olive becomes part of many dishes, along with 
wine for cooking. In southern Italy, the tomato is the basis of most cooking, 
particularly its use in pasta dishes. The cheeses mentioned earlier also are 
featured. The closeness of all parts of this region to the sea, as well as to the 
islands off the western coast, means that fish will be found in many meals.
These mouthwatering dishes aren’t denied to the person with diabetes. The 
Mediterranean diet, with its emphasis on olive oil, has been shown to be 
healthy for your heart. One of the key changes you may need to make, how­
ever, is to reduce the amount of fat in your ingredients. Olive oil is a fat, and 
as you add more of it to your dishes, the calories climb rapidly. When Italians 
worked hard in the fields all day or traveled long distances to hunt or fish, 
they needed those extra calories to sustain them. But when was the last time 
you lifted a shovel or bagged a deer?
A second important step is reducing the size of your portion of pasta or 
risotto, whether you eat it at home or in the wonderful Italian restaurants 
(see Chapter 17 for more about eating healthy at restaurants). None of the 
recipes give you more than a cup of pasta or 2⁄3 cup of rice. Compare that 
with the usual 3 cups of pasta at a restaurant, and you quickly discover what 
changes you need to make.
On the other hand, the great fresh fruits and vegetables in Italian cooking are 
just what the doctor ordered, like the tomato, the artichoke, and the beans. 
These fit perfectly into the new emphasis of the federal food guidelines on 
fiber and reduction of fat. They also are the reason that Italian food is one of 
the easiest to convert to vegetarian.

53

Top off your meal with a glass of Chianti from Tuscany. (Chapter 1 tells you 
about the benefits of alcohol.) But skip the rich Italian desserts or share a des­
sert with three other people. We don’t think these changes will be a hardship. 
They take nothing away from the glory of Italian cooking.
Feasting on Mexican food
Mexican food comes from the Mayan Indians of the southeastern part of the 
country. They were hunters and fisherman, so their main sources of food 
were wild game, such as rabbit and turkey, and fish. Their diet also included 
beans and corn. The Aztecs later added chocolate, vanilla, honey, and chili 
peppers. After Spain conquered the country in 1521, the Spanish diet began 
to influence Mexican food. The Spanish brought livestock like cows and pigs 
and taught the Mexicans to make cheese and bread.
The type of Mexican food that has become so popular in the United States, 
the burrito, is a stuffed wheat tortilla. The Spanish brought in the wheat, so 
the burrito isn’t exactly an indigenous food of Mexico. The Mexican tortilla is 
made of cornmeal, not wheat.
Mexico has been influenced by other colonial powers, including France, 
Portugal, all of the surrounding islands in the Caribbean, West Africa, and 
South America.
As a result of the influences of other countries, Mexican food can be much 
more complex than the burrito. If you buy a small burrito, you get a fairly 
good combination of beans, chicken or beef, rice, and salsa, but you may also 
get your daily dose of salt in this single food. When you make your own, how­
ever, you can control the amount of salt.
	
The ingredients in a burrito, minus the high salt content, can make a nice meal 
in a hurry. When you make burritos, be sure to avoid cheese and excessive 
rice and watch out, especially, for the hot pepper. Leave out the chicken or 
beef, and you can enjoy a delicious vegetarian burrito.
Savoring Thai food
Thai food is a good choice for people with diabetes. It is cooked with little 
fat because stir-frying is the method of choice. Thai cooking keeps the meat, 
fish, and poultry to small quantities, thus providing taste rather than bulk, 
as in a Western diet. The dipping sauces have strong tastes, so they’re used 
in very small quantities, minimizing the salt and sugar in the diet. Vegetables 

54
Part I: Thriving with Diabetes 
are eaten in larger quantities. At the end of the meal Thais enjoy fruits like 
mango, pineapple, guava, and papaya, which provide fiber, vitamins, and 
minerals. Therefore, it’s easy to convert to vegetarian eating when you eat 
Thai food. Just leave out the meat, fish, or poultry.
Thai food, like Italian food, is also the product of many influences. 
Westerners introduced milk into Thai cooking, and because coconut milk is 
so readily available, this became a staple of Thai dishes. The Chinese coming 
down from the north brought stir-frying with them, as well as noodles. 
Thanks to the Chinese, the five basic flavors of Asian cuisine — bitter, salt, 
sour, hot, and sweet — were established, and Thai meals use them as their 
basis for a balance of flavors. Dishes made with soy and ginger are a good 
example.
India brought curry dishes to Thailand, with coconut milk serving as an 
antidote to the hot spices in some of those curry dishes. The Thais have put 
their own delicious stamp on these curries, using a lot of green chili pepper, 
also given to them originally by Westerners.
Southern Thai food is usually hot and spicy, and fish is a major ingredient 
because the area is so close to the sea. However, you can always get dishes 
that aren’t so spicy, and the subtle tastes of good Thai cooking have made it 
tremendously popular in the United States and throughout the world wher­
ever Thais are found. Rice generally is part of the meal.
Most Thai dishes have garlic, a condiment that grows all over Thailand. 
Coconut milk, actually a combination of the coconut flesh and the liquid 
inside the coconut, is added to Thai curries and soups. Fish sauce, made by 
fermenting shrimp, salt, and water together, takes the place of soy sauce in 
Thai cooking.
In American Thai restaurants, a dish called pad thai has become a favorite 
entrée. It means “Thai-style stir-fried noodles” and was brought to Thailand 
by the Chinese. When employment was low in Thailand after World War II, 
the government promoted noodle shops and stalls as a way of getting people 
back to work, and pad thai noodles became popular throughout the country. 
Thai immigrants brought the dish to the United States. It’s not exactly repre­
sentative of the finest Thai cuisine, but it’s eaten so frequently in the United 
States that it must be considered when the diabetic has Thai food, particu­
larly because the sauce often contains a lot of sugar. A small portion of pad 
thai is fine for the person with diabetes, but leave at least half the serving for 
another day.
Thai food is so nutritious that there is little about it to warn the person with 
diabetes. As always, avoid large portions and too much rice. And be careful 
of the hot spices.

Eating the rest of the world’s cuisine
Covering all the world’s wonderful cuisines in detail isn’t possible in this book. 
We tried to cover the most popular foods in the English-speaking world, but we 
could devote an entire book to every type of cuisine. We know that we left out 
delicious cuisines that many of you love from other countries, such as Greece, 
India, Guatemala, Costa Rica, Argentina, and Brazil. But we hope that you will 
still come away with a few general tips about these foods from around the world:
	
✓	You don’t have to give up the foods you love because you have diabetes.
	
✓	Food is also love, sharing, social status, wealth (which it represented for 
slaves), and a lot more.
	
✓	You can avoid the empty calories in fatty, sugary desserts.
Choosing from familiar foods
Esmeralda Cruz, a patient from a region of the 
Philippines called Pampanga, figured out how 
to successfully manage her diabetes without 
giving up the staples of her native cuisine. 
And good thing — her home is considered by 
many to be the culinary capital of the country. 
Esmeralda is a 46-year-old woman with type 2 
diabetes, which has been diagnosed for five 
years. She is 5 feet, 2 inches tall and weighs 156 
pounds. Her blood glucose averages 176 mg/dl, 
and she has a hemoglobin A1c of 8.6 percent.
Esmeralda followed a typical Filipino diet and 
gained at least 3 to 6 pounds each year for the last 
four years. She ate a lot of food fried in lard and 
too much rice for the calories and carbohydrate 
that is planned for her diet. She also tended not 
to trim the fat from the meat that she ate.
Her dietitian advised her to make modifications 
that would help her keep her diabetes in line 
without sacrificing the foods she loved. She 
recommended that Esmeralda do the following:
	✓	Cut off visible fat from her meats
	✓	Reduce the amount of frying and begin 
broiling and roasting instead
	✓	Switch to canola oil in place of lard
	✓	Reduce the amount of fat she used
	✓	Eat less rice and choose low-glycemic 
types, like basmati
	✓	Add more fish and poultry to her diet
Esmeralda found that the alterations usually 
didn’t affect the food’s appeal. For example, 
one of her dishes, a pork dish called Tortung 
Babi, was made with three eggs, but reducing 
the number to two didn’t diminish the taste.
After discovering how to modify her diet rather 
than giving up her native food, Esmeralda began 
to lose weight. She gradually lost 12 pounds 
over the next six months, and her blood glu­
cose began to fall to the point that it averaged 
132 mg/dl with a hemoglobin A1c of 6.9 percent. 
Because she made these changes for all mem­
bers of her family, everyone has benefited.

✓	The biggest problem is the large size of the portions. Try sharing or 
saving the food for another meal instead.
	
✓	A lot of exercise will reverse the damage of just about any dietary 
indiscretion.
	
✓	You can reduce the fat in your food, and it will still be delicious.
	
✓	You can reduce the salt and lower your blood pressure.
We want you to learn to eat to live — not live to eat. What you put in your 
mouth has a lot to do with your state of health, no matter where the food 
comes from.
Stocking Up with the Right Ingredients
Some common ingredients are used in many different recipes. Having them at 
hand is convenient, saving you needless trips to the market and more expo­
sure to foods you don’t need.
Some of the foods that belong in every kitchen or pantry (if you’re a vegetar­
ian, make the appropriate substitutions) include the following:
For the freezer:
Chicken breasts
Fruit juice concentrate
Egg substitute
Loaf of bread
Frozen fruit
Soft margarine
For the pantry:
Canned fruit
Oils (olive, canola, peanut)
Canned tomatoes
Onions
Canned tuna, salmon in water
Pasta
Dried fruit, unsugared
Pasta sauce
Evaporated skim milk
Peanut butter
Fat-free salad dressing
Potatoes
Fresh garlic
Red and white cooking wines
Fruit spreads
Reduced-calorie mayonnaise
Grains (rice, couscous)
Reduced-sodium broths
Ketchup
Reduced-sodium soy sauce
Legumes (peas, beans, lentils)
Sugar-free cocoa mix
Mustard
Tomato paste
Nonfat dry milk
Vinegars
Nonstick cooking sprays
Worcestershire sauce

For baking:
Baking powder
Extracts (vanilla, lemon, almond)
Baking soda
Flour (all-purpose, whole-wheat)
Cocoa powder
Rolled oats
Cornstarch
Semisweet chocolate
Cream of tartar
Sugar-free gelatin
Dry bread crumbs
Unflavored gelatin
Sweeteners:
Artificial sweeteners
Molasses
Honey
Sugar
Light maple syrup
Seasonings:
Dried herbs
Pepper
Fresh herbs and spices
Salt
With these ingredients, you’re ready for just about any of the recipes in the 
book. The exceptions are exotic ingredients, such as in ethnic foods, that you 
can buy in specialty stores as you need them.
	
Prepare a list of these ingredients and make multiple copies so that you can 
check off what you need before you go to the market. Leave a little space for 
the perishables such as fresh fruits, vegetables, milk, meat, fish, and poultry. 
In the next chapter, we tell you more about the process of shopping for these 
ingredients.
Using the Right Tools
Just as you wouldn’t try to bang in a nail with a shoe (especially with your 
foot inside), don’t try to cook without the right tools. Spending a little more 
at the beginning pays huge dividends later on. For example, get the best set 
of knives you can afford. They make all cutting jobs much easier, and they 
last a long time. Buy good nonstick pans; they make cooking without oils 
much easier.

58
Part I: Thriving with Diabetes 
Here’s the basic equipment that all kitchens should have in order to turn out 
delicious meals:
Chopping boards	
Pots and pans
Food processor	
Salad spinner
Knives	
Scales
Measuring cups and spoons	
Steamer with double boiler
Microwave	
Thermometers (for roasts and turkey)
Mixer with dough hook
Making Simple Modifications
You can make all kinds of simple modifications that will reduce calories and 
reduce the amounts of foods (such as those containing cholesterol) that you 
are trying to keep in check. You can see that many of the modifications take 
you in the direction of vegetarianism. You can easily do the following:
	
✓	Use skim milk instead of whole milk.
	
✓	Use cuts of meat that are low in fat instead of high-fat meats. Lowfat 
meats include lean beef, lean pork, and skinless white-meat poultry.
	
✓	Trim all visible fat off meats and poultry.
	
✓	Stay away from packaged luncheon meats, which tend to be high in fat.
	
✓	Select foods that are low in sodium and saturated fats (check the label 
on the food).
	
✓	Choose high-fiber foods like whole fruits, vegetables, and grains.
	
✓	Enjoy nonfat yogurt instead of sour cream.
	
✓	Have dressings, sauces, and gravies served on the side.
	
✓	Substitute lentils and beans for meat, fish, and poultry.
	
✓	Replace butter with olive oil, herbs, spices, or lemon juice.
	
✓	Prepare foods by baking, broiling, and so on — any method other than 
frying.
Use your imagination to come up with your own unique ways to cut calories 
and fat.

Taking Holiday Measures
This is a particularly good heading for this section, because the key to getting 
through a holiday in good diabetic control is to control the portions of every­
thing you eat during the holidays. Eating too much is easy.
If you encounter the “killer B,” a buffet table, vow to make only one trip. 
You’ll probably fill your plate with more food than you need, so plan to leave 
a large portion on the plate. Focus on the foods that you should eat and 
avoid high-fat and high-sugar foods, particularly desserts. Stick to fruits for 
high-fiber, low-calorie desserts.
If you’re invited to a potluck dinner, make something that you know will work 
for your nutritional plan. You can certainly find something in this book that 
fits for you. These recipes have all been taste-tested and are delicious, so 
you don’t have to think that you’re bringing something inferior. We suggest 
that you have a snack before you go to a party so that you don’t arrive feeling 
hungry.
Most important of all, try to forget the all-or-nothing mind-set. If you go off 
your nutritional plan once or twice, put the lapse behind you and get back to 
doing the things you know are right for you. The benefits will be immediate in 
the form of a general feeling of well-being and, of course, long-term in the fact 
that you won’t develop the long-term complications of diabetes.

You deserve the best, and that holds true for the food you eat as much as 
anything else. Of course, you could be like the man whose doctor told him 
that the best thing he could do for himself would be to get on a really good 
diet, stop chasing women, and stop drinking so much alcohol. The patient 
replied: “I don’t deserve the best. What about second best?” We hope you 
won’t settle for second best.
Going to the Market with a Plan
If you have a hobby, you’ve probably developed a series of steps by which 
you can accomplish your hobby in the most efficient manner, whether it’s 
painting pictures or raising tomatoes. If you paint pictures, you certainly 
wouldn’t start painting without deciding on a subject and buying the right 
paints, brushes, and canvas. If you raise tomatoes, you prepare the soil, add 
amendments such as manure, and buy the seeds or, more likely, the plants. 
You use a watering system as well as tomato cages to hold up your crop.
You should plan your excursion to the market in the same careful manner. 
Decide in advance what you need that complies with your nutritional plan. In 
Chapter 4, we give you a list of recommendations for the staples you should 

62
Part I: Thriving with Diabetes 
have at home. You can use those suggestions to make a shopping list to make 
sure that you purchase what you need. To that list, add the perishables that 
you’ll use immediately, such as meat and poultry or fish, milk and other dairy 
products, and, of course, fruits and vegetables.
	
Eat something before you go to the market so that you aren’t hungry as you 
walk down the aisles.
A market is like a huge menu set up to entice you. Most markets are set up 
in the same way. This setup is not by accident. It’s arranged to encourage 
you to buy. What people buy on the impulse of the moment is often the most 
calorie-concentrated and expensive food that is least appropriate for them. 
You’ll find that all the perishable food is arranged around the perimeter 
of the market. The high-calorie foods are in the aisles in the middle of the 
store. Unless you want to take the long way around, you must go through 
those aisles to get to the meat, milk, fruit, and vegetables. You pass the loose 
candies, the cookies, the high-sugar cereals, and all the other no-nos. If you 
prepare a list and buy only from the list, you won’t purchase any of those 
foods. Walking into the market hungry and without a list is dangerous for 
your health.
	
Sometimes the market employs a person who is trained to help people with 
medical conditions avoid bad choices. Check with your market to find out 
whether such a person is on staff, and spend some time touring the aisles with 
him or her. You’ll get some valuable insights that will make handling a shop­
ping trip easier.
Some keys to shopping the market most effectively include the following:
	
✓	Shop at the same market each time.
	
✓	Shop as seldom as you can.
	
✓	Go to the market when it is not crowded.
	
✓	Don’t walk every aisle.
	
✓	Don’t be tempted by free samples. They’re usually high in calories to 
appeal to your taste buds.
	
✓	If you bring your kids (not advisable) to the store, make sure that they 
aren’t hungry.
	
✓	Be especially careful in the checkout lane, where stores force you to run 
through a gauntlet of goodies — none of which are good for you.
Most markets offer a variety of sections. Each one presents a different chal­
lenge and requires a different strategy. You should probably work your way 
around the market from the bottom of the food pyramid to the top, choosing 

63
 Chapter 5: How the Supermarket Can Help
lots of grains, fewer fruits, vegetables, and dairy and meat products, and 
fats and sweets least of all. (Check out Chapter 2 for more about the food 
pyramid.)
	
The supermarket isn’t the only place where you can find good food. Check 
out your local farmer’s market. Most areas have these markets, and many are 
open all year. And be sure to look into specialty food stores where you can 
find some of the more exotic ingredients.
The bakery
You can really make a dent in your diet in the bakery section, where all the 
desserts are on display. These foods usually contain too much fat and car­
bohydrate; however, you don’t have to give up all your “treats.” The key is 
to figure a rich dessert into your meal plan, but only on an occasional basis. 
Remember to keep the portion small, in any case.
Muffins and pastries are usually high in fat, but in deference to the popular 
belief that fat makes us fat, stores now sell lowfat muffins and pastries. The 
problem is that these still contain many calories, so don’t overdo it. Try a 
smaller portion or share your muffin with a friend. A popular choice is angel 
food cake, but watch out because, even though it’s totally fat-free, it’s filled 
with calories. You can enjoy a small portion.
	
Select breads that have at least 2 grams of fiber per slice and whole-grain 
breads. Bagels and English muffins should be whole-grain as well. Don’t forget 
that they’re usually too large, so plan on eating a serving of half or less. (That 
goes for any bread.) If you eat too much, you’ll consume too many calories.
Produce
Fruits and vegetables are in the produce section. Stores continue to offer the 
usual apples, pears, and bananas, but today they stock more fruits and vege­
tables that you may never have seen before. Here is where you can add some 
real variety to your diet. Try some of these new items, and you may discover 
that you can substitute them for the cakes, pies, and other concentrated calo­
rie foods that you now eat. For example, you may find that you like some of 
the new varieties of melons, which are sweet and have a great texture.
The other benefit to trying new fruits and vegetables is that you get a variety 
of vitamins and minerals from the different sources. Each differently colored 
vegetable provides different vitamins, so pick out a variety of colors.

64
Part I: Thriving with Diabetes 
To prolong their season, you can freeze some of the fruits, especially the ber­
ries, and use them as you need them.
	
Remember that dried fruits have very concentrated carbohydrate and should 
be used sparingly.
Root vegetables need no refrigeration but must be kept in a cool, dry place. 
Most of the other vegetables must go in the refrigerator.
The dairy case
At the dairy case, you can make some very positive diet modifications. Go 
for the lowest fat content you can eat, but don’t neglect the dairy part of the 
food guide pyramid. That’s where you get calcium. Try to find lowfat cheeses, 
yogurt, and cottage cheese. You can even buy cheeses that aren’t lowfat if 
you use them sparingly. Go for 1 percent or even skim milk if possible.
The deli counter
	
A deli counter offers luncheon meats and prepared foods. Recent studies 
show that these processed meats are dangerous to your health. These foods 
often contain a lot of salt and fat. You probably want to avoid most of the 
foods in this area (with the exception of prepared chicken, which is often spit-
roasted and very tasty). Even the lowfat meats in this section are rich in salt. 
The pickled foods may also contain a great deal of salt, despite being low in 
calories and free of fat.
If you choose salads from this area, pick out those that contain oil instead of 
cream. Don’t be afraid to ask a deli employee about the exact ingredients in 
these prepared foods. In some cases, lower-fat versions are available. People 
often prefer fatty foods — and the grocery obviously wants people to buy the 
food — so the market caters to those preferences.
The fresh meat and fish counter
The fresh meat and fish counter provides some good choices for your pro­
tein needs. At the meat counter, buy no more than a normal serving for each 
member of the family. Just because the meat attendant has cut a 12-ounce 
piece of swordfish doesn’t mean that you have to buy the whole thing. You 
are entitled to get just the piece you want. For convenience, you can get two 

65
 Chapter 5: How the Supermarket Can Help
servings at one time if you know you have the willpower to save the second 
serving for another meal. Ask the attendant to cut the fish in half so you 
aren’t tempted to eat the whole thing.
	
Don’t forget that lentils and other legumes can provide protein as well.
The same study mentioned above that criticized processed meats found 
that people who eat meat in general are heavier and have more diabetes 
than those who don’t. Look for lowfat cuts of meat. The best choices for 
you are top round, sirloin, and flank steak. These tend to be the leanest cuts 
of meat and are also very tasty. When buying chopped meat (for hamburg­
ers, for example), consider how you plan to cook it. If you like meat cooked 
well done, you don’t always have to choose the package with the lowest fat 
content, because the fat may be cooked out. Otherwise, look for lower-fat 
chopped meat.
Try to buy skinless poultry to eliminate a major source of the fat in chicken. 
You may have to cook it a shorter time, or you can barbecue the chicken 
using an indirect method (place the coals along the sides of the chicken 
rather than underneath). The chicken will be much juicier and not dried out.
	
Try to eat fish at least twice a week because of the positive effect it has on 
blood fats. Remember that a “fatty” fish such as salmon is good for you but 
adds extra fat calories.
The fresh meat and fish counter usually offers breaded or battered fish to 
make your life easier; you only have to put it in the oven. The problem is that 
the breading or batter often contains too much butter, fat, and salt. Ask the 
person serving you for a list of the ingredients in the breading or batter. Or 
better yet, skip the prepared fish and head for the fresh. If you notice a very 
fishy smell, then the fish is not very fresh.
Frozen foods and diet meals
When the season for your favorite fresh fruits and vegetables is over, the 
frozen food section may stock these items. However, because markets now 
often bring in more varieties of fresh food from all over the world year-round, 
you may not need to turn to frozen products as much.
	
Food manufacturers are producing a variety of frozen foods, which you can 
heat in the microwave oven. These meals are often high in fat and salt, how­
ever. Be sure to read the food label, which we explain later in this chapter. 
Avoid frozen foods mixed with cream or cheese sauces.

66
Part I: Thriving with Diabetes 
Diet meals can be a good choice if you want to save time in preparation. The 
frozen diet meals are low in calories and often low in salt and fat as well. 
Most diet meals have no more than 350 kilocalories and usually taste good. If 
you have type 1 diabetes and need to count carbohydrates, they’re listed on 
the box.
Healthy Choice, Lean Cuisine, and Weight Watchers are the three main 
makers of diet meals, all of which can be counted on for low calories and 
good taste. Healthy Choice is the lowest in salt. Grocery stores usually have 
one brand or another on sale, so you can choose the least expensive brand 
when you shop.
Are frozen diet foods a good choice for you? Many of our patients complain 
that they lack time to prepare the “right” foods. For those people, prepared 
diet meals work very well. For the person who likes to involve him or herself 
in food preparation — for example, people who bought this book for the won­
derful recipes — this is not the way to go.
Low-carbohydrate foods are also being made by many of the food manufac­
turers. See our discussion of the various types of diets in Chapter 3 for ways 
that these foods can fit in your nutrition plan.
Canned and bottled foods
Canned and bottled foods can be healthful and can help you quickly make 
recipes calling for ingredients such as tomato sauce. Check the Nutrition 
Facts label (covered later in this chapter) to determine what kind of liquid 
a food is canned in. Oil adds a lot of fat calories, so look for the same food 
canned in water.
Canned vegetables often contain too much salt, so look for low-salt varieties. 
Canned fruits often contain too much sweetener, so you’re better off with 
fresh if possible.
	
Watch for this marketing trick: Stores often display higher-priced canned 
foods at eye level and lower priced products on lower shelves. Also, store 
brands are often less expensive and just as good as name brands.
Bottled foods include fruit juice drinks, which are high in sugar and low in 
nutrition. You’re better off drinking pure fruit juice rather than a juice drink 
diluted with other ingredients.
The same principle is true for bottled and canned soda, which has no nutri­
tional value and lots of calories. Substitute water for this expensive and 

67
 Chapter 5: How the Supermarket Can Help
basically worthless food that really doesn’t quench your thirst (soft drinks 
often leave an aftertaste, especially the diet drinks). Try adding lemon or lime 
to your water or use the flavored calorie-free water drinks.
You can find lowfat or fat-free salad dressing and mayonnaise in this area. 
Better yet, try using mustard and some of the other condiments to spice up 
your salads without adding many calories.
The best choices for snacks
You probably frequently feel like eating a little something between meals. 
Your choice of foods may make the difference between weight gain and 
weight control, between high blood glucose levels and normal levels. 
Here are the best selections to choose as you make your way around the 
supermarket:
	
✓	Baked chips: Avoid fried chips, which add lots of fat calories. An ounce 
of baked chips amounts to 110 kilocalories.
	
✓	Flavored rice cakes: These items are filling without calories.
	
✓	Fruit and fig bars: These items can satisfy hunger without many kilocal­
ories. A couple of Fig Newmans, for example, will set you back only 120 
kilocalories.
	
✓	Lowfat granola: Watch out for regular granola, which is high in calories. 
Depending on the brand, 1⁄2 cup of lowfat granola contains 220 to 250 
kilocalories.
	
✓	Plain popcorn: If you prepare it in an air-popping machine or a microwave 
oven, it contains only 30 kilocalories per cup and is free of salt and fat.
	
✓	Raisins and other dried fruit: Stick to small portions. A quarter of a cup 
of raisins is only 130 kilocalories.
The preceding list should give you enough choices to satisfy your hunger 
without wrecking your diabetic control.
Deciphering the Mysterious Food Label
Most packaged foods have a food label known as the Nutrition Facts label, 
which isn’t really mysterious if you know how to interpret it. It was designed 
to be understood. Figure 5-1 shows a typical food label. The contents of the 
Nutrition Facts label are regulated by the Food and Drug Administration.

68
Part I: Thriving with Diabetes 
	
Figure 5-1: 
A Nutrition 
Facts food 
label.
	
The label in Figure 5-1 is from a 1-pound container of cottage cheese with 
fruit. You can find the following information on the label:
	
✓	Serving Size: The serving size is the portion of the total contents that 
makes up one serving. Most packaged foods serve more than one person 
so don’t be fooled.
	
✓	Servings Per Container: At 1⁄2 cup, this container holds 4 servings.
	
✓	Calories: The number of kilocalories in a serving — in this case, 120 
kilocalories.
	
✓	Calories from Fat: The number of fat kilocalories in each serving.
	
✓	% Daily Value: The nutrient amounts appear in grams or milligrams and 
also as % Daily Value. The % Daily Value refers to the percentage of the 
daily value for a person on a 2,000-kilocalorie-per-day diet.
	
✓	Total Fat: The total fat is 1.5 grams, of which 1.0 is saturated fat. The fact 
that there’s less than 3 grams of fat allows the producer to refer to this 
product as lowfat.
	
✓	Saturated Fat: The amount of the fat in each serving that is saturated.
	
✓	Cholesterol: This food provides little cholesterol. Therefore, the 
producer could call it “low cholesterol” because that term applies 
if the product provides less than 20 milligrams of cholesterol and 
2 grams or less of saturated fat per serving (see Chapter 2 for more 
information).
	
✓	Sodium: At 290 milligrams of sodium, this food provides 12% of the 
sodium allowed in a 2,000-kilocalorie-a-day diet.

69
 Chapter 5: How the Supermarket Can Help
	
✓	Total Carbohydrate: As a person with diabetes, you need to know the 
grams of carbohydrate in a serving, both to fit it into your nutritional 
plan and to determine insulin needs if that is what you take.
	
✓	Dietary Fiber: This food provides no fiber, so all the carbohydrate is 
digestible. If fiber were present, you could subtract the fiber grams from 
the total grams of carbohydrate to get the actual grams from carbohy­
drate absorbed.
	
✓	Sugars: The fact that 14 of the 15 grams of carbohydrate come from 
sugar means that the sugar will be absorbed rapidly.
	
✓	Protein: As a person with diabetes, you’re most concerned with the 
grams of protein in a portion. The figure for % Daily Value doesn’t help 
you in planning your diet.
	
✓	Vitamins and Minerals: Usually, the label provides the % Daily Value 
for vitamin A, vitamin C, calcium, and iron. Some food labels follow that 
information with a list of ingredients, but this information isn’t required 
as part of the Nutrition Facts label.
Making Good Choices
Thanks to the food labels, you can choose foods that are lower in calories, 
lower in fat, and have more nutritional value. You can compare foods next to 
one another and choose the healthier item. For example:
	
✓	Smart Balance has only 60 kcal per tablespoon while I Can’t Believe It’s 
Not Butter has 90 kcal per tablespoon.
	
✓	Uncle Ben’s Fast and Natural Whole Grain Instant Brown Rice has 170 
kcal per cup while Uncle Ben’s Ready Rice Whole Grain Brown has 240 
kcal per cup.
	
✓	Nature’s Own Double Fiber Wheat Bread has 100 kcal per 2 slices while 
Arnold Double Fiber Whole Wheat Bread has 200 kcal per 2 slices.
	
✓	Annie’s Naturals Buttermilk Dressing has 60 kcal in 2 tablespoons 
while Ken’s Steak House Thousand Islands Dressing has 140 kcal per 
2 tablespoons.
	
✓	Campbell’s Healthy Request Condensed Chicken Noodle Soup has 60 
kcal per cup while Campbell’s Condensed Vegetable Soup has 100 kcal 
per cup.

70
Part I: Thriving with Diabetes 
I could go on and on like this but you get the idea. There are tons of good 
choices that have fewer calories and often more fiber, vitamins, and minerals 
than the bad choices. You just need to spend a little time and look at the labels.
	
Be sure you are comparing one serving to one serving. If you compare 
one serving to two servings, the larger item is bound to have many more 
calories.
	
The best way to verify that your trip to the market has been successful is 
to evaluate the contents of your grocery sacks. The division of the contents 
should look similar to the food guide pyramid (see Chapter 2).

A
 big part of keeping your blood sugar steady 
is eating regularly. Typically, the longest 
break without food during a day comes at night. 
While your body rests and revitalizes itself, your 
blood glucose level takes a nosedive. Start your 
day the right way with a healthy balanced break­
fast each and every day.
Choose a quick scrambled egg and whole-wheat 
toast if you’re in a hurry. But brush up on the reci­
pes in this chapter for a change of pace. By plan­
ning ahead, you can make a delicious breakfast 
that’s anything but boring.
Understanding Diabetic Breakfasts
Breakfast is a critical meal for a diabetic. Getting your day off to a steady, 
balanced start sets you up for success the rest of the day. Check out Chapter 
4 if you need help planning your meals for the day based on your individual 
needs. The following sections can help you make the right breakfast choices.
Figuring out which fruit is right for you
Fruit doesn’t have to be a dirty word for a diabetic. While it’s true that fruit is 
full of natural sugars and your body processes them quickly, you don’t have 
to (and shouldn’t) mark them off your list completely.

Whole fruit, rather than juice, is a better choice for diabetics. The fiber and 
skin in whole fruit slow down the digestion of the fruit, resulting in a more 
gradual rise in your blood sugar level.
Here’s a list of fruits with a lower glycemic index (which I discuss in more 
detail in Chapter 2):
	
✓	Apples
	
✓	Apricots
	
✓	Blueberries
	
✓	Cherries
	
✓	Grapefruit
	
✓	Kiwis
	
✓	Strawberries
And just for balance, here are a few fruits with a higher glycemic index:
	
✓	Cantaloupe
	
✓	Dates
	
✓	Pineapple
	
✓	Raisins
	
✓	Watermelon
	
Just because a fruit has a higher glycemic index doesn’t mean you can’t eat it. 
Just take it into consideration when you plan when you eat it and what you eat 
with it.
Putting together protein-packed punches
Eggs aren’t the only breakfast protein. In fact, many diabetics must limit 
their intake of cholesterol, and eggs are an easy target for removal. (Check 
out “Enjoying Egg-ceptional Dishes,” later in this chapter, for smart ways 
to include eggs at breakfast.) Consider other nontraditional choices when 
you’re making your breakfast changes. Here’s a list of protein-rich foods that 
might make a good addition to your breakfast table:
	
✓	1 turkey hot dog wrapped in a whole-wheat tortilla
	
✓	1 ounce boiled shrimp with cocktail sauce
	
✓	2 tablespoons of peanut butter on whole-wheat toast
	
✓	1 slice turkey wrapped around lowfat string cheese

75
 Chapter 6: The Benefits of Breakfast
	
✓	4-ounce grilled chicken breast
	
✓	1⁄4 cup cottage cheese with diced grape tomatoes
Starting with Whole-Grain Goodness
When you received your diagnosis of diabetes, maybe you thought your days 
of eating waffles and pancakes were over. Although starting the morning off 
with pancakes dripping with butter and maple syrup is probably not in your 
current eating plan, you can still enjoy relatively sweet treats in the morning, 
especially if you use whole grains.
Refined grains are processed to remove the bran and the hull, and along with 
them, up to 90 percent of the nutrients, including vitamins E and B. Whole 
grains have a lower glycemic index than refined grains. So whole grains are 
less likely to send your blood glucose soaring and then dipping. The protein, 
fat, and fiber in whole grains slow their absorption into the bloodstream. In 
addition, whole grains make you feel fuller and stay fuller longer.
	
Read labels carefully to ensure that the food you’re getting is made from whole 
grains. Don’t just look for “wheat” bread; make sure it says “whole wheat.” 
Some manufactures add caramel color or molasses to refined flour and sell 
the bread as “wheat bread,” potentially confusing hopeful healthy eaters.
	
T Warm Blueberry Oats
This recipe makes any morning special. It’s just as quick as “regular” oatmeal, but 
adding fresh blueberries gives your antioxidant levels a boost and your taste buds a 
treat. If fresh blueberries aren’t in season, you can substitute frozen. Choose blueber­
ries frozen without additional sugars and thaw them before adding them to your cereal. 
You can see this dish in the color section.
Preparation time: 5 minutes
Cooking time: 3 minutes
Yield: 2 servings
1 cup rolled oats
2 cups water
2 teaspoons honey
1 cup fresh blueberries
	 1	In a microwave-safe bowl, combine the oats and water. Microwave on high for 3 minutes.
	 2	Remove the bowl from the microwave and stir in the honey and then the blueberries.

T Breakfast Polenta with Apples, 
	
Walnuts, and Maple Syrup 
Polenta is essentially cornmeal that’s cooked slowly and flavored with cheese, herbs, 
and tomatoes as a savory side dish. Tante Marie’s cooking school (www.tantemarie.
com) in San Francisco developed this breakfast polenta recipe, served with sautéed 
apples and walnuts.
Preparation time: 15 minutes
Cooking time: 45 minutes 
Yield: 4 servings
1 quart water
1 cup polenta-type cornmeal
1⁄2 teaspoon salt
2 tablespoons soy or yogurt margarine
1⁄2 cup nonfat ricotta cheese
1 tablespoon maple syrup
2 tart green cooking apples
1 tablespoon walnut oil
1 tablespoon sugar
1⁄4 cup fresh walnuts
Maple (or apple) syrup to taste
	 1	Bring the liquid to a boil in a heavy-bottomed pot on the top of the stove. Whisk in the 
polenta and salt. Cook very slowly over low heat stirring constantly with a wooden 
spoon until the spoon can stand up, supported in the mixture. This usually takes about 
20 minutes. Stir in the margarine, ricotta, and maple syrup. Cover and keep warm. (If 
you are going to hold it awhile before serving, stir in 1⁄2 cup or more water.)
	 2	Peel, core, and slice the apples in 1⁄2-inch slices. Heat walnut oil in a medium-sized sauté 
pan over medium-high heat. Add the sliced apples; sprinkle with the sugar. Continue to 
cook the apples, turning occasionally, until the apples are soft when pierced with a fork. 
Set aside.
	 3	Meanwhile, heat a separate small sauté pan over medium-high heat. Add the walnuts, 
tossing until slightly toasted. Remove from heat.
	
	To serve, place a serving of polenta in a bowl, cover with apples, sprinkle with walnuts, 
and serve with 1⁄2 cup nonfat Greek yogurt for extra protein (adds 60 calories).

Skip the butter because these waffles are delicious without it. If you don’t feel 
like you can go cold turkey, look for a spread, such as Brummel and Brown 
Yogurt Spread or Smart Balance Buttery Spread, that contains no trans fat.
	
T Whole-Wheat Waffles
This recipe is reason alone to invest in a waffle iron. Look for one with nonstick coating 
for easy waffle removal. Make sure you let the batter rest for the full 11⁄2 hours before 
making the waffles. You’ll get waffles with a much lighter texture and better flavor.
Preparation time: 90 minutes
Cooking time: 4 minutes per waffle
Yield: 4 servings
1 cup evaporated skim milk
1 teaspoon active dry yeast
1 cup whole-wheat flour
1⁄2 teaspoon orange zest
1⁄8 teaspoon vanilla extract
2 packets Splenda
Nonstick cooking spray
	 1	Warm the milk and dissolve the yeast in it. In a bowl, mix the yeast mixture with the 
flour, orange zest, vanilla, and Splenda. Let sit, covered, at room temperature for 11⁄2 
hours.
	 2	Using a waffle maker coated with nonstick cooking spray, prepare the waffles, following 
the manufacturer’s instructions.
Tip: Instead of syrup, serve these beauties with Warm Pineapple Salsa. You can find the 
recipe in Chapter 7.

T Blueberry and Almond Pancakes
Blueberries are the best source of antioxidants compared with all other fruits. Almonds 
are also the best nut source of another antioxidant, vitamin E. Enjoy the tasty fruit and 
crunchy nuts along with this breakfast favorite, shown in the color section.
Preparation time: 10 minutes
Cooking time: 5 to 7 minutes
Yield: 4 servings (total 16 pancakes)
1⁄2 cup all-purpose flour
3⁄4 cup whole-wheat flour
2 teaspoons apple juice concentrate
2 teaspoons baking powder
1⁄4 teaspoon salt
11⁄2 teaspoons unsweetened applesauce
11⁄4 cups lowfat milk
1⁄8 teaspoon almond extract
3 egg whites, or 6 tablespoons egg substitute
3⁄4 cup fresh blueberries, or frozen berries, 
thawed
1 tablespoon almond slivers, crushed
Nonstick cooking spray
	 1	In a bowl, combine the all-purpose flour, whole-wheat flour, apple juice concentrate, 
baking powder, and salt; set aside.
	 2	In another bowl, combine the applesauce, milk, almond extract, egg whites, blueberries, 
and almonds; stir well. Add the flour mixture. Stir until you achieve a fairly smooth 
batter consistency, approximately 2 minutes. Feel free to leave a few lumps, because 
overmixing can result in a tougher finished pancake.
	 3	Coat a large skillet with the cooking spray; place over medium heat until hot. Spoon 1⁄4

T Greek Breakfast Pita
This is a great handheld breakfast for anyone on the go. Look for whole-wheat pitas in 
the specialty bread or deli section of your grocery store. Use a combination of whole 
eggs and egg whites to keep the flavor and pump up the portion size but reduce the 
cholesterol.
Preparation time: 20 minutes
Cooking time: 8 to 11 minutes
Yield: 4 servings
Nonstick cooking spray
4 whole-wheat pitas
1 tablespoon unsalted butter
1⁄2 small onion, finely chopped
1⁄2 cup chopped fresh spinach
1⁄8 teaspoon garlic powder
1⁄8 teaspoon pepper
2 medium red potatoes, baked, small diced
4 whole eggs
8 egg whites
1⁄2 cup feta cheese, very small chunks
	 1	Preheat the oven to 350 degrees. Coat a baking sheet with the cooking spray and place 
the pitas on the baking sheet.
	 2	Melt the butter in a large, deep skillet over medium heat. Sauté the onions in the butter 
until tender, 3 to 4 minutes. Add the spinach, garlic powder, and pepper. Sauté for 3 
minutes. Add the potatoes. In a bowl, whisk together the eggs and egg whites. Add the 
egg mixture to the skillet. Cook over medium heat, stirring occasionally, until the eggs 
are cooked soft, 3 to 4 minutes.
	 3	Spoon the egg mixture into the pitas. Sprinkle the cheese on top. Bake for 5 to 7 min­
utes, until the cheese melts.
Tip: The next time you serve baked potatoes at dinner, make a couple of extra so you have 
them handy to make this delicious breakfast even speedier.

Stocking Up on Baked Goods
Having diabetes doesn’t mean you have to deprive yourself of the ease (and 
deliciousness!) of grabbing a muffin, biscuit, or slice of quick bread. Plan 
ahead and keep some of these heart-healthy handfuls on hand for breakfast 
on the go.

We help you ease into using whole grains in this section by using a blend of 
all-purpose (white) flour and whole-wheat flour. You can find whole-wheat 
flour in the baking aisle in just about any grocery store. 
	
T Zucchini Bread
This bread makes a regular appearance in my household. It’s full of fiber and vitamins, 
making it an excellent choice. Don’t bother peeling the zucchini before grating it. Just 
wash it and grate away. Double the recipe and freeze the second loaf. You’ll definitely 
use it!
Preparation time: 12 minutes
Cooking time: 45 minutes to 1 hour
Yield: 18 to 20 servings
Nonstick cooking spray
11⁄2 cups whole-wheat flour
11⁄2 cups all-purpose flour

T Sweet Potato Biscuits
Here’s a great way to discover sweet potatoes, if you haven’t already. They impart a del­
icate sweetness to these biscuits. Plus, sweet potatoes are another one of those “good 
for the eye” foods, being full of carotenoids and beta carotene. They also supply a full 
day’s worth of vitamin C, a decent dose of dietary fiber, and delicious flavor to boot. 
You can see these biscuits in the color section.
Preparation time: 25 minutes
Cooking time: 12 minutes
Yield: 6 servings (12 biscuits total)
1 cup all-purpose flour
1 cup whole-wheat flour
21⁄2 teaspoons baking powder
1⁄4 teaspoon baking soda
1⁄4 teaspoon salt
2 tablespoons butter
1⁄2 cup buttermilk
2⁄3 cup mashed cooked sweet potatoes
Nonstick cooking spray
	 1	Preheat the oven to 425 degrees. In a bowl, combine the all-purpose flour, whole-wheat 
flour, baking powder, baking soda, and salt. With a pastry blender or fork, work in the 
butter until the mixture is coarse (see Figure 6-1).
	 2	In another bowl, combine the buttermilk and mashed sweet potatoes. Add to the flour 
mixture and mix until just moistened.
	 3	Transfer the dough to a lightly floured surface. Knead 2 or 3 times, until smooth (see 
Figure 6-2). Roll out the dough 1⁄2-inch thick. Using a 2-inch biscuit cutter, dipped in 
flour, cut out 12 rounds.
	 4	Coat a baking sheet with the cooking spray. Arrange the rounds on the baking sheet. 
Bake for 12 minutes, until golden brown.
Tip: Use White Lily brand flour and whole-wheat pastry flour for more-tender biscuits.

Enjoying Egg-ceptional Dishes
Choosing eggs gives you a protein power punch to start your day. This 
simple food is an ideal source of protein, containing all essential amino acids. 
Eggs are also a source of B complex vitamins, vitamin A, vitamin D, vitamin E, 
selenium, and zinc. However, egg yolks also contain a significant amount of 
cholesterol. Consequently, low-cholesterol diets restrict the number of eggs 
allowed each week. People with diabetes should limit their eggs to a couple 
per week for the same reason.
	
One great way to enjoy eggs but limit your cholesterol is to enjoy egg whites 
or use a combination of whole eggs and egg whites. The egg yolk (the yellow 
center) contains the dreaded cholesterol, so limiting your intake of yolks may 
be enough to keep egg whites on your list.
Baking egg pies and quiches
These baked breakfast egg dishes are a great way to make delicious, healthy 
meals for a group. They’re a great choice for elegant brunch entertaining or a

weekday when you have a little extra time. Alternately, you can make a pie or 
quiche, cool it completely, and then cut it into individual servings and freeze 
them for later.
	
Broccoli and Cheese Pie
Broccoli is one of the best sources of antioxidants out there, meaning it’s full of disease-
fighting agents. It’s great fresh, steamed, baked, or microwaved. If possible, avoid boil­
ing it in liquid that you’ll later discard, because you remove too many of its healthy 
nutrients. Enjoy it in this cheesy crust-free “pie.”
Preparation time: 20 minutes
Cooking time: 30 minutes
Yield: 4 servings
Nonstick cooking spray
1 cup fresh broccoli, small florets
1⁄2 cup low-sodium chicken broth
2 egg whites, lightly beaten
1 whole egg, lightly beaten
1 cup skim milk
1 cup shredded cheddar cheese
 1⁄4 teaspoon pepper
	 1	Preheat the oven to 350 degrees. Coat a 9-inch pie pan with the cooking spray.
	 2	In a saucepan, cook the broccoli with the chicken broth, uncovered, over medium heat, 
stirring, until all liquid has evaporated, about 10 minutes. Transfer to a bowl and chill in 
the refrigerator for 5 minutes.
	 3	In another bowl, whisk together the egg whites and egg. Add the broccoli, milk, cheese, 
and pepper.
	 4	Pour the mixture into the pie pan and bake, uncovered, for 30 minutes, and check with 
a toothpick for doneness. (The pie may need to bake for up to 45 minutes.) Remove 
from the oven and cool.

T Tuscan Quiche 
This vegetarian quiche from Sublime in Ft. Lauderdale, Florida (www.sublime
restaurant.com) is high in protein but low in cholesterol thanks to the tofu, soy 
mozzarella cheese, and nutritional yeast.
Look for nutritional yeast in the bulk section of your local natural food store. It’s a com­
plete protein and high in vitamin B-12. With its strong, nutty, cheesy flavor, it’s used as 
a cheese substitute.
This dish can be served either with or without the crust. We provide nutritional infor­
mation for both presentations. 
Preparation time: 30 minutes
Cooking time: 40 minutes
Yield: 6 servings
Filling:
24 ounces extra firm tofu
8 ounces vegan soy mozzarella
1 tablespoon olive oil
1⁄2 cup chopped fine garlic
1⁄2 cup chopped fine shallots
1 16-ounce can quartered artichoke hearts (in 
water)
1 pound blanched chopped spinach
Salt and pepper to taste
2 tablespoons nutritional yeast
1 tablespoon granulated onion
1 tablespoon granulated garlic
Crust:
1 cup whole-wheat pastry flour
2 tablespoons soy margarine
Kosher salt
4 tablespoons ice cold water
	 1	Make the filling. Chop tofu and mozzarella into cubes, place in a food processor, and 
mix until smooth. Place the mixture in a bowl and chill. 
	 2	Meanwhile, add 2 tablespoons olive oil, garlic, and shallots in a sauté pan. Sauté until 
ingredients are translucent. Add the artichoke hearts and spinach to the pan and mix 
well. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Allow this mixture to cool and then add it to 
the tofu mixture. Add in the dry spices and stir well. Check for seasoning. Place the mix­
ture in the fridge until ready to use.

85
 Chapter 6: The Benefits of Breakfast
	 3	Meanwhile, preheat the oven to 350 degrees. On a cutting board, cut margarine into 
flour and salt. Quickly add in the water, one tablespoon at a time, until the mixture 
forms into a solid dough mass. Roll the dough out to a half-inch thick pancake, and then 
drape it over an oiled 9-inch pie pan, tucking in all the corners. Bake for 15 minutes or 
until golden brown. Remove from the oven, cool. 
	 4	Place the tofu mixture into the cooked pie shell. Smooth out the mixture and return to 
the oven for 25 minutes. Remove from the oven. 
	 5	Cool until the center is firm; slice and serve.

Trying your hand at omelets and frittatas
Omelets and frittatas (open-faced omelets) are among the best and easiest 
ways to get a burst of protein to start your day. In this section, we give you 
several flavorful recipes to keep your taste buds hopping. 
Facing facts about feta cheese
If you haven’t tried this terrific Greek cheese, 
here’s your chance. It’s a soft, salty cheese 
that has a tangy bite. It crumbles very easily, 
and is an easy addition to salads, eggs, or 
stuffed in olives. The commercially available 
variety is made from cow’s milk and sold in 
small squares, usually in plastic tubs covered 
in plastic wrap. You can find it in the gourmet or 
specialty cheese section of your local grocery.
One of the best things about feta is its strong 
flavor. A little can go a long way. So if you’re 
looking for flavor but don’t want to weigh down 
your food with lots of cheese and fat, feta’s a 
good choice. Look for flavored feta cheese for 
a change of pace. You can find it blended with 
sun-dried tomatoes and basil, and peppercorns.

T Greek Omelet
You can be creative here. The essential Greek ingredients are the feta and spinach. But, 
add any veggies you like — the more the better! Good choices include artichoke hearts, 
red peppers, onions, zucchini, or asparagus. Just throw them in at Step 2 and cook 
them until they’re tender. Enjoy!
Preparation time: 5 minutes
Cooking time: 10 minutes
Yield: 2 servings
Nonstick cooking spray
1⁄2 cup diced green peppers
1⁄2 cup sliced mushrooms
1⁄8 teaspoon dried marjoram, crumbled
1 cup chopped spinach
2 whole eggs
4 egg whites
1⁄2 cup crumbled feta cheese
1 small plum tomato, seeded and chopped
	 1	Coat a large skillet with the cooking spray and place over medium heat. Sauté the pep­
pers, mushrooms, and marjoram until the vegetables are tender, approximately 6 min­
utes. Add the spinach and cook until wilted, roughly 4 minutes.
	 2	In a bowl mix together the eggs and egg whites. Pour the egg mixture over the spinach 
mixture in the skillet. Cook over low heat, stirring occasionally until the eggs are almost 
cooked. Top with the feta cheese and tomatoes and cover until the eggs are puffy, 
approximately 5 minutes. Fold the omelet in half and serve.

T Vegetable Frittata
Because a frittata is finished in the oven, make sure you choose an oven-safe skillet. This 
frittata recipe from Tante Marie’s cooking school in San Francisco, is full of vegetables, 
vitamins, and flavor. It makes a great dinner as well, so don’t just save it for breakfast. 
Preparation time: 25 minutes
Cooking time: 15 minutes
Yield: 4 servings

87
 Chapter 6: The Benefits of Breakfast
	 1	Bring a medium-sized pot of water to the boil. Cut the florets of the broccoli into 1⁄2-inch 
pieces; save the stems for another use like soup. When the water is boiling, sprinkle 
with salt. Add the broccoli florets. Cook rapidly for about 6 minutes, until the broccoli 
is tender when pierced with a fork. Drain the broccoli in a colander and let cool. Set 
aside. 
	 2	In a mixing bowl, combine eggs, egg whites, and water. Blend thoroughly. Set aside. 
	 3	Meanwhile, in a 12-inch oven-safe non-stick sauté pan, cook the onions in the olive oil 
until soft (3 to 5 minutes). Add the garlic and cook another minute. Add the spinach and 
cook until wilted. Spread the broccoli over the onion and spinach mixture in the sauté 
pan. Sprinkle with salt and pepper. Mix together ricotta and white cheese, and spread 
over broccoli. Pour egg mixture over the broccoli. 
	 4	Preheat the broiler. 
	 5	With a rubber spatula, gently move the vegetables around, making sure the egg goes 
throughout the broccoli mixture on the bottom of the pan. Don’t stir the mixture, but 
gently move the vegetables, allowing the liquid eggs to reach the surface of the pan. Let 
the mixture cook over medium-high heat so that a crust forms on the bottom of the pan. 
With a fork, lift the edges of the frittata and tilt the pan to let the runny eggs go 
underneath. 
	 6	When the whole mixture is set, top with the Parmesan cheese and place under the 
broiler briefly, likely 3 minutes or so, until the top is golden. Serve in wedges for lunch 
or supper or cut into squares for hors d’oeuvres.

T Omelet with Wild Mushrooms 
Wild mushrooms are full of delicious earthy flavor. Tante Marie’s cooking school in San 
Francisco developed this recipe with fresh herbs and exotic mushrooms. 
Preparation time: 25 minutes
Cooking time: 15 minutes
Yield: 4 servings
8 eggs
4 egg whites
3 tablespoons cold water
1 tablespoon olive oil, divided
4 medium shallots, minced
8 ounces wild or domestic mushrooms, 
brushed of dirt and cut in 1⁄4-inch slices or 
pieces
1⁄4 cup fresh chives, minced
1⁄4 cup fresh thyme, minced
Coarse salt, to taste
Freshly ground black pepper, to taste
1⁄4 cup nonfat ricotta cheese
	 1	Crack the eggs and add egg whites into a bowl. Add water, and beat with a fork until the 
mixture is one color. Set aside.
	 2	Heat 1⁄2 tablespoon olive oil in a small sauté pan, over medium-high heat. Cook the shal­
lots until soft. Add the mushrooms all at once and cook, stirring, until the mushrooms 
are half wilted. Add the herbs and ricotta cheese. Season to taste with salt and pepper. 
Continue cooking until the cheese has melted. Remove from the heat.
	 3	In a medium nonstick sauté pan, heat the remaining 1⁄2 tablespoon olive oil over medium-
high heat. Pour in the egg mixture, and with a rubber spatula, draw the egg mixture 
across the pan in one direction and then in the other. You should have a mound of 
fluffy eggs in the middle of the pan. Let the remaining egg mixture sit and cook for 30 
seconds; then, with the rubber spatula, lift the edges of the omelet, and swirl the sauté 
pan around, to allow the remaining uncooked egg mixture to slide underneath and 
come into contact with the pan. When all the eggs are lightly cooked, remove the pan 
from the heat.
	 4	Cover one half of the open omelet with the mushroom mixture. Then fold over the other 
half of the omelet. Slide the omelet onto a heated serving plate.

T Artichoke Frittata
At Eccolo restaurant in Berkeley, California, Christopher Lee created the fluffiest egg 
frittata you’ll ever have. The best part about it? It tastes great. Plus, it’s low in saturated 
fat, high in protein, and great for your blood sugar. You read right — protein is essential 
for blood sugar control, as you’ve heard before. This recipe provides a great way to 
include it at breakfast without all the fat that comes with many high-protein meats.
Preparation time: 25 minutes
Cooking time: 15 minutes
Yield: 6 servings
5 large whole frozen artichoke hearts, thawed
2 teaspoons extra-virgin olive oil
1⁄2 teaspoon plus a few pinches salt
5 eggs
7 egg whites
1 tablespoon unsalted butter
2 tablespoons finely chopped parsley
2 tablespoons finely chopped thyme
	 1	Slice the artichoke hearts into 1⁄2-inch pieces.
	 2	Heat a sauté pan over high heat. Lightly coat the bottom with the olive oil. When the oil 
begins to shimmer, add the artichoke slices, reduce the heat to medium-low, and sauté 
the artichokes until they’re tender, about 10 minutes, stirring occasionally. Season the 
artichokes with salt as you sauté them. Remove them from the heat.
	 3	Crack the eggs into a medium bowl. Add the egg whites and season them with a few 
pinches of salt. Whisk them until they’re well blended.
	 4	For a large frittata, heat a large nonstick pan over medium-high heat and then add 1⁄2 
tablespoon of butter and allow it to coat the bottom of the pan. Place half of the cooked 
artichoke slices in the pan and sprinkle them with parsley and thyme. Reduce the heat 
to low and pour half of the egg mixture over the artichokes. Quickly stir everything 
together so that the artichokes are evenly distributed. Cook the mixture, without stir­
ring, until the eggs are almost set, approximately 4 minutes, and then flip the frittata 
over and let it cook for another minute or so. Slide out of the pan and onto a serving 
plate.
	 5	Repeat Step 4 to make a second frittata. Cut each frittata into 3 pieces. Serve hot or cold 
with bread.

If your experience with seafood until now has been fish sticks or broiled 
halibut, we’ve got some great ideas for getting you going with seafood appe­
tizers. You can experiment with new flavors without committing yourself to 
a full seafood entree. But be sure to take a look at Chapter 12 for more taste-
tempting seafood recipes.
Most people don’t get enough seafood in their diet. Rich in fish oil, omega-3 
fatty acids, protein, calcium, and so many other nutrients, seafood is an 
excellent part of any well-rounded diet. This delectable food is much lower 
in cholesterol than beef and chicken and has so many varied flavors and tex­
tures that you can’t get bored with it.
Shellfish, such as scallops and shrimp, are sold by weight and size. When you 
see shrimp labeled as “26/30,” you get between 26 and 30 shrimp per pound. 
So the higher the number, the smaller the shrimp, and vice versa. You may 
even see labels that say “U10,” which means “under 10,” or fewer than 10 
shrimp per pound.
	
Always clean your shrimp properly before cooking them. If you buy your 
shrimp in a grocery store, the head will most likely be removed. But the 
shrimp may or may not be deveined, which means the dark “vein” that runs 
down the back of the shrimp’s tail may still be present. Because this veinlike 
object is actually the shrimp’s intestinal track, you should remove it before 
cooking the shrimp. At your grocery or kitchen supply store (anywhere 
kitchen gadgets are sold), pick up a tool called a shrimp deveiner and run it 
along the back end of the shrimp. It cracks the shell and removes the vein in 
one easy step. Then rinse the shrimp in cool water. Check out Figure 7-1 to see 
the deveining process.

tool to clean 
and devein

Shrimp Quesadillas
This recipe puts a nice twist on the classic Mexican dish. Though shellfish is a signifi­
cant source of cholesterol, it’s very low in total and saturated fat — a great alternative 
to high-fat meats. Just be sure to limit cholesterol intake from animal products the rest 
of the day.
Preparation time: 15 minutes
Cooking time: 10 minutes
Yield: 4 servings
1⁄3 cup lowfat sugar-free plain yogurt
2 medium plum tomatoes, seeded and 
chopped
Nonstick cooking spray
4 10-inch whole-wheat tortillas
1 pound canned baby shrimp, cooked
2 teaspoons fresh cilantro, chopped
1 cup (4 ounces) shredded Monterey Jack 
cheese
	 1	In a small bowl, combine the yogurt and tomatoes. Set aside.
	 2	Coat a large skillet with the cooking spray. Place the skillet over medium heat until hot. 
Add one tortilla to the pan. Top the tortilla with half of the shrimp, 1 teaspoon of the 
chopped cilantro, and 1⁄2 cup of cheese. Place a second tortilla on top of the mixture. 
Cook the quesadilla until the cheese begins to melt and the bottom tortilla becomes 
golden brown. Flip the quesadilla over and continue to cook until the cheese is fully 
melted and the tortillas are lightly browned. Remove from skillet and place on a cutting 
board.
	 3	Repeat Step 2 with the remaining tortillas, shrimp, cilantro, and cheese.
	 4	Slice each quesadilla into 6 pieces. Place 3 pieces and one-fourth of the tomato mixture 
on each of 4 plates.

Crab Puffs
Crab puffs are the ideal finger food for parties. For this recipe, use the best quality 
Parmesan cheese you can find — its strong flavor is a terrific complement to the deli­
cate crab and artichoke without adding many calories or much fat. If you’re a fan of 
spicy food, feel free to bump up the horseradish in this recipe for a sinus-clearing 
experience.
Preparation time: 20 minutes
Cooking time: 6 to 7 minutes
Yield: 6 servings (4 pieces each)
3 tablespoons freshly grated Parmesan 
cheese
1 can (14 ounces) artichoke hearts, drained 
and chopped
1⁄2 pound snow crabmeat
1 egg white
1⁄4 cup lowfat sour cream
1⁄4 cup lowfat mayonnaise
1 teaspoon fresh squeezed lemon juice
1 teaspoon prepared horseradish
1⁄2 teaspoon Worcestershire sauce
1 small garlic clove, minced
3 English muffins, halved
	 1	Preheat the broiler.
	 2	In a small bowl, reserve 2 tablespoons of the Parmesan cheese. In a medium bowl, com­
bine the remaining 1 tablespoon Parmesan cheese, the chopped artichokes, crabmeat, 
egg white, sour cream, mayonnaise, lemon juice, horseradish, Worcestershire sauce, 
and garlic.
	 3	Place the English muffin halves on a baking pan and spread the crab mixture equally 
onto each muffin. Sprinkle the reserved Parmesan cheese on top.
	 4	Place the pan in the freezer for 10 minutes, or until the crab mixture holds its form.
	 5	Remove the pan from the freezer and place the pan under the broiler for 6 to 7 minutes, 
or until the muffin topping is lightly browned and bubbly. Cut each muffin into quarters.

Savoring Salsas
We’ve fallen in love with the Mexican condiment, salsa. Most store-bought 
versions, however, have too much sugar and vinegar, so they aren’t nearly 
as good as the homemade variety. Why bother with those versions when it’s 
so easy to create your own? Although salsa simply means “sauce,” we think 
you’ll agree that these salsa recipes taste anything but simple.
Stocking essentials for scrumptious salsas
Add the standard salsa seasonings to any grain or legume for a tasty and 
nutritious treat anytime. You can flavor cooked brown rice, quinoa, or any 
cooked beans with any of these tasty additions:
	
✓	Cilantro
	
✓	Garlic
	
✓	Lime juice or lemon juice
	
✓	Onions
	
✓	Peppers (such as serranos and jalapeños)
	
✓	Tomatoes
Check out the following salsa recipes, which use these delicious ingredients.
	
Use caution when slicing and dicing hot peppers such as jalapeños. Use your 
knife, not your fingers or fingernails, to remove the super-spicy ribs and seeds, 
and consider wearing gloves if you have sensitive skin. The pepper oil can 
get stuck under your nails, making it painful to touch your eyes, nose, or any 
other moist parts later. And if your skin is exposed to sunlight with residual 
pepper oil, you can get a nasty burn.
	
T Mexican Salsa
Chowing down some Mexican salsa is a great way to get a good helping of lycopene, 
because tomatoes happen to be one of the best sources. Lycopene, a great antioxidant 
that helps fight heart disease, has also been shown to help prevent prostate cancer and 
maintain eye health. If you’re a fan of cilantro like we are, toss in a bit more. Serve the 
salsa (shown in the color section) with pitas or tortilla chips.
Preparation time: 10 minutes
Yield: 4 servings

 Chapter 7: Hors d’Oeuvres and First Courses: Off to a Good Start
1⁄2 teaspoon lemon juice
1⁄2 teaspoon salt
1 pound fresh tomatoes, cored and chopped
1⁄2 medium onion, diced
1 tablespoon fresh chopped jalapeño pepper
1 small garlic clove, chopped fine
1 teaspoon fresh chopped cilantro
	 1	In a mixing bowl, combine the lemon juice and salt. Stir to dissolve the salt.
	 2	Add the tomatoes and coat them with the juice. Add the onion, jalapeño, garlic, and 
cilantro and stir.
Tip: If you like a smooth rather than chunky salsa, toss all the ingredients in a food proces­
sor and process the mixture in pulses until it reaches the consistency you desire.

Adding citrus and other fruits to salsas
To give your salsa a fruity twist, don’t bother with bottled lemon or lime 
juice. Fresh is definitely the way to go. Squeezing the juice out is easy to do, 
and the flavor is far superior.
Here’s how to get the most out of your citrus fruit. Check out Figure 7-3 for 
details.
	
1.	Roll the fruit on a hard, flat surface, pressing down fairly hard to 
break up the juice sacs.
	
2.	Cut the citrus fruit in half width-wise.
	
3.	Holding one half in one hand, stick the tines of a fork into the fruit 
pulp and squeeze the fruit.
	
	 Twist the fork as needed to release as much juice as possible.
	
Juice your fruit over a separate bowl, not into other ingredients. Doing so 
helps you catch any errant seeds that may try to sneak their way into your 
delectable dishes.
Lemon and lime aren’t the only fruity flavors you can add to your salsas. 
Check out the following yummy salsas featuring mango and pineapple.

T Mango Salsa
This mango salsa recipe is similar to the familiar Mexican salsa (see the recipe earlier in 
this chapter) but it offers sweet, firm mango as a perfect partner to the peppers. Feel 
free to add less mango or more tomato as you experiment with this versatile recipe. 
With these great ingredients, it’s hard to go wrong! Check out a photo of the salsa in the 
color section.
Preparation time: 15 minutes
Yield: 4 servings
1 large ripe mango, peeled, pitted, and 
chopped
1⁄2 small red pepper, seeded and chopped
1 medium tomato, seeded and cubed
1 green onion, green and white parts, chopped
2 tablespoons minced fresh ginger
Juice of 1 lime
3 tablespoons fresh chopped cilantro
	
	In a mixing bowl, combine all the ingredients and mix well. Cover and refrigerate until 
ready to serve.

T Warm Pineapple Salsa
Fruit salsa can be a terrific sauce for fish, veggies, or pita wedges. Or use it like a jam or 
syrup to top biscuits, waffles, or pancakes. With cooked fruit salsa, you heat the ingre­
dients until they almost become a glaze. Fruit salsa has a more syrupy consistency than 
a tomato-based salsa. Experiment and enjoy.
Preparation time: 20 minutes
Cooking time: 15 minutes
Yield: 4 servings
1 tablespoon olive oil
1 tablespoon slivered almonds
1 small onion, thinly sliced
2 teaspoons curry powder
16 ounces pineapple tidbits, drained
1 tablespoon cider vinegar
1⁄4 teaspoon salt
1 tablespoon honey
1 tablespoon brown seedless raisins
	 1	In a small saucepan, heat the oil over medium heat. Add the almonds and gently toss in 
the oil.
	 2	Add the onion and cook until tender and until the almonds are golden brown.
	 3	Add the curry powder, pineapple, vinegar, salt, honey, and raisins. Bring the mixture to 
a boil, reduce the heat, and simmer for 10 minutes. Remove the salsa from the heat and 
serve warm.
Vary It! Try this recipe with canned mandarin oranges, apricots, or peaches instead of the 
pineapple, depending on your accompaniments and your taste buds on a given day. But be 
sure to avoid fruit packed in heavy syrup.

Discovering Delicious Dips
Dips don’t have to be fat-laden creamy concoctions that add inches to your 
waistline and bags to your saddle. With a little creativity, you can create deli­
cious dips that keep you eating healthy and your glucose levels normal.

Whipping up dips with pantry staples
	
Dips are among the quickest and easiest (not to mention tastiest!) appetizers 
around. Keep your pantry and fridge stocked with a few dip-making essentials 
and you’ll never be stuck wondering what to whip up when unexpected guests 
stop by.
Here are our best bets for quick dip-making essentials to keep on hand:
	
✓	Any of the ingredients listed under “Stocking essentials for scrump­
tious salsas,” earlier in this chapter: Adding any of the salsa ingredients 
to any of the items in this list makes for a terrific dip. In fact, one of our 
favorite quick dips blends a can of black beans (rinsed and drained, of 
course) with 1⁄2 cup of salsa. Whip the mixture in a food processor, and 
you have an instant party treat.
	
✓	Beans: Pureed beans make a great base for a dip, and they’re high in 
fiber and low in fat. Blend them in a food processor and season them 
with your favorite spices. Look for fat-free, low-sodium canned beans, 
and try cannellini beans, black beans, pinto beans, black-eyed peas, gar­
banzo beans, great Northern beans, navy beans, and kidney beans.
	
	Unless a recipe says otherwise, rinse and drain canned beans before 
adding them to a dip. Often, the liquid they’re canned in is salty or fla­
vored in some way. Rinse and drain and season them your way.
	
✓	Fancy olives: Olives impart great flavor and texture to dips. Use some of 
the olive juice to blend into the dip, too. If olives perk up a martini, just 
think what they can do for some ho-hum dips!
	
✓	Fresh herbs: Fresh herbs make an instant impression on an otherwise 
bland dip base. Dill, basil, and cilantro are excellent choices for keeping 
on hand.
	
✓	Lowfat sour cream: Use sour cream to add a little body and creamy tex­
ture to your dips.
	
✓	Plain yogurt: This staple is a natural partner to fresh herbs and a touch 
of lemon juice. Keep it handy to mix in a soon-to-be bean dip.
	
✓	Spice blends: Look for prepackaged, salt-free spice blends. These 
healthy spices can take the guesswork out of seasoning.
	
T White Bean Dip
Here’s a great dip that takes advantage of a well-stocked pantry. Add fresh baby spin­
ach leaves during Step 1 to boost your vitamins and leafy greens quotient. Delicious!

101

T Cacit (Cucumber Dip) 
Tante Marie’s cooking school developed this all-purpose dip. It’s similar to a Greek 
Tzatziki sauce that’s often served with gyro sandwiches. It’s simple to make, but make 
sure to leave enough time for the cucumbers to thoroughly drain. 
Preparation time: 10 minutes plus 2 hours standing time
Yield: 4 servings
1 English cucumber (or 4 small)
2 garlic cloves
1⁄2 teaspoon coarse salt
2 tablespoons minced fresh mint
1 cup nonfat Greek-style yogurt
	 1	Cut the cucumber into 1-inch dices. Place the cucumber in a stainless steel colander, and 
sprinkle with salt. Let the cucumbers drain for 1 to 2 hours, to remove excess liquid.
	 2	On a cutting board, make a paste of the garlic with the salt. Place garlic mixture in a 
bowl. Add the cucumbers, mint, and yogurt. Mix well and add salt to taste.

Tuna Pâté
This pâté is tasty and much lighter than the typical liver-and-oil-based spread that 
many people are familiar with. Using a food processor makes for quick prep work. Feel 
free to add more or fewer jalapeños, depending on your taste. Serve this dip with pita 
or bagel chips or spread it in celery ribs.
Preparation time: 10 minutes, plus 3 to 4 hours of chilling time
Yield: 6 servings
1⁄4 small onion
2 teaspoons fresh cilantro
1 tablespoon chopped jalapeño pepper
12 ounces canned tuna, packed in water, 
drained
1⁄2 cup mayonnaise
1⁄8 teaspoon white pepper
	 1	In a food processor, combine the onion, cilantro, and jalapeño and pulse until chopped, 
approximately 1 minute.
	 2	Add the tuna and process approximately 1 minute.
	 3	Slowly add the mayonnaise and process until smooth, approximately 30 seconds.
	 4	Add the pepper and process 1 minute. Check for lumps and process until smooth. 
Transfer the dip to a serving bowl, chill it for 3 to 4 hours, and serve.

T Truffled Hummus 
What could be better than a good hummus? It’s a classic, and it makes an easy party 
food. Making it yourself is only slightly more difficult than opening that plastic con­
tainer, yet the result yields a freshness of flavor and a creamy texture that can’t be beat. 
The use of white truffle oil lends itself well to the earthiness of the ground chickpeas. 
For another take on hummus, make sure to make a stop in Chapter 10 and try the recipe 
for Southwestern Hummus. 
Preparation time: 10 minutes
Yield: 6 servings

103
 Chapter 7: Hors d’Oeuvres and First Courses: Off to a Good Start
1 15-ounce can chick peas (drained and 
rinsed)
1 clove garlic
1⁄4 cup water
1 tablespoon lemon juice
1 tablespoon olive oil
1⁄4 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon pepper (preferably freshly ground)
1 teaspoon fresh thyme leaves
1 dash ground cumin
1 teaspoon quality truffle oil (or more as 
desired)
Dash paprika or chili powder (optional)
1 tablespoon fresh parsley, chopped (optional)
	 1	Blend all ingredients (except paprika and parsley if using) in a food processor until 
smooth and creamy.
	 2	Place mixture in serving dish. Garnish with a sprinkle of paprika and parsley if desired. 
Tip: Alternately you could blend the ingredients in Step 1, but omit the truffle oil. Then in 
Step 2 garnish by drizzling the truffle oil on top. This version creates more of a layered 
taste.

Choosing healthy dippers
	
What’s a good dip without something to dip into it? Rather than ruining all 
your hard work of choosing healthy dips by dipping fried chips into them, we 
offer you the following alternatives to keep you moving in the right direction:
	
✓	Bagel chips: Look for these chips in the specialty bread section of 
your grocery store, but read the label because some are high in fat and 
sodium. You also can make your own by slicing off slivers of a bagel and 
then baking them until they’re crisp.
	
✓	Fresh veggies: Choose broccoli florets, cauliflower florets, carrot sticks, 
celery sticks, zucchini slices, red pepper spears, endive scoops, or any 
of your favorites. Any veggie can be a dip delivery system.
	
✓	Pita wedges: Make your own by quartering pitas and then baking them 
until they’re crisp.
	
✓	Whole-wheat crackers: Kashi makes a line called TLC, Tasty Little 
Crackers, made with whole-grain flour from seven different grains. 
Ry-Krisp is a filling and tasty choice as well.
	
✓	Yucca chips: This root vegetable has great health benefits. Check out 
the following recipe.

T Yucca Chips
Yucca is a root vegetable very similar to the potato. It has lots of good fiber and can 
be substituted for potatoes in soups and stews. Enjoy these chips as a healthy snack 
instead of potato chips.
Preparation time: 10 minutes
Cooking time: 45 minutes
Yield: 4 servings
1⁄8 teaspoon salt
1⁄8 teaspoon pepper
2 large yucca, peeled and cut into wedges
2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil
Nonstick cooking spray
	 1	Preheat the oven to 375 degrees.
	 2	In a small bowl, combine the salt and pepper. In a large bowl, coat the yucca wedges 
with the olive oil and then toss them with the salt and pepper.
	 3	Coat a baking sheet with cooking spray and arrange the wedges on the sheet. Bake 
about 45 minutes, or until the yucca wedges are cooked through and lightly browned.

oups might be the ultimate comfort food. 
Who doesn’t feel better (even with a cold) 
with a bowl of warm chicken soup? And you can 
choose a soup for every occasion. No matter what 
the weather, the state of your health, or who’s 
coming for dinner, we have a soup for you.
In this chapter, we get you started with the basics 
of making soup, taking you through the steps to 
make sure your soups turn out just right. We give 
you the scoop on different types of stocks, pro­
vide tips on watching your salt intake, and help 
you get your pantry stocked for soup making. We give you tips on making 
healthful, creamy soups full of flavor, but low in fat. And finally, we help you 
make delicious soups to serve cold on warm summer days.
Understanding Soup-Making Basics
In many soup recipes, the first few steps ask you to sauté some vegetables to 
bring out their flavor and soften them. Typically, you start by cooking a com­
bination of vegetables, such as onions, carrots, and celery, along with herbs 
and spices, in a small amount of fat.
You may sauté your veggies in a small amount of lowfat cooking spray oil or 
butter, or even a bit of fatty smoked meat such as bacon. You may also brown 
ground meats or cubed meats at this stage. As the ingredients cook, they begin 
to turn brown and caramelize, developing a rich and complex flavor.

Next, you add liquid, perhaps some vegetable broth, chicken or beef broth, 
milk, wine, or water. First, add just a half-cup or so of liquid to deglaze the 
pot. During this procedure, you can use a wooden spoon and gently dislodge 
any bits of caramelized vegetables stuck to the bottom of the pot. You want 
these flavorful morsels to blend in with the other flavors of the soup. Pour in 
the remaining liquid.
In the final, and longest, steps of cooking, you place all vegetable chunks, 
beans, grains, or meats, in the simmering liquid and cook to perfection. But 
not everything cooks at the same rate, so use Table 8-1 to help you decide 
when to add ingredients.

T Heirloom Tomato Soup 
	
with Fresh Basil 
Here is Tante Marie Cooking School’s recommendation for making the most of the 
summer tomato bounty. The recipe was originally inspired by their friend, T. T. They’ve 
modified it a bit, to create this incredibly quick and fresh-tasting summer staple. 
Preparation time: 20 minutes
Cooking time: 30 minutes
Yield: 4 servings
	 1	Heat olive oil in a heavy bottomed skillet over medium heat. Stir in the garlic and let 
cook gently until it turns slightly golden — be careful not to let the garlic burn. 
	 2	Immediately stir in the tomatoes and gently sauté until slightly thickened, about 5 min­
utes. Stir in the stock and let simmer another 10 to 15 minutes. Stir in the basil and let 
the soup simmer gently 2 or 3 minutes more. 
	 3	Serve soup in warmed bowls. Top with Parmesan cheese.
Note: The best way to peel and seed tomatoes is to blanch and shock them, as shown in 
Figure 11-1 in Chapter 11, to loosen the skin. Start by removing the stem end of the tomato 
with a small knife. Make an “x” in the opposite end of the tomato with the knife. Drop the 
tomatoes in gently boiling water for no longer than 10 seconds. Immediately transfer them to 
a bowl of cold water. Then gently peel off the loosened skins. To seed them, cut the tomatoes 
in half with the stem end on one side. Over fine mesh strainer fitted onto a bowl or measur­
ing cup, use one hand to scoop out the seeds, while squeezing the tomato half with the other. 
Don’t worry if you don’t get out all the seeds. A couple of seeds won’t hurt anyone. 
Note: T. T. prefers to cook the tomatoes longer than this recipe suggests. She cooks them with 
the garlic for 15 minutes; then she adds 3 quarts of stock and simmers the soup another 30 min­
utes. She says it gives it more flavor. You can try it both ways and choose your favorite.

Summer Vegetable 
	
Stew with Egg
This summer stew boasts a striking presentation — the delicate broth with chunky vege­
tables topped with a fried egg. Tante Marie’s Cooking School worked to develop this 
nutritional powerhouse that has a good balance of protein and carbohydrates. If you’re 
keeping your veggie drawer well-stocked, you may even have all the ingredients on hand. 
Preparation time: 20 minutes
Cooking time: 30 minutes
Yield: 6 servings
3 tablespoons olive oil
2 teaspoons coarse salt, divided
11⁄2  teaspoons ground pepper, divided
2 large onions, halved and sliced
2 large red peppers, cored, seeded, and cut 
into thin strips
2 large or 6 small eggplants, trimmed and cut 
in 1-inch pieces
2 large or 6 small green zucchini, trimmed and 
cut in rounds
12 tomatoes, coarsely chopped
A dash of Tabasco sauce
6 fresh eggs
	 1	Heat olive oil, 1⁄2 teaspoon salt, and the onions in a 10-inch sauté pan over moderately 
high heat. Cook, stirring from time to time, for about 3 minutes; then stir in the peppers. 
Continue cooking for another 3 minutes. 
	 2	Toss in the eggplant, season with 1⁄2 teaspoon salt and 1⁄2 teaspoon pepper, and sauté 
over moderately high heat for about 3 minutes. Stir in the zucchini with another 1⁄2 tea­
spoon salt and 1⁄2 teaspoon pepper and continue cooking over moderately high heat. 
	 3	Stir in the tomatoes. Add another sprinkling of salt and pepper, and add the Tabasco. 
Let the mixture cook, stirring from time to time, until the tomatoes begin to fall apart. 
	 4	Meanwhile, put a light coating of olive oil in a separate non-stick pan over moderately 
high heat. When the pan is hot, remove it from the heat, and break the eggs into it, one 
at a time. Let the eggs cook from the heat of the pan, returning the pan to the heat 
briefly, and taking it off again, until the whites are set. (The eggs will look like fried eggs, 
but will not be brown or rubbery on the bottom.) Taste the stew; add additional salt 
and pepper if necessary. Spoon it into warmed wide bowls, cover each with a pan-fried 
egg, and serve.

 Chapter 8: Soup, Beautiful Soup
Serving Up Soups with Stocks 
and Other Essentials
You can begin a soup using water, but making a soup with real depth of flavor 
calls for stock. Basically, a stock is a liquid in which solid ingredients, such as 
chicken meat and bones, vegetables, and spices, are cooked and then usually 
strained out. The flavors of these ingredients end up in the final broth.
	
Look for stock bases, the secret ingredient of many a restaurant, near the 
bouillon and broth in your grocery store. Usually sold in one-pound contain­
ers, you can make up to five gallons of stock from a single container. Keeping a 
container of base in the fridge is more convenient than keeping five gallons of 
canned broth in your pantry.
Watching out for salt in stock-based soups
Most markets carry various brands of chicken and beef broth that offer good 
flavor. These products are adequate for making everyday soups and are well 
worth keeping on hand. Always choose the low-sodium versions to use as 
stock and then add more salt to your soup as necessary.
If your physician or dietitian has given you any instructions at all about 
watching your salt, you’ve probably been told about the high sodium content 
of canned soup. You may be on a standard 3,000-milligrams-a-day regimen,

For another low-salt stock alternative, you can make a basic vegetable stock 
by simmering together aromatic vegetables like onion and celery with car­
rots, which add sweetness, plus some parsley and a bay leaf. You need to 
cook this mixture for only about 20 minutes.
	
The classical combination of vegetables (onions, celery, and carrots) is called 
mirepoix (pronounced meer-pwa). It’s a basic beginning for many soups and 
stocks. When you’re chopping mirepoix for stocks, you can roughly chop the 
vegetables and even skip the peeling if you prefer. But when getting the veg­
gies ready for soups, take the time to prep them as the recipe suggests.
	
Add strong-flavored vegetables, like broccoli, cauliflower, and asparagus, with 
caution, or they’ll overpower the other ingredients. Instead, make a basic 
stock and add strong-flavored vegetables as you need them for a certain soup.
The Potato-Leek Soup recipe takes advantage of low-sodium chicken broth as 
stock but is still full of great flavor.
Keeping soup supplies in your pantry
Different types of stocks aren’t the only items you need to have close by 
when you’re craving soup. Keep the following ingredients in your pantry for 
an impromptu soup-making session:
	
✓	Canned evaporated milk: Use this item in your creamy soup reci­
pes, such as the Creamy Veggie Lover’s Soup later in this chapter. 
Evaporated milk is not the same as sweetened condensed milk (a syrupy 
milk-based concoction with lots of sugar added). Evaporated milk is milk 
from which 60 percent of the water has been removed. It’s concentrated, 
so it can enhance the flavor of soups and other dishes.

111
 Chapter 8: Soup, Beautiful Soup
	
	Choose regular evaporated milk rather than evaporated skim milk for 
soups and sauces. Evaporated skim milk has a tendency to curdle and 
break when heated. If you still want to save the calories, purée the soup 
with the skim milk before serving.
	
✓	Canned legumes, like beans, lentils, and chickpeas: They’re a great 
source of fiber and protein, but the dried variety can take some time to 
prepare. So have the canned variety available to toss in a soup pot in a 
pinch. Get started using these hearty staples in the Indian-Inspired Lamb 
and Legume Chili later in this chapter.
	
	Always drain and rinse canned beans and vegetables unless the recipe 
specifies otherwise. This step removes excess sodium, allowing you to 
season your soup to your preferred taste.
	
✓	Canned tomatoes: Diced, crushed, whole, or stewed, any of these toma­
toes products can make for a quick soup.
	
✓	Dried herbs and spices. Oregano, basil, pepper, salt, dill, and just about 
anything in your spice cabinet can work into a soup recipe.
	
✓	Dried mushrooms: Rehydrate them in hot water, steep them for about 
30 minutes, and then strain the liquid to remove any grit. Roughly chop 
the mushrooms and add the strained liquid for an extra punch of flavor.
	
✓	Garlic: Garlic adds an amazing flavor to just about anything. You can 
roast it, sauté it, and purée it; whatever works for your soup. It’s great in 
creamy soups, tomato-based soups, or brothy soups. (Not intended for 
any visiting vampires eating soup, and don’t forget the breath mints.)
	
✓	Grains: Rice, pasta, and barley are great choices to make a soup heart­
ier. Check out Chapter 10 for the full story on cooking with grains.
	
✓	Olive oil: This terrific monounsaturated fat can help make an already 
nutritious soup heart healthy, too. Keep some on hand at all times.
	
✓	Onions: These fragrant bulbs add their terrific flavor and aroma to any­
thing you cook.
	
✓	Potatoes: These starchy veggies cook up quickly and can add body to 
your soups. Choose them for puréed soups as they help thicken soups 
almost instantly, like in the Potato-Leek Soup earlier in this chapter.
	
✓	Salt-free seasoning mixes: If you have trouble with high blood pressure, 
you probably need to steer clear of salt as much as possible. Salt-free 
seasoning blends can give you many delicious flavor combinations and 
take the guesswork out of seasoning your soups.

Potato-Leek Soup
This soup is great basic comfort food. Leeks (which look sort of like overgrown green 
onions) must be sliced and then soaked and washed thoroughly to remove dirt and 
sand deep down in the bulb. Check out Figure 8-1 to see how to cut up a leek. Swish 
sliced leeks around in a bowl of cold water. Soak them for a few minutes until the dirt 
and grit settle to the bottom of the bowl. Lift the leeks out of the water and drain on a 
paper towel. Repeat the procedure again with fresh water.
Preparation time: 20 minutes
Cooking time: 25 minutes
Yield: 4 servings
Nonstick cooking spray
1 large leek, chopped and rinsed (don’t use 
the dark green part of leek)
2 cups potatoes, peeled and cut into 1⁄4-inch 
cubes
2 cups low-sodium chicken broth
1⁄4 teaspoon pepper
1⁄8 teaspoon salt
	 1	Coat a large pot with cooking spray and place over medium heat until hot. Add the 
leeks. Sauté until soft and translucent.
	 2	Add the potatoes and chicken broth. Bring to a boil and simmer for 10 to 15 minutes, 
until the potatoes are cooked. Add the pepper and salt. Continue to simmer for 2 min­
utes. Remove from the heat.
	 3	Place half of contents of the pot into a blender, cover, and process until smooth.
	 4	Carefully pour the blender mixture back into the pot with the remaining broth and pota­
toes. Stir together with a wire whisk. Bring back to a simmer.

 Chapter 8: Soup, Beautiful Soup
The U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Dietary Guidelines for Americans 
suggest at least five servings of fruits and vegetables every day to ensure 
adequate intake of vitamins, minerals, and fiber. Enjoying a bowl of vegetable 
soup such as the following recipe is a delicious way to meet your quota.
	
Classic: Hearty Vegetable Soup
When you prepare vegetable soup, first add the items that require longer cooking (such 
as beets and carrots) and later add quick-cooking ingredients (such as spinach and 
tomatoes). You’ll have all your vegetables just where you want them, done to perfection 
when your soup is finished. However, this procedure does require your time and atten­
tion. Another way to make sure that all the vegetables finish cooking about the same 
time is to cut the longer-cooking ones (such as potatoes) into smaller pieces and the 
faster-cooking types (such as squash) into larger chunks.
Preparation time: 15 minutes
Cooking time: 30 minutes
Yield: 4 servings
Nonstick cooking spray
1⁄2 cup diced onions
1⁄2 cup diced celery
1⁄2 cup diced carrots
1 cup diced fresh yucca
1⁄2 cup diced fresh tomatoes
1⁄2 cup diced zucchini
1 bay leaf
1⁄8 teaspoon thyme
1⁄2 teaspoon oregano
2 cups low-sodium chicken 
broth
1⁄8 teaspoon white pepper
	 1	Choose a large pot with a tightly fitting lid. Coat the pot with the nonstick spray and cook, 
stirring constantly, the onions, celery, and carrots until the onions are translucent — 
about 5 to 7 minutes. You can spray the pot with additional cooking spray or add a little 
stock or water if the vegetables begin to stick or burn. Add the yucca, tomatoes, zucchini, 
bay leaf, thyme, oregano, chicken broth, and white pepper and stir to combine.
	 2	Bring the vegetable soup to a boil over high heat, uncovered, and then simmer, cov­
ered, for 20 minutes.
	 3	Remove the bay leaf and serve immediately as a light lunch or mini meal.
Note: Adding salt is optional, but it does increase the sodium level.

Part II: Healthy Recipes That Taste Great 
Modifying classic favorites 
with an international kick
Soups are part of every cuisine. And virtually any soup can get a little ethnic 
flavor by changing the spices and seasonings (all of which are found in most 
kitchens). In the next recipe, the garam masala, a traditional Indian spice 
blend, gives this chili a taste of India. You can find this tasty spice blend in 
the spice section of most grocery stores now. If you want to change the fla­
vors to match another culture’s cuisine, change the seasonings.
	
Try these few ideas to substitute for the garam masala, changing the flavor, 
but keeping the basic recipe.
	
✓	Chinese five-spice powder, ground ginger, and a touch of sesame oil 
stirred in at the end of cooking, for a Chinese-inspired chili
	
✓	Chili powder and cayenne, for a traditional southwestern chili
	
✓	Cinnamon, for a Cincinnati-style chili
	
✓	Basil, marjoram, oregano, thyme, and rosemary, for a taste of Italy
	
✓	Thyme, cinnamon, ginger, allspice, cloves, garlic, and onions, for a little 
Jamaican jerk flavor
	
✓	Cumin, coriander seed, and cloves, for a taste of North Africa
	
Indian-Inspired Lamb 
	
and Legume Chili
This recipe, from food writer Heather Dismore, is an easy one-pot meal that’s full of 
good nutritional benefits. The beans are a wonderful source of dietary fiber, and in this 
recipe, they meet about a third of your daily fiber needs. Increased fiber can help with 
blood sugar control as well as enhance satiety, keeping you fuller for longer. Lamb is a 
good source of iron and vitamin B12, which can both help prevent and improve anemia. 
Lamb tends to be a high-fat meat, however, so be sure to drain the fat during the cook­
ing process.
Preparation time: 10 minutes
Cooking time: 21⁄2 hours (largely unattended)
Yield: 8 servings

115
 Chapter 8: Soup, Beautiful Soup
	 1	Combine the lamb, onion, and garlic in a large stockpot. Cook over medium heat until 
the lamb is browned and crumbled, about 5 minutes. Stir as needed. Drain in a colander 
to remove excess fat. Return drained meat mixture to the stockpot.
	 2	Stir in the tomatoes, wine, chili powder, coriander, garam masala, and chiles. Bring to a 
boil. Cover, reduce heat, and cook 2 hours, stirring occasionally.
	 3	Stir in the black beans, lentils, and chickpeas. Simmer an additional 30 minutes. Serve 
immediately.

Creating Creamy Concoctions
Who doesn’t love a delicious creamy soup? But as you probably know, put­
ting cream in soups adds calories and saturated fat, neither of which are very 
good for a diabetic diet. If you can’t get enough of creamy soups, we have 
some good news. You can have a great creamy texture — without the stuff 
you don’t need.
	
One great way to get the creamy texture without the bad stuff is to substitute 
2 percent milk for cream in your favorite soups. It gives you plenty of the 
creaminess and mouth feel you expect because it does have some fat and 
body, but it cuts the fat grams and calories. Try this great alternative in the 
following soup recipe.
11⁄2 pounds lean ground lamb
1 cup chopped red onion
3 garlic cloves, minced
2 cans (141⁄2 ounces each) no-salt-added diced 
tomatoes, undrained
1 cup dry red wine
1 tablespoon chili powder
11⁄2 teaspoons ground coriander
11⁄2 teaspoons garam masala
1⁄4 cup serrano chiles, seeded and minced 
(about 2 chiles)
1 can (15 ounces) black beans, drained and 
rinsed
1 can (15 ounces) lentils, drained and rinsed
1 can (15 ounces) chickpeas, drained and 
rinsed

T Cauliflower-Parmesan Soup
This recipe comes from Rathbun’s in Atlanta (see Appendix A). This soup is warm, 
hearty, and perfect for a cool day. We substitute 2 percent milk, which has just enough 
fat to prevent curdling, in place of cream. The 2 percent milk has reduced this soup’s fat 
content by nearly 50 percent. Remember to always try to use a lowfat version of dairy 
products.
This dish is reminiscent of a creamy potato soup, with far fewer calories and starch. 
Cauliflower, a cruciferous vegetable high in vitamin C and fiber, can be a great substi­
tute for potatoes in many traditional recipes. Try using cauliflower next time you are 
about to whip up a batch of mashed potatoes. You may be pleasantly surprised not 
only with the taste but also with the modest effect this dish has on your blood sugar.
Preparation time: 15 minutes
Cooking time: 40 to 45 minutes
Yield: 4 servings
1 head cauliflower cut into chunks
2 shallots, chopped
3 cups 2 percent milk
1⁄2 cup grated Parmesan cheese
2 tablespoons lemon juice
2 tablespoons honey
1⁄2 teaspoon kosher salt
1⁄2 tablespoon pepper
	 1	In a large pot, place the cauliflower, shallots, and milk and bring to a boil. Reduce heat 
to a simmer until the cauliflower is tender, about 35 minutes.
	 2	Transfer to a blender and purée until smooth (always be extra careful when blending 
hot liquids), or use a rotary beater to achieve a smooth consistency. While the soup is 
blending, add the cheese and process until smooth. Finish by adding the lemon juice, 
honey, salt, and pepper.

T Creamy Veggie Lover’s Soup
How could you go wrong with veggies? Heather Dismore contributes this soup full of 
nutritional benefits. And it’s super tasty too. One serving provides more than 100 per­
cent of your daily vitamin C needs, more than half of your vitamin A needs, and more 
than 25 percent of your potassium, calcium, and vitamin D needs — also great for bone 
health! It’s also a tremendous source of beta carotene and lycopene. Enjoy this dish by 
itself — the calorie, carbohydrate, protein, and fat contents are just enough for a light 
meal.
Preparation time: 20 minutes
Cooking time: 30 minutes
Yield: 4 servings
2 tablespoons olive oil
1⁄3 cup minced onion
1⁄3 cup thinly sliced carrots
1⁄3 cup thinly sliced celery
2 teaspoons minced garlic
3 cups sliced fresh mushrooms
1 cup diced red pepper
1 teaspoon ground sage
1⁄4 teaspoon ground thyme
1⁄4 teaspoon pepper
2 cans (about 14 ounces each) fat-free 
reduced-sodium beef broth
1 can (6 ounces) tomato paste
1 cup evaporated skim milk
2 cups cooked mini penne pasta
1⁄4 cup Parmesan cheese (optional)
2 tablespoons minced fresh parsley (optional)
	 1	Heat the oil in a large saucepan over medium heat until hot. Add the onions, carrots, 
celery, and garlic. Cook 3 to 4 minutes, until the vegetables begin to “sweat,” or begin to 
give off a bit of liquid.
	 2	Add the mushrooms, red pepper, sage, thyme, and pepper. Cook and stir for 5 minutes 
or until the vegetables are crisp yet tender.
	 3	Add the beef broth and tomato paste; bring to a boil over medium-high heat. Cook 15 
minutes.

119
 Chapter 8: Soup, Beautiful Soup
	 4	Place half the soup in container of a food processor and purée (always use caution 
when processing hot liquids). With the food processor running, slowly pour in the evap­
orated skim milk.
	 5	Return the soup-milk mixture to the soup pot. Stir to combine. Add the cooked pasta 
and heat through. Serve immediately with the Parmesan cheese and parsley, if desired.

Choosing Chilled Soups
Chilled soups are great appetizers, light lunches, or even desserts. You can 
choose any taste (sweet, spicy, savory) or ethnic flavor profile (Latin, Polish, 
French, you name it), and there’s probably a chilled soup to match. Because 
you serve them cold, they’re great to serve all summer long.
	
Don’t feel like you need to wait for a special occasion to serve these chilled 
soups. They’re so easy that you can serve them any time.
Cooling off with veggies
Get started with chilled soups by trying this easy Chilled Cucumber Soup. 
Spice it up as you see fit. Substitute fresh mint or cilantro for the dill to 
change the flavor.

T Classic: Chilled Cucumber Soup
Make cucumber soup even more refreshing by adding naturally tart yogurt. Yogurt, plus 
the nonfat sour cream in this recipe, makes this soup a substantial and satisfying 
starter course for lunch or dinner. Or add a punch of lemon zest to create a tangy 
palate cleanser between courses.
Preparation time: 20 minutes
Cooking time: 15 minutes
Yield: 4 servings
Nonstick cooking spray
1 large or 2 small cucumbers, peeled, seeded, 
and cut into 1⁄4-inch slices (2 cups)
2 shallots, minced
1⁄4 cup white wine
2 cups low-sodium chicken broth
1⁄4 teaspoon pepper
1⁄8 teaspoon salt
1⁄2 cup nonfat sour cream
1⁄2 cup plain nonfat yogurt
4 fresh dill weed sprigs
	 1	Coat a large skillet with the cooking spray and place over medium heat until hot. Sauté 
the cucumber and shallots, tossing or stirring frequently until soft and translucent 
(about 5 minutes).
	 2	Stir in the wine and chicken broth. Bring to a boil and simmer for 10 minutes. Add the 
pepper and salt. Continue to simmer for 2 minutes. Remove from heat.
	 3	Place the contents of the skillet in an electric blender or a food processor, cover, and 
process until smooth.
	 4	Pour the mixture into a bowl. Let cool slightly. With a wire whisk, stir in the sour cream 
and yogurt. Cover and chill. Garnish with the dill weed sprigs.

Focusing on fruit
Fruit soups are among the most popular chilled soups, probably because 
people often eat fruit cold. So puréeing it first and then eating it isn’t a 
stretch. Fruit soup recipes aren’t always that simple, but they’re not much 
tougher. Try cooking fruit soups with that classic blend of strawberries and 
rhubarb in this next recipe. Watermelon is the star of the other recipe in this 
section.

T Rhubarb Soup with 
	
Fresh Strawberries
When most people think of rhubarb, not much comes to mind, except for rhubarb pie — 
and for most people, even that thought rarely occurs! Chef Didier Labbe from the 
Clementine restaurant in San Francisco (see Appendix A) has offered a chilled rhubarb 
soup recipe for your cooking pleasure. (See the soup in the color section.) This one is a 
keeper — not only because it’s delicious, interesting, and different, but also because it 
packs in more than 100 percent of the recommended daily allowance of vitamin C in just 
one serving! The original recipe calls for sugar to sweeten things up, but we substitute 
Splenda, and you’d never know the difference.
Preparation time: 15 minutes
Cooking time: 20 minutes
Yield: 2 servings
1 pound rhubarb, peeled and cut into 1⁄2-inch-
thick slices
1⁄4 cup Splenda
1 pound strawberries, cleaned and sliced
1 cup water
Juice of 1⁄2 lemon
6 mint leaves, julienned
	 1	In a large mixing bowl, combine the rhubarb and Splenda and mix well. Set the bowl 
aside.
	 2	In a saucepan, combine the strawberries, water, and lemon juice. Cover and boil for 5 to 
6 minutes. Using a colander, strain the strawberries to obtain just the juice. Discard the 
pulp.
	 3	Pour the strawberry juice back into the saucepan and add the rhubarb-and-Splenda 
mixture. Boil for 10 to 15 minutes. Remove the pan from heat and store the soup in the 
refrigerator until it’s cold. Serve the soup chilled with the mint leaves as a garnish.
Tip: Because rhubarb is seasonal, you may need to use the frozen kind, which already 
comes in pieces.

T Watermelon Gazpacho
Kyle Ketchum, from Lark in Detroit, Michigan (see Appendix A), delights with this warm 
weather treat. Just when the dog days of summer really start getting to you, try this 
refreshing gazpacho. (Gazpacho is a fancy word for a cold, uncooked soup.) This one 
takes advantage of the watermelon, one of the season’s most popular fruits and a sur­
prising twist on the usual summertime snack. Not only is this soup cool and invigorat­
ing, but it’s also full of good nutrition. Watermelons are a great source of the 
antioxidants lycopene, beta carotene, and vitamin C, as well as vitamin A. This soup is 
quite low in calories, a good thing for your waistline. But before you go for a second 
scoop, remember that fruit has sugar and should be eaten in moderate amounts.
Preparation time: 45 minutes, plus 1 hour of chilling time
Yield: 4 servings
1 cup thinly sliced cucumbers
1⁄4 teaspoon kosher salt
6 cups cubed and seeded watermelon (from 
about a 3-pound seedless watermelon)
1⁄2 cup cranberry juice
1⁄2 cup small diced red bell pepper
1⁄2 cup small diced red onion
1⁄2 cup small diced celery
1⁄4 cup finely chopped parsley
1 tablespoon sherry vinegar
2 tablespoons lime juice
8 each fresh mint leaves, chiffonade (see 
Chapter 9 for an explanation of chiffonade)
	 1	In a small bowl, toss the cucumbers with the salt.
	 2	In a blender, add the watermelon and cranberry juice. Pulse until just blended. 
(Overblending causes the watermelon to froth and lose its color.) Pour through a sieve 
into a bowl and press on the pulp to extract all the juice. Discard the pulp.
	 3	Add the bell pepper, onion, celery, parsley, vinegar, and lime juice to the watermelon 
juice. Cover and refrigerate for 1 hour to chill and allow the flavors to blend together.
	 4	Rinse the cucumbers and pat dry.
	 5	Ladle the soup into chilled bowls (or martini glasses) and garnish with the cucumber 
slices and mint.

S
alads are among the most flexible items in a 
diabetic diet. They’re chock-full of delicious 
and nutritious veggies with complex carbohy­
drates that help people with diabetes manage 
their glucose levels. Depending on what you add 
to them, dress them with, or pair them with, they 
can be a snack, meal, appetizer, or even a terrific 
last course. Stuff them in a pita pocket for a quick

Feasting on Great Salad Greens
Whether greens are an important part of the salad you’re making or added 
just for garnish, using special and novel greens makes your salad stand out. 
Skip the pale green iceberg lettuce and buy some darker green lettuces like 
romaine and leaf lettuce instead (see Figure 9-1 for a sampling). The greener 
the leaf, the more nutrients it contains, especially magnesium, a mineral 
important for heart and bone health.

Store your salad greens in the vegetable bin of your fridge. Store romaine and 
radicchio with the head intact because the outer leaves keep the inner leaves 
moist. However, loose-leaf lettuce, like arugula and spinach, has a shorter 
shelf life. To store this type of lettuce, remove the leaves and wash and drain 
them. Gather and wrap them in a clean, damp paper towel or two and then 
store in a plastic bag. The leaves will stay fresh for a couple days, but not 
much longer.

T Grilled Romaine Caesar Salad
This delicious recipe is Vegetate’s (Washington D.C.) take on a classic Caesar salad; 
they replace the anchovies with toasted, ground nori (seaweed sheets often used for 
making sushi rolls) and instead of eggs, they use silken tofu, a high protein, cholesterol 
free improvement.
Preparation time: 10 minutes
Chill time: 30 minutes
Cook time: 5 minutes
Yield: 4 servings
1⁄2 sheet toasted nori
1 package silken tofu
2 tablespoons olive oil
11⁄2 ounces lemon juice
2 cloves garlic 
1 teaspoon vegan Worcestershire sauce
Salt and pepper to taste
6 romaine hearts
Grilled bread or croutons (garnish)
	 1	Grind nori sheet in blender or food processor to a fine powder. Add remaining ingredi­
ents (except romaine hearts and garnish) and puree until smooth. Refrigerate dressing 
for 30 minutes. 
	 2	Meanwhile, wash romaine hearts and slice off ends. Cut each romaine heart in half. 
Drizzle each half with olive oil and season with salt and pepper. 
	 3	Place each romaine heart face down on hot grill (or grill pan) for 45 seconds or until 
lightly charred. Remove and serve on chilled plate with drizzled Caesar dressing. 
Garnish with grilled bread or croutons.

T Watercress Salad
During the summer months, take advantage of all the fresh, seasonal produce that is 
available. Forget about using iceberg lettuce, which offers nearly nothing in the way of 
good nutrition. Watercress, on the other hand, is a deep green leafy lettuce that has lots 
of vitamin A and beta carotene, which is great for eye health. This green leafy vegetable 
also happens to give you nearly one-fourth of your daily need of calcium, so eat ’em up 
for your bones.

We limit the amount of Gorgonzola cheese in this dish, courtesy of Derek’s Bistro in 
Pasadena, California (see Appendix A), in order to keep the calorie and fat levels at 
an appropriate level. Gorgonzola, however, is a great cheese to use because it lends 
lots of good flavor in a small amount. Try sticking with sharper cheeses like this one, 
Parmesan, or cheddar instead of the milder ones — you’ll need less and get more flavor!
Preparation time: 30 minutes
Yield: 4 servings
Vinaigrette dressing:
1⁄2 onion, finely chopped
1 teaspoon chopped fresh thyme
1 teaspoon chopped fresh oregano
1⁄4 cup canola oil
1⁄4 cup sherry vinegar
Salt and pepper
Salad:
2 small Granny Smith apples
8 cups watercress, rinsed, destemmed and 
patted dry (purchase ready-to-use watercress 
if time is limited)
4 ounces Gorgonzola blue cheese, crumbled
1⁄2 cup roasted pecans (see the tip at the end 
of the recipe)
	 1	To prepare the vinaigrette, place the onion, thyme, and oregano into a large bowl. Add 
the canola oil and sherry vinegar. Whisk the mixture together until everything is well 
combined. Add salt and pepper to taste.
	 2	Prepare the apples just before ready to serve to maintain their freshness and color. 
Leaving the skin on, slice the apples in half and core them. Julienne (slice into long 
strips) the cored apples.
	 3	Place the watercress in a large bowl and add the dressing. (You may not need all the 
dressing, so add carefully to taste.) Dish onto four plates and sprinkle the blue cheese 
and pecans over the greens. Arrange the apples on top and serve.
Tip: To prepare the roasted pecans, preheat the oven to 350 degrees. Place a piece of 
parchment paper on a baking sheet and spread out the pecans in one even layer. Sprinkle 
with 1 teaspoon sugar. Bake for 10 minutes and then remove from the baking sheet. Set 
aside to cool.

T Fresh Mushroom Salad
This dish from Barbetta in New York City (see Appendix A) truly glorifies the mush­
room — and the praise is well-deserved. Mushrooms are a popular and versatile vegeta­
ble with numerous health benefits. They’re a great source of dietary fiber as well as 
many of the B vitamins, which can help support good energy levels.
Restaurant owner Laura Maioglio says that this salad, traditionally of Piemonte, Italy, is 
made with wild porcini mushrooms and white truffles. If you can’t obtain fresh porcini, 
cultivated cremini mushrooms still give you a delicious salad. During truffle season at 
Barbetta, the salad is served with white truffles hunted by the restaurant’s own truffle 
hounds! Drizzled on top of the mushrooms is the quite luxurious porcini olive oil in 
which porcini mushrooms steep their flavor into the oil as they sit together. Making 
your own olive oil can save you money because it costs a bundle in the specialty food 
stores!
Preparation time: 20 minutes, plus several days for steeping the olive oil
Yield: 4 servings
1 ounce dried porcini mushrooms
1 quart extra-virgin olive oil
10 ounces fresh porcini mushrooms
1 bunch Lolla Rossa lettuce (or substitute red 
leaf lettuce)
1 bunch oak leaf lettuce
Juice of 1 lemon
Salt and pepper
	 1	Prepare your own porcini olive oil by steeping the dried porcini mushrooms in the olive 
oil. Let stand a few days for the oil to acquire the flavor of the mushrooms. Save the oil 
you don’t need in this recipe for future use to give any number of dishes a fabulous 
taste.
	 2	Put 8 mushrooms aside and slice the remaining mushrooms very thin.
	 3	On 4 medium-size plates, place a few leaves of Lolla Rossa over a few oak leaf lettuce 
leaves. Place 1 whole mushroom on either side of the lettuce leaves to look as if the 
mushrooms are growing between the lettuce leaves. Place the sliced mushrooms in the 
remaining space on the plate.
	 4	Drizzle the porcini olive oil and lemon juice over the mushrooms and lettuce, and salt 
and pepper to taste.
Tip: Drizzle your extra porcini olive oil on steamed or roasted veggies, add a touch of it to 
risotto during the final stages of cooking, or use it to give a punch of flavor to a marinade.

Boning up on bagged salad blends
Fortunately, produce manufacturers are taking convenience foods to a 
healthy level for a change. Look in your produce section for prewashed, 
ready-to-use salad greens and blends. You can open a bag and have a deli­
cious meal in a matter of minutes. For super easy and quick salads, pick up 
prewashed salad blends like these:
	
✓	American blend: This familiar blend usually includes iceberg lettuce, 
carrot shreds, radish slices, and red cabbage.
	
✓	European blend: It’s a great mix to try if your salad experience stops 
at iceberg lettuce. It includes mild green leaf lettuce, romaine, iceberg, 
curly endive, and a bit of radicchio. It goes well with just about any 
dressing, toasted nuts, and any kind of cheese, including blue cheese 
and goat cheese.
	
✓	Italian blend: This blend is terrific for simple protein-based salads, light 
Caesar dressing, or a traditional Italian vinaigrette. It usually consists of 
a blend of romaine and radicchio.
	
✓	Spring mix: This tasty mixture is a staple at most fine restaurants. It’s 
usually a blend of baby greens that include baby spinach, radicchio, and 
frisée. It may also be called mesclun, spring greens, or field greens. It 
makes a gorgeous garnish or bed for serving fresh fish or steak.
Different manufacturers call different mixes by different trademarked names. 
Many blends also include other veggies, like radishes, carrots, and even snow 
peas. All blends should include a description or listing of the greens (and 
other tasty veggies) included in their package, so find what suits your fancy 
and get munching!
	
Although these salad greens blends are great, many manufacturers also sell 
salad kits, which include the salad greens, dressing, cheese, and croutons. 
Watch the fat and unnecessary calories that these convenience kits can pro­
vide. And remember, you don’t have to eat it just because it comes in the kit. 
Feel free to toss that full-fat Caesar dressing in the trash.
Growing your own greens
Growing fresh baby greens is incredibly simple, no matter where you live. 
Their shallow root systems make them ideal for indoor gardening. All you 
need is a shallow bowl or planter, high-quality potting soil, lettuce seeds, and 
a nice sunny window.

132
Part II: Healthy Recipes That Taste Great 
Here’s how you do it:
	
1.	 Fill a shallow container that has good drainage with high-quality pot­
ting soil.
	
2.	Gently press seeds into the soil.
	
	 Because you’ll be harvesting your baby greens when they’re, well, 
babies, you don’t need to space out the seeds. Go ahead and just sprin­
kle them around rather than make nice neat rows.
	
3.	Water your seeds.
	
	 Keep the seeds moist but not soggy. Light but frequent watering pro­
duces the best leafy greens.
	
4.	Set the container in a sunny window.
	
	 Most greens germinate, or sprout seeds, within a few weeks. Feel free to 
start harvesting when the greens are a few inches tall. Just trim off what 
you need with kitchen shears.
	
To keep a constant supply of greens on hand, sow a second container two 
weeks later. Use a mixture of different seeds to create your own spring mix. 
For more information on growing lettuce or other vegetables in containers, 
check out Container Gardening For Dummies, by Bill Marken and the editors of 
the National Gardening Association, published by Wiley.
Creating sensational homemade dressings
Until very recently, bottled salad dressings didn’t offer much in the way of 
flavor unless they were full of fat, salt, sugar, and other no-nos for a diabetic 
diet. Some of the newer light dressings have improved flavor, are less detri­
mental to your health, and are convenient. But there’s really no substitute for 
making dressings yourself. And believe it or not, the process is pretty simple.
To make basic diabetic-friendly vinaigrette, follow these steps:
	
1.	Measure equal parts oil (usually extra-virgin olive oil), acid (like bal­
samic vinegar or lemon juice), and stock (like low-sodium chicken 
stock) and whisk them together.
	
2.	Blend desired herbs and seasonings into the dressing and whisk some 
more.
	
To add a truly professional touch, combine all your ingredients (except the oil) 
in a food processor or blender. With the appliance running, slowly pour the oil 
into the other ingredients. The dressing will emulsify, or blend, really well.

T Truffle Vinaigrette
Chef Vitaly Paley from Paley’s Place in Portland, Oregon (see Appendix A), uses truffles 
in this vinaigrette to create a truly luxurious, distinct flavor. Truffles are similar to 
mushrooms in that they’re actually a fungus — but don’t let that fool you; they’re 
simply wonderful. You can find truffles at most fine food stores — they’re worth search­
ing for. You can drizzle this vinaigrette atop steamed vegetables or mixed greens. It 
contains no cholesterol and only a trace of saturated fat — olive oil is one of those 
heart-healthy sources of monounsaturated fat and can be beneficial for lowering choles­
terol levels.
Preparation time: 5 minutes
Yield: 18 to 20 servings (2 tablespoons per serving)
1 to 2 ounces truffles, cleaned and finely 
chopped
1 small shallot, peeled and finely chopped
3 to 4 thyme sprigs, picked and chopped
1⁄3 cup balsamic vinegar
1 cup olive oil
Salt and pepper to taste
Drizzle of truffle oil
	
	Combine all the ingredients in a bowl and whisk them together well, or combine all the 
ingredients in a jar with a lid and shake vigorously.

Often, a simple dressing is best. Steeping herbs, garlic, and dried mushrooms 
in oil gives you an excellent base to make your own tasty dressings. Add a 
little acid, like lemon juice or vinegar, and you’re on your way.
Going Beyond Greens with Tomatoes 
For many people, salad and lettuce are synonymous. While salad greens are 
amazingly nutritious, it’s fun to try your hand at other salads that highlight 
other terrific vegetables, like tomatoes and cucumbers. Flavor them up with 
other extras, such as toasted nuts and freshly made dressings, and you have 
a great alternative to a traditional salad. For another great salad without 
greens, check out the Olive and Lentil Salad in Chapter 10.

Getting nutty with salads
Nuts have an undeserved reputation for being 
fattening. Not so! In moderation, nuts are an 
excellent source of fiber and monounsaturated 
fat, the good fat. Plus, they provide you with 
long-lasting protein that helps to stabilize your 
blood sugar.
Here’s a list of seeds and nuts to try in your next 
salad:
	✓	Almonds
	✓	Cashews
	✓	Pecans
	✓	Pine nuts
	✓	Sunflower seeds
	✓	Walnuts
Whenever possible, toast nuts before adding 
them to any dish. The toasting process really 
brings out the flavor of the nuts, making them 
much more satisfying to eat. Simply place them 
in a sauté pan over medium-high heat, shaking 
them occasionally to ensure they don’t burn. 
They’re done when they become fragrant and 
slightly darker in color.
	
T Summer Tomato Salad
Although summertime is great for vibrantly red, juicy, sweet tomatoes, you can enjoy 
them year-round — and should! Tomatoes are packed with lycopene and beta carotene, 
two antioxidants known for their disease-fighting capabilities. This dish, courtesy of 
Paley’s Place in Portland, Oregon (see Appendix A) and shown in the color section, is 
low in saturated fat and contains no cholesterol but still remains intense in flavor from 
the fresh basil and garlic. In all your cooking, try using fresh herbs and spices for flavor­
ing instead of high-fat spreads and salt.
Preparation time: 10 minutes
Yield: 4 servings
4 medium tomatoes, diced small
1 garlic clove, minced
6 leaves basil, chiffonade (the sidebar 
“Flavoring salads with fresh herbs,” earlier in 
this chapter, explains chiffonade)
2 tablespoons olive oil
1 tablespoon balsamic vinegar
Salt and pepper to taste
	
	Combine all the ingredients in a large bowl and serve the salad at room temperature.
Tip: Try a combination of tomatoes in this salad to add color and flavor. Look for Green 
Zebras, yellow teardrops, pear tomatoes, grape tomatoes, and everyone’s first favorite 
tomato, the cherry. So many choices, so little time!

Adding Fresh Fruit to Your Salad
Everyone knows how refreshing fruit salad can taste, made with three or four 
of the season’s best crops. But in a diabetic diet, fruit, which is full of natural 
and easily absorbed sugars, needs to be enjoyed in moderation. How can you 
still include the juicy pleasures of fruit in a diabetic diet? By creating meals 
with small amounts of fruit and combining it with other foods, as in the fol­
lowing Fig, Mozzarella, and Mizuna Salad. Figs, mozzarella, and olive oil com­
bine to balance the fat, protein, and carbohydrates. 
Flavoring salads with fresh herbs
Fresh herbs are an excellent addition to almost 
anything, especially salad. Their robust flavors 
can help you cut down the need for adding fat 
and salt to your foods. You can mince herbs, 
but some recipes, such as the one for Summer 
Tomato Salad in this chapter, call for herbs to 
be chiffonade. Chiffonade literally means “made 
of rags,” and it pretty well describes what the 
final product looks like. Leafy lettuce or herbs 
are rolled together tightly and then thinly sliced 
width-wise to form long, stringy strips.
Here are a few descriptions of our favorite salad herbs.
	✓	Basil: Technically a member of the mint 
family, this herb has a sweet peppery flavor 
that’s the cornerstone of most pestos. Look 
for basil varieties like lemon basil and cinna­
mon basil to spice up your everyday salads.
	✓	Cilantro: Use the tender stems and leaves 
of this herb to give a pungent push to any 
Latin- or Asian-inspired dishes. It pairs 
extremely well with citrus flavors.
	✓	Dill: The feathery leaves of this pungent 
herb are the main ingredient in many a 
salad dressing and fish sauce. It’s great 
paired with citrus.
	✓	Mint: Sometimes thought of as only the des­
sert garnish, mint is used worldwide in both 
sweet and savory dishes. It’s an incredibly 
aromatic herb that can lend its fragrance 
and flavor to salad dressings, dips, condi­
ments, and beverages.
	✓	Parsley: Whether you prefer flat-leaf or 
curly parsley, this herb is recognizable to 
most people. The best way to describe its 
flavor is fresh. Some people use it as a nat­
ural breath freshener. Chop it up and throw 
it into your salad along with your greens to 
brighten your salad’s flavor.

Fig, Mozzarella, and Mizuna Salad 
	
with Thai Basil 
Tante Marie’s cooking school provides this recipe that’s a great combination of sweet and 
savory. The quick and elegant presentation makes this salad a natural for entertaining.
Mizuna is a Japanese mustard green. Its leaves are shaped much like dandelion leaves, 
but are more subtle and delicate, with a jagged edge, and a mild earthy flavor. It’s a 
great lettuce to grow yourself, so if you can’t find it in a gourmet grocery store near 
you, consider growing your own with the instructions later in this chapter. 
Preparation time: 15 minutes
Yield: 4 servings
8 green figs
12 small balls of fresh mozzarella
1 bunch or 12 ounces mizuna or arugula
1 bunch or 4 ounces Thai basil or purple mint
1⁄3 cup fruity extra-virgin olive oil
1 teaspoon coarse salt 
Freshly ground black pepper, to taste
	 1	Wash the figs and remove the little stems with a paring knife. Remove the mozzarella 
balls from their liquid. Wash the greens; drain thoroughly. Remove basil (or mint if 
using) leaves from the stems. Wash the herbs; pat the leaves dry.
	 2	Place the greens and herbs in a medium bowl and toss with the olive oil.
	 3	Pile the greens mixture in the middle of four dinner plates. Using your thumbs, gently 
pull figs in half and lay them open-side up around the greens mixture on the plates. 
Arrange 3 balls of cheese around the greens pile on each plate well. 
	 4	Sprinkle each plate with a little extra olive oil, a few drops of lemon juice, and a sprinkle 
of coarse salt. Grind fresh pepper to taste over each salad.

	 1	Preheat oven to 400 degrees.
	 2	Cut the leaves and roots from the beets. Rub them with olive oil and wrap each in foil. 
Bake beets until soft when pierced with a fork, at least 1 hour. When the beets are cool 
enough to handle, remove the skins and cut the beets into wedges.
	 3	Meanwhile, wash and dry the lettuce and place it in a large bowl.
	 4	Cut both ends off the oranges, lay them on a cut side, and with a knife, remove the rind 
in 1-inch strips around the orange, cutting down to the flesh. Squeeze any excess juice 
from the cuttings over the lettuce. Cut the skinned oranges into rounds.
	 5	Cut each avocado in half, and cut the flesh of each half into slices.
	 6	Arrange the blood orange slices, the avocado slices, and the beets over the lettuce. 
Sprinkle with pistachios or pine nuts.
	 7	When ready to serve, mix a scant half teaspoon of salt in the bowl of a spoon with the 
vinegar. Toss vinegar mixture over the salad, then add the olive oil and pepper to taste. 
Toss salad gently so that all the ingredients are lightly coated with dressing. Arrange 
salad on individual salad plates.

The typical Asian diet is getting a lot of attention in the media as being a 
healthy one. In general, Asian populations tend to have less incidence of 
heart disease, cancer, and diabetes. Their diets tend to focus on seafood as 
the main protein; plant-based foods, like soy products and rice, rather than 
dairy products; and tons of vegetables. The following recipe gives you a 
chance to sample the flavors of this healthful cuisine.
	
Teriyaki Salmon Salad
Salmon, nature’s wonder food, is full of those omega-3 fatty acids, one of the good fats.

do all that!
Preparation time: 15 minutes
Cooking time: 10 to 12 minutes
Yield: 2 servings
1 tablespoon Dijon mustard
1 tablespoon dry white cooking wine
1 tablespoon low-sodium teriyaki sauce

Punching up your salad with protein
Pairing salads and protein is a natural fit for a diabetic diet. Most of the meal 
is actually made up of the healthy veggies, accented by a small but satisfying 
portion of protein, the ideal ratio in a diabetic diet.
Canned legumes, like chickpeas (also known as garbanzo beans) and kidney 
beans, are an excellent and inexpensive way to make sure you’re getting 
enough protein. Plus these protein powerhouses are cholesterol free, making 
them an all-around excellent choice.

Preparation time: 15 minutes
Cooking time: 25 minutes
Yield: 2 servings
1 tablespoon sesame oil
12 ounces boneless, skinless chicken breasts, 
sliced into strips
1⁄2 cup baby carrots
1⁄4 teaspoon garlic powder
1⁄8 teaspoon onion powder
1⁄8 teaspoon white pepper
1⁄4 teaspoon sesame seeds
1⁄2 cup broccoli florets
1⁄4 cup celery, small sliced diagonally
1⁄2 cup snap peas
1 tablespoon low-sodium teriyaki sauce

Classic: Oriental Beef 
	
and Noodle Salad
If you have a craving for Chinese take-out, satisfy your hunger with this healthy, lowfat 
version, full of Asian flavor. Using a minimum of meat with lots of vegetables is typical 
of Chinese cooking. Although this style of cooking evolved by necessity, due to a scar­
city of meat, the result of this hardship was the creation of an exceptionally healthy cui­
sine. A good example is this beef and noodle salad, made with lean meat and a minimum 
of cooking oil.
Preparation time: 15 minutes
Cooking time: 15 minutes
Yield: 4 servings
8 ounces thin spaghetti
4 teaspoons sesame oil
Nonstick cooking spray
1 pound boneless top sirloin steak, trimmed of 
fat, cut 1-inch thick, and cut into slices about 
1⁄4-inch thick
2 teaspoons low-sodium soy sauce
2 teaspoons red wine vinegar
1 teaspoon Dijon mustard
1⁄4 teaspoon ground ginger
1 clove garlic, minced
1⁄8 teaspoon white pepper
2 tablespoons thinly sliced green onion
2 tablespoons finely chopped red bell pepper
2 teaspoons chopped fresh cilantro
Using leftovers to your advantage
“Leftovers” doesn’t have to be a dirty word. 
In fact, think of them as a life simplification 
strategy. When you’re marinating and grill­
ing chicken for dinner, double your recipe and 
reserve the extra for quick salads later in the 
week. Stop by the grocery on your way home 
and get a fresh bag of greens, and your health­
ful dinner is in the bag.
Here’s a list of great leftovers that can make an 
excellent next-day salad:
	✓	Broiled sirloin steak
	✓	Grilled chicken breast
	✓	Cocktail shrimp
	✓	Roasted turkey breast
	✓	Pan-seared beef tenderloin
	✓	Roasted pork tenderloin

 Chapter 9: Taking Salads Seriously
	 1	Bring a large pot of water to boil. Salt the boiling water and cook the spaghetti accord­
ing to package directions, typically 5 to 6 minutes. Drain, rinse under cold running 
water, and drain again. Transfer to a large bowl and toss with the sesame oil and set 
aside.
	 2	Coat a large cast-iron or nonstick skillet with the cooking spray and place over medium-
high heat until hot. Add the steak slices and cook until medium rare, about 1 minute per 
side. Add the steak to the bowl with the pasta.
	 3	In a small bowl, whisk together the soy sauce, vinegar, mustard, ginger, garlic, and 
white pepper. Add the green onions and red pepper and toss well. Add to the bowl with 
the spaghetti and steak and toss well.
	 4	Divide among four serving plates, sprinkle with the cilantro, and serve.

▶	Considering quinoa in a diabetic diet
▶	Exploring the role of legumes in healthy eating
D
iabetics must watch their intake of carbohy­
drates because they directly impact blood 
sugar levels. One big source of carbohydrates is 
grains. Grains form a part of the food guide pyra­
mid, the guide to healthy eating from the United 
States Department of Agriculture (USDA). (See 
Chapter 2 for more about the pyramid.) Talk to 
your doctor and dietitian about the best choice 
for your health situation.
In this chapter, we show you how to include rice 
and other grains in recipes and dishes to brighten 
up any meal. We provide recipes and informa­
tion on using pasta as part of your daily regimen. 
And finally, we give you the inside scoop on using 
legumes in so many ways that you’re bound to 
find something new and tasty.
Relishing Rice and 
Other Grains
Grains are truly the food that changed the world. Cultivated by early farm­
ers, they helped my ancestors become settled, non-nomadic peoples, build­
ing stable civilizations the world over. We owe a lot to these little packets of 
nutrition, like rice and quinoa.

Eating rice the right way
	
Rice is a worldwide staple, but it often gets a bad reputation because so many 
people eat the bland, processed white rice slathered with fat-heavy sauces. 
Instead, try less processed, flavored rice that can stand on its own or can 
be enhanced by a few simple seasonings or cooking techniques. And always 
remember to eat in moderation. 
	
Here are a few rice varieties that may be new to you with ideas on how to use 
them:
	
✓	Arborio: It’s an Italian short- to medium-grained rice used in making 
risotto. The rice gives off starches as it cooks to add to the creaminess 
of this popular Italian dish. Try it for yourself in the recipe for Risotto 
alle Erbe Made with Extra-Virgin Olive Oil in this section.
	
✓	Basmati: Its name means “queen of fragrance” for its distinct nutty 
aroma during cooking. Its fragrance is enhanced as it’s aged after har­
vesting. True basmati rice is grown in the foothills of the Himalayas, but 
a few new basmati-like varieties are grown in the United States under the 
names Texmati and Kasmati.
	
✓	Brown: This rice has the whole rice grain intact, with only the inedible 
outer husk removed. Because it has the bran coating intact, it’s higher in 
fiber but has a shorter shelf life (around six months). Use it in any recipe 
that calls for white rice, but give it a bit more time to cook (about 45 
minutes). To get started with it, try the Middle Eastern Brown Rice Pilaf 
in this section.
	
✓	Jasmine: Aromatic long-grain rice from Thailand, this rice is highly 
prized but less expensive than basmati. Try it out in the Black Bean Pie 
recipe later in this chapter.
	
✓	Long-grain: A broad category of rice, long-grain rice has long, evenly 
shaped pieces that tend to be drier and less starchy than short-grained 
varieties. Long-grain rice separates easily after cooking. Basmati, jas­
mine, and wild rice are all long-grain rices.
	
✓	Medium-grain: As the name implies, medium-grain rice is longer than 
short-grain rice and shorter than long-grain rice.
	
✓	Short-grain: This rice has short, almost round grains and a higher starch 
content than long-grain rice, giving it a sticky, clumpy consistency after 
cooking.
	
✓	Wild rice: This “rice” is actually the grain of a wild marsh grass. It has a 
chewy texture and nutty flavor. It’s often combined with other rice.

Middle Eastern Brown Rice Pilaf
Sometimes people complain that brown rice never seems to taste right or it just never 
achieves a good consistency. Here is a dish, contributed by food writer and For 
Dummies author Heather Dismore, that uses this whole grain and incorporates many 
other textures and flavors that will leave you loving brown rice forever! This is a good 
lesson in creativity and risk taking! Seek out new and different recipes that change the 
flavors until you find one you like. If you hesitate to try brown rice again, try this recipe 
before you swear off this healthy food forever.
Preparation time: 10 minutes
Cooking time: 1 hour
Yield: 6 servings
2 tablespoons olive oil
11⁄2 cups chopped onion
1 clove garlic, minced
2 carrots, sliced
2 cups fresh sliced mushrooms
3⁄4 cup uncooked brown rice
2 cups chicken broth
1⁄4 cup chopped fresh green onions
Salt and pepper
	 1	Heat the olive oil in a deep skillet with a tight-fitting lid over medium heat. Sauté the 
onions, stirring frequently until they soften. Add the garlic and carrots and continue 
stirring for 5 minutes. Add the mushrooms and rice and cook until the mushrooms 
soften, about 7 to 8 minutes.
	 2	Add the chicken broth. Bring to a boil. Cover and reduce the heat. Continue cooking 
until all the liquid is absorbed, approximately 45 to 50 minutes. Fluff with a fork. Toss 
with the green onions. Season with salt and pepper to taste.

T Risotto alle Erbe Made 
	
with Extra-Virgin Olive Oil
Here is a wonderful risotto dish offered to us from Barbetta restaurant in New York (see 
Appendix A). Important to note is the importance of stirring the risotto constantly! This 
is not a moment for TV watching or telephone answering! The risotto at the end should 
be smooth and flowing, and once done, you must eat it immediately. This saying in Italy 
tells the story: “You must wait for risotto, but risotto cannot wait for you.”
Making risotto with olive oil was first introduced by Barbetta Restaurant and certainly 
is a healthy change from the traditional method, which calls for butter. Essentially, 
risotto is made from Italian rice, and for people with diabetes, rice has falsely been 
accused of being “bad” food. Too many carbs, and for that matter, too much of anything 
is “bad,” but this risotto dish, served in moderation, can certainly be part of a balanced, 
healthy diet. It’s absolutely delicious and worth every bite. Pair the risotto with some 
protein, such as fish or poultry, and fiber, from nonstarchy veggies, to keep your blood 
sugars on an even keel.
Preparation time: 45 minutes
Cooking time: 20 minutes
Yield: 6 servings (1 cup each)
1 bunch fresh sage
1 bunch fresh rosemary
1 bunch fresh parsley
1 bunch fresh basil
11⁄2 quarts water
5 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil, divided
1⁄2 medium onion, finely chopped
1 teaspoon salt
Pinch of pepper
1 cup Italian rice, Carnaroti or arborio
1 cup dry white wine
1⁄2 cup grated Parmigiano cheese
Salt and pepper
	 1	From the fresh sage, rosemary, parsley, and basil, chop enough in equal parts (roughly 
3 tablespoons) of each type of herb to make 3⁄4 cup. Set aside.
	 2	Using butcher’s twine, tie together one stem each of sage, rosemary, parsley, and basil 
(once tied together, the herbs resemble a bouquet of flowers). Place the bouquet in a 
saucepan with the 11⁄2 quarts of water. Bring to a boil. Remove from heat. Allow the bou­
quet to steep for 30 minutes. Strain and keep warm. This will serve as your herb stock. 
Bring stock back to a low simmer before adding to risotto in Step 5.

149
 Chapter 10: Stocking Up on Grains and Legumes
	 3	In a 3-quart saucepan, heat 3 tablespoons of oil over medium heat.
	 4	Add the chopped onions, salt, and pepper. Cook for 1 minute. Add the rice, wine, and 
chopped herbs. Immediately stir and continue to stir every 15 seconds until the risotto 
absorbs the wine. Keep the heat medium to high.
	 5	When the wine has evaporated, begin to add simmering stock 1⁄2 cup at time, stirring 
continuously. Add a bit of salt and pepper depending on your taste. Once 1⁄2 cup of the 
stock is absorbed and the rice looks dry, add another 1⁄2 cup. Repeat until you’ve added 
roughly 3 to 4 cups of the herb stock, and the rice is soft but al dente, or firm to the 
bite. If the rice tastes hard and starchy, continue adding stock. This step takes about 25 
to 30 minutes total. Note: You must continue to stir the risotto during this stage of 
cooking. Stirring helps to bring out the starchy creaminess in the rice and ensures the 
proper texture and consistency.
	 6	Once the risotto is cooked, its consistency should resemble thick oatmeal. Remove the 
pot from the heat. Add the grated Parmigiano cheese and the remaining 2 tablespoons 
of oil. Stir very well. Allow to rest 2 minutes. Stir once more before serving. Season with 
salt and pepper to taste.

T Pumpkin Risotto
This recipe for Pumpkin Risotto, from Tante Marie’s Cooking School in San Francisco, is 
a celebration of the fall produce harvest. It calls for pumpkin, but you can substitute 
butternut, acorn, or other firm-fleshed squash for twist. 
We’ve listed nutritional information for 6 entrée servings, but you could instead create 
12 side-dish portions to serve as a side with Thanksgiving dinner, replacing mashed 
potatoes or another starchy side dish. One added healthy benefit: Because this risotto 
is so delicious, you won’t need the gravy that bland starches beg for. 
Preparation time: 10 minutes
Cooking time: 45 minutes
Yield: 6 servings
6 to 7 cups of low-sodium vegetable broth
1⁄4 cup olive oil
1 3⁄4 cups Arborio rice
11⁄2 cups peeled, seeded and diced fresh 
pumpkin
1⁄2 cup dry white wine
1 tablespoon minced fresh sage
1⁄2 teaspoon salt
1⁄4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
1⁄4 cup freshly grated Parmesan cheese
	 1	In a medium-large saucepan, heat the vegetable broth to a simmer over medium heat. 
Maintain simmer throughout the other steps. 
	 2	In a separate 3-quart heavy saucepan or skillet, heat the olive oil over medium heat. 
Toss in the rice and diced pumpkin and stir with a wooden spoon until the rice is 
coated with the oil. 
	 3	Add the white wine to the rice mixture and stir constantly until all the wine has been 
absorbed. Ladle 1⁄2 cup of hot broth into the pan and stir until it is absorbed. Continue 
with rest of the broth, adding 1⁄2 cup at a time and letting each addition be absorbed 
completely by the rice before adding more liquid. 
Remember: The constant stirring allows the rice to release its starch into the cooking 
liquid, resulting in the characteristic risotto creaminess.
	 4	When the rice is creamy and cooked through but still firm, or al dente, (roughly about 
25 to 30 minutes stirring time), stir in the sage, salt, pepper and Parmesan cheese. Serve 
immediately.

Kicking it up with quinoa
Quinoa (pronounced ke-n wäh) is considered by some to be the most nutri­
tious of all the whole grains (see Figure 10-1). This ancient superfood is 
becoming more popular, showing up on the menus of gourmet restaurants 
nationwide. Quinoa is high in protein and fiber, provides 25 percent of your 
daily iron needs, and is a tremendous source of magnesium, potassium, and 
phosphorus. It is more nutritious than white rice and in most dishes can be 
substituted for the more popular grain. 
Most mainstream grocery stores carry it these days, but if you have trouble 
tracking it down, try your local health food store. Whenever possible, opt 
for the grain itself, rather than a processed boxed quinoa pilaf. As with other 
grains, the less processed the better.
	
Always rinse quinoa thoroughly before cooking it. Don’t be tempted to skip 
this step. Even if your quinoa is processed, which removes much of the sapo­
nin¸ or protective outer covering, the dust still remains. It can add a nasty 
bitter flavor to your finished dish. Don’t risk it. Place the quinoa in a fine mesh 
strainer. Run cold water through the grains until the water runs clear. Drain 
the water off, stir the grains around a bit, and then re-rinse to ensure you’ve 
removed all the bitter outer coating.

Trying out barley
Barley is a whole grain that is a delicious side dish to serve with meats and 
poultry. Try the following recipe to include some barley in your diet.
	
Classic: Barley Pilaf
Barley that still retains the bran takes a long time to cook, so manufacturers pearl the 
barley, which means they remove the bran. Pearled barley is the kind you usually find 
in supermarkets. Look for barley with grains that are oval, not round, a sign that the 
bran is mostly intact. In comparison with rice and wheat, barley has significantly less 
effect on blood glucose. Barley is also tasty added to soups.
Preparation time: 10 minutes
Cooking time: 50 minutes
Yield: 6 servings
1 piece smoked ham hock, 6 ounces
2 stalks celery, cut into 2-inch lengths
2 bay leaves
1⁄2 teaspoon dried sage
Pepper
4 cups water
1 tablespoon safflower oil
1 medium onion, chopped
1 cup pearled barley
	 1	In a large pot, put the ham hock, celery, bay leaves, sage, pepper to taste, and water. 
Over high heat, bring to a boil, lower the heat to medium, and cook, uncovered, for 20 
minutes. Volume of the broth will reduce by about 1 cup.
	 2	In a medium pot, heat the safflower oil over medium heat. Cook the onion, stirring occa­
sionally, until soft, about 5 minutes. Add the barley and cook, stirring for 1 minute.
	 3	When the ham hock stock is prepared, pour the broth through a sieve into the barley. 
Bring to a boil.
	 4	Turn the heat to low, cover the pot, and cook the barley until tender and all the liquid is 
absorbed, about 30 minutes. If the barley is not quite done, add 1 or 2 tablespoons 
water and continue to cook. If the barley is cooked but liquid remains, turn off heat and 
let the barley rest in the covered pot while the grain continues to absorb the liquid.

Preparing Perfect Pasta
	
Pasta comes in many shapes and sizes (see Figure 10-2 for a sampling). Here 
are some guidelines to help you decide what works for your recipe:
	
✓	For lighter, brothy sauces and pestos, choose delicate, long pasta, like 
vermicelli, spaghetti, linguine, or angel hair.
	
✓	For meatier, chunkier sauces or pasta salads, choose shorter shapes 
with ridges or holes, like cavatelli, penne, farfalle, and wagon wheels. 
The smaller pieces make it easier to grab pasta and sauce with every 
bite. And the ridges and holes in the pasta grab bits and chunks of your 
sauce.
	
✓	For heavier and creamier sauces, choose flat, ribbonlike pasta, such as 
fettuccine.
Most pasta is made from semolina flour, not refined white flour. It’s a com­
plex carbohydrate, rather than a simple carbohydrate, meaning that it gives 
your body more lasting energy and a more gradual release of sugar. A 1⁄2 cup 
serving of cooked pasta contains 99 calories, less than half a gram of fat, and 
less than 5 milligrams of sodium, and it costs you only 1 starch exchange.
	
Here are a few other benefits of choosing pasta.
	
✓	It has a relatively low glycemic index of 41. For more about the glycemic 
index and how it can help you manage your blood glucose levels, check 
out Chapter 2.
	
✓	It’s a quick food to prepare. You can get this filling side dish ready in 
about 10 minutes.
	
✓	It goes with just about anything. Pasta is so versatile. You can toss it with 
chicken broth and fresh herbs, or fresh veggies and a little bit of olive 
oil. If you can cook it, you can serve it with pasta.
 
• Create Chinese flavored dishes with a splash of sesame oil, 
crunchy water chestnuts, bok choy, and cilantro. Add thinly sliced 
beef for a full meal.
 
• Mix up a Mediterranean delight by adding tomatoes, garlic, and 
fresh basil. Throw in some pine nuts and seafood for a lowfat, tasty 
weeknight supper.
 
• Invent your own Latin lunch, by including grilled onions, chicken 
breast, chiles, and chayote squash.
 
• Introduce flavors from the Caribbean by tossing pasta with shrimp, 
flaked coconut, jerk seasonings, and vegetable stock.
 
• Work in some Vietnamese inspired cuisine, by adding it to vegeta­
ble broth, chopped chiles, cilantro, and lean pork.

✓	It’s very filling. A 1⁄2 cup serving may not seem like much, but a little can 
go a long way, especially if you bulk up the fiber content of your dish 
with fresh veggies. Or opt for 2 starch servings, and have a full cup of 
pasta and enjoy it as a main course.

T Classic: Butterfly Pasta with 
	
Sun-Dried Tomatoes and 
	
Artichoke Hearts
The few ingredients that this simple recipe calls for complement each other perfectly, 
as you can see from the photo in the color section. The dish is a certified crowd 
pleaser, full of color and flavor and ideal for entertaining. The pasta is best served at 
room temperature, so you can make it hours in advance, freeing you for the last-minute 
details of throwing a party.
Preparation time: 15 minutes (plus overnight marinating time)
Cooking time: 10 minutes
Yield: 4 servings
2 ounces sun-dried tomatoes, chopped
1⁄2 cup extra-virgin olive oil
3 cloves garlic, minced
1⁄2 cup finely chopped basil leaves, plus extra 
whole leaves for garnish
1 jar (15 ounces) marinated artichoke hearts, 
drained
8 ounces butterfly pasta
Salt and pepper (optional)
Grated Parmesan cheese (optional)
	 1	In a shallow bowl, combine the tomatoes, olive oil, garlic, and basil. Let rest overnight 
to allow the tomatoes to rehydrate.
	 2	Transfer the tomato mixture to a large bowl and add the artichoke hearts. Lightly toss 
together.
	 3	Bring a large pot of water to boil and cook the pasta according to the directions on the 
package until the pasta is al dente, cooked but not soft. Drain and add to the tomato 
artichoke mixture. Adjust seasoning with salt and pepper.
	 4	Serve at room temperature, garnished with whole basil leaves and Parmesan cheese on 
the side, if desired.

Classic: Seafood Farfalle Salad
It’s no surprise that in Italy, a country with many port cities, many pasta dishes include 
fish. The Italians have even figured out how to use the black ink of octopus in one spe­
cial pasta dish. This recipe is much tamer, however. It’s a low-calorie but quite satisfy­
ing combination of seafood and pasta. Using farfalle, pasta shaped like a butterfly or a 
bow tie, adds eye appeal. If you have access to a specialty Italian food market, you may 
even be able to find farfallini, the smallest butterflies, or farfallone, the largest.
Preparation time: 25 minutes
Cooking time: 20 to 25 minutes
Yield: 4 servings
8 ounces farfalle pasta
Nonstick cooking spray
1⁄2 pound bay scallops
1⁄2 pound cooked baby shrimp
1⁄2 teaspoons white wine vinegar
1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil
1 teaspoon freshly squeezed lemon juice
1 teaspoon dried thyme leaves
1 clove garlic, minced
2 teaspoons chopped fresh parsley
1⁄8 teaspoon black pepper
1⁄2 cup plum tomatoes, peeled, seeded, and 
diced
1 small cucumber, peeled, seeded, and diced
2 tablespoons seeded and finely chopped 
green bell pepper
	 1	Bring a large pot of water to a boil. Salt the boiling water and cook the farfalle according 
to package directions. Drain, rinse under cold running water, and drain again. Set aside.
	 2	Meanwhile, coat a medium nonstick skillet with cooking spray or 2 teaspoons of canola 
oil and place over medium heat until hot. Add the scallops and shrimp, a few at a time, 
and sauté, turning them as they brown, allowing 11⁄2 to 2 minutes per side; remove them 
to a bowl as they finish.
	 3	In a large bowl, whisk together the vinegar, olive oil, lemon juice, thyme, garlic, parsley, 
and pepper. Add the tomatoes, cucumber, and green pepper and mix thoroughly. 
Combine the pasta, scallops (and their released juices), and shrimp. Toss the pasta 
mixture with the dressing mixture.

Although most of the pasta you’ll find in your local grocery is made from 
semolina flour, you can find pasta made from a variety of different flours, 
including these:
	
✓	Brown rice: This pasta is a great alternative for people allergic to wheat. 
Check the label, but most brown rice pasta is both wheat and gluten 
free. They may also be dairy-free and organic. Try this delicious pasta in 
the following recipe.

161
 Chapter 10: Stocking Up on Grains and Legumes
	
✓	Soy: Pasta made with soy flour tends to be higher in protein and lower 
in carbohydrate than semolina pasta, but always read the label to make 
sure you’re making the right choice for your needs.
	
✓	Whole wheat: If you’re looking for a higher fiber pasta, whole-wheat 
pasta may be what you’re looking for. It’s characterized by a more 
robust flavor than its semolina counterpart.
2 teaspoons safflower oil
1 medium onion, chopped
1 egg, slightly beaten
1 cup kasha (buckwheat groats)
1⁄2 cup sliced button mushrooms
2 cups boiling vegetable broth or water
Pepper
Sea salt (optional)
4 cups water
11⁄2 cups brown rice rotini (Lundberg brand)
	 1	In a heavy medium saucepan, heat the oil and sauté the onion until translucent, 5 to 7 
minutes.
	 2	Beat the egg in a small bowl. Add the kasha and mix together, coating each grain with 
the egg. Add to the onions. Cook the kasha while stirring until the grains are dry and 
separated.
	 3	Add the mushrooms, broth, pepper, and sea salt, if desired. Cover the skillet and 
simmer until all the liquid is absorbed, about 15 minutes.
	 4	In the meantime, bring the 4 cups water to a boil in a large pot. Add the rotini and cook 
for 6 minutes, or until tender but still firm. Drain and, if necessary, keep warm while the 
kasha finishes cooking.
	 5	When the kasha is fully cooked, fluff with a fork and stir in the rotini.

T Classic: Kasha and 
	
Brown Rice Pasta
Sometimes simple food, such as this delicious combination of kasha and pasta, tastes 
the best. Kasha is buckwheat groats (hulled and crushed buckwheat). The flavors are 
mellow and nutty with just a hint of mushroom, a step beyond blandness but still quiet 
comfort food. This mixture is meant to be a background dish, served with savory foods 
such as a chicken roasted with herbs or slow-cooked flank steak prepared with onion 
and dried fruits. This merger of whole grains and pasta is especially favored in Eastern 
European and Russian cooking.

Letting Legumes into Your Diet
Legumes (pronounced LAY-gooms) are the protein-packed staple of a vegetar­
ian diet, but you don’t have to swear off meat to enjoy them. The family of 
grains includes thousands of plant species, including beans, soybeans, len­
tils, peas, and the beloved peanut.
It’s tough to find a more perfect all-round food than legumes. They’re rich 
in protein, low in fat (what fat they do have is the good fat), high in dietary 
fiber, and rich in complex carbohydrates and vitamins. Besides being 
healthy, they’re inexpensive, very versatile, and easy to use. They store well 
when dried, and have a shelf life of a full year.
	
Because legumes are also high in carbohydrate, a person with diabetes still 
needs to be mindful of portion sizes here. The benefits that the fiber and pro­
tein provide, however, make them a more optimal choice than the usual carbs 
like bread, pasta, or rice.
	
Red-Wine-Braised Lentils
This recipe, courtesy of Poggio in Sausalito, California (see Appendix A), is an easy 
accompaniment to any poultry or meat dish. The hearty lentils are flavored by the slow-
cooked method of braising in which they begin to achieve the flavor of the red wine. 
Lentils are a complex carbohydrate full of fiber, as well as a good source of protein.
Preparation time: 10 minutes
Cooking time: 1 hour and 20 minutes
Yield: 6 servings
1 tablespoon butter
2 tablespoons olive oil
1 cup diced onions
1⁄2 cup chopped celery
1⁄2 cup diced carrots
Salt and pepper
1⁄2 teaspoon thyme leaves
2 ounces diced prosciutto
1⁄8 cup dried porcini mushrooms, reconstituted 
and sliced (see the tip at the end of the recipe)
11⁄2 cups red wine
2 cups dried brown lentils
1 bay leaf
5 cups low-sodium chicken broth

163
 Chapter 10: Stocking Up on Grains and Legumes
	 1	In a medium saucepan, heat the butter and olive oil. Sauté the onions, celery, and carrots, 
until they begin to sweat, or give off a bit of liquid. Season the vegetables with salt and pepper 
to taste and cover the pot. Cook until the vegetables are soft, approximately 10 minutes.
	 2	Add the thyme, prosciutto, and dried porcini mushrooms. Add the wine and reduce by 
one-third. Add the lentils, bay leaf, and chicken broth and simmer for about 1 hour, 
until the lentils are soft.
	 3	Remove the bay leaf. Adjust the salt and pepper if needed. This dish may be refriger­
ated for up to 3 days, until ready to use.
Tip: To reconstitute the dried porcini mushrooms, place them in 1⁄4 cup hot water for 30 
minutes, chop them, and strain the liquid. If you want, you can use the liquid as part of the 
cooking liquid. Just substitute the mushroom broth for 1⁄4 cup of the chicken broth in Step 2.

Lentils are quick cooking legumes, so you don’t need to soak them before 
cooking like you do with dried beans. If you’re extra conscientious, feel free 
to pick over the lentils, as you would with dried beans. Rinse them well to 
remove any dirt or other debris. Then sort through them a handful at a time, 
looking for dirt clods, stones, and other foreign particles. Try them in soups, 
saucy Indian curries, or this terrific “salad.”

T Olive and Lentil Salad
This dish, from Heather Dismore, is considered a “salad,” but don’t let that word fool 
you! This dish is unlike many salads — it’s hearty and will keep you full and satisfied for 
a long time. This olive and lentil mix has a ton of fiber and protein (from the lentils) and 
enough heart-healthy monounsaturated fats (from the olives) that will digest slowly and 
therefore keep you feeling full for longer. It has only a moderate amount of carbohy­
drates, so your blood sugars won’t be hugely affected here. This one-pot meal offers 
you a significant amount of iron, calcium, folate, and vitamins A, C, and B6.
Preparation time: 30 minutes
Cooking time: 40 minutes
Yield: 6 servings
Salad:
1 cup dry lentils
2 bay leaves
1 sprig fresh thyme
1 carrot, finely chopped
1 stalk celery, finely chopped
2 tablespoons minced shallots
1 tablespoon minced garlic
2 Roma tomatoes, seeded and sliced thinly
1⁄2 yellow bell pepper, diced
1 jar (8 ounces) green olives, roughly chopped 
(reserve juice for the dressing)
2 tablespoons roughly chopped fresh oregano
Salt and pepper
4 ounces goat cheese, crumbled
Dressing:
1⁄4 cup red wine vinegar
2 tablespoons green olive juice
1 tablespoon minced shallot
3 teaspoons Dijon mustard
1 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon pepper
1⁄4 cup olive oil
	 1	In a 2-quart saucepan, combine the lentils, bay leaves, thyme, carrots, celery, shallots, 
and garlic. Cover with 2 inches of water. Bring to a low boil and cook until the lentils are 
just tender, about 40 minutes. Drain and set aside to cool.
	 2	After the lentils have cooled, add the tomatoes, peppers, olives, and oregano. Mix thor­
oughly. Salt and pepper to taste. Gently stir in the goat cheese.
	 3	In a blender, combine the vinegar, olive juice, shallot, mustard, salt, and pepper. 
Remove the knob from the lid of the blender. With the blender running, slowly pour in 
the olive oil to emulsify the dressing. Adjust seasonings as necessary. Pour over the 
salad and toss gently to coat.

“Beans, beans, they’re good for your heart.” Well, this in fact is very true. 
Beans offer a tremendous amount of fiber, more specifically soluble fiber — 
the type that can lower your LDL, or “bad” cholesterol. Because they’re plant 
based, they have no cholesterol.
	
T White Beans and Spinach
Beans are part of the standard diet of almost every culture, and the Italians are no 
exception. Heather Dismore contributed this recipe that uses the cannellini beans, an 
Italian staple, paired with nutritious vitamin-A-rich spinach. Use canned beans and pre­
washed spinach to make this nutritious powerhouse as easy to make as it is to enjoy.
Preparation time: 10 minutes
Cooking time: 20 minutes
Yield: 4 servings
1 tablespoon olive oil
1⁄2 cup diced onions
3 cloves garlic, peeled and sliced thinly
1 cup sliced cremini mushrooms
1⁄4 cup white wine
1 tablespoon Dijon mustard
Half a 10-ounce bag of triple-washed spinach
1 can (15 ounces) white beans (like navy, 
cannellini, or great Northern), rinsed and 
drained
2 tablespoons fresh minced oregano
Salt and pepper
	 1	Heat the olive oil in a skillet over medium-high heat. Add the onions and sauté until 
translucent. Add the garlic and mushrooms. Cook until just fragrant. Add the white wine 
and mustard. Scrape up any browned bits that may be stuck to the skillet.
	 2	Add the spinach and cover. Steam the spinach for 3 to 4 minutes, or until wilted but still 
bright green. Add the white beans. Continue to cook until heated through. Add the oreg­
ano and salt and pepper to taste. Adjust seasonings as necessary.

You can find many canned legumes in your grocery store. They’re a bit 
more expensive than the dried variety, but they can help you create a well-
balanced nutritious meal quickly. Keep a few cans in your cupboard for quick 
and satisfying meals, like this Black Bean Pie, that will keep you full and keep 
your blood sugar stable.

When using canned anything, like beans or veggies, whenever possible, drain 
and rinse the food before cooking to get rid of excess sodium. But before you 
toss out the liquid, remember to double-check the recipe. Some recipes, like 
the one for Black Bean Pie here, use the liquid in the recipe.
	
T Black Bean Pie
This recipe is a great way to get most of the basic food groups covered. The beans, pep­
pers, and cilantro can stop a craving for Mexican food dead in its tracks. Serve it up 
with a crisp green salad to round out your meal plan.
Preparation time: 45 minutes
Cooking time: 20 minutes
Yield: 6 servings
1 can (14 ounces) black beans
1⁄2 cup jasmine rice, uncooked
1 9-inch frozen pie shell
Nonstick cooking spray
1⁄2 cup diced onion
1⁄4 cup diced red bell pepper
1⁄4 cup diced green bell pepper
1 tablespoon chopped fresh cilantro
1 teaspoon garlic powder
1 teaspoon cumin, ground
1 teaspoon chili powder
1⁄2 teaspoon cayenne pepper
2 tablespoons cornstarch
3⁄4 cup shredded cheddar cheese
	 1	Preheat the oven to 350 degrees. Drain the black beans and reserve the juice. Set aside.
	 2	Cook the jasmine rice according to package directions. Set aside. While the rice is cook­
ing, bake the pie shell until slightly browned, approximately 5 to 7 minutes. Set aside.
	 3	Heat a medium skillet over medium-high heat. Once it’s heated, spray with the cooking 
spray. Add the onions and red and green peppers. Sauté until the vegetables are crisp-
tender, approximately 5 to 7 minutes. Set aside.
	 4	In a bowl, combine the beans, rice, onion mixture, cilantro, garlic powder, cumin, chili 
powder, and cayenne pepper. In another bowl, combine the reserved black bean juice 
with the cornstarch to make a paste. Mix the paste into the black bean mixture.
	 5	Spread the black bean mixture in the pie shell. Cover with the cheese. Bake for 15 to 20 
minutes, until the cheese starts to brown. Let set for 15 minutes before serving.

T Southwestern Hummus
Hummus is a classic Mediterranean and Middle Eastern dish, but this rendition, from 
Heather Dismore (and shown in the color section), is spicy and southwestern. This 
creamy spread (with little fat!) makes for a surprisingly healthy appetizer — great 
served with whole-wheat pita bread wedges, baked tortilla chips, or raw vegetables. (If 
you’re looking for other delicious dipper ideas to pair with this tasty spread, check out 
Chapter 7.) The main ingredients here are garbanzo beans, or chickpeas, which are an 
excellent vegetarian source of protein, as well as dietary fiber — two great reasons why 
hummus makes for a perfect snack also. Protein and fiber are essential for good blood 
sugar control, so keep a bowl of hummus on hand when you’re looking for something 
light, quick, and easy.
Preparation time: 10 minutes
Yield: 4 servings
11⁄2 tablespoons minced garlic
2 cans (15 ounces each) garbanzo beans, 
drained and rinsed
1⁄4 cup salsa
2 tablespoons fresh lime juice
1 teaspoon cumin
1⁄2 teaspoon chili powder
1 teaspoon cayenne (more or less as you 
prefer)
1 tablespoon olive oil
1⁄3 cup roughly chopped cilantro
Salt and pepper
Garnishes (optional):
1 tablespoon light sour cream
2 tablespoons diced avocado
1 tablespoon minced cilantro
1 tablespoon minced black olives
	 1	Place the garlic, beans, salsa, lime juice, cumin, chili powder, cayenne pepper, olive oil, 
cilantro, and salt and pepper to taste in a food processor. Adjust seasonings to taste. 
Place in a covered bowl. Chill in the refrigerator for 2 to 3 hours to allow flavors to 
meld, or blend thoroughly.
	 2	When ready to serve, spread the hummus in the bottom of a medium-sized serving 
bowl, and top with the garnishes in the following order: light sour cream, avocado, 
cilantro, and black olives.

reunion when you were nine or were forced to sit in front of a plate of luke­
warm boiled carrots you just couldn’t choke down, you probably have one 
you just don’t like. Well, hopefully, we’re about to change that.
In this section, we give you delicious recipes using traditional vegetables that 
you can find in the kitchens of most people but that you may not be fond of — 
yet. But never fear — after trying a few, you’ll have a whole new appreciation for 
them.
Including delicious extras
The following recipes focus on adding tasty flavors such as rice vinegar, herbs, 
and cheese to old stand-by vegetables like collard greens, broccoli, and zuc­
chini. Try them the next time you want to add some zing to your veggies.
	
T Vegetate Collard Greens 
Vegetate, the award winning vegetarian restaurant in Washington D.C., provided this 
recipe for sautéed collard greens. By slicing the collard greens thinly, you can reduce 
the cooking time, so the greens retain their nutritional value, freshness, and color. Try 
this cooking technique with any local greens.
Preparation time: 10 minutes
Cooking time: 10 minutes
Yield: 4 servings 
1 bunch collard greens (washed and 
de-stemmed)
1 tablespoon grapeseed oil
1 tablespoon minced garlic
1 tablespoon minced shallot
Salt and pepper to taste
1 teaspoon red chili flakes
1 tablespoon rice vinegar
	 1	Stack 4 to 5 collard green leaves and roll into cigar shape. Slice about 1-inch-thick slices 
with sharp knife to create ribbons of collard greens. Continue until all leaves are sliced. 
	 2	Add grapeseed oil to sauté pan over medium to high heat. Sweat garlic and shallots for 
about 1 minute (do not burn) and add collard green ribbons. Toss the greens with 
tongs. Add salt, pepper, and chili flake. Collards should be shiny and starting to lightly 
brown on edges. Add rice vinegar and toss. Serve immediately.

Broccoli is one of the most nutritious veggies out there. If you still can’t seem 
to acquire a liking for it though, look no further. Prepare the following elegant 
recipe for your family or guests, and everyone will be so pleasantly surprised — 
especially when you tell them the rich, savory sauce has barely any fat.
	
T Broccoli with Creamy Lemon Sauce
Who doesn’t love broccoli and cheese? And for most of us, the more cheese the better! 
And what’s even better, you can enjoy this one (courtesy of food writer Heather 
Dismore) guilt-free. This creamy sauce is made with mainly lowfat ingredients instead 
of the full-fat dairy products that usually go into rich sauces. Just be sure not to add any 
more salt. The cottage cheese and Parmesan already contribute enough for flavor.
Preparation time: 10 minutes
Cooking time: 35 minutes
Yield: 6 servings
2⁄3 cup lowfat cottage cheese
1⁄4 cup evaporated skim milk
2 tablespoons grated Parmesan cheese
1 teaspoon lemon juice
1⁄8 teaspoon ground turmeric
White pepper
3 cups hot cooked broccoli florets
	 1	In a blender, combine the cottage cheese, milk, Parmesan cheese, lemon juice, turmeric, 
and white pepper to taste and purée until the mixture achieves a thin consistency, 
about 30 seconds.
	 2	Heat the sauce in a skillet, stirring occasionally, until heated through, but do not boil.
	 3	Serve the sauce over the warm broccoli.

T Zucchini and Parmigiano-Reggiano 
	
Salad
This recipe is sure to become a favorite in your household. Chef Kevin Rathbun of 
Rathbun’s in Atlanta (see Appendix A) uses simple, quality ingredients like Parmigiano-
Reggiano (the original and best Parmesan cheese in the world), extra-virgin olive oil, 
and fresh lemon juice to give this dish rich flavors with very little effort.
Preparation time: 15 minutes
Yield: 4 servings
3 medium zucchini, peeled and sliced
1⁄2 cup Parmigiano-Reggiano, shaved thin
1 tablespoon lemon juice
4 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil
1 teaspoon sea salt
1⁄2 teaspoon pepper
2 tablespoons chopped lemon verbena
	
	Place the zucchini in a bowl and shave the Parmigiano-Reggiano in the bowl. Add the 
lemon juice, olive oil, salt, pepper, and verbena. Toss to incorporate the ingredients 
and serve.
Tip: Lemon verbena is a potent herb, with a strong lemon flavor. Look for it in specialty 
food markets. Alternatively, look for it at your local nursery and grow your own. If you can’t 
find it, you can always pick another herb (like tarragon or basil). The substitution will 
change the flavor but will still be delicious.

T Chunky Zucchini-Tomato Curry
This veggie dish is delicious, perfect as a side or as a dip or on top of crisp crostini. It’s 
full of Indian-inspired spices and remains modestly low in calories and fat. No added 
salt is needed as the spices already offer plenty of flavor. Heather Dismore offers this 
unique way to serve up simple veggies like zucchini and tomatoes. Be creative with 
spices like the ones used here to make vegetables that you and your guests will love.

Enhancing natural flavors 
with dry steaming
Dry steaming refers to cooking vegetables in their own natural juices rather 
than adding additional moisture. In the case of carrots, they have a medium 
to high moisture content, so when you heat them in a closed environment 
(like in a pot with a tight-fitting lid), they use the liquid that they give off 
during the cooking process to create steam and facilitate the cooking pro­
cess. So the food is essentially steamed without adding any water. You get a 
similar effect when you microwave vegetables without adding water.
	
Don’t microwave vegetables, or anything else, in a completely closed con­
tainer. Always provide a vent of some sort for steam to escape.
2 tablespoons olive oil
1 medium red onion, finely diced
2 teaspoons grated fresh ginger
4 cloves garlic, minced
1 teaspoon ground coriander
2 teaspoons curry powder
1 cup canned crushed tomatoes
1 pound zucchini, quartered lengthwise and 
large diced

T Dry-Steamed Dilled Carrots
Here’s a tasty twist on a veggie favorite. Heather Dismore uses fresh herbs here to give 
these carrots a new and interesting flavor. Carrots are one of the best sources of vita­
min A, antioxidants, lutein, and beta carotene. These are the nutrients best known for 
eye health. The orange fruits and vegetables are all good sources of these antioxidants, 
so get them in whenever you can!

Blanching vegetables for 
optimum taste and nutrition
Blanching is a terrific technique for cooking vegetables without losing many 
of the vitamins that make them so healthy for you. It’s also surprisingly 
simple. You immerse vegetables in boiling water, leave them in the water 
for a short period of time, and then shock them, or immerse them in ice-cold 
water to stop the cooking. This technique helps to prevent the vegetables 
from getting mushy. Check out Figure 11-1 to see the basic steps.
Here are the detailed steps to follow for blanching vegetables.
	
1.	Bring salted water to vigorous boil in a 2-quart saucepan.
	
2.	 While the water is working up to a boil, prepare the ice bath.

175
 Chapter 11: Adding Veggies to Your Meals
	
	 Fill a medium-sized mixing bowl one-half to three-fourths full with ice. 
Add water to just cover the ice.
	
3.	Blanch the vegetables.
	
	 Place the trimmed vegetables, in batches if necessary, in the boiling 
water. Cook the vegetables until they’re crisp tender.
	
	 You want to keep a constant boil, but adding too many veggies at a time 
can slow down the process.
	
4.	 Shock the vegetables.
	
	 Remove the vegetables with a slotted spoon and immediately place 
them in the ice bath. Remove them from the ice bath after the vegeta­
bles are completely cooled, usually 1 to 2 minutes.
	
	 To check for doneness, remove a single vegetable piece with a slotted 
spoon; submerge it in the ice bath until it’s cool enough to place in your 
mouth. Then actually taste it to check the texture. Do this step quickly 
so that if the veggies are ready, the rest of them in the boiling water 
won’t overcook while you’re testing.
	
5.	 Reheat the vegetables and season as desired.

Give blanching a try with several of the recipes in this book, including the follow­
ing recipe for Haricot Vert and the Yellow Tomato Sauce later in this chapter.
	
T Haricot Vert
Haricot vert (pronounced ah-ree-co VEHR) is a fancy French word that literally means 
“green beans” and refers to (surprise!) green beans, or what we sometimes call string 
beans. If you find true French haricot vert in a gourmet market, use them in this recipe. 
They’re a bit smaller and thinner than common string beans, but the flavor is very simi­
lar. But if you can’t find them, feel free to substitute fresh string beans. Canned beans 
won’t work because they’re already cooked beyond tender. The Baricelli Inn in 
Cleveland (see Appendix A) contributed this classic and simple recipe. Enjoy this ele­
gant vegetable with any hearty entrée.

177
 Chapter 11: Adding Veggies to Your Meals
Preparation time: 10 minutes
Cooking time: 10 minutes
Yield: 6 servings
6 cups string beans
2 tablespoons butter
Salt and pepper
	
	Cut off the ends of the beans and blanch in boiling water for 1 minute (see the instruc­
tions earlier in this section); remove and place them in a cold water bath with ice. Drain 
and reheat in a skillet with the butter and salt and pepper to taste.
Tip: Serve these tasty veggies with Veal Tenderloin with Chanterelle Mushrooms in Chapter 
14, also from the Baricelli Inn.

Using Vegetables in Place of Pasta
Pasta gets a lot of bad press these days, but the biggest problem with it is the 
portion size that most people typically eat. For healthy ways to include pasta 
and other grains in your diabetic diet, check out Chapter 10.
When you’re craving the rich delicious Italian sauces but don’t want the 
carbs of traditional pasta, veggies make a terrific substitute. Make “noodles” 
from strings of cucumber or slices of zucchini. Get started with this great 
Zucchini and Cucumber Linguine with Clams.
	
A mandoline is a handy tool to have around your kitchen. Take a look at it in 
Figure 11-2. It’s a manual slicing device that quickly makes consistently sized 
cuts of foods. You can use it to julienne or make even 1⁄4 -inch strips of cucum­
ber (as in the next recipe). You can make paper-thin strips of sweet potatoes 
for making your own baked chips or thick lemon wheels for water. Consider 
getting one to ease the prep work of making your own veggie noodles. Look 
for a mandoline at your local cooking supply store or gourmet shop.

T Zucchini and Cucumber 
	
Linguine with Clams
David Burke, executive chef at DavidBurke and Donatella in New York City (see 
Appendix A), offers this shellfish lover’s delight. After steeping in the delicious wine and 
clam sauce, the zucchini and cucumbers actually begin to taste much like linguine, with­
out the calories and carbohydrate. You’re sure to impress your guests when you serve 
this light appetizer at your next dinner party. Because this dish is low in calories, they’ll 
even have plenty of room left for the main course.
Clams are chock-full of vitamin B12 and iron. If you’re cutting back on fat by avoiding 
red meat, you can feel confident that you won’t be missing out on these essential nutri­
ents, which are abundant in carnivorous diets. By the way, when purchasing clams and 
other shellfish, be sure the shells are closed. The open ones can be contaminated and 
cause severe food-borne illness.
Preparation time: 20 minutes
Cooking time: 20 minutes
Yield: 4 servings
2 tablespoons olive oil
2 tablespoons chopped garlic
2 tablespoons chopped shallots
1⁄4 cup minced red peppers
18 to 24 Manila or littleneck clams
11⁄2 cups white wine
2 lemons (juice and zest)
1 tablespoon butter
Salt and pepper
1 teaspoon red pepper flakes
1 large seedless cucumber, cut into long 
julienne strips to resemble noodles (use a 
mandoline or a sharp knife)
1 large zucchini, julienned
1⁄4 cup chopped parsley
	 1	Heat the olive oil in a sauté pan. Add the garlic, shallots, and red peppers and sauté 
until golden, approximately 10 minutes. Add the clams, white wine, and lemon juice. 
Cover and bring to a boil. Continue to cook until the clams open, approximately 5 
minutes.

179
 Chapter 11: Adding Veggies to Your Meals
	 2	When the clams open, add the butter, salt and pepper to taste, and the red pepper 
flakes. Remove the clams. Toss in the cucumber and zucchini noodles and heat until 
they are warm and wilted, approximately 7 minutes.
	 3	Divide among 4 bowls and top each with the clams and the remaining juice. Garnish 
with the chopped parsley and lemon zest.

Making the Most of Mushrooms
If you haven’t taken a tour of the produce department lately, you might be sur­
prised by the variety of mushrooms out there (some can be seen in Figure 11-3), 
each with a distinct look and flavor. In this section, chefs from several award-
winning vegetarian restaurants have supplied some creative ways to get the 
most flavor out of their favorite fungi.

Giving Veggies the Gourmet Treatment
Vegetables are ripe for dressing up with the full gourmet treatment. They’re 
flavorful on their own, but they take most seasonings, spices, and cooking 
techniques very well. You really can’t mess them up unless you overcook 
them. Experiment with your favorite recipes by using the techniques in this 
chapter. Also, try a few that you haven’t tried before just to broaden your 
vegetable horizon.
	
T Pickled Vegetables
Have your favorite veggies, but pickle them. Be creative! Try this with any vegetables 
you like. Eccolo restaurant in Berkeley, California (see Appendix A), serves these pick­
led vegetables as a side to many dishes. It’s a tasty way to satisfy hunger pains without 
sending those blood sugars through the roof. You can see this dish in the color section.
Preparation time: 30 minutes
Cooking time: 3 minutes
Yield: 20 servings, or 3 pounds of pickles
1 tablespoon yellow mustard seed
1 teaspoon fennel seed
1 teaspoon black peppercorns
4 dried pepperoncini
2 bay leaves
3 cups water
1 cup white wine vinegar
3 sprigs thyme
1 cup sugar
3 tablespoons salt
3 pounds vegetables (such as carrots, 
cauliflower, cherry peppers, fennel, onions, or 
turnips), cleaned and cut into bite-sized 
pieces
	 1	Combine the mustard seed, fennel seed, peppercorns, pepperoncini, bay leaves, water, 
vinegar, thyme, sugar, and salt in a large pot and bring to a boil. Add the vegetables and 
simmer for about 3 minutes.
	 2	Turn off the heat, but leave the vegetables in the pickling solution. The residual heat 
will cook them through.
	 3	Discard the pickling juice and store in the refrigerator for up to 5 days.
Tip: Serve these pickles with sandwiches or fried fish or just snack on them on their own.

Zucchini is a terrific all-around vegetable. You can eat it raw, stew it, bake it 
in muffins, grill it, steam it, blanch it, or melt cheese on it. It makes excellent 
“noodles” (check out the Zucchini and Cucumber Linguine with Clams recipe 
earlier in this chapter). To get an idea of just how versatile this veggie is (and 
how much you can dress it up), check out the following recipe.
	
T Goat-Cheese-Stuffed Zucchini 
	
with Yellow Tomato Sauce
Kyle Ketchum, from Lark in Detroit, Michigan (see Appendix A), has prepared this dish, 
which can make for a lovely appetizer, a side entree, or even a small meal. The distinct 
flavors of garlic, lemon, tomato, and savory goat cheese meld into one phenomenal 
flavor. They each stand strong alone, however, and are sure to come alive with every 
moment in your mouth. This vibrant dish is high in protein and quite low in carbohy­
drate, making it suitable for people managing their blood sugars. Keep in mind, how­
ever, that goat cheese is quite rich and high in saturated fat. Be sure to enjoy these 
zucchinis in moderation.
Try this yellow tomato sauce as indicated here or atop any favorite vegetable.
Preparation time: 40 minutes
Cooking time: 25 to 30 minutes
Yield: 6 servings
6 medium green zucchini
1 pound chèvre goat cheese (room 
temperature)
1⁄4 cup bread crumbs
Zest of 1 lemon
1⁄4 cup basil chiffonade (see the tip at the end 
of this recipe)
Salt and pepper
1 tablespoon olive oil
	 1	Preheat the oven to 350 degrees. Wash the zucchini and pat dry. Cut the ends off the 
zucchini and then cut each zucchini in half to create 2 pieces of equal length. Use a 
paring knife or melon baller to core out the center of the zucchini.
	 2	Put the goat cheese in a bowl and add the bread crumbs, lemon zest, and basil. Season 
with salt and pepper to taste. Mix well and taste for seasoning. Spoon the cheese mix­
ture into the zucchini shells.

185
 Chapter 11: Adding Veggies to Your Meals
	 3	Drizzle the olive oil on the zucchini, season with salt and pepper to taste, and place on 
a baking sheet. Bake until the cheese begins to bubble and the bread crumbs start to 
brown, about 30 minutes.
	 4	Remove the zucchini from the oven, drizzle the Yellow Tomato Sauce (see the next 
recipe) on top of them, and return to the oven for 1 to 2 minutes.
Tip: Chiffonade literally means “made of rags,” and it pretty well describes what the final 
product looks like. Leafy lettuce or herbs are rolled together tightly and then thinly sliced 
width-wise to form long, stringy strips.
Yellow Tomato Sauce
4 ripened yellow tomatoes (substitute red 
tomatoes if yellow ones aren’t available)
1⁄4 cup minced garlic
2 tablespoons olive oil
Salt and pepper
	 1	Core the tomatoes, blanch in salted water for 10 seconds, and then shock in an ice 
water bath. Take a look at Figure 11-1, earlier in this chapter, to see how this technique 
works. Allow the tomatoes to chill for a few minutes and then remove from the water 
and peel the skin. Cut the tomatoes in half and squeeze out the pulp and seeds.
	 2	Place the tomatoes in a blender, add the garlic, and blend. With the blender on high, 
drizzle in the olive oil until the sauce achieves a smooth, even consistency, approxi­
mately 3 to 5 minutes. Season with salt and pepper to taste.

T Asian Vegetable Stir-Fry
With this stir-fry, be creative and use any vegetables that you like. The health benefits 
here don’t get any better! All these vegetables in combination are rich in countless vita­
min and minerals, notably vitamins A, C, B6, folate, calcium, and potassium. This stir-fry 
from Heather Dismore is prepared with minimal oil, so it remains quite low in total fat 
and calories. It’s also rich in fiber, which makes it great for weight management, heart 
health, and especially blood sugar control. If you like, round out this dish with some 
tofu or chicken to get a bit of lean protein, and serve over a bed of brown rice for some 
more fiber, as well.
Preparation time: 40 minutes
Cooking time: 20 minutes
Yield: 4 servings
2 ounces dehydrated wild mushrooms
1⁄4 cup boiling water
1 tablespoon light soy sauce
2 cloves garlic, minced
11⁄2 teaspoons grated fresh gingerroot
2 tablespoons canola oil
2 cups baby bok choy, sliced in half
1 red bell pepper, seeded and julienned
1⁄2 carrot, thinly sliced on the diagonal
1 cup broccoli florets
1 cup snow peas, trimmed
	 1	Place the mushrooms in a heatproof bowl and cover them with the boiling water. Allow 
them to reconstitute for 30 minutes. Remove the mushrooms from the water. Chop 
them and reserve. Strain the liquid through a coffee filter to remove the grit. Combine 
the mushroom liquid, soy sauce, garlic, and gingerroot. Set aside.
	 2	Heat the oil in a wok or nonstick skillet. Stir-fry the mushrooms, bok choy, red pepper, 
carrots, and broccoli for 3 minutes. Add the soy sauce mixture and snow peas. Reduce 
the heat and continue cooking until the veggies are crisp tender and the sauce thickens.

Moderation is the key when enjoying any fried foods. Many diabetics are 
encouraged to stay away from fried food entirely. In general, it’s good advice 
because so many foods are heavily battered with starchy concoctions that no 
one needs to eat. But on occasion, you can enjoy fried foods that are lightly 
dredged, or lightly coated, in flour, as in the Vegetable Fritto Misto.

187
 Chapter 11: Adding Veggies to Your Meals
	
T Vegetable Fritto Misto
This dish from Cetrella in Half Moon Bay, California (see Appendix A), calls for signifi­
cant amounts of milk and white flour, but not to worry. Because they’re used only to 
coat the vegetables, neither provides a significant amount of calories or carbohydrates. 
The flour and milk help create a thick, crispy coating on the veggies when they’re sau­
téed. Though canola oil is a wonderful source of monounsaturated, heart-healthy fat, 
it’s still very dense in calories, so be thrifty here! When the veggies are finished, drain 
them well on paper towels to get rid of some of the excess oil. You may also want to 
pair these veggies with a light entrée, such as fish or chicken, both low-calorie, lean 
sources of protein.
Preparation time: 30 minutes
Cooking time: 35 minutes
Yield: 4 servings
4 tablespoons canola oil
1⁄2 cup artichoke hearts
1⁄2 head cauliflower, chopped into florets
10 pitted green olives
1 large portobello mushroom, large dice
2 cups lowfat milk
2 cups flour
Salt and pepper
Lemon wedges (optional)
	 1	Heat the oil in a deep skillet until it starts smoking. While you’re waiting for the oil to 
heat, place the artichoke hearts, cauliflower, olives, and mushrooms in the milk in a 
shallow bowl and soak. Place the soaked veggies in a resealable plastic bag with the 
flour. Shake to coat the veggies with flour. Put the floured vegetables into a strainer and 
shake off the excess flour.
	 2	Carefully place the vegetables in batches into the hot oil. Fry for 3 to 5 minutes, or until 
golden brown.
	 3	Remove the vegetables from the oil onto paper towels and season lightly with salt and 
pepper. Place them in a bowl and serve with a wedge or two of lemon, if desired.
Tip: To ensure that your food absorbs the least amount of oil possible, make sure the oil is 
very hot before you begin frying it. This step ensures that your food gets a quick, crispy 
outer coating without getting saturated in oil.

T Asparagus Pizza with Fontina 
	
and Truffle Oil
This pizza dough is made with three different flours — white, whole wheat and rye. 
Tante Marie’s Cooking School in San Francisco developed this plan.
Preparation time: minutes
Cooking time: minutes
Yield: 6 servings
1 package dry active yeast
1⁄2 cup warm water (110 to 115 degrees)
1 to 2 cups white flour
1 cup whole wheat flour
3 tablespoons rye flour
1 teaspoon salt, divided
2⁄3 cup warm water
2 tablespoons olive oil
1 pound fresh asparagus
Cornmeal as needed
1 cup fontina, or Monterey Jack cheese, grated
1⁄4 cup good quality Parmesan, grated
1⁄2 tablespoon white truffle oil
	 1	To make the dough, dissolve the yeast in the 1⁄2 cup water in a small warmed bowl. Stir in 
1⁄2 cup white flour, cover, and let rest for 10 to 15 minutes until bubbles form on the surface.
	 2	 Meanwhile, in a larger bowl, mix 1⁄2 cup of white flour, whole-wheat flour, and rye flour, 
and 11⁄2 teaspoons salt. Make a well in the center and add the yeast mixture and the 
remaining warm water and olive oil. Mix well and knead until the dough is smooth, 
adding more flour if necessary. Place the dough in a lightly oiled bowl and turn over in 
order to coat the top of the dough. Cover and put in a warm place for at least 11⁄2 hours. 
	 3	Bring a medium size pan of water to a boil over high heat, and cut the asparagus into 1⁄4 inch 
slices, discarding the tough stems. Blanch and shock the asparagus. For details on how to 
blanch and shock vegetables, take a look at the section, “Blanching vegetables for optimum 
taste and nutrition,” earlier in this chapter. Set the asparagus aside until ready to use. 
	 4	Place a large baking stone on the bottom shelf of an oven. Preheat the oven to 500 
degrees 30 minutes before baking.
	 5	Punch down the dough and place on a lightly floured wooden board or counter. Cut into 6 equal 
pieces. Cover the dough you are not working with a bowl or a dry towel. With your hands, 
shape one of the pieces of dough into a round disc. Then roll it flatter with a rolling pin. Place 
this on a pizza peel (a large paddle with a long handle used to transfer a raw pizza to the oven) 
covered with 1 tablespoon cornmeal, and stretch into a thin round with your fingers. Make sure 
the pizza dough can slide, and isn’t stuck to the pizza peel. Cover the dough with the fontina 
cheese, then the asparagus, then the Parmesan. Repeat with remaining pieces of dough. 
	 6	Place pizza in the oven and bake for 15 to 20 minutes until it is lightly browned on the 
bottom. Remove from the oven and sprinkle with the truffle oil and serve.
Tip: The pizza dough will remain usable at least all day if kept cool, and more if refriger­
ated after the first rising. If you do refrigerate the dough, allow at least one hour for it to 
come to room temperature.

T Asparagus Bread Pudding Layered 
	
with Fontina
Bread pudding may not seem to be a diabetic friendly meal, but this recipe from Tante 
Marie’s Cooking School in San Francisco is made with whole-grain bread and loaded 
with tasty asparagus. 
Preparation time: 45 minutes 
Cooking time: 60 minutes
Yield: 4 servings
Non-stick cooking spray
6 to 8 thick slices whole-
grain bread, dry
1 1⁄2 to 2 cups nonfat milk
2 pounds asparagus
2 eggs
1 teaspoon salt
2 teaspoons freshly ground 
black pepper
2 tablespoons freshly grated 
Parmesan cheese
1⁄2 cup Fontina cheese, Swiss 
cheese or other white 
cheese, shredded
	 1	Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Spray a 2-quart soufflé dish with non-stick cooking spray; 
set aside.
	 2	Place the bread in a single layer in a shallow dish. Pour 1 1⁄2 cups milk over the bread. 
Let the bread soak until the bread has absorbed the milk and becomes soft, about 30 
minutes. Press the bread slices to extract the milk. Measure the milk; you should be 
able to squeeze 1⁄2 cup milk from the bread. If not, make up the difference with the addi­
tional 1⁄2 cup milk as needed. Set the milk and bread aside.
	 3	Meanwhile, trim the asparagus, removing the woody ends. Cut the remaining stalks on the diag­
onal into thin slivers each about 2 inches long and 3⁄8 of an inch thick. Blanch slivered asparagus 
until barely tender. Shock the blanched asparagus immediately. Drain and set aside.
	 4	In a bowl, beat together the eggs, salt, pepper, and the 1⁄2 cup milk from the bread soak­
ing until well blended. Layer 1⁄3 of the bread in the prepared dish. Set 6 or 8 asparagus 
slivers aside and top the bread layer with half of the remaining asparagus. Spread 1⁄3 of 
each of the cheeses over the asparagus.
	 5	Repeat the layers, using half of the remaining bread, all of the remaining asparagus, and half of 
the remaining cheese. Arrange the remaining bread on top, spread the remaining cheese over 
it, and garnish with the reserved asparagus slivers. Pour the milk-egg mixture over the layers.
	 6	Bake in the preheated oven until the top is golden brown and a knife inserted in the 
middle of the pudding comes out clean, about 45 minutes.

S
eafood is a great protein source, especially 
for diabetics. It has lower saturated fat, cho­
lesterol, and carbohydrates than any other pro­
tein source. Much of it has a mild flavor that takes 
on the flavor of its accompanying ingredients and 
preparation methods, so you can have an almost 
endless variety of flavors and dishes. It cooks up 
quickly, so it can be ready when you are.
In this chapter, we convince you (in case you 
need it) that seafood is an excellent food choice 
to include in a diabetic diet. We give you plenty of 
recipes and fun new ways to prepare all kinds of 
fish dishes. And finally, we give you tips for pre­
paring shellfish.
Identifying Good Reasons 
to Serve Seafood
Like meat and poultry, seafood supplies high-quality protein, balancing the 
fats and carbohydrates in the meal and providing calories that have little 
effect on blood glucose. But the benefits of eating fish extend beyond this:
	
✓	The oceans are a rich reservoir of minerals, and all creatures that live 
in the sea are in part made of these minerals. When you eat fish, you are 
likely also to be consuming iodine, selenium, phosphorus, potassium, 
iron, and calcium.

✓	Eating seafood regularly may help improve kidney function in patients 
with severe diabetes.
	
✓	Seafood is a good source of B vitamins, especially niacin, and also con­
tains fat-soluble vitamin A. In addition, fatty fish are one of the few food 
sources of vitamin D.
	
✓	The most important nutrient in fish may well be the omega-3 fatty acids. 
These polyunsaturated fatty acids are especially high in the fat and oils 
of fish that live in cold water. (Because these oils stay liquid at room 
temperature, they may help insulate the fish against the cold.) The 
omega-3 fatty acids appear to lower the undesirable form of cholesterol, 
LDL cholesterol, and to raise the desirable form, HDL cholesterol. These 
fats also have an anti-inflammatory effect. The fish with the highest per­
centage of these healthy oils are salmon, sardines, tuna, and mackerel.
Healthy Americans are encouraged to eat two seafood servings per week on a 
regular basis.
Preparing Fish in Healthy Ways
You don’t need to deep-fry your catch of the day or order deep-fried fish 
when you eat out in order to get fish that tastes good. Not only is this type of 
fish loaded with fat, but the type of fat is usually unhealthy. When fats heat to 
high temperatures, such as in deep-frying, toxic by-products are formed. It is 
far better to eat seafood prepared by methods such as baking, pan roasting, 
or grilling — all delicious and healthy ways of cooking fish. The following sec­
tions cover a variety of methods you can use to cook fish the healthy way.
Baking your way to fish bliss
Baking is one of the first techniques most people learn when they’re learning 
to cook. In fact, many people don’t “learn” to bake; they simply seem to know 
how to bake. Technically speaking, baking means to cook something by sur­
rounding it with dry heat. In most cases, you bake in an oven, a closed envi­
ronment where you control the temperature.
Baking doesn’t mean boring. Try out this flavorful baked cod to see how 
baking can be both easy and delicious.

Horseradish-Crusted Cod with Lentils
This recipe, from Derek Dickerson, owner of Derek’s Bistro in Pasadena, California (see 
Appendix A), shows that you can develop a great-tasting meal for a person with diabe­
tes. The cod is a lean source of protein and prepared simply by baking, a great lowfat 
cooking technique. The fillets are topped with a touch of horseradish, which lends a ton 
of flavor but very little added fat and calories. The lentils are full of fiber and complex 
carbohydrate, making them a perfect choice. They are combined with crème fraîche, a 
heavy cream with a nutty flavor. This ingredient is included in such a modest amount, 
however, that it contributes very little fat and calories. The lentils, however, are left 
creamy and decadent.
Preparation time: 20 minutes
Cooking time: 30 minutes
Yield: 4 servings
1 pound Puy lentils (or substitute the lentils of 
your choice)
2 sprigs fresh parsley
4 tablespoons crème fraîche (or substitute 3 
tablespoons heavy cream and 1 tablespoon 
sour cream)
1⁄4 cup chopped fresh parsley
Salt and pepper
4 teaspoons horseradish sauce
4 cod fillets, 6 ounces each
4 tablespoons panko bread crumbs (substitute 
crushed cornflakes if you can’t find these 
Japanese bread crumbs in the Asian section 
of your market)
1 teaspoon olive oil
	 1	Preheat the oven to 375 degrees. Place the lentils in a large saucepan with enough cold 
water to cover them, plus an extra couple of inches. Add the whole sprigs of the parsley 
and bring to a boil. Simmer for 25 minutes, or until tender. Discard the parsley sprigs. 
Drain the lentils and toss with the crème fraîche and chopped parsley. Season to taste. 
Set aside and keep warm.
	 2	Spread the horseradish sauce over each fish fillet and then press in the bread crumbs 
to coat. Grease a nonstick baking sheet with the olive oil. Place the fish fillets on the 
baking sheet and bake for 14 to 17 minutes, until the fish is just cooked and the bread 
crumbs are golden.
	 3	Place one-fourth of the lentils on each of four plates. Top each with one piece of baked 
fish.

Poaching to perfection
Poaching is a method of cooking that gently cooks the food in a small amount 
of liquid, just below the boiling point. In the case of seafood, this liquid is 
often highly flavored with herbs, wine, stock, and other seasonings. Give 
poaching a shot with this terrific salmon recipe.
	
Poached King Salmon with 
	
Steamed Asparagus and 
	
Tapenade Salsa
This recipe comes to your kitchen from that of Chef Didier Labbe of the Clementine res­
taurant in San Francisco (see Appendix A). The salmon is poached, which is the lightest 
method of cooking, requiring only water. Adding wine and other herbs to the cooking 
liquid, however, is a great way to infuse good flavor into poached poultry or fish, as this 
recipe calls for. This dish is a wonderful source of omega-3 fatty acids as well as other 
beneficial heart-healthy fats.
Combined with asparagus, the vitamin A content of this dish is off the chart, so eat up 
for eye health! Asparagus also lends a significant source of fiber, some good protein, 
and a bunch of folate. For women of childbearing age, folate is essential for the preven­
tion of birth defects and has even healthier outcomes in diabetic patients as well. For 
everyone else, adequate folate intakes can also lower something called homocysteine, 
high levels of which are linked to heart disease.
By the way, if you don’t have the time or energy to prepare your own fish stock, you 
can find the prepared version at many grocery stores and specialty food stores. Just 
remember, homemade always tastes better and is better for you, too!
Preparation time: 45 minutes
Cooking time: 15 minutes
Yield: 4 servings
Fish Stock (see the following recipe)
1⁄2 pound green asparagus
1⁄2 pound white asparagus (if not available, use 
an additional 1⁄2 pound green asparagus)
4 salmon fillets, 6 ounces each
Tapenade Salsa (see the accompanying 
recipe)
	 1	Prepare the fish stock.
	 2	While the stock is cooking, prepare the asparagus. Add the asparagus to lightly salted, 
boiling water and cook until tender. Immediately remove the asparagus from the boiling 
water and shock it in a cold-water bath. (Check out Chapter 11 for tips on blanching and 
shocking vegetables.)
	 3	Bring prepared fish stock to a gentle simmer over medium heat. Add the salmon fillets 
to the simmering fish stock and cook for 5 minutes. Remove from broth and keep warm.

199
 Chapter 12: Boning Up on Fish Cookery
	 1	In a large sauté pan, add the fish bones to 1 cup of cold water and bring to a simmer.
	 2	Add the onion, leeks, clove, and white wine and return to a simmer; then add the 
remaining 1 cup water and the lemon juice. Continue to cook the bones for an 
additional 30 minutes.
	 3	Strain the broth through a fine mesh strainer. Reserve the broth; discard the bones and 
other solids.
Tip: You can purchase fish bones at fish markets or at specialty food stores that sell fresh 
fish. Alternatively, you can find a fish stock base, like Redi-Base, on the Web at www.
redibase.com/about.htm#redibase. It’s a concentrate version of stock.
Tapenade Salsa
	 4	Prepare the tapenade salsa (see the accompanying recipe).
	 5	Just before serving, reheat the asparagus in the simmering fish stock, approximately 
5 minutes.
	 6	Serve each salmon fillet with the asparagus tips and top with the Tapenade Salsa.
Fish Stock
1 pound fish bones
2 cups water, divided
1 small onion, diced
1⁄2 pound leeks, sliced and well rinsed
1 pinch ground cloves
1⁄4 cup dry white wine
Juice of 1 lemon
2 ounces anchovies
1 cup pitted black olives
2 cloves garlic
1 cup olive oil
2 tablespoons balsamic vinegar
	 1	In a food processor, combine the anchovies, olives, and garlic until the mixture 
becomes a paste, about 45 seconds.
	 2	In a separate bowl, combine the olive oil and vinegar.
	 3	Combine the two mixtures and stir.

Pan roasting seafood sensations
In the strictest culinary terms, pan roasting is a two-step process that first 
sears and seals a thicker piece of meat or chicken in a pan on the stovetop 
and then finishes that piece in the oven, in the same pan you started in. So 
when we’re talking about seafood, the term pan roasting is probably not 

200
Part II: Healthy Recipes That Taste Great 
exactly accurate. Because seafood cooks so fast, there’s usually not a need 
to finish it in the oven. But you can make a terrific sauce in the same pan you 
seared your fish in.
	
Whatever you call it, pan-roasted food is downright good, as these next three 
recipes prove. Use a quality sauté pan that heats evenly. And make sure to 
heat it up well before you place your fish in to ensure an even, quick crust.
	
Tilapia Franchaise
If you’re new to the world of seafood, tilapia is a good place to start. It’s a mild-flavored 
white fish that really takes on the flavors of the food it’s cooked with. This dish is 
simple to make, but very impressive for guests, because you cook the whole thing in a 
single pan. Sear the fish and then create the rich sauce — all without changing pans or 
washing a single dish. What could be simpler?
Preparation time: 10 minutes
Cooking time: 15 minutes
Yield: 2 servings
Nonstick cooking spray
2 pieces (6 ounces each) tilapia (or other flat 
white fish)
1 egg
1⁄2 cup whole-wheat flour
1⁄4 cup white cooking wine
1 tablespoon lemon juice
1⁄2 cup low-salt chicken broth
	 1	Coat a medium skillet with the cooking spray and place over medium heat.
	 2	Rinse and dry the tilapia. In a small bowl, lightly beat the egg. Place the flour in a flat 
plate. Lightly coat both sides of the fish with the flour, coat the fish with the egg, and 
place directly in the hot skillet.
	 3	When the fish is golden brown on the first side (approximately 4 minutes), flip it over to 
brown the other side.
	 4	When the fish is golden brown (roughly after 2 to 3 minutes), reduce the heat to low. 
Add the wine and let it reduce to half the amount. Add the lemon juice and broth and 
let the liquid reduce as it cooks the fish.
	 5	When the liquid has reduced to approximately one quarter and appears to have slightly 
thickened, remove from the heat and serve.
Tip: Serve with fresh vegetables, salad, whole-wheat couscous, or brown rice for some 
extra fiber.

Pan-Roasted Salmon Fillet with 
	
Lemon-Dill Butter Sauce
Lewis Rossman, from Cetrella in Half Moon Bay, California (see Appendix A), offers an 
excellent pan-roasted recipe. The sauce is fantastic, the butter adds the right creami­
ness, the lemon juice provides the perfect acidity, and the pungent dill ties them 
together. Look for baby leeks because they’re more tender and subtle flavored for a 
great addition to the salad. And be sure to check out the instructions for the right way 
to wash and slice leeks in Chapter 8.
Preparation time: 25 minutes
Cooking time: 15 minutes
Yield: 2 servings
1⁄2 cucumber
1 bunch arugula
6 baby leeks, trimmed, cleaned, and blanched 
(or substitute 1 large leek, sliced; check out 
Chapter 8 for details on cleaning and slicing 
leeks)
Salt and pepper
3 tablespoons olive oil, divided
2 salmon fillets (6 ounces each), 1 inch thick
1 tablespoon Meyer lemon juice
3 tablespoons butter
3 sprigs dill, chopped
	 1	Prepare the cucumber salad first. Chop the cucumber into half moons and place in a 
bowl with the arugula and the baby leeks. Season with salt and pepper to taste and 1 
tablespoon of the olive oil.
	 2	To cook the fish, heat a sauté pan with the remaining 2 tablespoons olive oil. Season the 
fish with salt and pepper and, when the pan is hot, add the fillets. Cook for 31⁄2 minutes 
on each side (medium-rare to medium). Place the salad in the center of the plate and 
put the fish on top.
	 3	To make the sauce, wipe clean the same sauté pan and add the lemon juice. Allow the 
juice to reduce by half and add the butter. Swirl the butter vigorously into the lemon 
juice and season with salt and pepper to taste and the chopped dill. Pour over the fish.

A fumet (pronounced foo-MAY) is a heavily concentrated stock. In the case of 
the next recipe, it’s a stock made from shrimp shells. You can make a fumet 
by boiling fish heads, bones, shellfish shells, or whole fish with wine, aro­
matic herbs, and vegetables and then reducing it to concentrate the flavor.

Pan-Roasted Cod with Shrimp 
	
and Mirliton Squash
Here is a wonderful contribution from Chef Kevin Rathbun, of Rathbun’s in Atlanta, 
Georgia (see Appendix A). If you’re keeping in mind blood sugar control and heart 
health, fish is always a great choice — and this recipe makes use of two. The cod and 
shrimp come together well with the squash ragout.
Mirliton squash, also known as chayote squash, is similar to other squash varieties, 
and it makes for a wonderful addition to soups, stews, and casseroles. Look for a small, 
avocado-sized squash with a firm pale green skin. It has a white mild-flavored flesh that 
takes on the subtle flavors of the shrimp fumet very well. Its peak season runs from 
December to March, so if you can’t find it, zucchini works well too. This dish is rich in 
lean protein, low in carbs and saturated fat, and full of vitamins A and C.
Preparation time: 1 hour
Cooking time: 40 minutes
Yield: 4 servings
Fumet:
Shrimp shells, from twenty 26/30 shrimp (from 
shrimp in ragout or purchased at a local fish 
market; see the note at the end of the recipe)
1 shallot, chopped
1 bay leaf
1 thyme sprig
1⁄2 cup Chardonnay
Ragout:
20 white shrimp, 26/30s, peeled and deveined
2 cups 1⁄4-inch cubes of peeled chayote squash 
(also called mirliton), blanched (see Chapter 
11 for blanching instructions)
1 cup peeled, cubed tomato
1⁄2 cup Shrimp Fumet
2 tablespoons butter
2 teaspoons fresh lemon juice
1 teaspoon kosher salt
2 tablespoons parsley (whole leaves)
Cod:
4 cod fillets (6 ounces each)
Salt and pepper
2 teaspoons flour
2 tablespoons olive oil
Use a fumet to season sauces and soups or to braise or poach fish or veg­
etables. Its subtle flavor imparts the delicate essence of seafood with a slight 
acidity (thanks to the wine), but it doesn’t overpower the main event.
	
If you’d rather not make your own fumet, look for fish stock or fish stock glace 
or base (an even more concentrated product that must be reconstituted with 
water before using) at your local fish or gourmet market.

 Chapter 12: Boning Up on Fish Cookery
	 1	Preheat the oven to 350 degrees. Place the shrimp shells, shallot, bay leaf, thyme, char­
donnay, and enough water to cover the ingredients in a small saucepot. Slowly bring to 
a boil and simmer for 15 to 20 minutes to extract some flavor from the shells. After the 
flavor has been extracted, strain the liquid. Discard the shells and other solids and 
reserve the liquid.
	 2	Make the ragout: In a medium saucepan, place the shrimp, squash, tomato, fumet, 
butter, lemon juice, salt, and parsley. Simmer until the shrimp is done, approximately 5 
to 7 minutes, and hold until ready to serve. Adjust seasoning as needed.
	 3	Lightly season the cod fillets with salt and pepper to taste and dust one side with flour.
	 4	Heat the olive oil in a sauté pan and place the cod fillets flour side down in the oil. Sauté 
to a golden brown, approximately 4 minutes, and then turn and transfer to the oven for 
4 to 6 minutes.
	 5	When the cod is finished baking in the oven, place each fillet in a bowl and pour the 
ragout on top.
Note: Shrimp fall into various size categories, and 26/30 means you get 26 to 30 shrimp in 
each pound. For more information, see Chapter 7.

Getting your grill on
Grilling is similar to broiling, but the heat comes from a different direction. 
In grilling, the heat source is under the food. In broiling, the heat source is 
above the food.
Tuna is an excellent fish for grilling. Its meat is firm, not flaky like white fish. 
It stands up nicely to spices and flavorings. And because it’s usually served 
extremely rare, it takes very little time to cook. Try grilled tuna in the follow­
ing recipe.
	
In recent years, there has been a growing concern regarding the methyl mer­
cury content of some fish. Water pollution may increase the level of this metal 
to toxic amounts in certain areas. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration 
(FDA) cautions pregnant and nursing women, as well as women of childbear­
ing age, to limit consumption of swordfish, shark, king mackerel, and tile fish 
to less than 7 ounces per week. These fish are shown to have the greatest mer­
cury levels compared with other fish species. Ahi tuna is generally considered 
to be safe. However, if you’re concerned about the mercury content of fish,

Grilled Ahi Tuna with Asian Slaw
If you’re in the mood for something that’s light yet delicious and satisfying, this dish 
from food writer Heather Dismore is perfect. It’s full of protein yet low in total calories 
and fat. The slaw provides a good source of vegetables, and the dressing helps to round 
out the dish with few added calories.
Fresh tuna is best when prepared very rare in the middle — nearly raw. For this reason, 
be sure to purchase sushi-grade tuna at the fish market. It’s safer, less likely to be con­
taminated, and therefore less likely to cause foodborne illness. Pregnant and nursing 
women should always avoid all raw fish, including rare tuna. Otherwise, be sure to meet 
the American Heart Association’s recommendation to consume 2 servings of fish per 
week.
Preparation time: 30 minutes, plus 2 hours for marinating
Cooking time: 6 to 10 minutes
Yield: 4 servings
4 ahi tuna steaks, about 2 pounds (be sure 
they’re sushi grade)
Marinade:
1⁄4 cup light soy sauce
1⁄4 cup mirin (sweet rice wine)
1 tablespoon toasted sesame oil
2 tablespoons rice wine vinegar
2 tablespoons minced fresh gingerroot
21⁄2 tablespoons minced green onions
3 tablespoons minced garlic
Dressing:
2⁄3 cup rice wine vinegar
1⁄2 tablespoon Splenda (or to taste)
1 teaspoon honey
1 teaspoon light soy sauce
3 tablespoons chopped cilantro
1 teaspoon finely grated gingerroot
1 tablespoon toasted sesame seeds
Slaw:
1 small head napa cabbage, shredded
1⁄2 cup shredded carrot
1⁄4 cup chopped green onion
1⁄4 cup julienned red pepper
1⁄4 cup julienned yellow pepper
1⁄2 cup julienned daikon radish

 Chapter 12: Boning Up on Fish Cookery
	 1	Make the marinade by combining the soy sauce, mirin, sesame oil, vinegar, ginger, 
green onions, and garlic in a resealable plastic bag. Place the ahi steaks in the bag. 
Gently coat the steaks in the marinade. Place in the refrigerator for 2 hours, turning 
occasionally.
	 2	About a half hour before the ahi has finished marinating, prepare the slaw: First mix 
the dressing ingredients (vinegar, Splenda, honey, soy sauce, cilantro, gingerroot, and 
sesame seeds) in a large bowl. In another large bowl, mix the slaw ingredients (cabbage, 
carrots, onion, red and yellow peppers, and radish). Toss the cabbage mixture with 
most of the dressing. Reserve a small amount of dressing for later.
	 3	Let stand for 20 minutes at room temperature. If you’d prefer to refrigerate the slaw, 
extend standing time to 1 hour (and start preparing it about 40 minutes after you start 
marinating the tuna). Preheat the grill.
	 4	Grill the ahi tuna 2 to 3 minutes per side. (Broil about 5 inches from the heating ele­
ment, if you prefer.) The outside should be gray brown; however, the inside will remain 
red. Be sure not to overcook the steaks, as they will quickly dry out and lose flavor.
	 5	Slice the tuna thinly and serve with the slaw. Drizzle the reserved dressing on top.

B.B.Q. Cedar-Planked Salmon
Chef Vitaly Paley of Paley’s Place in Portland, Oregon (see Appendix A), has created a 
sumptuous feast of salmon with this cedar barbecue. You can prepare it in the oven or 
on an outdoor grill. As the planks roast on the fire, the salmon retains the aromas and 
begins to employ the earthy cedar flavor of the wooden planks. Note: You can find 
cedar planks at a lumber store — specifically look for untreated cedar shingles — or in 
kitchen supply stores or gourmet shops that sell lots of knickknacks.
Wild salmon is preferred — it contains more beneficial omega-3 fatty acids and far less 
saturated fat than its farmed counterpart. Salmon is a gift of nature and a gift to your 
health as well. Enjoy this fatty fish and reap its medicinal benefits.
Special tool: 1 cedar plank, 1 to 2 inches larger than salmon fillet all the way around, 
soaked in water for at least 2 hours
Preparation time: 30 minutes, plus optional marinating time of 1 to 2 hours
Cooking time: 20 minutes
Yield: 6 servings
1⁄2 tablespoon salt
1⁄2 cup brown sugar
Zest from 1 orange
1 salmon fillet (2 pounds), pin bone removed 
(ask the person at the seafood counter to do 
this step for you)
5 tablespoons olive oil, divided
6 garlic cloves, finely chopped
1⁄2 cup chiffonade basil (roll the basil together 
tightly and then thinly slice width-wise to form 
long, stringy strips)
1 large onion, peeled and thinly sliced
	 1	Preheat the oven to 450 degrees.
	 2	Mix up the dry marinade. In a small bowl mix the salt, brown sugar, and orange zest and 
spread it generously on both sides of the salmon fillet. (You can marinate the fish 1 to 2 
hours in advance, if you prefer. Refrigerate the fish while it’s marinating if you marinate 
it in advance.)

207
 Chapter 12: Boning Up on Fish Cookery
	 3	Brush one side of the cedar plank with 3 tablespoons of the olive oil and place it in the 
oven for 15 to 20 minutes.
	 4	Spread the garlic on the olive-oil-coated side of the plank and then place the salmon 
fillet on top. Sprinkle the salmon fillet with the basil. Cover the fish generously with the 
sliced onions and then drizzle it with the remaining 2 tablespoons olive oil.
	 5	Place the planked fish in the preheated oven. Cook the salmon for approximately 10 
to 15 minutes, or until the fish is medium-rare and a probe thermometer reads 120 
degrees. The cooking time will vary with the thickness of your fish. Allow approximately 
10 minutes per inch of thickness.
	
	If you prefer to cook the salmon on a grill, follow these instructions: Preheat the grill to 
medium-high heat. Place the oiled plank directly on the grill. Let the plank smoke a bit 
before adding the fish. If the plank catches on fire, spritz it with water. Close the grill 
and cook the salmon for approximately 10 to 15 minutes, or until the fish is medium-
rare and a probe thermometer reads 120 degrees. The cooking time will vary with the 
thickness of your fish. Allow approximately 10 minutes per inch of thickness.

Broiling your seafood bounty
You may find that many recipes call for broiling. Basically, you broil food 
by cooking it using a heat source from above, usually called (you guessed it) 
a broiler. Typically, food is heated for relatively short periods of time at 
a high heat, which usually creates a crispy coating. In most cases, broiling 
is a lowfat cooking technique requiring little additional fat and allowing the 
natural fats present in the food to drip away. All in all, a pretty healthy 
combination!

Broiled Salmon with Herb 
	
Sauce and Cucumbers
As if there weren’t already a bunch of reasons to include salmon in your diet, here’s one 
more. Salmon is a wonderful source of selenium, which happens to be another disease-
fighting antioxidant. Add that to the long list of this seafood’s many health benefits!
This salmon recipe, coming to us from Barbetta Restaurant in New York (see Appendix 
A), is broiled and paired with a sauce flavored with a variety of herbs. Although most 
creamy sauces are usually quite high in fat and calories, this one remains extremely 
light. The recipe takes advantage of lowfat yogurt instead of its full-fat counterpart. You 
can make simple substitutions like this with most dairy products, thus sacrificing a lot 
of fat and calories with barely noticeable change in taste.
Preparation time: 20 minutes
Cooking time: 10 minutes
Yield: 4 servings
1⁄4 cup finely chopped fresh chives
21⁄2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil, divided
1 cup finely chopped fresh parsley, divided
1⁄2 cup finely chopped fresh cilantro
10 ounces plain lowfat yogurt
Juice of 1 lemon
1 medium cucumber, unpeeled, thinly sliced
4 fresh salmon fillets; 6 ounces each
Salt and pepper
	 1	Place an oven-safe grill pan (or broiler pan) in the oven. Preheat the broiler (on low set­
ting if possible).
	 2	Place the chives in a blender with 1 tablespoon of the oil. Blend for approximately 1 
minute, until well combined. Place the chives mixture in a small bowl. Add half of the 
chopped parsley and all of the cilantro, the yogurt, and lemon juice. Set aside.
	 3	Mix the cucumber slices with remaining chopped parsley.
	 4	Prepare 4 dinner plates by spreading the herb sauce in each one. Arrange the cucumber 
slices over the sauce. Put aside.
	 5	Brush the salmon fillets with 1 tablespoon of the olive oil. Sprinkle with salt and pepper 
to taste.

209
 Chapter 12: Boning Up on Fish Cookery
	 6	Remove the grill pan from the oven. Brush it with the remaining olive oil. Place the 
salmon fillets in the heated, oiled pan.
	 7	Place the grill pan under the broiler, about 5 inches from the heating element.
	 8	Cook for 5 to 7 minutes, until the top of the salmon acquires a golden to light brown 
color. Flip the fish to the other side. Allow the fillets to remain in the oven an additional 
2 to 3 minutes.
	 9	Place one salmon fillet in the center of each dinner plate, over the cucumber slices and 
sauce.

Surveying Superior Shellfish
The term shellfish includes seafood such as shrimp, lobster, oysters, clams, 
mussels, and scallops, which all have a shell instead of fins and gills. It also 
includes some seafood that have a not-so-obvious shell, like octopus and 
squid.
Shellfish are sold by their size and weight. For tips on how to pick the right 
shellfish for your recipe, check out Chapter 7.
The texture of these tasty tidbits ranges from exceptionally tender, in the 
case of lobster and some shrimp, to a bit chewy, in the case of octopus. 
It’s probably not a surprise that the tenderness of these delicate creatures 
depends, in part, on how well you cook them.
	
Avoid overcooking shellfish. Doing so causes the texture to become rubbery 
and unpleasant.

Rock Shrimp Ceviche
With this ceviche (pronounced se-VEECH or se-vee-CHEE) dish from Lewis Rossman at 
Cetrella Bistro and Café in Half Moon Bay, California (see Appendix A), you and your 
company are in for a treat. It’s even simple to prepare. Rock shrimp is a sweet shrimp 
with an almost lobsterlike flavor and texture. It’s an extremely succulent shrimp that 
cooks quickly, so it’s a natural choice for this no-heat cooking method. Born out of the 
necessity of using acid to retard food spoilage, ceviche is prepared through a delicious 
and healthy cooking technique. In a nutshell, raw seafood, usually whitefish or shrimp, 
is placed in an acid, most often lime juice, which in essence “cooks” the fish. Leave it to 
marinate for an hour, and it’s ready to serve. Ceviche makes for a great first course, 
especially in the hot summer months, as it is quite light and refreshing and contains 
almost no fat. Enjoy!
Preparation time: 10 minutes, plus marinating time of 1 hour
Yield: 4 servings
1 pound rock shrimp, roughly chopped
1 mango, small dice
1 shallot, finely chopped
1⁄2 cup chopped fresh cilantro
1⁄2 cup fresh lime juice (about 4 limes)
1 pinch chili flakes
Salt and pepper
	
	Place the rock shrimp in a bowl and mix together with the mango, shallot, cilantro, lime 
juice, and chili flakes. Season with salt and pepper to taste and place in the refrigerator 
for 1 hour. The ceviche looks particularly attractive served in a martini glass.
Note: Use only very fresh (or freshly frozen and then very recently thawed) seafood in ceviche 
because it never reaches temperatures high enough to kill strong bacteria.

Seared Diver Scallops with Bacon 
	
and Shallot Reduction
If you’re looking to show off some cooking skills, this scallop dish from Chef Kyle 
Ketchum at Lark in Detroit, Michigan (see Appendix A), is sure to impress. Just a small 
amount of bacon as a condiment helps to achieve some big flavor — even without 

211
 Chapter 12: Boning Up on Fish Cookery
breaking the day’s saturated fat and cholesterol limit. Scallops are great sources of pro­
tein while remaining low in total and saturated fat, so they’re a healthier alternative to 
red meats. Serve this dish atop a bed of whole-wheat couscous to complete the meal.
Diver scallops are sea scallops that are harvested by, well, divers. They can be a bit 
more expensive than standard sea scallops since they’re harvested by people rather 
than by boats dragging chains along the ocean floor, but typically they’re less gritty and 
have a better texture. Plus, they’re more environmentally friendly because divers gener­
ally take only the larger mature scallops, leaving the smaller younger scallops to grow 
for future scallop eaters.
U10 refers to the size of the scallops used in this recipe and means that one pound of 
these scallops contains less than 10 (or Under 10) scallops per pound.
Preparation time: 30 minutes
Cooking time: 30 minutes
Yield: 2 servings
4 slices slab bacon, cut into 1⁄2-inch strips
1 shallot, peeled and thinly sliced
1⁄2 cup low-sodium chicken stock
2 tablespoons butter
1 tablespoon chopped fresh chives
Salt and pepper
6 U10 diver scallops (you can substitute 
1 pound of sea scallops)
2 tablespoons olive oil
12 asparagus stalks (approximately 1⁄4 pound), 
cleaned, trimmed, and blanched (see Chap-
ter 11 for blanching instructions)
1⁄4 cup Balsamic Syrup (see the following 
recipe)
	 1	Add the bacon to a small sauté pan and cook for 2 minutes. Add the shallots and con­
tinue cooking for an additional 3 minutes. Add the chicken stock and butter and bring 
to a simmer until the stock has reduced by half and the onions are tender, approxi­
mately 20 minutes. Add the chives and season to taste with salt and pepper. Set aside.
	 2	Preheat a medium sauté pan over high heat. Season the scallops evenly on both sides 
with salt and pepper. Add the oil to the hot pan and sauté the scallops approximately 
2 minutes per side. Remove the scallops from the pan and place 3 scallops in the center 
of each plate. Reheat the asparagus in the skillet you used to cook the scallops. Put the 
bacon and shallot reduction (from Step 1) around the scallops. Arrange the asparagus 
around the scallops. Drizzle the Balsamic Syrup over the scallops and asparagus.

▶	Understanding poultry basics
▶	Keeping chicken breasts moist and tasty
▶	Utilizing different pieces of the bird
▶	Including turkey in your diet
W
hen you first received your diagnosis of 
diabetes, you may have assumed that 
your culinary life would include nothing more 
than broiled chicken breasts and steamed veg­
etables. Hopefully, if you’ve read any of this book 
at this point, you realize this assumption couldn’t 
be farther from reality.
In this chapter, we show you how to safely use poultry in your diet. We give 
you tips to keep the most popular piece of chicken — the breast — tasty, 
moist, and downright exciting. And finally, we give you some great ways to 
include turkey in your regimen.
Including Poultry in Your Diet
Nutritionists define a portion as 3.5 ounces. What this serving size looks 
like on your dinner plate, with chicken for instance, is typically either a half 
chicken breast or a chicken drumstick and thigh. To reduce the fat content, 
eat the meat but don’t eat the skin.
	
Maintaining good sanitary practices in your kitchen is important when you’re 
working with poultry, no matter how much poultry you’re cooking. Keep the 
following hints in mind to minimize bacterial contamination from poultry:

✓	Rinse any poultry pieces and pat them dry before using them. This step 
helps remove bacteria that are often present in poultry.
	
✓	Don’t place raw poultry near, over, or in any foods that won’t be cooked 
before they’re eaten. Proper cooking kills most bacteria found in poul­
try, but never let the liquid in raw poultry drip onto salads, sauces, con­
diments, and the like.
	
✓	Keep a separate color cutting board only used for raw poultry. You can 
significantly reduce the chances that you cut lettuce on the same board 
you sliced chicken on if they’re different colors.
	
✓	Clean your knife after cutting raw poultry. Wash it thoroughly in hot, 
soapy water.
	
✓	Thoroughly sanitize any surfaces that come into contact with any raw 
poultry or its juices. Use an antibacterial cleaner that’s specifically made 
for this purpose.
	
✓	Always cook poultry to the appropriate food-safe temperature, as listed 
in Table 13-1.

Making the Best of Chicken Breasts
The breast is the leanest of all the chicken’s parts, with the lowest total and 
saturated fat content, thus making it the healthiest choice for your heart.
	
Chicken Breasts with Lemon 
	
and Garlic
This dish, by Christopher Lee from the Eccolo restaurant in Berkeley, California (see 
Appendix A), takes full advantage of a chicken breast’s white, lean meat. Just remember 
to remove the skin after the chicken has cooked.

215
 Chapter 13: Flocking to Poultry
Preparation time: 20 minutes
Cooking time: 25 minutes
Yield: 6 servings
6 chicken breasts, 6 ounces each, bone in, 
with skin
Salt
2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil, divided
30 garlic cloves
4 tablespoons butter
Juice of 2 lemons, divided
1 cup dry white wine
3 cups chicken stock or water
A few thyme sprigs
Zest of 1 lemon, divided
	 1	A few hours before cooking, season the chicken breasts with salt. Refrigerate the 
chicken and bring to room temperature when ready to use.
	 2	In a small sauté pan, heat 1 tablespoon of the olive oil and add the garlic. Cook it over 
medium-low heat, allowing it to brown but not burn. Shake the pan occasionally or stir 
the garlic with a spoon to keep it from burning. Add a little water if the garlic starts to 
brown too much. Cook the garlic until it is soft, about 15 to 20 minutes.
	 3	Once the garlic is soft, in a large Dutch oven over medium heat, heat the remaining 
olive oil and 2 tablespoons of butter and slowly brown the chicken, skin side down, 
until the skin is golden and crisp. Turn the breasts over and reduce the heat to 
medium-low.
	 4	Once you flip the breasts, add the garlic and olive oil sauce to the chicken pan. Add half 
the lemon juice, the white wine, the chicken stock, the thyme, and half the lemon zest. 
Bring the sauce to a simmer and cover. Continue cooking for approximately 5 to 7 min­
utes, or until the breasts are cooked through and tender, but not dried out. Check the 
chicken and sauce occasionally, stirring as needed. If the pan begins to dry, add a little 
water to maintain about a half inch of liquid in the pan.
	 5	When the chicken is cooked and its juices run clear, remove it from the pan to a warm 
serving platter. Keep warm. Increase the heat in the skillet until the sauce begins to 
boil, and then shut off the heat and add the remaining 2 tablespoons butter. Adjust the 
seasonings with salt, pepper, and the remaining lemon juice, if desired. Pour the sauce 
over the chicken.
	 6	Garnish with the remaining lemon zest. Remove the chicken skin before eating.

Chicken Scampi
When we say you can enjoy good food that is good for you, this dish is an example of 
exactly what we mean. Food writer Heather Dismore created this dish that’s delicious 
and lowfat. The total fat and saturated fat content are low simply because you’re using 
skinless chicken breast — the leanest part of the chicken. The recipe calls for some 
butter, but just enough to enrich the flavor without significantly raising the fat content. 
The chicken is full of wonderful flavor from fresh herbs, lemon juice, wine, and a sprin­
kle of Parmesan cheese. The longer you can marinate the chicken, the more flavor it will 
have when done.
Preparation time: 6 to 7 hours (mostly marinating time)
Cooking time: 20 to 30 minutes
Yield: 4 servings
1⁄4 teaspoon pepper
2 cloves garlic, minced, divided
1⁄4 teaspoon salt
2 tablespoons roughly chopped fresh oregano
1⁄4 cup roughly chopped fresh parsley
3 tablespoons lemon juice
1⁄4 cup white wine, divided
5 skinless, boneless chicken breast halves, 4 
ounces each, cut into 1-inch strips
1 tablespoon olive oil
1⁄4 cup chicken stock
1 tablespoon butter
1⁄2 cup Roma tomatoes, diced
Salt and pepper to taste
3 tablespoons grated Parmesan cheese
	 1	Combine the pepper, half the garlic, the salt, oregano, parsley, lemon juice, and half of 
the wine in a resealable plastic bag. Add the chicken. Mix gently to coat the chicken 
with the marinade. Marinate in the refrigerator for several hours (overnight is best).
	 2	When ready to cook the chicken, preheat the broiler, on low if your range has this set­
ting. Remove the chicken from the marinade (save the remaining marinade) and place 
in a shallow pan. Broil 8 inches from the heat, turning once, until the chicken is no 
longer pink inside (about 15 minutes).

217
 Chapter 13: Flocking to Poultry
	 3	While the chicken is broiling, heat the olive oil in a sauté pan. Sauté the remaining 
garlic, until fragrant, but not browned. Add the remaining white wine to the sauté pan 
and scrape to remove any bits on the pan. Add the remaining marinade and chicken 
stock. Bring to a boil. Reduce the sauce by half. Stir in the butter and tomatoes. Season 
with salt and pepper, as needed. Pour the sauce over the chicken. Top with the 
Parmesan cheese.

A paillard (pronounced pie-yarhd) is a fancy French word that basically 
means a cutlet, or a slice of meat that’s been pounded to a thin, even thick­
ness (or thinness depending on your viewpoint). Some people call it a medal­
lion (when they’re small) or scaloppine. This process has two benefits.
	
✓	The meat cooks evenly, because there are no thicker or thinner 
sections.
	
✓	The meat cooks fairly quickly because it’s thin.

Paillard of Chicken Breast with 
	
Fennel and Parmigiano
Laura Maioglio, owner of Barbetta Restaurant in New York City (see Appendix A), has 
provided this wonderful dish, to be enjoyed any time of the year. However, it’s perfect 
for the summer months, because it’s a light dish with fresh ingredients, and can be 
cooked on the barbecue, as well. The fennel and Parmigiano cheese offer two very 
opposing flavors but come together with the chive and sun-dried tomato vinaigrette. 
The ingredients create deep layers of flavor, requiring very little added salt.
Notice that the skin has been removed prior to cooking the chicken. By searing the 
breasts in a hot pan, the juices become locked within the chicken’s crisp coat, keeping 
the breast from drying out.
Preparation time: 30 minutes
Cooking time: 30 minutes
Yield: 4 servings
1 bunch fresh chives
5 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil, divided
Pinch of salt
1 bulb fennel
4 cups baby arugula
4 ounces Parmigiano, sliced paper thin
11⁄4 pounds cherry tomatoes
Salt and pepper
4 full boneless skinless chicken breasts, 
6 ounces each, pounded flat
3 ounces sun-dried tomatoes in olive oil, 
puréed
2 lemons, halved
	 1	Chop the chives. In a blender, blend the chives with 3 tablespoons of olive oil. Add the 
pinch of salt.
	 2	Slice the fennel into paper-thin slices.
	 3	Arrange four dinner plates with baby arugula on one side and fennel slices layered with 
Parmigiano slices over arugula. Halve the cherry tomatoes and place on either side of 
the salad.
	 4	Lightly sprinkle salt and pepper on both sides of the chicken breasts.

219
 Chapter 13: Flocking to Poultry
	 5	Warm the remaining 2 tablespoons of olive oil in a large saucepan. When the pan is very 
hot, place the 4 chicken breasts in the pan. Cook the breasts until they’ve acquired a 
golden color. Flip the breasts over and do the same to the other side. The breasts 
shouldn’t cook more than 2 to 3 minutes on each side. Don’t let the breasts become dry.
	 6	Place 1 chicken breast paillard on each plate next to the salad. Season with salt and 
pepper. With a spoon or squirt bottle, dribble the chive sauce and the tomatoes over 
and around the chicken breast paillards to create a colorful design.
	 7	Dress the salad plate with a drizzle of olive oil and a lemon half.
Tip: Fennel is a terrific herb you may not be familiar with. The thick bulb (sometimes 
called the “head”) has a thick, cabbagelike texture and the rich flavor and aroma of lico­
rice. (You can see what fennel looks like in Chapter 9.) Save the stringy tops, which resem­
ble dill weed, for a fun and unusual garnish.

Marinating chicken for hours or even overnight is a great way to maximize 
flavor and add moisture to chicken breasts. Make up your own marinades 
based on what you’re in the mood for. Here are some ideas to get you 
started.
	
✓	Balsamic vinegar, olive oil, and oregano
	
✓	Light soy sauce, lime juice, minced garlic, and minced ginger
	
✓	Lowfat salad dressing, like Italian or Greek vinaigrette
	
Include an acid of some sort in your marinade to help break down some con­
nective tissue in the meat, making it more tender and helping it to absorb the 
marinade flavor more completely. Good acid choices include citrus juice and 
vinegar. The marinade in the following recipe features lemon juice.

surprisingly simple. Although you want to keep the skin on while cooking the chicken, 
be sure to remove it after you sit down to eat. The skin is full of artery-clogging satu­
rated fat. You won’t even need the skin when you taste the pancetta. Pancetta is essen­
tially Italian bacon, although it has a higher fat content and slightly saltier flavor than 
traditional bacon. For this reason, use it in moderation, as more of a condiment, than a 
main ingredient in dishes. Just a small amount can impart a delicious smoky flavor.
To create the delightful sauce, you need to rehydrate dried mushrooms. Rehydrating is 
easy, but remember: Always strain the liquid used to rehydrate mushrooms before 
adding it to any recipe. Gently pour it through a coffee filter to remove any dirt or grit.
Preparation time: 30 minutes
Cooking time: 50 minutes
Yield: 4 servings
1⁄2 cup dried porcini mushrooms
2 cups warm water, divided
3 sun-dried tomatoes
4 ounces lean pancetta (approximately 8 thin 
slices), diced
2 tablespoons butter
1 medium leek, tough greens removed, rinsed 
well, diced small
4 chicken breasts, skin on, boned and tenders 
removed, about 6 ounces each
Salt and pepper
1 teaspoon finely chopped fresh thyme
4 cups watercress, washed
1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil
1 tablespoon balsamic vinegar
2 cups low-sodium chicken stock

 Chapter 13: Flocking to Poultry
	 1	Place the oven rack in the lower area of the oven. Preheat the oven to 400 degrees. Set 
aside a large roasting pan.
	 2	Place the porcini mushrooms in 1 cup of warm water. Let rest for 15 minutes. Repeat 
the process in a separate cup of water with the sun-dried tomatoes. Strain the porcini 
from the water and reserve the water. Cut the mushrooms into fine juliennes. Strain the 
sun-dried tomatoes from the water and discard the water. Cut the tomatoes into fine 
juliennes.
	 3	Sauté the pancetta in a pan until fat is rendered out, but not browned, 3 to 4 minutes.
	 4	Heat the butter in a small sauté pan over medium heat. When hot, add the leeks and 
cook until lightly browned, about 41⁄2 minutes. Add the mushrooms, tomatoes, and pan­
cetta to the sauté pan.
	 5	To assemble the chicken breasts, pull the skin back and season both sides with salt and 
pepper. Sprinkle with thyme on both sides. Spread about 1⁄2 cup of the mushroom mix­
ture over each chicken breast. Cover with skin. Place in the reserved roasting pan. Top 
the chicken breasts with any additional stuffing mixture that is remaining.
	 6	Place in the oven and roast until browned, approximately 25 to 30 minutes. Transfer the 
chicken to a warm platter.
	 7	Toss the watercress with the olive oil and vinegar.
	 8	Deglaze the pan. Combine the porcini mushroom water and chicken stock in the pan 
used for the chicken. Simmer until reduced to 1⁄3 cup, about 6 to 8 minutes.
	 9	Serve the chicken breasts over the watercress and pour the sauce on top.

Talking Turkey to Liven Up Your Meals
A standard 31⁄2-ounce serving of white meat turkey, without the skin, has only 
a gram of saturated fat, which is even less than the same size serving of a 
chicken breast. Turkey is also a good source of B vitamins and many miner­
als, including iron, potassium, selenium, and zinc, especially in the dark meat.
	
If you buy a whole turkey, you tend to get more meat for your money by 
buying a larger bird. With a small bird, in the 12- to 15-pound range, much of 
what you get is bones, so you may be disappointed with the meager meat that 
results from all your hard work. If you have more leftovers than you can (or 
want to) eat in a couple of days, freeze the extra with a touch of chicken broth 
to help keep it moist.

“Rotisserie”-Roasted Turkey Breast
Rotisserie chicken is available in just about every grocery store in the country. It’s a 
great convenience food, and a relatively healthy one as well. But if you’re watching your 
salt intake, you may not be able to enjoy this tasty food regularly. Heather Dismore cre­
ated this low-sodium version of the perennial favorite with turkey. Roast the turkey up 
out of its own fat (either on a rack or on foil balls) for a true “rotisserie” experience at 
home.
Preparation time: 20 minutes
Cooking time: 2 hours and 15 minutes
Yield: Varies based on weight of turkey, 6-ounce serving size
1 tablespoon olive oil
1 turkey breast, 6 to 7 pounds, with skin
4 tablespoons lemon pepper
1 tablespoon ground sage
	 1	Preheat the oven to 400 degrees. Rub the olive oil into the turkey breast. Place the 
turkey breast in a roasting pan with a rack. (If you don’t have a rack, roll up 6 balls of 
foil and then place under the turkey in the roasting pan to elevate the turkey breast.) To 
get a rotisserie-like final product, you need to make sure the turkey doesn’t sit in any fat 
as it cooks. Set aside.
	 2	In a small bowl, combine the lemon pepper and ground sage. Sprinkle the combined 
seasonings evenly over oiled turkey breast. Place the roasting pan in the oven. Cook for 
45 minutes at 400 degrees. Then reduce the oven temperature to 300 degrees to finish 
cooking, approximately 11⁄2 hours, depending on the size of your bird. Cook the turkey 
until it reaches an internal temperature of 165 degrees with a meat thermometer.
Tip: Use this easy dry rub on any poultry you like. It’s great with chicken, Cornish game 
hens, capons, and game birds.

Classic: Turkey Loaf with 
	
Portobello Sauce
Meatloaf is a homey food that became chic in recent years. You’ll find it served in 
trendy gourmet restaurants, a witty addition to elaborate menus. This recipe is a 
dressed-up version that calls for ground turkey and is topped with fancy portobello 
mushrooms, those meaty giants you can find in the produce section of most supermar­
kets. Have this meatloaf for dinner and then in a sandwich the next day for lunch.
Preparation time: 25 minutes
Cooking time: 60 minutes
Yield: 4 servings
The meatloaf:
Nonstick cooking spray
1 medium onion, minced
1 stalk celery, minced
1 pound lean ground turkey
1⁄4 cup chopped parsley
1⁄4 cup fine bread crumbs
1⁄4 cup skim milk
1 egg white, lightly beaten
1 clove garlic, minced
1 teaspoon dried thyme leaves
1⁄4 teaspoon nutmeg
1⁄4 teaspoon pepper
The sauce:
2 teaspoons unsalted margarine (see the tip at 
the end of the recipe)
1 large portobello mushroom, cleaned and cut 
into small pieces (about 1 cup)
1 cup low-sodium chicken broth
1⁄8 teaspoon ground nutmeg
1⁄8 teaspoon pepper
1⁄8 teaspoon salt

225
 Chapter 13: Flocking to Poultry
	 1	Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.
	 2	For the meatloaf, coat a large skillet with cooking spray and place over medium heat 
until hot. Add the onion and celery. Sauté, stirring often, until translucent, about 5 
minutes.
	 3	Meanwhile, in a large bowl, combine the turkey, parsley, bread crumbs, milk, egg white, 
garlic, thyme, nutmeg, and pepper. Add the onion and celery and mix well.
	 4	Form into a loaf and place in a well-coated loaf pan. Bake 50 minutes or until the inter­
nal temperature is 165 degrees.
	 5	For the sauce, melt the margarine in a saucepan placed over medium heat. Add the 
mushrooms. Sauté, stirring, until tender.
	 6	Remove from the heat. Add the chicken broth, nutmeg, pepper, and salt. Return to heat. 
Cook until fragrant and slightly thickened, 5 minutes.
	 7	When the meatloaf is cooked, unmold, slice, and place portions on warmed dinner 
plates.
	 8	Ladle mushroom sauce over sliced turkey loaf.
Tip: Look for brands of margarine that aren’t made with hydrogenated oils, which contain 
trans fatty acids.
Tip: Ground turkey is a great substitute for ground beef. Choose ground turkey without skin, 
for the greatest savings in the saturated fat department. Use ground turkey anywhere you’d 
use beef, such as pasta sauce, burgers, or casseroles.

In This Chapter
▶	Understanding the secrets of searing
▶	Identifying the basics of braising
▶	Recognizing the benefits of roasting
P
rotein is an ideal food for people with dia­
betes because it contains only minimal 
carbohydrate and, consequently, it doesn’t raise 
blood glucose levels significantly under normal 
circumstances. Every time you eat, you need to 
be sure to include some protein to balance the fat 
and carbohydrate in your diet. Meals that contain 
protein, as well as fat and starch, help stabilize 
blood glucose and can give you a more consistent 
supply of energy.
Your body uses protein to build and repair 
tissues. Meat is an excellent source of protein for 
this purpose because it contains all nine essential amino acids, those that 
must be obtained through diet. Meat is also a source of B vitamins and many 
minerals needed for good health. In particular, it is an excellent source of 
vitamin B12, essential for normal functioning of the nervous system, and iron 
for transporting oxygen to the cells.
In this chapter, we show you three great techniques for cooking meats to fit 
in with a diabetic diet: searing, braising, and roasting. We give you great reci­
pes for each technique and other tips along the way.
	
Always cook meats to a safe temperature for appropriate degree of doneness.

Searing Meats for Culinary Success
A cooking technique called searing is particularly helpful for keeping meat 
as lowfat and delicious as possible. Searing subjects meat to extremely high 
heat on the stovetop for a short period of time. Usually you sear one side and 
then the other. The technique produces a beautifully caramelized skin on the 
meat and essentially seals in its juices. This process helps to retain the mois­
ture content of the meat and therefore much of the flavor.
	
Veal tenderloin is a healthy option compared with many other cuts of meat 
that can be quite high in saturated fat and cholesterol. Because it’s naturally 
low in fat, cook veal quickly at high temperatures to keep as many of the natu­
ral juices as possible. Searing veal is a great choice.

Veal Tenderloin with Chanterelle 
	
Mushrooms in a Muscat Veal 
	
Reduction Sauce
A medallion is a small, coin-shaped piece of meat. Medallions are very thin, so once you 
sear them, you don’t need to finish them in the oven. With just a short searing time, 
you’ll create perfectly tender slices of veal. Serve this terrific recipe, from Baricelli Inn 
in Cleveland (see Appendix A), with cavatelli pasta and the Haricot Vert from Chapter 11, 
also contributed by the Baricelli Inn.
Preparation time: 15 minutes
Cooking time: 15 minutes
Yield: 4 servings
1 tablespoon cracked black pepper (plus more 
to taste)
4 veal tenderloin medallions, approximately 6 
ounces each (silver skin removed), pounded 
thin (check out Chapter 13 for details on 
pounding meat into cutlets)
1⁄2 cup flour
2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil
4 ounces wild mushrooms (chanterelle if 
available)
2 ounces Muscat wine
Salt to taste
6 ounces veal reduction sauce (reduced veal 
stock, also known as demi-glace)
	 1	Press 1⁄2 teaspoon black pepper into each veal medallion and dredge in the flour.
	 2	Heat a medium sauté pan over high heat. Add olive oil; sear the medallions on both 
sides (about 4 minutes on each side). Remove the medallions and set aside.
	 3	To the same sauté pan, add the mushrooms, Muscat, salt, remaining 1 teaspoon pepper, 
and veal stock and cook for 2 minutes over high heat. Adjust salt and pepper to taste. 
Pour the mixture over the veal slices.
Tip: If you can’t find veal reduction sauce in your grocery store, check online or at 
Williams-Sonoma.

If you sear a thicker piece of meat like a chop or even a roast, quickly sear 
the outside and then finish the meat in the oven. Searing seals in the natural 
juices, and roasting finishes the cooking process to desired perfection. Check 
out Table 14-1, earlier in this chapter, for tips on choosing the right tempera­
ture for your taste and your cut of meat.

Pan-Roasted Veal Chops with 
	
Corn and Gouda Ragout
Chef Kevin Rathbun of Rathbun’s in Atlanta (see Appendix A) offers another dish burst­
ing with flavor that won’t break the day’s calorie bank. The original recipe contains a bit 
more salt than we can recommend, so we made some minor modifications. But don’t 
worry. You won’t miss a thing — the dish remains full of other herbs and ingredients 
that offer intense flavors and great taste.
A ragout (pronounced ra-goo) is a thick, flavorful stewlike concoction that usually fea­
tures meat and sometimes features vegetables. In this recipe, pan-roasted corn is 
paired with creamy Gouda cheese. It’s great with the delicate veal medallions.
Preparation time: 1 hour and 15 minutes
Cooking time: 45 minutes
Yield: 4 servings
Steak seasoning:
1 teaspoon kosher salt
1 tablespoon cracked black pepper
1 tablespoon minced garlic
1 tablespoon chopped fresh sage
Corn ragout:
2 cups yellow corn kernels, fresh or frozen
1⁄2 tablespoon minced garlic
1 cup milk
1 tablespoon chopped scallions
1⁄2 teaspoon pepper
Salt and pepper
1⁄4 cup grated Gouda cheese
Veal chops:
4 veal chops, 7 ounces each
2 tablespoons steak seasoning (see Step 1)
2 tablespoons olive oil
	 1	To prepare the steak seasoning, preheat the oven to 250 degrees. Place the salt, pepper, 
garlic, and sage into a food processor and process 15 seconds. Transfer to an oven-safe 
dish and place in the oven for 30 minutes. After the garlic dries out, transfer back to the 
food processor and process 15 seconds. Set the seasoning aside. Increase the oven tem­
perature to 400 degrees.

231
 Chapter 14: Creating Balanced Meals with Meats
	 2	To make the ragout: Heat a cast-iron skillet over high heat, at least 5 to 6 minutes. Add 
the corn and continue to cook until it becomes charred, approximately 8 to 10 minutes. 
Add the garlic, milk, scallions, and pepper. Cook for 2 minutes. Salt and pepper to taste. 
Reserve.
	 3	Heat a large ovenproof sauté pan over high heat. Season the veal chops with the pre­
pared steak seasoning. Add the olive oil to the heated skillet. Sear the chops in the olive 
oil until golden brown on both sides, approximately 4 minutes per side. Transfer to the 
400-degree oven and roast until desired doneness. Check out Table 14-1 to find the right 
temperature for you and test your chops with a meat thermometer.
	 4	When ready to serve, place the corn ragout on plates and sprinkle the Gouda cheese 
over the corn. Place the veal chops on top of the corn and serve.

Understanding the Basics of Braising
Braising is a terrific cooking method for meats, vegetables, and anything else 
you want to make tender and tasty. Basically, braising involves cooking a cut 
of meat in a small amount of liquid. The meat gently cooks and steams, or 
braises, at the same time. Braising is particularly effective for less expensive 
cuts of meat, because you cook it slowly and break down the tougher muscle 
over time.
Braising is also a great cooking method because it requires very little use of 
added fats, such as butter and oil. You can braise foods either in the oven or 
in a pot on the stove. Try it out with the following great recipe.

Beer-Braised Pork and Crisp-Herb 
	
Cabbage with Apple-Tarragon 
	
Dipping Sauce
Chef Tom Wolfe, from Peristyle in New Orleans (see Appendix A), has developed this 
diabetic-friendly dish (shown in the color section). Pork comes from a pig, so it must be 
high in fat, right? Well actually, that’s only half true. In recent years, pork has gained 
attention as “the other white meat.” As it turns out, the fat content of pork depends on 
the cut of the meat. The rump and rib roast, for example, are much higher in fat and 
cholesterol than the pork tenderloin, boneless sirloin chops, or boneless loin roasts. In 
this dish, try to use a lean cut of pork, such as the tenderloin, which is a naturally 
tender cut of meat and will remain moist from the slow-cook method of braising.
Preparation time: 1 hour and 45 minutes
Cooking time: 1 hour
Yield: 6 servings
1⁄4 teaspoon kosher salt
1⁄4 tablespoon black pepper
4 tablespoons low-sodium soy sauce
2 tablespoons minced shallots
1 tablespoon chopped garlic
1 tablespoon Dijon mustard
1 tablespoon melted butter
21⁄4 cups amber beer
21⁄2 tablespoons canola oil
1 pound pork tenderloin sliced into 12 1-inch 
medallions
1 red pepper, julienned
	 1	Combine the kosher salt, pepper, soy sauce, shallots, garlic, mustard, butter, and beer. 
Marinate the pork in this mixture in a resealable plastic bag in the refrigerator for 30 to 
60 minutes prior to cooking.
	 2	Heat the oil in a medium-hot large sauté pan. Add the pork medallions, reserving the 
marinade, and cook until golden brown, about 3 to 4 minutes on each side.
	 3	Reduce the heat to medium-low and add the reserved marinade and the red pepper. 
Simmer on low, uncovered, for 25 to 30 minutes. Sauce should be reduced by one-half.
	 4	To serve, place the cabbage (see the next recipe) on a warm plate. Place 2 pork medal­
lions next to the mound of cabbage. Pour the dipping sauce (see the accompanying 
recipe) into a ramekin and place it next to the pork and cabbage.

Recommending Roasting
	
Roasting is a simple technique that requires little effort. Season meat with 
herbs and spices and cook it in the oven until it reaches a desired degree of 
doneness. You just need to ensure that the meat doesn’t dry out, a possibility 
with this dry-heat method of cooking. Here are some suggestions:
	
✓	Slow-roast meat at a low temperature, 350 degrees and below.
	
✓	Wrap meat in foil for most of the cooking time and remove only for the 
last half hour of cooking — to allow the meat to brown.
	
✓	Cook roasts with the bone still attached, when possible, because the 
meat cooks faster and has more flavor that way.
Try roasting lamb with the next recipe. Leave the bones on the chops for 
quicker cooking and a beautiful presentation.
	
Roasted Lamb Sirloin with 
	
Herbes de Provence, Spinach, and 
	
Onion Ragout with Lamb Au Jus
Herbes de Provence is simply a mix of herbs commonly used in southern French cook­
ing. They happen to go wonderfully well with this lamb dish, by Chef Didier Labbe from 
the Clementine restaurant in San Francisco (see Appendix A). Lamb is typically one of 
those meats with more fat, so do your best to choose a leaner cut, like the sirloin. 
Choose cuts with the least amount of white marbling, (or fat) within the meat and, as 
with all meat dishes, remember to trim excess fat whenever possible!
The ragout contributes a wonderful flavor to the lamb and spinach, and the only ingre­
dient is onion! Be creative with your blender — you can make many wonderful, flavorful 
sauces and spreads by using just a single fruit or vegetable.
Preparation time: 45 minutes
Cooking time: 1 hour
Yield: 4 servings
4 lamb sirloin chops, 6 ounces each
2 tablespoons Dijon mustard
1⁄4 cup herbes de Provence
Salt and pepper
2 tablespoons olive oil, divided
3 white onions, sliced
2 cups water
1 bunch spinach
1⁄2 cup port wine
1 tablespoon chopped garlic
2 tablespoons butter

235
 Chapter 14: Creating Balanced Meals with Meats
	 1	Preheat the oven to 400 degrees.
	 2	Place the lamb sirloin chops in a roasting pan. Spread the Dijon mustard evenly over 
the lamb chops. Sprinkle on herbes de Provence and lightly salt and pepper. Drizzle 
lightly with 1 tablespoon of the olive oil and roast 15 minutes. Reduce the heat to 325 
degrees and continue roasting until the chops are medium rare (light pink inside), or 
when a meat thermometer inserted in the center of a chop reaches 145 degrees.
	 3	While the chops are cooking, combine the onions and water in a large sauté pan or 
3-quart saucepan. Cover and simmer until the onions become soft. Remove the onions 
from the pan and process them in a food processor until they’re smooth.
	 4	In the same sauté pan, heat the remaining olive oil. Add the spinach. Cover and cook 
the spinach for about 3 to 4 minutes. Fold the onion purée into the spinach, season it 
lightly with salt and pepper, and set it aside, but keep warm.
	 5	Remove the chops from the roasting pan to another dish and cover them with foil to 
keep them warm.
	 6	Place the baking pan on the stove. On low heat, deglaze the pan by adding the port 
wine, garlic, and butter. Reduce the mixture by one-fourth.
	 7	To serve, place the spinach mixture in the middle of each plate. Place one lamb chop on 
top of the spinach and pour the port wine sauce over it.

Keeping Healthy Snacks at the Ready
Many people grab whatever they can find for a quick snack because they’re 
incredibly hungry. It’s easy to reach for a bag of chips, a candy bar, or a soda 
if they’re handy. Instead of keeping these convenient, high-fat, high-sodium, 
high-sugar foods handy, stock your fridge, freezer, and pantry with healthy 
snacks that can satisfy you and keep you eating on your plan. For example, 
you can make snack-size servings of cut-up fresh veggies, ready and waiting 
in the fridge.
	
For a special beverage treat, keep some sugar-free drink mix single-serving 
tubes handy. Just add their contents to your water bottle for an instant treat.
Mixing it up with whole grains

Filling your freezer with treats
Some people just can’t seem to stay away from the snacks after dinner, espe­
cially the sweet ones. Maybe you just want something simple like a bowl of 
ice cream or a more elegant chocolate mousse or cheesecake. Instead, con­
sider stocking your freezer with the following healthy, quick-grab snacks.
	
✓	Flavored ice cubes: Fill ice cube trays with your favorite sugar-free 
drinks, like any flavor of Crystal Light. Freeze until frozen and then 
transfer the individual ice cubes to a resealable plastic bag. Add a few 
lemonade ice cubes to your next glass of strawberry kiwi beverage. 
Experiment with flavors you like.
	
✓	Grapes: Clean the grapes and remove them from their stems. Place indi­
vidual grapes on a clean baking sheet in the freezer. When the grapes 
are frozen, transfer them to a resealable plastic bag. Grab a few when 
your sweet tooth attacks.
	
✓	Sugar-free frozen pops: Many manufacturers are making freezer pops 
from 100 percent juice or sweetening them with sugar substitutes.
	
✓	Yogurt tubes: Squeezable yogurt tubes can make a terrific quick snack. 
Toss a few in the freezer for an extra creamy frozen treat.
	
	This type of yogurt can have added sugar, so read your labels carefully 
to make sure you know what you’re eating, and confirm that it fits with 
your eating goals.
Why should you choose whole-grain snacks?
If you can have 6 saltines or 4 whole-wheat 
crackers and you’re really hungry, which 
should you choose? At first glance, the answer 
may seem obvious. Choose the saltines 
because you get 6 (compared to the 4 whole 
wheat crackers). But believe it or not, 4 whole-
wheat crackers will keep you fuller, longer. The 
whole grain is the key. Your body works harder 
and longer to digest the whole-wheat crackers. 
With saltine crackers, the flour manufacturer 
has done much of the work for you by refining 
the flour, removing most of the fiber and nutri­
ents. By making your body work for its nutrition, 
you help it work more efficiently, in turn helping 
you to stabilize your blood glucose levels. For 
more about adding grains to your diet, check 
out Chapter 10.

Adding Dips and Sauces to Snacks
Condiments are typically used to flavor or complement other foods. But 
some condiments are so delicious and craveable that you may want to eat 
them all by themselves. Condiment may be a bit of an understatement for 
the tasty recipes in this section. They can both be terrific spreads for sand­
wiches or lettuce wraps. Use them as sauces to top grilled chicken or firm 
fish.
Dips are a creative way to get in lots of vegetables. Unfortunately, most dips 
tend to be very high in calories and fat. What is considered a light snack can 
quickly turn into a full meal’s worth of calories and fat. So skip the fat and 
keep the flavor with this excellent vegetable dip. (Check out Chapter 7 for 
more dips to try.)
Choosing kid-friendly snacks
Many children are afflicted by diabetes. Often, 
their parents and other caregivers need to learn 
about the disease from scratch. Check out 
Chapter 22 for more tips on helping kids cope 
with diabetes. Also, check out Diabetes For 
Dummies, 2nd edition, written by Alan Rubin, 
MD, and published by Wiley, for more great 
kid-friendly tips.
Here’s a list of snacks designed with diabetic 
kids in mind. Teach kids how to snack well early 
in life, and they’ll be better equipped to deal 
with diabetes as they grow.
	✓	Snack-sized bag of light microwave 
popcorn
	✓	Whole-wheat pretzels with mustard
	✓	Cup of lowfat yogurt
	✓	Sugar-free gelatin cup
	✓	Lunchmeat rollup
	✓	An apple with a small dollop of peanut 
butter
	✓	Celery sticks dipped in lowfat ranch 
dressing
	✓	Turkey hot dog
	✓	 1⁄2 cup cottage cheese
	✓	1 ounce part-skim string cheese
	✓	 1⁄4 cup roasted peanuts

T Roasted Veggie Dip
This dip from Heather Dismore is an excellent appetizer, food topper, condiment, or 
omelet filling — you name it, it can work. The roasting of the vegetables brings out their 
natural sugars, and the spices give it a kick. Snack on this no-fat dip with whole-wheat 
crackers or check out our list of approved dippers in Chapter 7.
Preparation time: 20 minutes
Cooking time: 35 minutes
Yield: 6 servings
1⁄2 eggplant, peeled, thick sliced
1 zucchini, thick sliced
1 yellow squash, thick sliced
1⁄2 red onion, thick sliced
4 cloves garlic, roughly chopped
Nonstick cooking spray
1⁄2 teaspoon cayenne pepper
1 teaspoon seasoning salt
1 teaspoon chili powder
Salt and pepper
	 1	Preheat the oven to 400 degrees. Spray the eggplant, zucchini, squash, onion, and garlic 
with the cooking spray, coating well.
	 2	In a small bowl, combine the cayenne pepper, seasoning salt, and chili powder. Add 
one-fourth of the seasoning to the vegetables. Toss well to combine. Add another one-
fourth of the seasoning and toss well. Repeat until the vegetables are evenly coated and 
all the seasoning is added. Adding the seasonings in stages helps combine the season­
ings evenly.
	 3	Spray a baking pan with the cooking spray. Add the vegetables in a single layer. Cook 
vegetables in the oven, until browned, stirring occasionally, roughly 35 minutes.
	 4	Place the roasted veggies in the bowl of a food processor. Process to desired consis­
tency. Season with salt and pepper as necessary.

T Wolfe’s BBQ Sauce
Chef Tom Wolfe, from Peristyle in New Orleans (see Appendix A), has let you in on the 
secret of his famous barbecue sauce — and it is good! You might have perused the 
nutrition labels of some of your favorite sauces before and noticed just how high the 
sugar content can really be. A great substitution that Chef Tom made here was to use 
sugar-free syrup instead of the usual version, which, you may have guessed, is entirely 
sugar. This is a good reminder to make substitutions like this whenever you can. Save 
your blood sugars without sacrificing your favorite foods. This sauce (in the color sec­
tion) is approved for dipping grilled chicken and veggies, slathering on a hunk of firm 
fish, or topping a pita for an impromptu barbecue chicken pizza. But definitely try it 
with the Barbecue Chicken Potato Hash in Chapter 13.
Preparation time: 10 minutes
Cooking time: 15 minutes
Yield: 8 servings
11⁄2 cups ketchup
1 cup light pancake syrup
11⁄2 tablespoons low-sodium soy sauce
11⁄2 tablespoons Worcestershire sauce
3⁄4 tablespoon sesame oil
1 teaspoon minced ginger
1 teaspoon chili powder
1 teaspoon onion powder
1 teaspoon fresh chopped garlic
1 teaspoon pepper
1⁄2 teaspoon salt
	
	Place all ingredients in a nonmetallic saucepan on low. Warm the sauce for 10 minutes, 
stirring occasionally. For thicker sauce, continue to cook for 2 to 3 more minutes. 
Remove from the heat and cool.

Preparing Mini-Meals
Eating small portions of well-balanced meals can be a great way to fit a nutri­
tious and filling snack into your day. Maybe you ate a light brunch and are 
waiting for a late dinner. Maybe you had a really early breakfast and can’t fit a 
full lunch in until late in the day. Or maybe you just find it easier to maintain 
even blood sugar levels by eating five or six small meals each day. Whatever 
the reason, mini-meals can help you eat right.

Choosing chicken
For diabetics, chicken is a great basis for a mini-meal because it provides 
protein that is slowly changed to sugar in your body. Try the following two 
recipes to enjoy a taste of chicken.
Nonstick cooking spray
2 boneless, skinless chicken breasts, 4 ounces 
each, pounded thin
1 tablespoon lemon juice
1 teaspoon oregano, crushed and dried
2 thin slices Vidalia onion
2 whole-wheat tortillas, 10-inch variety
1⁄4 cup lowfat plain yogurt
1⁄4 cup peeled, seeded, and chopped cucumber
1⁄4 cup crumbled feta cheese
1 teaspoon chopped fresh mint
	 1	Preheat the oven to 350 degrees. Coat an 8 x 8 inch baking dish with nonstick cooking 
spray. Brush the chicken breast on both sides with lemon juice and oregano. Place the 
chicken breast and onion in the baking dish. Bake for approximately 25 minutes.
	 2	When the chicken is done, transfer to a cutting board and cut into 1⁄2-inch strips.
	 3	Spread out the tortillas on a flat surface. Spread equal parts of yogurt on top of the tor­
tillas. Top with equal parts chicken, onion, cucumber, cheese, and mint.
	 4	Roll up the wraps and serve warm.

Greek-Style Chicken Wraps
These wraps are quick and easy. They might remind you of a Greek gyro sandwich, but 
they’re lower in fat because we use boneless skinless chicken breast in our version. 
Experiment with different herbs, like basil, and cheeses, like feta, to find the flavor com­
binations you like. Also, keep this chicken ready and in the freezer for emergency 
snacking. It’s great to toss with salad greens, chop into a quick casserole, or make these 
wraps in minutes.

Quick Chicken Tostadas
Mexican food is often considered to be pretty high in fat and cholesterol, but it doesn’t 
have to be. In fact, common ingredients in Mexican cooking, such as beans, chicken, 
olives, and tomatoes, are very healthy. Not so good, on the other hand, are fried torti­
llas, extra cheese, and high-fat sour cream. If you have a craving for nachos or quesadil­
las, traditionally very high in calories and saturated fat, try these light tostadas instead, 
courtesy of Heather Dismore. They’re full of flavor and incorporate traditional Mexican 
ingredients but have half the calories and fat. When preparing tacos or other Mexican-
style dishes at home, be sparing with the toppings (cheese, sour cream, and guaca­
mole), which contribute the most significant amount of calories and fat.
Preparation time: 20 minutes
Cooking time: 10 minutes
Yield: 6 servings
6 whole-wheat flour tortillas
Nonstick cooking spray
3⁄4 pound cooked chicken (see the tip at the 
end of the recipe)
3⁄4 cup salsa
1⁄4 teaspoon cayenne pepper
1⁄4 teaspoon chili powder
1 cup diced red pepper
Salt and pepper
1 cup shredded cheddar cheese
1 tablespoon minced cilantro or green onions 
(optional)
2 tablespoons minced black olives (optional)
6 tablespoons lowfat sour cream (optional)
3 tablespoons prepared guacamole (optional)
	 1	Preheat the oven to 400 degrees. Spray each tortilla lightly with cooking spray. Place 
prepared tortillas on a baking sheet and place in the oven. Toast the tortillas until crisp, 
approximately 2 to 3 minutes. Remove from the oven and set aside. Reduce the oven 
temperature to 375 degrees.
	 2	Mix the chicken, salsa, cayenne pepper, chili powder, red pepper, and salt and pepper to 
taste together in a mixing bowl. Top each tostada with one-sixth of the chicken mixture.
	 3	For each tostada, top the chicken mixture with one-sixth of the cheddar cheese. Return 
the tostadas to the oven. Cook until the chicken is heated through and the cheese is 
melted, approximately 5 to 7 minutes.
	 4	If desired, top each tostada with 1⁄2 teaspoon cilantro or green onions, 1 tablespoon sour 
cream, and 1 teaspoon black olives.
Tip: For this recipe, you can purchase roasted chicken breast, or you can cook the chicken 
breast yourself by poaching it, which means cooking it in water just below the boiling point 
until it is cooked through (no longer pink inside).

Selecting seafood
Seafood, tuna in particular, is a great item for a diabetic to choose as a mini-
meal because, like chicken, it’s mostly protein and does not raise your sugar 
rapidly. The following dish is easy to reduce to a snack size portion: Eat only 
one skewer full of tasty goodness, and you cut the kilocalories (and the other 
nutritional analysis) in half. Enjoy!
	
Tuna Dijon Brochettes
Tuna isn’t just for salad anymore. Fresh tuna has a beautiful ruby red color, a firm tex­
ture, and a meaty flavor. It goes well with spicy sauces and spices, like Dijon mustard. 
With sweet pineapple and mild veggies, you get a full flavor experience.
Special tools: 2 metal skewers, 8 inches long
Preparation time: 25 minutes
Cooking time: 6 to 8 minutes
Yield: 1 serving
8 ounces tuna, fresh, cut into 6 equal chunks
1 tablespoon Dijon mustard
4 mushrooms
4 squares red pepper, 1 inch each
4 slices zucchini, 1⁄4-inch thick
4 chunks fresh, peeled pineapple, 1 inch each
4 medium cherry tomatoes
Salt and pepper
Nonstick cooking spray
	 1	Preheat the broiler. In a bowl, coat the tuna chunks with the mustard.
	 2	Skewer the tuna, mushrooms, peppers, zucchini, pineapple, and cherry tomatoes, alter­
nating each item twice, beginning and ending with a tuna chunk.
	 3	Sprinkle each skewer with salt and pepper to taste. Coat a baking sheet with the cook­
ing spray and place the skewers on the baking sheet. Broil for 6 to 8 minutes.

Picking pasta
Indulge in your cravings for Italian food with this version of the traditional 
potato pasta, gnocchi. Potatoes, or pasta for that matter, may be tough to 
work into your eating plan, but if you love Italian food, you don’t have to give 
it up completely. In addition to this great flour-free option, check out zucchini 
and cucumber linguine with clams found in Chapter 11. You get all the Italian 
flavor without any traditional pasta and the costly carbs.
Stocking your snack drawer at work
Getting through the workday and avoiding food 
pitfalls can be challenging for anyone, par­
ticularly so for the diabetic. The best defense 
against the shared snacks of coffeecakes, 
muffins, bagels, and doughnuts near the coffee 
station is a good offense. Keep a healthy snack 
drawer at work for snacking emergencies, and 
you’re sure to save yourself some calories and 
blood sugar spikes and dips. And remember: A 
well-stocked snack drawer can be a lifesaver 
on early days when you don’t have time to eat 
breakfast before heading for work.
Here are some ideas for a diabetic’s snack 
drawer:
	✓	Light popcorn in snack-sized microwave­
able bags
	✓	Individual servings of nuts
	✓	Lowfat and low-sodium canned soups
	✓	Fat-free, sugar-free gelatin and pudding
	✓	Low-sugar protein bars
	✓	Canned nutritional supplement drinks, like 
Glucerna or Ensure
	✓	Individual servings of sugar-free drink 
mixes
	✓	Individual cans of low-sodium vegetable 
juice
	✓	No-sugar-added juice boxes or bottles
When possible, choose individual serving sizes. 
They’re proportioned to take the brainwork out 
of grabbing a quick snack when you’re starved. 
Plus, keeping track of how much you eat is 
much easier when the nutritional information is 
on each snack.

T Spinach-Ricotta Gnocchi
Here’s a great twist on the traditional gnocchi, or potato pasta. Chef Christopher 
Fernandez at Poggio in Sausalito, California (see Appendix A), has creatively substituted 
the white flour base to this usually high-carbohydrate food for ricotta cheese, a signifi­
cant source of protein. In doing so, the gnocchi will have far less of an effect on your 
blood sugars and allow you to once again eat what you might have once considered 
sinful! Enjoy this with your favorite red Italian pasta sauce.
Special tools: Cheesecloth, pastry bag
Preparation time: 1 hour
Cooking time: 4 to 5 minutes
Yield: 4 servings
1⁄2 pound part-skim ricotta cheese
1 gallon water
1⁄4 pound fresh spinach
1 cup grated Parmesan cheese
1 egg, beaten
Pinch ground nutmeg
Salt to taste
2 tablespoons potato starch
1 tablespoon dehydrated potato flakes
2 tablespoons plus 2 cups flour
	 1	Place the ricotta in a strainer lined with cheesecloth and let sit overnight in the refriger­
ator to remove excess liquid.
	 2	Bring the 1 gallon of water to a boil, add the spinach, and boil for 30 seconds. Strain the 
spinach and place the spinach on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper. Place the 
spinach in the refrigerator to cool. Once cooled, squeeze out all the excess water from 
the spinach. Chop the spinach as fine as you can on a cutting board. This may take 
some time, but the finer the better.
	 3	To make the gnocchi, place the chopped spinach, ricotta, Parmesan cheese, egg, 
nutmeg, and a pinch of salt into a large mixing bowl. Mix until the spinach has been 
evenly distributed, and add the potato starch, dehydrated potato, and 2 tablespoons of 
the flour to bind the mixture. Bring a small pot of water to a boil and drop a spoon-sized 
piece of gnocchi to test the consistency and flavor. If the gnocchi is too wet and falls 
apart, add another egg and some flour. The key to this gnocchi is to add the minimum 
amount of binder so that the gnocchi are as light as possible.
	 4	Place a 6-quart pot on the stove with plenty of salted water to boil the gnocchi. Bring 
the water to a boil and turn down until you’re ready to cook the gnocchi.

249
 Chapter 15: Having a Little Bite with Snacks
	 5	Place the remaining 2 cups of flour in a long baking pan. Shake the flour evenly around 
in the pan. Place the gnocchi mixture into a pastry bag with a large straight tip about 1⁄2 
inch in diameter. Pipe the gnocchi mixture in a long line directly into the flour, as if you 
were making a long snakelike piece. You can make a couple of lines like this in the flour.
	 6	With a knife, cut the snakelike pieces into 1-inch pieces. With your hands, gently cover 
the gnocchi lightly with flour, shake off any excess flour, and place directly into boiling 
salt water. Cook the gnocchi for at least 5 minutes or until they float for 2 minutes. 
Remove from the water.
Tip: You can serve these immediately or hold them for later use. If you plan to hold the 
gnocchi, place the cooked gnocchi onto a lightly oiled sheet pan and place in the refrigera­
tor. Once cooled, you can place the gnocchi in an airtight container until ready to use. You 
can reheat the gnocchi in boiling water for 4 to 5 minutes.

In This Chapter
▶	Filling out your meal plans with fruits
▶	Using juices the right way
▶	Exploring agave nectar
▶	Enjoying chocolate treats
S
ugar is not a dirty word, even for a dia­
betic. But it’s no secret that the amount of 
sugar consumed by Americans today is out of 
control. Manufacturers sneak it into all kinds of 
products, including prepackaged rice pilaf mix, 
ketchup, and, of course, baked goods, under the 
names high-fructose corn syrup and malt syrup. 
Even though diabetes is a disease that involves 
impaired metabolism of carbohydrates, you can 
still enjoy desserts that contain starches and 
sugar. You just need to select your ingredients wisely and eat reasonably 
modest portions. But don’t waste time feeling guilty because you can’t stay 
away from sweets. Sweet is one of the basic tastes, just like sour and salty, 
and craving sweet foods is normal.
Of course, people crave sweets such as cookies, jelly doughnuts, pies, and 
candy made with refined white flour and white sugar, which provide little 
nutrition. Enriched white flour has had a significant portion of the nutrients 
in the original whole grain removed, and white sugar contains no vitamins or 
minerals at all.
In this chapter, we show you how to create appealing desserts that feature 
nutritious ingredients. We help you satisfy your cravings for sweet foods, 
including chocolate. We introduce a healthful sweetener, agave nectar, to 
flavor desserts the right way. And we give you a host of different presenta­
tions to impress your guests.

Finding a New Take on Fruit
Diabetic desserts have long consisted of sugar-free gelatin and fruit. There’s 
certainly nothing wrong with that, but if you’re bored with the standard take 
on fruit, we have several recipes that help you improve upon that old stan­
dard, fruit, and give it an update you’d be proud to serve to anyone.
	
T Spiced Infusion with 
	
Tropical Fruits
Tobi Sovak, pastry chef at Derek’s Bistro in Los Angeles (see Appendix A), gives you a 
way to enjoy a treat without all the sugar that comes with most sweets! Be aware that 
this dish still contains carbs, and like everything else, enjoying it in moderation is key.
Preparation time: 5 minutes
Cooking time: 30 minutes, mostly steeping time
Yield: 2 servings
1⁄4 cup Splenda for Baking
21⁄2 cups water
8 star anise
2 vanilla beans
2 tablespoons gingerroot
Zest of 1 lemon
1 cinnamon stick
15 whole black peppercorns
1 teaspoon coriander seed
11⁄2 cups fresh tropical fruits, such as mango, 
pineapple, star fruit, or passion fruit
	 1	Combine all the ingredients, except the fruit, in a large saucepan and bring to a boil. 
Turn off the heat, cover, and allow to steep 1⁄2 hour. Strain spices and herbs and allow to 
cool completely.
	 2	Serve on top of the fruit.

Ginger and lemon brighten the sweet flavors of the cantaloupe and papaya 
in the following recipe. Choose cantaloupes that are heavy for their size and 
have a lightly sweet melon fragrance. A cantaloupe should be firm but give 
slightly when pressed. Avoid melons with mushy spots or discolorations.
The papaya is a large pear-shaped tropical fruit. It contains a bed of large 
peppery seeds in the center of the fruit. If you’re looking for a ripe papaya 
to use immediately or refrigerate, choose richly colored papayas, with 
splotches of bright yellow, green, and some orange. Green papayas will ripen 
in a few days if left at room temperature and placed in a brown paper bag.
Creating luscious fruit desserts 
with different flavorings
Even if you don’t have time to prepare a full-
blown fruit recipe, you can still concoct won­
derful desserts and mouthwatering nibbles 
simply by using luscious fruit and adding a spe­
cial ingredient or two. You can use all sorts of 
herbs, spices, and nuts to enhance the flavor of 
fruit. Some examples include:
	✓	Peel a banana, freeze it, and then purée it 
in a food processor, along with almond or 
peanut butter, and you’ll have a fruit version 
of ice cream.
	✓	Purée ripe melon with lowfat vanilla yogurt, 
a dash of nutmeg and cinnamon, and a 
squirt of lemon for a refreshing fruit soup.
	✓	Combine brown sugar substitute and lowfat 
vanilla yogurt. Layer the yogurt with fresh 
fruit to create a parfait.
	✓	Grill pineapple slices and then lightly 
coat with lemon juice, a dash of honey, and 
cinnamon.
	✓	Create fruit kabobs from your fresh favor­
ites and marinate them in lemon juice, 
nutmeg, and crushed mint.
One of the easiest ways to spice up a fruit des­
sert is by adding, well, spices. Try sprinkling 
fresh fruit with traditional Indian spices like 
green cardamom or with a Latin-inspired com­
bination of cayenne pepper and cinnamon. Get 
started with the spiced fruit in the next recipe.

T Cantaloupe-Papaya Salad with 
	
Ginger Simple Syrup
Chef Kyle Ketchum of The Lark in West Bloomfield, Michigan (see Appendix A), offers 
this fruity dessert sure to please the taste buds. It’s a simple recipe, using simple syrup. 
Simple syrup is made from sugar and water; here, however, we substitute Splenda — 
the non-sugar sweetener — for the same amount of sugar. Enjoy the natural fruit flavors 
of these antioxidant-packed fruits with a little something extra drizzled lightly on top.
Preparation time: 20 minutes
Cooking time: 10 minutes
Yield: 6 servings
Syrup:
1⁄4 cup (18 packets) Splenda
1⁄2 cup water
2 inches fresh gingerroot, peeled
1 tablespoon lemon zest
Fruit salad:
1 cantaloupe
2 papayas
4 mint sprigs
	 1	Bring the Splenda and water to a boil in a small saucepan over moderate heat. Add the 
ginger and reduce the heat, allowing the liquid to simmer.
	 2	Stir until the Splenda dissolves and the ginger infuses the syrup, about 2 minutes. 
Remove the pan from heat and take out the ginger. Allow the syrup to cool at room tem­
perature. Add the lemon zest.
	 3	Scoop out the meat of the fruits with a melon baller and then toss it with the simple 
syrup and mint when you’re ready to serve it.

T Pears Baked in Red Wine 
	
alla Piemontese
This recipe, courtesy of Barbetta in New York City (see Appendix A), is a classic way of 
preparing pears in Piemonte, Italy’s northwesternmost region. The pears should be 
baked until the skins turn brown and crinkly — strafugna as they would say in the 
Piemontese dialect. Here, we substitute Splenda for sugar, which causes the pears to 
lack the almost candied taste of the traditional preparation. Splenda, however, is a natu­
ral-tasting artificial sweetener, so you’ll still be satisfied with the pear’s flavor. Keep in 
mind, however, that since fruit and wine have natural sugars, we can’t completely dis­
count the carbohydrate content of this dish, which (per serving) is equivalent to almost 
3 starch servings. Consider enjoying this delightful dessert after a meal low in starch 
and only on occasion.
Preparation time: 15 minutes
Cooking time: 11⁄2 hours, plus cooling time
Yield: 4 servings
10 ounces dry red wine
7 cloves
1 cinnamon stick
Juice of 2 lemons
1 cup Splenda
4 large Bosc pears, unpeeled
	 1	Preheat the oven to 300 degrees.
	 2	Pour the wine into a 9-inch-square baking pan. Add the cloves, cinnamon, lemon juice, 
and Splenda and stir until the Splenda dissolves. Add the pears to the pan. Place them

minutes.

Juicing Your Way to Tasty 
and Healthy Treats
Fruit juice lacks the fiber of whole fruit, so all the natural sugars can really 
affect your blood sugar without all the fiber to slow it down. But with a little 
diligence, you can use fruit juice to flavor your desserts and still maintain 
your blood sugar levels.
	
T Cranberry-Raspberry Granita
This refreshing treat, courtesy of Heather Dismore (and shown in the color section), 
makes for a sweet dessert — except it doesn’t have any added sugar. Raspberries and 
cranberries are some of the best sources of antioxidants, and you don’t even have to 
wait for summer to take advantage of these nutritional powerhouses. Most berries are 
available in frozen food sections of supermarkets and have all the great nutrition of 
their fresh versions.
Preparation time: 6 hours and 30 minutes, mostly unattended
Yield: 6 servings
2 cups 100% juice cranberry-raspberry juice 
blend
1 1⁄2 cups raspberries (fresh or previously 
frozen, thawed, and drained)
1⁄2 cup Splenda sugar substitute
	 1	In a blender, combine the juice and raspberries. Mix well. Pour the mixture through a 
fine-mesh sieve placed over a mixing bowl. Press the mixture gently through the sieve, 
as necessary, to extract as much juice as possible. Discard the mixture in the sieve or 
reserve for another use.
	 2	Add the Splenda to the strained juice mixture and stir to mix well. Cover and freeze. Stir 
thoroughly with a fork about every 30 minutes, for 6 hours or so, or until the granita is 
frozen in a crumbly, grainy texture.

Citrus fruits in particular make great juice choices for adding to desserts. 
Their strong flavors mean a little can go a long way. And many are tart rather 
than sweet, so they naturally have few sugars. For the scoop on how to juice 
your own citrus, check out Chapter 7.
Taking Advantage of Agave Nectar
Agave nectar is a delicious natural sweetener with a flavor similar to honey. 
It’s derived from the same plant that gives us tequila. Compared to other 
sweeteners, it has a low glycemic index. It provides sweetness without the 
sugar rush (and subsequent crash) of refined sugars. Used in moderation, it 
can be part of a healthy diabetic diet. 
Additionally, agave nectar, sometimes called agave syrup, is full of other health 
benefits, including improving bacterial balance in the gut. When mixed with 
salt, it’s a beneficial treatment for wound care. Inulin, one of the components 
of agave, may help lower cholesterol, reduce the risk of some cancers, and 
improve the absorption of nutrients, like isoflavones, calcium, and magnesium. 
	
Brown Rice Pudding 
Sublime (www.sublimerestaurant.com) located in Ft. Lauderdale, Florida, brings 
you this twist on a traditional dessert favorite. Brown rice, because it retains its bran, 
has more fiber than white rice and takes longer to cook, so definitely allow extra time 
during the initial cooking phase. 
Preparation time: 10 minutes
Cooking time: 1 hour 45 minutes
Yield: 6 servings
1 1⁄4 cups brown rice
3 cups soymilk
1⁄2 cup golden raisins
1⁄2 cup raisins
2 teaspoons agave nectar
	 1	Cook rice according to package directions, stirring often. 
	 2	Combine the cooked rice with the soymilk, raisins, and agave nectar. Cover and cook 
the mixture over low heat for 1 hour, until most of the soymilk has evaporated and the 
rice is creamy.

Crispy Oatmeal Cookies 
Vegetate in Washington, D.C. developed these cookies, sweetened only with agave 
nectar. They are surprisingly high in fiber and protein, especially compared to tradi­
tional cookies. These cookies can definitely help curb a sugar craving, without spiking 
your blood sugar. 
Preparation time: 15 minutes
Cooking time: 24 minutes
Yield: 12 servings, 2 cookies per serving (2 dozen cookies total)
1⁄2 cup grape seed oil
1⁄2 cup agave nectar
1⁄4 cup soy milk
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
3 cups old-fashioned rolled oats
1⁄2 teaspoon baking soda
2 teaspoons cinnamon
1⁄2 cup white flour
1⁄2 cup whole-wheat flour
	 1	Preheat oven to 350 degrees. 
	 2	Mix grape seed oil, agave nectar, soy milk and vanilla.  Add oats, baking soda, cinna­
mon, and flours to the liquid mixture.  Mix until well combined.
	 3	Using a small spoon, drop dough on nonstick cookie sheet and flatten with wet fingers 
or spatula, roughly 2 inches apart.  
	 4	Bake 12 minutes or until golden brown and crispy.
	 5	Removed baked cookies from cookie sheet and place on a cooling rack. Allow to cool 
completely. Store cooled cookies in an airtight container.

Choosing Chocolate for Dessert
What would life be without chocolate? Fortunately, you won’t have to specu­
late or even discover the situation for yourself. Mix up your own tasty choco­
late concoctions by substituting your favorite no-calorie sweetener for the 
regular sugar.
	
And whenever possible, choose the highest-quality cocoa powder you can 
afford. The flavor is much better, and since you’re only having a small portion 
anyway, you definitely want the best-tasting bite you can get!

Mixing up some meringues
Meringue, essentially egg whites flavored and whipped to foamy peaks, is an 
extremely versatile food. You can create little clouds to hold fresh fruit, top a 
fruit pie, or even use it to cover a pound cake and ice cream (to create baked 
Alaska). Meringue is naturally lowfat and takes on the flavor of any extracts, 
like almond, mint, or chocolate, so experiment and enjoy!
	
T Chocolate Meringue Bits with 
	
Strawberries and Cream
These little meringues, courtesy of Heather Dismore, are a surefire way to satisfy your 
chocolate cravings without all the calories and fat. We flavor them with cocoa powder 
and Splenda to give fantastic flavor. And the texture of these “lite bites” is outstanding. 
Top with fresh strawberries for a dash of fiber and vitamin C.
Preparation time: 30 minutes, plus standing time of 8 hours or overnight
Cooking time: 1 hour and 30 minutes
Yield: 40 11⁄2-inch meringues
4 egg whites
1⁄4 teaspoon cream of tartar
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
2⁄3 cup Splenda
1⁄3 cup cocoa powder
1 cup reduced-fat tub-style whipped topping
40 strawberries
	 1	Preheat the oven to 225 degrees. Line 2 baking sheets with parchment paper.
	 2	Beat the egg whites, cream of tartar, and vanilla at high speed with an electric mixer 
until frothy. Add the Splenda, 1 tablespoon at a time, beating until stiff peaks form, 
roughly 5 to 7 minutes. Gently fold in the cocoa powder until completely incorporated.
	 3	Spoon heaping tablespoons of the mixture onto the baking sheets. Bake for 1 hour and 
30 minutes; turn the oven off. Let the meringues stand in the closed oven for 8 hours or 
overnight. Store in an airtight container.
	 4	Just before serving, top each meringue with 1 scant teaspoon of whipped topping and a 
strawberry.

Enjoying a coffee break
Coffee is one of the most available beverages in society these days. You can’t 
even take a stroll through your local grocery store or mall without being 
assaulted by the aromas of your local coffee roaster. And fortunately, most 
of them offer delicious decaffeinated versions of these aromatic beverages. 
Steam up a little nonfat milk to go with it, and you’re ready to relax for a few 
minutes.
	
For a decadent but diabetic-friendly coffee break, make your own decaf, nonfat 
coffee drink (sweetened with sugar-free sweeteners, of course) and pair it with 
our delicious, crunchy biscotti.
	
Chocolate-Almond Biscotti
Biscotti are a great treat, and now you can enjoy them homemade, and without all the 
calories and sugar. This rendition of the Italian “biscuit” (courtesy of Heather Dismore) 
is easy to make and takes no time. It’s also half the calories and carbohydrates of the 
usual crusty cookie. See these treats in the color section.
Preparation time: 1 hour
Cooking time: 45 minutes
Yield: 20 servings
Nonstick cooking spray
1⁄2 cup almonds, toasted and roughly chopped
1⁄2 cup all-purpose flour
1⁄3 cup whole-wheat flour
1⁄4 cup unsweetened cocoa powder
2 teaspoons instant coffee crystals
1⁄2 teaspoon baking soda
1⁄8 teaspoon salt
1⁄2 cup Splenda for Baking
1 egg
1 egg white
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1 teaspoon almond extract
	 1	Preheat the oven to 350 degrees. Line a large baking sheet with aluminum foil. Spray the 
foil with nonstick cooking spray.
	 2	In a food processor, combine 1⁄4 cup of the almonds and the all-purpose flour, whole-
wheat flour, cocoa powder, coffee crystals, baking soda, and salt. Process until the nuts 
are finely ground, approximately 2 minutes. Transfer the mixture to a large mixing bowl.

261
 Chapter 16: Smart Ways to Include Dessert in a Diabetic Diet
	 3	In the food processor, combine the Splenda, egg, egg white, vanilla extract, and almond 
extract. Mix until the mixture is slightly thickened, roughly 2 minutes. Add the egg mix­
ture to the flour mixture in the mixing bowl. Stir in the remaining 1⁄4 cup almonds.
	 4	Use half the batter to form a log (approximately 5 to 7 inches long) on one-half of the 
foil-lined baking sheet. Repeat with the remaining dough on other half of the baking 
sheet. Bake until firm, approximately 15 minutes. Cool approximately 10 minutes. 
Reduce the oven temperature to 300 degrees.
	 5	Place the logs on a cutting board. Using a serrated bread knife, cut each log into approx­
imately 10 1⁄2-inch diagonal slices. Return the slices to the baking sheets. Bake until the 
cut sides feel dry to the touch, approximately 20 minutes. Cool completely and store in 
an airtight container.

T
he chapters in this part tell you how to eat well and 
stay healthy wherever you are. You can always visit 
a fast-food franchise, but a lot of that food isn’t good for 
you. So in these chapters, I help you to pick and choose 
well. That way, you can select a meal even when your only 
choice is the one fast-food restaurant off the next exit on 
the freeway.

▶	Finding ways to enjoy your food
▶	Considering dessert
P
eople eat many of their meals in restaurants these days, so integrating 
restaurant eating into a nutritional plan is essential for a person with 
diabetes. The restaurant business is booming, and creative chefs have the 
same celebrity status as famous sports stars. And they deserve it. They use 
fresh ingredients to produce some of the most delicious and unique tastes 
imaginable. Unfortunately, nutrition isn’t always uppermost in their minds. 
Our experience with the many chefs in this book proves that interest in good 
nutrition is increasing, but you’re still on your own most of the time when 
selecting healthy foods. This chapter helps you ensure that your restaurant 
eating fits well into your nutritional plan.
Your situation may be much like the plight of the customer who called the 
waiter over and said, “Waiter, taste this soup.” The waiter replied, “Is there 
something wrong with it?” “Never mind,” said the customer, “just taste the 
soup.” “But it smells and looks okay,” said the waiter. “That’s all right, just 
taste the soup,” replied the customer. “But sir, there’s no spoon,” said the 
waiter. “Aha,” said the customer. Or you may be like the diner who complains 
to the waiter, “Waiter, I can’t find any steak in this steak pie.” The waiter 
replies, “Well, there’s no horse in the horseradish either.” And if you find a 
fly in your soup, thank the waiter for the extra protein but ask him to serve 
it separately. The point is that you are ultimately responsible to ensure that 
you know what is in the food you order and make healthy choices.

266
Part III: Eating Away from Home 
Preparing for Restaurant Dining
If you live in (or are visiting) one of the cities that contains a restaurant we 
reference in this book (see Appendix A), the task of finding a restaurant that 
is appropriate for a person with diabetes is much easier for you. The chefs 
who have contributed to this book are health-conscious. They make an effort 
to keep the fat and the sugar low. But they have to respond to what they 
perceive to be their customer’s needs. They think that one of the main 
“needs” is for a lot of food, so your portions will almost always be larger 
than necessary.
You have to evaluate the food you order by questioning your waitperson 
carefully. Even if the balance of energy sources is right, you will probably 
receive too much food and should take some home or leave some on your 
plate.
	
Because this book is limited to certain cities and  restaurants, you may often 
find yourself having to choose a restaurant where you don’t know the ingredi­
ents in the food or whether the menu items are healthy or not. How do you go 
about choosing a restaurant in this situation? Here are a few suggestions:
	
✓	No particular kind of food is better or worse than any other, with the 
exception of fast food (we discuss this issue in Chapter 18). You may 
think that vegetarian food is better than animal sources, but a dish of 
pasta in a creamy sauce is no better than a piece of fatty steak. Often, 
restaurants have several menu items that fit into your nutrition plan.
	
✓	Consider choosing a restaurant that you can walk to and from. The exer­
cise you get will offset the extra calories you may consume.
	
✓	Many restaurants now publish their menus on the Internet. Before decid­
ing to visit a particular restaurant, go to the establishment’s Web site 
and make sure that it serves food you can eat.
	
✓	Don’t go to the restaurant if the catch of the day is fish sticks.
	
✓	Call ahead and find out whether you can substitute items on the menu. 
Nonfranchise and non-fast-food restaurants are much more likely to let 
you substitute menu items. Fast-food restaurants are able to serve large 
numbers of people at lower prices by making the food entirely uniform. 
On the other hand, as Chapter 18 explains, this uniformity makes it 
easier to know the exact ingredients and methods of preparation. You 
need to ask only a few questions to know whether a restaurant will be 
accommodating. Ask whether the staff will
 
• Substitute skim milk for whole milk.
 
• Reduce the amount of butter and sugar in a dish.

267
 Chapter 17: Making Eating Out a Nourishing Experience
 
• Serve gravies, salad dressings, and sauces on the side.
 
• Bake, broil, and poach instead of frying or sautéing.
	
✓	An older restaurant has the advantage of having experienced and well-
trained waitstaff who know what the kitchen staff are willing to do for 
you, based on what has been done before.
	
✓	Find out whether the restaurant already has special meals or entrees for 
people with chronic diseases such as heart disease. They’re much more 
likely to be health conscious in their cooking.
	
✓	When you choose a restaurant, consider what you’ve already eaten that 
day. For example, if you’ve already eaten your daily limit of carbohy­
drate, then the choice of a restaurant where pasta or rice is the major 
ingredient may not be a good one. People often choose a restaurant 
days in advance, so if you know ahead where you’ll be dining, you can 
plan to modify your eating accordingly earlier in the day, especially if 
the restaurant specializes in foods you should eat in small quantities.
	
✓	Drink water or have a vegetable snack before you go to the restaurant so 
that hunger won’t drive you to make bad choices.
	
✓	If you know that the restaurant serves huge portions of everything, don’t 
go there unless you plan to share your meal or take part of your meal 
home.
	
Mrs. Wilson, who has type 2 diabetes, decided to go to a well-known delica­
tessen before she attended a musical play. She knew that they served huge 
portions, but she also knew that she could order a mini-version of many of the 
items. At the restaurant, she ordered a mini-Reuben sandwich, expecting to 
get half or less of the usual entree. What arrived was the entire Reuben sand­
wich without the usual potato salad and coleslaw. She couldn’t take half of it 
home because she was going directly to the show. She knew that she’d feel 
bad leaving part of such a delicious sandwich, so she ended up eating most of 
it. Her blood glucose level later that night reflected the huge excess in calories 
that she had consumed.
You can see from the information in this section that you can do plenty, even 
before you reach the restaurant, to prepare for dining out. Your preparation 
may make the whole experience much more satisfying and less frustrating.
Beginning the Dining Experience
	
As you sit down to enjoy your meal, you can take many steps to make the 
experience of eating out the pleasure that it ought to be. A few simple consid­
erations at this point allow you to enjoy the meal free of the concern that you 
are wrecking your nutritional program. Among the steps that you can take are 
the following:

268
Part III: Eating Away from Home 
	
✓	If you arrive early, avoid sitting in the bar with cocktails before you 
move to your table to eat your meal.
	
✓	Ask the hostess to seat you promptly so you don’t have to wait and get 
too hungry or even hypoglycemic.
	
✓	Ask your waiter not to bring bread or to take it off the table if it is there 
already. That goes for chips and crackers as well.
	
✓	Ask for raw vegetables without a dip, what the restaurant menus call 
crudités, so you can munch on something before you order.
	
✓	Check your blood glucose before you order so you’ll know how much 
carbohydrate is appropriate at that time.
	
✓	Wait to administer your short-acting insulin until you can be sure of the 
food delivery time.
	
Mr. Phillips, a 63-year-old man with type 2 diabetes, was trying to understand, 
with the help of his dietitian, why his blood glucose had risen to 386 mg/dl 
after a meal at a local Mexican restaurant. “I knew the portions were large, so I 
ordered a bean tortilla, and I didn’t even eat the whole thing. I left half of it on 
my plate. I ate very little of the rice as well.” The dietitian asked him if he had 
arrived early at the restaurant. “Oh yes, I forgot. I had to wait in the bar, and 
I had a virgin margarita.” “That,” said the dietitian, “explains your high blood 
glucose. The margarita is all carbohydrate.”
Ordering from the Menu
The regular menu and the specials of the day or season are arranged to 
encourage you to order a big meal. One of the more interesting things that we 
learned as a result of working with the chefs whose recipes are found in this 
book, especially the European chefs now cooking in the United States, is the 
expectation of large portions on the part of U.S. restaurant-goers, compared 
to Europeans. The chefs were amazed at how much food they had to put on 
each plate to satisfy U.S. tastes. When you order meat, fish, or poultry, you 
often get at least twice as much as the recommended serving. Considering 
how frequently people eat out in the United States, it’s no wonder the popula­
tion is getting fatter.
	
Your strategy for ordering from the menu should include the following:
	
✓	Plan to leave some food or take home half your order, because the 
portions are always too large. You can also order a dish to share with 
another person.
	
✓	If you decide to have wine, order it by the glass. Diners almost always 
finish a bottle of wine, and unless eight of you share the bottle, you’ll 
drink too much.

269
 Chapter 17: Making Eating Out a Nourishing Experience
	
✓	Consider using an appetizer as your entree.
	
✓	Feel free to get a complete description, including portion size, of an 
appetizer or entree from the waitperson so that you aren’t surprised 
when the food arrives. Pay particular attention to how the food is 
cooked — in fat or butter, for example.
	
✓	Consider a meal of soup and salad. This combination can be delicious, 
filling, low in calories, and low in carbohydrates.
	
✓	Order clear soups rather than cream soups.
	
✓	Ask for salad dressings and sauces on the side if possible. This way, you 
are in control of the amount you consume.
	
✓	You’re probably wise to choose fish more often than meat, both to avoid 
fat and to take advantage of the cholesterol-lowering properties of fish. 
Remember, however, that fried fish can be as fat-laden as a steak.
	
✓	Let your server know that you need to eat soon. If your food will be 
delayed because the kitchen is slow or busy, insist that vegetable snacks 
be brought to the table.
The description of an entree usually offers clues that tell you whether it’s a 
good choice for you. These words, in particular, indicate that the preparation 
keeps fat to a minimum:
	
✓	Baked
	
✓	Blackened
	
✓	Broiled
	
✓	Cooked in its own juice
	
✓	Grilled
	
✓	Poached
On the other hand, the following words point to a less desirable high-fat 
entree:
	
✓	Battered
	
✓	Buttered or in butter sauce
	
✓	Creamed or in cream sauce
	
✓	Deep-fried
	
✓	Escalloped
	
✓	Fried
	
✓	Golden brown
	
✓	In a plum sauce

270
Part III: Eating Away from Home 
	
✓	In cheese sauce
	
✓	Sautéed
	
✓	Sweet-and-sour
	
✓	With peanuts or cashews
Does it really matter if you order one kind of sauce versus another? Here are 
the calorie counts per tablespoon for various salad dressings. Remember 
that the energy in food is properly expressed in kilocalories, not calories, 
which are a thousand times smaller:
	
✓	Blue cheese: 82 kilocalories
	
✓	Creamy Italian dressing: 52 kilocalories
	
✓	Lowfat French dressing: 22 kilocalories
	
✓	Red-wine vinegar: 2 kilocalories
Planning at Each Meal and in 
Specific Kinds of Restaurants
You can make good choices at every meal, whether it’s breakfast, lunch, or 
dinner. Every kind of food offers you the opportunity to select a lowfat, low-
salt alternative. You just need to think about it and be aware of the possibili­
ties. Helping you choose healthy meals is the purpose of this section.
When you go to any one of the ethnic restaurants discussed here, take a look 
at the waiters and waitresses. Are they overweight or obese? Usually they’re 
not, yet they eat the food you’re about to eat on a regular basis. This means 
you can order food in this restaurant and know that you have plenty of good 
healthy choices. (Check out Chapter 4 for an introduction to ethnic foods and 
how to prepare them yourself.)
Breakfast
The good choices at breakfast are fresh foods, which usually contain plenty 
of fiber. Fresh fruit and juice are good ways to start the meal, followed by 
hot cereals such as oatmeal or Wheatena, or high-fiber cold cereals such as 
shredded wheat or bran cereals. Always add skim milk or 1 percent fat milk 
instead of whole milk. Enjoy egg whites but not yolks, or make an omelet with 
two whites for every yolk.

271
 Chapter 17: Making Eating Out a Nourishing Experience
Less desirable choices are foods such as quiche, bacon, fried or hash brown 
potatoes, croissants, pastries, and doughnuts. And be careful of the high 
calorie coffees. According to Starbuck’s own Web site, a Strawberries and 
Crème Frappuccino Blended Crème-Whip has 570 kilocalories, including 130 
kilocalories of fat.
Appetizers, salads, and soups
Raw and plain food beats those cooked and covered with butter or sour 
cream, and that rule applies to appetizers, salads, and soups, too. Raw car­
rots and celery can be enjoyed at any time and to almost any extent. Clear 
soups are always healthier. Salsa has become a popular accompaniment for 
crackers and chips instead of a high-fat dip. A delicious green salad is nutri­
tious and filling.
By contrast, olives, nachos, and avocados have lots of fat. Nuts, chips, and 
cheese before dinner add lots of calories. Fried onion appetizers are cur­
rently very popular, and they’re often dripping with fat. Watch out for the 
sour cream dips and the mayonnaise dips, since they, too, are full of fat.
Vegetarian food
As the population gets increasingly obese, there has been a trend to go 
to vegetarian restaurants. What is called vegetarian varies from no dairy 
products at all, which is referred to as vegans (people who use no animal 
products of any kind) to eating eggs and/or dairy. Vegans diets can provide 
all the nutritional needs of a patient, but must be carefully planned to do so. 
Alternatively, vegans dieters can take supplements of calcium, iodine, vita­
min B12, and vitamin D.
Lacto-vegetarians eat dairy but not eggs while lacto-ovo-vegetarians eat eggs 
and milk. Semi-vegetarians eat some fish and poultry as well.
Wherever you fit in the continuum of vegetarians, you should know that 
your choice is a good one. In general, vegetarians are lighter in weight than 
non-vegetarians. If you have diabetes, it is easier to control, and if you are at 
risk for diabetes, you are less likely to get it if you eat vegetarian. Vegetarian 
eating is also associated with less cancer, strokes, and heart attacks.
You still have to make good choices in the vegetarian restaurant. Stay away 
from the creamy, buttery foods and enjoy the lighter dishes made with grains 
like quinoa. Use beans and lentils to get your protein without the accompany­
ing fat of meat.

272
Part III: Eating Away from Home 
Seafood
Most fish are relatively low in fat and can be a healthy choice. But even the 
best fish can compromise your nutrition plan when they’re fried. Fish that 
stand out in the lowfat category are cod, bass, halibut, swordfish, and tuna in 
water. Most of the shellfish varieties are also lowfat. Stay away from herring, 
tuna in oil, and fried anything.
Chinese food
You can eat some great Chinese food and not have to worry about upsetting 
your diet plan. Any of the soups on the menu will be delicious and fill you 
up. Stick to vegetable dishes with small amounts of meat in them. Avoid fried 
dishes, whether they’re meats, tofu, or rice and noodles. Steamed dishes are 
a much better choice. Potstickers, an appetizer often found on the menu, 
and sweet-and-sour pork will really throw off your calorie count and your fat 
intake. Stay away from the almond cookies that often follow Chinese meals.
French food
While the old style of preparing French food promotes a lot of cream and 
gravy, a new style, called the new cuisine, emphasizes the freshest ingredi­
ents, usually cooked in their own sauce. This style has revolutionized the 
French restaurants. Still, some French chefs cling to the old ways, and their 
food is not for you, unless you’re prepared to share your meal.
Most desserts in French restaurants are high in carbohydrate. Limit yourself 
to a taste or, better yet, don’t tempt yourself by ordering the cake or custard 
in the first place. See if the pastry chef has a fruit dish, like a poached pear, 
that is both delicious and good for you.
Indian food
Rice and pita bread are good carbohydrate choices, but avoid foods made 
with coconut milk because of its fat content. Meat, fish, and poultry cooked 
in the tandoori manner (baked in an oven) are fine, but Indian chefs like to fry 
many foods; keep those to a minimum. Curries are fine as long as they’re not 
made with coconut milk. Avoid ghee, which is clarified butter. Fried appetiz­
ers like samosas and creamy dishes do not help your blood glucose. Chicken 
tikka and chapatti are fine — they’re made with delicious spices (for taste) 
but little fat.

273
 Chapter 17: Making Eating Out a Nourishing Experience
Italian food
Stick to tomato-based sauces and avoid the creamy, buttery, cheesy sauces. 
Minestrone soup is a hearty vegetable soup that is low in fat. Pasta in general 
is fine as long as the sauce isn’t fatty. The problem with the pasta, however, 
is that the quantity is almost always too great. Share it or take half home. 
Sausage, because of all the added fats, is a poor choice, whether served with 
pasta or placed on pizza. Pesto sauce can be made with little fat. If you love 
the taste of basil, as Dr. Rubin does, ask for a lowfat version of this classic 
sauce. Ask whether the kitchen staff will make garlic bread with roasted 
garlic alone, without the butter that often accompanies it. You’ll be delighted 
with the delicious taste. Avoid Caesar salad and dishes made with a lot of 
cheese, such as cheese-filled ravioli.
Mexican food
Mexican food has become increasingly popular, but Mexican restaurants 
offer you many temptations to slip from your healthy eating plan. They often 
start with chips, nachos, and cheese. Tell your waiter to keep them off the 
table. Have salsa, not guacamole, as an appetizer. Stay away from anything 
refried; it means just what the word says. Avoid all dishes laden with cheese, 
as well as dishes heavy in sausage. Chicken with rice, grilled fish, and grilled 
chicken are excellent choices. Tortillas, burritos, and tostadas are delicious 
and good for you as long as you avoid the addition of a lot of cheese, sour 
cream, or guacamole. And keep in mind the importance of moderation. 
Mexican restaurants are known for large servings, so take some home.
Thai food
Other than the tendency to provide larger-than-needed portions, there is 
little that Thai restaurants do that is not good for the person with diabetes. 
The creative use of spices, emphasis on fish, and use of fresh vegetables 
make this cuisine a good choice for you. Just watch out for the spices.
Enjoying Your Food
	
If you’ve been conscientious in planning a delicious restaurant meal ahead of 
time, you deserve to really enjoy the food. But you need to continue thinking 
about healthy eating (and drinking) habits even as you sit down to the meal. 
All the great planning can come undone if you’re careless at this point. Think 
about the following advice as you eat:

274
Part III: Eating Away from Home 
	
✓	If you have a glass of wine, consider the number of calories.
	
✓	Try using some behavior modification to prolong the meal and give your 
brain a chance to know that you’ve eaten: Eat slowly, chew each bite 
thoroughly, and put your fork down between each bite.
	
✓	Remember that the meal is a social occasion. Spend more time talking to 
your companions and less time concentrating on the food.
	
✓	Remove the skin if you’re eating poultry, and allow the sauce to drip off 
the morsel of food on your fork if you’re eating a dish cooked in a sauce.
	
✓	After you’ve carefully controlled the intake of food on your plate, don’t 
add significant calories by tasting or finishing the food on your compan­
ion’s plate.
Finishing with Dessert
For many people, the early parts of a meal are just a prelude to their favorite 
part, which is dessert. Most people have a sweet tooth, and dessert is often 
the way that they satisfy that need. The Italians don’t call the part of the 
menu that features the desserts the dulci (which means “sweets”) without 
reason. Dessert, in many restaurants, has become a showpiece. The pastry 
chef tries to show how sweet he or she can make the dessert while creating 
a culinary work of art. The term decadent is often used in describing the rich­
ness of these desserts.
Does this mean that you can’t have any dessert at all? No. Making a wise 
choice simply requires a certain amount of awareness on your part. You need 
to ask yourself the question, “Is the taste of this dessert worth the potential 
damage it will do to my blood glucose and calorie intake?” If you can answer 
this question with a “yes,” then have the dessert, but check your blood glu­
cose and adjust your medications as needed after eating it. Then return to 
your nutritional plan without spending a lot of time regretting your lapse. 
You might even do a little extra exercise to counteract the calories.
On the other hand, if you want to answer the question with a “no,” ask your­
self these questions to help you avoid temptation:
	
✓	Do you really need or want the dessert?
	
✓	Will you remember it ten minutes later when you’re at the theater?
	
✓	Could you share the dessert or just taste it?
	
✓	Is a fruit dessert available that you could enjoy instead?

275
 Chapter 17: Making Eating Out a Nourishing Experience
To help you avoid that high-calorie dessert even further, think in terms of the 
number of minutes of active aerobic exercise you must do to account for the 
calories you consume in a dessert. If your exercise is walking, double these 
times. Here are some examples:
	
✓	Boston cream pie: 32 minutes
	
✓	Brownie: 32 minutes
	
✓	Apple pie: 34 minutes
	
✓	Hot fudge sundae: 38 minutes
	
✓	Cheesecake: 40 minutes
	
✓	Ice cream cone: 44 minutes
	
✓	Strawberry milkshake: 47 minutes
You may conclude that dessert is worth your time, but we’ll leave that deci­
sion up to you.

W
ould you like to take a ride with Dr. Rubin and Cait? Here’s your 
chance. You’re invited to travel with them on the highways and 
byways of some of the most scenic areas of the country with the best desti­
nations. You will stop along the way at some of the best-known fast-food res­
taurants. Luckily, you are with Cait, who knows the contents of all the foods 
in these restaurants, and Dr. Rubin, who is there to make sure that you enjoy 
yourself while staying on your eating program. If you want to get the details 
on these trips, you can refer to Frommer’s very popular travel guides (pub­
lished by Wiley). We give you just the bare essentials here.
	
We selected these specific restaurants because they’re usually the most 
common examples of a particular class of fast-food restaurants. In no way do 
we mean to recommend them above others in their class.
In this chapter, we hit the high spots, the most commonly visited fast-food 
places. Keep in mind that one chapter isn’t enough space to cover the hun­
dreds of different fast-food franchises all over the country. In general, a 
burger in McDonald’s looks like a burger at Burger King, but there are major 
variations.

278
Part III: Eating Away from Home 
Touring the Fast-Food Landscape
Is it even important to discuss fast-food restaurants? McDonald’s claims that 
it serves 26 million customers every day in the United States. That’s almost 
one in ten of all Americans. It has 13,700 restaurants, compared with 7,600 
for Burger King; 5,900 for Wendy’s; and 3,300 for Arby’s. You bet they have a 
huge impact on eating in America.
People used to say that at fast-food restaurants you could get more nourish­
ment from biting your lip than eating the food. This is definitely no longer the 
case. Because everyone is conscious of good nutrition these days, you can 
now find something healthful to eat in any fast-food restaurant.
	
Watch for a few key words that warn you not to order a particular item in 
these restaurants. If the food is called a double, big, jumbo, monster, or the 
ultimate, stay away from that selection. Also avoid any menu item with bacon 
or sausage.
The reason these establishments are called fast-food restaurants is that they 
have food preparation, ordering, and serving down to the least amount of 
time possible. Because we’re in a hurry on our trips in this chapter and don’t 
want to stop for a long time, there’s nothing wrong with enjoying that conve­
nience, but we want to make sure that the food is right for you.
Of course, some of these places aren’t meant to rush into and out of. They 
are sit-down places, but the food is standardized and is prepared pretty fast, 
so the result is about the same. This chapter discusses those kinds of restau­
rants, too.
One advantage of franchise restaurants is that a hamburger in a Denny’s in 
California is almost exactly the same as a hamburger in a Denny’s in New 
Mexico or Oregon. You know exactly what you’re getting, which makes the 
meal easier to fit into your diet. On the other hand, the quick serving and 
eating often doesn’t allow your brain enough time to recognize that your 
body has eaten enough calories, and you may be tempted to order more 
food. Don’t.
A study published in The Lancet in December 2004 that followed 3,000 people 
over 15 years showed that those who ate regularly at fast-food restaurants 
gained 10 pounds more than those who did not and were much more likely to 
develop diabetes. They did not have Cait and Dr. Rubin along to help them as 
you do. Cait has selected the restaurants in advance to save you the trouble 
of choosing them along the way.

279
 Chapter 18: Fast Food on Your Itinerary
	
In Chapter 2, I introduce you to trans fats, the absolutely worst kind of fat, 
because it not only raises bad cholesterol but lowers good cholesterol. These 
fats are also called hydrogenated or partially hydrogenated oils. Since 2006, 
food labels have had to list the amount of trans fats, and the better fast-food 
places are trying to eliminate them from their cooking. They’re still present in 
large amounts, however, especially in foods like french-fried potatoes, batter-
dipped fried onions, fried mozzarella sticks, and buffalo wings. The best way 
to avoid trans fats is to order food that is low in all fats. The fast-food restau­
rants that have no trans fats in their foods include:
	
✓	In-N-Out Burger
	
✓	Subway
	
✓	Taco Bell
	
✓	Pizza Hut
	
✓	Popeyes
	
✓	Little Caesars
	
✓	Papa Johns
The fast-food restaurants that are the worst offenders with the most items 
with trans fats are:
	
✓	Jack in the Box
	
✓	Burger King
	
✓	White Castle
	
✓	A & W
	
✓	Dairy Queen
On the trips I’m going to take in this chapter, I’m going to avoid the heavy 
offenders and emphasize the zero users.
	
No one should say that a person with diabetes can’t go to a fast-food restau­
rant and remain on his or her nutritional plan. But these places do offer many 
seductive and unhealthy choices. You need to plan in advance what you’re 
going to choose. You can’t go wrong if you stick to the selections that we talk 
about in this chapter.
If you want to be sure of the nutritional content of various fast foods, refer to 
your favorite search engine on the Internet and enter the name of a specific 
franchise. All the details are there.

Part III: Eating Away from Home 
Driving From New Orleans to 
See Civil War Plantations
We start with a fairly short trip filled with old plantations that are open to the 
public. Plan this trip in the Spring or Fall because Summer is extremely hot 
here.
	
Figure 18-1: 
New 
Orleans 
to St. 
Francisville.
	
After breakfast at our hotel, we leave New Orleans on I-10 going west and 
leave I-10 at exit 220 onto I-310. At exit 6 we find State Route 48, which takes 
us to the Destrehan Plantation. We spend an hour there and get back on 
I-310. Cait has picked out a Popeyes Restaurant a short distance away on 
US 90 in Boutte for lunch.
Popeyes is a popular chicken restaurant, where the chicken can be mild or 
spicy. Cait suggests that you have the mild chicken and recommends a wing, 
a leg, a thigh and a breast. It should be skinless and with no breading. That 
saves lots of calories. It adds up to only 200 kilocalories, most of which is 51 
grams of protein with only 91⁄2 grams of fat and no carbohydrate. If you have 

281
 Chapter 18: Fast Food on Your Itinerary
it breaded and with the skin, for example the thigh goes from 80 to 280 kilo­
calories, while the breast goes from 120 to 350 kilocalories. Cait has really 
saved you from a lot of excess calories.
You can add some carbohydrate with a piece of corn on the cob. It has 37 
grams of carbohydrate and 190 kilocalories. Or have some Cajun Rice at 170 
kilocalories and 22 grams of carbs. Try to drink water for your beverage. Cait 
recommends that you skip the dessert, a cinnamon apple turnover that has 
34 grams of sugars.
We continue following the River Road, which runs on either side of the 
Mississippi to Garyville and the San Francisco Plantation House where 
we spend another couple of hours. Continuing west we get to the Laura 
Plantation and spend time there. We find a place to stay at Vacherie, a little 
farther along the River Road.
We are up early the next morning heading for Donaldsonville on State Route 
3089 where Cait knows there is a McDonald’s for breakfast. Cait suggests an 
Egg McMuffin, which has 300 kilocalories with 12g of fat, 260mg of cholesterol 
and 30g of carbohydrate. She tells us to skip the breakfasts with sausages 
and bacon and warns us against the Big Breakfasts and the Deluxe Breakfasts 
that have almost 1,000 kilocalories or more per serving. A small glass of 
orange juice is 12 ounces, so we share a glass and each get 70 kilocalories 
that way. 
Cait has her usual black coffee, which helps to explain why she remains so 
slim (her good diet and all the exercise she does). She avoids the lattes and 
the cappuccinos that bring the calories up to almost 300.
Leaving McDonald’s we head on State Route 1 farther west to Nottoway 
Plantation, visit there, and go on to Baton Rouge where we find the Magnolia 
Mound Plantation, and then end the trip at St. Francisville, where we find the 
beautiful Rosedown Plantation.
Finding Gold and Silver in Colorado
Take this trip in the summer and you can do it in a day, although it’s better 
to take your time and give it two days. We all start out in Colorado Springs, 
Colorado heading north on U. S. 24, stopping at the Garden of the Gods, an 
amazing series of geological formations. We continue to the Florissant Fossil 
Beds National Monument, where plants, insects, and trees are preserved. 
Continuing on U. S. 24, we get to Hartsel, where we take State Route 9 north. 
Cait suggests we continue to Breckenridge. From Breckenridge we stay on 9 

282
Part III: Eating Away from Home 
for 10 miles where it joins I-70, getting off in Dillon, where we will have lunch. 
It’s a total of 120 miles from Colorado Springs.
She has picked out Arby’s in Dillon. She wanted to try Ruby Tuesdays but 
the nutritional information is so sparse that she did not know what to rec­
ommend. Arby’s has its problems as well. Many of its items have trans fats 
and are high in salt. She suggests we have the Chopped Turkey Club Salad. 
It is only 230 kilocalories, of which 95 come from 11g of fat. The sodium is a 
little high at 801mg. The Chopped Farmhouse Chicken-Grilled is an alternate 
choice with less sodium. Both dishes have 9g of carbohydrate. Cait tells 
us not to add Dijon Honey Mustard Dressing, which adds 180 kilocalories, 
almost all from fat. The Toasted Subs are loaded with salt and calories and 
are not a good choice, similar to the Market Fresh Sandwiches. For example, 
the Ultimate BLT Sandwich is 779 kilocalories with 45g of fat and 1,571mg of 
sodium.
	
Figure 18-2:

Springs to

ridge in a 
large circle.
	
Returning to I-70, we head to Georgetown, a center for the mining of both 
silver and gold. There is plenty to see in Georgetown about mining and we 
visit the Hamill House Museum.

283
 Chapter 18: Fast Food on Your Itinerary
After Georgetown, we continue back on I-70 heading east. It joins up with 
US 40 right into Golden, Colorado, where the Coors Brewing Company is 
located and can be visited. There are plenty of nice local restaurants in 
Golden, so we eat at one and stay in Golden for the night. The next day we 
will pick up US 6 and follow it through Denver to where it joins with I-25 and 
then go south for a visit to the Air Force Academy at exit 156B.
We head back to Colorado Springs on I-25. Cait wanted to stop at PF Chang’s 
in Colorado Springs for lunch but the items contain so much salt and do not 
list trans fats, so she vetoes this idea. Instead she takes us off exit 150 to a 
nearby Taco Bell. She suggests any of the tacos, gorditas, or chalupas, but 
not the burritos, which are too salty. The recommended items generally have 
about 300 kilocalories, 600mg of sodium, 12 to 18g of fat, and 30g of carbo­
hydrate. They are very tasty, and we enjoy our lunch before departing.
Visiting Utah’s Major Attractions
We have decided to take a shorter trip of 82 miles from Salt Lake City, Utah to 
Mirror Lake. We head east on I-80 early in the morning towards Park City, get­
ting off at exit 141 where Cait knows there is a Starbucks. 
At Starbucks you can drink a lot of calories if you order a fancy coffee like a 
Double Chocolaty Chip Frappuccino Blended Crème-whip at 510 kilocalories. If 
you order a cup of today’s blend, it’s 5 kilocalories. Unfortunately, Starbucks 
does not give you nutritional information for their cakes and pastries, but 
half a bagel toasted will be just fine. A little jam on it won’t hurt a bit, either. 
It sets you back just 100 kilocalories. Of course, if you add things like cream 
cheese, all bets are off.
Getting back in our car, we head to Park City. We have dinner and breakfast 
in our hotel. The next morning we get on the road early. We are headed to 
Wasatch-Cache National Forest on Route 248, then up to the Upper Provo 
River Falls on Route 150 to Washington Lake, a beautiful spot. We pass 
through Bald Mountain Pass and stop for more scenery at Mirror Lake. Then 
we retrace our route back to Salt Lake City, getting off I-80 at exit 126 where 
Cait has selected a Wendy’s.
Wendy’s offers many good choices for the traveler with diabetes. The 
Mandarin Chicken Salad has only 180 kilocalories, only 2g of fat, and 16g of 
carbohydrate. It’s mostly protein (24g). The Chicken Caesar is about the 
same. Watch out for the chili — too much salt. Stay away from the shakes and 
the Frostys — too many calories. Avoid the Baconator with 830 kilocalories 

284
Part III: Eating Away from Home 
and 1,880g of sodium. If you must have meat, the 1⁄4-lb Hamburger Patty is not 
a bad selection. But don’t have any doubles or triples. And try not to add 
cheese to your hamburger. It quickly raises the calorie and salt count.
After lunch we visit Temple Square in Salt Lake City, the center of 
Mormonism.
	
Figure 18-3:

Enjoying Hemingway Country: 
The Florida Keys
We are back in the southeastern United States, taking a wonderful ride from 
Key Largo to Key West, where Hemingway made his home. There is water 
on either side of the road and plenty of beautiful beaches to stop at. The 
distance is 106 miles, but we will take three days, since we want to do plenty 
of swimming and other water sports. The entire trip is on US 1. We begin in 
Florida City and head south. 
We stop in Key Largo for some snorkeling and then have lunch. Cait has 
already selected a Subway Restaurant right along US 1 in Key Largo. She has 
checked the nutritional information, which is pretty complete. Subway very 
nicely lists their food by grams of fat. In the 6-grams-of-fat or less column, 

285
 Chapter 18: Fast Food on Your Itinerary
there are plenty of sandwiches to choose from. The only problem is that they 
all have a fair amount of sodium. 
Cait suggests we share a sandwich, and you suggest we buy two sandwiches 
and cut them in three pieces, then each have two of the pieces. Great idea! 
That reduces both the calories and the salt by 1⁄3. But we can’t get the foot-
long sandwiches, which just have too much salt, even if we share them. You 
like the 6-inch Sweet Onion Chicken Teriyaki, and Cait likes the 6-inch Veggie 
Delite. I like everything. Not bad at all and no trans fats. The total we each 
end up with is about 200 kilocalories with 33g of carbohydrate, 17g of pro­
tein, and 3g of fat.
We continue to Tavernier, where we stop at the Florida Keys Wild Bird 
Rehabilitation Center and then go on to Lignumvitae Key Botanical State 
Park, to which we take a boat. Finally we arrive in Long Key, where we are 
staying, and have dinner at the hotel.
The following morning we do some snorkeling and then head to Grassy Key 
in the city of Marathon, where we visit the Dolphin Research Center. We 
are all hungry for some breakfast, so Cait suggests the IHOP along US 1 in 
Marathon.
Cait suggests either a couple of buttermilk pancakes, a couple of harvest 
grain ’n nut pancakes, a couple of buckwheat pancakes, or a waffle. Each of 
these contains about 225 kilocalories with 6g of fat and 34g of carbohydrate. 
Of course, we have to have some pancake syrup but go very light on this. 
Still, it adds another 115 kilocalories from 29g of carbohydrate. Four ounces 
of orange juice adds an additional 15g of carbohydrate. I drink tea, but you 
and Cait have your morning coffee.
We continue to Bahia Honda Key and the Bahia Honda State Park for some 
hiking. We follow the road a few more miles to Big Pine Key, where we are 
staying, and have dinner and breakfast in our hotel.
Next morning we continue to Key West, where we visit the Hemingway Home 
and Museum and the Mel Fisher Maritime Museum, which houses a fascinat­
ing collection of artifacts from the sunken Spanish galleon, Atocha. Then it’s 
off to Mallory Square to celebrate the sunset.

Discovering Where FDR and 
Eleanor Hung Out: Maine
Franklin Delano Roosevelt, our 32nd president, loved to stay at Campobello 
Island in Maine. You, Cait, and I begin this trip on US 1 in West Gouldsboro, 
Maine about 1,800 miles from the same US 1 we just took to Key West. The 
distance is 100 miles, but there are lots of detours and plenty of things to do, 
so we will stay one night along the way.
We head out on US 1 to Columbia Falls, where we visit the Ruggles House, an 
old mansion with plenty of interesting architecture. North of Columbia Falls 
we take Route 187 to Jonesport and visit Great Wass Island for hiking, ocean 
views, and wildlife. Route 187 takes us back to US 1 and on to Machias. 
We find the Dunkin’ Donuts that Cait has discovered. Of course, we are going 
to bypass the 500 kilocalorie cookies, the 620 kilocalorie Coffee Cake Muffin, 
and the 300 to 500-plus kilocalorie donuts. What self-control! Instead we are 
each having one of the Oven Roasted Flatbread Sandwiches that does not 

287
 Chapter 18: Fast Food on Your Itinerary
contain cheese, like the Southwest Chicken, the Egg White Veggie, or the Egg 
White Turkey at around 300 kilocalories, 9g of fat, and 38g of carbohydrate. 
When we finish, Cait tells us we have followed the program so well that we 
can share any donut three ways. What a treat!
We stay overnight in Machias and leave on Route 191 for some driving 
along the coast, rejoining US 1 after a while. Not far away is Quoddy Head 
State Park, which happens to be the easternmost point in the country. After 
some viewing and hiking, we head back to Route 189 to Lubec. Lubec has no 
fast-food restaurants, according to Cait, so we splurge at Murphy’s Village 
Restaurant, where the food is good, the service is good, and the people are 
friendly. Sorry, I won’t tell you what we had there!
We cross the Franklin Roosevelt Memorial Bridge over to Campobello. We 
stop at the Visitor Center, and then we visit the Roosevelt Cottage. The so-
called Cottage is 34 rooms and there is plenty of FDR history to be seen.

Part IV
The Part of Tens

In this part . . .
I
n the chapters in this part, I provide ten steps to 
improve your eating habits and ten food substitutions 
that you can easily make within a recipe. You can explore 
ten strategies to normalize your blood glucose and ten 
ways to promote healthy eating in children.

Chapter 19
Ten (or So) Simple Steps to Change 
Your Eating Habits
In This Chapter
▶	Keeping a food diary and discovering the reasons behind your behavior
▶	Making time and sitting down for all meals
▶	Using water and vegetables for many purposes
▶	Cooking with half the fat (and stripping it away)
▶	Flavoring with condiments, herbs, and spices instead of salt
▶	Sticking to the b’s — braising, broiling, boiling, and barbecuing
F
ollowing a nutritional plan sometimes seems so complicated. But really, 
if you follow the few simple rules outlined in this chapter, you can make 
the process much easier. This chapter provides you with ten (or so) simple 
things you can do today. None of them cost anything other than time. Doing 
them one at a time makes a big difference in your calorie and fat intake. 
Adding one after another makes the results huge. Your weight, blood pres­
sure, and blood glucose all fall. Who could ask for anything more?
Maintaining a Food Diary
Try this little diversion: For the next two days, write down everything you 
eat and drink. Before you go to bed on the evening of the second day, take a 
separate piece of paper and try to reconstruct what you have eaten for the 
past two days without looking at your original list. Then compare the two 
lists. The differences in the lists will startle you. The point of this exercise 
is to show you that you’re doing a lot of mindless eating. Trying to follow a 
nutritional plan from memory doesn’t work.

292
Part IV: The Part of Tens 
A food diary not only shows you what you’re eating all the time but also 
makes it easy to select items to reduce in portion size or eliminate altogether. 
When you go to your doctor, the fact that your diary lists birdseed for every 
meal helps confirm your statement that you eat like a bird.
	
You might even want to include something in your diary about how you’re 
feeling and what you’re doing. This information, besides turning your diary 
into a more personal statement, allows you to see the associations between 
your mood and your food. Keeping your exercise record in the diary makes it 
even more useful, reminding you of when you did (or did not) exercise.
Finally, your dietitian can easily plug your food intake into a computer pro­
gram to analyze such valuable information as calorie breakdown, amount of 
salt, levels of saturated fat, and amount of cholesterol.
Figuring Out Why You 
Eat the Way You Do
You may recognize that you do a lot of your eating for emotional reasons. Try 
to remember how you ate in your family as you were growing up. What did 
eating mean to you and your family? Was it a way of connecting with others 
in the family, or was it used in some other way? Does eating trigger feelings 
that you want to have again and that make you feel happy or good in some 
other way? Or do you associate eating with negative emotions? Do you eat 
the way you do out of loneliness, boredom, depression, happiness, or anger; 
as a reward; or as a way to save time? You may come up with several rea­
sons, but you need to understand them and begin to respond to those trig­
gers with other actions besides eating.
After you begin to clarify the emotional aspect of your eating, you can look 
for ways to have the same emotions without the eating part of it. What are 
other things you can do to feel happy or connected? Do you eat out of bore­
dom? What can you do to keep yourself from being bored?
This sounds like psychology, and it is. You may have to seek the help of 
a psychologist to find out exactly what eating means to you. Meanwhile, 
because that type of counseling is often a long process, try doing the other 
things recommended in this chapter to gain control of your eating.
	
All habits, including eating habits, come from repetition. Every time you do 
something the same way, it encourages you to do it the same way the next 
time. By breaking the chain, you can make healthful changes. Here are some 
things you can do right now until you figure out why you eat:

293
 Chapter 19: Ten (or So) Simple Steps to Change Your Eating Habits
	
✓	Never eat and do something else at the same time, such as watch TV.
	
✓	Eat in only one place in your home, preferably at the table, your desig­
nated eating place.
	
✓	Eat on smaller plates.
	
✓	Never eat from the bag, the container, or the carton.
	
✓	Chew your food slowly and pick up all food with utensils, not fingers, 
after you’ve swallowed the previous bite.
	
✓	Always leave food on your plate to develop the habit of stopping eating 
when you’re full.
	
✓	Keep food only in the kitchen and out of sight, not on counters.
	
✓	Avoid junk food that has no nutritional value but only calories.
	
✓	Eat three meals and even a couple of healthy snacks every day.
	
✓	Select a healthy alternative to eating, such as exercise, a creative hobby, 
or even conversations with your spouse.
	
✓	Choose non-food rewards, such as new clothes for your new shape.
Perform one of these actions at a time. When you’ve made that action a part 
of your behavior, try a second action. Build up to many changes. You’ll be 
delighted with the results.
Eating Every Meal
When you miss meals, you become hungry. If you have type 1 diabetes, you 
can’t safely miss meals, especially if you give yourself regular or lispro insu­
lin. Instead of letting yourself become hungry, eat your meals at regular times 
so that you don’t overcompensate at the next meal (or at a snack shortly 
after the meal you missed) when you’re suffering from low blood glucose. 
Many people overtreat low blood glucose by eating too many sugar calories, 
resulting in high blood glucose later on.
	
You should not miss meals as a weight-loss method, particularly if you take a 
drug that lowers blood glucose into hypoglycemic levels. A pregnant woman 
with diabetes especially should not miss meals. She must make up for the fact 
that her baby extracts large amounts of glucose from her blood. Both mother 
and growing fetus are adversely affected if the mother’s body must turn to 
stored fat for energy.

294
Part IV: The Part of Tens 
Eating smaller meals and having snacks in between is probably the best way 
to eat because doing so raises blood glucose the least, provides a constant 
source of energy, and allows control of the blood glucose using the least 
amount of external or internal insulin.
The fact is, following your complete nutritional plan in fewer than three 
meals is extremely difficult.
Sitting Down for Meals
Eating food with others is one of the pleasures of life. As an added advantage, 
it also slows the pace of your eating, which allows your brain to recognize 
when you’re full so you stop eating at the appropriate time. By sitting down 
and eating more slowly, you slow the absorption of carbohydrates, thus slow­
ing the rise in your blood glucose.
Another advantage of sitting down and eating with others is that they serve 
as a brake on how much you eat. When people eat alone, they tend to eat 
more. In the company of others, you’re restrained by social controls. By 
eating while sitting at the table, you see only the food on the table. When you 
stand and eat, you can easily walk to the kitchen, where all the rest of the 
food is (if you’re not there already).
You usually limit the food served at the table to what is on your plate, so 
you aren’t exposed to excessive food. You can make sure that the only foods 
brought to the table are acceptable food choices, especially if they’re pre­
pared as attractively as possible. A lot of your eating is done because the 
food looks so good, so make the right foods the best-looking foods.
Drinking Water throughout the Day
Seventy percent of your body is water, and all your many organs and cells 
require water to function properly. Most people, especially older people, 
don’t get enough water. Older people often have the additional disadvantage 
of losing their ability to sense when they’re thirsty. The consequences may 
include weakness and fatigue, not to mention constipation.
Water can replace all the sodas and juice drinks that add unwanted calories 
to your day. You soon lose your taste for those drinks and discover that 
you don’t need (or miss) the aftertaste of soda and juice that you took for 
granted. Those drinks also raise the blood glucose very rapidly and are often 
used to treat low blood glucose.

295
 Chapter 19: Ten (or So) Simple Steps to Change Your Eating Habits
	
One of our patients admitted to drinking 10 to 12 cans of cola drinks daily. 
He had a high blood glucose that returned to normal when he broke his cola 
habit.
Make drinking water a part of your daily habits. Drink some when you brush 
your teeth. Drink more with meals and snacks. Many people don’t want to 
drink much water close to bedtime because if they do, they’ll have to get 
up during the night to go to the bathroom — all the more reason to make 
sure you get your daily water ration, which should be at least eight 8-ounce 
glasses, early in the day.
Consuming Vegetables 
throughout the Day
What makes you think that you can use broccoli only as a side dish with 
your dinner meat or fish? How can you possibly get in your daily three to five 
servings of vegetables if you think like this? What would happen if you drank 
vegetable juice for breakfast? Suppose you added vegetables to an omelet? 
How about a salad at lunch instead of that large sandwich containing way too 
much carbohydrate?
You can find so many different kinds of vegetables in the grocery, yet most 
people limit themselves to very few of them. Your whole meal can consist of 
vegetables with a small amount of protein thrown in just as a garnish. Try 
a vegetarian restaurant to see for yourself how delicious freshly prepared 
vegetables can be.
We’re not talking about the starchy vegetables, such as beans, peas, and 
lentils that really belong in the starch list of exchanges, but rather the vegeta­
bles that contain much less carbohydrate. These vegetables include aspara­
gus, bok choy, green beans, cabbage, carrots, cauliflower, chard, collards, 
onions, summer squash, turnips, and water chestnuts.
Use these vegetables in meals and for snacks. They fill you up but add very 
few calories. Some are just as good when frozen and defrosted (because they 
are flash frozen immediately after picking) as they are when fresh. Especially 
good snack vegetables include baby carrots, cucumbers, and pieces of sweet 
pepper.

Part IV: The Part of Tens 
Reducing Added Fat
If you use recipes that have been handed down in your family, they often con­
tain much unnecessary added fat. The same can be said for recipes created 
by chefs who aren’t conscious of the harmful effects of high fat intake. We 
carefully selected the recipes in this book to minimize added fat. You should 
try to do the same thing when you cook.
Cooking food doesn’t generally require the extra fat. We can remember when a 
pancake recipe required a cup of vegetable oil, but we now know that you can 
make delicious pancakes without all that oil. Although vegetable oil is better 
for you than animal fats like lard and butter, it still has plenty of calories — in 
fact, as many as animal fats. A gram of fat contains 9 kilocalories, no matter the 
source.
Try reducing the suggested fat by 50 percent. See whether the taste suffers or 
if preparing the food is more difficult.
	
How much difference does reducing the fat make in terms of kilocalories? A 
cup of oil is 8 ounces, and each ounce is 28.35 grams. Because each gram has 
9 kilocalories, a cup of oil contains about 2,000 kilocalories. You get rid of 
1,000 kcalories by reducing the fat in half. If your recipe serves four people, 
each person is getting 250 kilocalories less fat. Is that a worthwhile reduction? 
You bet!
Chapter 20 is full of great substitutions.
Removing the Attached Fat
Many foods, such as sausage and luncheon meats, contain so much fat that 
lowering their fat content isn’t possible. You should mostly avoid these 
foods. But other protein sources, such as chicken, steak, roast beef, and 
pork, have large amounts of visible fat attached to them, so you can remove 
this fat before you prepare the food. In the case of poultry, removing the 
skin removes most of the fat. Selecting white meat rather than dark further 
reduces the fat in poultry.
As fat cooks on a grill, it often flames, which causes the meat to burn. 
Removing the fat before you cook it makes the cooking process safer 
(because the burning fat won’t spray around), and the resulting meat 
is much lower in calories.

297
 Chapter 19: Ten (or So) Simple Steps to Change Your Eating Habits
Leaving Out the Salt
For reasons that are unclear to us, most Americans like a lot of salt in their 
food. Consequently, these people taste mostly salt and not much of the food. 
Try getting rid of the salt in your recipes. You can always add it later if you 
miss the flavor that salt adds. At first, you may think that the food tastes 
bland. Then you’ll begin to discover the subtle tastes that were in the food 
all along but were overpowered by the salt.
Why do we emphasize cutting salt levels? We know that salt raises blood 
pressure. Recent studies, particularly the United Kingdom Prospective 
Diabetes Study, which was a major breakthrough published in 1998, have 
shown that you can slow or prevent diabetic complications by reducing 
blood pressure.
	
You can try the approach of slowly removing salt from the recipe. If it calls for 
a teaspoon of salt, add only 3⁄4 teaspoon. You won’t notice the difference. Next 
time, try 1⁄2 teaspoon. And so on. In the recipes in this book, we have tried to 
use less salt wherever possible, with the permission of the chefs who created 
the recipes. Most chefs have been very open to eliminating salt.
Adding Taste with Condiments, 
Herbs, and Spices
This section explores a case of getting something for almost nothing. If you 
like a lot of distinctive flavors in your food, try using various condiments, 
herbs, and spices to replace the flavors of fat and salt. Experimenting with 
these flavors can bring entirely new tastes to old favorite recipes. Surely, the 
new millennium is all about breaking free from old habits of eating, which 
may not be so good for you, and replacing them with new tastes.
Many of the chefs in this book — who are some of the most renowned chefs 
in the world — have achieved their fame by virtue of their willingness to go 
in new taste directions. They have combined foods that no one put together 
before and used spices not traditionally used in foods from their particular 
ethnic origin. The result has been an explosion of new tastes combined with 
better nutrition.
Foods that you associate with bland taste, such as some fish, come alive 
when you add the right herbs and spices. You may never have liked those 
foods before, but you will now. Not only do they taste different, but they 
smell wonderful and exotic. They have the additional advantage of being very 
good for you.

298
Part IV: The Part of Tens 
Examples of condiments that add great taste and few calories are salsa, hot 
sauce, mustard, and horseradish. Herbs that add flavor include rosemary, 
thyme, and basil. They are best added toward the end of cooking to preserve 
their flavor if fresh, or at the beginning of cooking to bring out their flavor if 
dried.
Cooking by the B’s
The best methods of cooking all begin with a b, such as braising, broiling, 
boiling, and barbecuing. These methods of preparation don’t add fat and 
often remove a lot of the fat within the food. Broiling a hamburger, for exam­
ple, often eliminates as much fat from a moderate-fat hamburger as buying 
a reduced-fat hamburger to begin with. Frying, sautéing, and other methods 
that depend on butter or fat add exactly the things that you want to remove.
If you must use fat, use a cooking spray that reduces the amount of added fat.

Ten Easy Vegetarian Substitutions 
In This Chapter
▶	Replacing meat
▶	Substituting for milk
▶	Enjoying cheese in another form
You will be surprised at how easy it is to eliminate meat and dairy and 
substitute with something just as delicious. Sometimes the food will 
taste different, so you have to try different vegetable products to see what 
works best. You may even find that the taste of the food when vegetable 
sources are used is better than when animal sources are used. It takes getting 
used to, but the advantages for your health are worth the effort.
Take a good look at the vegetarian recipes in this book. They show you that 
vegetarian cooking is just as complex and interesting as cooking with meat, 
fish, or poultry. If you try several of them, as Cait and Dr. Rubin did, you will 
find that they are just as delicious as the non-vegetarian recipes.	
Using Several Foods for Animal Protein
There are a number of vegetarian foods that can take the place of meat, 
depending on what you feel like eating. Baked portobello mushrooms can 
taste amazingly close to a steak with the same texture and juiciness. Tofu can 
replace chicken in lots of dishes, especially stir-fried food. 
Textured vegetable protein (TVP) is made from soy. It comes in small dry 
chunks that resemble dried vegetables. It cooks quickly, supplying vegetable 
protein without fat. You can use TVP to replace meat in soups and stews. It is 
available in large supermarkets and natural food stores.

300
Part IV: The Part of Tens 
Eggplant and mushrooms are other vegetables that replace meat with ease, 
especially in the southern United States. Eggplant can be stuffed, roasted, 
marinated, grilled, even fried (not recommended). Combine it with tomato 
and onions and you have ratatouille.
Spilling the Beans
	
You know that your muscles are made of protein, so naturally when you think 
of protein, you think of meat. The time has come to recognize that protein 
comes from many sources, however. Vegetables have proteins, too, and they 
don’t have the fat that meats provide.
People have suggested that you can’t eat only vegetable protein sources 
because they lack some of the building blocks required for muscle growth, 
and that you can find those building blocks only in animal protein. As always, 
an exception breaks that rule: the soybean. Soybeans contain all the different 
building blocks you need to build your own protein.
Even without soybeans, you can get all the building blocks you need by 
eating several different vegetable protein sources together, such as rice and 
beans or yogurt with chopped nuts.
The best nonmeat sources of protein are legumes like dried beans and peas. 
Other protein sources include nuts and seeds, but they contain quite a bit of 
fat, so the calorie count swells. The following vegetable protein sources pro­
vide the equivalent of an ounce of animal protein:
	
✓	1⁄4 cup of seeds (like sunflower seeds)
	
✓	1⁄3 cup of nuts (like pecans and peanuts)
	
✓	1⁄2 cup of cooked dry beans
	
✓	1⁄2 cup of baked beans
	
✓	1⁄2 cup of tofu
Avoiding Meat and Chicken Stock
Soup recipes need a stock usually, and most of them call for meat or chicken 
stock. Vegetable stock will fill the bill very well, though you will get a change 
in taste. You’ll also probably get much less salt. But vegetable stock is not 
the only thing you can use. Garlic broth can be made to do the job. The ingre­
dients for 8 cups of garlic broth are:

301
 Chapter 20: Ten Easy Vegetarian Substitutions
	
✓	3 small heads of garlic, smashed and peeled
	
✓	1 tablespoon of olive oil
	
✓	Coarse salt to taste
	
✓	Freshly ground pepper to taste
	
✓	9 cups of water
You can also use water or wine with 1 to 2 tablespoons of soy sauce per cup 
of liquid. There is no need to use meat or chicken stock again.
Replacing Cheeses
If you want to go the vegan way and avoid dairy, there are lots of ways to 
replace the cheeses that you commonly use in recipes. Here are some 
suggestions:
	
✓	There are vegan cheeses available in supermarkets that taste just like 
cheddar cheese, mozzarella, and Monterey jack.
	
✓	Crumbled tofu can take the place of cottage cheese and ricotta cheese.
	
✓	Tofu cream cheese can replace regular cream cheese.
They can be used on pizzas, in sauces, and anything that requires melting 
cheese.
Avoiding Cow’s Milk
This is an easy one. Soy milk is an excellent replacement for cow’s milk. It is 
made by cleaning and soaking soy beans overnight, then puréeing them. The 
solids are strained out, and the liquid is boiled for ten minutes. You can buy 
soy milk right next to cow’s milk in the market. Some of the benefits include:
	
✓	It has more protein and fiber than cow’s milk.
	
✓	It has isoflavones, chemicals that are thought to prevent cancers, heart 
disease, and osteoporosis.
	
✓	It has about 2 percent fat but no cholesterol.
	
✓	Older women can use soy milk to reduce menopausal symptoms, espe­
cially hot flashes.

302
Part IV: The Part of Tens 
	
Soy milk does not have calcium like cow’s milk so you will need to get your 
calcium elsewhere. Almonds, beans, and green leafy vegetables are good 
sources.
Choosing to Replace Milk Chocolate
Dark chocolate has flavonols, which are antioxidants that may be protective 
against cancer, but milk chocolate does not have the same benefits because 
the proteins in the milk bind the flavonols so they are unavailable. Chocolate 
also has caffeine. Since cocoa, the basis for chocolate, is naturally bitter, high 
fructose corn syrup and refined sugar as well as fats are added to sweeten it.
Carob is a naturally sweet, caffeine-free substitute. It comes from the fruit 
pods of carob trees found in the Middle East and the Mediterranean. The 
beans are dried, roasted, and ground to make carob powder. Carob powder 
is high in fiber, unlike chocolate. But don’t think that carob is for dieting. 
When it is used to make candies and so forth, it can contain just as many 
calories as chocolate.
Avoiding Mayonnaise
A tablespoon of mayonnaise has 49 kilocalories, most of which is fat, though 
not necessarily the bad saturated fat. People tend to put a lot of mayonnaise 
on sandwiches, adding 49 kilocalories for each tablespoon, so it doesn’t take 
long to add a lot of calories just from this condiment. 
Instead of standard mayonnaise, try tofu mayonnaise:
	
✓	1 clove garlic
	
✓	8 ounces tofu, drained
	
✓	2 tablespoons fresh lemon juice
	
✓	1 tablespoon olive oil
	
✓	1 teaspoon Dijon mustard
	
✓	Sea salt
Blend together for 25 seconds until smooth. Makes 1 cup.
Now you can enjoy the taste of mayonnaise with far fewer calories.

303
 Chapter 20: Ten Easy Vegetarian Substitutions
Banishing Eggs
There are plenty of substitutes for eggs. The substitutes don’t have the fat 
found in the standard mayonnaise, but they can be used for baking. You can’t 
use the substitutes, however, for replacing more than 2 eggs in a recipe. It 
won’t work. Here are some substitutes you can use for 1 egg:
	
✓	11⁄2 teaspoons commercial powdered egg replacer
	
✓	1 mashed small ripe banana
	
✓	1⁄4 cup blended soft tofu
	
✓	1 cup unsweetened applesauce
	
✓	1⁄4 cup pureed prunes
You want to experiment a little and see how the substitute tastes compared 
with an egg. It may even be better in many recipes.
Avoiding Sour Cream
Sour cream is only mildly sour but it is full of fats. It contains 14 grams of 
butterfat in a 4-ounce serving. That’s saturated fat (bad fat) we are talking 
about. If you are trying to stay vegetarian, you can’t use yogurt, which would 
make a low fat substitute. But you can use tofu sour cream. Here’s a fat free 
recipe that makes delicious tofu sour cream:
	
✓	10.5-ounce package of light firm tofu
	
✓	4 teaspoons lemon juice
	
✓	2 teaspoons apple cider vinegar
	
✓	1 teaspoon sweetener
	
✓	1⁄2 teaspoon salt
Process in a blender until creamy and smooth. You’ll get all the taste without 
the fat.

Enjoying Non-Dairy Ice Cream
Wouldn’t you know, the food merchants have given us all kinds of choices for 
people who want ice cream without dairy. Some of the choices include:
	
✓	Gelato
	
✓	Sorbet
	
✓	Dairy-free ice cream sandwiches
	
✓	Fudge popsicles
The best are soy-based. There are also plenty of recipes to be found on the 
Internet for making your own. Just put “vegetarian ice cream” in the search 
box of your favorite Web browser. Or pick up a book called “The Vegan 
Scoop: 150 Recipes for Dairy-Free Ice Cream” by Wheeler del Torro.

Ten Strategies to Normalize 
Your Blood Glucose
In This Chapter
▶	Knowing your blood glucose level
▶	Exercising and taking medications to stay in control
▶	Reacting immediately to foot and dental problems
▶	Keeping a positive attitude while planning for unexpected situations
▶	Staying aware of new developments and using expert help
▶	Avoiding methods that don’t work
I
n Diabetes For Dummies, 2nd Edition, we describe the management of 
diabetes in detail. In this chapter, you find the highlights of that extensive 
discussion. Although this book is about eating, controlling your blood glu­
cose requires much more from you. Everything we suggest is directed toward 
normalizing your blood glucose.
	
Doctors consider your blood glucose normal when it’s less than 100 mg/dl 
(5.5 mmol/L) if you’ve eaten nothing for 8 to 12 hours. If you’ve eaten, your 
blood glucose is normal if it’s less than 140 mg/dl (7.8 mmol/L) two hours after 
eating. If you never see a blood glucose level higher than 140, you’re doing 
very well, indeed. See Chapter 1 for a full explanation of mg/dl (milligrams per 
deciliter) and mmol/L (millimoles per liter).
You can use many tricks to achieve this level of control. In this chapter, you 
find the best of the lot. All of our patients can remember receiving and using 
some advice that made a huge difference in their lives with diabetes. If you 
have a tip that you want to share, please send an e-mail to drrubin@
drrubin.com. We’ll try to get it into the next edition of this book.

306
Part IV: The Part of Tens 
Knowing Your Blood Glucose
No excuse is adequate for you to not know your blood glucose at all times, 
although we’ve heard some pretty far-out excuses over the years — close to 
“The dog ate my glucose meter.” The ability to measure blood glucose accu­
rately and rapidly is the greatest advance in diabetes care since the discov­
ery of insulin. Yet many people don’t track their blood glucose.
Sure, sticking your finger hurts, but laser devices now make it painless, and 
even the needles are so fine that you barely feel them. How can you know 
what to do about your blood glucose if you don’t know what it is in the first 
place?
The number of glucose meters you can choose is vast, and they’re all good. 
Your insurance company may prefer one type of meter, or your doctor may 
have computer hardware and software for only one type. Other than those 
limitations, the choice is yours.
	
If you have very stable blood glucose levels, test once a day — some days 
in the morning before breakfast, other days in the evening before supper. 
Varying the time of day you test your blood glucose gives you and your doctor 
a clearer picture of your control under different circumstances. If your diabe­
tes requires insulin or is unstable, you need to test at least before meals and 
at bedtime in order to select your insulin dose.
Painless devices for measuring blood glucose are right around the corner. 
The closeness of this great advance is a particularly good reason to keep 
aware of new developments (see “Becoming Aware of New Developments” 
later in this chapter about tracking advancements).
Using Exercise to Control Your Glucose
When people are asked how much exercise they do, about a third say that 
they do nothing at all. If you’re a person with diabetes and consider yourself 
a part of that group that doesn’t exercise, then you aren’t taking advantage 
of a major tool — not just for controlling your blood glucose but also for 
improving your physical and mental state in general. When a large group of 
people who were expected to develop diabetes because both parents had 
diabetes participated in a regular exercise program in one recent study, 80 
percent who stayed on the program didn’t develop diabetes.

307
 Chapter 21: Ten Strategies to Normalize Your Blood Glucose
Don’t think that exercise means hours of exhaustion followed by a period of 
recovery. We’re talking about a brisk walk, lasting no more than 60 minutes, 
every day and not necessarily all at once. If you want to do more, that’s fine, 
but just about anyone can do this much. People who can’t walk for some 
reason can get their exercise by moving their arms. To lose weight as a result 
of exercise, you need to do 90 minutes a day, every day.
Exercise can provide several benefits to your overall health. Exercise does 
the following:
	
✓	Lowers the blood glucose by using it for energy
	
✓	Helps with weight loss
	
✓	Lowers bad cholesterol and triglyceride fats and raises good cholesterol
	
✓	Lowers blood pressure
	
✓	Reduces stress levels
	
✓	Reduces the need for drugs and insulin shots
When we see a new person with diabetes, we give him or her a bottle of pills. 
These pills aren’t to be taken by mouth; they’re to be spilled on the floor and 
picked up every day. It’s our way of making sure that a new patient gets at 
least a little exercise every day.
Taking Your Medications
You have the advantage of having some of the best drugs for diabetes avail­
able to you, which wasn’t true as recently as ten years ago. A few years ago, 
as specialists in diabetes, we struggled to keep our patients in good control 
to avoid complications of diabetes. Now, with the right combination of medi­
cations (and by using some of the other tools in this chapter), just about any 
patient can achieve excellent control. But no medication works if you don’t 
take it.
The word compliance applies here. Compliance refers to the willingness of 
people to follow instructions — specifically, taking their medications. People 
tend to be very compliant at the beginning of treatment, but as they improve, 
compliance falls off. Diabetic control falls off along with it.
The fact is, as you get older, the forces that contribute to a worsening of 
your blood glucose tend to get stronger. You want to do all you can to 
reverse that tendency. Taking your medications is an essential part of 
your overall program.

308
Part IV: The Part of Tens 
If you’re confused by all the medications you take, get yourself a medica­
tion box that holds each day’s medications in separate compartments so 
you make sure the compartment for each day is empty by the next day. Any 
doctor who prescribes more than two medicines to you should be able to get 
one for you, and you can definitely get them in drugstores.
Seeking Immediate Help 
for Foot Problems
	
One error that leads to a lot of grief in diabetes is failure to seek immedi­
ate help for any foot problems. Your doctor may see you and examine your 
feet only once in two or three months. You need to look at your feet every 
day. At the first sign of any skin breakdown or other abnormality (such as 
discoloration), you must see your doctor. In diabetes, foot problems can go 
from minor to major in a very brief time. We don’t pull punches in this area, 
because seeing your doctor is so important — major problems may mean 
amputation of toes or more. (See Chapter 1 for more information about foot 
problems as they relate to diabetes.)
You can reverse most foot problems, if you catch and treat them early. You 
may require a different shoe or need to keep weight off the foot for a time — 
minor inconveniences compared to an amputation.
Besides inspecting your feet daily, here are some other actions you can take:
	
✓	Testing bath water with your hands to check its temperature, because 
numb feet can’t sense if the water is scalding hot
	
✓	Ensuring that nothing is inside your shoe before you put it on
	
✓	Wearing new shoes only a short time before checking for damage
Taking immediate action goes for any infection you develop as a diabetic. 
Infections raise the blood glucose while you’re sick. Try to avoid taking steroids 
for anything if you possibly can. Steroids really make the glucose shoot up.
Brushing Off Dental Problems
Keeping your teeth in excellent condition is important, but especially if you 
have diabetes. “Excellent condition” means brushing them twice a day and 
using dental floss at the end of the day to reach where the toothbrush never 
goes. It also means visits to the dentist on a regular basis for cleaning and 
examination.

309
 Chapter 21: Ten Strategies to Normalize Your Blood Glucose
We have seen many people with diabetes have dental problems as a result of 
poor dental hygiene. As a side effect, controlling the blood glucose is much 
harder. After patients cure their teeth, they require much less medication.
People with diabetes don’t have more cavities than non-diabetics, but they do 
have more gum disease if their glucose isn’t under control. Gum disease results 
from the high glucose that bathes the mouth — a perfect medium for bacteria. 
Keeping your glucose under control helps you avoid losing teeth as a result of 
gum disease, as well as the further deterioration in glucose control.
Maintaining a Positive Attitude
Your mental approach to your diabetes plays a major role in determining 
your success in controlling the disease. Think of diabetes as a challenge — 
like high school math or asking out your first date. As you overcome chal­
lenges in one area of your life, the skills you master help you in other areas. 
Looking at something as a challenge allows you to use all your creativity.
When you approach something with pessimism and negativity, you tend to 
not see all the possible ways you can succeed. You may take the attitude that 
“It doesn’t matter what I do.” That attitude leads to failure to take medica­
tions, failure to eat properly, failure to exercise, and so forth.
Simply understanding the workings of your body, which comes with treat­
ing your diabetes, probably makes you healthier than the couch potato who 
understands little more than the most recent sitcom.
	
Some people do get depressed when they find out they have diabetes. If you’re 
depressed and your depression isn’t improving after several weeks, consider 
seeking professional help.
Planning for the Unexpected
Life is full of surprises — like when you were told you have diabetes. You 
probably weren’t ready to hear that news. But you can make yourself ready 
to deal with surprises that may damage your glucose control.
Most of those surprises have to do with food. You may be offered the wrong 
kind of food, too much food, or too little food, or the timing of food doesn’t 
correspond to the requirements of your medication. You need to have plans 
for all these situations before they occur.

310
Part IV: The Part of Tens 
You can always reduce your portions when the food is the wrong kind or 
excessive, and you can carry portable calories (like glucose tablets) when 
food is insufficient or delayed.
Other surprises have to do with your medication, like leaving it in your 
luggage — which is on its way to Europe while you’re headed to Hawaii. 
Keep your important medications with you in your carry-on luggage, not in 
checked luggage. Again, your ability to think ahead can prevent you from 
ever being separated from your medication.
Not everything is going to go right all the time. However, you can minimize 
the damage by planning ahead.
Becoming Aware of New Developments
The pace of new discoveries in diabetes is so rapid that keeping on top of the 
field is difficult even for us, the experts. How much more difficult must it be 
for you? You don’t have access to all the publications, the drug company rep­
resentatives, and the medical journals that we see every day.
However, you can keep current in a number of ways. The following tips can 
help you stay up-to-date on all the advances:
	
✓	Begin by taking a course in diabetes from a certified diabetes educator. 
Such a course gives you a basis for a future understanding of advances 
in diabetes. The American Diabetes Association (www.diabetes.org) 
provides the names of certified diabetes educators.
	
✓	Get a copy of Dr. Rubin’s book Diabetes For Dummies, 2nd Edition

 Chapter 21: Ten Strategies to Normalize Your Blood Glucose
Utilizing the Experts
The available knowledge about diabetes is huge and growing rapidly. 
Fortunately, you can turn to multiple people for help. Take advantage of them 
all at one time or another, including the following people:
	
✓	Your primary physician, who takes care of diabetes and all your other 
medical concerns
	
✓	A diabetes specialist, who is aware of the latest and greatest in diabetes 
treatment
	
✓	An eye doctor, who must examine you at least once a year
	
✓	A foot doctor, to trim your toenails and treat foot problems
	
✓	A dietitian, to help you plan your nutritional program
	
✓	A diabetes educator, to teach you a basic understanding of this disease
	
✓	A pharmacist, who can help you understand your medications
	
✓	A mental health worker, if you run into adjustment problems
Take advantage of any or all of these people when you need them. Most 
insurance companies are enlightened enough to pay for them if you use 
them.
Avoiding What Doesn’t Work
Not wasting your time and money on worthless treatments is important. 
When you consider the almost 20 million people with diabetes in the United 
States alone, they provide a huge potential market for people with “the latest 
wonder cure for diabetes.” Before you waste your money, check out the 
claims of these crooks with your diabetes experts.
You can find plenty of treatments for diabetes on the Internet. One way you 
can be sure that the claims are based on science is to look for verification 
from the Health on the Net Foundation, which you can find at www.hon.ch/
HomePage/Home-Page.html. Its stamp of approval means the site adheres 
to principles that every legitimate scientist agrees with.
Don’t make any substantial changes in your diabetes management without 
first discussing them with your physician.

Chapter 22
Ten Ways to Encourage Children 
to Eat More Fruits and Vegetables
In This Chapter
▶	Growing and preparing vegetables with the child
▶	Selecting the right recipes
▶	Making healthful substitutions
C
hildren don’t hate vegetables any more than they hate ice cream. It is 
what we teach them that determines their feelings about food. If we 
show them that we love vegetables and consider them delicious, that’s how 
they will feel about vegetables. They love to follow our example.
Fruit is no problem. Try taking a bowl of sweet strawberries, blueberries, 
or raspberries away from a small child! It’s not quite as dangerous as taking 
a bone from a dog, but close. Most children have a natural love for sweet. 
There is nothing like a sweet peach or nectarine to excite a child. Just try to 
get ripe fruit, not the too-early-picked, hard-as-a-rock, tart stuff that passes 
for fruit in many markets.
There are numerous things you can do to encourage your child to eat vegeta­
bles. In this chapter, I will provide just ten. I am sure you can come up with a 
few others.
One thing I don’t encourage is this idea of concealing the vegetables from the 
child. The message you send is that vegetables are so unpleasant that you 
have to fool the child to get him to eat them, exactly the message that will 
lead to a life of avoiding vegetables.

314
Part IV: The Part of Tens 
Starting Early
Children learn their eating habits at a very young age, age 2 or even younger. 
From the time they can eat solid or even semi-solid food, they should be 
given choices of vegetables. I do not recommend using bottled vegetables, 
since they are often filled with salt and sugar, but rather making the vegeta­
bles into small portions yourself.
Give the child the vegetable to eat by itself, not with a choice of fatty things 
or sweet things that he will gravitate towards. Do not threaten that the “good 
stuff” comes only after the vegetables are eaten. Vegetables must be seen as 
part of the good stuff.
And, of course, set an example. Let him see you eating and enjoying the veg­
etables. The message will come through loud and clear.
Letting Children Pick
Children love to feel that they have power. Give them the power to pick the 
vegetables in the market that they and you will eat. Move around to the dif­
ferent colors, explaining that the reason for the different colors is that each 
color represents a different kind of food that they need in their body. Get a 
rainbow of vegetables.
Try to know what the vegetables contain so you can explain to the child. 
Much of that information is in Chapter 2. This vegetable gives you this vita­
min and mineral. That vegetable gives you that one. Your body uses them all 
to create a healthy person.
Involving Children in Food Preparation
When you ask children to describe their earliest memories, they often talk 
happily about helping their grandmother make some kind of food. Many of 
the chefs in this book began cooking by their grandmother’s or mother’s 
side.
Preparing food together can be a great bonding experience between you and 
your child, and it also provides you with the opportunity to teach good nutri­
tion. If your child helps you to prepare vegetables, he will want to try what he 
has prepared.

315
 Chapter 22: Ten Ways to Encourage Children to Eat More Fruits and Vegetables
Have your child create his or her own nutrition plan for a day and discuss 
every part of it, pointing out what is carbohydrate, protein, fat, the balance 
among those foods, and how they affect his or her diabetes. Use the food 
guide pyramid or the child’s nutrition plan as a guide for planning, showing 
the important role that vegetables play in the plan.
Never prepare one meal for your diabetic child and another for the rest of 
the family. Everyone can benefit from the better choices you make with your 
child’s nutritious food. The child also realizes that eating isn’t punishment 
for a person with diabetes because the whole family eats the same way.
Keeping Problem Foods Out of Sight 
and Good Foods in Easy View
If potato chips or creamy cookies sit on the kitchen counter, can you blame 
your child (or yourself) for grabbing a handful every time he or she goes by? 
Don’t buy these foods in the first place. If you do, keep them out of sight. You 
know what happens when you walk up to a buffet table. You can more easily 
avoid what you don’t see.
	
On the other hand, keep fruits and vegetables in plain sight. Have carrot sticks 
and celery sticks easily available. Keep some cooked broccoli and cauliflower 
in the refrigerator.
Again, your child follows your example. If you raid the freezer for ice cream, 
don’t be surprised to see your child do the same thing. If you raid the refrig­
erator for broccoli or asparagus, that is what your child will do as well. The 
great benefit to you when you set an example for your child is the excellent 
nutrition that you get.
Growing a Garden
Even if all you have is a small box, you can show your child where vegetables 
come from, how they grow, when to pick them, and the fun of eating what 
you grow. Plus, foods that you grow and pick yourself, just at the peak of 
taste, are a totally different experience from what you get at the market. Only 
the farmers’ market can come close. So if you can’t possibly grow your own, 
take your child to a farmer’s market. They are everywhere.

316
Part IV: The Part of Tens 
If you do have a little space, here are a few recommendations from an old 
farmer (me). Grow some bush beans from seeds for the beautiful flowers that 
precede the delicious and plentiful beans, and to demonstrate what can come 
from a tiny seed. They don’t require staking up like pole beans. Grow some 
beets and carrots, also from seeds, to show that foods grow under the earth 
as well as above the earth, and they get pretty sweet at that. Grow some 
tomatoes and zucchini from plants to show how things can grow in abun­
dance from only one or two plants that start very tiny.
Let your child do the picking. The thrill of picking your own food is not to be 
missed. If you can’t pick in your own garden, pick where you can pay for the 
produce in another garden.
Finding Vegetable Recipes They Like
In the age of the Internet, the availability of great recipes is almost over­
whelming. In this book you will find a tiny portion of what is out there. 
Brilliant chefs are working to produce recipes that make us salivate. Your 
children will love the results.
Appendix D has my recommendations for sources for great recipes, not just 
for people with diabetes, but for everyone. One of the central themes in all 
my books about diabetes is that people with diabetes can eat great food. 
They can eat just about anything as long as the portions are appropriate.
You don’t have to go to vegetarian sources to find great vegetable recipes. 
Even restaurants that feature meat know how to cook vegetables. You’ll be 
amazed at the creative ways that chefs prepare zucchini, carrots, squash, 
spinach, and so forth.
Try watching some of the cooking shows on TV as you exercise. Check the 
schedule and try to exercise when the vegetable cooking is being shown. 
The only problem is that you may want to stop exercising and start cooking. 
Resist until you have done your thirty minutes or more.
Stir Frying
One of the best ways to cook vegetables ending with a delicious dish without 
adding a lot of fat is to stir fry. You use very little oil and the vegetables come 
out hot and delicious. The natural tastes of the vegetables are sealed in. The 

317
 Chapter 22: Ten Ways to Encourage Children to Eat More Fruits and Vegetables
Chinese have been doing it this way for generations. Until they adopted our 
Western styles of cooking and eating, diabetes was not much of a problem 
among the Chinese.
Stir fry many different kinds of vegetables together to make a vegetable 
medley. Some may take a little longer or a little shorter to fry so put the ones 
together that take the same time. A meal made up just with stir-fried vegeta­
bles can be all your child needs to realize how delicious vegetables can be. 
You don’t have to throw in any chicken or beef. That is an important message 
to send your child. A meal can be complete without animal protein. As I have 
tried to emphasize in this new edition, eating vegetarian is a very healthful 
way to go.
Using a Dip
Sometimes dipping the vegetables into a delicious dip that you prepare can 
make the vegetables even more delicious, desirable, and easy to eat. Here is a 
simple dill dip mix that your child will love:
	
✓	1⁄2 cup dried dill weed
	
✓	1⁄2 cup dried minced onion
	
✓	1⁄2 cup dried parsley
	
✓	1⁄2 cup Beau Monde seasoning
Combine the ingredients in a bowl and store in a tight container. Label it with 
instructions for use. When needed, combine 1 cup lowfat mayonnaise, 1 cup 
lowfat yogurt and 3 tablespoons of dill dip mix and blend well. Your child will 
love it with all vegetables.
Knowing the Right Sized Portion
A 2-year-old child requires a lot less than a 20-year old adult. The recom­
mended serving size of vegetables for a toddler is a tablespoon per year of 
age. If you want to get your 2-year old to eat five of his servings of vegetables, 
all you have to do is get him to eat ten tablespoons during the course of the 
day. That’s a lot easier than you thought. If your child wants more, don’t 
stop him!

318
Part IV: The Part of Tens 
With so little that has to be eaten to reach the daily goal, it may be easier 
to stick to just one or two vegetables on any given day. Today is carrot and 
bean day while tomorrow is beet and zucchini day. Vegetables can be fun!
Giving Fruit Juice
You would never think of offering your child a cigarette, would you? Why 
would you ever offer your child a can of soda? Chapter 2 makes it pretty clear 
that there is little difference in the negative consequences of cigarettes or 
soda or fruit drink, for that matter. If you want to get some more fruit into 
your child and he won’t eat enough solid fruit, give him juice. You can get 
juice from just about any fruit and many vegetables.
You can also make delicious fruit smoothies with lots of fruit, some juice, and 
a little yogurt. Kids love them!
Don’t buy the canned variety, which always has too much salt in it for some 
dumb reason. Get a juicer and make your own. The wonderful possibilities 
of putting together all kinds of fruit flavors is easily available if you make 
your own. Connect the drinking of juice with some kind of celebration. In 
our house we have juice with breakfast every morning and clink our glasses 
together as we say, “To life!”

fter you have had a chance to look over and try some of the wonderful 
dishes in this book, you’ll never again think that people with diabe­
tes can’t enjoy terrific meals. The chefs who contributed these recipes are 
health- and nutrition-conscious, and you’ll probably be able to find other 
choices on their menus that also fit your nutritional plan very well. However, 
note that we have tried to reduce kilocalories by reducing fat and sugar 
intake as much as possible — with the agreement of the chefs — as well as 
keeping salt intake on the low side.
The meal you receive in the restaurant may not be exactly what you find 
here, especially because chefs change often; also, chefs sometimes cook for 
100 or more people, and their measurements may not be exact every time. 
Most food must be prepared rapidly in a restaurant and not the same way. 
You’ll also receive a portion that is generally too large, so be prepared to 
take some home.
The restaurants that contributed recipes for this book are all fine restaurants 
that have been given the stamp of approval by various testing organizations. 
You will not be disappointed no matter what you eat in these establishments, 
but the kilocalories and the distribution of carbohydrates, protein, and fat 
may not fit your nutritional plan perfectly. You need to adjust other meals 
and snacks to get your overall nutrition plan to conform to the guidelines for 
a full day (see Chapter 2).
	
The difficulty of preparation for the recipes in this book varies greatly. For a 
few reasons, we include some recipes that are more labor-intensive and time-
intensive than usual.
	
✓	First, many of you are excellent cooks and will try these recipes despite 
the difficulties because they’re delicious and worth the time.
	
✓	Second, even if you choose not to try specific recipes, you’ll find wonderful 
tips about foods and techniques to incorporate into whatever you cook.
	
✓	Third, you’ll get an idea of what goes into the magical foods that these 
fine restaurants are turning out, and you can choose to order that dish if 
you go to that restaurant.
Whatever your pleasure, bon appétit!

Conversions of Weights, 
Measures, and Sugar Substitutes

o you know how many tablespoons are in a cup? How many grams are 
in a pound? And how do you choose between all those sugar substi­
tutes on the market? What if you need to convert an oven temperature from 
Celsius to Fahrenheit? This appendix offers some information to help you 
answer those questions.
Conversions
The following list provides some common measurement conversions.
1 teaspoon = 1⁄3 tablespoon
1 tablespoon = 3 teaspoons
2 tablespoons = 1⁄8 cup (1 ounce)
4 tablespoons = 1⁄4 cup
51⁄3 tablespoons = 1⁄3 cup
8 tablespoons = 1⁄2 cup
16 tablespoons = 1 cup
1 cup = 1⁄2 pint
2 cups = 1 pint
2 pints = 1 quart
4 quarts = 1 gallon
1 pound = 16 ounces
1 fluid ounce = 2 tablespoons
16 fluid ounces = 1 pint

338
Part V: Appendixes 
Table C-1 explains how to convert specific measurements. For example, if you 
have 3 ounces of mushrooms, how many grams of mushrooms do you have? 
To find out, multiply 3 by 28.35 (you have 85.05 grams).

 Appendix C: Conversions of Weights, Measures, and Sugar Substitutes
Sugar Substitutes
The new approach to nutrition for people with diabetes doesn’t emphasize 
the elimination of sugar from your diet entirely as long as you count the kilo­
calories that you consume. When a recipe calls for only a few teaspoons of 
sugar, you may want to use table sugar (also known as sucrose). When the 
recipe calls for 1⁄4 cup of sugar or more, then substitution with a noncaloric 
sweetener of your choice will definitely save you kilocalories. There are 
also sweeteners besides glucose that do contain kilocalories but offer other 
advantages, such as not raising the blood glucose as fast. (We discuss your 
sweet options in more detail in Chapter 2.)
The following sweeteners contain kilocalories that are added into the total 
kilocalorie count. They’re absorbed differently than glucose, so they affect 
the blood glucose differently.
	
✓	Fructose, found in fruits and berries
	
✓	Xylitol, found in strawberries and raspberries
	
✓	Sorbitol and mannitol, sugar alcohols occurring in plants
Non-nutritive or artificial sweeteners are often much sweeter than table 
sugar. Therefore, much less of this type of sweetener is required to accom­
plish the same level of sweetness as sugar. The current artificial sweeteners 
(from oldest to newest) include the following:
	
✓	Saccharin
	
✓	Aspartame
	
✓	Acesulfame-K
	
✓	Sucralose
If you plan to substitute another sweetener for sugar, check out Table C-3 to 
find the measurements needed to achieve equal sweetness.
