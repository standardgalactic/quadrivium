Out There Task
Вы будете говорить с вашими собеседниками Out There о себе и задавать им вопросы о них 
самих. В подготовительном материале вы уже поработали над формами вопросов и некоторой 
основной лексикой.
You are going to talk to your Out There conversation partners about yourself and ask them questions about 
themselves. You have practised the question forms and some key vocabulary in the preparation material.

Before you call your Out There conversation partners:

Do you understand it? If you do not, read it again.
3.	 Готовы ли вы начать разговор? 
Are you ready to call your partners?
4.	 Обратитесь к собеседнику и представьтесь: 
“Hi, my name is [вставьте свое имя], I’m learning English, can I ask you some questions?”
Call and introduce yourself:
“Hi, my name is [insert your name here], I’m learning English, can I ask you some questions 
about you?”
5.	 Скажите «thank you»…и начинайте задание. 
Say ‘thank you’…and begin the task.
6.	 Не забудьте записать ответы ваших партнеров и попросите их воспользоваться 
«разговорной» графой, чтобы написать спеллинг слов, которые вы не понимаете. 
Remember to write your partners’ answers down and ask them to use the ‘chat’ box to spell 
words and phrases you don’t understand.
7.	 Не забывайте, что вы можете сделать аудиозапись ваших разговоров и прослушать их 
снова!

Task Sheet 5
Out there Task
Вы будете тренироваться в диалогах со своими собеседниками Out There. Они будут играть роль 
водителя такси, а вы будете говорить, куда вам нужно ехать и спрашивать, сколько это стоит. 
Вы также попросите чек в конце поездки и попытаетесь завести во время вашего «путешествия» 
беседу на общие темы. Используйте лексику, над которой вы работали самостоятельно.
You are going to practise some dialogues with your Out There conversation partners. They are going to 
pretend to be a taxi driver and you are going to tell them where you want to go and ask them how much 
it costs. You are also going to ask for a receipt at the end of the journey and have a general conversation 
with them during your “journey” if you can. Use the language you have been practising in the self-study 
material.
Прежде чем начать разговор со своими собеседниками Out There:
Before you call your Out There conversation partners:
1.	 Внимательно прочитайте задание. 
Read the task carefully.
2.	 Вы его понимаете? Если нет, прочитайте еще раз.
Do you understand it? If you do not, read it again.
