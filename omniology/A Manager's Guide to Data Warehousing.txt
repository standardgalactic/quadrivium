Acknowledgments
I have been very blessed with great family, friends, and colleagues. I would like
to thank the many clients and colleagues who have challenged me, pushed me,
and collaborated with me on so many initiatives over the years. I appreciate
the opportunity to work with such high-quality people. I want to acknow-
ledge the contributions that have been made to the data warehousing industry
and to me personally by the amazing people who worked at Metaphor. I want
to express my gratitude to my dear friend and colleague Paul Kautza for his
belief in me and for all his hard work all these years.
Thanks are also due to the dedicated staff at Wiley who believed in me and
had great patience to help see this project through. Thanks to Bob Elliott for
being the impetus to get this project started and to Sara Shlaer and Rosanne
Koneval for their detailed efforts to produce a quality product. I want to
express appreciation to Cindi Howson for her insight on business intelligence
tools.
I want to extend a sincere and special thank you to Jonathon Geiger for his
meticulous comments and suggestions.
I also want to thank two very special people who have provided unﬂagging
support and encouragement every step of the way: my friends Ingrid Korb
and Paula Johnson. I am not sure I could have done this without you!
Of course, none of this would be possible without the dedication, sacriﬁce,
love, and support given to me by my family: Mark, Ryan, Michael, and Leah.

Introduction
Many executives, managers, business analysts, and nontechnical personnel are
highly motivated to learn more about data warehousing. They want to under-
stand what data warehouses are and how they work. More important, many
are truly interested in doing their part to ensure success when implementing
a data warehouse in their company. They are not interested in learning how
to write code or tune a database.
Unfortunately, most data warehouse publications available today are writ-
ten for the people who design and build them. Some are from a project
management perspective and others provide a great deal of technical depth.
While these are very valuable to the technical team, they do not help the
nontechnical audience. This book was written to provide a resource for those
nontechnical people.
Overview of the Book
The information in this book has been gathered over years of working on
data warehouse projects. Hundreds of hours have been invested in learning
what works well and what does not. One constant thread over the years is
the need to develop and strengthen the partnership between business and
systems personnel. There has always been a need to help nontechnical people
in the organization understand the different parts of a data warehouse and
what needs to be done to build and maintain one.
This book covers the topics and questions that come up repeatedly in
executive brieﬁngs, classes, meetings, and casual conversation. It also includes
coverage of topics related to how organizations frequently get into trouble.

Introduction
The goal is to minimize the frustration of all participants and to ultimately help
organizations to build and maintain valuable data warehouse environments.
The book provides a sound introduction to data warehousing concepts
and then moves on to explain the process of developing and creating a data
warehouse project. A description of each step is provided, including details
about how the business should participate. This book does not provide the
technical level of detail that IT team members need to know, such as speciﬁc
coding techniques or how to best set parameters to improve performance with
a speciﬁc technology. The book does provide what is needed to understand
these areas so that you are better prepared to have clear communication across
the organization. By knowing what is being designed or developed, you can
be more effective in sharing your ideas, requirements, and concerns.
More technical readers will beneﬁt by gaining a complete picture of data
warehousing, with an emphasis on how representatives from the business
community can help you be more successful. This will provide you with ideas
about how to interact more clearly with the business community. Use this as
a resource; highlight the most pertinent chapters or sections that would be
beneﬁcial for your business counterparts to read.
How This Book Is Organized
This book is divided into ﬁve major parts. Each part focuses on a speciﬁc
aspect of data warehousing.
The ﬁrst part shares the essentials of data warehousing. This can help
executives and managers get a realistic understanding of the fundamen-
tals and gain insight into both the most common factors for success and
how to avoid roadblocks.
The second part of the book takes a look at the business management of
a data warehouse. This includes how to cultivate a strong partnership
between the business and IT communities, what is entailed in setting
up a data warehouse project, and how to effectively communicate your
business requirements for the data warehouse. It is just as important for
different business groups to work together in order to support a consistent
view of the data.
The third part of the book focuses on the data itself. How the data is
organized is critical to ensure that you, the business, can understand and
exploit what is available. Without the right data, presented in a useful
manner, the data warehouse will not be used, which jeopardizes the
entire investment. This section of the book gives you the tools you need to
ensure that the data meets your needs. Beyond how data is processed or

Introduction
xxv
stored, the issues surrounding how organizations view data ownership
and management are also addressed.
Part four delves into data warehouse architecture, what is involved to
efﬁciently build the data warehouse, and ﬁnally what must be done to
deliver the data. While most of the work during this part of a project
is more technical in nature, there is still a need for active business
participation. This section will help managers and business participants
understand what work is being done and how they can help.
Part ﬁve explores what is needed to launch the data warehouse and
wrap up the project. Looking beyond a single project, the work needed to
maintain and grow the data warehouse is discussed. The causes of, and
recommendations to address, a stalled data warehouse are presented. A
data warehouse can have initial success that decreases over time unless
speciﬁc steps are taken. Suggestions are provided that can help you
sustain your success.
Who Should Read This Book
The target audience for this book is anyone who is responsible for, working
on, or paying for a data warehouse. In particular, it is targeted toward
nontechnical readers in order to help them understand the basics of data
warehousing, and, more importantly, how to successfully build one. For the
more technical readers, this book provides the tools you need in order to be
able to communicate with your business partners.
The information is presented in a layered manner. The basic concepts are
presented early in the book, while more in-depth coverage is provided in later
chapters. This book is designed to serve a variety of levels of need. Some
readers may beneﬁt from reading only the ﬁrst part, returning later to learn
more about a speciﬁc area. Other readers may beneﬁt by reading all of the
content from start to ﬁnish.
While all readers could beneﬁt from reading the entire text, I realize that not
everyone has the same passion for data warehousing. Realistically, different
types of readers will beneﬁt from various parts of the book:
Executives and senior managers should read Part 1. Then, based upon
what the organization is facing, subsequent chapters may be worthwhile
as different issues crop up. For example, if your company has problems
getting the data loaded into the data warehouse, it would be helpful to
read Chapter 10 to get a better understanding of what is really involved
in building the database.

xxvi
Introduction
Middle managers, both business and IT, will beneﬁt from Part 1 but will
also ﬁnd Part 2 to be important. These parts help you get the project set
up properly and, most important, learn about how to provide business
requirements. Skimming the rest of the book can help all managers learn
what is available to help them with the rest of the project. Then, as needed,
the speciﬁc chapters can be studied in detail when the organization is
working on that part of a data warehouse initiative.
Business personnel involved with a data warehouse can skim the chapters
on setting up a project, but will ﬁnd it helpful to study in depth Chapter 6
to learn about providing requirements, Chapter 7 to understand how the
data should be organized, and Chapter 11 to learn about how the data
can be delivered. It is recommended that the rest of the book be reviewed
to familiarize yourself with the content. Speciﬁc chapters can be studied
in more detail when the organization is working on that area.
Everyone on the data warehouse project team should read this entire
book. It can provide a common ground for dialogue and more meaningful
discussions between the business and technical personnel. The project
team can provide this book to their business counterparts and suggest
speciﬁc chapters for them to read to better support the project.
Technical staff can also beneﬁt from this book, which can help anyone
with in-depth technical knowledge to communicate with their managers
and business counterparts about data warehousing. This provides the
backdrop for all interactions with the business community.
When designed and implemented properly, a data warehouse is a valuable
tool for an organization to improve how it runs. Getting the right design
requires active participation of knowledgeable business personnel. Keeping
things on track requires the support of middle managers to ensure that
everything is progressing smoothly. Executives and senior managers will be
able to ask meaningful questions about data warehouse projects and be able to
understand the answers. All of these things require that business and technical
staff have a common understanding of the different parts of a data warehouse
and what is involved in a successful project. It is hoped that this book provides
the foundation you and your organization need to achieve success with all of
your data warehouse initiatives.

Success
You’ve heard about them. You may have used one. You may be asked to pay
for one. But what is a data warehouse and why should you invest any time,
energy, and money on one? The short answer is that a data warehouse can help
your organization to be more proﬁtable, run more efﬁciently, and meet the
challenges of today’s marketplace. Yet it is not a quick, simple, or inexpensive
undertaking to build a data warehouse.
There is often a disconnect between the technical side that builds and
maintains a data warehouse and the business side that will use it. This
book will help bridge that gap. Both business managers and IT managers
will learn what is involved with building and deploying a successful data
warehouse. Executives and senior managers will also ﬁnd this book helpful,
especially Part 1, in order to be able to provide effective oversight and support.
This book will also be beneﬁcial for all business and technical personnel
involved with a data warehouse, providing a common foundation for better
communication. Managers on both sides need the knowledge and information
that will enable them to help their organization build and use a data warehouse
most effectively, and this book is the path to that knowledge.
This chapter explains the value of a data warehouse and highlights what
is needed for success. To help frame the discussion, the chapter begins with
some deﬁnitions.
The Essentials of Data Warehousing
Data warehousing is not new. Most large organizations have been investing
in data warehousing for years. Currently, cost-effective technology is creating
more possibilities for small and medium-size companies to build and deploy
data warehouse solutions too. There are many stories about wild successes, and
just as many about failed projects. With so much buzz about data warehousing,
it is often assumed that everyone already knows the basics. However, many
3

Part I
■The Essentials of Data Warehousing
people are being exposed to these concepts for the ﬁrst time. To ensure a
common understanding, it is worth taking the time to boil things down to the
essence of data warehousing.
What Is a Data Warehouse?
A data warehouse (DW) is the collection of processes and data whose overarching
purpose is to support the business with its analysis and decision-making. In
other words, it is not one thing per se, but a collection of many different
parts. Before looking more closely at the speciﬁc parts of a data warehouse
environment, it is helpful to compare the characteristics and purpose of a data
warehouse with an operational application system.
Differences Between Operational and DW Systems
Applications that run the business are called online transaction processing systems
(OLTPs). OLTP systems are geared toward functions such as processing
incoming orders, getting products shipped out, and transferring funds as
requested. These applications must ensure that transactions are handled
accurately and efﬁciently. No one wants to wait minutes to get cash from
an automated teller machine, or to enter sales orders into a company’s system.
In contrast, the purpose and characteristics of a data warehousing envi-
ronment are to provide data in a format easily understood by the business
community in order to support decision-making processes. The data ware-
house supports looking at the business data over time to identify signiﬁcant
trends in buying behavior, customer retention, or changes in employee pro-
ductivity. Table 1-1 lays out the primary differences between these two types
of systems.
The inherent differences between the functions performed in OLTP and DW
systems result in methodology, architecture, tool, and technology differences.
Data warehousing emerged as an outgrowth of necessity, but has blossomed
into a full-ﬂedged industry that serves a valuable function in the business
community.
Now that the differences between data warehouse and OLTP systems have
been reviewed, it is time to look deeper into the makeup of the data warehouse
itself.
The Data Warehousing Environment
There are many different parts of a data warehouse environment, which
encompasses everything from where the data lives today through where it is
ultimately used on reports and for analysis. Each of the main parts of the data

warehousing environment, shown in Figure 1-1, are described in the following

■The Essentials of Data Warehousing
Source systems, shown on the left side of Figure 1-1, are where data is created
or collected by operational application systems that run the business. These
are often large applications that have been in place for a long time. Examples
of source systems include the following:
Order processing
Production scheduling
Financial trading systems
Policy administration
Claims handling
Accounts payable/receivable
Employee payroll
The entire midsection of Figure 1-1 is devoted to the preparation and
organization of data. First, the data must be extracted from the source systems.
Next, the data needs to be transformed to prepare it for business use. It
must be cleansed, validated, integrated together, and reorganized. Finally, the
data is loaded into structures that are designed to deliver it to the business
community. The entire process is referred to as the extract, transform, and load
(ETL) process.
The database in which the data is organized to support the business is called
a data mart. A data mart includes all of the data that is loaded into a single
database and used together for analysis. Data marts are often developed to
meet the needs of a business group such as marketing or ﬁnance. The key
to a successful data mart is to create it in an integrated manner. It is also
recommended that data be loaded into only one data mart and then shared
across the organization to ensure data consistency.
Finally, an application or reporting layer is provided to facilitate access and
analysis of the data. This is where business users access reports, dashboards,
and analytical applications. Collections of these reports and analyses are called
business intelligence.
There is one more critical concept that warrants some attention: the mecha-
nism used to help organize data, which is called a data model.
What Is a Data Model?
A data model is an abstraction of how individual data elements relate to
each other. It visually depicts how the data is to be organized and stored
in a database. A data model provides the mechanism for documenting and
understanding how data is organized.
There are many different types of data modeling, each with a speciﬁc
goal and purpose. As organizations modiﬁed how data was structured to

Chapter 1
■Gaining Data Warehouse Success
7
support reporting and analysis, a new data modeling technique, now called
dimensional modeling, emerged. Ralph Kimball, a pioneer in data warehousing,
can be credited with crystallizing these techniques and publishing them for the
beneﬁt of the industry. (For more information about dimensional modeling,
see Chapter 7.)
The data and processes to perform the work shown in Figure 1-1 are collec-
tively called the data warehouse. These basic concepts have been ﬁne-tuned
and relabeled by many different players in the data warehousing ﬁeld. The
two most common philosophies are discussed in the next section.
Understanding Industry Perspectives
At the end of the day, everyone faces the same challenge: getting the data into
the hands of the business user to turn it into information that can be used to
make decisions. The deﬁnitions provided so far provide the backdrop for how
terms are used in this book. There are many brilliant and talented people in
the data warehousing industry, many of whom have different philosophies
about how to design and build a data warehouse. It is worthwhile to look
more closely at two of the most frequently used philosophies.
The ﬁrst is from Ralph Kimball and colleagues, as described in The Data
Warehouse Lifecycle Toolkit, Second Edition (Wiley, 2008). Ralph Kimball is a
clear thought leader in the data warehousing industry and has written several
books that provide detailed information essential for practitioners. That book
describes the enterprise data warehouse as:
The complete end-to-end data warehouse and business intelligence system (DW/BI
System). Although some would argue that you can theoretically deliver business
intelligence without a data warehouse and vice versa, that is ill-advised from
our perspective. Linking the two together in the DW/BI acronym reinforces their
dependency. Independently, we refer to the queryable data in your DW/BI system
as the enterprise data warehouse, and value-add analytics as BI (business
intelligence) applications.
A second deﬁnition worth looking at is from Bill Inmon, a proliﬁc author
and another leader in the data warehousing industry, from Building the Data
Warehouse, Fourth Edition (Wiley, 2005):
The data warehouse is a collection of integrated subject-oriented databases
designed to support the DSS (decision support system) function, where each unit
of data is relevant to some moment in time. The data warehouse contains atomic
data and lightly summarized data.
Bill’s deﬁnition is also described and expanded by Claudia Imhoff and
colleagues in Mastering Data Warehouse Design (Wiley, 2003):

8
Part I
■The Essentials of Data Warehousing
. . . It [the DW] is the central point of data integration for business intelligence
and is the source of data for the data marts, delivering a common view of enterprise
data.
This second viewpoint is incomplete without also including their deﬁnition
of a data mart. Again, expanding on Bill Inmon’s deﬁnition, Claudia states in
Mastering Data Warehouse Design:
A data mart is a departmentalized structure of data feeding from the data
warehouse where data is denormalized [organized] based on the department’s
need for information. It utilizes a common enterprise view of strategic data and
provides business units with more ﬂexibility, control, and responsibility. The
data mart may or may not be on the same server or location as the data warehouse.
To bring this second viewpoint into the proper context, Mastering Data
Warehouse Design further deﬁnes business intelligence:
Business intelligence is the set of processes and data structures used to analyze
data and information used in strategic decision support. The components of
Business Intelligences are the data warehouse, data marts, the DSS (decision
support system) interface and the processes to ‘get data in’ to the data warehouse
and to ‘get information out’.
The single deﬁnition provided by Ralph Kimball is comprehensive. You
must look at the full set of deﬁnitions set forth by Bill Inmon and Claudia
Imhoff to fully understand their perspective. There is much more common
ground between these differing philosophies than perceived at ﬁrst glance.
While there are distinct differences, the common theme is that data ware-
housing must provide the method to prepare and deliver data to the business
community to support reporting and analysis. Chapter 9 provides a compre-
hensive discussion about these different approaches to data warehousing.
The key point here is that there are multiple ways these terms can be
interpreted. Understanding which deﬁnition is being used is critical to being
able to understand what is being discussed and worked on. An organization
can avoid confusion by selecting one set of deﬁnitions to be used, which
enables everyone to use a common language.
Regardless of labels and terminology, all data warehouse initiatives are
trying to accomplish the same thing. Now that the basic parts of the data ware-
house have been deﬁned, it is time to look at the order in which they are created.
Design and Development Sequence
Earlier in this chapter, you looked at how data ﬂows through the data ware-
house environment. While this correctly illustrates how data ﬂows in the

Chapter 1
■Gaining Data Warehouse Success
9
completed environment, this is not the recommended sequence for designing
and developing a data warehouse. A better way to design the environment is
to start from the business user perspective. Figure 1-2 shows the correct order
to successfully design and implement a data warehousing environment. Both
the technical and business team members play a role throughout. Chapter
4 describes the different roles and responsibilities. Each step in the design
process is described as follows:
1. An understanding of what the business is trying to accomplish and how
success is measured should be the foundation for all data warehousing
initiatives. The starting point for designing the data warehouse is with
the business community. Chapter 6 covers what you need to know to
effectively provide business requirements.
2. Once the business requirements are understood, the data in the under-
lying source systems needs to be studied. Many business people have a
vision for what they want to do, but it is not always tied to the reality of
the organization’s actual data. In preparation for modeling data, Chapter
7 introduces techniques to help you understand your data.

■The Essentials of Data Warehousing
3. The foundation for successful data warehousing, now and into the future,
is properly structuring the data. Data must be organized to support the
business perspective. This provides ease of use and improved query
performance. This design is created based on a knowledge of the business
requirements, as well as the reality of the existing data. Chapter 7 focuses
on how the business and technical team members can work together to
develop appropriate data models for this data delivery layer.
4. After deﬁning how the data will be organized, the design for getting the
data from the source systems to the database can be created. Decisions
about the architecture and tools needed to prepare the data can be made
in the proper context. Too often these decisions are made before you
know what is to be delivered. Chapter 9 provides the background needed
to understand data warehouse architecture and technology. Chapter 10
deals with the challenges of preparing the data for business reporting
and analytical use.
5. While the data is being prepared, the data access and application layer
can be designed. This includes the design of basic reports, business
intelligence, and analytical applications, and performance dashboards or
other end user tools. Chapter 11 focuses on ﬁnal delivery of data to the
business community.
Many different project methodologies are available for all systems’ devel-
opment efforts. There are even multiple methodologies speciﬁcally targeted
toward data warehousing. These have evolved over several decades. Most
organizations already have adopted some type of project methodology or
project life cycle. It is important to understand how your organization runs
projects to ensure that the data warehouse project is adhering to the strategic
direction for all information systems. Several basic building blocks are found
in any methodology. These primary components, discussed throughout the
book, are as follows:
Project deﬁnition, planning and management is outlined in Chapters 4
and 5.
Deﬁning business requirements is discussed in Chapter 6.
Designing the data delivery database is covered in Chapter 7.
Deﬁning the architecture is discussed in Chapter 9 and includes devel-
opment of the database
Processes for building the database are reviewed in Chapter 10.
Developing reports/analyses and providing education/support is pre-
sented in Chapter 11 and includes deployment of the ﬁnal results.

These basic components need to be in place regardless of the chosen
methodology, approach, philosophy, or technology. The sequence outlined
earlier helps to ensure overall success by tying all other activities to business
requirements. This sequence also helps build a foundation that will withstand
the test of time.
Why Build a Data Warehouse?
Since the ﬁrst application systems were built, businesses have struggled
with the proliferation of data. Systems have been implemented to automate
business processes such as order processing, policy administration, shipping,
and manufacturing scheduling. Each of these applications captures a lot of
data. This data has the potential to be used in several ways:
To understand what is really happening in the business
To identify historical trends
To predict future opportunities
To measure performance
Originally, business requests for data were run directly against production
application systems. This was not an efﬁcient way to gather data. For example,
a request for data might query which days over the last three years have
the highest ATM transaction rates in the Midwest. Unfortunately, in order to
gather this data, the data query slowed—or worse, interrupted—the ability of
the application systems to perform their primary function. It is unacceptable to
reduce the speed with which the ATMs complete transactions, even to support
the corporate marketing department. Needless to say, the ability to run these
reports against the production application systems was revoked.
However, understanding the results of such a request was valuable, so a
copy of the production data was made to enable reporting and basic analysis
to be done without affecting the actual operational systems. When working
with a copy, modiﬁcations were made to how the data was stored in order to
make reporting easier. In addition, if historical data was not retained in the
operational systems, then the history was kept in the ‘‘copy’’. New system
design techniques were developed to improve how the copy of the data was
created and organized. Speciﬁc hardware, software tools, and technologies
also emerged. These have grown into what we know as the data warehousing
industry today.
In spite of these technical advancements, organizations still struggle with
some basic data issues:
Direct data access: You can’t directly access the data; you have to request
it from a data systems department.

12
Part I
■The Essentials of Data Warehousing
Data usefulness: You can’t get the data you need; what is collected is not
useful for your purposes.
Poor data quality: The data, if and when you get it, is often not correct.
You can’t rely on it.
Facilitating exception reporting: There is too much data; you have to dig
through it to ﬁnd what’s important.
Timeliness of data: By the time reports get to you, the window of oppor-
tunity no longer exists.
Flexibility: You need total ﬂexibility to look at data from a variety of pers-
pectives.
Data integration: You need to perform analysis across all lines of business
but the data is stored all over, so you can’t easily compare it.
Silo reporting environments: Different departments use different report-
ing tools and you can’t share reports.
Unclear deﬁnitions of data: Everyone has their own report, but the
ﬁgures do not match and you don’t know why.
These basic data problems that drove the initial work in the data warehous-
ing industry are the same core problems facing businesses today. If anything,
the problems are compounded by ever-increasing mountains of data. While
addressing basic data-related issues is certainly a big part of the rationale to
build a data warehouse, there are also bigger, more critical business issues that
need to be addressed. The data warehouse can provide a vehicle to deliver
the information needed to help a business address these issues, which is what
drives the true value.
The Value of Data Warehousing
Data warehousing is much bigger than simply delivering reports in a timely
manner. It is not the data, the technologies, or the reports that impact the
business. Rather, it is the ability of your staff to harness the information to
make better, fact-based, insightful decisions. The data warehouse is simply a
tool that enables your staff to be more effective. The types of things that can be
done using a data warehouse include the following:
Tracking and trending key performance indicators: A data warehouse
can provide reports that indicate which product lines are popular in
various regions, which employees have generated the most sales, or
whether certain ad campaigns are correlated with successful sales.
Measuring business performance: Using reports from the data ware-
house, actual and forecasted performance can be compared. For example,

Chapter 1
■Gaining Data Warehouse Success
13
claims managers can see how close they are to reaching the target of
making a ﬁrst payment on claims within the ﬁrst ten days of opening a
new claim.
Reporting and understanding ﬁnancial results: A data warehouse can
help identify departments that have exceeded their monthly budgets,
highlight suppliers who have consistently met proﬁtability goals, and
single out products that have contributed the most (or least) to the bottom
line.
Understanding customers and their behavior: Exception reports that
highlight changes in consumer purchase patterns can help identify shifts
in the marketplace or erosion of brand loyalty. For example, early identi-
ﬁcation of changes in payment patterns might indicate that a customer is
under ﬁnancial pressure and could beneﬁt from a courtesy call to prevent
more serious problems.
Identifying high-value customers: Using the data warehouse to identify
the lifetime value of customers helps with the development of loyalty
programs and improves customer service. Some customers may generate
many business transactions, but they may not actually be proﬁtable.
Other customers may contribute consistently to the organization’s proﬁts
without a lot of hands-on interaction or support.
Attracting and retaining high-value customers: Data warehouse reports
can help you to develop a proﬁle of high-value customers so that
initiatives can be created to seek out new customers with a similar
proﬁle. This may mean offering low-cost incentives early on so that
the organization has the opportunity to develop a strong long-term
relationship.
Better selection or development of new products: Having integrated
data in a common place, the data warehouse can help streamline the
product development process by enabling all groups involved to quickly
access market research test results, product packing cost scenarios, and
projected product sales.
Understanding which products should be scaled back or eliminated:
Using the data warehouse, reports can be generated to highlight prod-
ucts with lagging sales. Additional analyses can be run to determine
the cost effectiveness of continuing to carry these items in stores. The
data warehouse can also be used to help develop plans identifying
when trendy items should be marked down to clear out any remaining
inventory.
Understanding business competitors: The data warehouse can provide
reports to compare internal sales volumes with external competitor sales

14
Part I
■The Essentials of Data Warehousing
ﬁgures. This can help identify ﬂuctuations in the overall marketplace and
how well the organization is maintaining its market share.
Identifying opportunities to improve business ﬂow and processes:
The data warehouse can be used to track how business transactions ﬂow
within the organization to identity bottlenecks, the need for more training,
or when systems capacity can no longer keep up with demand.
Understanding the impact of highly qualiﬁed professionals: A data
warehouse can also be used effectively in not-for-proﬁt scenarios. For
example, data warehouse reports can help identify teachers who meet
speciﬁc criteria and to track how a teacher’s students perform on educa-
tional assessments over time.
These uses apply across many different industries. For example, industries
that have realized data warehousing success include the following:
Consumer packaged goods
Financial services
Manufacturing
Utilities and telecommunications
Pharmaceuticals
Insurance
Healthcare
Shipping and transportation
Educational institutions
Nonproﬁt organizations
Furthermore, data warehousing has been successfully deployed across a
wide variety of business functions, such as sales, marketing, ﬁnance, pur-
chasing, manufacturing quality, human resources, inventory management,
customer relationship marketing, call centers, and more.
Providing timely, reliable data enables business professionals to make
informed decisions. It is not enough to provide a static report; the information
must be ﬂexible enough to make possible the identiﬁcation of anomalies, so
that interesting results can be further explored. This easy exploration enables
business users to get to the bottom of problems, allowing corrective action
to be taken quickly. Sometimes the data demonstrates unexpected positive
results; these also warrant further research to determine whether they indicate
extenuating circumstances or whether the results can be repeated.
The return on any individual decision may be small. A lot of small, better
decisions can add up to a signiﬁcant impact on the bottom line. While there
have certainly been cases, often highly publicized, where a single decision

Chapter 1
■Gaining Data Warehouse Success
15
resulted in multimillion-dollar results, it is more likely for a business to see
beneﬁts from many small decisions. The data warehouse provides the keys
that unlock the data’s value.
There are several common expectations regarding what a data warehouse
should be able to do. Many organizations fall short of meeting these expec-
tations, so it is worth taking some time to understand these expectations and
what needs to be in place in order to achieve them.
The Promises of Data Warehousing
Since its inception, data warehousing has offered the promise of helping to
improve your business. A data warehouse is expected to provide both of the
following:
A single version of the truth
The capability to access all data whenever it is needed
Unfortunately, many organizations have invested millions of dollars in data
warehousing without realizing either of these goals. There are many reasons
for these struggles and failures, many of which are addressed in this book.
First, it is worth looking a little more closely at these expectations.
The idea of having a single version of the truth is appealing because so much
time and energy is wasted in chasing down discrepancies. It is reasonable to
want to trust report results so that decisions based upon those reports are
sound. A data warehouse can indeed provide a single repository for all of
your data, but that alone is not enough to ensure that all reports will be
consistent. Clean, trusted data from the data warehouse is often pulled out,
further manipulated, possibly loaded into yet another database, and ﬁnally
presented on reports. The use of different formulae for calculations, and the
criteria used to include or exclude data from the result set, can cause signiﬁcant
differences in what is shown on a report. The effort of loading data into a
data warehouse is not enough to fulﬁll the promise of a single version of
the truth. This requires organizational discipline and a commitment to data
management, which is discussed in detail in Chapter 8.
The second big promise of data warehousing is that any data that is desired
will be available at your ﬁngertips whenever it is needed. Indeed, a data
warehouse can make data more accessible to many different types of users
across an organization, but it is too expensive to load all of the company’s
data into a data warehouse. The audience and business impact of some data
is not signiﬁcant enough to justify the expense of including it in the data
warehouse. An organization must determine what data is needed to help the
business decision-making processes. Then, the most useful data can be loaded

■The Essentials of Data Warehousing
into the data warehouse over a period of time, perhaps even a number of
years. Often this is viewed as the ﬁnal goal: The data is available in the data
warehouse.
However, data in a database does not automatically mean that it is accessible
to the business community. The data must be made available through reports,
dashboards, or analysis tools that are combined with appropriate education
about how to leverage the data as part of the day-to-day decision-making
processes.
While sound database design and the use of technology are important, many
other factors need to be addressed in order to achieve success. In the next
section, you’ll learn about the most common roadblocks to this success, and
how to remove them.
Keys to Success
There are several key factors for success in building a data warehouse. These
factors are relevant regardless of the industry or size of company, and have
remained constant over the years. As mentioned earlier, some organizations
have invested millions of dollars to obtain the best of everything, and yet
struggle to deliver any value to the business. Conversely, some organizations
have built a data warehouse with little more than bailing wire and an abacus
and have achieved great success. While technology and tools certainly play a
role in building a data warehouse, they are clearly not the primary factors for
success or failure.
PRIMARY FACTORS FOR SUCCESS
Although several factors contribute to a successful data warehouse, two are
primary:
■A strong partnership between the business and systems communities
■Ensuring that the data warehouse project is driven by true business require-
ments
These two major success factors have more to do with people than
technology. Take a look at any project plan. How many tasks are focused on
communication—that is, people—compared to technical tasks? These technical
tasks are indeed important, but speciﬁc actions to ensure meaningful
communication are critical to the project’s success. All other efforts can
amount to nothing if the business community and management are not
committed.

Developing and Maintaining Strong Business and Technology
Partnerships
It is one thing to afﬁrm the importance of a strong partnership between the
business stakeholders and the technology units involved in a data warehouse
project, but it is another thing to put that into practice.
Partnerships often start out strong in the beginning. There is joint participa-
tion in developing a project’s scope and objectives. A business sponsor may
be designated and may help launch the project. This is where the successful
partnerships begin to emerge. Once the project is underway, however, this
is not the time for the business community to sit back and wait for the next
brieﬁng from IT. Now is the time to dig in and help the project move for-
ward. This includes gathering true business requirements and assisting with
understanding the data and helping to make decisions along the way.
Staying involved in a project on a daily or weekly basis ensures that
there is a good understanding of what is happening on a project. This
regular communication also helps to identify potential problems and get the
appropriate help in a timely manner. Detailed involvement helps to ensure
that decisions are made within the proper business context. What may seem
impossible to a technical project team may be easily accomplished by a business
representative, and vice versa.
In addition, it is easier to garner support from the rest of the business
stakeholders when one of their own comes to them with questions or the need
to clarify something. Too often, a technical or systems representative may not
be allowed the same level of access or may not be able to ask questions in a
way that is meaningful to the business. By working together, the project team
members can put together a strategy to get the business input that is necessary
to drive the data and technical decisions. A strong partnership that includes
a lot of mutual involvement also builds ownership of the data warehouse
across the business group. This is important for adoption and use of the data
warehouse when it is deployed.
R E F E R E N C E
Chapter 4 provides more details about how to develop and main-
tain strong partnerships.
Identifying True Business Requirements
True business requirements are not a list of data elements, data sources, or even
reports. These requirements must be more fundamental to the business itself.
For example, the need to better measure marketing campaign performance,
understand and better manage loss ratios, and understand and track student

18
Part I
■The Essentials of Data Warehousing
performance are all business reasons that explain the need for gathering data
and generating a report, in contrast to a demand to ‘‘give me the numbers.’’
These clearly deﬁned business requirements also tend to stand the test
of time. The speciﬁc data elements may change, but the need to monitor
competitor performance will always be important. These requirements also
remain fairly constant unless an organization completely changes business
industry.
R E F E R E N C E
Chapter 6 provides more details about how to collect, under-
stand, and communicate business requirements.
Shifting to a Global Perspective
Many organizations structure their employee performance expectations and
goals on the results of that speciﬁc group. This creates an environment
where the staff members look out for their own interests, sometimes at the
expense of the greater good. This culture makes it more difﬁcult to suc-
cessfully implement a data warehouse. The ability to shift the emphasis
to a more global perspective increases the success of the data warehouse.
Rewarding and encouraging employees, business or technical, who are
looking for opportunities to collaborate, leverage, and integrate across the
organization is important. The larger the organization, the more challenging
this can be.
High-level managers need to look for a balance between individual depart-
ment goals and enterprise goals. This is done to set priorities and direction for
the organization, and happens annually during the budgeting process. This
same thought process can be applied to the data warehouse environment.
Looking for the largest beneﬁt for the most number of people across the orga-
nization can determine what data is loaded is loaded ﬁrst and which reports
are developed. This broad perspective is also needed to create standard data
deﬁnitions and calculations.
SUCCESS TIPS: ENCOURAGING AN ENTERPRISE VIEWPOINT
It may be necessary to modify individual job descriptions and annual perfor-
mance goals to encourage behavior that is beneﬁcial across the enterprise.
Reward employees who ﬁght for the greater good. Many individual contributors
on a data warehouse project can recognize myopic decisions, but there may not
be a way to raise these issues. Strive to provide a mechanism for raising con-
cerns and identifying problems without fears about retribution. This can open
up a dialogue that improves the decision-making process and encourages tak-
ing broader requirements or beneﬁts into consideration.

Overcoming Unrealistic Expectations
It is unrealistic to think that many years’ worth of data problems and challenges
can be corrected in a matter of weeks. In many organizations, addressing
fundamental data problems can actually take years. While setting forth a vision
for the future, it is critical that realistic expectations are set for each individual
project along the way. Informal expectations exist whether you explicitly set
them or not. It is important to know what employees expect a project to
provide, how much it will cost, and how long before the data warehouse will
be available for use. Project expectations must be compared to what is actually
planned. Organizations that regularly monitor these expectations can identify
gaps and can take action sooner. This does not mean that other development
problems go away or that project dates never shift; it simply means that there
is a common understanding of what is happening and why.
Although there is always interest in getting things done faster, a business
must be patient in order to get the right things done. Although it is a clich´e,
there are times when simply adding more resources will not result in faster
completion of a task. You cannot assign nine people and expect a baby to be
born in one month.
SUCCESS TIPS: MANAGING EXPECTATIONS
It is crucial that what a speciﬁc project will and will not deliver is documented
and communicated. This project scope must be in business terms and should
describe the business beneﬁt. The scope needs to be communicated often and
modiﬁed as appropriate. Moreover, this communication must be delivered
across the entire project team, the target user audience, and associated
business and systems management.
Another aspect of setting proper expectations is specifying a realistic budget
and timeline for the project. Apply experience and knowledge of the organiza-
tion to estimating data warehousing projects. If all other systems development
projects are being completed in 10% less time than industry averages, then this
might also be true for data warehousing. If the organization bureaucracy adds
15% overhead to industry average budgets or timelines, then adjust according-
ly. Clearly, experiences with other data warehousing projects across the orga-
nization also need to be considered. This enables others in the organization to
leverage what has already been learned.
Initial project expectations and time schedules may shift throughout the
life of the project. Successful organizations communicate changes in terms of
impact to the business. This helps ensure that there is a common understanding
of both what the project will be delivering and when.

20
Part I
■The Essentials of Data Warehousing
Providing Clear Communication
The need for regular open communication is critical to the success of a data
warehouse project. This involves ensuring that there is a regular forum to
discuss progress and problems. Successful communication is not simply con-
ducting project status meetings and sending out project status reports. Those
are indeed important communication vehicles, but the intended audience for
those is the project team and project management personnel. Regular commu-
nication provides the best vehicle for questions and concerns to be raised and
then addressed. This helps expectations to be managed.
The communication must be open to be helpful. This means that teams are
encouraged to share both good news and bad news. Openly admitting that a
problem exists provides the opportunity for others in the organization to help
provide solutions.
R E F E R E N C E
Chapter 4 provides tips for how to ensure effective and timely
communication about data warehouse initiatives.
SUCCESS TIPS: EFFECTIVE COMMUNICATION
Be sure to employ a multi-layered approach to communication. Organizations
don’t have clear communication by accident; they develop speciﬁc communi-
cation plans and then follow through. These plans need to include an approach
to different levels of the organization, including senior management, project
sponsors, systems management, and the business groups who are the targeted
users of the data warehouse. The frequency and format for communication to
each of these audiences is different.
Senior management may only need quarterly updates in an executive brieﬁng
format. Middle management, from both the business and the systems commu-
nity, may need a more detailed form of an executive brieﬁng. It is helpful to
have these on a monthly basis. This is often done by including a brief time slot
in regularly scheduled staff meetings. Monthly updates for the target user
group may also be enough. Again, the opportunity to share progress can be
easily included in regular staff meetings.
N O T E
It is critical to continue regular communication when there is no signiﬁ-
cant progress to report. The fact that work has slowed and milestones have not yet
been reached is just as important as sharing signiﬁcant progress. Reporting that
hard work continues and that the next milestone is expected to be met by a spe-
ciﬁc date is useful.

Treating Data As a Corporate Asset
The realization that data is more than what is collected and stored on a
computer is just the beginning. Successful organizations realize that while the
technical staff provides the mechanics for collecting and storing data, it is
the business that really drives the meaning and use of data. Data is owned
by the business itself. This drives the business to take a hands-on role in what
data means, where it is collected, and how it is used.
For example, the business must determine the criteria regarding who is
considered a new customer. Is it when a new customer identiﬁer is assigned
in the order entry system? Is it when a customer is issued a new credit card
or when that customer uses the card for the ﬁrst time? Perhaps a customer is
also considered new when he or she makes a purchase after a twelve-month
lack of purchases. Even seemingly simple concepts require a bit more thought
and understanding. Organizations that truly leverage their data do not leave
these types of decisions to the technical staff, but work together to clarify and
store useful data. Treating data as a true corporate asset is much broader than
the data warehouse. This encompasses all systems across the organization.
R E F E R E N C E
Chapter 8 provides more details about what is involved in han-
dling data as the asset it can be, with the emphasis on what this means for the
data warehouse.
Effectively Leveraging Technology
The selection and use of technology is usually very much a focus for data ware-
housing. Purchasing and maintaining hardware and software are some of the
most concrete costs of a data warehouse project. There are a myriad of options
for every component. Even after a speciﬁc vendor or technology is selected,
there are more options for different levels of capability and/or conﬁguration.
Most companies have sound practices in place for the evaluation, selection,
and implementation of technology. Operational applications are very much
deﬁned by construction and then deployment using a set of technologies.
Successful data warehouses are implemented by investing enough in technol-
ogy to empower the technical staff to be efﬁcient in both development and
ongoing maintenance and enhancements. The same investments must also
ensure effective business use of the data warehouse.
The key here is that buying the least (or most) expensive technology may
not be effective for your organization. Having a vision of what needs to be
accomplished for the business helps drive decisions about technology.
R E F E R E N C E
Chapter 9 contains suggestions for ﬁnding the right technology
to meet your requirements.

22
Part I
■The Essentials of Data Warehousing
SUCCESSFUL TIPS: DEPLOYING TOOLS SUCCESSFULLY
When implementing technology, many organizations purchase the best-of-
breed tool, but then cut corners when setting it up. Squeezing a sophisticated
piece of technology onto an existing computer server is not likely to allow that
tool to work effectively. It may even limit the functionality and will most
certainly degrade the performance. Don’t try to save money by conﬁguring the
minimum supported environment. Look for the recommended conﬁguration
that will deliver the results you desire. If the technology does not work well, the
effort to build the data warehouse may have been in vain.
Roadblocks to Success
Many organizations have failed in their data warehousing efforts. Some have
struggled for years, while others have failed in a big and highly visible way.
Some data warehouses have not failed outright, but have never achieved their
full potential. While each case has unique characteristics, several common
themes regularly contribute to failure or the lack of total success.
Believing the Myth: ‘‘If You Build It, They Will Come’’
There are still many companies who invest in building a data warehouse
by pulling data from core operational systems into a common database,
expecting that the business will then begin to use it. This is a good exercise in
data movement and organization, but an approach that rarely leads to success.
The data is organized in ways that are not tied to actual business needs and
requirements. This is an approach that seems ‘safe’ from a systems perspective.
All design and development work is done without venturing into the business
community. The belief is that once the data is organized, the business can be
consulted to determine how to deliver it to them.
Thisapproachdoesnottake intoconsiderationwhatthe businesscommunity
is really doing and wants to do in the future. It is also limited to the way
that data is captured and stored in the underlying operational systems. The
reality of the business often differs from what is captured. Data is grouped
and reported in ways that may not be reﬂected in the underlying systems.
Such an approach also requires a large investment in infrastructure and
building this database before there is any link to business value. This was once
a very popular approach to data warehousing, but it is no longer a leading one.
Unfortunately, many organizations are already well on their way to building
this type of data warehousing environment.

Chapter 1
■Gaining Data Warehouse Success
23
R E C O M M E N D A T I O N
It is never too late to gather business requirements,
a task that can identify the data needed to deliver speciﬁc business analyses and
reports. Adding new data to the data warehouse and possibly restructuring and/or
enhancing the existing data can derive value.
Falling into the Project Deadline Trap
Many organizations have invested in setting up procedures and processes
that follow a project methodology. Clearly, an important part of the process is
deﬁning a project’s scope. Detailed project plans are developed and used to
measure progress. Group and individual performance are often based upon
the ability to meet project deadlines. While project planning and management
are critical to coordinating multiple resources and keeping projects moving
forward, this focus on the project plan itself can cause data warehousing
initiatives to go awry.
The time needed to extract, transform, and load data for analytical appli-
cations (see Chapter 10) is one of the least understood and most often
underestimated tasks of any systems development project. This often leads
to project delays. One common way to manage these potential delays is to
reduce the scope of what is to be delivered. This can lead to ﬁnally delivering
something on time, but the scope has been pared down so that no business
value is delivered. In other cases, testing and quality checks are reduced or
eliminated in order to maintain the project schedule. Unfortunately, many
organizations reward this type of behavior. Delivering something on time is a
prevailing theme.
R E C O M M E N D A T I O N
Reward project teams for producing quality results.
This includes validated data and well-tested applications. This also means that
applications indeed support the business in a valuable way. It must not be accep-
table to reduce the scope so that little or no value is delivered. Part of this change
in deadline focus also means that project change requests are viewed in a positive
light. Project issue logs should be full of open items needing to be addressed.
Teams should not be penalized for being honest about progress.
Failing to Uphold Organizational Discipline
Despite an impression that data warehousing is glamorous, most of the work
to build one is not. The type of work needed to develop and implement a
successful data warehouse is detailed and painstaking. Project tasks are often

24
Part I
■The Essentials of Data Warehousing
tackled with excitement, but as the realities of the project sink in, enthusiasm
begins to wane. Data analysis may sound ﬁne in a project plan, but having to
crawl through hundreds of data ﬁelds is time-consuming, and can be difﬁcult
as well. Systems professionals have an aptitude and interest in this type of
detailed data work. Business professionals rarely do—after all, if they did they
would probably have become systems professionals!
The primary areas of effort for a data warehouse revolve around the
data itself. When thinking about data, most people think about the technical
aspects—where the data is stored, what computer programs may access or
use it and who to call in systems if you have a problem. The technical care
and feeding of data is only a part of the picture. It is also important to
understand the business deﬁnition of each data element, why it matters to
the organization, and how the data should or should not be used. Resources
must be assigned to work on these business aspects of data. This is where true
discipline comes into play. It is much easier to simply move data around than
it is to ﬁgure out what data is needed and then determine where to ﬁnd it.
This discipline is needed not only for the initial project, but also going forward
into the future. The need to develop and adhere to good data practices never
ceases.
Organizations that have not been successful with other initiatives that
require long-term discipline need to be up-front about this. Strategies must be
developed to ensure long-term discipline. A lack of data discipline does not
mean failure, it simply means that the business must be willing to accept and
use data as it is. This may be sufﬁcient to support today’s business needs.
R E C O M M E N D A T I O N
Adequate resources need to be allocated to build
and maintain a sustainable data warehouse environment. Many organizations
allocate enough systems resources for project development but neglect to allocate
business resources. Business representatives must be responsible for providing
guidance, answering questions, and resolving data problems during a data ware-
house project. Additionally, to ensure proper organizational discipline, business
processes must be put in place to address long-term maintenance of data deﬁni-
tions and data preparation rules. In addition, resources must be allocated to
support and address ongoing business data responsibilities.
Lacking Business Process Change
The impact that a data warehouse can have on an organization goes far beyond
getting reports faster. Automating what is done today does not dramatically
change business results. It is much more valuable to change how things are
done. The data warehouse can be a catalyst to help make these changes.
The data warehouse should be used to provide historical information and to

Chapter 1
■Gaining Data Warehouse Success
25
highlight the most important things that need attention today. This can be
done at many different levels within the organization.
For example, the executive team might see a sharp increase in claims
activity and evaluate the need for setting up additional ﬁnancial reserves.
The claims managers might need to review stafﬁng plans in order to keep up
with the increase in activity. The actuaries might need to perform analysis
to identify underlying causes for the increased claims activity (unless it is a
result of a natural disaster). The underwriters might need to reevaluate which
policies are issued and renewed to ensure that the company continues to
maintain ﬁnancial stability . On an individual level, the data warehouse can
also be used to have customer service representatives proactively contact clai-
mants to communicate claim status, especially if it is taking longer than
expected to resolve a claim. All of these activities are done periodically as a
natural course of running the business, but changing these processes to utilize
the data warehouse can inﬂuence the timing and sequence of these tasks.
Unfortunately, many organizations simply use the data warehouse as a
gloriﬁed report generator. While it is true that the data warehouse can provide
more accurate, integrated, and timely reports, signiﬁcant long-term beneﬁts
are derived when report results and analyses drive changes to how business
is conducted.
R E C O M M E N D A T I O N
Use of a data warehouse can be daunting, especially
for people who have not been able to get to data themselves in the past. Staff
members can feel intimidated and unprepared to meet the new expectations.
Appropriate education must be provided to ensure that the group has the skills
necessary to use the data warehouse. This education must include both the
mechanics of using the warehouse and an understanding of how to use or analyze
the data effectively.
Care must also be taken when making changes to business processes. When
developing process changes, it is helpful to include employees, who often have
great ideas and insight that cannot be found elsewhere. This inclusion also creates
a more open attitude for embracing the changes. Business process changes may
not be done in a single sweeping effort, but evolve over time, as use of the data
warehouse becomes a regular part of daily work.
Narrowing the Focus Too Much
Because a broad goal of loading all of the data and then looking for oppor-
tunities to improve is rarely successful, many organizations have wedded
themselves to the other end of the spectrum. With this approach, the require-
ments for a project are deﬁned in a concrete, speciﬁc manner to deliver a set of
key performance indicators, or perhaps the 25 most important data elements

26
Part I
■The Essentials of Data Warehousing
have been identiﬁed. While this can narrow the scope of a project, it can also
lead to signiﬁcant challenges in the future.
With this type of narrow focus, the emphasis is indeed on the business,
which is good, but often only the data speciﬁed is extracted and loaded. After
looking at the requested data, it becomes obvious that some of it is as expected,
some of it is not what was intended, and other data may not yield any insight
even though it is was requested. This results in the need to change the data
that is needed, which requires going back to the beginning.
Another common problem with too narrow a focus is apparent when
follow-up questions are asked. Often, data is requested at the summarized level
to represent an entire company or group. When the more detailed questions are
asked to better understand why a certain number is high or low, the data is not
available. This was a common downfall of the executive information systems
that were popular in the 1980s. Although the development and maintenance
of performance dashboards is much easier, the same potential pitfall exists.
R E C O M M E N D A T I O N
Because both too broad a focus and too narrow a
focus on the business is bad, there must be a middle ground that is more
successful. The best balance is achieved when the underlying data needed to
create performance indicators is loaded in the data warehouse and made available
to support detailed analysis. Executives and high-level managers can drill down
into the data themselves or rely on their employees to follow up on the more
detailed analysis. Either way, the data is available to support the needed analysis.
Another beneﬁt of loading detailed data is that often very interesting and possibly
valuable data may live alongside the speciﬁc elements requested. By pulling all
useful business data, rather than just one ﬁeld of immediate interest, the data
warehouse supports multiple levels of analysis and future changes. The effort
required to pull along these additional ﬁelds is often not signiﬁcant. The most
effort is needed to integrate even one element from each source, rather than
multiple elements.
For example, it can be hard work aligning product codes from non-integrated
systems, but the amount of effort needed to integrate the product codes is the
same whether one uses one data element from each source or ﬁfteen elements
from each source. Given that the level of effort does not increase dramatically,
why not bring forward other useful business data at the outset? To increase
long-term beneﬁts, it is critical that designs for data delivery and preparation not
be limited to a speciﬁc set of business measures. The design of the data access
and analysis components of the data warehouse can indeed focus on the speciﬁc
requirements at hand.

Resting on Your Laurels
Some organizations have realized great business success for many years.
The people in these companies have little incentive to change. The way that
business has been done in the past still works well and continues to yield
proﬁts. As long as success continues, it is extremely difﬁcult to effectively
deploy a data warehousing environment. A similar culture may also exist
in larger organizations, where individual employees may not feel directly
connected to business results.
The process of developing a data warehouse requires that business rules
regarding how data is processed must be reviewed and possibly changed.
Rules and guidelines for integrating data from independent systems must be
deﬁned. Even the basic content and quality of existing databases is scrutinized.
This is not easy, in any situation. When there is no real business reason to
expend the effort, the chances for success dwindle.
Nonetheless, data warehouses can be effectively deployed in highly suc-
cessful organizations when there is a culture and mindset to stay ahead of the
competition.
R E C O M M E N D A T I O N
Take an honest assessment of the need for business
change. If the business can likely continue for the next three to ﬁve years as is,
then perhaps the time is not right for data warehousing. If change is necessary to
continue market strength or to adapt with the marketplace, then data warehousing
is likely to help the organization. All data warehouse initiatives must be positioned
as part of an overall strategy to take the company into the future. Data ware-
housing must be accompanied by other initiatives to help the organization change
business processes and the culture. Individuals must see how their work contrib-
utes to the overall success of the company.
Relying on the Technology Fix
Organizations often seek a simple solution to a set of very complex chal-
lenges. No matter how sophisticated technology becomes, it will not solve
fundamental organizational and business issues. Purchasing and installing
the latest technology will not overcome fundamental business process ﬂaws.
Technology does not solve data quality or integration problems either, but it
can help a company address their challenges.
Businesses sometimes believe that swapping technologies will correct the
problems of a data warehouse. If a data warehouse is ﬂoundering, the easiest
thing to point at is a speciﬁc tool. Before changing technologies, however, it is
worthwhile to evaluate the current environment. Newer versions of existing

28
Part I
■The Essentials of Data Warehousing
software may resolve outstanding issues and provide additional functionality,
but if the current version of a tool does not meet the organization’s needs, then
it may be worthwhile to survey the marketplace for other options.
Keep in mind that each tool has its own strengths and weaknesses. You
may be trading in a known set of weaknesses for the promise of a new set of
strengths without really understanding the new weaknesses. The cost to swap
tools may be greater than the potential beneﬁt of the new tool. Moreover, there
are additional costs to retrain both technical and business users of a new tool;
and still other costs associated with converting applications and uses of the
existing tool.
R E C O M M E N D A T I O N
Evaluate all aspects of the current data warehouse
environment, not just technology. Keep in mind that technology alone does not
address business, process, or data problems.
The bottom line? Evaluate and understand all aspects of a struggling data
warehouse before making drastic changes. Removing any single roadblock
may not yield the desired results, as multiple roadblocks may need to be
addressed with a comprehensive strategy.
Getting the Right People Involved
Once a data warehouse project is approved, the challenges of stafﬁng the
project team begin. Unfortunately, the best resources to help are usually
already overbooked, so the available employees are assigned to the project.
These people are often lacking the necessary experience or skills needed.
The most successful datawarehouse projectsare ﬁlled withthe most valuable
business and technical employees. These people have a lot of knowledge about
the company, how it works, where data is stored, and the secret handshakes
needed to gain access.
It is difﬁcult to allocate these highly valued resources to a new project
because they often play an integral role in the daily functioning of the
business and other special initiatives, yet these are the people who help
resolve crisis after crisis. These resources must be allowed to participate in
the data warehouse project. By leveraging their knowledge and experience,
the existing data problems can be addressed, enabling the data warehouse to
serve as the foundation of the company’s efforts to move forward.
Another common mistake is hiring new staff to ﬁll the business and technical
roles. While adding new staff members is beneﬁcial in the long run, this
can create a signiﬁcant problem at ﬁrst. New employees do not typically
know enough about how the business is run or what data is currently used.
Nonetheless, new employees do bring a wealth of ideas about what is possible,

Chapter 1
■Gaining Data Warehouse Success
29
and often have a realistic understanding of the difﬁculties in weaving their
way around the data in its current form.
R E C O M M E N D A T I O N
Even if the most experienced staff members cannot
participate full-time on a data warehouse project, these valuable resources need
to provide regular guidance and direction. From a business perspective, get other
staff members to pick up some of the daily responsibilities for key personnel. This
may mean brining in additional help—you can’t expect everyone else in the group
to go from 110% to 120% effort. From a technical perspective, it is important to
keep your staff involved and informed about what the data warehouse is, and how
and why it is built. It is risky to turn the entire project over to a third party because
they will eventually leave with all the business and technical knowledge.
At a minimum, hire contractors to backﬁll some of the daily operations work so
that key technical personnel (DBAs, architects, and lead developers) are able to
participate in the project. Another technical resource constraint is access to the
key individuals who understand and intimately know the source system and data.
The data warehouse team must have regular access to these individuals in order to
understand the existing data. Major errors can be made in pulling data without the
appropriate background knowledge. This is often not discovered until much closer
to deployment.
Finally, if the appropriate resources are not being made available from
a business and/or technical perspective, then the true priority of the data
warehouse must be evaluated.
Finding Lost Institutional Knowledge
Over the years, application systems have been developed to automate business
processes and apply business rules and logic. In addition to these systems that
run the business, a series of programs, SAS routines, or complex spreadsheets
have been developed to meet reporting and analytical needs. Many of these
reports and analyses have now been in place for years, but over time the
fundamental purpose of a report may be lost.
In addition, the business rules underlying the criteria for the report have
been embedded in code that is simply run on a regular basis. Too often, a
description of these rules and the business rationale behind them has been lost.
Therefore, when the data warehouse team is applying pressure to understand
the current business practices, the business community may honestly no longer
have that knowledge. This is a fairly common situation, and one that does not
warrant looking for someone to blame. It is important to acknowledge that
this is the case and work from there.
R E C O M M E N D A T I O N
One’s ﬁrst impulse is to read the programs or dissect
the spreadsheets. After many hours of tedious work, the business logic can be

found, but the rationale cannot. The result is merely a better understanding of the
status quo, which is probably not meeting all of the business’ needs. As an alter-
native, step back and ﬁgure out what is really needed to understand and run the
business. This is a chance to deﬁne, or redeﬁne, how you want to look at the
group, department, or company. Starting from a clean slate seems scary, but it can
be a much faster, and more direct and more useful approach than trying to
replicate an existing, potentially archaic set of reports.
Summary
Building a data warehouse is challenging, but it can also provide great rewards.
This chapter offered a general overview of data warehousing and illustrated
how it can serve as a potential foundation for realizing business value. The
next chapter has answers to some of the most frequently asked questions about
data warehousing, and subsequent chapters provide more in-depth coverage
about how to build and sustain a successful data warehouse.

The Executive’s FAQ for Data
Warehousing
When you are in a leadership role within an organization, you are charged
with the responsibility of setting corporate goals and deﬁning the strategic
initiatives to meet them. You inﬂuence and inspire others in the organization
to help fulﬁll the vision and achieve these goals. This is simple in theory, but
much tougher in practice. You need to ask questions and challenge the status
quo. As a business or IT leader, it is easier to ask questions and understand
the answers within your part of the organization, but there can be a high
degree of frustration when working across IT and business boundaries. When
business leaders are asked whether they are getting what they need from their
IT organization to run their business, or when IT leaders are asked whether
they are getting what they need from the business to build a data warehouse
that will meet business challenges, the answer from both is often the same: no.
Part of the problem is an assumption that both business and IT inherently
understand each other’s needs, when in reality the only way to truly under-
stand the requirements is to work side by side and learn from each other. As
leaders, we want to see a return on our investment (ROI). In this case, that
investment is the partnership between business and IT. If you don’t invest
in the partnership, then you will never see the return you want in your data
warehouse.
This chapter is intended to provide a big dose of reality. It consists of a
high-level summary of questions that are frequently asked by executives and
senior managers regarding DW development. These are complex issues
and often require additional dialogue to clarify the question and provide an
appropriate answer for each organization. Therefore, this chapter shares only a
common interpretation of the question and the essence of the answer. These
topics are covered in much more detail throughout the rest of the book, so
if the short answer doesn’t meet your needs, then follow the references to
subsequent chapters to learn more.

■The Essentials of Data Warehousing
Question: What is the business beneﬁt of a data
warehouse?
Proper implementation and effective use of a data warehouse can provide
signiﬁcant value to an organization. The magnitude and frequency of value
recognition can vary greatly based on your application and industry. For
example, a telecommunications company built an integrated data warehouse
that enabled them to identify potential customers that were ideal for them to
cross-sell other services, and to develop a targeted cross-sales campaign. This
single campaign resulted in approximately $50 million dollars in additional
revenue. More often, the value is not realized by one thing, but a collection of
many different things. A retail organization developed a data warehouse that
enabled them to better analyze sales by store and cost of goods sold. This in
turn enabled them to better target promotions and more effectively negotiate
with their suppliers. The results were a series of negotiations that reduced
cost of goods, and promotions that increased revenue, each adding between
$20,000 and $200,000 to the bottom line.
Answer
While it is nice to know that others have seen success, what you really
want to know is ‘‘what is the beneﬁt to me?’’ Unfortunately, it depends on
many different factors. Without research and a sound understanding of your
organization and the challenges you face, you can’t really put a number on
the potential beneﬁts. However, given the preceding examples, it is hoped
that you can begin to think of areas in your own business that, with the right
information, you could make more proﬁtable or cost effective.
Historically, successful data warehouses have not resulted in a decreased
head count. Typically, the data warehouse enables the organization to make
improvements that result in increased revenue and proﬁt. The magnitude
of the beneﬁt is relative to the size of the organization. If the organization
has $10 million in sales, then it is unlikely that the data warehouse will
immediately provide an additional $5 million to the bottom line. Conversely,
for an organization with revenues in the billions, $5 million in return is more
likely. The types of beneﬁts that have been observed in other organizations
include the following:
Increased understanding of what really drives business
Identiﬁcation of market opportunities
Proactive identiﬁcation of potential problems and the launch of preven-
tative measures

Chapter 2
■The Executive’s FAQ for Data Warehousing
33
Identiﬁcation of opportunities to streamline and improve business pro-
cesses
Development of more effective marketing strategies through target mar-
keting, and improved customer relationship management
Improved quality of products or services
Increased customer satisfaction
Identiﬁcation and monitoring of trends in the industry, such as shifts in
customer behavior or changes in competitors’ pricing strategy
The key to understanding the potential beneﬁt to your organization is
understanding the challenges facing the organization and the data that the
organization already collects. Chapter 5 provides more details about how
to set up a successful project, while Chapter 6 discusses how to gather and
understand business requirements.
Question: How much will it cost?
The cost of a data warehouse is just as wide-ranging as the business ben-
eﬁts. The cost depends on a wide variety of factors, including size of the
organization, the industry, and data complexity. For example, the data needed
to support actuaries within an insurance company is more complex and
requires much more history than the data needed to support the sales orga-
nization of a retailer. Data warehouse budgets can be measured in tens of
thousands to multiple millions per year. Whereas a small organization is
unlikely to spend millions each year, a multibillion-dollar global enterprise
may spend millions on their data warehouse initiatives.
Answer
Most IT organizations are quite capable of compiling costs for technology,
including hardware, software, maintenance, and support. These costs are
deﬁned by the volume of data to be stored, the number of different technologies
to be used, and the number of people who will access the environment.
Data volume has a big impact on the size of the hardware needed to extract,
transform, load, and store. How quickly these processes must run also affects
the size and class of the machine needed. However, the business needs to be
involved to establish the level of detail and the length of history needed for
analysis. It is not acceptable for the business to simply want ‘‘all data for all
time,’’ which has a cost associated with it. This is just not practical.

34
Part I
■The Essentials of Data Warehousing
Many different tools can be used to build a data warehouse environment,
ranging from the programming language used for other application develop-
ment to the purchase of specialized technologies to cleanse, transform, and
load the database. Some organizations support multiple data access tools,
which may include a basic report writer, multiple business intelligence tools,
and perhaps a tool to perform statistical analysis.
Another category of costs that vary greatly are the people. There are costs for
the IT team members to design and build the data warehouse. There are also
costs associated with the business people who are active participants on the
project team. The amount of time and effort required depends upon the scope of
the project and the state of the data itself. If data is well deﬁned, understood and
accurate, then less time will be needed to investigate and correct data quality
problems. The worse the data is today, the more effort is needed to get it into
shape to be useful tomorrow. There will be effort from both IT and the business
to understand data problems and ﬁgure out what to do to correct them.
Once a data warehouse has been released for use, there are ongoing costs
to ensure that proper support and education are provided. Without this
continued support, many data warehouses fail. Ensure that the organization
plans for these ongoing maintenance and enhancement expenses. Usually,
these are offset by the success of the data warehouse.
Chapter 4 explains the different roles for both business and IT project team
members. Chapter 9 discusses the tools and technologies that may be used.
Chapter 10 explores what is involved in preparing the data to be loaded
into the data warehouse. Chapter 12 provides insight into what is needed to
support the data warehouse once it is put into production.
Question: How long will it take?
It depends. You must ﬁrst deﬁne the business problem you are trying to
address. This will help deﬁne what are you trying to build. There is a dramatic
difference between the time required to build a data warehouse from scratch
versus building a few new reports to deliver via a new dashboard using a tool
that you have already been using. Variables that can have a big impact on how
long it takes include the following:
How many different business groups are to be supported?
How many different data sources will be included?
Is the data well deﬁned and well understood by the business?
Is the data well structured and documented from a systems perspective?
How easy is it to integrate the data from these different sources?
Is this the ﬁrst data warehouse project?

Chapter 2
■The Executive’s FAQ for Data Warehousing
35
How much experience does your staff have in building a data warehouse?
Will critical subject matter experts (from both the business and IT) be
available when needed? Will they have time to actively participate in the
project?
How quickly can you make decisions needed to design and build the
data warehouse? Sample topics requiring decisions include deﬁning
the formulas for business measures and how to handle anomalies in the
source system data.
Answer
In order to provide a glimpse into how long it may take, let’s look at building
a data warehouse from scratch. After having worked on hundreds of different
data warehouse projects, I’ve found that there are clear breakpoints for
estimating efforts. The ﬁrst part of a project gathers true business requirements
through conversations with real business users, and develops the dimensional
model that will meet those business needs. This helps both to clarify what
is actually needed and to gain a good understanding of the data. This effort
should include exploring possible sources of data to populate the database.
The dimensional model provides the vision for what the data needs to look
like to support the business reporting and analyses that need to be done.
Based upon years of experience, it typically takes six to eight weeks to
gather requirements, and another six to eight weeks to develop a compre-
hensive dimensional model, the ﬁrst time. The number of different groups
that will participate in providing requirements, and their availability, deter-
mines the time needed to gather and document the requirements. The number
of data sources, the sheer number of data elements, and the complexity of
the data deﬁne the time needed to complete the dimensional model. Generally,
these can be completed in three to four months. Although you may use some
external resources to accomplish this process, it is critical to have your internal
resources intimately involved.
Many people are surprised at the length of time described here. In order to
develop a sound, sustainable data warehouse, it is critical the requirements and
design be done thoroughly. When the ﬁrst project builds a solid foundation,
then subsequent projects are likely to take less time and re-work is minimized.
Once the requirements have been collected and the data has been modeled,
you should have sufﬁcient information to be able to estimate the effort required
to build the data warehouse and develop the business intelligence solution.
This can range from a matter of weeks for small projects that start with solid
reliable data to many months for larger, more complex data.
The effort to build a robust data warehouse and business intelligence
solution is quite different from starting with a sketch of a dashboard that

36
Part I
■The Essentials of Data Warehousing
needs to be built. The key performance indicators on that dashboard may
come from ten different sources that do not integrate well. This often results
in the development of one-off reports that populate only a portion of the
dashboard. These one-off reports often do not have the underlying detailed
data used to build them, which limits the user’s ability to drill down into more
detail, thereby decreasing the overall value of the dashboard.
In short, the answer to how long it will take depends on where you are
today and what you are trying to build.
Question: How can I ensure success?
As a leader in the organization, there are several things that you can do to help
ensure the success of the data warehouse.
Answer
The ﬁrst thing you can do is learn about data warehousing. Invest your time to
understand what a data warehouse is and what it takes to build and maintain
one. Take the time to learn more about the components and what needs to
be done for the areas where you will participate. This helps by improving
the level of communication between business and IT staff members. For the
IT readers, learn about the business. Learn about the industry that your
organization is part of and how the company works. This also improves the
level of communication with your business counterparts.
The next most important thing is to listen. Too much time is spent talking
and jumping to conclusions. Step back and really listen. Understand what
is being communicated. If you don’t understand, then ask questions to gain
a better understanding. Too often, important messages are discounted or
ignored when brought up internally. In many cases, external consultants are
brought in and conclude the same thing that your own people already did.
This is not to say that there is never a need to get an impartial assessment
or opinion, but make sure that you take the time to really listen to your own
people.
Finally, follow through on your commitments. When others in the organiza-
tion challenge the project team, stand up for what is needed. Help the project
team gain access to the right business personnel, support their efforts to work
toward a single deﬁnition for each data element, and ensure that sufﬁcient
resources are allocated. Too many managers support a data warehouse ini-
tially, but then don’t allocate the time and resources necessary to ensure that
it will be designed and implemented correctly.
Chapter 4 describes the importance of partnership, and the speciﬁc roles
and responsibilities for both business and IT personnel involved in a data
warehouse.

Chapter 2
■The Executive’s FAQ for Data Warehousing
37
Question: Do other companies really build these in
90 days?
The ability to deliver in 90 days is closely related to the previous
question—how long will it take? Again, the most important factor to consider
is what you are trying to build. If you are putting in place the foundation for
the future of the data warehouse, bringing in all new technology and starting
from scratch (or starting over) to meet business needs, then you are unlikely
to accomplish this in 90 days. However, if you are building new reports and
analyses that use data that is already loaded, this can often be done in 90 days
or less.
Answer
Making time estimates can be very deceptive if you only look at how good
the technology is. The tools can be set up fairly quickly and can move data
around faster than ever before, so why can’t we build a data warehouse in 90
days? A good data warehouse is not about the technology. The value lies in the
effort made to deﬁne the data elements and develop the business rules needed
to clean and integrate the data. This requires a great deal of thought and
discussion among and between business groups and IT. Then decisions must
be made. Regardless of how fast technology can implement those decisions, it
still takes time to research and make them.
It is also important to understand what is actually being delivered from
a 90-day project. Often, it is not a complete robust environment but a quick
prototype. If the prototype is not quite what is needed, then another 90-day
effort is launched to change what is delivered. Many organizations iterate
many times, hoping to get it right. It is important to understand and agree
upon what must be in place for success. Number one on the list? The data
warehouse must be driven by well-deﬁned business requirements.
The amount of time required to put a robust data warehouse in place can
vary greatly. Rather than approach this by demanding a completed project in
90 days, determine what results you want and then ﬁgure out what has to be
done to develop a sustainable, long-term solution.
Once you have a solid foundation in place, the project schedules can be
shortened. The work to enhance a dimension or to add another fact table is
much less than the work to start at the beginning. It is also much faster to
build new BI reports and perform analyses using data that is already loaded
into the data warehouse. Many of these subsequent projects can be done in
90 days, including the testing and release activities. Ultimately, investing up
front to get a solid foundation in place will save the organization a great deal
of time and money.

■The Essentials of Data Warehousing
Question: How will we know we are doing this
right?
There is no single ‘‘right’’ way to build a data warehouse, which makes it
difﬁcult to assess how well you are doing. Therefore, there is no cookie-cutter
scorecard that you can use to benchmark your progress against the industry.
While you may not know whether you’ll attain the projected beneﬁts, reason-
able adherence to industry best practices and sound project management will
help you determine whether things are going ‘‘right.’’ In the end, you will be
able to tell when the data warehouse is able to support the business to meet
its objectives. When everyone relies on the data warehouse to get their data
and use it for their analyses, then it is working. Another sign of success is an
increasing amount of requests for additional data and more reports or analy-
ses. This means that there is conﬁdence in the data warehouse environment,
and that users see new ways that it could help.
Answer
As with any project, you can track and monitor progress compared to the
project plan. Are the tasks being completed? Are project deliverables being
ﬁnished? If not, you need to ask what is holding things up; and then you need
to apply sound management and judgment to ﬁgure out what can be done
to help. For example, if it is taking a long time to gather requirements, ask
the project team why. If the project team is having difﬁculty getting meetings
scheduled with key individuals, then work with the appropriate managers to
see what is happening. Too often, a lot of time is wasted while the project
team waits on other people. Eventually, the situation will be escalated, but
your active involvement can keep things moving. Requests that come through
business channels often get higher priority than requests from an unknown
project manager or IT person.
It can be helpful to set up periodic reviews and checkpoints that go beyond
basic status meetings. When possible, these should involve others across
the organization with data warehousing experience. This helps leverage the
experiences of other groups. Some reviews should be scheduled at regular
intervals, regardless of what project deliverables have been completed. This
helps to identify problems before they get out of hand. Checkpoints are
typically done when major milestones have been met. These enable a review of
the results, such as a review of the data architecture, data model, or dashboard
design.
Although there are no guarantees for success, strong executive sponsorship,
partnership between the business and IT, hard work, sound planning, and a
lot of communication certainly help.

Chapter 2
■The Executive’s FAQ for Data Warehousing
39
Question: Why didn’t this work last time? What is
different this time?
Just as there are many factors for success, unfortunately there are just as
many that contribute to failure. For every highly publicized successful data
warehouse success story, many more have not achieved those amazing results.
Most data warehouse projects deliver some beneﬁt, some have limited results,
and there are a few downright failures. When any project comes to an end, time
should be spent on evaluation. It is helpful for the technical team to compile
their ideas of what worked well, what could be improved and how, as well
as things that did not work at all. The same should be done from a business
perspective. Then, a complete review should pull both perspectives into a
complete assessment of the project. More details about a post-implementation
review can be found in Chapter 12.
This evaluation must be done in an honest, nonjudgmental manner in
order to get to the heart of what happened. Rather than look for someone to
blame, examine what did not work as planned and explore opportunities for
improvement. Collect ideas from everyone, not just the high-level people and
managers. Individual contributors often have great insight into what could be
improved.
Answer
Taking the time for a review is good closure for any project, but it is particularly
important for those that had problems. This should be done for projects that
are canceled before they are completed too.
In order to get the next project started on the right foot, you may need more
help. This may require hiring someone with strong data warehouse experience
or bringing in consultants to help train and mentor your staff while working on
the project. In order to change the outcome, different activities and steps must
be taken. These new participants often have great ideas and can recommend
what needs to be done. In order to be more successful with this attempt, you
need to listen to their advice and do what they recommend.
Chapter 12 shares details about data warehouse projects that have stalled,
along with ideas about how to correct them.
Question: Do we have the right technology in
place?
You can purchase a number of different kinds of technology to help build and
use a data warehouse. Chapter 9 provides an overview of the different cate-
gories of technology that may be used and some insight into how to determine

40
Part I
■The Essentials of Data Warehousing
what products are best for you. However, once the data warehouse has been
built, you may still wonder whether you have the right technology in place.
Answer
In order to determine the viability of your technology choices, several key
questions must be answered:
Does the environment work?
Is the environment stable?
Does it work fast enough?
Can you maintain it?
Do you have enough functionality to meet both current and near-future
needs?
Can you afford to keep using it?
While these questions can be asked of the overall environment, if there are
any major concerns, then you need to look more closely at each of the different
parts. Perhaps the ETL system is working ﬁne but you don’t have acceptable
query performance or the data access tool cannot perform all the calculations
that you need.
There may also be a different level of satisfaction between the IT and
business groups. The data access tool may be easy to install and keep up and
running, but if it cannot perform all the calculations that the business groups
need, then it really is not working.
Problems with the current environment can result from many contributing
factors. Sometimes the tool itself no longer meets your needs. However, in
many cases, a closer look may reveal that the tool does provide that function
but is limited by how you have implemented it. Before tossing out any tools,
make sure you look carefully at how they are installed and are being used.
Perhaps you merely need to ensure you are running the current release of that
product, or you may be able to make simple changes that enable you to better
exploit what you already have. Look at Chapter 9 to learn more about technical
architecture, and at Chapter 12 to understand what is needed to maintain the
technical environment of a production data warehouse.
Question: Are we the only company with data
warehouse problems?
It can seem as though everyone else is having fantastic success with little or no
trouble building and leveraging their data warehouse. The vendors describe

how wonderful their products are and how much success their other clients
are having. You can ﬁnd dozens of articles that make it seem like the entire
world has ﬁgured out how to develop an effective warehouse. This can be
intimidating and make others feel behind the times. The truth is that even
the most successful organizations face problems with their data warehouses.
Those that are able to address their problems and overcome challenges are
the organizations that are seeing the biggest results. Based upon years of
experience and the opportunity to interact with many different organizations,
I can tell you that you are deﬁnitely not alone!
Answer
It is useful to be able to put things in the right perspective. This can be
done through conversations with peers in other organizations and networking
through industry interest groups. Now that the data warehousing industry
has really come of age, many resources are available to you. Seek out industry
groups with a focus on data warehousing or related topics. There are many
IT associations that have data warehouse or business intelligence subgroups.
The Data Warehousing Institute offers major conferences, seminars, and local
chapters. Any of these provide the opportunity to meet people with similar
issues on their mind.
There is also a great deal of interest from business groups to learn more
about and discuss data warehousing. Explore business industry groups and
ask colleagues for their ideas. Check out social networking sites such as
LinkedIn. If you don’t ﬁnd a group, take the initiative and start one. There are
probably dozens of people who are just as interested in these topics—it only
takes one person to get something started.
There are also opportunities to meet and exchange ideas with others at
product vendor user conferences. These groups have general concerns and can
be engaged in dialogue about topics that are speciﬁc to the technology that
you are using.
You are not alone. The good news is that there are often proven techniques
to address the speciﬁc challenges facing your data warehouse. You just need
to reach out to ﬁnd these proven methods.
Question: Will I get one version of the truth?
How many meetings have you sat in on and looked at a proﬁt number on
four reports that were all different? Often, data is pulled from many different
systems, by different people, using different criteria. This results in reports
that provide different and possibly conﬂicting data. Too much time is spent

42
Part I
■The Essentials of Data Warehousing
trying to ﬁgure out which set of numbers is correct, which leaves little time to
truly interpret and understand the data, and less time to make decisions. One
fundamental objective of data warehousing is to provide a single environment
for all reporting. The objective is to indeed provide a single source of the truth.
Answer
The short answer is yes, provided you have the right level of executive
commitment—that is, willingness to invest the time, effort, and business
expertise needed to ﬁx the problem. While this is a clear objective, it is not easy
to attain. There are some technical challenges, but working toward a single
version of data typically requires a very signiﬁcant level of commitment and
effort from the business community. The business should drive the effort to
achieve a single version of the data, and IT can help to maintain it.
There are two major areas that warrant discussion. First, it is critical to set
up names and deﬁnitions for the data that consistently and accurately describe
what it means. How data is pulled out of source systems and manipulated
changes what the resulting data looks like. Consistent and meaningful business
rules must be deﬁned so that IT can build the appropriate mechanisms and
controls. Who decides what the data means and deﬁnes these business rules?
The business does, not IT, and this is typically the largest part of the overall
effort.
Providing consistent data requires a lot of communication between different
parts of the organization. Each group must clarify the data it needs and
compare that with similar data used by other groups. Sometimes the data is
supposed to be the same, but over time the meaning and use have drifted
apart. Hard decisions must be made to bring these back together. In other
cases, there are legitimate differences that need to be clariﬁed. Unique labels
must be used to differentiate between the data elements.
Second, the organization must be committed to working toward one version
of the truth. It seems like a desirable and reasonable objective to everyone, but
if working toward this goal impedes the progress of an individual project, the
willingness to comply begins to fade. The development of this single version
of the truth must be a long-term strategic objective. If the organization is not
committed from the top down to dedicate the people, time, effort, and dollars
required to deﬁne your business data, you will never reach a single version
of the truth. There must be strong senior management support to make the
investment in time and money to ensure that the right long-term steps are
taken. If not, your organization will continue to experience a proliferation of
disparate data and reports that do not match.
You can indeed realize a single version of the truth if your organization
works diligently to make it happen. There must be ongoing commitment from
the business to help deﬁne the data, and IT must ensure that individual projects

Chapter 2
■The Executive’s FAQ for Data Warehousing
43
are chartered to adhere to these and then follow through—even if it means
that your project takes a few weeks longer. If you insist on taking shortcuts,
then you jeopardize the ability to maintain and deliver this consistent view of
data. Chapter 8 provides much more detail about what is involved in working
toward a consistent view of the data.
Question: Why can’t we just use our current
systems?
In order to answer that question you need to understand the difference between
running the business and managing the business. ‘‘Running’’ the business is
the regular set of activities that keeps the business going, such as keeping
factories operational, processing orders, cutting checks for claim payments,
ensuring that the ATM network is working, and that the airplanes are taking
off. These are the functions that deﬁne the business itself. These are what keep
the company running. The activities that ‘‘manage’’ the business are those that
track and monitor how well the business is running, and make decisions about
the direction and strategy of the organization.
Operational reports are those that are produced from the systems that keep
the business running. They report the current state and help make adjustments
that can be put into action right now. Because the data is current, a report
that shows the number of calls on hold will return different results each time
it is run. If too many calls are on hold, additional staff may be pulled from
the break room or supervisors may handle a few calls. The reports provide
immediate feedback and the resulting decisions are used to keep that business
function running smoothly.
In contrast, management reports are used to identify trends and patterns.
Perhaps there is higher call volume on the third Tuesday morning of every
month. Identifying this pattern would enable the managers to ensure that
additional staff were scheduled to work that day to avoid long wait times.
Monitoring the overall call volume is necessary to plan for the future. If
business continues to grow at the current pace, then three more people will
be needed by summer to handle the call volume. This is important to ensure
appropriate lead time to hire and train new employees.
Depending upon your role in the company, you may use both operational
and management reports. The operational reports provide guidance as to what
to do now, whereas the management reports can help provide perspective so
that you can plan for tomorrow, next week, and next year.
Most organizations already have both types of systems in place. Oper-
ational applications include those that handle the general ledger, accounts
payable/receivable, order processing, policy administration, claims handling,

44
Part I
■The Essentials of Data Warehousing
travel reservations, manufacturing, and production controls. Many organiza-
tions also have separate databases used to support reporting and analysis, or
perhaps a full-ﬂedged data warehouse. These reporting environments exist
because historically the technologies were not able to handle both operational
and management reporting at the same time. This is one of the primary reasons
that data warehousing started.
Answer
There have been signiﬁcant advancements in technology to help address these
technical challenges. Databases can handle a lot more data and provide good
performance. Often, the data that is needed for reporting exists in more than
one operational system. Products have been developed to enable business
rules to be set up to support integration of this data on-the-ﬂy. As you hear
about these advancements, it seems even more puzzling to not just use the
current systems.
While these technologies are interesting, the real challenge is the nature and
state of the data itself. These technologies will only work if the organization’s
data can support them. The following key requirements need to be met:
You need to have good performance of queries to support reporting and
analysis.
The performance of the operational application system itself must not be
effected.
The underlying system must retain sufﬁcient history to support the busi-
ness needs.
The data from different systems must be aligned to integrate easily or the
business rules to apply to the data must be straightforward to be done
quickly on-the-ﬂy (without affecting performance of either purpose).
The data must be clean and accurate.
There must be sufﬁcient reference data available to support analysis
from different perspectives. This includes groupings and categorizations
that are used for reporting but are not required to keep the transactions
ﬂowing.
Most organizations cannot meet these key objectives by using their data
directly in their operational systems, and this continues to be the case for a
long time. If you can’t effectively use the data in your current operational
systems, you need to build a data warehouse. This book will help you
understand what a data warehouse is and highlight the key things that need
to happen to ensure its success.

Question: Will the data warehouse replace our old
systems?
The short answer is no, a data warehouse does not take the place of any oper-
ational application systems. The systems that run the business will continue
to function. The data created and captured by those application systems will
be used for business analysis and therefore become the input to the data ware-
house environment. There is a possibility that existing reporting systems (used
to manage the business) may be retired, as the data warehouse can support the
reporting and analysis currently done with that system. Often, these reporting
systems are not meeting the needs of the business, creating the impetus for
building a data warehouse. These older reporting systems may not have all the
data needed to support the business today, and they were likely built using
outdated technology. When the appropriate data is available through the data
warehouse, newer tools can be used to recreate critical reports and analyses
needed to provide continuous support to the business.
Some reporting and analysis systems have a great deal of sophisticated logic
already built and are meeting a speciﬁc business need. In order to maintain
consistency across the organization, the data warehouse may be used to feed
data into this specialized system.
Question: Who needs to be involved?
Broad organizational involvement and active participation is needed for a
successful data warehouse project. The exact level of involvement varies by
group within an organization, but active participation and commitment to
the success of the data warehouse is necessary from both the business and
IT groups. Executive sponsorship and active ongoing support is critical. This
support can be a signiﬁcant factor in the success of the data warehouse.
There is also a need for assistance from representatives from the target audi-
ence of the data warehouse. Most of these business participants will provide
input, review and critique the design, and assist the team in understanding and
properly handling data-related issues. This does not usually require a large
time commitment, but their involvement is important to ensure that what is
designed and built will indeed be helpful. These participants should represent
more than just the initial target audience. Other closely related functions or
groups that will beneﬁt from using the data should also provide input. This
enables the project team to take these additional needs into account early in
the process in order to avoid or minimize future changes needed to support
these other groups.

46
Part I
■The Essentials of Data Warehousing
It is extremely important to have one or more individuals from the business
be full-time members of the project team. These representatives serve as the
daily liaison between the project team and the rest of the business community.
They also actively assist the project to understand and document require-
ments. This includes overall business requirements as well as the deﬁnition of
individual data elements and the business rules for processing and handling
the data. While this business analyst does not need to know all the answers,
he or she does have to know who else to turn to.
A core set of IT personnel will form the project team. This is usually
comprised of a project manager, a systems analyst, a data modeler or architect
and developers. There are often two different types of developers: those
who write the ETL system and those who build the business intelligence
(BI) application. Other technical people are needed periodically to support
network, security, and database needs.
Chapter 4 describes the speciﬁc roles and responsibilities for both business
and IT personnel involved in a data warehouse.
Question: Do we know where we are going? How
will we know when we get there?
It may seem as though there is a lot of activity but the actual vision and ﬁnal
result are not clear. This can be a result of a number of factors. Sometimes
there is no formal vision or strategy in place. Other times, there is a vision but
it is has not been clearly communicated. In both scenarios, a lot of effort can
be spent without any real, sustainable progress. It can be easy to fall into this
pattern. For example, when an immediate need crops up to address one part
of the business, we scramble to get a quick set of reports created. Then another
area has a different urgent need, so a dashboard is created to support that
group. Without a clear and communicated vision, these activities can consume
your organization. The challenge is to balance these short-term needs while
working toward long-term goals.
Answer
First, it is important to ﬁgure out where you are in the process. Techniques
for how to do this can be found in Chapter 3. Based upon these ﬁndings,
there may be a need to better understand business requirements (Chapter 6),
stabilize the technical environment (Chapter 9), or perhaps develop a more
strategic view of the data (Chapters 8 and 9).
Successful data warehouse environments are built over time with a clear
direction and goal in mind. This includes the business objectives and both

Chapter 2
■The Executive’s FAQ for Data Warehousing
47
technical and data architectures that show how this can be accomplished.
The technical architecture deﬁnes what tools and technologies will be used
to perform the many different functions required. This includes the hardware
and database management system to effectively store the data, and the data
access or business intelligence tool needed to access that data. Data architecture
provides the guidelines outlining how data will be organized to achieve the
business goals.
Take the time to set up a vision and long-term strategy for data warehousing.
This provides the roadmap showing where you are going and provides the
capability to determine how close you are getting to that vision. There will be
beneﬁts along the way, so you should not have to wait for the entire vision to
be built before you see any results. The vision is what provides guidance so
that each individual effort or project is helping to take the organization in that
direction. By following through on the vision, you will know ‘‘when you get
there.’’
Question: How do we get started and stay focused?
After reading about data warehousing or attending a conference, there is often
a high level of excitement and enthusiasm. The potential is clear and everyone
wants to get moving. Rather than rush forward, however, take a small step
back and do an assessment of your current situation and conduct some solid
planning.
Answer
The ﬁrst place to start is to ensure that you have a good grasp of what you
already have in place. Chapter 3 can help you with this. After that, you can
deﬁne one or more projects that address the action items that were identiﬁed
when you evaluated the current situation.
Some organizations may only have limited reporting or data warehouse
efforts under their belt. This is really an opportunity to start with a clean slate.
When possible, adhere to proven methods—there is no need for you to blaze
a new trail. The proven methods have established a core of best practices that
have evolved from years of experimentation, with many scars to prove them.
Take advantage of what others have learned in order to build the best data
warehouse that you can.
Many organizations are years into a variety of data warehouse or similar
efforts—usually with varied levels of success. This is the time to collaborate
between the business and IT groups to set the vision for data warehousing
in your organization. With a clear vision in place, individual projects can be

48
Part I
■The Essentials of Data Warehousing
deﬁned to work toward that goal. Step by step, you can move closer to that
goal. When possible, craft these individual projects so that some business value
can be realized with each step. The beneﬁts will grow as you move toward
your vision.
Summary
The process to design, build, and use a data warehouse that will give you a
solid return on your investment is complex and challenging. The good news
is that there are proven methods, techniques, and tools to accomplish these
steps successfully. Understanding what has already been achieved in the data
warehousing industry will help your organization improve the quality and
value of its data warehouse. This part of the book is just the tip of the iceberg.
This basic overview may be sufﬁcient for some people, but most people from
both business and IT will beneﬁt from more in-depth coverage of these topics
throughout the rest of this book. As suggested in the last question, it is
important to have a good understanding of what you currently have in place
in order to address the organization’s reporting and analytical needs. The next
chapter shares an approach to doing just that.

Understanding Where You Are
and Finding Your Way
Most organizations already have some mechanism in place to meet their
reporting needs. This mechanism may be a set of reports that run directly
against the production application systems or reports generated from an
existing data warehouse. Many organizations have multiple data warehouse
attempts under their belt. Some data warehouses have been successful, while
others have never delivered value. In many cases, reports and analysis are
not supported in a formal system at all. Data is pulled from wherever it
can be found, and manually merged into spreadsheets to create reports and
presentations, and used for analysis.
Because you are not starting with a clean slate, it is important to get a
realistic understanding of what reporting and/or data warehouse components
and resources are available and to what extent they are being used.
Making an honest assessment of what has been accomplished to date is
often one of the most difﬁcult things to do. Several years of hard work may
have been invested to build the system currently in place. It usually takes
longer and costs more than what was originally planned, and the results may
have fallen short of expectations. What should be done? Take a deep breath,
step back, and take a little time for reﬂection. This chapter lays out the steps to
help:
Understand the current business situation.
Identify how reporting is currently accomplished.
Assess the effectiveness of existing reporting mechanisms.
Determine what to do next.
Assessing Your Current State
Rather than jumping in either to learn about technology or to dissect an
existing data warehouse, it is better to step back a little further to gain a
51

52
Part II
■The Business Side of Data Warehousing
wider perspective. Once you have a good understanding of the current overall
business environment, then it is time to dig into assessing the data that is
already in place. The success or failure of the current data warehouse might
highlight deeper issues within the organization.
What Is Your Company’s Strategic Direction?
Reading the corporate vision statement or even the beginning text of the
annual report can provide a great deal of insight into the goals and direction
of the organization. This direction dictates what is most important to the
organization and where time and energy should be spent. This is much larger
than any data warehouse effort, but it can provide insight into how a data
warehouse can help support the organization’s efforts to achieve that vision.
A few examples of company goals and their associated opportunities include
the following:
The goal to deliver high-quality products could be supported by using
manufacturing, product returns and defects, and sales data.
The objective to provide superior customer service could beneﬁt from
looking at a comprehensive view of each customer across the enterprise,
and by tracking service calls and customer feedback.
The objective to retain one’s status within the industry as an innovator
could be supported by providing access to reporting and analysis of
research and product development data.
The vision to ensure ﬁnancial strength and stability could be supported
through timely access to ﬁnancial results from the general ledger and
tracking organization reserves and cash ﬂow.
In addition to the stated vision for the organization, there are also other
characteristics of how the organization works that can affect the success of any
data warehouse project. Each of the following scenarios describes a different
company. A brief description of the company’s situation is followed by the
potential impact on any data warehouse initiatives:
Survival mode: The company is cutting costs and simply trying to stay
aﬂoat. Long-term investments are not an option at the moment. Quick
turnaround and limiting expenditures are the name of the game.
Ramiﬁcation: This short-term focus is not good for strategic, long-term
investments such as a data warehouse. If progress and value are not
realized in a matter of months, then projects are cut. For a data warehouse
project, this does not allow the organization to address fundamental data
issues and enterprise integration. When data warehousing principles are

Chapter 3
■Understanding Where You Are and Finding Your Way
53
applied to individual component solutions, there may be immediate,
short-term beneﬁts, but you end up with multiple non-integrating data
marts. These solutions are often discarded because they do not address a
broad perspective but focus only on one thing at a time. A short-term ﬁx
does not equal a sustainable long-term solution.
Staying ahead of the game: Business has always been good. New com-
petition has entered the marketplace, increasing competitive pressures.
Things are OK today, but the company must continue to build its strategic
advantage.
Ramiﬁcation: The company does not want to waste resources on throw-
away solutions. There is a commitment to building a long-term strategic
advantage. Investment in a data warehouse will support the business
initiatives for strategic growth. It is worth taking the time to build the
data warehouse correctly.
Changing with the times: A well-established business needs a face-lift
to compete with new, nimble companies. There is a strong, stable client
base, and the organization is ﬁnancially strong, but it’s not as ﬂexible as
newer companies and is perceived as being a bit stodgy. The organization
is looking for new business channels and product offerings to capture the
interest and business of the younger generation.
Ramiﬁcation: The organization already has policies and procedures in
place for just about everything. Business practices are engrained and
there isn’t much interest in change because ‘‘this is how it has always
been done’’ and it appears to be successful. Looking at the bigger picture,
however, there is a need to shift the organization’s culture to be more open
and creative to address the challenges of the future. The data warehouse
can help to provide new ways to get things done. Speciﬁc plans need to be
made to help the organization through this cultural change. Concentrated
efforts will be required to get the data warehouse built, but then it can
serve as a catalyst for change.
Back to basics: The company has branched out over the past several
years. This has begun to dilute the long-standing core competencies of
the company. Not all of the expansion efforts have been successful. There
is a need to focus on the core business once again.
Ramiﬁcation: Mature systems for the core business keep things running
but do not provide an overall view of the entire enterprise. Rather than
just abandon all of the new business areas, it is necessary to carefully
analyze them, keeping the things that are most proﬁtable and eliminating
the unproﬁtable ventures that deviate too far from the core business. This
requires having a thorough understanding of what is working and what
is not. Because the organization has been taking risks with the expansion,

54
Part II
■The Business Side of Data Warehousing
it will likely be comfortable delving into the data warehouse arena. New
things do not scare them. In fact, the data warehouse can help channel all
the creative energy into the core business.
Global innovator: The company has always been considered a leader
in the industry. Now is the time to take advantage of the changing
marketplace. There are great opportunities to expand into global markets,
but this aggressive growth must be done carefully to avoid overextending
the organization’s resources.
Ramiﬁcation: Now is the time to ensure that the business has a sound
foundation from which to launch new initiatives. This foundation includes
strong business processes, application systems, and a data warehouse.
The data warehouse can be used to help monitor the impact of expansion
on the organization’s ability to deliver high-quality services to customers.
These scenarios simply highlight how the vision and culture of the organi-
zation can affect data warehouse efforts. There is an impact whether you are
starting from scratch or you already have a data warehouse in place.
What Are the Company’s Top Initiatives?
Every organization’s attention and resources are limited. These resources tend
to be allocated for the biggest crisis and for initiatives that will help the
company meet its strategic objectives. Therefore, it is important to identify
the focus of the company’s resources today. If the data warehouse project is
not directly supporting those things, then it will be put on the back burner.
This will affect the time available for the business to spend on the project,
as attention will be focused elsewhere. No matter how many IT people are
assigned, the project will either experience delays as other higher-priority
tasks take precedence or, worse, forge ahead without input from the business.
In either case, the data warehouse will fall short.
Sometimes a data warehouse is not part of an immediate solution to help
the company. If so, it may be best to set the data warehouse plans aside for the
now. When the organization is ready, then dust off the plans and start again.
Too often, IT organizations continue to forge ahead without a strong business
objective or purpose. The rest of the company’s energy is elsewhere. Usually
these initiatives fail. Data may be loaded, but it may fail to reﬂect what is
really needed, and is therefore never used to help the business. Don’t be afraid
to call a time-out. Stop spending money and wasting time. The project can be
restarted when the resources will be used to move the company forward.
Another way to help determine where the data warehouse ﬁts into the big
picture is to look at management or oversight studies that your organization
may have already done. These are usually conducted by high-level consulting

Chapter 3
■Understanding Where You Are and Finding Your Way
55
organizations, and their ﬁndings are well documented. Review the ﬁndings.
Ask yourself how, if at all, the data warehouse can support the organizations’
efforts to meet current challenges. Often it is clear how an existing or planned
data warehouse can directly support the company’s goals.
How Healthy Is Your Data?
Data is needed to help an organization achieve its strategic goals, but if the
data is not accurate, current, integrated, and accessible to business users, it
will inhibit the company’s ability to meet those goals. Therefore, an honest
assessment of the state of the data must be done.
Business and IT staff generally have a good sense of the overall state of the
data for your company, but certain aspects of the data can be overlooked. Is
there clean, reliable data within each individual application system, but the
data does not integrate easily, if at all? Perhaps your newest systems have
good data quality, but the older systems do not. Don’t conduct a detailed data
quality study at this time, but rather think about the data that is currently
available. Sometimes the data is sound, but it is only available to those who
know the secret handshakes that unlock it from storage. Some symptoms of
poor data health include the following:
Regularly ﬁnding duplicate data, within and across application systems.
For example, there are multiple places where customer data is stored, and
it is well known that there are multiple instances of some customers.
Pulling data together from more than one system is too difﬁcult for all
except the most data-savvy business analysts.
There are often miscommunications between report requests and getting
the actual data needed to make a decision.
There are often errors in the data that require restatements and corrections.
There are many concerns about the accuracy of the data.
Data is not requested because it takes too long to get in time to make a
decision.
Costs to access and maintain the data are escalating.
There is little documentation about what data means or how it is stored.
This is a concern because the last person who really knew the data just
retired.
The organizations with the biggest problems often expect a data warehouse
to perform miracles. Signiﬁcant data problems do not materialize over night.
Generally, it has taken years for the application systems to grow and evolve
into their current state. Many systems are well designed at ﬁrst, with sound

56
Part II
■The Business Side of Data Warehousing
database designs, but become disorganized over time, such as when the
application is modiﬁed to meet changing business needs. Systems professionals
don’t design systems or make changes to intentionally produce bad data.
Intense demands are placed on these systems to provide functionality that was
never part of the original design, and the changes must be done in a timely
manner. As this happens repeatedly, even the cleanest database design can be
degraded.
If there are long-standing problems with the company’s data, then it will take
a combined effort of IT and business professionals to correct these deﬁciencies.
This includes business decisions about how to handle the data, changes to
the production application systems, changing business processes, and adding
cleansing and transformation rules to the data warehouse ETL processes. The
data warehouse team may be at the center of it all. The bigger the problems,
the longer it typically takes to correct them. It will take time.
Does the Business Place Value on Analysis?
An organization’s readiness for a data warehouse reﬂects the value that
is placed on fact-based decision-making and reliance on the results from
business analysis. A data warehouse is a mechanism for the organization to
better leverage data and support more sophisticated analyses. How can you
tell if your organization is ready? Several characteristics indicate the value that
an organization places on analysis, including the following:
There are clearly deﬁned roles and/or jobs for business analysis.
There is a career path for business analysts, which ensures more senior
positions without going into management.
The people who perform business analysis are well respected throughout
the company.
If an organization does not place a lot of value on analysis, this can limit
the willingness of the business community to participate in the design and
development of a data warehouse. Without this partnership, organizations
often fail to realize beneﬁt from their data warehouse. Certain industries
have developed a strong appreciation for fact-based decision-making and the
value of analysis. The ﬁnancial solvency of the insurance industry is highly
dependent upon the accuracy of analyses performed by the actuarial groups.
This analysis helps the company to understand risks, determine the types of
risks to handle, and set competitive rates. Consumer packaged goods and retail
industries have been investing and developing strong analytics to improve
inventory management, identify customer purchase patterns, and develop
effective promotions.

Chapter 3
■Understanding Where You Are and Finding Your Way
57
Some organizations do not have a strong track record of using data and may
not have much experience performing sophisticated business analysis. This
does not mean these organizations should avoid building a data warehouse; it
just means that additional effort must be spent on developing analytical skills.
This also means that it will take longer for the data warehouse to evolve to
support the business because the business itself must evolve in its use of data
and the types of analyses that will be performed.
Reﬂecting on Your Data Warehouse History
In order to get a good understanding of the big picture, it is worth taking some
time to reﬂect on the experiences that your organization has had with a data
warehouse. In many cases, more than one data warehouse or data mart are
in place. Questions that you can ask about each data warehouse include the
following:
Is this an enterprise data warehouse or a collection of non-integrating
data marts?
Does IT consider the data warehouse to be a success? If not, why not?
Does the business community consider the data warehouse to be a
success? If not, why not?
Were business goals set for the data warehouse? Have these been met?
Who, from the business community, was involved in designing and
building the data warehouse? Was this active participation or periodic
status updates?
Does the business feel that this is their data warehouse, or did IT build it
with the hope that the business would ﬁnd it useful?
Is the data warehouse still being used today? If not, why not?
From an overall perspective, does the organization have a broad data
warehouse strategy in place today?
The objective is to get an overview of what has happened in the past. If
previous data warehouse projects have been successful, then the organization
will collectively be more positively inclined toward any new projects. If
all previous data warehouse attempts are considered failures, then you are
likely to run into resistance in getting another one started. It is critical to
understand the root causes of any failures so that new projects can develop
speciﬁc strategies to avoid past mistakes. The project team needs to effectively
communicate what is being done differently this time so that this effort will be
a success.
Digging into the details about individual project success or failure is explored
in the next section. At this point in time, it is important to simply get an

58
Part II
■The Business Side of Data Warehousing
appreciation for what the organization has experienced. This will give you
insight into people’s attitudes about data warehousing. Are people fed up and
think that a data warehouse will never work for your company? Perhaps the
company experienced some early success and everyone is clamoring for more.
If there are deep-seated problems with data, and business analysis is not
highly valued, then you are likely to face serious challenges building a data
warehouse. This does not mean that you should stop; it just means that you
need to address these fundamental issues at the same time and not expect
the data warehouse project itself to ﬁx problems that have been building
for decades. Speciﬁc activities must be planned to address these overarching
issues. The data warehouse can be a catalyst for changing how the organization
uses and values data.
Understanding Your Existing Reporting
Environment
Now that you have taken a step back to survey the big picture, it is time to
get your arms around how reporting is being done today. Many reports are
generated from some sort of reporting system, which may or may not be a
data warehouse. The objective here is three-fold:
Find the reporting environments.
Learn about the data that is available via that environment.
Identify the technology used by that environment.
Each of these steps is described in more detail in this section. One or two
people from IT or the business community can do this work. While some of the
information to be collected is technical, the people gathering the information
do not need to have deep technical skills. This should be done by someone
who is very organized and persistent, often a senior business analyst, a project
manager, or a senior systems analyst. The effort to dig deeper into the current
reporting environment can span the enterprise or may be focused in only one
area, such as sales or ﬁnance.
If the work is to collect information across the enterprise, then the people
doing this work must be authorized and empowered by enterprise man-
agement. This gives the team the authority to cross division or department
boundaries. The purpose is to get a basic understanding of the big reporting
systems or data warehouses across the enterprise. At the enterprise level, the
work described in this chapter can be completed in several weeks. This type
of effort will not be able to identify every set of personal spreadsheets that are
used for reporting, but should be able to touch on those environments that
produce the most critical reports for the organization.

Chapter 3
■Understanding Where You Are and Finding Your Way
59
When focused in a single area, the effort should still take only several weeks,
but may include more research into all types of reporting, such as individual
spreadsheets.
Finding the Reporting Systems
The ﬁrst step is to compile a list of all the different systems that are used
for reporting that exist across the organization. Some of these will be highly
visible and labeled as a data warehouse or data mart. Many other systems are
usually in place to support reporting and analysis. Some of these will look
like a data mart, even if not labeled as such. Other reporting systems may
not look anything like a data warehouse, but provide reports for the business.
The challenge now is to ﬁnd these other reporting systems. If you have a
well-established enterprise data warehouse strategy, these other systems may
want to stay hidden so that they are not expected to participate and/or comply
with the enterprise data warehouse. There needs to be a joint effort between the
business and IT to locate these systems. These can be found by the following
methods:
Searching for systems with names that include reporting, analysis, bench-
mark, scorecard, dashboard, executive information system, or decision
support.
Reviewing the IT budgets to locate maintenance and support for reporting
systems. The IT budgets may also include new projects that will soon fall
into a data warehouse-like category.
Reviewing the budgets of key business groups for which analysis is
usually performed. Systems may be developed, maintained, and sup-
ported completely outside of IT. Business groups build these to get their
work done. Groups that commonly have their own analytical systems
include actuary, market research, business planning, forecasting, brand
management, merchandising, and ﬁnancial reporting.
Asking the database administration group to provide a list of reporting
and analytical databases.
Looking for groups or projects that use sophisticated data access and
business intelligence tools. The purchasing department may be a good
resource to identify who is spending money on these tools. Some of the
tools to look for include Business Objects, Cognos, Microsoft Analysis
Services, Hyperion Essbase, and SAS. This is not a complete list, of course,
but points to the type of tool you are looking for.
In many cases, reports are created outside the realm of a formal system
developed and maintained by IT. These may be a collection of spreadsheets or

60
Part II
■The Business Side of Data Warehousing
reports in an MS Access database that are handled by someone in the business
group. Often, reports created this way are generated on a regular basis and
the business depends upon them. This qualiﬁes them to be included in this
inventory. This is not an exercise to compile a complete inventory of all reports
or spreadsheets, but rather to discover the core collection of reports. These are
often handled like a real ‘‘system,’’ just not under the care of IT. Additional
questions that can help locate these include the following:
Where do your standard reports come from?
Is there historical data stored within the business group, such as in
spreadsheets, SAS data sets, or MS Access?
Is there a research group that collects and maintains its own data?
Is there a process (often manual) that is used to produce the most useful
reports for this group?
In addition, is there someone who everyone depends upon to get data
and to produce reports? If so, then explore where and how this work gets
done. When a business analyst is doing this work, these informal reporting
environments are often already known. However, if a project manager or IT
analyst is doing this research, then this can be much harder. When the business
groups cooperate, this yields more accurate and complete information. This
partnership can be encouraged through business management.
If your goal is to understand reporting across the enterprise, then only the
largest and most critical reporting environments need to be included. It could
easily take months to try to track down every instance of this less formal type
of reporting for an enterprise. It would be appropriate to dig into this much
detail if you are studying a single part of the organization.
Compiling an Inventory
Now that you have a starter list of the systems of interest, the team can continue
their work by collecting more information about each of them. When asked to
do this type of survey, people usually jump directly to researching the tools
and technologies that are used. That level of detail will be helpful, but it is
important to get a basic understanding of each of these systems ﬁrst. Start with
the biggest and most well-known systems, possibly the data warehouse or a
data mart. Then progress to those systems with the broadest potential impact.
Leave for last any reporting systems that seem to be narrow in focus, such as
the reporting system used by facilities management to track the replacement
of light bulbs.
In order to collect this information, you need to ﬁnd the person(s) who
knows the most about each of these systems. If possible, identify both a
business and technical person for each system. The technical resource, is the

Chapter 3
■Understanding Where You Are and Finding Your Way
61
individual who is responsible for keeping the system running, who may report
directly into the business unit and not IT.
T I P
Don’t send out a questionnaire and expect to get responses. Schedule a
face-to-face meeting to gather the information. This provides you with an
opportunity to begin building a relationship with representatives from each of
these systems. Personal meetings also enable you to observe attitudes toward
data warehousing.
Several layers of detail will be helpful for learning about each system. Each
of the layers is described in the following sections. It may be necessary to
meet with several different people about a system before getting a complete
picture. You may need to speak with the project manager, business application
owner, lead IT developer, or the primary business user. The layers start with
the business purpose and then dig deeper into some of the mechanics of how
the system works.
T I P
As you begin ﬁnding and researching these reporting systems, make sure
that everyone knows that this is not a witch hunt. You are not planning to ﬁre the
three people responsible for the last project failure. The goal is to gain an honest
assessment of what assets the organization has in place. Some reﬂection about
how you got to the current point may be useful to catalog lessons learned, and
things not to repeat. The most value comes from understanding exactly where you
are. Then your effort can be applied to ﬁguring out where you want to be and
developing a plan that outlines how to get there. Without the reassurance that this
is not an exercise in laying blame, many individuals will be hesitant to speak
openly about what issues the organization is facing.
Identifying the Business Purpose
You ﬁrst need to get a basic understanding of what the system does. For
example, a reporting system may provide ﬁnancial reports to the manager of
each distribution center. This is the most important information you need to
understand because it forms the basis of your insight into the overall value
and impact that this system is having.
Aspects of reporting that can get the conversation going include the follow-
ing (be sure to determine who is able to answer these questions—a systems
group or a business group):
Describe the overall business purpose or function of this system.
What are the top ﬁve business questions that the system helps to answer?
Why was this system built?

62
Part II
■The Business Side of Data Warehousing
What was the business justiﬁcation for the project?
Who is the business sponsor for the system?
What business groups is this system intended to support, or who is the
target audience?
How many business users are using it? How frequently? To answer what
type of questions?
Who is the recipient of the results of these reports and/or analyses?
Is this part of the data warehouse initiative? If not, why not?
When was this system built?
What are the biggest known challenges or problems?
What are the biggest beneﬁts from this system? Who or which group
beneﬁts?
At what stage is this system in its overall life cycle: Design and develop-
ment? Initial deployment? In production for multiple years?
Are any return on investment (ROI) ﬁgures available? Do they indicate
cost savings or improved business results, such as increased proﬁt?
At the end of a session, always ask what else should be known about
this system or the group. For example, what are the expectations and/or
concerns about a data warehouse?
The objective of asking these questions is to get an understanding of how
these systems are helping the business. For some systems, you may ﬁnd many
of these questions to be difﬁcult or impossible to answer. Not getting answers
is just as important as getting a lot of detail. The lack of a business purpose or
focus is a common problem for many data warehouse-like systems.
When you receive positive feedback for a reporting system that is not a data
warehouse, this is good. Business needs are being met. There may not be a
need to build data warehouse at this time. However, you still need to look
beyond the immediate users of any reporting system to determine if there
are other areas that need access to this system and/or data. Frequently, the
existing reporting system is not meeting the needs of the business, which is
why there is interest in data warehousing.
If you are looking at a data warehouse and your answers reveal sound
business responses, congratulations! This indicates that the data warehouse
is supporting the business and adding value to the organization. This does
not mean that everyone should sit back and get comfortable, because there
is always more that can be done. Effort can be spent on improving and
gaining even more value, rather than on remediation work. Unfortunately,
for many data warehouses, these questions cannot be answered at all, or the
responses are phrased only in technical terms. This failure can indicate a

Chapter 3
■Understanding Where You Are and Finding Your Way
63
variety of problems. It could be that the appropriate people were not polled,
which may indicate communication problems. A lack of business-oriented
responses may also indicate that business results have not been captured and
tracked. With further exploration, the true value of the data warehouse may
be discovered. Don’t be shocked if no concrete value can be identiﬁed from
the data warehousing environment. Your organization is not alone. Many data
warehouses are less than successful, and some are a complete failure.
Discovering the Data You Already Have
Of course, another critical part of these systems is the data itself. You don’t
need a list of speciﬁc data elements, which is at too ﬁne-grained a level of
detail. More useful is an overview of the type of data that is stored and used in
this reporting environment. Questions to help you understand each reporting
environment include the following:
What type of data is included?
What level of detail is included? Individual transactions or summaries?
At what summary level?
How much history is provided?
How often is the data updated?
From which source systems is data pulled?
What is an estimated size of the data (terabytes or megabytes)?
What is the conﬁdence level in the data (high, medium, or low)?
Are there any plans to make signiﬁcant changes to the data?
Is a speciﬁc data warehouse architecture or methodology being used for
this system (e.g., Inmon or a Kimball approach)?
How is the data organized? Is it in ﬂat ﬁles? Is the data structured
dimensionally?
Document what you learn about the data. Table 3-1 shows an example of a
data summary. Complete what you can, but don’t take months to track these
details down. Simply capture what you can in one or two meetings. When this
is collected across all the different data warehouse-like systems, it is easier to
highlight areas of overlap and possible redundancy. This alone cannot be used
as justiﬁcation to eliminate one system versus another. There are often many
valid differences that require additional research and analysis to determine
what should or could be done. This is simply a mechanism to understand what
you already have in place.

* This is not a quantitative measurement of data quality, but rather the perception of the data: Does the business community feel the data is

Understanding the People
One of the most useful things to learn about any reporting environment is who
knows the most about it. This includes both IT and business professionals who
are involved in building, maintaining, and using the reporting environment.
You can determine which people should be contacted and interviewed by
asking relevant questions such as the following:
Who answers questions about this system? Who knows the most within
the business community? Who supports this from a technology perspec-
tive?
Who creates new reports or analyses?
Is anyone responsible for standard reports and analyses?
Who is responsible for data quality? (It may be helpful to ask instead:
Who do you go to if there is a problem with the data?)
Is there a team of people who are dedicated to supporting this environ-
ment or is this system only a small part of their job responsibilities? To
whom do they report?
How long has the support team been in place? Who is the most senior
member of that team? How long have they been on the team? How long
has this senior team member been with the company?
Are there any more experienced staff members who help the team? To
whom do they report and how often is their expertise used? Is it easy to
get their help or does it require the coordination of several managers?
Are there any enterprise data warehouse resources available to the team?
Have they been used? If not, why not?
Have any third-party organizations assisted the group with this system?
Explore who was involved with the original design and development, as
well as ongoing support.
These questions are geared to help understand the breadth and depth of the
people who are currently involved in supporting and using these reporting
systems. Such questions also explore how much each individual group knows
about what resources are available to them and whether they are aware of any
data warehousing activity.
Tracking Technology and Tools
While it is important to understand the business value of a data warehouse, you
also need a basic understanding of the underlying components that together
deliver that value. You need to know what you have in place, how well it is

66
Part II
■The Business Side of Data Warehousing
working, and what plans are already established to address or change these
components. This is much more technical, but it is still worthwhile to collect.
There are many different ways that reporting systems can be created. Even
for a data warehouse there are many components involved. You need to
understand what technology is being used to extract, prepare, publish, and
use the data. Chapter 9 provides more details about each of these components
when they are part of a data warehouse. For now, ask the following questions
to help identify the technology and tools currently being used:
What technologies or products are used?
Are these are the most current release of the product?
Is this component stable?
Does this component perform acceptably?
Is this component supportable?
Is this component sustainable for the future?
Are there any plans in place that will modify this technical environment?
Table 3-2 shows an example of how to track this technology inventory. By
documenting a summary of technical details, you can keep track of all the
different moving parts of the system. You may ask what technology each
system uses for the technical components listed in Table 3-2. More information
about what each of these different technologies and tools does is provided in
Chapter 9.
In addition to the Technology Inventory Matrix, it is helpful to document
the answers to the other questions. One group may be using the most current
release of a tool, which is meeting their needs. Another group may use an
earlier version of the same product but without the same level of satisfaction.
The Technology Inventory Matrix provides a handy cross-reference for ﬁnding
the appropriate detail for a single tool. You need to look at the details for each
group that is using that tool.
Understanding Enterprise Resources
As you did for each system, be sure to take a moment to understand what
is already in place at the enterprise level. This may include data, technology,
people, policies, and procedures. If these have not already been noted with
a speciﬁc system, then be sure to explore these resources now. There may
be a well-established enterprise data warehouse team, a documented data
warehouse architecture, a central library of all project documents to share best
practices, or you may not ﬁnd anything at an enterprise data warehouse level.

DOCUMENT WHAT YOU LEARN
Going through the exercise of ﬁnding and learning about the many reporting
environments across the enterprise is challenging and enlightening; but in
order to leverage what is learned, the ﬁndings must be documented! Taking
notes is not enough. Can others ﬁnd your notes? Can anyone else read your
writing? Taking the time to document what you learn ensures that the details
are available even when you are not. Large, complex organizations have too
many systems to keep track of unless you carefully document each one.
This should not be an effort that takes months—spending an hour or two to
summarize the ﬁndings of each system is invaluable. Organize the ﬁndings and
publish them for the beneﬁt of the entire organization. You should plan to
document the following:
■A brief summary of each reporting environment, which includes a short
abstract of the system’s purpose and contact information if someone
wants to learn more. This can include the technical ﬁndings too.
(continued)

68
Part II
■The Business Side of Data Warehousing
DOCUMENT WHAT YOU LEARN (continued)
■Data Summary Matrix
■Technology Inventory Matrix
This can form the basis of an enterprise data warehouse web site that
provides information about all data warehousing activity across the company.
Clearly indicate that the information collected at this time reﬂects the current
state. Later, additional information can be added to this site to share the
direction and strategy of the organization’s future data warehouse efforts.
Netting It All Out
Think about what has been learned. Were you surprised by anything? Are
things better or worse that you expected? Too often we spend all our time
performing tasks. While things must get done, it is also helpful to sit quietly and
think about what has been observed. After taking some time for reﬂection, it is
helpful to bring together everything that was collected through the inventory.
If you did not document what you learned about each reporting envi-
ronment, then take the time to do so now. Once each separate system has
been documented, look for common themes across these systems. Are there
common areas of concern? Is the same or similar data ﬂowing into multiple
systems? Are multiple tools in place that perform the same function?
The answers to these questions will highlight what is in place and working,
and what problem areas need to be looked at more closely. This also highlights
any activity that is currently outside of any formal data warehousing initiatives.
These outliers would not exist in a perfect world, but reality reveals that not
every report or analysis will be supported via a data warehouse. The challenge
is determining which things make business sense, and should therefore be
supported by the data warehouse, and which things to leave alone.
It is impossible to list all possible ﬁndings here and make recommendations.
Business and IT managers should review these ﬁndings together; and with
the help of the team who compiled the ﬁndings, the group must determine
what should happen next. This requires an understanding of what you already
have compared to the organization’s strategic direction. Combining this with a
basic understanding of data warehousing, the group can assess what needs to
be done next. To show how this may play out, several scenarios are provided
here, with the recommendation for what to do next:
The organization has a data warehouse in place, but it is stalled. It is not
helping the business today. There is a great deal of interest to leverage
the investment that has already been made.

Chapter 3
■Understanding Where You Are and Finding Your Way
69
Recommendation: A short project can be undertaken to study what needs to
be done to improve the data warehouse’s ability to support the business.
Chapter 12 discusses several ideas to help jump-start a stalled data
warehouse. This will likely spawn one or more additional projects to
address the speciﬁc recommendations of the study.
The organization has a well-deﬁned data warehouse strategy with a core
set of data already loaded into the data warehouse. It supports several
key business groups but additional analyses are needed, which require
additional data.
Recommendation: Deﬁne a project to expand the data warehouse by loading
this additional data. This project should also design and deliver the reports
and analyses needed to continue to support the business. Keep up the
good work!
There are multiple non-integrating data marts. Each was built a number
of years ago and has provided value, but there are new requirements for
which the data must be used together.
Recommendation: Assess the effort that would be involved to merge the
appropriate data marts. Depending upon how each is designed, this may
be an opportunity to create a new solution or it may be better to enhance
one of the marts to accommodate the other data. This will likely result in
a project for the new design or expansion.
One of the most relied upon reporting systems is not able to keep up with
the demand for new reports and analyses. There have been rumblings for
years about how much it costs to maintain this system. It is no longer cost
effective to continue to run this system as is.
Recommendation: If there is business need to continue using the data that
currently lives in the old reporting system, then this is a good candidate to
be loaded into a data warehouse. A new project can be deﬁned to design
and build the solution. This must focus on what the business wants to
do with that data, rather than simply replace each existing report. Where
possible, additional functionality should be delivered to the business that
will increase the value of using this data once it is in the data warehouse.
The organization has dozens of reporting systems and several separate
data warehouses already. There doesn’t appear to be any cohesive strategy
to tackle reporting and analysis.
Recommendation: Initiate a project to develop a data warehouse strategy
and deﬁne what is needed to realize that strategy. Chapter 9 provides a
description of data warehouse architectures and what needs to be put in
place.

70
Part II
■The Business Side of Data Warehousing
While reviewing the overall direction of the organization, it becomes clear
that its biggest need is the ability to get a complete view of customers
and what products and services they buy. This data is currently in many
different reporting systems. There is no data warehouse in place today.
Recommendation: Because this is a big priority for the organization, a
project should be started to design and build a data warehouse to provide
this critical customer data.
There is no single answer for how to move forward. Experience shows that
once you know both what you have and where you want to be, there are
usually clear steps for moving in that direction.
Introducing the Case Studies
There are two different types of case studies included throughout the book.
The ﬁrst type provides examples of the concepts presented in the chapters.
The second type of case study allows us to follow the progress of two different
companies on their data warehouse project. Each serves a different purpose,
but they are intended to clarify and reinforce the main concepts covered in
each chapter.
The Call Center Data Warehouse Project
Sample ﬁndings and project deliverables are included for a data warehouse
project for a call center. Many organizations run their own call center operations
or outsource them. This is a critical operation because it is typically how
external parties interact with the company. Both the public’s impression of
a company and customer satisfaction can be greatly affected by a good or
bad experience when calling that company. Because this transcends a single
industry, the call center example highlights the universal principles of the book.
In Real Life
To highlight how the concepts presented in each chapter play out in real
life, the experience of two organizations will be shared. These are not actual
companies, but rather a compilation of many different organizations. The two
organizations that will be tracked represent opposite ends of the spectrum in
terms of size and culture.

Chapter 3
■Understanding Where You Are and Finding Your Way
71
Giant Company
The ﬁrst organization, which we will call Giant Company, is an extremely
large conglomerate. There are thousands of employees in IT alone; and there
are multiple divisions, each run as a separate company. Because of the large
number of people employed, there are many layers of management and
well-structured positions and career paths. As the company grew, many
policies and procedures were put in place to assist in the overall management
of such a large concern. As employees are brought on board, there is a
pre-deﬁned training plan based upon the position. This helps everyone get up
to speed as fast as possible.
Within each of the divisions, the business is organized into departments
with specialized functions. Each department knows what its inputs are, how
to get its business processes done, and to whom results should be sent. Much
of the business process and decision-making for the daily work has been
built into the production application systems. This has enabled the business
to expand and ensures consistency. However, knowledge about the rationale
and details of the processes has been lost over time. Everyone knows how to
keep the systems working, but how they work and why is a mystery.
The IT function is centralized, but it is structured to support each of
the divisions. To keep it manageable, a clear project methodology is used.
This provides consistency from project to project and helps individuals to
understand how to get things done. With so much structure, it is relatively
easy to get everyone to participate in enterprise initiatives. Everyone is used
to having to comply with corporate standards for everything—from naming
a data element to requesting a new laptop. Following corporate policies
is rewarded, whereas questioning the status quo or trying to circumvent
well-established procedures is highly frowned upon.
Within each division there have been attempts at building a data warehouse,
with a range of results. Some have mature and valuable data marts in place.
Others have been struggling to deliver anything. There have also been several
attempts to build an enterprise data warehouse. The goal each time was
to consolidate all data from across the enterprise and then serve it up to
individual groups as needed. Most of the efforts to date have been more
focused on infrastructure and moving data into a large database. There has
not yet been any true delivery of this data into the business community.
With such a variety of data warehouse experiences, it is especially critical
to compile an inventory of what has been done. There is a need to learn
more about industry best practices and how these apply within Giant Com-
pany. Understanding what hasn’t worked for this organization will help other

72
Part II
■The Business Side of Data Warehousing
initiatives to avoid making the same mistakes. With so many layers of man-
agement and narrowly deﬁned jobs, it will be challenging to get the right
people together to help ensure a successful data warehouse. All employees,
businesses, and systems must learn to be more ﬂexible and collaborate. Each
person involved with the data warehouse must feel that he or she can challenge
the status quo in order to make the solution more useful and valuable.
Agile, Inc.
The second business, called Agile, Inc., is a small entrepreneurial company. It
has been in business for several decades, so it has well-established application
systems to support it. The company is not highly structured and each group is
encouraged to be creative and get things done. This empowerment is welcome
and can be a powerful tool for the data warehouse efforts, but there are also
risks associated with this environment.
For example, people are not used to coordinating across groups. It is more of
an ‘‘every man for himself’’ environment. Commonly, if someone else it taking
too long, an employee will not wait but simply forge ahead and develop his or
her own solution. This has resulted in a proliferation of many point solutions
that address single business issues. Data is repeated all over the place. The
result of compiling an inventory of all these different systems indicates just
how bad the problem is. There is a strong need to get a single integrated view
of the entire business. Due to market pressures, the organization must leverage
technology to get more productivity from the existing staff.
It is necessary to harness all this individual energy to coordinate a common
solution that beneﬁts everyone. This requires collaboration and compromise,
and it will take some time to get a foundation in place. Patience is difﬁcult.
The senior executives believe that building an enterprise data warehouse
environment will help the business in the long run. They also understand that
this commitment to a strategic solution requires dedication and persistence.
Each chapter will conclude with observations about how these two organi-
zations are dealing with the challenges presented.
Summary
Before jumping into any new data warehouse projects, or even if you are in
the middle of one, it is helpful to step back and look at the big picture of
the organization. Taking some time to consider the strategic direction of the
business can help deﬁne where data warehouse efforts can be best leveraged.
It is also important to have a realistic understanding of the different reporting
systems that are currently being used.

Chapter 3

73
This chapter provided suggestions for how to compile this background
information and explained how this foundation can guide what should be
done next as you get ready to start a new data warehouse design and
development project.
Sometimes the next steps should be focused on leveraging what has already
been built. The book follows the path of starting a new data warehouse project,
and the next chapter begins by exploring the partnership between business
and IT groups, including a deﬁnition of the roles and responsibilities of data
warehouse project participants.

Successful IT–Business
Partnerships
Cumulative experience over the past twenty plus years of implementing data
warehouses, as well as talking to hundreds of corporations and consulting
organizations about key factors that drove successful data warehouse imple-
mentations, have consistently shown that one of the most important factors
for a successful data warehouse is a strong partnership between the business
and systems communities. Other texts and articles typically focus on what
IT must do to improve that partnership. This chapter focuses on what the
business community can do to build and maintain a strong relationship with
IT. Chapter highlights include the following:
What a partnership really means
Roles and responsibilities for both IT and the business
Working with external consultant organizations
Ideas to improve communication
Tips for developing strong project teams
Review of ongoing responsibilities
What a Partnership Really Means
Wikipedia offers the following deﬁnition of partnership:
A partnership is a type of business entity in which partners (owners) share
with each other the proﬁts or losses of the business undertaking in which all have
invested.
This deﬁnition relates well to the type of partnership that is necessary
to build and sustain a successful data warehouse. Both the business and IT
community must take ownership of the data warehouse and be able to share
75

76
Part II
■The Business Side of Data Warehousing
equally in the success or failure of the process. The strength of any partnership
develops over time, as you work together toward a common goal.
Partnerships are strong when each individual in the relationship invests
equally. Everyone must pull his or her own weight. The strongest partnerships
are developed when teams or individuals are dependent on each other in order
to be successful. This is clear when looking at a sports team. While success
may result from the performance of one superstar, a team is more likely to
achieve success when it contains multiple strong contributors. In the 1980s,
Michael Jordan alone was not enough to ensure success for the Chicago Bulls.
However, in the 1990s when he was surrounded by other strong partners, the
Bulls were unstoppable.
How a partnership works for a data warehouse may not be as clear as the
relationship between players on a sports team. For any partnership to succeed,
all partners must have a clear understanding of what is expected of them, take
ownership of those expectations, and follow through by fulﬁlling their own
responsibilities.
Organizations that are committed to building a strong partnership between
the business and IT communities typically fall somewhere on a continuum.
At the low end of the continuum, organizations designate people for both
groups and encourage them to learn, understand, and partner with each
other. At the midrange of the continuum, organizations create performance
goals and incentives based on the ability of the groups to build strong
partnerships. Finally, on the high end of the continuum, organizations build
competency centers or centers of excellence where both the business and IT
partners are reassigned into this new organization with integrated goals and
a single management team. No matter where your organization falls on the
continuum, all parties must to be committed to building a true partnership.
If this commitment does not exist, then your chances of a successful project
decrease dramatically.
Many organizations have well-developed, strong relationships between
business and systems. In order to capitalize on that experience, let’s take a
look at how you will contribute to the partnership through your role.
What the Business Partners Should Expect to Do
Before delving into speciﬁc roles and responsibilities, it is worthwhile to take a
step back to reﬂect on how the various parts of the business are often perceived.
Business professionals can be intimidating to systems people. Salespeople are
outgoing and gregarious. Marketing people are creative and trendy. Folks
from ﬁnance are detail oriented and demand that everything balance to the
penny. Engineers are methodical. Actuaries are incredibly intelligent and
detail-aware.

Chapter 4
■Successful IT–Business Partnerships
77
The higher up the management chain, the more intimidating. Ultimately,
senior executives can be very intimidating. Executives absorb information
quickly and form opinions quickly too. They have the ability to immediately
hone in on any areas where there is uncertainty and doubt. Good executives
also have the ability to listen with an open mind, and are willing to modify
their strategy based upon new information. Therefore, if you are a member of
the business community, be mindful of how you might be perceived and act
as a partner. If you are a member of the IT community, remember these are
your partners and act accordingly.
Why take the time to reﬂect on this? Too often we fall into behavior patterns
of dealing with our peers or others within our own area of the business. As we
interact with those outside of our realm, we each need to take our audience
into consideration. This includes limiting the use of acronyms and jargon in
our discussions. Systems people are often criticized for excessive use of jargon.
Business people are just as guilty. This can be as simple as using industry
terminology such as market share, margin calls, or loss ratios. It may be
using abbreviations for projects and initiatives that are underway within your
organization. If these initiatives do not involve major systems development,
the technical staff may not know anything about them. Both business and IT
have to understand the success factors of the project and develop a common
level of understanding to achieve them.
Yes, that does mean the systems staff should learn the business basics,
including terminology and fundamental functions or processes. If the technical
project team members are struggling with understanding the business, you,
their business partner, can help! Recommend internal education classes for
them to attend. Often, introductory seminars are offered to new business
employees. Sometimes these are offered as online self-paced studies. Arrange
for the technical team members to participate. Compile a list of good books
that lay out the principles of your industry. Consider the textbooks that you
used in college if the information is still current. Encourage the systems staff to
purchase these books or loan them out if your department already has them.
Recommend periodicals that are targeted to each functional area, and don’t
overlook online sources of information such as articles and blogs.
It is hoped that the systems people you are working with will be open to your
recommendations. The goal is not to turn the technical staff into full-ﬂedged
brand managers, brokers, or accountants, but to give them a good background
about what you do. This process will go a long way in establishing a common
understanding between you and the IT partners as you seek to solve the
business problem.
There are several different partnership roles that need to be ﬁlled by
representatives from the business community. While each has a different level
of responsibility and time commitment, each is important to the overall success

78
Part II
■The Business Side of Data Warehousing
of the project. The following sections describe the partnership roles that each
level within the business community is responsible for ﬁlling.
Business Executives and Senior Management
Every data warehouse project needs to have executive-level buy-in and sup-
port. At least one person should serve as the executive business sponsor. This
does not mean that all other executives and senior managers do not have to
play a role. The entire senior staff should have a basic understanding of data
warehousing principles, as presented in Chapter 1. These executives need to
grasp the organization’s strategic vision for data warehousing, and some of
them will play key roles in shaping that strategic vision and presenting it to the
senior staff in a clear, concise manner. Development of this vision is primarily
a systems function and is discussed in Chapter 9.
Implementing a successful data warehouse strategy does not happen with
one monolithic project but rather through a series of individual projects. There
must be executive support for both each of these projects and the overall vision.
Once the ﬁrst data warehouse project is complete, it is important for senior
management to have continued involvement in order to ensure long-term
success. This includes encouraging their staff to use the data warehouse for
business analysis, and using reports or a dashboard themselves. As part of
supporting the overall data warehouse strategy, senior staff members need
to set long-term priorities and strategic direction for the data warehouse
environment.
The Executive Business Sponsor
This is one of the most critical roles for ensuring a successful data warehouse
project. Without executive support, many projects chew up a lot of time and
money but never deliver anything of value to the company. The executive
business sponsor must be someone who sees the value in managing data
as a corporate asset and wants this opportunity to guide the process. An
effective partnership between business and IT must start with the executive
business sponsor. You cannot simply assign a title to someone and consider
the role to be ﬁlled. The most effective executive business sponsors take time
to learn about data warehousing and understand the value it can have to the
organization.
For example, it might mean taking the time to understand how the data
warehouse can be used to streamline vendor contract negotiations using
historical performance and projected demand. Taking this further, it might
entail understanding how the data warehouse can help track the timeliness
and quality of vendor deliveries. An effective executive business sponsor truly
believes in the data warehouse and has a vision for how it can be used to help
the organization.

Unfortunately, the executive business sponsor role is often viewed only as
the person who can authorize project funding. The sponsor’s responsibilities
stretch far beyond funding a project; they continue throughout the entire life of
the project. One of the sponsor’s major contributions to the project is political
clout. If the project is important to senior staff, then others will take notice.
This support needs to be highly visible. The sponsor should set the stage
and share his or her expectations and commitment to the project at the project
kick-off meeting. It is important to have critical project communications sent
through the ofﬁce of this person, and have the help of his or her administrative
assistant to schedule meetings and set up design reviews. It never ceases to
amaze me how a project team can struggle to get on someone’s calendar for
weeks, but when the request comes from the executive sponsor’s ofﬁce, a
meeting can be arranged this week!
The project team members all work hard to keep the project moving forward
in a timely manner, and often this happens without direct intervention from
the sponsor. This level of interaction between the individual team members
and the sponsor is often minimal. Most of the interaction is through the
business champion, whose role is described later in this chapter. The partnership
is developed through efﬁcient communication and regular brieﬁngs. When
things are running smoothly, regular brieﬁngs are all that is required to keep
the sponsor informed. When problems arise, the team must be able to rely
on the sponsor’s help. The most common tasks requiring help from the
executive business sponsor include the following:
Gaining the cooperation of others within the business community
Ensuring that the data warehouse project priority is set high enough that
business team members are not assigned to other projects and have no
time left for this project
Preventing the team from losing project focus
Running interference in the corporate culture to keep the team from
getting bogged down in organizational politics
Garnering appropriate business resources and ensuring that they devote
the needed attention to the project
If the executive business sponsor stays informed, these issues will not
be a surprise. As members of senior staff, executive business sponsors are
well informed of the organization’s current priorities, which enables them
to help ﬁght for the data warehouse. If something else has taken a higher
priority, then the sponsor can explain this to the project team and assist in
adjusting expectations across the organization. The sponsor can also assist
in the development of a new schedule for the project if necessary.
Other staff members should be cultivated to share the executive business
sponsor responsibilities. Identify individuals in the organization who are

interested or have the skills to take over sponsorship in the future. If you
are the business sponsor, begin to groom your own replacement. That way,
you can move onward and upward when the opportunity arises without
jeopardizing all you have worked for.
EXECUTIVE BUSINESS SPONSOR JOB DESCRIPTION
The executive business sponsor will:
■Serve as the primary contact for other senior staff members to understand
data warehousing and its strategic value to the organization
■Understand how the data warehouse will support business
decision-making
■Review summarized project deliverables
■Assist with the resolution of major issues
■Ensure that the appropriate business staff members are allocated to the
project
■Remove major roadblocks on behalf of the project team
■Have a broad perspective of functions and groups across the enterprise
■Be authorized to make decisions that resolve issues and set direction
The executive business sponsor is not be expected to attend weekly project
status meetings or review detailed project plans.
Desired characteristics of the executive business sponsor:
■Be well respected in the organization
■Be a creative problem solver
■Have a track record of success
■Be well-connected politically
■Work in the business area that the data warehouse will support
■Be a visionary
N O T E
It is common for senior managers to ask external consultants for their
opinion about how a project is progressing or how the organization is doing with
data warehousing. Business executives routinely ask external consultants, ‘‘Is
there anything else you need? Are my people doing what they are supposed to be
doing?’’ While it is interesting to get an independent perspective, why not do the
same with internal staff? Walk through the area where the project team sits to see
what is going on. Just have casual conversations about what is on their mind—ask
them what else they need to keep the project moving.

Chapter 4
■Successful IT–Business Partnerships
81
Business Managers
Managers responsible for the business groups who will be using the data
warehouse also have a role to play in the project. Business managers need to
have a clear understanding of the data-driven business requirement that their
group is facing. These managers need to get involved at the beginning and stay
involved throughout. This involvement is typically not very time consuming,
but it does require learning about the project and staying informed. Managers
need to know what a data warehouse is, be familiar with the overall vision for
the data warehouse, and understand what the goals are for individual data
warehouse projects.
Some of the staff members are likely to have larger roles in the project. At
a minimum, this group will be the recipient of the results of the project. The
business manager’s staff will provide broad requirements, and help deﬁne
detailed formulas and rules for handling business data. This means that the
business manager needs to know what data will be available and what analyses
will be supported. One would expect to have this level of understanding of
any other departmental project on which people are working.
While senior staff sets the strategic direction and helps to get a data
warehouse project launched, the middle managers play a critical role in
keeping things moving. These are the people who allocate resources for all
of the work that needs to get done. The staff members who are representing
the business community on the project cannot be overloaded with other
responsibilities. Check with the staff to see if they feel that they have sufﬁcient
time to devote to the data warehouse project. Review all of the things that they
have been asked to do, as many small requests can add up to more work than
any single person can complete.
In addition, take the time to ask the project manager or IT managers if
the partners assigned are doing what is expected for the data warehouse.
What else could the group do to help the project? Others may be hesitant
to ‘‘get someone in trouble’’ by expressing concerns about their availability
or participation on a project. By proactively asking, you are likely to get
honest feedback. Rarely is there intentional dereliction of duty, but simply too
much work, too little time, and no clear understanding of how things should
be prioritized. Consider strengthening the partnership focus by making the
goals of the project part of the individual’s performance goals. This level of
interest and focus reinforces the messages from senior management about the
importance of the data warehouse.
N O T E Lack of support from middle managers can reduce the effectiveness of
IT-business partnerships. Senior management may support the data warehouse,
and individual analysts often see the beneﬁt, but time is not allocated by their
middle managers to work on the project. This gap in middle-management support
can cause all other partnership efforts to break down.

■The Business Side of Data Warehousing
The Business Champion
Similar to the role of the executive business sponsor, there should be one
representative from the business community to serve as the business cham-
pion for each individual project. This person will spearhead and maintain
business involvement on the project and work as an active partner with the IT
organization. The business champion is typically a senior member of the group
and may also have management responsibilities. The data warehouse project
must be one of the primary responsibilities of the business champion. While
there must be one person designated as the primary business champion, other
people in the business community can help with this work too. However, if
multiple people are assigned the responsibility, it is too easy to just assume
that someone else is taking care of things.
The business champion should have direct and frequent access to the exec-
utive business sponsor, either as part of his or her current job responsibilities
or having this avenue opened up for the champion role. The champion usu-
ally participates in, or could be one of the primary drivers for, getting the
project started. This includes setting up the project charter and project scope (as
described in Chapter 5). The champion has the responsibility to make decisions
about project details on behalf of the business community, but is not expected
to be responsible for performing detailed project tasks or producing project
deliverables. The champion works closely with the project manager and other
business and systems resources to keep the project on track. He or she must be
one of the data warehouse’s primary advocates, and is responsible for giving
regular brieﬁngs to a variety of audiences across the business community.
BUSINESS CHAMPION JOB DESCRIPTION
The business champion will:
■Advocate for business process changes
■Understand the overall project life cycle
■Monitor project progress
■Help resolve issues
■Communicate and market the purpose and beneﬁts of the project
■Cultivate relationships across business groups
■Understand the project’s purpose and the team roles
■Work to develop the business justiﬁcation and impact of the data
warehouse

Desired characteristics of the business champion:
■Well respected in the business community
■Strong project management exposure
■Motivated and resourceful
■Excellent communication and presentation skills
■Knowledge of the business functions and processes
■Ability to learn complex technical concepts quickly and apply them to busi-
ness situations
Business Analysts
Business analysts are typically those who perform most reporting and analysis
for the group. These people understand the intricacies and challenges of the
current data. Many times, the business analyst function has been boiled down
to data gathering and report generating. The length of time required to collect,
validate, and format the data leaves little time to perform other analysis. Too
often, highly skilled professionals are not able to leverage their true talents to
perform more extensive analysis that would enable them to better understand
what is causing changes to the business and make business decisions to take
corrective action.
Without a well-designed data warehouse, it can take a long time to pull
together basic reports to track business performance measures showing longi-
tudinal trends in sales or proﬁt margins. Developing these reports at a regional
level may consume all of the time available to meet the deadline. This would
not allow time to pull data to look at sales by individual markets or stores.
To take this further, it would be interesting to be able to see other geographic
breakdowns or perhaps by-product characteristics. More in-depth analysis
would be required to study the impact that changes to the company’s pricing
or promotion strategies have had on sales. The data warehouse project needs
the type of person who is interested in looking at these deeper levels of analysis
and is not satisﬁed with producing basic reports.
The data warehouse project team needs at least one business analyst to work
as a full participant on the project. This person must be knowledgeable about
the business and the data used to support the business. He or she will be an
advocate for the group. While the project needs one person to be assigned,
several may be allocated, especially if each represents a different group.

84
Part II
■The Business Side of Data Warehousing
Over time, some business analyst roles have evolved to be full-time data
gatherers and report creators. When this happens, these business analysts are
often one step removed from the business itself and are not involved in any
decision making. This can be conﬁrmed by looking closely at their skill sets
and daily tasks. This type of business analyst often has strong technical skills
and may actually perform work that is much more like an IT application
developer than a business analyst.
The project risk is that too often the business participation roles for a data
warehouse project are assigned to these people. Their insight is invaluable for
ﬁnding data, assessing data quality, and deﬁning calculations, but their views
are limited to what they are currently asked to do. Over time, the business
community learns what types of requests can be fulﬁlled by tomorrow morning
and what cannot be done in time to support a key decision. As this experience
builds up, more complex questions are no longer asked, leaving only what can
actually be done as the entire set of what the business analysts are asked to do.
In addition, these types of business analysts are not privy to what is done with
their results—they deliver them to the right person and their responsibilities
are complete.
N O T E
Do not abdicate true business participation to data gatherers.
Limiting IT’s access to the business community to these business analysts
limits the breadth of requirements that are gathered. Duplicating what is done
today will limit the value that is realized from the data warehouse.
BUSINESS ANALYST JOB DESCRIPTION
The business analyst will:
■Use the data warehouse for daily work
■Translate business strategies and objectives into analyses to support those
objectives
■Research the business meaning and use of data elements
■Represent business preferences and priorities and balance that with techni-
cal realities
■Understand basic principles of the industry and how business performance
is measured and monitored
■Identify business process changes that will harness the data warehouse’s
capabilities
■Be a business subject matter expert

he or she doesn’t need to be able to answer everything, but knows who can)
■Understand consequences of technical decisions on the business,
or be willing to ask for clariﬁcation to gain an understanding
■Assist with documenting and gaining approval for the calculations used for

■Identify business-related issues that arise on the project and drive these to
resolution
■Assist with gathering and validation of requirements

Desired characteristics:
■Strong analytical and reasoning skills
■Good understanding of technology, but does not need to be a programmer
■Good communication skills
■Able to educate others
■IT: About the business and uses of the data
■Business: About data warehousing, how the data looks, and what appli-

■Detailed and patient
■Enthusiastic
■Interested in ﬁguring out better ways to get things done
Helping the Business Analyst Deal with Change
It’s necessary to help the business analysts adapt to the new data warehouse
environment. Initially, there may be a fear that their jobs may be eliminated
when everyone begins to pull their own data. However, that rarely happens.
More often, the scope and responsibilities of these more technical business
analysts change. Rather than being data gatherers, the business analyst can
truly perform analyses. When high-quality data is easily available, there is time
to pursue the next layers of questions. Rather than stop with basic information
about the business, there is now time to dig in and understand what is causing

86
Part II
■The Business Side of Data Warehousing
ﬂuctuations in the business. Many business analysts are thrilled to have their
time freed up to pursue these more sophisticated analyses, although this is not
always the case.
Over the years, the people hired to ﬁll the business analyst role may not
actually have the business and analytical skills needed to move into this new
role. They may feel that the data warehouse will expose this lack of skill.
Sometimes, it has simply been too long since those skills were used, and they
have become rusty or forgotten. The fears and concerns of these people need
to be addressed. Perhaps some people will switch to the business intelligence
developer role described later in this chapter. Others may need a refresher
course in business analysis.
If business analysts feel threatened by the data warehouse, they may
become a signiﬁcant roadblock. This risk can be mitigated by keeping your
eyes open to any resistance and by reassuring these staff members that their
contributions now and into the future are valued. While their input is critical to
understanding how reporting and analysis is done today, these people cannot
take the place of true business decision makers on the project.
Business User Audience
The target audience for a data warehouse project should be deﬁned up front.
One or more speciﬁc business groups or functions should be targeted as the
data warehouse audience for each project. This group is also called the users.
This does not mean that every targeted user will be expected to create new
analyses or create reports from scratch, but that the results from an analysis
will be provided to support their business function. For example, a market
research analyst may use the data warehouse as the source for data to feed a
complex statistical analysis. That same data warehouse can be used to create
a basic performance report that is automatically generated and distributed to
every sales associate at each retail store. These automated reports can provide
sales results with a comparison to sales targets. If a sales associate in a retail
store sees that she needs to only sell one more business blazer to reach the
platinum bonus level, you can easily predict where her efforts will be spent
today. Both of these groups are users of the data warehouse, yet in vastly
different ways.
A cross section of business personnel will be interviewed during the require-
ments gathering process. These people will need to participate in the interview,
review subsequent requirements documentation, and may also participate in
reviews of the data warehouse data model.
Project Manager
Historically, project management for a data warehouse was a systems function.
Project managers reported up through the systems department and were often

Chapter 4
■Successful IT–Business Partnerships
87
recruited from the ranks of designers and developers. This may still be the
case in your organization. However, project management has emerged as a
separate profession in its own right and now there is specialized training
and professional certiﬁcation available for project managers. These techniques
are being applied for all work across many organizations, not just systems
development projects. These professionals are typically part of a department
or ofﬁce that focuses on project management. The project management role is
included here because the project manager may be from a project ofﬁce and
not from systems.
The project manager must be the central hub for the project. This is who
makes sure that everything is where it should be, and helps others ﬁnd what
they are looking for. One of the most important responsibilities is ensuring
effective communication. This does not mean that the project manager is the
only team member who can speak, but it does mean that the project manager
makes sure that the right audiences get their information at the appropriate
level of detail in a timely manner. In fact, it is critical that the project manager
not become a bottleneck for communication. The project manager is responsible
for making sure that everyone is on the same page.
PROJECT MANAGER JOB DESCRIPTION
The project manger will:
■Develop and maintain full-scale project plans
■Direct and manage project development from beginning to end
■Develop and execute an ongoing communication plan
■Identify and manage project dependencies and critical path items
■Administer change control
■Track progress toward project milestones
■Track issues and progress toward resolution
■Monitor and report project status
■Coordinate resources from cross-functional groups
■Ensure that all project deliverables are completed

■Excellent interpersonal skills
■Strong analytical and reasoning skills
■Strong organizational skills
■Very detailed and rigorous about follow-through

N O T E
The project team members from the business community must be em-
powered to make decisions. There are many small things that come up throughout
a DW project. The business people assigned to the project should have the autho-
rity to talk to anyone they need to across the organization. If a request is made for
a signiﬁcant block of time, this clearly needs to be done with the cooperation of
their management. E-mail is indispensable, but it can take more of everyone’s time
to e-mail back and forth discussing what you need than if you simply walked over
and asked the question. Common sense must prevail. If someone does not have
the time to spend, they will tell you. Usually, even the busiest people carve out a
little time to help out.
Now that the roles and responsibilities of the business community have
been presented, it is time to turn our attention to the project team members
from IT.
What You Should Expect from IT
The input of the business community is invaluable to a project team. Likewise, a
data warehouse cannot be built without the talent, technical expertise, and rigor
that the systems staff offers. The data warehousing industry has developed
technologies and methods to design and implement robust environments that
support businesses today and into the future. You must trust the technical
team members to construct components to ﬁt together to provide you with an
environment that will support your business requirements. Let the systems
staff do what they do best: make technical design decisions and build the
capabilities. You really should not care which hash algorithm is used to load
large tables into a database as long as you can get the data you need in a timely
manner. There are many different roles on a data warehouse project that are
ﬁlled by systems professionals. Many roles are consistent regardless of what
kind of system is being developed. The IT roles for a data warehouse project
are described in the following sections. There are many other venues and

Chapter 4
■Successful IT–Business Partnerships
89
publications that describe these roles in great detail, and are not duplicated in
this book.
CIO/IT Executive Sponsor
The data warehouse should have one executive sponsor from the IT organi-
zation that will partner closely with the executive business sponsor. This is
typically the CIO, but in large organizations this could be a senior manager
in the IT organization. This person should be ultimately responsible for the
technology side of the data warehouse and should have management respon-
sibility over the IT staff on the data warehouse. This person usually shares
the funding responsibility with the executive business sponsor and will own
control for the technical aspects of the data warehouse environment. It is very
important that the executive sponsors from the two organizations are seen as
equals and that they are on the same page in terms of goals and objectives for
the data warehouse.
Data Warehouse Manager
The data warehouse manager’s role represents the driving force behind the
data warehouse environment from the IT organization. This individual is often
given direct responsibility for the funds for the data warehouse project. This is
the primary visionary for data warehousing in the organization, and the lead
systems professional who is responsible for building and sustaining the data
warehouse. The data warehouse manager continues to have responsibility
for the data warehouse after a project is complete and oversees support,
maintenance, and growth.
The data warehouse manager must set the overall direction of the data
warehouse. This is done in conjunction with key business management. This
includes making sure that a sound technical and data architecture is developed.
The data warehouse manager is the focal point for blending industry best
practices with internal best practices to develop an overall methodology and
techniques that will ensure the long-term success of data warehousing within
the organization. This includes adapting system development life cycle (SDLC)
practices and the deﬁnition of standard deliverables to meet the unique data
warehousing needs.
If there are many data warehousing projects underway, the data ware-
house manager would then be involved in coordinating and leveraging
resources across the projects. These resources could include people as well as
technology.

■Sound analytical and reasoning skills
■Strong presentation and communication skills
■Able to educate others

■Understands the business
■Possesses project management experience
■Has exposure to the technologies involved
■Understands the organization’s culture and how things get done
■Exhibits leadership
■Understands and can manage risk
■Able to manage and coordinate multiple projects and priorities
Business Systems Analyst
The business systems analyst role is similar to the business analyst, but this
person needs to have sound knowledge of data warehousing design principles.
The business systems analyst will participate in, or even drive, the business
requirements gathering process and will be a key player in building the
partnership with the business community. The business systems analyst will
also be expected to do the following:
Participate in the development of the dimensional model
Help research data-related issues
Be a liaison between systems and the business communities for daily
project tasks
Develop and oversee testing plans
Develop project documentation and deliverables
The business systems analyst role is often blended with the business analyst
role. This is effective only if a single person can understand the business clearly
enough and delve deeply enough into the details of data warehouse design
and development.

DESIRED CHARACTERISTICS OF THE BUSINESS SYSTEMS ANALYST
■Excellent problem-solving skills
■Understanding of business processes and functions
■Strong technical background
■Able to facilitate and communicate technical issues to a variety of
audiences
■Understands the system development life cycle
■Good writing skills
■Quick learner
■Persistence to work through complex issues and design challenges
■Enthusiastic, motivated, and curious about learning the business
N O T E The most important characteristic to look for in candidates for the posi-
tion of business systems analyst for a data warehouse project is curiosity. If a
person is sincerely interested in what the business does and how things work, then
this will feed their ability to gather requirements and then translate them into a
solution.
Source System Analyst
The source system analyst is not a full-time member of the data warehouse
project team but plays a critical role. The data warehouse team must have
one source system analyst designated for each source system that will feed
the data warehouse. This person needs to have experience and knowledge
of the underlying systems that will be used to populate the data warehouse.
The source system analyst will also be expected to do the following:
Support the development of the dimensional model
Provide ﬁle layouts, data models, and data element deﬁnitions that exist
for the source systems
Research data-related issues
Serve as the subject matter expert for the source system
When there is limited documentation for source systems, the source system
analyst is often the only person who knows what each data element actually
means. The names and how the source systems use each ﬁeld may be a mystery
without the active participation of this highly valuable resource.

DESIRED CHARACTERISTICS OF THE SOURCE SYSTEM ANALYST
■Strong problem-solving skills
■Persistence to work through complex issues and design challenges
■Patience to support detailed, ﬁeld by ﬁeld analysis
■Willing to put forth extra effort to help the data warehouse initiative
■Understands the critical nature of his or her knowledge
■Able to juggle multiple priorities, including communicating to
management concerns about the scheduling of their own time
■Shows interest in learning about data warehousing
Data Modeler/Data Architect
The data architect’s responsibilities are to develop a big picture strategy for
how data will be handled, stored, and processed to support the requirements of
a speciﬁc project and to accommodate the requirements across the enterprise.
This is the heart of the data warehouse. The data architect sets this vision. This
includes driving or participating in the following:
Deﬁning the data structures and philosophy for the staging area
Deﬁning the data structures and philosophy for the data warehouse
Participating in the requirements gathering process
Understanding speciﬁc project requirements
Gathering or researching enterprise data requirements and standards
Ensuring that the data warehouse architecture ﬁts in the overall enterprise
data vision
Data modeling takes things to a lower level of detail. This entails under-
standing individual data elements and how they relate to each other; and
then applying what was learned during the requirements gathering process
in order to develop data models to support the business. There may be a need
for detailed data modeling to support the staging and preparation processes.
There is also a need for a dimensional model to reﬂect the speciﬁc data needed
to support the business objectives of the project. The model must also be
ﬂexible enough to be extended as new data and requirements are discovered
over time. The basics of a well-designed dimensional model should be able to
sustain a data warehouse for years. The data modeler will be responsible for
the following:

Chapter 4
■Successful IT–Business Partnerships
93
Designing data models and databases to meet current and future needs
Understanding how the data model will support the business reporting
and analyses
Researching data content and availability to ensure that the model is
grounded in reality
Researching and recommending approaches to handle data integration
Performing detailed data analysis to understand the data as it currently
exists
Developing logical database designs
N O T E Dimensional modeling for a traditional data modeler can prove to be very
challenging. If a data modeler or architect is ﬁghting standard data warehousing
practices, take action. Education may not be enough to change their ways. If this
continues, consider reassigning that individual to a traditional project and get
someone who will effectively support the data warehouse. That way, you can still
leverage their skills and experience without causing delays and poor design
choices for the data warehouse.
DESIRED CHARACTERISTICS OF THE DATA MODELER/DATA ARCHITECT
■Understands the business requirements and the business point of view
■Understands the impact of data design on the rest of the project
■Understands data warehouse design best practices and approaches
■Understands how BI tools work and present information to users
■Understands the beneﬁts and purpose of dimensional modeling and is an
expert modeler
■Curious and motivated
■Able to communicate effectively with both business and technical groups
ETL Developer(s)
One of the most complex, challenging, and time-consuming parts of a data
warehouse project is preparing the data for access and analysis. The main steps
are to extract, transform, and load (ETL) the data. There are usually multiple
systems professionals who perform the design and development of the ETL
processes to populate the data warehouse. The lead ETL developer may sit
in on requirements gathering sessions. It is also beneﬁcial for the lead ETL
developer to participate in the creation of the dimensional data model. This
helps to ensure a full understanding of the complete model.

94
Part II
■The Business Side of Data Warehousing
ETL developers work with the rest of the project team to deﬁne rules about
how to clean, validate, and integrate the data. This often involves working
directly with the business community. In some organizations, this must be
done by working through the business system analyst. The ETL developers
spend a lot of time researching and resolving issues discovered in the data as
it is prepared for the data warehousing environment.
DESIRED CHARACTERISTICS OF THE ETL DEVELOPER
■Ability to adapt when changes occur
■Understand the full data warehouse life cycle
■Appreciation and desire to work through data quality issues
■Experienced system developer
■Ability and interest to learn new techniques and approaches
■Creative problem solver
Business Intelligence Application Developer
The business intelligence application developer is responsible for creating and
maintaining queries, reports, and applications. This usually involves using
business intelligence (BI) tools. These tools need to be conﬁgured or set up
properly to access the data mart. Each BI tool has a semantic layer, or metadata,
that it uses to traverse the data and manage deﬁned metrics. Once the BI tool
is conﬁgured, a wide range of activities need to be performed, including the
following:
Designing and developing a suite of report templates
Designing and developing a deployment strategy for reports
Designing and developing performance dashboards or scorecards
Designing and developing BI report and application documentation and
training materials
Supporting business users to help them increase their knowledge and use
of the BI tool
N O T E
There may be two different types of BI developers. The ﬁrst has deep
technical skills and is responsible for installing and conﬁguring the BI technology.
They also design and deploy complex reports and analyses. The second type of BI
developer is less technical and may be ﬁlled from the business community. This
second role is responsible for creating reports and delivering analyses to support

the business community. This second type often directly supports requests from
senior management.
DESIRED CHARACTERISTICS OF THE BI APPLICATION DEVELOPER
■Strong understanding of the business requirements
■Interested in helping the business leverage the data warehouse
■Flexible and able to adapt to ongoing changing requests for information
■Works well with the business community
■Good communication skills
■Able to translate business requests into BI report speciﬁcations
■Strong analytic abilities
Other Supporting Roles
A number of other technical roles are required for successful completion
of a data warehousing project. These include a variety of technical func-
tions, including database administration, security, network administration,
systems architecture, training, testing, and operations support. These people
are involved in making sure that the foundation technologies are set up and
working properly and that the project is deployed successfully.
The roles for the business and IT communities have been described here indi-
vidually, but the real strength of a data warehouse emerges when these people
all work together. Ideas for helping to build and maintain this relationship are
covered next.
Tips for Building and Sustaining a Partnership
Many factors shape a strong partnership between the business and IT. This
section describes a few that may seem to be common sense but are often
overlooked. If you’re from the business community, you should strive to
ensure all of the following:
Make time available to answer questions and clarify concepts. Too often
it is assumed that others understand what you tell them, but you need to
be patient and explain in detail.
Listen to systems personnel to understand what they are trying to com-
municate. You need to be reasonable. IT knows you want everything at
your ﬁngertips for all time in any format that you think of now or in the

96

■The Business Side of Data Warehousing
future. You need to be realistic; what do you need to get your job done
today?
Be willing to make trade-offs—you can’t have everything right away.
Help IT decide where to start and the order to proceed from there. This
includes looking at the cost versus the value of your request. It is critical
to long-term success.
Understand the long-term impact of shortcuts taken today.
Appreciate the courage it takes to deliver ‘‘bad’’ news. Someone has to
stand up and say that the emperor has no clothes!
Listen to your own people; external consultants and experts are not the
only people who know what needs to be done. Help the team by offering
creative business solutions to issues or areas where progress has slowed.
Make sure that business resources are made available when needed and
cut through the red tape whenever possible.
Proactively follow up with the team if you have not heard anything. Teams
can be reluctant to schedule brieﬁngs unless a signiﬁcant milestone has
been met. It is still worthwhile to touch base, even if it is only to report
that everyone is hard at work. Difﬁculties and challenges that have been
discovered can be raised and discussed and any potential impact on the
budget or the schedule can be discussed early.
Take the time to thank members of the project team for their efforts.
If you are from the IT community, you should do the following:
Talk to the business. Communication is the key to a successful partner-
ship. You must provide open and honest communication. This includes
admitting when the team does not have the skills to get the work done or
when you tried something and it did not pan out. We all tend to ﬁnd it
easier to share positive communications, but we owe it to each other to
share it all. You need to be willing to ask for help when you need it.
Invest time in learning about the business. Having a basic understanding
about the core business functions of the data warehouse audience is criti-
cal. Without the basics, it is difﬁcult to conduct meaningful conversations
between the business and IT team members.
Be able to communicate concerns and needs in a manner that resonates
with the business community. This can mean that technical requests need
to be put into business terms. For example, it is not acceptable to request
to purchase more disk space ‘‘because we need it.’’ This is not likely to
be approved without further dialogue. A more useful way to phrase the

Chapter 4
■Successful IT–Business Partnerships
97
same request would be ‘‘because additional disk space is needed to load
the consumer-level data required to perform market basket analysis.’’
Develop realistic project plans and schedules. If the project will realis-
tically take eight months, then do not let the business push you into
promising you can complete it in two.
Make sure the project team stands ﬁrm when necessary. If the business
community is asking for things that are not feasible, it is acceptable to say
no, as long as a sound rationale can be offered.
In addition to internal resources, it is common to also engage external help
for the data warehouse project. The next section describes how to best utilize
these external resources.
Leveraging External Consulting
Each organization must determine what resources are available and where
external help is needed. Some organizations go so far as to completely out-
source the data warehouse design, development, and support. When getting
any external help for the data warehouse, there are several important con-
siderations. A data warehouse will contain critical data and support strategic
planning for the company. It is important that the organization have a clear
understanding of what the data warehouse contains and how it was built. This
is needed to ensure that the organization can properly maintain and sustain
its use over time, especially when all the consultants leave.
The most effective way to get this level of knowledge is to have consultants
work side by side with your internal resources. This enables skills to be learned
by your people. A signiﬁcant side beneﬁt of working on a data warehouse
project is gaining insight into the meaning and use of the organization’s data.
When external consultants are the only people working on the project, they
are the only ones who gain that knowledge and take it with them when
they move to their next engagement. Conversely, if your staff is also involved,
then that knowledge remains with the company.
N O T E Key IT staff members who are strong candidates for the data warehouse
team are usually already tied up with many other responsibilities. When possible,
hire external help to backﬁll some of their other responsibilities and allocate at
least some of their time to the data warehouse. This provides relief in areas that
the organization already knows, and provides growth opportunities for key staff
members.
When consultants are ﬁnishing up an engagement, schedule an exit inter-
view. This is a common practice when employees leave, but it is rarely done

98
Part II
■The Business Side of Data Warehousing
with consultants. If a large team of consultants is involved, conduct the inter-
view with only one or two of the more senior members. Ask what went well,
and where the organization could improve. This also ensures that it is clear
what has been completed, and conﬁrms the next steps to be taken. Make
sure you receive complete and accurate documentation on all aspects of their
engagement. Too often, when winding up an engagement, consultants work
quickly to complete their ﬁnal deliverables, then dash out the door to catch a
plane.
Building Strong Project Teams
Data warehouse projects are not the only projects that require interaction
between systems and business people. The data warehouse project team
members must continue to interact with the business throughout, not just
at the beginning of, the project. To improve these interactions, basic team
building techniques can be used. These are typically used to build relationships
within a group such as bringing together the whole sales force or human
resources groups. These groups have a common bond simply because they
have similar jobs. The data warehouse team consists of people from many
varied backgrounds and positions. Many are on the team because they care
about the company and want to contribute to its success. These people all
work hard and enjoy a good challenge (they won’t be disappointed!).
This cross-functional team needs to work well, so get them together for an
outing, a late afternoon reception, or a long lunch. Run several exercises so
that everyone gets to know each other as individuals. Team members quickly
ﬁnd commonalities: a shared college, children of similar ages, an avid sports
allegiance, and so on. When a personalized relationship exists, it is much easier
to get together to ask questions and to work through issues.
After getting started, several things can be done to help the team run
smoothly. Have the core team members sit in the same area. This fosters open
spontaneous dialogue. Encourage everyone to talk face-to-face, not just via
e-mail. The more everyone ‘‘interfaces,’’ the more they will operate as a single
team, not as individuals completing just one part of a puzzle.
YOU KNOW YOU HAVE A HEALTHY TEAM WHEN:
■They all argue with each other, but also defend attacks on any single team
member.
■They have heated discussions that end with much better ideas generated
and more optimal solutions being developed and everyone happily goes to
lunch together.
(continued)

Chapter 4
■Successful IT–Business Partnerships
99
YOU KNOW YOU HAVE A HEALTHY TEAM WHEN: (continued)
■There are inside jokes.
■Team members or data elements are given nicknames.
■They form a sports team.
Another area that is essential to building strong partnerships is effective
communication. When we fail to communicate, we leave the door open for
doubt, uncertainty, and blame. When we communicate well, we open the door
to trust and partnership.
Effective Communication
There is often a communication gap between the business and systems
communities. The systems groups give brieﬁngs and share presentations.
Unfortunately, these are often not effective. Even when a great deal of effort
has been put into these brieﬁngs, they can still fall short. This is often due to a
lack of communication skills. Many technical people can design and develop
complex and amazing systems, but are unable to discuss what they have done
in plain English. It is hoped that someone in IT management has developed
these skills and can help others grow these skills too. The same problems
exist on the business side as well. The business people understand their world
but are not always effective at communicating it to others. Without effective
communication it is almost impossible to develop a strong partnership. The
most critical areas to improve the effectiveness of this communication follow.
Netting Out Key Messages
When preparing to present to any audience, get back to basics. Ask yourself
the following questions about the audience:
What is their level of exposure to data warehousing or the business?
Assess their level of understanding of this project.
How long do you have for the meeting?
Who called the meeting? If you did not request the meeting, make sure
that you know who asked for it and what they want.
Why were you asked to participate? If you requested the meeting, then
make sure you have a clear purpose.

100
Part II
■The Business Side of Data Warehousing
What do you want to accomplish? For example, a meeting’s purpose may
be to educate senior managers about data warehousing basics, to share
project status, or to ask for more funding.
One way to help hone in on what messages to communicate in a meeting
is to ask yourself what you hope to gain as a result of the meeting. Are you
expecting the group to make a decision? Is this intended to be an informational
session? One technique to help boil things down to the essentials is to identify
three to ﬁve things that you want the audience to walk away knowing. Much
more than that and you have too much content for a single session.
Each session should have a clear and fairly speciﬁc objective. You will not
be able to provide an introduction to data warehouse concepts, details about
dimensional modeling, and a review of the project scope in a single half-hour
meeting. It would be more beneﬁcial to set up several meetings so that a single
topic can be covered thoroughly. A series of short meetings can be much more
effective than trying to cram everything you ever wanted know about data
warehousing and your project into one meeting. Such broad, all-encompassing
sessions provide too much information to absorb and the weary audience often
leaves confused, having missed the key point of the meeting. This also leaves
the attendees without a desire to come to another meeting.
Getting down to the key messages is one of the most difﬁcult things to
accomplish. We are often surrounded by a sea of details. From the systems
side, there are so many exciting things to share, such as using new interfaces,
protocols, and development techniques. However, these are unlikely to be
of much interest to the business community. The business community only
wants to know about things that will impact them directly. For example, details
regarding a version of the database interface that does not work properly with
the current version of the data access tool and is impacting the performance
of everything else hosted on the same server is really not important to the
business. What matters to them is that due to technical compatibility issues,
the project team needs to extend the development schedule by three weeks.
Note also whether the resources needed to resolve the current problem(s) are
working on it. If not, then you need to share what you need to get it resolved.
Presenting in Business Terms
Another important, yet difﬁcult aspect of communication is sharing everything
in business terms. This can be particularly challenging for IT team members,
especially if there is little interaction between groups. Too often, the technical
team members can only see and understand the development side of things,
and they don’t have any idea how what they do impacts the business commu-
nity. Although it is not necessary for every member on the team to be able to
translate technical topics into business impact, at least one person must have
that ability.

Chapter 4
■Successful IT–Business Partnerships
101
Many times there are detailed discussions about data sources and individual
data elements. Due to how the current source systems work, it is possible (and
unfortunately fairly common) for data that is needed to allow integration with
other systems to not be captured. The content may be known at the time that
the transaction was being processed, but it was not stored in the system. This
is usually because that piece of data is not needed to complete that speciﬁc
function, but it may be critical to support reporting and analysis later. Below
is a sample business description of a data integration problem.
The order entry system tracks every product and service in detail, to ensure that
the correct products are delivered. When invoicing the clients, the products and
services are grouped to support tiered pricing, and customer volume discounts
are applied. Given that the order entry system is focused on delivery, it does not
contain any pricing. The invoicing system does not retain the link between the
individual products and services and the line items on the invoice. The products
are delivered appropriately and invoices are accurately generated. Unfortunately,
this missing link limits the detailed analyses that can be done. High-level analysis
of the entire invoice by customer can be done, but detailed analysis of the
proﬁtability at the product level of detail cannot be easily done.
There must be enough substance to help everyone understand the problem
itself—that there is missing data. Then, there must be a description about
what that means. In this case, high-level analysis can be achieved with order
and invoice data, but detailed analysis cannot be supported. This could be
signiﬁcant if the primary objective of the project was to support product level
pricing and proﬁtability analysis. Without that link to the business capability,
the business community usually blindly trusts the project team to do the
right thing. Then, during deployment the impact of the missing data link is
understood. This is where many problems between the business community
and the systems groups arise.
Now, the business is not satisﬁed because their true requirement is not being
met, and the systems team members are frustrated because they feel like the
business agreed to move forward without the link. Looking at the nitty-gritty,
both are right. Ensuring that each issue or topic is presented in business terms
can help prevent this type of communication problem from happening.
Meeting Preparation
Preparation is the one factor that you can control in order for your meetings
and brieﬁngs to be successful. Just as you go through a checklist of things you
need before you go camping, you should review a checklist before going into
a management brieﬁng:
Check the technical setup in the room to ensure that the presentation can
be projected.

102
Part II
■The Business Side of Data Warehousing
Conﬁrm that the seating capacity of the room is appropriate for the
number of people who will attend. Make sure that you count the formal
invitees as well as any team members who will also be attending.
Bring handouts printed in a readable font (if you expect anyone over 40
years old, use a 12-point font or pass out reading glasses).
Bring supporting material so that many questions can be addressed
during the meeting. This builds momentum.
While getting ready for any brieﬁng, work with other team members to
brainstorm likely questions from the audience. Practice what answers or
responses will be given.
Schedule the room 30 minutes in advance of the actual meeting to allow
time for setup. It is too stressful to be pacing in the hallway while a group
is ﬁnishing up their meeting. This also means that you are setting up
while the attendees are waiting for the meeting to begin.
Over time, these guidelines will become a natural part of planning a meeting.
A speciﬁc checklist may not be needed, but the list should still be reviewed in
your head prior to any meeting.
Presentation Tips
Presentations are more effective if you observe the following suggestions:
Limit the total number of words per slide. If the font is less than 22,
you have too many words. Consider simplifying the bullets or divide the
content into several slides. Another alternative is to produce a supporting
document that contains all the details, while the presentation captures
the highlights. This enables the audience to refer to the details in the
document in the future.
Estimate an average of three minutes per slide of content. Don’t count
title pages, but then add ﬁve minutes to the beginning and the end for
introductions and wrap-up.
Keep the background of the presentation light. While dark slides with
white lettering seem like a good idea, they tend to be too dark and can
make the audience sleepy. Light backgrounds are crisp and easy to read.
Pay attention to nonverbal audience feedback. If the audience is reading
ahead, then you need to pick up the pace. Condense what you need to
communicate and get to the bottom line. This may also indicate that the
content is too detailed.
Keep a running list of things that need additional action. Summarize
these at the end of the meeting, including who in the room is responsible
for taking that action (at least until the task is assigned to someone else).

Chapter 4

103
When to Communicate
Communication is at the heart of a partnership. It needs to be timely, accurate,
and relevant to be effective. Too often, unless there is a really big topic, there
is limited formal communication between the data warehouse project team
and management. Project status is regularly reported throughout the project
management channels, but that is not sufﬁcient. The project status simply
notes if the project is on schedule or not. It may even highlight one or two big
issues, but this is usually not in enough detail to ensure that all appropriate
parties understand the impact. Moreover, the data warehouse is often only
one of dozens of projects reported through this channel. Unless the project is
tagged ‘‘red’’ to indicate that the project is behind schedule, managers may
only brieﬂy glance at the status.
Each different level of the organization has a different recommended
frequency of communication. Clearly, the project team (including business
analysts) should have regular, probably weekly, meetings to review progress
and share concerns or roadblocks. As part of business group or department
meetings, the rest of the business analysts can be kept up to date. The business
champion often schedules weekly meetings to be kept informed. If no big
issues need resolution and the team is simply working, the business champion
may only want biweekly meetings.
Initially, there may be interest from management to meet regularly to learn
more about data warehousing, information management (as discussed in
Chapter 8), or other related topics. Once the data warehouse is underway,
the executive sponsor should be formally briefed every quarter. A special
meeting should be called if any major challenges facing the data warehouse
arise between these brieﬁngs.
N O T E Regular project brieﬁngs are always recommended. At a minimum, week-
ly or biweekly meetings with the business champion, and quarterly for the execu-
tive business sponsor, are suggested. This is important even when there is nothing
to report—no deliverables have been completed. In addition, project teams usually
tolerate a fairly high level of static and loss of momentum without wanting to
bother management and ask for help. Business management may be able to clear
these hurdles quickly and get the team moving forward again. If you wait until
there is news, it may be a long time. Letting everyone know that the project is still
alive and working is important.
Effective communication helps to build a successful data warehouse. In
order to ensure longevity of the data warehouse, there is additional work that
must be done. After the initial project is complete, subsequent projects can be
set up to run simultaneously. The next section shares ideas to help manage
these ongoing challenges.

104
Part II
■The Business Side of Data Warehousing
Partnerships Beyond a Project
Additional responsibilities are needed to sustain a data warehouse environ-
ment that will outlive a single data warehouse project. These vary in size and
scope according to the size of your enterprise and the organizational politics
in your company.
Good working relationships are formed when teams are fully engaged
on a project. On a well-structured project, representatives from the business
and technical groups meet weekly. This regular interaction builds a strong
relationship.
Once that project ends, the relationship should continue. The technical team
that is supporting the data warehouse must continue to work with the business
groups who are using it. This encompasses typical maintenance activities such
as tracking and resolving problems and collecting enhancement requirements
for new reports, analyses, and additional data.
The data warehouse manager can be the driving force to consciously
maintain these relationships. Periodic brieﬁngs and planning sessions should
continue over time, enhancements will be packaged together and released
on a regular basis, and new projects will be initiated. All of these should occur
as a result of both business and systems requirements. The dialogue must
continue to ensure that the data warehouse environment delivers value into
the future.
The Decision-Making Process
Many of the things that make a data warehouse project interesting also increase
the challenges. Serving the needs of multiple groups of people is always
challenging. The product development group has a different perspective than
the logistics planning group. Delivering data that is useful to multiple functions
of the business implies that each of these groups will want input into what the
solution looks like. Each group will be concerned about when their speciﬁc
requirements will be addressed. This creates a suite of issues that cannot
be addressed by an individual project team or by systems management. It
requires that mechanisms be put into place to ensure that decisions are made
by the business community in a manner that looks at what is best for the overall
organization. These challenges only increase when multiple data warehouse
projects are running at the same time.
Executive Steering Committee
Often, multiple departments or divisions of a company have requirements for
the data warehouse. A committee of executives is needed to help set the direc-
tion and priorities for the data warehouse. This committee could be addressing

Chapter 4
■Successful IT–Business Partnerships
105
the diverse needs of a single project or balancing the needs of multiple projects.
This committee should be comprised of the executive business sponsors from
each data warehouse project, augmented by representatives from other areas
that have a vested interest in the data warehouse.
The committee should have a representative from each of the business
groups who are currently involved with, using, or planning to use, the data
warehouse. Each person who is named to be on the committee must be able
to see the big picture, not just the immediate needs of his or her own group.
Each member of the committee must be empowered to make decisions. This
includes making compromises that may involve deferring their own solutions
for others that will have a larger impact on the business as a whole.
The committee may meet more frequently when initially building the data
warehouse or planning a major enhancement project. On an ongoing basis,
executive steering committees typically meet less often, perhaps on a quarterly
basis. In preparation, each area should submit their requests to the data
warehouse manager. Each individual data warehouse project team will work
with their business champion to develop any requests that need to go to the
committee. These requests can be project change requests and/or proposals
for new projects, or may be issues that need strategic and cross-functional
input to resolve.
The speciﬁc executive business sponsor should be briefed about the requests
from their own group or project. Each request should include the business
beneﬁt, the estimated effort, the risk of not moving forward, and other time
constraints or windows that need to be met. The data warehouse manager
will compile these to be presented at the committee meeting. There may
be instances when the committee’s insight is needed for enterprise direction
between their regularly scheduled meetings.
The merits of each request must be considered. Every request that makes
it this far is legitimate and will help the organization in some way. However,
resources are limited, and everything can’t be done at the same time. Based
upon overall business priorities, the optimal sequence of addressing these
requests must be determined. In fact, the whole list does not need to be
prioritized. Just select those requests that can be met next. This does not mean
the others will not be done at all, but simply acknowledges that they are not
as critical as other requests at this time.
Between committee meetings, decisions can be made with the data ware-
house manager and appropriate executive business sponsors. Sometimes, an
enhancement can be scoped, designed, built, and tested before the committee
meets again. If resources are available and all of the groups involved agree,
then there is no need to wait. It is helpful for project teams to set up guidelines
outlining when requests must go through the committee.
The executive steering committee is still needed to set priorities and make
decisions that cross business group boundaries, even when multiple data

106
Part II
■The Business Side of Data Warehousing
warehousing projects are not involved. Some enhancements may support only
one group’s needs. Again, this provides a mechanism to determine what will
be worked on next.
GUIDELINES FOR STEERING COMMITTEE REQUESTS
■A collection of enhancements and/or bug ﬁxes that will exceed a
threshold number of hours of effort, as set by this organization
■Any project or enhancement that will cost more than a threshold deter-
mined by this organization
■Projects that have enterprise implications
Other topics that the executive steering committee may also be requested
to assist with include the resolution of cross-functional conﬂicts or issues that
have not been able to be resolved via other avenues. The speciﬁc details of the
problem may not actually warrant the attention of this high-level person, but
if the data warehouse team is not able to get the cooperation of the parties who
should be able to resolve the issue, it needs to be escalated.
The committee must also approve and agree with the strategic data ware-
house architecture (details in Chapter 9). The ﬁrst part is to understand and
approve the strategy. Next, the steering committee must help to enforce it.
This means that projects that do not follow the data warehouse architecture
are halted until they determine how they will comply.
DW Business Support Team
In addition to the executive steering committee, it is beneﬁcial to have a
core group of people who can provide daily input and guidance for the data
warehouse. During a data warehouse project, there are regular status meetings
and periodic brieﬁngs. When there is a lot of project activity, weekly meetings
are appropriate for many organizations. The team may meet less often when
there is not as much activity. This ensures that all of the different groups who
have a vested interest in the results of the project stay informed.
When the project is complete, issues continue to come up that need to be
addressed, including the following:
Enhancements to the underlying operational system to better support the
data warehouse
Changes in the business, such as the introduction of new product lines
Migration to new versions of software—data warehouse tools or other
system tools

Chapter 4
■Successful IT–Business Partnerships
107
Business processes are streamlined
New, special cases appear in the data, combinations of things that simply
had not arisen up to this point
New types of analyses may be needed
Query performance may slow down and need some attention
Even if you are not in the middle of a data warehouse project, you will still
ﬁnd it beneﬁcial for a cross-functional group of business representatives to
meet regularly with the data warehouse manager. This team may also include
other technical data warehouse staff members. This is a forum to raise any
concerns or issues that you may have.
This team is most effective if they have regularly scheduled meetings. Topics
are introduced and responsibility is assigned to research and follow up, and
the results from previous topics or issues are discussed. This meeting should
be strictly limited to one hour, as this will encourage continued participation.
This is a long-established technique to ensure ongoing growth and support for
the data warehouse.
Enterprise Considerations
The complexities and challenges of developing strong data warehouse teams
are even greater for large enterprises. One approach that can help leverage
skills and experience across the organization is to form an enterprise data
warehouse team. This team can be a group that reports directly to a single
manager or a group distributed throughout the organization with dotted-line
responsibility to an enterprise team. Chapter 13 contains details about how
such a team can be structured and funded.
In Real Life
Many organizations struggle with bridging the gap between the business and
systems communities. Let’s take a look at how this is working for the data
warehouse teams in the big and small companies we are tracking.
A Glimpse into Giant, Co.
In order to manage the sheer number of employees within the organization,
well-deﬁned roles and responsibilities have been developed. These are quite
rigid, which can create big problems if someone reaches beyond his or her
area of responsibility. Employees have a very strong territorial attitude toward
their work, especially in IT. There are set channels for who talks to whom and

108
Part II
■The Business Side of Data Warehousing
when. The responsibility to interact on a daily basis with the data warehouse
project team has been assigned to a business analyst who produces the group’s
standard reports today. Any of the project team’s attempts to talk directly to
other business people are thwarted.
Speciﬁcally within IT there is a great deal of concern about who is working
on what. Because the actual lines of delineation can blur on a data warehouse
project, this is causing anxiety and concern for the IT project team members.
Successful people follow the rules and there is concern that stepping outside
these historical boundaries will impact their individual success.
To overcome these organizational challenges both business and IT manage-
ment need to stay tuned in to the data warehouse team members. Variations
that will get the work done better and in a timelier manner should be
encouraged.
Rather than set data warehouse roles in stone, they have been drafted in
clay. As the project moves forward and the data warehouse environment
evolves, they will be reviewed and revised as needed. In order to get the
project team members to interact with each other and the business people
involved with the project, an afternoon outing was planned, which included
bowling and pizza. This provided an opportunity for everyone to mingle. The
chance to get to know one another and the shared interest and responsibility
to build a successful data warehouse has changed the dynamics of how
the group interacts. All levels of management continue to encourage open
communication and team problem solving, which had helped to develop a
stronger and valued partnership between the business and IT.
Insight from Agile, Inc.
There is easy and direct access into the business community for the data
warehouse project team and everyone is caught up in the excitement of
building a data warehouse. When getting things started, there are many
volunteers to help out. However, because there is so much going on, there
really is no time to spare. There are daily crises that need attention. This is
constantly taking up all of the resources, and the data warehouse project never
moves forward.
Instead of allowing everyone to sign up to be on the project, select individuals
must be chosen to participate. Then, and this is the hard part, time must be
allocated for those chosen individuals. Their time cannot be ﬁlled with the
next crisis. The organization will never get out of a crisis management mode
until strategic work, including the data warehouse, is completed. Then, the
data warehouse can help more quickly to address these situations.

Summary
A strong partnership between the business and IT communities is one of the
best predictors of the long-term success of any data warehouse project. To
accomplish this, both the business and IT communities, at all levels, must
play an active role to ensure data warehouse success. This involvement begins
when a project is started and must continue throughout. The key to a successful
partnership is open communication, as well as joint and equal ownership of
success or failure. The next chapter focuses on what needs to happen to get a
project started.

Setting Up a Successful
Project
Opportunities for data warehousing can be identiﬁed using the techniques
described in Chapter 3. Now that the organization has determined that a data
warehouse would be beneﬁcial, it is time to set up a DW project. This involves
more than just getting permission and some funding. This chapter takes you
step by step through the process of starting a successful DW project:
Setting up a project charter
Deﬁning the scope of work
Formally launching the project
Suggestions for managing change on a DW project
Setting the project up correctly is a critical step toward ensuring suc-
cess. Some organizations have very rigorous project management procedures
already in place. If so, please continue to leverage those methods and tech-
niques. If not, then the following techniques can be adopted. The goal is to
clearly articulate what you are trying to accomplish.
Deﬁning the Project
The business community should be involved up front, setting overall goals
and budgeting for the entire data warehouse and for speciﬁc data warehouse
projects. In some organizations, this is done without assistance from IT. The
business must determine what they want, and then IT must help to deﬁne
what is entailed in delivering that solution. Business involvement must not
stop after the project is deﬁned. As discussed in Chapter 4, the business and
systems communities need to work together.
Since the organization has progressed to this point, there is usually a good
idea of where there are needs that a data warehouse could help address. A spe-
ciﬁc project may have been identiﬁed while looking at the strategic direction
111

■The Business Side of Data Warehousing
of the organization, or one group may have speciﬁc requirements such as the
need for integrated sales and marketing data to improve promotion effective-
ness. To start a DW project, certain standard tasks need to be accomplished.
The ﬁrst step is usually to create a project charter, a high-level proposal to get
resources allocated to further deﬁne the project.
Setting Up the Project Charter
A project charter is the written proposal that is used to communicate the
business case to fund the project. This is typically developed by business
representatives with input from their IT counterparts. Then, the project charter
is used by the organization’s management to decide whether there is enough
potential value to pursue the project. The objective is to get permission to
move to the next step of fully ﬂeshing out the project, which is described in
the next section.
It can be dangerous for a business group to set up a charter for a DW project
without any input from IT. For example, it is easy for a business group to
deﬁne a project that is not feasible due to limitations in the organization’s data.
It is also just as dangerous for IT to set up a project charter without appropriate
input from the business. This can lead to a project that moves data but does
not support real business objectives. This effort to develop the project charter
should be led by an individual, either business or IT, who has strong project
management skills, knowledge of the business area to be supported, and, if
possible, a basic understanding of data warehousing.
The project charter is a broad description of what the project sets out to
accomplish. It must be written so that anyone can read and understand the
content without having intimate knowledge of the data warehouse or this spe-
ciﬁc project. It is a general-purpose document that should be understandable
to others in the organization. It should not provide details that are generally
known by anyone working for the organization, such as a description of what
the claims handling group does. A general description of the project is needed,
along with the project deliverables, or what the project will produce.
Estimated effort and schedule should also be included in the project charter.
Given general project experience and some data warehouse knowledge, a
general timeline can be set. For example, a project to develop a comprehensive
data warehouse strategy could take a couple of weeks to get the project off
the ground, four weeks to gather requirements, and another month to create,
document, present, and reﬁne the strategy. This would total a ten-week effort.
This general timeframe can be used to develop a rough cost estimate. Using a
fully loaded personnel cost of $100,000 per year, this ten-week project with an
average of three people would be about $60,000. This estimate is from a very
high level and may change as speciﬁc project details are deﬁned.
It is helpful to identify project costs that are an investment in setting
up a good data warehouse foundation, such as hardware and software

Chapter 5
■Setting Up a Successful Project
113
purchases. These should be split from the speciﬁc project costs. Typically,
the project-speciﬁc costs and only a portion of the greater investment are used
to determine the return on investment for this speciﬁc project.
The other side of the funding issue is estimating the return on this invest-
ment, which is challenging to put your ﬁnger on. Data warehouses do not
usually provide ﬁxed cost savings or reduced headcount, but rather enable
the business to do more than what is currently possible. This empowers them
to make better business decisions that will increase proﬁts or, in some cases,
help keep the company solvent.
The key to understanding value is to identify what the data warehouse will
do. This is what is included in the project charter objectives. For example,
translate a goal of helping the organization to retain customers into a ﬁnancial
value. This can be done by identifying the current retention rate and the target
rate. What is the average ‘‘value’’ or revenue per customer? Use this number
to apply to every customer who is retained. For example, if the retention rate
is currently 73% and the data warehouse helps move this to 76%, this is a 3%
increase. If each customer’s revenue is $150 per year and you have 13 million
customers, then this would be increased revenue of $58.5 million per year.
Therefore, if you only give 10% of the credit to the data warehouse, this is still
almost $6 million of increased revenue in the ﬁrst year.
Using this business case approach, organizations can usually identify ﬁve
to ten goals that the data warehouse can help achieve. Identify the potential
ﬁnancial impact for each. Often, the potential return on the data warehouse
investment is absurdly large. Justify the data warehouse on a fraction of the
potential return. This type of investigation cannot be done by systems alone,
but must be done by the business community.
T I P
Build a business-IT partnership from the beginning. The overall purpose of
the project must come from the business, and project logistics must come from
systems.
The easiest way to understand project deliverables is to see a sample.
Throughout this book, examples are included for a call center data warehouse.
The project charter is the ﬁrst. It can be extremely challenging to deﬁne
and accurately estimate the cost and effort to design and build a complete
end-to-end data warehouse. It is much more effective to split this into two
separate projects. The ﬁrst project can gather business requirements and create
the data model for the database organized to support the business. A second
project can be deﬁned to build what was designed in the ﬁrst project. Figure 5-1
shows a project charter for a ﬁrst project to gather business requirements and
develop the data model to support a call center. The sections of the project
charter are as follows:

Background
The organization has been experiencing an increase in customer sales, mostly through
the internet sales channel. This has also increased the demand on our call center to
provide follow on customer support. We need to increase the efficiency of the call
center. The organization has also struggled with providing timely, reliable, consistent,
information to the users for reporting and analysis purposes. The business support team
has been overburdened with producing reports. Many extracts and manual processes
have been created to meet these needs. There is a significant backlog of requests. 
Project Description
The Call Center Data Warehouse Requirements Project will focus on understanding the
business requirements for a data warehouse solution. The project will also produce a
dimension data model that will serve as the cornerstone for the data warehouse. This
data model will reflect the business perspective of the data needed to produce call
center performance measurements. 
This should be considered a design project and will not actually build any parts of the
data warehouse. However, as a result of clarifying requirements and design, the project
will be able to more accurately define a subsequent project to actually build the data
warehouse, business intelligence applications to support the management of the Call
Centers. Without the detailed design, there are too many unknown factors to develop an
accurate plan. 
Project Objectives
The project will create the design for the data warehouse. The objectives are to:
• 
Clarify the specific business objectives for the data warehouse. 
• 
Develop a data model that is easily understood by the target data warehouse
 
business users.
• 
Understand the data sources that may be used to populate the data warehouse.
• 
Identify data integration and quality issues that will need to be addressed when
 
constructing the data warehouse. 
• 
Develop a realistic estimate of the cost, schedule, and resources that will be
 
needed to build and deploy the data warehouse. 
Project Assumptions
• 
A total of 12 requirement gathering sessions will be conducted and documented.
• 
A maximum of 2 data sources will be analyzed and used as the basis for
 
developing the dimensional model. 
• 
A single integrated dimensional model will be developed.
• 
Data element and business measure definitions will be developed and documented
 
by business personnel.

Estimated Benefit: This project will not result in a direct financial benefit to the
 
organization. The project will allow the business to more clearly articulate specific
 
financial benefits of building the data warehouse. The project team will be able to
 
more accurately estimate the cost to develop and implement the call center data
 
warehouse. Other critical obstacles and risks can also be identified and plans
 
developed to mitigate those risks. 
• 
Estimated Project Schedule: It is expected to take 1 month for planning and
 
scheduling for the requirements gathering process. The requirements gathering
 
and documentation is estimated to take 8 weeks. The development of the
 
dimensional model is estimated to take 8 more weeks. This is a total of 20 weeks
 
for the entire project. 
Critical Success Factors
• 
Executive management support is needed to encourage active participation of both
 
business and systems personnel who will be involved in this initiative.
• 
One of the most critical factors to successfully complete this project is the
 
availability of key business people. Direct interaction between the business
 
community and the project team is needed to ensure that the resulting data model
 
will support the business. 
• 
In addition to availability of the business community, it is also critical that the project
 
team have direct access to those persons who are knowledgeable in the systems
 
that contain the data that will ultimately be loaded in the data warehouse.
• 
Both business and IT staff must be committed to reaching a consensus on the
 
findings and recommended scope of the construction project. 
• 
The decision makers, both the executive sponsor and the data warehouse steering
 
committee, must be willing to make timely decisions needed to keep this effort
 
moving forward and to define the subsequent project.

when the project is completed. These should provide insight into why
this project is being undertaken.
Project assumptions are the major factors that were used to estimate the
effort and resources being requested.
Project major deliverables details the speciﬁc outputs that will be created
by this project.
Estimated project size provides several parameters that are needed to get
project funding. This includes an estimated cost, which is often a size
using thresholds that are useful to the organization. This section also
includes estimated beneﬁts and project schedule.
Success factors are the things that must be in place for this project to be
completed successfully.
Project approval is the signatures of the executive business sponsor and IT
sponsor. This may also include the business champion and DW manager
named in the document.
Looking at this sample project charter, you may be surprised at the length
of time estimated to gather requirements and develop a data model. There
are many different approaches to building a DW, some of which would affect
this estimate. Before judging this to be too long or too short, it is important to
understand the work that will be done during these twenty weeks. Chapter 6
provides details about what is involved for requirements gathering, while
Chapter 7 describes the data modeling effort. This work is intended to deﬁne
a foundation that, when built, will hold up for years to come. The details
regarding what work is actually being planned should be deﬁned in additional
project documents, which are described in the next section.
Once the project charter is completed, it is presented to the person or group
who approves project funding. Each organization has a different approval
process. For many, approval means that this project is fully funded and is
ready to get started. If this is true for your organization, then it may be prudent
to complete more detailed planning prior to submitting the project charter.
For many other organizations, approval of a project charter is simply the
permission to move to the next step of planning, described in the next section.
This approval usually means that the funds are budgeted for this project.
If the project charter is not approved, then it is important to understand
why. The data warehouse may not be a high enough priority at this time or

Chapter 5

perhaps the proposal was not clear enough to convey the potential beneﬁts.
Clarify what else would be needed to resubmit the proposed project charter
and try again. For those projects ready to move forward, more detailed
planning is needed, and it is time to engage a project manager.
Documenting Project Scope
Project scope articulates both what a project will include and what it will
not include. This is a vehicle that must be used to manage the expectations
of all the different people involved. The information should be written at a
high level in plain, easily understood terms, and should not be too long or
else no one will bother to read it. Documenting project scope is a joint effort
between the business champion, the project manager, and the data warehouse
manager.
Combined, these people have insight into business needs and exposure
and/or experience with data warehouse design, and the project manager
provides the structure. Further investigation must be done to ﬂesh out the
big picture that was laid out in the project charter. This research includes
reviewing candidate data sources, data warehouse strategies, and business
objectives.
Figure 5-2 shows a sample project scope. This shows the minimum informa-
tion that is needed to supplement the project charter. The scope must include
what is in scope, what is out of scope, a description of the scope management
process to be used, and identify project risks. It may not be appropriate to
publish the ﬁnancial information, such as employee costs, that is included in
the project charter to a wide audience. If this is the case, then the project scope
can be expanded to include nonsensitive project information from the project
scope. That is, different documents may have a different audience, with the
charter for appropriate managers and the scope for general use.
The overall project vision is set in the project charter and the project scope
provides additional parameters. Now, it is time to look in more detail at the
work to be done. This is needed to develop more realistic cost and schedule
estimates.
Developing a Statement of Work
A statement of work provides more detail than the project charter and scope.
It describes the high-level project tasks and identiﬁes project team members
by role. While a statement of work is required from external consulting
organizations, it can also be effective to quantify the work to be done by
internal resources too. This is the contract that deﬁnes the work that will be
done.

■The Business Side of Data Warehousing
Call Center DW Requirements Project Scope 
In Scope
This project will
• 
Collect business requirements across primary business units including sales,
 
marketing, call center, product planning, and finance
• 
Develop a single integrated data model to support the business intelligence needs.
• 
Develop a comprehensive project plan to identify tasks that need to be completed
 
to fully develop and implement a business intelligence solution.
• 
Explore and prioritize scope of possible subsequent implementation efforts. These
 
will be developed and evaluated jointly by business and systems management.  
Out of Scope
This project will not
• 
Develop or implement any software or applications. This is strictly a design effort.
 
The actual development will be a subsequent project that will utilize the results of
 
this design effort. 
• 
Address requirements of human resources, accounting, or facilities management
 
areas of the organization.
Scope Management Process
The project team will track project issues to determine the potential impact on the
overall project scope, price, and/or timing of the project. For those issues that require
changes to the project charter, change management procedures will be used.
• 
A Project Change Request (PCR) will be the vehicle for communicating change.
 
The PCR must describe the change, the rationale for the change, and the effect the
 
change will have on the project. 
Project Risks
The major factors that could impact the ability for this project to be successful include:
• 
Lack of clear communication from the business community of their business
 
challenges, reporting, and analytical requirements.
• 
Inability to access the appropriate business people for interviews, reviewing project
 
documents, and to answer questions.
• 
Inability to get timely answers from the business community for data-related
 
questions.
• 
Inability to have access to the appropriate systems people who have detailed
 
knowledge of the data sources to be modeled. This includes getting timely answers
 
from the systems community about data-related questions.
Figure 5-2 Sample project scope
A complete statement of work can be quite lengthy, so only excerpts are
shown in Figure 5-3 to aid in understanding what can be included. This is
often developed by a project manager in conjunction with the data warehouse
manager. Input from the people responsible for performing the tasks is also
important. The people who will do the work usually have the best idea of how
long the work will take, both effort and elapsed time. This should be reviewed
and understood by the business champion too.

project.
How Much Will It Cost?
Data warehousing is not cheap. It requires the investment of many resources,
especially key individuals across the organization. Without leveraging the
appropriate business staff, the organization may never see a return on the
investment spent on hardware and software. Don’t just buy things; you must
invest time and energy participating in the project. The work involved is
described throughout the rest of the book.
If this is your ﬁrst data warehouse project, the technical foundation must be
put in place. The investment in hardware and software must be made to get
started. The platforms and technologies selected need to support growth and

Chapter 5
■Setting Up a Successful Project
121
expand as the data warehouse grows. It is worth building a strong foundation
so that other data warehouse projects can leverage what has been built. If you
are adding to an existing data warehouse or building a new data mart, the
overall cost may be signiﬁcantly less, if you can leverage the technology that
is already in place. In this case, most of the investment will be centered on
the data and delivery into the business community. Remember to highlight
the costs that are an investment for the entire enterprise so that these can be
isolated from the project-speciﬁc costs. Project-speciﬁc costs should be used to
determine the return on investment for this project.
Building a data warehouse is not like ordering a laptop computer. Unfortu-
nately, there is no central website where you can make a series of choices and
see the price build as you go. While basic hardware and software costs can be
estimated, however, some of the biggest costs result from the people required
to do the work. The most costly part of the project is during the construction
phase. Many resources are needed for extracting, transforming (or preparing),
and loading the data for analysis.
Data warehouse budgets range from tens of thousands into the millions of
dollars. These costs are inﬂuenced by the following:
Size of the data
Complexity of the business itself
Overall size of the organization
Some small companies have extremely large volumes of data and high levels
of complexity. Some large companies have a lot of data, but the analyses are
straightforward.
For new data warehouse efforts, it is advisable to break the project up into
smaller pieces. It can be extremely difﬁcult to estimate the effort required to
design and build a data warehouse before full requirements are gathered.
After all, you don’t really know what you are going to build! That is why you
must set up an initial project to gather requirements (Chapter 6), deﬁne the
overall data architecture (Chapter 9), and then design the solution (Chapter 7).
Once the data model is designed, you know what will be built. Then it will
be reasonable to estimate what it will cost to build and deploy the data
warehouse. For subsequent work, it is still advisable to break things up into
more manageable projects with shorter timeframes to deliver results.
The most accurate estimates of effort are created with the involvement of
the people who will actually be doing the work. The data modeler should be
consulted prior to estimating the time needed to develop the data model. In
addition to the estimates to complete speciﬁc tasks, the overall effort must
include project management and administrative overhead. The task estimates
and overhead can be combined to provide a realistic estimate of the effort
needed. This can be translated into costs by applying the organization’s

122
Part II
■The Business Side of Data Warehousing
loaded costs for personnel to the effort. The total estimated project cost is the
sum of the cost for hardware, software, and personnel. This estimated cost
should be compared to what was estimated in the project charter. Any major
differences must be explained. The project, including the scope, statement of
work, and this new, typically more accurate estimated cost, must be approved
before starting the work.
W A R N I N G
Do not fall into the trap whereby projects don’t have the time or
money to do the right thing the ﬁrst time. Otherwise, a second project is needed to
make corrections and clean up the data warehouse. This is a very costly way to do
business, one that is appallingly more common than you would think! Don’t give in
to short-term goals at the expense of long-term objectives.
Project Approval
This is the second time that this project must go through an approval process.
This may be done as a single step depending on how project funding and
approval works within the organization. Usually, funds for the project are
budgeted when the project charter is approved. Now that more details of
the project are deﬁned, the approval process may be simpler. Often, as long
as the project estimated cost is within the budgeted amount, the approval
process may be as simple as providing the completed statement of work to
the executive and IT sponsors for their signatures. Sometimes approval of the
business champion and the data warehouse manager are all that is needed.
If the project scope varies from the original project charter (business objec-
tives and content, price, or schedule) additional steps should be taken. The
project charter itself should be revised, and presented again to gain the appro-
priate approvals. This helps to ensure that there is a common understanding
of what the project is going to do, and that the revised cost and time schedules
are clear.
Although this may seem like a lot of work just to get started, it does not
need to take a lot of time to put these documents together, perhaps a couple of
weeks, and they will go a long way toward setting up a realistic and attainable
project.
Starting the Project
Now that the project is fully approved, it is time to get things really moving.
This is not intended to be a text on project management or a step-by-step guide
for the project team. However, it is worth mentioning what happens once the
project is approved. To get things started, the project manager must work with
business and IT management to do the following:

Chapter 5
■Setting Up a Successful Project
123
Allocate resources, including enterprise resources as needed.
Develop the detailed project plan that outlines the speciﬁc tasks, the effort
to complete them, the timing, and the resources assigned.
The project manager typically drives this effort, but he or she needs the
cooperation of managers to allocate the people, and then those people need
to provide input regarding the development of the project plan. Once these
initial steps are completed, it is time to formally get the project off the ground.
Launching the Project
There are two different aspects to a project launch. First, the core project team
needs to get together and ensure that they understand the project charter,
the scope, and the statement of work. This project kick-off is the ofﬁcial
beginning of the project. The individual team members need to understand
the objectives in order to ﬂesh out the project plan. Each of these core team
members will provide input to the project manager about his or her tasks. The
business champion and business analyst(s) who are assigned to the project are
sufﬁcient representation from the business community. The core project team
may meet several times to ensure that the project plan is set.
The second project launch is more public. This is a meeting to introduce the
project to the members of the business community and their managers. All
of the people who will be part of the requirements-gathering process should
attend this meeting. They need to learn about the purpose of the project, why
it is important to their group, and what they will be expected to do. (More
details about business involvement in the requirements-gathering process is
included in Chapter 6.)
Let everyone know that the executive business sponsor is on the agenda.
Attendance increases when others know who will be speaking. The sponsor
should welcome everyone and introduce the project. This conveys the impor-
tance of the project to the senior staff. The executive business sponsor should
participate even if it is only for the ﬁrst ﬁve minutes. Figure 5-4 shows a sample
agenda for a project launch. This single launch with the business community
can save time in each requirements-gathering session.
If a formal project launch is not feasible, then an introductory letter can be
sent from the executive business sponsor to provide a general description of
the project, general expectations of the people invited to participate on the
project, and a statement about why this is important to the business.
Now that the detailed project plan has been developed and the project has
formally been launched, the next step of the project is gathering business
requirements. Once started, change is likely to follow. It is worth taking a
moment now to look at how change can be managed successfully.

If business resources are frequently diverted from the data ware-
house project, it is difﬁcult to believe that the data warehouse is a priority for the
business.
Managing a Successful Project
Getting a project started on the right foot is just the beginning. Obviously, com-
pleting the project tasks well is also important. There are other project-related
characteristics of successful projects that are worth reviewing.
Regardless of the project’s size, there will certainly be surprises. Just about
the only guarantee is that there will be change. Successful project teams handle
change openly and directly. It is easier to set up mechanisms to deal with
issues and change before anything comes up. Many organizations have formal
procedures in place, but they are not used. In addition to regular project
status meetings and published status reports, several other activities must be
performed.
Issue Tracking
Dozens of details need attention. Keeping track of these details helps ensure
that nothing falls through the cracks. To begin with, each major task of
the project will have details that need to be addressed before that task is

Chapter 5
■Setting Up a Successful Project
125
complete. For example, during requirements gathering, it can be helpful for
sample reports and analyses to be provided to the project team. After each
requirements-gathering session, (discussed in Chapter 6), the project team
should compile a list of sample reports to collect. If these are not provided,
then a reminder can be sent. This is not a showstopper for the project, but it is
worth noting. A regular review of task-level issues should be a regular part of
the project work.
In addition to keeping track of details that need attention, there is a set of
bigger issues that also need attention. These are items that impact the project
itself. These often start out as task-level details that grow in signiﬁcance as
they are better understood or they are difﬁcult to resolve. These project-level
issues must also be recorded as they are identiﬁed. These are the issues that
can have an impact on the project resources or timeline. If progress is not
being made on these project-level issues, then the decision-making processes,
discussed earlier, should be used to escalate the problem.
For example, suppose the project team needs assistance coordinating with a
third-party software vendor. The data needed to support the sales effectiveness
calculation is only embedded in a proprietary system that was purchased
directly by the sales organization, not through IT. Arrangements must be
made to get the appropriate vendor resources to work with the project team
to get this data. This type of coordination often requires the intervention of
business managers.
Some organizations have a culture in which it is believed that if there are
any problems, then the team is not doing a good job. In reality, if there are no
issues on the table, then they have not been identiﬁed or they are being kept
under the table. A key characteristic of successful projects is that issues are
identiﬁed, tracked, and discussed. Some of these issues will result in changes
to the project’s scope. The change control process that is described next can be
used to do this.
W A R N I N G
Don’t create an environment in which project teams are afraid to
make changes to their projects. Keep an open mind for monitoring project effort
and schedule. As more is learned, revisions should be made to reﬂect reality. Too
often, teams are penalized for making changes, and are hesitant to do so. This
results in reduced quality and value of the ﬁnal results.
Using Project Change Control
Invoking change control procedures is often viewed as something to do only
as a last resort, and is avoided at all costs by many project teams. This is often
used as a negative measure of the performance of a project team or project
manager. In reality, formal project changes are positive. Change control is a

126
Part II
■The Business Side of Data Warehousing
mechanism to acknowledge what will actually be developed and delivered,
which may not be what was originally planned.
Too often, change control procedures are used only when there are increased
costs for a project. This is indeed the mechanism by which additional funding
is approved, but this is not the only way change control can help. Formal
change control procedures should also be used when there are modiﬁcations
to the scope of a project, or perhaps what data is included, that do not change
the cost or schedule. This is a mechanism to ensure that everyone has a
common understanding of what the project will deliver. These formal project
changes are a natural result of the business and IT team members learning and
adjusting as the project progresses. Successful projects use change control to
manage expectations and to communicate how the project will meet business
objectives.
Discussing Change in Business Terms
Many choices need to be made throughout the life of any data warehouse
project. The biggest decisions are often made when the project charter and
scope are crafted. The dozens of smaller decisions, however, can add up in
surprising ways, and it is unrealistic to expect IT staff members to make most
of these decisions. Clearly, technical decisions should be made by IT—after
all, this is their specialty. However, decisions about what data is important,
the rules to integrate data or determine business calculations, are not their
responsibility. These decisions must be made by the business. In order for
good decisions to be made, everyone involved must understand the question
at hand and the potential ramiﬁcations.
The project team must be able to articulate the question or problem and,
when possible, offer several alternative solutions. The problems need to be
communicated in terms that make sense to the business community. It is
critical that the ramiﬁcations of each alternative also be communicated in
business terms. Several examples are provided in Table 5-1 to demonstrate
how to communicate in business terms and to share the impact of a problem
or question. When possible, this translation should be done prior to meeting
with the business decision-maker.
From a business or management perspective, you may need to take the lead
to ensure that questions are posed in business terms. Keep asking questions
until the problem is clear enough that you feel comfortable making a decision.
As you work with more technical team members, they will learn what you
expect and, over time, be more prepared to clarify their concerns.

of the data warehouse.
Without the sales forecast,

We are supposed to ask

There are ﬁve

Which one should I

Is there a common
deﬁnition and formula for
loss ratio used across the
organization? If so, what is
it? If not, why not? Who

A limited understanding of
such a key business
measure can reduce the
overall value of the data

supported may be reduced
and the actual loss ratio
calculation may not be
implemented in a way that
is beneﬁcial to any group.
The business must retain
control over the deﬁnition
of this critical calculation.
The purchasing data
is too hard to

The IT team needs help
understanding the
complexities of the

requires time from the
purchasing application

manager of the purchasing
group. How can we get
their cooperation in a
timely manner? More time
is needed to understand
what, if any, impact this
may have on the project
budget or schedule.
Without the purchasing
data, the data warehouse
will only be able to
support two-thirds of the
objectives for the project.
Managing Expectations
It can be challenging to keep expectations of the business community and IT
staff aligned with the actual project goals. Documenting the project charter,
project scope, and statement of work are major steps toward keeping those
expectations in line. As discussed earlier, these documents should clearly lay
out the project objectives, the major project tasks, and the deliverables. Once
the project is running, status meetings and published status reports provide
feedback about progress. The project team tracks details that need attention
and issues that must be resolved. Project change control may be invoked to
reﬂect decisions made. These activities are often done within the context of the
project team. However, there are often many others in IT or the business who

Chapter 5
■Setting Up a Successful Project
129
are watching and waiting for project results. While a status report can provide
a summary of what is happening, it may not be enough to keep expectations
aligned with actual project goals.
It can be useful to publish the project scope regularly—even if nothing has
changed. As individuals learn more about the data warehouse and interact
with the project, they form their own ideas about what they think the project
is about. The scope must be the place where these different ideas converge so
that everyone has a common understanding.
Another key strategy for managing expectations is for everyone on the
project team to listen to feedback. If there is a single person or group that
does not seem to understand what is happening, this should be brought to the
project manager’s attention. This can be addressed with a formal brieﬁng or
perhaps through information discussions.
The project has been deﬁned and launched. Techniques for ongoing man-
agement have been presented. Let’s take a look at how the two companies we
are tracking are doing.
In Real Life
The steps described in this chapter are similar to steps deﬁned in other project
management practices. Project planning and management are necessary, but
should not become the primary focus. These are tools to help ensure that the
project is able to run smoothly and meet the stated objectives. The companies
we have been following highlight the extremes of too much or too little project
structure.
Structured Projects with Giant
Giant Company adopted a project methodology years ago and has a strong
project ofﬁce staffed with certiﬁed project managers. These people work
on all types of initiatives, not just systems-related projects. Every project
must complete each step in the methodology without exception. The project
managers do not specialize in any type of project, and the one assigned to the
data warehouse project is new to this ﬁeld.
Giant Company faced challenges when using the corporate project method-
ology for the data warehouse project. All projects across the enterprise are
deﬁned in a stepwise fashion and the business group must set up the project
charter and scope. Unfortunately, for the data warehouse project, this was
completed without input from any of the enterprise data warehouse team
members or the people who will be assigned to the project. While the business
goals are captured, there has not been a sanity check for feasibility. The project

130
Part II
■The Business Side of Data Warehousing
charter and scope were handed to the project manager to deﬁne the project.
A statement of work was not developed, and there was great pressure to just
start working. Development of the project plan immediately identiﬁed a major
problem with the project timeframe and budget; and it turns out that it will be
impossible to complete this project as deﬁned in the charter and scope.
Fortunately, the seasoned project manager was able to see how the charter
and scope deﬁned an impossible project, and called a time-out. Additional
research was done to develop a statement of work to identify the actual work
to be completed on the project. The project charter and scope were also revised.
This new, attainable project was approved and the project was able to move
forward. The project manager also pushed to get changes made to the project
methodology.
Freedom for Creativity at Agile, Inc.
In contrast, the smaller company, Agile, Inc., wants to avoid bureaucracy
and empower everyone to make decisions. Teams can form projects quickly,
execute, and then move on to the next thing. While creativity ﬂows, each
individual project stays focused on one narrow objective. This results in many
individual, point solutions that do not work together. More structure is needed
to create and grow a foundation that will support the organization as a whole.
The ability to move quickly also creates challenges for those individual
projects. Ideas come up and work starts. The actual objectives are clear to
everyone, but no one takes the time to formally document them. The objectives
change frequently, depending on what is happening in any given week. It is
difﬁcult to develop a solution to address a moving target. In addition, what
is needed grows each time the business and systems team members meet.
As more thought goes into what is needed, more data and/or reports are
identiﬁed. With this happening repeatedly, it is almost impossible to know
when the project is done.
A balance must be reached so that there is some structure to ensure the
long-term viability of the project deliverables. This does not mean that project
methods take over and consume everyone’s time and stiﬂe creativity. The
experienced project manager for Agile, Inc., has partnered with the business
championtorestartand runthe datawarehouse projectusingamore structured
approach. The executive and IT sponsors have also agreed to try this approach.
The data warehouse project is put on hold for a couple of weeks to allow time
to formally deﬁne the project: charter, scope, and statement of work. These
key documents will be used throughout the life of the project to help manage
change and maintain an appropriate focus. In order to maintain ﬂexibility, the
change control process is expected to be used, but will help the organization
to understand the impact that each change will have on the project. This new

Chapter 5
■Setting Up a Successful Project
131
structured approach was viewed with skepticism, but is being tolerated due
to management’s support.
Summary
Each organization has its own process for deﬁning, approving, and launching
projects. Regardless of how the steps are labeled, they share a common primary
purpose. Deﬁning the project entails the following:
Proposing the project using the project charter. This includes describing
the project, deﬁning objectives, and estimating the project size (cost and
schedule).
Further detailing the project using the project scope to specify what is
included, what is excluded, and known risk factors.
Identifying the speciﬁc work that will be done in the statement of work.
This includes developing a detailed cost estimate based upon the speciﬁed
work.
Once the project is completely approved, then a detailed project plan
can be developed and resources allocated. The project is kicked-off for the
team members and introduced to the business participants as well. Finally,
successful management includes tracking issues, utilizing change control
procedures, and managing expectations. Now that the project is set up, it is
time to dive in and get to work. The next chapter delves into the challenges of
deﬁning business requirements.


C H A P T E R

Providing Business
Requirements
Now that the project is set up, it is time to get started on the work. The next
step of the project is to collect requirements. The intent is the same as
with any other system design project: to ensure that the ultimate system
serves the intended purpose. However, the requirements needed to design
a data warehouse are distinctly different from those for operational systems.
Operational system requirements are very speciﬁc to ensure that the business
function or transaction is completed accurately. For example, a concrete set of
criteria must be met to complete an online product purchase. Data warehouse
requirements are often general and much more ﬂuid. In a company, there may
be a need to produce a report of the top twenty-ﬁve corporate customers and
their year-to-date purchases, but tomorrow the hot topic needing attention
may be identifying bottlenecks in the distribution channel. These differences
create challenges for projects that use the same approach for a data warehouse
project as for an operational system project.
This can lead to a communication gap between business and technical
staff members when trying to gather requirements for a data warehouse. The
systems community feels like the business does not know what they want
because when asked, ‘‘What report do you want ﬁrst?’’ they get a different
answer each time. Likewise, there is frustration on the part of the business
because requests are made, but IT does not deliver what is really needed.
The systems people really want to deliver something useful. The business
people really do know what they are doing, but numerous ﬂuctuating factors
create new reporting and analytical needs. The challenge for a data warehouse
project is to both support the business today and be able to adapt to meet
future demands too.
This chapter explains what requirements are needed for the DW project and
how to effectively gather them. It will help anyone who participates in the
133

■The Business Side of Data Warehousing
project by providing requirements. It also includes details for the project team.
The chapter is organized to provide the following:
An overview of the different kinds of requirements that are needed for
a successful data warehouse. This section contains information that is
useful for everyone involved with the data warehouse.
Details about what these business requirements look like, including
questions to help ﬁnd them. This section is geared toward those who
are providing the requirements, but is still important for the rest of the
project team to understand.
Techniques for effectively gathering requirements. This section is geared
more speciﬁcally toward the project team members who are responsible
for driving this process.
A description of how to document the requirements. The project team can
use this to help them capture what is collected. This can also help those
providing requirements to understand what documentation to expect.
A review of how to ensure that the project will be able to deliver value to
the organization. This includes a process to help reset the priorities and
scope of the project based upon the requirements that have been collected.
This section is helpful for the project manager, business champion, data
warehouse manager, and other managers supporting this project.
What Requirements Are Needed?
Before getting too far on a data warehouse project, it is important to understand
the following:
Basics of the business itself
Challenges facing the organization
Strategic plans to move the organization forward
This provides the backdrop for designing an environment to support the
business now and into the future. With this basic understanding of the organi-
zation, it is easy to dive directly into deﬁning report layouts.
Having a solid background is useful to help the project team to understand
what is shared during the requirements gathering process.
Peeling Back the Layers of Requirements Gathering
Multiple levels of requirements are needed to build a successful data ware-
house environment. These range from high-level strategic planning to detailed

data analysis. Each level represents a different type of information that is gath-
ered. Figure 6-1 shows the different layers, each progressively more detailed.

A brief description of each of these layers follows:
Strategic requirements provide insight into the vision and overall goals
of the organization. Strategic requirements should focus on the big picture
and look at the entire enterprise. These requirements need to be at a high
level of detail. These are used to help deﬁne the charter and scope of
the data warehouse project. More information can be found in the next
section about strategic requirements.
The next levels of requirements focus on the areas deﬁned by the project
charter and scope. The process described in this chapter helps identify the
following:
Broad business themes include business goals and challenges. These are
the issues and topics that the business group is working on. There may be
too many of these broad business requirements to tackle at once. Select
the most critical areas for further research and requirements gathering.

136
Part II
■The Business Side of Data Warehousing
Business analyses are often mentioned speciﬁcally during the interview
process. These include analyses that are currently performed on a regular
basis, samples of recent ad hoc analyses, and analyses that cannot be
completed in the current environment. Business themes can be identiﬁed
by looking at the underlying purpose of a business analysis. The goal of
identifying business analyses is not to compile a report inventory, but
rather to determine why a report is useful.
Business data is mentioned in the interview to support reporting require-
ments and analyses. This is the type of data needed, not the speciﬁc ﬁle
or column name.
The broad business requirements, business analyses, and business data are
typically gathered at the same time through interviews. The interview content
is analyzed to net out each of these types of requirements. The next major
section of this chapter, ‘‘Providing Business Requirements,’’ explains these
three levels in great detail.
Before jumping into more detailed requirements gathering or design work,
it is important to take a moment to determine whether the results of the
requirements gathering process so far are aligned with the project charter and
scope. If not, this is the opportunity to set new priorities and then modify the
project charter and scope as necessary. Then, with conﬁrmation of the origi-
nal project scope or a revised project scope, more detailed requirements can be
gathered. These are typically done in later stages of a data warehouse project,
but are included here to show a complete picture of all the requirements.
Speciﬁc reports, calculations, and screens that will be part of the solution
must be deﬁned to support the business analyses speciﬁed earlier. Deﬁ-
nition of calculations begins during the data modeling process, which is
described in Chapter 7. Speciﬁc reports, analyses, and screens are deﬁned
as part of the data delivery process detailed in Chapter 11.
Actual data sources are now selected to be the source for the business data
that must be included, as deﬁned by the business analyses. More detailed
analysis of the data content is also needed, as discussed in Chapter 8.
Business rules will need to be deﬁned for the process that will extract,
transform, and load the data into the database. Chapter 10 provides more
details about developing the ETL process.
All of these requirements must be collected for the ﬁrst data warehouse
project. The project charter and scope will help determine the group of people
needed to provide requirements input. The project scoping and prioritization
step will further narrow the focus for this project. Once the initial data
warehouse is built, then the process begins again. Subsequent projects do not
need to start over, but can conﬁrm whether the broad business themes, business
analyses, and business data are still relevant. Any additional requirements can

Chapter 6
■Providing Business Requirements
137
be added at this time. The remaining business requirements can be prioritized
again, to determine what is to be included in subsequent projects to expand
the data warehouse.
This same approach can be applied to deﬁning the requirements for an entire
data warehouse program or for a single data warehouse project. The only
difference would be the breadth of the audience providing the requirements.
This approach helps organizations to look beyond the immediate need for a
speciﬁc report or type of data.
Some organizations balk at taking the time to gather and document business
requirements in this manner, preferring to jump directly to deﬁning report
layouts and screens. Without the proper business context and rationale behind
the reports, however, the long-term value of the data warehouse can be limited.
Focusing only on reports causes the project team to work on delivering
only the data needed to create those reports. It is easy to overlook other
data that is stored with the speciﬁc data needed for the reports. Often this
other data could be included with minimal added effort or cost. Because the
business environment changes constantly, the types of reports and analyses
must also change. The requirements gathering process detailed here can help
organizations to be prepared to adapt to these changes.
Who Provides Input?
The project charter and scope help to determine who should be interviewed.
Representatives from the groups that are involved with or support the business
goals should be included. More details about how to determine who will be
interviewed are included later in this chapter. It is important to remember that
while the charter and scope help determine the people to interview, they should
not limit the topics of discussion. The process of gathering requirements may
show that the most important area needing support by the data warehouse is
not in the current project scope. The last part of this chapter provides ideas for
what to do in those situations.
Who Gathers the Requirements?
The work to gather these business requirements is typically done by a busi-
ness analyst, business systems analyst, and/or the data modeler. The people
ﬁlling these roles form the core group that is responsible for conducting the
interviews, analysis, and interpretation of the input and documentation of
these ﬁndings. Because the requirements gathering process is focused on the
business and does not address technology, it may be tempting to perform
this task strictly as a business activity. However, because the requirements
are used to drive the design, it is important to include more technical data
warehouse team representatives.

138
Part II
■The Business Side of Data Warehousing
The real art of data warehousing is melding together the business vision
with the reality of the data you actually have. This requires the systems
representatives to be part of the requirements gathering process too. This
gives them the background and understanding of the business they need in
order to make sound decisions during the design stage.
It does not matter who owns the budget for this work—a team of people
who represent both the business and systems perspectives must complete the
work. Again, partnership is key here.
Now with a basic overview of what kinds of requirements are needed, it
is time get into more detail. The next section describes the ﬁrst three levels
of requirements and is intended to help those who are expected to provide
business requirements to the data warehouse team.
Providing Business Requirements
This section provides more details about the business requirements that need
to be collected. It will help anyone who is providing input to understand
what the project team is looking for. While these are divided here to aid in
understanding, often the requirements are provided all together, interwoven
throughout an interview session.
Strategic Requirements
To be able to put together strategies and plans, interview sessions need to
stay at a high conceptual level. These requirements need to highlight the
biggest areas of need for data. This includes identiﬁcation of data problems
and concerns, such as the lack of timely reporting of data or questionable
data accuracy. Any data-related concerns need to be tied to business impact.
For example, without accurate sales ﬁgures, your account reviews are not
effective. The tie into the business is critical. This will help highlight the areas
where data warehousing can best help. After getting a good overview of the
general requirements of the business, speciﬁc trouble areas can be explored.
Executives and senior management typically provide strategic requirements.
Keep in mind that the purpose is to gather enough details to be able to
develop a strategic plan to address the information needs of the organization.
Perhaps the purpose is to gather enough information to be able to propose a
data warehouse project itself. Some questions that can help identify strategic
requirements include the following:
Where do you see the organization in ﬁve years?
What are the goals for the next year?

Chapter 6
■Providing Business Requirements
139
How do you measure progress toward these goals?
What will keep you from reaching those goals?
How is information used today?
What are your biggest concerns about data today?
What do you need to be able to do in the future?
What else should we be aware of?
What does this project need to do for you to consider it a success?
SAMPLE STRATEGIC REQUIREMENT
Consistent Management Reporting
Currently, each department of the organization determines its own
performance goals and tracks its performance to these goals. This is what is
reported to enterprise management. Because these are all developed
separately, there is no common view of the entire organization. There is a need
to deﬁne ways to measure performance across the company and to ensure that
these are reported to upper management consistently.
Business Integration and Efﬁciency
In order to achieve peak efﬁciency in running the business, there needs to be
great coordination and cooperation across the organization. This requires
increased communication between different groups across the entire
enterprise. Several business integration efforts are currently underway that
should help the organization to better focus on the mission. Data is at the heart
of enabling effective management of the business from the top down.
If strategic requirements were not collected prior to a speciﬁc data warehouse
project, it is worth taking the time to do so now. This strategic viewpoint can
help put the rest of the requirements into the proper context.
The following types of requirements are gleaned from interview sessions
with a wide range of representatives from the business community. Each
session typically yields insight into broad business requirements, business
analyses, and needed business data. The next major section of this chapter
provides more detail about selecting who to interview and how to run the
sessions. Note that the requirements are not usually presented in a linear
fashion as described below. Rather, the discussion will ﬂow back and forth.

140
Part II
■The Business Side of Data Warehousing
Some speciﬁc questions are provided to ensure that each is covered sufﬁciently
during the entire interview session.
Broad Business Requirements
This is the basic bread-and-butter content that is needed as the foundation for
design and development of the data warehouse. It is still too soon to begin
crawling through individual reports, or tables and columns of data. A basic
understanding of the business function itself is needed ﬁrst. Then, explore with
the interview group the challenges facing their part of the organization, how
success is measured, and what problems the group is facing. This discussion
should also cover what reporting and analytical needs exist. Some questions
that can help identify these broad requirements include the following:
What are your primary business objectives?
How is your performance measured and how often?
What are the biggest business issues facing your group today?
How are you planning to address these issues?
How could better information assist you?
What is the potential impact of addressing this problem?
What is the risk of not addressing this problem?
What is the competitive environment like for your organization?
How quickly is the marketplace changing?
How is the company responding to these changes?
What else would you like to be able to do?
Are there any other things that the project team should know about that
could have an impact on the project?
SAMPLE BUSINESS THEMES
Customer Service
As a provider of high-value products, superior customer service is critical to
overall success of the company. The ability to identify trends in customer
complaints, both the frequency and the severity, is important. Early
identiﬁcation of a problem would enable the organization to take action to
correct the problem and avoid any additional issues.
(continued)

Chapter 6
■Providing Business Requirements
141
SAMPLE BUSINESS THEMES (continued)
Business Performance Monitoring
Monitoring business performance measures on a consistent/timely basis at a
detailed product level is very difﬁcult and time consuming today. This is largely
due to the complexity of the industry and the breadth of products that are
offered. There is a need to analyze the business at a high level and seamlessly
drill to lower levels of detail to identify issues and anomalies as they are
uncovered. This requires data access to be ﬂexible enough to support many
different perspectives.
Monitoring actual performance against annual goals set forth in the business
plan on a monthly basis is essential. While the ofﬁcial performance reviews
occur monthly, it is important to have access to the data more frequently.
A month-to-date capability would enable the organization to identify what is
needed to meet that month’s goals, while there is still time to make adjustments.
Supplier Performance Analysis
It is important to be able to monitor and measure the performance of each of
the suppliers. Speciﬁc performance expectations are part of each supplier
contract, so it is important to be able to see which suppliers are meeting those
goals. There are quarterly supplier reviews that require a complete picture of
the company’s business with that supplier. This includes their on-time delivery
rate, the quality of the products, responsiveness to problems, and how quickly
the company pays their invoices. Because this information comes from multiple
locations, this is currently a very time-consuming process. The goal would be
for this information to be available more often, and perhaps even published via
a web interface for each supplier.
Proﬁtability Analysis
The ability to understand the company’s proﬁtability is critical. Historically, this
has been determined at a high level. However, there has been limited ability to
drill down to see which areas of the business are contributing to the proﬁ-
tability. It is important to be able to understand both the areas of biggest
growth and the problem areas. If the supporting detail were available, then
each product line would be scrutinized and appropriate strategies developed to
improve proﬁtability.
(When working with a nonproﬁt or government agency this is often
expressed as ﬁscal responsibility. There is still a proﬁtability goal—it just
happens to be zero. The same types of analyses and tracking need to be done.)

142
Part II
■The Business Side of Data Warehousing
In addition to general business themes, data-related issues often arise. These
are often the impetus behind building a data warehouse. These are important
and should be noted, but are not sufﬁcient alone. The other business challenges
facing the organization are what provide the project team with what is needed
to build a successful, sustainable data warehouse.
SAMPLE DATA-RELATED BUSINESS THEMES
Data Accuracy
There are concerns about the accuracy of data that is used for decision-making.
There are some issues related to how data is captured. More work is needed to
speciﬁcally identify these problems and to develop recommendations to
tighten controls at the point of data entry. In other cases, errors can be
introduced during the processes of manually extracting and integrating data
from multiple sources. Because this is often done for each analysis, there is
also the possibility for variations to occur in handling the data during this
manual process. As a result of the data quality concerns, the organization must
spend a signiﬁcant amount of time auditing and verifying the accuracy of
information to be used in reports and analysis.
Single Source of Data
A complete integrated source of data is needed to support analysis across the
organization. Currently, data that needs to be integrated is often dispersed
throughout the company. The different data must be located and then
integrated. This is a difﬁcult, time-consuming, and error-prone process.
Development of a single integrated database could serve as the consolidation
point for all divisional systems. A key to successful implementation of a single
database is developing and maintaining consistent deﬁnitions of each data
element. This would result in a one-time effort required to integrate and clean
the data. The resulting database could then be made available to everyone. The
single database would help ensure consistency of answers.
Flexible Data Access
Flexible data access is critical to meeting the current and future demands on
the company. The current storage methods and data access tools are difﬁcult to
use and require a great deal of technical expertise and knowledge about where
the data is physically located. Only a limited number of people are able to
access the data directly. Signiﬁcant cost and lengthy turnaround times often
result from this method for accessing data.

SAMPLE DATA-RELATED BUSINESS THEMES (continued)
The company needs to have a mechanism in place to allow ﬂexible data
access to those requiring it, without the need for programming. The data access
mechanism should provide an easy to use interface to run pre-deﬁned reports,
have the ability to drill down and change parameters, and easily create new
reports. A user should be able to reﬁne the parameters at will, without
programming or signiﬁcant system changes. This would enable more people to
access the data and improve the efﬁciency of servicing requests. Ideally,
requesters should be able to answer simple questions themselves.
External Data Access
There is a need to provide data to people outside of the company. This includes
customers and vendors. As data is made available to a wider audience, it is
important to ensure that it is secure. Changes cannot be made to the data in
the data warehouse. All modiﬁcations must ﬂow through proper channels. In
addition, access must be provided in a structured manner that minimizes the
possibility of users pulling data in ways that are not statistically valid.
In addition to discussions about the business, general types of analyses and
speciﬁc analyses are usually mentioned.
Business Analyses
Depending on the audience, there may also be discussion about analyses that
are currently performed. The key is to be able to understand why these are
done and what happens with the results. The focus should always be on
the ﬁnal result, not the intermediate steps. Frustration and pain are often
expressed about how difﬁcult or how long it takes to get data or a report.
This is a major reason why the data warehouse project is started. It is also
useful to be able to tie a speciﬁc business analysis to a broad business theme
discussed above. This helps to clarify the underlying purpose for performing
the analysis.
It may be easier to begin a discussion about business analyses and then
progress to the rationale behind it. In other cases, the business challenge itself
may be mentioned ﬁrst, and then analyses that are performed to address this
situation can be discussed. Questions that can help uncover business analyses
include the following:
What reports do you rely on to make decisions?
Do you do anything more with the reports to make them more useful? If
so, what else is done? Is other data added?
What analyses do you perform on a regular basis?

144
Part II
■The Business Side of Data Warehousing
Why is this important to the business?
How does the analysis support the decision-making process?
Do other groups receive the results of these analyses?
What other analyses would you like to perform?
Describe the types of requests that you have for ad hoc reports or analyses.
How do you access data for reporting and analysis today? What recom-
mendations do you have to improve data access?
How long does it take to perform these analyses?
What percentage of the time is spent gathering data? Reconciling data?
Performing analysis?
Do you have enough time to research additional questions?
If all of the data issues were resolved and everything were at your ﬁnger-
tips, what would you do?
SAMPLE BUSINESS ANALYSES
The following analyses help support the business theme to improve
marketing effectiveness.
Promotion Planning
Study the past performance of other similar promotions. Develop a plan,
including the budget, target audience, promotion format, and the desired
response rate, increase in sales, or other result.
Promotion Performance Tracking
Once the promotion has been launched, it is important to track how things are
progressing. For a multi-week promotion, detailed, daily progress is needed to
ensure that the promotion is running smoothly across the country. Actual sales
need to be tracked and compared to the prior year and the pre-promotion
baseline. This enables adjustments to be made as necessary during the
promotion period.
(continued)

Chapter 6
■Providing Business Requirements
145
SAMPLE BUSINESS ANALYSES (continued)
Promotion Financial Results
While most of the analyses are focused on the actual execution of the
promotion itself, there is also a need to track the ﬁnancial impact. This means
that the promotion budget must be compared to actual expenditures. This is
important to ensure that a promotion is effective. Some promotions may get a
stellar response from the marketplace, but the cost to execute the promotion
may outweigh the increased proﬁt. If the objective of the promotion was to
improve brand loyalty, it may still be successful. If the object of the promotion
was to increase revenue and proﬁt by .05%, then this may not have been a
successful promotion.
Post Promotion Analysis
After the promotion is completed, the full results need to be understood. This
includes a high-level perspective and details by market, store, and product. This
is similar to tracking the performance during a promotion, but it also needs to
include a summary of the results.
T I P
When providing requirements, consider the ﬁnal result that you need. This is
often several steps beyond receiving an existing report. Reports are often manip-
ulated manually, merged together, and additional calculations performed. This
ultimate result is really what is needed. If you could start here, what else would
you want to do?
Also during the interview session, the discussion will touch upon a variety
of different types of data—both data that is used currently and data that is
needed but may not be available.
Business Data Requirements
Again, in subsequent stages of the project, there will be plenty of time spent
looking at individual data elements, speciﬁc reports, and the business rules
for processing the data. At this point of the project, it is most important to
get a complete picture of all of the data that would be useful to the business
community. This is a time for the business representatives to share the realities
of the data used regularly and to be able to share a vision about other data that

146
Part II
■The Business Side of Data Warehousing
would valuable, if available. Some questions that can help identify the types
of data that are needed include the following:
What are the primary types of data that you use regularly?
How do you get this data today?
Are you able to access the data yourself? If not, why not? If so, how?
What level of detail do you use? Is this sufﬁcient?
How much history is needed to support your analyses?
How often does the data need to be refreshed?
What other data would you like to be able to use?
Is this data captured anywhere? If so, who would know more about this?
Does this data have any special security or conﬁdentiality requirements
that must be considered?
SAMPLE BUSINESS DATA REQUIREMENTS
General Ledger
Core ﬁnancial data is needed from the general ledger, including any manual
journal entries to serve as the foundation for ﬁnancial analysis.
Accounts Receivable
Details about the ﬁnancial accounts receivables are needed to identify and
track trends in how customers make payments. This is also needed to identify
characteristics of accounts that can predict late payments.
Accounts Payable
Data about what actual payments are made for each claim is needed. This
includes both claim payments and expense payments.
Revenue Forecast
Information about the forecasted revenue for the coming year is needed. The
forecast must be integrated with actual results to determine performance.
(continued)

Chapter 6
■Providing Business Requirements
147
SAMPLE BUSINESS DATA REQUIREMENTS (continued)
Then, the underlying details can be studied to determine what is driving any
variations.
Vendor proﬁles
Information about vendors beyond basic contact information is needed. This
includes which products they can provide, historical information about what
has been purchased from them before, and details regarding reliability and
quality.
T I P
If a person can provide speciﬁc ﬁle and ﬁeld names of the data while trying
to identify business data that is needed, you are not talking to the right person. Try
to identify who receives that data. The recipient of the data is likely to be the true
business decision maker.
The bulk of the discussion should be focused on the business themes,
analyses, and business data. There is also a need to understand the current
technical environment in more depth.
Systems and Technical Requirements
While most of the emphasis is on business requirements, it is also useful to
touch base with the people who are currently responsible for the care and
feeding of the primary source systems that are likely to be loaded initially.
This is where the systems community has the opportunity to share their
requirements for the data warehouse. This also provides the project team with
the chance to get a realistic perspective of the data that is currently used. This
insight into the source systems or existing reporting environments can help
the data warehouse project team to better understand the effort needed to
include this data in the data warehouse.
The information that is discovered during a systems interview should be
included with all of the other requirements. Most of what is discussed will
be used to ﬂesh out the business data requirements sections. Questions that
are useful to discover systems details include the following:
What systems collect and maintain this type of data?
What level of detail is collected?
How much historical data is available?
How is the data structured?

148
Part II
■The Business Side of Data Warehousing
What type of documentation exists for this data? Do the data elements
have up-to-date deﬁnitions?
How accurate is this data?
Are there any known peculiarities with this source of data? If so, please
describe them.
How do the candidate source systems interact with each other?
Does the data integrate easily?
Describe the current user reporting and analysis environment.
There may also be requirements that should be included in the business
themes documentation. These are themes that represent what the IT organi-
zation needs to effectively build and manage the data warehouse. These are
requirements that the data warehouse project may need to address. Often,
IT management identiﬁes these needs. The same questions used for other
business groups can be used to determine IT business requirements.
SAMPLE IT BUSINESS REQUIREMENTS
System Usage and Tracking
In order to better support the business community, it is important to be able to
track the percentage of time that applications are available for internal use and
for external use. It is also helpful to track who is using which systems, how
often, and for how long. This helps the systems staff to ensure appropriate
capacity, address performance issues, and identify applications that are not
providing value. If an application is not being used, that typically indicates that
there is a problem. Perhaps the application is too difﬁcult to use, or the
performance is not acceptable, or the functionality no longer meets the needs
of that group. This becomes even more critical as applications are released to
external users, such as customers and vendors. This information is needed
to enable the systems community to develop and support valuable business
applications.
Education
The entire organization has already begun to learn about information
management and data warehousing concepts. This education must continue
and be at an appropriate level of detail for each audience. These concepts need
to be understood to help integrate them into day-to-day work, set priorities,
(continued)

Chapter 6
■Providing Business Requirements
149
SAMPLE IT BUSINESS REQUIREMENTS (continued)
and manage expectations. Value will not be realized from the investment in
data warehousing if education is not provided regarding its use.
Support
The current problem tracking and support mechanisms need to be expanded to
include the data warehouse. New help desk procedures must be developed to
send data warehouse problems to the appropriate people for resolution.
People with knowledge about business analysis, the data, and the technical
workings of the data warehouse must be part of the team to effectively support
the organization.
So far in this section, the different types of requirements have been laid out.
As mentioned earlier, requirements are rarely shared in this concise manner.
Discussion can be prompted using the questions previously listed. Not a lot
of work is necessary to prepare to be interviewed, but some thought ahead of
time is useful. The next section shares a few ideas about how to get ready.
Communicating What You Really Need
Many people are concerned about what they need to do to get ready for an
interview. The primary preparation is doing your job, but there are a few other
things that you could do in advance that would make the interview session
more productive. Take a moment to step back to think about what you do on
a regular basis:
What reports or analyses do you create or use on a daily, weekly or quar-
terly basis?
What things do you need to do for annual processes such as budgeting?
How smoothly do these processes run?
Do you run out of time before you can dig just a little deeper to explain
or understand an unusual result?
If you had the time, what else would you do?
As you go through your work, try to think about why you do what you do.
Too often, we get so bogged down with daily challenges that we don’t take
the time to ask ourselves how we could do something better. It may be helpful

150
Part II
■The Business Side of Data Warehousing
to jot down any ideas that you have now, so that you remember to share
them during the session. Then, take this one step further and allow yourself to
dream. What would a perfect world look like to help you make decisions?
Too often, the ﬁrst thing that comes to mind is to have all of the data
available as soon as possible. Of course, because there is a cost associated
with preparing, loading, and maintaining data, this is not feasible. Therefore,
consider what data would help you the most. Again, try not to focus on what is
wrong with the data today, but think about what you are trying to accomplish.
Then let the team track down and address problems with the data.
What Else Would Help the Project Team?
As you participate in the requirements gathering process, it would be helpful
for you to understand what the project team is hoping to glean from these
sessions. As discussed earlier, there is a need to understand the business itself,
what functions are performed, and how information is used today. The team is
also looking for speciﬁc clues that will help drive the next steps of the project.
The discussions will highlight the areas that are most important to the busi-
ness and identify problem areas that need more research. The project team is
not expecting to ﬁnd all of the answers up front, simply to identify who and
where to go to next.
There are also other speciﬁc things that the project team will be looking
for. The team will sort through all that is shared to distill the essence of what
you really need. Remember that the team represents both the business and the
technical perspectives. Many clues are provided during an interview session
that shed light on how the data should be organized to support business
needs. These are not communicated in data modeling terms, but the details
are mentioned. For example, an interviewee may state, ‘‘I need to track sales
performance by employee, by product line, by individual product, by month
and week, by sales division, and by customer state.’’
Two different things can be gleaned from such a statement. First, the
business needs to track sales performance. Further questions may determine
that sales performance is measured by unit sales, dollar sales, and unit sales
as a percentage of quota. The project team should recognize these as part
of a dimensional model, called facts. Every word mentioned after ‘‘by’’ is
a characteristic that is used for reporting. In this case, there is a need for
employee, product, customer, and date data. Second, for products, the speciﬁc
attributes of product line and product itself were mentioned. These are used to
group the sales performance measures and/or to select a subset of data to look
at. These are also clues to help design the dimensional model. The project team
should recognize these characteristics as belonging in a dimension. Chapter 7
provides details about dimensional modeling.

Chapter 6
■Providing Business Requirements
151
RUNNING THE BUSINESS VS. MANAGING THE BUSINESS
A basic concept that you must keep in mind is the difference between what is
needed to run the business versus what is needed to manage the business.
Decisions made to run the business are very tactical in nature and can be put
into place immediately. For example, if an organization is currently placing too
many calls on hold, then perhaps all customer service representatives who are
on break should get back to the phones to help out.
Decisions that require historical trending and result in decisions that will
take time to implement are typically used to manage the business. For
example, a property and casualty insurance company must build and present a
business case to a speciﬁc state’s insurance board in order to change rates.
When gathering requirements for a data warehouse, it is important to focus on
those things that can help manage the business, rather than requirements that
need to be addressed by the operational systems.
If there is currently a lack of reporting and analytical capabilities, it is harder
to imagine what would be helpful to manage the business. The requirements
that are communicated tend to revolve around data-related problems with
running the business. These are often requirements for ﬁxes or enhancements
to the current operational application systems. These requirements should be
noted and shared with the IT team that supports that operational system. Later,
the discussion can return to explore what is needed to help manage the
business.
Data Integration Challenges
One of the most frustrating things for the business community is trying to use
data from different sources for a single report or analysis. Often these systems
were not designed to work together, and do not contain a speciﬁc data element
that can be directly linked between these sources. Most likely, someone has
an understanding of these sources and probably is performing this integration
manually. This is surely the case if this data shows up on a current report. The
project team wants to learn about where integration challenges exist and also
who has the most experience or knowledge about how this is accomplished
today. This is discovered by asking, ‘‘Who would you go to if you needed this
to be done?’’ This may lead to another person, and perhaps yet another. Each
person in the chain generally understands his or her own piece. The project
team will work with these people to understand the current business rules
used to integrate the data. This is used to help deﬁne the business rules for the
ETL system to prepare the data for analytic use.
Assess Organizational Motivation
The project team can also get a good idea about biases and willingness to
help the data warehouse project during the interview process. Some groups

152
Part II
■The Business Side of Data Warehousing
may be excited and highly motivated to help get the data warehouse built.
Other groups may be more reserved and have serious doubts. In some cases,
legitimate issues are raised. The sooner the team is aware of potential problems
the better. In other cases, concerns may be due to a lack of understanding
of the project, about data warehousing in general, or uncertainty about the
project’s impact on the work environment. The project team may need to take
speciﬁc actions to address concerns in either case.
If a group has been starved for data, it may be necessary to spend more
time educating and showing demonstrations. This may be more useful closer
to delivery of the completed data warehouse. If this group is needed to help
the design and development of the data warehouse, then the education must
happen soon so that they can be more effective throughout the life of the
project.
Complete Picture of the Data
Get a comprehensive list of the business data that is needed. This needs to
include a description of the data, and if this is already being captured, then
note the actual name of the system. Any primary concerns and issues with this
as a data source should also be documented here. This should include data
from major operational systems, information data sources, and data that is not
currently being captured. The purpose is to get a broad view of all the data
that would be useful. This is not a commitment that this project will address
all of these sources, but it does acknowledge the need.
What If No One Is Asking?
If there is a data warehouse project in process, and no one is talking to any-
one in the business community, then this is a major problem. Someone from
the business community must be proactive and get involved. This could be the
business champion, a strong business manager, or perhaps the executive spon-
sor. While this may be disruptive to the current project, business involvement
now will save time and money later. This may also mean the difference
between success and failure.
Start by looking at the project scope and objectives. Review where the
project is in the life cycle. Is it just starting, in the middle of developing the
staging processes, or just about to be deployed? Other business groups may
be participating, but for some reason your group was excluded. This may be
due to project scope or it may simply be an oversight.
It is never too late for the business and IT groups to begin working closely
together. Make an honest assessment of what you have and where you are as
an organization. Even when you already have a data mart in production, it is
still useful to take stock of what you have. Then, speciﬁc plans can be made to
move the data warehouse forward.

Practical Techniques for Gathering Requirements
This section discusses the techniques for preparing for, conducting, and
documenting the ﬁndings from interview sessions. While there are other
approaches to gather requirements, including facilitated sessions, prototyping,
and report analysis, only the interviewing technique is covered in detail here.
These other techniques can help reﬁne requirements and provide more detail
after the interviews have been conducted. However, as long as the business
requirements are collected, the process to get there should not be an issue.
The information here is targeted to help those project team members who
are responsible for gathering the requirements. This may be interesting to
others who will provide input, but it could be skipped otherwise. If so, start
reading again with the section ‘‘Putting the Pieces Together’’ to understand
what happens next.
Interview Session Characteristics
The requirements gathering process is focused on the business in general, so
the sessions take the form of a dialogue, not technical speciﬁcations. This is
not a process of reviewing screens, or a list of data elements. Because this
is focused on gaining an understanding of the business itself, the easiest and
most effective format is to conduct interview sessions. Most of the sessions
are with small groups, but some are with individuals. The interviews are run
by the lead business analyst or the dimensional modeler. A business systems
analyst may also be able to run the sessions.
Individual Interviews
Based upon the seniority and availability of the person to be interviewed, it
may be most appropriate to conduct an individual session. This is usually
the most effective format for executives and senior management. The optimal
amount of time is an hour, but most high-level people can clearly and concisely
share their thoughts in a half hour.
Group Interviews
To accommodate a larger number of people, without an excessive number
of sessions, other members of the business community can be interviewed in
small groups. The group should be no larger than ﬁve individuals and last
about two hours. A larger group makes it more difﬁcult for each person’s
perspective to be heard. The group should be comprised of people with a
common set of interests. If each person in the group represents a completely
different business function, then each may lose interest while the others are
taking their turn. This leaves the door open for viewing cell phones and other
personal devices, which in turn can pull that person from the room.

154
Part II
■The Business Side of Data Warehousing
Another thing to be aware of is not mixing levels of management within a
single group. Make sure that everyone in a session is at the same peer level. It
can be difﬁcult for people to share openly if their boss and their boss’s boss are
present during the session. The second-level managers do not have a problem
because their most critical report shows up every Monday morning in their
e-mail. However, it may take the business analyst all weekend to pull the data
and prepare that report for delivery.
N O T E
There are often immediate beneﬁts to having a group of key individuals
together for this type of session. For example, one person may share a frustration
about the inability to get to a speciﬁc set of data, and another person will speak
up that such information is immediately available. Usually, there are still challen-
ges that need to be addressed, but sometimes an immediate need can be met,
even if it is in a manual fashion.
Project Team Participation
There may be multiple representativesfrom the project team in attendance. The
more who can participate in the process, the better. However, be sensitive to
the total number of people in the session; try not to overwhelm the interviewees
with too many team members. If the project team is large, consider taking
turns. This enables each person on the project team to have the opportunity
to learn how the sessions are conducted and hear ﬁrsthand what is being
shared. Observing other skilled interviewers is one of the best ways to develop
interviewing skills. It is also a good idea to let the interviewees know in
advance the number of team members who will be in the session, especially
for the individual interviews.
T I P
One person should be designated as the lead interviewer. One person
should be designated to take notes. All others are silent observers. This enables
the session leader to follow a complete train of thought without interruption.
Another beneﬁt to having other team members sit in on the sessions is
the opportunity to meet these critical business participants. Someone may
have worked for years in IT without having met these important business
representatives.
Interview Tips
Other logistical details can improve the effectiveness of the interview process,
including the following:
Send out invitations, perhaps even from the executive business sponsor.
Draft a list of potential questions to initiate discussion.

Chapter 6
■Providing Business Requirements
155
Make sure that you know where the interview will take place, and be
early.
Schedule the sessions at the interviewee’s location.
Don’t schedule too many interviews in a single day. Limit the interviews
to two or three a day Too many sessions begin to blur together—what
was asked and who shared what.
Take the time to review your notes immediately following the interview.
Number and label each page. Fill in blanks and ﬁnish writing out
abbreviated notes and ideas that you rushed to get down during the
meeting. Do this immediately; otherwise, you won’t remember after the
next session.
The project team members should regroup after each session. Share the
key points that were made. Did these reinforce what was expected or
were there any surprises? Discuss what could be improved for running
subsequent sessions.
Be sure to leave time between sessions to allow for coffee, lunch, and
traveling to the next session.
Make a list of any follow-up that is required from this meeting, such
as questions that need to be answered or ideas to better reach these
individuals. This may be to forward the project scope or to schedule a
brieﬁng to share the enterprise data warehouse strategy.
Send a thank-you note after the session to each interviewee.
With the overall characteristics of the interviews as background, it is time
to look at who should be interviewed.
Who Needs to Be Included?
Consider carefully who should be included in the requirements gathering
process. It needs to be a cross section of the business community. Strong
representation from the primary target audience is critical. One also needs to
spend time with the other groups that interact and interface with the core
audience, in addition to spending time with the representatives from the next
areas that will be included in the data warehouse environment.
The project team can usually come up with an initial list of candidates to
be interviewed. This must be reviewed with the data warehouse manager
and the business champion. Once the list is reﬁned, the executive business
sponsor should give ﬁnal approval. Sometimes critical people who should be
included are considered unapproachable by the project team. Typically, these
are higher-level executives to whom the project team does not generally have

156
Part II
■The Business Side of Data Warehousing
access. This is where the sponsor must ensure that all of the appropriate people
are included.
T I P
Make this ‘‘invitation’’ to be included in the process sound like a privilege.
When people see that it is not a waste of time, others may wish to be included too.
Look for those who can truly provide useful content. Often this is from
people who have been around for a long time, but it is also worthwhile to
meet with people who are relatively new as well. New people understand the
pain of lacking the secret handshakes needed to get reports and data. These
people also have the beneﬁt of other experiences and may have ideas about
what could be done, while people who have been around for a long time may
not have been exposed to these other ideas.
It is also important to look for people who need to be included for political
reasons. If you are interviewing three of four vice presidents, then you should
probably touch base with the fourth vice president just to make sure all the
perspectives are covered and no feelings are bruised.
Be sure to adjust as you go. During the interview process, additional people
may be identiﬁed who should be interviewed also. Take the time to include
them in the process. When requirements session are done well, people who
have been resistant in the past suddenly clamor to be included. They want to
make sure that their perspective is accurately represented.
T I P
In general, 8–12 interview sessions tend to be sufﬁcient. This is a mix of
individual and group sessions. More sessions results in repeated content and
extends the time required for documentation. Fewer sessions may not provide a
broad enough base to ensure ﬂexibility for future growth.
Setting a Good Example
As a business manager or sponsor, your attitude toward requirements gath-
ering has a big impact on other participants and the attitude of the entire
organization. If you are willing to be interviewed (taking your ‘‘immunization
shot’’ ﬁrst to prove that it really does not hurt!), then others will see that it is
important to you and, it is hoped, how it will be beneﬁcial to the organization.
N O T E
This is the ﬁrst time that business in general has the opportunity to get
involved. This is important to ensure that what is built meets the needs of the
organization. This is the ﬁrst step to building a relationship between team mem-
bers and key individuals from the business community. This will be helpful when
further information is needed in the future. The project team will know who the
players are (and vice versa) and will have a face to go with a name or position.

Chapter 6
■Providing Business Requirements
157
Preparing for Interview Sessions
Background information should be provided to the IT team whether it is
an internal team or external consultants. It is easy to justify spending time
providing background information when you bring in an external consultant.
This is required to bring the consultant up to speed. You should not assume
that long-time employees have a good understanding of the business.
Because many organizations have already made some attempt to build
a data warehouse, employees have probably already been asked for their
requirements, multiple times. The people who need to provide input play
critical roles in the organization and their time is at a premium. The project
team can get ready by doing the following:
Read the annual report to understand strategic objectives.
Read everything you can about any prior data warehouse attempts and
other related efforts.
Arrange for the interview team to get a solid background on the business.
The business analyst on the team can often provide this.
Make sure you know who you are interviewing, what their role is, and
how long they have been in that position.
Identify interviews where the audience has a negative attitude toward
data warehousing. Be ready to listen to their concerns and share how this
project will overcome prior challenges. Be ready to solicit their ideas too.
Conduct a project launch or kick-off session with everyone who will be
interviewed. This was discussed in Chapter 5.
A well-prepared interview team can ensure that the sessions run smoothly.
Conducting the Interview Sessions
The time has come to talk to the business representatives. The team is prepared.
Everyone who was invited to the session has arrived. Begin with a round of
introductions. All members of the meeting should share their name, title, and
what role they assume on the project or in the business. Be sure to share what
roles (lead interviewer, note taker, and/or observer) each of the team members
is ﬁlling for this session. Then, have each interviewee share an overview of
his or her job responsibilities. Once the basics are covered, you can get started
with the heart of the session. Start with broad, open-ended questions.
Capturing Content: Notes vs. Tapes
These sessions are valuable to the entire team, not necessarily just those
who were able to attend the meeting. For each interview, one team member

158
Part II
■The Business Side of Data Warehousing
should be designated to take notes. It is helpful to make an audio recording
of the session. These are to be used as input into the documentation process.
Make sure that this is acceptable to everyone in the interview. The tapes will be
helpful foreventhe mostcompulsive note takers. The interviewdiscussionscan
be very fast, and it will interrupt the ﬂow if you have to ask someone to ‘‘repeat
the last six things.’’ Knowing that the ideas are captured on the tape keeps the
conversation moving quickly and enables the great thoughts to be captured.
Running the Interview
After the responsibilities of each interviewee have been shared, begin asking
broad questions about goals, objectives, and performance. Sample questions
that can be used were provided earlier in this chapter. Explore business
themes, analyses, and data, as mentioned. Be sure to give each interviewee the
opportunity to share. Take the time to speciﬁcally address each one, asking for
his or her speciﬁc input.
Concluding the Interview
Leave ten to ﬁfteen minutes at the end of the session for wrap-up discussion.
Ask if there is anything else that the project team should be aware of that
could impact the data warehouse project. Also ask whether the interviewees
have any questions about the project. As part of the wrap-up, review the next
steps. The participants will be asked to review the interview documentation
for accuracy. Once all of the interview documents are completed, they will be
published. This enables others to read what was discussed in this session and
for this group to read what was shared in the other interviews. Be sure to set
proper expectations—just because something was discussed does not mean
that it will be included in the data warehouse with this project. Offer to be
available for questions and thank everyone for their time.
Putting the Pieces Together
The interview sessions are helpful, but in order for the value to last, what was
learned must be documented. This enables the interviewees to validate what
was learned, and it helps other project team members who were not in that
speciﬁc session. In addition to ensuring that the information is documented
for future use, the process of writing documentation also helps to crystallize
what was shared. What may make sense during a meeting may not make sense
later. These topics must be understood in order to be able to write even a short
paragraph about them.

Chapter 6

Individual Interview Documentation
Document each interview session. The interview documentation is not simply
a transcription of the meeting. This is an analysis and interpretation of
what was said. The essence of the discussion must be captured, rather than
the word for word dialogue. Nor is a bulleted list of what was learned
during an interview session sufﬁcient. Each person who reads items on a list
interprets it in his or her own way. This could result in ten or ﬁfteen different
meanings, all of which may fail to reﬂect what the person who wrote the list
meant.
A brief paragraph should be enough to ensure that everyone knows what
each item means. For example, ‘‘marketing performance monitoring’’ could
mean tracking the response rate of a promotion, tracking promotion expenses
to the budget, or even tracking the performance of each of the brand managers
who work in the marketing department. All three could be useful, but which
one was expressed as a requirement and which one is included in the project
scope? Thorough requirements documentation would clarify this.
Responsibilities
This is the easiest section of the interview summary to write. This is where the
basic job responsibilities of each interview participant are documented. This
should not be lengthy or too detailed, but simply provide an overview of what
this person’s job is at the time of the interview. This helps in the future, when
people may have changed jobs, to be able to see what perspective they were
representing at that time.
Business Themes
This is the hardest section to document. The business theme is a topic that
was touched upon during the interview. Most likely, the topics are mentioned
multiple times. A complete description of the topic is needed. Think about the
heart of the matter. Each time something is mentioned, it may be another aspect
or detail that, when collected, provides a more complete picture. These should
be grouped into logical categories of related themes. For example, multiple
themes may have been mentioned in the area of product development, ﬁnance,
claims management, sales and marketing, or school accountability. Under each
of these categories, the individual themes will be described. Most of the themes
are related to areas of the business itself, but several themes are much more
speciﬁc to data and systems. These are important, but they should not be the
only requirements that are collected.

160
Part II
■The Business Side of Data Warehousing
Business Data
This section should document the data that was mentioned by the business.
This is not limited to speciﬁc databases that are managed by IT. This must
represent all of the different types of data that are used for analysis. This
will include the data that is captured and stored by the primary application
systems within the organization. This section should also include a description
of spreadsheets or personal databases that are maintained within the business
community. If the speciﬁc system where this data can be found is identiﬁed,
then it should be noted. The lack of a speciﬁc system name should not exclude
business data from being listed in the interview documentation.
INFORMAL DATA SOURCES
The systems community can be myopic about what constitutes a data source.
Typically, data sources are only considered to be ‘‘real’’ if the data is stored in a
database that is backed up and maintained by computer operations. However,
from a data warehousing perspective, data that resides outside of this
traditional viewpoint must be considered. The primary characteristics of data
are as follows:
■There is a process in place to collect the data.
■There is a process in place to validate the data.
■The data is stored.
■The data is distributed to others in the business community.
■Business decisions rely on having this data available.
This is real data. The data may be collected by an administrative assistant
over the phone, stored in a spreadsheet, and then e-mailed to all of the
managers. Through the collection process, anomalies are identiﬁed because the
same person typically provides and enters the data. If there are huge
differences between the current data collection and the last data collection,
then this would be questioned when it is reported.
The value of including data like this in the data warehouse is that there
would be a consistent mechanism for integrating this data with the rest of the
data in the data warehouse. This data will be used for decision making,
whether it is easily linked with data from the data warehouse or not. Identify
this more informal data during the requirements gathering process. Later,
techniques for including this information in the environment are explored.
Each of the individual interview documents should be distributed to each
interview participant for feedback. Once each participant has provided feed-
back, the updated documents can be published for everyone else to read. If
the document contains a highly sensitive topic or content, consider excluding
this conﬁdential information from the public documents. The rest are typically
published as part of an overall requirements document.

Consolidated Requirements Documentation
Now that each individual interview has been validated, it is time to consolidate
the ﬁndings across the organization.
Executive Summary
Although a great deal of time and effort goes into gathering and documenting
the business requirements, many people only need to have an overview of this
information. This is the ﬁrst section of the document, but it should be written
last. The executive summary provides a high-level snapshot of the business
issues and themes facing the organization. It should include the following
sections:
Purpose: Include a brief description of why and how these requirements
were collected.
Business Theme Summary: This should be a three-to-ﬁve page summary
of the major business themes that were identiﬁed. This is a high-level
summary of the business themes that resonate across the entire organi-
zation. More details about each theme are included in the next section of
the requirements document.
Critical Findings and Recommendations: This is where important con-
clusions and recommendations of the project team should be documented.
If there has been a management study or perhaps a report from an over-
sight committee, it can be beneﬁcial to tie the data warehouse project to
these recommendations. The speciﬁc recommendation should be listed
with the data warehouse beneﬁt.
Interview Process: A brief description of how the requirements were
gathered is useful. The description may look like the following para-
graphs.
The objective of the interview process is to provide the organization with a
business requirements document that outlines the critical business themes and
issues and identiﬁes key data required for analysis.
The methodology employed for gathering business requirements included
interviewing a number of staff members who utilize information for decision
making. These individuals represent a cross section of the company’s functions.
It was during this interview process that the critical business issues and
high-level data requirements were identiﬁed.
List of Participants: Include a complete list of all of the individuals who
were interviewed.

■The Business Side of Data Warehousing
Consolidated Business Themes
This is a consolidation of what was documented for each interview session.
When a business theme was discussed in more than one session, make sure
that this provides a complete, cross-functional description reﬂecting all of the
needs. Even if a theme was only mentioned in one session, it should still be
included here. In the future, this will be the primary source for requirements.
The individual session documentation will serve as a reference for ﬁnding out
more about a topic. Examples of how the business themes are documented
were provided previously in this chapter as the samples.
N O T E
Why not just jump to a consolidated document? It is much more difﬁcult
to analyze what was said in multiple sessions at once than to understand and
document each step along the way. It is also helpful to keep the interviewees
involved and feeling like their participation is speciﬁcally beneﬁting the project.
When the requirements are melded together, it is more difﬁcult to determine
where they actually originated.
Candidate Business Analyses
Each business theme will have at least one analysis that helps address those
challenges. If speciﬁc analyses are not mentioned, then the project must reﬂect
on the theme to determine what might be helpful to support it. The process
to identify analyses is usually driven by the business representatives on the
project team. If there are too many business themes to fully develop the
analyses, then this may be done for those themes that will be the focus of this
project. The last section of this chapter reviews how to ensure that the project
charter and scope align with what was learned during this requirements
gathering process.
In other cases, speciﬁc business analyses may have been mentioned during
the interview process and documented for that session. If so, this would be
a consolidation of all the different analyses mentioned. Sometimes you will
have a collection of analyses that have been identiﬁed, which can help you to
identify an overall business theme. While looking at the types of analyses that
are currently performed can be helpful, this should not be an exercise to create
a complete report inventory.
Consolidated Business Data Requirements
This is a consolidation of all of the different data that was identiﬁed in each
interview session. Again, if the same data was mentioned multiple times, then
a complete description of that data should be put together. If the source of
the business data is well known, then the more detailed name of the database

Chapter 6
■Providing Business Requirements
163
or application system should be noted here. If it is known that this data is
not captured currently, that should also be noted. Finally, include any details
that were shared about where this type of data may be found. The intent is to
provide a complete picture about the data that the business community would
like to use for analysis and reporting.
Identiﬁcation of Non-Data Warehouse Requirements
While conducting interview sessions, the project team often learns about other
concerns that are not speciﬁc to a data warehouse. If the biggest and most
often reported data-related pain point is the need for consistent and accu-
rate customer and vendor contact information, then perhaps there is a
need to develop a centralized directory database that will be used by all
operational applications. This is a highly visible and critical business require-
ment, but not something that a data warehouse delivers. Note these types
of non-data-warehouse requirements in the documentation, but clearly label
them. During the interview session, identify such items as not a data ware-
house function, and indicate that you can’t comment on if, when, or how this
can or will be addressed, but that the project team is willing to share this
information with the appropriate systems personnel.
Common Requirements Gathering Challenges
Many other techniques are used to gather requirements for other systems
projects, although a lot of the techniques are not successful in the long run for a
data warehouse. This section reviews the most common pitfalls and challenges
that you are likely to face while gathering requirements.
Sifting Through Reports
While looking at the existing reports can be done, it will not actually provide
the project with requirements that result in a design to support the organization
into the future. Rather, this provides details about what has been developed
in the past. One thing that is used to improve this approach is to capture
the frequency with which the report is run. However, this does not tell you
whether anyone looks at the report results or what the report is used for.
Typically, an existing report is simply one step in a complex set of activities
that results in the report that is actually provided to management to be used
for decision making.
It can be helpful to dig into more detail for those reports identiﬁed by
the business as being useful. This may be done during an interview or as a
follow-up. Either way, it is important to understand why a given report is
useful and what is it used for. Studying reports should not take the place of
understanding the business themes.

164
Part II
■The Business Side of Data Warehousing
Listing Data Elements
Because a data warehouse is for storing data, business groups may put
together a list of data elements that they think they need. They may, for
example, compile a list of the key performance indicators that are needed to
manage the business. These are often developed independently of any actual
data source research.
The problem with using this list as the basis for developing a data warehouse
is that it may involve pulling data from many sources and limits the work
to just the elements on the list. Once these are delivered through the data
warehouse, change begins. The ﬁrst ﬁve requested elements might not turn
out to be what was expected. The second ﬁve data elements may be exactly
what was requested but turn out to not be helpful to the business. This leaves
only the last ﬁve data elements, which are part of what was wanted. Now,
work must begin to go in search of the next suite of data elements that are
of interest to the business. This requires starting back at the underlying data
sources.
Developing Functional Speciﬁcations
The purpose of developing functional speciﬁcations is to deﬁne what a com-
puter application will do, how it looks, and what user interactions are needed.
This is an important step in the design of an operational system. However, it
does not have the same value for data warehouse design. The use of a data
warehouse is quite ﬂuid and can change from person to person and from
week to week. Data warehouse design is much more focused on the optimal
organization of the data needed for analysis. However, once the database has
been designed, it can be beneﬁcial to develop functional speciﬁcations for the
extract, transform and load processes to populate the data warehouse.
Moving Beyond Immediate
Many people are unable to get beyond the immediate data or report frus-
trations. These frustrations may also be more operational in nature and not
anything that can be addressed with a data warehouse anyway. Listen care-
fully; you may identify an opportunity to address a problem in an existing
system. This helps the overall organization, but it does not provide data
warehouse requirements. If this happens during an interview, encourage the
group to let off some steam, and then direct the discussion toward the future.
Tell the group to imagine that all of these issues have been resolved. All the
data is clean, integrated, and at their ﬁngertips. Let this thought sink in a
moment, and then ask the group what they would do now. This usually leads
the interview session into exploring the types of business requirements that
are needed to take the organization forward.

Chapter 6
■Providing Business Requirements
165
Lack of Requirements
There may be a general sense that if the organization had a data warehouse it
would help the business to be more successful. However, there may not be any
more speciﬁc or detailed requirement that can be found. The processes that are
currently in place are used again and again. Everyone knows how to execute
their part of the process. Often, these individuals do not have a real need for
a data warehouse. In fact, a data warehouse may require more effort. Initially
these individuals would need to learn a new tool, have to ﬁgure where to ﬁnd
data they need (which is not where it used to be), and then produce their part
of the puzzle. From their perspective, this is a lot more work to get to the same
answers they get today.
If this is the case, more research must be done to ferret out true requirements.
Perhaps a different group is really driving the need. Sometimes this comes out
of requirements at the highest management levels. Real business requirements
must be identiﬁed before moving forward at all!
The Cynic
The project team must be prepared to explain how this project is different and
more likely to succeed when other attempts have failed. It is also worthwhile
to ask this type of individual what needs to be in place to make this initiative
successful. Explore all areas—from data to technology to organization and
stafﬁng. Why did previous attempts not succeed?
This may be a single individual, a small group, or in some cases most of the
business community itself. There must be a joint effort between the business
and systems team members to address these concerns.
If left untreated, the business people may not invest their time and energy
to a level that is needed, which will then contribute to this project failing too.
There must be enough conﬁdence that everyone is willing to try their best for
success. Unfortunately, in the worst case, the executive business sponsor may
need to partner with other executives to send a message that this is important
and everyone must be encouraged to cooperate.
DANGERS OF GATEKEEPERS
It is easy to push the responsibility to participate in the project to the people
who support reporting and analysis today. These people are often business
analysts within the business community. Indeed, these people are
knowledgeable about the inner workings of the source systems. They have the
technical expertise to pull data from every corner of the organization. The
problem with relying only on these business analysts is that their knowledge is
(continued)

166
Part II
■The Business Side of Data Warehousing
DANGERS OF GATEKEEPERS (continued)
based upon what is being asked today. Superior analysts have an
understanding of why reports are run, but many others do not. They simply run
reports that are already put in place and deliver the results to the appropriate
person.
Over time, the business community gets a reasonable understanding of how
long it takes to get different types of reports, so business people ﬁlter what is
requested. If an answer is needed this afternoon but it always takes three days
to get the data, it will not be requested. In addition, some reports require so
much effort that the business community does not ask, as it would divert
resources from other required work.
These business analysts can actually become a roadblock for a data
warehouse project. The ability for individuals to access data directly can be
perceived as a threat to their jobs. It is important to ensure that these people
understand that the goal is to free them from manual data gathering so that
they can spend time actually performing analysis.
To get true business requirements, talk directly to the people who receive
reports and results of analyses. These gatekeepers provide good insight that is
needed for the data warehouse, but don’t limit the input for the project to their
perspective.
Now that the business requirements have been collected and documented,
it is time to revisit the objectives of the project.
Setting Attainable Goals
Before moving to the next step, take a moment to look again at the project
charter and scope. Those project documents were created without the in-depth
insight that has been gleaned during the requirements gathering process.
In many instances the original project intent is reinforced by the business
requirements. If so, then there is no need to go through the steps described
next. However, there are also many cases where the business requirements do
not align with the project charter. Rather than forge ahead with the original
plan, now is the time to reevaluate the charter and scope.
This mismatch between requirements and the project charter is often identi-
ﬁed by members of the project team. This discrepancy must be communicated
to the business champion, DW manager, executive business sponsor, and IT
sponsor. In order to address the situation, the requirements ﬁndings can be
used to propose other possible project(s), exploring the potential business
value of each. In a joint effort between key IT and business managers, the
different alternatives can be prioritized, and ﬁnally the project charter and
scope must be modiﬁed to reﬂect the new direction. This would certainly be a

Chapter 6
■Providing Business Requirements
167
case to invoke the project change control procedure, and the entire statement
of work—including estimated effort, timeline and costs—would need to be
revised. The ﬁrst step is to ﬁgure out the different project alternatives.
N O T E In some cases, you might discover that the biggest business require-
ments are not in reporting and analysis, but in other areas of the systems and
business processes. With limited resources, perhaps this is not the right time
to spend money on data warehousing. It may be best to postpone building the
data warehouse until these other issues are addressed.
Exploring Alternatives
The ﬁrst step to prepare for a joint prioritization session is to ﬁgure out what
different possible projects could look like. Key members of the project team,
often those who were involved in gathering the requirements, typically do the
initial legwork. The objective is to ﬁgure out what complete business analyses
could be supported by different business data. There might be too many
business analyses and different types of data to be able to perform detailed
analysis on all of this. The clear outliers can be eliminated. For example, do
not include data that is not available, and don’t spend time digging into the
details of analyses mentioned by a one person from an auxiliary group.
Using a matrix, show the relationship between each business analysis and
the data needed to support it. A sample matrix is shown in Table 6-1. Each row
represents an analysis detailed in the requirements document. Each column
represents a different type of business data. At this point, a speciﬁc system
should be identiﬁed as the source of this business data. It is not worth going
through this process for data that is not being captured. The body of the matrix
is ﬁlled in when a speciﬁc analysis requires that data.

■The Business Side of Data Warehousing
This matrix can be used to understand what data is needed to support which
analyses. For example, to support Business Group Performance, as shown in
Table 6-1, all four data sources would need to be loaded. The matrix also shows
that if Shipments data were loaded to support Sales Performance Monitoring,
then three other analyses would also be performed.
In addition to simply creating the matrix, it is useful to think about the
possible beneﬁt that these analysis groups could provide. Conversely, the com-
plexity of loading each data source must be evaluated.
Another area of consideration is the ease of integrating the sources. If all the
sources under consideration use a common set of identiﬁers that can be used
to link the data, it will be quite straightforward to process. However, if each
source has its own identiﬁers and no one has developed a map between the
sources, this will increase the complexity of any integration efforts. This is the
type of background information that is needed during the joint prioritization
session. The team that gathered the requirements typically does this with the
help of the project manager, the business champion, and the DW manager.
This group should have the background necessary to evaluate both potential
business value and technical feasibility.
UNDERSTANDING THE ANALYSIS AND DATA RELATIONSHIP
One of the most unfortunate things to observe is when a data warehouse is
delivered to the business community only to have the business express
frustration that it doesn’t do what is needed. This often results from a series of
small decisions about what to include and exclude from the project. Some data
is more complex and requires a great deal more effort than was realized going
into the project. Often, the only option from a project team perspective is to
scale back. Agreeing to such a decision is often done without realizing the
business impact of leaving some data out. All such decisions, even at the time
of initial prioritization, need to be done with an understanding of what analyses
can be completed with or without the data in question. It is also important to
note if an analysis is only partially supported with a speciﬁc set of data.
A completely different way to study various implementation alternatives is
to isolate the analyses needed to support a speciﬁc group of people. Again,
using the analysis–data source matrix, you can determine how many sources
would be needed to fully support that group. Perhaps most of the analyses
can be supported with the implementation of three data sources. This may be
a recommendation to be made during the prioritization session.
Setting Priorities
Now that combinations of business data and analyses have been explored, it is
time to make decisions about what should be designed and subsequently built.

Chapter 6
■Providing Business Requirements
169
The executive steering committee needs to participate in the process of setting
priorities. Each individual group will have its own highest-priority item, and
each group would like its own needs met ﬁrst. Because this is not possible, a
decision must be made determining what would bring the most value to the
entire organization.
Working to deﬁne these priorities can be done by getting key business and
technical representatives in a room together, for half a day. This may seem like
a lot of time to ask for, but it will be time well spent. If priorities can be set with
less time, then the meeting will simply adjourn early. The participants must be
able to articulate the value and impact of decisions on their own group. They
must also be able to compromise for the greater good.
Conducting a joint prioritization session is especially valuable for the
project team. Later, if there is any negative feedback or frustration about
what is included in this project, the discussion needs to be held with business
management, not the project team. The session also provides a clearer under-
standing of the business value and impact of each proposed alternative and
the recommended direction. The goal is to be able to pick the area that will
have the biggest impact on the business yet still have manageable scope to
ensure successful completion.
N O T E Remember that this is not a process to determine what will ever be
loaded into the data warehouse, but what will be loaded ﬁrst.
Go into the session armed with the business themes, business analysis/data
matrix, possible project alternatives, and some idea about the feasibility of
building these solutions. At this point, it may be too hard to quantify a speciﬁc
dollar amount to place on the potential value. Another way to get your arms
around this is to compare the different themes with each other. Which has
a bigger impact? Which is harder or easier to build? The goal is to identify
which areas of the business will have the biggest potential beneﬁt and are the
most feasible to build. Then, more work can be done to articulate the estimated
ﬁnancial impact of being able to address these high-value, feasible challenges.
Pick one or two of these themes that use similar data to begin building the
data warehouse.
Now that you have a short list of business themes to work on, you can spend
time getting into more detail about each one. Take a good look at the only
the top few. It is not worth taking the time to determine whether one theme
should be ranked as number eighteen or nineteen. By the time that the ﬁrst
data warehouse project is done, it may have become the next most important
thing to work on.
The business decisions made here may impact what this project will deliver.
Project change control must be used to revise the project plan, statement of

■The Business Side of Data Warehousing
work, scope and perhaps the charter too. Changes now will help ensure that
the data warehouse will support the highest priorities of the business.
Once the business priority is set, there must be patience and understanding
that data will not be ready for use overnight. Data may not even be available in
a matter of weeks. It may be multiple months before anything can be delivered.
This is sometimes difﬁcult to understand because technological advances have
made it easier than ever to quickly move data around. However, often the
data as it exists today is of questionable accuracy, is likely not integrated with
other data across the organization, and may not even be captured anywhere.
Decisions need to be made about how to properly process the data, rather
than simply move it around. These rules are needed to clean, integrate, and
structure the data in a more meaningful way. Let’s see how the two companies
we are tracking are progressing.
In Real Life
Many organizations struggle with gathering business requirements. Tech-
niques used for other types of systems development are not working. Now we
will take a look at how our case study companies are doing.
A Glimpse into Giant Company
To manage all of the employees in such a large organization, speciﬁc roles and
responsibilities are clearly and somewhat rigidly deﬁned. There are people
in the business community who serve as the liaison between their group
and systems. The data warehouse project team is not allowed direct access
to business decision makers. This greatly inhibits the team’s ability to gather
business requirements.
To address this challenge, all of the managers involved, both from the
business groups and IT, met to discuss the situation. With encouragement
from the executive and IT sponsors, they agreed to loosen the deﬁnition of
roles and empowered their staff to begin to interact directly and be ﬂexible.
This did not require that changes be made through the HR department; just the
agreement between the managers to work smarter. This enabled the project
team to work directly with both the business liaisons and the business decision
makers.

everyone moving in the same direction. There are always new crisises that
need to be addressed. Both business and IT staff spin from one crisis to the
next, which leaves little time to invest in long-term efforts. This is usually
viewed as an advantage, rather than a challenge.
However, developing a successful data warehouse requires spending time
on things that may not have immediate beneﬁts but will indeed make a huge
difference in the future. The organization will never stop spinning unless there
is a conscious effort to make it happen. Senior management must make a
commitment, and stick to it, to allocate at least some people to this effort. This
is easy in the beginning, but as time goes on there is a big temptation to divert
the data warehouse team members to help on some immediate situation.
Resist! Unless this investment is made, the organization will never get out of
the mode of grabbing data to help address an immediate need. Taking the time
to gather complete business requirements and looking at priorities helps the
organization to see the potential value that can be realized, even from loading
the ﬁrst data source. While getting started with more structure was difﬁcult,
the business impact of building the data warehouse helps everyone to focus
on getting the data warehouse built. Not everyone’s needs are addressed up
front, but those that will be met will help the entire organization to be more
successful.
Summary
Having a good understanding of the business in general and then a deeper
understanding of business challenges and themes provides the necessary
background to design a data warehouse that will meet the business’s needs
now and into the future. Well-documented requirements are not only useful
for the initial project, but also tend to remain accurate for years. These capture
the essence of the business and thus the basics remain constant.
Having this good foundation provides the project team with the correct
perspective as they begin to develop a data model that will help the business to
address whatever challenges have been identiﬁed. The next chapter discusses
how to create the data model—in a way that makes sense to the business
community and captures the details needed to construct the database.

Regardless of what technology will be used, the heart and soul of the data
warehouse is the data itself. How the data is organized can have a signiﬁcant
impact on how well the environment will work. A great deal of thought and
care must go into the design of the data. This chapter presents the concepts
covering how the data should be organized to support reporting and analysis.

Purpose of dimensional models
Basic components of a dimensional model
How to contribute to the modeling process
A case study of the dimensional model for call center operations is used
to reinforce the concepts presented. This chapter also includes content that is
geared toward the more technical members of the project team, including the
following:
A technique to document the dimensional model, speciﬁcally geared
toward the business community
A process for developing the dimensional model with participation from
the business community

more effectively between the business and technical team members. Before
diving into the modeling concepts, the ﬁrst section reviews the rationale for
dimensional modeling and why it is of interest to business people.

■Dealing with the Data
The Purpose of Dimensional Models
A speciﬁc modeling technique has evolved in order to support the types
of queries and analyses that businesses require. This technique is called
dimensional modeling. This approach has been applied to data warehousing for
nearly thirty years and is supported by a wide variety of database platforms
and data access or business intelligence tools. Dimensional models support
the business perspective of the data, and today’s technology ensures that they
can be effectively implemented.
Dimensional modeling is a formal data modeling technique that is used
to organize and present data for analytical and reporting use. The focus
is on the business perspective and representation of data. The goal is to
free the data that has been captured and stored by the operational systems
and make it available to the business community. Regardless of how data
is structured, business people will ask questions based upon their frame of
reference. This perspective is driven by the basic characteristics of the industry
and how the company is organized, so why not organize the data to reﬂect
this business perspective? The two primary goals for dimensional modeling
are ease of use and query performance. These are the principles that guide the
entire dimensional modeling process.
There are other data modeling techniques that play an important part in
overall systems development. They help ensure that the data itself and the rela-
tionships between different data elements are clearly deﬁned. For operational
systems, it is important that the data be organized to facilitate transaction
processing. This includes ensuring transaction integrity and speed. The type
of modeling used for operational system design is called entity-relationship
(E-R) modeling. This may also be referred to as normalized modeling. One speciﬁc
form of E-R modeling represents the data in third normal form (3NF). There
is a complete discipline surrounding this approach to data modeling. This is
mentioned to acknowledge the value and purpose of E-R modeling for opera-
tional system design. The following two sections examine the main objectives
of dimensional modeling.
Ease of Use
In order to ensure that people will use a data warehouse, the data must be
presented in a manner that makes sense to them. If it is too confusing or
does not mirror the way the business runs, then people are not likely to
use it. Therefore, the dimensional model must cleanly represent the basic
components of the business. In addition, the model must be presented in terms
that are used by the business.
A well-designed dimensional model should be obvious to the business
community and be met with a conﬁrmation that it is indeed correct. If it causes

Chapter 7
■Modeling the Data for your Business
177
a great deal of confusion within the business community, then the model has
not yet captured the business perspective.
T I P
Don’t do what is easier to implement, do what is easier for the business users.
Query Performance
The second, and equally important, goal of a dimensional model is to ensure
good query performance. If requests do not run in a timely manner, the data
warehouse will not be used and will not be helpful to the business. Dimensional
modeling takes the need for this query performance into account as part of the
inherent design approach. The data is organized in order to provide consistent
performance both for queries that are requested up front and for those that crop
up later. All possible queries cannot be deﬁned in advance, so the technique
takes this into account to provide support for unpredictable access patterns.
Understanding Your Data
The requirements gathering process detailed in Chapter 6 identiﬁed the
different kinds of data that are needed for the DW. The prioritization process,
also discussed in Chapter 6, helps ensure that the project charter and scope
align with the business requirements, including analyses and the data sources
needed. Now, detailed data analysis is needed to really understand what
is stored in the operational databases that have been identiﬁed. A robust
operational database is likely to have hundreds of tables and thousands of
individual data elements.
A lot of legwork should be done by the core project team to determine
which data elements may be useful. The systems staff members responsible for
maintaining that application can be invaluable in this research. The objective
is to narrow down the sheer number of data elements that need to be studied.
This is also called source data analysis. This can range from running simple
queries to much more sophisticated analysis. At a minimum, simple queries
should be run against the application system’s data structures. The types of
queries include the following:
Has this data element ever been populated?
When was the last time this table was updated?
What percentage of the rows in this table contain data?
What are the possible values for this data element?
What is the frequency with which these values are used?

178
Part III
■Dealing with the Data
The results of these queries can be used to determine which elements would
be useful for reporting and analytical purposes. If the data element has never
been populated, then this does not need further study. If a data element has
not been changed in years, this may indicate core reference data that is still
valid or it may indicate that this data is no longer being captured and/or
maintained by the operational system. Obsolete data elements do not need to
be addressed in the modeling process.
It is also helpful to have business analysts participate in this analysis. They
can often help the team to understand the data content. Over time, the original
name and meaning of a column can be lost or changed. It is helpful to know
how the data is used today. The objective is not to isolate data elements that
have been requested for reporting, but to identify all data elements that contain
business data. This is often done through an elimination process. For example,
data elements that are obsolete or those that are used to drive security for
the operational system do not contain business data that would need to be
included in the data warehouse.
Data proﬁling is a more comprehensive set of activities intended to look at
data across all systems, operational and analytical. This is described in more
detail in Chapter 8.
T I P
Look at all the data elements, not just those speciﬁcally identiﬁed for
reporting.
After there is a clear understanding of what the business is trying to
accomplish and a familiarity with the data that is available, it is time to look at
how that data should be organized.
What Is a Dimensional Model?
A dimensional model is a data model organized for the purpose of user under-
standability and high performance. There are two basic parts of a dimensional
model: the dimensions and the facts. These are the building blocks that comprise
all dimensional models, simple or complex.
Dimensions
Dimensions are groupings of data elements in major business categories.
Common dimensions include the following:
Customers
Products
Dates

Chapter 7
■Modeling the Data for your Business
179
Suppliers
Vendors
Accounts
The individual data elements are called dimensional attributes, or reference
data. The dimensional attributes are used as row and column headings for
reports. They are used to create lists of options to determine what to include
or exclude on a report. The relationship between these dimensional attributes
creates drill paths or the ability to navigate up and down a hierarchy.
The need for dimensional data is often recognized while gathering business
requirements. It may not be directly communicated, but realized when some-
one needs a report by region, by week, and by product category. Each of the
terms following the word ‘‘by’’ is a dimensional attribute. These should be
included in dimensions to support that type of reporting.
An example of a customer dimension is shown in Figure 7-1. This is a highly
simpliﬁed example that only shows the customer’s address and date of birth
attributes. Some of these attributes relate to each other in a hierarchy, while
others are simply additional characteristics of the customer. Any of these
attributes could be used to constrain a query or for use in a report.

T I P
A dimension can include attributes that are descriptive and that relate to
each other, creating hierarchies.

180
Part III
■Dealing with the Data
The arrows represent one-to-many or one-to-one relationships. This notation
is used because it is more meaningful to business users to visualize the drill
paths, rather than the more traditional representation of ‘‘crow’s feet.’’ In fact, if
looking at the arrows causes technical staff members to furrow their brows,
this is the same reaction that crow’s feet have to business staff members.
The intent of the business dimensional model is to communicate with the
business.
Facts
Facts are the measurement of business events. These are captured as speciﬁc
information about a business event or transaction. These are measured, moni-
tored, and tracked over time. Facts are typically the amounts and counts that
show up as the body of reports. Facts are used as the basis for all calcula-
tions. Examples of facts include units ordered, retail price, amount paid, claim
payment amount, gross margin, budgeted dollars, revenue forecast, and loan
balance, among others.
The facts are only interesting within the proper context, and the context
comes from the dimensions. For example, the fact that a company had $10,000
in sales is not useful unless you know that it was from red shoes, in the Chicago
market, the week before Valentine’s Day.
Using Both Parts of the Model
Dimensional models can represent very complex businesses. Although there
can be many different aspects of a business, most people deal with only a few
variables at a time. Most of us can easily draw a three-dimensional cube, but
it is much more difﬁcult to draw a four dimensional cube. Similarly, while the
overall model may contain over ten dimensions, often only three are reﬂected
on a single report at a time.
The way that people think about data is often deﬁned by the layout of a
spreadsheet: rows and columns with perhaps a separate worksheet to represent
another variable. For example, Figure 7-2 is a common sales performance report
showing the monthly proﬁt results for the current year, reported by product
category. Each region of the organization is represented as a separate page.
This report is constrained to the current year of data, and uses product, date,
and sales organization dimensions. The Product Category attribute is from the
Product dimension. The constraint for the current year is on the year attribute
of the Date dimension. The months are also from the Date dimension. The
Sales Regions (per sheet) are from the Sales Organization dimension. The fact
itself is the Sales Proﬁt, listed in thousands of dollars.

The dimensions and facts are used together to create basic reports such as
this one, or more sophisticated analyses. More detail about using dimensional
models can be found in the section ‘‘A Call Center Case Study.’’
Implementing a Dimensional Model
Many different database technologies are available today to store data. Many
of these have been developed speciﬁcally to support data warehouses. It is
useful to have a basic understanding of these in order to be able to put the
dimensional model into the appropriate context. A dimensional model is not
inherently tied to a speciﬁc technology, and it can be implemented in a variety
of different ways. Different types of databases include the following:
Relational databases are one of the most commonly used databases for
both operational and data warehouse systems today. When a dimensional
model is stored in a relational database it is called a star schema. This is
due to the visual appearance of the dimension tables surrounding the fact
table.
Multi-dimensional databases are speciﬁcally designed to support a
dimensional view of the data. The data is stored in proprietary array
structures. When a dimensional model is stored in a multi-dimensional
database, it is called a cube (even though it may actually contain more
than three dimensions).
Proprietary databases are also available on the market. Many of these
are designed speciﬁcally to support reporting and analytical use. There
is a wide range of different methods used to physically organize and
access the data in these environments. Once the dimensional model is
completed, there is often no additional design work required to determine
how the data will be structured in these environments. This is all handled
by the proprietary system.

182
Part III
■Dealing with the Data
When database software and hardware are ﬁne-tuned and bundled together,
they are called a data warehouse appliance. These concepts are included here
because they are commonly used and most readers have likely heard several
of these terms.
Diagramming Your Dimensional Model
There are different ways to document and present dimensional models. One of
the most common ways that dimensional models are depicted are as tables to
be stored in a relational database. The dimensional model can be documented
using the same modeling tool that is used to develop any other data models
for the relational database. Each of the dimensional attributes is included and
represented using logical names that should be meaningful to the business.
This type of table diagram is easily understood by systems professionals, but
it is not as clear to business professionals.
Another method to document your dimensional model is to present business
diagrams. The intent is to visually present the model in terms that more closely
reﬂect the interface that will ultimately be presented for access. This is called
business dimensional modeling, and it can be documented using any visual
diagramming tool.
Careful analysis must be performed and dimensional modeling principles
must be followed in either case. The primary difference is how the model is
presented to the business. The diagram notation of the business dimensional
model is reviewed next. The process to develop a dimensional model is
discussed later in this chapter.
The Business Dimensional Model
With the increasing variety of options for building the data warehouse, it
is important to split the business perspective from the technical perspective
regarding the data. The Business Dimensional Model (BDM) is a data model that
is speciﬁcally geared toward working with the business community. It serves
as an abstraction layer that insulates the model from technical implementation
details. The model also serves as a communication vehicle between the business
and systems groups. The model shows diagrams of the dimensions and the
facts so that the details can be reviewed and discussed in business terms. This
also separates the business discussion from any technical discussions.
The business side of the problem can be addressed in enough detail so that
the systems team can implement the model in any technology. Limited tech-
nical tips are shared at the end of this chapter to guide the project team when
implementing the dimensional model in a relational database management

Chapter 7
■Modeling the Data for your Business
183
system. Other technical implementation details are not covered in detail in
this book. The project team should work directly with the technology vendors
for guidelines and recommendations speciﬁc to whatever tool is being used.
A dimensional model can reﬂect a wide range of data from multiple data
sources. The focus is on understanding the dimensionality of the business
itself and the facts that are needed to measure that part of the business. The
business dimensional model will reﬂect all of the data to be included in the
data mart. A summary of all of the notation used for the business dimensional
model is provided at the end of the chapter.
Business Dimensions
Each business dimension of the model will be designed and diagrammed
separately. The business attributes are included to fully describe the dimension.
Each business attribute of the dimension is depicted with a rectangle, as shown
in the sample dimensions in Figure 7-3. For each dimension, you need to
identify the lowest level of detail that exists. This is also called the grain of
the dimension. This lowest-level attribute is shaded. The relationship between
each of the business attributes is noted with an arrow. The direction of the
arrow shows the direction to drill down to see more detail. These are also
commonly referred to as hierarchies. Note that this organization’s ﬁscal year
does not align with the calendar year. The grain for this dimension, or the
lowest level of detail, is the Day attribute. Each individual business attribute
is included in the dimension diagram.

■Dealing with the Data
Sometimes a speciﬁc business attribute is requested but is not captured in
any current source systems. To facilitate communication, this can be included
in the dimension diagram, but the notation is different. The dotted rectangle
indicates that the data element is either not captured or is not to be included
in the initial implementation. In this example, the Holiday attribute is planned
for the future. This ensures that the model reﬂects true business needs, but it
also helps set and maintain expectations that the element is not going to be
available at this time.
The dimensiondiagramitselfis onlypart ofthe documentationthatis needed
for the dimension. The diagram shows each attribute with a useful business
label. In Figure 7-3, note that each of the date hierarchies is uniquely named.
This helps ensure that the correct attribute is easily selected for reporting. It is
also important to have a clear deﬁnition of each attribute, and several sample
values. The sample values are often what will spark recognition of what an
attribute represents. This does not need to be a complete list of all the possible
values for this attribute. Table 7-1 shows the additional documentation that is
needed to support the dimension diagram.
DATA NAMES AND DEFINITIONS
The business community must take a lead role in developing clear, meaningful
names for each of these attributes. The business must also be responsible for
creating the deﬁnition of each attribute. These are critical to ensure that the
model is easily understandable and accurately documented. Meaningful data
deﬁnitions are one part of overall data governance. This topic is important
enough that Chapter 8 is devoted to discussing data ownership and governance
issues.
Fact Groups
The second part of the model contains the facts, which is where the business
measurements are stored. Modeling the facts is much more than simply
creating a list of the business measures that are needed. Each of these facts
must be reﬂected within the proper context. This can be understood by
looking at how the data is captured and how the business uses each fact. The
dimensions that are relevant to these facts are shown. The grain, or lowest
level of detail that applies, is also identiﬁed for each applicable dimension.
Often, several facts will have the same dimensionality and identical grain.
These facts can be put together into a fact group.

Figure 7-4 shows a fact group for retail sales. The name of the fact group is
in the hexagon at the center of the diagram. Each dimension that applies to this
fact group is diagrammed as a bubble around the hexagon. The speciﬁc grain is
also included in each bubble. This is important because facts can have similar
dimensionality, but be at different levels of detail. If you have two facts that
have the same dimensions but one is daily and the other is monthly, these must
be split into two separate fact groups. You must design only single-grain fact
groups. Mixing the grain of a fact group can cause query results to be incorrect.

The name and deﬁnition for each fact must be documented. Table 7-2 shows
this information for a Retail Sales Fact Group. The table also includes a column
that indicates what to do with the facts as you drill up and down through
hierarchies and group the facts by other attributes from the dimensions. This
is the default aggregation rule for each fact. The aggregation rule is also needed
if a query excludes a dimension entirely. For example, if you want to know
the number of units sold by Calendar Month, then the other dimensions are
not included in this request. The Units Sold can be summed and then grouped
by the Calendar Months to fulﬁll this request. The most common default
aggregation rules are to sum, or count, the fact.

Using the diagrams for the dimensions and fact groups, you can see what

to better illustrate this capability.
A Call Center Case Study
Most large organizations have some sort of call center. These centers are
sometimes run internally or may be outsourced to third-party organizations.

Chapter 7
■Modeling the Data for your Business
187
The call center in this example is run internally to handle customer calls. These
calls may be to place an order, check the status of an order, request information,
ﬁle a complaint, or share a compliment. This case study shows the business
dimensional model for this organization. While this shows a mostly complete
picture of a dimensional model, keep in mind that it has been simpliﬁed to
facilitate an introduction to the modeling approach, rather than to represent
a complete model for a real call center. Clearly, there are many nuances and
details that are speciﬁc to each organization that cannot be addressed here.
Call Center Dimensions
The following sections describe each of the dimensions needed. Both the
dimensional diagram and the supporting table provide a complete description
of each of these dimensions.
Date Dimension
The Date dimension for this call center case study is the same dimension
shown previously in Figure 7-3. This supports analysis by ﬁscal and calendar
years. Deﬁnitions of each of the attributes are provided in Table 7-1.
Time Dimension
Because call patterns can vary drastically throughout the day, it is important
to be able to track the calls at a ﬁne level of detail. Keeping the time of day
attributes separate from the date attributes helps simplify the model, reducing
the size of the dimension, which provides implementation beneﬁts. The basic
hierarchy of the Time dimension shows a straightforward rollup of time. The
Time dimension can also be used to track the work shift of the organiza-
tion. Although the work shifts currently change on the hour, the company
is discussing changing the shifts around. In order to accommodate any pos-
sible future deﬁnition of the work shift, it is shown to the minute. The Time
dimension diagram is shown in Figure 7-5.
Time dimensions are helpful to facilitate the representation of different
parts of the day. If the only need for time or timestamp data is to calculate
the elapsed time between two events, this would not be needed. If speciﬁc
attributes are needed for grouping and reporting, these can easily be stored
in a Time dimension. Also needed are special considerations to accommodate
the shift between standard and daylight saving time. Separate rows can be
included in the table to represent the second hour between 1:00 a.m. and 2:00
a.m. that occurs when the clocks are set back in the fall.

The data deﬁnitions for the Call Center Employee dimension are included

Call Dimension
Each speciﬁc call must be tracked by the call dimension. There is very little that
is known about the call itself that is not already included in other dimensions.
This is what is used to link the participation of multiple different employees
for a variety of activities. This can happen if a call is transferred. The data

Call Center Fact Groups
Now that each of the dimensions is deﬁned, it is time to look at the different
facts that are needed. These are documented next.
Calls Fact Group
Some of the most critical facts that need to be tracked for a call center are those
related to the handling of incoming calls. The Calls fact group is shown in
Figure 7-11. Note that not every dimension deﬁned earlier is included in this
diagram, only those that are relevant to the calls facts. The minute that the call
began for this employee is recorded for the Time dimension.

Having the Number of Calls set to one for each row allows a SUM func-
tion, rather than having to COUNT instances. The SUM function is much faster than
the COUNT function.
Call Center Time Tracking Fact Group
The ability to understand how employees are spending their time is critical
for planning resources. It is also important to be able to track patterns in
performance compared to how time is spent. Perhaps more frequent, but
shorter breaks make customer service representatives more productive. This is
the type of information that needs to be learned by studying the data. To that

end, Figure 7-12 shows the Time Tracking fact group. These facts have some
of the same dimensions as the Calls fact group, but the Task dimension is new.
In addition, it is important to note that the employee time is not tracked at a
minute level of detail but in quarter-hour increments. The facts themselves are
deﬁned in Table 7-10.

Call Forecast Fact Group
In order to be able to schedule employees effectively, it is helpful to have an

work schedules. Development of these work schedules is operational in nature.
The call volume forecast is useful in the data warehouse to compare with actual
call volumes. This enables ﬁne-tuning of the forecasting process. Figure 7-13
shows the Call Forecast fact group. Note that the Time dimension is at the
hour level of detail. Call volume is not forecast at the minute level of detail.

Working with the Model
Business analysts should work with the diagrams to explore how the model
works. This helps ensure that the desired reports and analyses can be run.
The following section walks through how to do this using the Call Center
business dimensional model. Figure 7-14 shows a calendar monthly report of
the number of calls by region. The calendar month perspective aligns with
how the call center interfaces with the customers, and the number of calls fact
is from the Calls fact group (refer to Figure 7-11).

Figure 7-14 Sample Call Center Report
The report can be changed easily for an internal look by swapping out the
Calendar Month for the Fiscal Month on the report. Both of these attributes
are in the Call Center Date dimension (refer to Figure 7-3).
More detail can be pulled by drilling down on the customer regions to get a
customer state. By looking at the Customer dimension in Figure 7-6, you can
see that regions drill down into states. When you use the drill-down feature of
your business intelligence tool, you will see this same report by Customer State.
These ﬁrst two changes show how you can change a report by using other
attributes within the dimensions that are already on the report. Reporting
is not limited to these dimensions. Next, you can change the report to see
the number of calls (the same fact) by employee education level, which is
in the Employee dimension shown in Figure 7-7.
You can also change the fact on the report too. Using another fact from the
same fact group, you can replace the number of calls with the call minutes fact
from the Calls fact group (refer to Figure 7-11).
Finally, you can change the fact to one that is from a different fact group
entirely. This is where you need to ensure that you have consistency between
the dimensions that are on the report. In this case, you can change the fact to
Regular Hours Worked from the Employee Time Tracking fact group shown
in Figure 7-12.
This should help crystallize how dimensional models work. When the model
is implemented, the business intelligence tools provide functionality to drill
down and modify reports as shown in this example. This should also help
you understand that the tool can only perform these functions if the data is
organized in a manner to support it.

fact groups. In order to help understand the contents of the model, a summary
matrix can be created. Table 7-12 shows the index for the Call Center example.

Enterprise Considerations
There are often requirements to combine data from different parts of the orga-
nization. Dimensional models, when designed and implemented properly, can
provide the capability to integrate data at query time. Often, the requirement
to integrate data may not have been expressed during requirements gathering.
This may be due to limitations of the current environment, so this is not
even considered to be possible. This can also happen as the data warehouse
grows over time. New data sources can be added that did not even exist when
the original data warehouse was built. This section covers two fundamental
concepts, conformed dimensions and conformed facts, which are essential to
ensuring that all of the parts of the data warehouse work together.
Conformed Dimensions
A conformed dimension is one that is shared between two or more fact tables.
This enables integration between different fact tables at query time. This is
a foundational principle that enables the longevity of a data warehousing
environment. By using conformed dimensions, facts can be used together,

Chapter 7
■Modeling the Data for your Business
201
aligned along these common dimensions. The beauty of using conformed
dimensions is that facts that were designed independently of each other,
perhaps over a number of years, can be integrated using these conformed
dimensions. An example of the conformed dimension concept can be seen
through the Customer dimension. If a customer is assigned an identiﬁer of
1000, then any reference to that customer is made using the identiﬁer of 1000.
This enables data about that customer from across the enterprise to be com-
bined whenever it occurs, even if it was not a speciﬁc requirement for a data
mart. This supports the ability to integrate data from any fact groups along
their common dimensions at query time.
The biggest challenge in designing a conformed dimension is that it requires
cooperation between different business groups. Too often there is a feeling
that this will force everyone in the organization to a single rollup of the data
and that only common characteristics can be included. This is not the case.
For example, consider that there are four different data elements to describe
Customer Type. Analysis must be done to determine whether there is a legit-
imate business reason for each. Over time, implementation and enforcement
of standards can become lax. Variations in the data can creep in. If three of the
Customer Type data elements are truly supposed to represent the same thing,
then the data should be cleaned up to reﬂect this; but if the fourth instance of
Customer Type really is different, then this can be included. Each Customer
Type must be labeled so that you can tell them apart. Table 7-13 shows sample
values from these four data elements.

R Chain

Electronic Invoice
The ﬁrst three may be melded into an attribute called Customer Type. The
fourth should be renamed to Customer Payment Type.
If all of the attributes in a dimension are conformed, this by default ensures
that all of the hierarchies are the same. However, if there are legitimate business
reasons to represent different hierarchies, then each can be accommodated.
All the attributes within each hierarchy should be uniquely named and clearly
deﬁned. This uniqueness must exist between all of the hierarchies, not just
within each one. This can often be achieved by simply adding a qualifying word

202
Part III
■Dealing with the Data
such as ‘‘Sales’’ or ‘‘Finance’’ to each attribute within its respective hierarchy.
This enables different groups to look at the business in their own way.
In addition to providing integration capabilities, another beneﬁt of con-
formed dimensions is the sharing of attributes across the organization. Using
the preceding example, the Customer Payment Type may have only been
available to the billing group in the past. This may be an interesting way for
the sales and marketing teams to look at Customer. This sharing can yield
fresh insight.
Conformed dimensions should be created once and then shared as appropri-
ate across the enterprise. This leverages development and maintenance efforts
and helps ensure consistency.
Conformed Facts
It is also necessary to ensure consistency of facts. A single fact should be deﬁned
once and remain consistent if it is used anywhere else in the enterprise. These
are conformed facts. Again, if there are variances in meaning, then these are not
the same fact and each should be uniquely named.
There are cases where the fact is intended to be the same but variations have
crept in over time. This provides the opportunity to tighten up the data. Each
fact should have a single deﬁnition.
T I P
When possible, facts should be built and loaded once, and then shared with
any other groups that need to access that fact. If, for performance reasons, the fact
is loaded into more than one database, the deﬁnition and rules to create the fact
must be strictly enforced to ensure consistency. The result should be the same
regardless of which fact group, across the enterprise, is used.
Practical Guidelines
There is no magic number for the right number of dimensions and fact
groups you should have. The number of dimensions and fact groups will be
determined by the industry you are in, the data that the organization has,
and the speciﬁc characteristics of your organization. However, several general
guidelines may be helpful.
Guidelines for a Single Dimension
The more attributes that you have in a dimension, the richer the possible analy-
ses. Whenever possible, seek out additional attributes. For example, the claims
handling system may contain only a limited set of details about the policy-
holder. In order to create a complete and robust customer dimension, it would

Chapter 7
■Modeling the Data for your Business
203
be worthwhile to explore other sources such as a corporate customer master
ﬁle or perhaps the policy administration system for additional customer data.
If you have many dimensions in your model, several are likely to have
deep hierarchies and dozens of attributes, but you may also ﬁnd that several
dimensions have fewer than ﬁve, or perhaps just one attribute. Make sure you
have looked for other sources, and explored additional possible attributes or
hierarchies from the business community. If you can’t ﬁnd any, then this may
in fact just be what you have. One other avenue to explore is whether this
single attribute dimension really belongs within one of the other dimensions.
Guidelines for a Single Fact Group
In general, you are likely to ﬁnd four to ten dimensions on any single fact
group. Fewer than four dimensions may indicate that the dimensions are
too big—with everything stuffed into a dimension. Too few dimensions may
indicate that other dimensions still need to be identiﬁed.
You can also go overboard with too many dimensions. This can affect
usability and perhaps impede the performance of the database. What is
reasonable? It is common for transaction detail fact groups to have between
ten and ﬁfteen dimensions. Once you have more than ﬁfteen dimensions,
you should be concerned. Consider whether several of the dimensions should
be combined. Over twenty dimensions and you could have some serious
performance issues. If after further analysis you determine that there are in
fact more than twenty dimensions, build extra time into your project schedule
to explore the performance ramiﬁcations.
How can you tell which dimensions should and can be combined? It is
important to look closely at the hierarchies. From a business perspective, you
want to be able to follow a hierarchy from the top to the natural bottom. For
example, the business may look at Regions, which are comprised of Districts
and then Zones. Finally, the Zones are made up of Sales Territories. Each of
these is part of the sales organization hierarchy. Suppose that Region, District,
and Zone attributes are stored in one dimension, while the Sales Territory is
in another. Walking through this example may be an indicator that perhaps
Sales Territories belong in the ﬁrst dimension with the other attributes. The
best way to make this determination is to ask the business users what makes
sense to them.
Classic dimensional analysis leverages drilling up or down hierarchies.
When performing analysis against a design that has many dimensions, analysis
will be done by leaving some dimensions out of the query. For example,
for a travel reservation fact group, some people will want to understand
which travel agents or web reservation systems are driving more business.
Conversely, the business people who work with the hotel chains will want to
understand more about the number and type of reservations by hotel brand
and property location.

204
Part III
■Dealing with the Data
Characteristics of the Model across the Enterprise
As a data warehouse grows over time or a broad model is developed up
front, there can be many dimensions and fact groups. It is not unheard of to
have thirty or forty different dimensions as you look across an enterprise. You
are likely to ﬁnd is that a core set of dimensions is used repeatedly. These
must be conformed! The other dimensions are typically used for fact groups
that pertain to only one part of the business. Using an education example,
the school district, student, and teacher dimensions will be used for many
fact groups. Dimensions about student disciplinary actions, extracurricular
activities, or teacher licensure pertain only to some of the fact groups.
T I P
While enterprise-wide models may have over thirty dimensions and fact
groups, keep in mind that any single fact group will have between ﬁve and ﬁfteen
dimensions.
Many organizations are already involved in data warehousing, perhaps
even having multiple data warehouses. These have often been built without
using conformed dimensions. By bringing the dimensions and facts together
into a single model, this can be a good start toward understanding what will
be needed to integrate these stovepipe databases.
Many enterprise-level dimensional models can be complex, because of the
breadth that is included. Most users have an interest only in a subset of this
model. The scope of what is presented to each group of users can be tailored
to meet its own speciﬁc needs. Very few people in the organization may see or
have a need to use the entire model.
ENTERPRISE DESIGN GUIDELINES
■Design broadly.
■Don’t try to tackle all data for the enterprise at once.
■Design at the lowest level of detail that is captured.
■Work with multiple user groups who use the same data.
■Always consider an enterprise viewpoint—who else could use this data?
■Always design and plan for conformed dimensions.
■The dimensional model can be implemented in several increments.
■Each increment should deliver business value.
■Review and update the model with each increment.

Chapter 7
■Modeling the Data for your Business
205
The basic principles of dimensional modeling have been presented. Now it
is time to take a practical look at how the model is created.
Business Participation in the Modeling Process
This section outlines the steps involved in developing the business dimensional
model. The description of the ﬂow is geared more toward the project team, but
it would still be valuable for any reader. The core project team, including the
business analyst, must prepare for the modeling sessions and then develop
a ﬁrst draft. With subsequent reﬁnements of the model, additional business
representatives need to be included to get appropriate feedback. Finally, the
model can be shared with anyone from the data warehouse target business
audience.
Creating the First Draft
One of the keys to getting the ﬁrst cut of the model is having the right resources
working together. The dimensional modeler is the team member who drives
this entire process. The business analyst(s) who helped gather the business
requirements is needed to ensure that the discussion is put into the proper
context. The systems staff members who support and maintain the source
systems are needed to help understand the incoming data elements. The ﬁnal
resource to include in the initial modeling sessions is the lead ETL developer.
This person will be taking the model forward for implementation and is the
individual most likely to take notes about any implementation-related issues
that crop up during modeling. Key business people are not needed yet. Once
an initial draft of the model is sketched out, then their assistance is needed.
All of the participants should have at least an introductory knowledge of the
parts of the dimensional model: facts and dimensions.
Preparing for Modeling Sessions
In order to make the modeling sessions as productive as possible, the project
team needs to do several things. If possible, block out a conference room
for three straight days. As the model is drafted, the parts that have been
diagrammed are posted on the walls. Changing conference rooms wastes a
lot of time removing and putting the diagrams back on the walls. It also
presents a big disruption in the continuity of thought, so try to stay in the same
room if possible. The following checklist details the items you need for these
sessions.

■Business requirements document
■Data source documentation, data models and/or ﬁle layouts, and deﬁni-

■Flip charts
■Markers
■Tape, magnets, or pushpins to hang up ﬂip chart pages (you could use
self-sticking ﬂip charts too)
■A spreadsheet with each source data element
■Electronic means for documenting the business dimensional model
■Connection to the network to look at live data content
It is helpful to have three different people working electronically: one to
document the diagrams, one to takes notes for the ETL process, and one
to look at the actual data and other source system references.
Brainstorming the Framework
Begin by simply starting a list of possible dimensions and fact groups. The
intention is to get some rough ideas. Don’t spend a lot of time debating whether
or not something is a dimension or will simply be an attribute. Just capture the
ideas. For the possible fact groups, think about the kinds of business processes
you are working with. How do you measure them? What is tracked about
those business events? It is helpful to think about the business itself, not what
is tracked in the computer systems.
Drafting the Initial Dimensions
Now, each of the dimensions can be designed. It is often easiest to start with
the Date dimension, which tends to be relatively straightforward and less
controversial than other dimensions.
Once you have picked which dimension you want to work on, you can look
for this type of data in the source systems. This is when the source system
analysts are valuable. Identify the lowest level of detail that exists anywhere
for that dimension. Next, add additional attributes and hierarchies. Look at the
source system reference tables, and look at the source system transaction tables
for more labels, descriptions, and groupings to include in the dimension. When
a good ﬁrst draft is done, post it on the wall in the conference room. Then,
check the list for other possible dimensions to work on next.

Chapter 7
■Modeling the Data for your Business
207
It is common to continue to ﬁnd attributes to add to dimensions that have
already been drafted. Simply add the new attribute to the diagram and go
back to what you were working on.
The objective is to get a ﬁrst draft of all of the dimensions, not to get a perfect
version before moving on to the next dimension. If the group has spent more
than ten or ﬁfteen minutes discussing or debating a set of data elements, then
log the questions and move on. These issues will be reviewed and resolved
later. If the team can’t ﬁgure out what to do fairly quickly, then other people
may be needed to provide more information or it may be too early in the
modeling process. Later, it may seem immediately obvious how to handle a
data element when the rest of the model is ﬂeshed out.
Business dimensions should include attributes that contain complete values
or descriptions. It is not acceptable to include only codes in the dimension.
These codes are often well understood by people who currently access this
data because more complete descriptions are not readily available. Over time,
people have gotten used to these codes and know their meaning. However, it
is difﬁcult for new people to learn them. Many of the current users of the data
have forgotten what it was like when they were trying to ﬁgure the data out.
The objective is to empower people who have not had access to the data in the
past. These people are not likely to know what these codes stand for. Useful
business names and descriptions should be included in the dimensions. Codes
can also be included in the dimensions as needed.
To help create a meaningful visual representation of the dimension, place
the lowest-level attribute at the bottom center of the diagram. No other ele-
ments should appear lower than this element. The main or primary hierarchies
should be placed up the center of the diagram. This shows their importance
and the eye is drawn quickly to them. If other attributes describe similar or
related things, then these should be diagrammed together. For example, if
the Education Level Completion Date is needed, it should be placed near the
Education Level attribute. Keep the attributes in the same general location
with each revision of the model. This helps reduce confusion and keeps people
from thinking that attributes have been removed. If there is a need to clean up
a dimension, do this all at once, and if possible prior to presenting the model
to a wide group of people.
Drafting the Initial Fact Groups
Once the ﬁrst cut of all the dimensions is completed, it is time to take a look
at the facts. Start with facts that are straightforward and well understood.
Locate the transaction tables in the source systems where these facts are
captured. By studying the context of these facts in the source system, you can
see which dimensions will apply. The source system dependencies and keys
are helpful to understand the data itself. After you understand the facts, you

208
Part III
■Dealing with the Data
can just work your way through each of the dimensions to decide which will
apply. The dimension diagrams should still be hanging of the walls of the
conference room to facilitate discussion. You must specify the level of detail,
or grain, of each dimension for these speciﬁc facts.
T I P
Remember: It is important to write down questions and not get bogged
down during the sessions.
In order to avoid confusion, it is recommended that dimensions be placed
in a consistent manner around the fact group name in the hexagon. Typically,
start with the Date dimension and then place the others in a clockwise
fashion. The order of the dimensions should be of relative importance to the
business. The core dimensions, such as Customer and Product, should be after
the Date dimension. Dimensions that are only used by a limited number of
fact groups should be included around the ten o’clock position. Once the order
has been established, keep it consistent for all fact group diagrams. This helps
both the project team and the business users to quickly ﬁnd what they are
looking for.
It often takes three to ﬁve days to work through the dimensions and fact
groups to get the ﬁrst rough draft of the model. The time it takes depends upon
the number of sources being used, the total number of data elements included
in the model, the quality of documentation regarding the source data, and the
experience of the modeling team.
Documenting the Model
Begin documenting the diagrams electronically as soon as possible. The
longer you wait to begin this documentation, the harder it is and the less
accurate it becomes. The optimal case is to have someone begin creating the
diagrams during the modeling sessions. Depending upon how fast the model
is developing, the documenter may be able to keep pace. If not, it is helpful to
end the sessions with an hour left in the day to complete the documentation.
Logging Questions and Issues
It is also critical to log all of the questions electronically as they are noted. At the
end of the day, these issues should be reviewed, and the descriptions and word-
ing should be completed. Sometimes a quick note makes sense at the moment,
but the meaning may be lost completely a week or even a few days later.
The issue log should include an issue number, a topic, a full description,
the date, the person to whom the issue is assigned, the date the issue was
closed, and the current status of the issue. At this point in the process,
the issues do not need to be assigned. Over time, these will be assigned to

Chapter 7
■Modeling the Data for your Business
209
the appropriate people for follow-up. The discovery and resolution of each
issue should be included in the issue log. This provides a record of the
reasoning behind modeling decisions.
Building the Business Measures Worksheet
While developing the dimensional model, many different facts may be iden-
tiﬁed. Some are found as data elements that are stored in the source systems.
Sometimes the facts are the result of a calculation. These calculated facts are
called derived facts. Facts that can not be derived but need to be stored are called
base facts. The complete set of facts, base and derived, is referred to as business
measures. The base facts are typically what are included in the dimensional
model and stored in the database. Derived facts are typically calculated
on-the-ﬂy, when a report is created.
It is helpful to begin to compile the list of all the business measures that will
be needed while the dimensional model is being created. The list can be used
to do the following:
Review the derived facts to ensure that all of the base facts needed for
these calculations have been included in the model.
Determine whether a derived fact should be stored in the database, if
the calculation is extremely complex or time consuming. It may be more
efﬁcient to perform the calculation during the ETL process.
Set up the data access environment later, as described in Chapter 11.
Table 7-14 shows a sample of a business measures worksheet. The deﬁnition
of base columns must match the deﬁnition of that fact in the fact group
documentation. Note that the derived fact Average Minutes per Call must be
recalculated each time. It is not mathematically valid to apply an average to a
measure that is already an average.
These business measures can be reported by any attribute in any dimension
that applies to the base facts used in the calculation. It is not necessary
to document speciﬁc ways that each of these measures is to be reported.
For example, Total Hours Worked can be reported by any attribute in the
Date, Time, Customer, Employee, or Employee Task dimensions. The business
dimensional model and the Business Measures Worksheet can be used to
ensure that the required reports can be produced.
The business community is responsible for determining what business
measures they need. Members of the project team may be able to do some
background work to pull together a starter list of measures based upon reports
that have been requested. The most time-consuming part of developing this
worksheet is for the business community to agree on the ofﬁcial formulas
that are to be used. It can take several months for different groups across the

210
Part III
■Dealing with the Data
business to reach a consensus on these calculations. There may be legitimate
differences in how calculations are to be performed. If so, each different
calculation can be included in the Business Measures Worksheet with a unique
name. The description should also include details about when this version of
a measure should be used rather than another.

■Modeling the Data for your Business
211
Preliminary Source to Target Data Map
When developing the business dimensional model, use a spreadsheet that
contains all of the data elements from the source system that were identiﬁed
during detailed data analysis. For each element that was included in the
dimensional model, the name of the dimension or fact group should be noted.
In addition, for those data elements that were determined to have no reporting
or analytical value, this should also be noted. By keeping track of where these
elements are placed in the dimensional model, this can be used as an early
source-to-target data map to help with the ETL process, which is described in
Chapter 10.
The ﬁnal notes that need to be included are those about what additional
processing or transformations will need to be done during implementation to
get to the dimensional model representation. These are not the ﬁnal business
rules for processing, but notes about the discussions and perhaps ideas. The
ﬁnal business rules will be deﬁned later in the project.
After all of the dimensions and fact groups that were identiﬁed during
the initial brainstorming have been drafted, the ﬁrst cut of the business
dimensional model is done. There are still several weeks of work ahead, but
the basics are in place and it should be clear which areas still need the most
work.
Completing or Fleshing Out the Model
Once the initial draft of the model is completed, some of the hardest work
still lies ahead. The easiest and most straightforward data is already modeled.
Now, the hardest and most complex data must be studied. The model moves
toward completion by addressing issues, making sure that source data is
represented properly, and having business group reviews.
Working Through the Issues
As you developed the initial draft of the model, each of the detailed questions
and issues were logged. Now it is time to review these. Often, what seemed
like a very difﬁcult topic up front is actually easy to resolve. With the entire
model laid out, the placement of these other data elements is often clear. The
remaining issues tend to fall into three categories: those requiring technical
research, those requiring business research, and those that need further con-
sideration to see how they should be included in the model.
Often, nuanced knowledge of a source system database is only found with
key individuals who have been working with that data for years. Many of
the issues that need to be addressed require the insight of this experienced
systems resource. One member of the core data warehouse project team must

212
Part III
■Dealing with the Data
be assigned the responsibility of working with the key systems people to get
answers to these questions.
The second type of issue requires further business input. Again, someone
from the project team must be assigned responsibility for following up on these
issues. These can be the most challenging issues to resolve, and they often
require the business community to examine differences between various parts
of the organization (e.g., how business is accounted for literally in the general
ledger) or other basic integration principles. This project may be the ﬁrst time
that different groups have needed to face these issues. Often, the problems
have existed for years but have not been visible or have been ignored. Business
policy decisions take much longer to reach resolution than the other types
of issues you will work on. Resolving these issues can take a long time, and
they require that the appropriate business participants fully understand the
problem and then agree on a resolution.
The last type of issue has to do with modeling decisions. Usually the
business needs and the data are understood. The challenge is reﬂecting this in
the model. This may require research on modeling techniques or perhaps just
taking the time to think about the problem.
As decisions are made or questions are clariﬁed, this must all be documented
in the issue log. This is where all of the work being done by each of the
team members comes together. Topics that have been discussed at length
but resolved can be included in the log as documentation for the future.
This captures background information and what inﬂuenced important design
decisions.
Completing the Documentation
A very important part of documenting the model is ﬁlling in the dimensional
attribute deﬁnitions. This is time consuming, especially if the source system
does not have good documentation. This is best done by project team members
who understand the data and can express it in business terms. This is typically
a representative from the business community.
Working Through All the Data Elements
As the issues are being worked on, the model will continue to be reﬁned. As
the model evolves, continue to track the placement of the source system data
elements. This is needed to ensure that data is not inadvertently left out. Before
the model can be deemed complete, each data element from the source systems
must be placed in a dimension, a fact group, or designated as not included
(i.e., these are being left out intentionally). Elements are left out when they
not populated, obsolete, or are used for internal operations of the source
system.

Chapter 7
■Modeling the Data for your Business
213
Reﬁning the Model
As the project team works through the issues, the model can be updated
regularly. This may be daily or twice a week. The model updates can be made
and then shared with the rest of the team. The team must continue to alternate
between researching the issues and updating the model. Before everything is
ﬁnalized, but after the model has stabilized, it is important to begin getting
business input.
Business Reviews of the Model
It is important to get the true business perspective before the model is too far
along. Although the core project team includes at least one business analyst, it is
helpful to bring in one or two additional business people. These people should
be carefully chosen and be patient, tolerant of change, and be willing to work
with the project team. When including new people to review the dimensional
model, it is important to consider their perspective. Take into consideration
their exposure to the data warehouse project, their previous experience with
systems design or data modeling, and any speciﬁc areas of interest. For
example, business analysts for the claims department are not likely to have
an in-depth interest in policy quotes or agent commissions. Focus the dis-
cussion for this group on the claims-related data. Ideas for presenting the
dimensional model are highlighted in the accompanying sidebar text.
IDEAS FOR PRESENTING THE MODEL
■Basic dimensional modeling concepts should be reviewed. The audience
needs to have a basic understanding of dimensions and facts.
■It is helpful to present the model using an overhead projector and
transparencies. While this is rather low tech, it does enable changes to the
model to be seen by the entire group as they are made. Adding attributes
to the diagrams can be tricky, and it takes a moment to ﬁnd room, type
the label, and draw the arrow. The point is not to test the team on their
speed of diagramming in front of an audience, but to capture the ideas.
This is fastest with transparencies and a pen. This low tech approach
could be replaced with more high tech use of an electronic white board,
if available. Be sure to test the capabilities prior to review session.
■A common business question can be used to show the parts of the model
and how to use it. Walk through an example similar to that described in
the call center case study, working with the model. As each part of the
question is posed, show the appropriate dimension or fact group.
(continued)

214
Part III
■Dealing with the Data
IDEAS FOR PRESENTING THE MODEL (continued)
■An example that pertains to your own business is the most effec-
tive way for the group to fully understand the concepts.
■Once the group has this introduction, it is time to get into more
detail. Each of the dimensions needs to be presented and discussed.
Then, the fact groups must be reviewed. This is painstaking, but
necessary to ensure completeness and accuracy of the model.
■Share only the parts of the model of direct interest to the
audience. This helps to ensure their interest and keep them
from stepping out for a moment (often never to return).
■After looking through the model, get sample queries or report
ideas from the group. You can work through each question by
showing the pertinent dimension, identify which attribute would
be used, and then look at the fact group. Sometimes you can start
with a fact and then ﬁgure out what dimensions can be used.
Engaging in this type of dialogue is what validates the model.
■You can maintain the electronic documentation, the diagrams, and the
issue log during the session, but not on a machine with everyone watching.
Small Business Reviews
As the model is reﬁned, it is helpful to bring in even more business people for
small review sessions. These review sessions can focus on one area, perhaps
only on one or two of the dimensions, and the focus can be on their part of the
business. For example, for an insurance model, it can be helpful to review
the claims parts of the model with a different group than the policy adminis-
tration parts.
When Are You Done?
Continue working on the issue log, revising the model, and conducting
business reviews until you have addressed all of the issues. As you work
through the remaining open issues, the topics may be far outside of the scope
of the initial implementation. It is perfectly ﬁne to specify an issue to be
addressed in the future, as long as the entire project team agrees, including the
business representative(s).
When changes to the model are minor tweaks, rather than drastic revisions,
the model is nearly complete. New business questions or challenges are easily
met by walking through the model.

Chapter 7
■Modeling the Data for your Business
215
Gaining Final Commitment
The model should be presented to everyone who participated in the require-
ments gathering process. The meeting should be like the previous business
review sessions, and minimal changes should result from this session. Each
of the business people who participated in the development and reﬁnement of
the model need to play an active role in this session. It is much more effective to
have business-to-business dialogue about the model than for systems people
to feel they need to defend their work. If changes need to be made, this is still
a good time to do so.
If the model does indeed represent the business perspective, the audience
will be pleased, but perhaps not openly thrilled. This should be viewed as
success! It means that the model makes sense to them, which is the goal.
Expanding Business Data Over Time
Dimensional models do indeed change and expand over time. This happens
as a natural course of business. There are two common ways for dimensional
models to expand: enhancing dimensions and adding new facts.
Enhancing Dimensions
As more, newer, or cleaner sources become available, new attributes can be
added to existing dimensions. As long as these new attributes do not change
the grain of that dimension, there is no impact on existing fact groups. The
business community gains the ability to create new reports using any of the
existing facts.
Dimensions can be fairly easily rebuilt, as long as the dimension does not
have 50 million instances. If the dimension is extremely large, this can still be
done, but it requires some additional planning and time. Businesses that deal
with these extreme volumes are well versed in dealing with this much data, as
it pervades all systems development, not just data warehousing.
Adding More Fact Groups
Another common way that dimensional models expand is with the addition
of new fact groups. Usually this happens when new facts, often from new
data sources, are loaded. These new facts must be studied to determine their
dimensionality and grain. The new facts may be added to existing fact groups
as long as they have the same dimensionality and grain, although the technical
team may decide to implement these separately. New fact groups can be added
without impacting or changing any of the existing fact groups. Existing users
of the data warehouse may not see any change. The new data can be released
to only those who need access to it. Of course, all dimensions used by the
existing and new fact groups must be conformed.

216
Part III
■Dealing with the Data
Reﬂecting on Business Realities: Advanced
Concepts
For many people, the basic dimensional modeling concepts presented so
far will be sufﬁcient for their needs. For those who want to learn about
dimensional modeling in more detail or who are about to participate in the
modeling process, several additional topics are included here. This is not
intended to make you a dimensional modeler, but it describes techniques that
you can use to address many common, complicated situations. The business
dimensional model notation to identify these situations is presented. This
notation provides the technical team with an indication that a condition exists.
Standard dimensional modeling techniques can then be used to complete the
actual database design.
Supporting Multiple Perspectives: Multiple Hierarchies
It is a common misconception that all groups within the organization must
agree on the structure and content of one hierarchy. Not only is this not
true, but multiple hierarchies are encouraged because this enables multiple
viewpoints to be represented in the model. In the Date dimension presented
earlier (refer to Figure 7-3), note that there are two hierarchies: one to support
the calendar year rollup and one to support the ﬁscal year rollup.
Another example of the beneﬁts of multiple perspectives can be seen for
customers. In this example, the ‘‘ship to’’ location is what is called Customer.
Figure 7-15 shows multiple customer hierarchies: the customer’s location, the
customer’s bill to location and the company’s sales organization hierarchies.
Each hierarchy is diagrammed separately in the business dimensional model
so that each is clearly visible. It is important to ensure that each is labeled
uniquely.
Tracking Changes in the Dimension: Slowly Changing
Dimensions
Most of the data in the data warehouse that is tracked over time are facts.
This is a natural and basic part of dimensional modeling. However, there will
be changes to values in dimensions that need to be addressed. There are also
cases where the dimensional attributes must be captured at the time that a
business event occurred. There are technical techniques to address tracking
these dimension changes over time.
From a business perspective, you need to evaluate which changes must
be recorded and kept. If a person’s name changes, is that important for
analytical results? Perhaps not. In many cases, the current value of an attribute

Chapter 7
■Modeling the Data for your Business
217
is sufﬁcient. In other cases, and for some industries, these changes must be
tracked over time. For example, the characteristics of an insurance policy
must be kept as they were at the time of an accident to accurately track and
understand claims data. It is not correct to show last year’s claim with this
year’s policy characteristics. This is an example of capturing the dimensional
data at the time that a business event occurs. The business dimensional model
can note when the dimensional data must be tracked over time.

Slowly changing dimensions is the terminology that is used in the data
warehousing industry for dealing with these dimension attributes. There are
several different ways to address these changes, depending upon the business
requirements. The business dimensional model has notation to assist with this.
By default, all dimensional attributes are expected to contain only the
current value. This is called a Type 1 slowly changing dimension. Tracking
point-in-time history is called a Type 2 slowly changing dimension and is
diagrammed differently. The attribute is shown with a shadow that appears
as if there are versions. Figure 7-16 shows an example of a dimension that
requires versioning. This technique creates a version of that dimension data at
each point in time of interest.
To better deﬁne these requirements, the business must decide which
attribute changes should trigger a new version. If there are 100 attributes of an
individual policyholder, is a new version needed when any of these change?
Perhaps you only need a new version when an attribute that is used as a policy
rating factor changes, such as marital status or student grade point average.

The business must consider that there is a cost associated with this version-
ing. There should be a balance between implementation complexity, cost to
implement, and the business value of doing this. That’s not to say this should
be avoided, but it should be approached practically.
T I P
For more information about the detailed implementation options for slowly
changing dimensions, please refer to The Data Warehouse Toolkit, Second Edition
(Wiley, 2002).
Depicting the Existence of a Relationship: Factless Fact
Tables
There are several cases where the relationship between the dimensions is
important but there is no measurable fact. This is called a factless fact group or
table in dimensional modeling. One example of a factless fact group is tracking
daily student attendance, as shown in Figure 7-17. What is tracked is whether
a student was in class (described as a course section) with a teacher at a school
on a speciﬁc day. The existence of the event is what is important, but there is no
way at present to measure a student’s level of attention. We are not able to say
that a student was only 63% attentive, so no fact is needed. The design team
may decide to include an artiﬁcial fact. This would be the fact of attendance,
where the value is always 1.
Other common factless fact groups include the following:
Product coverage: What products are in a store on promotion? This is
needed to determine which products were promoted but did not sell.
Approved vendors: What products can be purchased from which
vendors?

Of course, your business may have facts that would be included in these
fact groups. Just because these are included as examples here does not mean
that they must be factless.
N O T E A factless fact table is a complex associative entity from other data mod-
eling techniques. For data warehousing, this relationship is tracked over time,
so there is a need for a date too. While there is not a speciﬁc fact coming from the
source system, it can be helpful to include an artiﬁcial fact, which is always set to 1.
This can ensure that the business intelligence tools properly interact with this table.
Linking Parts of a Transaction: Degenerate Dimensions
Sometimes all of the interesting attributes to describe a business transaction
are placed into other dimensions but there is still one important piece of data
left over: the transaction identiﬁer. The degenerate dimension is not the same as
a single attribute dimension. The degenerate dimension value is an identiﬁer
for each speciﬁc transaction. A single attribute dimension would contain a list
of possible values that further describe the transaction, such as a transaction
type—for example, containing the values of open claim, closed claim, or claim
payment.
This transaction identiﬁer must be retained in order to be able to pull
together the different parts of a single business transaction. For example, to
implement purchase order line-item detail, you still need to know that all of
the items belong to the same purchase order. Because this is an important
piece of data but is not a fact, this must be considered a dimension. However,
this special case is called a degenerate dimension. Figure 7-18 shows the fact
group that includes the Purchase Order dimension.

Degenerate Dimension
Other situations that often result in a degenerate dimension include the
following:

items that were purchased at the same time. The ticket number is needed
to support market basket analysis, to see what products are purchased
together.
Call Center example: Earlier in the chapter, the Call Transaction dimen-
sion is degenerate. This enables the tracking of calls even if multiple

■Modeling the Data for your Business
221
call outcomes are possible, such as placing an order or asking about an
existing order. This also helps track a single customer call if the call must
be transferred to another customer service representative to address the
customer’s needs.
Pulling Together Components: Junk Dimensions
In some instances, several single attributes don’t really ﬁt into another dimen-
sion. Sometimes this happens when these attributes relate in a general way
but do not have a single lowest-level attribute to deﬁne the grain of a new
dimension. Sometimes, you simply ﬁnd yourself with a handful of attributes
‘‘left over’’ and need to ﬁnd a home for them. These can be grouped together
into a single dimension called a junk dimension. A new attribute must be
introduced to provide a single attribute to place at the lowest level of this
junk dimension. This new attribute is called a derived attribute, and it is created
solely for the data warehouse. This derived attribute will not be found in any
of the underlying source systems.
An example of a junk dimension is diagrammed in Figure 7-19. The derived
attribute is shown as a trapezoid. A customer demographic proﬁle can be
designed as a junk dimension.

The relationship between the customer demographic proﬁle and the cus-
tomer is captured via a fact table. The relationship itself can be designed as a
factless fact table, with the customer, customer demographics, and date that
this relationship was observed. This could also be recorded as part of a sales
transaction via a Sales fact group.

■Dealing with the Data
N O T E
A derived attribute may be stored at the physical level but not displayed
to the business users.
A derived attribute can also be created to tie together parts within a
dimension in order to facilitate reporting. This is useful when, for example,
you have three important identiﬁers that are used alone and together such
as Line of Business, Company, and Risk for an insurance policy dimension.
Figure 7-20 shows this derived attribute within the body of a dimension.

Multiple Instances of a Dimension: Role Playing
There are many transactions whereby what originally seems like a single
dimension occurs multiple times for a fact group. This must be fully explored
to ensure that this is really the case. If so, each needs to be identiﬁed for
query and analysis purposes as a separate role for that dimension. In order to
minimize confusion, each attribute must be uniquely labeled. Typically, this
means that each attribute must have a preﬁx to clarify which role is being
represented.
One of the most common instances of role playing is for the Date dimen-
sion. Is it common for a single business transaction—say, for a product
shipment—to have multiple dates. These would include the product order
date and the product ship date. Figure 7-21 shows the two separate dimen-
sions, whereas Figure 7-22 shows that each role of the dimension is included
in the fact group diagram.

Another example of a role-playing dimension might be a school district that
is responsible for educating a student. There is a district, usually where the
student resides, that is legally responsible for educating that student. In some
cases, a student is actually receiving instruction from a different school district,
perhaps for special services or because a parent works for the other district.

The business dimensional model should be easily printed on 8 1/2’’ by 11’’
paper. By storing the diagrams and tables in a word processing document,
many users can print it without requiring special software. A few additional
notations can be used to make the model easier to read.
Dimension Connectors
If you have a dimension that has too many attributes to ﬁt on a single page,
you can diagram the dimension across multiple pages. The best way to do
this is to include the basic, most important attributes on the main page. Then
use a connector, as shown in Figure 7-23, to link to the other pages. Try to
group the attributes on each page based upon their meaning. For example,
if you are trying to represent a dimension for all the different products that
are purchased by a large enterprise, you might group the attributes by ofﬁce
supplies, ofﬁce furniture, and electronic equipment. There would then be a
separate page with the attributes speciﬁc to ofﬁce supplies, ofﬁce furniture,
and electronic equipment.

Clusters of Future Attributes
The notation for an attribute that is needed in the future is a dotted rectangle.
This is effective when speciﬁc attributes are deﬁned. However, in some cases
many possible attributes could be helpful but they are not yet deﬁned. This can
occur when the source of data does not exist yet or the source is completely out
of scope. It may still be helpful to capture the team’s ideas about where these
would ﬁt in the future. Figure 7-24 shows a cloud to represent this cluster of
future attributes.

If these future attributes are needed to support the core purpose of your
project, you have a serious problem that needs to be addressed immediately.
Otherwise, noting the placement of these attributes gives you a great head
start when these are fully deﬁned in the future. It also increases the conﬁdence
of users that you haven’t forgotten their ideas.

Taking the Model Forward
Now that the business dimensional model has been reviewed and approved
by the business community, it is time to move forward into more traditional
systems activities. While this is not intended to provide full technical detail of
such activities, it will highlight the steps needed to take the model forward.
This section is intended to assist the project team in understanding what
happens next on the project.
Translating the Business Dimensional Model
The business dimensional model can be implemented in a variety of tech-
nologies. If all of the data will be loaded into a multi-dimensional cube or
other proprietary database, then no logical table design is needed, but it may
be necessary to decide at which levels of detail you want to store the facts.
If the business dimensional model is to be implemented in a typical rela-
tional database, then additional design decisions must be made. The business
dimensional model must be translated into logical table structures. The next

Chapter 7
■Modeling the Data for your Business
227
section describes this process. This is straightforward, as the biggest challenge,
understanding the business, has already been addressed.
Dimension Table Design
Each business dimension will become a single dimension table, and each
dimension table should have a single surrogate key. This is a unique non-
meaningful identiﬁer that is assigned to each row in that dimension. Each
business attribute is represented as a column on that dimension table. In some
cases, a business attribute can be translated into several columns. An attribute
of Vendor may be included on the table as Vendor Code, Vendor Short Name,
and Vendor Name. Each of these may be represented in the business dimen-
sional model, but these are really just different labels for the same true business
attribute. If it helps reduce confusion, each should be included in the model
diagrams. If there are too many attributes for that dimension (some can have
over ﬁfty), then it may clean things up to only show the business attribute
once and introduce these additional details in the table design.
Using the call center case study from earlier in the chapter, Figure 7-26
shows what the Employee dimension would look like as a table stored in a
relational database.

■Dealing with the Data
Translating Fact Groups
A fact group often translates to a fact table. However, from an implementation
perspective, you may decide to split a fact group into more than one physical
fact table. This is typically done if the facts come from different sources or the
timing of the data’s availability differs. In these cases, splitting the fact group
may offer efﬁciencies during the staging process. Regardless of how the facts
are physically stored, the ﬁrst thing to understand is the dimensionality and
grain.
Each fact group will translate to a fact table. The primary key from each
dimension that applies to the fact group will be stored on the fact table. After
the keys, each fact becomes a column on the fact table. Figure 7-27 shows the
Call Center Calls fact group translated into the logical table.

TIME KEY

A primary key is a unique identiﬁer of a row in a relational table. When
the primary key is used as a link to another table, it is called a foreign key in the
second table.
The logical key of the fact table is comprised of all the foreign keys from
the dimension tables included in that fact group. For the Call Center fact table
(refer to Figure 7-27), the logical key is comprised of the Date Key, Time Key,
Customer Key, Employee Key, Call Transaction Key, and Call Outcome Key.
In general, there is no need to create a separate surrogate key for the fact table.
This would not be used for processing queries.
Physical Database Design
Minimal design work is needed to move between a logical design and a
physical database design. This is typically the step where performance con-
siderations are taken into account. Because a dimensional model addresses

Chapter 7
■Modeling the Data for your Business
229
query performance as one primary purpose of the design approach, not much
is needed other than some physical decisions such as physical partitioning and
indexing strategies.
In Real Life
There are many challenges in creating a dimensional model. Some of the
common ones can be observed in the big and small company groups we have
been following.
A Glimpse into Giant Co.
In this organization, members of the enterprise modeling team do most of the
modeling. The modelers are responsible for all databases, be they operational
or data warehouses. Most of their experience is with operational system design.
In addition, the modeling effort is being done without participation from the
business community. The business was involved in providing requirements,
but the interaction between them and IT ended there. Because initial involve-
ment is all that is expected from them for other systems design, that is all that
was expected of them for the DW project.
The challenge is that the modelers are not well versed in thinking dimension-
ally; and with no direct business interaction, many of the basic dimensional
modeling principles may be overlooked or ignored. The ﬁnal data model is to
be presented to several select representatives from the business community.
This is mostly a formality and few changes are expected to result from this
session.
To overcome these challenges, the process to develop a data model was
reﬁned to accommodate dimensional modeling best practices. This includes
steps to ensure participation of business representatives during the modeling
process and for reviews. This required the executive business sponsor to sup-
port the data warehouse project team’s effort to get these changes put in place.
Now the enterprise modeling procedures include data warehouse–speciﬁc
steps. This helps not only this project, but also future projects too.
Insight from Agile, Inc.
At this company, everyone is used to jumping right in to get things done. In
fact, that is what happened during the ﬁrst attempt to build a data mart. The
team gathered a few reports that were needed and turned them over to IT.
There was a quick database design effort, but not really a full data modeling
effort, and the design was not documented. Construction began, but as each
report was studied in more detail, this required changes to the data structures

230
Part III
■Dealing with the Data
and modiﬁcations to the ETL processing. This happened repeatedly, which
frustrated the project team members and the business group waiting for their
reports.
After weeks of running in circles, the project team took a moment to review
what was happening. It was determined that too many resources and time had
been wasted already and a long-term solution was not in sight. The project
team enlisted the help of the business champion to reﬁne the project plan
by going back to develop a robust data model. This required invoking the
change control process. Key business analysts were assigned to help with the
modeling process. The model was successfully completed and well received
by the rest of the business community. Everyone is anxious for the database to
be built so that they can begin to use it.
Summary
Developing a sound data model up front sets the stage for success. Dimensional
modeling helps to organize data for reporting and analysis, often directly by
the business audience. In order to facilitate business use, it is important
that the model reﬂect the business perspective. The business dimensional
model diagrams help to capture this perspective. A proven process to develop
the dimensional model was also presented. The dimensional model can be
implemented in a variety of different technologies.
Useful information is uncovered during the modeling process and can
be used to bridge to subsequent stages of a data warehouse project. The
preliminary source-to-target data map captures details that will be needed to
develop the ETL system. Similarly, the Business Measures Worksheet content
is needed to set up the data delivery. Before discussing these subsequent
steps, the next chapter spends a bit more time looking at data-related topics,
including information management, data governance, and data quality.

Managing Data As a Corporate
Asset
‘‘Data as a corporate asset’’—what does that really mean? In simple terms,
any asset a business owns must contribute to the success of that business
or it is not really an asset. Many businesses have assets on their books that
are not making a positive impact on the success of the business. If you add
up the total investment in data, including operational systems to run your
business, business intelligence systems to manage your business, staff to build,
maintain, and use these systems, it will probably be one of the largest assets
on your books. Is all this data you collect really working for you? Is it really a
corporate asset? How can you turn data into a real asset?
This chapter is an introduction to information management concepts and
principles, which provide the mechanism to turn data into a corporate asset.
This is accomplished through strong partnerships between business and IT
communities and corporate commitment. The topics covered here include the
following:
Understanding master data management
Data governance
Understanding data ownership
What ‘‘high data quality’’ means and how to get it
Ideas for setting up a data dictionary
Practical steps to get started with information management
These concepts are brieﬂy introduced in this chapter, but are not intended
to provide a comprehensive guide. Many other resources are available for
any readers who are interested in learning more about these concepts and
how to develop and execute a comprehensive information management
strategy.

■Dealing with the Data
What Is Information Management?
Data is what you collect and store. When that data is interpreted and used, it
is turned into information. Companies that can effectively transform data into
valuable information that is used to make business decisions are utilizing their
data as an asset. A computer can be considered a corporate asset, yet it does
not provide value until it is used; the same is true for your data. If you look
at a group of competing companies, chances are good that the ones that have
ﬁgured out how to turn data into valuable information and act on it are at the
top of their industry.
Sometimes the terms and acronyms used across business and IT can be a
bit overwhelming. Most terms can have multiple deﬁnitions depending on the
context and scope of the discussion. Information management is no different.
For this discussion, we’ll use Wikipedia’s deﬁnition:
Information management (IM) is the collection and management of information
from one or more sources and the distribution of that information to one or more
audiences. This sometimes involves those who have a stake in, or a right to,
that information. Management means the organization of and control over the
structure, processing, and delivery of information.
The ﬁrst step in information management is focusing on the data itself. Data
is the fundamental building block of the entire process, and the core asset.
However, information management poses many challenges beyond simply
sharing data between application systems. Information management also
encompasses the people and business processes that are needed to ensure that
the data is collected and handled properly. Figure 8-1 shows these different
facets of information management, which include the organization’s business
applications, the data warehouse, business processes, data governance, data
proﬁling, and master data management.

■Managing Data As a Corporate Asset
233
In order to facilitate understanding of the entire chapter, it is worth looking
at basic deﬁnitions of these now. Again, due to the prevalence of existing
terminology, the following deﬁnitions are shared via Wikipedia:
Master data management (MDM): In computing, master data manage-
ment comprises a set of processes and tools that consistently deﬁnes
and manages the nontransactional data entities of an organization (also
called reference data). MDM has the objective of providing processes for
collecting, aggregating, matching, consolidating, quality-assuring, per-
sisting, and distributing such data throughout an organization to ensure
consistency and control in the ongoing maintenance and application use
of this information. At a basic level, MDM seeks to ensure that an orga-
nization does not use multiple (potentially inconsistent) versions of the
same master data in different parts of its operations, which can occur in
large organizations.
Data governance: This refers to a quality control discipline for assessing,
managing, using, improving, monitoring, maintaining, and protect-
ing organizational information1. It is a system of decision rights and
accountabilities for information-related processes, executed according to
agreed-upon models that describe who can take what actions with what
information, and when, under what circumstances, using what methods2.
Data governance encompasses the people, processes, and information
technology required to create consistent and proper handling of an organi-
zation’s data across the business enterprise, including the following
goals:
Increasing consistency and conﬁdence in decision making
Decreasing the risk of regulatory ﬁnes
Improving data security
Maximizing the income generation potential of data
Designating accountability for information quality
These goals are realized by the implementation of data governance pro-
grams, or initiatives. Data governance initiatives improve data quality
by assigning a team that will be responsible for the data’s accuracy,
accessibility, consistency, and completeness, among other metrics. This
team usually consists of executive leadership, project management,
line-of-business managers, and data stewards.

■Dealing with the Data
Data quality: Data is of high quality ‘‘if [it is] ﬁt for [its] intended uses in
operations, decision making, and planning’’ (J. M. Juran). Alternatively,
data is deemed of high quality if it correctly represents the real-world
construct to which it refers. These two views can often be in disagreement,
even about the same set of data used for the same purpose.
Data quality refers to the degree of excellence exhibited by the data in
relation to the portrayal of the actual phenomena (GIS Glossary).
The state of completeness, validity, consistency, timeliness and accu-
racy that makes data appropriate for a speciﬁc use (Government of
British Columbia).
Data quality: The processes and technologies involved in ensuring the
conformance of data values to business requirements and acceptance
criteria.
Data proﬁling: This is the process of examining the data available in an
existing data source (e.g., a database or a ﬁle) and collecting statistics and
information about that data. The purpose of these statistics may include
the following:
Determine whether the existing data can easily be used for other pur-
poses.
Provide metrics on data quality, including whether the data conforms
to company standards.
Assess the risk involved in integrating data for new applications,
including the challenges of joins.
Track data quality.
Assess whether metadata accurately describes the actual values in the
source database.
Understand data challenges early in any data-intensive project in order
to avoid late project surprises. Finding data problems late in the project
can incur time delays and project cost overruns.
Have an enterprise view of all data, for uses such as master data
management, for which key data is needed, or data governance, for
improving data quality.
Some companies also look at data proﬁling as a way to involve busi-
ness users in what traditionally has been an IT function. Line-of-business
users can often provide context about the data, giving meaning to columns
of data that are poorly deﬁned by metadata and documentation.
Beyond simply working with the data, information management must
also address the organization’s business processes. Business processes come

Chapter 8
■Managing Data As a Corporate Asset
235
in a variety of ﬂavors, from understanding how the business itself runs
to processes that are added to speciﬁcally address the capture and main-
tenance of data needed for operational purposes and analytical purposes.
Some examples of challenges that can affect business processes and impact
information management include the following:
Understanding and deﬁning which group is responsible for ensuring that
data about new customers is collected and entered properly
Procedures regarding how changes to existing products are handled,
including when a new product number is assigned, and who is responsible
for updating the characteristics of the product packaging
Procedures to ensure consistent and accurate data capture at the time of
capture
Handling and reporting of data errors. This can be used to understand
gaps exist between what the system is expecting and what is being
provided. This may require system changes or education for the people
entering the data.
Systematically checking the quality of the mailing addresses
These are just a few examples of things that can affect the business processes
and impact information management. They are described in more detail in the
sections on data quality and data governance.
Delivering high-quality data should be the primary goal of information
management processes. The design of information management processes
depends on a number of factors, including the following:
Size of your organization
Complexity of your business
Quality of your source systems
Current business processes
Political nature of your organization
The next section shares an example of information management in action to
facilitate an understanding from a data perspective.
Information Management Example—Customer Data
In order to highlight how data should be managed, this section looks at an
example of how a consumer direct retail organization can move from not
having an integrated information management strategy to an environment
with efﬁcient information management processes. This example starts by
describing how customer data is currently being handled, followed by ways

to improve. Figure 8-2 shows the original state of a logical business ﬂow of
customer data from consumer marketing through customer payments. This is

Figure 8-2 Non-integrated customer data ﬂow
First, a promotional mailing is sent out to select customers and prospects
using the Marketing Prospect and Master Customer Database. This generates
orders, as shown in step two. Customer data is entered into the order entry
system. The ﬁrst step in taking an order is capturing the customer’s name.
If there are not too many customers waiting on hold, an initial search of
the customers in the order entry system is done. The search screens are
cumbersome and slow. If a name is not found or too many are found, the
customer service representatives often enter this as a new customer. It is well
known that there are duplicate entries of this data, but that is ignored so the
order can be quickly captured, the product delivered, and more calls handled.
This same customer table is also used by the Shipments application in step 3.
Once a shipment is made, the customer is billed for the purchased products,
in step 4. Basic customer data is fed to the Customer Billing application, but a
separate copy is maintained. There is no real business purpose for keeping a
separate copy; this is simply how the applications have been developed over

Chapter 8
■Managing Data As a Corporate Asset
237
the years. If any changes are made to the data about a customer during the
billing process, the data is updated only in the Customer Billing database.
In step 5, the customer data ﬂows with the billing data into the third-party
Financial Package. This package provides the accounts receivable, accounts
payable, and general ledger functionality. All applications within this
third-party software package use a common set of customer data.
Finally, in step 6, a new set of customer data is captured when feedback is
received—via phone calls, e-mails, and letters. The data that is captured in
step 6 is independent of the other processes and is not tied to any of the other
processes. This is not a recommended information management strategy, but
it reﬂects how customer data exists in the current systems.
The fact that there are multiple copies of customer data is quite common.
Each application was designed and developed independently over a long
period of time. Time and budget constraints often limit the ability of application
development teams to ensure enterprise integration of customer data.
Information management takes a broader view by looking at the data
across all application systems. Information management is concerned with
integration and interoperability between the different systems. Improvements
to how data ﬂows between different parts of the organization can be made with
business process changes and some small system enhancements. Figure 8-3
highlights where these improvements can be made.

■Dealing with the Data
The ﬁrst change is to improve the customer search capability and speed up
the order entry system. Adding a search alternative by customer number or
home phone number can increase the number of existing customers who are
identiﬁed. The customer service representatives are also trained regarding the
importance of identifying existing customers. Additional discounts may be
offered for these repeat customers once they are identiﬁed.
In many cases, it is not feasible to make signiﬁcant changes to the order
entry system. What can change is how the system is used. A little research
into how application systems work often yields functionality that is not being
used. In this case, the capability to automatically ﬂag changes to customer data
is enabled if the proper check box is marked on the entry screen. The customer
service representatives need to be trained to check that box to ﬂag any new
or changed customers so that the changes can be automatically fed to other
systems. While employees may resist having another task to do, the overall
value can be emphasized.
More changes could be made by looking at each of the other application
systems. Most important is setting up automated ﬂows on a regular (hourly,
daily, weekly) basis to enable the most current data to be shared across the
organization.
Taking a more aggressive approach, the customer data ﬂow shown earlier
could be revised so that a single customer database is used by all of the
applications, as shown in Figure 8-4. This diagram demonstrates how all
of these applications, from marketing through the ﬁnancials, can tap into a
single set of customer data. The marketing prospects are still maintained by
marketing and ﬂow to and from the centralized customer data. Note that
the master customer database has been replaced completely with a link to the
central customer data.
Additionally, this overall view addresses the need to collect data for all
purposes, not just for a single application system. You don’t need to know
how the customer heard about a discount to capture his or her order, but
in order to evaluate a promotion’s overall effectiveness, you need to ask
customers how they heard about the promotion and enter their response. This
approach is also part of a master data management process, which is discussed
later in this chapter.
While this last option has great appeal, most organizations get started with
a blended approach of business process changes and system changes. Over
time, progress can be made toward this vision for centralized, shared data.
The preceding example is a conﬁned microcosm of a real corporate environ-
ment. Information management does not just happen. It comes about through
a conscious, dedicated effort on the part of the entire organization. It cannot
happen simply by having the IT people build systems to ﬁx the problems. Suc-
cessful information management environments demand a strong partnership
between business and IT, as discussed in Chapter 4. This requires an in-depth

Chapter 8
■Managing Data As a Corporate Asset
239
understanding of the business, how it works, and why it works that way. It
also requires that you take a good look at how your business functions are
currently set up. If there is a great deal of autonomy for each function, then you
are likely to ﬁnd a lot of segregation between the systems that support each
function. Changes may be needed to your business processes to better support
an overall information management strategy. This example is focused on the
data itself. In order to attain the vision of integrated data, there is much more
involved than changing application systems. It involves the many different
facets mentioned earlier.

IM Beyond the Data Warehouse
Information management often comes to the surface when data warehouse
initiatives are being discussed. Data warehousing is certainly part of an overall
information management strategy, but it is not the whole thing. Information
management encompasses all systems, operational and analytical.
In fact, the more comprehensive information management practices you
have in place, the easier it is to build a data warehouse. This is because things

240
Part III
■Dealing with the Data
such as the deﬁnition and meaning of core data are already agreed upon
and documented, other systems within the organization have already adopted
these standards, and the primary sources for reference data are clear.
Without a comprehensive information management practice, much of the
development work that is done on a data warehouse project is integrating and
cleaning up the data as it comes into the data warehouse. This results in a
consistent view for reporting and analysis, but the underlying data problems
still exist. Each time data is loaded, the processes to clean up the data are run
again.
Reﬂecting back on the customer data example in Figure 8-2, corrections are
made only within the sphere of that single application, and are not ﬁxed at the
source. This can create confusion and may negatively affect customer relations.
The company appears disorganized, and customers may be frustrated that a
change must be requested multiple times, at different points in the process. A
solid information management process helps eliminate the redundancy and
incorrect information, improving overall customer relations.
Master Data Management
There has been a surge of interest in master data management (MDM). Master
data management can seem like an intimidating and daunting task, but it
doesn’t have to be. Master data is core reference data that describes the key
components of your business that must be used in a consistent manner across
your entire company. For customers, this may include their name, mailing
address, primary residence, income, education level, and other demographics.
For employees, you would have similar data, as well as hire date, employment
type (hourly or salaried), and professional qualiﬁcations. Product reference
data typically includes details about the product such as size or ﬂavor, dimen-
sions of packages, and packaging material type. Many different processes
and application systems in the company, including product development,
manufacturing, marketing, sales, and distribution, need this basic reference
data.
This basic reference data is called master data. Master data management
is how the organization deals with the collection and maintenance of this
enterprise reference data. Common master data is reﬂected as conformed
dimensions in the data warehouse. Conformed dimensions are discussed in
more detail in Chapter 7.
As in our customer example, many different applications need access to
customer information, and typically each application has its own reference
data. This means that there are multiple copies of customer data, including

Chapter 8
■Managing Data As a Corporate Asset
241
address and contact information that may or may not be consistent. The same
data element name may be used by different applications to capture and
store different data. Perhaps each application uses a different business rule
to determine whether the customer qualiﬁes as a ‘‘premier customer.’’ There
may also be duplicate customer data within and/or across applications. To
make matters even more complicated, each application may have a different
subset of customers.
This can create severe problems for an organization. From an operations
perspective, this can result in confusion and duplication of work. The sales
department may contact a customer to offer a product promotion and be told
not to call again until next summer. The next day, with no knowledge of the
previous call, a service representative may call the same person to offer a
discount on preventative maintenance services. Needless to say, that customer
is likely to be annoyed by your company’s lack of coordination.
In addition to negatively affecting the company’s image, there is a signiﬁcant
cost associated with maintaining this data in so many places. There is the
base cost for each application to capture the data and store it, and there is
additional cost to get a consolidated view of your customers. Each time you
need a consolidated view of your customers, you need to pull the customer
lists from each system, combine them, eliminate duplicates, and clean them
before any real analysis can be done. Prior to the implementation of a data
warehouse, this is often done on a periodic—perhaps quarterly—basis, in
order to create reports.
The overall objective of master data management is to provide common
reference data to all applications across the enterprise. This means that each
application uses the core customer data as the source of customer information
for its processing and to, in turn, update the customer reference data with new
information learned from business transactions in that system. This provides
a single source for this core data. The business must decide which depart-
ments and/or application systems are allowed to change the master reference
data.
You need a high level of coordination to keep applications from corrupting
reference data needed for different purposes. For example, to support customer
mailings, the marketing department wants to store a preferred ﬁrst name. This
may be a nickname. However, if that same ﬁeld is used to validate credit
card information, this will create problems. Often the personal preferences
are different from the legal names used for ﬁnancial transactions. The way to
address these challenges is to identify the different purposes and store both
versions: the legal ﬁrst name and the preferred ﬁrst name.
Figure 8-5 shows how the reference data is shared across applications, while
the transaction data used remains within that application’s own database.

Master Data Feeds the Data Warehouse
Once master data management is in place, it provides an excellent source for
the data warehouse. It makes it easier to build the dimensions of a DW using
master reference data. This can also assist with the integration of fact data
from multiple sources. All sources that use the master reference data can be
integrated using these common keys, although this does not eliminate all of the
challenges. For example, sometimes data from different systems is stored at
different levels of detail, but when integrating data, it must be at the same level
of detail. Therefore, the data with less detail must be able to be aggregated
to the common higher level in order to combine it for reporting. Much of
the work that is done in data cleansing and during the integration steps of the
extract, transform, and load (ETL) process has already been accomplished in
the source systems through their use of the common master data.
As with most things discussed in this book, it is very important to identify
and engage the right resources needed to deﬁne and collect master reference
data. This takes a continued strong partnership between the business and IT
to be successful.
Finding the Right Resources
It turns out that as companies are embarking on master data management
efforts, they turn to the data warehouse teams to ﬁnd the talent needed to get

Chapter 8
■Managing Data As a Corporate Asset
243
the job done. The people in the organization who have already been looking
at integration of data from multiple systems and taking an enterprise view
of the business world are indeed the members of the data warehouse team.
The neccessary business knowledge often resides within this team. Depending
upon the maturity of the data warehouse environment, your company may
have the beginnings of the master reference data needed for analysis. This
team can also be helpful in recruiting members from the business community
and the operational systems teams.
Ultimately, a team that can represent the requirements for core reference
data across the enterprise is needed to successfully implement a master data
management program. A core part of this team will also be involved in
data governance, which, again, requires a strong partnership between busi-
ness and IT.
Data Governance
Recall from earlier in the chapter that data governance initiatives improve
data quality by assigning a team to be responsible for the data’s accuracy,
accessibility, consistency, and completeness, among other metrics. This team
usually consists of executive leadership, project management, line-of-business
managers, and data stewards.
Data governance is not a project but a cultural shift. As you can see from the
roles listed above, in order for data governance to be successful, there must
be a strong commitment and partnership between business and IT. At a high
level, data governance is a set of business processes and procedures needed
to ensure that the data is captured accurately and processed appropriately.
Without a strong data governance initiative it is difﬁcult for an organization
to truly view its data as a corporate asset.
Data Ownership
Several similar terms are used for the ideas presented in this discussion: data
ownership, data stewardship, and data custodianship. They all deﬁne the
responsibility of making decisions about how to deﬁne, process, and handle
data. Your organization should pick the one that resonates best with your
people.
Historically, the responsibility for making these decisions about how to
process and handle data has often defaulted to the systems professionals who
are developing or maintaining the application system. This is not usually a
conscious decision, but just how things have fallen into place over the years.
Too often the business community does not understand what data ownership
is and how it impacts them, therefore, the business typically has not stepped

244
Part III
■Dealing with the Data
up to this role. Remember that true success in this environment is more easily
achieved through a solid partnership between business and IT. It is time to
take a step back and reassess how data ownership is handled.
Who Really Owns the Data?
‘‘Owns’’ is a strong word, but someone must have the responsibility of
managing and shepherding this process. There is usually some confusion about
who really owns the data within an organization. Often, no one steps forward
to claim data ownership, or, conversely, multiple groups claim ownership,
including different business areas and systems.
Data is a by-product of how the business is run. Although systems profes-
sionals develop the applications that enable the business to keep running, the
business community is responsible for driving what functions and rules are
used for running the business. The business should drive the organization’s
capability and function. For example, the accountants must set forth the criteria
that constitute a legal accounting transaction, not the developers. Likewise,
the business decides and drives what data must be captured, how it is to be
used to keep the company running, and what is needed for reporting and
analysis.
Often, people avoid being named an owner of anything. ‘‘Data ownership’’
sounds ominous and is perceived as just more work, or sometimes as being
assigned an impossible task. Too often these responsibilities are assigned with
no additional time, resources, or funding given to the data owner. Ownership
often already exists, but usually informally. Think about who you would
ask about the real meaning of the ﬁnancial account structure. Who knows the
most about details of insurance claim payments? The person who pops into
your mind ﬁrst is often the acting data owner.
Another way to try to identify business data ownership is to track the
path for resolving data problems. The person who has to sift through a
report presented to upper management with misleading or incorrect data is
a candidate data owner. The data owner may already be identiﬁed as a subject
matter expert (SME). It may be best to ease into this by simply identifying
the primary business contact for the different types of data. If ‘‘ofﬁcial’’ data
ownership is too vague or unclear for business people to accept, then start by
identifying primary contacts for the different kinds of data. Table 8-1 shows a
sample of how data ownership can be tracked.
This process can be implemented at several levels. To get started, it may
be helpful to identify ownership for an entire business application system, a
module within a system, or a speciﬁc table. Begin at the higher level and work
to lower levels when additional people have expertise in the different parts of
an application. As the organization matures with data governance, ownership
may shift toward business functions or business processes.

In addition to business data ownership, it is also helpful to identify who can
assist with any technical questions about that data. This is usually called the
primary IT contact, and it is not the data owner.
Sometimes data ownership is assigned to whomever seems to be willing
to sign up, or someone is simply given ownership and burdened with the
assignment. This is not a recommended selection method. As the organization
matures with data governance, there are likely to be changes to who is
recognized as the data owner. This shift can begin by selecting the business
group that ultimately is responsible for that function in the business. Then,
look into that group and select a strong, experienced person to be designated as
the owner. Initially, it is easy to designate the person with the most knowledge,
but the ultimate goal is to determine, from a business perspective, where this
responsibility should truly be assigned.
The business must own the data, but IT must help to provide the mecha-
nisms to implement and support the business requirements for collecting and
handling the data.

246

■Dealing with the Data
Your Responsibilities If You Are ‘‘the Owner’’
As stated earlier, often ownership carries a negative connotation. This happens
when the responsibility is given to someone who does not have the means or
authority to implement his or her decisions. It is helpful to understand what is
involved, so that proper steps can be taken to ensure that the people assigned
ownership responsibility can be successful. If you are the data owner, you
need to be able to do the following:
Deﬁne and help document what the data really means
Be responsible for establishing quality expectations
Be responsible for setting and enforcing policies concerning data quality
Determine how the data should be used
Identify and document caveats and special cases where the data can’t or
shouldn’t be used in certain ways. Explain why.
Assist in developing or reﬁning processes for how data will be entered,
including which group should be responsible for entry
Make business decisions about how the data can be transformed or
manipulated
Help others to properly use and interpret the data itself
Be empowered to make decisions about making changes to the data
Be aware of interactions with and dependencies on the data
Work across the organization to consolidate processes and share data
Determine when historical data can be archived
Work across groups to resolve differences of opinion about the data, and
facilitate workable compromises
Help others understand the impact of their use of the data or their
requested changes
Work with IT staff to develop strategies for developing solutions to
address challenges with the data
While a single data owner can do many of the daily interactions, there will
indeed be times when the question at hand spans multiple departments. This
is when procedures for data governance are needed to reach the best resolution
for the entire organization.
While much of the attention is on dealing with the data as it currently
exists, the data owner can also play a valuable role for the future. Those
with the most knowledge of today’s data usually have the most knowledge
about the problems with that same data. This understanding is needed in order

Chapter 8
■Managing Data As a Corporate Asset
247
to develop strategies to address the problems and move the state of the data
forward over time.
What are IT’s Responsibilities?
Although data ownership is a business responsibility, there are several critical
things that the information technology staff must provide. Following are a few
examples of the IT staff’s responsibilities:
Provide the technical environment to store data.
Ensure that the business rules are implemented correctly.
Assist the data owner in researching data-related problems.
Help design solutions to correct data problems and prevent them from
happening again.
These are only a representative sample of responsibilities. The technical staff
should be considered the group to provide the mechanism of support for all
information management activities.
Challenges with Data Ownership
Over time, business rules and processing logic have become embedded into
application systems. This ensures that the rules are applied in a consistent
manner and that the people running the system are no longer required to
know them at a detailed level. A negative side-effect of this is that institutional
knowledge about why business is done that way, or sometimes even how
business is done, is lost. The people who really understood it have retired,
left the organization, or may have been promoted to very high levels and are
not easily accessible. The people who are now responsible for this work know
what steps need to happen to get the output that is needed on a periodic basis,
but there is no understanding of the underlying business purpose. It can feel
like being stonewalled in these cases, as you cannot get straight answers.
Acknowledge this situation if it exists, and give those people leeway. How
could they possibly be expected to know the answers to detailed questions?
This does not mean that you should just accept the status quo; it means that
it will take longer to ﬁgure things out. Depending on how old the application
system is and how much the business has changed, it may be better to just
redeﬁne what you want done. You can unravel the code and spreadsheets
to see what is actually done, although it is unlikely that you can ﬁgure out
why. Be prepared to discover that things are not what everyone thought.
Some calculations or processes may not be done using the current business
rules. Even worse, the rules may be applied in only some cases, while others

248
Part III
■Dealing with the Data
may continue using old logic. This can easily happen when business logic is
implemented in multiple places.
As the owner of data, you need to look out for the care and feeding of
that data. As a member of a speciﬁc business group, the needs of that group
are only one of the perspectives that must be considered. The impact on the
overall enterprise must also be considered. You cannot simply look out for the
interests of your own group and ignore the needs of the rest of the organization.
When that happens, other people start building their own databases—with
duplicate, but not integrated or necessarily accurate, data. Data ownership is a
very important part of the entire information management process and critical
to being able to utilize data as a true asset in your organization.
Data Quality
Data quality, as with most terms we use, can have many different meanings.
Let’s settle on Wikipedia’s for this discussion: Data quality is ‘‘the state of
completeness, validity, consistency, timeliness and accuracy that makes data
appropriate for a speciﬁc use.’’
The need for reliable, accurate data is critical to support the decision-making
process of each organization. The previous sections of this chapter pertain to
all types of systems, but this section looks speciﬁcally at data quality in the data
warehouse. Data quality problems have many different symptoms, including
the following:
Data can be missing completely (e.g., a sales transaction may be found
that does not have any customer identiﬁcation associated with it).
Data can be incomplete (e.g., the customer’s street address and city were
entered, but the state and zip code were left blank).
Data may not be available. For example, an auto policy was issued, but
the system did not retain information about which channel this business
came through. Policies can be issued to customers through agents, via
the phone, and over the Internet. This is common when business changes
are made in the source systems or new systems have been implemented.
All policies issued prior to this system enhancement will never have this
data associated with it, so while it looks like it is missing, it really never
existed and it cannot be recreated now.
Data can be wrong. For example, a sales transaction may identify a fre-
quent shopper who does not match the customer identiﬁer also captured
on that transaction. Sometimes these errors have a big impact on the
business and appropriate corrections are made to the source systems.
However, the transactions that occurred with the erroneous data may not
be corrected in the source system.

Chapter 8
■Managing Data As a Corporate Asset
249
Data may have multiple meanings. For example, the single ﬁeld used
to indicate the account representative responsible for this business could
contain a link to another database for a list of promotional codes. The
logic to determine how to use this ﬁeld may be embedded in program
code.
Data may not be stored consistently. For example, sometimes systems
are used in interesting and unusual ways. Clever codes may be used
to indicate speciﬁc situations. Some account numbers require manual
intervention prior to posting the numbers to the general ledger. This list
of accounts may not be stored in a system but is known to the ﬁnancial
staff. For these account numbers, the actual amounts are to be pulled
from the unit of measure ﬁeld, rather than the amount ﬁeld.
Often, the data warehouse team is left with the responsibility of sorting all of
these situations out. Real data quality must be ensured by the source system,
because only so much can be done to clean up data after the fact.
Poor data quality can impact the business. If the data in the underlying
source system is not correct, then the input to the data warehouse will have
problems. While some cleansing can occur when loading the data warehouse,
this data may still have problems. As a result, reports created from this data
warehouse will also inherit the bad data. Ultimately, this can result in poor
business decisions being made. These poor business decisions are not caused
by mistakes on the part of the staff, but bad conclusions can be drawn using
erroneous facts. Many organizations are in full agreement up until the last
statement. Then there is a strong denial that ‘‘we don’t make bad decisions!’’
Decisions are only as good as the data and assumptions that are used as
guiding input.
Proﬁling the Data
One technique that is being used to proactively improve data quality is data
proﬁling. Recall from earlier that data proﬁling is the process of examining the
data currently available in an existing data source, such as a database or a ﬁle,
and gathering statistics and information about that data. The purpose of these
statistics may be any of the following:
Find out whether existing data can easily be used for other purposes.
Provide metrics on data quality, including whether the data conforms to
company standards.
Assess the risk involved in integrating data for new applications, includ-
ing the challenges of joins.
Track data quality.

250
Part III
■Dealing with the Data
Assess whether metadata accurately describes the actual values in the
source database. Understand data challenges early in any data-intensive
project, in order to avoid surprises later in the project. Finding data prob-
lems late in the project can incur time delays and project cost overruns.
Have an enterprise view of all data, for uses such as master data manage-
ment, for which key data is needed, or data governance, for improving
data quality.
Data proﬁling tools can be used to proactively sift through data elements
and help determine the level of data quality. In addition, it is important to
document the impact of data quality problems as they are discovered. This
helps to justify the time and cost of cleaning the data. Data proﬁling is often
done to identify and improve source systems themselves. Data proﬁling may
also be done against these source systems to help design the ETL processes
used to build the data warehouse. The goal is to improve the accuracy of how
data is captured and stored in any system.
How Clean Does the Data Really Need to Be?
The level of data cleanliness is highly dependent upon the industry you
are in, the type of data you are looking at, and what data has been available
in the past. In addition, each department in the organization must decide
what will be acceptable. Remember the last part of the deﬁnition we used
earlier: ‘‘accuracy that makes data appropriate for a speciﬁc use.’’ If the data
warehouse will be used to produce ofﬁcial ﬁnancial results, then the data must
balance exactly with the general ledger. However, if the data is being used to
support management decision-making, then the quality of the data may not
need to be quite so high. If management does not have any access to ﬁnancial
data until two months after the books are closed, having 80% accuracy within
a week of the close would still be useful.
The level of acceptable data quality will also change over time. If this is the
organization’s ﬁrst serious look at the quality of the data, then the bar should
be set at a reasonable level. If the organization has been working on improving
data quality for several years already, then the target for data quality will be
much higher.
Measuring Quality
There are entire tools and methodologies built around assessing and improving
an organization’s data quality. It is certainly worthwhile having someone in
the organization learn more about these and assess their applicability in your
organization. This section covers some basic concepts, focused on the data
warehouse, that everyone can easily understand, and which should be sufﬁ-
cient for getting started.

Chapter 8
■Managing Data As a Corporate Asset
251
Typically, most data ﬂows successfully through the extract, transform, and
load (ETL) processes and all the preset checks and balances with no problems.
Often, this will represent 75%–85% of the data. Basic validation rules should
be part of the ETL processes. For example, these rules might ensure that the
product number exists, that the zip code and state combination is valid, and
that an employee number is for a current employee. If the data does not meet
the criteria, then a warning or error is generated and processes are set in
motion to inform the staff and generate error reports. Many measurements
of data quality have a systems processing focus. Additionally, it is important
to include business criteria to measure quality. Examples of common system
measurements include the following:
Total number of rows processed
Number or percentage of rows with a warning condition
Number or percentage of rows with an error condition
Examples of common business measurements include the following:
Total number of units sold
Total dollar amount of premium collected
Change in market share compared to the previous period
The general system errors can be tracked over time to determine whether
there is an increase or decrease in the number of errors encountered. This
could indicate changes in the business processes or systems where the data
warehouse team has not been notiﬁed. The business measurements should
be compared to reasonable variations. If a swing in market share of greater
than 0.5% is unheard of in your industry, this benchmark can be used to ﬂag
potential data problems.
Quality of Historical Data
The older the data, the more data quality problems you will ﬁnd. The most
accurate data tends to be the current data. Over time, enhancements are made
to operational systems that tighten up controls for data entry and processing.
Business processes improve to make it a standard part of each workﬂow
to capture critical data. New systems are developed and implemented that
include data collection to support reporting and analysis. All of these improve
the quality of the data.
Historical data does not beneﬁt from these improvements and therefore
often has the worst quality. It is important to evaluate the business beneﬁt
of making bad historical data available. Keep in mind that the effort to work
through data problems is often grossly underestimated. These estimates are
usually based upon known problems. There are also many other problems

252
Part III
■Dealing with the Data
that have yet to be discovered and may prove to be difﬁcult to diagnose and
even more difﬁcult to correct.
The business value of the oldest historical data must be scrutinized. For
retail organizations, what was hot three years ago is unlikely to be an indicator
of what will be hot this year, such as in the fashion industry. Historical data
may indicate the volume of the fashionable items that are sold, but may
yield little insight into which items are more likely to be trendy. Conversely,
actuaries want all data possible from all hurricanes since data was collected.
This long-term history is useful to feed statistical models.
A reasonable goal for data quality should be set—remember, accuracy
appropriate for use. These goals can set to higher levels as the organization,
both business and IT, learn more about the problems that exist with historical
data and techniques to address them. Don’t be afraid to back down from a
goal that is too lofty to start with. Focus on getting better data into the hands of
decision makers as soon as possible. This may even help to identify problems
and determine the possible value of addressing those problem(s). You learned
about data proﬁling is the section on data quality; historical data is an excellent
place to use these tools and techniques.
CASE STUDY: STARTING AT THE WRONG END OF THE SPECTRUM
This case study comes from a real-world scenario. Many other organizations
may have had a similar experience. This is not a recommended approach, but is
included to highlight the need to continuously review the business value of
major project choices.
The organization needed to have ﬁve years of historical transactions to
support its analysis. A new operational system was implemented two years
ago. Two different sets of work needed to be done: one to load the history from
the old system and one to develop a process to load historical and current data
from the new system. A decision was made to start with the oldest data ﬁrst.
The strategy was to load the data in historical order, oldest to newest.
Once the ETL processes were built, loading the ﬁrst three years was started.
The goal was to be able to include all transactions. Many problems were
discovered in the historical data, which did not meet the current data quality
objectives. While most of the data was ﬁne, 5% of the transactions had
problems. Detailed research was required to discover how to handle these
outliers. The ETL developers dutifully adhered to their instructions to clean all
of the data. Many hours were spent researching the errors in a small number of
transactions, using the time of the most skilled and experienced resources.
As usual, this took far longer than anyone expected. It took two years to load
three years of the oldest data. Now the development to extract data from the
new operational system could begin. At this point, the data warehouse still did
not contain data that could be used to support any reporting or analysis.
(continued)

Chapter 8
■Managing Data As a Corporate Asset
253
CASE STUDY: STARTING AT THE WRONG END OF THE SPECTRUM
(continued)
If the work to pull only current data from the new system had been
developed ﬁrst, the loads could have been running that entire time. After two
years, the organization would have the most recent two years of history with no
additional cost or effort.
Two lessons can be learned here:
■Periodically evaluate the effort and resources being put into chasing
down data problems. Look at the work compared to the impact on
the business. Understand that the cost to research and correct data
problems may be more than what the potential business value, especially
if the data represents a very small percentage of the business.
■Critically review the historical requirements to support business analysis
and determine the most direct and cost effective way to have that data
loaded.
■Once the minimal historical requirement is met, decisions can be
made about the cost and value of loading more historical data.
Cleansing at the Source
When possible, the best solution to data quality problems is to address them
at the source or where the data is originally captured. The ﬁrst step is to
ensure that research is done to determine the root cause of the problem. When
the problem is in the data warehouse, it can be corrected there. More often,
however, the root cause of data quality problems exists in the source systems
and/or business processes.
Addressing the problem at the original source can mean changes need
to be made to core application systems and/or business processes of the
organization. This would be a reasonable alternative if nothing else were
going on in the organization, but reality and experience show that this is often
not a realistic option. Usually, the application support team does indeed agree
with the recommended correction, but it may not be a priority when ranked
against other changes that may be needed just to keep the business running,
and it may not be implemented for 18 months! Changes to business processes
can encounter similar delays. You may ﬁnd you can change a business process
more easily than changing the systems to capture the data, or you may ﬁnd
you can change the systems faster than you can change the business process.
You need to understand all the options and take a pragmatic approach to the
problem.
The data warehouse and operational application teams must work together
to determine the impact of the change on the business, and how this may

254
Part III
■Dealing with the Data
impact other aspects of the operational environment currently running the
business. In many cases, all of the changes are possible, but adding new data
quality or cleansing functions can negatively affect the delivery schedule for
other features. From the business perspective, what is more important to the
organization’s overall success?
When changes cannot be made at all or will be made too far into the future,
the data warehouse team must assume the responsibility of addressing these
data quality needs. However, no matter how good the data warehouse team
is, they cannot manufacture data that is not captured anywhere. The data
warehouse team needs to stay focused on the goals and objectives of the
data warehouse. If they uncover issues that are outside the team’s scope, they
need to identify and document them and then turn them over to the appropriate
group (data governance committee, MDM team, etc.). Data proﬁling can and
should be used throughout this process.
Cleaning Up for Reporting
If efforts to implement data cleansing in the underlying source systems are
not successful, the data warehouse team must include processes in the ETL
system to clean the data before it is loaded into the data warehouse or convince
the business to reevaluate its quality expectations. By building data cleansing
logic into a systematic ETL process, the rules will be applied in a consistent
manner for all reporting, rather than on a report-by-report basis. Labels and
descriptions can be cleaned up. Duplicate data rows can be merged. The project
team has a lot of ﬂexibility with regard to cleaning up the data. This cleansing
can be done without worrying about the impact on how the operational system
functions.
Managing the Integrity of Data Integration
Data is often ﬁne within the context of a single application. In fact, most
application systems have quality checks on their own data to ensure that
processing is performed correctly. Many data accuracy challenges arise when
you try to integrate data from more than one system, such as when product
and customer codes do not align.
Often the data from these systems has been used together for years. Some-
times this has been done in a previous reporting or data warehouse project
for which the data has been integrated and coexists in the same database. If
this is the case, then much of the hard work may already be done. If there are
any major problems with the existing processes, the business community will
know about it or it may be that no one is using this reporting environment.
Take the time to review how the data is integrated and ensure that the business
intent has been implemented.

Chapter 8
■Managing Data As a Corporate Asset
255
In other cases, data from these sources has not been integrated in a systematic
way. If there is a business need to have this data together, it is likely that
someone in the organization is already doing this by hand. Try to ﬁnd a report
where the data from these two different systems is being presented side by
side today. Then, dig in to ﬁnd out how this is being done. While there may
be some manual manipulation of the data, there will still be some underlying
queries that extract the data from the source. The business logic needed to
integrate the data may be embedded in spreadsheets, SAS code, or someone’s
head.
Some organizations have employed strong information management prac-
tices for years, so that standard customer and product identiﬁers are used
by operational systems throughout the organization. This improves the ease
and accuracy of integrating data from multiple sources. Unfortunately, this is
not always the case. A direct link may not exist, but often through a series of
steps, the data can be linked to other identiﬁers that are included in the second
source system.
Figure 8-6 shows a basic example of data integration. In order to integrate
customer feedback on products with actual product sales, there is no direct
path to follow. First, when a customer calls in, the manufacturing code that is
stamped on the product is requested. This can be linked to a manufacturing
history table from which the manufacturing product identiﬁer is pulled. Using
a product mapping table, the manufacturing product can be linked to the
product code that is used in the order entry system. It is no wonder that
it seems impossible to pull integrated data for reporting. This is straightfor-
ward if the mapping process is clear, but often this is not well understood
by business users who simply want some reports. Sometimes this product
mapping is developed and stored by a business analyst and is not generally
available.
Sometimes there are no obvious links in the systems to support integra-
tion of data. Careful research needs to be done to ensure that this is really
the case. Then, explore what would need to change in order to make this
possible in the future. Sometimes it requires signiﬁcant re-engineering of one
or more underlying operational systems. If this is the case, the data integra-
tion requirement should be included in any system redesign efforts in the
future.
Searching for which ﬁelds in the database can be linked together clearly
requires strong technical skills. The people with these skills may exist only
in the IT group responsible for supporting the application. However, do not
leave the task of integration completely to the IT staff. Representatives from
the business perspective must also assist in this work. Often, the business
community is already familiar with the challenges of merging this data and
can provide invaluable insight into how this can be done correctly.

Quality Improves When It Matters
Data that is required for a business transaction to run successfully is generally
entered completely and accurately. In addition to the minimum data to
complete a transaction, other data may be known at that moment that better
describes the transaction. For example, it may be enough to capture the
shipping address to place an order, but it may also be useful to know if
this is the address of the customer’s primary residence. Additional customer
demographics may also be available. The level of detail applied can vary
greatly depending upon the total number of ﬁelds that need to be entered
and the amount of work that is waiting to be handled (e.g., customers in line,
phone calls on hold, claims that need to be entered). Even required ﬁelds
may not be captured carefully, and default values are often selected. If default
values or other shortcuts are used to complete tasks that are valuable for
analysis but not critical to complete the transaction, and there is no negative
feedback or consequences for these shortcuts, why would any employee take
the additional time to do something whose value they cannot perceive?
Data quality greatly improves when there is a clear impact. This impact
can be feedback about the number of entry errors made by employees, public
release of data that is incorrect, or the association of job performance with
improved data quality. When individuals can see that their efforts make

Chapter 8
■Managing Data As a Corporate Asset
257
a difference, data quality improves, even if no other systems changes are
made. You need to make individuals accountable for their actions in the data
collection process.
Example: Data Quality and Grocery Checkout Scanners
It is critical to ensure that the right people in the organization understand
the importance and impact they have on data quality. This was evident when
grocery stores began implementing scanners for checking out purchases. An
initial beneﬁt to the cashiers was that this sped up the checkout process. A
larger goal was to collect store sales more accurately.
Experienced cashiers were often faster than the scanning technology at the
time. In order to speed things up, cashiers would use the same approach
they had always used—enter a product once and increase the quantity. For
example, if a customer had many jars of baby food, one jar was scanned and
then the quantity was change to reﬂect the total number of jars. While this
was faster at the moment, it created a data quality nightmare because the
store did not sell twenty jars of one item (e.g., pears), but a variety of different
items (e.g., applesauce, peaches, green beans, and peas). Needless to say, the
accuracy of item-level analysis was greatly reduced.
Organizational discipline and accountability was needed to ensure that each
individual item was scanned, or that only identical items were entered for
multiple quantities. Accuracy began to improve, but there was still not a clear
understanding of the overall value of this accuracy until this same data was
used for inventory replenishment. This took the need for data accuracy from
a conceptual level to a speciﬁc, store-level requirement. This in turn raised the
importance with store managers, who in turn emphasized this process change
with their employees. Some organizations understood the value and pushed
that need down to the individual cashier level early on. Those organizations
were able to leverage that data sooner for a competitive advantage.
Example: Data Quality and the Evaluation of Public Education
This example is intended to illustrate the types of things that motivate behav-
iors that lead to higher quality data capture. It is not intended as a critique or
judgment of the political aspects of any government programs.
This example demonstrates the importance of increased data quality in the
public education system. Historically, the department of education within each
state sets education goals and standards. The individual state also determined
what ﬁnancial and educational results were measured and tracked. For years,
school districts submitted data to their respective states. Most of this data
was used to determine how funds were allocated and distributed across the
state. Because this was driven state by state, some states had more rigorous

258
Part III
■Dealing with the Data
requirements than others. Even the most progressive states had many data
challenges.
The data entry function for education data was often relegated to a clerical
function and was not the primary job responsibility for that person. Typically,
a school receptionist or principal’s secretary was responsible for entering all
student data. This function was performed amid many others: answering the
phone, dealing with parents in the ofﬁce, and the many other tasks that keep
a school running. From the secretary’s perspective, the most important data
elements to be carefully entered included student name, phone number, and
address. These data elements are needed in the daily functions of the school.
However, additional data elements were not being entered as carefully, such
as ethnicity, parent’s education level, or speciﬁc disability conditions. Many
of these additional characteristics of a student may not be known at the time
a student is enrolled. Additional characteristics about each student may be
added later, as time permits.
When the No Child Left Behind Act was passed, additional data was
required to be submitted to the U.S. Department of Education. This data
would not just be submitted and sit in a database somewhere. It would
be used to grade the performance of each school and district, and would be
shared publicly. The school’s performance could also have an impact on
future funding. Needless to say, much more attention is now being paid to the
quality of the data; however, our schools are much better equipped to interact
with children, rather than data. In order to ensure proper reporting of school
performance, each student’s data must be accurate and submitted with the
appropriate characteristics. Many school districts and schools now have staff
members dedicated to data entry and validation. Others are providing better
training to those who are involved with data entry.
Many of the challenges facing school districts and states are clearly related
to data quality and data management issues. Now that the data matters,
much more care and attention is paid to how and when data is captured and
maintained. This improved data will also help support better analysis of the
education process itself.
Realizing the Value of Data Quality
At the end of the day, working on data quality is painstaking and sometimes
tedious. It requires attention to detail and tracking down many little details,
and it often feels like a rather thankless job. Others begin to avoid you, taking
alternative routes to get from place to place. Take heart—this process will
provide value to the organization. For a data warehouse, the worst part is
during the design and development, as all the issues need to be researched and
followed up. Use all the resources at your disposal—data governance group,
MDM group, and data proﬁling tools—to help you through the process. Once

Chapter 8
■Managing Data As a Corporate Asset
259
the system goes into production, things should ease up. However, exceptions
will inevitably arise and additional research will need to be done. Improved
data quality helps the business to be better, and more accurately informed
about what is actually happening. This enables better decisions to be made,
which are ultimately reﬂected on the bottom line.
As all of the data quality issues are being addressed and you are moving
through the project design and implementation process, you should be build-
ing an environment to catalog the data elements. The next section discusses
options for accomplishing this task.
Implementing a Data Dictionary
How much time is wasted when there is no documentation about your data?
Each business analyst who is learning about a data source must ask the resident
expert directly. Each business or IT person who has to write reports must ask
the resident expert about the contents of the data ﬁles. Each application
developer must ask the resident expert when ﬁxing application problems or
making enhancements. As data ﬂows from one system to another, this also
raises a new set of questions. Even worse, a person developing a report does
not ask, but simply makes assumptions and delivers data that is not correct.
The aftermath of correcting this type of situation is often more time consuming
than reviewing the content in the ﬁrst place.
Over the years, this can add up to a large number of wasted hours for the
business and IT that could be greatly reduced if you only had some basic
documentation about your data. A data dictionary can provide that place to
capture and store the details about your data. The data dictionary is a single
shared place to store deﬁnitions, descriptions, and uses of every data element.
The notion of having a corporate data dictionary that is available to everyone
is very appealing. However, a data dictionary is very difﬁcult to develop and
maintain. Most of the challenges are not related to the design and maintenance
of such a system, but to getting everyone to agree on the deﬁnitions and
keeping the contents complete and current.
N O T E A data dictionary is a mechanism to support the organization’s data
governance efforts. This is important to capture and communicate the business
knowledge of the data.
The Data Dictionary Application
Building or buying a data dictionary application is not always a straight-
forward process. Some of the challenges that can be encountered are more
technical in nature. You can ﬁnd limited off-the-shelf products that provide
full data dictionary capabilities. Often these are tied to or integrated with other

260
Part III
■Dealing with the Data
application software, so the capabilities are good as long as you are using the
other applications. Progress continues to be made in the marketplace in this
arena, so it is worth taking some time to research current product availability.
If a data dictionary product does not meet your needs or is cost prohibitive,
you can build a basic data dictionary internally. All you really need is
a database to store the dictionary and an interface that enables others to
read the contents—and, when appropriate, to be able to add and update the
contents. One rapidly growing alternative is to develop your data dictionary by
building a wiki for your organization. This is a very ﬂexible, open, collaborative
environment. If you do this, just make sure you have controls in place regarding
who can post, edit, and contribute to the process.
This does not need to be an elaborate system, but it should contain some basic
details. Table 8-2 shows several useful things to include in a data dictionary.
Table 8-2 Possible Columns in a Data Dictionary
COLUMN NAME
DESCRIPTION
Technical Data Element Name
The actual ﬁeld or column name in the system
where this data is stored. There can be multiple
technical data element names if the same
business element is stored in multiple places.
Business Data Element Name
The name of the data element in business
terms
Business Data Element
Description
This describes the data in business terms.
Technical Data Element
Description
A description of this data element that contains
details useful to application developers about
how this is manipulated or used in the system.
Technical Contact
The name of the application developer who
would know the most about this data element.
Business Owner
The name of the person in the business who
would be able to answer questions about this
data element. (If ownership is not well deﬁned
or there is resistance, call this the ‘‘business
contact.’’)
Sample Values
A few examples of the content of this data
element can be very helpful for quick
understanding. Often, both IT and business
people may be familiar with this data element,
but a new business name may be assigned as
part of the overall data management efforts, so
this will help people realize which ﬁeld this is.

Chapter 8
■Managing Data As a Corporate Asset
261
These are just a few of the things that may be of interest. Additional
details such as ﬁeld type and length may be included for the beneﬁt of a
more technical audience. However, ensure that the business perspective is
represented; otherwise, the data dictionary will only be useful for the technical
staff.
The data dictionary application is more than just the database itself. It
must enable designated users to enter and maintain the data dictionary. This
needs to be done in bulk or on an individual basis. The bulk loads will likely
be from spreadsheets that have been created during a development project.
The individual maintenance will be done over time to keep the existing data
dictionary current and accurate.
The other primary capability of the data dictionary application is the
ability to view the contents of the data dictionary itself. This should be
a straightforward, basic application for viewing the contents of the data
dictionary database.
Populating the Data Dictionary
Once the database or wiki is set up and an interface is provided for the data
dictionary, it is like having a bound book with blank pages. It is only useful
when the content is added. This is where the really hard work begins. With
all of the company’s databases to choose from and likely tens of thousands of
data elements, how do you get started?
To begin, pick one system or database, and try to choose one that is
being worked on for other reasons already. This may be for a set of major
enhancements to a system, or the system has been identiﬁed to feed the data
warehouse. If this data was loaded into the data warehouse, you already know
that this data is of interest to the business and provides value.
The data warehouse team must work with the business and the technical
teams to understand the contents of this database in order to effectively
model and build the data warehouse components. The data warehouse team
needs to develop clear business names and deﬁnitions for all the data to be
published through the data warehouse. Because the data warehouse team will
be performing some of this work anyway, it makes sense to combine the data
dictionary work with the data warehouse. Make sure that the project scope
and funding takes this work into account.
As always, when there are not enough resources, documentation tends to
be ignored. Because populating the data dictionary is additional work, more
resources should be allocated to the data warehouse team to ensure that this
actually happens. This is not meant to imply that this is only a data warehouse
issue, but sometimes it needs to be started there.
You can get a jump start by loading the technical details in from the
database itself. This is a technical task, but the application developer or

262
Part III
■Dealing with the Data
database administrator can quickly provide this in a data ﬁle or spreadsheet.
From a systems perspective, it can also help to determine what percentage of
the rows do not have data, also referred to as null. If the application system
does not enter data into this column, then there is no point in creating a
business description.
Once the basics are populated, it is time to ﬁll in the rest of the details.
Representatives in the business community must provide the business names
and deﬁnitions. Several different techniques can be used. It is important
to pick an approach that ﬁts with your corporate culture. This must be as
painless as possible for those key business users, also called subject matter
experts. It is much easier to get help from more people if you have an open,
collaborative environment that easily enables people to edit and add to the
dictionary.
APPROACHES TO CAPTURING INFORMATION FOR THE DATA DICTIONARY
Direct Documentation
Some business people ﬁnd it easier to simply ﬁll in labels and descriptions
themselves. They can do this in small increments between meetings, or often
will stay late and quietly enter the descriptions. If a business person is inclined
to document things, he or she may have already documented the key data that
is frequently used.
Interview
Some people never write anything down. They just know all of the content. The
only way to gain access to this information is to sit down and ask them.
Someone must be assigned to conduct sessions in which each element is
looked at and the responses are entered into the data dictionary.
Compilation
There may be bits and pieces of documentation that have been informally
developed over the years. This may be in the form of handwritten notes,
spreadsheets, or new employee presentations. All of these can be collected and
entered into the data dictionary. Once this compilation of the different content
is completed, the business group must validate the results.
(continued)

Chapter 8
■Managing Data As a Corporate Asset
263
APPROACHES TO CAPTURING INFORMATION FOR THE DATA DICTIONARY
(continued)
Ghostwriter
It may be necessary to create a draft of the business name and description. This
may be done by a newer member in the business group or by someone from IT.
Appropriate business people must validate this draft. It may be easier for the
subject matter experts to critique something, rather than write it from scratch.
Be careful to have realistic expectations about how quickly this will be
done. This type of documentation is often just one more thing that these key
individuals are being asked to do. Their participation is often provided on
their own time, after their other immediate work is completed. Encourage and
reward their participation. One big beneﬁt to these key people is that once this
is documented, fewer people will need to ask basic questions about the data.
The data dictionary can be consulted ﬁrst, and only more advanced questions
will require the involvement of a subject matter expert.
Accessing the Data Dictionary
After you have good content in the data dictionary, the real value can be
realized. This happens when the data dictionary is made available to the
business and IT communities. The data dictionary can assist business people
who are trying to understand a report, or application developers who need to
know about the content of a table in the database.
The data dictionary should be published in a simple format. A basic search
interface can be developed and the contents can be available through the
company’s intranet. The interface should be simple, with options to constrain
what you are looking for, and be interactive with the data dictionary database.
Take advantage of how other content is published across the organization. Use
these existing applications as a starting point and go from there.
Maintaining the Data Dictionary
Often, a big initiative is set up to create and populate the data dictionary. This
is well publicized and supported at multiple levels of management. However,
implementing a data dictionary is a long-term commitment, not a one-shot
effort. After the data elements from the ﬁrst data source have been documented
and loaded into the data dictionary, the work does not stop. Additional data
sources and additional types of information can be added to the dictionary

264
Part III
■Dealing with the Data
and then captured. Each report, including its purpose and data elements, can
also be added.
As business data elements are identiﬁed and documented, a cross-reference
to each ﬁeld or column containing that business data element can be captured.
A small amount of effort is needed to simply maintain the data dictionary
over time. This entails communicating with the different project or application
maintenance teams to ensure that as enhancements and corrections are made,
the contents of the data dictionary are updated to reﬂect those changes. If
you have a data governance team, it should assume the responsibility of
maintaining the data dictionary; otherwise, the data warehouse team may
need to take the lead.
Expansion of the data dictionary takes a lot more effort. This requires the
involvement of not only the IT people, to explain what is put into a ﬁeld or
column, but also the active participation of the business community, to clarify
what the data means and how it is used.
Getting Started with Information Management
While the goals of information management are admirable, there is usually
some sort of a catalyst that sparks interest and support. An information
management push generally begins after the following has occurred:
A major data issue, perhaps with external exposure of inaccurate data to
a regulatory agency or the press.
A key executive feels the pain and understands the solution.
Challenges in the data have grown to a crisis point.
Paralysis, inability to get data needed to conduct business.
Changes in management personnel, whereby new staff members are used
to a greater availability and quality of data for running the business.
While interest builds, this is the time to ensure that the breadth and severity
of data challenges are documented and communicated. The real ﬁrst step is to
get your arms around what you have and where you are today.
Understanding Your Current Data Environment
It is important to gain a realistic understanding of the state of the data today.
This understanding must come from both business and IT to really be effective.
Two different paths need to be followed. One is to get an understanding of
what data is stored where. The second is to gain some insight into the

Chapter 8
■Managing Data As a Corporate Asset
265
organization’s level of information management. In the end, it again is about
the partnership—IT needs to manage where and how to store the data, and
business needs to be able to understand what is available, and what it means
to effectively use the data.
What Data Do You Have?
The organization may already have a sound understanding of the current data
environment and it may already be diagrammed. If not, then a decision must
be made about the level of detail that is currently needed. Perhaps a quick
overview, such as what would be shared with a new employee, is all that is
necessary. If there is a need to understand all of the data interfaces between
operational systems, this will take longer. The goal is to get a fundamental
understanding of the primary data the company already has. Taking the
quicker route, a simple diagram can be documented. If this is not formally
documented, it has likely been drawn repeatedly on white boards during
meetings. A simple example is shown in Figure 8-7.

Figure 8-7 Current data environment
Each of the major databases, usually associated with the main operational
systems of the organization, is shown. Other types of data, including spread-
sheets and departmental databases, should also be included. Do not limit the
data to that which is managed and backed up by systems staff members.

266
Part III
■Dealing with the Data
Include the data that is loaded onto that PC in the corner of the ofﬁce and
the spreadsheets that are maintained and distributed on a weekly basis to the
entire ﬁeld sales force. If there are a small number of these sources, each can
be named. If there are too many to list, indicate multiples and name a few that
would resonate with most people in the organization. This is not intended
to be a full data ﬂow diagram or to provide speciﬁc database details. The
point is simply to identify the major systems and to understand the levels of
integration that currently exist.
The scope and level of detail needed to describe the current data depends on
the size and complexity of the organization. A large, multi-division enterprise
needs a very high-level view of the major systems, and acknowledgment that
smaller departmental or personal systems exist. Then each individual division
should have a more detailed diagram to describe the data that is used within
the division. A single line of business organization may ﬁnd one summary
of the data to be sufﬁcient.
What Already Exists?
The second set of information you want to understand is the existence and/or
maturity of information management practices in the organization. To help
determine what parts of the information management process already exist,
ask the following types of questions:
How well, if at all, do the application systems integrate today?
Which kinds of data have multiple copies?
Is there a single clean source for customer reference data?
Are common product deﬁnitions in use across the organization?
Which parts of the organization are interested in what data?
What level of trust do you have in the accuracy of the data in the systems
today?
Are some systems better than others? If so, why?
Do your application systems each have their own reference data?
Are there duplicates in the reference data?
How do your systems currently interact with one another?
Are there common keys between systems—that is, some sort of system
identiﬁer to enable the data to be accurately linked together?
These questions will help you assess how far from a coordinated infor-
mation management strategy you are. As you begin to understand and

Chapter 8
■Managing Data As a Corporate Asset
267
communicate the level or lack of maturity of information management, make
sure that this is handled carefully. Most system designers and develop-
ers are trying to do the best they can for the organization. Compromises
and choices are made every day in order to keep the business moving for-
ward. Deal honestly with the realities of your data, but don’t point ﬁngers
or blame others. This must be a nonjudgmental statement of where things
stand.
Where Do You Want to Be?
Now that you have a better understanding of where you are and the state
of integration or lack thereof, you can draft the vision outlining where you
want to be. This is the beginning of a data architecture. The topic of data
architecture is covered in more depth in Chapter 9. A full data architecture
provides more speciﬁc details about how data will be structured and stored.
The information management strategy needs to stay focused on what kind of
data, customer, supplier, agent, or broker is needed by which systems. The
information management strategy must also deﬁne the goal regarding how
data is shared between systems.
As stated earlier, because information management has many facets, the
strategy must help address the business processes and data governance needed
to achieve the goals.
While implementation of full information management plans takes many
years, you need to have that vision ﬁrst so that everyone knows what you are
working toward.
Figure 8-8 shows an example vision describing how the data will be handled
in the future. You can still see the different operational business applications.
These all take advantage of the master reference data. This master reference
data also feeds the data warehouse staging area, and ultimately the data
warehouse itself. Thisdiagramalsoshows howoperational reportingcontinues
to be supported directly by the business application systems, while the data
warehouse supports management reporting and analysis.
The largest gaps between the current and future states are usually quite
obvious. It is important to identify and understand these gaps. The business
beneﬁt of addressing the gaps can be studied, along with the impact of not
addressing these gaps. Developing plans to ﬁx these gaps can be made as part
of developing the implementation plans for your information management
strategy.
The information strategy should be explainable to people with different
levels of technical skill. The information management strategy is much more
about how the company will handle data than about technology.

Develop a Realistic Strategy
Developing a realistic information management strategy is probably the most
critical aspect of the entire process. You need to have a dedicated data
governance committee (described later in this chapter), built in partnership
between business and IT, and that has both the responsibility and authority
to execute the strategy. Setting your vision or long-term goals is beneﬁcial,
but only the beginning. Now a series of phases need to be deﬁned to begin
implementing your information management strategy. Deﬁne the steps that
need to be taken over the next three to ﬁve years to reach the goal. The most
speciﬁc details will be included for the ﬁrst year. This often sets forth a series
of projects. Several sample projects include:
Set up basic data governance policies and procedures, including the
following:
Determine roles and responsibilities.

Chapter 8
■Managing Data As a Corporate Asset
269
Identify resource requirements.
Create a data governance committee.
Select the pilot project to adopt the new data governance policies and
procedures.
Review the use and value of existing reporting and analytical environ-
ments (data warehouse, data mart, performance scorecard, executive
dashboards, etc.). Determine the long-term viability of each.
Recommend business process changes to improve the quality of data
entered—for example, by a travel reservations staff.
Gather requirements for and build a new ﬁnancial data mart.
Deploy two additional business intelligence applications using data
already loaded in the data warehouse.
Determine the training needs for both business and systems staff related
to information management.
Deﬁne projects to address operational system changes, such as making
enhancements to the policy issuance system to capture additional data.
Evaluate the organization’s needs and select tools and technologies
to support the information management strategy.
Sharing the Information Management Strategy
The organization’s information management strategy needs to be written
down to ensure clear communication with others. It should not be too lengthy;
otherwise, few people will take the time to read it. Write the strategy in
business terms that can be easily understood.
The information management strategy should include diagrams that show
the current data environment (refer to Figure 8-7) and the vision (refer to
Figure 8-8). Each diagram should include a one-page summary to support it.
The formal documentation provides a reference for anyone in the organization
to learn about the strategy or simply refresh their memory.
The development of an information management strategy usually spawns
a series of projects to address the data and information challenges facing the
organization. A summary of each of these projects should be communicated
with the information management strategy. These projects are the actions that
help the organization achieve the vision it has deﬁned.
Senior management must be briefed about the concepts. Because information
management affects the entire enterprise, securing management’s support is
critical to the success of the strategy. Once the strategy has been approved
and accepted, others in the organization must also be briefed. The same
presentation should be given to managers, supervisors, data warehouse project

270
Part III
■Dealing with the Data
team members, and any others who are interested. This clariﬁes the project’s
direction to everyone and signals that senior management supports it.
The information management strategy is a management tool, not a design
speciﬁcation. Additional work will be done within each project that falls under
the information management umbrella to get to the technical speciﬁcation
level of detail.
Setting Up a Sustainable Process
Many organizations get excited about information management concepts and
draft their vision for the future. Then, when reality sinks in about how much
hard work is involved and how much compromise is required, many of these
efforts never get off the ground. This section provides some guidelines for
ensuring that doesn’t happen to your vision.
Enterprise Commitment
Visible support from senior management is critical to ensure success. This
means that projects need to be funded. Groups must be encouraged and
rewarded for working together. Small successes need to be celebrated. All
systems projects need to include some responsibility for participating in the
organization’s information management strategy. Each business group must
be charted with the responsibility to participate and support the information
management work, including working on data quality, taking ownership of
the data, and documenting what the data means.
The Data Governance Committee
A data governance committee should be formed to set and enforce strategy, and
facilitate communication and resolution of issues. The committee provides a
mechanism to guide the process of implementing the information management
strategy.
The committee should be headed by a business executive and contain
representatives from each of the business areas, including subject matter
experts who know a lot about the data from their area. Each representative
should also have an understanding of how others use data that is created and
maintained within their own group.
The committee should have a standard meeting schedule. This may need
to be weekly as you get started. Over time, monthly meetings are typically
sufﬁcient. The purpose of the meeting is to communicate and coordinate
data-related issues. This is not intended to be a working session to research
problems or recommend solutions. If topics require research, the appropriate

Chapter 8
■Managing Data As a Corporate Asset
271
people are assigned the work and are expected to report back to the committee
with the results.
The committee needs to serve as a decision-making body. Many data-related
questions require cross-functional input, which the committee should provide.
The committee should have the authority to handle most issues on its own, but
for signiﬁcant issues the committee can recommend a solution to be approved
by senior management. This should only be done for big issues with broad
implications or signiﬁcant impact on funding.
The data governance committee also serves to provide a common ground
for communication. Business decisions are often made that impact informa-
tion management and speciﬁcally the data warehouse. Examples of business
decisions that can affect information management include offering new lines
of business, or acquiring a new subsidiary that will begin using the existing
inventory control application system. Often, the application team directly
responsible for the system is informed of these changes, but other downstream
systems and groups are not always informed. The data governance committee
provides a forum to discuss what is happening in different parts of the busi-
ness. Appropriate follow-up can be done to ensure that data ﬂows properly
throughout the rest of the organization.
Revising the Strategy
Keep in mind that while the information management strategy must have a
long-term view, it also needs to have the ﬂexibility for reﬁnement and the
business changes and/or systems changes. As the organization learns what
works and what doesn’t, the information management strategy should reﬂect
this corporate knowledge. Too often, an information management strategy sets
forth unrealistic and unattainable goals. If this happens, revise the strategy to
reﬂect more reasonable goals. Take some time to develop the ﬁrst cut and then
try to implement the strategy.
Sometimes the challenges that crop up could never have been anticipated,
even if years were spent to develop the information management strategy.
Treat information management as a general direction. Point the organization
in that direction and start moving forward. There will be detours along the
way, but most progress will still be in the desired general direction. While you
are planning next year’s projects, which are proposed under the information
management umbrella, this is a perfect time to ensure that the direction still
meets the organization’s needs.
In Real Life
After learning about information management, let’s take a look at how this is
being handled by the companies we have been tracking.

■Dealing with the Data
A Glimpse into Giant, Co.
As the company has grown over the last ﬁfty years, a lot of structure and
procedures have been put into place. There is already a strong, well-developed
set of enterprise reference data. It is not perfect, but it does a pretty good job
of keeping the core customer, product, employee, and supplier data clean.
All of the major application systems that have been written in house use these
master data sources. This provides great paths for integrating data across
sources, but several smaller applications were developed quickly, with no
interface to the shared reference data.
The organization excels at following standards. This is beneﬁcial, but unfor-
tunately the organization has lost the ability to think creatively. Staff members
simply follow the rules, whether they make sense or not. It is easier to stay
in line than to step up and question the rules. These standards typically have
been reﬁned with an operational system perspective. Flexibility and the need
for business-driven data for the data warehouse does not always ﬁt as nicely.
Many project resources are wasted trying to challenge the status quo. Some-
times this does work eventually, but in other cases, the existing rules prevail.
This can affect the value that can be delivered to the business community.
There needs to be some level of ﬂexibility and a mechanism to evaluate the
applicability of standards. This could help many projects, not just the data
warehouse.
Using the principles outlined in this chapter, an information management
strategy must be developed. The organization will be able to utilize much of
what has been developed to date. The addition of a data governance committee
and procedures will help the data warehouse team by providing a vehicle to
raise issues and the needed support to come to resolution.
Insight from Agile, Inc.
The organization prides itself on its entrepreneurial spirit. Do what you need to
get the job done. This provides a high level of energy and creativity. However,
this also has resulted in the organization having many different silos of business
processes and application systems. In addition, many of the application
systems are third-party packages that helped to get things running quickly.
This lack of coordinated effort and the resulting disparate systems has
resulted in extreme challenges for data integration. This has also had a
negative impact on data quality. Each project must fend for itself.
Starting down a more organized information management path is foreign to
both the business and IT staff. This will only be successful if speciﬁc business
problems can be addressed by the strategy. If no business problem is identiﬁed
and no speciﬁc business value is delivered, then any information management
efforts will fail. However, the organization has encountered many growing

Chapter 8
■Managing Data As a Corporate Asset
273
pains and the disparate systems and data are now getting in the way of
meeting customer needs. Now is the time to get started.
This will require education for everyone. Both the business and systems
must change how the daily work is done. Structure and coordination are
needed to ensure that everyone is working together. There will be many
growing pains and false starts, but with enough commitment and fortitude,
the organization will be able to make this cultural shift and leverage data across
the enterprise. Communication and continuous reﬁnement of the strategy will
be critical to attaining the organization’s information management goals.
IMPORTANT QUESTIONS TO ASK
This chapter reviewed many different aspects of information management. The
following questions may help you to understand the information management
strategy and procedures within your organization:
■Does your organization have a data governance or data management
group?
■Where does the data management responsibility fall—business or IT?
■Do you have a speciﬁc strategy for information management?
■Are speciﬁc projects and tasks deﬁned to get started with
implementing your information management strategy?
■Do system development projects tie into this strategy?
■Who within the business is responsible for the information management
strategy?
■List what you expect information management to do for you.
■List what business and IT issues and challenges you face regarding data.
■Who is currently assigned to address these issues?
■Who do you think should be working on these issues?
■What type of checks and balances are in place for data governance?
■How is data ownership assigned?
■What is in place to measure and improve data quality?
■Who is responsible for the design and evolution of the data dictionary?
■Have there been any previous attempts to develop an information
management strategy? What has been tried for the following:
■Data governance
■Data quality
■Implementation of a data dictionary
■Why were these attempts successful or not?

■Dealing with the Data
Summary
The ability to truly have your data work as a valuable corporate asset is
highly dependent on your organization’s ability to forge working partner-
ships between business and IT. Careful attention to information management
strategies can provide a clear direction for the organization’s data needs. All
IT and business professionals can use this as a set of overarching guidelines.
Information management is not a one-shot project, and it will never be com-
plete. Getting started can be difﬁcult and somewhat daunting, but it is worth
the effort in the long run. This chapter has focused on the value of data; the
next chapter discusses data warehouse architecture and tools.

This chapter is intended to introduce a nontechnical audience to architecture
concepts. If you are a systems architect, this chapter is not intended for you.
There is a lot of discipline and rigor associated with systems architecture, but
these topics are beyond the scope of this book and are not covered in this
chapter. This chapter will do the following:
Provide an introduction to architecture
Outline the beneﬁts of architecture
Discuss the basics of data architecture for a data warehouse
Review the technical architecture for a data warehouse
Share the fundamentals of ﬁnding tools that will work for your organi-
zation
For readers who are interested in gaining more in-depth knowledge of
architecture, many ﬁne resources are available. A search for books on enter-
prise architecture will yield many options. Several books speciﬁc to data
warehousing that include architecture concepts include the following:

■Building the Project
What Is Architecture?
There are many different deﬁnitions for architecture. Rather than introduce
another one, a search on system architecture at www.dictionary.com returns
the following:
A system architecture or systems architecture is the conceptual design that deﬁnes
the structure and/or behavior of a system.
There is no universally agreed upon deﬁnition of which aspects constitute
a system architecture, and various organizations deﬁne it in different ways,
including the following:
The fundamental organization of a system, embodied in its components,
their relationships to each other and the environment, and the principles
governing its design and evolution (from ANSI/IEEE 1471-2000).
A formal description of a system, or a detailed plan of the system at
component level to guide its implementation (TOGAF).
Two different layers of architecture are addressed for a data warehouse
in this chapter: data architecture and technical architecture. Data architecture is
focused on where data is stored, how it is structured, and how it is intended
to be used. Technical architecture provides the road map showing what
technical capabilities are needed to perform the many different functions,
from extraction through to end user access. The technical architecture is what
deﬁnes hardware platforms, operating systems, databases, transformation
tools and data access, analysis and reporting. This is how you can ensure that
all of the capabilities you need are provided and that each of the parts ﬁt
together to provide the complete set of tools needed to develop, implement,
and use your data warehouse.
Whether you are talking about data architecture or technical architecture,
each must be put into the proper context. If you have a single project with a
single data feed to your data warehouse, then the magnitude of the challenges
and problems is greatly reduced. The larger the organization, and the more
independent and autonomous the different parts of the business are, the harder
it is to deﬁne and implement any architecture. The data warehouse architecture
should encompass the needs across the entire organization.
Why Do We Need Architecture?
The reason to develop and use architecture in systems is to impose overall
order on what can turn into chaos relatively quickly. It helps an organization
to develop a common understanding of the data warehousing components

as implemented within the organization; leverage industry best practices;
empower individual projects to work independently; provide the blueprint
for an integrated view of the business; and minimize duplication of effort
between projects.
Figure 9-1 describes the delicate balance of architecture. Both short-term
and long-term risks and beneﬁts must be considered. In today’s tight, compet-
itive marketplace, long-term investments are often abandoned for immediate
results. While this may seem appropriate at ﬁrst glance, it can set up all data
warehouse initiatives for failure. Each different group is scurrying to meet
its own business goals. This can spawn many different projects designed to
support each individual group; and while a speciﬁc group’s immediate needs
may be met, the overall cost to the organization is larger due to duplicate
efforts. The beneﬁts of having an enterprise data warehouse architecture can
be realized only when that architecture is followed.
• Quick results
• Easier to develop
• Lower individual
 
project cost
• Leverages DW skills for technical support,
 
development, and business use
• Encourages enterprise data consistency
• Supports data integration
• Subsequent projects build on previous work
• Reduced overall cost for the enterprise
• Consolidated purchasing power & minimized
 
# of technologies to support
• Takes longer to deliver first few projects
 
while the foundation is being built
• Some projects will do work that is not of
 
direct benefit to their interest, but is needed
 
for the greater good
• Increased individual project cost
• May miss business opportunities during
 
time to develop
• May not be easily extended
• Each project learns for themselves
• Does not provide consistent reporting across
 
enterprise
• Creates more work in the long run (re-work
 
or start over to interface with other projects)
• Duplicate efforts; each project builds their own
• Missed business opportunity from lack of
 
integrated data

Figure 9-1 The balance of architecture
Without enterprise data warehouse architecture, each project does what is
necessary to get its work done, resulting in multiple independent applications
that do not integrate or work together. These are often referred to as stovepipe
applications.
This also sets up a pattern of revisions and a great deal of rework that
could have been avoided. Project teams often observe that there is not enough
time to do it right the ﬁrst time, but there is always time and money to do

280

■Building the Project
it again. It is important as a management team to be in touch with what is
really happening on projects. Individual project team members often wonder
whether this tendency to rework projects is really what upper management
wants, or whether this is simply a pattern that has emerged without conscious
thought over time.
N O T E
The biggest data warehousing disappointment occurs when an
organization that lacks architectural direction results in the development of
multiple non-integrating data warehouses or data marts. This lack of purpose fails
to address one of the fundamental goals of data warehousing: supporting a single
version of the truth.
A CASE STUDY: THE NEED FOR ENTERPRISE RESPONSIBILITY
The term enterprise is often interpreted as an extremely large organization with
multiple, disparate lines of business that run independently. This type of large
enterprise faces challenges with coordination and collaboration when working
on enterprise systems development efforts, including a data warehouse. Similar
coordination and collaboration challenges exist for small and medium-size
companies too.
For example, a mid-size ﬁnancial institution grew through acquisition, but
the company continued to run each area autonomously. The business focus of
each division was different enough that folding all operations together did not
make sense. Each division was run as a separate company, each with its own
budget and business goals. Within each division, there was no need to look at
data from the other divisions. With a lack of overall enterprise requirements,
architecture, or accountability, each division continued on its own path to deve-
lop solutions for its reporting needs. Each division was at a different stage of
exploration or implementation of data warehousing capabilities. The focus
of each was to support its own division.
As an enterprise, there was increasing need to look at more than just
high-level ﬁnancials across the organization. Within the organization struc-
ture, the people who needed this integrated view were the executive team.
Although the audience is small in number, these are the users who have the
greatest need for information to support the decision-making process as they
set the direction of the organization.
Exploration of each division’s business showed that while each division has a
unique niche, they have some customers in common. Moreover, the different
divisions have interests in similar industries too. By taking an enterprise view,
the organization was able to leverage its customer relationships and cross sell
products. The enterprise view also enabled the enterprise to identify
industry-speciﬁc trends over time to head off what could have been big
problems. The impact on each division was not large enough to cause concern,
but when added together, the impact could have been severe.

Chapter 9
■Architecture, Infrastructure, and Tools
281
Of course, an architecture is only helpful to the extent that it is adopted and
used across the organization. The next section shares ideas for how to make
this happen.
Making Architecture Work
Architecture can provide great beneﬁts to an organization, but it must be
developed with common sense. It is easy to lose sight of the overall purpose,
which is to provide structure to support the design and development of
application systems. It is easy to get swept up in the realm of architecture and
deﬁne strict, rigid guidelines that can impede the ability of a project team to
build a system. Architecture should support and help teams, not prevent them
from meeting their goals.
In addition, any architecture must continue to grow and change with the
organization. It is critical that the architecture be ﬂexible and adapt over
time to ensure its value to the organization. A rigid architecture is often
disregarded and never used. This is actually worse than no architecture, as
time and resources were spent to develop it. Developing an architecture that
both provides order and is able to help project teams deliver real solutions is
a challenge.
Companies are under a lot of pressure to meet the many demands facing
businesses today. It can be difﬁcult to invest in long-term strategies, such as
implementing architectures, when dealing with serious short-term problems.
However, ignoring architecture is not the answer. Both business and systems
management have some responsibility for architecture. From a systems per-
spective, it is important to ensure that your architecture is reasonable and
that appropriate procedures are put in place so that project teams can utilize
the architecture. All projects need to tie into the architectural vision. Many
companies are good at these systems-related responsibilities. Unfortunately,
many companies stop there.
Business management must also actively support the architecture. This
means that everyone must be willing to make accommodations to ensure that
the architecture is used. Each individual project must be not only allowed but
actively encouraged to adopt the architecture. When getting started, this may
add some time or additional expense to a project, but it should save time and
money in the future.
As a joint business and IT management team, you need to work together to
do the following:
Understand the need for and purpose of the data warehouse architecture
Support the enterprise viewpoint
Not penalize projects or individuals who are taking the time to address
enterprise-level needs

282
Part IV
■Building the Project
Not pressure project teams such that immediate needs overshadow
long-term beneﬁts
Look out for the long-term success of the organization
Be willing to invest (time and money) for the greater good of the enterprise
Understand the impact of short-term decisions on the long-term viability
of the data warehouse
Realize that many of the enterprise-level challenges have taken years to
develop and will not be solved in the short term. These will never be
solved if you don’t get started.
Project teams can be easily coerced to deliver short-term solutions. Budget
and schedule constraints are key motivating factors for most project mana-
gers and teams. This means that long-term enterprise concerns are pushed
aside in the interest of meeting individual and group goals: In other words,
get the project done yesterday. This is where the management team must step
in to actively support efforts to develop long-term solutions.
Now that a general background about architecture has been provided, it
is time to look more closely at data warehouse architecture. Recall that two
different architectures are discussed in more detail: data and technology. While
these two work together, each must be considered independently.
Data Architecture
Data architecture addresses how the data is organized and structured to support
the development, maintenance, and use of the data by application systems.
The purpose of data architecture is to create a blueprint showing how the
organization is going to process and store data.
While a comprehensive data architecture will encompass all operational
and data warehouse data, this chapter focuses only on the data architec-
ture for your data warehouse. This serves a different purpose and should
be handled separately from your operational data architecture. A separate,
distinct effort should deﬁne the data architecture for operational systems.
These architectures interface with each other when data is extracted from
the operational systems and may both interact in the area of master data
management.
Advances in technology have made it easier and faster to move data than
ever before. It is possible to keep more history and more details, and to develop
prototypes quickly. The technical capabilities lure you into believing that you
can do anything. Unfortunately, reality dictates otherwise. It is important to
stop and ask whether all this really gets you where you want to be. More

Chapter 9
■Architecture, Infrastructure, and Tools
283
important, where do you want to be? The data warehouse data architecture
provides the vision for the organization’s data.
How data is handled and structured in the data architecture is independent
of your technology. This is why you need to pay such careful attention to your
data architecture. Sound data architecture gives you ﬂexibility and avenues
for growth, and gracefully accommodates technical changes over time.
Although many organizations are getting started with data warehousing,
the early adopters have been doing this for over two decades. In some cases, the
original data design has been moved to a different database platform twice
since the initial implementation. You don’t go in thinking that you will change
out your database, but if you have ten to ﬁfteen years to reﬂect on, you probably
have already done so. Who can predict what technology might be available
in ﬁfteen years? The bottom line is that you need to expect success and plan
accordingly. This means ensuring that your data ﬁts together properly across
the enterprise.
Revisiting DW Goals
There are many different opinions about, and approaches to, handling and
structuring data in a data warehouse. Each different approach is trying to
address a common set of objectives. Regardless of the data architecture, the
goals are as follows:
Extract, clean, integrate, and make the data available to the business in a
timely manner.
Be able to adapt to changes at any point in the process.
Address enterprise integration requirements.
While these goals can be succinctly stated, they are actually complex and
have broad implications—implications that are speciﬁc to your organization
and the current state of the data. Examples of speciﬁc challenges that need to
be addressed for the ﬁrst goal include the following:
The need to bring together data from disparate claims handling systems.
The primary source system does not have a sound database design, which
results in data being scattered throughout the database; duplicates; and
inconsistencies.
Extreme data volumes make it difﬁcult to meet performance expectations
for loading and/or querying data.
Source systems do not retain history.
There is no common deﬁnition of a product (this is common in ﬁnancial
services companies).

284
Part IV
■Building the Project
N O T E
Many of the data challenges facing an organization have developed over a
long period of time. Do not expect them to be resolved quickly and without effort.
For the secondary goals, the types of change that commonly occur include
the following:
Expansion into new businesses
Changes in the marketplace
Changes or enhancements to an underlying source system
Replacement/rewrite of an underlying source system
Mergers and acquisitions
Need for data that was not originally requested or identiﬁed
New groups of people who want to use the data
Reﬁnement of business rules, deﬁnitions, and groupings of the business
Clariﬁcation about how you want to look at and measure the business
itself
Regulatory changes
The goal is to be able to gracefully adapt to these changes without having
to completely rewrite the processes to build the data warehouse. A ﬂexible
design improves the time it takes to incorporate these changes.
The last goal is often the most difﬁcult. Each organization must evaluate the
need for, beneﬁt of, and work required to achieve enterprise integration. The
level of awareness of enterprise requirements is often related to where you ﬁt
in the organization. Individual project team members usually are focused on
their immediate deliverables. From a systems perspective, pockets of people
can be found who have enterprise concerns. These are often found in the
architecture and database administration groups, which are responsible for
looking after enterprise resources.
From a business perspective, business analysts typically concentrate on
getting their reports and analyses completed on time. Often, you must look
higher and higher in the organization to ﬁnd the business people who have
the need for enterprise integration. Decisions about enterprise integration
must be made at these high levels in the business. The individual team
members can help estimate the work involved, but the magnitude of the need
and the beneﬁts must be articulated by upper management. Without a clear
management mandate and ongoing support, enterprise integration is difﬁcult,
if not impossible, to achieve.

companies. Enterprise means across your entire company, regardless of the size.
Similar problems have been observed for organizations of any size, from single
line of business to global conglomerate.
Data architecture provides the umbrella to help an organization meet these
overarching data warehouse goals. It is time to look more closely at the
different parts of the data warehouse data architecture. Keep in mind that
the speciﬁc business and systems requirements of each organization must be
taken into consideration when developing the data architecture.
Components of DW Data Architecture
Any architecture can seem daunting to understand, but it does not need to be.
As shown in Figure 9-2, the overall ﬂow of data in a data warehouse consists
of several basic layers, which need to be deﬁned by the data architecture.

Figure 9-2 Layers of data architecture data ﬂow
The ﬁrst layer of the data architecture is for capturing or creating the data.
This is not within the realm of the data warehouse, but is done by the
source systems. The speciﬁc architecture of the source systems is determined
independently of the data warehouse, but this is where you begin. The second
layer is the process to get the data from wherever it currently lives in the
organization. This may be a simple extract from a database or a complex set
of programs to pull the necessary data, or a utility to pull the data from a
third-party application such as a ﬁnancial system. The third layer is to prepare

286
Part IV
■Building the Project
the data for reporting and analytical use. This is the where most of the work
for a data warehouse is done including validation, cleansing, and integration.
The fourth step of data architecture is to publish the data that is ready for
access. Here, data is made available for reporting and analysis. The ﬁnal step
is to begin using the data itself.
At each layer, several basic things need to be deﬁned regarding the data:
1. What data will be stored here (reference and/or transaction data)?
2. What is the primary purpose of keeping the data here?
3. How will the data be structured?
4. What is the persistence of the data or how much history will be stored?
If it is no longer needed, how is this handled?
5. Who will be able to use the data here?
6. What type of data access will they have?
There are many different alternatives for a data warehouse data architec-
ture. A complete data architecture deﬁnes parameters and guidelines for the
preceding questions for each of the layers illustrated previously in Figure 9-2.
A review of the most widely adopted data architectures follows in the next
section.
A Closer Look at Common Data Warehouse Architectures
While there are many philosophical approaches to data warehouse architec-
ture, two are by far the most widely adopted: the bottom-up approach and the
top-down approach. These were introduced as Kimball/Inmon in Chapter 1,
and each is explored in more detail here. Both are viable alternatives for imple-
menting your data warehousing environment. It is important to understand
the basic principles of each in order to select the approach that will work the
best for your organization. Having a good grasp of the most prevalent data
architectures can improve your understanding of any other approaches that
your organization may consider or choose to adopt.
These data architectures are each deﬁned within the context of an overall
data warehouse methodology. The data architectures described next are pulled
from each methodology.
Bottom-Up Data Architecture
The bottom-up approach has been well documented by Ralph Kimball and
his colleagues in his Data Warehouse Toolkit series of texts. This approach has a
strong focus on the end user and the delivery of value to the business. The goal
is to ensure support across the enterprise for consistent reporting and analysis.

Chapter 9
■Architecture, Infrastructure, and Tools
287
Much of the emphasis has been on how the data must be structured in order
to support business reporting and analysis. This sets up the vision for how
the data will work together today and into the future. The entire end-to-end
architecture is called the data warehouse/business intelligence system.
The vision for data delivery must be supported by robust capabilities to
build and maintain these data structures. Careful thought and planning is
required to ensure a sustainable set of processes to build and maintain these
integrated dimensional structures. Figure 9-3showsthe bottom-up architecture

Figure 9-3 Bottom-up data architecture approach
Each of these steps is described as the data ﬂows from the source system;
however, they are typically designed in the reverse. The ﬁrst thing to be
deﬁned is the target dimensional data structure to support the business. Then,
the work begins to determine what is needed to build a sustainable process to
maintain these structures.
It is important to understand that integration of data across the enterprise
is a foundation of this data architecture. This integration must be ensured
from perspective of end user access. This is accomplished using conformed
dimensions, as described in Chapter 7.
Capture/Create the Data: Source Systems
Data is extracted from the underlying source systems. These may include major
operational application systems, departmental databases, or data purchased

288
Part IV
■Building the Project
from third-party sources. The data architecture of this layer is determined by
the source systems.
The source system data architecture is the same regardless of the data warehouse
data architecture approach.
Extract the Data
This is a step that is part of the extract, transform, and load system. This is
simply the ﬁrst step of gathering the data to feed to ETL processes. There
is no speciﬁc data store deﬁned for this layer. If the underlying source systems
do not retain history, then the raw input ﬁles may be backed up for future
use. Archiving the raw input ﬁles (by the source system or here) is useful to
support reprocessing of the data if necessary over time.
There are not substantial differences between the two data architecture approaches
for data extraction.
Prepare the Data: The ETL Data Stores
This is where the hard work of building the data warehouse/business intelli-
gence system begins. Many different functions are performed on the data in
order to get it ready for use. The data architecture focuses on how the data will
be stored, rather than the functions themselves. The functions are discussed
in more detail in Chapter 10. Here, the data architecture of the ETL system is
outlined:
1. What data will be stored here (reference and/or transaction data)? Data
needed for running the ETL system itself will reside here. Often reference
data is used for validation and preparing dimensions. The transactions
data will ﬂow through the system but will not necessarily be stored here.
2. What is the primary purpose of keeping the data here? Data is only kept
here to keep the ETL system running—for example, data used for valida-
tion and audit tracking.
3. How will the data be structured? The data should be structured in a
manner to expedite the periodic processing of the ETL system itself.
Often this is achieved with simple ﬂat-ﬁle or single-table structures. If the
ETL challenges are great enough, more rigorous data structures may be
used to facilitate ETL processing.
4. What is the persistence of the data or how much history will be stored?
Reference data needed to ensure data quality will be kept. This could
include a master list of products and customers. It is important to retain
the keys that are assigned during ETL processing. Most transaction data
will ﬂow through the ETL system. Only the transactions necessary to
successfully process the next periodic load will be retained. For example,
30 days of sales transactions may be retained in order to apply sales

Chapter 9
■Architecture, Infrastructure, and Tools
289
adjustments appropriately. In this example, almost all adjustments ﬂow
through within two weeks, so 30 days accommodates the business need.
5. Who will be able to use the data here? Access to the data in the ETL data
stores is limited to the programs and utilities that comprise the ETL
system. The sole purpose of the ETL system is to prepare the data for
reporting and analysis. No business users are allowed to access and query
this environment. This allows pre-processing of data, tuning for batch
processes, and eliminates the need for user security. The entire focus is
on efﬁcient preparation of the data.
6. What type of data access will they have? Access is through programs or
utilities to run the ETL system itself.
Both the bottom-up and top-down approaches utilize ETL data stores to efﬁciently
and accurately process the data. However, the top-down approach also includes a
physical data store here, called the data warehouse.
Publish the Data: The Presentation Server
The purpose of the presentation server is to deliver the data to the business
user or analyst. Following are the primary considerations:
1. What data will be stored here (reference and/or transaction data)? All of
the transaction detail data will be stored here. This is needed to support
the business. Core reference data will be stored as dimensions here. All
data that has potential business value should ﬂow from the source system
through the ETL system and be loaded here.
2. What is the primary purpose of keeping the data here? The data is to be
used for business analysis and reporting. This includes basic querying,
reporting, scorecards, dashboards, business intelligence, and analytical
modeling.
3. How will the data be structured? The data is to be organized in dimen-
sional structures. These may be star schemas in a relational database tech-
nology or inherent in a multidimensional cube technology. The dimen-
sions are to be conformed to enable integration at query time across the
enterprise.
4. What is the persistence of the data or how much history will be stored?
All data needed to support the business requirements will be stored in
these dimensional structures, including atomic transaction detail.
5. Who will be able to use the data here? Data in the presentation servers
is organized to support many business users for their reporting and
analytical needs. The data is intended to be accessed with interactive
queries by the business community. Appropriate security measures must
be put in place based upon business requirements to ensure that only
authorized users are able to access the data.

290
Part IV
■Building the Project
6. What type of data access will they have? Most business users will have
interactive query capabilities. Some may be recipients of more structured,
static reports. Again, this is driven by the business requirements.
The primary data storage for the bottom-up approach is here, in the presentation
servers. These are architected using conformed dimensions as a foundation for this
approach. The top-down approach may also physically store data in a similar manner,
called data marts. Conformed dimensions are not required with the top-down
approach, but they are highly recommended. If this part of the top-down approach
is implemented with conformed dimensions, then this layer is quite similar to the
bottom-up approach. With the top-down approach, this part of the architecture may
also be implemented with a semantic layer on the data warehouse itself, rather than
physically storing the data.
Use the Data: Business Intelligence Applications
Technologies used to access data today often include some mechanism to
store data as part of how the tool works. The data architecture for using the
data is dictated by how the organization’s data access tool(s) function. The
organization must understand each tool, and which is being used, so that
appropriate measures can be taken to ensure that the data continues to be
handled in a consistent, reliable manner.
Both the bottom-up and top-down approaches have similar data architectures here,
as it is driven by the data access technology.
The data architecture role here is to ensure that the organization has a
clear understanding of what data is stored as part of the business intelligence
application. The goal is to have a structured, organized approach here too. For
a technology that requires the creation of a multi-dimensional cube of data, a
new cube should not be created for every new report that is needed. Rather,
more robust cubes should be created to support a variety of reporting needs.
These application-speciﬁc data stores must also have planned maintenance,
including updates, corrections, and additions to the data. The data architecture
must also recognize the need for backup and recovery of these data stores.
Now that the basic data architecture of the bottom-up approach has been
discussed, it is time to take a similar look at the top-down approach.
Top-Down Data Architecture
This approach was developed and popularized by Bill Inmon and Claudia
Imhoff. Several other key individuals have also contributed to the reﬁnement
and success of this approach, which you can learn more about in Corporate
Information Factory, Second Edition, by W. H. Inmon, Claudia Imhoff, and Ryan
Sousa (Wiley, 2001) and Mastering Data Warehouse Design by Claudia Imhoff,
Nicholas Galemmo, and Jonathon Geiger (Wiley, 2003).

Chapter 9
■Architecture, Infrastructure, and Tools
291
The most successful implementations of the top-down data architecture are
grounded in business requirements. The overall approach is iterative. With
each iteration, the scope of data is set based upon business objectives and
requirements. Then work begins on the data. The data sources are identiﬁed
and the data is extracted. Each layer of the data architecture is deﬁned,
starting with the source and moving forward, designing each step along the
way—hence, the top-down label. Once the deﬁned scope of data is addressed,
a subsequent iteration is deﬁned and the process repeats. Figure 9-4 shows the
basic data architecture for the top-down data architecture approach.

Figure 9-4 Top-down data architecture approach
Capture/Create the Data
Data is extracted from the underlying source systems. These may include major
operational application systems, departmental databases, or data purchased
from third-party sources. The data architecture of this layer is determined by
the source systems.
The source system data architecture is the same regardless of the data warehouse
data architecture approach.
Extract the Data: The Staging Data Store
Extracting data from the source systems is simply the ﬁrst step in the overall
ETL system. The goal here is to acquire the data from across the organization

292
Part IV
■Building the Project
as input to the rest of the ETL processing. This provides the raw input data
to be processed, but not the other data needed for ETL processing. Where the
extracted data is stored is referred to as the staging data store. The deﬁnition of
this staging data store in the top-down architecture follows.
1. What data will be stored here (reference and/or transaction data)? This
layer contains all of the raw input data, including both transaction and
reference data.
2. What is the primary purpose of keeping the data here? The data is stored
here as input for ETL processing. This may also be used as a source for the
raw input data if the source system does not retain history. This may also
serve the purpose of preserving data as provided by the source system.
This supports reprocessing of the data if errors are found in the business
rules or there are changes to how the data is to be processed. How will
the data be structured? The data is structured as it is provided. This may
be a copy of the source system structures or an extract ﬁle.
3. What is the persistence of the data or how much history will be stored?
The amount of data that must be retained in the data staging area depends
upon the characteristics of the underlying source systems. If the data can
be easily provided again, then there is limited value in keeping another
copy of the data here. However, if the data rolls off the source system
database and is no longer available, there may be good reason to keep
a copy of the data here. Even if the raw input data needs to be retained
for possible future use, it may be more cost effective to archive the data,
rather than keep it online. Data that has been archived can be retrieved
for reprocessing if necessary.
4. Who will be able to use the data here? The data staging area is to be used
by the data warehouse processing, either programs or utilities.
5. What type of data access will be available? The access will be in a batch
mode, when the data warehouse processes are run. This may be monthly,
daily, or perhaps more frequently if the business requires it.
There are no substantial differences between the two data architecture approaches for
data extraction. More deﬁnition is put around this area with the top-down approach.
Prepare the Data: The Data Warehouse
A lot of work is required to prepare the data for reporting and analysis. The
top-down approach recommends creating a collection of the historical data as
the basis for publishing and using all data. This collection of data is called the
data warehouse. Data is cleansed, validated, and integrated prior to being loaded
into this data warehouse. As noted in Figure 9-4, ETL data stores are needed
to support the processing of the raw data in the staging data store for loading

Chapter 9
■Architecture, Infrastructure, and Tools
293
into the data warehouse. The content and purpose of these ETL data stores is
similar to those described for the bottom-up approach. The characteristics of
the data warehouse are:
1. What data will be stored here (reference and/or transaction data)? His-
torical data, needed to satisfy business requirements, will be stored in the
data warehouse. This includes all historical transactions and history of
all reference data that can be captured within the scope of what has been
addressed to date.
2. What is the primary purpose of keeping the data here? The purpose is
to facilitate the integration of data across the enterprise and to provide
a single platform to store the data. The data should support analytical
and reporting needs of the organization. The data warehouse serves as
the central component of the enterprise solution. All of the data is loaded
here and then distributed as needed.
3. How will the data be structured? The data structures follow traditional,
sound data design principles. The data is organized into subject areas. It is
organized in a traditional third normal form. The modeling technique for
this data organization is called entity-relationship modeling (see Chapter
7). This data represents the pure data relationships, and when done
properly eliminates redundancy.
4. What is the persistence of the data or how much history will be stored?
In theory, all of the history that may be needed by the business is to
be retained in the data warehouse. All of the historical transactions
are retained here. The data warehouse also includes all changes to any
reference data for the entire period of time that the transaction data is
needed. Data may be archived or deleted from the data warehouse when
it is no longer needed by the business.
5. Who will be able to use the data here? Theoretically, business users may
access the data in the data warehouse. However, the complexity of the
data structures can make it difﬁcult to write queries, and the data is not
organized for optimal query performance. It is not recommended that
large numbers of users access the data warehouse structures directly.
Data that is needed by many people should be published, as described
in the next layer. There are probably a handful of highly sophisticated,
data-savvy users with strong technical skills who are capable of accessing
the data warehouse directly. These are often market researchers, actuaries,
or statisticians.
6. What type of data access will they have? The primary access to the data
warehouse is through programs and utilities used to distribute data to
the data marts. Limited user access to these tables is possible, but not
recommended for ad hoc querying.

294
Part IV
■Building the Project
Both the bottom-up and top-down approaches utilize ETL data stores to efﬁciently
and accurately process the data. However, the bottom-up approach does not include the
data warehouse data storage as deﬁned here. The primary data storage for a bottom-up
approach is in the next layer.
Publish the Data: Data Marts
In order to more directly support each business area, a collection of the data
needed for that speciﬁc area can be loaded into a data mart. Each data mart
is intended to directly support the needs of a speciﬁc business group. It may
be possible to deﬁne a semantic layer on top of the data warehouse to provide
the data mart view. If so, the data is not physically moved from the data
warehouse. The data architecture would reﬂect this here. It is also common
for data to be physically moved from the data warehouse into data marts.
This requires another layer of extraction, transformation, and loading (ETL)
to move the data from the data warehouse to the data mart(s). The following
describes the characteristics of this physical movement of data. As noted in
Figure 9-4, additional ETL data stores may be needed to support ETL processes
to load data marts. In some cases, the structures of the data warehouse itself
may be modiﬁed to support the processes to load and maintain data marts.
Mastering Data Warehouse Design, by Claudia Imhoff, Nicholas Galemmo, and
Jonathon Geiger (Wiley, 2003), is a good resource to learn more about these
techniques.
1. What data will be stored here (reference and/or transaction data)? The
data needed to support the speciﬁc business analysis is to be loaded. Theo-
retically, only summarized data is needed because the detailed transac-
tions are in the data warehouse itself. In reality, all frequently used
transaction data is loaded into the data mart. The reference data needed
to support analysis is also loaded into the data mart.
2. What is the primary purpose of keeping the data here? The data marts
are designed to support speciﬁc business groups or analyses.
3. How will the data be structured? The data is usually stored in dimensional
structures in the data mart. The dimensional structures may be physically
stored in a relational database or a multidimensional cube (this is a
characteristic of the technical architecture). Sometimes data is stored
in structures that are speciﬁcally tailored to the business application.
For example, a ﬂat ﬁle may be created to support a speciﬁc insurance
catastrophe modeling software package. If a semantic layer is used, rather
than physically moving the data, then that should be noted here.
4. What is the persistence of the data or how much history will be stored?
The historical data requirement varies according to the speciﬁc business

Chapter 9
■Architecture, Infrastructure, and Tools
295
need for this data mart. This could result in the same data being loaded
into multiple data marts, with different amounts of history. For example,
actuariesmayuse tenyearsofclaimshistory, whereasclaimsmanagement
may only use ﬁve years.
5. Who will be able to use the data here? The data marts are designed
speciﬁcally to support many business users for their reporting and ana-
lytical needs. This may be thousands of customer service representatives
reviewing prior day performance, hundreds of suppliers tracking their
progress toward annual goals, or an executive dashboard reviewed by a
handful of executives to track corporate performance.
6. What type of data access will they have? The access is direct to the
data mart via a data access or query environment or perhaps through
interactive reports published through the company’s intranet.
Because integration is achieved in the data warehouse itself, the top-down approach
does not require integration of these data marts. However, the use of conformed
dimensions is recommended to enhance consistency and reduce redundant efforts.
When the data marts are physically built using conformed dimensions, this is similar
to the presentation server layer of the bottom-up approach. With the top-down
approach, this part of the architecture may also be implemented with a semantic layer
on the data warehouse itself, rather than physically storing the data.
Use the Data: Business Intelligence Applications
The characteristics of using the data are exactly the same for both the bottom-up
and top-down approaches. The data architecture is driven by how the data
access tool itself functions. The reason why it should be included in the overall
data architecture is to ensure that appropriate measures are put in place so
that the data continues to be treated in a consistent, reliable manner.
Both the bottom-up and top-down approaches have similar data architectures here,
as it is driven by the data access technology.
Adopting an Architecture
The IT professionals select or create the data architecture with the input of the
business community. This chapter does not provide a step-by-step process to
create the data architecture, but rather provides the background necessary
to help the business and IT management understand the architecture. There
needs to be a cross section of people involved in deﬁning the data architecture.
This group should have representation from the ETL and BI application
developers because they often have the deepest understanding of many of the
data-speciﬁc challenges facing the organization. It is also important to keep
the overall business objectives of the data warehouse in mind.

296
Part IV
■Building the Project
Both the bottom-up and top-down approaches have developed strong
advocates, and both have hundreds of implementations. For each, a few are
wildly successful, many are moderately successful, some struggle, and a few
fail outright. One of the biggest hurdles in deﬁning an architecture is that
many people become entrenched with one approach and are unable to look
objectively at the overall situation. You want to involve intelligent, strong
people, but they must still be able to consider alternatives to make the right
decision for the organization.
Established industry approaches provide the beneﬁt of the culmination of
many years of experience. However, several common mistakes are made when
adopting the approaches described here.
Common Mistakes Adopting the Top-Down Approach
It is too easy for IT to fall into their comfort zone and perform traditional
entity-relationship modeling without frequent, ongoing communication
with the business.
The project can get caught up in foundation work with no line of sight to
any real business purpose.
Organizations can build the data warehouse foundation with no end user
deliverable. The project can lose funding before ﬁnding a worthwhile
business problem to solve.
It is too easy to build non-integrated data marts. These marts are tailored
to different business needs and the data is often transformed differently
for each mart. This creates multiple, usually differing versions of what
should be the same data.
Building an entire data warehouse prior to delivering any business
intelligence applications takes too long and costs too much.
Common Mistakes Adopting the Bottom-Up Approach
Building dimensional data marts that do not integrate.
Too often, projects pull only data needed to support a speciﬁc report or
target.
Quickly populating the data marts without a sustainable set of processes
to maintain them.
Abandoning all system development rigor to move data faster.
Moving data into dimensional structures and then asking whether this
would be useful. This is often done with frequent iterations and without
careful data analysis and an understanding of real business needs.

Chapter 9
■Architecture, Infrastructure, and Tools
297
Success Factors for Both Approaches
The mistakes with either approach are at odds with their true intent and pur-
pose. Many of the risks outlined above can be mitigated by ensuring that all
data warehouse efforts are grounded in business requirements. Studying the
differences between the data architectures also yields insight into the common
themes that contribute to success. These include the following:
Pull all the business data from source systems.
Keep focused on end users and how to deliver value.
Develop the overall strategy and then implement in phases.
Use common sense—make sure you understand what you are trying to
accomplish and make decisions accordingly.
Build the subject areas or parts that you need as you go. Add on later.
There is no substitute for careful, detailed data analysis. You need to
understand the actual data in the context of the source system. You also
need to know how the business wants to look at the data.
This is not intended to be a complete list of success factors, but the things
that should be kept in mind while making decisions about data architecture.
This entire book is intended to help organizations learn techniques to be able
to successfully design, implement, and use a data warehouse.
Now that data architecture has been discussed, it is time to move on and
take a look at technical architecture.
Technical Architecture
Technical architecture addresses the organization and structure of the collection
of hardware and software technologies that are installed to support the
development and delivery of the data warehouse.
This is the area where change is constant. Existing technologies are enhanced
and new technologies emerge. Change is continuous for both software and
hardware options. This text does not address speciﬁc technical products.
Regardless of what happens with technology, the basic functionality needed
to get the work done remains constant.
The responsibility for technical architecture belongs squarely with IT. The IT
professionals have the education and skills needed to make solid technical rec-
ommendations. From a business perspective, you need to ensure that these
recommendations and decisions are being made wisely. The following sections
describe what you need to know about technical architecture.

298

■Building the Project
Technical Architecture Basics
While the speciﬁc technical speciﬁcations can be left to the IT professionals,
it is important to ensure that the overall environment is set up for success. In
fact, three separate environments are needed, as shown in Figure 9-5.

Figure 9-5 Recommended technical environments
There should be a separate technical environment for development, test,
and production work. This is no different from what should be in place for
any other systems development environment. The production environment is
needed to ensure the stability and reliability of the data warehouse. This
is what the business depends on. Development work is often divided into
smaller parts. Creating a separate development environment enables work
to be done on each of these parts at the same time. Once all the individual
parts are completed, the entire system can be moved to the test environment,
where testing can be done to ensure that all the different parts are working
properly. A full copy of the entire data warehouse does not typically exist
in the development and test environments. Rather, a representative subset of
data is available to support developing and testing activities.
These separate environments are also needed to support upgrades to the
software tools too. It is too risky to install a new product release directly on
a production environment. There are too many variables that could cause the
product to not function when ﬁrst loaded on your machines. The new software
needs to be loaded and exercised, and any problems need to be corrected in
order for the business to use the data warehouse.

Chapter 9
■Architecture, Infrastructure, and Tools
299
Each of these environments must be able to support the complete end-to-end
work associated with the data warehouse. This is shown as the work that ﬂows
with the data warehouse data architecture. Often, the development and test
environments are each set up on a separate server. The production environment
frequently involves multiple servers that are geared and tuned for that speciﬁc
function. The speciﬁc number of servers needed is determined as part of your
technical architecture.
Components of Technical Architecture
As with data architecture, there are many layers of a technical architecture. On
top of that, there may be a different product to deliver each major function.
The layers are quite basic:
Hardware
Operating system
Functional software such as database management system or query tool
The hardware and operating system layers for a data warehouse often
align with the standards already in place within an organization. Examples of
some of the types of functional software products that are needed for a data
warehouse include the following:
Data modeling
Database management system (relational, columnar, multidimensional)
Data extraction
Transformation and manipulation, including cleansing
Data loading
Data access (simple query, reporting, business intelligence, scorecards,
dashboards, specialized analytics)
Data deﬁnitions, documentation, and other metadata
Sometimes these functions are combined into a single product. For example,
many ETL software tools support a wide variety of cleansing and transforma-
tion functions. In other cases, these functions are sold as bundled solutions that
include the hardware, operating system, and functional software. The bundled
product offering saves you the effort of selecting each separately, and all of the
technology in the bundle works well together. Taking this one step further,
there are products designed speciﬁcally to support data warehousing. The
technical design encompasses the hardware, operating system, and software

300
Part IV
■Building the Project
function. These are called data warehouse appliances. They are designed entirely
to address the functional and performance requirements of a data warehouse.
Each of these functions needs to be represented in the technical architecture.
The technical architecture should also deﬁne how these functions are split
or combined across different hardware servers. The communication paths
between the servers should also be identiﬁed.
Infrastructure
Another term that is often used when discussing architecture is infrastructure.
It is helpful to look at a general deﬁnition of infrastructure from Wikipedia:
Infrastructure typically refers to the technical structures that support a society,
such as roads, water supply, wastewater, power grids, ﬂood management systems,
telecommunications (Internet, telephone lines, broadcasting), and so forth. Most
of these systems are typically owned and managed by governments or public
utility companies. These various elements may collectively be termed civil
infrastructure. Viewed functionally, infrastructure facilitates the production of
goods and services; for example, roads enable the transport of raw materials to
the production plant and distribution of ﬁnished products to markets.
More speciﬁcally, infrastructure for the data warehouse is the foundation
technology that supports the overall environment. This includes basic net-
working services such as providing shared network drives for storing the
group’s ﬁles, such as word processing, spreadsheets, and presentations. The
existence of some sort of computer for each user can also be considered infras-
tructure. This is usually put in place when an employee is hired. The data
warehouse project does not need to order laptops so that each business analyst
has his or her own machine. Basic networking of computers, via a local area
or wireless network, is another example of infrastructure.
Each project team does not need to design and install the infrastructure, but
should ensure that there is enough capacity in the infrastructure to support
the new data warehousing, reporting, and analytical functions.
Technical Architecture in Action
The data warehouse is only one type of system that exists in an enter-
prise. The data warehouse technical architecture must ﬁt within the parameters
of the overall systems strategy. If the enterprise direction negatively impacts
the data warehouse, then the enterprise strategy should be revised.
The technical architecture is where the basic principles are deﬁned for
each project to follow. This is the blueprint showing how the different func-
tional requirements will be organized. Figure 9-6 shows a high-level technical
architecture.

In this simple example, the source systems exist on a large mainframe
computer. After the data is extracted from the source, preliminary data
validation is done, taking advantage of corporate capabilities for standard
enterprise codes. Because customer data will be pulled from multiple sources,
initial integration of customers will also begin on the mainframe. Then, the
data will be moved to a UNIX-based server to complete the cleansing and
transformation work. The database to publish the data will also be stored
on this server. If the performance of the ETL or database access degrades,
these may be split to run on two different servers. A single server will be
used to start, and another server running a Microsoft operating system will
support the business intelligence/data access and web delivery functions.
Finally, a variety of mechanisms enable end users to gain access, including
direct network connection, wireless connection, and access via the Internet.
There are likely to be more detailed technical architecture diagrams to
provide the necessary details to the different IT people who will be involved,
but these are not usually anything you need to worry about.
What You Need to Know about Technical Architecture
Technical architecture is the responsibility of the IT organization. However, if
business or IT managers have concerns about the technical architecture, this
section provides some ideas about what can be asked to ensure that the right

302
Part IV
■Building the Project
issues are being addressed. When understanding the technical architecture,
you need to determine the following:
What parts of the technical architecture are new?
What is the risk associated with that new technology?
What steps are being taken to mitigate the risk?
Do you have enough capacity to accommodate the new project with the
existing technology?
Does the technical architecture provide all the tools needed by the project
team? Why or why not?
How does the data warehouse architecture ﬁt within the overall informa-
tion technology strategies and architecture for the company?
For each product named as part of the architecture, you should also know
the following:
Will the tool provide the functionality that is needed?
Can IT effectively support it?
Will the technology deliver the performance needed?
Is this a cost-effective choice? The cost estimate needs to include initial
purchase or lease price, installation, maintenance, and support. It is
also important to consider the effort required to develop solutions with
the product. Some products may cost less but require three times the
development effort.
It is usually not necessary for the business community and management to
understand all the nuts and bolts of the technical architecture. It is necessary
to ensure that the architecture will support the work that must be done.
Navigating the Technology Jungle
The process of selecting hardware and software products is more difﬁcult
than ever before because of the many products from which to choose. Many
provide similar functionality but work in distinctly different ways. How can
you ﬁnd the right ﬁt? You must have a clear understanding of what you need
in order to select the proper technology. These requirements can help you
navigate this daunting sea of available solutions to ﬁnd the appropriate suite
of products for building and delivering the data warehouse.

Chapter 9
■Architecture, Infrastructure, and Tools
303
Weighing Technology Options
The data warehousing technology trends are very cyclical. The industry
swings between an interest in having a single vendor provide end-to-end
functionality and an interest in having multiple vendors each provide the ‘‘best
of breed’’ functions. This trend is about more than just how customers purchase
hardware and software; it is also reﬂected in product ownership. When the
industry swings toward best of breed, there are many small companies that
develop specialized products. The interest in end-to-end solutions is reﬂected
by a consolidation in the market. Smaller companies merge or the larger,
established companies buy up the companies with niche products. There is
also a fairly consistent level of interest in building and deploying the data
warehouse in house, without purchasing any specialized tools.
Best of Breed
Considerations for buying best of breed products include the following:
The ability to get the richest set of capabilities for the purpose.
Products are often ﬁnely tuned speciﬁcally for data warehouse use.
The product may or may not work well (or at all) with other products.
The complexity of problem resolution increases because the offending
vendor must ﬁrst acknowledge the problem. There can be a lot of ﬁnger-
pointing before you get down to debugging and resolving the problem.
End-to-End Solutions
Considerations for buying end-to-end solutions include the following:
Increased purchasing power with a single vendor.
Product integration should be solid.
You will not have the newest breakthrough technology in all areas.
Usually, there will be one or two critical areas in which you will gain
signiﬁcant capabilities. These are likely the reason for the interest in using
this vendor’s products in the ﬁrst place.
N O T E Some end-to-end vendor solutions are created through acquisition and
not by technical design. Tool integration may be rough initially, but usually
improves over time.

304
Part IV
■Building the Project
Deciding Not to Buy a Tool
Many smaller organizations still look at the price tag for some of these tools and
decide to build the data warehouse themselves, rather than buy a speciﬁc tool.
For example, extract, transform, and load routines could be written program-
matically, or an organization could develop its own report creation and
delivery system. Sometimes a tool is purchased to perform one function,
such as the end user data access, but other functions are developed in house.
Considerations for building your own data warehouse functionality include
the following:
Cost estimates do not adequately reﬂect the long-term maintenance of a
solution that is custom developed.
Internal IT staff is usually inexperienced with software development for
this type of functionality.
The results are static and few organizations continue to invest in devel-
oping new capabilities for the tool.
In-house development is usually the most expensive alternative in the
long run.
Finding the Right Products
The technical architecture clariﬁes what types of functional software products
are needed. Sometimes the organization already owns and uses a product, such
as a database management system. If the organization has already been actively
working on data warehousing, then enterprise standards may already exist
for which products may be used. While the goal is often to purchase (and
support) only one product to provide each of the functions, this is rarely the
case. Organizations often support more than one relational database platform,
and it is common to ﬁnd multiple data access tools in use. Each organization
must determine the costs and beneﬁts of supporting multiple tools and then
act accordingly.
For a speciﬁc project, product selection may default to simply utilizing
products the company has already purchased. Product selection may mean
choosing between two or more enterprise-approved products. In some cases,
the project team may need to search for a new product.
N O T E
Remember that the most important part of selecting any technology is
having a clear understanding of what you are trying to accomplish.
With a clear set of functionality in mind, a short list of candidate products is
usually easy to create. Rather than look in detail at ﬁfty different products,
the list can be reduced to a handful. IT organizations are usually good at

Chapter 9
■Architecture, Infrastructure, and Tools
305
looking at a technology, understanding it, and making recommendations. The
combination of business requirements and sound architecture help the IT team
to make good decisions. It is important to do the general research, conduct
several in-depth reviews, and then make a decision quickly (measured in
weeks, rather than months). Given the rate of change in the data warehouse
market, if too much time is spent on research, new products and major
enhancements will be released before a decision is made. New features lure
you into reevaluating a product, which can lead to a never-ending loop in
which no product is ever purchased.
Pick a product that can help the organization today, and will likely work
for the next several years. We often can’t imagine what might be available in
the next ﬁve years, so don’t agonize over ﬁnding a single perfect product that
will support the data warehouse for the next decade.
Requests for Information or Proposals
One of the most common mechanisms for collecting details about a product is
to issue a formal request for information (RFI) or a request for proposal (RFP).
Extensive effort is needed to develop the questions for these requests. Some
companies hire consulting ﬁrms to write the RFI/RFP for them! After the
RFI/RFP is issued, the vendors get to work. Once their responses are received,
there is another big effort to read and understand them.
One main thing that is learned from an RFI or RFP response is which
vendor has staff members who write well. Some vendors have departments
that are dedicated to writing these responses. These groups are staffed with
professional writers and often maintain a full database of questions and
answers. RFI/RFP responses also can indicate which vendors are able to
cleverly answer yes to any question or to provide details about their product
strengths within the context of almost any (often nonrelated) question asked.
Unless you are an organization that is mandated to follow this formal RFI/RFP
process (such as a government agency), this is not a recommended method for
selecting products.
Business Participation in the Selection Process
The products that the business community will be exposed to the most are
those that interface to the data warehouse. These are the data access, reporting,
and business intelligence products. The business community is often asked
to participate in the selection of these tools. While this can be helpful, your
impression of a product may depend to a large extent upon the skill and
experience of the sales representative providing the demonstration. Looking
at tools increases the understanding of what is possible, but do not allow the
ﬁrst impressions of a demonstration to be the single driving factor in selecting
a BI tool.

Understanding Product Genealogy
With the frequency of mergers and acquisitions in the data warehousing
industry, it is worthwhile to ensure that you have a good understanding of
the history of any products you are considering working with. Find out how
long the product has been in existence, other names it has been marketed
under, and who may have owned it previously. After more than 20 years in
the industry, I ﬁnd it hard to keep up with some products that have been
purchased and renamed multiple times. This information can help you with
your research to learn about the product. Having a long history and multiple
names does not inherently indicate a problem; it is simply one more thing to
know about a product.
Another genealogy that is interesting to trace is that of the key prod-
uct engineers and designers. Look at the experience of the key research
and development personnel at that company. Some product engineers have
masterminded multiple tools, with each one surpassing the former.
Understanding Value and Evaluating Your Options
There is constant pressure on software vendors to deliver more functionality
at a lower price point. This happens frequently with hardware. For example,
in the late 1980s, a 10-gigabyte database server (hardware, operating system,
and database bundled together) could be purchased for nearly $1 million.
Today, if you look for a promotion, you can buy a 2-gigabyte disk for a camera
for around $20! This reduction in the cost of disk space has greatly beneﬁted
all of us, making it affordable for us to store music, videos, and photos on
our personal computers. There has been a similar reduction in the cost of the
technology to produce, capture, and distribute music, photos, and videos.
If you look at the data warehousing industry, the technical platforms
and disk alternatives have certainly expanded. New lower-cost options are
available. These now enable mid- to small-tier companies to venture into data
warehousing in ways that were not feasible in the past.
Although the price for some technology does indeed go down as it becomes
more available, that is not always the case. Many of the high-end data ware-
housing tools are still quite costly. These software companies must still invest in
highly skilled developers, and sales and support staff, to be able to market and
support their products. As customers, we demand more functionality for less
money, with superior support. This is a tall order for any company to achieve.
To remain viable, technology vendors are under constant pressure to win
new business. Sales and marketing departments are highly skilled at taking
customer demands and then reﬁning their message to resonate with those
requirements. Whether the products will actually meet your requirements is
another issue. The message is intended to keep the company in the running to
win your business.

Chapter 9
■Architecture, Infrastructure, and Tools
307
Unfortunately, the pressure that you, as the customer, put on the data
warehousing vendors contributes to the marketing hype. Intense competition
also contributes to inﬂated marketing messages. For example, suppose that
four out of ﬁve vendors under consideration claim to be able to have the initial
data warehouse up and running in ninety days. What would your reaction be
if the ﬁfth vendor suggested that it will actually take six months to get the
initial data warehouse running? In many cases, the ﬁfth vendor would be cut
from the selection process because they appear to be less efﬁcient than the
others. Unfortunately, the ﬁfth vendor may be the only one with a realistic
estimate. This pattern encourages all of the vendors to focus their message on
the latest trends or hot topics.
Another thing that impedes your ability to gain a true understanding of
a product is the implementation of ‘‘stopgap functionality.’’ Most vendors
offer potential buyers a list of questions and answers about a product’s core
functionality. Often, a speciﬁc function or feature emerges on these lists,
one that has not been commonly offered. As soon as one competitor can
provide this capability, the others quickly need to follow suit or they risk
losing valuable business. Unfortunately, sometimes the capability is added in
a convoluted ad hoc manner that makes it difﬁcult to really utilize. However,
the ability to deliver this feature can now be claimed during the sales pitch.
A CASE STUDY: MISLEADING INTEGRATION FUNCTIONALITY
A commonly requested data access tool function is the capability to integrate
data from spreadsheets with data from the data warehouse. This has been
requested for years. The intent is to enable a business user to bring into an
analysis data that is not loaded in the data warehouse. Many data access
products have tackled this in different ways. Without revealing names,
one product provided a very nice demonstration of this functionality by
creating a report during the meeting. A query was saved and then a spread-
sheet on the user’s desktop was selected to bring into the tool. The data was
integrated using the product codes and a nice clean report showed the data
warehouse results side by side with the spreadsheet input. This was simple,
powerful, and compelling.
So, what is misleading? The technology works as advertised, as long as there
is a column of data in both the query results and the spreadsheet that can be
used to integrate the data. In reality, it is unlikely that the data on a spreadsheet
will have codes or identiﬁers that will be cleanly and accurately integrated with
the data from the data warehouse. The technology works, but it does not really
provide the desired business functionality. This is not a defect in the data
access product, but rather the reality of the data in any organization. The tool
provides the functionality, but it can’t be implemented in a meaningful way.

■Building the Project
Cutting through the Marketing Hype
For anyone, business or IT, involved with selecting a product, you must be
wary of sales and marketing messages. As with purchasing any other product,
a good consumer is an informed consumer. Remember that the objective of
those marketing messages is to entice you to purchase that particular product.
Their goal is to get you to buy. As long as you keep that in mind, you can use
the sales process to your beneﬁt.
First, develop a partnering relationship with any vendors you may be
working with. This will set the tone for how you interact over the long
term. Good account representatives understand the value of honesty and hard
work. This helps both you and their company to develop a solid, long-term
relationship. Express your interest in understanding the product offering.
Communicate that a single ‘‘no’’ answer will not immediately cause the
vendor to be eliminated from the selection process. Pose your questions in a
curious manner, not confrontationally.
Another way to help get clear answers is to work with the vendor’s
consultants or systems engineers, rather than the sales representative. Most
sales reps are honest, but even those with the highest integrity have been
known to exaggerate from time to time. The consultants are the ones assigned
to implement what was sold. If the product doesn’t do what you need, the
consultants don’t want to be left holding the bag.
INTERPRETING VENDOR RESPONSES
Question: Can I see how you do xyz?
Response: I am sorry that I can’t show you that capability today because it is
not loaded on this machine.
Translation: I don’t know how that works and I do not want to try it in front of
you.
Question: How many customers are doing abc?
Response: Yes, our product supports the ability to abc. This is a relatively new
feature. I have not implemented it for any of my clients yet. Let me do a little
research to ﬁnd a customer who is using that capability.
Translation: This feature has been added in order to enable us to move past
certain hurdles in the sales process, but no one really uses it. As far as I can tell
it should work, but I have not seen it myself.
Question: You mentioned that the product can do lmn. This is a critical feature
for us. Can we see how that works?
(continued)

Chapter 9
■Architecture, Infrastructure, and Tools
309
INTERPRETING VENDOR RESPONSES (continued)
Response: That capability is in a future release.
Translation: Someday you will be able to use that capability, but you really
need to wait for development to ﬁnish and then wait for the bugs to be worked
out before you should stake your entire project on this function.
When preparing for a sales meeting, a good vendor sales team will ask you
to provide in advance a list of product(s) or services that are of interest, and
any speciﬁc questions or concerns. This gives them the opportunity to properly
address them during the meeting. This works to your beneﬁt. Otherwise, the
meeting may turn out to be a fact-ﬁnding mission for the sales team, which
then leads to another meeting to really address your needs.
When any vendor is showing you product features, it is important to ensure
that you walk away with a good understanding of how things are done. A
simple-looking report may have taken several days and the help of advanced
technical support staff to build. You need to know not only that the function
is possible, but also whether or not it is feasible for your project. A colleague
in London expressed this speciﬁc concern with a descriptive and colorful
phrase. The question was asked, ‘‘Is that part of the base tool or was there
some jiggery-pokery involved to produce that report?’’ What a wonderful
expression! Using a little ‘‘jiggery-pokery’’ is not inherently a bad thing to get
the results you want. It only becomes a problem when you are not aware that
this is what is involved.
The Value of References
One of the most useful things you can do when making product choices is to
talk with other organizations that are using that product. The ﬁrst path to ﬁnd
these other companies is to ask the vendor for references. Everyone’s ﬁrst
instinct is to request to talk to another company in the same industry with
data of similar size and complexity. That puts any vendor in a tight spot.
The only companies that meet these criteria are your top competitors. If those
companies use this product, it is unlikely that they would be willing to speak
with you. Clearly, the vendor should not be sharing too many details about
these installations with you either. You would not want them telling others
anything about your installation, would you?
Explore other possible references with that vendor. Request to speak with
companies from other industries that support a similar business function
(ﬁnance, human resources), size, or complexity. This should be sufﬁcient to
get a good idea of how the product is working in a similar setting.

310

■Building the Project
Have discussions with people at different levels in the reference organi-
zation. It is helpful to touch base with other managers, but it can also be
enlightening to have developers talk to each other too.
There are otheravenuesforseekingoutreferencestoo. Tapintoyournetwork

(data warehouse and/or your industry) conferences and seminars. Some of
the things that you may consider asking a reference include the following:
How responsive is the vendor organization?
Is there a difference in responsiveness for sales questions or problem
resolution?
How strong is the customer input process for product development?
How are development priorities set?
Explore the size of the installation: How many licenses? How many peo-
ple use the tool? On how many servers is the software installed? How
large is the data?
What parts of the product do you use?
Does the product work as advertised?
What is the worst thing you have learned about the product, or your
biggest disappointment?
What is the best surprise or most positive thing you have learned about
the product?
How long have you used the product?
How many major releases have you participated in?
How smooth was the release upgrade process?
How stable are new releases?
These are just a few of the questions that you can ask (or answer) that relate
to the vendor and the product, but don’t reveal details about how you are
leveraging the technology.
N O T E
Return the favor. After you have worked with a product, be willing to be a
reference for your vendors. This may require permission from corporate
communications.
Making Architecture Work for You
The key to having architecture work for, rather than against, you is to maintain
the balance between structure and ﬂexibility. Architecture can get out of con-
trol. It can take on a life of its own when the purpose and business goals are lost.
Architecture can also gain so much power that it gets in the way of delivering

Chapter 9
■Architecture, Infrastructure, and Tools
311
value to the organization. Some organizations have separate enterprise groups
that specialize in architecture. These groups typically deﬁne and maintain the
enterprise architectures. They also assist individual projects and groups to
understand and implement the architectures. The architecture group can act
as gatekeepers who decide which projects meet the rigorous standards and
which are not allowed to continue. It is much more effective when enter-
prise architecture groups focus on educating and helping projects, rather than
simply enforcing compliance.
At the other extreme, some organizations work so fast and so hard that
they never ﬁnd the time to step back and develop an overall plan. This results
in many disparate systems. Each project expends time and energy to pick
products or determine a data strategy. These duplicate efforts are a waste of
corporate resources.
The optimal architecture provides the structure and direction for each
initiative. It is also ﬂexible, and changes are made to the architecture when a
reasonable business case is presented.
Just-In-Time Architecture
While architecture provides the long-term vision, it may not be feasible for
the ﬁrst project to set up everything. With the vision in mind, parts of the
architecture can be implemented at different times. Perhaps the data needed
for the ﬁrst project is small enough to be adequately supported using only a
single server for the ETL, published data, and data access. When more data is
added, additional servers can also be added. Each project should review which
existing components could be leveraged. After that, the project can build out
any missing parts that are needed to deliver the solution.
I must thank a very experienced colleague for describing this process as
just-in-time architecture. This is similar to a manufacturing company whereby
components are delivered just before they are needed. Each piece of the
architecture can be put in place in time for the project that needs this level
of support or functionality. Another way to state this is to ‘‘think globally
and build locally.’’ The architecture provides the overall framework, and the
implementation is performed as needed to support projects.
In Real Life
To get a glimpse into common challenges with architecture, several issues
facing our friends from Giant Company and Agile, Inc., are discussed next.
Architecture at Giant
The company has a well-established centralized architecture group. All projects
must go through an architecture review and approval process. The architec-
ture has a heavy emphasis on operational application systems. The architects

312
Part IV
■Building the Project
themselves have years of experience, but limited exposure to any data ware-
housing concepts. Whenever a data warehouse project comes up for a review,
the results are frustrating. The data warehouse project data and technical
architectures do not ﬁt neatly into the enterprise system architecture. The data
warehouse projects are often sent back for changes and the review process
begins again.
This has resulted in many reporting and analysis needs being met by
information initiatives that circumvent the entire IT organization. The busi-
ness groups fund the work directly. Many disparate data-warehouse–like
databases have been built using a wide array of technologies. The immediate
business needs are usually met, but the work is not extensible and is not
leveraged across the enterprise.
The centralized architecture group must get data warehouse training. The
architectures themselves must be expanded to accommodate data ware-
house requirements. Then marketing and communication effort is needed
to let the rest of the organization know of the changes in the architecture. New
projects should use the new architecture. Strategies must be developed for
existing projects so they can adopt the new architecture over time.
Agile Ignores the Need for Architecture
Each individual division is empowered to do whatever it needs to get its
work done, including the purchasing of technology. This has resulted in a
proliferation of products, many of which provide similar functionality. In
several cases, each group purchased its own copy of a technology and the
organization now owns duplicate licenses.
In addition to the base cost of purchasing products, each group is responsible
for the installation and support of its own platforms. Some applications are
small and do not justify hiring a full-time systems administrator, so existing
staff members are asked to take on these responsibilities.
From a data architecture perspective, each autonomous division looks out
for its own interests. This has made it extremely difﬁcult for the corporate
executives to understand the dynamics of the company and to set the direction.
These strategic decisions are made based on personal experience and limited
facts.
The organization needs to invest some time and energy to develop an enter-
prise architecture for the data warehouse. The technical architecture can help
to consolidate data warehouse technology. This will increase its purchasing
power, and help coordinate the support and maintenance functions. Deﬁning
the data architecture is the just the ﬁrst step toward delivering integrated data
to the senior staff. To make the effort of developing the architecture worthwhile,
the organization must follow through to ensure that it is implemented.

Summary
This chapter has reviewed the fundamentals of data and technical architecture.
What does this mean to you? Following are some basic questions that you
should be able to answer about data warehousing in your organization:
Do you have a data warehouse architecture? Where is it documented?
Does the data warehouse architecture cover both data and technology?
Do you have a basic understanding of the DW architecture?
Who is responsible for revising and updating the architecture?
Do you know how well your project is or is not adhering to the overall
architecture? Why or why not?
How do project teams learn about and leverage the DW architecture?
Does architecture get in the way of getting things done on your project?
Does the team need to learn more about the architecture in order to
implement it effectively?
Is the architecture too rigid, not adapting to changes in goals?
Are enterprise ideas merely ﬂeeting, with no actual follow-through?
These questions will help you gain a working understanding of where the
organization stands and how much work is yet to be done. Use this as the cata-
lyst to get something started, make adjustments mid-stream, and reﬁne what
is already in place.
While architecture is mostly a systems responsibility, it is important that
both business and systems managers have a sound understanding of how
architecture is being used within the organization. You don’t need to be able
to design one; and at the lowest level of details, you don’t need to know the
speciﬁc technical speciﬁcations, but you should have a solid understanding
of the overall direction and how it will help the organization in the long run.
The next chapter looks more closely at what is involved in building the data
warehouse.

Implementation: Building the
Database
The IT work involved in building the database is one of the most difﬁcult
and complex parts of implementing a data warehouse environment. There are
many resources to provide guidance for the project team and technical staff to
help accomplish this goal. For the purposes of this text, the focus of database
building will be at a high level. Rather than share the nitty-gritty design details,
a summary is all that you need. However, it is important for all managers
(business and IT) to have a basic understanding of what is happening during
this part of the project.
This chapter provides a representative sample of the work that needs to be
done, but is not intended to be an all-inclusive reference. It is also important
to know how you can help and what is expected of you during this very
technical part of the project. This chapter provides both a foundation and
insight into how managers and other members of the business community
should be involved.
Extract, Transform, and Load (ETL) Fundamentals
The ETL (extract, transform, and load) work is the most frequently underes-
timated work that is done on a data warehouse project. It is also the least
understood set of tasks by everyone other than the developers themselves. It
would seem simple: Copy the data, move it around a little bit, and load it for
use. In reality, the ETL process is rarely straightforward and simple. Having a
good understanding of the work that must be done and the condition of the
existing data will help the project team to better estimate the effort and length
of time needed to build the data warehouse.
What Work Is Being Done?
If the work is not that simple, what is actually happening? There are several
major steps to developing an ETL system. While it is easy to move data
315

316
Part IV
■Building the Project
around, the goal here is to create a complete system that can be turned over
to the operations group to run, and that is not as simple to accomplish. The
same characteristics of any other production system must apply to the data
warehouse too. The goal is to build a full system that runs without manual
intervention.
CHARACTERISTICS OF A PRODUCTION SYSTEM
A full production system must be able to do the following:
■Gracefully handle exceptions that are identiﬁed in the incoming data.
■Provide warning and error messages to ﬂag conditions in
the data that require further attention. These may be con-
ditions that can be programmatically addressed in the sys-
tem or they may require human intervention to resolve.
■Ensure restart and fallback capabilities in case the system is interrupted
due to processing errors or environmental issues (e.g., a computer goes
down).
■Provide an audit trail to trace how data ﬂows through the
system. This is needed to help track problems back through
the ETL system and/or the underlying source systems.
■Include backup and recovery of the database itself.
Several major steps are involved in the development of a production ETL
system:
1. ETL system requirements: Up to this point, the requirements and design
components of the project have focused on what the end result must look
like. The data model reﬂects how the data is to be stored. Many detailed
requirements have already been collected during other project activities,
such as individual data element names and deﬁnitions. Data proﬁling
activities should yield insight into what the current data looks like, and
strong data governance may have already determined how each data
element is to be handled. Additional requirements for the ETL system
must also be deﬁned. Examples of these requirements include processing
rules, guidelines for compliance with legal requirements, a processing
window, and what the audit trail must include.
2. ETL system design: The dimensional model is the target that the ETL
system will build. The ETL system design provides the details about
how to get from where the data is now to this target dimensional model.
Some organizations require that every little detail be deﬁned, including
all of the speciﬁc rules for building the dimension, and that fact tables

Chapter 10
■Implementation: Building the Database
317
be documented prior to starting to build the ETL system. Others sketch
a quick high-level data ﬂow on a napkin and then start building. There
must be some balance here. It is impossible to track down every little
detail that may be discovered in the data prior to starting work on the
ETL system. However, it is important to create speciﬁcations deﬁning
how the ETL system will work. These are developed using the results
from the requirements, including data element deﬁnitions, data mapping,
and insight from source data analysis. This is even more critical if the
construction work is to be done by third-party developers. Part of the
overall design should also address functionality to keep the ETL system
itself running, including an audit trail and backup/recovery capabilities.
3. ETL system construction: This is the actual development of the system
itself, which may include writing programs or using technology to per-
form the work. This work can be divided up among different people or
even different teams. Using the cohesive design, each team can work on
its part. There may be some dependencies between the teams, but much
of the work can be done at the same time.
4. ETL system testing: Because there are typically different people working
on different parts of the system, it is important to conduct thorough and
complete testing of the entire system. This also provides the opportu-
nity to identify any bottlenecks and improve the system’s performance.
In order to prepare for testing, a series of test cases need to be devel-
oped to provide realistic conditions to determine whether the system
is working properly. These test cases must represent actual business
situations and need to be deﬁned by representatives from the business
community.
As discussed so far in this book, many of the facets of building a data ware-
house are different from other traditional systems design and development.
The creation of the ETL system itself is the most like any other systems devel-
opment effort. The organization must apply its systems development methods
to create a robust ETL system. This is not the time to abandon discipline and
simply move data quickly.
ETL System Functionality
What exactly does this ETL system need to do? The system will provide several
common functions. While the concepts are consistent across the marketplace,
the speciﬁcs are unique to each individual organization and its own source
systems. The following sections describe the functionality and ﬂow of an ETL
system to directly populate dimensional data structures, called presentation

318
Part IV
■Building the Project
servers or data marts. Additional steps would be needed to populate a normal-
ized data warehouse, but most of the functionality would be similar. Let’s look
at several of these common functions.
Extraction
Extracting the data can be a lot harder than it sounds. The business needs
information about the latest transactions, or those that have been processed
since the last time the ETL system was run. It is also necessary to get the
reference data that describes those transactions. For example, if an existing
customer moved but has since purchased more products, you need to know
the details about the customer’s new location and still get the purchase
transaction(s).
The challenges in extracting data are directly related to the ability of a
source system to provide new business transactions and supporting reference
data. Some systems identify when changes have happened and can easily
share the data. Other systems effectively do what is necessary to complete
the transaction but are not designed to keep track of what has changed. This
may mean that the data warehouse gets a copy of the entire customer ﬁle,
and the ETL system needs to ﬁgure out what has changed. Clearly, there is
a signiﬁcant difference in the amount of work required to sift through the
entire customer ﬁle versus getting details about only those customers who
have updated information.
The ETL developers need to coordinate their work with that of IT teams
who work with the source systems where data is to be extracted. These other
application development and support teams may be overwhelmed by their
own work. If so, the requests from the data warehouse team are just more
work added to an already overloaded schedule.
T I P
Include in the project plan tasks for the source system IT support teams. Get
estimated effort and lead time requirements from their manager to ensure that the
appropriate resources are available.
Transformation
The term transformation represents a wide variety of functions that are per-
formed to take the data as it is and get it ready for what you need to support
the business decision-making process. Some of these functions are direct and
straightforward, while others can be complex and challenging. There are two
distinctly different sets of work to be done by developers: one to build and
maintain the dimensions, and another to build and maintain the fact tables.
The dimensions provide the data needed to enable selection and grouping of
data in many different ways. Creating and maintaining the dimensions often

Chapter 10
■Implementation: Building the Database
319
involves using data from multiple source systems. There may be some sources
that are used purely to get descriptive data for the dimension. The functionality
is easier to understand in a speciﬁc context, so let’s look at common functions
needed to build and maintain a Customer dimension:
Validate the customer: Determine whether the incoming customer is
already known.
Identify changes to known customers: If the customer is known, have
there been any changes to that customer information? This may require
looking at data from several sources—perhaps the sales transactions, the
corporate marketing customer database, and the accounting systems.
Handle changes to known customers: For existing customers, make
sure that changes are handled appropriately. Sometimes data is updated
to reﬂect the current values. In other cases, historical versions of the
customer are needed. This concept, ﬁrst described in Chapter 7, is called
slowly changing dimensions. Many other data warehouse books provide
technical details about developing and maintaining slowly changing
dimensions. Needless to say, this simply means that there is more work
to be done and a little more complexity to be managed.
Identify new customers: If this is a new customer, then look at the sources
mentioned above to determine whether the customer is identiﬁed in those
systems. If this is a new customer, then a new data warehouse identiﬁer
is assigned. This is called assigning a surrogate key.
Build a full description for new customers: Once a new customer is
identiﬁed, data must be located to fully populate all of the customer
attributes. This may require looking at a variety of data sources. It also
requires guidelines that prioritize the sources. Perhaps the customer
master database from the marketing department should always be the
ﬁrst place to look for customer information. If the customer is not found
there, then use the name and address data from the source where the
customer was ﬁrst identiﬁed and then request demographic data from
a third-party data provider. The source must be selected for each data
element.
Validate data relationships: Follow the deﬁned business rules to ensure
that all of the data relationships are correct. For example, check the city,
state, and zip code values to ensure that they represent a valid combina-
tion. This may include standard relationships such as the geography, as
well as internal relationships such as customers living in Illinois belonging
to the Midwest sales region.
Map customer data from multiple sources: When data is being processed
from more than one source system, there must be a method to associate the

320
Part IV
■Building the Project
data from each source. Each source system may have different customer
identiﬁers, sometimes called the production identiﬁers (IDs) or codes. For
example, there must be a mapping indicating that the production ID for
the customer ‘‘ABC’’ in the sales system is the same customer identiﬁed
as ‘‘1003XJ’’ in the accounting system. Creating and maintaining this
map is a critical part of the overall transformation process that enables
integration of data from different sources/systems.
Identify and eliminate duplicate customers: It is common to ﬁnd the
same customer in each of the different data sources. However, it may be
the case that the same customer can be in data from the same data source.
For example, there may be data for a customer named Laura Reeves and
for a customer named L. L. Reeves. By looking at the last name, variations
of the ﬁrst name and initial, and other differentiating data such as date
of birth and home address, you can determine whether this is indeed the
same person. This processing is often called de-duplicating or de-duping
the data.
Restructure the data: The customer data must be reorganized to ﬁt into
the target database design.
Handle errors: Throughout the processing of the customer reference data,
rules are applied to accomplish the necessary function. If for some reason
there is a problem processing the data, then a determination must be
made about what to do next. Previous data proﬁling may have already
captured what should be done. Some errors are minor and may simply
require a default value being placed into the customer loyalty ﬁeld. In
other cases, the error may be severe enough that a customer cannot be
identiﬁed anywhere. The business may require that the customer (and
then any associated transactions) be placed in a ‘‘parking lot’’ for further
review and not loaded into the data warehouse at all. The number of
errors and how they are handled depends upon how the business needs
to see the data. Figure 10-1 shows a high-level view of the processing
required to build this simple example of a Customer dimension.
Similarly, there are common functions that are performed to process incom-
ing transaction data to produce the fact tables. These are explained in the
context of processing customer sales transactions. Common functions include
the following:
Isolate transactions of interest: Depending upon how the data is provided
from the source system, some processing may be required to isolate
the transactions that are needed to populate the sales fact table. The
sales system may process other transactions such as product returns or
inventory adjustments. If these are not needed to create the sales fact

Check the existence of dimension reference data for each sales trans-
action: This means that the critical descriptive data such as the product,
customer, and sales date are valid. Transactions can ﬂow through the
sales system with missing or invalid customer identiﬁers. There must be
a set of rules for how to handle each special case that is observed on the
transaction. It is also critical to ensure that there is a row in the dimension
table for each instance that is used for a transaction. This is known as
referential integrity.
Assign appropriate data warehouse identiﬁers: Once the critical ref-
erence data has been validated, the identiﬁers must be changed from
those used by the underlying source systems to those used in the data
warehouse environment, the surrogate keys.
Validate fact ﬁelds: Although the actual facts will be speciﬁc to each
transaction, there are often general guidelines that can be checked to
determine if the fact is accurate. For example, a sales transaction of zero
units may indicate that this is not an actual sale. A single sales transaction
for an amount that is greater than the average weekly sales for the entire
company is probably a data error.

Part IV
■Building the Project
Translate fact values for ease of use: The business measures needed for
reports may be different from how the data is stored in source systems.
It is helpful to convert data to a common unit of measure for reporting.
If a sales transaction records the sale of one case, this may be a case of
24 individual units or perhaps 36 individual units. Converting all of the
sales to the individual units ensures consistent and meaningful reporting.
Additionally, many facts work together. For example, the number of units
sold, price, and dollar amount sold are all useful facts. Only two of these
need to be stored physically; the third can be calculated on-the-ﬂy. To
make this as fast as possible, it is helpful to store the two facts that are
used most often.
Unravel source system logic: In many instances, the source system has
core data stored in a manner to help that system run fast and enable each
module to be relatively self-contained. This may mean that the pieces that
are needed to get a complete picture of a sales transaction may be stored
in several places or tables. To make things more challenging, there may
be no direct links between these tables, although there may be a series
of translation and lookup tables that are needed to get to the bottom of
things. This may be why the data is so hard for you to use in the source
system. The details are all there, but you need to understand the ‘‘secret
handshakes’’ in order to get to the real numbers. The ETL system can
apply this logic to provide the real sale numbers to be loaded into a fact
table. This is done once and then everyone can access these facts without
having to learn all of these details.
Perform complex calculations: Many calculations can be done when
creating a report or accessing data in an ad hoc manner. However, some
calculations may be too complex and long-running to perform on-the-ﬂy.
The ETL system can perform these calculations and store the results as
facts, which can then be directly accessed for reporting.
Figure 10-2 shows a general data ﬂow diagram to build the sales fact table
just described.
In addition to the functions described here, a great deal of work is also
required to address anomalies and challenges in the data. Often these chal-
lenges surface when the ETL system is being developed. No matter how
carefully the data is proﬁled in advance or how much detail is included in
the design, new and unexpected things will show up in the data. The goal
is to design the ETL system to be able to gracefully identify and address the
unexpected.
Load
After the extracted data has been processed, the ﬁnal step is to load the
data into a database. This may be loading directly into a star schema in a
presentation server or loading data into a third normal form data warehouse.

The Business Role in ETL
The participation of the business community is fairly obvious when gathering
business requirements. Business participation in the construction of the data
warehouse is less obvious but just as important. At this point in the project,
the business people who are needed are those with in-depth knowledge
about the current data and reporting methods. After looking at why these
business people are needed, this section highlights the areas in which business
involvement is necessary.
Why Does the Business Need to Help?
There will be a variety of skill and experience levels on the development team.
Without guidance from the business, you are expecting the project team to
make these critical decisions about the data. If there is limited access to the
business community, and pressure to deliver something, the project team is
likely to forge ahead without business input. Consider what really happens:
The technical team members decide what they think is better or worse, and
then one of the ETL developer makes the decisions. Do you really want the
business performance results to be reported from a database that was loaded with rules
deﬁned by the technical team’s best, and, it is hoped, educated, guess?
Such an approach rarely delivers results that the business really wants.
This often results in a subsequent project to redeﬁne, rebuild, and correct the
data to reﬂect what is really needed. Many organizations continue to apply
pressure and do not commit business resources, yet fund second, third, and
fourth efforts to get it right. Make the investment now so that there will not be

324
Part IV
■Building the Project
a need to redo the data warehouse repeatedly. In the following sections, you’ll
look at what needs to happen now, to get it right.
Deﬁning Business Rules
The overall design of the ETL system is clearly the responsibility of IT, so what
role does the business play in the design process? The business must deﬁne
and provide the rules about how to process the data. Fortunately, there are
dozens of data elements that do not require much work. These data elements
can be validated and then ﬂow directly into the data warehouse. However, it
is not always that straightforward. Some of the things where business input
may be needed include the following:
Helping to pick the data source: Suppose there are three different systems
that have the customer’s home address. Which one should be used?
Perhaps you should always use the accounting system ﬁrst, then look in
the sales database, and, only if it is not found there, go to the customer
feedback system. Candidate source systems will be researched by the
IT team members, and their ﬁndings can help with the decision-making
process.
Deﬁning processing rules: Representatives from the business community
need to work hand-in-hand with the design team to deﬁne the rules
for handling the data. What should happen when looking at a sales
transaction and the customer does not exist in the reference data? Should
the sales transaction be loaded with a default customer identiﬁer? Should
that sales transaction be set aside for further research before it is loaded?
The business community must provide the input so the appropriate logic
can be built into the ETL system.
Deﬁning integration rules: The business groups are often already using
the data that will be loaded into the data warehouse. Suppose reports are
being produced with data from multiple sources. How is this integration
being done currently? Perhaps it is being processed in an existing report-
ing system. Perhaps it is pulled together manually to create the reports.
The person who is doing this work has the most knowledge about the
details regarding the matching rules and how to handle exceptions. The
data warehouse team must work with the individuals who have this
in-depth knowledge to determine whether this same logic should be
applied in the ETL system. Sometimes there are no existing integration
rules to even start with. In that case, the IT and business representa-
tives need to work together to ensure that the data will be integrated
appropriately.

Chapter 10
■Implementation: Building the Database
325
USING EXISTING LOGIC VS. STARTING OVER
Over a number of years, very complex logic can be embedded into reporting
systems. Sometimes the logic is applied to load data into a database, but in
many cases the logic is applied when reports are created. This means that if the
logic changes, it needs to be changed everywhere. Unfortunately, over time,
there can be a divergence of this logic across different reports. In addition, this
logic can be a series of rules that are applied in layers. For example, the logic
may ﬁrst get the subset of new customers. Next, logic is determined using a
series of codes to identify the source of their business (agents, the web, or
other channels). Finally, a complex formula is applied to determine their sales
potential. This is a simple example to communicate the concept. In reality,
business logic can be extremely complex, with many layers.
The challenge for the data warehouse team is to determine where to get
these rules. Some organizations can have dozens of SAS programs with many
lines of code to apply the business logic, and the original author of the logic is
no longer with the company. The IT team members can reverse engineer the
programs and/or reports to derive the existing business rules. Then, the
business team members need to review those rules to determine whether they
are still appropriate. However, another option is to start over and develop rules
from scratch. This can be a better choice if the rules have been in place for a
long time, the business itself has changed signiﬁcantly, or the rules were not
clearly deﬁned and applied consistently in the current environment. Which
option to pursue should be a joint decision between IT and the business.
Deﬁning Expected Results—The Test Plan
A comprehensive test plan is needed to ensure that the data is correct. The
business must provide a set of test cases that can be used during development
and testing. This gives the baseline for comparison with the data warehouse.
For example, to validate earned premium, the business can provide a report
with actual earned premium by state by calendar month for the last six
months. This can be used to compare with the data pulled from the data
warehouse.
If there are major changes in the business rules, an existing report will
not sufﬁce for comparison. A subset of raw data may need to be pulled and
manipulated manually to provide the results for some test cases.
Some of the best people to help with the initial data validation are those
individuals who, if required to use the new database, would immediately look
for ﬂaws. They would compare reports from the data warehouse with reports
that they have been using themselves for years. This business participation
also helps others to have more conﬁdence in the data because people they
respect have helped validate it.

326
Part IV
■Building the Project
Some organizations have separate testing and quality assurance groups. This
requires that the test cases and instructions to run the system be provided.
The people performing these tests may have very little exposure to data
warehousing or the data you are loading. This requires that more care be given
to developing and documenting these test cases.
Development Support
Once the design work has been done, development can begin in earnest. This
does not mean that the business representatives are off the hook. Although a
great deal of thought goes into all the work leading to a complete ETL design,
there may still be things that require business input.
As the team begins to work with the actual data, performing good detailed
data analysis, there will be more surprises. These can be minimized with good
data analysis, ETL requirements, and ETL design work up front. Data that was
expected may not exist. Data that was not expected will show up. There will
be many exceptions. Often, with a little legwork, the technical team can ﬁgure
out what happened and adapt the development appropriately.
There will also be plenty of times when the business needs to be consulting
about what to do next. How should it handle invoices for customers that do
not exist in the customer master ﬁle? Although this should not happen, strange
things are often found in the real data. Adjustments may need to be made to
the underlying source system, but the ETL system must know what to do if
this ever happens again. Should the invoice be loaded with an ‘‘unknown’’
customer? Should the invoice be held for further research? The development
team can do either, but the business needs to deﬁne what they are expecting
to see.
The business team members will have fewer daily tasks assigned to them,
but they will be ‘‘on call.’’ When a problem is found or questions arise about
how to understand a business rule that was deﬁned during the design process,
the team needs to be able to get answers quickly. They do not want to wait for
permission to ask a question that may take ﬁve minutes to answer.
Testing the ETL System—Is the Data Right?
Initial testing of the ETL system will be performed by the technical team
members. This ensures that the programs and processes run without errors
and that they correctly perform their designed function. This often includes
basic checking to ensure that the data ﬂows properly. The team will make sure
that if 100,000 transactions came in, then 100,000 transactions were processed.
Other checks may include conﬁrming that the total units shipped on the
incoming transactions matches the total units shipped from the resulting fact

Chapter 10
■Implementation: Building the Database
327
table. The basic testing may also ensure that each customer is assigned a credit
proﬁle and that each product has a package type.
Testing that the programs and processes run correctly is only part of the
overall testing and quality checks that must be done. Additional work is
needed to ensure that the data itself is accurate. The ETL system may have
correctly processed those 100,000 transactions, but if all of the sales were off by
a decimal point, then the tests previously mentioned would not detect it. The
business must be an integral part of the testing and quality assurance process
to ensure that the database is correct.
A great deal of work is required to validate the database when it is ﬁrst
loaded. There will also be ongoing work to ensure that each time the ETL
system runs, accurate data is loaded. Who decides if the data is right? The
comprehensive test plan developed earlier by the business provides the basis to
assess the data. Representatives from the business community may be involved
in running the test cases, but their involvement is critical in evaluating the
results. This needs to be someone who has the knowledge to recognize that an
increase in market share of 14% is not possible, as changes in market share are
usually measured in tenths of a percent.
T I P
The ETL system should include many validation steps to check for data
problems before the data is loaded. Leverage your data access or business
intelligence tool to help with data validation. These tools are designed to identify
exceptions, compare results with previous periods, and compare results to
thresholds. Develop a set of queries or reports that can be run after the data has
been loaded as a ﬁnal data quality check.
Why Does It Take So Long and Cost So Much?
If all of the systems in the organization contained clean, reliable data with
consistent production identiﬁers, then developing a robust ETL system would
not take so long. However, it is rare to ﬁnd an organization that has such clean,
integrated systems already in place. Therefore, with the reality that the source
systems were designed without the requirement to integrate easily with one
another, the data warehouse must overcome these problems.
A variety of factors contribute to the time it takes to build the ETL system.
Several of the biggest contributors include the following:
Long decision cycle: Many choices need to be made throughout the
design and development of the ETL system. Often, decisions can be
made based upon the requirements, or a single person or area needs
to be consulted ﬁrst. However, in many instances the decision impacts
multiple areas. It can take a long time to get the appropriate people

328
Part IV
■Building the Project
together to understand the choice, come to an agreement, and commit to
the direction.
New perspectives on the data: As part of building the data warehouse,
the data may be looked at in ways that have never been attempted before.
As the business and the marketplace evolve, new requirements also
emerge. These may result in identiﬁcation of anomalies and challenges
in the underlying source systems. As new perspectives are deﬁned, the
data may not yield meaningful or helpful results. For example, it may
take several iterations to deﬁne the business rule to identify long-term
customers. How many years are needed to consider someone a long-term
customer? What if the customer leaves and then comes back again—do
you count all of the years or just consecutive years?
Lack of business input: There are also many demands on the business
community. Business analysts who work with the data today are often
swamped with demands for data, reports, and analyses. In addition
to a full load of regular reporting, there are often ad hoc requests
that need attention. However, these analysts have the most knowledge
about how data is manipulated and which calculations are currently
used. Sometimes, the team must go through a series of meetings before
identifying the person who can really help.
A lot of hard work: Often, developing the ETL system takes a lot of time
and money simply because there is a lot of work that must be done. This
can be due to the complexity and volume of data or because of a lack of
well-structured and reliable data to begin with. Obviously, if the team is
pulling data from two data sources, the integration work is much smaller
than integrating data from ten different systems.
Insufﬁcient data proﬁling: Whether the organization is using a sophisti-
cated data proﬁling tool or performing detailed data analysis by running
queries against the database, it is important to understand what data
is being stored. When the actual data contents have not been studied,
problems will arise during ETL development. The types of data problems
that emerge include ﬁnding that the data element is empty or that the
contents of a data element are not what was expected. Thorough study of
the data prior to designing and building the ETL system should obviate
these issues.
Indirect communication: Looking at the day-to-day work, questions
often arise for which the team needs input from another IT resource
or someone from the business community. If the project team must go
through a liaison to gain access to other IT or business people, this can
greatly lengthen the project schedule. While it may not seem like a big

Chapter 10
■Implementation: Building the Database
329
deal to wait a couple of days to meet with a key IT or business person, over
the life of the project this can add weeks to the schedule—just waiting
to have the opportunity to ask a question. Moreover, if the question
cannot be answered by that individual, then the process begins again to
gain access to the next person in the chain. It is much better to create
an environment where the data warehouse team is provided an open
door directly to anyone (within reason!). This requires that both business
and IT management communicate the importance of the data warehouse
project to everyone else. It also means that the data warehouse team must
act responsibly and respect everyone’s time.
Experience level of the team: There is a lot to learn when working on a
data warehouse project, especially for the ﬁrst time. It takes some time to
learn data warehousing concepts and principles. It also takes some time
to learn and become efﬁcient with using any new technology.
Lack of access to the right IT people: Usually, several key people
have knowledge of how a system works. These IT people are in high
demand, and the data warehouse team may have trouble scheduling
time with them. These individuals often play a critical role in keeping
the operational system running and may be involved in other systems
development projects.
Each of these items can increase the amount of time needed to design and
build the ETL system. This is also the part of the project where you are likely
to have the largest number of resources all working on the project. A small
core group can gather requirements and develop the data model, but now
many more people can work at the same time to build the ETL system. Small
organizations may still have a small core team (likely the same core team),
whereas large enterprises may have a dozen or more people working on this.
All this work translates into dollars, for internal business and IT staff and
third-party consultants.
T I P
Use what you know about the organization to anticipate common project
impediments. Try to build time into the project schedule to deal with these. For
example, if the team is inexperienced, then include time and resources for
education and mentoring.
Balancing Requirements and Data Reality
Organizations often have great ideas about what they want to do and how they
would like to use data to help them. However, the data warehouse is limited by
the data that the organization actually has. The business requirements can be

330
Part IV
■Building the Project
identiﬁed using the techniques discussed in Chapter 6. Many of the shortfalls
of the current data are found during data proﬁling and/or detailed data
analysis performed while data modeling. If the data is not captured anywhere,
then it cannot be included in the database. Additional data challenges are
discovered during the development of the ETL system.
It takes a lot of detailed, tedious work to track down and resolve all of these
individual data issues. It is important to ensure that issues are well understood
so that decisions can be made about how to deal with problems that arise. In
some cases, getting to the bottom of the problem itself may take a lot more
research. A decision must be made whether to work on the problem or to
postpone it for the future. This must be a joint business and technical decision.
Some problems can be put off with little or no immediate impact, but some
data issues must be resolved in order to meet the overall objectives of the
project.
For example, suppose the organization has been collecting customer demo-
graphic data for years. When customers call in, they are asked if they are
willing to complete a short survey. This short survey collects additional demo-
graphics about each customer household. While it sounds interesting to use
for analysis, most customers did not participate, so only 15% of the customers
have any data. To make matters worse, the entry screens required the answers
to be keyed in, rather than using a set list of options, so the data that has been
collected has many different values and will require a lot of cleaning to make
it useful. The question at hand is whether this is worth the effort.
Because the demographic analysis is not an immediate priority, and the
work required is signiﬁcant, this was postponed to a subsequent iteration.
In the meantime, a better data solution is to modify the survey entry screen
to capture pre-set options so that the data is consistent. In addition, the top
ﬁve most important questions need to be included in the initial conversation
with the customer, rather than as an optional survey. These decisions need
to be based on a cost-beneﬁt analysis—not a multi-week effort, but simply a
checkpoint to ensure that resources are used wisely to deliver the most value
in a timely manner.
Often, the data problems identiﬁed when working on a data warehouse
project are data quality problems in the underlying source systems and/or
business processes. It is important to dig down to ﬁnd out the root cause of
data quality problems. Then, decisions can be made to eliminate the problems
from recurring.
Discovering the Flaws in Your Current Systems
As a by-product of the detailed work that is done to extract and then transform
the data, many anomalies and unusual data handling and storage techniques
are uncovered. Sometimes fundamental ﬂaws are identiﬁed regarding how

Chapter 10
■Implementation: Building the Database
331
the source application system works. If these ﬂaws impact how business is
conducted, they must be addressed immediately. For example, if the formula
used to calculate sales tax is not correct, this must be addressed. This would
need to be corrected in the system, and follow-up research is also required to
determine other ramiﬁcations. If the tax was too high, does that indicate that
a refund must be paid to customers? If the tax amount was too low, what are
the implications with the IRS? Addressing problems like this is difﬁcult and
highly charged with emotion. This may slow the project while the situation is
being addressed. While this is usually unpleasant, it is imperative to discover
and correct serious ﬂaws.
More often, less serious problems are found while building the ETL sys-
tem. The application system functions properly and business is successfully
completed, but this type of problem is after the fact, in how data is reported
and tracked. Many organizations have copies of production data that are used
to support reporting. While these meet some basic needs, it is not enough
because you are building a data warehouse environment.
Over the years, a lot of logic has been embedded into these reporting
environments (databases, ﬁles, spreadsheets and/or report programs). Often
the logic has not been well documented and the authors may no longer
work in the group or for the organization. There is often sophisticated and
complex logic applied in two primary ways. The ﬁrst type of logic performs
calculations. This is the most obvious and easy to understand. Calculations
are used to determine commissioned sales, ﬁnancial contribution, and gross
margin. The second type of logic has just as much impact on the results as
the speciﬁc formula that is used. It is this second type of logic that has been
included and/or excluded from participating in the calculation. For example,
all sales to non-proﬁt organizations are not eligible for sales commission.
This means that while the formula is the sum of sales dollars, the sales to
customers designated as non-proﬁt are excluded from the summation. The
logic regarding what is included and excluded from reports and business
measurements is much more difﬁcult to track down, but just as important.
Over the years, the business itself may have changed, but all of the underlying
logic in the many different reports may not reﬂect the current view.
Applying New Business Rules
As the data warehouse is built, the data will be cleaned and transformed using
the currently deﬁned rules. This often means that the data warehouse results
will not match reports from the older systems. Clearly, the processes and
results must be validated to ensure that the new rules have been implemented
correctly. However, because the new and old systems are applying different
rules, the results will not match.

332
Part IV
■Building the Project
This is often difﬁcult for people to understand, and it creates concern
because the reports that have been relied upon for years have been exposed
as no longer accurate. In most cases, the reports were accurate and served
the purpose as deﬁned when they were developed. It is time to move on to
how the business is being tracked and measured today. For most people, it is
hard to give up the current way of doing things. It is comfortable; and while
not optimal, it is well understood. The changes to business rules should be
driven from business requirements and decisions made during design and
development of the ETL system. It is helpful to have the business people
who were involved in making these decisions communicate what has changed
and the rationale behind the changes. Moving forward requires learning and
changing—two things that many of us don’t enjoy.
T I P
Don’t focus on why the old system was wrong, but emphasize how much
better it is to use new measurements, formulas, and ways of looking at the business.
This new perspective has evolved as a result of what was learned in the past.
You are leveraging what was done in the past to make things better for the future.
Working Toward Long-Term Solutions
Depending upon what you ﬁnd, some issues may simply be too big to address
at this time. If a problem originates in a major application system, the solution
is likely to be much bigger than the data warehouse. Often the team that is
responsible for the application system heartily agrees that there is a problem
and they often agree that the problem must be addressed. However, their
priorities may differ from those of the data warehouse team. The effort to
address the underlying problem may be slated with the next maintenance
release, which is scheduled to start 24 months out. The data warehouse may
not be able to wait that long. Therefore, many techniques are employed and
a lot of work is done by the ETL system to overcome these problems with
underlying systems. Over the years, real change is so infrequent that too
often data warehouse teams don’t even think to ask for modiﬁcations and
enhancements to the underlying source systems.
Don’t live with the status quo. Regardless of how clever the data warehouse
team is, it will be better for the long term to have clean data captured as
close as possible to the business interaction or transaction itself. The following
guidelines should help:
What is the real source of this data problem and where should it be ﬁxed?
Encourage the data warehouse team to look for long-term solutions,
rather than short-term patches.
Follow up to ensure that modiﬁcations and enhancements are actually
made to the source application systems.

Chapter 10
■Implementation: Building the Database
333
In order for your organization to begin to shift in that direction, there
must be a commitment and understanding with the management team, both
business and IT, that this will be an investment, a change in how things are
done, but it will result in long-term beneﬁts. These beneﬁts include saving the
cost to ﬁx data problems later, and improved data quality that results when
data is captured closest to where the real details of that business interaction
are known.
Manually Including Business Data
There are instances where critical business data is not currently being captured
in a formal operational system. This may be data that is needed to complete
the required reports and analyses. Often this data is stored in spreadsheets
on someone’s hard drive or on a network shared drive. It is not acceptable to
have anyone manually enter data into the data warehouse.
The ﬁrst thing to do is explore the need for a small operational system to
support the business function that captures this data. If the need is identiﬁed,
a separate project should be initiated to address that need. Sometimes, the
only need is to provide a place to collect this data in an organized, systematic
manner. A small subsystem can be developed to provide a user interface that
enables the data to be entered into a staging data table, rather than having the
data entered on a spreadsheet. This staging data can be used as input to the
ETL system. This adds more checks and balances to the data entry process and
ensures that the data is integrated in a consistent and approved manner with
the rest of the data in the data warehouse.
Tracking Progress—Are We There Yet?
The design and development of the ETL system is very involved and can take
quite a bit of time. It does not help to have only three tasks on a project plan:
design, develop, and test. While these are the big tasks, it can be difﬁcult to
track real progress at such a high level. This may be all that is needed to
share progress with upper management, but at a working level, more detail
is needed to appreciate the work that has already been done and to see how
much is left to do.
The tasks can be broken down to list each dimension and fact table, or even
further if necessary to achieve small enough units of work to be done. As
the detailed design, development, and testing is completed for each, it can be
tracked, allowing a more accurate assessment of what percentage of the work
has been completed. It is helpful to know that the ETL system is 60% complete;
it is more interesting to know that eight of the ten dimension tables have been
developed and one of the ﬁve fact tables is done.

334
Part IV
■Building the Project
Progress can even be measured in the number of known data problems.
Then you can see progress as these are resolved. Without this, you don’t even
know how many known issues still need to be dealt with. Are there 25 or 125?
Encourage the team to keep a log of all open questions. This can be used to
track what still needs to be addressed. Assign a tracking number, a general
category (perhaps the name of the dimension or data source to which the
question relates), include a description of the problem or question, the date it
was identiﬁed, the person responsible for ﬁnding the answer, and the status
(opened, closed, deferred).
Over time, include notes about what has been learned and any decisions
that have been made. This also serves as an audit trail showing how data
issues have been resolved. This type of a log can easily have more than 100
items. The items can be prioritized to help the project team focus on the most
important issues ﬁrst.
At some point you are likely to get down to a dozen issues that remain
open. You need to assess which of these must be addressed. From a systems
perspective, can you move forward without having an answer? From a
business perspective, is this issue critical? What happens if you can’t ﬁnd a
resolution? If there is little or no impact (on systems or business), then this
may be postponed to a future iteration.
What Else Can You Do to Help?
While the ETL developers are working diligently, the rest of the team can feel
helpless. However, there are several concrete steps during the development of
the ETL system that you can take to contribute to the project’s success.
Encouragement and Support
Project teams are usually very aware of the time pressure to deliver results.
They put in a lot of effort, often giving some of their own time to keep things
moving forward. With so much work to be done, it can feel like a thankless job
to the ETL developer. At times, more problems are identiﬁed than are being
resolved. After a while, it can seem like the work will never end. It may still
be weeks before the ETL system is complete.
Too often, the ETL developers only hear complaints and other negative
feedback. Every time they need something, it feels like they are interrupting
other more important work. The only time you hear from them is when
they have found another problem. This is when mangers and members of the
business community need to step forward with a few words of encouragement.
This can be a simple e-mail to thank them for their efforts. Even better, stop

Chapter 10
■Implementation: Building the Database
335
by in person to thank them. If it has been a particularly bad week, bring in
bagels, donuts, or even homemade cookies. You don’t need to spend a lot
of money, but a simple acknowledgment can give the team a sorely needed
boost.
This type of support is often viewed as ‘‘management’s job.’’ However, it
can also be given to the team by anyone in the business community. Remind
the project team why this matters to you and how it will help you with your
work every day.
T I P
Business representatives can help the project team by keeping a positive
attitude, even when other demands are looming. When asked, set aside time to
answer questions and focus on what the data warehouse project needs.
Ensuring Continued Business Participation
The construction of the database often takes longer than any other part of
the project. For smaller projects this may still be weeks, but for many large
initiatives, this can take months. Database construction is not as glamorous
and exciting as brainstorming requirements and developing a data model.
This is detailed, technical work. Many business team members, as well as the
business community in general, can lose interest in the data warehouse.
Once the design work is done, the time demands on business partners
decreases. Other daily work easily ﬁlls in and begins to take precedence
over the remaining data warehouse work. While there is not a need for the
business team members to develop programs and technical processes, their
continued input is still highly valuable. Business input is needed to answer
questions, clarify data requirements, make decisions about business rules for
processing, and assist with testing and validating the data. It can be difﬁcult to
estimate when this participation will be needed for the next several months.
The project team may have a better sense of what to expect in the next couple
of weeks. While the participation is not constant, it is still important to ensure
a successful data warehouse. Remember that any delays in helping the project
team will add up and delay completion of the entire data warehouse.
COPING WITH UNCERTAINTY
The one thing that is guaranteed on a data warehouse project is uncertainty.
There is the uncertainty that results from the very nature of trying to keep up
with the pace of business and the changing marketplace. There is the
uncertainty that results from scrutinizing the organization’s data in ways that
have never been done before. The most important step toward dealing with
(continued)

336
Part IV
■Building the Project
COPING WITH UNCERTAINTY (continued)
this much uncertainty is openly acknowledging that it exists. There are also
several things that everyone can do to help:
■Be patient with each other as the project evolves.
■Remain ﬂexible—Realize that it may be best to get started with some
work before you have every ‘‘t’’ crossed and every ‘‘i’’ dotted. Even if
you achieved that level of detail, many things will change as soon as
you move forward anyway. This does not give the project team carte
blanche to run at full speed without any planning; it simply means that
you must ﬁnd a happy medium: Do enough planning and design to ensure
that you have a strong direction, yet be willing to adapt as you go.
■Communicate openly and frequently—This is the key to ensuring that
progress is being made toward the ultimate goal: a sustainable data ware-
house that helps the business realize concrete value for the organization.
■Apply sound project management—Continue to utilize stan-
dard project management techniques to run the project. This
includes maintaining the project plan, watching for scope creep,
administering change control as needed, continuing to conduct
periodic status meetings, and publishing status reports.
Proactive Communication
Project communication should be driven from the project team out. The project
manager is the spokesperson to share progress, concerns, and changes in time-
line, deliverables, or costs. This is often through the standard project ofﬁce or
project management channels of the organization. Usually, weekly updates
are submitted and included with all of the other initiatives across the organiza-
tion. A one-page snapshot with a few bulleted points and a green/yellow/red
indicator is not sufﬁcient communication between the project team and the key
stakeholders of the data warehouse.
During the early requirements gathering and data modeling phases of a
project, there is natural and frequent interaction between the project team
and the business community. Now that the team is focused on ETL system
development, the nature of the communication must change. There will
be many weeks when there are no major issues that need attention and
development work continues. For very large projects, this may go on for
several months. It seems that there is nothing speciﬁc to say, other than ‘‘we
are still working.’’
While regular status reports are published, there is often a drop-off in other
communications. There are often no executive brieﬁngs, and no meetings with
business sponsors and drivers. While these should continue, experience shows

Chapter 10
■Implementation: Building the Database
337
that when there is no major deliverable or milestone accomplishment to report,
project teams are quiet. If you don’t hear from the project team, be proactive.
Request a meeting or ask for an update.
Another reason to stay in close communication is that business and IT
management can help remove many roadblocks for the team. Too often,
project teams feel that they should be able to solve everything themselves. For
example, one project team was running preliminary tests for one part of the ETL
system. Every night, the server crashed and their processes never completed.
With some investigation, the team discovered that the machine they were
assigned for development and early testing was also being used by three other
projects. The machine was overburdened, and did not have the resources to
support all of these projects. From the ETL developer’s perspective, they set
up a schedule to take turns checking on the server throughout the night.
Over time, this decreased the productivity of the team (because they were all
tired) and the testing took much longer than expected. With a broader perspec-
tive, other servers were available and could have been allocated to the data
warehouse team. When you are too close to the problem, sometimes you don’t
see alternative solutions. Regular communication between the project team,
business, and IT management can help identify these opportunities. Therefore,
if you don’t hear from the team, then seek them out to see how they are doing.
In Real Life
Let’s check in with the two companies we have been tracking now that they
have moved into design and development of their ETL systems.
Building the Data Warehouse at Giant, Co.
Job functions and roles are highly specialized at Giant Co. Everyone does
their part and rarely looks beyond their immediate task. The organization
has one group of people assigned to develop the technical and functional
speciﬁcations for building the ETL system, but there was some trouble getting
access to the right business people to develop the speciﬁcations. Therefore,
the team just made the best decisions they could to complete the specs on
time. After, with iterative development, there will be more work in the future.
The developers are highly skilled and march forward to build what has been
designed. However, as work progresses, many things crop up with the real
data. The speciﬁcations do not include any instructions about how to handle
these issues, and it takes too long for questions to be answered. The developers
do what they can, but often data is excluded because there is no direction for
handling it. This keeps the schedule on track, but as more and more data is left
out, overall value begins to diminish. The entire project is still taking longer
than expected.

338
Part IV
■Building the Project
A great deal of animosity also grew between the design and development
teams. Changes continue to be made to the speciﬁcations to address discrep-
ancies in the data. The developers feel that if the design team had done a better
job this would not have happened. Likewise, the ETL designers feel that if the
data modelers and analysts who gathered the requirements had done their
jobs better, then there would not be so many changes.
With the situation deteriorating, the project manager called a time-out. The
project team met to review the status and what would need to happen to get
the project back on track. The project manager then met with the business and
IT sponsors to share these ﬁndings. Although it was hard, it was decided to
take a step back and develop a new plan of attack. These activities included
the following:
Compiling an inventory of what parts of the ETL system were working
and what were not
Comparing the project scope with the data currently being worked on,
studying what needs to be added back in to meet the business objectives
Documenting known data problems
Revising the project plan, including cost and time estimates to complete
the rest of the project
Gaining approval for the revised project plan
Developing speciﬁcations for remaining ETL work
Assigning appropriate business people to assist with the speciﬁcation
and support the rest of the process
Conducting team-building sessions to defuse the situation
While it was not easy to decide to revisit the requirements for the ETL
system, it enabled the team to get back on track, with management support.
Much of the work could be used. The experience and lessons learned were
also documented while the issues were still fresh.
Agile, Inc., Builds a Data Warehouse Quickly
There is a great deal of pressure to move quickly at Agile, Inc., to get the data
warehouse up and running. The longer it takes before data starts moving,
the more anxious the business gets. With the business requirements gathered
and the database designed, the team gives in to the pressure to start building
the database, with minimal time spent writing any speciﬁcations for the ETL
system. The general consensus is that the team knows where the data is today
and what it should look like, so it’s time to get started. Everyone is empowered
to make decisions and get their work done.

Chapter 10
■Implementation: Building the Database
339
Sometimes business input is solicited to address data questions. This is
not well received because everyone is so busy pulling data and producing
reports for the upcoming quarterly management meetings. Therefore, the ETL
developers just forge ahead and don’t bother the business with questions.
After a short development time, data is loaded and deemed ready for use.
However, now that the business begins to look at the data, serious problems
are identiﬁed. It turns out that many of the assumptions used to process the
data were not valid. While the team met the short timeframe, the data is not
usable.
After a great deal of ﬁnger pointing, a team is put together to conduct a
review. The purpose is to determine whether it would be better to clean it up
or start over. Because very little was documented and there was no cohesive
system design for the ETL processes, it is determined to simply start over. This
does not mean starting from scratch—the project team learned a lot about the
data and about ETL development. Before diving in to build more processes, a
joint business and IT data governance team is formed to study the data and
develop standard deﬁnitions and guidelines regarding how data elements are
to be handled. With this joint team to help answer data questions, the new
project includes time to develop complete speciﬁcations. The project is going
much better and the preliminary results are good. The data will be trustworthy
and help meet the business requirements.
Summary
The ETL system is at the heart and soul of the data warehouse and must be
driven by detailed requirements for the data. Taking the time to understand
and document these requirements helps to design and develop a robust pro-
duction system. A lot of work is done by the ETL system to extract, transform,
and load the database. This chapter introduced the basic functionality of these
steps.
While much of this work is technical in nature, the business perspective
must still be represented. Business representatives must be involved in deﬁning
business rules for handling the data and a test plan and detailed test cases.
Once development begins, the business must continue to support the ETL
developers by answering questions about the data promptly and enabling
cross-functional group decisions when necessary.
The business needs to continue to provide input and guidance to the tech-
nical team members to ensure that the data is prepared properly. Continued
partnership between business and IT can help each data warehouse project to
successfully load high-quality data. With the data loaded, it is time to take a
closer look at how it can be used. The next chapter focuses on delivering data
into the hands of the business community.

Data Delivery: What you
Finally See
Data delivery is one of the most exciting parts of the entire DW project.
You ﬁnally get to see the results of all the hard work. All of the input that
went into gathering requirements and developing the data model fed into the
construction of the database ﬁnally comes together. As soon as some sample
data is loaded, the team can start building reports and screens where you can
see the data. Excitement begins to build because the ﬁnished product is within
sight. In many cases, this is what was ‘‘sold’’ as the data warehouse project
result. Delivery of the data can take many different forms depending upon the
job function and the need for data to support that work. In this chapter you
will learn about the following:
Business intelligence (BI)—what is it?
The basic building blocks of a BI application
Understanding different levels of use
Building a BI application
Planning for a successful launch
This chapter provides an introduction to these concepts but it is not intended
to be a complete reference guide for BI. To get started, let’s take a look at what
BI is and how it can work.
What Is Business Intelligence?
Business intelligence is a broad all-encompassing term that is used to describe
a wide variety of different types of data access. Business intelligence is the collec-
tion of one or more reports or analyses that provide insight into performance
of a business organization. These reports and analyses are typically interactive
to enable further understanding of speciﬁc areas of interest. These are used to
support business professionals in their decision-making processes.
341

342
Part IV
■Building the Project
Over the years there have been many different labels used for this func-
tion, including analytical reporting, decision support, and now business
intelligence. The term business intelligence has even been broadened to
encompass processes, technologies, techniques, and tools that support action-
able decision-making. Some also include the data warehouse itself within
the scope of BI. For the purposes of this text, the term BI is used to refer to the
actual use of the data warehouse to support decision making. The rest of this
chapter explores this perspective in more depth. What does this mean to you?
Simply that you need to clarify the use of the term BI within your organization
to ensure effective communication and productive discussions.
WHAT IS A QUERY?
The mechanism to get data out of a database is called a query. A query is
comprised of several parts. First, what to include in the returned results is
listed, such as customer name, product code, and number of units purchased.
Second, a query must specify which database tables contain the information
needed, such as the customer sales table. The query also includes a list of
constraints that limit the results that are returned. For example, a query can be
constrained to return only customers who live in Chicago, and only include pet
food products, for sales in the last four weeks. A query can also include
calculations (sales units * price) and deﬁne how the results should be grouped
or sorted. For example, the sales results could be grouped by customer gender
and brand of the product.
The most common query language is SQL (structured query language), which
is used to access many relational databases. Thankfully, there are many tools
that provide user-friendly interfaces to help set up queries and generate the
actual code that is sent to the database. These tools also provide a wide variety
of presentation options, making the results much easier to understand and
interpret. Queries are how the data is accessed in the data warehouse.
Business Intelligence without a DW
Some organizations have developed business intelligence solutions that are
completely independent of the data warehouse environment. This can limit
the long-term value of the business intelligence solution. These point solutions
are usually focused on a single area of the business with a limited set of data
geared toward supporting a speciﬁc set of reports. The data is often structured
speciﬁcally to produce these reports. It can be difﬁcult and costly to add more
data and expand this type of application over time, as needs change.
The best business intelligence solutions are those that are built on top of a
sound data warehouse foundation. This foundation enables the environment
to ﬂexibly grow and change over time. New data can be gracefully added to

Chapter 11
■Data Delivery: What you Finally See
343
the database and more analyses developed. The database is designed with the
intention of supporting ﬂexible reporting in ways not yet deﬁned and with the
expectation that more data will be added over time.
BI in Action
There are many different ways to deliver data from the data warehouse to the
business users. Often this data access is provided by a business intelligence
tool. This section walks through a progression of data delivery that shows the
types of things you can expect from a business intelligence tool.
Tabular Reports
Static tabular reports are used to pull a subset of data from the data warehouse
in a tabular format. These often provide a snapshot of business performance
or a trend of business results over time. Figure 11-1 shows an example of a
static tabular report. This report shows monthly sales for the third quarter, by
vendor.

Parameter-Driven Reports
Rather than build dozens of static tabular reports, several report templates can
be created that are driven by user-deﬁned parameters. The user is prompted
to provide the input parameters when the report is requested. For example, a
user who wants the report from Figure 11-1 could be prompted to select which
quarter and vendor to include on the report.
While some tabular reports are static and unchangeable, more often the
reports are parameter driven, so a business user could be prompted to select
the appropriate time frame and sales region for the report.

344
Part IV
■Building the Project
Interactive Reports—Drilling Down and Across
Reports are even more useful when they are interactive, enabling the user
to drill down into more detail. Using drill-down capabilities, you can, for
example, start with a regional report and then get more detail about each
of the districts that make up the Midwest region. Interactive reports are
the backbone of business intelligence solutions and provide straightforward
presentation of selected data. Likewise, it is possible to roll data up to a higher
level of detail.
Some tools also provide additional manipulation of the results by swap-
ping the row and column headers. For example, you may be able to swap
out the vendor for the product category. You may also be able to change
which business measures are displayed on the report. Using these drilling and
manipulation capabilities, it is possible to completely morph a report without
having to go into a full development mode.
Exception Reports
Exception reports are similar to tabular reports in their format but have the
added capability to return results that meet speciﬁc criteria. For example, you
can run an exception report if you want to list all sales representatives who are
within 8% of meeting their sales quota for the month. The exception criterion
in this example is the threshold of 8%. Users can be prompted for exception
criteria. Exception reports can return only the results that meet the criteria, or
exception conditions can be identiﬁed in the report itself. This is often done
by using different colored text, shading the cell, or displaying a colored shape
such as a circle or triangle. For example, perhaps all products whose sales are
lower than last year’s sales are shown in red. Figure 11-2 shows a sample of
an exception report that includes only the vendors whose sales are less than
zero percent of the previous month’s sales. Note that cells whose sales are less
than or equal to negative 10% of the previous month’s sales are shaded for
additional emphasis.

AD HOC REPORTS
The term ad hoc report has different meanings depending upon who you ask.
Typically, those with technical backgrounds tend to think that ad hoc means
you start with a blank slate and build a report from scratch and then run it to
get your results. When most business people ask for ad hoc reporting, they
really want parameter-driven reports. Be sure to clarify what is really needed
when someone asks for ad hoc reporting.
Other BI Capabilities
Beyond creating reports, additional functions are included as part of BI. Some
of the capabilities that fall under the BI umbrella include the following:
Comparisons (actual sales vs. forecasted sales)
Ranking (top/bottom n, top/bottom n%)
Totals and subtotals
Time series comparisons (this week vs. same week one year ago)
Ratios and penetration (market share-product sales as a percentage of the
total category sales for this market)
Exception processing to highlight conditions or limit the results included
on the report. Exception processing includes the following:
Top n, bottom n (by % too)
Thresholds
% contribution of what is included in the report
% contribution to the whole data set, not limited to what is included
on the report
These are used to help glean insight from the data.
Complex Analysis
Complex analysis can also be produced with a business intelligence application.
This is where more sophisticated business logic, statistical analysis, or data
mining is performed on the data to produce the ﬁnal results. For example, the
seasonally adjusted sales may be presented with baseline sales differentiated
from promoted sales.
This is not an exhaustive list of BI capabilities but a quick overview. Many
more variations are possible to produce results. This is intended to give you
a basic idea of the range of things that are possible. In addition, note that not

346
Part IV
■Building the Project
everyone uses the terms discussed here in exactly the same way. Sometimes
the BI labels are used because they align with the name of the software module
used to create the reports. Sometimes the terms are rooted in how your
organization has historically delivered data. It really does not matter whose
terms are used, but it is important for everyone on the project team and, it is
hoped, across the organization to use these terms in a consistent manner.
BI Building Blocks
When you use a BI solution you tap into several different layers. These different
layers are created to enable ﬂexibility and the sharing of components across
many reports and applications. When using a BI solution, you generally are not
aware of these layers or how they work together. It is useful to discuss them
here because it will help the entire team to have more meaningful discussions
when reﬁning requirements and developing the applications for the DW.
Data Content—Understanding What You Have
The foundation of any BI solution is the data itself. All of the data must have
useful business names and descriptions, rather than technical names used by
the database. There are two parts of deﬁning the data content.
First, the data itself must be set up so that it can be used to create and navigate
through the BI reports and other display mechanisms. This is where the
Business Dimensional Model described in Chapter 7 is used again. Each of the
business attributes for each business dimension must be deﬁned to the BI tool.
This entails linking the business data element to the physical data element in
the database. Additionally, the BI tool needs any relationships between each
of the attributes to be deﬁned. This is how the BI tool ‘‘knows’’ what to drill
down to when asked. The labels that are set up here are what show up on
reports and as labels for setting parameters. This is setting up the BI tool to
present what is deﬁned in the Business Dimensional Model as discussed in
Chapter 7.
Second, the actual business measures that appear as the body of the
reports must be deﬁned. This work will use the Business Measures Work-
sheet described in Chapter 7. Think of this as setting up a library of all of the
business measures that will be used. These may be basic facts, key performance
indicators, or other business metrics. Each should have a descriptive name
and a business description, and each should deﬁne the default handling of
this measure for rolling the results up. This is also called the default aggregation
rule. For sales units, for example, the default is usually to perform a sum. For
an average price measure, the default aggregation rule should be to sum the
dollar sales divided by the sum of the units sold, rather than the average of
the average price itself.

Chapter 11
■Data Delivery: What you Finally See
347
The Business Dimensional Model and the business measures worksheet
should utilize and align with any work that is done for master data manage-
ment, as described in Chapter 8. This work is done by the BI developers and
provides the basics needed to be able to create and run reports using a BI tool.
This is also called conﬁguring the BI tool or deﬁning the BI tool metadata.
N O T E Developing the Business Measures Worksheet should begin during the
dimensional modeling process. This helps to ensure that all of the underlying facts
required to support these business measures are identiﬁed for inclusion in the
model. This also allows time for the formulas to be approved, as it can take a long
time to gain consensus across business groups for some of these business
measures.
Navigation—Finding What You Need
There is a wide range of possibilities for getting started using a data warehouse.
The navigation layer provides the interface that enables the business users to
locate and then use the data they are looking for. BI navigation may involve
going to a shared network drive, ﬁnding the BI Reports folder, and then
looking at the different reports that you can run. More likely, there will be a
web interface that presents the different reports that can be accessed and run
by the users. Figure 11-3 shows just one possibility of what a BI portal could
look like. This is a conceptual drawing, rather than a screen shot from a speciﬁc
product. A simple Internet search will yield many different examples of what
the current technology can deliver. (Note that a BI dashboard could look like a
BI portal; it really depends upon the tool and what your organization decides
to call it.)
Perhaps the BI application is just one of many pieces that are included in
the business group portal. In this case, the BI reports and data sit side by side
with other applications and functions that are used by that business group.
Presentation—How Do You Want to See Results?
Once you have navigated your way to ﬁnd a report or screen of interest,
there are many different ways that results can be presented. Some results are
pre-deﬁned and are displayed when requested. In other cases, parameters or
variables may need to be set before the report is run. Generally, options and
lists are provided to aid in the selection process. Once each of the parameters is
set, the report is run. The results may be returned in a wide variety of formats,
including the following:
Classic tabular reports: Introduced earlier, these are a common method
for presenting results. This is a familiar format that most people are com-
fortable with.

Charts or graphs: These are another common type of data presentation.
These may be bar charts, pie charts, line graphs, or scatter charts. A
graphical display of results helps to easily identify anomalies and outliers.
This can help you to quickly hone in on areas for further research.
Maps: These are another visual method to quickly convey data. They
may be color-coded based upon selected data or bars may rise from
the geography to indicate the value of the business measurement. For
example, maps can be colored or coded to highlight concentrations of
customers or to indicate areas where insured property is located.
Scorecards: These are the display of key performance measures in a
‘‘report card’’ manner. These key measures are calculated and compared
to target values as a means of determining how well the organization

is doing. Often the scorecard represents the results of many different
analyses to determine each of the different measurements and areas
of the business. These are combined into a single display to provide
a comprehensive view of the entire business or a speciﬁc area of the
business. The most useful scorecards are interactive, which means that
they support the capability to dig deeper into the measures. Figure 11-4
shows what a scorecard might look like. Again, this is a line drawing to
illustrate the concept. Actual scorecards also use color to help highlight
areas to focus on.

Dials and other visual representation: These types of report can provide
at-a-glance interpretations of results. Rather than see a tabular report
with actual sales compared to forecasted sales, a dial can show the actual
sales, with the sales forecast value as a line or bar across the dial at the
appropriate target number. This is similar to a typical United Way fund
drive poster. A giant thermometer shape is posted on the wall. The target
is a line near the top of the thermometer shape. As employees donate, the
thermometer is ﬁlled in. You can easily see how far the organization has
moved toward the goal.
Dashboards: This is a term that is used to describe the display of many
different business measures at the same time. The business intelligence
dashboard results combine a graphical and numeric display. The results
may be shown as dials, and color is used to highlight various metrics.
The intent is not to ﬁll the screen with numbers, but rather to identify the
most critical measures and present them in a way that enables a quick
understanding. Figure 11-5 is a line drawing of a sample dashboard.
Like scorecards, dashboards also make use of color to facilitate the inter-
pretation of the data. Dashboards often contain a variety of ﬁnancial and

operational results, compared to targets or goals. The intent is to provide
a quick at-a-glance view of the state of the business, similar to how the
dashboard of a car provides information about all critical functions.
As with most business intelligence applications, the ability to interactively
drill into more detail increases its usefulness. For example, the dashboard
may show a drop in customer satisfaction. Drilling down may show
that the customers who were recently assigned to the newly created
southeast sales region were unhappy with the change. There was not an
overall customer satisfaction problem, but clearly some action is needed
to address all customers in the new southeast region.

While there are many different ways that results can be presented, there is
still one more step to consider. How will someone receive these results?
Delivery—How Do You Receive the Results?
There are many different ways that the results from a BI application can be
delivered. The delivery mechanisms vary between BI tools and should
be aligned with the needs and skills of the different target audiences. The
following is simply a representative sample of what can be done.
BI tools typically include the capability to directly display the results of
reports and analyses. These are presented on the user’s screen and may
be enabled to support interaction, such as drilling down.
Standard ofﬁce application output includes word processing, spread-
sheets and PDF, which are common formats for data delivery. These
put the results from the BI tool into formats that are easily used by
other commonly used ofﬁce productivity tools for further manipulation
and formatting. Spreadsheet output enables additional analysis to be
performed. This type of output can be dropped onto a user’s desktop.
E-mail attachments are another way to receive output for standard ofﬁce
application output. A set of standard reports may be generated and
automatically e-mailed to the appropriate people. In other cases, a person
using the BI application can decide to send the results of his or her
analysis to someone else by attaching the output to an e-mail message.
E-mail notiﬁcation is when the data from the data warehouse is included
as part of the body of the e-mail message itself. This is often done
for exception reporting. An e-mail is generated when certain exception
conditions are met. For example, an e-mail may be sent only when the
number of insurance quotes issued is more than 10% lower than the prior
year’s quotes for the same month to date. This enables agents to see that
at the current rate, they will not make their goal for the month.
Non-PC delivery on other devices is increasingly popular. This may
be receiving e-mail messages on a personal digital assistant (PDA) or a
sophisticated cell phone. The critical difference here is that the format of
a message must be carefully designed to be read on such a small screen.
The most critical content must be concisely displayed so that as much as
possible can be viewed on the initial page. This may require quite a bit of
testing to ensure that the results are presented in a useful and meaningful
way.
Other ﬁle formats may be created as a means to provide data to other
specialized applications. These may provide additional analytical capabil-
ities. Sometimes data feeds must continue to be created until all existing
reporting systems can be shut off. This is usually the case when the

352
Part IV
■Building the Project
data warehouse does not have all of the required data yet, so the old
system continues to run until the data warehouse can fully support the
functionality.
With the many different possibilities for navigating, presenting, and deliv-
ering results from the BI application, it is important to understand who the
audience is for your BI application. There are typically multiple types of users
of the data warehouse. BI applications are often tailored to meet the speciﬁc
needs of these different types of users.
Supporting Different Levels of Use
The project team needs to have an understanding of the different audiences
who will be using the data warehouse. Depending upon the audience, different
data delivery methods can be used to target each group’s speciﬁc needs. There
will be differences between groups based upon frequency of use and/or job
function. Each organization must determine which business roles and/or
groups need access to data and what the expectations are for them to perform
analysis. Using this input, the BI application can be tailored to meet these
different audiences. The following list describes several different types of DW
users in order to illustrate some of the possibilities:
Mainstream users: These are users who access the data warehouse
business intelligence application on a regular basis. The data is needed
to help these people complete their day-to-day responsibilities. These
regular users become very adept at using report templates to create their
own reports. They often save these as new reports for themselves and/or
their co-workers. Mainstream users do not perform advanced analysis,
but use the results of analyses developed by others to support their work.
They generally prefer to use structured navigation to get to the reports
that they need. This may be by using a BI portal or by using a web
interface of the BI application.
Business analyst: This is someone who needs to track what is happening
in the business and to understand the reason for changes in the business.
This job requires them to go beyond looking at reports. They need
to perform analyses on a regular basis, perhaps to support business
reviews. Business analysts also work on requests to look into ﬂuctuations
inbusinessresults. These are the people whocreate newreports. However,
a business analyst does not usually have the ability to change the building
blocks of the BI application itself. Business analysts can have a wide range
of preferences for diving into the BI application. BI portals and structured
navigation work well, but the business analysts must be able to modify
and extend the starting reports to address their requirements.

Chapter 11
■Data Delivery: What you Finally See
353
Casual Users: These are users who occasionally come to the data ware-
house to get answers. This is not part of their daily work. Casual users
generally use the BI application in a structured manner. They access
pre-deﬁned reports, and are able to perform some limited manipula-
tion of the results. They are not typically interested in performing more
in-depth analysis, but rather are simply looking for a single report. The
BI application must be set up to ensure ease of use for these casual users.
Everything must be laid out intuitively and clearly labeled.
Casual users generally have structured and guided paths to get results
from the BI application. Pulling up pre-deﬁned reports is usually all they
are allowed to do. They would have limited ﬂexibility. When there is a
need for a different report, casual users would ask someone else to create
it for them.
Consumers of results: There are many people in the organization who
are consumers of the BI solution. These people may not even know that
they are using a data warehouse at all. Information is provided to them
as part of another business process or served up automatically for them.
For example, when you make a purchases online, other recommended
products are often offered by accessing the purchase patterns of other
people who bought the product you just put into your electronic shop-
ping cart. As another example, some people may sign into the network
ﬁrst thing every morning and see a company news page that includes
sales results and quality measures. These are provided by the data
warehouse.
As technology has expanded the reach of the BI delivery mechanisms,
more and more people can beneﬁt from the data warehouse, even though
they may never actually log in and run a BI report themselves. Consumers
of results have no idea that they are even accessing a data warehouse.
The access is completely embedded in other applications, or results
are simply sent electronically. They never go to a BI portal to run a
report.
External users: These users of the BI application are people who have
business relationships with the organization and can beneﬁt from seeing
information about that relationship. External users may be customer,
vendors, suppliers, agents, or other business partners. This use may
be in the form of providing access to sales history to your customers,
or providing business results to franchise managers. These users can
have a proﬁle like those already described, such as business analysts or
casual users. If there are any external users, there are additional security
responsibilities that need to be addressed to ensure the safety and privacy
of all the data in the data warehouse. Most often, external users have
structured access to the data warehouse. They may have limited ﬂexibility

354
Part IV
■Building the Project
to drill down into more detail, but usually they are not allowed to make
any changes to reports. External users have a similar proﬁle as regular
users, but because they are not employed by the organization, additional
security requirements must be in place.
Power users: These may be a business analyst or a BI application devel-
oper who reports to the business itself. These users have often been writing
programs and complex spreadsheets for years to produce reports. They
are often the most knowledgeable people in the organization about the
strengths and pitfalls of the data. When power users are able to use the
data warehouse, they are likely to build reports from scratch. Power users
often have access to more capabilities and controls within the BI tool.
They may set up the business measure library or reﬁne reports developed
by others so that they can be published with all of the other standard
templates. The power user’s role on a project is that of a BI developer.
Once a project ends, their role in the business continues and they often
develop new analyses and reports. Power users are typically the only
people outside of IT who have the skills and interest to dig deeply into
the BI tool’s raw power.
Construction of the BI Solution
Now that the basics of business intelligence have been discussed, let’s take a
closer look at what this looks like on a project. The major tasks sound similar to
any other system construction effort, but the work itself is much different. The
development work is typically done using robust business intelligence tools.
As introduced in Chapter 4, there are two different types of BI developers. The
ﬁrst type is responsible for the more technical aspects, including conﬁguration
and setup of the BI tool itself. The second type of BI developer is responsible
for the design and development of BI reports and applications. Because most
of the development work is not programming, the resources to build the BI
application could be from IT or the business. The tasks that are done are the
same regardless of which group the BI developers report to. There are several
steps involved in the construction of a BI application, but ﬁrst take a moment
to look at the bigger picture. What is the business really trying to accomplish?
Planning for Business Change
The ability to realize the full beneﬁt of the data warehouse often means that the
business must change some processes. If business process change has not been
studied yet, then take the time to do so before designing the BI application.
Otherwise, it may simply automate existing processes or redirect where data
is pulled. While the data warehouse project team may be able to provide some

Chapter 11
■Data Delivery: What you Finally See
355
ideas or input, evaluating and changing business processes should be done by
the business group itself. Sometimes there are well-established groups within
an organization that specialize in business process management. There are
also plenty of external consulting organizations that can assist with business
process change.
Initial changes may simply be to streamline current processes to take
advantage of direct access to the data warehouse. Manual steps can be
eliminated, and other complex spreadsheets may be able to be replaced with
the BI application. Sometimes, this is the opportunity that you have been
waiting for to make more signiﬁcant changes. In either case, now is the time
to consider how the BI application can help accomplish these changes.
Design—What Needs to Be Delivered?
The design of the BI application itself is likely to be done shortly after dimen-
sional modeling is complete. The project team has spent time learning and
documenting the business requirements (see Chapter 6), and the dimensional
model (see Chapter 7) provides details about what data elements will be
available. Now is the time to think about what needs to be delivered.
The ﬁrst step in this process is to identify each target audience and what
type of use they need. Each different audience may have distinctly different
requirements for the results they need to see. Who needs to look at what data?
Market researchers have much different data needs than purchasing agents.
The data used for analysis by the marketing department to plan promotions
for the next year is different from what a sales rep running a set of reports to
support an account review needs.
While BI developers often have a lot of knowledge about what the BI
application needs to do, it is still worthwhile to get input from others in the
business community. This helps to build ownership across groups who will
be using the BI application. The design of the BI application can be done
via design sessions, or individual and/or group meetings. The design focus
should be on the high-priority business areas that were identiﬁed during
initial requirements gathering, and they should be within the scope of the
project. Based upon the experience of the project team, much of this work
can be done within the team. However, it is important to continue to develop
support, which can be done by sharing ideas with other representatives from
the business community. The steps of the design process are as follows:
1. List needed reports: For existing reports that are still wanted, ensure that
they are identiﬁed so the team can use this as a starting point. For new
reports, draft a brief description of the report. For example, an Agency
Performance Report would include premiums, claims, and new policy
close rates compared to the previous year and to the current year’s target.

356
Part IV
■Building the Project
2. Prioritize candidate reports: Even within the scope of a project, there
may be dozens of reports that could be built. It is not feasible to deliver all
of them at once. The project team can do some preliminary prioritization
of these candidate reports. This task should be shared with the business
champion, and possibly the executive and IT sponsors for their input and
review. The rest of the BI application development efforts can continue
with the approved priorities.
3. Brainstorm reports: Sketch out on a white board what each report
might look like. Focus on the row and column headers and the business
measures needed. If a series of reports is wanted, explore which report
you want to see ﬁrst, and then outline what should follow. Perhaps use a
spreadsheet to capture these ideas.
4. Prototype: In some cases, it may be helpful to do some prototyping of
reports. Once the dimensional model is complete, sample data can be
loaded into a database so that the BI tool can be set up. Drafting candidate
reports may be able to happen ‘‘live’’ with the tool and the sample data.
5. Determine navigation: It is also important to work with the business
to draft ideas for navigation. Opinions on how reports should be orga-
nized can vary dramatically between a technical and business viewpoint.
Technical people often like to group reports based upon type of data.
Business people tend to group reports as they are used to walk through
common business processes. This step should not be skipped even if
the BI developers are from the business community. Discussions about
navigation paths often occur after the reports are deﬁned.
6. Include security: The project team must also pay attention to any
data, report, or application security requirements. Who can access
which reports? At what level of detail? These considerations must be
part of the overall design.
The design process is not just an initial set of meetings, but should be a
series of interactive sessions. In a conference room, it is very easy to dream up
fantastic reports that are impossible to build. Often these ideas need further
clariﬁcation. At the time the report is dreamed up, it makes sense, but the next
morning the report may not be as clear. For example, suppose there is interest
in building a report to show proﬁt by customer category. Unfortunately, with
further thought, it is realized that the proﬁt measures are not going to be
loaded initially with the customer dimension. This means that proﬁt will not
be available by customer category. Perhaps the standard proﬁt fact is not what
is really needed. This requirement could be met by providing estimated proﬁt,
which is the sales dollars less the estimated manufacturing and shipping costs.
If the standard proﬁt really is needed, then this reﬂects a gap in the initial

Chapter 11
■Data Delivery: What you Finally See
357
project delivery that must be addressed. Communication may be needed to
reset expectations, or the team can estimate how much additional work is
needed to get the required data.
On a more technical note, spend time designing a common look and feel
to be used for all output from the data warehouse. Decide what headers and
footers should be in place and create recommendations for the font and size
of the report headings and body. All reports that are distributed through the
common/standard library will adhere to these standards. This makes all of
the output from the data warehouse look consistent and professional.
Development
Although this part of the project is referred to as BI development, it is quite
different from most systems development efforts. Most of this work is done
using graphical interfaces, and does not typically involve much programming
or coding. This work can be divided into two categories. The ﬁrst is work that
is generally done once to set things up. The second category is work that is
done repeatedly on a project, on an ongoing basis. Each technology will have
an impact on the speciﬁc tasks that need to be performed and what these tasks
are called for that tool. Regardless of the technology used, several of the initial
steps are common:
1. Installing the technology: This involves getting the software loaded and
ready for use. The installation is done up front, by IT. Individual software
vendors provide the details for installation.
2. Conﬁguring the BI tool: This typically involves setting up the metadata.
This is where the physical structures are mapped to the business labels
for each data element. It also involves setting up relationships or drill
paths between the dimensional attributes. The facts themselves are also
deﬁned. The Business Dimensional Model contains much of the business
information needed to do this work, which is usually done by a BI
developer, who may be from either IT or the business. Conﬁguration
tasks are only needed when there are changes to the data warehouse or
new data is loaded.
3. Setting up business measures: This is done by setting up the calculations.
The Business Measures Worksheet discussed in Chapter 7 should contain
what is needed to set these up. Setting up business measures is also done
by a BI developer up front.
N O T E If you are not using a BI tool, the development effort will entail more
conventional coding, which requires technical skills and is done by IT.
Once the BI tool is installed and conﬁgured, development can begin in
earnest. These steps are done to get the BI application off the ground, but the

358
Part IV
■Building the Project
same tasks continue to be done, even after the end of the project. Some of the
steps that are repeated include the following:
Building report templates: This involves setting up the report layouts,
exception criteria, and parameters. It also includes developing how the
results are presented, such as a tabular report, a chart, or a scorecard.
Building the initial reports is done by a BI developer, either from IT or
the business.
Creating additional reports: Once the BI application is released for use,
any other users who have been granted appropriate privileges can create
other reports.
Setting up navigation: Building the navigation paths is the work to
organize and display how the starter set of reports can be located and
accessed. This work is also done by a BI developer, but it can be a bit
more technical. Often this is done by a BI developer from IT, but it could
still be completed by a BI developer from the business community. This
work is not typically done by other business users of the application.
The project work to build the BI application is almost done when the reports
have been built and the navigation paths are set up. Now it is time to test
everything, a very important step that must be done to ensure that the BI
application works correctly.
Testing BI Applications and Validating Data
The BI application must be tested in a similar manner to any other system
that is tested. How the data has been deﬁned in the BI tool must be validated.
This includes ensuring that drill paths are set up properly and that business
measures are being calculated correctly. Then, each report must be tested
to ensure that it delivers what was intended. Some reports may be created
properly but may not provide the expected insight. It is worth adapting these
reports to be more useful, with the guidance of the business community.
The second type of testing that is done during BI application construction
is validation of the data itself. Regardless of the extent of the testing and
validation that was done during construction of the ETL system, more data
problems will be discovered now. Due to the visual nature of BI tools, data
problems are often quickly identiﬁed. A lot of this data validation occurs during
the development of reports. As problems crop up, work with the entire project
team to ﬁgure out the source of the problem and work toward a resolution.
Data problems may result from errors in deﬁning business measures in the BI
tool, errors in the ETL processing rules, and sometimes even in the underlying
source system. The investigation of data problems can be complex and time
consuming.

Chapter 11
■Data Delivery: What you Finally See
359
N O T E One can quickly create reports using today’s BI tools. Because many data
problems may be identiﬁed, build enough contingency time into the project
schedule to allow for this additional data validation and correction work.
Additional Responsibilities
Building a BI application is more than just setting up a few reports and
the job is done. As already discussed, the data must be deﬁned, reports or
results prepared for display, and the navigation path created. In addition,
other administrative responsibilities need attention. You need to ensure that
the right people have the appropriate level of access and you must prevent the
wrong people from having access. This includes who can look at the data and
who can make changes to the BI reports and applications.
Security—Who Can Look at the Data?
Any security requirements should have been identiﬁed when gathering busi-
ness requirements. Security requirements also surface when working on
building the ETL system. However, the reality of securing the data may
only sink in now that the data is going to be published. Security can be
addressed in several different ways. Many security measures are part of how
the BI application is constructed:
Prohibit the loading of sensitive data into the data warehouse. If highly
sensitive data elements are not included, then even if the security is
broken, the sensitive data is not there. With medical records, this is
often a method used to protect patient identity and comply with HIPPA
privacy regulations. Name and social security number, street address,
and phone number are not loaded into the data warehouse. A unique
identiﬁer, or surrogate key, should be assigned to each patient during the
ETL processing. This surrogate key enables the patient data to be tracked
and trended without revealing any personally identiﬁable information.
Utilize the database management system security functionality. For most
of the databases this is exactly the same security system that is used by the
other operational applications. Therefore, if it is secure enough to store
the ATM transactions, it is secure enough for the data warehouse.
N O T E Regardless of other layers of security, if the database management
system itself is not secured, backdoor access may still be possible.
Utilize the BI technology’s security features. Most of the BI tools have
some sort of security built into the tool. Take advantage of what is pro-
vided ‘‘out of the box.’’

360
Part IV
■Building the Project
Leverage standard network security and ﬁrewalls. Many BI applications
are released over the organization’s intranet or the Internet. The BI
application should adhere to all of the corporate standards for securing
any application that is delivered using these methods.
Build security into the BI application itself: There are several common
situations in which data must be limited from view:
Often, organizational boundaries need to be recognized. For example,
individual sales reps can look at their own results, but not others,
whereas a district manager can see the results for the whole district
and all of the reps who report to that district.
Security may be used to control access to pre-built reports. Access may
be granted or restricted based by user group or individual user.
In addition to accessing a report, sometimes there is a need to secure
data as you drill down. Consider a student reporting system. Identiﬁ-
able student details such as name and social security number are not
in the data warehouse, but if you drill down far enough you would be
able to ﬁgure out the identity of some students (e.g., there is only one
female student in third grade at Roosevelt Elementary School who is
in a wheelchair). You can build into the BI application a control that
limits the display of data if the set represents fewer than ten students.
It is important that all users of the data warehouse be informed about the
organization’s policies for use and distribution of data. This includes helping
users understand what security is in place and why.
System Controls—Who Can Change What?
The security measures deﬁne who can access the BI application and what data
will be visible. There will be many people who are granted access to the data
but who should not be authorized to make changes to the BI environment and
application.
BI technologies provide the capability to set up standard business measures
and report templates. These can be deﬁned and maintained by business
analysts or power users. Only people who have been given the responsibility,
and appropriate permissions, should be able to make changes to the standard
components of the BI application. Some users may be given privileges to create
their own business measures and reports. These are not part of the ‘‘library’’
that is available to the rest of the business community. These controls need to
be in place to ensure the integrity of the BI environment itself.
Identify the individuals who will be given the responsibility of making
changes to the BI environment. They must be provided with the appropriate
training to know how to perform these functions in the BI tool. Additionally,

Chapter 11
■Data Delivery: What you Finally See

these individuals should have enough business experience to help ensure
that any changes are valid and that new reports and measures are set up
accurately.
Planning a Successful Launch
Releasing a business intelligence application—whether it is a simple report
or a full dashboard—is much more that just ﬁnishing the BI application
and then putting a link on the web. Success requires appropriate education
and support.
N O T E Regardless of how much planning and scheduling has been done to
release the BI application, if it is not ready, then do not move forward. Postpone
any education and launch activities until the data warehouse and BI application
are ready for full use. Resolve any problems and then move forward.
Marketing the Solution
As with the launch of any new product, releasing the BI application typically
includes a marketing campaign too. You can do any or all of the following:
Name the BI application, if you have not done so already. Use meaningful
business names such as ‘‘Vendor Scorecard’’ or ‘‘Sales Dashboard.’’
Make posters to announce that the BI application is coming (using the
business name).
Include a note in the appropriate company newsletters.
Arrange for a news ﬂash to be posted on the main company intranet page.
Send e-mail reminders to the target audience.
Pass out buttons or candy.
These basic marketing activities need to communicate what the BI applica-
tion will be able to do. This is best known and understood by the business
representatives who have been involved with the project. The marketing mes-
sages should address the business value, such as likely beneﬁts or how the
BI application provides data needed to help the group attain its annual goals.
Following are some sample messages:
Early identiﬁcation of at-risk customers enables us to take proactive steps
to retain them.
Easy access and use of accurate sales history can improve the accuracy of
sales forecasting.

■Building the Project
By studying prescription claim payments we can identify opportunities to
enroll customers in mail order prescription drug plans to reduce medical
claim costs.
Simple things can generate positive emotion and momentum. When the
marketing message comes from business peers and management, it carries
much more weight than a message from a project manager.
Learning to Use the Data without a Technical Degree
In order to ensure that the data warehouse and the BI application are put to
good use, some sort of training must be provided. The type and extent of the
training depends on the audience. Two different kinds of education are needed.
The most obvious, and most commonly provided type, is teaching people how
to use the BI tool and/or application. The other, and more important type, is
teaching people about the data and how it should be used.
Learning about the Data
In order to understand and properly use the results from the BI application,
time must be invested in learning about the data. This includes sharing core
business deﬁnitions and how they can be found in the data. For example, it
is important for people to understand that the new deﬁnition of a customer is
more inclusive than what was used in the past.
Users need to learn what reports are available, what the reports contain,
and how the data should be used effectively. This type of education is focused
on business processes and how to apply the BI results to those processes.
Business analysts and power users need to learn more about what data is
in the data warehouse, and become familiar with the Business Dimensional
Model. This helps users understand what questions can be supported, and
helps when forming new queries and reports.
N O T E
It is critical to provide education about any business process changes
linked with the BI application. Be sure to include the business rationale for the
change.
Learning about the BI Tool/Application
The second type of education focuses on the mechanics of using the BI appli-
cation itself. Casual users may need minimal training to use a well-designed
web interface to access a set of structured reports. Mainstream users and
business analysts need to learn the mechanics to set parameters and interact
with the results. Some business analysts and power users will need additional
technical training in order to leverage the capabilities of the BI tool. This
may include attending training offered directly by the tool vendor to learn
advanced features.

Chapter 11
■Data Delivery: What you Finally See
363
T I P
Too often, training is viewed as a mechanism to learn which buttons to
push. Learning how to rotate a report or change the format of a graph may be
helpful, but it is much more critical for business users to learn what data is
available and how it can be applied to their work.
The project team can put together the overall training plan to accommodate
these different levels of data and tool education. Courses should be offered peri-
odically to enable people to get more training as they are ready to dig deeper
in using the environment. This can also serve as a refresher for anyone who
has not used the data warehouse for a while and is ready to get started again.
Ensuring That the Right Help Is Available
Beyond providing basic education, it is important to have resources available
to assist with use of the BI application. While most organizations have a
technical support line, that staff will not have the skills necessary to provide
support for the data warehouse. Some typical technical support will be needed
to ensure that the servers are up and running and that the database is online.
More of the support requests stem from confusion about results on a report
or how to get a certain type of data. The data warehouse help desk must be
staffed with people who have experience using the BI tool and application.
They must also have a good understanding of the reports and the underlying
data. Often, they will be required to assist others in understanding what a
report represents and how to interpret its results. This is far more than just
ensuring that the website is available.
Many users will simply tap into the BI application to pull a report because
that is all they need. A help desk format is sufﬁcient for this type of interaction.
However, it is important to provide enough support to those who will be
using the data warehouse more extensively. For these users, it is beneﬁcial to
provide more proactive support. The work is the same, regardless of whether
support is provided by IT or business personnel. If the support team is within
the business unit, then they likely share work space with the other business
users. If support is provided by IT, then they need to go into the business area
to see what is going on. This may mean having ‘‘ofﬁce hours’’ during which
a representative is the ﬂoor (e.g., every Tuesday and Thursday afternoon) for
questions and support. Alternatively, it may mean that the data warehouse/BI
support team has a cubical assigned to them, and someone sits right in the
business area every day.
The beneﬁt of such close proximity is that the support team can jump in
to help whenever the need arises. There is usually an intensity in the area
when requests come in to provide reports or more detail. The intensity rises
to a panic when the request comes from the senior executives or the board of
directors. In order to fulﬁll these requests, people often gravitate to what they
know best. When a data warehouse is new, the staff is more comfortable with
the old system. It may not be pretty, but they know how to get the job done.

364
Part IV
■Building the Project
When a member of the data warehouse support team is embedded within
the business group, this sense of intensity and excitement represents an oppor-
tunity to help. The support representative can step forward to learn more about
what is needed. If the data is available through the data warehouse, then the
support person can offer to pull it for the business team. When this occurs, the
business analyst should observe to learn how this is done. Due to the pressure,
it is OK for the support person to do the driving. The next time, the business
analyst can drive, and the support person can provide step-by-step help.
Sometimes, business users are geographically dispersed across the country
or the world. Other support mechanisms must be explored to help ensure
success. This may mean that education and support are delivered via the
web, which might include an online library of frequently asked questions
(FAQs) and short video clips showing how to use certain functions of the BI
application. Thisalsohasimplicationsforschedulingthe supportstafftoensure
that skilled resources are available to help anywhere (e.g., the ofﬁces located in
Asia). These issues are similar to what any other system implementation faces
with a global user base. Tap into any communication and support mechanisms
that are already in place to address these global challenges.
The more times that the data warehouse can be used to support daily (as
well as last-minute) requests, the more the business gains conﬁdence. Over
time, as users gain conﬁdence in both the data and their own skills, they will
rely more and more on the data warehouse/BI application to do their work.
There must be a management commitment from both IT and the business to
ensure that the right people are allocated to provide this level of support.
N O T E
You have made a signiﬁcant investment in time, personnel, and dollars.
Make the investment worthwhile by putting in place the education and support
needed to ensure success.
In Real Life
The two companies that we have been following continue to make classic
mistakes with their data warehouse projects. Let’s take a look at how the data
deployment has been going.
BI at Giant Company
The project team’s direction was set: Recreate all of the existing reports. There
are hundreds of reports. The highest-priority reports have been identiﬁed,
but there are still over 100 reports to recreate. The project team was able to
estimate an average development effort by report. Finish the reports and the
project will be done. This approach is endorsed by the representatives from

Chapter 11
■Data Delivery: What you Finally See
365
the business because the reports are currently being used. The only way to get
rid of the old reporting system is to replace those reports.
As the team began to look at the reports in more detail, they realized that the
original estimates were too low. It was going to take a lot more work to rebuild
the existing reports. To make matters worse, the business analysts identiﬁed
several additional reports per week. The processing and manipulation of data
in many of the reports was extremely complex and the true business logic was
not clear. After ﬂoundering for a few weeks and understanding the true effort
to convert all of the reports, the team decided they needed to step back and
regroup.
The organization is dependent on the current reports because this is the
only way that the data can be accessed currently. Looking more closely at how
these reports are used, it became clear that the reports themselves were just
the tip of the iceberg. Rarely was a report used as is, to help the business.
Instead, the data from the report is loaded into a spreadsheet, often combined
with data from other reports. This new set of data was the beginning of further
manipulation that was performed through a series of spreadsheets. Finally,
another twist is that the current reports are static.
The project team developed a two-pronged approach. This was reviewed
and approved by the business champion. The ﬁrst plan of attack is to pare
down the reports to be converted. To do this, the reports are grouped to
identify patterns. It turns out that there are multiple versions of a single
‘‘report,’’ each creating a slightly different view.
For example, there is a sales top line report for the entire company, and
then four reports (that look the same) for each of the sales regions. From there,
dozens of other reports provide data for each district and unit. Using the
ﬂexible BI tool, a single report template can be deﬁned with a parameter for
which part of the sales organization should be included on the report. This
single template can replace the dozens of sales top line reports in the old system.
To take things a step further, each of the report templates is designed to be
interactive. This enables users to drill down into more detail as needed. The
new focused effort to replace existing reports was able to get started while
some of the team members focused on the second prong of the attack: better
deﬁning the BI application itself. Using the steps described in this chapter,
the team was able to identify new reports and analyses to bring additional
value to the results of the data warehouse. While the initial delivery of BI is
via reports, this is really just the starting point. The business plans to use these
reports to spark more in-depth analysis.

Limited business requirements were gathered on the data warehouse project

■Building the Project
data? All of it. The approach is to load the data, set up a business intelligence
tool, and let the users do what they want. No structured applications or
navigation were built.
Once the data was loaded and released, there was little actual use. Needless
to say, with the investment already spent, this is disappointing. Rather than
just scrap the whole thing, the project team investigated the situation. The
feedback was loud and clear: The data warehouse is too hard to use. To
overcome the difﬁculties and resistance, more training was set up to teach
people the technology, but it was still too difﬁcult. Everyone began to think
that the wrong BI tool was selected.
Luckily, the project team decided to look to the data warehousing best
practices for ideas before forging ahead to ﬁnd a new tool. The team learned
that a suite of ‘‘starter’’ reports is recommended. Indeed, the business users
did not want to build their own reports; they just wanted the results delivered
and ready for them to study and analyze. The team also developed training
about the data and how to use the starter reports. This was well received and
the business group began using the data warehouse more frequently.
Summary
There is more to using the data warehouse than simply installing a business
intelligence tool. This chapter provided an introduction to what is possible
with BI. A BI application has multiple layers, starting with the data content
and providing a navigation path to get to the information you need. The layers
also include the many different options for how data is presented, including
tabular reports, charts, or a dashboard of indicators. You also learned that
there are many different options for delivering these results.
BI development includes familiar systems development steps, including
design, development, and testing, but this work is usually done with graphical
interfaces, making it much easier than programming. In fact, the BI devel-
opment work is often done by BI developers who come from the business
community. To help the business community use and get value from the BI
application, appropriate education and support must be provided. This helps
the data warehouse to become an integral part of how you do business.
The project is nearing completion, but there are some additional areas that
can help ensure success. The next chapter discusses what needs to be done to
maintain the data warehouse. Factors that can contribute to impeding use of
the data warehouse are shared along with recommendations for re-building
momentum.

Warehouse
The effort and energy needed to sustain a data warehouse does not end
when the project tasks are all complete. This chapter shares what is needed to
release the data warehouse for use and what steps are necessary to formally
wrap up the project. It also looks forward, describing what can be done to
encourage adoption of the data warehouse. Additional effort is also required
to keep the data warehouse running. Finally, the chapter explores what can
cause a data warehouse to fall short of expectations, and offers practical steps
to get things back on track.
Finishing the Project
The project has been underway for many weeks or possibly months. The
requirements have been gathered and the overall solution designed. The ETL
system was built and the data has been loaded and validated. A BI application
has been built to facilitate use of the data warehouse. Only a few more things
are needed to wrap up the project.
Recapping the BI Application Launch
Ideas for launching the BI application were introduced in Chapter 11.
These launch activities are some of the last tasks on the project. Highlights of
the launch activities include the following:
Marketing and communication to let potential users of the data warehouse
know that it is ready for use. These efforts can also help pique interest
by demonstrating how the data warehouse can support users with their
work.
369

370
Part V
■Next Steps—Expanding on Success
Two kinds of education are needed:
Education about data content, meaning, and how to apply it to
daily work is needed so that the data can be understood and used
effectively.
Education about the mechanics of using the BI application is
needed to help users get started. This includes training about how
to navigate to ﬁnd what you are looking for and how to access
the data you need. Education should also be provided to meet
more advanced user needs to help them change reports and
leverage more advanced features of the BI tool for more sophisticated
analyses.
Support is necessary to ensure that any problems are identiﬁed and
addressed in a timely manner. Support is also needed to help people
understand what is available and how to use the BI application.
These are important activities that help the business users to learn what is
possible with the data warehouse. These are often some of the last tasks on the
project plan. Before the project is considered complete, take the time to review
how things went.
Post-Implementation Review
Once all of the other project tasks have been completed, the project team
should meet again to reﬂect on the project. Don’t wait months to get everyone
together; meet soon so that the project experiences are still fresh. Conduct a
systematic review of each of the different areas of the project; basically, walk
through the high-level tasks of the project plan and other key topics, making
sure to touch on the following:
Requirements gathering
Data modeling
Data governance, ownership, and quality
ETL system design and development
BI application design and development
End-user education
End-user support
Education for the project team members
Political and/or organizational assistance and hurdles
Process and accuracy of estimating effort and setting the project schedule

Chapter 12
■Managing the Production Data Warehouse
371
For each topic discussed, try to identify what happened, making sure
to mention what worked well. For problem areas, discuss potential causes,
whether it preventable, and what should be done differently the next time.
Due to the sensitivity of some areas, such as personnel, ﬁnancials, or other
politically charged topics, it may also be useful to conduct a separate project
review with managers.
When the post-implementation review ﬁndings and recommendations are
documented, the rest of the organization can also beneﬁt from this team’s
experiences. Take the time to capture key ﬁndings, including recommendations
for future projects.
Looking Back—Did you Accomplish Your Objectives?
The post-implementation project review is focused on the mechanics of run-
ning a data warehouse project. A project team may have completed every task
on the plan, but that does not necessarily mean that the project is a success.
Now is the time to go back to the initial project documents, as discussed
in Chapter 5. The project charter should include the objectives. Be sure to
also look at any project change control documents that may have modiﬁed
the original objectives. Have these objectives been met? Were any additional
project goals identiﬁed through the requirements gathering process? Has the
data warehouse been able to support the attainment of those goals?
It may be too soon, right after the project ends, to determine whether the
goals for the data warehouse have been met. It takes some time for the solution
to settle in and for business users to harness the potential to realize value.
While some organizations may begin to see immediate results, it is more
typical to see the beneﬁts after several months. While there are indeed some
multi-million dollar success stories, success is more often attained by adding
up the results of many smaller decisions.
Adopting the Solution
The most successful data warehouses are those that are used as part of the
daily business. Pulling up the BI application is not something that has to be
done because the boss says you have to; it simply becomes how work gets
done. It takes time for the BI application to become ingrained. People need
to grow comfortable with using the BI application. They need to build their
conﬁdence that the data is really there and will still be there tomorrow and the
next day. As the group gains experience using the data warehouse, real change
can happen. In order to determine how usage patterns grow and change over
time, use of the data warehouse must be tracked.

372
Part V
■Next Steps—Expanding on Success
Tracking Data Warehouse Use
The true measurement of a successful data warehouse is the business value.
This may have been articulated when the overall project was reviewed, as
discussed earlier in this chapter. Taking it further, Chapter 13 provides more
suggestions for ﬁnding and tracking business value on an ongoing basis. At
this point, it is also helpful to simply understand general data warehouse
usage. This is needed to help you do the following:
Monitor performance and plan for increases in capacity.
Understand which business groups are using the DW.
Identify which business groups are not using the DW.
Identify groups or individuals who would beneﬁt from additional edu-
cation.
There are some simple ways to determine to what extent the data warehouse
is being used:
Track the number of different people who signed on to the BI appli-
cation.
Track the number of queries run against the data warehouse.
Determine the average number of queries by type of user. Depending
upon the how security is implemented, this may also be determined by
individual users too.
Count the number of new reports published for general use.
Count the total number of reports/templates created and stored by users
for their own use.
Track the number of problems reported, and how many were resolved.
Track how often the data is loaded and ready for use on time.
These statistics can be loaded into a dimensional structure that can be used
to analyze ﬂuctuations in use over time. While these measures can help you
gain an overall impression of data usage, they do not provide any insight into
what impact the data warehouse has had on the business. They can help the
data warehouse team target groups and actions that increase the number of
people using the data warehouse.
Getting the Rest of the Business Community on Board
Now that the data warehouse project is complete, the business users’ managers
need to help their staff members begin to use the data warehouse. These
business managers can get support from the data warehouse manager and

Chapter 12
■Managing the Production Data Warehouse
373
the data warehouse support team, but the primary emphasis must be from
business management.
Several things can be done to help encourage use of the data warehouse,
including the following:
Communicate when and how the data warehouse was used to address
speciﬁc business situations that have come up. Highlight situations where
the use went beyond creating a new report to performing an analysis that
yielded new insight.
Openly share situations in which executives and senior management
have tapped into and beneﬁted from the results of the data warehouse.
If an executive dashboard has been built, then make the effort to use it
yourself. This sends a clear message that it is important.
Reward those who are using the data warehouse environment for their
work. Take it a step further by providing incentives to those who actively
participate in ways that make it better. People can be rewarded for
identifying enhancements, developing business processes that utilize the
data warehouse, or improving data quality.
In addition to the business support, the data warehouse manager can also
sponsor a variety of activities to encourage use of the data warehouse:
Create interest groups that communicate regularly and meet periodically.
These can be business users who want to create maps from the output
of their analyses, people who want to learn more about the BI tool, or a
group of IT developers who want to swap techniques for dealing with
changes in the source systems. These can be started using a social network
such as Facebook, and then the groups can meet in person.
Offer ‘‘Lunch and Learn’’ sessions to offer informal education on speciﬁc
topics. Interested staff can bring their lunch to a conference room to learn
about new reports that are available, how to use speciﬁc parts of the
data, how to interact with reports, and how to perform more advanced
analyses. Offer a range of sessions and topics, from introductory through
advanced, including some with a strong business focus and others that
provide in-depth technical content. Once this format is established, the
participants can determine what topics are needed.
Create short articles and notices that can be placed on the organization’s
intranet and company or departmental newsletters. This is an extension
of the marketing that is done to launch the data warehouse. Additional
marketing efforts are needed to let others in the organization know how
the data warehouse is being used.
Encouraging or requiring use of the data warehouse/BI application must
come from business management. No matter how desperately the IT people

374
Part V
■Next Steps—Expanding on Success
want others to use and appreciate the data warehouse, the push for change
must be from within the business community. This emphasis must go beyond
the lure of easier and faster reporting, helping potential business users to see
how the data warehouse can help them do their jobs better.
Business Process Change
A great deal of attention is paid to the data side of data warehousing. Even
gathering business requirements is often focused on understanding what
data would help run the business better. However, there is another aspect
of data warehousing that is glossed over: A data warehouse can help the
business change how things are done. Building a data warehouse does not
require business process changes, but successfully using information to run
the business can drive the need to change. The data warehouse can help
identify where there is success or failure. It can help drill down into the details
to understand the underlying cause of problems. The biggest impact will be
realized as you adapt how you conduct business based upon what is learned
from the data.
Successful projects look for opportunities to incorporate business pro-
cess changes. Improving how things are done is much more effective than
automating exactly what is done today. Several different types of business
process changes can result from a data warehouse project. The possibilities are
numerous, so only a few are included here to generate ideas.
Changing How Data Is Used
One of the most obvious areas of change associated with a data warehouse is
how data is reported, analyzed, and distributed throughout the organization.
Simply arming the existing analytical staff with a data warehouse will certainly
improve their ability to use data and respond to the business, but wider beneﬁts
can be realized by pushing access to the results of the data warehouse out into
many parts of the organization. That way, everyone can see what is needed to
help them set daily priorities, determine what is working and what is not, and
compare their own performance to their peers. These changes are not simple,
but they can result in large beneﬁts to the entire organization.
Streamlining Business Processes
The data warehouse can also serve as a catalyst to change how other business
processes work. The availability of more data to identify patterns and trends
provides an opportunity to take a closer look at how things work. For
example, consider an organization for which ten steps are currently required
to implement a new set of terms on supplier contracts. Three of these steps

Chapter 12
■Managing the Production Data Warehouse
375
involve getting the required authorization to implement these terms. These
three steps can’t be changed. However, the remaining four steps involve
gathering supporting detail for the appropriate people so that they feel
comfortable signing off. Without a common source of data for reporting and
analysis, each group will pull data its own way to support their own manager’s
needs. These reports are often not what is needed by the next manager in the
chain. New reports are generated for each authorization step.
By having all of the data to support the entire authorization process in the
data warehouse, this entire set of steps should be reviewed. A single shared
set of reports that lay out the business case for the change in terms could be
created, and then made available to each person giving authorization. If any
managers have a question, they would be able to simply drill into more detail
to understand the rationale behind the request. This type of process change is
extremely difﬁcult without a data warehouse in place to provide a common,
clean source of data that can be used by each different group.
Encouraging Change
Management must make a commitment to encourage and seek true business
change. The data warehouse can serve as a catalyst, but change must come
from the business group itself.
The data warehouse is a tool to be used by the business community. This
requires reviewing business processes and assessing their effectiveness. Vision-
aries and thought leaders in the business group are often the source for this
true change. As they become more adept at using the data warehouse and
the BI application, ideas will ﬂow about how things can be done differently.
The business community, especially managers, have the responsibility to push
beyond creating reports, making the data warehouse an integral part of busi-
ness process ﬂows. This involves developing new business processes and any
associated BI reports to support the new processes. It also involves getting
people accustomed to the new ways of doing things.
Data warehouses that have had the largest impact over time are used by the
business community to constantly reevaluate and ﬁne-tune how business is
done.
The Production Data Warehouse
Once a data warehouse moves into production, two distinct types of work
continue. First, there are activities and tasks that are geared toward keeping the
current data warehouse up and running. This section focuses on the ongoing
activities needed to maintain the production data warehouse. The second type
of work is to enhance or expand the data warehouse. This is usually handled

376
Part V
■Next Steps—Expanding on Success
as new projects. Chapter 13 includes a discussion of deﬁning the work for the
expansion and growth of the data warehouse.
Stafﬁng Production Activities
Once the data warehouse project is complete, that does not mean that all of
the resources are now freed up for new projects. As with any other system,
a team of people needs to be in place to provide support and maintain the
data warehouse. The data warehouse manager, as described in Chapter 4, is
the focal point for maintaining the production data warehouse. In addition
to the DW manager, the following types of resources (which are outlined in
Chapter 4) are needed (the activities for each of these are discussed in the
following sections):
Staff to provide technical support for the environment
ETL development staff to maintain the ETL system
BI developers and power users to maintain and develop new BI reports,
analyses, and applications
Helpdesk support
Ongoing education
There are many different ways that these resources could be organized.
For the purposes of this text, these are collectively called the data warehouse
support team. They are also called centers of excellence for data warehousing
or business intelligence. Regardless of what you call it, these functions are
needed. Considerations for larger enterprises are discussed in Chapter 13.
Maintaining the Environment
Several primary components must be maintained over time: the technical
environment, the ETL system, and the BI application. The BI application
typically gets attention through regular use, but often the technical platform
does not get the appropriate level of care and the data loads are launched with
no additional attention. These are each worthy of a closer look.
Keeping Up with Technology
It seems elementary to discuss basic maintenance, but too many organizations
allow the technical environment to lag behind. While the work to keep the
technology current is done by IT, the funding is often tied to business support
of the data warehouse. Managers from both IT and the business need to ensure
that the appropriate funding and personnel resources are allocated in order to
do this work. While it is up to IT to do the work described next, it is helpful

Chapter 12
■Managing the Production Data Warehouse
377
for business managers to understand what is involved in maintaining the
technical environment. This is intended to provide a high-level view of what
needs to happen.
Once the data warehouse is built, it is important to keep all of its different
components current, including any patches and new maintenance releases.
Some organizations work actively with their vendors to get corrections to bugs
and to push for enhancements. These organizations often partner with their
vendors to beta test their new product releases or to install these new releases
soon after they become available. Some organizations just like to push the
envelope. Others ﬁnd themselves forging ahead because they need the new
product features to help them address their own business objectives.
Not all organizations are up to the challenge of getting involved with early
releases of products. This is ﬁne. You can monitor the results of other organiza-
tions. This can be accomplished by networking with other organizations that
are using the same technologies. You can also participate in local or national
user groups for that product. These groups typically work closely with the
vendors (and may even be sponsored by them) and are well informed about
the availability of new releases and any current issues. For example, if many
installation problems are occurring, you can wait a little longer to ensure that
the new product release is stable. Once the release is fairly stable, go ahead
and install it.
The Importance of Testing
Keep in mind that you can minimize risk by setting up a good test environ-
ment. In general, it is always important to have a good test environment (as
recommended in Chapter 9), and even more so when adopting new technology
early. This enables your organization to ensure that the new software will not
break anything else in your environment. If it does, the problem can be studied
and resolved without affecting your production data warehouse environment.
This also enables your staff to learn to use the new features of this release. You
should expect to ﬁnd problems with the products, but you can play a critical
role to ensure that they are ﬁxed and that the new features work properly.
The test environment is also used by the ETL and BI developers for their
work. If there is a lot of development activity, then consider setting up an
isolated test environment dedicated to testing software releases. Depending
upon the level of other development efforts and the frequency of software
releases, this additional test environment may need to be permanent.
Falling Behind
The worst-case scenario is when an organization has not kept up with releases
at all. Over a number of years, a signiﬁcant gap can develop between the current
product and the version that you are running. Eventually, support for older

378
Part V
■Next Steps—Expanding on Success
releases is dropped. That means you will not be able to get help if something
stops working. In addition, as bugs and problems are identiﬁed, the solution is
usually offered in a newer version of the product. If you are unwilling to move
forward, you have to live with these bugs. Most organizations begin to panic
when support will be dropped. The path to upgrade is then under pressure
and is based upon the vendor support timeline, rather than a schedule that is
convenient or affordable for your organization.
When support is dropped, it is usually after several releases, so getting
your environment up to current standards often means jumping ahead two or
three releases. This can be a big change; and there can be major differences in
supported conﬁgurations, how to install the software, and how to use it. These
changes are often less dramatic when taken one release at a time. It is usually
less expensive in the long run to incur upgrade costs as each release becomes
available. Costs associated with upgrades may include software, retraining of
IT and business staff, and conversion of existing programs or reports. There
may also be a delay of new development when resources are focused on
upgrading the software. The costs and time required is typically less when
moving up one release at a time compared to jumping several releases at once.
It is worth the investment to keep your data warehouse up to date with
your technology. Once everything is current, make a commitment to keep it
that way. This often means a steady stream of new product releases (some for
maintenance and some for new features). Installation of these new product
releases can often be bundled with other maintenance and enhancements that
are made to your data warehouse environment.
Monitoring Performance and Capacity Planning
Once the data warehouse is launched, it takes time for its use to become a
regular part of the day-to-day business. Data volumes will grow as you keep
loading data. The number of users will increase as more people get comfortable
with the environment. The number of queries and the complexity of queries
will also grow over time. All of these factors can lead to performance or
capacity issues.
The performance of the data warehouse must be monitored in two separate
areas. First, the performance of the ETL system must be tracked and monitored.
There is often a processing window of time that must be met to deliver the data
in a timely manner. Often, this window is speciﬁed as part of a series of service
objectives that are deﬁned and agreed to by business and IT management. The
performance of the ETL system is not usually observed by the users of the data
warehouse unless the data is not ready on time. IT organizations are typically
already equipped with the tools necessary to monitor performance of the ETL
system.

Chapter 12
■Managing the Production Data Warehouse
379
The second type of performance that must be monitored is that of the
BI application and any other data access. Data access performance is highly
visible to the user community. When queries and reports do not run in a
timely manner, IT is usually informed immediately. While IT may already
have some tools in place to monitor query performance, explore what tools
may be available from the BI tool vendor, possibly for an additional cost.
Another thing that must be monitored is utilization of resources. As the use
of resources nears capacity, this can result in performance problems or the
inability to meet the system and/or user needs. There are many different places
where capacity must be monitored, including the ETL processing resources,
the database itself (data storage and query processing), application servers,
web servers, and sometimes simply the number of licenses for each different
product. Someone must be responsible for keeping an eye on each of these
different areas.
Business intelligence tools can be used to help you monitor your entire data
warehouse environment. This requires that you capture statistics about the data
warehouse itself. The ETL system can capture the number of rows processed,
the size of the data processed, the number (and type) of warnings and errors
encountered, and the time required to complete each step. Capture and store
database query statistics, including the number of users who log in and the
number of queries that are run. See what your BI tool can capture to help you
understand which reports are being used and which are not.
Using the statistics just described, you can create trend reports, and compare
actual results to targets. For example, you can compare total ETL processing
time to the load window that you have. If the time used is steadily creeping
toward the maximum time available, then you can investigate the situation to
determine what is causing the increased time. Is more data ﬂowing through
the system? Are you waiting for other systems to complete before you can
begin processing? You can perform an analysis to both ﬁgure out where to
look and determine what needs to be done to ensure completion in the allotted
timeframe.
In addition to comparing actual performance to targets or goals, you can also
track each of these measurements over time. Is there an increase or decrease
in the number of queries run against the data warehouse? If so, you can
investigate to ﬁgure out why. Is there an increase in the number of rows being
loaded each week? If so, you may need to adjust the schedule regarding the
purchase of additional disk space.
Leverage the capabilities of BI to help manage the business of building and
maintaining the data warehouse. As you have seen, there is more work to be
done than merely keeping the technology up to date with sufﬁcient capacity
to maintain acceptable service levels. There is additional work to maintain the
data warehouse itself.

380
Part V
■Next Steps—Expanding on Success
Maintaining the Data Warehouse
While it is important to keep your technology current, it is just as important
to ensure that the data warehouse itself is maintained. To simply keep the
environment running, the ETL system and the BI application require attention.
Maintaining the ETL System
The data loads must continue to run as planned, and each load must have
a quality assurance step to monitor the data’s accuracy. Most successful
data warehouses generate a need for more data, more reference data, and the
inclusion of more sources. Adding new data sources is usually done by creating
a new project and following the principles discussed throughout this book.
More time and energy are needed to maintain the data that you have already
started with. Once the ETL system is developed, it should not be moved into
production to simply run for the next ﬁve years. Changes and tweaks will
always be made to the underlying source systems. This can affect what ﬂows to
the ETL system. It may be small changes that have minimal impact, but some-
times signiﬁcant changes are required to the ETL processing. These changes are
often the result of modiﬁcations to the underlying source systems. Examples
of source system changes that impact the ETL system include the following:
Changes to how data elements are used. For example, if there is a change
to how pricing is performed, the data may be stored in all the same ﬁelds
as before, but the contents may now contain pricing tiers, rather than an
actual price.
Modiﬁcations to key identiﬁers, such as changing all of the customer IDs
The addition of new functionality that introduces new data. This is usually
done via a major enhancement to a system to add screens for additional
input or the development of new modules.
Expansion of reference data to enable new and improved values—for
example, adding more transaction types to be more speciﬁc about what
business transaction occurred.
Changes to the underlying systems are made both to correct problems and
to provide support for new features that are needed by the business. Because
the data warehouse often deals with multiple source systems, a steady stream
of changes is usually occurring to keep the existing ETL system working.
Communication with each of the source system development teams can help
ensure that the data warehouse is aware of the changes that are coming. Even
the most diligent and cooperative source system teams can forget about the
data warehouse at times. You need to be proactive with your communication
so that everybody has a good understanding of what they are working

Chapter 12
■Managing the Production Data Warehouse
381
on. Regular communication helps ensures that the source system application
development team continues to consider the impact of their own enhancements
and modiﬁcations on the data warehouse. While they do not need to limit what
they do because of potential impact on the data warehouse, they do need to
ensure that the data warehouse team is prepared to properly process any new
data when it begins to ﬂow from the source system. This can be accomplished
by having a representative from the data warehouse attend change review
meetings for the source systems or review the change/enhancement requests
that have been approved. This provides insight into what the source system
support team will be working on and enables the data warehouse team to
begin exploring the potential impact on the data warehouse itself.
Maintaining the BI Application
The BI application provides a starting point for business users. As these initial
reports and analyses are used, new ideas will be generated. Often these
enhancement requests are formally submitted, but usually new reports are
created directly by business users.
The beauty of a BI environment is that experienced users can indeed create
their own reports and analyses. This can be done from scratch or through
a series of modiﬁcations to existing reports, enabling them to morph into a
completely new report. It does not require anyone else to step in and do the
work for them.
However, such reports may not follow the standards developed for BI
development and they may not run efﬁciently. They may meet the business
need, however, and if a report is useful enough, it may be shared with
colleagues for their use too. Nonetheless, rather than have a poorly performing
report distributed throughout the business community, it is better for the
author of the report to submit it to a central BI support team for a formal
release. The BI support team may be a group of highly experienced business
analysts within the business community. This support team can ensure that
proper formatting and other standards are applied. Quality checks can be
done to ensure the accuracy of calculations. Finally, the efﬁciency of the report
can also be reviewed. Usually, in a short time frame the new report can be
released into the BI environment as a new analysis in the library of reports. If
the new analysis is valuable enough, it may even be included on a dashboard
or other BI portal for general access. As more people gain experience, they can
be taught how to prepare these reports or analyses for distribution.
The important thing is to provide a mechanism for new reports and analyses
to be distributed to the rest of the business community. In addition, keep in
mind that not every report or analysis must go through this process, just those
that are to be included as part of the ofﬁcial BI application. Many reports will
be created for personal use that do not need to be shared.

382

■Next Steps—Expanding on Success
Tracking Questions and Problems
When the data warehouse and BI solution is released for use, there must be a
mechanism in place to collect and track questions, issues, and problems. This
same mechanism may also be used to submit and track enhancement requests.
More information about handling enhancement requests can be found in
Chapter 13. The organization may already have a system in place to track
problems. This is often used by the help desk. This application may be able
to log and help track data warehouse and BI issues too. The data warehouse
support staff needs access to and training for using the problem-tracking
application.
While a full-ﬂedged problem-tracking system can provide many features, a
simple spreadsheet can also be used to log and track issues. The most important
point is that these be documented in a single location so that all issues relating
to the data warehouse environment are identiﬁed and monitored.
All feedback should be logged. This helps to understand how the support
team is spending their time. Feedback could be a question regarding how to
use the data warehouse or what the data means. Problems that are reported
could include the data warehouse not working at all, reporting an error in the
data, or a malfunction in getting the BI application to run. Sometimes feedback
is a request for something, such as a new business measure, another report, or
a new data element. The actions resulting from these requests will vary, but a
common set of information should be tracked for all feedback, including the
following:
A unique tracking number
Name and contact information for the person reporting the problem or
requesting the enhancement
The group for which this person works (sales, marketing, IT)
Date the problem is identiﬁed
The request type (bug, enhancement request)
A brief description of the problem
Severity of the problem (e.g., the system is down, important but can get
by in the meantime, nice to have, critical enhancement)
Part of the data warehouse/BI environment is involved (data, BI calcu-
lation, report, query performance, ETL system rules)—This may not be
known at ﬁrst, but when it is ﬁgured out, note it.
The status of this issue (e.g., open, resolved, solution scheduled for release
in the second quarter of next year)
Date the problem is resolved

Chapter 12
■Managing the Production Data Warehouse
383
Details about resolution of the problem—The question may have been
answered or a technical glitch was ﬁxed. Sometimes, resolution may be
the generation of a bug ﬁx request or enhancement request in order to
start the process of addressing this issue.
Once the feedback has been logged, the support team should work toward
a resolution. In many cases, questions can be immediately answered and
problems can be resolved. Sometimes additional resources are needed to help
identify the source of the problem and determine what to do about it. In some
cases, IT and/or business management should be informed of an open prob-
lem. For example, if the entire data warehouse database is down, all IT and
business managers involved should be informed.
A series of guidelines and procedures should be developed to lay out
problem escalation paths. These are typically deﬁned by the severity of the
problem and how much time has passed since the problem was reported and
what type of service levels have been agreed to. These guidelines may also
include steps to take when service levels for the data warehouse have been
compromised. This is not unique to a data warehouse. Most organizations
already have guidelines and procedures in place for other systems that can
serve as a starting point and can be adapted for the data warehouse.
Guidelines and procedures should include instruction for ongoing com-
munication regarding open problems or issues. The problem-tracking system
may have an inquiry feature whereby anyone can see the status of reported
problems. However, if a problem has been reported but is still unresolved,
then proactive communication is appropriate. An e-mail should be sent to the
requestor so that he or she knows that the support team is aware that there is
still an open problem. When possible, it is important to be speciﬁc about the
status of open problems. If someone is actively working on the problem but
hasn’t ﬁgured it out yet, say so. If the problem won’t even be looked at until
the end of next week, then communicate that too. Once a decision has been
made, the plan to address a problem or request should be communicated.
Sometimes a correction is made and put into production overnight.
More often, however, the solution to a problem will be bundled with other
features to be released at some point in the future. The timing and rationale
is often the result of joint IT and business prioritization, as discussed in the
next chapter. If the work to address the request is signiﬁcant enough, it may
be put into the pool of other requests that will go through a larger planning
process, as discussed in the section ‘‘Planning for Expansion and Growth’’ in
Chapter 13.
As decisions are made, it is important to ensure completion of the
problem-solution loop. The original requestor must be informed. If he or she
is not satisﬁed with the decision, then any outstanding concerns can be raised

384
Part V
■Next Steps—Expanding on Success
with management and/or the data warehouse decision makers, such as the
executive steering committee or the DW business support group.
N O T E
If no one is asking questions or requesting enhancements, then it is
unlikely that anyone is using the data warehouse! Usually a few questions will
arise even if the data warehouse is simply a new place to get the same reports.
Even more questions will be asked if the data warehouse is being used to think
outside the box to better leverage data.
The problem-tracking system can also be used to help quantify how the data
warehouse team is spending its time. It can be useful to see over time the
number of items reported, the number of items resolved, and the average time
to resolve issues. These can also be sorted by other attributes that are collected
by the problem-tracking system, including the department or the severity of
the problem.
Fixing Bugs
There will always be some problems that need to be addressed. Identiﬁcation
of problems is accomplished using the tracking mechanism described in the
previous section. Sometimes these problems can be addressed immediately.
Sometimes the resolution of a problem requires changes to the ETL system or
BI application. As with any other system, these modiﬁcation need to follow
an organized progression of steps, including development of the solution,
testing, and then promoting the revised program or process into the production
environment.
Many bug ﬁxes can be handled by the data warehouse support team
without any additional direction or prioritization. Usually, there is a threshold
number of hours of effort that the DW support team is empowered to handle
directly. Modiﬁcations that require more effort hours should be included in
the planning process for expansion and growth, as long as the problem is
not severe. If a bug ﬁx is needed to keep the data warehouse running, then
this must be addressed as soon as possible, even if the solution requires a
signiﬁcant effort.
When the Data Warehouse Falls Short
As mentioned previously, many organizations have invested in data ware-
house environment but have never realized any value or have seen a slowdown
in the value. Many other data warehouses have stalled. This can happen when
launching it initially, or after ﬁve years. Sometimes it is difﬁcult to remember
why it was built in the ﬁrst place. Regardless of how you got here, you are

Chapter 12
■Managing the Production Data Warehouse
385
not alone. Don’t be afraid to admit that everything is not going as planned.
Once you understand why things have stalled, you can take speciﬁc steps to
get started again.
Common Causes for a Stalled Warehouse
Over the years, patterns have emerged which have resulted in industry-best
practices. Sometimes the patterns that emerge help identify what can go
wrong. There are several common causes for a data warehouse that has
stalled, including the following:
Lack of business focus: The data warehouse may have been built without
direct input and partnering with the business. This is the root cause of
many data warehouses that are not used or have limited adoption in the
business community. In this case, the data warehouse usually represents
a collection of well-organized data. It often doesn’t have any connection
to solving any business issues or supporting business units.
Recommendation: Work with representatives from the business audience
to understand their requirements. Compare the data that you already
have with these requirements. Perhaps minor enhancements to the data
and the development of a few reports are needed. Adding training may
breathe new life into the data warehouse. Unfortunately, sometimes the
data as loaded cannot really help at all. If this is true, then study what
is needed. Take the techniques and methods learned and apply them to
starting over with a strong business focus this time.
Unstable technical platform: If the products that have been selected
are not installed and conﬁgured properly, then they will not work as
advertised. Sometimes products don’t work at all. In other cases, the
products have sporadic problems. Either way, if the technology is not
reliable, then no one will depend on the data warehouse to help them run
their part of the business.
Recommendation: Stabilize the technology. Ensure that the development
team and the business users have a sound, reliable environment to use.
Take the time to pinpoint any problems. Upgrade the hardware, ﬁx the
conﬁguration, and ensure that you are running the most current releases
of the software. Approach the vendors with an open attitude. Explore the
recommended conﬁgurations, rather than demand making your current
setup work. Vendors are often hesitant to say that what you have will
not work. They will try to develop many work-arounds to meet your
demands. Make the environment the best that you can to exploit the
products you have selected.

386
Part V
■Next Steps—Expanding on Success
Lack of reports and/or BI applications: The notion that ‘‘if you build
it, they will come’’ has been proven wrong, again and again, by many
different organizations. Just loading data into a database is not enough
to launch a successful data warehouse—even if the data structures are
perfect! The real value is obtained when people use the data. Most
business people have no desire to crawl through the data and craft new
reports from scratch. They want to look at snapshots of their business
but have the capability to look into more detail if necessary. This type of
use is best supported through the design and development of a series of
report templates in combination with structured navigation.
Recommendation: Work with key business analysts to identify useful report
templates. Invest the time to build a starter set of reports, and invest in the
development of the interface to help the business users navigate through
all that is available to ﬁnd what is most useful for them. This may require
the development of a BI portal or creation of a dashboard. Chapter 11
describes these in more detail.
Insufﬁcient data: Not having the data necessary to support the business
is one of the biggest challenges to success. Insufﬁcient data takes several
different forms. There may be some important data that is missing. The
data that is loaded may not be at a low enough level of detail to be
useful. Finally, there may be serious data quality problems. Data-related
issues do not go away without speciﬁc actions and they can stall a data
warehouse for years.
Recommendation: It is critical to get to the bottom of any real or perceived
data quality problems. Once they are identiﬁed and ﬁxed, additional
education must be provided to help the business users understand what
the data represents and why it is accurate, even if it is different from
what they are used to. When data is missing, either new data or more
detail, additional projects must be scoped out to expand the ETL system
to load the required data. Keep in mind that once the data is loaded, BI
applications and reports must also be developed to push the new data
out into the business community.
Personnel challenges: Making sure the right people from IT and the
business community are involved in the data warehouse can be difﬁcult.
Sometimes people are assigned to a data warehouse project because they
had time available. Others are assigned because they bring a special skill
or have expressed interest in data warehousing. In other cases, people
simply do not have the skills needed to work effectively on the data
warehouse. Even with the proper education and given time to adapt,
some people just ﬁght DW industry best practices and cause trouble

Chapter 12
■Managing the Production Data Warehouse
387
every step of the way. This can be true for project team members as well
as business analysts being asked to use the data warehouse.
Recommendation: There are two different areas in which personnel issues
can impede progress. First, the project team itself can face challenges.
In defense of these opinionated employees, they are simply ﬁghting for
what they believe is right. However, if there is a major difference between
a personal opinion and the organization’s strategy that continues to be
a problem, then that person should be reassigned to a different project.
Often these are people with a lot of experience and skills that are valuable
to the organization. There is simply a mismatch between their skills and
what is needed for the data warehouse. In some cases, it may be better
to leave a position empty than to ﬁll it with someone who is not able to
contribute effectively.
Second, the business community may face personnel challenges when
implementing a data warehouse. Many people learn to do what is nec-
essary to complete the set of tasks to produce reports, but they don’t
have time to perform further analysis. Over time, these roles do not have
analytical and decision-making responsibilities. The people who ﬁll these
roles may not have the skills and background needed to perform more
sophisticated analyses. Even with additional education, they may not be
able to meet the demands of the data warehouse. These people may serve
a vital function to develop BI applications, perform quality assurance
tests, or assist with other support roles. Identify someone else in the
organization to ﬁll the role of true business analyst.
The wrong tools: In some cases, the products and technologies that were
selected years ago may have outlived their usefulness. Perhaps they
never were a good ﬁt. Take the time to assess how well your current
products are meeting your needs. Acknowledge what is working well
and identify any major problem areas. This will help you assess the
viability of different technologies. You certainly do not want to disrupt
what is already working well.
Recommendation: Take a quick survey of the marketplace. The landscape
of possible tools changes signiﬁcantly every few years If you have a
product, such as your ETL tool, that is serving its purpose well, don’t
spend a lot of time exploring the marketplace. It can be worth taking a
look, however, if you have a need that is not being met.
Lack of business use: There may have been sound requirements collected
and great work done to prepare and load the data. Even after reports have
been created, however, until someone starts to use them, you will not see
any value. Sometimes the current way to do business is so ingrained that
there is no impetus to begin using the data warehouse. When things are

388
Part V
■Next Steps—Expanding on Success
working adequately, many individuals have little or no incentive to do
their work differently.
Recommendation: Trying to change how things are done is very difﬁcult
and takes time. Communicating that the data warehouse is now available
for use may not be enough to get people to try it. There must be a
concerted effort on the part of business management to encourage use of
the data warehouse. Sometimes providing the business reason to use the
warehouse is all that is necessary. Making additional education available
can also help. Teach people what the data means and how to use it for
their daily work. Rewarding use of the data warehouse can provide the
incentive needed to help people get started. Encourage creativity and
empower employees to develop new ways to get their work done. While
it does take some time for this to happen, it can be extremely beneﬁcial
for change to grow from within the organization. That way, people make
changes to help them work smarter, not just harder.
Many additional things can go wrong that are not mentioned here. These
are just the most common causes for a data warehouse effort to fall short.
Typically, it is not a single factor that affects success or failure, but rather a
combination of multiple things. Even when a project attempts to do all the
right things, success is not guaranteed. The important thing is to acknowledge
that there is a problem, try to identify the source of the problem, and then
make a conscious effort to change.
Jump-Starting a Stalled Data Warehouse
Just because the data warehouse has fallen short, it does not mean that
everything must be scrapped. As discussed earlier, many different factors can
contribute to a stalled data warehouse. The real question is what will be done
about it. Before you can decide that, you need a realistic assessment of the
situation.
Conducting an Assessment
The causes and recommendations described in the previous section can help
you to diagnose some of the most common problems. Clearly, getting a good
understanding of the root causes that are impeding your data warehouse
process is a good ﬁrst step. This can be done through an assessment process.
Part of this is performing an audit to understand what is in place. In addition,
you need to evaluate what is working and what is not. Then, recommendations
should be developed to address any problems that have been identiﬁed.
An assessment is best done by someone who is not too close to the project.
This enables the independent party to be more objective. This person may

Chapter 12
■Managing the Production Data Warehouse
389
be found internally, but external consultants are often needed, especially to
develop recommendations to move forward.
Whether internal or external people do the assessment, it is important to
listen to these individuals. Take the time to listen to the observations, concerns,
and ideas from several different perspectives. Speak with representatives from
the project team, the target business audience, IT managers, business managers,
and senior management.
The purpose is to assess what they think is working and what is not. Be
prepared for a wide range of reactions, including frustration, anger, confusion,
hope, and sometimes complete lack of awareness. Understanding how each
different group perceives the data warehouse can help you develop useful
strategies for moving forward. For example, it serves no purpose to send an
e-mail announcing new BI features to a group of users who never even look at
the BI application.
Each of these groups can also provide great ideas about what needs to be
done to improve the data warehouse environment. Many are feasible, but some
may not be possible in the near term. Expectations need to be set regarding
what may be possible. These discussions begin to build a communication
channel that can be used to gather and clarify requirements and build interest
in using improved data warehouse/BI capabilities. Use this channel to loop
back and share strategies and plans as they are developed. Keeping everyone
informed is a major step forward toward building a more successful data
warehouse.
N O T E If you are having trouble ﬁguring out what is and isn’t working, hire an
independent third-party to come in and perform an assessment. This is usually
worth the cost. Third parties can make immediate suggestions for improvement
and help you identify the major steps required to move forward.
Part of what is learned through an assessment is what is working today.
This can help determine what should continue to be used.
Determining What Can Be Salvaged
Rather than simply toss everything out to start from scratch, you need to assess
what components are viable. There are often things that have already been built
that should continue to be used. For example, consider a situation in which a
third normal form data warehouse was to be built without any dimensional
data marts and is not being used. This is not the proper implementation for
the top-down architecture. The third normal form data warehouse may be just
ﬁne, and building dimensional data marts or views would be a recommended
next step.

390
Part V
■Next Steps—Expanding on Success
At the opposite end of the spectrum, perhaps chaos has taken over. There are
dozens of non-integrating dimensional data marts all over the organization.
Here again, this is not recommended by the bottom-up architecture. This may
require a coordinated and disciplined effort to begin to bring these together
in a thoughtful and integrated manner. Many of the ETL processes developed
for each individual data mart can still be used and enhanced to ﬁt into this
new integrated environment. This reuse can leverage IT resources and provide
integrated data to the business.
However, there are still times when the effort to ﬁx and maintain the existing
components, such as the ETL processes or reports, is greater than starting over.
This cost must take into account any effort to enhance existing capabilities
and maintain them over time. If this cost is too high, then make sure that you
take the lessons learned (about what worked well and what did not) forward.
Knowing what can still be utilized, and what cannot, is vital input to creating
an action plan.
Developing a Plan to Move On
To a large extent, getting a data warehouse moving again is much like setting
up a new project. It includes work to scope out the effort, and deﬁne the
goals and what needs to be built. Many organizations are good at this type
of work and can assess the current state and craft a project to get things
moving. Clearly, speciﬁc plans must be developed to correct and/or rebuild
the technical components of the data warehouse. This must be done with
an eye toward delivering business value, which requires a close partner-
ship between the business and IT. This is the opportunity to do things the
right way.
Part of scoping out the work to get the data warehouse moving again is
getting funding. This can be challenging because the last investment did not
pan out. This is why having a clear understanding of what contributed to the
shortfall of the previous data warehouse initiatives is critical. The proposal for
a new data warehouse project should spell out each of the primary challenges
on previous projects, with an associated action plan to mitigate the risk. This
book should provide insight into what works and help you to craft a new
project that will be successful.
Because this is not the ﬁrst project, planning and doing the work is not
enough. You must include a series of tasks and activities that are focused on
addressing cultural and organizational challenges. At a minimum, this must
include sales and marketing efforts for the data warehouse and BI solution(s).
Concerted efforts need to focus on how the data warehouse can become an
active part of supporting the day-to-day business.
It is much harder the second or third time around to get support and build
momentum for a data warehouse. People are tired of participating and not

seeing any beneﬁt. You will likely encounter a great deal of doubt and cynicism
about data warehousing, and there is often a pervasive attitude that it will
never work and is a waste of time.
To turn things around, get back to basics and the fundamentals for suc-
cessful data warehousing. Use what you learned from this book. Tap into
the knowledge and experience of people who have been involved with the
organization’s data warehousing efforts over the years. After several years of
valiant effort, sometime the best data warehouse resources get so frustrated
that they move on to contribute in other ways. Seek them out to get their ideas.
Some steps that can have a big impact include the following:
Get a visible, long-term commitment to data warehousing from senior
management.
Senior management must work with middle managers to set the data
warehouse as a priority. Middle managers must then allocate the neces-
sary business resources to work on data warehouse projects—and then
stick to this commitment. Do not steal their time back.
The project team can get input from external data warehousing resources
by reading and attending courses and conferences. Bring consultants on
board to design and build the data warehouse and/or BI applications.
Use external resources for reviews and mentoring.
Empower all participants to speak up! Create an environment in which
people are encouraged and rewarded for brining issues and concerns to
the attention of project managers and IT or business management.
The project team must be encouraged to take the time to address concerns
raised within the team or issues brought up elsewhere in the organization.
If something is not working, then stop spinning, ﬁgure out what needs to
be done, and then do it!
While these are important, the single most important thing that can be done
is to link any data warehouse initiatives to real business requirements.
N O T E Even projects trying to adopt all the best practices can end up with a
stalled data warehouse. An honest assessment of the situation usually yields
several contributing factors. This entire book is dedicated to helping executives
and business and IT managers understand what building a DW really entails. This
understanding can help all future DW initiatives to identify potential roadblocks
and take proactive steps to avoid them.
Aligning DW Objectives with Business Goals
The only way to align the data warehouse with business goals is to know
what those business goals are and to have an understanding of what a data

392
Part V
■Next Steps—Expanding on Success
warehouse can do. Representatives from the business must work with lead
data warehouse and BI team members to ﬁgure this out. Each individual
division of an organization will have its own objectives and goals. There will
also be objectives that span all of the divisions. What is the strategic direction of
the company? What are the biggest challenges facing the entire organization?
As new business strategies and objectives are developed, take a look at
how the data warehouse can continue to support these goals. This is similar
to the type of work that is done to justify a data warehouse project in the
ﬁrst place. This may have happened years ago. It is worthwhile to go back
to ﬁnd the original rationale. Often, many of the same overarching issues are
still facing the organization. New challenges may have cropped up due to
market pressures, regulatory changes, or advancements in technology needed
to run the business, such as manufacturing technology.
The data warehouse manager and steering committee need to understand
the organization’s strategic objectives so that they can prioritize all data
warehouse work to support those objectives. This makes it easier to decide
the order in which the work will be done. It also makes explaining the
data warehouse priorities much easier. The more closely aligned the data
warehouse is to the overall corporate strategies, the better the likelihood of
retaining funding for maintenance and expansion.
Getting It Right This Time
As you’ve already seen, while many data warehouse projects try to use best
practices, the project may still fall short. Subsequent projects should tap into
the experiences of any previous data warehouse projects. Project teams often
have insight into what could have been done differently. It is hoped that
these ideas were captured during the post-implementation project review.
If not, seek out the team members to get their perspective on the previous
project. If there is a lack of conﬁdence in the current staff, then external help is
needed. This may entail hiring experienced data warehouse staff or bringing in
consultants to design and build the data warehouse. In addition to correcting
known problems, the new project should also do the following:
Communicate regularly to a wide variety of audiences across IT and the
business community.
Openly acknowledge problems of the past.
Assure everyone that steps are being taken to address these problems.
Ensure that communication works both ways. Share what is happening
and then listen.
Implement sound data governance to deﬁne the data. Then, develop and
publish useful documentation, including what each data element means

Chapter 12

in business terms, a description of each report, and what to do when
problems occur.
Create new business processes that leverage the new data warehouse
environment.
Overall, it is important to articulate what was different on this project—that
is, why this will work when other attempts have failed. Be sure to include
management’s commitment, the participation of business representatives
throughout, and the adoption of industry best practices. Include speciﬁc
details that highlight how the new environment is targeted at the business.
These beneﬁts are best identiﬁed and communicated by the business represen-
tatives on the project team. Leverage what has been learned from this book.
Seek out additional resources for speciﬁc areas that need attention. Get a more
detailed understanding of areas in which the organization is weak.
Everyone, including executives, managers, and developers, can contribute
more effectively by learning more about their immediate data warehouse
responsibilities and having an understanding of what else is involved in
designing, building, and using a data warehouse. Use the lessons learned and
the experience of the new project team to build a better data warehouse. After
development of the improved data warehouse and BI application is complete,
additional attention must be placed on releasing these for use.
Launching the Improved Data Warehouse
and BI Solution
When an organization has already attempted to launch a data warehouse,
there is likely to be more resistance with subsequent launch efforts. People
will be skeptical about what the data warehouse will be able to do for them.
Several important things need to be considered when getting ready to release
the new and improved data warehouse environment. Because there have been
other launches, it is important to take the time to do this right. These are the
same principles that apply to any launch, but there should be no shortcuts this
time. To recap these important steps:
Ensure that the environment is ready to be released. Test everything: data
accuracy, load performance, query performance, usefulness of reports
and analyses, and the interface to the BI application. Everything has to be
working well before you actually launch the data warehouse.
Consider a dress rehearsal. Select a small group of helpful business users
and go through all the steps of your planned release. This ‘‘beta test’’ can
identify items that need more attention and help the team to develop a
smooth release plan.

394
Part V
■Next Steps—Expanding on Success
Develop and conduct training about the data and how to use it for
analysis, and help the business people learn how the reports/analyses
can help them do their daily work.
Create a visible and public launch of the new and improved data ware-
house. Make a big deal about it. Even if you are not in the marketing
department, you can usually ﬁnd several people who are great party
planners. Tap into those skills to pull together a great celebration. Order a
cake, decorate the conference room and the business areas with balloons,
and have a ribbon-cutting ceremony. Pass out pencils with the data ware-
house support number printed on them. Invite the target business users
and everyone on the project team. This is truly a time to let everyone
know that things have changed. Be proud of the work that has been done.
Celebrate the progress made to date and get ready for success!
The business needs to provide a lot of proactive, visible support, especially
from upper management. Include key managers in launch meetings to
share their expectations that the data warehouse environment will be used
to help the company meet its goals. If this isn’t possible in person, it can
be shared via a memo or e-mail message.
While the launch should be carefully orchestrated, this is really just the
beginning. Now follow-through is needed to ensure that the data warehouse
is used and that business value is achieved. With the launch of the improved
data warehouse, the project team should loop back to the steps outlined in the
beginning of this chapter to ﬁnish the project and encourage use of the data
warehouse.
In Real Life
While the two companies we have been following are at opposite ends of the
spectrum from a size perspective, both have many complexities to deal with.
Let’s see what challenges they are facing.
Lack of Support for the Production DW at Giant Co.
Giant Company has been diligent about following their project management
methodology. Resources are assigned based upon these project needs. Unfor-
tunately, no one paid much attention to supporting the data warehouse once
the project was complete. Sufﬁcient funding was not secured and a single ETL
developer was assigned the responsibility to keep things running. Problems
were channeled through the standard help desk. Unfortunately, this left many
areas open for problems. The help desk was not educated or prepared to deal

Chapter 12
■Managing the Production Data Warehouse
395
with the kinds of questions that began to come in about the data warehouse.
Many of the questions regarding data meaning, accuracy of calculations on
reports, and how to use the BI interface could not be answered by the remaining
ETL developer.
Complaints began to ﬂow in through the help desk and management
channels. The data warehouse, including the BI application, was really geared
toward helping the business. The business champion stepped up to work
with IT and business managers to determine what to do. They proposed
setting up a data warehouse center of excellence. This included the staff to
effectively maintain the data warehouse and provide appropriate support
for the business community. The executive steering committee approved the
requested funding. Once these resources were put in place, they were able to
set up the procedures and processes needed to help the business leverage its
investment in the data warehouse.
Unleashing BI at Agile, Inc.
The business users at Agile, Inc., were happy with the starter set of reports
that were developed on their behalf. In order to encourage a lot of use, all
of the users were given the authority to create their own calculations and
publish reports for general use. Many of the business users grabbed this
new opportunity to start creating their own reports and analyses. Dozens of
reports and calculations were added. The users who were not interested in
building their own analyses quickly learned to look through the published
list of available reports to ﬁnd things to try. Unfortunately, many of the
old problems began to emerge. Too much time was spent in management
meetings debating which numbers were correct. This was frustrating for
everyone. Business managers decided to put a stop to this and ﬁgure out why
the data warehouse had not ﬁxed this fundamental problem.
A core team was brought together to study what was happening. The team
included a data modeler, an ETL developer, a BI application developer, and
a project manager. After a quick review, it was apparent that not all of the
calculations that had been added were correct. Further review of the reports
showed inconsistencies too. The permission allowing everyone to tinker with
the BI environment was revoked. A high-level understanding of the data and
how to use the BI tool was set as the minimum in order to be granted privileges
to add to the BI environment.
The education offerings were aligned with these skills to provide a path for
people to follow to improve their skills. A review process was also set up so
that all new additions, reports, or calculations were reviewed on a weekly basis
by core BI application developers, who served a quality control function. Some
time was spent cleaning up the calculations and reports that had gotten out of
control, and the new policies kept the situation from getting out of hand again.

Summary
A great deal of time and energy are put into designing and building a data
warehouse. Now that the construction has been completed, the fun really
begins. This chapter provided practical suggestions for launching the data
warehouse and getting the business community to embrace its use. It takes
time to effect real change, and the data warehouse can be a useful tool to
help an organization improve how business is conducted, which beneﬁts the
bottom line.
The work for a data warehouse is never really done. Once the project ends,
ongoing support and maintenance activities begin. The technology, the ETL
system, and the BI application need to be kept current and running efﬁciently.
Many data warehouses have already been built and are in production;
some are successful and some are not. This chapter presented common causes
for a stalled warehouse and provided practical recommendations for moving
it forward. Now it is time to look toward the future. Chapter 13 covers
planning for expansion and growth, how to deal with challenges across a large
enterprise, what’s next for data warehousing, and how to measure success.

C H A P T E R

Achieving Long-Term
Success
The data warehouse project has been completed and appropriate measures
have been taken to maintain it. Now the business should be getting used to
using the data warehouse and learning how to make it work for them. This is
not the end, but really the beginning. This chapter looks to the future so that
proper planning can be done to support expansion and growth of the data
warehouse. Several ideas are offered to help manage data warehouse resources
across a large enterprise. After a quick look at the future of data warehousing,
the chapter ends by highlighting techniques to measure business value and
sustain success.
Planning for Expansion and Growth
Use of the data warehouse environment will generate new requirements, and
problems will need to be ﬁxed as part of maintaining it. The data warehouse
support team may be able to accommodate some minor enhancements. Beyond
this basic support, enhancement requests and new requirements will need to
be addressed.
Periodically, these requests must be reviewed and evaluated. This can be
done as part of a scheduled planning process. These requests may be bundled
into releases. Each release should be handled as a separate project to ensure
the coordination of sound design and development, complete testing, quality
assurance, documentation, and associated education.
This planning is typically done annually in order to ensure appropriate
funding for the upcoming year. In addition to maintenance releases, brand-new
projects may be deﬁned to tackle the work of adding new data sources or
supporting completely different business groups. In preparation for planning,
the requests for changes and/or additions to the data warehouse need to be
identiﬁed.
397

398
Part V
■Next Steps—Expanding on Success
Exploring Expansion Opportunities
Usually, you can do many different things to enhance the data warehouse. A
concerted effort must be put forth to collect the many requests and ideas. This
work is often spearheaded by the data warehouse manager but carried out in
collaboration with managers, business analysts, and/or members of the data
warehouse support team. These requirements can be identiﬁed in a variety
of ways:
Review feedback captured by the problem-tracking system that was
discussed in Chapter 12.
Send an e-mail survey to current data warehouse users to ask what
else they would like to see or be able to do.
Schedule brief requirements review meetings with representatives from
each of the major areas, using the data warehouse to gather and/or
conﬁrm their high-level requirements.
Go back to the requirements gathering documentation to see what other
business areas and opportunities were identiﬁed. Clarify with the busi-
ness community which requirements are still relevant.
Ask the DW business support team for their input (although they may be
the ones performing this work).
This is not a full requirements gathering process, but rather a variety of
ways to examine what the next data warehouse project(s) should tackle. If the
total number of items needing attention is too great, then the business and IT
managers must do some initial prioritization to reduce to number of requests
to a manageable size.
For the requirements that are under consideration, additional research may
be required to ensure that the real objective or requirement is understood, and
to ﬁgure out what work is needed to design and develop a solution to meet this
need. For each request, the ﬁndings need to be documented. This can be brief,
but it should still be written down. Details that need to be documented include:
a description of the request; the reason or business purpose; a description of
the technical problem or challenge that needs to be addressed; an estimate
of the magnitude of effort (large, medium, small); identiﬁcation of the impact of
this change on all areas of the data warehouse environment, including the ETL
system, dimensional structures, and the BI data delivery layer. The business
impact of the request should be captured when possible. This includes the
beneﬁt of making the change and the risk of not addressing the request.
The research for enhancements to the data warehouse may be done as the
requests come in, rather than waiting for the next planning cycle. The collection
of documented requests is used to help set the order in which they will be
implemented.

Chapter 13
■Achieving Long-Term Success
399
Prioritization of Feedback
After each individual request has been explored, the requests need to be
examined as a whole. The goal is to determine how to best group the requests
to provide the most beneﬁt with the least amount of effort and/or rework.
For example, instead of having four releases next year that all work on the
product dimension, consider combining all of the product dimension requests
into a single release. That way, the product dimension and the ETL processes
to build and maintain it will be worked on only once.
Look at the combinations of requests in several different ways. Combine
everything needed by department. Look at all of the requests that only require
BI application changes. Group the requests by the business impact or return
on investment. Group the requests based upon source system data that is
involved. While representatives from the data warehouse support team can
study the requests, it is also important to get input from different business
groups too.
N O T E It is not recommended to put together technical-only releases. Resources
will be consumed for some time to work on the release and when the results are
unveiled, the solution will deliver exactly what the business had before. Look for
ways to bundle technical foundation work with value-added enhancements.
To help the decision-making process, it is important to tie the releases to
the potential business value. Each of these alternatives deﬁnes a new project,
which needs a project charter as described in Chapter 5. Some organizations
require a project charter to be developed for each alternative being considered.
Other organizations prefer to examine the different alternatives and then
require the project charter for the alternative(s) that have been selected.
Ultimately, a combined group of IT and business representatives must
develop recommendations for what each release should contain. These rec-
ommendations and all new projects can then be presented to the executive
steering committee for approval. Several alternatives may be developed and
presented. The pros and cons for each can be discussed, and the steering
committee can make an informed decision about which alternative to pursue.
Once the decisions are made, the direction can be communicated to the
rest of the organization. If anyone is not satisﬁed with the direction, then
their concerns can be raised through their management chain, either IT or
business. This is when each representative on the steering committee can help
by communicating the options and the business rationale for the decisions.
This helps ensure that everyone understands (even if they don’t agree) that the
business is driving the content and priorities for the data warehouse, rather
than IT setting these priorities.

RUNNING ON EMPTY
There are only so many hours in a day. Depending upon what needs to be done,
the total number of resources available to work on data warehousing can easily
be exhausted—‘‘exhausted’’ as in you can run out of time and each of the
individuals can be fatigued. The more skilled the project teams becomes, the
more is expected of them. Sometimes you can push everyone to work a little
harder to get a speciﬁc deliverable ﬁnished, but you cannot expect people to
give that extra effort with no end in sight. Ensure that sufﬁcient resources, both
IT and business personnel, are allocated to maintain the data warehouse. Keep
an eye on the balance of new project resource needs and the available
personnel—again, both IT and business. If you are falling short, you must add
more resources or reduce the work.
The result of the prioritization process is a new set of projects that need to
follow the standard project planning procedures. Now that you have identiﬁed
what projects will be started to expand and grow the data warehouse, it is
worth taking some time to look at leveraging skilled data warehouse staff
members across the organization.
Managing Enterprise DW Resources
Many organizations ﬁnd that putting together a project team and setting
up ongoing support is sufﬁcient. There is clear coordination from project to
project because the same people are involved in all the work. If you work for a
large enterprise, however, this is not the case. The stafﬁng and management of
people across the organization is signiﬁcantly different. Often, people and their
skill sets are listed in a human resources database. When forming a project
team, this database is used to locate the people needed to ﬁll the different
roles. This is based on both who has the background or base skills and who is
available at the right time.
This creates a much higher level of complexity to ensure consistency across
the data warehouse environment. It is not unusual to have a project team
of 10–15 people. If eight projects are under way across the enterprise, then
you may have 80–120 people working in the data warehouse environment.
Additional strategies are needed to leverage data warehouse knowledge and
techniques. Some sort of centralization of data warehousing resources is
needed.
Creating an Enterprise Data Warehouse Team
A single centralized team of data warehousing professionals can be formed.
This is a collection of the most experienced people from across the organization.
It may also be called a center of excellence for data warehousing. Their jobs

Chapter 13
■Achieving Long-Term Success
401
include the responsibility to advocate, implement, and help others work
toward enterprise data warehousing goals. There are several different ways
that this can be handled organizationally. This section shares two examples.
The Centralized Enterprise Data Warehouse Team
With this structure, the enterprise data warehouse personnel report directly to
an enterprise group. While the staff members belong to the enterprise team,
each person is assigned to and works on speciﬁc data warehouse projects. This
ensures that they have a continued role in actively developing and delivering
value to the organization. It also enables each to leverage his or her experience
and mentor the project team while keeping an eye on what is best for the
overall data warehouse initiatives across the organization. Figure 13-1 shows
how the centralized data warehouse team is organized.

The Virtual Enterprise Data Warehouse Team
The virtual enterprise data warehouse team is similar in function to a central-
ized team but it is organized differently. The highly skilled data warehouse
staff members are full-time members of project teams and have the same man-
agement chain as all other project team members. These key data warehouse
people have dotted-line responsibility to the enterprise data warehouse team.
Highly skilled data warehouse resources are leveraged on each project. A por-
tion of their time must be allocated to enterprise data warehouse work. This
work must not be pushed aside. Figure 13-2 shows how the virtual enterprise
data warehouse team is organized.

Sometimes the concept of forming an enterprise team can take a wrong
turn. This can result in an ivory tower team. This happens when the enterprise
team does not have any actual project involvement. Their only work is
at a conceptual level for data warehousing across the organization. This is not
a recommended approach. This type of team tends to set up methods and
policies to which all projects should adhere, but they lose touch with what
is realistic. They become more of a burden and added expense, rather than
helping data warehouse initiatives become more successful.
Regardless of how the team is organized, there are common skills and
functions that this team can perform. The types of people who often are part
of the enterprise data warehouse team include the following:
Technical specialists who support the tools
Project managers
Data modelers or data architects
Lead ETL developers
Lead BI developers
Business analysts
Not all members of every data warehouse project should belong to the
enterprise data warehouse team, and each project should be staffed with
a variety of people. The enterprise DW team should be the best and most
experienced data warehouse personnel in the organization. They can lead,
mentor, and teach the rest of the individual project team members. This
also provides the opportunity for new people to begin to develop these

Chapter 13
■Achieving Long-Term Success
403
valuable skills. Over time, they may excel and become part of the enterprise
project team.
Enterprise DW Team Responsibilities
The enterprise data warehouse team serves as the central clearinghouse for
ideas, techniques, and solutions. They can facilitate communication through
e-mail, newsletters, and brieﬁngs. They can also coordinate interaction between
different groups across the enterprise. Following are the key responsibilities
of this team:
Dealing with technology: Problems can arise when installing software for
the ﬁrst time or upgrading to new releases. Centralized resources can help
resolve a problem once. If each project is independent, time and resources
are wasted trying to ﬁgure out the same problem. A centralized group
can also keep an eye on new technology as it emerges. This group can
also test new products that may help the organization. Volume discounts
may be possible by consolidating product purchases.
Adoption of industry best practices: There is value in keeping current
with what is happening in the data warehouse industry. Anyone involved
with data warehousing projects should have access to the proper ongoing
education needed to do their work. The central group can scan all of
the different publications and regularly attend industry conferences. This
group should also be responsible for helping to determine how these
industry practices can be adapted and used by the organization.
Developing internal best practices: Because each organization has its
own existing procedures for running projects, it is important to ensure
that these are ﬁne-tuned to better support data warehousing. This may
mean creating standards for what deliverables will look like from each
data warehouse project.
Leveraging business experience: As each business group learns to use
the data warehouse, the insight they gain can support their work. An
enterprise data warehouse team can be a focal point for sharing these
ideas. Sometimes the same report or analysis can beneﬁt other groups.
The team can share suggestions about how to encourage use of the data
warehouse or how to modify business processes to tap into it.
Providing a centralized location for a consolidated view of data ware-
housing across the enterprise: The enterprise data warehouse team can
compile information about each different data warehouse, as described
in Chapter 3. The team can be responsible for summarizing the different
initiatives that are in place, under way, or being planned.

404
Part V
■Next Steps—Expanding on Success
Each organization must determine what responsibilities are best suited to
their own enterprise data warehouse team. The team should provide a focal
point for channeling communication, fostering cooperation, and helping to
ensure that each data warehouse project is successful. However it is organized,
the team must be responsive, and avoid becoming a bottleneck.
Funding the Enterprise DW Team
Logically, it makes sense to gain economies of scale for technology and people,
but who will pay for this? The budget for a centralized team may seem
expensive at ﬁrst, but remember that you are already paying for this as part of
each and every project and existing standalone data warehouse. This seems to
be more when you add it all together, rather than have these costs embedded
in many different places.
Additional time is required for coordination and communication, but a cost
savings is realized by having skilled resources available so that each project
does not have to start from scratch (data architecture, selecting the technology,
etc.). You can also avoid costs by preventing projects from making choices that
will not work. Having a centralized data warehouse function will not prevent
all mistakes, but it can certainly help each project avoid the most common
errors and get things done sooner.
The real challenge is to determine a fair way to allocate the cost of these
central data warehouse resources across all the different groups. A variety of
funding models are used to pay for an enterprise data warehouse team. The ﬁrst
thing to understand is how other enterprise services are funded. If all database
administration resources are centralized today, are the services charged back
by hours worked or by size of the database? It can be straightforward to follow
an existing pattern. The enterprise DW team costs can be shared across all of
the groups who are using (directly or indirectly) the data warehouse. These
costs can be allocated by the number of users, the size of their data, the number
of queries that are run, or sometimes even by the size of the rest of their budget.
Another approach for funding the enterprise DW team is to charge for
services. Chargeback, or consulting, rates must be determined, typically based
upon the cost for an individual or perhaps as a blended cost of all of the team
members. The biggest risk with this approach is that use of these internal
consultants is often viewed as optional. These resources are either avoided
(due to the high internal chargeback associated with such highly skilled and
experienced employees) or their services are used only if the team is in big
trouble. Either way, the organization still incurs the cost of individual project
teams forging their own path.
Another common alternative is to automatically allocate the cost of the
enterprise DW team across all projects or groups who are involved in data
warehousing. This can be based upon the number of members on a project

Chapter 13
■Achieving Long-Term Success
405
team, the size of the data, or the number of users. This can help mitigate the
risk of projects not wanting assistance from the enterprise DW team. If a group
is already paying for the team, then there will be a higher level of interest in
using its services.
Pushing into the Future
Looking to the future is important to continue to push the data warehouse
forward to support the organization. The work on a data warehouse is never
done, but should become an integral part of how the company grows and
changes. The data warehousing industry itself continues to grow and change
too. There are advancements in technology and the emergence of new best
practices. This section serves as an introduction to some of these new areas that
are emerging and maturing at the time of this publication. It is not intended to
provide in-depth deﬁnitions and/or recommendations for implementation.
Embedded Business Intelligence
The concept of embedded business intelligence refers to use of the data warehouse
when it is embedded into other business workﬂow processes. This often is
done in a way that the business person or customer is not aware that the data
warehouse is part of the process. For example, a data warehouse can be used
to generate parts of a phone script to drive what questions are asked, and what
options or offers are presented to the customer. This can also be embedded
into other applications such as online ordering—for example, to suggest to a
customer ordering hiking boots that other customers who purchased hiking
boots also ordered sock liners and safari hats.
The reason that this differs from using the operational database itself for
the application is that this requires historical data, often from multiple sources
in the organization. The data warehouse is a logical source for this integrated
historical data. Several things need to be in place to enable this type of
operational business intelligence:
The data warehouse must be able to support these queries. It must contain
the data needed by the operational application and be able to provide an
acceptable level of query performance.
The operational system must be enhanced to tap into the data warehouse.
Appropriate business processes must be in place so that the business
community understands how to leverage the results that have been
embedded in their operational applications. For example, this may simply
be training about a new pop-up screen, such as how to use it and when it
can be ignored.

406
Part V
■Next Steps—Expanding on Success
Embedded business intelligence may also be implemented as a separate
step in a workﬂow, but not directly embedded into an operational application
system. For example, after the order scheduling process has ﬁnished, there
may be exceptions ﬂagged for further investigation. A dashboard or BI portal
may be used to check on these exceptions to help determine what action needs
to be taken. The key point here is that business intelligence is used as an
integral part of operational business processes and taps into historical data
from the data warehouse.
Operational Business Intelligence
For the purposes of this book, the term ‘‘business intelligence’’ has been used
to describe the delivery of data from the data warehouse to the appropriate
business audience. Operational business intelligence is quite different. Oper-
ational business intelligence changes the focus to address more immediate
business issues that deal with daily business operations. Operational BI is
used by frontline managers and customer-facing employees to measure and
monitor operational processes.
Typical business intelligence would help track and monitor claim payments,
the number of claims being handled, and the amount of time spent on the
phone, each compared to target values. It is often necessary to do this more
frequently than a weekly or daily claims report. This operational tracking is
needed to provide more immediate feedback of performance so that behavior
can change in real time. A bigger push can be made to complete sales or to
follow up on lingering claims to get to a ﬁnal resolution.
This operational performance could be displayed on a big screen that shows
the number of calls on hold and the number of calls handled so far on the
current shift. This information can then be reported by a team or an individual
claims handler. Some organizations prefer to publicly show results by team,
and then show each person’s results on his or her own individual screen.
Sometimes these measurements can be pulled directly from the operational
system. However, it may be necessary to include historical trending and data
from other systems that the operational system does not have. In this case, this
is more in line with the requirements for real-time data warehousing, which is
discussed in the next section.
When exploring operational BI, you need to consider a number of things,
which revolve around the data in the operational systems. The following char-
acteristics of data need to be evaluated to determine whether the operational
system can support the business need:
History
Does the historical data needed to support analysis already exist in the
operational database?

Chapter 13
■Achieving Long-Term Success
407
Does this history include both transactional data and reference data as
it existed at the time of that transaction?
Cleanliness
Is the data in the operational system clean enough for effective repor-
ting?
Are there duplicate entries for the same customer?
Performance
What are the performance characteristics of the current operational
system?
Will the additional workload to support reporting and analysis affect
the system’s efﬁciency?
What kind of query performance will the report and analytical requests
see?
Integration
How will data be integrated between different operational systems?
How many exceptions are there for these integration rules?
What, or how many, changes are needed to the underlying data to
support integration?
What is the impact of these changes on the functionality of the appli-
cation system itself?
As with any other BI application, you need to determine the business
requirements—that is, articulate what you are trying to accomplish. Then
potential solutions can be explored to address the business need.
Real-Time Data Warehousing
Many companies have an increasing interest in real-time data warehousing,
but what is it? For many business people, real-time data warehousing is the
capability to ask a question and have the request processed and the results
returned immediately. However, this is not what most people in the data
warehousing industry mean by real-time data warehousing. From an industry
perspective, real-time data warehousing refers to providing access to real-time
(when a business transaction completes) or near real-time (soon after a business
transaction completes) data through a data warehouse.
For example, real-time data would enable you to see network usage for
the last ten minutes, or view investment positions as of ‘‘now.’’ In addition,
there are other closely related concepts that address direct access to data in
the operational systems and closely link business intelligence capabilities with

408
Part V
■Next Steps—Expanding on Success
the operational systems. Here, real-time data warehousing refers to the how
quickly data is made available through the data warehousing environment.
The question at hand is what real time means to you. The objective is to get
data to the business at the right time. The right time means getting the data to
the business users in time to help them make decisions. This may mean real
time in some cases, but in many others it means ‘‘by the start of business the
next morning.’’ The goal is to get the data to the right people when it will be
most useful for decision making.
Many organizations agonize over building a real-time environment, but
their business does not operate at that speed. For insurance companies, for
example, it may seem interesting to have real-time policy and claims data
in order to watch loss ratios unfold. However, unless you are in the excess
and surplus business, you can’t change your rates immediately anyway, so
if you see a pattern emerge this afternoon, you would still need to build a
case and present it to the state board of insurance before you could institute
a rate change. In other words, if a business decision can’t be implemented
immediately anyway, what is the value of building the infrastructure needed
to support loading real-time data? In this case, the right time may be to
continue with daily loads of data to monitor the business.
In some cases, the data may need to be refreshed every hour or perhaps every
ﬁfteen minutes. If data is truly needed up to the second, then a continuous
trickle of data may be more appropriate. In any case, the infrastructure must be
built to support these increased demands. The data may be loaded into an oper-
ational data store (ODS), an integrated, up-to-the-moment operational database
or into a partition of the data warehouse set aside for this high-performance
real-time data loading. At the end of the day, if the solution that has been
devised is working, then great! If your organization does not have a real need
for time-critical data, then don’t worry about these issues. Continue to load
and maintain the data with the timing that is necessary to support the speed
of your decision-making processes. There are many considerations regarding
the design, development, implementation, support, and cost of real-time or
near real-time data warehousing, a subject beyond the scope of this book.
Unstructured Data
In years past, it was ludicrous to think of searching through textual data in a
timely manner to ﬁnd useful tidbits. Think about searching the Internet, which
offers an overwhelming volume of information, in many different formats.
Therefore, we know it is possible. What does this mean for data warehousing?
Most data warehousing technology and methods have been focused on
structured data—how to organize and use it. However, many other types
of information are useful as well. Organizations often have maps, photos,
contracts, and schematics and/or blueprints. For example, it would be helpful

Chapter 13
■Achieving Long-Term Success
409
for claim handling to be able to pull up photos of both vehicles involved in an
accident or a photo of the wind damage from a severe thunderstorm.
A basic method to handle these unstructured elements or objects is to have
descriptors assigned to them. These keywords can be stored and searched the
same way as any other structured data. Once the object of interest is identiﬁed
using traditional query methods, the object itself can be pulled up for viewing.
Advancements continue to be made for storing and gaining ﬂexible access
to these unstructured types of data. As breakthroughs are made, often for
purposes other than a data warehouse, we need to think of ways we can
harness these capabilities to support business decision-making processes.
Monitoring Industry Innovation
As technology continues to leap forward, there are more and more oppor-
tunities to leverage the data warehouse. It is necessary to keep up with
advancements in the tools and to keep the organization moving forward
with efforts to utilize these improved technologies.
To put things into proper perspective, think back to the advent of the PC.
Suddenly, each individual was expected to handle a whole new set of tasks.
Not only did you have to draft the content, but everyone was expected to
type reports and memos themselves. The entire approach to communicating
with one another has changed as well. We have instant access to one another’s
calendars for scheduling meetings. Questions and answers can be handled via
a series of e-mail messages, sometimes without direct interaction. Moreover,
accessing e-mail is no longer limited to sitting at your desk, but can be used
almost continuously with PDAs and cell phones.
As new generations enter the workforce, their expectations of how to use
technology and what that interaction looks like is changing dramatically.
Texting, instant messaging, blogging, and social networking are a regular part
of the fabric of their lives, often starting in elementary school. They also have
high expectations for technical interfaces because of their use of electronic
gaming systems. These games offer incredibly realistic graphics and ﬂuid
3-D movement. Consider the interface used for the Wii, whereby your actual
physical motions drive the games. Even modest handheld systems provide
rich, realistic interfaces. (You can blow bubbles in the game Nintendogs simply
by blowing on the screen!)
With data warehousing, it is important to keep an eye on what new inno-
vations are being introduced. Someone in the organization, perhaps the data
warehouse manager, should regularly attend data warehouse industry confer-
ences to see what new technologies are being introduced to the marketplace.
This is also a good way to keep on top of new design, development, and
deployment practices. Representatives should also attend any conferences or
seminars offered by the vendors of the tools you are using in order to keep

410
Part V
■Next Steps—Expanding on Success
current with new product features and enhancements. In addition to keeping
an eye on technology, it is important to continue to monitor and measure the
impact that the data warehouse is having on the organization.
N O T E
Don’t jump on the latest fad. It is ﬁne to keep up with trends and changes
in technology. Look around to see what is out there. However, always come back
to the reality of what are you trying to accomplish. Implement products that support
the business community to deliver business value. Just because a new feature is
getting a lot of press does not mean that it will provide value to your organization.
Moving Toward Business Value
Success can mean a wide variety of things to many different people. Only you
can determine whether the ﬁnancial investment and all the hard work was
worth it. What return is the organization actually seeing? This is not usually
easy to answer. Someone needs to follow up with the business groups to
determine what types of progress and success they are seeing from use of the
data warehouse.
Measuring Success One Step at a Time
Although this may have been done as part of a post-implementation project
review, it is still valuable to go back to the information you captured when
the project was initiated and see what was learned during the requirements
gathering process. The project objectives were captured in the project charter.
Look at the pre-data warehouse baseline results. Collect feedback on what is
happening now that the data warehouse is in place. It is also important to
collect details about all the ways in which the data warehouse is being used.
Sometimes, the biggest beneﬁts were part of the original objectives.
What types of results do people see? One organization determined that
increasing customer retention by 0.5% would result in $4 million of additional
revenue annually. Another organization was able to improve response rates
from promotions by 1%, resulting in an average increase in sales of $1.3 million
per promotion. A third organization was able to streamline and increase the
accuracy of their inventory replenishment process resulting in more consistent
national distribution of products. This helped eliminate overstocks in some
stores while others were out of stock. This reduced the post-holiday inventory
that had to be discounted. Overall, this added an average of $3 million dollars
in revenue for each major holiday season. Many big successes like these are
not widely publicized—organizations with these kinds of results are often
unwilling to reveal anything to the general public.
It is much more common to see a decision that resulted in $25,000 of new
revenue, another decision that saves $10,000, and yet another that results in

Chapter 13
■Achieving Long-Term Success
411
$5,000 a month in add-on customer sales. For some companies, these are each
rather small amounts, but when accumulated over time the ﬁnancial results
can be signiﬁcant.
How can these results be identiﬁed and measured? It can be challenging for
the data warehouse team to capture information about these beneﬁts. This is
much better done through the business management chain. It may be difﬁcult
for business people to attribute their successes to the data warehouse. A report
or results of an analysis may contribute to making a decision, but someone’s
experience and insight from non-data-warehouse input also are used to make
decisions. Link the collection of business value to public recognition.
Business managers need to work with their staff to determine when and
how the data warehouse is used. While this can happen informally, the best
results come from a concerted effort to capture and document business results.
Ask everyone to submit the ‘‘decision of the week,’’ the best new report,
or results that made a difference each month. Provide incentives to the best
submissions. These do not need to be costly rewards, but something that
would be valued—perhaps being allowed to leave two hours early on Friday
or getting to park in a favorable location. Purchase a ‘‘goofy’’ trophy that is
awarded to the person who made the best use of BI in the current month. This
can become a ‘‘badge of honor’’ as it gets passed around the group. Create
an environment where people can ‘‘brag’’ about what they have been able
to accomplish. If you do not have success stories, even small ones, then you
need to jump in to ﬁgure out why. There may be challenges in getting the
business to use the data warehouse.
Another tactic that can help quantify value is to compare current business
results with the baseline results articulated at the beginning of a data ware-
house project. If the organization’s goal was to improve market penetration
by 0.5%, what was the original penetration? What is it now? Every goal may
not have been reached yet, but some progress is usually observed.
N O T E Be sure to communicate your success to the rest of the organization.
Publish the simple usage statistics and business results as they are identiﬁed.
Success must also be shared with the executive business sponsor, the business
champion, and other business and IT managers.
Once mechanisms are in place to get people to share how they are using
the data warehouse to drive business results, it is important to keep track.
Someone needs to be responsible for documenting these results. While the
ﬁrst impulse is to get the data warehouse manager to do this, it is much more
effective to get someone from the business community, perhaps the business
champion, to take on this responsibility.
Part of this task is following up to assign a dollar value to what was
done. Sometimes this can be provided as proof of results, but sometimes it

412
Part V
■Next Steps—Expanding on Success
takes additional discussion to clarify. In many instances, decisions may have
been made in a timelier manner, which may be difﬁcult to quantify. The
most exciting part is adding all of these individual results together. There is
often a much bigger impact overall than expected. These composite results
need to be shared with upper management and across the business and IT
communities.
Adjusting Expectations to Reality
The previous section focused on identifying and quantifying results. Even
when concrete results can be measured, it is possible for the data warehouse to
fall short of expectations. How do you know what people’s expectations are?
When a data warehouse project is under way, the ofﬁcial expectations should
be documented in the project charter and/or scope. However, individuals
may have their own expectations, which may or may not align with the
ofﬁcial version. Individual expectations are often shared during the process
of gathering requirements. Once the data warehouse goes into production, it
is still important to keep in touch with expectations of the user community.
Periodically, go out into the user community and listen to their concerns. This
can easily be done when gathering requirements and enhancement requests
for the enhancement planning process.
Sometimes individuals or groups seem to always have crazy ideas. Don’t just
write off their input. These are often the people who can push the organization
forward into new and better ways of running the business. In other cases,
individuals bring a wealth of previous experience to the organization. This
can include ideas that no one has even dreamed of, let alone knew were
possible.
Naturally, serious problems can arise if what is delivered and supported falls
short of expectations, regardless of how unrealistic those expectations may be.
After exploring expectations across the organization, it is important to follow
up with a good dose of reality. Communicate the data warehouse priorities
back to these groups. If their needs and expectations will not be met, let them
know now. While this may not be an easy meeting, it is much better than
waiting and allowing their hopes to grow. When possible, these discussions
should be led by the business decision makers. Share the business rationale
for the priorities that have been set. If an individual or group continues to
have concerns, they should work directly with their management and the data
warehouse steering committee.
N O T E
As noted elsewhere in this book, communication is critical to data
warehouse success. Too often, communication is viewed as telling others about
what is happening. Keep in mind that good communication involves listening too.

Chapter 13
■Achieving Long-Term Success
413
Keeping the Momentum Going
Executives and managers, within the business and IT, play a signiﬁcant role
in the ongoing success of the data warehouse. These groups must continue to
strengthen their partnership and work jointly to achieve the data warehouse
objectives. Management must continue to commit by allocating necessary
resources and being willing to make decisions about priorities and direc-
tion of the data warehouse. This also requires a willingness to support data
governance to ensure that the data is deﬁned and used effectively. Finally,
business management must communicate the value of information to the
organization. This includes encouraging the use of data and underscoring
the value of performing analysis and making fact-based decisions. Manage-
ment sets the tone that drives the organization’s attitude toward the data
warehouse.
When a data warehouse is ﬁrst released, there is often a great deal of
enthusiasm and support. When there has been strong partnership between
the business and IT throughout the life of a project, everyone feels a sense of
ownership. The business is trained and use begins to take off.
Once the initial glamour wears off, frustration can build, but if problems
and issues are addressed in a timely manner, this can be managed. As the
data warehouse and BI application settle in to become the new status quo,
several things can be put into place to help ensure long-term adoption of
the data warehouse. While the following suggestions may be part of the data
warehouse project, it is important that they continue as the data warehouse
moves into production:
Include the use of the data warehouse and skills to perform analysis as
part of the job description and responsibilities of appropriate person-
nel: This sends a clear message that these skills are valued and identiﬁes
who is expected to perform these functions. This helps ensure that these
skills continue to be cultivated for years to come. Otherwise, the level of
expertise and skill can degrade over time.
Groom replacements for all critical data warehouse roles: Both business
and IT staff members will change positions over time, often within the
organization and sometimes leaving. Although a key individual will
serve as the data warehouse executive sponsor, another person should
begin to learn and understand what that role entails. When the executive
sponsor leaves that position, someone is ready to step up and shoulder
those responsibilities.
Continue to offer introductory education: Education that introduces the
data, the reports, and analysis must continue to be offered regularly. This
is the primary mechanism for new staff members to become proﬁcient in
using the BI solution.

414
Part V
■Next Steps—Expanding on Success
Provide advanced education opportunities: In addition to ensuring that
new staff members learn the basics, it is important to offer a series of
courses or tutorials to help current users increase their data warehouse
skills. Education opportunities should include more in-depth training on
the data, additional features, and capabilities of the BI technology and
how to perform more advanced analyses.
Be practical: Best practices are often the culmination of years of experi-
ence, yet rarely does one single project or organization do everything in
every possible area completely and thoroughly. Ensure that the develop-
ment and enforcement of standards does not overshadow reality. Make
informed decisions about what is feasible for the organization today, and
move toward your long-term vision.
Be ﬂexible: The entire management team must be willing to listen and
then adjust as necessary to keep the data warehouse going.
Don’t give up: Data warehousing must be viewed as a new corporate
lifestyle, rather than a single project with a set deadline for completion.
The data warehouse is never ‘‘done.’’ When problems crop up or a data
warehouse stalls, many organizations simply cut the funding and dissolve
the project teams. Then, after several months, a new effort is created to
start over. Rather than stop completely before a project is perceived to
have reached the point of delivering value, take a hard look at what
progress has been made to date. With a little more patience and effort,
some value can be seen.
Be sure to follow through: Too often, great work is completed to set
standards but then they are never adopted. The enterprise team can
pull together recommendations for best practices or to enhance a project
methodology to support data warehousing, but if these are never used
by any projects, then this has been a waste of time. Once standards and
recommendations are developed, additional effort must be expended to
put these into practice.
Continue to address data governance issues: These include deﬁning the
data, implementing master data management, and developing methods
to address data quality issues.
These are a compilation of practical steps and areas that require ongoing
attention to increase the long-term viability of a data warehouse. It is more
important to keep an eye on how the data warehouse enables business users.
When the data warehouse is helping support the business, this generates more
use. Business managers can do several things to encourage continued use of
the data warehouse:

Chapter 13
■Achieving Long-Term Success
415
Identify and publicly acknowledge successes, large and small: This
is the most important thing managers can do. As part of their regular
progress reports, employees should be encouraged to include how they
used the data warehouse. As successes are recognized by management,
others within the group will also want recognition. This taps into the
competitive nature of people to keep up with their peers.
Continue to identify business opportunities: It is never too late to
gather business requirements. This is not collecting desired reports,
but understanding how data could support the business community.
Learning what is needed to support different business groups is critical
to ensuring successful reporting and analysis. Chapter 6 has speciﬁc
techniques for gathering requirements, and explains how the business
community can prepare and effectively participate.
In addition to partnering with IT on a project, the business community
should also continue to seek new ways to leverage the data in the
warehouse. This should happen without a formal requirements gathering
process associated with a project. Some new ideas may be addressed
immediately, while others may need to be included as part of maintenance
or a new development project.
Keep an eye on how the data warehouse is being used: What types
of analyses and decision making is being done? Take the best ideas
and share them across the group. This helps spread the best ideas and
practices across the organization.
Allocate some time for visionaries to explore: This enables them to take
existing analyses one or two steps further or to otherwise be creative and
follow up on new ideas they may have.
Work with your staff to determine what additional education would
be beneﬁcial: There are many different types of education, not just how
to use the BI application. Consider enrolling employees in courses or
seminars to learn about business process reengineering, your industry
analytics, or advanced statistical modeling.
Use the data warehouse yourself to measure the group’s performance:
Make sure that the group knows that you are using it.
Encourage deeper use of data: Don’t stop by asking for a high-level sum-
mary of the business; dig deeper to identify patterns and trends. Over
time, this will progress from looking at how things are to identifying sit-
uations that need attention. Next, move toward identiﬁcation of potential
problems so that proactive measures can be taken to avoid them. You can
help drive this effort by the types of questions you ask.

416
Part V
■Next Steps—Expanding on Success
Stay in touch with the organization’s data warehouse staff: Regular
communication is natural when you are involved in a project. Keep up
periodic communication after the project is complete too. Make sure you
know what enhancements are planned, what is happening with the tools,
and explore how other groups are using the data warehouse. Provide
feedback to the data warehouse support team—not just what is broken,
but what is working for you too.
This section has reviewed several areas that are often overlooked as a data
warehouse moves into production. Perhaps not at ﬁrst, but over a number of
years, these concepts can easily be lost. Make a conscious effort to include them
into the fabric of the organization. The goal is for the data warehouse to become
a tool that is used regularly and relied upon, like using a word processor or
checking e-mail. Getting to that point requires the encouragement and support
of business management. No matter how desperately the IT people want others
to use and appreciate the data warehouse, the impetus must come from within
the business community.
Celebrating Progress
A lot of attention is given to identifying and working through problems. It is
even more important to ensure that success is also identiﬁed. Progress is often
measured and included in executive brieﬁngs. Too often, this information is
not shared with the rest of the organization. A lot of hard work goes into
building a data warehouse, and executives and managers play a critical role
in motivating and encouraging staff members who are involved. While each
organization has its own ways to reward teams and celebrate progress, here
are a few simple things can be done to encourage the project team and the
business users:
Publish a data warehouse/BI newsletter that highlights accomplish-
ments: These do not need to be limited to multimillion-dollar decisions.
An accomplishment could be that a certain group got 100% of their staff
members to complete the online tutorial or that three new reports were
created to support the call center managers.
E-mail a thank-you to someone who put in extra effort to respond to a
last-minute request from the executive team: Copy the rest of the group
on the e-mail so that others know about it too.
Surprise the ETL developers with balloons: These are some of the
hardest-working, least-known members of the project team.
Send thank-you notes to the support team after a difﬁcult problem has
been resolved: This can be from business representatives to the IT team
or from the IT team to a helpful person on the business side.

Chapter 13
■Achieving Long-Term Success
417
Have a data warehouse anniversary party.
Invite members from the project team to see how the BI application
works: Have a business analyst provide the demonstration so that their
excitement is seen. This is why everyone worked so hard.
Offer coupons that can be earned by sharing how an analysis helped
you get your work done: The coupons can be redeemed for whatever
rewards your staff ﬁnds valuable, such as the opportunity to leave an
hour early.
Although every organization has different things that are valued as rewards,
food is often a great motivator (e.g., pastries, pizza, or bagels). What usually
makes the biggest impact, and doesn’t cost a thing, is when someone per-
sonally notices and appreciates your work. It is extremely powerful when
business managers express their appreciation to IT staff members. Likewise,
IT managers need to do the same for members of the business community
who are really making a difference. Keep your eyes open for opportunities to
thank one another.
N O T E The best reward is when the business group is able to meet or exceed its
business goals. Many factors drive business success, but a data warehouse can
indeed play a part. Take a moment to reﬂect on how the data warehouse helped
when you cash your bonus check!
Sometimes it may seem as though you are just spinning your wheels and
not making any tangible progress. The ability to see progress, however, is
analogous to watching one’s children grow and change. If you measure them
every morning, you are unlikely to notice any change; but if you wait to
take that measurement, then one morning you will suddenly notice growth
of an inch! Similarly, you often don’t notice how your children’s faces are
maturing until you see a major difference when looking at photographs from
last summer or the previous school year.
Measuring the progress and maturity of a data warehouse is quite similar.
You may not notice any change at all when you compare this week to last
week, but if you stop every six months to review progress, you are likely to be
pleasantly surprised. Therefore, add a reminder to your calendar to reﬂect on
data warehouse and BI growth. After you take a moment to reﬂect, share your
observations with others!
Success Can Be Attained
There are plenty of data warehouse success stories. The types of beneﬁts
vary widely and depend upon many variables, including the organization’s
industry, the maturity of the business, its size, and the state of the marketplace.

418
Part V
■Next Steps—Expanding on Success
The following examples are included to share real-world data warehouse
initiatives that have had a positive impact. Speciﬁc ﬁnancial results cannot be
shared, but the general business scenarios are summarized. Overlay what the
ﬁnancials would look like if you could accomplish these objectives. Use these
to spark ideas for what could be done within your organization:
Improved policy underwriting: For an insurance company, policy
renewals are a signiﬁcant source of revenue. Using the data warehouse
with policy and claims history, this company was able to identify the
highest-risk customers and develop a proﬁle for those customers. This
proﬁle was used to support getting approval for a rate change. The
proﬁle is now being used for underwriting to rate new policy quotes and
for the renewal of existing policies.
Understanding total customer value: There are many efforts to support
customer relationship management. This organization needed to integrate
data from multiple disparate divisions in order to get a complete picture of
its customers. The data warehouse was built to include customer sales and
demographics from each of the separate divisions. This enabled corporate
marketing to identify cross-selling opportunities, which increased sales.
They also were able to ﬂag high-value customers so that the individual
divisions could provide premier customer service, regardless of the
customer status for that part of the business. These efforts improved
overall customer satisfaction and customer retention. As a side note, the
work done to develop an integrated customer dimension was used to
help launch an enterprise master data management program.
Vendor performance management: Purchasing data and vendor quality
measurements were combined in a data warehouse. This enabled the
vendor management team to identify the highest-volume vendors with
the worst track record for on-time delivery and product defects. This
in turn enabled the team to eliminate some of the worst offenders and
to include performance standards in the new vendor contracts. With
just-in-time delivery to the plants, this reduced manufacturing delays
and the cost associated with defective parts.
Teacher supply and demand: At both the state and the federal level, it
is necessary to understand the future demand for teachers and to take
appropriate steps to ensure that skilled professionals are prepared and
ready to teach our children. From the state perspective, a data warehouse
was built to include current student data, teacher certiﬁcation details,
population growth, and data about education majors still in college.
These were used to identify what teachers would be needed, by grade
and subject, and by geographic area.

Chapter 13
■Achieving Long-Term Success
419
Taking it further, this data was compared to teachers who were certiﬁed,
both those currently working as teachers and those who were not but
who had maintained their credentials. This was combined with the
college student data to gain a realistic perspective of the true supply of
teachers, which predicted a serious shortage of science teachers within
the next ﬁve years, more severely in some of the rural geographic
areas. In response, funds were provided for marketing to high school
science students to recruit new teachers. Financial incentives were offered
to science teachers willing to relocate to the areas with the greatest
need. Unlike other examples that demonstrated a clear ﬁnancial return,
in this case the data warehouse enabled the organization to perform
its core function: providing quality education to all of the children in
the state.
Call center scheduling: Effectively stafﬁng a call center requires a sound
understanding of calling patterns. The data warehouse was built to
integrate call detail with employee payroll and scheduling data. This was
used to identify call patterns and outcomes. Analysis was also done to
evaluate the impact of employee experience on outcomes. Together, these
were used to predict future call patterns, which were used to help call
center managers ensure appropriate stafﬁng. This resulted in a signiﬁcant
decrease in call wait times, an increase in customer satisfaction, and
reduced staff costs for low-volume periods.
Although beneﬁts like these are sometimes seen quickly, more often they
occur over a number of years. These examples are intended to encourage
you. If you were able to accomplish similar objectives, what would that mean
ﬁnancially? Put yourself into these situations to dream of the possibilities.
A data warehouse can indeed be a useful tool for moving an organization
forward and positively affecting the ﬁnancial bottom line.
Conclusion
The success of the data warehouse launch will result in more work. As the
business gains experience with what has been delivered so far, more ideas
will be generated. The expansion and growth of the data warehouse should be
handled in a systematic and organized manner. Resources across the enterprise
can be leveraged by creating an enterprise data warehouse team. This chapter
shared several structural alternatives and possible responsibilities. It also
introduced several concepts to provide a quick look at the types of things on
the data warehousing industry horizon. Finally, the chapter looked at how
you can measure business value and what you can do to ensure long-term
success.

Part V
■Next Steps—Expanding on Success
This book has covered a lot of ground, including planning, designing,
constructing, and launching a data warehouse. The basic concepts have been
shared in a way to provide you with a foundation for your own data warehouse
efforts—enabling you to be more effective at communicating, understanding,
and participating in all aspects of a data warehouse. The most important
thread throughout this book is that there must be a strong partnership between
business and IT in order to see sustainable data warehouse success. Whether
you are working on the organization’s ﬁrst data warehouse project or the nth,
take heart—it is within your reach to glean true business value from your data
warehouse.

Glossary
Attribute
Individual data element that is represented and stored in a dimen-
sion. Each attribute contains data relating to that dimension.
Base fact
A fact that is physically stored in the data warehouse, in a fact
table.
Business dimension
The part of a business dimensional model that diagrams
the business abstraction of data elements or attributes used to describe
the major categories of reference data, such as customer or product. The
diagrams also show how these attributes relate to one another, including
hierarchies, groupings, and drill paths. The business dimension reﬂects the
business perspective regardless of the number of physical tables used to
store the data. See also dimension.
Business dimensional model (BDM)
A data model that provides a business
abstraction of the data needed to support reporting and analysis. The model
shows diagrams of dimensions and facts so that the details can be reviewed
and discussed in business terms. It also separates the business perspective
from technical implementation details.
Business intelligence (BI)
The collection of one or more reports or anal-
yses, using data from the data warehouse, that provide insight into the
421

422
Glossary
performance of a business organization. These reports and analyses are typ-
ically interactive to enable further understanding of speciﬁc areas of interest.
They are used to support business professionals in their decision-making
processes.
Business measures
The complete set of facts, base and derived, that are
deﬁned and made available for reporting and analysis.
Conformed dimension
A dimension that is shared between two or more
fact tables. It enables the integration of data from different fact tables at
query time. This is a foundational principle that enables the longevity of
a data warehousing environment. By using conformed dimensions, facts
can be used together, aligned along these common dimensions. The beauty
of using conformed dimensions is that facts that were designed indepen-
dently of each other, perhaps over a number of years, can be integrated.
The use of conformed dimensions is the central technique for building an
enterprise data warehouse from a set of data marts.
Conformed fact
A fact or measure whose deﬁnition is consistent across fact
tables and data marts. A conformed fact, such as revenue, can be correctly
added and compared across different fact tables.
Dashboard (also called performance dashboard)
The presentation of key
business measurements on a single interface designed for quick interpreta-
tion, often using graphics. The most effective dashboards are supported by
a full data mart that enables drilling down into more detailed data to better
understand the indicators.
Data architecture
Describes how data is organized and structured to support
the development, maintenance, and use of the data by application systems.
This includes guidelines and recommendations for historical retention of
the data, and how the data is to be used and accessed.
Data cleansing
The process of verifying and correcting data using a series
of business rules for validation, and specifying how to handle cases that fail
the checks.
Data dictionary
The place where information about data that exists in the
organization is stored. This should include both technical and business
details about each data element.
Data element
The smallest unit of data that is named. The values are stored
in a column or a ﬁeld in a database.

Glossary
423
Data governance
The practice of organizing and implementing policies, pro-
cedures, and standards for the effective use of an organization’s structured
or unstructured information assets.
Data mart
A collection of data that is organized for end user ease of use and
performance. The term is typically used to describe all of the data that is
loaded into a single database and used together for analysis. Data marts are
often developed to meet the needs of a business group such as marketing or
ﬁnance. The key to successful data marts is to create them in an integrated
manner using conformed dimensions (explained in Chapter 7). It is also
recommended that data be loaded into only one data mart and then shared
across the organization to ensure data consistency.
Data model
An abstraction of how individual data elements relate to each
other. It visually depicts how the data is to be organized and stored
in a database. A data model provides the mechanism to document and
understand how data is organized.
Data quality
Assessment of the cleanliness, accuracy, and reliability of data.
Data warehouse
For the purposes of this book, a data warehouse is the
collectionofdataand processesthat gatherdatafromacrossthe organization,
organize it for access, and deliver reports and analyses to the business
community. Other well-known deﬁnitions of a data warehouse in the
industry that are worth mentioning include the following:
(1) The complete end-to-end data warehouse and business intelligence
system (DW/BI system). Although some would argue that you can theo-
retically deliver business intelligence without a data warehouse and vice
versa, that is ill-advised from our perspective. Linking the two together
in the DW/BI acronym reinforces their dependency. Independently, we
refer to the queryable data in your DW/BI system as the enterprise data
warehouse, and value-add analytics as BI (business intelligence) applica-
tions. (From The Data Warehouse Lifecycle Toolkit, Second Edition, by Ralph
Kimball et al., John Wiley and Sons, 2008, pg. 602.)
(2) The data warehouse is a collection of integrated subject-oriented data
bases designed to support the DSS (decision support system) function,
where each unit of data is relevant to some moment in time. The data
warehouse contains atomic data and lightly summarized data. (From
Building the Data Warehouse, Fourth Edition, by Bill Inmon and Claudia
Imhoff, John Wiley and Sons, 2005, pg. 495.)

424
Glossary
. . . It [the DW] is the central point of data integration for business intelligence
and is the source of data for the data marts, delivering a common view of
enterprise data. (From Mastering Data Warehouse Design, by Claudia Imhoff,
Nicholas Galemmo, and Jonathon Geiger, John Wiley and Sons, 2003, pg.
400.)
Degenerate dimension
A single attribute dimension whereby the only
attribute is a reference identiﬁer such as invoice number, P.O. number,
or transaction ID. This is needed to support analysis of the individual parts
of a business transaction (individual line items) and the entire business
transaction (the whole purchase order).
Derived attribute
An attribute that is created to facilitate the overall useful-
ness of the dimensional model. This enables different attributes to be pulled
together using a single identiﬁer that can help the technical implementation
of the dimensional model. It is used when the underlying source systems do
not have a data element to uniquely deﬁne this case, and is required to pull
together nonrelated attributes of a junk dimension.
Derived fact
A fact that is calculated on-the-ﬂy and not stored in the database.
Dimension
Major
business
categories
of
information
or
groupings
to describe business data. Dimensions contain information used for
constraining queries, report headings, and deﬁning drill paths. Within a
dimension, speciﬁc attributes are the data elements that are used as row and
column headers on reports. Dimensional attributes are also considered to be
reference data. When describing the need to report information by region,
by week, and by month, the attributes following ‘‘by’’ are dimensions. Each
of these would be included in a dimension.
Dimensional model
A data model organized for the purpose of user under-
standability and high performance. In a relational database, a dimensional
model is a star join schema characterized by a central fact table with a
multi-part key. The components of this key are joined to a set of dimen-
sion tables, each deﬁned by its own primary keys. In a multi-dimensional
database, a dimensional model is the database cube.
Dimensional modeling
A formal data modeling technique that is used to
organize and represent data for analytical and reporting use. The focus is on
the business perspective and the representation of data.
Entity-relationship (E-R) model
A data model that is used to represent data
in its purest form and to deﬁne relationships between different entities.

Glossary
425
It is often the type of model used to design online transaction processing
systems. See also normalized model.
Extract, transform, and load (ETL)
The collection of processes that are
used to prepare data for another purpose. This is typically applied to data
warehousing, whereby the extract process collects data from the appropriate
underlying source systems. The transformation processes perform cleansing,
manipulation, and reorganization of the data in preparation for its intended
use. Finally, the load processes put the data into the data structures where it
is held for data delivery. While ETL processes are regularly discussed in the
context of building the data warehouse, these techniques can also be used
for moving and manipulating data for a variety of other purposes.
Fact group
Part of a business dimensional model that diagrams a collection
of individual facts that have identical dimensionality and level of detail (or
grain).
Factless fact table
A fact table that captures the existence of business events
that do not have an associated quantitative measurement. The existence of
the relationship is what is relevant.
Facts
The fundamental measurements of the business. These are captured
as speciﬁc information about a business event or transaction. They are
measured, monitored, and tracked over time. Facts are typically the amounts
and counts that show up as the body of reports. Facts are used for any and
all calculations that are performed.
Grain
The level of detail showing how fact data is stored and available for
analysis.
Hybrid OLAP (HOLAP)
OLAP technology that uses both multidimensional
cubes and relational databases to support business functions.
Information management
In its simplest form, this is the work associ-
ated with collecting, maintaining, applying, and leveraging data across an
organization.
Infrastructure
A basic foundation technology that all other initiatives in the
organization can rely on and use. This includes basic networking services
such as providing shared network drives for storing the group’s ﬁles (e.g.,
word processing documents, spreadsheets, and presentations). The existence
of some sort of computer for each user can also be considered infrastructure.

426
Glossary
Basic networking of computers, via a local area or wireless network, is
another example of infrastructure.
Junk dimension
A dimension that brings together single attributes that may
or may not have any true relationship to each other in order to simplify the
model, improve query performance, and/or reduce data storage.
Master data management (MDM)
The processes and tools to help an orga-
nization consistently deﬁne and manage core reference or descriptive data
across the organization. This may involve providing a centralized view of
the data to ensure that its use for all business processes is consistent and
accurate.
Multi-dimensional OLAP (MOLAP)
OLAP technology whereby the data is
stored in proprietary array structures called multi-dimensional cubes. See also
OLAP.
Normalized model
A data model organized to clarify pure data relationships
and targeted at gaining efﬁciencies in data storage and maintenance. This
is used for the design of transaction processing systems. There are speciﬁc
rules for normalization. Depending upon the number of rules followed (for
different purposes) there are different ‘‘forms,’’ such as third normal form.
See also entity-relationship model.
Online analytical processing (OLAP)
A collection of common business
analysis functions that are difﬁcult to perform directly with SQL. Some of
the speciﬁc functions that fall under the OLAP umbrella include time series
comparisons, ranking, ratios, penetration, thresholds, and contribution to
report or to the whole data population. Most business intelligence tools
provide this type of functionality. The capabilities can be implemented in
a variety of different data storage mechanisms. See also MOLAP, ROLAP,
HOLAP.
Online
transaction
processing
(OLTP)
Online
transaction
processing
(OLTP) systems are the fundamental systems used to run the business.
These are also called operational systems or operational applications. They
are often used as sources of data for the data warehouse.
Operational data store (ODS)
A collection of data from operational systems,
most often integrated together, that is used for some operational purpose.
The most critical characteristic here is that this is used for some opera-
tional function. This operational dependency takes precedence and the ODS
should not be considered a central component of the data warehousing

Glossary
427
environment. An ODS can be a clean, integrated source of data to be pulled
into the data warehousing environment.
Query
The mechanism to get data out of a database. A query is comprised
of constraints used to ﬁlter data out of the results, and deﬁnes the data
elements to be included in the result set and possibly some mathematical
computations, grouping, or sorting of the data.
Relational OLAP (ROLAP)
OLAP technology that uses data is stored in
relational database management systems. Data is usually organized dimen-
sionally using a star or snowﬂake schema.
Role-playing dimension
Instances of a dimension that legitimately has
more than one value for a given business transaction, such as order date and
shipped date. Each attribute with the dimension is uniquely identiﬁed to
enable easy differentiation between the different roles, such as Order Date,
Order Quarter and Shipped Date, and Shipped Quarter.
Scorecard (or performance scorecard)
An application that helps organiza-
tions measure and align the strategic and tactical aspects of their businesses,
comparing organizational and individual performance to goals and targets.
Slowly changing dimension (SCD)
A dimension that accommodates
changes to the reference data over time. Several dimensional modeling
techniques are used to determine how to handle changes to the reference
data stored in dimensions. This may be to retain only the current values
(Type 1), to store different versions of the reference data (Type 2), or to
retain one previous version of changes made to the entire dimension
(Type 3).
Snowﬂake schema
A variation of the star schema in which the business
dimensions are implemented as a set of normalized tables. The resulting
diagram resembles a snowﬂake.
Source system
An operational system of records whose function it is to
capture the transactions of the business. Source systems are often large online
transaction processing systems, but could also be smaller departmental
databases or spreadsheets that are maintained and used by members of the
business community. These are the origin of the data used to build the data
warehouse.
Staging area
Place where data is stored while it is being prepared for use,
typically where data used by ETL processes is stored. This may encompass

428
Glossary
everything from where the data is extracted from its original source until it
is loaded into presentation servers for end user access. It may also be where
data is stored to prepare it for loading into a normalized data warehouse.
Star schema
The implementation of a dimensional model in a relational
database. The tables are organized around a single central fact table pos-
sessing a multi-part key, and each surrounding dimension table has its own
primary key.
Structured query language (SQL)
The programming language used to access
data stored in a relational database.
Technical architecture
Addresses the organization and structure of the col-
lection of hardware and software technologies that are installed to support
the development and delivery of the data warehouse.
Third normal form (3NF)
The most common form of a normalized model.
See also normalized model.

Timely. Practical. Reliable.
An ideal guide for the non-technical professional eager to learn more 
about data warehousing
each step of a data warehouse project, 
and provides a clear explanation of 
what’s involved in efficiently building 
a data warehouse and what must be 
done to deliver the data. You’ll examine 
the business management of a data 
warehouse and discover essential 
methods for cultivating a strong 
partnership between the business and IT 
elements of your organization. You can 
use this knowledge to be more effective 
when sharing your requirements and 
concerns during a project.  
A Manager’s Guide to Data Warehousing 
explains what you need to create your 
data warehouse and establish long-term 
success. The book covers: 
• The most common factors for 
ensuring data warehousing 
success and the roadblocks that 
can  prevent it
• How to ensure that business and 
technical staff have a common 
understanding of the data 
warehouse project
Database/Data Warehousing  
 
 
 
LAURA L. REEVES, coauthor of The 
Data Warehouse Lifecycle Toolkit, 
has over 23 years of experience 
in end-to-end data warehouse 
development focused on developing 
comprehensive project plans, 
collecting business requirements, 
designing business dimensional 
models and database schemas, and 
creating enterprise data warehouse 
strategies and data architectures.
A successful data warehouse project 
can provide immense value for business 
enterprises or other organizations. 
Building and maintaining a data 
warehouse demands the combined 
efforts of both IT and non-technical 
personnel. While there are plenty of 
resources aimed at the technology 
professionals who design and build data 
warehouses, there has to date been no 
useful guide written for a non-technical 
audience. This book fills that void and 
serves as an ideal resource for business 
and IT managers and others from the 
non-IT side who want to do their part to 
ensure data warehousing success.
This helpful book provides a solid 
introduction to the fundamentals of 
data warehousing. The author details
