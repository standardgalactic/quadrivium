William H. Hayt. Jr. (deceased) received his B.S. and M.S. degrees at Purdue Uni-
versity and his Ph.D. from the University of Illinois. After spending four years in
industry, Professor Hayt joined the faculty of Purdue University, where he served as
professor and head of the School of Electrical Engineering, and as professor emeritus
after retiring in 1986. Professor Hayt’s professional society memberships included
Eta Kappa Nu, Tau Beta Pi, Sigma Xi, Sigma Delta Chi, Fellow of IEEE, ASEE, and
NAEB. While at Purdue, he received numerous teaching awards, including the uni-
versity’s Best Teacher Award. He is also listed in Purdue’s Book of Great Teachers, a
permanent wall display in the Purdue Memorial Union, dedicated on April 23, 1999.
The book bears the names of the inaugural group of 225 faculty members, past and
present, who have devoted their lives to excellence in teaching and scholarship. They
were chosen by their students and their peers as Purdue’s ﬁnest educators.
A native of Los Angeles, California, John A. Buck received his M.S. and Ph.D.
degrees in Electrical Engineering from the University of California at Berkeley in
1977 and 1982, and his B.S. in Engineering from UCLA in 1975. In 1982, he joined
the faculty of the School of Electrical and Computer Engineering at Georgia Tech,
where he has remained for the past 28 years. His research areas and publications
have centered within the ﬁelds of ultrafast switching, nonlinear optics, and optical
ﬁber communications. He is the author of the graduate text Fundamentals of Optical
Fibers (Wiley Interscience), which is now in its second edition. Awards include three
institute teaching awards and the IEEE Third Millenium Medal. When not glued to
his computer or conﬁned to the lab, Dr. Buck enjoys music, hiking, and photography.

P R E F A C E
It has been 52 years since the ﬁrst edition of this book was published, then under the
sole authorship of William H. Hayt, Jr. As I was ﬁve years old at that time, this would
have meant little to me. But everything changed 15 years later when I used the second
edition in a basic electromagnetics course as a college junior. I remember my sense
of foreboding at the start of the course, being aware of friends’ horror stories. On ﬁrst
opening the book, however, I was pleasantly surprised by the friendly writing style
and by the measured approach to the subject, which — at least for me — made it a
very readable book, out of which I was able to learn with little help from my professor.
I referred to it often while in graduate school, taught from the fourth and ﬁfth editions
as a faculty member, and then became coauthor for the sixth and seventh editions on
the retirement (and subsequent untimely death) of Bill Hayt. The memories of my
time as a beginner are clear, and I have tried to maintain the accessible style that I
found so welcome then.
Over the 50-year span, the subject matter has not changed, but emphases have. In
theuniversities,thetrendcontinuestowardreducingelectricalengineeringcorecourse
allocations to electromagnetics. I have made efforts to streamline the presentation in
this new edition to enable the student to get to Maxwell’s equations sooner, and I have
added more advanced material. Many of the earlier chapters are now slightly shorter
than their counterparts in the seventh edition. This has been done by economizing on
the wording, shortening many sections, or by removing some entirely. In some cases,
deleted topics have been converted to stand-alone articles and moved to the website,
from which they can be downloaded. Major changes include the following: (1) The
material on dielectrics, formerly in Chapter 6, has been moved to the end of Chapter 5.
(2) The chapter on Poisson’s and Laplace’s equations has been eliminated, retaining
only the one-dimensional treatment, which has been moved to the end of Chapter 6.
The two-dimensional Laplace equation discussion and that of numerical methods have
been moved to the website for the book. (3) The treatment on rectangular waveguides
(Chapter 13) has been expanded, presenting the methodology of two-dimensional
boundary value problems in that context. (4) The coverage of radiation and antennas
has been greatly expanded and now forms the entire Chapter 14.
Some 130 new problems have been added throughout. For some of these, I chose
particularly good “classic” problems from the earliest editions. I have also adopted
a new system in which the approximate level of difﬁculty is indicated beside each
problem on a three-level scale. The lowest level is considered a fairly straightforward
problem, requiring little work assuming the material is understood; a level 2 problem
is conceptually more difﬁcult, and/or may require more work to solve; a level 3 prob-
lem is considered either difﬁcult conceptually, or may require extra effort (including
possibly the help of a computer) to solve.

Preface
xi
As in the previous edition, the transmission lines chapter (10) is stand-alone,
and can be read or covered in any part of a course, including the beginning. In
it, transmission lines are treated entirely within the context of circuit theory; wave
phenomena are introduced and used exclusively in the form of voltages and cur-
rents. Inductance and capacitance concepts are treated as known parameters, and
so there is no reliance on any other chapter. Field concepts and parameter com-
putation in transmission lines appear in the early part of the waveguides chapter
(13), where they play additional roles of helping to introduce waveguiding con-
cepts. The chapters on electromagnetic waves, 11 and 12, retain their independence
of transmission line theory in that one can progress from Chapter 9 directly to
Chapter 11. By doing this, wave phenomena are introduced from ﬁrst principles
but within the context of the uniform plane wave. Chapter 11 refers to Chapter 10 in
places where the latter may give additional perspective, along with a little more detail.
Nevertheless, all necessary material to learn plane waves without previously studying
transmission line waves is found in Chapter 11, should the student or instructor wish
to proceed in that order.
The new chapter on antennas covers radiation concepts, building on the retarded
potential discussion in Chapter 9. The discussion focuses on the dipole antenna,
individually and in simple arrays. The last section covers elementary transmit-receive
systems, again using the dipole as a vehicle.
The book is designed optimally for a two-semester course. As is evident, statics
concepts are emphasized and occur ﬁrst in the presentation, but again Chapter 10
(transmission lines) can be read ﬁrst. In a single course that emphasizes dynamics,
the transmission lines chapter can be covered initially as mentioned or at any point in
the course. One way to cover the statics material more rapidly is by deemphasizing
materials properties (assuming these are covered in other courses) and some of the
advanced topics. This involves omitting Chapter 1 (assigned to be read as a review),
and omitting Sections 2.5, 2.6, 4.7, 4.8, 5.5–5.7, 6.3, 6.4, 6.7, 7.6, 7.7, 8.5, 8.6, 8.8,
8.9, and 9.5.
A supplement to this edition is web-based material consisting of the afore-
mentioned articles on special topics in addition to animated demonstrations and
interactive programs developed by Natalya Nikolova of McMaster University and
Vikram Jandhyala of the University of Washington. Their excellent contributions
are geared to the text, and icons appear in the margins whenever an exercise that
pertains to the narrative exists. In addition, quizzes are provided to aid in further
study.
The theme of the text is the same as it has been since the ﬁrst edition of 1958.
An inductive approach is used that is consistent with the historical development. In
it, the experimental laws are presented as individual concepts that are later uniﬁed
in Maxwell’s equations. After the ﬁrst chapter on vector analysis, additional math-
ematical tools are introduced in the text on an as-needed basis. Throughout every
edition, as well as this one, the primary goal has been to enable students to learn
independently. Numerous examples, drill problems (usually having multiple parts),
end-of-chapter problems, and material on the web site, are provided to facilitate this.

Answers to the drill problems are given below each problem. Answers to odd-
numbered end-of-chapter problems are found in Appendix F. A solutions manual
and a set of PowerPoint slides, containing pertinent ﬁgures and equations, are avail-
able to instructors. These, along with all other material mentioned previously, can be
accessed on the website:

I would like to acknowledge the valuable input of several people who helped
to make this a better edition. Special thanks go to Glenn S. Smith (Georgia Tech),
who reviewed the antennas chapter and provided many valuable comments and sug-
gestions. Detailed suggestions and errata were provided by Clive Woods (Louisiana
State University), Natalya Nikolova, and Don Davis (Georgia Tech). Accuracy checks
on the new problems were carried out by Todd Kaiser (Montana State University)
and Steve Weis (Texas Christian University). Other reviewers provided detailed com-
ments and suggestions at the start of the project; many of the suggestions affected the
outcome. They include:

I also acknowledge the feedback and many comments from students, too numerous to
name, including several who have contacted me from afar. I continue to be open and
grateful for this feedback and can be reached at john.buck@ece.gatech.edu. Many
suggestions were made that I considered constructive and actionable. I regret that
not all could be incorporated because of time restrictions. Creating this book was a
team effort, involving several outstanding people at McGraw-Hill. These include my
publisher, Raghu Srinivasan, and sponsoring editor, Peter Massar, whose vision and
encouragement were invaluable, Robin Reed, who deftly coordinated the production
phase with excellent ideas and enthusiasm, and Darlene Schueller, who was my
guide and conscience from the beginning, providing valuable insights, and jarring me
into action when necessary. Typesetting was supervised by Vipra Fauzdar at Glyph
International, who employed the best copy editor I ever had, Laura Bowman. Diana
Fouts (Georgia Tech) applied her vast artistic skill to designing the cover, as she has
done for the previous two editions. Finally, I am, as usual in these projects, grateful
to a patient and supportive family, and particularly to my daughter, Amanda, who
assisted in preparing the manuscript.

Vector Analysis
V
ector analysis is a mathematical subject that is better taught by mathematicians
than by engineers. Most junior and senior engineering students have not had
the time (or the inclination) to take a course in vector analysis, although it is
likely that vector concepts and operations were introduced in the calculus sequence.
These are covered in this chapter, and the time devoted to them now should depend
on past exposure.
The viewpoint here is that of the engineer or physicist and not that of the mathe-
matician. Proofs are indicated rather than rigorously expounded, and physical inter-
pretation is stressed. It is easier for engineers to take a more rigorous course in the
mathematics department after they have been presented with a few physical pictures
and applications.
Vector analysis is a mathematical shorthand. It has some new symbols and some
new rules, and it demands concentration and practice. The drill problems, ﬁrst found
at the end of Section 1.4, should be considered part of the text and should all be
worked. They should not prove to be difﬁcult if the material in the accompanying
section of the text has been thoroughly understood. It takes a little longer to “read”
the chapter this way, but the investment in time will produce a surprising interest. ■
1.1
SCALARS AND VECTORS
The term scalar refers to a quantity whose value may be represented by a single
(positive or negative) real number. The x, y, and z we use in basic algebra are scalars,
and the quantities they represent are scalars. If we speak of a body falling a distance
L in a time t, or the temperature T at any point in a bowl of soup whose coordinates
are x, y, and z, then L, t, T, x, y, and z are all scalars. Other scalar quantities are
mass, density, pressure (but not force), volume, volume resistivity, and voltage.
A vector quantity has both a magnitude1 and a direction in space. We are con-
cerned with two- and three-dimensional spaces only, but vectors may be deﬁned in
1 We adopt the convention that magnitude infers absolute value; the magnitude of any quantity is,
therefore, always positive.

ENGINEERING ELECTROMAGNETICS
n-dimensional space in more advanced applications. Force, velocity, acceleration,
and a straight line from the positive to the negative terminal of a storage battery
are examples of vectors. Each quantity is characterized by both a magnitude and a
direction.
Our work will mainly concern scalar and vector ﬁelds. A ﬁeld (scalar or vector)
may be deﬁned mathematically as some function that connects an arbitrary origin
to a general point in space. We usually associate some physical effect with a ﬁeld,
such as the force on a compass needle in the earth’s magnetic ﬁeld, or the movement
of smoke particles in the ﬁeld deﬁned by the vector velocity of air in some region
of space. Note that the ﬁeld concept invariably is related to a region. Some quantity
is deﬁned at every point in a region. Both scalar ﬁelds and vector ﬁelds exist. The
temperature throughout the bowl of soup and the density at any point in the earth
are examples of scalar ﬁelds. The gravitational and magnetic ﬁelds of the earth, the
voltage gradient in a cable, and the temperature gradient in a soldering-iron tip are
examples of vector ﬁelds. The value of a ﬁeld varies in general with both position and
time.
In this book, as in most others using vector notation, vectors will be indicated by
boldface type, for example, A. Scalars are printed in italic type, for example, A. When
writing longhand, it is customary to draw a line or an arrow over a vector quantity to
show its vector character. (CAUTION: This is the ﬁrst pitfall. Sloppy notation, such as
the omission of the line or arrow symbol for a vector, is the major cause of errors in
vector analysis.)
1.2
VECTOR ALGEBRA
With the deﬁnition of vectors and vector ﬁelds now established, we may proceed to
deﬁne the rules of vector arithmetic, vector algebra, and (later) vector calculus. Some
of the rules will be similar to those of scalar algebra, some will differ slightly, and
some will be entirely new.
To begin, the addition of vectors follows the parallelogram law. Figure 1.1 shows
the sum of two vectors, A and B. It is easily seen that A + B = B + A, or that vector
addition obeys the commutative law. Vector addition also obeys the associative law,
A + (B + C) = (A + B) + C
Note that when a vector is drawn as an arrow of ﬁnite length, its location is
deﬁned to be at the tail end of the arrow.
Coplanar vectors are vectors lying in a common plane, such as those shown
in Figure 1.1. Both lie in the plane of the paper and may be added by expressing
each vector in terms of “horizontal” and “vertical” components and then adding the
corresponding components.
Vectors in three dimensions may likewise be added by expressing the vectors
in terms of three components and adding the corresponding components. Examples
of this process of addition will be given after vector components are discussed in
Section 1.4.

CHAPTER 1

Figure 1.1
Two vectors may be added graphically either by drawing
both vectors from a common origin and completing the parallelogram or
by beginning the second vector from the head of the first and completing
the triangle; either method is easily extended to three or more vectors.
The rule for the subtraction of vectors follows easily from that for addition, for
we may always express A−B as A+(−B); the sign, or direction, of the second vector
is reversed, and this vector is then added to the ﬁrst by the rule for vector addition.
Vectors may be multiplied by scalars. The magnitude of the vector changes, but
its direction does not when the scalar is positive, although it reverses direction when
multiplied by a negative scalar. Multiplication of a vector by a scalar also obeys the
associative and distributive laws of algebra, leading to
(r + s)(A + B) = r(A + B) + s(A + B) = rA + rB + sA + sB
Division of a vector by a scalar is merely multiplication by the reciprocal of that
scalar. The multiplication of a vector by a vector is discussed in Sections 1.6 and 1.7.
Two vectors are said to be equal if their difference is zero, or A = B if A −B = 0.
In our use of vector ﬁelds we shall always add and subtract vectors that are deﬁned
at the same point. For example, the total magnetic ﬁeld about a small horseshoe mag-
net will be shown to be the sum of the ﬁelds produced by the earth and the permanent
magnet; the total ﬁeld at any point is the sum of the individual ﬁelds at that point.
If we are not considering a vector ﬁeld, we may add or subtract vectors that are
not deﬁned at the same point. For example, the sum of the gravitational force acting
on a 150 lb f (pound-force) man at the North Pole and that acting on a 175 lb f person
at the South Pole may be obtained by shifting each force vector to the South Pole
before addition. The result is a force of 25 lb f directed toward the center of the earth
at the South Pole; if we wanted to be difﬁcult, we could just as well describe the force
as 25 lb f directed away from the center of the earth (or “upward”) at the North Pole.2
1.3
THE RECTANGULAR
COORDINATE SYSTEM
To describe a vector accurately, some speciﬁc lengths, directions, angles, projections,
or components must be given. There are three simple methods of doing this, and
about eight or ten other methods that are useful in very special cases. We are going
2 Students have argued that the force might be described at the equator as being in a “northerly”
direction. They are right, but enough is enough.

ENGINEERING ELECTROMAGNETICS
to use only the three simple methods, and the simplest of these is the rectangular, or
rectangular cartesian, coordinate system.
In the rectangular coordinate system we set up three coordinate axes mutually
at right angles to each other and call them the x, y, and z axes. It is customary to
choose a right-handed coordinate system, in which a rotation (through the smaller
angle) of the x axis into the y axis would cause a right-handed screw to progress in
the direction of the z axis. If the right hand is used, then the thumb, foreﬁnger, and
middle ﬁnger may be identiﬁed, respectively, as the x, y, and z axes. Figure 1.2a
shows a right-handed rectangular coordinate system.
A point is located by giving its x, y, and z coordinates. These are, respectively,
the distances from the origin to the intersection of perpendicular lines dropped from
the point to the x, y, and z axes. An alternative method of interpreting coordinate

right hand indicate the direction through which the x axis is turned into coincidence with the

values, which must be used in all other coordinate systems, is to consider the point as
being at the common intersection of three surfaces. These are the planes x = constant,
y = constant, and z = constant, where the constants are the coordinate values of the
point.
Figure 1.2b shows points P and Q whose coordinates are (1, 2, 3) and (2, −2, 1),
respectively. Point P is therefore located at the common point of intersection of the
planes x = 1, y = 2, and z = 3, whereas point Q is located at the intersection of the
planes x = 2, y = −2, and z = 1.
As we encounter other coordinate systems in Sections 1.8 and 1.9, we expect
points to be located at the common intersection of three surfaces, not necessarily
planes, but still mutually perpendicular at the point of intersection.
If we visualize three planes intersecting at the general point P, whose coordinates
are x, y, and z, we may increase each coordinate value by a differential amount and
obtain three slightly displaced planes intersecting at point P′, whose coordinates are
x + dx, y + dy, and z + dz. The six planes deﬁne a rectangular parallelepiped whose
volume is dv = dxdydz; the surfaces have differential areas dS of dxdy, dydz, and
dzdx. Finally, the distance dL from P to P′ is the diagonal of the parallelepiped and
has a length of

(dx)2 + (dy)2 + (dz)2. The volume element is shown in Figure 1.2c;
point P′ is indicated, but point P is located at the only invisible corner.
All this is familiar from trigonometry or solid geometry and as yet involves only
scalar quantities. We will describe vectors in terms of a coordinate system in the next
section.
1.4
VECTOR COMPONENTS
AND UNIT VECTORS
To describe a vector in the rectangular coordinate system, let us ﬁrst consider a vector r
extending outward from the origin. A logical way to identify this vector is by giving
the three component vectors, lying along the three coordinate axes, whose vector sum
must be the given vector. If the component vectors of the vector r are x, y, and z,
then r = x + y + z. The component vectors are shown in Figure 1.3a. Instead of one
vector, we now have three, but this is a step forward because the three vectors are of
a very simple nature; each is always directed along one of the coordinate axes.
The component vectors have magnitudes that depend on the given vector (such
as r), but they each have a known and constant direction. This suggests the use of unit
vectors having unit magnitude by deﬁnition; these are parallel to the coordinate axes
and they point in the direction of increasing coordinate values. We reserve the symbol
a for a unit vector and identify its direction by an appropriate subscript. Thus ax, ay,
and az are the unit vectors in the rectangular coordinate system.3 They are directed
along the x, y, and z axes, respectively, as shown in Figure 1.3b.
If the component vector y happens to be two units in magnitude and directed
toward increasing values of y, we should then write y = 2ay. A vector rP pointing
3 The symbols i, j, and k are also commonly used for the unit vectors in rectangular coordinates.

is equal to the vector difference rQ −rP.
from the origin to point P(1, 2, 3) is written rP = ax + 2ay + 3az. The vector from
P to Q may be obtained by applying the rule of vector addition. This rule shows
that the vector from the origin to P plus the vector from P to Q is equal to the
vector from the origin to Q. The desired vector from P(1, 2, 3) to Q(2, −2, 1) is
therefore
RP Q = rQ −rP = (2 −1)ax + (−2 −2)ay + (1 −3)az
= ax −4ay −2az
The vectors rP, rQ, and RP Q are shown in Figure 1.3c.
The last vector does not extend outward from the origin, as did the vector r we
initially considered. However, we have already learned that vectors having the same
magnitude and pointing in the same direction are equal, so we see that to help our
visualization processes we are at liberty to slide any vector over to the origin before

CHAPTER 1

determining its component vectors. Parallelism must, of course, be maintained during
the sliding process.
If we are discussing a force vector F, or indeed any vector other than a
displacement-type vector such as r, the problem arises of providing suitable letters
for the three component vectors. It would not do to call them x, y, and z, for these
are displacements, or directed distances, and are measured in meters (abbreviated m)
or some other unit of length. The problem is most often avoided by using component
scalars, simply called components, Fx, Fy, and Fz. The components are the signed
magnitudes of the component vectors. We may then write F = Fxax + Fyay + Fzaz.
The component vectors are Fxax, Fyay, and Fzaz.
Any vector B then may be described by B = Bxax + Byay + Bzaz. The magnitude
of B written |B| or simply B, is given by
|B| =

B2x + B2y + B2z
(1)
Each of the three coordinate systems we discuss will have its three fundamental
and mutually perpendicular unit vectors that are used to resolve any vector into its
component vectors. Unit vectors are not limited to this application. It is helpful to
write a unit vector having a speciﬁed direction. This is easily done, for a unit vector
in a given direction is merely a vector in that direction divided by its magnitude. A
unit vector in the r direction is r/

x2 + y2 + z2, and a unit vector in the direction of
the vector B is
aB =
B

EXAMPLE 1.1
Specify the unit vector extending from the origin toward the point G(2, −2, −1).
Solution. We ﬁrst construct the vector extending from the origin to point G,
G = 2ax −2ay −az
We continue by ﬁnding the magnitude of G,
|G| =

(2)2 + (−2)2 + (−1)2 = 3
and ﬁnally expressing the desired unit vector as the quotient,
aG = G
|G| = 2

3az = 0.667ax −0.667ay −0.333az
A special symbol is desirable for a unit vector so that its character is immediately
apparent. Symbols that have been used are uB, aB, 1B, or even b. We will consistently
use the lowercase a with an appropriate subscript.

chapters. The answers to the drill problems are given in the same order as the parts

1.5
THE VECTOR FIELD
We have deﬁned a vector ﬁeld as a vector function of a position vector. In general,
the magnitude and direction of the function will change as we move throughout the
region, and the value of the vector function must be determined using the coordinate
values of the point in question. Because we have considered only the rectangular
coordinate system, we expect the vector to be a function of the variables x, y, and z.
If we again represent the position vector as r, then a vector ﬁeld G can be
expressed in functional notation as G(r); a scalar ﬁeld T is written as T (r).
If we inspect the velocity of the water in the ocean in some region near the
surface where tides and currents are important, we might decide to represent it by
a velocity vector that is in any direction, even up or down. If the z axis is taken as
upward, the x axis in a northerly direction, the y axis to the west, and the origin at
the surface, we have a right-handed coordinate system and may write the velocity
vector as v = vxax + vyay + vzaz, or v(r) = vx(r)ax + vy(r)ay + vz(r)az; each of
the components vx, vy, and vz may be a function of the three variables x, y, and z.
If we are in some portion of the Gulf Stream where the water is moving only to the
north, then vy and vz are zero. Further simplifying assumptions might be made if
the velocity falls off with depth and changes very slowly as we move north, south,
east, or west. A suitable expression could be v = 2ez/100ax. We have a velocity of
2 m/s (meters per second) at the surface and a velocity of 0.368 × 2, or 0.736 m/s, at
a depth of 100 m (z = −100). The velocity continues to decrease with depth, while
maintaining a constant direction.

1.6
THE DOT PRODUCT
We now consider the ﬁrst of two types of vector multiplication. The second type will
be discussed in the following section.
Given two vectors A and B, the dot product, or scalar product, is deﬁned as the
product of the magnitude of A, the magnitude of B, and the cosine of the smaller
angle between them,
A · B = |A| |B| cos θAB
(3)
The dot appears between the two vectors and should be made heavy for emphasis.
The dot, or scalar, product is a scalar, as one of the names implies, and it obeys the
commutative law,
A · B = B · A
(4)
for the sign of the angle does not affect the cosine term. The expression A · B is read
“A dot B.”
Perhaps the most common application of the dot product is in mechanics, where
a constant force F applied over a straight displacement L does an amount of work
FL cos θ, which is more easily written F · L. We might anticipate one of the results
of Chapter 4 by pointing out that if the force varies along the path, integration is
necessary to ﬁnd the total work, and the result becomes
Work =

F · dL
Another example might be taken from magnetic ﬁelds. The total ﬂux  crossing
a surface of area S is given by BS if the magnetic ﬂux density B is perpendicular
to the surface and uniform over it. We deﬁne a vector surface S as having area
for its magnitude and having a direction normal to the surface (avoiding for the
moment the problem of which of the two possible normals to take). The ﬂux crossing
the surface is then B · S. This expression is valid for any direction of the uniform
magnetic ﬂux density. If the ﬂux density is not constant over the surface, the total ﬂux
is  =

B · dS. Integrals of this general form appear in Chapter 3 when we study
electric ﬂux density.
Finding the angle between two vectors in three-dimensional space is often a
job we would prefer to avoid, and for that reason the deﬁnition of the dot product is
usually not used in its basic form. A more helpful result is obtained by considering two
vectors whose rectangular components are given, such as A = Axax + Ayay + Azaz
and B = Bxax + Byay + Bzaz. The dot product also obeys the distributive law, and,
therefore, A · B yields the sum of nine scalar terms, each involving the dot product
of two unit vectors. Because the angle between two different unit vectors of the
rectangular coordinate system is 90◦, we then have
ax · ay = ay · ax = ax · az = az · ax = ay · az = az · ay = 0

10
ENGINEERING ELECTROMAGNETICS
Figure 1.4
(a) The scalar component of B in the direction of the unit vector a is
B · a. (b) The vector component of B in the direction of the unit vector a is (B · a)a.
The remaining three terms involve the dot product of a unit vector with itself, which
is unity, giving ﬁnally
A · B = Ax Bx + Ay By + Az Bz
(5)
which is an expression involving no angles.
A vector dotted with itself yields the magnitude squared, or
A · A = A2 = |A|2
(6)
and any unit vector dotted with itself is unity,
aA · aA = 1
One of the most important applications of the dot product is that of ﬁnding the
component of a vector in a given direction. Referring to Figure 1.4a, we can obtain
the component (scalar) of B in the direction speciﬁed by the unit vector a as
B · a = |B| |a| cos θBa = |B| cos θBa
The sign of the component is positive if 0 ≤θBa ≤90◦and negative whenever
90◦≤θBa ≤180◦.
To obtain the component vector of B in the direction of a, we multiply the
component (scalar) by a, as illustrated by Figure 1.4b. For example, the component
of B in the direction of ax is B · ax = Bx, and the component vector is Bxax, or
(B · ax)ax. Hence, the problem of ﬁnding the component of a vector in any direction
becomes the problem of ﬁnding a unit vector in that direction, and that we can do.
The geometrical term projection is also used with the dot product. Thus, B · a is
the projection of B in the a direction.
EXAMPLE 1.2
In order to illustrate these deﬁnitions and operations, consider the vector ﬁeld G =
yax −2.5xay +3az and the point Q(4, 5, 2). We wish to ﬁnd: G at Q; the scalar com-
ponent of G at Q in the direction of aN = 1
3(2ax + ay −2az); the vector component
of G at Q in the direction of aN; and ﬁnally, the angle θGa between G(rQ) and aN.

CHAPTER 1
Vector Analysis
11
Solution. Substituting the coordinates of point Q into the expression for G, we have
G(rQ) = 5ax −10ay + 3az
Next we ﬁnd the scalar component. Using the dot product, we have
G · aN = (5ax −10ay + 3az) · 1
3(2ax + ay −2az) = 1
3(10 −10 −6) = −2
The vector component is obtained by multiplying the scalar component by the unit
vector in the direction of aN,
(G · aN)aN = −(2) 1
3(2ax + ay −2az) = −1.333ax −0.667ay + 1.333az
The angle between G(rQ) and aN is found from
G · aN = |G| cos θGa

1.7
THE CROSS PRODUCT
Given two vectors A and B, we now deﬁne the cross product, or vector product, of A
and B, written with a cross between the two vectors as A × B and read “A cross B.”
The cross product A × B is a vector; the magnitude of A × B is equal to the product
of the magnitudes of A, B, and the sine of the smaller angle between A and B; the
direction of A×B is perpendicular to the plane containing A and B and is along one of
the two possible perpendiculars which is in the direction of advance of a right-handed
screw as A is turned into B. This direction is illustrated in Figure 1.5. Remember that
either vector may be moved about at will, maintaining its direction constant, until
the two vectors have a “common origin.” This determines the plane containing both.
However, in most of our applications we will be concerned with vectors deﬁned at
the same point.
As an equation we can write
A × B = aN|A| |B| sin θAB
(7)
where an additional statement, such as that given above, is required to explain the
direction of the unit vector aN. The subscript stands for “normal.”

The direction of A × B is in the
direction of advance of a right-handed screw

Reversing the order of the vectors A and B results in a unit vector in the opposite
direction, and we see that the cross product is not commutative, for B×A = −(A×B).
If the deﬁnition of the cross product is applied to the unit vectors ax and ay, we ﬁnd
ax × ay = az, for each vector has unit magnitude, the two vectors are perpendicular,
and the rotation of ax into ay indicates the positive z direction by the deﬁnition of a
right-handed coordinate system. In a similar way, ay × az = ax and az × ax = ay.
Note the alphabetic symmetry. As long as the three vectors ax, ay, and az are written
in order (and assuming that ax follows az, like three elephants in a circle holding tails,
so that we could also write ay, az, ax or az, ax, ay), then the cross and equal sign may
be placed in either of the two vacant spaces. As a matter of fact, it is now simpler to
deﬁne a right-handed rectangular coordinate system by saying that ax × ay = az.
A simple example of the use of the cross product may be taken from geometry
or trigonometry. To ﬁnd the area of a parallelogram, the product of the lengths of
two adjacent sides is multiplied by the sine of the angle between them. Using vector
notation for the two sides, we then may express the (scalar) area as the magnitude of
A × B, or |A × B|.
The cross product may be used to replace the right-hand rule familiar to all
electrical engineers. Consider the force on a straight conductor of length L, where
the direction assigned to L corresponds to the direction of the steady current I, and
a uniform magnetic ﬁeld of ﬂux density B is present. Using vector notation, we may
write the result neatly as F = IL × B. This relationship will be obtained later in
Chapter 9.
The evaluation of a cross product by means of its deﬁnition turns out to be more
work than the evaluation of the dot product from its deﬁnition, for not only must
we ﬁnd the angle between the vectors, but we must also ﬁnd an expression for the

unit vector aN. This work may be avoided by using rectangular components for the
two vectors A and B and expanding the cross product as a sum of nine simpler cross
products, each involving two unit vectors,
A × B = Ax Bxax × ax + Ax Byax × ay + Ax Bzax × az
+ Ay Bxay × ax + Ay Byay × ay + Ay Bzay × az
+ Az Bxaz × ax + Az Byaz × ay + Az Bzaz × az
We have already found that ax × ay = az, ay × az = ax, and az × ax = ay. The
three remaining terms are zero, for the cross product of any vector with itself is zero,
since the included angle is zero. These results may be combined to give
A × B = (Ay Bz −Az By)ax + (Az Bx −Ax Bz)ay + (Ax By −Ay Bx)az

OTHER COORDINATE SYSTEMS:
CIRCULAR CYLINDRICAL COORDINATES
The rectangular coordinate system is generally the one in which students prefer to
work every problem. This often means a lot more work, because many problems
possess a type of symmetry that pleads for a more logical treatment. It is easier to
do now, once and for all, the work required to become familiar with cylindrical and
spherical coordinates, instead of applying an equal or greater effort to every problem
involving cylindrical or spherical symmetry later. With this in mind, we will take a
careful and unhurried look at cylindrical and spherical coordinates.

14
ENGINEERING ELECTROMAGNETICS
The circular cylindrical coordinate system is the three-dimensional version of
the polar coordinates of analytic geometry. In polar coordinates, a point is located
in a plane by giving both its distance ρ from the origin and the angle φ between the
line from the point to the origin and an arbitrary radial line, taken as φ = 0.4 In
circular cylindrical coordinates, we also specify the distance z of the point from an
arbitrary z = 0 reference plane that is perpendicular to the line ρ = 0. For simplicity,
we usually refer to circular cylindrical coordinates simply as cylindrical coordinates.
This will not cause any confusion in reading this book, but it is only fair to point out
that there are such systems as elliptic cylindrical coordinates, hyperbolic cylindrical
coordinates, parabolic cylindrical coordinates, and others.
We no longer set up three axes as with rectangular coordinates, but we must
instead consider any point as the intersection of three mutually perpendicular sur-
faces. These surfaces are a circular cylinder (ρ = constant), a plane (φ = constant),
and another plane (z = constant). This corresponds to the location of a point in a
rectangular coordinate system by the intersection of three planes (x = constant, y =
constant, and z = constant). The three surfaces of circular cylindrical coordinates are
shown in Figure 1.6a. Note that three such surfaces may be passed through any point,
unless it lies on the z axis, in which case one plane sufﬁces.
Three unit vectors must also be deﬁned, but we may no longer direct them along
the “coordinate axes,” for such axes exist only in rectangular coordinates. Instead, we
take a broader view of the unit vectors in rectangular coordinates and realize that they
are directed toward increasing coordinate values and are perpendicular to the surface
on which that coordinate value is constant (i.e., the unit vector ax is normal to the
plane x = constant and points toward larger values of x). In a corresponding way we
may now deﬁne three unit vectors in cylindrical coordinates, aρ, aφ, and az.
The unit vector aρ at a point P(ρ1, φ1, z1) is directed radially outward, normal
to the cylindrical surface ρ = ρ1. It lies in the planes φ = φ1 and z = z1. The unit
vector aφ is normal to the plane φ = φ1, points in the direction of increasing φ, lies in
the plane z = z1, and is tangent to the cylindrical surface ρ = ρ1. The unit vector az
is the same as the unit vector az of the rectangular coordinate system. Figure 1.6b
shows the three vectors in cylindrical coordinates.
In rectangular coordinates, the unit vectors are not functions of the coordinates.
Two of the unit vectors in cylindrical coordinates, aρ and aφ, however, do vary with
the coordinate φ, as their directions change. In integration or differentiation with
respect to φ, then, aρ and aφ must not be treated as constants.
The unit vectors are again mutually perpendicular, for each is normal to one of the
three mutually perpendicular surfaces, and we may deﬁne a right-handed cylindrical
4 The two variables of polar coordinates are commonly called r and θ. With three coordinates,
however, it is more common to use ρ for the radius variable of cylindrical coordinates and r for the
(different) radius variable of spherical coordinates. Also, the angle variable of cylindrical coordinates is
customarily called φ because everyone uses θ for a different angle in spherical coordinates. The angle
φ is common to both cylindrical and spherical coordinates. See?

coordinate system as one in which aρ × aφ = az, or (for those who have ﬂexible
ﬁngers) as one in which the thumb, foreﬁnger, and middle ﬁnger point in the direction
of increasing ρ, φ, and z, respectively.
A differential volume element in cylindrical coordinates may be obtained by
increasing ρ, φ, and z by the differential increments dρ, dφ, and dz. The two cylinders
of radius ρ and ρ + dρ, the two radial planes at angles φ and φ + dφ, and the two
“horizontal” planes at “elevations” z and z + dz now enclose a small volume, as
shown in Figure 1.6c, having the shape of a truncated wedge. As the volume element
becomes very small, its shape approaches that of a rectangular parallelepiped having
sides of length dρ, ρdφ, and dz. Note that dρ and dz are dimensionally lengths, but
dφ is not; ρdφ is the length. The surfaces have areas of ρ dρ dφ, dρ dz, and ρ dφ dz,
and the volume becomes ρ dρ dφ dz.

Figure 1.7
The relationship between
the rectangular variables x, y, z and the
cylindrical coordinate variables ρ, φ, z.
There is no change in the variable z
between the two systems.
The variables of the rectangular and cylindrical coordinate systems are easily
related to each other. Referring to Figure 1.7, we see that
x = ρ cos φ
y = ρ sin φ
(10)
z = z
From the other viewpoint, we may express the cylindrical variables in terms of x, y,
and z:
ρ =

x2 + y2
(ρ ≥0)
φ = tan−1 y
x
(11)
z = z
We consider the variable ρ to be positive or zero, thus using only the positive sign
for the radical in (11). The proper value of the angle φ is determined by inspecting
the signs of x and y. Thus, if x = −3 and y = 4, we ﬁnd that the point lies in the
second quadrant so that ρ = 5 and φ = 126.9◦. For x = 3 and y = −4, we have
φ = −53.1◦or 306.9◦, whichever is more convenient.
Using (10) or (11), scalar functions given in one coordinate system are easily
transformed into the other system.
A vector function in one coordinate system, however, requires two steps in order
to transform it to another coordinate system, because a different set of component

CHAPTER 1
Vector Analysis
17
vectors is generally required. That is, we may be given a rectangular vector
A = Axax + Ayay + Azaz
where each component is given as a function of x, y, and z, and we need a vector in
cylindrical coordinates
A = Aρaρ + Aφaφ + Azaz
where each component is given as a function of ρ, φ, and z.
To ﬁnd any desired component of a vector, we recall from the discussion of the
dot product that a component in a desired direction may be obtained by taking the
dot product of the vector and a unit vector in the desired direction. Hence,
Aρ = A · aρ
and
Aφ = A · aφ
Expanding these dot products, we have
Aρ = (Axax + Ayay + Azaz) · aρ = Axax · aρ + Ayay · aρ
(12)
Aφ = (Axax + Ayay + Azaz) · aφ = Axax · aφ + Ayay · aφ
(13)
and
Az = (Axax + Ayay + Azaz) · az = Azaz · az = Az
(14)
since az · aρ and az · aφ are zero.
In order to complete the transformation of the components, it is necessary to
know the dot products ax · aρ, ay · aρ, ax · aφ, and ay · aφ. Applying the deﬁnition
of the dot product, we see that since we are concerned with unit vectors, the result
is merely the cosine of the angle between the two unit vectors in question. Refer-
ring to Figure 1.7 and thinking mightily, we identify the angle between ax and aρ
as φ, and thus ax · aρ = cos φ, but the angle between ay and aρ is 90◦−φ, and
ay · aρ = cos (90◦−φ) = sin φ. The remaining dot products of the unit vectors
are found in a similar manner, and the results are tabulated as functions of φ in
Table 1.1.
Transforming vectors from rectangular to cylindrical coordinates or vice versa
is therefore accomplished by using (10) or (11) to change variables, and by using the
dot products of the unit vectors given in Table 1.1 to change components. The two
steps may be taken in either order.

1.9
THE SPHERICAL COORDINATE SYSTEM
We have no two-dimensional coordinate system to help us understand the three-
dimensional spherical coordinate system, as we have for the circular cylindrical
coordinate system. In certain respects we can draw on our knowledge of the latitude-
and-longitude system of locating a place on the surface of the earth, but usually we
consider only points on the surface and not those below or above ground.
Let us start by building a spherical coordinate system on the three rectangular
axes (Figure 1.8a). We ﬁrst deﬁne the distance from the origin to any point as r. The
surface r = constant is a sphere.
The second coordinate is an angle θ between the z axis and the line drawn
from the origin to the point in question. The surface θ = constant is a cone, and
the two surfaces, cone and sphere, are everywhere perpendicular along their inter-
section, which is a circle of radius r sin θ. The coordinate θ corresponds to latitude,

coordinates: ar × aθ = aφ. (d) The differential volume element in the spherical coordinate

except that latitude is measured from the equator and θ is measured from the “North
Pole.”
The third coordinate φ is also an angle and is exactly the same as the angle φ of
cylindrical coordinates. It is the angle between the x axis and the projection in the
z = 0 plane of the line drawn from the origin to the point. It corresponds to the angle
of longitude, but the angle φ increases to the “east.” The surface φ = constant is a
plane passing through the θ = 0 line (or the z axis).
We again consider any point as the intersection of three mutually perpendicular
surfaces—a sphere, a cone, and a plane—each oriented in the manner just described.
The three surfaces are shown in Figure 1.8b.
Three unit vectors may again be deﬁned at any point. Each unit vector is per-
pendicular to one of the three mutually perpendicular surfaces and oriented in that

20
ENGINEERING ELECTROMAGNETICS
direction in which the coordinate increases. The unit vector ar is directed radially
outward, normal to the sphere r = constant, and lies in the cone θ = constant and
the plane φ = constant. The unit vector aθ is normal to the conical surface, lies in
the plane, and is tangent to the sphere. It is directed along a line of “longitude” and
points “south.” The third unit vector aφ is the same as in cylindrical coordinates, being
normal to the plane and tangent to both the cone and the sphere. It is directed to the
“east.”
The three unit vectors are shown in Figure 1.8c. They are, of course, mutually per-
pendicular, and a right-handed coordinate system is deﬁned by causing ar × aθ = aφ.
Our system is right-handed, as an inspection of Figure 1.8c will show, on application
of the deﬁnition of the cross product. The right-hand rule identiﬁes the thumb, fore-
ﬁnger, and middle ﬁnger with the direction of increasing r, θ, and φ, respectively.
(Note that the identiﬁcation in cylindrical coordinates was with ρ, φ, and z, and in
rectangular coordinates with x, y, and z.) A differential volume element may be con-
structed in spherical coordinates by increasing r, θ, and φ by dr, dθ, and dφ, as
shown in Figure 1.8d. The distance between the two spherical surfaces of radius r
and r + dr is dr; the distance between the two cones having generating angles of θ
and θ + dθ is rdθ; and the distance between the two radial planes at angles φ and
φ + dφ is found to be r sin θdφ, after a few moments of trigonometric thought. The
surfaces have areas of r dr dθ, r sin θ dr dφ, and r2 sin θ dθ dφ, and the volume is
r2 sin θ dr dθ dφ.
The transformation of scalars from the rectangular to the spherical coordinate
system is easily made by using Figure 1.8a to relate the two sets of variables:
x = r sin θ cos φ
y = r sin θ sin φ
(15)
z = r cos θ
The transformation in the reverse direction is achieved with the help of
r =

φ = tan−1 y
x
The radius variable r is nonnegative, and θ is restricted to the range from 0◦to 180◦,
inclusive. The angles are placed in the proper quadrants by inspecting the signs of
x, y, and z.
The transformation of vectors requires us to determine the products of the unit
vectors in rectangular and spherical coordinates. We work out these products from
Figure 1.8c and a pinch of trigonometry. Because the dot product of any spheri-
cal unit vector with any rectangular unit vector is the component of the spherical

vector in the direction of the rectangular vector, the dot products with az are found
to be
az · ar = cos θ
az · aθ = −sin θ
az · aφ = 0
The dot products involving ax and ay require ﬁrst the projection of the spherical
unit vector on the xy plane and then the projection onto the desired axis. For example,
ar · ax is obtained by projecting ar onto the xy plane, giving sin θ, and then projecting
sin θ on the x axis, which yields sin θ cos φ. The other dot products are found in a
like manner, and all are shown in Table 1.2.
EXAMPLE 1.4
We illustrate this procedure by transforming the vector ﬁeld G = (xz/y)ax into
spherical components and variables.
Solution. We ﬁnd the three spherical components by dotting G with the appropriate
unit vectors, and we change variables during the procedure:
Gr = G · ar = xz
y ax · ar = xz
y sin θ cos φ
= r sin θ cos θ cos2 φ
sin φ
Gθ = G · aθ = xz
y ax · aθ = xz
y cos θ cos φ
= r cos2 θ cos2 φ
sin φ
Gφ = G · aφ = xz
y ax · aφ = xz
y (−sin φ)
= −r cos θ cos φ
Collecting these results, we have
G = r cos θ cos φ (sin θ cot φ ar + cos θ cot φ aθ −aφ)

aving formulated the language of vector analysis in the ﬁrst chapter, we next
establish and describe a few basic principles of electricity. In this chapter,
we introduce Coulomb’s electrostatic force law and then formulate this in
a general way using ﬁeld theory. The tools that will be developed can be used to
solve any problem in which forces between static charges are to be evaluated or to
determine the electric ﬁeld that is associated with any charge distribution. Initially,
we will restrict the study to ﬁelds in vacuum or free space; this would apply to media
such as air and other gases. Other materials are introduced in Chapters 5 and 6 and
time-varying ﬁelds are introduced in Chapter 9. ■
2.1
THE EXPERIMENTAL LAW OF COULOMB
Records from at least 600 B.C. show evidence of the knowledge of static electricity.
The Greeks were responsible for the term electricity, derived from their word for
amber, and they spent many leisure hours rubbing a small piece of amber on their
sleeves and observing how it would then attract pieces of ﬂuff and stuff. However,
their main interest lay in philosophy and logic, not in experimental science, and it
was many centuries before the attracting effect was considered to be anything other
than magic or a “life force.”
Dr. Gilbert, physician to Her Majesty the Queen of England, was the ﬁrst to do
any true experimental work with this effect, and in 1600 he stated that glass, sulfur,
amber, and other materials, which he named, would “not only draw to themselves
straws and chaff, but all metals, wood, leaves, stone, earths, even water and oil.”
Shortly thereafter, an ofﬁcer in the French Army Engineers, Colonel Charles
Coulomb, performed an elaborate series of experiments using a delicate torsion bal-
ance, invented by himself, to determine quantitatively the force exerted between two
objects, each having a static charge of electricity. His published result bears a great
similarity to Newton’s gravitational law (discovered about a hundred years earlier).
26

CHAPTER 2
Coulomb’s Law and Electric Field Intensity
27
Coulomb stated that the force between two very small objects separated in a vacuum
or free space by a distance, which is large compared to their size, is proportional to
the charge on each and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between
them, or
F = k Q1Q2
R2
where Q1 and Q2 are the positive or negative quantities of charge, R is the separation,
and k is a proportionality constant. If the International System of Units1 (SI) is used,
Q is measured in coulombs (C), R is in meters (m), and the force should be newtons
(N). This will be achieved if the constant of proportionality k is written as
k =
1
4πϵ0
The new constant ϵ0 is called the permittivity of free space and has magnitude, mea-
sured in farads per meter (F/m),
ϵ0 = 8.854 × 10−12 ˙=
1
36π 10−9 F/m
(1)
The quantity ϵ0 is not dimensionless, for Coulomb’s law shows that it has the
label C2/N · m2. We will later deﬁne the farad and show that it has the dimensions
C2/N · m; we have anticipated this deﬁnition by using the unit F/m in equation (1).
Coulomb’s law is now
F =
Q1Q2
4πϵ0R2
(2)
The coulomb is an extremely large unit of charge, for the smallest known quantity
of charge is that of the electron (negative) or proton (positive), given in SI units as
1.602 × 10−19 C; hence a negative charge of one coulomb represents about 6 × 1018
electrons.2 Coulomb’s law shows that the force between two charges of one coulomb
each, separated by one meter, is 9 × 109 N, or about one million tons. The electron
has a rest mass of 9.109 × 10−31kg and has a radius of the order of magnitude of
3.8 × 10−15 m. This does not mean that the electron is spherical in shape, but merely
describes the size of the region in which a slowly moving electron has the greatest
probability of being found. All other known charged particles, including the proton,
have larger masses and larger radii, and occupy a probabilistic volume larger than
does the electron.
In order to write the vector form of (2), we need the additional fact (furnished
also by Colonel Coulomb) that the force acts along the line joining the two charges

units are given in Table B.1. Conversions to other systems of units are given in Table B.2, while the
preﬁxes designating powers of ten in SI appear in Table B.3.

and is repulsive if the charges are alike in sign or attractive if they are of opposite sign.
Let the vector r1 locate Q1, whereas r2 locates Q2. Then the vector R12 = r2 −r1
represents the directed line segment from Q1 to Q2, as shown in Figure 2.1. The vector
F2 is the force on Q2 and is shown for the case where Q1 and Q2 have the same sign.

EXAMPLE 2.1
We illustrate the use of the vector form of Coulomb’s law by locating a charge of
Q1 = 3 × 10−4 C at M(1, 2, 3) and a charge of Q2 = −10−4 C at N(2, 0, 5) in a
vacuum. We desire the force exerted on Q2 by Q1.
Solution. We use (3) and (4) to obtain the vector force. The vector R12 is
R12 = r2 −r1 = (2 −1)ax + (0 −2)ay + (5 −3)az = ax −2ay + 2az
leading to |R12| = 3, and the unit vector, a12 = 1
3(ax −2ay + 2az). Thus,

The magnitude of the force is 30 N, and the direction is speciﬁed by the unit
vector, which has been left in parentheses to display the magnitude of the force. The
force on Q2 may also be considered as three component forces,
F2 = −10ax + 20ay −20az

CHAPTER 2

The force expressed by Coulomb’s law is a mutual force, for each of the two
charges experiences a force of the same magnitude, although of opposite direction.

(5)
Coulomb’s law is linear, for if we multiply Q1 by a factor n, the force on Q2 is
also multiplied by the same factor n. It is also true that the force on a charge in the
presence of several other charges is the sum of the forces on that charge due to each
of the other charges acting alone.

2.2
ELECTRIC FIELD INTENSITY
If we now consider one charge ﬁxed in position, say Q1, and move a second charge
slowly around, we note that there exists everywhere a force on this second charge;
in other words, this second charge is displaying the existence of a force ﬁeld that is
associated with charge, Q1. Call this second charge a test charge Qt. The force on it
is given by Coulomb’s law,
Ft =
Q1Qt
4πϵ0R2
1t
a1t
Writing this force as a force per unit charge gives the electric ﬁeld intensity, E1 arising
from Q1:
E1 = Ft
Q1
=
Q1
4πϵ0R2
1t
a1t
(6)
E1 is interpreted as the vector force, arising from charge Q1, that acts on a unit positive
test charge. More generally, we write the deﬁning expression:
E = Ft
Qt
(7)
in which E, a vector function, is the electric ﬁeld intensity evaluated at the test charge
location that arises from all other charges in the vicinity—meaning the electric ﬁeld
arising from the test charge itself is not included in E.
The units of E would be in force per unit charge (newtons per coulomb). Again
anticipating a new dimensional quantity, the volt (V), having the label of joules per

30
ENGINEERING ELECTROMAGNETICS
coulomb (J/C), or newton-meters per coulomb (N · m/C), we measure electric ﬁeld
intensity in the practical units of volts per meter (V/m).
Now, we dispense with most of the subscripts in (6), reserving the right to use
them again any time there is a possibility of misunderstanding. The electric ﬁeld of a
single point charge becomes:
E =
Q
4πϵ0R2 aR
(8)
We remember that R is the magnitude of the vector R, the directed line segment
from the point at which the point charge Q is located to the point at which E is desired,
and aR is a unit vector in the R direction.3
We arbitrarily locate Q1 at the center of a spherical coordinate system. The unit
vector aR then becomes the radial unit vector ar, and R is r. Hence
E =
Q1
4πϵ0r2 ar
(9)
The ﬁeld has a single radial component, and its inverse-square-law relationship is
quite obvious.
If we consider a charge that is not at the origin of our coordinate system, the
ﬁeld no longer possesses spherical symmetry, and we might as well use rectangular
coordinates. For a charge Q located at the source point r′ = x′ax + y′ay + z′az, as
illustrated in Figure 2.2, we ﬁnd the ﬁeld at a general ﬁeld point r = xax+ yay + zaz
by expressing R as r −r′, and then
E(r) =
Q
4πϵ0|r −r′|2
r −r′
|r −r′| =
Q(r −r′)
4πϵ0|r −r′|3
=
Q[(x −x′)ax + (y −y′)ay + (z −z′)az]
4πϵ0[(x −x′)2 + (y −y′)2 + (z −z′)2]3/2
(10)
Earlier, we deﬁned a vector ﬁeld as a vector function of a position vector, and this is
emphasized by letting E be symbolized in functional notation by E(r).
Because the coulomb forces are linear, the electric ﬁeld intensity arising from
two point charges, Q1 at r1 and Q2 at r2, is the sum of the forces on Qt caused by
Q1 and Q2 acting alone, or
E(r) =
Q1
4πϵ0|r −r1|2 a1 +
Q2
4πϵ0|r −r2|2 a2
where a1 and a2 are unit vectors in the direction of (r −r1) and (r −r2), respectively.
The vectors r, r1, r2, r −r1, r −r2, a1, and a2 are shown in Figure 2.3.
3 We ﬁrmly intend to avoid confusing r and ar with R and aR. The ﬁrst two refer speciﬁcally to the
spherical coordinate system, whereas R and aR do not refer to any coordinate system—the choice is
still available to us.

and P4(1, −1, 0), as shown in Figure 2.4.

FIELD ARISING FROM A CONTINUOUS
VOLUME CHARGE DISTRIBUTION
If we now visualize a region of space ﬁlled with a tremendous number of charges
separated by minute distances, we see that we can replace this distribution of very
small particles with a smooth continuous distribution described by a volume charge
density, just as we describe water as having a density of 1 g/cm3 (gram per cubic
centimeter) even though it consists of atomic- and molecular-sized particles. We can
do this only if we are uninterested in the small irregularities (or ripples) in the ﬁeld
as we move from electron to electron or if we care little that the mass of the water
actually increases in small but ﬁnite steps as each new molecule is added.
This is really no limitation at all, because the end results for electrical engineers
are almost always in terms of a current in a receiving antenna, a voltage in an elec-
tronic circuit, or a charge on a capacitor, or in general in terms of some large-scale
macroscopic phenomenon. It is very seldom that we must know a current electron by
electron.4
We denote volume charge density by ρν, having the units of coulombs per cubic
meter (C/m3).
The small amount of charge Q in a small volume ν is
Q = ρνν
(12)
and we may deﬁne ρν mathematically by using a limiting process on (12),

Only one integral sign is customarily indicated, but the differential dν signiﬁes inte-

such an examination of the charge through statistical analysis.

stand a little review. The vector r from the origin locates the ﬁeld point where E is
being determined, whereas the vector r′ extends from the origin to the source point
where ρv(r′)dν′ is located. The scalar distance between the source point and the
ﬁeld point is |r −r′|, and the fraction (r −r′)/|r −r′| is a unit vector directed from
source point to ﬁeld point. The variables of integration are x′, y′, and z′ in rectangular

FIELD OF A LINE CHARGE
Up to this point we have considered two types of charge distribution, the point charge
andchargedistributedthroughoutavolumewithadensityρν C/m3.Ifwenowconsider
a ﬁlamentlike distribution of volume charge density, such as a charged conductor of
very small radius, we ﬁnd it convenient to treat the charge as a line charge of density
ρL C/m.
We assume a straight-line charge extending along the z axis in a cylindrical
coordinate system from −∞to ∞, as shown in Figure 2.6. We desire the electric
ﬁeld intensity E at any and every point resulting from a uniform line charge density ρL.

36
ENGINEERING ELECTROMAGNETICS
Figure 2.6
The contribution dE = dEρaρ+
dEzaz to the electric field intensity produced by an
element of charge dQ = ρLdz′ located a distance
z′ from the origin. The linear charge density is
uniform and extends along the entire z axis.
Symmetry should always be considered ﬁrst in order to determine two speciﬁc
factors: (1) with which coordinates the ﬁeld does not vary, and (2) which compo-
nents of the ﬁeld are not present. The answers to these questions then tell us which
components are present and with which coordinates they do vary.
Referring to Figure 2.6, we realize that as we move around the line charge,
varying φ while keeping ρ and z constant, the line charge appears the same from
every angle. In other words, azimuthal symmetry is present, and no ﬁeld component
may vary with φ.
Again, if we maintain ρ and φ constant while moving up and down the line charge
by changing z, the line charge still recedes into inﬁnite distance in both directions
and the problem is unchanged. This is axial symmetry and leads to ﬁelds that are not
functions of z.
If we maintain φ and z constant and vary ρ, the problem changes, and Coulomb’s
law leads us to expect the ﬁeld to become weaker as ρ increases. Hence, by a process
of elimination we are led to the fact that the ﬁeld varies only with ρ.
Now, which components are present? Each incremental length of line charge
acts as a point charge and produces an incremental contribution to the electric ﬁeld
intensity which is directed away from the bit of charge (assuming a positive line
charge). No element of charge produces a φ component of electric intensity; Eφ is
zero. However, each element does produce an Eρ and an Ez component, but the
contribution to Ez by elements of charge that are equal distances above and below
the point at which we are determining the ﬁeld will cancel.

CHAPTER 2
Coulomb’s Law and Electric Field Intensity
37
We therefore have found that we have only an Eρ component and it varies only
with ρ. Now to ﬁnd this component.
We choose a point P(0, y, 0) on the y axis at which to determine the ﬁeld.
This is a perfectly general point in view of the lack of variation of the ﬁeld with φ
and z. Applying (10) to ﬁnd the incremental ﬁeld at P due to the incremental charge
dQ = ρLdz′, we have
dE = ρLdz′(r −r′)
4πϵ0|r −r′|3
where
r = yay = ρaρ
r′ = z′az
and
r −r′ = ρaρ −z′az
Therefore,
dE = ρLdz′(ρaρ −z′az)
4πϵ0(ρ2 + z′2)3/2
Because only the Eρ component is present, we may simplify:
dEρ =
ρLρdz′
4πϵ0(ρ2 + z′2)3/2
and
Eρ =

ρLρdz′

(16)
We note that the ﬁeld falls off inversely with the distance to the charged line, as
compared with the point charge, where the ﬁeld decreased with the square of the
distance. Moving ten times as far from a point charge leads to a ﬁeld only 1 percent
the previous strength, but moving ten times as far from a line charge only reduces
the ﬁeld to 10 percent of its former value. An analogy can be drawn with a source of

illumination, for the light intensity from a point source of light also falls off inversely
as the square of the distance to the source. The ﬁeld of an inﬁnitely long ﬂuorescent
tube thus decays inversely as the ﬁrst power of the radial distance to the tube, and we
should expect the light intensity about a ﬁnite-length tube to obey this law near the
tube. As our point recedes farther and farther from a ﬁnite-length tube, however, it

Before leaving this introductory look at the ﬁeld of the inﬁnite line charge, we
should recognize the fact that not all line charges are located along the z axis. As an
example, let us consider an inﬁnite line charge parallel to the z axis at x = 6, y = 8,
shown in Figure 2.7. We wish to ﬁnd E at the general ﬁeld point P(x, y, z).
We replace ρ in (16) by the radial distance between the line charge and point,
P, R =

(x −6)2 + (y −8)2, and let aρ be aR. Thus,
E =

(x −6)2 + (y −8)2 aR
where
aR = R
|R| = (x −6)ax + (y −8)ay

Therefore,
E =

We again note that the ﬁeld is not a function of z.

the line charge as one example.

FIELD OF A SHEET OF CHARGE
Another basic charge conﬁguration is the inﬁnite sheet of charge having a uniform
density of ρS C/m2. Such a charge distribution may often be used to approximate
that found on the conductors of a strip transmission line or a parallel-plate capacitor.
As we shall see in Chapter 5, static charge resides on conductor surfaces and not
in their interiors; for this reason, ρS is commonly known as surface charge density.
The charge-distribution family now is complete—point, line, surface, and volume, or
Q, ρL, ρS, and ρν.
Let us place a sheet of charge in the yz plane and again consider symmetry
(Figure 2.8). We see ﬁrst that the ﬁeld cannot vary with y or with z, and then we see
thatthe y and z componentsarisingfromdifferentialelementsofchargesymmetrically
located with respect to the point at which we evaluate the ﬁeld will cancel. Hence
only Ex is present, and this component is a function of x alone. We are again faced
with a choice of many methods by which to evaluate this component, and this time we
use only one method and leave the others as exercises for a quiet Sunday afternoon.
Let us use the ﬁeld of the inﬁnite line charge (16) by dividing the inﬁnite sheet
into differential-width strips. One such strip is shown in Figure 2.8. The line charge

density, or charge per unit length, is ρL = ρS dy′, and the distance from this line
charge to our general point P on the x axis is R =

for the ﬁeld is always directed away from the positive charge. This difﬁculty in sign
is usually overcome by specifying a unit vector aN, which is normal to the sheet and
directed outward, or away from it. Then

(17)
This is a startling answer, for the ﬁeld is constant in magnitude and direction.
It is just as strong a million miles away from the sheet as it is right off the surface.
Returning to our light analogy, we see that a uniform source of light on the ceiling of
a very large room leads to just as much illumination on a square foot on the ﬂoor as it
does on a square foot a few inches below the ceiling. If you desire greater illumination
on this subject, it will do you no good to hold the book closer to such a light source.
If a second inﬁnite sheet of charge, having a negative charge density −ρS, is
located in the plane x = a, we may ﬁnd the total ﬁeld by adding the contribution of
each sheet. In the region x > a,

STREAMLINES AND SKETCHES
OF FIELDS
We now have vector equations for the electric ﬁeld intensity resulting from several
different charge conﬁgurations, and we have had little difﬁculty in interpreting the
magnitude and direction of the ﬁeld from the equations. Unfortunately, this simplicity
cannot last much longer, for we have solved most of the simple cases and our new
charge distributions must lead to more complicated expressions for the ﬁelds and
more difﬁculty in visualizing the ﬁelds through the equations. However, it is true that
one picture would be worth about a thousand words, if we just knew what picture to
draw.
Consider the ﬁeld about the line charge,
E =
ρL
2πϵ0ρ aρ
Figure 2.9a shows a cross-sectional view of the line charge and presents what might
be our ﬁrst effort at picturing the ﬁeld—short line segments drawn here and there
having lengths proportional to the magnitude of E and pointing in the direction of E.
The ﬁgure fails to show the symmetry with respect to φ, so we try again in Figure 2.9b
with a symmetrical location of the line segments. The real trouble now appears—the
longest lines must be drawn in the most crowded region, and this also plagues us
if we use line segments of equal length but of a thickness that is proportional to E
(Figure 2.9c). Other schemes include drawing shorter lines to represent stronger ﬁelds
(inherently misleading) and using intensity of color or different colors to represent
stronger ﬁelds.
For the present, let us be content to show only the direction of E by drawing
continuous lines, which are everywhere tangent to E, from the charge. Figure 2.9d
shows this compromise. A symmetrical distribution of lines (one every 45◦) indicates
azimuthal symmetry, and arrowheads should be used to show direction.
These lines are usually called streamlines, although other terms such as ﬂux lines
and direction lines are also used. A small positive test charge placed at any point in
this ﬁeld and free to move would accelerate in the direction of the streamline passing
through that point. If the ﬁeld represented the velocity of a liquid or a gas (which,
incidentally, would have to have a source at ρ = 0), small suspended particles in the
liquid or gas would trace out the streamlines.

42
ENGINEERING ELECTROMAGNETICS
Figure 2.9
(a) One very poor sketch, (b) and (c) two fair sketches, and
(d ) the usual form of a streamline sketch. In the last form, the arrows show
the direction of the field at every point along the line, and the spacing of the
lines is inversely proportional to the strength of the field.
We will ﬁnd out later that a bonus accompanies this streamline sketch, for the
magnitude of the ﬁeld can be shown to be inversely proportional to the spacing of
the streamlines for some important special cases. The closer they are together, the
stronger is the ﬁeld. At that time we will also ﬁnd an easier, more accurate method
of making that type of streamline sketch.
If we attempted to sketch the ﬁeld of the point charge, the variation of the ﬁeld
into and away from the page would cause essentially insurmountable difﬁculties; for
this reason sketching is usually limited to two-dimensional ﬁelds.
In the case of the two-dimensional ﬁeld, let us arbitrarily set Ez = 0. The
streamlines are thus conﬁned to planes for which z is constant, and the sketch is the
same for any such plane. Several streamlines are shown in Figure 2.10, and the Ex and
Ey components are indicated at a general point. It is apparent from the geometry that
Ey
Ex
= dy

(19)
A knowledge of the functional form of Ex and Ey (and the ability to solve the resultant
differential equation) will enable us to obtain the equations of the streamlines.

Figure 2.10
The equation of a streamline is
obtained by solving the differential equation
E y/Ex = dy/dx.
As an illustration of this method, consider the ﬁeld of the uniform line charge
with ρL = 2πϵ0,
E = 1

In rectangular coordinates,
E =

x2 + y2 ax +

Thus we form the differential equation

or

y = dx
x
Therefore,
ln y = ln x + C1
or
ln y = ln x + ln C
from which the equations of the streamlines are obtained,
y = Cx
If we want to ﬁnd the equation of one particular streamline, say one passing
through P(−2, 7, 10), we merely substitute the coordinates of that point into our
equation and evaluate C. Here, 7 = C(−2), and C = −3.5, so y = −3.5x.
Each streamline is associated with a speciﬁc value of C, and the radial lines
shown in Figure 2.9d are obtained when C = 0, 1, −1, and 1/C = 0.
The equations of streamlines may also be obtained directly in cylindrical or
sphericalcoordinates.AsphericalcoordinateexamplewillbeexaminedinSection4.7.

A
fter drawing a few of the ﬁelds described in the previous chapter and becom-
ing familiar with the concept of the streamlines that show the direction of
the force on a test charge at every point, it is difﬁcult to avoid giving these
lines a physical signiﬁcance and thinking of them as ﬂux lines. No physical particle
is projected radially outward from the point charge, and there are no steel tentacles
reaching out to attract or repel an unwary test charge, but as soon as the streamlines
are drawn on paper there seems to be a picture showing “something” is present.
It is very helpful to invent an electric ﬂux that streams away symmetrically from a
point charge and is coincident with the streamlines and to visualize this ﬂux wherever
an electric ﬁeld is present.
This chapter introduces and uses the concept of electric ﬂux and electric ﬂux
density to again solve several of the problems presented in Chapter 2. The work here
turns out to be much easier, and this is due to the extremely symmetrical problems
that we are solving. ■
3.1
ELECTRIC FLUX DENSITY
About 1837, the director of the Royal Society in London, Michael Faraday, became
very interested in static electric ﬁelds and the effect of various insulating materials on
these ﬁelds. This problem had been bothering him during the past ten years when he
was experimenting in his now-famous work on induced electromotive force, which
we will discuss in Chapter 10. With that subject completed, he had a pair of concentric
metallicspheresconstructed,theouteroneconsistingoftwohemispheresthatcouldbe
ﬁrmly clamped together. He also prepared shells of insulating material (or dielectric
material, or simply dielectric) that would occupy the entire volume between the
concentric spheres. We will immediately use his ﬁndings about dielectric materials,
48

CHAPTER 3
Electric Flux Density, Gauss’s Law, and Divergence
49
for we are restricting our attention to ﬁelds in free space until Chapter 6. At that time
we will see that the materials he used will be classiﬁed as ideal dielectrics.
His experiment, then, consisted essentially of the following steps:
1.
With the equipment dismantled, the inner sphere was given a known positive
charge.
2.
The hemispheres were then clamped together around the charged sphere with
about 2 cm of dielectric material between them.
3.
The outer sphere was discharged by connecting it momentarily to ground.
4.
The outer space was separated carefully, using tools made of insulating material
in order not to disturb the induced charge on it, and the negative induced charge
on each hemisphere was measured.
Faraday found that the total charge on the outer sphere was equal in magnitude to
the original charge placed on the inner sphere and that this was true regardless of the
dielectric material separating the two spheres. He concluded that there was some sort
of “displacement” from the inner sphere to the outer which was independent of the
medium, and we now refer to this ﬂux as displacement, displacement ﬂux, or simply
electric ﬂux.
Faraday’s experiments also showed, of course, that a larger positive charge on the
inner sphere induced a correspondingly larger negative charge on the outer sphere,
leading to a direct proportionality between the electric ﬂux and the charge on the inner
sphere. The constant of proportionality is dependent on the system of units involved,
and we are fortunate in our use of SI units, because the constant is unity. If electric
ﬂux is denoted by  (psi) and the total charge on the inner sphere by Q, then for
Faraday’s experiment
 = Q
and the electric ﬂux  is measured in coulombs.
We can obtain more quantitative information by considering an inner sphere of
radius a and an outer sphere of radius b, with charges of Q and −Q, respectively
(Figure 3.1). The paths of electric ﬂux  extending from the inner sphere to the outer
sphere are indicated by the symmetrically distributed streamlines drawn radially from
one sphere to the other.
At the surface of the inner sphere,  coulombs of electric ﬂux are produced by the
charge Q(= ) Cs distributed uniformly over a surface having an area of 4πa2 m2.
The density of the ﬂux at this surface is /4πa2 or Q/4πa2 C/m2, and this is an
important new quantity.
Electric ﬂux density, measured in coulombs per square meter (sometimes de-
scribed as “lines per square meter,” for each line is due to one coulomb), is given
the letter D, which was originally chosen because of the alternate names of displace-
ment ﬂux density or displacement density. Electric ﬂux density is more descriptive,
however, and we will use the term consistently.
The electric ﬂux density D is a vector ﬁeld and is a member of the “ﬂux density”
class of vector ﬁelds, as opposed to the “force ﬁelds” class, which includes the electric

magnitude of D are not functions of the dielectric
between the spheres.
ﬁeld intensity E. The direction of D at a point is the direction of the ﬂux lines at that
point, and the magnitude is given by the number of ﬂux lines crossing a surface normal
to the lines divided by the surface area.
Referring again to Figure 3.1, the electric ﬂux density is in the radial direction
and has a value of

and at a radial distance r, where a ≤r ≤b,

If we now let the inner sphere become smaller and smaller, while still retaining a
charge of Q, it becomes a point charge in the limit, but the electric ﬂux density at a
point r meters from the point charge is still given by
D =

for Q lines of ﬂux are symmetrically directed outward from the point and pass through
an imaginary spherical surface of area 4πr2.

In free space, therefore,
D = ϵ0E
(free space only)
(2)
Although (2) is applicable only to a vacuum, it is not restricted solely to the ﬁeld of
a point charge. For a general volume charge distribution in free space,
E =

vol
ρνdv
4πϵ0R2 aR
(free space only)
(3)
where this relationship was developed from the ﬁeld of a single point charge. In a
similar manner, (1) leads to
D =

vol
ρνdv
4πR2 aR
(4)
and (2) is therefore true for any free-space charge conﬁguration; we will consider (2)
as deﬁning D in free space.
As a preparation for the study of dielectrics later, it might be well to point out now
that, for a point charge embedded in an inﬁnite ideal dielectric medium, Faraday’s
results show that (1) is still applicable, and thus so is (4). Equation (3) is not applicable,
however, and so the relationship between D and E will be slightly more complicated
than (2).
Because D is directly proportional to E in free space, it does not seem that it
should really be necessary to introduce a new symbol. We do so for a few reasons.
First, D is associated with the ﬂux concept, which is an important new idea. Second,
the D ﬁelds we obtain will be a little simpler than the corresponding E ﬁelds, because
ϵ0 does not appear.

GAUSS’S LAW
The results of Faraday’s experiments with the concentric spheres could be summed up
as an experimental law by stating that the electric ﬂux passing through any imaginary
spherical surface lying between the two conducting spheres is equal to the charge
enclosed within that imaginary surface. This enclosed charge is distributed on the
surface of the inner sphere, or it might be concentrated as a point charge at the center
of the imaginary sphere. However, because one coulomb of electric ﬂux is produced
by one coulomb of charge, the inner conductor might just as well have been a cube or a
brass door key and the total induced charge on the outer sphere would still be the same.
Certainly the ﬂux density would change from its previous symmetrical distribution
to some unknown conﬁguration, but +Q coulombs on any inner conductor would
produce an induced charge of −Q coulombs on the surrounding sphere. Going one
step further, we could now replace the two outer hemispheres by an empty (but
completely closed) soup can. Q coulombs on the brass door key would produce
 = Q lines of electric ﬂux and would induce −Q coulombs on the tin can.1
These generalizations of Faraday’s experiment lead to the following statement,
which is known as Gauss’s law:
The electric ﬂux passing through any closed surface is equal to the total charge enclosed
by that surface.
The contribution of Gauss, one of the greatest mathematicians the world has
ever produced, was actually not in stating the law as we have, but in providing a
mathematical form for this statement, which we will now obtain.
Let us imagine a distribution of charge, shown as a cloud of point charges in
Figure 3.2, surrounded by a closed surface of any shape. The closed surface may be
the surface of some real material, but more generally it is any closed surface we wish
to visualize. If the total charge is Q, then Q coulombs of electric ﬂux will pass through
the enclosing surface. At every point on the surface the electric-ﬂux-density vector
D will have some value DS, where the subscript S merely reminds us that D must be
evaluated at the surface, and DS will in general vary in magnitude and direction from
one point on the surface to another.
We must now consider the nature of an incremental element of the surface. An
incremental element of area S is very nearly a portion of a plane surface, and
the complete description of this surface element requires not only a statement of its
magnitude S but also of its orientation in space. In other words, the incremental
surface element is a vector quantity. The only unique direction that may be associated
with S is the direction of the normal to that plane which is tangent to the surface
at the point in question. There are, of course, two such normals, and the ambiguity
is removed by specifying the outward normal whenever the surface is closed and
“outward” has a speciﬁc meaning.
1 If it were a perfect insulator, the soup could even be left in the can without any difference in the results.

CHAPTER 3

Figure 3.2
The electric flux density DS at P arising
from charge Q. The total flux passing through S is
DS · S.
At any point P, consider an incremental element of surface S and let DS make
an angle θ with S, as shown in Figure 3.2. The ﬂux crossing S is then the product
of the normal component of DS and S,
 = ﬂux crossing S = DS,normS = DS cos θS = DS · S
where we are able to apply the deﬁnition of the dot product developed in Chapter 1.
The total ﬂux passing through the closed surface is obtained by adding the dif-
ferential contributions crossing each surface element S,
 =

d =

surface
DS · dS
The resultant integral is a closed surface integral, and since the surface element
dS always involves the differentials of two coordinates, such as dx dy, ρ dφ dρ,
or r2 sin θ dθ dφ, the integral is a double integral. Usually only one integral sign is
used for brevity, and we will always place an S below the integral sign to indicate
a surface integral, although this is not actually necessary, as the differential dS is
automatically the signal for a surface integral. One last convention is to place a small
circle on the integral sign itself to indicate that the integration is to be performed over
a closed surface. Such a surface is often called a gaussian surface. We then have the
mathematical formulation of Gauss’s law,
 =

DS · dS = charge enclosed = Q

The charge enclosed might be several point charges, in which case

or a surface charge,
Q =

(not necessarily a closed surface)
or a volume charge distribution,
Q =

The last form is usually used, and we should agree now that it represents any or
all of the other forms. With this understanding, Gauss’s law may be written in terms
of the charge distribution as

a mathematical statement meaning simply that the total electric ﬂux through any
closed surface is equal to the charge enclosed.
EXAMPLE 3.1
To illustrate the application of Gauss’s law, let us check the results of Faraday’s
experiment by placing a point charge Q at the origin of a spherical coordinate system
(Figure 3.3) and by choosing our closed surface as a sphere of radius a.

APPLICATION OF GAUSS’S LAW: SOME
SYMMETRICAL CHARGE DISTRIBUTIONS
We now consider how we may use Gauss’s law,
Q =

S
DS · dS
to determine DS if the charge distribution is known. This is an example of an integral
equation in which the unknown quantity to be determined appears inside the integral.
The solution is easy if we are able to choose a closed surface which satisﬁes two
conditions:
1.
DS is everywhere either normal or tangential to the closed surface, so that
DS · dS becomes either DSdS or zero, respectively.
2.
On that portion of the closed surface for which DS · dS is not zero, DS =
constant.
This allows us to replace the dot product with the product of the scalars DS and
dS and then to bring DS outside the integral sign. The remaining integral is then

S dS over that portion of the closed surface which DS crosses normally, and this is
simply the area of this section of that surface. Only a knowledge of the symmetry of
the problem enables us to choose such a closed surface.
Let us again consider a point charge Q at the origin of a spherical coordinate
system and decide on a suitable closed surface which will meet the two requirements
previously listed. The surface in question is obviously a spherical surface, centered
at the origin and of any radius r. DS is everywhere normal to the surface; DS has the
same value at all points on the surface.
Then we have, in order,
Q =

Because r may have any value and because DS is directed radially outward,
D =
Q
4πr2 ar
E =
Q
4πϵ0r2 ar

CHAPTER 3
Electric Flux Density, Gauss’s Law, and Divergence
57
which agrees with the results of Chapter 2. The example is a trivial one, and the
objection could be raised that we had to know that the ﬁeld was symmetrical and
directed radially outward before we could obtain an answer. This is true, and that
leaves the inverse-square-law relationship as the only check obtained from Gauss’s
law. The example does, however, serve to illustrate a method which we may apply
to other problems, including several to which Coulomb’s law is almost incapable of
supplying an answer.
Are there any other surfaces which would have satisﬁed our two conditions? The
student should determine that such simple surfaces as a cube or a cylinder do not meet
the requirements.
As a second example, let us reconsider the uniform line charge distribution ρL
lying along the z axis and extending from −∞to +∞. We must ﬁrst know the
symmetry of the ﬁeld, and we may consider this knowledge complete when the
answers to these two questions are known:
1.
With which coodinates does the ﬁeld vary (or of what variables is D a function)?
2.
Which components of D are present?
In using Gauss’s law, it is not a question of using symmetry to simplify the
solution, for the application of Gauss’s law depends on symmetry, and if we cannot
show that symmetry exists then we cannot use Gauss’s law to obtain a solution. The
preceding two questions now become “musts.”
From our previous discussion of the uniform line charge, it is evident that only
the radial component of D is present, or
D = Dρaρ
and this component is a function of ρ only.
Dρ = f (ρ)
The choice of a closed surface is now simple, for a cylindrical surface is the only
surface to which Dρ is everywhere normal, and it may be closed by plane surfaces
normal to the z axis. A closed right circular cylinder of radius ρ extending from z = 0
to z = L is shown in Figure 3.4.

giving
Dρ = ρL
2πρ
or
Eρ =

2πϵ0ρ
Comparing with Section 2.4, Eq. (16), shows that the correct result has been
obtained and with much less work. Once the appropriate surface has been chosen, the
integration usually amounts only to writing down the area of the surface at which D
is normal.
The problem of a coaxial cable is almost identical with that of the line charge and
is an example that is extremely difﬁcult to solve from the standpoint of Coulomb’s
law. Suppose that we have two coaxial cylindrical conductors, the inner of radius a
and the outer of radius b, each inﬁnite in extent (Figure 3.5). We will assume a charge
distribution of ρS on the outer surface of the inner conductor.
Symmetry considerations show us that only the Dρ component is present and
that it can be a function only of ρ. A right circular cylinder of length L and radius ρ,
where a < ρ < b, is necessarily chosen as the gaussian surface, and we quickly have
Q = DS2πρL

CHAPTER 3
Electric Flux Density, Gauss’s Law, and Divergence
59
Figure 3.5
The two coaxial
cylindrical conductors forming a
coaxial cable provide an electric
flux density within the cylinders,
given by Dρ = aρS/ρ.
The total charge on a length L of the inner conductor is

 2π
φ=0
ρSa dφ dz = 2πaLρS
from which we have
DS = aρS
ρ
D = aρS
ρ aρ
(a < ρ < b)
This result might be expressed in terms of charge per unit length because the inner
conductor has 2πaρS coulombs on a meter length, and hence, letting ρL = 2πaρS,
D = ρL
2πρ aρ
and the solution has a form identical with that of the inﬁnite line charge.
Because every line of electric ﬂux starting from the charge on the inner cylinder
must terminate on a negative charge on the inner surface of the outer cylinder, the
total charge on that surface must be
Qouter cyl = −2πaLρS,inner cyl
and the surface charge on the outer cylinder is found as
2πbLρS,outer cyl = −2πaLρS,inner cyl
or
ρS,outer cyl = −a
b ρS,inner cyl
What would happen if we should use a cylinder of radius ρ, ρ > b, for the
gaussian surface? The total charge enclosed would then be zero, for there are equal
and opposite charges on each conducting cylinder. Hence
0 = DS2πρL
(ρ > b)
DS = 0
(ρ > b)

60
ENGINEERING ELECTROMAGNETICS
An identical result would be obtained for ρ < a. Thus the coaxial cable or
capacitor has no external ﬁeld (we have proved that the outer conductor is a “shield”),
and there is no ﬁeld within the center conductor.
Our result is also useful for a ﬁnite length of coaxial cable, open at both ends, pro-
vided the length L is many times greater than the radius b so that the nonsymmetrical
conditions at the two ends do not appreciably affect the solution. Such a device is
also termed a coaxial capacitor. Both the coaxial cable and the coaxial capacitor will
appear frequently in the work that follows.
EXAMPLE 3.2
Let us select a 50-cm length of coaxial cable having an inner radius of 1 mm and an
outer radius of 4 mm. The space between conductors is assumed to be ﬁlled with air.
The total charge on the inner conductor is 30 nC. We wish to know the charge density
on each conductor, and the E and D ﬁelds.
Solution. We begin by ﬁnding the surface charge density on the inner cylinder,
ρS,inner cyl = Qinner cyl
2πaL
=
30 × 10−9
2π(10−3)(0.5) = 9.55 µC/m2
The negative charge density on the inner surface of the outer cylinder is
ρS,outer cyl = Qouter cyl
2πbL
=
−30 × 10−9
2π(4 × 10−3)(0.5) = −2.39 µC/m2
The internal ﬁelds may therefore be calculated easily:

Both of these expressions apply to the region where 1 < ρ < 4 mm. For ρ < 1 mm
or ρ > 4 mm, E and D are zero.

3.4
APPLICATION OF GAUSS’S LAW:
DIFFERENTIAL VOLUME ELEMENT
We are now going to apply the methods of Gauss’s law to a slightly different type
of problem—one that does not possess any symmetry at all. At ﬁrst glance, it might
seem that our case is hopeless, for without symmetry, a simple gaussian surface cannot
be chosen such that the normal component of D is constant or zero everywhere on
the surface. Without such a surface, the integral cannot be evaluated. There is only
one way to circumvent these difﬁculties and that is to choose such a very small
closed surface that D is almost constant over the surface, and the small change in
D may be adequately represented by using the ﬁrst two terms of the Taylor’s-series
expansion for D. The result will become more nearly correct as the volume enclosed
by the gaussian surface decreases, and we intend eventually to allow this volume to
approach zero.
This example also differs from the preceding ones in that we will not obtain the
value of D as our answer but will instead receive some extremely valuable information
about the way D varies in the region of our small surface. This leads directly to one
of Maxwell’s four equations, which are basic to all electromagnetic theory.
Let us consider any point P, shown in Figure 3.6, located by a rectangular
coordinate system. The value of D at the point P may be expressed in rectangular
components, D0 = Dx0ax + Dy0ay + Dz0az. We choose as our closed surface the
small rectangular box, centered at P, having sides of lengths x, y, and z, and
apply Gauss’s law,

in which the charge density, ρν, is identiﬁed in the second equality.

(10)
where A could represent velocity, temperature gradient, force, or any other vector
ﬁeld.
This operation appeared so many times in physical investigations in the last cen-
tury that it received a descriptive name, divergence. The divergence of A is deﬁned as
Divergence of A = div A = lim
ν→0
	
S A · dS
ν
(11)
and is usually abbreviated div A. The physical interpretation of the divergence of a
vector is obtained by describing carefully the operations implied by the right-hand
side of (11), where we shall consider A to be a member of the ﬂux-density family of
vectors in order to aid the physical interpretation.
The divergence of the vector ﬂux density A is the outﬂow of ﬂux from a small closed surface
per unit volume as the volume shrinks to zero.
The physical interpretation of divergence afforded by this statement is often
useful in obtaining qualitative information about the divergence of a vector ﬁeld
without resorting to a mathematical investigation. For instance, let us consider the
divergence of the velocity of water in a bathtub after the drain has been opened. The
net outﬂow of water through any closed surface lying entirely within the water must
be zero, for water is essentially incompressible, and the water entering and leaving

CHAPTER 3
Electric Flux Density, Gauss’s Law, and Divergence
65
different regions of the closed surface must be equal. Hence the divergence of this
velocity is zero.
If, however, we consider the velocity of the air in a tire that has just been punc-
tured by a nail, we realize that the air is expanding as the pressure drops, and that
consequently there is a net outﬂow from any closed surface lying within the tire. The
divergence of this velocity is therefore greater than zero.
A positive divergence for any vector quantity indicates a source of that vector
quantity at that point. Similarly, a negative divergence indicates a sink. Because the
divergenceofthewatervelocityaboveiszero,nosourceorsinkexists.3 Theexpanding
air, however, produces a positive divergence of the velocity, and each interior point
may be considered a source.
Writing (9) with our new term, we have
div D =
∂Dx
∂x + ∂Dy
∂y + ∂Dz
∂z

(rectangular)
(12)
This expression is again of a form that does not involve the charge density. It is the
result of applying the deﬁnition of divergence (11) to a differential volume element
in rectangular coordinates.
If a differential volume unit ρ dρ dφ dz in cylindrical coordinates, or r2 sin θ dr
dθ dφ in spherical coordinates, had been chosen, expressions for divergence involving
the components of the vector in the particular coordinate system and involving partial
derivatives with respect to the variables of that system would have been obtained.
These expressions are obtained in Appendix A and are given here for convenience:

These relationships are also shown inside the back cover for easy reference.
It should be noted that the divergence is an operation which is performed on a
vector, but that the result is a scalar. We should recall that, in a somewhat similar way,
the dot or scalar product was a multiplication of two vectors which yielded a scalar.
For some reason, it is a common mistake on meeting divergence for the ﬁrst
time to impart a vector quality to the operation by scattering unit vectors around in
3 Having chosen a differential element of volume within the water, the gradual decrease in water level
with time will eventually cause the volume element to lie above the surface of the water. At the instant
the surface of the water intersects the volume element, the divergence is positive and the small volume
is a source. This complication is avoided above by specifying an integral point.

the partial derivatives. Divergence merely tells us how much ﬂux is leaving a small
volume on a per-unit-volume basis; no direction is associated with it.
We can illustrate the concept of divergence by continuing with the example at
the end of Section 3.4.
EXAMPLE 3.4
Find div D at the origin if D = e−x sin y ax −e−x cos y ay + 2zaz.
Solution. We use (10) to obtain
div D = ∂Dx
∂x + ∂Dy
∂y + ∂Dz
∂z
= −e−x sin y + e−x sin y + 2 = 2
The value is the constant 2, regardless of location.
If the units of D are C/m2, then the units of div D are C/m3. This is a volume charge
density, a concept discussed in the next section.
D3.7. In each of the following parts, ﬁnd a numerical value for div D at the
point speciﬁed: (a) D = (2xyz −y2)ax + (x2z −2xy)ay + x2yazC/m2 at

PB(ρ = 2, φ = 110◦, z = −1); (c) D = 2r sin θ cos φ ar + r cos θ cos φ aθ −
r sin φ aφ C/m2 at PC(r = 1.5, θ = 30◦, φ = 50◦).
Ans. −10.00; 9.06; 1.29
Finally, we can combine Eqs. (9) and (12) and form the relation between electric
ﬂux density and charge density:
div D = ρν
(15)
This is the ﬁrst of Maxwell’s four equations as they apply to electrostatics and
steady magnetic ﬁelds, and it states that the electric ﬂux per unit volume leaving a
vanishingly small volume unit is exactly equal to the volume charge density there.
This equation is aptly called the point form of Gauss’s law. Gauss’s law relates the ﬂux
leaving any closed surface to the charge enclosed, and Maxwell’s ﬁrst equation makes
an identical statement on a per-unit-volume basis for a vanishingly small volume, or
at a point. Because the divergence may be expressed as the sum of three partial
derivatives, Maxwell’s ﬁrst equation is also described as the differential-equation
form of Gauss’s law, and conversely, Gauss’s law is recognized as the integral form
of Maxwell’s ﬁrst equation.
As a speciﬁc illustration, let us consider the divergence of D in the region about
a point charge Q located at the origin. We have the ﬁeld
D =
Q

Thus, ρν = 0 everywhere except at the origin, where it is inﬁnite.
The divergence operation is not limited to electric ﬂux density; it can be applied
to any vector ﬁeld. We will apply it to several other electromagnetic ﬁelds in the
coming chapters.

3.6
THE VECTOR OPERATOR ∇
AND THE DIVERGENCE THEOREM
If we remind ourselves again that divergence is an operation on a vector yielding a
scalar result, just as the dot product of two vectors gives a scalar result, it seems possi-
ble that we can ﬁnd something that may be dotted formally with D to yield the scalar
∂Dx
∂x + ∂Dy
∂y + ∂Dz
∂z
Obviously, this cannot be accomplished by using a dot product; the process must be
a dot operation.
With this in mind, we deﬁne the del operator ∇as a vector operator,
∇= ∂
∂x ax + ∂
∂y ay + ∂
∂z az
(16)
Similar scalar operators appear in several methods of solving differential equations
where we often let D replace d/dx, D2 replace d2/dx2, and so forth.4 We agree on
deﬁning ∇that it shall be treated in every way as an ordinary vector with the one
important exception that partial derivatives result instead of products of scalars.
Consider ∇· D, signifying
∇· D =
 ∂
∂x ax + ∂
∂y ay + ∂
∂z az

· (Dxax + Dyay + Dzaz)
4 This scalar operator D, which will not appear again, is not to be confused with the electric ﬂux density.

68
ENGINEERING ELECTROMAGNETICS
We ﬁrst consider the dot products of the unit vectors, discarding the six zero terms,
and obtain the result that we recognize as the divergence of D:
∇· D = ∂Dx
∂x + ∂Dy
∂y + ∂Dz
∂z = div(D)
The use of ∇· D is much more prevalent than that of div D, although both usages
have their advantages. Writing ∇· D allows us to obtain simply and quickly the correct
partial derivatives, but only in rectangular coordinates, as we will see. On the other
hand, div D is an excellent reminder of the physical interpretation of divergence.
We shall use the operator notation ∇· D from now on to indicate the divergence
operation.
The vector operator ∇is used not only with divergence, but also with several
other very important operations that appear later. One of these is ∇u, where u is any
scalar ﬁeld, and leads to
∇u =
 ∂
∂x ax + ∂
∂y ay + ∂
∂z az

u = ∂u
∂x ax + ∂u
∂y ay + ∂u
∂z az
The ∇operator does not have a speciﬁc form in other coordinate systems. If we
are considering D in cylindrical coordinates, then ∇· D still indicates the divergence
of D, or
∇· D = 1
ρ
∂
∂ρ (ρDρ) + 1
ρ
∂Dφ
∂φ + ∂Dz
∂z
where this expression has been taken from Section 3.5. We have no form for ∇itself
to help us obtain this sum of partial derivatives. This means that ∇u, as yet unnamed
but easily written in rectangular coordinates, cannot be expressed by us at this time
in cylindrical coordinates. Such an expression will be obtained when ∇u is deﬁned
in Chapter 4.
We close our discussion of divergence by presenting a theorem that will be needed
several times in later chapters, the divergence theorem. This theorem applies to any
vector ﬁeld for which the appropriate partial derivatives exist, although it is easiest
for us to develop it for the electric ﬂux density. We have actually obtained it already
and now have little more to do than point it out and name it, for starting from Gauss’s
law, we have


D · dS = Q =

ρνdv =

vol
∇· D dv
The ﬁrst and last expressions constitute the divergence theorem,

S
D · dS =


∇· D dv
(17)
which may be stated as follows:
The integral of the normal component of any vector ﬁeld over a closed surface is equal to
the integral of the divergence of this vector ﬁeld throughout the volume enclosed by the
closed surface.

CHAPTER 3
Electric Flux Density, Gauss’s Law, and Divergence
69
Figure 3.7
The divergence theorem states that the total
flux crossing the closed surface is equal to the integral of
the divergence of the flux density throughout the enclosed
volume. The volume is shown here in cross section.
Again, we emphasize that the divergence theorem is true for any vector ﬁeld,
although we have obtained it speciﬁcally for the electric ﬂux density D, and we will
have occasion later to apply it to several different ﬁelds. Its beneﬁts derive from the
fact that it relates a triple integration throughout some volume to a double integration
over the surface of that volume. For example, it is much easier to look for leaks in
a bottle full of some agitated liquid by inspecting the surface than by calculating the
velocity at every internal point.
The divergence theorem becomes obvious physically if we consider a volume ν,
shown in cross section in Figure 3.7, which is surrounded by a closed surface S.
Division of the volume into a number of small compartments of differential size and
consideration of one cell show that the ﬂux diverging from such a cell enters, or
converges on, the adjacent cells unless the cell contains a portion of the outer surface.
In summary, the divergence of the ﬂux density throughout a volume leads, then, to
the same result as determining the net ﬂux crossing the enclosing surface.
EXAMPLE 3.5
Evaluate both sides of the divergence theorem for the ﬁeld D = 2xyax + x2ay C/m2
and the rectangular parellelepiped formed by the planes x = 0 and 1, y = 0 and 2,
and z = 0 and 3.
Solution. Evaluating the surface integral ﬁrst, we note that D is parallel to the sur-
faces at z = 0 and z = 3, so D · dS = 0 there. For the remaining four surfaces
we have

n Chapters 2 and 3 we became acquainted with Coulomb’s law and its use in
ﬁnding the electric ﬁeld about several simple distributions of charge, and also with
Gauss’s law and its application in determining the ﬁeld about some symmetrical
charge arrangements. The use of Gauss’s law was invariably easier for these highly
symmetrical distributions because the problem of integration always disappeared
when the proper closed surface was chosen.
However, if we had attempted to ﬁnd a slightly more complicated ﬁeld, such as
that of two unlike point charges separated by a small distance, we would have found it
impossible to choose a suitable gaussian surface and obtain an answer. Coulomb’s law,
however, is more powerful and enables us to solve problems for which Gauss’s law is
notapplicable.TheapplicationofCoulomb’slawislaborious,detailed,andoftenquite
complex, the reason for this being precisely the fact that the electric ﬁeld intensity,
a vector ﬁeld, must be found directly from the charge distribution. Three different
integrations are needed in general, one for each component, and the resolution of the
vector into components usually adds to the complexity of the integrals.
Certainly it would be desirable if we could ﬁnd some as yet undeﬁned scalar
function with a single integration and then determine the electric ﬁeld from this scalar
by some simple straightforward procedure, such as differentiation.
This scalar function does exist and is known as the potential or potential ﬁeld.
We shall ﬁnd that it has a very real physical interpretation and is more familiar to
most of us than is the electric ﬁeld which it will be used to ﬁnd.
We should expect, then, to be equipped soon with a third method of ﬁnding
electric ﬁelds—a single scalar integration, although not always as simple as we might
wish, followed by a pleasant differentiation.

ENERGY EXPENDED IN MOVING A POINT
CHARGE IN AN ELECTRIC FIELD
The electric ﬁeld intensity was deﬁned as the force on a unit test charge at that point
at which we wish to ﬁnd the value of this vector ﬁeld. If we attempt to move the test
charge against the electric ﬁeld, we have to exert a force equal and opposite to that
exerted by the ﬁeld, and this requires us to expend energy or do work. If we wish to
move the charge in the direction of the ﬁeld, our energy expenditure turns out to be
negative; we do not do the work, the ﬁeld does.
Suppose we wish to move a charge Q a distance dL in an electric ﬁeld E. The
force on Q arising from the electric ﬁeld is
FE = QE
(1)
where the subscript reminds us that this force arises from the ﬁeld. The component
of this force in the direction dL which we must overcome is
FEL = F · aL = QE · aL
where aL = a unit vector in the direction of dL.
The force that we must apply is equal and opposite to the force associated with
the ﬁeld,
Fappl = −QE · aL
and the expenditure of energy is the product of the force and distance. That is, the
differential work done by an external source moving charge Q is dW = −QE · aLdL,
or
dW = −QE · dL
(2)
where we have replaced aLdL by the simpler expression dL.
This differential amount of work required may be zero under several conditions
determined easily from Eq. (2). There are the trivial conditions for which E, Q, or dL
is zero, and a much more important case in which E and dL are perpendicular. Here
the charge is moved always in a direction at right angles to the electric ﬁeld. We can
draw on a good analogy between the electric ﬁeld and the gravitational ﬁeld, where,
again, energy must be expended to move against the ﬁeld. Sliding a mass around with
constant velocity on a frictionless surface is an effortless process if the mass is moved
along a constant elevation contour; positive or negative work must be done in moving
it to a higher or lower elevation, respectively.
Returning to the charge in the electric ﬁeld, the work required to move the charge
a ﬁnite distance must be determined by integrating,
W = −Q

THE LINE INTEGRAL
The integral expression for the work done in moving a point charge Q from one
position to another, Eq. (3), is an example of a line integral, which in vector-analysis
notation always takes the form of the integral along some prescribed path of the dot
product of a vector ﬁeld and a differential vector path length dL. Without using vector
analysis we should have to write
W = −Q
 ﬁnal
init
EL dL
where EL = component of E along dL.
A line integral is like many other integrals which appear in advanced analysis,
including the surface integral appearing in Gauss’s law, in that it is essentially de-
scriptive. We like to look at it much more than we like to work it out. It tells us to
choose a path, break it up into a large number of very small segments, multiply the
component of the ﬁeld along each segment by the length of the segment, and then
add the results for all the segments. This is a summation, of course, and the integral
is obtained exactly only when the number of segments becomes inﬁnite.
This procedure is indicated in Figure 4.1, where a path has been chosen from
an initial position B to a ﬁnal position1 A and a uniform electric ﬁeld is selected
for simplicity. The path is divided into six segments, L1, L2, . . . , L6, and the
components of E along each segment are denoted by EL1, EL2, . . . , EL6. The work
involved in moving a charge Q from B to A is then approximately
W = −Q(EL1L1 + EL2L2 + · · · + EL6L6)
or, using vector notation,
W = −Q(E1 · L1 + E2 · L2 + · · · + E6 · L6)
1 The ﬁnal position is given the designation A to correspond with the convention for potential
difference, as discussed in the following section.

A graphical interpretation of a line integral in a uniform field. The line
integral of E between points B and A is independent of the path selected, even in a
nonuniform field; this result is not, in general, true for time-varying fields.
and because we have assumed a uniform ﬁeld,
E1 = E2 = · · · = E6
W = −QE · (L1 + L2 + · · · + L6)
What is this sum of vector segments in the preceding parentheses? Vectors add
by the parallelogram law, and the sum is just the vector directed from the initial point
B to the ﬁnal point A, LB A. Therefore
W = −QE · LB A
(uniform E)

Remembering the summation interpretation of the line integral, this result for the
uniform ﬁeld can be obtained rapidly now from the integral expression

CHAPTER 4
Energy and Potential
79
For this special case of a uniform electric ﬁeld intensity, we should note that the
work involved in moving the charge depends only on Q, E, and LB A, a vector drawn
from the initial to the ﬁnal point of the path chosen. It does not depend on the particular
path we have selected along which to carry the charge. We may proceed from B to A
on a straight line or via the Old Chisholm Trail; the answer is the same. We show in
Section4.5thatanidenticalstatementmaybemadeforanynonuniform(static)Eﬁeld.
Let us use several examples to illustrate the mechanics of setting up the line
integral appearing in Eq. (5).
EXAMPLE 4.1
We are given the nonuniform ﬁeld
E = yax + xay + 2az
and we are asked to determine the work expended in carrying 2C from B(1, 0, 1) to

EXAMPLE 4.2
Again ﬁnd the work required to carry 2C from B to A in the same ﬁeld, but this time
use the straight-line path from B to A.
Solution. We start by determining the equations of the straight line. Any two of the
following three equations for planes passing through the line are sufﬁcient to deﬁne
the line:
y −yB = yA −yB
xA −xB
(x −xB)
z −zB = z A −zB
yA −yB
(y −yB)
x −xB = xA −xB
z A −zB

This is the same answer we found using the circular path between the same
two points, and it again demonstrates the statement (unproved) that the work done is
independent of the path taken in any electrostatic ﬁeld.
It should be noted that the equations of the straight line show that dy = −3 dx and
dx = −1
3 dy. These substitutions may be made in the ﬁrst two integrals, along with
a change in limits, and the answer may be obtained by evaluating the new integrals.
This method is often simpler if the integrand is a function of only one variable.
Note that the expressions for dL in our three coordinate systems use the dif-
ferential lengths obtained in Chapter 1 (rectangular in Section 1.3, cylindrical in
Section 1.8, and spherical in Section 1.9):
dL = dx ax + dy ay + dz az

dL = dρ aρ + ρ dφaφ + dz az
(cylindrical)
(7)
dL = dr ar + r dθ aθ + r sin θ dφ aφ

The interrelationships among the several variables in each expression are determined
from the speciﬁc equations for the path.

Figure 4.2
(a) A circular path and (b) a radial path along which a charge of Q is carried
in the field of an infinite line charge. No work is expected in the former case.
As a ﬁnal example illustrating the evaluation of the line integral, we investigate
several paths that we might take near an inﬁnite line charge. The ﬁeld has been
obtained several times and is entirely in the radial direction,
E = Eρaρ =
ρL
2πϵ0ρ aρ
First we ﬁnd the work done in carrying the positive charge Q about a circular
path of radius ρb centered at the line charge, as illustrated in Figure 4.2a. Without
lifting a pencil, we see that the work must be nil, for the path is always perpendicular
to the electric ﬁeld intensity, or the force on the charge is always exerted at right
angles to the direction in which we are moving it. For practice, however, we will set
up the integral and obtain the answer.
The differential element dL is chosen in cylindrical coordinates, and the circular
path selected demands that dρ and dz be zero, so dL = ρ1 dφ aφ. The work is then

Because b is larger than a, ln (b/a) is positive, and the work done is negative,
indicating that the external source that is moving the charge receives energy.

82
ENGINEERING ELECTROMAGNETICS
One of the pitfalls in evaluating line integrals is a tendency to use too many minus
signs when a charge is moved in the direction of a decreasing coordinate value. This is
taken care of completely by the limits on the integral, and no misguided attempt should
be made to change the sign of dL. Suppose we carry Q from b to a (Figure 4.2b).
We still have dL = dρ aρ and show the different direction by recognizing ρ = b as

(If it is not conservative, the work expressed by Eq. (3) may be a function of the

required to move a 3-C charge from (1, 3, 5) to (2, 0, 3) along the straight-line

DEFINITION OF POTENTIAL
DIFFERENCE AND POTENTIAL
We are now ready to deﬁne a new concept from the expression for the work done
by an external source in moving a charge Q from one point to another in an electric
ﬁeld E, “Potential difference and work.”
W = −Q
 ﬁnal
init
E · dL
In much the same way as we deﬁned the electric ﬁeld intensity as the force on a
unit test charge, we now deﬁne potential difference V as the work done (by an external
source) in moving a unit positive charge from one point to another in an electric ﬁeld,
Potential difference = V = −
 ﬁnal
init
E · dL
(9)

CHAPTER 4
Energy and Potential
83
We have to agree on the direction of movement, and we do this by stating that
VAB signiﬁes the potential difference between points A and B and is the work done in
moving the unit charge from B (last named) to A (ﬁrst named). Thus, in determining
VAB, B is the initial point and A is the ﬁnal point. The reason for this somewhat
peculiar deﬁnition will become clearer shortly, when it is seen that the initial point B
is often taken at inﬁnity, whereas the ﬁnal point A represents the ﬁxed position of the
charge; point A is thus inherently more signiﬁcant.
Potential difference is measured in joules per coulomb, for which the volt is
deﬁned as a more common unit, abbreviated as V. Hence the potential difference
between points A and B is
VAB = −
 A
B
E · dL V
(10)
and VAB is positive if work is done in carrying the positive charge from B to A.
From the line-charge example of Section 4.2 we found that the work done in
taking a charge Q from ρ = b to ρ = a was
W = QρL
2πϵ0
ln b
a
Thus, the potential difference between points at ρ = a and ρ = b is
Vab = W
Q = ρL
2πϵ0
ln b
a
(11)
We can try out this deﬁnition by ﬁnding the potential difference between points
A and B at radial distances rA and rB from a point charge Q. Choosing an origin at Q,
E = Erar =
Q
4πϵ0r2 ar
and
dL = dr ar
we have
VAB = −

(12)
If rB > rA, the potential difference VAB is positive, indicating that energy is
expended by the external source in bringing the positive charge from rB to rA. This
agrees with the physical picture showing the two like charges repelling each other.
It is often convenient to speak of the potential, or absolute potential, of a point,
rather than the potential difference between two points, but this means only that we
agree to measure every potential difference with respect to a speciﬁed reference point
that we consider to have zero potential. Common agreement must be reached on
the zero reference before a statement of the potential has any signiﬁcance. A person
having one hand on the deﬂection plates of a cathode-ray tube that are “at a potential
of 50 V” and the other hand on the cathode terminal would probably be too shaken up

84
ENGINEERING ELECTROMAGNETICS
to understand that the cathode is not the zero reference, but that all potentials in that
circuit are customarily measured with respect to the metallic shield about the tube.
The cathode may be several thousands of volts negative with respect to the shield.
Perhaps the most universal zero reference point in experimental or physical po-
tential measurements is “ground,” by which we mean the potential of the surface
region of the earth itself. Theoretically, we usually represent this surface by an inﬁnite
plane at zero potential, although some large-scale problems, such as those involving
propagation across the Atlantic Ocean, require a spherical surface at zero potential.
Another widely used reference “point” is inﬁnity. This usually appears in theo-
retical problems approximating a physical situation in which the earth is relatively far
removed from the region in which we are interested, such as the static ﬁeld near the
wing tip of an airplane that has acquired a charge in ﬂying through a thunderhead, or
the ﬁeld inside an atom. Working with the gravitational potential ﬁeld on earth, the
zero reference is normally taken at sea level; for an interplanetary mission, however,
the zero reference is more conveniently selected at inﬁnity.
A cylindrical surface of some deﬁnite radius may occasionally be used as a zero
reference when cylindrical symmetry is present and inﬁnity proves inconvenient. In a
coaxial cable the outer conductor is selected as the zero reference for potential. And,
of course, there are numerous special problems, such as those for which a two-sheeted
hyperboloid or an oblate spheroid must be selected as the zero-potential reference,
but these need not concern us immediately.
If the potential at point A is VA and that at B is VB, then
VAB = VA −VB
(13)
where we necessarily agree that VA and VB shall have the same zero reference point.
D4.4. An electric ﬁeld is expressed in rectangular coordinates by E = 6x2ax +
6yay +4azV/m. Find: (a) VM N if points M and N are speciﬁed by M(2, 6, −1)

P(1, 2, −4).
Ans. −139.0 V; −120.0 V; 19.0 V
4.4
THE POTENTIAL FIELD
OF A POINT CHARGE
In Section 4.3 we found an expression Eq. (12) for the potential difference between
two points located at r = rA and r = rB in the ﬁeld of a point charge Q placed
at the origin. How might we conveniently deﬁne a zero reference for potential? The
simplest possibility is to let V = 0 at inﬁnity. If we let the point at r = rB recede to
inﬁnity, the potential at rA becomes
VA =
Q
4πϵ0rA

CHAPTER 4
Energy and Potential
85
or, as there is no reason to identify this point with the A subscript,
V =
Q
4πϵ0r
(14)
This expression deﬁnes the potential at any point distant r from a point charge Q
at the origin, the potential at inﬁnite radius being taken as the zero reference. Returning
to a physical interpretation, we may say that Q/4πϵ0r joules of work must be done
in carrying a unit charge from inﬁnity to any point r meters from the charge Q.
A convenient method to express the potential without selecting a speciﬁc zero
reference entails identifying rA as r once again and letting Q/4πϵ0rB be a constant.
Then
V =
Q
4πϵ0r + C1
(15)
and C1 may be selected so that V = 0 at any desired value of r. We could also select
the zero reference indirectly by electing to let V be V0 at r = r0.
It should be noted that the potential difference between two points is not a func-
tion of C1.
Equations (14) and (15) represent the potential ﬁeld of a point charge. The po-
tential is a scalar ﬁeld and does not involve any unit vectors.
We now deﬁne an equipotential surface as a surface composed of all those points
having the same value of potential. All ﬁeld lines would be perpendicular to such a
surface at the points where they intersect it. Therefore, no work is involved in moving
a unit charge around on an equipotential surface. The equipotential surfaces in the
potential ﬁeld of a point charge are spheres centered at the point charge.
An inspection of the form of the potential ﬁeld of a point charge shows that it
is an inverse-distance ﬁeld, whereas the electric ﬁeld intensity was found to be an
inverse-square-law function. A similar result occurs for the gravitational force ﬁeld
of a point mass (inverse-square law) and the gravitational potential ﬁeld (inverse
distance). The gravitational force exerted by the earth on an object one million miles
from it is four times that exerted on the same object two million miles away. The
kinetic energy given to a freely falling object starting from the end of the universe
with zero velocity, however, is only twice as much at one million miles as it is at two
million miles.

4.5
THE POTENTIAL FIELD OF A SYSTEM OF
CHARGES: CONSERVATIVE PROPERTY
The potential at a point has been deﬁned as the work done in bringing a unit positive
charge from the zero reference to the point, and we have suspected that this work, and
hence the potential, is independent of the path taken. If it were not, potential would
not be a very useful concept.
Let us now prove our assertion. We do so by beginning with the potential ﬁeld
of the single point charge for which we showed, in Section 4.4, the independence
with regard to the path, noting that the ﬁeld is linear with respect to charge so that
superposition is applicable. It will then follow that the potential of a system of charges
has a value at any point which is independent of the path taken in carrying the test
charge to that point.
Thus the potential ﬁeld of a single point charge, which we shall identify as Q1
and locate at r1, involves only the distance |r −r1| from Q1 to the point at r where
we are establishing the value of the potential. For a zero reference at inﬁnity, we have
V (r) =
Q1
4πϵ0|r −r1|
The potential arising from two charges, Q1 at r1 and Q2 at r2, is a function only of
|r −r1| and |r −r2|, the distances from Q1 and Q2 to the ﬁeld point, respectively.
V (r) =
Q1
4πϵ0|r −r1| +
Q2
4πϵ0|r −r2|
Continuing to add charges, we ﬁnd that the potential arising from n point charges is
V (r) =
n

m=1
Qm
4πϵ0|r −rm|
(16)
If each point charge is now represented as a small element of a continuous volume
charge distribution ρνν, then
V (r) =

4πϵ0|r −r1| +
ρν(r2)ν2
4πϵ0|r −r2| + · · · +

As we allow the number of elements to become inﬁnite, we obtain the integral
expression
V (r) =

vol
ρν(r′) dv′
4πϵ0|r −r′|
(17)
We have come quite a distance from the potential ﬁeld of the single point charge,
and it might be helpful to examine Eq. (17) and refresh ourselves as to the meaning of
each term. The potential V (r) is determined with respect to a zero reference potential
at inﬁnity and is an exact measure of the work done in bringing a unit charge from

CHAPTER 4
Energy and Potential
87
inﬁnity to the ﬁeld point at r where we are ﬁnding the potential. The volume charge
density ρv(r′) and differential volume element dv′ combine to represent a differential
amount of charge ρν(r′) dv′ located at r′. The distance |r −r′| is that distance from
the source point to the ﬁeld point. The integral is a multiple (volume) integral.
If the charge distribution takes the form of a line charge or a surface charge, the
integration is along the line or over the surface:
V (r) =

ρL(r′) dL′
4πϵ0|r −r′|

ThemostgeneralexpressionforpotentialisobtainedbycombiningEqs.(16)–(19).
These integral expressions for potential in terms of the charge distribution should
be compared with similar expressions for the electric ﬁeld intensity, such as Eq. (15)
in Section 2.3:
E(r) =

vol
ρν(r′) dv′
4πϵ0|r −r′|2
r −r′
|r −r′|
The potential again is inverse distance, and the electric ﬁeld intensity, inverse-
square law. The latter, of course, is also a vector ﬁeld.
EXAMPLE 4.3
To illustrate the use of one of these potential integrals, we will ﬁnd V on the z axis for
a uniform line charge ρL in the form of a ring, ρ = a, in the z = 0 plane, as shown
in Figure 4.3.
Solution. Working with Eq. (18), we have dL′ = adφ′, r = zaz, r′ = aaρ, |r−r′| =

V =

For a zero reference at inﬁnity, then:
1.
The potential arising from a single point charge is the work done in carrying a
unit positive charge from inﬁnity to the point at which we desire the potential,
and the work is independent of the path chosen between those two points.
2.
The potential ﬁeld in the presence of a number of point charges is the sum of
the individual potential ﬁelds arising from each charge.
3.
The potential arising from a number of point charges or any continuous charge
distribution may therefore be found by carrying a unit charge from inﬁnity to
the point in question along any path we choose.

or potential difference,

is not dependent on the path chosen for the line integral, regardless of the source of
the E ﬁeld.
This result is often stated concisely by recognizing that no work is done in
carrying the unit charge around any closed path, or

E · dL = 0
(20)
A small circle is placed on the integral sign to indicate the closed nature of the
path. This symbol also appeared in the formulation of Gauss’s law, where a closed
surface integral was used.
Equation (20) is true for static ﬁelds, but we will see in Chapter 9 that Faraday
demonstrated it was incomplete when time-varying magnetic ﬁelds were present. One
of Maxwell’s greatest contributions to electromagnetic theory was in showing that a
time-varying electric ﬁeld produces a magnetic ﬁeld, and therefore we should expect
to ﬁnd later that Eq. (20) is not correct when either E or the magnetic ﬁeld varies
with time.
Restricting our attention to the static case where E does not change with time,
consider the dc circuit shown in Figure 4.4. Two points, A and B, are marked, and

voltage law.
(20) states that no work is involved in carrying a unit charge from A through R2 and
R3 to B and back to A through R1, or that the sum of the potential differences around
any closed path is zero.
Equation (20) is therefore just a more general form of Kirchhoff’s circuital law
for voltages, more general in that we can apply it to any region where an electric
ﬁeld exists and we are not restricted to a conventional circuit composed of wires,
resistances, and batteries. Equation (20) must be amended before we can apply it to
time-varying ﬁelds.
Any ﬁeld that satisﬁes an equation of the form of Eq. (20), (i.e., where the closed
line integral of the ﬁeld is zero) is said to be a conservative ﬁeld. The name arises from
the fact that no work is done (or that energy is conserved) around a closed path. The
gravitational ﬁeld is also conservative, for any energy expended in moving (raising)
an object against the ﬁeld is recovered exactly when the object is returned (lowered)
to its original position. A nonconservative gravitational ﬁeld could solve our energy
problems forever.
Given a nonconservative ﬁeld, it is of course possible that the line integral may
be zero for certain closed paths. For example, consider the force ﬁeld, F = sin πρ aφ.
Around a circular path of radius ρ = ρ1, we have dL = ρ dφ aφ, and

F · dL =
 2π
0
sin πρ1aφ · ρ1dφ aφ =
 2π

ρ1 sin πρ1 dφ
= 2πρ1 sin πρ1
The integral is zero if ρ1 = 1, 2, 3, . . . , etc., but it is not zero for other values of ρ1,
or for most other closed paths, and the given ﬁeld is not conservative. A conservative
ﬁeld must yield a zero value for the line integral around every possible closed path.

POTENTIAL GRADIENT
We now have two methods of determining potential, one directly from the electric ﬁeld
intensity by means of a line integral, and another from the basic charge distribution
itself by a volume integral. Neither method is very helpful in determining the ﬁelds
in most practical problems, however, for as we will see later, neither the electric ﬁeld
intensity nor the charge distribution is very often known. Preliminary information is
much more apt to consist of a description of two equipotential surfaces, such as the
statement that we have two parallel conductors of circular cross section at potentials
of 100 and −100 V. Perhaps we wish to ﬁnd the capacitance between the conductors,
or the charge and current distribution on the conductors from which losses may be
calculated.
These quantities may be easily obtained from the potential ﬁeld, and our im-
mediate goal will be a simple method of ﬁnding the electric ﬁeld intensity from the
potential.
We already have the general line-integral relationship between these quantities,
V = −

E · dL
(21)
but this is much easier to use in the reverse direction: given E, ﬁnd V.
However, Eq. (21) may be applied to a very short element of length L along
which E is essentially constant, leading to an incremental potential difference V,
V ˙= −E · L
(22)
Now consider a general region of space, as shown in Figure 4.5, in which E and
V both change as we move from point to point. Equation (22) tells us to choose an
incremental vector element of length L = L aL and multiply its magnitude by
Figure 4.5
A vector incremental element of
length L is shown making an angle of θ with an
E field, indicated by its streamlines. The sources
of the field are not shown.

CHAPTER 4

91
the component of E in the direction of aL (one interpretation of the dot product) to
obtain the small potential difference between the ﬁnal and initial points of L.
If we designate the angle between L and E as θ, then
V ˙= −EL cos θ
We now pass to the limit and consider the derivative dV/dL. To do this, we need
to show that V may be interpreted as a function V (x, y, z). So far, V is merely the
result of the line integral (21). If we assume a speciﬁed starting point or zero reference
and then let our end point be (x, y, z), we know that the result of the integration is a
unique function of the end point (x, y, z) because E is a conservative ﬁeld. Therefore
V is a single-valued function V (x, y, z). We may then pass to the limit and obtain
dV
dL = −E cos θ
In which direction should L be placed to obtain a maximum value of V ?
Remember that E is a deﬁnite value at the point at which we are working and is
independent of the direction of L. The magnitude L is also constant, and our
variable is aL, the unit vector showing the direction of L. It is obvious that the
maximum positive increment of potential, Vmax, will occur when cos θ is −1, or
L points in the direction opposite to E. For this condition,
dV
dL

max
= E
This little exercise shows us two characteristics of the relationship between E
and V at any point:
1.
The magnitude of the electric ﬁeld intensity is given by the maximum value of
the rate of change of potential with distance.
2.
This maximum value is obtained when the direction of the distance increment is
opposite to E or, in other words, the direction of E is opposite to the direction in
which the potential is increasing the most rapidly.
We now illustrate these relationships in terms of potential. Figure 4.6 is intended
to show the information we have been given about some potential ﬁeld. It does this by
showing the equipotential surfaces (shown as lines in the two-dimensional sketch).
We desire information about the electric ﬁeld intensity at point P. Starting at P, we lay
off a small incremental distance L in various directions, hunting for that direction
in which the potential is changing (increasing) the most rapidly. From the sketch, this
direction appears to be left and slightly upward. From our second characteristic above,
the electric ﬁeld intensity is therefore oppositely directed, or to the right and slightly
downward at P. Its magnitude is given by dividing the small increase in potential by
the small element of length.
It seems likely that the direction in which the potential is increasing the most
rapidly is perpendicular to the equipotentials (in the direction of increasing potential),
and this is correct, for if L is directed along an equipotential, V = 0 by our

92

A potential field is shown by its equipotential
surfaces. At any point the E field is normal to the

deﬁnition of an equipotential surface. But then
V = −E · L = 0
and as neither E nor L is zero, E must be perpendicular to this L or perpendicular
to the equipotentials.
Because the potential ﬁeld information is more likely to be determined ﬁrst, let
us describe the direction of L, which leads to a maximum increase in potential
mathematically in terms of the potential ﬁeld rather than the electric ﬁeld intensity.
We do this by letting aN be a unit vector normal to the equipotential surface and
directed toward the higher potentials. The electric ﬁeld intensity is then expressed in
terms of the potential,
E = −dV
dL

max
aN
(23)
which shows that the magnitude of E is given by the maximum space rate of change
of V and the direction of E is normal to the equipotential surface (in the direction of
decreasing potential).
Because dV/dL|max occurs when L is in the direction of aN, we may remind
ourselves of this fact by letting
dV
dL

max
= dV

and
E = −dV

(24)
Either Eq. (23) or Eq. (24) provides a physical interpretation of the process of
ﬁnding the electric ﬁeld intensity from the potential. Both are descriptive of a general
procedure,andwedonotintendtousethemdirectlytoobtainquantitativeinformation.

CHAPTER 4
Energy and Potential
93
This procedure leading from V to E is not unique to this pair of quantities, however,
but has appeared as the relationship between a scalar and a vector ﬁeld in hydraulics,
thermodynamics, and magnetics, and indeed in almost every ﬁeld to which vector
analysis has been applied.
The operation on V by which −E is obtained is known as the gradient, and the
gradient of a scalar ﬁeld T is deﬁned as
Gradient of T = grad T = dT
dN aN
(25)
where aN is a unit vector normal to the equipotential surfaces, and that normal is
chosen, which points in the direction of increasing values of T.
Using this new term, we now may write the relationship between V and E as
E = −grad V
(26)
Because we have shown that V is a unique function of x, y, and z, we may take
its total differential
dV = ∂V
∂x dx + ∂V
∂y dy + ∂V
∂z dz
But we also have
dV = −E · dL = −Ex dx −Ey dy −Ez dz
Because both expressions are true for any dx, dy, and dz, then
Ex = −∂V
∂x
Ey = −∂V
∂y
Ez = −∂V
∂z
These results may be combined vectorially to yield
E = −
∂V
∂x ax + ∂V
∂y ay + ∂V
∂z az
	
(27)
and comparing Eqs. (26) and (27) provides us with an expression which may be used
to evaluate the gradient in rectangular coordinates,
grad V = ∂V
∂x ax + ∂V
∂y ay + ∂V
∂z az
(28)
The gradient of a scalar is a vector, and old quizzes show that the unit vectors
that are often incorrectly added to the divergence expression appear to be those that

94
ENGINEERING ELECTROMAGNETICS
were incorrectly removed from the gradient. Once the physical interpretation of the
gradient, expressed by Eq. (25), is grasped as showing the maximum space rate of
change of a scalar quantity and the direction in which this maximum occurs, the vector
nature of the gradient should be self-evident.
The vector operator
∇= ∂
∂x ax + ∂
∂y ay + ∂
∂z az
may be used formally as an operator on a scalar, T , ∇T , producing
∇T = ∂T
∂x ax + ∂T
∂y ay + ∂T
∂z az
from which we see that
∇T = grad T
This allows us to use a very compact expression to relate E and V,
E = −∇V
(29)
The gradient may be expressed in terms of partial derivatives in other coordinate
systems through the application of its deﬁnition Eq. (25). These expressions are
derived in Appendix A and repeated here for convenience when dealing with problems
having cylindrical or spherical symmetry. They also appear inside the back cover.

Note that the denominator of each term has the form of one of the components of dL in
that coordinate system, except that partial differentials replace ordinary differentials;
for example, r sin θ dφ becomes r sin θ ∂φ.
We now illustrate the gradient concept with an example.
EXAMPLE 4.4
Given the potential ﬁeld, V = 2x2y −5z, and a point P(−4, 3, 6), we wish to ﬁnd
several numerical values at point P: the potential V , the electric ﬁeld intensity E, the
direction of E, the electric ﬂux density D, and the volume charge density ρν.
Solution. The potential at P(−4, 5, 6) is
VP = 2(−4)2(3) −5(6) = 66 V

CHAPTER 4

95
Next, we may use the gradient operation to obtain the electric ﬁeld intensity,
E = −∇V = −4xyax −2x2ay + 5az V/m
The value of E at point P is
EP = 48ax −32ay + 5az V/m
and
|EP| =

482 + (−32)2 + 52 = 57.9 V/m
The direction of E at P is given by the unit vector
aE,P = (48ax −32ay + 5az)/57.9
= 0.829ax −0.553ay + 0.086az
If we assume these ﬁelds exist in free space, then
D = ϵ0E = −35.4xy ax −17.71x2 ay + 44.3 az pC/m3
Finally, we may use the divergence relationship to ﬁnd the volume charge density that
is the source of the given potential ﬁeld,
ρν = ∇· D = −35.4y pC/m3
At P, ρν = −106.2 pC/m3.

THE ELECTRIC DIPOLE
The dipole ﬁelds that we develop in this section are quite important because they
form the basis for the behavior of dielectric materials in electric ﬁelds, as discussed
in Chapter 6, as well as justifying the use of images, as described in Section 5.5 of
Chapter 5. Moreover, this development will serve to illustrate the importance of the
potential concept presented in this chapter.
An electric dipole, or simply a dipole, is the name given to two point charges of
equal magnitude and opposite sign, separated by a distance that is small compared to

96
ENGINEERING ELECTROMAGNETICS

the distance to the point P at which we want to know the electric and potential ﬁelds.
The dipole is shown in Figure 4.8a. The distant point P is described by the spherical
coordinates r, θ, and φ = 90◦, in view of the azimuthal symmetry. The positive and
negative point charges have separation d and rectangular coordinates (0, 0, 1
2d) and
(0, 0, −1
2d), respectively.
So much for the geometry. What would we do next? Should we ﬁnd the total
electric ﬁeld intensity by adding the known ﬁelds of each point charge? Would it be
easier to ﬁnd the total potential ﬁeld ﬁrst? In either case, having found one, we will
ﬁnd the other from it before calling the problem solved.
If we choose to ﬁnd E ﬁrst, we will have two components to keep track of in
spherical coordinates (symmetry shows Eφ is zero), and then the only way to ﬁnd V
from E is by use of the line integral. This last step includes establishing a suitable zero
reference for potential, since the line integral gives us only the potential difference
between the two points at the ends of the integral path.
On the other hand, the determination of V ﬁrst is a much simpler problem.
This is because we ﬁnd the potential as a function of position by simply adding the
scalar potentials from the two charges. The position-dependent vector magnitude and
direction of E are subsequently evaluated with relative ease by taking the negative
gradient of V.
Choosing this simpler method, we let the distances from Q and −Q to P be R1
and R2, respectively, and write the total potential as
V =

electric dipole. The dipole moment p = Qd is in the az
direction. (b) For a distant point P, R1 is essentially
parallel to R2, and we find that R2 −R1 = d cos θ.
Note that the plane z = 0, midway between the two point charges, is the locus of
points for which R1 = R2, and is therefore at zero potential, as are all points at
inﬁnity.
For a distant point, R1 ˙= R2, and the R1R2 product in the denominator may be
replaced by r2. The approximation may not be made in the numerator, however,
without obtaining the trivial answer that the potential ﬁeld approaches zero as we go
very far away from the dipole. Coming back a little closer to the dipole, we see from
Figure 4.8b that R2 −R1 may be approximated very easily if R1 and R2 are assumed
to be parallel,
R2 −R1 ˙= d cos θ

98

The ﬁnal result is then
V = Qd cos θ
4πϵ0r2
(33)
Again, we note that the plane z = 0 (θ = 90◦) is at zero potential.

or

(35)
These are the desired distant ﬁelds of the dipole, obtained with a very small
amount of work. Any student who has several hours to spend may try to work the
problem in the reverse direction—the authors consider the process too long and de-
tailed to include here, even for effect.
To obtain a plot of the potential ﬁeld, we choose a dipole such that
Qd/(4πϵ0) = 1, and then cos θ = Vr2. The colored lines in Figure 4.9 indicate
equipotentials for which V = 0, +0.2, +0.4, +0.6, +0.8, and +1, as indicated.
The dipole axis is vertical, with the positive charge on the top. The streamlines for
the electric ﬁeld are obtained by applying the methods of Section 2.6 in spherical
coordinates,

from which we obtain
r = C1 sin2 θ
The black streamlines shown in Figure 4.9 are for C1 = 1, 1.5, 2, and 2.5.
The potential ﬁeld of the dipole, Eq. (33), may be simpliﬁed by making use of
the dipole moment. We ﬁrst identify the vector length directed from −Q to +Q as d

direction. Six equipotential surfaces are labeled with relative values of V.
and then deﬁne the dipole moment as Qd and assign it the symbol p. Thus
p = Qd
(36)
The units of p are C · m.
Because d · ar = d cos θ, we then have
V =
p · ar
4πϵ0r2
(37)
This result may be generalized as
V =
1
4πϵ0|r −r′|2 p · r −r′
|r −r′|
(38)
where r locates the ﬁeld point P, and r′ determines the dipole center. Equation (38)
is independent of any coordinate system.

100
ENGINEERING ELECTROMAGNETICS
The dipole moment p will appear again when we discuss dielectric materials.
Since it is equal to the product of the charge and the separation, neither the dipole
moment nor the potential will change as Q increases and d decreases, provided the
product remains constant. The limiting case of a point dipole is achieved when we let
d approach zero and Q approach inﬁnity such that the product p is ﬁnite.
Turning our attention to the resultant ﬁelds, it is interesting to note that the
potential ﬁeld is now proportional to the inverse square of the distance, and the
electric ﬁeld intensity is proportional to the inverse cube of the distance from
the dipole. Each ﬁeld falls off faster than the corresponding ﬁeld for the point charge,
but this is no more than we should expect because the opposite charges appear to
be closer together at greater distances and to act more like a single point charge
of zero Coulombs.
Symmetrical arrangements of larger numbers of point charges produce ﬁelds
proportional to the inverse of higher and higher powers ofr. These charge distributions

ENERGY DENSITY IN THE
ELECTROSTATIC FIELD
We have introduced the potential concept by considering the work done, or en-
ergy expended, in moving a point charge around in an electric ﬁeld, and now we
must tie up the loose ends of that discussion by tracing the energy ﬂow one step
further.
Bringing a positive charge from inﬁnity into the ﬁeld of another positive charge
requires work, the work being done by the external source moving the charge. Let
us imagine that the external source carries the charge up to a point near the ﬁxed
charge and then holds it there. Energy must be conserved, and the energy expended in
bringing this charge into position now represents potential energy, for if the external
source released its hold on the charge, it would accelerate away from the ﬁxed charge,
acquiring kinetic energy of its own and the capability of doing work.
In order to ﬁnd the potential energy present in a system of charges, we must ﬁnd
the work done by an external source in positioning the charges.

CHAPTER 4

101
Wemaystartbyvisualizinganemptyuniverse.Bringingacharge Q1 frominﬁnity
to any position requires no work, for there is no ﬁeld present.2 The positioning of
Q2 at a point in the ﬁeld of Q1 requires an amount of work given by the product of
the charge Q2 and the potential at that point due to Q1. We represent this potential
as V2,1, where the ﬁrst subscript indicates the location and the second subscript the
source. That is, V2,1 is the potential at the location of Q2 due to Q1. Then
Work to position Q2 = Q2V2,1
Similarly, we may express the work required to position each additional charge
in the ﬁeld of all those already present:
Work to position Q3 = Q3V3,1 + Q3V3,2
Work to position Q4 = Q4V4,1 + Q4V4,2 + Q4V4,3
and so forth. The total work is obtained by adding each contribution:
Total positioning work = potential energy of ﬁeld
= WE = Q2V2,1 + Q3V3,1 + Q3V3,2 + Q4V4,1
+Q4V4,2 + Q4V4,3 + · · ·

where R13 and R31 each represent the scalar distance between Q1 and Q3, we see that
it might equally well have been written as Q1V1,3. If each term of the total energy
expression is replaced by its equal, we have
WE = Q1V1,2 + Q1V1,3 + Q2V2,3 + Q1V1,4 + Q2V2,4 + Q3V3,4 + · · ·
(40)
Adding the two energy expressions (39) and (40) gives us a chance to simplify the
result a little:
2WE = Q1(V1,2 + V1,3 + V1,4 + · · ·)
+ Q2(V2,1 + V2,3 + V2,4 + · · ·)
+ Q3(V3,1 + V3,2 + V3,4 + · · ·)
+ · · ·
Each sum of potentials in parentheses is the combined potential due to all the charges
except for the charge at the point where this combined potential is being found. In
other words,
V1,2 + V1,3 + V1,4 + · · · = V1
2 However, somebody in the workshop at inﬁnity had to do an inﬁnite amount of work to create the
point charge in the ﬁrst place! How much energy is required to bring two half-charges into coincidence
to make a unit charge?

Equations (41) and (42) allow us to ﬁnd the total potential energy present in a
system of point charges or distributed volume charge density. Similar expressions
may be easily written in terms of line or surface charge density. Usually we prefer
to use Eq. (42) and let it represent all the various types of charge which may have to
be considered. This may always be done by considering point charges, line charge
density, or surface charge density to be continuous distributions of volume charge
density over very small regions. We will illustrate such a procedure with an example
shortly.
Before we undertake any interpretation of this result, we should consider a few
lines of more difﬁcult vector analysis and obtain an expression equivalent to Eq. (42)
but written in terms of E and D.
We begin by making the expression a little bit longer. Using Maxwell’s ﬁrst
equation, replace ρν by its equal ∇· D and make use of a vector identity which is true
for any scalar function V and any vector function D,
∇· (V D) ≡V (∇· D) + D · (∇V )

Using the divergence theorem from Chapter 3, the ﬁrst volume integral of the last
equation is changed into a closed surface integral, where the closed surface surrounds
the volume considered. This volume, ﬁrst appearing in Eq. (42), must contain every
charge, and there can then be no charges outside of the volume. We may therefore
consider the volume as inﬁnite in extent if we wish. We have

The surface integral is equal to zero, for over this closed surface surrounding the
universe we see that V is approaching zero at least as rapidly as 1/r (the charges
look like point charges from there), and D is approaching zero at least as rapidly as
1/r2. The integrand therefore approaches zero at least as rapidly as 1/r3, while the

differential area of the surface, looking more and more like a portion of a sphere,
is increasing only as r2. Consequently, in the limit as r →∞, the integrand and
the integral both approach zero. Substituting E = −∇V in the remaining volume

ENGINEERING ELECTROMAGNETICS
The question of where the energy is stored in an electric ﬁeld has not yet been
answered. Potential energy can never be pinned down precisely in terms of physical
location. Someone lifts a pencil, and the pencil acquires potential energy. Is the energy
stored in the molecules of the pencil, in the gravitational ﬁeld between the pencil and
the earth, or in some obscure place? Is the energy in a capacitor stored in the charges
themselves, in the ﬁeld, or where? No one can offer any proof for his or her own
private opinion, and the matter of deciding may be left to the philosophers.
Electromagnetic ﬁeld theory makes it easy to believe that the energy of an electric
ﬁeld or a charge distribution is stored in the ﬁeld itself, for if we take Eq. (44), an
exact and rigorously correct expression,
WE = 1

and write it on a differential basis,

or

we obtain a quantity 1
2D · E, which has the dimensions of an energy density, or joules
per cubic meter. We know that if we integrate this energy density over the entire ﬁeld-
containing volume, the result is truly the total energy present, but we have no more
justiﬁcation for saying that the energy stored in each differential volume element dv
is 1
2D · E dv than we have for looking at Eq. (42) and saying that the stored energy is
1
2ρνV dv. The interpretation afforded by Eq. (45), however, is a convenient one, and
we will use it until proved wrong.

n this chapter, we apply the methods we have learned to some of the materials
with which an engineer must work. In the ﬁrst part of the chapter, we consider
conducting materials by describing the parameters that relate current to an applied
electric ﬁeld. This leads to a general deﬁnition of Ohm’s law. We then develop methods
of evaluating resistances of conductors in a few simple geometric forms. Conditions
that must be met at a conducting boundary are obtained next, and this knowledge
leads to a discussion of the method of images. The properties of semiconductors are
described to conclude the discussion of conducting media.
In the second part of the chapter, we consider insulating materials, or dielectrics.
Such materials differ from conductors in that ideally, there is no free charge that can be
transported within them to produce conduction current. Instead, all charge is conﬁned
to molecular or lattice sites by coulomb forces. An applied electric ﬁeld has the effect
of displacing the charges slightly, leading to the formation of ensembles of electric
dipoles. The extent to which this occurs is measured by the relative permittivity, or
dielectric constant. Polarization of the medium may modify the electric ﬁeld, whose
magnitude and direction may differ from the values it would have in a different
medium or in free space. Boundary conditions for the ﬁelds at interfaces between
dielectrics are developed to evaluate these differences.
It should be noted that most materials will possess both dielectric and conductive
properties; that is, a material considered a dielectric may be slightly conductive, and
a material that is mostly conductive may be slightly polarizable. These departures
from the ideal cases lead to some interesting behavior, particularly as to the effects
on electromagnetic wave propagation, as we will see later. ■

CURRENT AND CURRENT DENSITY
Electric charges in motion constitute a current. The unit of current is the ampere (A),
deﬁned as a rate of movement of charge passing a given reference point (or crossing
a given reference plane) of one coulomb per second. Current is symbolized by I, and
therefore
I = dQ
dt
(1)
Current is thus deﬁned as the motion of positive charges, even though conduction in
metals takes place through the motion of electrons, as we will see shortly.
In ﬁeld theory, we are usually interested in events occurring at a point rather
than within a large region, and we ﬁnd the concept of current density, measured in
amperespersquaremeter(A/m2),moreuseful.Currentdensityisavector1 represented
by J.
The increment of current I crossing an incremental surface S normal to the
current density is
I = JNS
and in the case where the current density is not perpendicular to the surface,
I = J · S
Total current is obtained by integrating,
I =

S
J · dS
(2)
Current density may be related to the velocity of volume charge density at a point.
Consider the element of charge Q = ρνν = ρν S L, as shown in Figure 5.1a.
To simplify the explanation, assume that the charge element is oriented with its edges
parallel to the coordinate axes and that it has only an x component of velocity. In
the time interval t, the element of charge has moved a distance x, as indicated in
Figure 5.1b. We have therefore moved a charge Q = ρν S x through a reference
plane perpendicular to the direction of motion in a time increment t, and the resulting
current is
I = Q
t = ρν S x
t
As we take the limit with respect to time, we have
I = ρν S vx
1 Current is not a vector, for it is easy to visualize a problem in which a total current I in a conductor of
nonuniform cross section (such as a sphere) may have a different direction at each point of a given
cross section. Current in an exceedingly ﬁne wire, or a ﬁlamentary current, is occasionally deﬁned as a
vector, but we usually prefer to be consistent and give the direction to the ﬁlament, or path, and not to
the current.

CHAPTER 5

111
Figure 5.1
An increment of charge, Q = ρνSL, which moves a distance x in
a time t, produces a component of current density in the limit of Jx = ρννx.
where νx represents the x component of the velocity v.2 In terms of current density,
we ﬁnd
Jx = ρν νx
and in general
J = ρνv
(3)
This last result shows clearly that charge in motion constitutes a current. We
call this type of current a convection current, and J or ρνv is the convection current
density. Note that the convection current density is related linearly to charge density
as well as to velocity. The mass rate of ﬂow of cars (cars per square foot per second)
in the Holland Tunnel could be increased either by raising the density of cars per
cubic foot, or by going to higher speeds, if the drivers were capable of doing so.

Ans. 180aρ −9aφ mA/m2; 3.26 A
5.2
CONTINUITY OF CURRENT
The introduction of the concept of current is logically followed by a discussion of the
conservation of charge and the continuity equation. The principle of conservation of
charge states simply that charges can be neither created nor destroyed, although equal
2The lowercase ν is used both for volume and velocity. Note, however, that velocity always appears as
a vector v, a component νx, or a magnitude |v|, whereas volume appears only in differential form as dν
or ν.

112
ENGINEERING ELECTROMAGNETICS
amounts of positive and negative charge may be simultaneously created, obtained by
separation, or lost by recombination.
The continuity equation follows from this principle when we consider any region
bounded by a closed surface. The current through the closed surface is
I =

S
J · dS
and this outward ﬂow of positive charge must be balanced by a decrease of positive
charge (or perhaps an increase of negative charge) within the closed surface. If the
charge inside the closed surface is denoted by Qi, then the rate of decrease is −dQi/dt
and the principle of conservation of charge requires
I =

S
J · dS = −dQi
dt
(4)
It might be well to answer here an often-asked question. “Isn’t there a sign error?
I thought I = dQ/dt.” The presence or absence of a negative sign depends on what
current and charge we consider. In circuit theory we usually associate the current ﬂow
into one terminal of a capacitor with the time rate of increase of charge on that plate.
The current of (4), however, is an outward-ﬂowing current.
Equation (4) is the integral form of the continuity equation; the differential, or
point, form is obtained by using the divergence theorem to change the surface integral
into a volume integral:


from which we have our point form of the continuity equation,
(∇· J) = −∂ρν
∂t
(5)
Remembering the physical interpretation of divergence, this equation indicates
that the current, or charge per second, diverging from a small volume per unit volume
is equal to the time rate of decrease of charge per unit volume at every point.
As a numerical example illustrating some of the concepts from the last two sec-
tions, let us consider a current density that is directed radially outward and decreases
exponentially with time,
J = 1
r e−tar A/m2

CHAPTER 5
Conductors and Dielectrics
113
Selecting an instant of time t = 1 s, we may calculate the total outward current at
r = 5 m:
I = Jr S =
 1
5e−1
(4π52) = 23.1 A
At the same instant, but for a slightly larger radius, r = 6 m, we have
I = Jr S =
 1
6e−1
4π62
= 27.7 A
Thus, the total current is larger at r = 6 than it is at r = 5.
To see why this happens, we need to look at the volume charge density and the
velocity. We use the continuity equation ﬁrst:

r2 e−t
We next seek the volume charge density by integrating with respect to t. Because ρν
is given by a partial derivative with respect to time, the “constant” of integration may
be a function of r:
ρν = −
 1
r2 e−t dt + K(r) = 1
r2 e−t + K(r)
If we assume that ρν →0 as t →∞, then K(r) = 0, and
ρν = 1
r2 e−t C/m3
We may now use J = ρνv to ﬁnd the velocity,
νr = Jr
ρν

r e−t

r2 e−t
= r m/s
The velocity is greater at r = 6 than it is at r = 5, and we see that some (unspeciﬁed)
force is accelerating the charge density in an outward direction.
In summary, we have a current density that is inversely proportional to r, a charge
density that is inversely proportional to r2, and a velocity and total current that are
proportional to r. All quantities vary as e−t.

METALLIC CONDUCTORS
Physicists describe the behavior of the electrons surrounding the positive atomic
nucleus in terms of the total energy of the electron with respect to a zero reference
level for an electron at an inﬁnite distance from the nucleus. The total energy is the
sum of the kinetic and potential energies, and because energy must be given to an
electron to pull it away from the nucleus, the energy of every electron in the atom is
a negative quantity. Even though this picture has some limitations, it is convenient to
associate these energy values with orbits surrounding the nucleus, the more negative
energies corresponding to orbits of smaller radius. According to the quantum theory,
only certain discrete energy levels, or energy states, are permissible in a given atom,
and an electron must therefore absorb or emit discrete amounts of energy, or quanta,
in passing from one level to another. A normal atom at absolute zero temperature has
an electron occupying every one of the lower energy shells, starting outward from the
nucleus and continuing until the supply of electrons is exhausted.
In a crystalline solid, such as a metal or a diamond, atoms are packed closely
together, many more electrons are present, and many more permissible energy levels
are available because of the interaction forces between adjacent atoms. We ﬁnd that
the allowed energies of electrons are grouped into broad ranges, or “bands,” each band
consisting of very numerous, closely spaced, discrete levels. At a temperature of abso-
lute zero, the normal solid also has every level occupied, starting with the lowest and
proceeding in order until all the electrons are located. The electrons with the highest
(least negative) energy levels, the valence electrons, are located in the valence band. If
there are permissible higher-energy levels in the valence band, or if the valence band
merges smoothly into a conduction band, then additional kinetic energy may be given
to the valence electrons by an external ﬁeld, resulting in an electron ﬂow. The solid is
called a metallic conductor. The ﬁlled valence band and the unﬁlled conduction band

If, however, the electron with the greatest energy occupies the top level in the
valence band and a gap exists between the valence band and the conduction band, then

the electron cannot accept additional energy in small amounts, and the material is an
insulator. This band structure is indicated in Figure 5.2b. Note that if a relatively large
amount of energy can be transferred to the electron, it may be sufﬁciently excited to
jump the gap into the next band where conduction can occur easily. Here the insulator
breaks down.
An intermediate condition occurs when only a small “forbidden region” separates
the two bands, as illustrated by Figure 5.2c. Small amounts of energy in the form of
heat, light, or an electric ﬁeld may raise the energy of the electrons at the top of the
ﬁlled band and provide the basis for conduction. These materials are insulators which
display many of the properties of conductors and are called semiconductors.
Let us ﬁrst consider the conductor. Here the valence electrons, or conduction,
or free, electrons, move under the inﬂuence of an electric ﬁeld. With a ﬁeld E, an
electron having a charge Q = −e will experience a force
F = −eE
In free space, the electron would accelerate and continuously increase its velocity
(and energy); in the crystalline material, the progress of the electron is impeded
by continual collisions with the thermally excited crystalline lattice structure, and a
constant average velocity is soon attained. This velocity vd is termed the drift velocity,
and it is linearly related to the electric ﬁeld intensity by the mobility of the electron
in the given material. We designate mobility by the symbol µ (mu), so that
vd = −µeE
(6)
where µϵ is the mobility of an electron and is positive by deﬁnition. Note that the
electron velocity is in a direction opposite to the direction of E. Equation (6) also
shows that mobility is measured in the units of square meters per volt-second; typical
values3 are 0.0012 for aluminum, 0.0032 for copper, and 0.0056 for silver.
For these good conductors, a drift velocity of a few centimeters per second is
sufﬁcient to produce a noticeable temperature rise and can cause the wire to melt if
the heat cannot be quickly removed by thermal conduction or radiation.
Substituting (6) into Eq. (3) of Section 5.1, we obtain
J = −ρeµeE
(7)
where ρe is the free-electron charge density, a negative value. The total charge density
ρν is zero because equal positive and negative charges are present in the neutral
material. The negative value of ρe and the minus sign lead to a current density J that
is in the same direction as the electric ﬁeld intensity E.
The relationship between J and E for a metallic conductor, however, is also
speciﬁed by the conductivity σ (sigma),
J = σE
(8)

where σ is measured is siemens4 per meter (S/m). One siemens (1 S) is the basic
unit of conductance in the SI system and is deﬁned as one ampere per volt. Formerly,
the unit of conductance was called the mho and was symbolized by an inverted 	.
Just as the siemens honors the Siemens brothers, the reciprocal unit of resistance that
we call the ohm (1 	 is one volt per ampere) honors Georg Simon Ohm, a German
physicist who ﬁrst described the current-voltage relationship implied by Eq. (8). We
call this equation the point form of Ohm’s law; we will look at the more common
form of Ohm’s law shortly.
First, however, it is informative to note the conductivity of several metallic con-
ductors; typical values (in siemens per meter) are 3.82×107 for aluminum, 5.80×107
for copper, and 6.17 × 107 for silver. Data for other conductors may be found in
Appendix C. On seeing data such as these, it is only natural to assume that we are be-
ing presented with constant values; this is essentially true. Metallic conductors obey
Ohm’s law quite faithfully, and it is a linear relationship; the conductivity is constant
over wide ranges of current density and electric ﬁeld intensity. Ohm’s law and the
metallic conductors are also described as isotropic, or having the same properties in
every direction. A material which is not isotropic is called anisotropic, and we shall
mention such a material in Chapter 6.
The conductivity is a function of temperature, however. The resistivity, which
is the reciprocal of the conductivity, varies almost linearly with temperature in the
region of room temperature, and for aluminum, copper, and silver it increases about
0.4 percent for a 1-K rise in temperature.5 For several metals the resistivity drops
abruptly to zero at a temperature of a few kelvin; this property is termed super-
conductivity. Copper and silver are not superconductors, although aluminum is (for
temperatures below 1.14 K).
If we now combine Equations (7) and (8), conductivity may be expressed in terms
of the charge density and the electron mobility,
σ = −ρeµe

electric ﬁeld strength, lower drift velocity, lower mobility, lower conductivity from

The application of Ohm’s law in point form to a macroscopic (visible to the naked
eye) region leads to a more familiar form. Initially, assume that J and E are uniform,
as they are in the cylindrical region shown in Figure 5.3. Because they are uniform,

Equation (12) is, of course, known as Ohm’s law, and Eq. (13) enables us to compute
the resistance R, measured in ohms (abbreviated as 	), of conducting objects which
possess uniform ﬁelds. If the ﬁelds are not uniform, the resistance may still be deﬁned
as the ratio of V to I, where V is the potential difference between two speciﬁed
equipotential surfaces in the material and I is the total current crossing the more
positive surface into the material. From the general integral relationships in Eqs. (10)
and (11), and from Ohm’s law (8), we may write this general expression for resistance

The line integral is taken between two equipotential surfaces in the conductor, and

solve several of them after reading Chapter 6.
EXAMPLE 5.1
As an example of the determination of the resistance of a cylinder, we ﬁnd the resis-
tance of a 1-mile length of #16 copper wire, which has a diameter of 0.0508 in.
Solution. The diameter of the wire is 0.0508×0.0254 = 1.291×10−3 m, the area of
the cross section is π(1.291×10−3/2)2 = 1.308×10−6 m2, and the length is 1609 m.
Using a conductivity of 5.80 × 107 S/m, the resistance of the wire is, therefore,
R =
1609
(5.80 × 107)(1.308 × 10−6) = 21.2 	
This wire can safely carry about 10 A dc, corresponding to a current density of
10/(1.308×10−6) = 7.65×106 A/m2, or 7.65 A/mm2. With this current, the potential
difference between the two ends of the wire is 212 V, the electric ﬁeld intensity is
0.312 V/m, the drift velocity is 0.000 422 m/s, or a little more than one furlong a week,
and the free-electron charge density is −1.81 × 1010 C/m3, or about one electron
within a cube two angstroms on a side.

CONDUCTOR PROPERTIES
AND BOUNDARY CONDITIONS
Once again, we must temporarily depart from our assumed static conditions and let
time vary for a few microseconds to see what happens when the charge distribution is
suddenly unbalanced within a conducting material. Suppose, for the sake of argument,
that there suddenly appear a number of electrons in the interior of a conductor. The
electric ﬁelds set up by these electrons are not counteracted by any positive charges,
and the electrons therefore begin to accelerate away from each other. This continues
until the electrons reach the surface of the conductor or until a number of electrons
equal to the number injected have reached the surface.
Here, the outward progress of the electrons is stopped, for the material surround-
ing the conductor is an insulator not possessing a convenient conduction band. No
charge may remain within the conductor. If it did, the resulting electric ﬁeld would
force the charges to the surface.
Hence the ﬁnal result within a conductor is zero charge density, and a surface
charge density resides on the exterior surface. This is one of the two characteristics
of a good conductor.
The other characteristic, stated for static conditions in which no current may ﬂow,
follows directly from Ohm’s law: the electric ﬁeld intensity within the conductor is
zero. Physically, we see that if an electric ﬁeld were present, the conduction electrons
would move and produce a current, thus leading to a nonstatic condition.
Summarizing for electrostatics, no charge and no electric ﬁeld may exist at any
point within a conducting material. Charge may, however, appear on the surface as a
surface charge density, and our next investigation concerns the ﬁelds external to the
conductor.
Wewishtorelatetheseexternalﬁeldstothechargeonthesurfaceoftheconductor.
The problem is a simple one, and we may ﬁrst talk our way to the solution with a
little mathematics.
If the external electric ﬁeld intensity is decomposed into two components, one
tangential and one normal to the conductor surface, the tangential component is seen
to be zero. If it were not zero, a tangential force would be applied to the elements of
the surface charge, resulting in their motion and nonstatic conditions. Because static
conditions are assumed, the tangential electric ﬁeld intensity and electric ﬂux density
are zero.
Gauss’s law answers our questions concerning the normal component. The elec-
tric ﬂux leaving a small increment of surface must be equal to the charge residing on
that incremental surface. The ﬂux cannot penetrate into the conductor, for the total
ﬁeld there is zero. It must then leave the surface normally. Quantitatively, we may
say that the electric ﬂux density in coulombs per square meter leaving the surface
normally is equal to the surface charge density in coulombs per square meter, or
DN = ρS.
If we use some of our previously derived results in making a more careful analysis
(andincidentallyintroducingageneralmethodwhichwemustuselater),weshouldset
up a boundary between a conductor and free space (Figure 5.4) showing tangential

and normal components of D and E on the free-space side of the boundary. Both
ﬁelds are zero in the conductor. The tangential ﬁeld may be determined by applying

Etw −EN,at b 1
2h + EN,at a 1
2h = 0
As we allow h to approach zero, keeping w small but ﬁnite, it makes no
difference whether or not the normal ﬁelds are equal at a and b, for h causes these
products to become negligibly small. Hence, Etw = 0 and, therefore, Et = 0.
The condition on the normal ﬁeld is found most readily by considering DN rather
than EN and choosing a small cylinder as the gaussian surface. Let the height be h
and the area of the top and bottom faces be S. Again, we let h approach zero.

The electric ﬂux leaves the conductor in a direction normal to the surface, and the
value of the electric ﬂux density is numerically equal to the surface charge density.

s = ρs
(18)
where n is the unit normal vector at the surface that points away from the conductor,
as shown in Figure 5.4, and where both operations are evaluated at the conductor
surface, s. Taking the cross product or the dot product of either ﬁeld quantity with n
gives the tangential or the normal component of the ﬁeld, respectively.
An immediate and important consequence of a zero tangential electric ﬁeld in-
tensity is the fact that a conductor surface is an equipotential surface. The evaluation
of the potential difference between any two points on the surface by the line integral
leads to a zero result, because the path may be chosen on the surface itself where
E · dL = 0.
To summarize the principles which apply to conductors in electrostatic ﬁelds, we
may state that
1.
The static electric ﬁeld intensity inside a conductor is zero.
2.
The static electric ﬁeld intensity at the surface of a conductor is everywhere
directed normal to that surface.
3.
The conductor surface is an equipotential surface.
Using these three principles, there are a number of quantities that may be calcu-
lated at a conductor boundary, given a knowledge of the potential ﬁeld.
EXAMPLE 5.2
Given the potential,
V = 100(x2 −y2)
and a point P(2, −1, 3) that is stipulated to lie on a conductor-to-free-space boundary,
ﬁnd V , E, D, and ρS at P, and also the equation of the conductor surface.
Solution. The potential at point P is
VP = 100[22 −(−1)2] = 300 V

122
ENGINEERING ELECTROMAGNETICS
Figure 5.5
Given point P(2, −1, 3) and the
potential field, V = 100(x2 −y2), we find the
equipotential surface through P is x2 −y2 = 3,
and the streamline through P is xy = −2.
Because the conductor is an equipotential surface, the potential at the entire sur-
face must be 300 V. Moreover, if the conductor is a solid object, then the potential
everywhere in and on the conductor is 300 V, for E = 0 within the conductor.
The equation representing the locus of all points having a potential of 300 V is
300 = 100(x2 −y2)
or
x2 −y2 = 3
This is therefore the equation of the conductor surface; it happens to be a hyperbolic
cylinder, as shown in Figure 5.5. Let us assume arbitrarily that the solid conductor
lies above and to the right of the equipotential surface at point P, whereas free space
is down and to the left.
Next, we ﬁnd E by the gradient operation,
E = −100∇(x2 −y2) = −200xax + 200yay
At point P,
Ep = −400ax −200ay V/m

CHAPTER 5
Conductors and Dielectrics
123
Because D = ϵ0E, we have
DP = 8.854 × 10−12EP = −3.54ax −1.771ay nC/m2
The ﬁeld is directed downward and to the left at P; it is normal to the equipotential
surface. Therefore,
DN = |DP| = 3.96 nC/m2
Thus, the surface charge density at P is
ρS,P = DN = 3.96 nC/m2
Note that if we had taken the region to the left of the equipotential surface as the
conductor, the E ﬁeld would terminate on the surface charge and we would let
ρS = −3.96 nC/m2.

Finally, let us determine the equation of the streamline passing through P.

The line (or surface) through P is obtained when C2 = (2)(−1) = −2. Thus, the
streamline is the trace of another hyperbolic cylinder,
xy = −2
This is also shown on Figure 5.5.

THE METHOD OF IMAGES
One important characteristic of the dipole ﬁeld that we developed in Chapter 4 is
the inﬁnite plane at zero potential that exists midway between the two charges. Such
a plane may be represented by a vanishingly thin conducting plane that is inﬁnite
in extent. The conductor is an equipotential surface at a potential V = 0, and the
electric ﬁeld intensity is therefore normal to the surface. Thus, if we replace the
dipole conﬁguration shown in Figure 5.6a with the single charge and conducting
plane shown in Figure 5.6b, the ﬁelds in the upper half of each ﬁgure are the same.
Below the conducting plane, all ﬁelds are zero, as we have not provided any charges
in that region. Of course, we might also substitute a single negative charge below a
conducting plane for the dipole arrangement and obtain equivalence for the ﬁelds in
the lower half of each region.
If we approach this equivalence from the opposite point of view, we begin with a
single charge above a perfectly conducting plane and then see that we may maintain
the same ﬁelds above the plane by removing the plane and locating a negative charge
at a symmetrical location below the plane. This charge is called the image of the
original charge, and it is the negative of that value.
If we can do this once, linearity allows us to do it again and again, and thus any
charge conﬁguration above an inﬁnite ground plane may be replaced by an arrange-
ment composed of the given charge conﬁguration, its image, and no conducting plane.
This is suggested by the two illustrations of Figure 5.7. In many cases, the potential
ﬁeld of the new system is much easier to ﬁnd since it does not contain the conducting
plane with its unknown surface charge distribution.
As an example of the use of images, let us ﬁnd the surface charge density at
P(2, 5, 0) on the conducting plane z = 0 if there is a line charge of 30 nC/m located
at x = 0, z = 3, as shown in Figure 5.8a. We remove the plane and install an
image line charge of −30 nC/m at x = 0, z = −3, as illustrated in Figure 5.8b.
The ﬁeld at P may now be obtained by superposition of the known ﬁelds of the line

This then is the ﬁeld at (or just above) P in both the conﬁgurations of Figure 5.8, and
it is certainly satisfying to note that the ﬁeld is normal to the conducting plane, as it
must be. Thus, D = ϵ0E = −2.20az nC/m2, and because this is directed toward the
conducting plane, ρS is negative and has a value of −2.20 nC/m2 at P.

SEMICONDUCTORS
If we now turn our attention to an intrinsic semiconductor material, such as pure
germanium or silicon, two types of current carriers are present, electrons and holes.
The electrons are those from the top of the ﬁlled valence band that have received
sufﬁcient energy (usually thermal) to cross the relatively small forbidden band into
the conduction band. The forbidden-band energy gap in typical semiconductors is of
the order of one electronvolt. The vacancies left by these electrons represent unﬁlled
energy states in the valence band which may also move from atom to atom in the
crystal. The vacancy is called a hole, and many semiconductor properties may be
described by treating the hole as if it had a positive charge of e, a mobility, µh, and
an effective mass comparable to that of the electron. Both carriers move in an electric
ﬁeld, and they move in opposite directions; hence each contributes a component of
the total current which is in the same direction as that provided by the other. The
conductivity is therefore a function of both hole and electron concentrations and
mobilities,
σ = −ρeµe + ρhµh
(19)
For pure, or intrinsic, silicon, the electron and hole mobilities are 0.12 and 0.025,
respectively, whereas for germanium, the mobilities are, respectively, 0.36 and 0.17.
These values are given in square meters per volt-second and range from 10 to 100
times as large as those for aluminum, copper, silver, and other metallic conductors.6
These mobilities are given for a temperature of 300 K.
The electron and hole concentrations depend strongly on temperature. At 300 K
the electron and hole volume charge densities are both 0.0024 C/m3in magnitude in
intrinsic silicon and 3.0 C/m3 in intrinsic germanium. These values lead to conductiv-
ities of 0.000 35 S/m in silicon and 1.6 S/m in germanium. As temperature increases,
the mobilities decrease, but the charge densities increase very rapidly. As a result, the
conductivity of silicon increases by a factor of 10 as the temperature increases from
300 to about 330 K and decreases by a factor of 10 as the temperature drops from 300
to about 275 K. Note that the conductivity of the intrinsic semiconductor increases
with temperature, whereas that of a metallic conductor decreases with temperature;
this is one of the characteristic differences between the metallic conductors and the
intrinsic semiconductors.
6 Mobility values for semiconductors are given in References 2, 3, and 5 listed at the end of this chapter.

CHAPTER 5

Intrinsic semiconductors also satisfy the point form of Ohm’s law; that is, the
conductivity is reasonably constant with current density and with the direction of the
current density.

form p-type materials. The process is known as doping, and a donor concentration in
silicon as low as one part in 107 causes an increase in conductivity by a factor of 105.
The range of value of the conductivity is extreme as we go from the best insulating
materials to semiconductors and the ﬁnest conductors. In siemens per meter, σ ranges
from 10−17 for fused quartz, 10−7 for poor plastic insulators, and roughly unity for
semiconductors to almost 108 for metallic conductors at room temperature. These
values cover the remarkably large range of some 25 orders of magnitude.

the conductivity due to holes; (b) the component of the conductivity due to

THE NATURE OF DIELECTRIC
MATERIALS
A dielectric in an electric ﬁeld can be viewed as a free-space arrangement of mi-
croscopic electric dipoles, each of which is composed of a positive and a negative
charge whose centers do not quite coincide.These are not free charges, and they cannot
contribute to the conduction process. Rather, they are bound in place by atomic and
molecular forces and can only shift positions slightly in response to external ﬁelds.
They are called bound charges, in contrast to the free charges that determine conduc-
tivity. The bound charges can be treated as any other sources of the electrostatic ﬁeld.
Therefore, we would not need to introduce the dielectric constant as a new parameter
or to deal with permittivities different from the permittivity of free space; however,
the alternative would be to consider every charge within a piece of dielectric material.
This is too great a price to pay for using all our previous equations in an unmodiﬁed
form, and we shall therefore spend some time theorizing about dielectrics in a quali-
tative way; introducing polarization P, permittivity ϵ, and relative permittivity ϵr; and
developing some quantitative relationships involving these new parameters.
The characteristic that all dielectric materials have in common, whether they are
solid, liquid, or gas, and whether or not they are crystalline in nature, is their ability
to store electric energy. This storage takes place by means of a shift in the relative
positions of the internal, bound positive and negative charges against the normal
molecular and atomic forces.

128
ENGINEERING ELECTROMAGNETICS
This displacement against a restraining force is analogous to lifting a weight
or stretching a spring and represents potential energy. The source of the energy is
the external ﬁeld, the motion of the shifting charges resulting perhaps in a transient
current through a battery that is producing the ﬁeld.
The actual mechanism of the charge displacement differs in the various dielectric
materials. Some molecules, termed polar molecules, have a permanent displacement
existing between the centers of “gravity” of the positive and negative charges, and
each pair of charges acts as a dipole. Normally the dipoles are oriented in a random
way throughout the interior of the material, and the action of the external ﬁeld is to
align these molecules, to some extent, in the same direction. A sufﬁciently strong
ﬁeld may even produce an additional displacement between the positive and negative
charges.
A nonpolar molecule does not have this dipole arrangement until after a ﬁeld is
applied. The negative and positive charges shift in opposite directions against their
mutual attraction and produce a dipole that is aligned with the electric ﬁeld.
Either type of dipole may be described by its dipole moment p, as developed in
Section 4.7, Eq. (36),
p = Qd
(20)
where Q is the positive one of the two bound charges composing the dipole, and d is
the vector from the negative to the positive charge. We note again that the units of p
are coulomb-meters.
If there are n dipoles per unit volume and we deal with a volume ν, then there
are n ν dipoles, and the total dipole moment is obtained by the vector sum,
ptotal =
n ν
	
i=1
pi
If the dipoles are aligned in the same general direction, ptotal may have a signiﬁcant
value. However, a random orientation may cause ptotal to be essentially zero.
We now deﬁne the polarization P as the dipole moment per unit volume,
P = lim
ν→0
1
ν
n ν
	
i=1
pi
(21)
with units of coulombs per square meter. We will treat P as a typical continuous ﬁeld,
even though it is obvious that it is essentially undeﬁned at points within an atom
or molecule. Instead, we should think of its value at any point as an average value
taken over a sample volume ν—large enough to contain many molecules (n ν in
number), but yet sufﬁciently small to be considered incremental in concept.
Our immediate goal is to show that the bound-volume charge density acts like
the free-volume charge density in producing an external ﬁeld; we will obtain a result
similar to Gauss’s law.
To be speciﬁc, assume that we have a dielectric containing nonpolar molecules.
No molecule has a dipole moment, and P = 0 throughout the material. Somewhere in
the interior of the dielectric we select an incremental surface element S, as shown
in Figure 5.9a, and apply an electric ﬁeld E. The electric ﬁeld produces a moment

CHAPTER 5

129
Figure 5.9
(a) An incremental surface element S is shown in the interior of a
dielectric in which an electric field E is present. (b) The nonpolar molecules form dipole
moments p and a polarization P. There is a net transfer of bound charge across S.
p = Qd in each molecule, such that p and d make an angle θ with S, as indicated
in Figure 5.9b.
The bound charges will now move across S. Each of the charges associated
with the creation of a dipole must have moved a distance 1
2d cos θ in the direction
perpendicular to S. Thus, any positive charges initially lying below the surface S
and within the distance 1
2d cos θ of the surface must have crossed S going upward.
Also, any negative charges initially lying above the surface and within that distance
( 1
2d cos θ) from S must have crossed S going downward. Therefore, because there
are n molecules/m3, the net total charge that crosses the elemental surface in an upward
direction is equal to nQd cos θS, or
Qb = nQd · S
where the subscript on Qb reminds us that we are dealing with a bound charge and
not a free charge. In terms of the polarization, we have
Qb = P · S
If we interpret S as an element of a closed surface inside the dielectric material,
then the direction of S is outward, and the net increase in the bound charge within
the closed surface is obtained through the integral
Qb = −

S
P · dS
(22)

130
ENGINEERING ELECTROMAGNETICS
This last relationship has some resemblance to Gauss’s law, and we may now gener-
alize our deﬁnition of electric ﬂux density so that it applies to media other than free
space. We ﬁrst write Gauss’s law in terms of ϵ0E and QT, the total enclosed charge,
bound plus free:
QT =

S
ϵ0E · dS
(23)
where
QT = Qb + Q
and Q is the total free charge enclosed by the surface S. Note that the free charge
appears without a subscript because it is the most important type of charge and will
appear in Maxwell’s equations.
Combining these last three equations, we obtain an expression for the free charge
enclosed,
Q = QT −Qb =

S
(ϵ0E + P) · dS
(24)
D is now deﬁned in more general terms than was done in Chapter 3,
D = ϵ0E + P
(25)
There is thus an added term to D that appears when polarizable material is present.
Thus,
Q =

S
D · dS
(26)
where Q is the free charge enclosed.
Utilizing the several volume charge densities, we have
Qb =

ν
ρb dv
Q =

ν
ρν dv
QT =

ν
ρT dv
With the help of the divergence theorem, we may therefore transform Eqs. (22), (23),
and (26) into the equivalent divergence relationships,
∇· P = −ρb
∇· ϵ0E = ρT
∇· D = ρν
(27)
We will emphasize only Eq. (26) and (27), the two expressions involving the free
charge, in the work that follows.

CHAPTER 5
Conductors and Dielectrics
131
In order to make any real use of these new concepts, it is necessary to know the
relationship between the electric ﬁeld intensity E and the polarization P that results.
This relationship will, of course, be a function of the type of material, and we will
essentially limit our discussion to those isotropic materials for which E and P are
linearly related. In an isotropic material, the vectors E and P are always parallel,
regardless of the orientation of the ﬁeld. Although most engineering dielectrics are
linear for moderate-to-large ﬁeld strengths and are also isotropic, single crystals may
be anisotropic. The periodic nature of crystalline materials causes dipole moments to
be formed most easily along the crystal axes, and not necessarily in the direction of
the applied ﬁeld.
In ferroelectric materials, the relationship between P and E not only is nonlin-
ear, but also shows hysteresis effects; that is, the polarization produced by a given
electric ﬁeld intensity depends on the past history of the sample. Important examples
of this type of dielectric are barium titanate, often used in ceramic capacitors, and
Rochelle salt.
The linear relationship between P and E is
P = χeϵ0E
(28)
where χe (chi) is a dimensionless quantity called the electric susceptibility of the
material.
Using this relationship in Eq. (25), we have
D = ϵ0E + χeϵ0E = (χe + 1)ϵ0E
The expression within the parentheses is now deﬁned as
ϵr = χe + 1
(29)
This is another dimensionless quantity, and it is known as the relative permittivity, or
dielectric constant of the material. Thus,
D = ϵ0ϵrE = ϵE
(30)
where
ϵ = ϵ0ϵr
(31)
and ϵ is the permittivity. The dielectric constants are given for some representative
materials in Appendix C.
Anisotropic dielectric materials cannot be described in terms of a simple suscep-
tibility or permittivity parameter. Instead, we ﬁnd that each component of D may be
a function of every component of E, and D = ϵE becomes a matrix equation where
D and E are each 3 × 1 column matrices and ϵ is a 3 × 3 square matrix. Expanding
the matrix equation gives
Dx = ϵxx Ex + ϵxy Ey + ϵxz Ez
Dy = ϵyx Ex + ϵyy Ey + ϵyz Ez
Dz = ϵzx Ex + ϵzy Ey + ϵzz Ez

132
ENGINEERING ELECTROMAGNETICS
Note that the elements of the matrix depend on the selection of the coordinate axes in
the anisotropic material. Certain choices of axis directions lead to simpler matrices.7
D and E (and P) are no longer parallel, and although D = ϵ0E + P remains
a valid equation for anisotropic materials, we may continue to use D = ϵE only
by interpreting it as a matrix equation. We will concentrate our attention on linear
isotropic materials and reserve the general case for a more advanced text.
In summary, then, we now have a relationship between D and E that depends on
the dielectric material present,
D = ϵE
(30)
where
ϵ = ϵ0ϵr
(31)
This electric ﬂux density is still related to the free charge by either the point or integral
form of Gauss’s law:
∇· D = ρν
(27)

S
D · dS = Q
(26)
Use of the relative permittivity, as indicated by Eq. (31), makes consideration
of the polarization, dipole moments, and bound charge unnecessary. However, when
anisotropic or nonlinear materials must be considered, the relative permittivity, in the
simple scalar form that we have discussed, is no longer applicable.
EXAMPLE 5.4
We locate a slab of Teﬂon in the region 0 ≤x ≤a, and assume free space where
x < 0 and x > a. Outside the Teﬂon there is a uniform ﬁeld Eout = E0ax V/m. We
seek values for D, E, and P everywhere.
Solution. The dielectric constant of the Teﬂon is 2.1, and thus the electric suscepti-
bility is 1.1.
Outside the slab, we have immediately Dout = ϵ0E0ax. Also, as there is no
dielectric material there, Pout = 0. Now, any of the last four or ﬁve equations will
enable us to relate the several ﬁelds inside the material to each other. Thus
Din = 2.1ϵ0Ein
(0 ≤x ≤a)
Pin = 1.1ϵ0Ein
(0 ≤x ≤a)
7 A more complete discussion of this matrix may be found in the Ramo, Whinnery, and Van Duzer
reference listed at the end of this chapter.

CHAPTER 5
Conductors and Dielectrics
133
As soon as we establish a value for any of these three ﬁelds within the dielectric, the
other two can be found immediately. The difﬁculty lies in crossing over the boundary
from the known ﬁelds external to the dielectric to the unknown ones within it. To do
this we need a boundary condition, and this is the subject of the next section. We will
complete this example then.
In the remainder of this text we will describe polarizable materials in terms of D
and ϵ rather than P and χe. We will limit our discussion to isotropic materials.

contains a uniform electric ﬂux density of 8 nC/m2. If the material is lossless,

BOUNDARY CONDITIONS FOR PERFECT
DIELECTRIC MATERIALS
How do we attack a problem in which there are two different dielectrics, or a dielectric
and a conductor? This is another example of a boundary condition, such as the condi-
tion at the surface of a conductor whereby the tangential ﬁelds are zero and the normal
electric ﬂux density is equal to the surface charge density on the conductor. Now we
take the ﬁrst step in solving a two-dielectric problem, or a dielectric-conductor prob-
lem, by determining the behavior of the ﬁelds at the dielectric interface.
Let us ﬁrst consider the interface between two dielectrics having permittivities
ϵ1 and ϵ2 and occupying regions 1 and 2, as shown in Figure 5.10. We ﬁrst examine
n
Figure 5.10
The boundary between perfect dielectrics of permittivities ϵ1
and ϵ2. The continuity of DN is shown by the gaussian surface on the right,
and the continuity of Etan is shown by the line integral about the closed path
at the left.

134
ENGINEERING ELECTROMAGNETICS
the tangential components by using

E · dL = 0
around the small closed path on the left, obtaining
Etan 1 w −Etan 2 w = 0
The small contribution to the line integral by the normal component of E along
the sections of length h becomes negligible as h decreases and the closed path
crowds the surface. Immediately, then,
Etan 1 = Etan 2
(32)
Evidently, Kirchhoff’s voltage law is still applicable to this case. Certainly we have
shown that the potential difference between any two points on the boundary that are
separated by a distance w is the same immediately above or below the boundary.
If the tangential electric ﬁeld intensity is continuous across the boundary, then
tangential D is discontinuous, for
Dtan 1
ϵ1
= Etan 1 = Etan 2 = Dtan 2
ϵ2
or
Dtan 1
Dtan 2
= ϵ1
ϵ2
(33)
The boundary conditions on the normal components are found by applying
Gauss’s law to the small “pillbox” shown at the right in Figure 5.10. The sides are
again very short, and the ﬂux leaving the top and bottom surfaces is the difference
DN1S −DN2S = Q = ρSS
from which
DN1 −DN2 = ρS
(34)
What is this surface charge density? It cannot be a bound surface charge density,
because we are taking the polarization of the dielectric into effect by using a dielectric
constant different from unity; that is, instead of considering bound charges in free
space, we are using an increased permittivity. Also, it is extremely unlikely that any
free charge is on the interface, for no free charge is available in the perfect dielectrics
we are considering. This charge must then have been placed there deliberately, thus
unbalancing the total charge in and on this dielectric body. Except for this special
case, then, we may assume ρS is zero on the interface and
DN1 = DN2
(35)

CHAPTER 5
Conductors and Dielectrics
135
or the normal component of D is continuous. It follows that
ϵ1EN1 = ϵ2EN2
(36)
and normal E is discontinuous.
Equations (32) and (34) can be written in terms of ﬁeld vectors in any direction,
along with the unit normal to the surface as shown in Figure 5.10. Formally stated,
the boundary conditions for the electric ﬂux density and the electric ﬁeld strength at
the surface of a perfect dielectric are
(D1 −D2) · n = ρs
(37)
which is the general statement of Eq. (32), and
(E1 −E2) × n = 0
(38)
generally states Eq. (34). This construction was used previously in Eqs. (17) and (18)
for a conducting surface, in which the normal or tangential components of the ﬁelds
are obtained through the dot product or cross product with the normal, respectively.
These conditions may be used to show the change in the vectors D and
E at the surface. Let D1 (and E1) make an angle θ1 with a normal to the surface
(Figure 5.11). Because the normal components of D are continuous,
DN1 = D1 cos θ1 = D2 cos θ2 = DN2
(39)
The ratio of the tangential components is given by (33) as
Dtan 1
Dtan 2
= D1 sin θ1
D2 sin θ2
= ϵ1
ϵ2
or
ϵ2D1 sin θ1 = ϵ1D2 sin θ2
(40)

dielectric interface. For the case shown,
ϵ1 > ϵ2; E1 and E2 are directed along D1
and D2, with D1 > D2 and E1 < E2.

136
ENGINEERING ELECTROMAGNETICS
and the division of this equation by (39) gives
tan θ1
tan θ2
= ϵ1
ϵ2
(41)
In Figure 5.11 we have assumed that ϵ1 > ϵ2, and therefore θ1 > θ2.
The direction of E on each side of the boundary is identical with the direction of
D, because D = ϵE.
The magnitude of D in region 2 may be found from Eq. (39) and (40),
D2 = D1

cos2 θ1 +

2
sin2 θ1
(42)
and the magnitude of E2 is
E2 = E1

sin2 θ1 +
ϵ1
ϵ2
2
cos2 θ1
(43)
An inspection of these equations shows that D is larger in the region of larger permit-
tivity (unless θ1 = θ2 = 0◦where the magnitude is unchanged) and that E is larger
in the region of smaller permittivity (unless θ1 = θ2 = 90◦, where its magnitude is
unchanged).
EXAMPLE 5.5
Complete Example 5.4 by ﬁnding the ﬁelds within the Teﬂon (ϵr = 2.1), given the
uniform external ﬁeld Eout = E0ax in free space.
Solution. We recall that we had a slab of Teﬂon extending from x = 0 to x = a,
as shown in Figure 5.12, with free space on both sides of it and an external ﬁeld
Eout = E0ax. We also have Dout = ϵ0E0ax and Pout = 0.
Inside, the continuity of DN at the boundary allows us to ﬁnd that Din = Dout =
ϵ0E0ax. This gives us Ein = Din/ϵ = ϵ0E0ax/(ϵrϵ0) = 0.476E0ax. To get the polar-
ization ﬁeld in the dielectric, we use D = ϵ0E + P and obtain
Pin = Din −ϵ0Ein = ϵ0E0ax −0.476ϵ0E0ax = 0.524ϵ0E0ax
Summarizing then gives
Din = ϵ0E0ax
(0 ≤x ≤a)
Ein = 0.476E0ax
(0 ≤x ≤a)
Pin = 0.524ϵ0E0ax
(0 ≤x ≤a)
A practical problem most often does not provide us with a direct knowledge of
the ﬁeld on either side of the boundary. The boundary conditions must be used to help
us determine the ﬁelds on both sides of the boundary from the other information that
is given.

A knowledge of the electric field external to the dielectric
enables us to find the remaining external fields first and then to use the
continuity of normal D to begin finding the internal fields.

apacitance measures the capability of energy storage in electrical devices.
It can be deliberately designed for a speciﬁc purpose, or it may exist as
an unavoidable by-product of the device structure that one must live with.
Understanding capacitance and its impact on device or system operation is critical in
every aspect of electrical engineering.
A capacitor is a device that stores energy; energy thus stored can either be as-
sociated with accumulated charge or it can be related to the stored electric ﬁeld,
as was discussed in Section 4.8. In fact, one can think of a capacitor as a device
that stores electric ﬂux, in a similar way that an inductor — an analogous device —
stores magnetic ﬂux (or ultimately magnetic ﬁeld energy). We will explore this in
Chapter 8. A primary goal in this chapter is to present the methods for calculating
capacitance for a number of cases, including transmission line geometries, and to be
able to make judgments on how capacitance will be altered by changes in materials
or their conﬁguration. ■
6.1
CAPACITANCE DEFINED
Consider two conductors embedded in a homogeneous dielectric (Figure 6.1). Con-
ductor M2 carries a total positive charge Q, and M1 carries an equal negative charge.
There are no other charges present, and the total charge of the system is zero.
We now know that the charge is carried on the surface as a surface charge density
and also that the electric ﬁeld is normal to the conductor surface. Each conductor
is, moreover, an equipotential surface. Because M2 carries the positive charge, the
electric ﬂux is directed from M2 to M1, and M2 is at the more positive potential. In
other words, work must be done to carry a positive charge from M1 to M2.
Let us designate the potential difference between M2 and M1 as V0. We may now
deﬁne the capacitance of this two-conductor system as the ratio of the magnitude
143

144

of the total charge on either conductor to the magnitude of the potential difference
between conductors,
C = Q

(1)
In general terms, we determine Q by a surface integral over the positive conductors,
and we ﬁnd V0 by carrying a unit positive charge from the negative to the positive
surface,
C =

S ϵE · dS
−
 +
−E · dL
(2)
The capacitance is independent of the potential and total charge, for their ratio
is constant. If the charge density is increased by a factor of N, Gauss’s law indicates
that the electric ﬂux density or electric ﬁeld intensity also increases by N, as does the
potential difference. The capacitance is a function only of the physical dimensions of
the system of conductors and of the permittivity of the homogeneous dielectric.
Capacitance is measured in farads (F), where a farad is deﬁned as one coulomb
per volt. Common values of capacitance are apt to be very small fractions of a farad,
and consequently more practical units are the microfarad (µF), the nanofarad (nF),
and the picofarad (pF).

6.2
PARALLEL-PLATE CAPACITOR
We can apply the deﬁnition of capacitance to a simple two-conductor system in which
the conductors are identical, inﬁnite parallel planes with separation d (Figure 6.2).
Choosing the lower conducting plane at z = 0 and the upper one at z = d, a uniform
sheet of surface charge ±ρS on each conductor leads to the uniform ﬁeld [Section
2.5, Eq. (18)]
E = ρS
ϵ az
where the permittivity of the homogeneous dielectric is ϵ, and
D = ρSaz
Note that this result could be obtained by applying the boundary condition at a
conducting surface (Eq. (18), Chapter 5) at either one of the plate surfaces. Referring
to the surfaces and their unit normal vectors in Fig. 6.2, where nℓ= az and nu = −az,
we ﬁnd on the lower plane:
D · nℓ

z=0 = D · az = ρs ⇒D = ρs az
On the upper plane, we get the same result
D · nu

z=d = D · (−az) = −ρs ⇒D = ρs az
This is a key advantage of the conductor boundary condition, in that we need to
apply it only to a single boundary to obtain the total ﬁeld there (arising from all other
sources).
The potential difference between lower and upper planes is
V0 = −

Since the total charge on either plane is inﬁnite, the capacitance is inﬁnite. A more
practical answer is obtained by considering planes, each of area S, whose linear
dimensions are much greater than their separation d. The electric ﬁeld and charge

latter region contributes only a small percentage of the total capacitance, allowing us
to write the familiar result
Q = ρSS
V0 = ρS

C = Q

(3)
More rigorously, we might consider Eq. (3) as the capacitance of a portion of the
inﬁnite-plane arrangement having a surface area S. Methods of calculating the effect
of the unknown and nonuniform distribution near the edges must wait until we are
able to solve more complicated potential problems.
EXAMPLE 6.1
Calculate the capacitance of a parallel-plate capacitor having a mica dielectric, ϵr = 6,
a plate area of 10 in.2, and a separation of 0.01 in.
Solution. We may ﬁnd that
S = 10 × 0.02542 = 6.45 × 10−3 m2
d = 0.01 × 0.0254 = 2.54 × 10−4 m
and therefore
C = 6 × 8.854 × 10−12 × 6.45 × 10−3
2.54 × 10−4
= 1.349 nF
A large plate area is obtained in capacitors of small physical dimensions by
stacking smaller plates in 50- or 100-decker sandwiches, or by rolling up foil plates
separated by a ﬂexible dielectric.
Table C.1 in Appendix C also indicates that materials are available having di-
electric constants greater than 1000.

SEVERAL CAPACITANCE EXAMPLES
As a ﬁrst brief example, we choose a coaxial cable or coaxial capacitor of inner
radius a, outer radius b, and length L. No great derivational struggle is required,
because the potential difference is given as Eq. (11) in Section 4.3, and we ﬁnd the
capacitance very simply by dividing this by the total charge ρL L in the length L.
Thus,
C = 2πϵL
ln(b/a)
(5)
Next we consider a spherical capacitor formed of two concentric spherical con-
ducting shells of radius a and b, b > a. The expression for the electric ﬁeld was
obtained previously by Gauss’s law,
Er =
Q
4πϵr2
where the region between the spheres is a dielectric with permittivity ϵ. The expression
for potential difference was found from this by the line integral [Section 4.3, Eq. (12)].
Thus,

In order to look at the problem of multiple dielectrics a little more thoroughly,
let us consider a parallel-plate capacitor of area S and spacing d, with the usual
assumption that d is small compared to the linear dimensions of the plates. The
capacitance is ϵ1S/d, using a dielectric of permittivity ϵ1. Now replace a part of
this dielectric by another of permittivity ϵ2, placing the boundary between the two
dielectrics parallel to the plates (Figure 6.3).
Some of us may immediately suspect that this combination is effectively two
capacitors in series, yielding a total capacitance of
C =
1

C1
+ 1
C2

CHAPTER 6
Capacitance
149
where C1 = ϵ1S/d1 and C2 = ϵ2S/d2. This is the correct result, but we can obtain it
using less intuition and a more basic approach.
Because the capacitance deﬁnition, C = Q/V , involves a charge and a voltage,
we may assume either and then ﬁnd the other in terms of it. The capacitance is not a
function of either, but only of the dielectrics and the geometry. Suppose we assume
a potential difference V0 between the plates. The electric ﬁeld intensities in the two
regions, E2 and E1, are both uniform, and V0 = E1d1 + E2d2. At the dielectric
interface, E is normal, and our boundary condition, Eq. (35) Chapter 5, tells us that
DN1 = DN2, or ϵ1E1 = ϵ2E2. This assumes (correctly) that there is no surface charge
at the interface. Eliminating E2 in our V0 relation, we have
E1 =
V0
d1 + d2(ϵ1/ϵ2)
and the surface charge density on the lower plate therefore has the magnitude
ρS1 = D1 = ϵ1E1 =
V0
d1
ϵ1
+ d2
ϵ2
Because D1 = D2, the magnitude of the surface charge is the same on each plate.
The capacitance is then

V0
= ρSS
V0
=

ϵ1S + d2
ϵ2S

As an alternate (and slightly simpler) solution, we might assume a charge Q on
one plate, leading to a charge density Q/S and a value of D that is also Q/S. This is
true in both regions, as DN1 = DN2 and D is normal. Then E1 = D/ϵ1 = Q/(ϵ1S),
E2 = D/ϵ2 = Q/(ϵ2S), and the potential differences across the regions are V1 =
E1d1 = Qd1/(ϵ1S), and V2 = E2d2 = Qd2/(ϵ2S). The capacitance is
C = Q
V =

V1 + V2

(9)
How would the method of solution or the answer change if there were a third
conducting plane along the interface? We would now expect to ﬁnd surface charge on
each side of this conductor, and the magnitudes of these charges should be equal. In
other words, we think of the electric lines not as passing directly from one outer plate
to the other, but as terminating on one side of this interior plane and then continuing
on the other side. The capacitance is unchanged, provided, of course, that the added
conductor is of negligible thickness. The addition of a thick conducting plate will
increase the capacitance if the separation of the outer plates is kept constant, and this
is an example of a more general theorem which states that the replacement of any
portion of the dielectric by a conducting body will cause an increase in the capacitance.
If the dielectric boundary were placed normal to the two conducting plates and
the dielectrics occupied areas of S1 and S2, then an assumed potential difference V0
would produce ﬁeld strengths E1 = E2 = V0/d. These are tangential ﬁelds at the

150

interface, and they must be equal. Then we may ﬁnd in succession D1, D2, ρS1, ρS2,
and Q, obtaining a capacitance
C = ϵ1S1 + ϵ2S2
d
= C1 + C2
(10)
as we should expect.
At this time we can do very little with a capacitor in which two dielectrics
are used in such a way that the interface is not everywhere normal or parallel to
the ﬁelds. Certainly we know the boundary conditions at each conductor and at the
dielectric interface; however, we do not know the ﬁelds to which to apply the boundary
conditions. Such a problem must be put aside until our knowledge of ﬁeld theory has
increased and we are willing and able to use more advanced mathematical techniques.

CAPACITANCE OF A TWO-WIRE LINE
We next consider the problem of the two-wire line. The conﬁguration consists of two
parallel conducting cylinders, each of circular cross section, and we will ﬁnd complete
information about the electric ﬁeld intensity, the potential ﬁeld, the surface-charge-
density distribution, and the capacitance. This arrangement is an important type of

respectively. The equipotential surfaces are circular cylinders.
We choose R10 = R20, thus placing the zero reference at equal distances from each

In order to recognize the equipotential surfaces and adequately understand the
problem we are going to solve, some algebraic manipulations are necessary. Choosing
an equipotential surface V = V1, we deﬁne K1 as a dimensionless parameter that is
a function of the potential V1,
K1 = e4πϵV1/ρL
(12)
so that
K1 = (x + a)2 + y2
(x −a)2 + y2
After multiplying and collecting like powers, we obtain
x2 −2ax K1 + 1

which is centered at x = h, y = 0, where
h = a K1 + 1
K1 −1
Now let us attack a physical problem by considering a zero-potential conducting
plane located at x = 0, and a conducting cylinder of radius b and potential V0 with
its axis located a distance h from the plane. We solve the last two equations for a and
K1 in terms of the dimensions b and h,
a =

(13)
and

K1 = h +

But the potential of the cylinder is V0, so Eq. (12) leads to

Therefore,

(15)
Thus, given h, b, and V0, we may determine a, ρL, and the parameter K1. The

is one-half the capacitance given by Eqs. (16) or (17). This last answer is of inter-

USING FIELD SKETCHES TO ESTIMATE
CAPACITANCE IN TWO-DIMENSIONAL
PROBLEMS
In capacitance problems in which the conductor conﬁgurations cannot be easily de-
scribedusingasinglecoordinatesystem,otheranalysistechniquesareusuallyapplied.
Such methods typically involve a numerical determination of ﬁeld or potential values
over a grid within the region of interest. In this section, another approach is described
that involves making sketches of ﬁeld lines and equipotential surfaces in a manner
that follows a few simple rules. This approach, although lacking the accuracy of more

CHAPTER 6
Capacitance
155
elegant methods, allows fairly quick estimates of capacitance while providing a useful
visualization of the ﬁeld conﬁguration.
The method, requiring only pencil and paper, is capable of yielding good accu-
racy if used skillfully and patiently. Fair accuracy (5 to 10 percent on a capacitance
determination) may be obtained by a beginner who does no more than follow the
few rules and hints of the art. The method to be described is applicable only to ﬁelds
in which no variation exists in the direction normal to the plane of the sketch. The
procedure is based on several facts that we have already demonstrated:
1.
A conductor boundary is an equipotential surface.
2.
The electric ﬁeld intensity and electric ﬂux density are both perpendicular to the
equipotential surfaces.
3.
E and D are therefore perpendicular to the conductor boundaries and possess
zero tangential values.
4.
The lines of electric ﬂux, or streamlines, begin and terminate on charge and
hence, in a charge-free, homogeneous dielectric, begin and terminate only on
the conductor boundaries.
We consider the implications of these statements by drawing the streamlines on
a sketch that already shows the equipotential surfaces. In Figure 6.6a, two conductor
boundaries are shown, and equipotentials are drawn with a constant potential differ-
ence between lines. We should remember that these lines are only the cross sections
of the equipotential surfaces, which are cylinders (although not circular). No variation
in the direction normal to the surface of the paper is permitted. We arbitrarily choose
to begin a streamline, or ﬂux line, at A on the surface of the more positive conductor.
It leaves the surface normally and must cross at right angles the undrawn but very
real equipotential surfaces between the conductor and the ﬁrst surface shown. The
line is continued to the other conductor, obeying the single rule that the intersection
with each equipotential must be square.
In a similar manner, we may start at B and sketch another streamline ending
at B′. We need to understand the meaning of this pair of streamlines. The streamline,
Figure 6.6

increment of potential between each of the two adjacent equipotentials is the same.
(b) One flux line has been drawn from A to A′, and a second from B to B′.

156
ENGINEERING ELECTROMAGNETICS
by deﬁnition, is everywhere tangent to the electric ﬁeld intensity or to the electric ﬂux
density. Because the streamline is tangent to the electric ﬂux density, the ﬂux density
is tangent to the streamline, and no electric ﬂux may cross any streamline. In other
words, if there is a charge of 5 µC on the surface between A and B (and extending
1 m into the paper), then 5 µC of ﬂux begins in this region, and all must terminate
between A′ and B′. Such a pair of lines is sometimes called a ﬂux tube, because it
physically seems to carry ﬂux from one conductor to another without losing any.
We next construct a third streamline, and both the mathematical and visual in-
terpretations we may make from the sketch will be greatly simpliﬁed if we draw this
line starting from some point C chosen so that the same amount of ﬂux is carried in
the tube BC as is contained in AB. How do we choose the position of C?
The electric ﬁeld intensity at the midpoint of the line joining A to B may be
found approximately by assuming a value for the ﬂux in the tube AB, say , which
allows us to express the electric ﬂux density by /Lt, where the depth of the tube
into the paper is 1 m and Lt is the length of the line joining A to B. The magnitude
of E is then
E = 1
ϵ

Lt
We may also ﬁnd the magnitude of the electric ﬁeld intensity by dividing the
potential difference between points A and A1, lying on two adjacent equipotential
surfaces, by the distance from A to A1. If this distance is designated L N and an
increment of potential between equipotentials of V is assumed, then
E = V
L N
This value applies most accurately to the point at the middle of the line segment
from A to A1, while the previous value was most accurate at the midpoint of the line
segment from A to B. If, however, the equipotentials are close together (V small)
and the two streamlines are close together ( small), the two values found for the
electric ﬁeld intensity must be approximately equal,
1
ϵ

Lt
= V
L N
(18)
Throughout our sketch we have assumed a homogeneous medium (ϵ constant), a
constant increment of potential between equipotentials (V constant), and a constant
amount of ﬂux per tube ( constant). To satisfy all these conditions, Eq. (18) shows
that
Lt
L N
= constant = 1
ϵ

V
(19)
A similar argument might be made at any point in our sketch, and we are therefore
led to the conclusion that a constant ratio must be maintained between the distance
between streamlines as measured along an equipotential, and the distance between
equipotentials as measured along a streamline. It is this ratio that must have the same
value at every point, not the individual lengths. Each length must decrease in regions
of greater ﬁeld strength, because V is constant.

CHAPTER 6
Capacitance
157
Figure 6.7
The remaining of the
streamlines have been added to
Fig. 6.6b by beginning each new line
normally to the conductor and
maintaining curvilinear squares
throughout the sketch.
The simplest ratio we can use is unity, and the streamline from B to B′ shown in
Figure 6.6b was started at a point for which Lt = L N. Because the ratio of these
distances is kept at unity, the streamlines and equipotentials divide the ﬁeld-containing
region into curvilinear squares, a term implying a planar geometric ﬁgure that differs
from a true square in having slightly curved and slightly unequal sides but which
approaches a square as its dimensions decrease. Those incremental surface elements
in our three coordinate systems which are planar may also be drawn as curvilinear
squares.
We may now sketch in the remainder of the streamlines by keeping each small
box as square as possible. One streamline is begun, an equipotential line is roughed
in, another streamline is added, forming a curvilinear square, and the map is gradually
extended throughout the desired region. The complete sketch is shown in Figure 6.7.
The construction of a useful ﬁeld map is an art; the science merely furnishes
the rules. Proﬁciency in any art requires practice. A good problem for beginners is
the coaxial cable or coaxial capacitor, since all the equipotentials are circles while the
ﬂux lines are straight lines. The next sketch attempted should be two parallel circular
conductors, where the equipotentials are again circles but with different centers. Each
of these is given as a problem at the end of the chapter.
Figure 6.8 shows a completed map for a cable containing a square inner conductor
surrounded by a circular conductor. The capacitance is found from C = Q/V0 by
replacing Q by NQQ = NQ, where NQ is the number of ﬂux tubes joining
the two conductors, and letting V0 = NV V, where NV is the number of potential
increments between conductors,
C = NQQ

since Lt/L N = 1. The determination of the capacitance from a ﬂux plot merely
consists of counting squares in two directions, between conductors and around either
conductor. From Figure 6.8 we obtain

Ramo, Whinnery, and Van Duzer have an excellent discussion with examples
of the construction of ﬁeld maps by curvilinear squares. They offer the following
suggestions:1
1.
Plan on making a number of rough sketches, taking only a minute or so apiece,
before starting any plot to be made with care. The use of transparent paper over
the basic boundary will speed up this preliminary sketching.
2.
Divide the known potential difference between electrodes into an equal number
of divisions, say four or eight to begin with.
3.
Begin the sketch of equipotentials in the region where the ﬁeld is known best,
for example, in some region where it approaches a uniform ﬁeld. Extend the
equipotentials according to your best guess throughout the plot. Note that they
should tend to hug acute angles of the conducting boundary and be spread out
in the vicinity of obtuse angles of the boundary.

of this chapter. Curvilinear maps are discussed on pp. 50–52.

CHAPTER 6
Capacitance
159
4.
Draw in the orthogonal set of ﬁeld lines. As these are started, they should form
curvilinear squares, but, as they are extended, the condition of orthogonality
should be kept paramount, even though this will result in some rectangles with
ratios other than unity.
5.
Look at the regions with poor side ratios and try to see what was wrong with the
ﬁrst guess of equipotentials. Correct them and repeat the procedure until
reasonable curvilinear squares exist throughout the plot.
6.
In regions of low ﬁeld intensity, there will be large ﬁgures, often of ﬁve or six
sides. To judge the correctness of the plot in this region, these large units should
be subdivided. The subdivisions should be started back away from the region
needing subdivision, and each time a ﬂux tube is divided in half, the potential
divisions in this region must be divided by the same factor.
D6.4. Figure 6.9 shows the cross section of two circular cylinders at potentials
of 0 and 60 V. The axes are parallel and the region between the cylinders is air-
ﬁlled. Equipotentials at 20 V and 40 V are also shown. Prepare a curvilinear-
square map on the ﬁgure and use it to establish suitable values for: (a) the
capacitance per meter length; (b) E at the left side of the 60 V conductor if its
true radius is 2 mm; (c) ρS at that point.

POISSON’S AND LAPLACE’S EQUATIONS
In preceding sections, we have found capacitance by ﬁrst assuming a known charge
distribution on the conductors and then ﬁnding the potential difference in terms of
the assumed charge. An alternate approach would be to start with known potentials
on each conductor, and then work backward to ﬁnd the charge in terms of the known
potential difference. The capacitance in either case is found by the ratio Q/V .
The ﬁrst objective in the latter approach is thus to ﬁnd the potential function
between conductors, given values of potential on the boundaries, along with possible
volume charge densities in the region of interest. The mathematical tools that enable
this to happen are Poisson’s and Laplace’s equations, to be explored in the remainder
of this chapter. Problems involving one to three dimensions can be solved either ana-
lytically or numerically. Laplace’s and Poisson’s equations, when compared to other
methods, are probably the most widely useful because many problems in engineering
practice involve devices in which applied potential differences are known, and in
which constant potentials occur at the boundaries.
Obtaining Poisson’s equation is exceedingly simple, for from the point form of
Gauss’s law,
∇· D = ρν
(21)
the deﬁnition of D,
D = ϵE
(22)
and the gradient relationship,
E = −∇V

∇· D = ∇· (ϵE) = −∇· (ϵ∇V ) = ρν
or
∇· ∇V = −ρν
ϵ
(24)
for a homogeneous region in which ϵ is constant.
Equation (24) is Poisson’s equation, but the “double ∇” operation must be inter-
preted and expanded, at least in rectangular coordinates, before the equation can be
useful. In rectangular coordinates,
∇· A = ∂Ax
∂x + ∂Ay
∂y + ∂Az
∂z
∇V = ∂V
∂x ax + ∂V
∂y ay + ∂V

in rectangular coordinates.
If ρν = 0, indicating zero volume charge density, but allowing point charges,
line charge, and surface charge density to exist at singular locations as sources of the
ﬁeld, then
∇2V = 0
(27)
which is Laplace’s equation. The ∇2 operation is called the Laplacian of V.
In rectangular coordinates Laplace’s equation is
∇2V = ∂2V
∂x2 + ∂2V
∂y2 + ∂2V
∂z2 = 0
(rectangular)
(28)
and the form of ∇2V in cylindrical and spherical coordinates may be obtained by using
the expressions for the divergence and gradient already obtained in those coordinate
systems. For reference, the Laplacian in cylindrical coordinates is

or conductors produces a ﬁeld for which ∇2V = 0. All these ﬁelds are different,
with different potential values and different spatial rates of change, yet for each
of them ∇2V = 0. Because every ﬁeld (if ρν = 0) satisﬁes Laplace’s equation,
how can we expect to reverse the procedure and use Laplace’s equation to ﬁnd one
speciﬁc ﬁeld in which we happen to have an interest? Obviously, more information is
required, and we shall ﬁnd that we must solve Laplace’s equation subject to certain
boundary conditions.
Every physical problem must contain at least one conducting boundary and usu-
ally contains two or more. The potentials on these boundaries are assigned values,
perhaps V0, V1, . . . , or perhaps numerical values. These deﬁnite equipotential sur-
faces will provide the boundary conditions for the type of problem to be solved. In
other types of problems, the boundary conditions take the form of speciﬁed values of
E (alternatively, a surface charge density, ρS) on an enclosing surface, or a mixture
of known values of V and E.

EXAMPLES OF THE SOLUTION
OF LAPLACE’S EQUATION
Several methods have been developed for solving Laplace’s equation. The simplest
method is that of direct integration. We will use this technique to work several exam-
ples involving one-dimensional potential variation in various coordinate systems in
this section.
The method of direct integration is applicable only to problems that are “one-
dimensional,” or in which the potential ﬁeld is a function of only one of the three
coordinates. Since we are working with only three coordinate systems, it might seem,
then, that there are nine problems to be solved, but a little reﬂection will show that
a ﬁeld that varies only with x is fundamentally the same as a ﬁeld that varies only
with y. Rotating the physical problem a quarter turn is no change. Actually, there are
only ﬁve problems to be solved, one in rectangular coordinates, two in cylindrical,
and two in spherical. We will solve them all.
First, let us assume that V is a function only of x and worry later about which
physical problem we are solving when we have a need for boundary conditions.
Laplace’s equation reduces to
∂2V
∂x2 = 0

CHAPTER 6
Capacitance
163
and the partial derivative may be replaced by an ordinary derivative, since V is not a
function of y or z,
d2V
dx2 = 0
We integrate twice, obtaining
dV
dx = A
and
V = Ax + B
(31)
where A and B are constants of integration. Equation (31) contains two such constants,
as we would expect for a second-order differential equation. These constants can be
determined only from the boundary conditions.
Since the ﬁeld varies only with x and is not a function of y and z, then V is a
constant if x is a constant or, in other words, the equipotential surfaces are parallel
planes normal to the x axis. The ﬁeld is thus that of a parallel-plate capacitor, and as
soon as we specify the potential on any two planes, we may evaluate our constants of
integration.
EXAMPLE 6.2
Start with the potential function, Eq. (31), and ﬁnd the capacitance of a parallel-plate
capacitor of plate area S, plate separation d, and potential difference V0 between
plates.
Solution. Take V = 0 at x = 0 and V = V0 at x = d. Then from Eq. (31),
A = V0
d
B = 0
and
V = V0x
d
(32)
We still need the total charge on either plate before the capacitance can be found.
We should remember that when we ﬁrst solved this capacitor problem, the sheet of
charge provided our starting point. We did not have to work very hard to ﬁnd the
charge, for all the ﬁelds were expressed in terms of it. The work then was spent in
ﬁnding potential difference. Now the problem is reversed (and simpliﬁed).
The necessary steps are these, after the choice of boundary conditions has been
made:
1.
Given V, use E = −∇V to ﬁnd E.
2.
Use D = ϵE to ﬁnd D.
3.
Evaluate D at either capacitor plate, D = DS = DNaN.
4.
Recognize that ρS = DN.
5.
Find Q by a surface integration over the capacitor plate, Q =

We will use this procedure several times in the examples to follow.
EXAMPLE 6.3
Because no new problems are solved by choosing ﬁelds which vary only with y or
with z in rectangular coordinates, we pass on to cylindrical coordinates for our next
example. Variations with respect to z are again nothing new, and we next assume
variation with respect to ρ only. Laplace’s equation becomes

Noting the ρ in the denominator, we exclude ρ = 0 from our solution and then
multiply by ρ and integrate,

where a total derivative replaces the partial derivative because V varies only with ρ.
Next, rearrange, and integrate again,
V = A ln ρ + B
(34)
The equipotential surfaces are given by ρ = constant and are cylinders, and the
problem is that of the coaxial capacitor or coaxial transmission line. We choose a

at the physical problem ﬁrst for a change and see that equipotential surfaces are given
by φ = constant. These are radial planes. Boundary conditions might be V = 0 at
φ = 0 and V = V0 at φ = α, leading to the physical problem detailed in Figure 6.10.

and it is interesting to note that E is a function of ρ and not of φ. This does not
contradict our original assumptions, which were restrictions only on the potential
ﬁeld. Note, however, that the vector ﬁeld E is in the φ direction.
A problem involving the capacitance of these two radial planes is included at the
end of the chapter.

We now turn to spherical coordinates, dispose immediately of variations with respect

This leads to an inﬁnite value of charge and capacitance, and it becomes necessary to

EXAMPLE OF THE SOLUTION
OF POISSON’S EQUATION: THE P-N
JUNCTION CAPACITANCE
To select a reasonably simple problem that might illustrate the application of Poisson’s
equation, we must assume that the volume charge density is speciﬁed. This is not
usually the case, however; in fact, it is often the quantity about which we are seeking
further information. The type of problem which we might encounter later would
begin with a knowledge only of the boundary values of the potential, the electric
ﬁeld intensity, and the current density. From these we would have to apply Poisson’s
equation, the continuity equation, and some relationship expressing the forces on
the charged particles, such as the Lorentz force equation or the diffusion equation,
and solve the whole system of equations simultaneously. Such an ordeal is beyond
the scope of this text, and we will therefore assume a reasonably large amount of
information.
As an example, let us select a pn junction between two halves of a semiconductor
bar extending in the x direction. We will assume that the region for x < 0 is doped p
type and that the region for x > 0 is n type. The degree of doping is identical on each
side of the junction. To review some of the facts about the semiconductor junction,
we note that initially there are excess holes to the left of the junction and excess
electrons to the right. Each diffuses across the junction until an electric ﬁeld is built
up in such a direction that the diffusion current drops to zero. Thus, to prevent more
holes from moving to the right, the electric ﬁeld in the neighborhood of the junction
must be directed to the left; Ex is negative there. This ﬁeld must be produced by a net
positive charge to the right of the junction and a net negative charge to the left. Note
that the layer of positive charge consists of two parts—the holes which have crossed
the junction and the positive donor ions from which the electrons have departed.
The negative layer of charge is constituted in the opposite manner by electrons and
negative acceptor ions.
The type of charge distribution that results is shown in Figure 6.12a, and the
negative ﬁeld which it produces is shown in Figure 6.12b. After looking at these two
ﬁgures, one might proﬁtably read the previous paragraph again.
A charge distribution of this form may be approximated by many different
expressions. One of the simpler expressions is
ρν = 2ρν0 sech x
a tanh x
a
(44)
which has a maximum charge density ρv,max = ρv0 that occurs at x = 0.881a. The
maximum charge density ρv0 is related to the acceptor and donor concentrations Na
and Nd by noting that all the donor and acceptor ions in this region (the depletion
layer) have been stripped of an electron or a hole, and thus
ρv0 = eNa = eNd
We now solve Poisson’s equation,
∇2V = −ρν

(48)

172
ENGINEERING ELECTROMAGNETICS
Because the total charge is a function of the potential difference, we have to be careful
in deﬁning a capacitance. Thinking in “circuit” terms for a moment,
I = dQ
dt = C dV0
dt
and thus
C = dQ
dV0
By differentiating Eq. (48), we therefore have the capacitance
C =
 ρν0ϵ
2πV0
S = ϵS
2πa
(49)
The ﬁrst form of Eq. (49) shows that the capacitance varies inversely as the square
root of the voltage. That is, a higher voltage causes a greater separation of the charge
layers and a smaller capacitance. The second form is interesting in that it indicates
that we may think of the junction as a parallel-plate capacitor with a “plate” separation
of 2πa. In view of the dimensions of the region in which the charge is concentrated,
this is a logical result.
Poisson’s equation enters into any problem involving volume charge density.
Besides semiconductor diode and transistor models, we ﬁnd that vacuum tubes, mag-
netohydrodynamic energy conversion, and ion propulsion require its use in construct-
ing satisfactory theories.

t this point, the concept of a ﬁeld should be a familiar one. Since we ﬁrst
accepted the experimental law of forces existing between two point charges
and deﬁned electric ﬁeld intensity as the force per unit charge on a test charge
in the presence of a second charge, we have discussed numerous ﬁelds. These ﬁelds
possess no real physical basis, for physical measurements must always be in terms
of the forces on the charges in the detection equipment. Those charges that are the
source cause measurable forces to be exerted on other charges, which we may think
of as detector charges. The fact that we attribute a ﬁeld to the source charges and then
determine the effect of this ﬁeld on the detector charges amounts merely to a division
of the basic problem into two parts for convenience.
We will begin our study of the magnetic ﬁeld with a deﬁnition of the magnetic
ﬁeld itself and show how it arises from a current distribution. The effect of this ﬁeld
on other currents, or the second half of the physical problem, will be discussed in
Chapter 8. As we did with the electric ﬁeld, we conﬁne our initial discussion to free-
space conditions, and the effect of material media will also be saved for discussion
in Chapter 8.
The relation of the steady magnetic ﬁeld to its source is more complicated than
is the relation of the electrostatic ﬁeld to its source. We will ﬁnd it necessary to
accept several laws temporarily on faith alone. The proof of the laws does exist and
is available on the Web site for the disbelievers or the more advanced student. ■

BIOT-SAVART LAW
The source of the steady magnetic ﬁeld may be a permanent magnet, an electric ﬁeld
changing linearly with time, or a direct current. We will largely ignore the permanent
magnet and save the time-varying electric ﬁeld for a later discussion. Our present study
will concern the magnetic ﬁeld produced by a differential dc element in free space.
We may think of this differential current element as a vanishingly small section of

case of a cylindrical conductor of circular cross section as the radius approaches zero.
We assume a current I ﬂowing in a differential vector length of the ﬁlament dL. The
law of Biot-Savart1 then states that at any point P the magnitude of the magnetic
ﬁeld intensity produced by the differential element is proportional to the product of
the current, the magnitude of the differential length, and the sine of the angle lying
between the ﬁlament and a line connecting the ﬁlament to the point P at which
the ﬁeld is desired; also, the magnitude of the magnetic ﬁeld intensity is inversely
proportional to the square of the distance from the differential element to the point P.
The direction of the magnetic ﬁeld intensity is normal to the plane containing the
differential ﬁlament and the line drawn from the ﬁlament to the point P. Of the two
possible normals, that one to be chosen is the one which is in the direction of progress
of a right-handed screw turned from dL through the smaller angle to the line from the
ﬁlament to P. Using rationalized mks units, the constant of proportionality is 1/4π.
The Biot-Savart law, just described in some 150 words, may be written concisely
using vector notation as
dH = IdL × aR

The units of the magnetic ﬁeld intensity H are evidently amperes per meter (A/m).
The geometry is illustrated in Figure 7.1. Subscripts may be used to indicate the point
to which each of the quantities in (1) refers. If we locate the current element at point 1
and describe the point P at which the ﬁeld is to be determined as point 2, then
dH2 = I1dL1 × aR12

1 Biot and Savart were colleagues of Amp`ere, and all three were professors of physics at the Coll`ege de
France at one time or another. The Biot-Savart law was proposed in 1820.

182
ENGINEERING ELECTROMAGNETICS
The law of Biot-Savart is sometimes called Amp`ere’s law for the current element,
but we will retain the former name because of possible confusion with Amp`ere’s
circuital law, to be discussed later.
In some aspects, the Biot-Savart law is reminiscent of Coulomb’s law when that
law is written for a differential element of charge,
dE2 = dQ1aR12
4πϵ0R2
12
Both show an inverse-square-law dependence on distance, and both show a linear
relationship between source and ﬁeld. The chief difference appears in the direction
of the ﬁeld.
It is impossible to check experimentally the law of Biot-Savart as expressed by (1)
or (2) because the differential current element cannot be isolated. We have restricted
our attention to direct currents only, so the charge density is not a function of time.
The continuity equation in Section 5.2, Eq. (5),
∇· J = −∂ρν

therefore shows that
∇· J = 0

Thetotalcurrentcrossinganyclosedsurfaceiszero,andthisconditionmaybesatisﬁed
only by assuming a current ﬂow around a closed path. It is this current ﬂowing in a
closed circuit that must be our experimental source, not the differential element.
It follows that only the integral form of the Biot-Savart law can be veriﬁed
experimentally,
H =

IdL × aR

(3)
Equation (1) or (2), of course, leads directly to the integral form (3), but other
differential expressions also yield the same integral formulation. Any term may be
added to (1) whose integral around a closed path is zero. That is, any conservative ﬁeld
could be added to (1). The gradient of any scalar ﬁeld always yields a conservative
ﬁeld, and we could therefore add a term ∇G to (1), where G is a general scalar ﬁeld,
without changing (3) in the slightest. This qualiﬁcation on (1) or (2) is mentioned
to show that if we later ask some foolish questions, not subject to any experimental
check, concerning the force exerted by one differential current element on another,
we should expect foolish answers.
The Biot-Savart law may also be expressed in terms of distributed sources, such
as current density J and surface current density K. Surface current ﬂows in a sheet of
vanishingly small thickness, and the current density J, measured in amperes per square

total current I in any width b is

where dN is a differential element of the path across which the current is ﬂowing.

may be expressed in terms of surface current density K or current density J,

We illustrate the application of the Biot-Savart law by considering an inﬁnitely
long straight ﬁlament. We apply (2) ﬁrst and then integrate. This, of course, is the
same as using the integral form (3) in the ﬁrst place.2
Referring to Figure 7.3, we should recognize the symmetry of this ﬁeld. No
variation with z or with φ can exist. Point 2, at which we will determine the ﬁeld,
is therefore chosen in the z = 0 plane. The ﬁeld point r is therefore r = ρaρ. The
source point r ′ is given by r′ = z′az, and therefore
R12 = r −r′ = ρaρ −z′az
so that

ﬁlament and inﬁnitely far removed. An outer coaxial conductor of inﬁnite radius is another theoretical
possibility. Practically, the problem is an impossible one, but we should realize that our answer will be
quite accurate near a very long, straight wire having a distant return path for the current.

At this point the unit vector aφ under the integral sign should be investigated, for it is
not always a constant, as are the unit vectors of the rectangular coordinate system. A
vector is constant when its magnitude and direction are both constant. The unit vector
certainly has constant magnitude, but its direction may change. Here aφ changes with
the coordinate φ but not with ρ or z. Fortunately, the integration here is with respect
to z′, and aφ is a constant and may be removed from under the integral sign,

The magnitude of the ﬁeld is not a function of φ or z, and it varies inversely with
the distance from the ﬁlament. The direction of the magnetic-ﬁeld-intensity vector is
circumferential. The streamlines are therefore circles about the ﬁlament, and the ﬁeld
may be mapped in cross section as in Figure 7.4.
The separation of the streamlines is proportional to the radius, or inversely pro-
portional to the magnitude of H. To be speciﬁc, the streamlines have been drawn with
curvilinear squares in mind. As yet, we have no name for the family of lines3 that
are perpendicular to these circular streamlines, but the spacing of the streamlines has

been adjusted so that the addition of this second set of lines will produce an array of
curvilinear squares.
A comparison of Figure 7.4 with the map of the electric ﬁeld about an inﬁnite
line charge shows that the streamlines of the magnetic ﬁeld correspond exactly to
the equipotentials of the electric ﬁeld, and the unnamed (and undrawn) perpendicular
family of lines in the magnetic ﬁeld corresponds to the streamlines of the electric
ﬁeld. This correspondence is not an accident, but there are several other concepts
which must be mastered before the analogy between electric and magnetic ﬁelds can
be explored more thoroughly.
Using the Biot-Savart law to ﬁnd H is in many respects similar to the use of
Coulomb’s law to ﬁnd E. Each requires the determination of a moderately complicated
integrand containing vector quantities, followed by an integration. When we were
concerned with Coulomb’s law we solved a number of examples, including the ﬁelds
of the point charge, line charge, and sheet of charge. The law of Biot-Savart can be
used to solve analogous problems in magnetic ﬁelds, and some of these problems
appear as exercises at the end of the chapter rather than as examples here.
One useful result is the ﬁeld of the ﬁnite-length current element, shown in
Figure 7.5. It turns out (see Problem 7.8 at the end of the chapter) that H is most
easily expressed in terms of the angles α1 and α2, as identiﬁed in the ﬁgure. The
result is
H =
I
4πρ (sin α2 −sin α1)aφ
(9)
If one or both ends are below point 2, then α1 is or both α1 and α2 are negative.

CHAPTER 7

Equation (9) may be used to ﬁnd the magnetic ﬁeld intensity caused by current
ﬁlaments arranged as a sequence of straight-line segments.
EXAMPLE 7.1
As a numerical example illustrating the use of (9), we determine H at P2(0.4, 0.3, 0)
in the ﬁeld of an 8. A ﬁlamentary current is directed inward from inﬁnity to the origin
on the positive x axis, and then outward to inﬁnity along the y axis. This arrangement
is shown in Figure 7.6.
Solution. We ﬁrst consider the semi-inﬁnite current on the x axis, identifying the
two angles, α1x = −90◦and α2x = tan−1(0.4/0.3) = 53.1◦. The radial distance ρ is
measured from the x axis, and we have ρx = 0.3. Thus, this contribution to H2 is
H2(x) =
8
4π(0.3)(sin 53.1◦+ 1)aφ =

0.3π (1.8)aφ = 12
π aφ
The unit vector aφ must also be referred to the x axis. We see that it becomes −az.
Therefore,
H2(x) = −12
π az A/m
For the current on the y axis, we have α1y = −tan−1(0.3/0.4) = −36.9◦, α2y = 90◦,
and ρy = 0.4. It follows that
H2(y) =

AMP `ERE’S CIRCUITAL LAW
After solving a number of simple electrostatic problems with Coulomb’s law, we
found that the same problems could be solved much more easily by using Gauss’s
law whenever a high degree of symmetry was present. Again, an analogous procedure
exists in magnetic ﬁelds. Here, the law that helps us solve problems more easily is
known as Amp`ere’s circuital4 law, sometimes called Amp`ere’s work law. This law
may be derived from the Biot-Savart law (see Section 7.7).
Amp`ere’s circuital law states that the line integral of H about any closed path is
exactly equal to the direct current enclosed by that path,

H · dL = I
(10)
We deﬁne positive current as ﬂowing in the direction of advance of a right-handed
screw turned in the direction in which the closed path is traversed.
Referring to Figure 7.7, which shows a circular wire carrying a direct current I,
the line integral of H about the closed paths lettered a and b results in an answer of
I; the integral about the closed path c which passes through the conductor gives an
answer less than I and is exactly that portion of the total current that is enclosed by
the path c. Although paths a and b give the same answer, the integrands are, of course,
different. The line integral directs us to multiply the component of H in the direction
of the path by a small increment of path length at one point of the path, move along
the path to the next incremental length, and repeat the process, continuing until the
path is completely traversed. Because H will generally vary from point to point, and
because paths a and b are not alike, the contributions to the integral made by, say,
4 The preferred pronunciation puts the accent on “circ-.”

CHAPTER 7

A conductor has a total current I. The line

I, and the integral around path c is less than I, since the
entire current is not enclosed by the path.
each micrometer of path length are quite different. Only the ﬁnal answers are the
same.
We should also consider exactly what is meant by the expression “current en-
closed by the path.” Suppose we solder a circuit together after passing the conductor
once through a rubber band, which we use to represent the closed path. Some strange
and formidable paths can be constructed by twisting and knotting the rubber band, but
if neither the rubber band nor the conducting circuit is broken, the current enclosed
by the path is that carried by the conductor. Now replace the rubber band by a circular
ring of spring steel across which is stretched a rubber sheet. The steel loop forms
the closed path, and the current-carrying conductor must pierce the rubber sheet if
the current is to be enclosed by the path. Again, we may twist the steel loop, and
we may also deform the rubber sheet by pushing our ﬁst into it or folding it in any
way we wish. A single current-carrying conductor still pierces the sheet once, and
this is the true measure of the current enclosed by the path. If we should thread the
conductor once through the sheet from front to back and once from back to front, the
total current enclosed by the path is the algebraic sum, which is zero.
In more general language, given a closed path, we recognize this path as the
perimeter of an inﬁnite number of surfaces (not closed surfaces). Any current-carrying
conductor enclosed by the path must pass through every one of these surfaces once.
Certainly some of the surfaces may be chosen in such a way that the conductor pierces
them twice in one direction and once in the other direction, but the algebraic total
current is still the same.
We will ﬁnd that the nature of the closed path is usually extremely simple and can
be drawn on a plane. The simplest surface is, then, that portion of the plane enclosed
by the path. We need merely ﬁnd the total current passing through this region of the
plane.
The application of Gauss’s law involves ﬁnding the total charge enclosed by a
closed surface; the application of Amp`ere’s circuital law involves ﬁnding the total
current enclosed by a closed path.

190
ENGINEERING ELECTROMAGNETICS
Let us again ﬁnd the magnetic ﬁeld intensity produced by an inﬁnitely long
ﬁlament carrying a current I. The ﬁlament lies on the z axis in free space (as in
Figure 7.3), and the current ﬂows in the direction given by az. Symmetry inspection
comes ﬁrst, showing that there is no variation with z or φ. Next we determine which
components of H are present by using the Biot-Savart law. Without speciﬁcally using
the cross product, we may say that the direction of dH is perpendicular to the plane
conaining dL and R and therefore is in the direction of aφ. Hence the only component
of H is Hφ, and it is a function only of ρ.
We therefore choose a path, to any section of which H is either perpendicular
or tangential, and along which H is constant. The ﬁrst requirement (perpendicularity
or tangency) allows us to replace the dot product of Amp`ere’s circuital law with the
product of the scalar magnitudes, except along that portion of the path where H is
normal to the path and the dot product is zero; the second requirement (constancy)
then permits us to remove the magnetic ﬁeld intensity from the integral sign. The
integration required is usually trivial and consists of ﬁnding the length of that portion
of the path to which H is parallel.
In our example, the path must be a circle of radius ρ, and Amp`ere’s circuital law
becomes

as before.
As a second example of the application of Amp`ere’s circuital law, consider an
inﬁnitely long coaxial transmission line carrying a uniformly distributed total current
I in the center conductor and −I in the outer conductor. The line is shown in Fig-
ure 7.8a. Symmetry shows that H is not a function of φ or z. In order to determine the
components present, we may use the results of the previous example by considering
the solid conductors as being composed of a large number of ﬁlaments. No ﬁlament
has a z component of H. Furthermore, the Hρ component at φ = 0◦, produced by one
ﬁlament located at ρ = ρ1, φ = φ1, is canceled by the Hρ component produced by a
symmetrically located ﬁlament at ρ = ρ1, φ = −φ1. This symmetry is illustrated by
Figure 7.8b. Again we ﬁnd only an Hφ component which varies with ρ.
A circular path of radius ρ, where ρ is larger than the radius of the inner conduc-
tor but less than the inner radius of the outer conductor, then leads immediately to
Hφ =
I
2πρ
(a < ρ < b)

produces Hρ components which cancel. For the total field, H = Hφaφ.

and

or

If the radius ρ is larger than the outer radius of the outer conductor, no current is
enclosed and

The magnetic-ﬁeld-strength variation with radius is shown in Figure 7.9 for
a coaxial cable in which b = 3a, c = 4a. It should be noted that the magnetic
ﬁeld intensity H is continuous at all the conductor boundaries. In other words, a
slight increase in the radius of the closed path does not result in the enclosure of a
tremendously different current. The value of Hφ shows no sudden jumps.

Figure 7.9
The magnetic field intensity as a function of
radius in an infinitely long coaxial transmission line with
the dimensions shown.
The external ﬁeld is zero. This, we see, results from equal positive and negative
currents enclosed by the path. Each produces an external ﬁeld of magnitude I/2πρ,
but complete cancellation occurs. This is another example of “shielding”; such a
coaxial cable carrying large currents would, in principle, not produce any noticeable
effect in an adjacent circuit.
As a ﬁnal example, let us consider a sheet of current ﬂowing in the positive y
direction and located in the z = 0 plane. We may think of the return current as equally
divided between two distant sheets on either side of the sheet we are considering. A
sheet of uniform surface current density K = Kyay is shown in Figure 7.10. H cannot
vary with x or y. If the sheet is subdivided into a number of ﬁlaments, it is evident
that no ﬁlament can produce an Hy component. Moreover, the Biot-Savart law shows
that the contributions to Hz produced by a symmetrically located pair of ﬁlaments
cancel. Thus, Hz is zero also; only an Hx component is present. We therefore choose
the path 1-1′-2′-2-1 composed of straight-line segments that are either parallel or
Figure 7.10

K = K yay in the z = 0 plane. H may be found by applying

perpendicular to Hx. Amp`ere’s circuital law gives
Hx1L + Hx2(−L) = KyL
or
Hx1 −Hx2 = Ky
If the path 3-3′-2′-2-3 is now chosen, the same current is enclosed, and
Hx3 −Hx2 = Ky
and therefore
Hx3 = Hx1
It follows that Hx is the same for all positive z. Similarly, Hx is the same for all
negative z. Because of the symmetry, then, the magnetic ﬁeld intensity on one side
of the current sheet is the negative of that on the other. Above the sheet,
Hx = 1
2 Ky
(z > 0)
while below it
Hx = −1
2 Ky
(z < 0)
Letting aN be a unit vector normal (outward) to the current sheet, the result may be
written in a form correct for all z as
H = 1
2K × aN
(11)
If a second sheet of current ﬂowing in the opposite direction, K = −Kyay, is
placed at z = h, (11) shows that the ﬁeld in the region between the current sheets is
H = K × aN
(0 < z < h)
(12)
and is zero elsewhere,
H = 0
(z < 0, z > h)
(13)
The most difﬁcult part of the application of Amp`ere’s circuital law is the deter-
mination of the components of the ﬁeld that are present. The surest method is the
logical application of the Biot-Savart law and a knowledge of the magnetic ﬁelds of

Problem 7.13 at the end of this chapter outlines the steps involved in applying
Amp`ere’s circuital law to an inﬁnitely long solenoid of radius a and uniform current
density Kaaφ, as shown in Figure 7.11a. For reference, the result is

If the solenoid has a ﬁnite length d and consists of N closely wound turns of a
ﬁlament that carries a current I (Figure 7.11b), then the ﬁeld at points well within the
solenoid is given closely by
H = N I

The approximation is useful it if is not applied closer than two radii to the open ends,
nor closer to the solenoid surface than twice the separation between turns.

Toroids having rectangular cross sections are also treated quite readily, as you
can see for yourself by trying Problem 7.14.

CURL
We completed our study of Gauss’s law by applying it to a differential volume element
and were led to the concept of divergence. We now apply Amp`ere’s circuital law to
the perimeter of a differential surface element and discuss the third and last of the
special derivatives of vector analysis, the curl. Our objective is to obtain the point
form of Amp`ere’s circuital law.
Again we choose rectangular coordinates, and an incremental closed path of sides
x and y is selected (Figure 7.13). We assume that some current, as yet unspeciﬁed,
produces a reference value for H at the center of this small rectangle,
H0 = Hx0ax + Hy0ay + Hz0az
The closed line integral of H about this path is then approximately the sum of the four
values of H · L on each side. We choose the direction of traverse as 1-2-3-4-1, which
corresponds to a current in the az direction, and the ﬁrst contribution is therefore
(H · L)1−2 = Hy,1−2y
The value of Hy on this section of the path may be given in terms of the reference
value Hy0 at the center of the rectangle, the rate of change of Hy with x, and the

By Amp`ere’s circuital law, this result must be equal to the current enclosed by the
path, or the current crossing any surface bounded by the path. If we assume a general
current density J, the enclosed current is then I

CHAPTER 7
The Steady Magnetic Field
197
After beginning with Amp`ere’s circuital law equating the closed line integral of
H to the current enclosed, we have now arrived at a relationship involving the closed
line integral of H per unit area enclosed and the current per unit area enclosed, or
current density. We performed a similar analysis in passing from the integral form of
Gauss’s law, involving ﬂux through a closed surface and charge enclosed, to the point
form, relating ﬂux through a closed surface per unit volume enclosed and charge per
unit volume enclosed, or volume charge density. In each case a limit is necessary to
produce an equality.
If we choose closed paths that are oriented perpendicularly to each of the re-
maining two coordinate axes, analogous processes lead to expressions for the x and
y components of the current density,
lim
y,z→0

and

H · dL

(20)
Comparing (18)–(20), we see that a component of the current density is given by
the limit of the quotient of the closed line integral of H about a small path in a plane
normal to that component and of the area enclosed as the path shrinks to zero. This
limit has its counterpart in other ﬁelds of science and long ago received the name of
curl. The curl of any vector is a vector, and any component of the curl is given by
the limit of the quotient of the closed line integral of the vector about a small path in
a plane normal to that component desired and the area enclosed, as the path shrinks
to zero. It should be noted that this deﬁnition of curl does not refer speciﬁcally to a
particular coordinate system. The mathematical form of the deﬁnition is
(curl H)N =
lim
SN →0

H · dL
SN
(21)
where SN is the planar area enclosed by the closed line integral. The N subscript
indicates that the component of the curl is that component which is normal to the
surface enclosed by the closed path. It may represent any component in any coordinate
system.
In rectangular coordinates, the deﬁnition (21) shows that the x, y, and z compo-
nents of the curl H are given by (18)–(20), and therefore

and may also be written in terms of the vector operator,

(24)
Equation (22) is the result of applying the deﬁnition (21) to the rectangular coordi-
nate system. We obtained the z component of this expression by evaluating Amp`ere’s
circuital law about an incremental path of sides x and y, and we could have ob-
tainedtheothertwocomponentsjustaseasilybychoosingtheappropriatepaths.Equa-
tion (23) is a neat method of storing the rectangular coordinate expression for curl; the
form is symmetrical and easily remembered. Equation (24) is even more concise and
leads to (22) upon applying the deﬁnitions of the cross product and vector operator.
The expressions for curl H in cylindrical and spherical coordinates are derived in
Appendix A by applying the deﬁnition (21). Although they may be written in determi-
nant form, as explained there, the determinants do not have one row of unit vectors on
top and one row of components on the bottom, and they are not easily memorized. For
this reason, the curl expansions in cylindrical and spherical coordinates that follow
here and appear inside the back cover are usually referred to whenever necessary.

Although we have described curl as a line integral per unit area, this does not
provideeveryonewithasatisfactoryphysicalpictureofthenatureofthecurloperation,
for the closed line integral itself requires physical interpretation. This integral was
ﬁrst met in the electrostatic ﬁeld, where we saw that

E · dL = 0. Inasmuch as the
integral was zero, we did not belabor the physical picture. More recently we have
discussed the closed line integral of H,

H · dL = I. Either of these closed line
integrals is also known by the name of circulation, a term borrowed from the ﬁeld of
ﬂuid dynamics.

The Steady Magnetic Field

Figure 7.14
(a) The curl meter shows a component of the curl of the water velocity
into the page. (b) The curl of the magnetic field intensity about an infinitely long filament
is shown.
The circulation of H, or

H · dL, is obtained by multiplying the component
of H parallel to the speciﬁed closed path at each point along it by the differential
path length and summing the results as the differential lengths approach zero and as
their number becomes inﬁnite. We do not require a vanishingly small path. Amp`ere’s
circuital law tells us that if H does possess circulation about a given path, then current
passes through this path. In electrostatics we see that the circulation of E is zero about
every path, a direct consequence of the fact that zero work is required to carry a charge
around a closed path.
We may describe curl as circulation per unit area. The closed path is vanishingly
small, and curl is deﬁned at a point. The curl of E must be zero, for the circulation
is zero. The curl of H is not zero, however; the circulation of H per unit area is the
current density by Amp`ere’s circuital law [or (18), (19), and (20)].
Skilling5 suggests the use of a very small paddle wheel as a “curl meter.” Our
vector quantity, then, must be thought of as capable of applying a force to each blade
of the paddle wheel, the force being proportional to the component of the ﬁeld normal
to the surface of that blade. To test a ﬁeld for curl, we dip our paddle wheel into the
ﬁeld, with the axis of the paddle wheel lined up with the direction of the component of
curl desired, and note the action of the ﬁeld on the paddle. No rotation means no curl;
larger angular velocities mean greater values of the curl; a reversal in the direction of
spin means a reversal in the sign of the curl. To ﬁnd the direction of the vector curl and
not merely to establish the presence of any particular component, we should place
our paddle wheel in the ﬁeld and hunt around for the orientation which produces the
greatest torque. The direction of the curl is then along the axis of the paddle wheel,
as given by the right-hand rule.
As an example, consider the ﬂow of water in a river. Figure 7.14a shows the
longitudinal section of a wide river taken at the middle of the river. The water velocity
is zero at the bottom and increases linearly as the surface is approached. A paddle
wheel placed in the position shown, with its axis perpendicular to the paper, will turn
in a clockwise direction, showing the presence of a component of curl in the direction
5 See the References at the end of the chapter.

of an inward normal to the surface of the page. If the velocity of water does not change
as we go up- or downstream and also shows no variation as we go across the river
(or even if it decreases in the same fashion toward either bank), then this component
is the only component present at the center of the stream, and the curl of the water
velocity has a direction into the page.
In Figure 7.14b, the streamlines of the magnetic ﬁeld intensity about an inﬁnitely
long ﬁlamentary conductor are shown. The curl meter placed in this ﬁeld of curved
lines shows that a larger number of blades have a clockwise force exerted on them
but that this force is in general smaller than the counterclockwise force exerted on
the smaller number of blades closer to the wire. It seems possible that if the curvature
of the streamlines is correct and also if the variation of the ﬁeld strength is just right,
the net torque on the paddle wheel may be zero. Actually, the paddle wheel does not
rotate in this case, for since H = (I/2πρ)aφ, we may substitute into (25) obtaining

EXAMPLE 7.2
As an example of the evaluation of curl H from the deﬁnition and of the evaluation of
another line integral, suppose that H = 0.2z2ax for z > 0, and H = 0 elsewhere, as
shown in Figure 7.15. Calculate

H · dL about a square path with side d, centered
at (0, 0, z1) in the y = 0 plane where z1 > d/2.

A square path of side d with its center on the
z axis at z = z1 is used to evaluate

The other components are zero, so ∇× H = 0.4z1ay.

a line integral, we simply take the partial derivative indicated by (23):

which checks with the preceding result when z = z1.

Amp`ere’s circuital law to a differential-sized path, we may combine (18)–(20), (22),

STOKES’ THEOREM
Although Section 7.3 was devoted primarily to a discussion of the curl operation,
the contribution to the subject of magnetic ﬁelds should not be overlooked. From
Amp`ere’s circuital law we derived one of Maxwell’s equations, ∇× H = J. This
latter equation should be considered the point form of Amp`ere’s circuital law and
applies on a “per-unit-area” basis. In this section we shall again devote a major share
of the material to the mathematical theorem known as Stokes’ theorem, but in the
process we will show that we may obtain Amp`ere’s circuital law from ∇× H = J.
In other words, we are then prepared to obtain the integral form from the point form
or to obtain the point form from the integral form.
Consider the surface S of Figure 7.16, which is broken up into incremental
surfaces of area S. If we apply the deﬁnition of the curl to one of these incremental
surfaces, then

H · dLS
S
.= (∇× H)N
where the N subscript again indicates the right-hand normal to the surface. The
subscript on dLS indicates that the closed path is the perimeter of an incremental
area S. This result may also be written

H · dLS
S
.= (∇× H) · aN
or

H · dLS .= (∇× H) · aNS = (∇× H) · S
where aN is a unit vector in the direction of the right-hand normal to S.
Now let us determine this circulation for every S comprising S and sum the re-
sults. As we evaluate the closed line integral for each S, some cancellation will occur

CHAPTER 7
The Steady Magnetic Field
203
Figure 7.16
The sum of the closed line integrals
about the perimeter of every S is the same as the
closed line integral about the perimeter of S because
of cancellation on every interior path.
because every interior wall is covered once in each direction. The only boundaries
on which cancellation cannot occur form the outside boundary, the path enclosing S.
Therefore we have

H · dL ≡

S
(∇× H) · dS
(30)
where dL is taken only on the perimeter of S.
Equation (30) is an identity, holding for any vector ﬁeld, and is known as Stokes’
theorem.
EXAMPLE 7.3
A numerical example may help to illustrate the geometry involved in Stokes’ theorem.
Consider the portion of a sphere shown in Figure 7.17. The surface is speciﬁed by r =
4, 0 ≤θ ≤0.1π, 0 ≤φ ≤0.3π, and the closed path forming its perimeter is com-
posed of three circular arcs. We are given the ﬁeld H = 6r sin φar +18r sin θ cos φaφ
and are asked to evaluate each side of Stokes’ theorem.
Solution. The ﬁrst path segment is described in spherical coordinates by r = 4, 0 ≤
θ ≤0.1π, φ = 0; the second one by r = 4, θ = 0.1π, 0 ≤φ ≤0.3π; and the third
by r = 4, 0 ≤θ ≤0.1π, φ = 0.3π. The differential path element dL is the vector
sum of the three differential lengths of the spherical coordinate system ﬁrst discussed
in Section 1.9,
dL = dr ar + r dθ aθ + r sin θ dφ aφ

204
ENGINEERING ELECTROMAGNETICS
Figure 7.17
A portion of a spherical cap is
used as a surface and a closed path to illustrate
Stokes’ theorem.
The ﬁrst term is zero on all three segments of the path since r = 4 and dr = 0,
the second is zero on segment 2 as θ is constant, and the third term is zero on both
segments 1 and 3. Thus,

CHAPTER 7

205
Thus, the results check Stokes’ theorem, and we note in passing that a current of
22.2 A is ﬂowing upward through this section of a spherical cap.
Next, let us see how easy it is to obtain Amp`ere’s circuital law from ∇× H = J.
We merely have to dot each side by dS, integrate each side over the same (open)
surface S, and apply Stokes’ theorem:

S
(∇× H) · dS =

S
J · dS =

H · dL
The integral of the current density over the surface S is the total current I passing
through the surface, and therefore

H · dL = I
This short derivation shows clearly that the current I, described as being “en-
closed by the closed path,” is also the current passing through any of the inﬁnite
number of surfaces that have the closed path as a perimeter.
Stokes’ theorem relates a surface integral to a closed line integral. It should
be recalled that the divergence theorem relates a volume integral to a closed surface
integral. Both theorems ﬁnd their greatest use in general vector proofs. As an example,
let us ﬁnd another expression for ∇· ∇× A, where A represents any vector ﬁeld. The
result must be a scalar (why?), and we may let this scalar be T , or
∇· ∇× A = T
Multiplying by dν and integrating throughout any volume ν,

vol
(∇· ∇× A) dν =

vol
T dν
we ﬁrst apply the divergence theorem to the left side, obtaining

S
(∇× A) · dS =

vol
T dν
The left side is the surface integral of the curl of A over the closed surface
surrounding the volume ν. Stokes’ theorem relates the surface integral of the curl of
A over the open surface enclosed by a given closed path. If we think of the path as
the opening of a laundry bag and the open surface as the surface of the bag itself, we
see that as we gradually approach a closed surface by pulling on the drawstrings, the
closed path becomes smaller and smaller and ﬁnally disappears as the surface becomes
closed. Hence, the application of Stokes’ theorem to a closed surface produces a zero
result, and we have

vol
T dν = 0

206
ENGINEERING ELECTROMAGNETICS
Because this is true for any volume, it is true for the differential volume dν,
T dν = 0
and therefore
T = 0
or
∇· ∇× A ≡0
(31)
Equation (31) is a useful identity of vector calculus.6 Of course, it may also be
proven easily by direct expansion in rectangular coordinates.
Let us apply the identity to the non-time-varying magnetic ﬁeld for which
∇× H = J
This shows quickly that
∇· J = 0
which is the same result we obtained earlier in the chapter by using the continuity
equation.
Before introducing several new magnetic ﬁeld quantities in the following section,
we may review our accomplishments at this point. We initially accepted the Biot-
Savart law as an experimental result,
H =

I dL × aR
4πR2
and tentatively accepted Amp`ere’s circuital law, subject to later proof,

H · dL = I
From Amp`ere’s circuital law the deﬁnition of curl led to the point form of this same
law,
∇× H = J
We now see that Stokes’ theorem enables us to obtain the integral form of Amp`ere’s
circuital law from the point form.

MAGNETIC FLUX AND MAGNETIC
FLUX DENSITY
In free space, let us deﬁne the magnetic ﬂux density B as
B = µ0H
(free space only)
(32)
where B is measured in webers per square meter (Wb/m2) or in a newer unit adopted
in the International System of Units, tesla (T). An older unit that is often used for
magnetic ﬂux density is the gauss (G), where 1 T or 1Wb/m2 is the same as 10, 000 G.
The constant µ0 is not dimensionless and has the deﬁned value for free space, in henrys
per meter (H/m), of
µ0 = 4π × 10−7 H/m
(33)
The name given to µ0 is the permeability of free space.
We should note that since H is measured in amperes per meter, the weber is
dimensionally equal to the product of henrys and amperes. Considering the henry as
a new unit, the weber is merely a convenient abbreviation for the product of henrys
and amperes. When time-varying ﬁelds are introduced, it will be shown that a weber
is also equivalent to the product of volts and seconds.
The magnetic-ﬂux-density vector B, as the name weber per square meter im-
plies, is a member of the ﬂux-density family of vector ﬁelds. One of the possible
analogies between electric and magnetic ﬁelds7 compares the laws of Biot-Savart and
Coulomb, thus establishing an analogy between H and E. The relations B = µ0H
and D = ϵ0E then lead to an analogy between B and D. If B is measured in teslas or
webers per square meter, then magnetic ﬂux should be measured in webers. Let us
represent magnetic ﬂux by 
 and deﬁne 
 as the ﬂux passing through any designated
area,

B · dS Wb
(34)
Our analogy should now remind us of the electric ﬂux , measured in coulombs,
and of Gauss’s law, which states that the total ﬂux passing through any closed surface
is equal to the charge enclosed,
 =

S
D · dS = Q
The charge Q is the source of the lines of electric ﬂux and these lines begin and
terminate on positive and negative charges, respectively.
7 An alternate analogy is presented in Section 9.2.

208
ENGINEERING ELECTROMAGNETICS
No such source has ever been discovered for the lines of magnetic ﬂux. In the
example of the inﬁnitely long straight ﬁlament carrying a direct current I, the H ﬁeld
formed concentric circles about the ﬁlament. Because B = µ0H, the B ﬁeld is of the
same form. The magnetic ﬂux lines are closed and do not terminate on a “magnetic
charge.” For this reason Gauss’s law for the magnetic ﬁeld is

S
B · dS = 0
(35)
and application of the divergence theorem shows us that
∇· B = 0
(36)
Equation (36) is the last of Maxwell’s four equations as they apply to static
electric ﬁelds and steady magnetic ﬁelds. Collecting these equations, we then have
for static electric ﬁelds and steady magnetic ﬁelds
∇· D = ρν
∇× E = 0
∇× H = J
∇· B = 0
(37)
To these equations we may add the two expressions relating D to E and B to H
in free space,
D = ϵ0E
(38)
B = µ0H
(39)
We have also found it helpful to deﬁne an electrostatic potential,
E = −∇V
(40)
and we will discuss a potential for the steady magnetic ﬁeld in the following section. In
addition, we extended our coverage of electric ﬁelds to include conducting materials
and dielectrics, and we introduced the polarization P. A similar treatment will be
applied to magnetic ﬁelds in the next chapter.
Returning to (37), it may be noted that these four equations specify the divergence
and curl of an electric and a magnetic ﬁeld. The corresponding set of four integral

Our study of electric and magnetic ﬁelds would have been much simpler if we
could have begun with either set of equations, (37) or (41). With a good knowledge
of vector analysis, such as we should now have, either set may be readily obtained
from the other by applying the divergence theorem or Stokes’ theorem. The various
experimental laws can be obtained easily from these equations.
As an example of the use of ﬂux and ﬂux density in magnetic ﬁelds, let us ﬁnd
the ﬂux between the conductors of the coaxial line of Figure 7.8a. The magnetic ﬁeld
intensity was found to be

THE SCALAR AND VECTOR
MAGNETIC POTENTIALS
The solution of electrostatic ﬁeld problems is greatly simpliﬁed by the use of the
scalar electrostatic potential V. Although this potential possesses a very real physical
signiﬁcance for us, it is mathematically no more than a stepping-stone which allows
us to solve a problem by several smaller steps. Given a charge conﬁguration, we may
ﬁrst ﬁnd the potential and then from it the electric ﬁeld intensity.
We should question whether or not such assistance is available in magnetic ﬁelds.
Can we deﬁne a potential function which may be found from the current distribution
and from which the magnetic ﬁelds may be easily determined? Can a scalar magnetic
potential be deﬁned, similar to the scalar electrostatic potential? We will show in
the next few pages that the answer to the ﬁrst question is yes, but the second must
be answered “sometimes.” Let us attack the second question ﬁrst by assuming the
existence of a scalar magnetic potential, which we designate Vm, whose negative
gradient gives the magnetic ﬁeld intensity
H = −∇Vm
The selection of the negative gradient provides a closer analogy to the electric potential
and to problems which we have already solved.
This deﬁnition must not conﬂict with our previous results for the magnetic ﬁeld,
and therefore
∇× H = J = ∇× (−∇Vm)
However, the curl of the gradient of any scalar is identically zero, a vector identity
the proof of which is left for a leisure moment. Therefore, we see that if H is to be
deﬁned as the gradient of a scalar magnetic potential, then current density must be
zero throughout the region in which the scalar magnetic potential is so deﬁned. We
then have
H = −∇Vm
(J = 0)
(43)
Because many magnetic problems involve geometries in which the current-carrying
conductors occupy a relatively small fraction of the total region of interest, it is evident
that a scalar magnetic potential can be useful. The scalar magnetic potential is also
applicable in the case of permanent magnets. The dimensions of Vm are obviously
amperes.
This scalar potential also satisﬁes Laplace’s equation. In free space,
∇· B = µ0∇· H = 0
and hence
µ0∇· (−∇Vm) = 0

CHAPTER 7
The Steady Magnetic Field
211
or
∇2Vm = 0
(J = 0)
(44)
We will see later that Vm continues to satisfy Laplace’s equation in homogeneous
magnetic materials; it is not deﬁned in any region in which current density is present.
Although we shall consider the scalar magnetic potential to a much greater extent
in Chapter 8, when we introduce magnetic materials and discuss the magnetic circuit,
one difference between V and Vm should be pointed out now: Vm is not a single-valued
function of position. The electric potential V is single-valued; once a zero reference is
assigned, there is only one value of V associated with each point in space. Such is not
the case with Vm. Consider the cross section of the coaxial line shown in Figure 7.18.
In the region a < ρ < b, J = 0, and we may establish a scalar magnetic potential.
The value of H is
H =
I
2πρ aφ
where I is the total current ﬂowing in the az direction in the inner conductor. We ﬁnd
Vm by integrating the appropriate component of the gradient. Applying (43),

Figure 7.18
The scalar magnetic potential Vm is a
multivalued function of φ in the region a < ρ < b. The
electrostatic potential is always single valued.

212
ENGINEERING ELECTROMAGNETICS
Thus,
Vm = −I
2π φ
where the constant of integration has been set equal to zero. What value of potential
do we associate with point P, where φ = π/4? If we let Vm be zero at φ = 0 and
proceed counterclockwise around the circle, the magnetic potential goes negative
linearly. When we have made one circuit, the potential is −I, but that was the point
at which we said the potential was zero a moment ago. At P, then, φ = π/4, 9π/4,
17π/4, . . . , or −7π/4, −15π/4, −23π/4, . . . , or

(n = 0, ±1, ±2, . . .)
The reason for this multivaluedness may be shown by a comparison with the
electrostatic case. There, we know that

E · dL = 0
and therefore the line integral
Vab = −

E · dL
is independent of the path. In the magnetostatic case, however,
∇× H = 0
(wherever J = 0)
but

H · dL = I
even if J is zero along the path of integration. Every time we make another complete
lap around the current, the result of the integration increases by I. If no current I
is enclosed by the path, then a single-valued potential function may be deﬁned. In
general, however,
Vm,ab = −

H · dL
(speciﬁed path)
(45)
where a speciﬁc path or type of path must be selected. We should remember that the
electrostatic potential V is a conservative ﬁeld; the magnetic scalar potential Vm is
not a conservative ﬁeld. In our coaxial problem, let us erect a barrier8 at φ = π; we

agree not to select a path that crosses this plane. Therefore, we cannot encircle I, and
a single-valued potential is possible. The result is seen to be

The scalar magnetic potential is evidently the quantity whose equipotential sur-
faces will form curvilinear squares with the streamlines of H in Figure 7.4. This is
one more facet of the analogy between electric and magnetic ﬁelds about which we
will have more to say in the next chapter.
Letustemporarilyleavethescalarmagneticpotentialnowandinvestigateavector
magnetic potential. This vector ﬁeld is one which is extremely useful in studying
radiation from antennas (as we will ﬁnd in Chapter 14) as well as radiation leakage
from transmission lines, waveguides, and microwave ovens. The vector magnetic
potential may be used in regions where the current density is zero or nonzero, and we
shall also be able to extend it to the time-varying case later.
Our choice of a vector magnetic potential is indicated by noting that
∇· B = 0
Next, a vector identity that we proved in Section 7.4 shows that the divergence of the
curl of any vector ﬁeld is zero. Therefore, we select
B = ∇× A
(46)
where A signiﬁes a vector magnetic potential, and we automatically satisfy the con-
dition that the magnetic ﬂux density shall have zero divergence. The H ﬁeld is
H = 1
µ0
∇× A
and
∇× H = J = 1
µ0
∇× ∇× A
The curl of the curl of a vector ﬁeld is not zero and is given by a fairly complicated
expression,9 which we need not know now in general form. In speciﬁc cases for which
the form of A is known, the curl operation may be applied twice to determine the
current density.
9 ∇× ∇× A ≡∇(∇· A) −∇2A. In rectangular coordinates, it may be shown that ∇2A ≡∇2Axax +
∇2Ayay + ∇2Azaz. In other coordinate systems, ∇2A may be found by evaluating the second-order
partial derivatives in ∇2A = ∇(∇· A) −∇× ∇× A.

214
ENGINEERING ELECTROMAGNETICS
Equation (46) serves as a useful deﬁnition of the vector magnetic potential A.
Because the curl operation implies differentiation with respect to a length, the units
of A are webers per meter.
As yet we have seen only that the deﬁnition for A does not conﬂict with any
previous results. It still remains to show that this particular deﬁnition can help us to
determine magnetic ﬁelds more easily. We certainly cannot identify A with any easily
measured quantity or history-making experiment.
We will show in Section 7.7 that, given the Biot-Savart law, the deﬁnition of B,
and the deﬁnition of A, A may be determined from the differential current elements by
A =
 µ0I dL
4πR
(47)
The signiﬁcance of the terms in (47) is the same as in the Biot-Savart law; a direct
current I ﬂows along a ﬁlamentary conductor of which any differential length dL is
distant R from the point at which A is to be found. Because we have deﬁned A only
through speciﬁcation of its curl, it is possible to add the gradient of any scalar ﬁeld
to (47) without changing B or H, for the curl of the gradient is identically zero. In
steady magnetic ﬁelds, it is customary to set this possible added term equal to zero.
The fact that A is a vector magnetic potential is more apparent when (47) is
compared with the similar expression for the electrostatic potential,
V =

ρLdL
4πϵ0R
Each expression is the integral along a line source, in one case line charge and in the
other case line current; each integrand is inversely proportional to the distance from
the source to the point of interest; and each involves a characteristic of the medium
(here free space), the permeability or the permittivity.
Equation (47) may be written in differential form,
dA = µ0I dL
4π R
(48)
if we again agree not to attribute any physical signiﬁcance to any magnetic ﬁelds we
obtain from (48) until the entire closed path in which the current ﬂows is considered.
With this reservation, let us go right ahead and consider the vector magnetic
potential ﬁeld about a differential ﬁlament. We locate the ﬁlament at the origin in free
space, as shown in Figure 7.19, and allow it to extend in the positive z direction so
that dL = dz az. We use cylindrical coordinates to ﬁnd dA at the point (ρ, φ, z):

We note that the direction of dA is the same as that of I dL. Each small section
of a current-carrying conductor produces a contribution to the total vector magnetic
potential which is in the same direction as the current ﬂow in the conductor. The
magnitude of the vector magnetic potential varies inversely with the distance to the
current element, being strongest in the neighborhood of the current and gradually
falling off to zero at distant points. Skilling10 describes the vector magnetic potential
ﬁeld as “like the current distribution but fuzzy around the edges, or like a picture of
the current out of focus.”
In order to ﬁnd the magnetic ﬁeld intensity, we must take the curl of (49) in
cylindrical coordinates, leading to

which is easily shown to be the same as the value given by the Biot-Savart law.
Expressions for the vector magnetic potential A can also be obtained for a current
source which is distributed. For a current sheet K, the differential current element
becomes
I dL = K dS
In the case of current ﬂow throughout a volume with a density J, we have
I dL = J dν
10 See the References at the end of the chapter.

216
ENGINEERING ELECTROMAGNETICS
In each of these two expressions the vector character is given to the current. For the
ﬁlamentary element it is customary, although not necessary, to use I dL instead of
I dL. Since the magnitude of the ﬁlamentary element is constant, we have chosen
the form which allows us to remove one quantity from the integral. The alternative
expressions for A are then

Equations (47), (50), and (51) express the vector magnetic potential as an inte-
gration over all of its sources. From a comparison of the form of these integrals with
those which yield the electrostatic potential, it is evident that once again the zero ref-
erence for A is at inﬁnity, for no ﬁnite current element can produce any contribution
as R →∞. We should remember that we very seldom used the similar expressions
for V ; too often our theoretical problems included charge distributions that extended
to inﬁnity, and the result would be an inﬁnite potential everywhere. Actually, we cal-
culated very few potential ﬁelds until the differential form of the potential equation
was obtained, ∇2V = −ρν/ϵ, or better yet, ∇2V = 0. We were then at liberty to
select our own zero reference.
The analogous expressions for A will be derived in the next section, and an
example of the calculation of a vector magnetic potential ﬁeld will be completed.

should add subscripts to indicate the point at which the current element is located
(x1, y1, z1) and the point at which A is given (x2, y2, z2). The differential volume
element dν is then written dν1 and in rectangular coordinates would be dx1 dy1 dz1.
The variables of integration are x1, y1, and z1. Using these subscripts, then,

To show that (3) follows from (52), it is necessary to substitute (52) into (53). This
step involves taking the curl of A2, a quantity expressed in terms of the variables x2,
y2, and z2, and the curl therefore involves partial derivatives with respect to x2, y2, and
z2. We do this, placing a subscript on the del operator to remind us of the variables

the ﬁrst set of variables is not a function of the second set, and all partial derivatives

outside this volume (otherwise we should have had to increase the volume to include
it), we may integrate over a slightly larger volume or a slightly larger enclosing surface
without changing A. On this larger surface the current density J1 must be zero, and
therefore the closed surface integral is zero, since the integrand is zero. Hence the
divergence of A is zero.

some additional information about the electrostatic potential which we shall not have
to repeat now for the x component of the vector magnetic potential. This takes the
form of Poisson’s equation,

We have already shown the use of Stokes’ theorem in obtaining the integral form of
Amp`ere’s circuital law from (28) and need not repeat that labor here.

We thus have succeeded in showing that every result we have essentially pulled
from thin air11 for magnetic ﬁelds follows from the basic deﬁnitions of H, B, and A.
The derivations are not simple, but they should be understandable on a step-by-step
basis.
Finally, let us return to (64) and make use of this formidable second-order vec-
tor partial differential equation to ﬁnd the vector magnetic potential in one simple
example. We select the ﬁeld between conductors of a coaxial cable, with radii of a
and b as usual, and current I in the az direction in the inner conductor. Between the
conductors, J = 0, and therefore
∇2A = 0
We have already been told (and Problem 7.44 gives us the opportunity to check the
results for ourselves) that the vector Laplacian may be expanded as the vector sum of
the scalar Laplacians of the three components in rectangular coordinates,
∇2A = ∇2Axax + ∇2Ayay + ∇2Azaz
but such a relatively simple result is not possible in other coordinate systems. That is,
in cylindrical coordinates, for example,
∇2A ̸= ∇2Aρaρ + ∇2Aφaφ + ∇2Azaz
However, it is not difﬁcult to show for cylindrical coordinates that the z component
of the vector Laplacian is the scalar Laplacian of the z component of A, or
∇2A

z = ∇2Az
(65)
and because the current is entirely in the z direction in this problem, A has only a
z component. Therefore,

of |A| with distance from the concentrated current source that the inner conductor
represents is evident. The results of Problem D7.9 have also been added to Figure 7.20.
The extension of the curve into the outer conductor is left as Problem 7.43.
It is also possible to ﬁnd Az between conductors by applying a process some of
us informally call “uncurling.” That is, we know H or B for the coax, and we may

ductor of circular cross section carrying a current I in the az direction in free
space. The zero reference is arbitrarily set at ρ = b. Now consider two con-
ductors, each of 1 cm radius, parallel to the z axis with their axes lying in
the x = 0 plane. One conductor whose axis is at (0, 4 cm, z) carries 12 A
in the az direction; the other axis is at (0, −4 cm, z) and carries 12 A in the
−az direction. Each current has its zero reference for A located 4 cm from its
axis. Find the total A ﬁeld at: (a) (0, 0, z); (b) (0, 8 cm, z); (c) (4 cm, 4 cm, z);

Magnetic Forces,

e are now ready to undertake the second half of the magnetic ﬁeld problem,
that of determining the forces and torques exerted by the magnetic ﬁeld on
other charges. The electric ﬁeld causes a force to be exerted on a charge
that may be either stationary or in motion; we will see that the steady magnetic ﬁeld is
capable of exerting a force only on a moving charge. This result appears reasonable; a
magnetic ﬁeld may be produced by moving charges and may exert forces on moving
charges; a magnetic ﬁeld cannot arise from stationary charges and cannot exert any
force on a stationary charge.
This chapter initially considers the forces and torques on current-carrying con-
ductors that may either be of a ﬁlamentary nature or possess a ﬁnite cross section
with a known current density distribution. The problems associated with the motion
of particles in a vacuum are largely avoided.
With an understanding of the fundamental effects produced by the magnetic
ﬁeld, we may then consider the varied types of magnetic materials, the analysis
of elementary magnetic circuits, the forces on magnetic materials, and ﬁnally, the
important electrical circuit concepts of self-inductance and mutual inductance. ■
8.1
FORCE ON A MOVING CHARGE
In an electric ﬁeld, the deﬁnition of the electric ﬁeld intensity shows us that the force
on a charged particle is
F = QE
(1)
230

CHAPTER 8
Magnetic Forces, Materials, and Inductance
231
The force is in the same direction as the electric ﬁeld intensity (for a positive charge)
and is directly proportional to both E and Q. If the charge is in motion, the force at
any point in its trajectory is then given by (1).
A charged particle in motion in a magnetic ﬁeld of ﬂux density B is found
experimentally to experience a force whose magnitude is proportional to the product
of the magnitudes of the charge Q, its velocity v, and the ﬂux density B, and to the sine
of the angle between the vectors v and B. The direction of the force is perpendicular
to both v and B and is given by a unit vector in the direction of v × B. The force may
therefore be expressed as
F = Qv × B
(2)
A fundamental difference in the effect of the electric and magnetic ﬁelds on
charged particles is now apparent, for a force which is always applied in a direc-
tion at right angles to the direction in which the particle is proceeding can never
change the magnitude of the particle velocity. In other words, the acceleration vector
is always normal to the velocity vector. The kinetic energy of the particle remains
unchanged, and it follows that the steady magnetic ﬁeld is incapable of transfer-
ring energy to the moving charge. The electric ﬁeld, on the other hand, exerts a
force on the particle which is independent of the direction in which the particle is
progressing and therefore effects an energy transfer between ﬁeld and particle in
general.
The ﬁrst two problems at the end of this chapter illustrate the different effects of
electric and magnetic ﬁelds on the kinetic energy of a charged particle moving in free
space.
The force on a moving particle arising from combined electric and magnetic
ﬁelds is obtained easily by superposition,
F = Q(E + v × B)
(3)
This equation is known as the Lorentz force equation, and its solution is required in
determining electron orbits in the magnetron, proton paths in the cyclotron, plasma
characteristics in a magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) generator, or, in general, charged-
particle motion in combined electric and magnetic ﬁelds.

8.2
FORCE ON A DIFFERENTIAL
CURRENT ELEMENT
The force on a charged particle moving through a steady magnetic ﬁeld may be written
as the differential force exerted on a differential element of charge,
dF = dQ v × B
(4)
Physically, the differential element of charge consists of a large number of very
small, discrete charges occupying a volume which, although small, is much larger
than the average separation between the charges. The differential force expressed
by (4) is thus merely the sum of the forces on the individual charges. This sum, or
resultant force, is not a force applied to a single object. In an analogous way, we might
consider the differential gravitational force experienced by a small volume taken in
a shower of falling sand. The small volume contains a large number of sand grains,
and the differential force is the sum of the forces on the individual grains within the
small volume.
If our charges are electrons in motion in a conductor, however, we can show
that the force is transferred to the conductor and that the sum of this extremely large
number of extremely small forces is of practical importance. Within the conductor,
electrons are in motion throughout a region of immobile positive ions which form
a crystalline array, giving the conductor its solid properties. A magnetic ﬁeld which
exertsforcesontheelectronstendstocausethemtoshiftpositionslightlyandproduces
a small displacement between the centers of “gravity” of the positive and negative
charges. The Coulomb forces between electrons and positive ions, however, tend to
resist such a displacement. Any attempt to move the electrons, therefore, results in
an attractive force between electrons and the positive ions of the crystalline lattice.
The magnetic force is thus transferred to the crystalline lattice, or to the conductor
itself. The Coulomb forces are so much greater than the magnetic forces in good
conductors that the actual displacement of the electrons is almost immeasurable. The
charge separation that does result, however, is disclosed by the presence of a slight
potential difference across the conductor sample in a direction perpendicular to both
the magnetic ﬁeld and the velocity of the charges. The voltage is known as the Hall
voltage, and the effect itself is called the Hall effect.
Figure 8.1 illustrates the direction of the Hall voltage for both positive and neg-
ative charges in motion. In Figure 8.1a, v is in the −ax direction, v × B is in the ay
direction, and Q is positive, causing FQ to be in the ay direction; thus, the positive
charges move to the right. In Figure 8.1b, v is now in the +ax direction, B is still in
the az direction, v × B is in the −ay direction, and Q is negative; thus, FQ is again in
the ay direction. Hence, the negative charges end up at the right edge. Equal currents
provided by holes and electrons in semiconductors can therefore be differentiated by

is n-type or p-type.
Devices employ the Hall effect to measure the magnetic ﬂux density and, in some
applications where the current through the device can be made proportional to the

magnetic ﬁeld across it, to serve as electronic wattmeters, squaring elements, and so
forth.
Returning to (4), we may therefore say that if we are considering an element
of moving charge in an electron beam, the force is merely the sum of the forces on
the individual electrons in that small volume element, but if we are considering an
element of moving charge within a conductor, the total force is applied to the solid
conductor itself. We will now limit our attention to the forces on current-carrying
conductors.
In Chapter 5 we deﬁned convection current density in terms of the velocity of
the volume charge density,
J = ρνv
The differential element of charge in (4) may also be expressed in terms of volume
charge density,1
dQ = ρνdν
Thus
dF = ρνdν v × B
or
dF = J × B dν
(5)
We saw in Chapter 7 that J dν may be interpreted as a differential current element;
that is,
J dν = K dS = I dL
1Remember that dν is a differential volume element and not a differential increase in velocity.

and thus the Lorentz force equation may be applied to surface current density,
dF = K × B dS
(6)
or to a differential current ﬁlament,
dF = I dL × B

Integrating (5), (6), or (7) over a volume, a surface which may be either open or
closed (why?), or a closed path, respectively, leads to the integral formulations

One simple result is obtained by applying (7) or (10) to a straight conductor in a
uniform magnetic ﬁeld,
F = IL × B
(11)
The magnitude of the force is given by the familiar equation
F = BIL sin θ
(12)
where θ is the angle between the vectors representing the direction of the current ﬂow
and the direction of the magnetic ﬂux density. Equation (11) or (12) applies only to
a portion of the closed circuit, and the remainder of the circuit must be considered in
any practical problem.

As a numerical example of these equations, consider Figure 8.2. We have a square
loop of wire in the z = 0 plane carrying 2 mA in the ﬁeld of an inﬁnite ﬁlament on

FORCE BETWEEN DIFFERENTIAL
CURRENT ELEMENTS
The concept of the magnetic ﬁeld was introduced to break into two parts the problem
of ﬁnding the interaction of one current distribution on a second current distribution.
It is possible to express the force on one current element directly in terms of a
second current element without ﬁnding the magnetic ﬁeld. Because we claimed that
the magnetic-ﬁeld concept simpliﬁes our work, it then behooves us to show that
avoidance of this intermediate step leads to more complicated expressions.
The magnetic ﬁeld at point 2 due to a current element at point 1 was found to be
dH2 = I1dL1 × aR12
4πR2
12
Now, the differential force on a differential current element is
dF = I dL × B
and we apply this to our problem by letting B be dB2 (the differential ﬂux density at
point2causedbycurrentelement1),byidentifying I dLas I2dL2,andbysymbolizing
the differential amount of our differential force on element 2 as d(dF2):
d(dF2) = I2dL2 × dB2
Because dB2 = µ0dH2, we obtain the force between two differential current
elements,
d(dF2) = µ0

As an example that illustrates the use (and misuse) of these results, consider the
two differential current elements shown in Figure 8.3. We seek the differential force
on dL2.

Given P1(5, 2, 1), P2(1, 8, 5),
I 1 dL1 = −3ay A · m, and I 2 dL2 = −4az A · m,
the force on I 2 dL2 is 8.56 nN in the ay direction.
Solution. We have I1dL1 = −3ayA · m at P1(5, 2, 1), and I2dL2 = −4azA · m at
P2(1, 8, 5). Thus, R12 = −4ax +6ay+4az, and we may substitute these data into (13),

Many chapters ago, when we discussed the force exerted by one point charge on
another point charge, we found that the force on the ﬁrst charge was the negative of
that on the second. That is, the total force on the system was zero. This is not the case
with the differential current elements, and d(dF1) = −12.84az nN in Example 8.2.
The reason for this different behavior lies with the nonphysical nature of the current
element. Whereas point charges may be approximated quite well by small charges,
the continuity of current demands that a complete circuit be considered. This we shall
now do.
The total force between two ﬁlamentary circuits is obtained by integrating twice:

Equation (14) is quite formidable, but the familiarity gained in Chapter 7 with
the magnetic ﬁeld should enable us to recognize the inner integral as the integral
necessary to ﬁnd the magnetic ﬁeld at point 2 due to the current element at point 1.
Although we shall only give the result, it is not very difﬁcult to use (14) to
ﬁnd the force of repulsion between two inﬁnitely long, straight, parallel, ﬁlamentary

conductors with separation d, and carrying equal but opposite currents I, as shown
in Figure 8.4. The integrations are simple, and most errors are made in determining
suitable expressions for aR12, dL1, and dL2. However, since the magnetic ﬁeld in-
tensity at either wire caused by the other is already known to be I/(2πd), it is readily
apparent that the answer is a force of µ0I 2/(2πd) newtons per meter length.

FORCE AND TORQUE
ON A CLOSED CIRCUIT
We have already obtained general expressions for the forces exerted on current sys-
tems. One special case is easily disposed of, for if we take our relationship for the
force on a ﬁlamentary closed circuit, as given by Eq. (10), Section 8.2,
F = −I

B × dL
and assume a uniform magnetic ﬂux density, then B may be removed from the integral:
F = −IB ×

dL
However, we discovered during our investigation of closed line integrals in an elec-
trostatic potential ﬁeld that

dL = 0, and therefore the force on a closed ﬁlamentary
circuit in a uniform magnetic ﬁeld is zero.
If the ﬁeld is not uniform, the total force need not be zero.

CHAPTER 8
Magnetic Forces, Materials, and Inductance
239
Figure 8.5
(a) Given a lever arm R extending from an origin O to a point P where
force F is applied, the torque about O is T = R × F. (b) If F2 = −F1, then the torque
T = R21 × F1 is independent of the choice of origin for R1 and R2.
This result for uniform ﬁelds does not have to be restricted to ﬁlamentary circuits
only. The circuit may contain surface currents or volume current density as well. If
the total current is divided into ﬁlaments, the force on each one is zero, as we have
shown, and the total force is again zero. Therefore, any real closed circuit carrying
direct currents experiences a total vector force of zero in a uniform magnetic ﬁeld.
Although the force is zero, the torque is generally not equal to zero.
In deﬁning the torque, or moment, of a force, it is necessary to consider both an
origin at or about which the torque is to be calculated, and the point at which the
force is applied. In Figure 8.5a, we apply a force F at point P, and we establish an
origin at O with a rigid lever arm R extending from O to P. The torque about point
O is a vector whose magnitude is the product of the magnitudes of R, of F, and of
the sine of the angle between these two vectors. The direction of the vector torque T
is normal to both the force F and the lever arm R and is in the direction of progress
of a right-handed screw as the lever arm is rotated into the force vector through the
smaller angle. The torque is expressible as a cross product,
T = R × F
Now assume that two forces, F1 at P1 and F2 at P2, having lever arms R1 and
R2 extending from a common origin O, as shown in Figure 8.5b, are applied to an
object of ﬁxed shape and that the object does not undergo any translation. Then the
torque about the origin is
T = R1 × F1 + R2 × F2
where
F1 + F2 = 0

240
ENGINEERING ELECTROMAGNETICS
and therefore
T = (R1 −R2) × F1 = R21 × F1
The vector R21 = R1 −R2 joins the point of application of F2 to that of F1 and is
independent of the choice of origin for the two vectors R1 and R2. Therefore, the
torque is also independent of the choice of origin, provided that the total force is zero.
This may be extended to any number of forces.
Consider the application of a vertically upward force at the end of a horizontal
crank handle on an elderly automobile. This cannot be the only applied force, for if it
were, the entire handle would be accelerated in an upward direction. A second force,
equal in magnitude to that exerted at the end of the handle, is applied in a downward
direction by the bearing surface at the axis of rotation. For a 40-N force on a crank
handle 0.3 m in length, the torque is 12 N · m. This ﬁgure is obtained regardless of
whether the origin is considered to be on the axis of rotation (leading to 12 N · m plus
0 N · m), at the midpoint of the handle (leading to 6 N · m plus 6 N · m), or at some
point not even on the handle or an extension of the handle.
We may therefore choose the most convenient origin, and this is usually on the
axis of rotation and in the plane containing the applied forces if the several forces
are coplanar.
With this introduction to the concept of torque, let us now consider the torque
on a differential current loop in a magnetic ﬁeld B. The loop lies in the xy plane
(Figure 8.6); the sides of the loop are parallel to the x and y axes and are of length
dx and dy. The value of the magnetic ﬁeld at the center of the loop is taken as B0.
Figure 8.6
A differential current loop in a magnetic field B.
The torque on the loop is d T = I (dx dyaz) × B0 = I dS × B.

CHAPTER 8
Magnetic Forces, Materials, and Inductance
241
Since the loop is of differential size, the value of B at all points on the loop may be
taken as B0. (Why was this not possible in the discussion of curl and divergence?)
The total force on the loop is therefore zero, and we are free to choose the origin for
the torque at the center of the loop.
The vector force on side 1 is
dF1 = I dx ax × B0
or
dF1 = I dx(B0yaz −B0zay)
For this side of the loop the lever arm R extends from the origin to the midpoint
of the side, R1 = −1
2dy ay, and the contribution to the total torque is
dT1 = R1 × dF1
= −1
2dy ay × I dx(B0yaz −B0zay)
= −1
2dx dy I B0yax
The torque contribution on side 3 is found to be the same,
dT3 = R3 × dF3 = 1
2dy ay × (−I dx ax × B0)
= −1
2dx dy IB0yax = dT1
and
dT1 + dT3 = −dx dy IB0yax
Evaluating the torque on sides 2 and 4, we ﬁnd
dT2 + dT4 = dx dy IB0xay
and the total torque is then
dT = I dx dy(B0xay −B0yax)
The quantity within the parentheses may be represented by a cross product,
dT = I dx dy(az × B0)
or
dT = I dS × B
(15)
where dS is the vector area of the differential current loop and the subscript on B0
has been dropped.
We now deﬁne the product of the loop current and the vector area of the loop as
the differential magnetic dipole moment dm, with units of A · m2. Thus
dm = I dS
(16)

242
ENGINEERING ELECTROMAGNETICS
and
dT = dm × B
(17)
If we extend the results we obtained in Section 4.7 for the differential electric
dipole by determining the torque produced on it by an electric ﬁeld, we see a similar
result,
dT = dp × E
Equations (15) and (17) are general results that hold for differential loops of any
shape, not just rectangular ones. The torque on a circular or triangular loop is also
given in terms of the vector surface or the moment by (15) or (17).
Because we selected a differential current loop so that we might assume B was
constant throughout it, it follows that the torque on a planar loop of any size or shape
in a uniform magnetic ﬁeld is given by the same expression,
T = IS × B = m × B
(18)
We should note that the torque on the current loop always tends to turn the loop
so as to align the magnetic ﬁeld produced by the loop with the applied magnetic ﬁeld
that is causing the torque. This is perhaps the easiest way to determine the direction
of the torque.
EXAMPLE 8.3
To illustrate some force and torque calculations, consider the rectangular loop shown
in Figure 8.7. Calculate the torque by using T = IS × B.
Solution. The loop has dimensions of 1 m by 2 m and lies in the uniform ﬁeld
B0 = −0.6ay + 0.8azT. The loop current is 4 mA, a value that is sufﬁciently small to
avoid causing any magnetic ﬁeld that might affect B0.
We have
T = 4 × 10−3[(1)(2)az] × (−0.6ay + 0.8az) = 4.8ax mN · m
Thus, the loop tends to rotate about an axis parallel to the positive x axis. The small
magnetic ﬁeld produced by the 4 mA loop current tends to line up with B0.
EXAMPLE 8.4
Now let us ﬁnd the torque once more, this time by calculating the total force and
torque contribution for each side.
Solution. On side 1 we have
F1 = IL1 × B0 = 4 × 10−3(1ax) × (−0.6ay + 0.8az)
= −3.2ay −2.4az mN

CHAPTER 8
Magnetic Forces, Materials, and Inductance
243
Figure 8.7
A rectangular loop is located in a uniform
magnetic flux density B0.
On side 3 we obtain the negative of this result,
F3 = 3.2ay + 2.4az mN
Next, we attack side 2:
F2 = IL2 × B0 = 4 × 10−3(2ay) × (−0.6ay + 0.8az)
= 6.4ax mN
with side 4 again providing the negative of this result,
F4 = −6.4ax mN
Because these forces are distributed uniformly along each of the sides, we treat
each force as if it were applied at the center of the side. The origin for the torque may
be established anywhere since the sum of the forces is zero, and we choose the center
of the loop. Thus,
T = T1 + T2 + T3 + T4 = R1 × F1 + R2 × F2 + R3 × F3 + R4 × F4
= (−1ay) × (−3.2ay −2.4az) + (0.5ax) × (6.4ax)
+ (1ay) × (3.2ay + 2.4az) + (−0.5ax) × (−6.4ax)
= 2.4ax + 2.4ax = 4.8ax mN · m
Crossing the loop moment with the magnetic ﬂux density is certainly easier.

THE NATURE OF MAGNETIC MATERIALS
We are now in a position to combine our knowledge of the action of a magnetic ﬁeld
on a current loop with a simple model of an atom and obtain some appreciation of
the difference in behavior of various types of materials in magnetic ﬁelds.
Although accurate quantitative results can only be predicted through the use
of quantum theory, the simple atomic model, which assumes that there is a central
positive nucleus surrounded by electrons in various circular orbits, yields reasonable
quantitative results and provides a satisfactory qualitative theory. An electron in an
orbit is analogous to a small current loop (in which the current is directed oppositely
to the direction of electron travel) and, as such, experiences a torque in an external
magnetic ﬁeld, the torque tending to align the magnetic ﬁeld produced by the orbiting
electron with the external magnetic ﬁeld. If there were no other magnetic moments to
consider, we would then conclude that all the orbiting electrons in the material would
shift in such a way as to add their magnetic ﬁelds to the applied ﬁeld, and thus that
the resultant magnetic ﬁeld at any point in the material would be greater than it would
be at that point if the material were not present.
A second moment, however, is attributed to electron spin. Although it is tempting
to model this phenomenon by considering the electron as spinning about its own axis
and thus generating a magnetic dipole moment, satisfactory quantitative results are
not obtained from such a theory. Instead, it is necessary to digest the mathematics of
relativistic quantum theory to show that an electron may have a spin magnetic moment
of about ±9 × 10−24 A · m2; the plus and minus signs indicate that alignment aiding
or opposing an external magnetic ﬁeld is possible. In an atom with many electrons
present, only the spins of those electrons in shells which are not completely ﬁlled will
contribute to a magnetic moment for the atom.
A third contribution to the moment of an atom is caused by nuclear spin. Although
this factor provides a negligible effect on the overall magnetic properties of materials,
it is the basis of the nuclear magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) procedure provided
by many of the larger hospitals.
Thus each atom contains many different component moments, and their com-
bination determines the magnetic characteristics of the material and provides its
general magnetic classiﬁcation. We describe brieﬂy six different types of material:
diamagnetic, paramagnetic, ferromagnetic, antiferromagnetic, ferrimagnetic, and
superparamagnetic.

CHAPTER 8
Magnetic Forces, Materials, and Inductance
245
Let us ﬁrst consider atoms in which the small magnetic ﬁelds produced by the
motion of the electrons in their orbits and those produced by the electron spin combine
to produce a net ﬁeld of zero. Note that we are considering here the ﬁelds produced
by the electron motion itself in the absence of any external magnetic ﬁeld; we might
also describe this material as one in which the permanent magnetic moment m0 of
each atom is zero. Such a material is termed diamagnetic. It would seem, therefore,
that an external magnetic ﬁeld would produce no torque on the atom, no realignment
of the dipole ﬁelds, and consequently an internal magnetic ﬁeld that is the same as the
applied ﬁeld. With an error that only amounts to about one part in a hundred thousand,
this is correct.
Let us select an orbiting electron whose moment m is in the same direction as
the applied ﬁeld B0 (Figure 8.8). The magnetic ﬁeld produces an outward force on
the orbiting electron. Since the orbital radius is quantized and cannot change, the
inward Coulomb force of attraction is also unchanged. The force unbalance created
by the outward magnetic force must therefore be compensated for by a reduced orbital
velocity. Hence, the orbital moment decreases, and a smaller internal ﬁeld results.
If we had selected an atom for which m and B0 were opposed, the magnetic force
would be inward, the velocity would increase, the orbital moment would increase, and
greater cancellation of B0 would occur. Again a smaller internal ﬁeld would result.
Metallic bismuth shows a greater diamagnetic effect than most other diamag-
netic materials, among which are hydrogen, helium, the other “inert” gases, sodium
chloride, copper, gold, silicon, germanium, graphite, and sulfur. We should also re-
alize that the diamagnetic effect is present in all materials, because it arises from an
interaction of the external magnetic ﬁeld with every orbiting electron; however, it is
overshadowed by other effects in the materials we shall consider next.
Now consider an atom in which the effects of the electron spin and orbital motion
do not quite cancel. The atom as a whole has a small magnetic moment, but the random
orientation of the atoms in a larger sample produces an average magnetic moment
of zero. The material shows no magnetic effects in the absence of an external ﬁeld.
Figure 8.8
An orbiting electron is shown having
a magnetic moment m in the same direction as an
applied field B0.

246
ENGINEERING ELECTROMAGNETICS
When an external ﬁeld is applied, however, there is a small torque on each atomic
moment, and these moments tend to become aligned with the external ﬁeld. This
alignment acts to increase the value of B within the material over the external value.
However, the diamagnetic effect is still operating on the orbiting electrons and may
counteract the increase. If the net result is a decrease in B, the material is still called
diamagnetic. However, if there is an increase in B, the material is termed paramag-
netic. Potassium, oxygen, tungsten, and the rare earth elements and many of their salts,
such as erbium chloride, neodymium oxide, and yttrium oxide, one of the materials
used in masers, are examples of paramagnetic substances.
The remaining four classes of material, ferromagnetic, antiferromagnetic, fer-
rimagnetic, and superparamagnetic, all have strong atomic moments. Moreover, the
interaction of adjacent atoms causes an alignment of the magnetic moments of the
atoms in either an aiding or exactly opposing manner.
In ferromagnetic materials, each atom has a relatively large dipole moment,
caused primarily by uncompensated electron spin moments. Interatomic forces cause
these moments to line up in a parallel fashion over regions containing a large number
of atoms. These regions are called domains, and they may have a variety of shapes
and sizes ranging from one micrometer to several centimeters, depending on the size,
shape, material, and magnetic history of the sample. Virgin ferromagnetic materials
will have domains which each have a strong magnetic moment; the domain moments,
however, vary in direction from domain to domain. The overall effect is therefore one
ofcancellation,andthematerialasawholehasnomagneticmoment.Uponapplication
of an external magnetic ﬁeld, however, those domains which have moments in the
direction of the applied ﬁeld increase their size at the expense of their neighbors,
and the internal magnetic ﬁeld increases greatly over that of the external ﬁeld alone.
When the external ﬁeld is removed, a completely random domain alignment is not
usually attained, and a residual, or remnant, dipole ﬁeld remains in the macroscopic
structure. The fact that the magnetic moment of the material is different after the
ﬁeld has been removed, or that the magnetic state of the material is a function of its
magnetic history, is called hysteresis, a subject which will be discussed again when
magnetic circuits are studied in Section 8.8.
Ferromagnetic materials are not isotropic in single crystals, and we will therefore
limit our discussion to polycrystalline materials, except for mentioning that one of the
characteristics of anisotropic magnetic materials is magnetostriction, or the change
in dimensions of the crystal when a magnetic ﬁeld is impressed on it.
The only elements that are ferromagnetic at room temperature are iron, nickel,
and cobalt, and they lose all their ferromagnetic characteristics above a temperature
called the Curie temperature, which is 1043 K (770◦C) for iron. Some alloys of these
metals with each other and with other metals are also ferromagnetic, as for example
alnico, an aluminum-nickel-cobalt alloy with a small amount of copper. At lower
temperatures some of the rare earth elements, such as gadolinium and dysprosium,
are ferromagnetic. It is also interesting that some alloys of nonferromagnetic metals
are ferromagnetic, such as bismuth-manganese and copper-manganese-tin.
In antiferromagnetic materials, the forces between adjacent atoms cause the
atomic moments to line up in an antiparallel fashion. The net magnetic moment is

zero, and antiferromagnetic materials are affected only slightly by the presence of
an external magnetic ﬁeld. This effect was ﬁrst discovered in manganese oxide, but
several hundred antiferromagnetic materials have been identiﬁed since then. Many
oxides, sulﬁdes, and chlorides are included, such as nickel oxide (NiO), ferrous sulﬁde
(FeS), and cobalt chloride (CoCl2). Antiferromagnetism is only present at relatively
low temperatures, often well below room temperature. The effect is not of engineering
importance at present.
The ferrimagnetic substances also show an antiparallel alignment of adjacent
atomic moments, but the moments are not equal. A large response to an exter-
nal magnetic ﬁeld therefore occurs, although not as large as that in ferromagnetic
materials. The most important group of ferrimagnetic materials are the ferrites, in
which the conductivity is low, several orders of magnitude less than that of semi-
conductors. The fact that these substances have greater resistance than the ferro-
magnetic materials results in much smaller induced currents in the material when
alternating ﬁelds are applied, as for example in transformer cores that operate at
the higher frequencies. The reduced currents (eddy currents) lead to lower ohmic
losses in the transformer core. The iron oxide magnetite (Fe3O4), a nickel-zinc fer-
rite (Ni1/2Zn1/2Fe2O4), and a nickel ferrite (NiFe2O4) are examples of this class of
materials. Ferrimagnetism also disappears above the Curie temperature.
Superparamagnetic materials are composed of an assembly of ferromagnetic
particles in a nonferromagnetic matrix. Although domains exist within the individual
particles, the domain walls cannot penetrate the intervening matrix material to the
adjacent particle. An important example is the magnetic tape used in audiotape or
videotape recorders.
Table 8.1 summarizes the characteristics of the six types of magnetic materials
we have discussed.

MAGNETIZATION AND PERMEABILITY
To place our description of magnetic materials on a more quantitative basis, we will
now devote a page or so to showing how the magnetic dipoles act as a distributed
source for the magnetic ﬁeld. Our result will be an equation that looks very much like
Amp`ere’s circuital law,

H · dL = I. The current, however, will be the movement of

248
ENGINEERING ELECTROMAGNETICS
bound charges (orbital electrons, electron spin, and nuclear spin), and the ﬁeld, which
has the dimensions of H, will be called the magnetization M. The current produced
by the bound charges is called a bound current or Amperian current.
Let us begin by deﬁning the magnetization M in terms of the magnetic dipole
moment m. The bound current Ib circulates about a path enclosing a differential area
dS, establishing a dipole moment (A · m2),
m = IbdS
If there are n magnetic dipoles per unit volume and we consider a volume ν, then
the total magnetic dipole moment is found by the vector sum
mtotal =

i=1

(19)
Each of the mi may be different. Next, we deﬁne the magnetization M as the magnetic
dipole moment per unit volume,
M = lim

and see that its units must be the same as for H, amperes per meter.
Now let us consider the effect of some alignment of the magnetic dipoles as
the result of the application of a magnetic ﬁeld. We shall investigate this alignment
along a closed path, a short portion of which is shown in Figure 8.9. The ﬁgure shows
several magnetic moments m that make an angle θ with the element of path dL; each
moment consists of a bound current Ib circulating about an area dS. We are therefore
considering a small volume, dS cos θdL, or dS · dL, within which there are ndS · dL
magnetic dipoles. In changing from a random orientation to this partial alignment,
the bound current crossing the surface enclosed by the path (to our left as we travel in
the aL direction in Figure 8.9) has increased by Ib for each of the ndS · dL dipoles.
Thus the differential change in the net bound current IB over the segment dL will be
dIB = nIbdS · dL = M · dL
(20)
and within an entire closed contour,
IB =

M · dL
(21)
Figure 8.9
A section dL of a closed path along which magnetic dipoles have been
partially aligned by some external magnetic field. The alignment has caused the bound
current crossing the surface defined by the closed path to increase by nI bdS · dL A.

CHAPTER 8
Magnetic Forces, Materials, and Inductance
249
Equation (21) merely says that if we go around a closed path and ﬁnd dipole moments
going our way more often than not, there will be a corresponding current composed
of, for example, orbiting electrons crossing the interior surface.
This last expression has some resemblance to Amp`ere’s circuital law, and we
may now generalize the relationship between B and H so that it applies to media
other than free space. Our present discussion is based on the forces and torques on
differential current loops in a B ﬁeld, and we therefore take B as our fundamental
quantity and seek an improved deﬁnition of H. We thus write Amp`ere’s circuital law
in terms of the total current, bound plus free,

B
µ0
· dL = IT
(22)
where
IT = IB + I
and I is the total free current enclosed by the closed path. Note that the free current
appears without subscript since it is the most important type of current and will be
the only current appearing in Maxwell’s equations.
Combining these last three equations, we obtain an expression for the free current
enclosed,
I = IT −IB =
  B
µ0
−M
	
· dL
(23)
We may now deﬁne H in terms of B and M,
H = B
µ0
−M
(24)
and we see that B = µ0H in free space where the magnetization is zero. This rela-
tionship is usually written in a form that avoids fractions and minus signs:
B = µ0(H + M)
(25)
We may now use our newly deﬁned H ﬁeld in (23),
I =

H · dL
(26)
obtaining Amp`ere’s circuital law in terms of the free currents.
Using the several current densities, we have
IB =

IT =

250
ENGINEERING ELECTROMAGNETICS
With the help of Stokes’ theorem, we may therefore transform (21), (26), and (22)
into the equivalent curl relationships:
∇× M = JB
∇× B
µ0
= JT
∇× H = J
(27)
We will emphasize only (26) and (27), the two expressions involving the free
charge, in the work that follows.
The relationship between B, H, and M expressed by (25) may be simpliﬁed for
linear isotropic media where a magnetic susceptibility χm can be deﬁned:
M = χmH
(28)
Thus we have
B = µ0(H + χmH)
= µ0µrH
where
µr = 1 + χm
(29)
is deﬁned as the relative permeability µr. We next deﬁne the permeability µ:
µ = µ0µr
(30)
and this enables us to write the simple relationship between B and H,
B = µH
(31)
EXAMPLE 8.5
Given a ferrite material that we shall specify to be operating in a linear mode with
B = 0.05 T, let us assume µr = 50, and calculate values for χm, M, and H.
Solution. Because µr = 1 + χm, we have
χm = µr −1 = 49
Also,
B = µrµ0H
and
H =
0.05
50 × 4π × 10−7 = 796 A/m

CHAPTER 8
Magnetic Forces, Materials, and Inductance
251
The magnetization is M = χm H, or 39, 000 A/m. The alternate ways of relating B
and H are, ﬁrst,
B = µ0(H + M)
or
0.05 = 4π × 10−7(796 + 39, 000)
showing that Amperian currents produce 49 times the magnetic ﬁeld intensity that
the free charges do; and second,
B = µrµ0H
or
0.05 = 50 × 4π × 10−7 × 796
where we use a relative permeability of 50 and let this quantity account completely
for the notion of the bound charges. We shall emphasize the latter interpretation in
the chapters that follow.
The ﬁrst two laws that we investigated for magnetic ﬁelds were the Biot-Savart
law and Amp`ere’s circuital law. Both were restricted to free space in their application.
We may now extend their use to any homogeneous, linear, isotropic magnetic material
that may be described in terms of a relative permeability µr.
Just as we found for anisotropic dielectric materials, the permeability of an
anisotropic magnetic material must be given as a 3 × 3 matrix, and B and H are
both 3 × 1 matrices. We have
Bx = µxx Hx + µxy Hy + µxz Hz
By = µyx Hx + µyy Hy + µyz Hz
Bz = µzx Hx + µzy Hy + µzz Hz
For anisotropic materials, then, B = µH is a matrix equation; however, B =
µ0(H + M) remains valid, although B, H, and M are no longer parallel in general.
The most common anisotropic magnetic material is a single ferromagnetic crystal,
although thin magnetic ﬁlms also exhibit anisotropy. Most applications of ferromag-
netic materials, however, involve polycrystalline arrays that are much easier to make.
Our deﬁnitions of susceptibility and permeability also depend on the assumption
of linearity. Unfortunately, this is true only in the less interesting paramagnetic and
diamagnetic materials for which the relative permeability rarely differs from unity
by more than one part in a thousand. Some typical values of the susceptibility for
diamagnetic materials are hydrogen, −2 × 10−5; copper, −0.9 × 10−5; germanium,
−0.8 × 10−5; silicon, −0.3 × 10−5; and graphite,−12 × 10−5. Several representative
paramagnetic susceptibilities are oxygen, 2×10−6; tungsten, 6.8×10−5; ferric oxide
(Fe2O3), 1.4 × 10−3; and yttrium oxide (Y2O3), 0.53 × 10−6. If we simply take the
ratio of B to µ0H as the relative permeability of a ferromagnetic material, typical

252
ENGINEERING ELECTROMAGNETICS
values of µr would range from 10 to 100, 000. Diamagnetic, paramagnetic, and
antiferromagnetic materials are commonly said to be nonmagnetic.

8.7
MAGNETIC BOUNDARY CONDITIONS
We should have no difﬁculty in arriving at the proper boundary conditions to apply to
B, H, and M at the interface between two different magnetic materials, for we have
solved similar problems for both conducting materials and dielectrics. We need no
new techniques.
Figure 8.10 shows a boundary between two isotropic homogeneous linear materi-
als with permeabilities µ1 and µ2. The boundary condition on the normal components
Figure 8.10
A gaussian surface and a closed path are
constructed at the boundary between media 1 and 2, having
permeabilities of µ1 and µ2, respectively. From this we determine the
boundary conditions BN1 = BN2 and Ht1 −Ht2 = K , the component
of the surface current density directed into the page.

CHAPTER 8
Magnetic Forces, Materials, and Inductance
253
is determined by allowing the surface to cut a small cylindrical gaussian surface.
Applying Gauss’s law for the magnetic ﬁeld from Section 7.5,

S
B · dS = 0
we ﬁnd that
BN1S −BN2S = 0
or
BN2 = BN1
(32)
Thus
HN2 = µ1
µ2
HN1
(33)
The normal component of B is continuous, but the normal component of H is discon-
tinuous by the ratio µ1/µ2.
The relationship between the normal components of M, of course, is ﬁxed once
the relationship between the normal components of H is known. For linear magnetic
materials, the result is written simply as
MN2 = χm2
µ1
µ2
HN1 = χm2µ1
χm1µ2

(34)
Next, Amp`ere’s circuital law

H · dL = I
is applied about a small closed path in a plane normal to the boundary surface, as
shown to the right in Figure 8.10. Taking a clockwise trip around the path, we ﬁnd
that
Ht1L −Ht2L = KL
where we assume that the boundary may carry a surface current K whose component
normal to the plane of the closed path is K. Thus
Ht1 −Ht2 = K
(35)
The directions are speciﬁed more exactly by using the cross product to identify the
tangential components,
(H1 −H2) × aN12 = K
where aN12 is the unit normal at the boundary directed from region 1 to region 2. An
equivalent formulation in terms of the vector tangential components may be more
convenient for H:
Ht1 −Ht2 = aN12 × K

254
ENGINEERING ELECTROMAGNETICS
For tangential B, we have
Bt1
µ1
−Bt2
µ2
= K
(36)
The boundary condition on the tangential component of the magnetization for linear
materials is therefore
Mt2 = χm2
χm1
Mt1 −χm2K
(37)
The last three boundary conditions on the tangential components are much sim-
pler, of course, if the surface current density is zero. This is a free current density,
and it must be zero if neither material is a conductor.
EXAMPLE 8.6
Toillustratetheserelationshipswithanexample,letusassumethat µ = µ1 = 4 µH/m
in region 1 where z > 0, whereas µ2 = 7 µH/m in region 2 wherever z < 0. Moreover,
let K = 80ax A/m on the surface z = 0. We establish a ﬁeld, B1 = 2ax −3ay +
az mT, in region 1 and seek the value of B2.
Solution. The normal component of B1 is
BN1 = (B1 · aN12)aN12 = [(2ax −3ay + az) · (−az)](−az) = az mT
Thus,
BN2 = BN1 = az mT
We next determine the tangential components:
Bt1 = B1 −BN1 = 2ax −3ay mT
and
Ht1 = Bt1
µ1
= (2ax −3ay)10−3
4 × 10−6
= 500ax −750ay A/m
Thus,
Ht2 = Ht1 −aN12 × K = 500ax −750ay −(−az) × 80ax
= 500ax −750ay + 80ay = 500ax −670ay A/m
and
Bt2 = µ2Ht2 = 7 × 10−6(500ax −670ay) = 3.5ax −4.69ay mT
Therefore,
B2 = BN2 + Bt2 = 3.5ax −4.69ay + az mT

8.8
THE MAGNETIC CIRCUIT
In this section, we digress brieﬂy to discuss the fundamental techniques involved in
solving a class of magnetic problems known as magnetic circuits. As we will see
shortly, the name arises from the great similarity to the dc-resistive-circuit analysis
with which it is assumed we are all familiar. The only important difference lies in the
nonlinear nature of the ferromagnetic portions of the magnetic circuit; the methods
which must be adopted are similar to those required in nonlinear electric circuits which
contain diodes, thermistors, incandescent ﬁlaments, and other nonlinear elements.
As a convenient starting point, let us identify those ﬁeld equations on which
resistive circuit analysis is based. At the same time we will point out or derive the
analogous equations for the magnetic circuit. We begin with the electrostatic potential
and its relationship to electric ﬁeld intensity,
E = −∇V
(38a)
The scalar magnetic potential has already been deﬁned, and its analogous relation to
the magnetic ﬁeld intensity is
H = −∇Vm
(38b)
In dealing with magnetic circuits, it is convenient to call Vm the magnetomotive force,
or mmf, and we shall acknowledge the analogy to the electromotive force, or emf,
by doing so. The units of the mmf are, of course, amperes, but it is customary to
recognize that coils with many turns are often employed by using the term “ampere-
turns.” Remember that no current may ﬂow in any region in which Vm is deﬁned.
The electric potential difference between points A and B may be written as
VAB =
 B
A
E · dL
(39a)
and the corresponding relationship between the mmf and the magnetic ﬁeld intensity,
Vm AB =
 B
A
H · dL
(39b)
was developed in Chapter 7, where we learned that the path selected must not cross
the chosen barrier surface.

256
ENGINEERING ELECTROMAGNETICS
Ohm’s law for the electric circuit has the point form
J = σE
(40a)
and we see that the magnetic ﬂux density will be the analog of the current density,
B = µH
(40b)
To ﬁnd the total current, we must integrate:
I =

S
J · dS
(41a)
A corresponding operation is necessary to determine the total magnetic ﬂux ﬂowing
through the cross section of a magnetic circuit:
 =

S
B · dS
(41b)
We then deﬁned resistance as the ratio of potential difference and current, or
V = IR
(42a)
and we shall now deﬁne reluctance as the ratio of the magnetomotive force to the
total ﬂux; thus
Vm = ℜ
(42b)
where reluctance is measured in ampere-turns per weber (A · t/Wb). In resistors that
are made of a linear isotropic homogeneous material of conductivity σ and have a
uniform cross section of area S and length d, the total resistance is
R = d
σS
(43a)
If we are fortunate enough to have such a linear isotropic homogeneous magnetic
material of length d and uniform cross section S, then the total reluctance is
ℜ= d
µS
(43b)
The only such material to which we shall commonly apply this relationship is air.
Finally, let us consider the analog of the source voltage in an electric circuit. We
know that the closed line integral of E is zero,

E · dL = 0
In other words, Kirchhoff’s voltage law states that the rise in potential through the
source is exactly equal to the fall in potential through the load. The expression for

CHAPTER 8
Magnetic Forces, Materials, and Inductance
257
magnetic phenomena takes on a slightly different form,

H · dL = Itotal
for the closed line integral is not zero. Because the total current linked by the path
is usually obtained by allowing a current I to ﬂow through an N-turn coil, we may
express this result as

H · dL = NI
(44)
In an electric circuit, the voltage source is a part of the closed path; in the magnetic
circuit, the current-carrying coil will surround or link the magnetic circuit. In tracing
a magnetic circuit, we will not be able to identify a pair of terminals at which the
magnetomotive force is applied. The analogy is closer here to a pair of coupled circuits
in which induced voltages exist (and in which we will see in Chapter 9 that the closed
line integral of E is also not zero).
Let us try out some of these ideas on a simple magnetic circuit. In order to avoid
the complications of ferromagnetic materials at this time, we will assume that we
have an air-core toroid with 500 turns, a cross-sectional area of 6 cm2, a mean radius
of 15 cm, and a coil current of 4 A. As we already know, the magnetic ﬁeld is conﬁned
to the interior of the toroid, and if we consider the closed path of our magnetic circuit
along the mean radius, we link 2000 A · t,
Vm, source = 2000 A · t
Although the ﬁeld in the toroid is not quite uniform, we may assume that it is, for all
practical purposes, and calculate the total reluctance of the circuit as
ℜ= d
µS =
2π(0.15)
4π10−7 × 6 × 10−4 = 1.25 × 109 A·t/Wb
Thus
 = Vm,S
ℜ
=
2000
1.25 × 109 = 1.6 × 10−6 Wb
This value of the total ﬂux is in error by less than 1
4 percent, in comparison with the
value obtained when the exact distribution of ﬂux over the cross section is used.
Hence
B = 
S = 1.6 × 10−6
6 × 10−4
= 2.67 × 10−3 T
and ﬁnally,
H = B
µ = 2.67 × 10−3
4π10−7
= 2120 A·t/m
As a check,we mayapplyAmp`ere’scircuitallawdirectlyinthissymmetricalproblem,

258
ENGINEERING ELECTROMAGNETICS
and obtain
Hφ = NI
2πr =
500 × 4
6.28 × 0.15 = 2120 A/m
at the mean radius.
Our magnetic circuit in this example does not give us any opportunity to ﬁnd the
mmf across different elements in the circuit, for there is only one type of material.
The analogous electric circuit is, of course, a single source and a single resistor. We
could make it look just as long as the preceding analysis, however, if we found the
current density, the electric ﬁeld intensity, the total current, the resistance, and the
source voltage.
More interesting and more practical problems arise when ferromagnetic materials
are present in the circuit. Let us begin by considering the relationship between B and
H in such a material. We may assume that we are establishing a curve of B versus
H for a sample of ferromagnetic material which is completely demagnetized; both
B and H are zero. As we begin to apply an mmf, the ﬂux density also rises, but not
linearly, as the experimental data of Figure 8.11 show near the origin. After H reaches
a value of about 100 A · t/m, the ﬂux density rises more slowly and begins to saturate
when H is several hundred A · t/m. Having reached partial saturation, let us now turn
to Figure 8.12, where we may continue our experiment at point x by reducing H. As
we do so, the effects of hysteresis begin to show, and we do not retrace our original
curve. Even after H is zero, B = Br, the remnant ﬂux density. As H is reversed,
then brought back to zero, and the complete cycle traced several times, the hysteresis
loop of Figure 8.12 is obtained. The mmf required to reduce the ﬂux density to zero
is identiﬁed as Hc, the coercive “force.” For smaller maximum values of H, smaller

hysteresis loops are obtained, and the locus of the tips is about the same as the virgin
magnetization curve of Figure 8.11.
EXAMPLE 8.7
Let us use the magnetization curve for silicon steel to solve a magnetic circuit problem
that is slightly different from our previous example. We use a steel core in the toroid,
except for an air gap of 2 mm. Magnetic circuits with air gaps occur because gaps
are deliberately introduced in some devices, such as inductors, which must carry
large direct currents, because they are unavoidable in other devices such as rotating
machines, or because of unavoidable problems in assembly. There are still 500 turns
about the toroid, and we ask what current is required to establish a ﬂux density of 1 T
everywhere in the core.

In the air gap,

4π10−7 × 6 × 10−4 = 2.65 × 106 A·t/Wb
Knowing the total ﬂux,
 = BS = 1(6 × 10−4) = 6 × 10−4 Wb

260
ENGINEERING ELECTROMAGNETICS
which is the same in both steel and air, we may ﬁnd the mmf required for the gap,
Vm,air = (6 × 10−4)(2.65 × 106) = 1590 A·t
ReferringtoFigure8.11,amagneticﬁeldstrengthof200A · t/misrequiredtoproduce
a ﬂux density of 1 T in the steel. Thus,
Hsteel = 200 A·t
Vm,steel = Hsteeldsteel = 200 × 0.30π
= 188 A·t
The total mmf is therefore 1778 A·t, and a coil current of 3.56 A is required.
We have made several approximations in obtaining this answer. We have already
mentioned the lack of a completely uniform cross section, or cylindrical symmetry;
the path of every ﬂux line is not of the same length. The choice of a “mean” path
length can help compensate for this error in problems in which it may be more
important than it is in our example. Fringing ﬂux in the air gap is another source of
error, and formulas are available by which we may calculate an effective length and
cross-sectional area for the gap which will yield more accurate results. There is also
a leakage ﬂux between the turns of wire, and in devices containing coils concentrated
on one section of the core, a few ﬂux lines bridge the interior of the toroid. Fringing
and leakage are problems that seldom arise in the electric circuit because the ratio
of the conductivities of air and the conductive or resistive materials used is so high.
In contrast, the magnetization curve for silicon steel shows that the ratio of H to B
in the steel is about 200 up to the “knee” of the magnetization curve; this compares
with a ratio in air of about 800, 000. Thus, although ﬂux prefers steel to air by the
commanding ratio of 4000 to 1, this is not very close to the ratio of conductivities of,
say, 1015 for a good conductor and a fair insulator.
EXAMPLE 8.8
As a last example, let us consider the reverse problem. Given a coil current of 4 A in
the magnetic circuit of Example 8.7, what will the ﬂux density be?
Solution. First let us try to linearize the magnetization curve by a straight line from
the origin to B = 1, H = 200. We then have B = H/200 in steel and B = µ0H in air.
The two reluctances are found to be 0.314×106 for the steel path and 2.65×106 for the
air gap, or 2.96×106A · t/Wb total. Since Vm is 2000 A · t, the ﬂux is 6.76×10−4 Wb,
and B = 1.13 T. A more accurate solution may be obtained by assuming several values
of B and calculating the necessary mmf. Plotting the results enables us to determine
the true value of B by interpolation. With this method we obtain B = 1.10 T. The good
accuracy of the linear model results from the fact that the reluctance of the air gap
in a magnetic circuit is often much greater than the reluctance of the ferromagnetic
portion of the circuit. A relatively poor approximation for the iron or steel can thus
be tolerated.

POTENTIAL ENERGY AND FORCES
ON MAGNETIC MATERIALS
In the electrostatic ﬁeld we ﬁrst introduced the point charge and the experimental law
of force between point charges. After deﬁning electric ﬁeld intensity, electric ﬂux
density, and electric potential, we were able to ﬁnd an expression for the energy in an
electrostatic ﬁeld by establishing the work necessary to bring the prerequisite point
charges from inﬁnity to their ﬁnal resting places. The general expression for energy is
WE = 1

(45)
where a linear relationship between D and E is assumed.
This is not as easily done for the steady magnetic ﬁeld. It would seem that we
might assume two simple sources, perhaps two current sheets, ﬁnd the force on one

262
ENGINEERING ELECTROMAGNETICS
due to the other, move the sheet a differential distance against this force, and equate
the necessary work to the change in energy. If we did, we would be wrong, because
Faraday’s law (coming up in Chapter 9) shows that there will be a voltage induced
in the moving current sheet against which the current must be maintained. Whatever
source is supplying the current sheet turns out to receive half the energy we are putting
into the circuit by moving it.
In other words, energy density in the magnetic ﬁeld may be determined more
easily after time-varying ﬁelds are discussed. We will develop the appropriate expres-
sion in discussing Poynting’s theorem in Chapter 11.
An alternate approach would be possible at this time, however, for we might
deﬁne a magnetostatic ﬁeld based on assumed magnetic poles (or “magnetic
charges”). Using the scalar magnetic potential, we could then develop an energy
expression by methods similar to those used in obtaining the electrostatic energy
relationship. These new magnetostatic quantities we would have to introduce would
be too great a price to pay for one simple result, and we will therefore merely present
the result at this time and show that the same expression arises in the Poynting the-
orem later. The total energy stored in a steady magnetic ﬁeld in which B is linearly
related to H is

It is again convenient to think of this energy as being distributed throughout the
volume with an energy density of 1
2B · H J/m3, although we have no mathematical
justiﬁcation for such a statement.
In spite of the fact that these results are valid only for linear media, we may use
them to calculate the forces on nonlinear magnetic materials if we focus our attention
on the linear media (usually air) which may surround them. For example, suppose
that we have a long solenoid with a silicon-steel core. A coil containing n turns/m
with a current I surrounds it. The magnetic ﬁeld intensity in the core is therefore
nIA · t/m, and the magnetic ﬂux density can be obtained from the magnetization
curve for silicon steel. Let us call this value Bst. Suppose that the core is composed of
two semi-inﬁnite cylinders2 that are just touching. We now apply a mechanical force
to separate these two sections of the core while keeping the ﬂux density constant. We
apply a force F over a distance dL, thus doing work F dL. Faraday’s law does not

apply here, for the ﬁelds in the core have not changed, and we can therefore use the
principle of virtual work to determine that the work we have done in moving one core
appears as stored energy in the air gap we have created. By (48), this increase is

INDUCTANCE AND MUTUAL
INDUCTANCE
Inductance is the last of the three familiar parameters from circuit theory that we are
deﬁning in more general terms. Resistance was deﬁned in Chapter 5 as the ratio of
the potential difference between two equipotential surfaces of a conducting material
to the total current crossing either equipotential surface. The resistance is a function
of conductor geometry and conductivity only. Capacitance was deﬁned in the same
chapter as the ratio of the total charge on either of two equipotential conducting
surfaces to the potential difference between the surfaces. Capacitance is a function
only of the geometry of the two conducting surfaces and the permittivity of the
dielectric medium between or surrounding them.
As a prelude to deﬁning inductance, we ﬁrst need to introduce the concept of ﬂux
linkage. Let us consider a toroid of N turns in which a current I produces a total ﬂux
. We assume ﬁrst that this ﬂux links or encircles each of the N turns, and we also
see that each of the N turns links the total ﬂux . The ﬂux linkage N is deﬁned as
the product of the number of turns N and the ﬂux  linking each of them.3 For a coil
having a single turn, the ﬂux linkage is equal to the total ﬂux.
3 The symbol λ is commonly used for ﬂux linkages. We will only occasionally use this concept,
however, and we will continue to write it as N.

264
ENGINEERING ELECTROMAGNETICS
We now deﬁne inductance (or self-inductance) as the ratio of the total ﬂux link-
ages to the current which they link,
L = N
I
(49)
The current I ﬂowing in the N-turn coil produces the total ﬂux  and N ﬂux
linkages, where we assume for the moment that the ﬂux  links each turn. This
deﬁnition is applicable only to magnetic media which are linear, so that the ﬂux is
proportional to the current. If ferromagnetic materials are present, there is no single
deﬁnition of inductance which is useful in all cases, and we shall restrict our attention
to linear materials.
The unit of inductance is the henry (H), equivalent to one weber-turn per ampere.
Let us apply (49) in a straightforward way to calculate the inductance per meter
length of a coaxial cable of inner radius a and outer radius b. We may take the
expression for total ﬂux developed as Eq. (42) in Chapter 7,
 = µ0Id
2π
ln b
a
and obtain the inductance rapidly for a length d,
L = µ0d
2π ln b
a H
or, on a per-meter basis,
L = µ0
2π ln b
a H/m
(50)
In this case, N = 1 turn, and all the ﬂux links all the current.
In the problem of a toroidal coil of N turns and a current I, as shown in Fig-
ure 7.12b, we have
Bφ = µ0NI
2πρ
If the dimensions of the cross section are small compared with the mean radius of the
toroid ρ0, then the total ﬂux is
 = µ0NIS
2πρ0
where S is the cross-sectional area. Multiplying the total ﬂux by N, we have the ﬂux
linkages, and dividing by I, we have the inductance
L = µ0N 2S
2πρ0
(51)
Once again we have assumed that all the ﬂux links all the turns, and this is a
good assumption for a toroidal coil of many turns packed closely together. Suppose,
however, that our toroid has an appreciable spacing between turns, a short part of
which might look like Figure 8.14. The ﬂux linkages are no longer the product of the

where i is the ﬂux linking the ith turn. Rather than doing this, we usually rely on
experience and empirical quantities called winding factors and pitch factors to adjust
the basic formula to apply to the real physical world.
An equivalent deﬁnition for inductance may be made using an energy point
of view,
L = 2WH
I 2
(52)
where I is the total current ﬂowing in the closed path and WH is the energy in the
magnetic ﬁeld produced by the current. After using (52) to obtain several other general
expressions for inductance, we will show that it is equivalent to (49). We ﬁrst express
the potential energy WH in terms of the magnetic ﬁelds,
L =

and then replace B by ∇× A,

The surface integral is zero, as the surface encloses the volume containing all the

inductance may therefore be written as
L = 1
I 2

vol
A · J dν
(56)
Equation (56) expresses the inductance in terms of an integral of the values of
A and J at every point. Because current density exists only within the conductor, the
integrand is zero at all points outside the conductor, and the vector magnetic potential
need not be determined there. The vector potential is that which arises from the current
J, and any other current source contributing a vector potential ﬁeld in the region of
the original current density is to be ignored for the present. Later we will see that this
leads to a mutual inductance.
The vector magnetic potential A due to J is given by Eq. (51), Chapter 7,
A =

Our only present interest in Eqs. (57) and (58) lies in their implication that the
inductance is a function of the distribution of the current in space or the geometry of
the conductor conﬁguration.
To obtain our original deﬁnition of inductance (49), let us hypothesize a uniform
current distribution in a ﬁlamentary conductor of small cross section so that J dν

or

(60)
Retracing the steps by which (60) is obtained, we should see that the ﬂux  is
that portion of the total ﬂux that passes through any and every open surface whose
perimeter is the ﬁlamentary current path.
If we now let the ﬁlament make N identical turns about the total ﬂux, an idealiza-
tion that may be closely realized in some types of inductors, the closed line integral
must consist of N laps about this common path, and (60) becomes
L = N
I
(61)
The ﬂux  is now the ﬂux crossing any surface whose perimeter is the path occupied
by any one of the N turns. The inductance of an N-turn coil may still be obtained
from (60), however, if we realize that the ﬂux is that which crosses the complicated
surface4 whose perimeter consists of all N turns.
Use of any of the inductance expressions for a true ﬁlamentary conductor (having
zero radius) leads to an inﬁnite value of inductance, regardless of the conﬁguration
of the ﬁlament. Near the conductor, Amp`ere’s circuital law shows that the magnetic
ﬁeld intensity varies inversely with the distance from the conductor, and a simple
integration soon shows that an inﬁnite amount of energy and an inﬁnite amount of
ﬂux are contained within any ﬁnite cylinder about the ﬁlament. This difﬁculty is
eliminated by specifying a small but ﬁnite ﬁlamentary radius.
The interior of any conductor also contains magnetic ﬂux, and this ﬂux links a
variable fraction of the total current, depending on its location. These ﬂux linkages
lead to an internal inductance, which must be combined with the external inductance
to obtain the total inductance. The internal inductance of a long, straight wire of
circular cross section, radius a, and uniform current distribution is

4 Somewhat like a spiral ramp.

268
ENGINEERING ELECTROMAGNETICS
In Chapter 11, we will see that the current distribution in a conductor at high
frequencies tends to be concentrated near the surface. The internal ﬂux is reduced, and
it is usually sufﬁcient to consider only the external inductance. At lower frequencies,
however, internal inductance may become an appreciable part of the total inductance.
We conclude by deﬁning the mutual inductance between circuits 1 and 2, M12,
in terms of mutual ﬂux linkages,
M12 = N212
I1
(63)
where 12 signiﬁes the ﬂux produced by I1 which links the path of the ﬁlamentary
current I2, and N2 is the number of turns in circuit 2. The mutual inductance, there-
fore, depends on the magnetic interaction between two currents. With either current
alone, the total energy stored in the magnetic ﬁeld can be found in terms of a single
inductance, or self-inductance; with both currents having nonzero values, the total
energy is a function of the two self-inductances and the mutual inductance. In terms
of a mutual energy, it can be shown that (63) is equivalent to
M12 =

(B1 · H2)dν
(64)
or
M12 =

(65)
where B1 is the ﬁeld resulting from I1 (with I2 = 0) and H2 is the ﬁeld arising from
I2 (with I1 = 0). Interchange of the subscripts does not change the right-hand side of
(65), and therefore
M12 = M21
(66)
Mutual inductance is also measured in henrys, and we rely on the context to allow
us to differentiate it from magnetization, also represented by M.
EXAMPLE 8.9
Calculate the self-inductances of and the mutual inductances between two coaxial
solenoids of radius R1 and R2, R2 > R1, carrying currents I1 and I2 with n1 and
n2 turns/m, respectively.
Solution. We ﬁrst attack the mutual inductances. From Eq. (15), Chapter 7, we let
n1 = N/d, and obtain
H1 = n1I1az
(0 < ρ < R1)

(ρ > R1)
and
H2 = n2I2az
(0 < ρ < R2)

Thus, for this uniform ﬁeld
12 = µ0n1I1πR2

and
M12 = µ0n1n2πR2

Similarly,
21 = µ0n2I2πR2
1
M21 = µ0n1n2πR2
1 = M12
If n1 = 50 turns/cm, n2 = 80 turns/cm, R1 = 2 cm, and R2 = 3 cm, then
M12 = M21 = 4π × 10−7(5000)(8000)π(0.022) = 63.2 mH/m
The self-inductances are easily found. The ﬂux produced in coil 1 by I1 is
11 = µ0n1I1πR2
1
and thus
L1 = µ0n2
1S1d H
The inductance per unit length is therefore
L1 = µ0n2
1S1 H/m
or
L1 = 39.5 mH/m
Similarly,
L2 = µ0n2
2S2 = 22.7 mH/m
We see, therefore, that there are many methods available for the calculation of
self-inductance and mutual inductance. Unfortunately, even problems possessing a
high degree of symmetry present very challenging integrals for evaluation, and only
a few problems are available for us to try our skill on.
Inductance will be discussed in circuit terms in Chapter 10.

he basic relationships of the electrostatic ﬁeld and the steady magnetic ﬁeld
were obtained in the previous eight chapters, and we are now ready to discuss
time-varying ﬁelds. The discussion will be short, for vector analysis and
vector calculus should now be more familiar tools; some of the relationships are
unchanged, and most of the relationships are changed only slightly.
Two new concepts will be introduced: the electric ﬁeld produced by a changing
magnetic ﬁeld and the magnetic ﬁeld produced by a changing electric ﬁeld. The ﬁrst
of these concepts resulted from experimental research by Michael Faraday and the
second from the theoretical efforts of James Clerk Maxwell.
Maxwell actually was inspired by Faraday’s experimental work and by the mental
picture provided through the “lines of force” that Faraday introduced in developing
his theory of electricity and magnetism. He was 40 years younger than Faraday, but
they knew each other during the ﬁve years Maxwell spent in London as a young
professor, a few years after Faraday had retired. Maxwell’s theory was developed
subsequent to his holding this university position while he was working alone at his
home in Scotland. It occupied him for ﬁve years between the ages of 35 and 40.
The four basic equations of electromagnetic theory presented in this chapter bear
his name. ■
9.1
FARADAY’S LAW
After Oersted1 demonstrated in 1820 that an electric current affected a compass
needle, Faraday professed his belief that if a current could produce a magnetic ﬁeld,
then a magnetic ﬁeld should be able to produce a current. The concept of the “ﬁeld”
1 Hans Christian Oersted was professor of physics at the University of Copenhagen in Denmark.

was not available at that time, and Faraday’s goal was to show that a current could be
produced by “magnetism.”
He worked on this problem intermittently over a period of 10 years, until he
was ﬁnally successful in 1831.2 He wound two separate windings on an iron toroid
and placed a galvanometer in one circuit and a battery in the other. Upon closing
the battery circuit, he noted a momentary deﬂection of the galvanometer; a similar
deﬂection in the opposite direction occurred when the battery was disconnected. This,
of course, was the ﬁrst experiment he made involving a changing magnetic ﬁeld, and
he followed it with a demonstration that either a moving magnetic ﬁeld or a moving
coil could also produce a galvanometer deﬂection.
In terms of ﬁelds, we now say that a time-varying magnetic ﬁeld produces an
electromotive force (emf) that may establish a current in a suitable closed circuit.
An electromotive force is merely a voltage that arises from conductors moving in a
magnetic ﬁeld or from changing magnetic ﬁelds, and we shall deﬁne it in this section.
Faraday’s law is customarily stated as
emf = −d
dt V
(1)
Equation (1) implies a closed path, although not necessarily a closed conducting
path; the closed path, for example, might include a capacitor, or it might be a purely
imaginary line in space. The magnetic ﬂux is that ﬂux which passes through any and
every surface whose perimeter is the closed path, and d/dt is the time rate of change
of this ﬂux.
A nonzero value of d/dt may result from any of the following situations:
1.
A time-changing ﬂux linking a stationary closed path
2.
Relative motion between a steady ﬂux and a closed path
3.
A combination of the two
The minus sign is an indication that the emf is in such a direction as to produce
a current whose ﬂux, if added to the original ﬂux, would reduce the magnitude of
the emf. This statement that the induced voltage acts to produce an opposing ﬂux is
known as Lenz’s law.3
If the closed path is that taken by an N-turn ﬁlamentary conductor, it is often
sufﬁciently accurate to consider the turns as coincident and let
emf = −N d
dt
(2)
where  is now interpreted as the ﬂux passing through any one of N coincident
paths.
2 Joseph Henry produced similar results at Albany Academy in New York at about the same time.
3 Henri Frederic Emile Lenz was born in Germany but worked in Russia. He published his law in 1834.

CHAPTER 9
Time-Varying Fields and Maxwell’s Equations
279
We need to deﬁne emf as used in (1) or (2). The emf is obviously a scalar, and
(perhaps not so obviously) a dimensional check shows that it is measured in volts.
We deﬁne the emf as
emf =

E · dL
(3)
and note that it is the voltage about a speciﬁc closed path. If any part of the path is
changed, generally the emf changes. The departure from static results is clearly shown
by(3),foranelectricﬁeldintensityresultingfromastaticchargedistributionmustlead
to zero potential difference about a closed path. In electrostatics, the line integral leads
to a potential difference; with time-varying ﬁelds, the result is an emf or a voltage.
Replacing  in (1) with the surface integral of B, we have
emf =

E · dL = −d
dt

S
B · dS
(4)
where the ﬁngers of our right hand indicate the direction of the closed path, and
our thumb indicates the direction of dS. A ﬂux density B in the direction of dS and
increasing with time thus produces an average value of E which is opposite to the
positive direction about the closed path. The right-handed relationship between the
surface integral and the closed line integral in (4) should always be kept in mind
during ﬂux integrations and emf determinations.
We will divide our investigation into two parts by ﬁrst ﬁnding the contribution to
the total emf made by a changing ﬁeld within a stationary path (transformer emf), and
then we will consider a moving path within a constant (motional, or generator, emf).
We ﬁrst consider a stationary path. The magnetic ﬂux is the only time-varying
quantity on the right side of (4), and a partial derivative may be taken under the integral
sign,
emf =

E · dL = −


∂t · dS
(5)
Before we apply this simple result to an example, let us obtain the point form of
this integral equation. Applying Stokes’ theorem to the closed line integral, we have

S
(∇× E) · dS = −

S
∂B
∂t · dS
where the surface integrals may be taken over identical surfaces. The surfaces are
perfectly general and may be chosen as differentials,
(∇× E) · dS = −∂B
∂t · dS
and
∇× E = −∂B
∂t
(6)

280
ENGINEERING ELECTROMAGNETICS
This is one of Maxwell’s four equations as written in differential, or point, form,
the form in which they are most generally used. Equation (5) is the integral form of
this equation and is equivalent to Faraday’s law as applied to a ﬁxed path. If B is not
a function of time, (5) and (6) evidently reduce to the electrostatic equations

E · dL = 0
(electrostatics)
and
∇× E = 0
(electrostatics)
As an example of the interpretation of (5) and (6), let us assume a simple magnetic
ﬁeld which increases exponentially with time within the cylindrical region ρ < b,
B = B0ektaz
(7)
where B0 = constant. Choosing the circular path ρ = a, a < b, in the z = 0 plane,
along which Eφ must be constant by symmetry, we then have from (5)
emf = 2πaEφ = −kB0ektπa2
The emf around this closed path is −kB0ektπa2. It is proportional to a2 because
the magnetic ﬂux density is uniform and the ﬂux passing through the surface at any
instant is proportional to the area.
If we now replace a with ρ, ρ < b, the electric ﬁeld intensity at any point is
E = −1
2kB0ektρaφ
(8)
Let us now attempt to obtain the same answer from (6), which becomes
(∇× E)z = −kB0ekt = 1
ρ
∂(ρEφ)
∂ρ
Multiplying by ρ and integrating from 0 to ρ (treating t as a constant, since the
derivative is a partial derivative),
−1
2kB0ektρ2 = ρEφ
or
E = −1
2kB0ektρaφ
once again.
If B0 is considered positive, a ﬁlamentary conductor of resistance R would have
a current ﬂowing in the negative aφ direction, and this current would establish a ﬂux
within the circular loop in the negative az direction. Because Eφ increases exponen-
tially with time, the current and ﬂux do also, and thus they tend to reduce the time rate
of increase of the applied ﬂux and the resultant emf in accordance with Lenz’s law.
Before leaving this example, it is well to point out that the given ﬁeld B does
not satisfy all of Maxwell’s equations. Such ﬁelds are often assumed (always in ac-
circuit problems) and cause no difﬁculty when they are interpreted properly. They

voltmeter reading is V12 = −Bvd.
occasionally cause surprise, however. This particular ﬁeld is discussed further in
Problem 9.19 at the end of the chapter.
Now let us consider the case of a time-constant ﬂux and a moving closed path.
Before we derive any special results from Faraday’s law (1), let us use the basic law to
analyze the speciﬁc problem outlined in Figure 9.1. The closed circuit consists of two
parallel conductors which are connected at one end by a high-resistance voltmeter of
negligible dimensions and at the other end by a sliding bar moving at a velocity v.
The magnetic ﬂux density B is constant (in space and time) and is normal to the plane
containing the closed path.
Let the position of the shorting bar be given by y; the ﬂux passing through the
surface within the closed path at any time t is then
 = Byd
From (1), we obtain
emf = −d
dt = −B dy
dt d = −Bνd
(9)
The emf is deﬁned as

E · dL and we have a conducting path, so we may actually
determine E at every point along the closed path. We found in electrostatics that the
tangential component of E is zero at the surface of a conductor, and we shall show in
Section 9.4 that the tangential component is zero at the surface of a perfect conductor
(σ = ∞) for all time-varying conditions. This is equivalent to saying that a perfect
conductor is a “short circuit.” The entire closed path in Figure 9.1 may be considered
a perfect conductor, with the exception of the voltmeter. The actual computation of

E · dL then must involve no contribution along the entire moving bar, both rails,
and the voltmeter leads. Because we are integrating in a counterclockwise direction

282
ENGINEERING ELECTROMAGNETICS
(keeping the interior of the positive side of the surface on our left as usual), the
contribution E L across the voltmeter must be −Bνd, showing that the electric
ﬁeld intensity in the instrument is directed from terminal 2 to terminal 1. For an up-
scale reading, the positive terminal of the voltmeter should therefore be terminal 2.
The direction of the resultant small current ﬂow may be conﬁrmed by noting that
the enclosed ﬂux is reduced by a clockwise current in accordance with Lenz’s law.
The voltmeter terminal 2 is again seen to be the positive terminal.
Let us now consider this example using the concept of motional emf. The force
on a charge Q moving at a velocity v in a magnetic ﬁeld B is
F = Qv × B
or
F
Q = v × B
(10)
The sliding conducting bar is composed of positive and negative charges, and each
experiences this force. The force per unit charge, as given by (10), is called the
motional electric ﬁeld intensity Em,
Em = v × B
(11)
If the moving conductor were lifted off the rails, this electric ﬁeld intensity would force
electrons to one end of the bar (the far end) until the static ﬁeld due to these charges
just balanced the ﬁeld induced by the motion of the bar. The resultant tangential
electric ﬁeld intensity would then be zero along the length of the bar.
The motional emf produced by the moving conductor is then
emf =

Em · dL =

(v × B) · dL
(12)
where the last integral may have a nonzero value only along that portion of the path
which is in motion, or along which v has some nonzero value. Evaluating the right
side of (12), we obtain

(v × B) · dL =
 0
d
νB dx = −Bνd
as before. This is the total emf, since B is not a function of time.
In the case of a conductor moving in a uniform constant magnetic ﬁeld, we may
therefore ascribe a motional electric ﬁeld intensity Em = v × B to every portion of
the moving conductor and evaluate the resultant emf by
emf =

E · dL =

Em · dL =

(v × B) · dL

If the magnetic ﬂux density is also changing with time, then we must include

Figure 9.2
An apparent increase in flux linkages does
not lead to an induced voltage when one part of a circuit
is simply substituted for another by opening the switch.
No indication will be observed on the voltmeter.
This expression is equivalent to the simple statement
emf = −d
dt
(1)
and either can be used to determine these induced voltages.
Although (1) appears simple, there are a few contrived examples in which its
proper application is quite difﬁcult. These usually involve sliding contacts or switches;
they always involve the substitution of one part of a circuit by a new part.4 As an
example, consider the simple circuit of Figure 9.2, which contains several perfectly
conducting wires, an ideal voltmeter, a uniform constant ﬁeld B, and a switch. When
the switch is opened, there is obviously more ﬂux enclosed in the voltmeter circuit;
however, it continues to read zero. The change in ﬂux has not been produced by either
a time-changing B [ﬁrst term of (14)] or a conductor moving through a magnetic ﬁeld
[second part of (14)]. Instead, a new circuit has been substituted for the old. Thus it
is necessary to use care in evaluating the change in ﬂux linkages.
The separation of the emf into the two parts indicated by (14), one due to the time
rate of change of B and the other to the motion of the circuit, is somewhat arbitrary
in that it depends on the relative velocity of the observer and the system. A ﬁeld that
is changing with both time and space may look constant to an observer moving with
the ﬁeld. This line of reasoning is developed more fully in applying the special theory
of relativity to electromagnetic theory.5

DISPLACEMENT CURRENT
Faraday’s experimental law has been used to obtain one of Maxwell’s equations in
differential form,
∇× E = −∂B
∂t
(15)
which shows us that a time-changing magnetic ﬁeld produces an electric ﬁeld. Re-
membering the deﬁnition of curl, we see that this electric ﬁeld has the special property
of circulation; its line integral about a general closed path is not zero. Now let us turn
our attention to the time-changing electric ﬁeld.
We should ﬁrst look at the point form of Amp`ere’s circuital law as it applies to
steady magnetic ﬁelds,
∇× H = J
(16)
and show its inadequacy for time-varying conditions by taking the divergence of each
side,
∇· ∇× H ≡0 = ∇· J
The divergence of the curl is identically zero, so ∇· J is also zero. However, the
equation of continuity,
∇· J = −∂ρν
∂t
then shows us that (16) can be true only if ∂ρν/∂t = 0. This is an unrealistic limitation,
and (16) must be amended before we can accept it for time-varying ﬁelds. Suppose
we add an unknown term G to (16),
∇× H = J + G
Again taking the divergence, we have
0 = ∇· J + ∇· G
Thus
∇· G = ∂ρν
∂t

CHAPTER 9
Time-Varying Fields and Maxwell’s Equations
285
Replacing ρν with ∇· D,
∇· G = ∂
∂t (∇· D) = ∇· ∂D

from which we obtain the simplest solution for G,
G = ∂D
∂t
Amp`ere’s circuital law in point form therefore becomes
∇× H = J + ∂D
∂t
(17)
Equation (17) has not been derived. It is merely a form we have obtained that
does not disagree with the continuity equation. It is also consistent with all our other
results, and we accept it as we did each experimental law and the equations derived
from it. We are building a theory, and we have every right to our equations until they
are proved wrong. This has not yet been done.
We now have a second one of Maxwell’s equations and shall investigate its sig-
niﬁcance. The additional term ∂D/∂t has the dimensions of current density, amperes
per square meter. Because it results from a time-varying electric ﬂux density (or dis-
placement density), Maxwell termed it a displacement current density. We sometimes
denote it by Jd:
∇× H = J + Jd
Jd = ∂D
∂t
This is the third type of current density we have met. Conduction current density,
J = σE
is the motion of charge (usually electrons) in a region of zero net charge density, and
convection current density,
J = ρνv
is the motion of volume charge density. Both are represented by J in (17). Bound
current density is, of course, included in H. In a nonconducting medium in which no
volume charge density is present, J = 0, and then
∇× H = ∂D

Again, the analogy between the intensity vectors E and H and the ﬂux density
vectors D and B is apparent. We cannot place too much faith in this analogy, however,
for it fails when we investigate forces on particles. The force on a charge is related to E

What is the nature of displacement current density? Let us study the simple circuit of

the loop, a magnetic ﬁeld varying sinusoidally with time is applied to produce an
emf about the closed path (the ﬁlament plus the dashed portion between the capacitor
plates), which we shall take as
emf = V0 cos ωt
Using elementary circuit theory and assuming that the loop has negligible resis-
tance and inductance, we may obtain the current in the loop as
I = −ωCV0 sin ωt
= −ωϵS
d V0 sin ωt
wherethequantitiesϵ, S,andd pertaintothecapacitor.LetusapplyAmp`ere’scircuital
law about the smaller closed circular path k and neglect displacement current for the
moment:

k
H · dL = Ik
The path and the value of H along the path are both deﬁnite quantities (although
difﬁcult to determine), and

k H · dL is a deﬁnite quantity. The current Ik is that
current through every surface whose perimeter is the path k. If we choose a sim-
ple surface punctured by the ﬁlament, such as the plane circular surface deﬁned by
the circular path k, the current is evidently the conduction current. Suppose now
we consider the closed path k as the mouth of a paper bag whose bottom passes
between the capacitor plates. The bag is not pierced by the ﬁlament, and the con-
ductor current is zero. Now we need to consider displacement current, for within the
capacitor
D = ϵE = ϵ
V0
d cos ωt

and therefore
Id = ∂D
∂t S = −ωϵS
d V0 sin ωt
This is the same value as that of the conduction current in the ﬁlamentary loop.
Therefore the application of Amp`ere’s circuital law, including displacement current
to the path k, leads to a deﬁnite value for the line integral of H. This value must be
equal to the total current crossing the chosen surface. For some surfaces the current
is almost entirely conduction current, but for those surfaces passing between the
capacitor plates, the conduction current is zero, and it is the displacement current
which is now equal to the closed line integral of H.
Physically, we should note that a capacitor stores charge and that the electric ﬁeld
between the capacitor plates is much greater than the small leakage ﬁelds outside.
We therefore introduce little error when we neglect displacement current on all those
surfaces which do not pass between the plates.
Displacement current is associated with time-varying electric ﬁelds and therefore
exists in all imperfect conductors carrying a time-varying conduction current. The last

MAXWELL’S EQUATIONS
IN POINT FORM
We have already obtained two of Maxwell’s equations for time-varying ﬁelds,
∇× E = −∂B
∂t
(20)
and
∇× H = J + ∂D
∂t
(21)
The remaining two equations are unchanged from their non-time-varying form:
∇· D = ρν
(22)
∇· B = 0
(23)
Equation (22) essentially states that charge density is a source (or sink) of electric
ﬂux lines. Note that we can no longer say that all electric ﬂux begins and terminates
on charge, because the point form of Faraday’s law (20) shows that E, and hence D,
may have circulation if a changing magnetic ﬁeld is present. Thus the lines of electric
ﬂux may form closed loops. However, the converse is still true, and every coulomb
of charge must have one coulomb of electric ﬂux diverging from it.
Equation (23) again acknowledges the fact that “magnetic charges,” or poles, are
not known to exist. Magnetic ﬂux is always found in closed loops and never diverges
from a point source.
These four equations form the basis of all electromagnetic theory. They are partial
differential equations and relate the electric and magnetic ﬁelds to each other and to

their sources, charge and current density. The auxiliary equations relating D and E,
D = ϵE

B = µH
(25)
deﬁning conduction current density,
J = σE
(26)
and deﬁning convection current density in terms of the volume charge density ρν,
J = ρνv
(27)
are also required to deﬁne and relate the quantities appearing in Maxwell’s equations.
The potentials V and A have not been included because they are not strictly
necessary, although they are extremely useful. They will be discussed at the end of
this chapter.
If we do not have “nice” materials to work with, then we should replace (24) and
(25) with the relationships involving the polarization and magnetization ﬁelds,
D = ϵ0E + P
(28)
B = µ0(H + M)
(29)
For linear materials we may relate P to E
P = χeϵ0E
(30)
and M to H
M = χmH
(31)
Finally, because of its fundamental importance we should include the Lorentz
force equation, written in point form as the force per unit volume,
f = ρν(E + v × B)
(32)
The following chapters are devoted to the application of Maxwell’s equations to
several simple problems.

MAXWELL’S EQUATIONS
IN INTEGRAL FORM
The integral forms of Maxwell’s equations are usually easier to recognize in terms of
theexperimentallawsfromwhichtheyhavebeenobtainedbyageneralizationprocess.
Experiments must treat physical macroscopic quantities, and their results therefore
are expressed in terms of integral relationships. A differential equation always rep-
resents a theory. Let us now collect the integral forms of Maxwell’s equations from
Section 9.3.
Integrating (20) over a surface and applying Stokes’ theorem, we obtain Faraday’s
law,

E · dL = −

S
∂B
∂t · dS
(33)
and the same process applied to (21) yields Amp`ere’s circuital law,

H · dL = I +

S
∂D
∂t · dS
(34)
Gauss’s laws for the electric and magnetic ﬁelds are obtained by integrating (22)
and (23) throughout a volume and using the divergence theorem:

S
D · dS =

vol
ρνdv
(35)

S
B · dS = 0
(36)
These four integral equations enable us to ﬁnd the boundary conditions on B, D, H,
and E, which are necessary to evaluate the constants obtained in solving Maxwell’s
equations in partial differential form. These boundary conditions are in general un-
changed from their forms for static or steady ﬁelds, and the same methods may be
used to obtain them. Between any two real physical media (where K must be zero on
the boundary surface), (33) enables us to relate the tangential E-ﬁeld components,
Et1 = Et2
(37)

CHAPTER 9
Time-Varying Fields and Maxwell’s Equations
291
and from (34),
Ht1 = Ht2
(38)
The surface integrals produce the boundary conditions on the normal components,
DN1 −DN2 = ρS
(39)
and
BN1 = BN2
(40)
Itisoftendesirabletoidealizeaphysicalproblembyassumingaperfectconductor
for which σ is inﬁnite but J is ﬁnite. From Ohm’s law, then, in a perfect conductor,
E = 0
and it follows from the point form of Faraday’s law that
H = 0
for time-varying ﬁelds. The point form of Amp`ere’s circuital law then shows that the
ﬁnite value of J is
J = 0
and current must be carried on the conductor surface as a surface current K. Thus, if
region 2 is a perfect conductor, (37) to (40) become, respectively,
Et1 = 0
(41)
Ht1 = K
(Ht1 = K × aN)
(42)
DN1 = ρs
(43)
BN1 = 0
(44)
where aN is an outward normal at the conductor surface.
Note that surface charge density is considered a physical possibility for either di-
electrics, perfect conductors, or imperfect conductors, but that surface current density
is assumed only in conjunction with perfect conductors.
The preceding boundary conditions are a very necessary part of Maxwell’s
equations. All real physical problems have boundaries and require the solution of
Maxwell’s equations in two or more regions and the matching of these solutions at
the boundaries. In the case of perfect conductors, the solution of the equations within
the conductor is trivial (all time-varying ﬁelds are zero), but the application of the
boundary conditions (41) to (44) may be very difﬁcult.
Certain fundamental properties of wave propagation are evident when Maxwell’s
equations are solved for an unbounded region. This problem is treated in Chapter 11.
It represents the simplest application of Maxwell’s equations because it is the only
problem which does not require the application of any boundary conditions.

9.5
THE RETARDED POTENTIALS
The time-varying potentials, usually called retarded potentials for a reason that we
will see shortly, ﬁnd their greatest application in radiation problems (to be addressed
in Chapter 14) in which the distribution of the source is known approximately. We
should remember that the scalar electric potential V may be expressed in terms of a
static charge distribution,
V =

vol
ρνdν
4πϵR
(static)
(45)
and the vector magnetic potential may be found from a current distribution which is
constant with time,
A =

vol
µJ dv
4πR
(dc)
(46)
The differential equations satisﬁed by V ,
∇2V = −ρν
ϵ
(static)
(47)
and A,
∇2A = −µJ
(dc)
(48)
mayberegardedasthepointformsoftheintegralequations(45)and(46),respectively.
Having found V and A, the fundamental ﬁelds are then simply obtained by using
the gradient,
E = −∇V
(static)
(49)
or the curl,
B = ∇× A
(dc)
(50)
We now wish to deﬁne suitable time-varying potentials which are consistent with
the preceding expressions when only static charges and direct currents are involved.
Equation (50) apparently is still consistent with Maxwell’s equations. These
equations state that ∇· B = 0, and the divergence of (50) leads to the divergence of

CHAPTER 9
Time-Varying Fields and Maxwell’s Equations
293
the curl that is identically zero. Let us therefore tentatively accept (50) as satisfactory
for time-varying ﬁelds and turn our attention to (49).
The inadequacy of (49) is obvious because application of the curl operation to
each side and recognition of the curl of the gradient as being identically zero confront
us with ∇× E = 0. However, the point form of Faraday’s law states that ∇× E is
not generally zero, so let us try to effect an improvement by adding an unknown term
to (49),
E = −∇V + N
taking the curl,
∇× E = 0 + ∇× N
using the point form of Faraday’s law,
∇× N = −∂B
∂t
and using (50), giving us
∇× N = −∂
∂t (∇× A)
or
∇× N = −∇× ∂A
∂t
The simplest solution of this equation is
N = −∂A
∂t
and this leads to
E = −∇V −∂A
∂t
(51)
We still must check (50) and (51) by substituting them into the remaining two of
Maxwell’s equations:
∇× H = J + ∂D
∂t
∇· D = ρν
Doing this, we obtain the more complicated expressions

and

(52)

and
∇2V + ∂
∂t (∇· A) = −ρν
ϵ
(53)
There is no apparent inconsistency in (52) and (53). Under static or dc conditions
∇· A = 0, and (52) and (53) reduce to (48) and (47), respectively. We will therefore
assume that the time-varying potentials may be deﬁned in such a way that B and
E may be obtained from them through (50) and (51). These latter two equations do
not serve, however, to deﬁne A and V completely. They represent necessary, but not
sufﬁcient, conditions. Our initial assumption was merely that B = ∇× A, and a
vector cannot be deﬁned by giving its curl alone. Suppose, for example, that we have
a very simple vector potential ﬁeld in which Ay and Az are zero. Expansion of (50)
leads to
Bx = 0
By = ∂Ax
∂z
Bz = −∂Ax
∂y
and we see that no information is available about the manner in which Ax varies with
x. This information could be found if we also knew the value of the divergence of A,
for in our example
∇· A = ∂Ax
∂x
Finally, we should note that our information about A is given only as partial derivatives
and that a space-constant term might be added. In all physical problems in which the
region of the solution extends to inﬁnity, this constant term must be zero, for there
can be no ﬁelds at inﬁnity.
Generalizing from this simple example, we may say that a vector ﬁeld is deﬁned
completely when both its curl and divergence are given and when its value is known at
any one point (including inﬁnity). We are therefore at liberty to specify the divergence
of A, and we do so with an eye on (52) and (53), seeking the simplest expressions.
We deﬁne
∇· A = −µϵ ∂V
∂t
(54)
and (52) and (53) become
∇2A = −µJ + µϵ ∂2A
∂t2
(55)
and
∇2V = −ρν
ϵ + µϵ ∂2V
∂t2
(56)
These equations are related to the wave equation, which will be discussed in
Chapters 10 and 11. They show considerable symmetry, and we should be highly

pleased with our deﬁnitions of V and A,
B = ∇× A
(50)
∇· A = −µϵ ∂V
∂t
(54)
E = −∇V −∂A
∂t
(51)
The integral equivalents of (45) and (46) for the time-varying potentials follow
from the deﬁnitions (50), (51), and (54), but we shall merely present the ﬁnal results
and indicate their general nature. In Chapter 11, we will ﬁnd that any electromagnetic
disturbance will travel at a velocity
ν =
1
√µϵ
through any homogeneous medium described by µ and ϵ. In the case of free space,
this velocity turns out to be the velocity of light, approximately 3 × 108 m/s. It is
logical, then, to suspect that the potential at any point is due not to the value of the
charge density at some distant point at the same instant, but to its value at some
previous time, because the effect propagates at a ﬁnite velocity. Thus (45) becomes
V =

vol
[ρν]
4πϵR dν
(57)
where [ρν] indicates that every t appearing in the expression for ρν has been replaced
by a retarded time,
t′ = t −R
ν
Thus, if the charge density throughout space were given by
ρν = e−r cos ωt
then
[ρν] = e−r cos

where R is the distance between the differential element of charge being considered
and the point at which the potential is to be determined.

(58)
The use of a retarded time has resulted in the time-varying potentials being given
the nameofretardedpotentials.InChapter14wewillapply(58)tothesimplesituation

simpleapplicationsof(58)areconsideredinseveralproblemsattheendofthischapter.

296
ENGINEERING ELECTROMAGNETICS
We may summarize the use of the potentials by stating that a knowledge of the
distribution of ρν and J throughout space theoretically enables us to determine V and
A from (57) and (58). The electric and magnetic ﬁelds are then obtained by applying
(50) and (51). If the charge and current distributions are unknown, or reasonable
approximations cannot be made for them, these potentials usually offer no easier path
toward the solution than does the direct application of Maxwell’s equations.

Transmission Lines
T
ransmission lines are used to transmit electric energy and signals from one
point to another, speciﬁcally from a source to a load. Examples include the
connection between a transmitter and an antenna, connections between com-
puters in a network, or connections between a hydroelectric generating plant and a
substation several hundred miles away. Other familiar examples include the intercon-
nects between components of a stereo system and the connection between a cable
service provider and your television set. Examples that are less familiar include the
connections between devices on a circuit board that are designed to operate at high
frequencies.
What all of these examples have in common is that the devices to be connected
are separated by distances on the order of a wavelength or much larger, whereas in
basic circuit analysis methods, connections between elements are assumed to have
negligible length. The latter condition enabled us, for example, to take for granted
that the voltage across a resistor on one side of a circuit was exactly in phase with
the voltage source on the other side, or, more generally, that the time measured at
the source location is precisely the same time as measured at all other points in the
circuit. When distances are sufﬁciently large between source and receiver, time delay
effects become appreciable, leading to delay-induced phase differences. In short, we
deal with wave phenomena on transmission lines in the same manner that we deal
with point-to-point energy propagation in free space or in dielectrics.
The basic elements in a circuit, such as resistors, capacitors, inductors, and the
connections between them, are considered lumped elements if the time delay in
traversing the elements is negligible. On the other hand, if the elements or inter-
connections are large enough, it may be necessary to consider them as distributed
elements. This means that their resistive, capacitive, and inductive characteristics
must be evaluated on a per-unit-distance basis. Transmission lines have this prop-
erty in general, and thus they become circuit elements in themselves, possessing
impedances that contribute to the circuit problem. The basic rule is that one must
consider elements as distributed if the propagation delay across the element dimen-
sion is on the order of the shortest time interval of interest. In the time-harmonic case,
301

302

this condition would lead to a measurable phase difference between each end of the
device in question.
In this chapter, we investigate wave phenomena in transmission lines. Our
objectives include (1) to understand how to treat transmission lines as circuit elements
possessing complex impedances that are functions of line length and frequency, (2) to
understand wave propagation on lines, including cases in which losses may occur,
(3) to learn methods of combining different transmission lines to accomplish a desired
objective, and (4) to understand transient phenomena on lines. ■
10.1
PHYSICAL DESCRIPTION OF
TRANSMISSION LINE PROPAGATION
To obtain a feel for the manner in which waves propagate on transmission lines,
the following demonstration may be helpful. Consider a lossless line, as shown in
Figure 10.1. By lossless, we mean that all power that is launched into the line at the
input end eventually arrives at the output end. A battery having voltage V0 is con-
nected to the input by closing switch S1 at time t = 0. When the switch is closed, the
effect is to launch voltage, V + = V0. This voltage does not instantaneously appear
everywhere on the line, but rather begins to travel from the battery toward the load
resistor, R, at a certain velocity. The wavefront, represented by the vertical dashed
line in Figure 10.1, represents the instantaneous boundary between the section of the
line that has been charged to V0 and the remaining section that is yet to be charged.
It also represents the boundary between the section of the line that carries the charg-
ing current, I +, and the remaining section that carries no current. Both current and
voltage are discontinuous across the wavefront.
As the line charges, the wavefront moves from left to right at velocity ν, which
is to be determined. On reaching the far end, all or a fraction of the wave voltage
and current will reﬂect, depending on what the line is attached to. For example, if
the resistor at the far end is left disconnected (switch S2 is open), then all of the
wavefront voltage will be reﬂected. If the resistor is connected, then some fraction
of the incident voltage will reﬂect. The details of this will be treated in Section 10.9.
Of interest at the moment are the factors that determine the wave velocity. The key

to understanding and quantifying this is to note that the conducting transmission line
will possess capacitance and inductance that are expressed on a per-unit-length basis.
We have already derived expressions for these and evaluated them in Chapters 6 and
8 for certain transmission line geometries. Knowing these line characteristics, we can
construct a model for the transmission line using lumped capacitors and inductors, as
shown in Figure 10.2. The ladder network thus formed is referred to as a pulse-forming
network, for reasons that will soon become clear.1
Consider now what happens when connecting the same switched voltage source
to the network. Referring to Figure 10.2, on closing the switch at the battery location,
current begins to increase in L1, allowing C1 to charge. As C1 approaches full charge,
current in L2 begins to increase, allowing C2 to charge next. This progressive charging
process continues down the network, until all three capacitors are fully charged. In the
network, a “wavefront” location can be identiﬁed as the point between two adjacent
capacitors that exhibit the most difference between their charge levels. As the charging
process continues, the wavefront moves from left to right. Its speed depends on how
fast each inductor can reach its full-current state and, simultaneously, by how fast
each capacitor is able to charge to full voltage. The wave is faster if the values of Li
and Ci are lower. We therefore expect the wave velocity to be inversely proportional
to a function involving the product of inductance and capacitance. In the lossless
transmission line, it turns out (as will be shown) that the wave velocity is given by
ν = 1/
√
LC, where L and C are speciﬁed per unit length.
Similar behavior is seen in the line and network when either is initially charged. In
this case, the battery remains connected, and a resistor can be connected (by a switch)
across the output end, as shown in Figure 10.2. In the case of the ladder network,
the capacitor nearest the shunted end (C3) will discharge through the resistor ﬁrst,
followed by the next-nearest capacitor, and so on. When the network is completely
discharged, a voltage pulse has been formed across the resistor, and so we see why this
ladder conﬁguration is called a pulse-forming network. Essentially identical behavior
is seen in a charged transmission line when connecting a resistor between conductors
at the output end. The switched voltage exercises, as used in these discussions, are ex-
amples of transient problems on transmission lines. Transients will be treated in detail
in Section 10.14. In the beginning, line responses to sinusoidal signals are emphasized.
1 Designs and applications of pulse-forming networks are discussed in Reference 1.

304
ENGINEERING ELECTROMAGNETICS
Finally, we surmise that the existence of voltage and current across and within the
transmission line conductors implies the existence of electric and magnetic ﬁelds in
the space around the conductors. Consequently, we have two possible approaches to
the analysis of transmission lines: (1) We can solve Maxwell’s equations subject to the
line conﬁguration to obtain the ﬁelds, and with these ﬁnd general expressions for the
wave power, velocity, and other parameters of interest. (2) Or we can (for now) avoid
the ﬁelds and solve for the voltage and current using an appropriate circuit model. It is
the latter approach that we use in this chapter; the contribution of ﬁeld theory is solely
in the prior (and assumed) evaluation of the inductance and capacitance parameters.
We will ﬁnd, however, that circuit models become inconvenient or useless when
losses in transmission lines are to be fully characterized, or when analyzing more
complicated wave behavior (i.e., moding) which may occur as frequencies get high.

10.2
THE TRANSMISSION LINE EQUATIONS
Our ﬁrst goal is to obtain the differential equations, known as the wave equations,
which the voltage or current must satisfy on a uniform transmission line. To do this,
we construct a circuit model for an incremental length of line, write two circuit
equations, and use these to obtain the wave equations.
Our circuit model contains the primary constants of the transmission line. These
include the inductance, L, and capacitance, C, as well as the shunt conductance, G,
and series resistance, R—all of which have values that are speciﬁed per unit length.
The shunt conductance is used to model leakage current through the dielectric that
may occur throughout the line length; the assumption is that the dielectric may possess
conductivity, σd, in addition to a dielectric constant, ϵr, where the latter affects the
capacitance. The series resistance is associated with any ﬁnite conductivity, σc, in
the conductors. Either one of the latter parameters, R and G, will be responsible for
power loss in transmission. In general, both are functions of frequency. Knowing the
frequency and the dimensions, we can determine the values of R, G, L, and C by
using formulas developed in earlier chapters.
We assume propagation in the az direction. Our model consists of a line section
of length z containing resistance Rz, inductance Lz, conductance Gz, and
capacitance Cz, as indicated in Figure 10.3. Because the section of the line looks
the same from either end, we divide the series elements in half to produce a symmet-
rical network. We could equally well have placed half the conductance and half the
capacitance at each end.
Our objective is to determine the manner and extent to which the output voltage
and current are changed from their input values in the limit as the length approaches
a very small value. We will consequently obtain a pair of differential equations that
describe the rates of change of voltage and current with respect to z. In Figure 10.3,
theinputandoutputvoltagesandcurrentsdifferrespectivelybyquantitiesV andI,
which are to be determined. The two equations are obtained by successive applications
of Kirchoff’s voltage law (KVL) and Kirchoff’s current law (KCL).

First, KVL is applied to the loop that encompasses the entire section length, as
shown in Figure 10.3:

The coupled differential equations, (5) and (8), describe the evolution of current
and voltage in any transmission line. Historically, they have been referred to as the
telegraphist’s equations. Their solution leads to the wave equation for the transmission
line, which we now undertake. We begin by differentiating Eq. (5) with respect to z
and Eq. (8) with respect to t, obtaining:

∂z −L ∂2I

(9)
and
∂I
∂z∂t = −G ∂V

(10)
Next, Eqs. (8) and (10) are substituted into (9). After rearranging terms, the result is:
∂2V
∂z2 = LC ∂2V
∂t2 + (LG + RC)∂V
∂t + RGV
(11)
An analogous procedure involves differentiating Eq. (5) with respect to t and Eq. (8)
with respect to z. Then, Eq. (5) and its derivative are substituted into the derivative of
(8) to obtain an equation for the current that is in identical form to that of (11):
∂2I
∂z2 = LC ∂2I
∂t2 + (LG + RC)∂I
∂t + RGI
(12)
Equations (11) and (12) are the general wave equations for the transmission line.
Their solutions under various conditions form a major part of our study.
10.3
LOSSLESS PROPAGATION
Lossless propagation means that power is not dissipated or otherwise deviated as the
wave travels down the transmission line; all power at the input end eventually reaches
the output end. More realistically, any mechanisms that would cause losses to occur
have negligible effect. In our model, lossless propagation occurs when R = G = 0.

CHAPTER 10

Under this condition, only the ﬁrst term on the right-hand side of either Eq. (11) or
Eq. (12) survives. Eq. (11), for example, becomes
∂2V
∂z2 = LC ∂2V
∂t2
(13)
In considering the voltage function that will satisfy (13), it is most expedient to
simply state the solution, and then show that it is correct. The solution of (13) is of
the form:
V (z, t) = f1

t −z
ν

+ f2

t + z
ν

= V + + V −
(14)
where ν, the wave velocity, is a constant. The expressions (t ± z/ν) are the arguments
of functions f1 and f2. The identities of the functions themselves are not critical to
the solution of (13). Therefore, f1 and f2 can be any function.
The arguments of f1 and f2 indicate, respectively, travel of the functions in the
forward and backward z directions. We assign the symbols V + and V −to identify
the forward and backward voltage wave components. To understand the behavior,
consider for example the value of f1 (whatever this might be) at the zero value of its
argument, occurring when z = t = 0. Now, as time increases to positive values (as
it must), and if we are to keep track of f1(0), then the value of z must also increase
to keep the argument (t −z/ν) equal to zero. The function f1 therefore moves (or
propagates) in the positive z direction. Using similar reasoning, the function f2 will
propagate in the negative z direction, as z in the argument (t + z/ν) must decrease to
offset the increase in t. Therefore we associate the argument (t −z/ν) with forward
z propagation, and the argument (t + z/ν) with backward z travel. This behavior
occurs irrespective of what f1 and f2 are. As is evident in the argument forms, the
propagation velocity is ν in both cases.
We next verify that functions having the argument forms expressed in (14) are
solutions to (13). First, we take partial derivatives of f1, for example with respect to
z and t. Using the chain rule, the z partial derivative is
∂f1
∂z =
∂f1
∂(t −z/ν)
∂(t −z/ν)

(15)
where it is apparent that the primed function, f ′

respect to its argument. The partial derivative with respect to time is
∂f1
∂t =
∂f1
∂(t −z/ν)
∂(t −z/ν)

(16)
Next, the second partial derivatives with respect to z and t can be taken using similar
reasoning:

(17) can now be substituted into (13), obtaining

(18)
We now identify the wave velocity for lossless propagation, which is the condition
for equality in (18):
ν =

√

(19)
Performing the same procedure using f2 (and its argument) leads to the same expres-
sion for ν.
The form of ν as expressed in Eq. (19) conﬁrms our original expectation that the
wave velocity would be in some inverse proportion to L and C. The same result will
be true for current, as Eq. (12) under lossless conditions would lead to a solution of
the form identical to that of (14), with velocity given by (19). What is not known yet,
however, is the relation between voltage and current.
We have already found that voltage and current are related through the tele-
graphist’s equations, (5) and (8). These, under lossless conditions (R = G = 0),
become

∂z = −L ∂I

(20)

Using the voltage function, we can substitute (14) into (20) and use the methods

(23)
In performing this integration, all integration constants are set to zero. The reason
for this, as demonstrated by (20) and (21), is that a time-varying voltage must lead
to a time-varying current, with the reverse also true. The factor 1/Lν appearing
in (23) multiplies voltage to obtain current, and so we identify the product Lν as
the characteristic impedance, Z0, of the lossless line. Z0 is deﬁned as the ratio of

By inspecting (14) and (23), we now note that
V + = Z0I +

and
V −= −Z0I −
(25b)
The signiﬁcance of the preceding relations can be seen in Figure 10.4. The ﬁgure
shows forward- and backward-propagating voltage waves, V + and V −, both of which
have positive polarity. The currents that are associated with these voltages will ﬂow in
opposite directions. We deﬁne positive current as having a clockwise ﬂow in the line,
and negative current as having a counterclockwise ﬂow. The minus sign in (25b) thus
assures that negative current will be associated with a backward-propagating wave
that has positive polarity. This is a general convention, applying to lines with losses
also. Propagation with losses is studied by solving (11) under the assumption that
either R or G (or both) are not zero. We will do this in Section 10.7 under the special
case of sinusoidal voltages and currents. Sinusoids in lossless transmission lines are
considered in Section 10.4.
10.4
LOSSLESS PROPAGATION
OF SINUSOIDAL VOLTAGES
An understanding of sinusoidal waves on transmission lines is important because any
signal that is transmitted in practice can be decomposed into a discrete or continuous
summation of sinusoids. This is the basis of frequency domain analysis of signals on

310
ENGINEERING ELECTROMAGNETICS
lines. In such studies, the effect of the transmission line on any signal can be deter-
mined by noting the effects on the frequency components. This means that one can
effectively propagate the spectrum of a given signal, using frequency-dependent line
parameters, and then reassemble the frequency components into the resultant signal in
time domain. Our objective in this section is to obtain an understanding of sinusoidal
propagation and the implications on signal behavior for the lossless line case.
We begin by assigning sinusoidal functions to the voltage functions in Eq. (14).
Speciﬁcally, we consider a speciﬁc frequency, f = ω/2π, and write f1 = f2 =
V0 cos(ωt + φ). By convention, the cosine function is chosen; the sine is obtainable,
as we know, by setting φ = −π/2. We next replace t with (t ± z/νp), obtaining
V(z, t) = |V0| cos[ω(t ± z/νp) + φ] = |V0| cos[ωt ± βz + φ]
(26)
where we have assigned a new notation to the velocity, which is now called the phase
velocity, νp. This is applicable to a pure sinusoid (having a single frequency) and will
be found to depend on frequency in some cases. Choosing, for the moment, φ = 0,
we obtain the two possibilities of forward or backward z travel by choosing the minus
or plus sign in (26). The two cases are:
V f (z, t) = |V0| cos(ωt −βz)
(forward z propagation)
(27a)
and
Vb(z, t) = |V0| cos(ωt + βz)
(backward z propagation)
(27b)
where the magnitude factor, |V0|, is the value of V at z = 0, t = 0. We deﬁne the
phase constant β, obtained from (26), as
β ≡ω
νp
(28)
We refer to the solutions expressed in (27a) and (27b) as the real instantaneous
forms of the transmission-line voltage. They are the mathematical representations of
what one would experimentally measure. The terms ωt and βz, appearing in these
equations, have units of angle and are usually expressed in radians. We know that ω
is the radian time frequency, measuring phase shift per unit time, and it has units of
rad/s. In a similar way, we see that β will be interpreted as a spatial frequency, which
in the present case measures the phase shift per unit distance along the z direction.
Its units are rad/m. If we were to ﬁx the time at t = 0, Eqs. (27a) and (27b) would
become
V f (z, 0) = Vb(z, 0) = |V0| cos(βz)
(29)
which we identify as a simple periodic function that repeats every incremental dis-
tance λ, known as the wavelength. The requirement is that βλ = 2π, and so
λ = 2π
β = νp
f
(30)

CHAPTER 10

We next consider a point (such as a wave crest) on the cosine function of Eq. (27a),
the occurrence of which requires the argument of the cosine to be an integer multiple
of 2π. Considering the mth crest of the wave, the condition at t = 0 becomes
βz = 2mπ
To keep track of this point on the wave, we require that the entire cosine argument be
the same multiple of 2π for all time. From (27a) the condition becomes
ωt −βz = ω(t −z/νp) = 2mπ
(31)
Again, with increasing time, the position z must also increase in order to satisfy (31).
Consequently the wave crest (and the entire wave) travels in the positive z direction
at velocity νp. Eq. (27b), having cosine argument (ωt + βz), describes a wave that
travels in the negative z direction, since as time increases, z must now decrease
to keep the argument constant. Similar behavior is found for the wave current, but
complications arise from line-dependent phase differences that occur between current
and voltage. These issues are best addressed once we are familiar with complex
analysis of sinusoidal signals.
10.5
COMPLEX ANALYSIS
OF SINUSOIDAL WAVES
Expressing sinusoidal waves as complex functions is useful (and essentially indis-
pensable) because it greatly eases the evaluation and visualization of phase that will
be found to accumulate by way of many mechanisms. In addition, we will ﬁnd many
cases in which two or more sinusoidal waves must be combined to form a resultant
wave—a task made much easier if complex analysis is used.
Expressing sinusoidal functions in complex form is based on the Euler identity:
e± jx = cos(x) ± j sin(x)
(32)
from which we may write the cosine and sine, respectively, as the real and imaginary
parts of the complex exponent:
cos(x) = Re[e± jx] = 1
2(e jx + e−jx) = 1
2e jx + c.c.
(33a)
sin(x) = ±Im[e± jx] = 1
2 j (e jx −e−jx) = 1
2 j e jx + c.c.
(33b)
where j ≡
√−1, and where c.c. denotes the complex conjugate of the preceding
term. The conjugate is formed by changing the sign of j wherever it appears in the
complex expression.
We may next apply (33a) to our voltage wave function, Eq. (26):
V(z, t) = |V0| cos[ωt ± βz + φ] = 1
2 (|V0|e jφ)

	

V0
e± jβze jωt + c.c.
(34)
Note that we have arranged the phases in (34) such that we identify the complex
amplitude of the wave as V0 = (|V0|e jφ). In future usage, a single symbol (V0 in the

312
ENGINEERING ELECTROMAGNETICS
present example) will usually be used for the voltage or current amplitudes, with the
understanding that these will generally be complex (having magnitude and phase).
Two additional deﬁnitions follow from Eq. (34). First, we deﬁne the complex
instantaneous voltage as:
Vc(z, t) = V0e± jβze jωt
(35)
The phasor voltage is then formed by dropping the e jωt factor from the complex
instantaneous form:
Vs(z) = V0e± jβz
(36)
The phasor voltage can be deﬁned provided we have sinusoidal steady-state
conditions—meaning that V0 is independent of time. This has in fact been our assump-
tion all along, because a time-varying amplitude would imply the existence of other
frequency components in our signal. Again, we are treating only a single-frequency
wave. The signiﬁcance of the phasor voltage is that we are effectively letting time
stand still and observing the stationary wave in space at t = 0. The processes of
evaluating relative phases between various line positions and of combining multiple
waves is made much simpler in phasor form. Again, this works only if all waves under
consideration have the same frequency. With the deﬁnitions in (35) and (36), the real
instantaneous voltage can be constructed using (34):
V(z, t) = |V0| cos[ωt ± βz + φ] = Re[Vc(z, t)] = 1
2Vc + c.c.
(37a)
Or, in terms of the phasor voltage:
V(z, t) = |V0| cos[ωt ± βz + φ] = Re[Vs(z)e jωt] = 1
2Vs(z)e jωt + c.c.
(37b)
In words, we may obtain our real sinusoidal voltage wave by multiplying the phasor
voltage by e jωt (reincorporating the time dependence) and then taking the real part of
the resulting expression. It is imperative that one becomes familiar with these relations
and their meaning before proceeding further.
EXAMPLE 10.1
Two voltage waves having equal frequencies and amplitudes propagate in opposite
directions on a lossless transmission line. Determine the total voltage as a function
of time and position.
Solution. Because the waves have the same frequency, we can write their combina-
tion using their phasor forms. Assuming phase constant, β, and real amplitude, V0,
the two wave voltages combine in this way:
VsT (z) = V0e−jβz + V0e+ jβz = 2V0 cos(βz)

CHAPTER 10
Transmission Lines
313
In real instantaneous form, this becomes
V(z, t) = Re[2V0 cos(βz)e jωt] = 2V0 cos(βz) cos(ωt)
We recognize this as a standing wave, in which the amplitude varies, as cos(βz), and
oscillates in time, as cos(ωt). Zeros in the amplitude (nulls) occur at ﬁxed locations,
zn = (mπ)/(2β) where m is an odd integer. We extend the concept in Section 10.10,
where we explore the voltage standing wave ratio as a measurement technique.
10.6
TRANSMISSION LINE EQUATIONS AND
THEIR SOLUTIONS IN PHASOR FORM
We now apply our results of the previous section to the transmission line equations,
beginning with the general wave equation, (11). This is rewritten as follows, for the
real instantaneous voltage, V(z, t):
∂2V
∂z2 = LC ∂2V
∂t2 + (LG + RC)∂V
∂t + RGV
(38)
We next substitute V(z, t) as given by the far right-hand side of (37b), noting that
the complex conjugate term (c.c.) will form a separate redundant equation. We also
use the fact that the operator ∂/∂t, when applied to the complex form, is equivalent
to multiplying by a factor of jω. After substitution, and after all time derivatives are
taken, the factor e jωt divides out. We are left with the wave equation in terms of the
phasor voltage:
d2Vs
dz2 = −ω2LCVs + jω(LG + RC)Vs + RGVs
(39)
Rearranging terms leads to the simpliﬁed form:
d2Vs
dz2 = (R + jωL)

	

Z
(G + jωC)

	

Y
Vs = γ 2Vs
(40)
where Z and Y, as indicated, are respectively the net series impedance and the net
shunt admittance in the transmission line—both as per-unit-distance measures. The
propagation constant in the line is deﬁned as
γ =

(R + jωL)(G + jωC) =
√
ZY = α + jβ
(41)
The signiﬁcance of the term will be explained in Section 10.7. For our immediate
purposes, the solution of (40) will be
Vs(z) = V +
0 e−γ z + V −
0 e+γ z
(42a)

314
ENGINEERING ELECTROMAGNETICS
The wave equation for current will be identical in form to (40). We therefore expect
the phasor current to be in the form:
Is(z) = I +
0 e−γ z + I −
0 eγ z
(42b)
The relation between the current and voltage waves is now found, as before,
through the telegraphist’s equations, (5) and (8). In a manner consistent with Eq. (37b),
we write the sinusoidal current as
I(z, t) = |I0| cos(ωt ± βz + ξ) = 1
2 (|I0|e jξ)
 	
 
I0
e± jβze jωt + c.c. = 1
2 Is(z)e jωt + c.c.
(43)
Substituting the far right-hand sides of (37b) and (43) into (5) and (8) transforms the
latter equations as follows:

We can now substitute (42a) and (42b) into either (44a) or (44b) [we will use (44a)]
to ﬁnd:
−γ V +
0 e−γ z + γ V −
0 eγ z = −Z(I +
0 e−γ z + I −
0 eγ z)
(45)
Next, equating coefﬁcients of e−γ z and eγ z, we ﬁnd the general expression for the

Incorporating the expressions for Z and Y, we ﬁnd the characteristic impedance in
terms of our known line parameters:
Z0 =

G + jωC = |Z0|e jθ
(47)
Note that with the voltage and current as given in (37b) and (43), we would identify
the phase of the characteristic impedance, θ = φ −ξ.
EXAMPLE 10.2
A lossless transmission line is 80 cm long and operates at a frequency of 600 MHz.
The line parameters are L = 0.25 µH/m and C = 100 pF/m. Find the characteristic

10.7
LOW-LOSS PROPAGATION
Having obtained the phasor forms of voltage and current in a general transmission
line [Eqs. (42a) and (42b)], we can now look more closely at the signiﬁcance of these
results. First we incorporate (41) into (42a) to obtain
Vs(z) = V +
0 e−αze−jβz + V −
0 eαze jβz
(48)
Next, multiplying (48) by e jωt and taking the real part gives the real instantaneous
voltage:
V(z, t) = V +
0 e−αz cos(ωt −βz) + V −
0 eαz cos(ωt + βz)
(49)
In this exercise, we have assigned V +
0 and V −
0 to be real. Eq. (49) is recognized
as describing forward- and backward-propagating waves that diminish in amplitude
with distance according to e−αz for the forward wave, and eαz for the backward wave.
Both waves are said to attenuate with propagation distance at a rate determined by
the attenuation coefﬁcient, α, expressed in units of nepers/m [Np/m].2
The phase constant, β, found by taking the imaginary part of (41), is likely to be a
somewhat complicated function, and will in general depend on R and G. Nevertheless,
β is still deﬁned as the ratio ω/νp, and the wavelength is still deﬁned as the distance
that provides a phase shift of 2π rad, so that λ = 2π/β. By inspecting (41), we
observe that losses in propagation are avoided (or α = 0) only when R = G = 0. In
that case, (41) gives γ = jβ = jω
√
LC, and so νp = 1/
√
LC, as we found before.
Expressions for α and β when losses are small can be readily obtained from (41).
In the low-loss approximation, we require R ≪ωL and G ≪ωC, a condition that
2 The term neper was selected (by some poor speller) to honor John Napier, a Scottish mathematician
who ﬁrst proposed the use of logarithms.

316

is often true in practice. Before we apply these conditions, Eq. (41) can be written in
the form:

We note that α scales in direct proportion to R and G, as would be expected. We
also note that the terms in (54b) that involve R and G lead to a phase velocity,
νp = ω/β, that is frequency-dependent. Moreover, the group velocity, νg = dω/dβ,
will also depend on frequency, and will lead to signal distortion, as we will explore in
Chapter 12. Note that with nonzero R and G, phase and group velocities that are
constant with frequency can be obtained when R/L = G/C, known as Heaviside’s
condition. In this case, (54b) becomes β .= ω
√
LC, and the line is said to be distor-
tionless. Further complications occur when accounting for possible frequency depen-
dencies within R, G, L, andC. Consequently, conditions of low-loss or distortion-free
propagation will usually occur over limited frequency ranges. As a rule, loss increases
with increasing frequency, mostly because of the increase in R with frequency. The
nature of this latter effect, known as skin effect loss, requires ﬁeld theory to understand

and quantify. We will study this in Chapter 11, and we will apply it to transmission
line structures in Chapter 13.
Finally, we can apply the low-loss approximation to the characteristic impedance,
Eq. (47). Using (51), we ﬁnd

(55)
Next, we multiply (55) by a factor of 1, in the form of the complex conjugate of
the denominator of (55) divided by itself. The resulting expression is simpliﬁed by
neglecting all terms on the order of R2G, G2R, and higher. Additionally, the approx-

POWER TRANSMISSION AND THE USE
OF DECIBELS IN LOSS
CHARACTERIZATION
Having found the sinusoidal voltage and current in a lossy transmission line, we next
evaluate the power transmitted over a speciﬁed distance as a function of voltage and
current amplitudes. We start with the instantaneous power, given simply as the product
of the real voltage and current. Consider the forward-propagating term in (49), where

318
ENGINEERING ELECTROMAGNETICS
again, the amplitude, V +
0 = |V0|, is taken to be real. The current waveform will be
similar, but will generally be shifted in phase. Both current and voltage attenuate
according to the factor e−αz. The instantaneous power therefore becomes:
P(z, t) = V(z, t)I(z, t) = |V0||I0|e−2αz cos(ωt −βz) cos(ωt −βz + θ)
(57)
Usually, the time-averaged power, ⟨P⟩, is of interest. We ﬁnd this through:
⟨P⟩= 1
T
 T
0
|V0||I0|e−2αz cos(ωt −βz) cos(ωt −βz + θ)dt
(58)
where T = 2π/ω is the time period for one oscillation cycle. Using a trigonometric
identity, the product of cosines in the integrand can be written as the sum of individual
cosines at the sum and difference frequencies:
⟨P⟩= 1
T
 T
0
1
2|V0||I0|e−2αz[cos(2ωt −2βz + θ) + cos(θ)] dt
(59)
The ﬁrst cosine term integrates to zero, leaving the cos θ term. The remaining integral
easily evaluates as
⟨P⟩= 1
2|V0||I0|e−2αz cos θ = 1
2
|V0|2
|Z0| e−2αz cos θ [W]
(60)
The same result can be obtained directly from the phasor voltage and current. We
begin with these, expressed as
Vs(z) = V0e−αze−jβz
(61)
and
Is(z) = I0e−αze−jβz = V0
Z0
e−αze−jβz
(62)
where Z0 = |Z0|e jθ. We now note that the time-averaged power as expressed in (60)
can be obtained from the phasor forms through:
⟨P⟩= 1
2Re{Vs I ∗
s }
(63)
where again, the asterisk (∗) denotes the complex conjugate (applied in this case to
the current phasor only). Using (61) and (62) in (63), it is found that

which we note is identical to the time-integrated result in (60). Eq. (63) applies to any
single-frequency wave.

CHAPTER 10
Transmission Lines
319
An important result of the preceding exercise is that power attenuates as e−2αz, or
⟨P(z)⟩= ⟨P(0)⟩e−2αz
(65)
Power drops at twice the exponential rate with distance as either voltage or current.
A convenient measure of power loss is in decibel units. This is based on express-
ing the power decrease as a power of 10. Speciﬁcally, we write
⟨P(z)⟩
⟨P(0)⟩= e−2αz = 10−καz
(66)
where the constant, κ, is to be determined. Setting αz = 1, we ﬁnd
e−2 = 10−κ
⇒
κ = log10(e2) = 0.869
(67)
Now, by deﬁnition, the power loss in decibels (dB) is
Power loss (dB) = 10 log10
⟨P(0)⟩
⟨P(z)⟩

= 8.69αz
(68)
where we note that inverting the power ratio in the argument of the log function [as
compared to the ratio in (66)] yields a positive number for the dB loss. Also, noting
that ⟨P⟩∝|V0|2, we may write, equivalently:
Power loss (dB) = 10 log10
⟨P(0)⟩
⟨P(z)⟩

= 20 log10

where |V0(z)| = |V0(0)|e−αz.
EXAMPLE 10.4
A 20-m length of transmission line is known to produce a 2.0-dB drop in power from
end to end. (a) What fraction of the input power reaches the output? (b) What fraction
of the input power reaches the midpoint of the line? (c) What exponential attenuation
coefﬁcient, α, does this represent?
Solution. (a) The power fraction will be
⟨P(20)⟩
⟨P(0)⟩= 10−0.2 = 0.63
(b) 2 dB in 20 m implies a loss rating of 0.2 dB/m. So, over a 10-m span, the loss
is 1.0 dB. This represents the power fraction, 10−0.1 = 0.79.
(c) The exponential attenuation coefﬁcient is found through
α =
2.0 dB
(8.69 dB/Np)(20 m) = 0.012 [Np/m]
A ﬁnal point addresses the question: Why use decibels? The most compelling
reason is that when evaluating the accumulated loss for several lines and devices that

320
ENGINEERING ELECTROMAGNETICS
are all end-to-end connected, the net loss in dB for the entire span is just the sum of
the dB losses of the individual elements.
D10.2. Two transmission lines are to be joined end to end. Line 1 is 30 m
long and is rated at 0.1 dB/m. Line 2 is 45 m long and is rated at 0.15 dB/m.
The joint is not done well and imparts a 3-dB loss. What percentage of the input
power reaches the output of the combination?
Ans. 5.3%
10.9
WAVE REFLECTION
AT DISCONTINUITIES
The concept of wave reﬂection was introduced in Section 10.1. As implied there,
the need for a reﬂected wave originates from the necessity to satisfy all voltage
and current boundary conditions at the ends of transmission lines and at locations
at which two dissimilar lines are connected to each other. The consequences of re-
ﬂected waves are usually less than desirable, in that some of the power that was
intended to be transmitted to a load, for example, reﬂects and propagates back to
the source. Conditions for achieving no reﬂected waves are therefore important to
understand.
The basic reﬂection problem is illustrated in Figure 10.5. In it, a transmission line
of characteristic impedance Z0 is terminated by a load having complex impedance,
ZL = RL + j X L. If the line is lossy, then we know that Z0 will also be complex. For
convenience, we assign coordinates such that the load is at location z = 0. Therefore,
the line occupies the region z < 0. A voltage wave is presumed to be incident on the
load, and is expressed in phasor form for all z:
Vi(z) = V0ie−αze−jβz
(70a)
When the wave reaches the load, a reﬂected wave is generated that back-propagates:
Vr(z) = V0re+αze+ jβz

The phasor voltage at the load is now the sum of the incident and reﬂected voltage
phasors, evaluated at z = 0:

(73)
where we emphasize the complex nature of —meaning that, in general, a reﬂected
wave will experience a reduction in amplitude and a phase shift, relative to the inci-
dent wave.
Now, using (71) with (73), we may write
VL = V0i + V0i
(74)
from which we ﬁnd the transmission coefﬁcient, deﬁned as the ratio of the load voltage
amplitude to the incident voltage amplitude:
τ ≡VL
V0i
= 1 +  =
2ZL
Z0 + ZL
= |τ|e jφt
(75)
A point that may at ﬁrst cause some alarm is that if  is a positive real number,
then τ > 1; the voltage amplitude at the load is thus greater than the incident voltage.
Although this would seem counterintuitive, it is not a problem because the load current
will be lower than that in the incident wave. We will ﬁnd that this always results in
an average power at the load that is less than or equal to that in the incident wave.
An additional point concerns the possibility of loss in the line. The incident wave
amplitude that is used in (73) and (75) is always the amplitude that occurs at the
load—after loss has occurred in propagating from the input.
Usually, the main objective in transmitting power to a load is to conﬁgure the
line/load combination such that there is no reﬂection. The load therefore receives all
the transmitted power. The condition for this is  = 0, which means that the load
impedance must be equal to the line impedance. In such cases the load is said to be
matched to the line (or vice versa). Various impedance-matching methods exist, many
of which will be explored later in this chapter.
Finally, the fractions of the incident wave power that are reﬂected and dissipated
by the load need to be determined. The incident power is found from (64), where this
time we position the load at z = L, with the line input at z = 0.

(77b)
The reader should be aware that the transmitted power fraction is not |τ|2, as one
might be tempted to conclude.
In situations involving the connection of two semi-inﬁnite transmission lines
having different characteristic impedances, reﬂections will occur at the junction, with
the second line being treated as the load. For a wave incident from line 1 (Z01) to
line 2 (Z02), we ﬁnd
 = Z02 −Z01
Z02 + Z01
(78)
The fraction of the power that propagates into the second line is then 1 −||2.

VOLTAGE STANDING WAVE RATIO
In many instances, characteristics of transmission line performance are amenable to
measurement. Included in these are measurements of unknown load impedances, or
input impedances of lines that are terminated by known or unknown load impedances.
Such techniques rely on the ability to measure voltage amplitudes that occur as func-
tions of position within a line, usually designed for this purpose. A typical apparatus
consists of a slotted line, which is a lossless coaxial transmission line having a longitu-
dinal gap in the outer conductor along its entire length. The line is positioned between
the sinusoidal voltage source and the impedance that is to be measured. Through the
gap in the slotted line, a voltage probe may be inserted to measure the voltage ampli-
tude between the inner and outer conductors. As the probe is moved along the length
of the line, the maximum and minimum voltage amplitudes are noted, and their ratio,
known as the voltage standing wave ratio, or VSWR, is determined. The signiﬁcance
of this measurement and its utility form the subject of this section.
To understand the meaning of the voltage measurements, we consider a few
special cases. First, if the slotted line is terminated by a matched impedance, then no
reﬂected wave occurs; the probe will indicate the same voltage amplitude at every
point. Of course, the instantaneous voltages that the probe samples will differ in phase
by β(z2 −z1) rad as the probe is moved from z = z1 to z = z2, but the system is
insensitive to the phase of the ﬁeld. The equal-amplitude voltages are characteristic
of an unattenuated traveling wave.
Second, if the slotted line is terminated by an open or short circuit (or in general
a purely imaginary load impedance), the total voltage in the line is a standing wave
and, as was shown in Example 10.1, the voltage probe provides no output when it is
located at the nodes; these occur periodically with half-wavelength spacing. As the
probe position is changed, its output varies as |cos(βz + φ)|, where z is the distance
from the load, and where the phase, φ, depends on the load impedance. For example,

324
ENGINEERING ELECTROMAGNETICS
if the load is a short circuit, the requirement of zero voltage at the short leads to
a null occurring there, and so the voltage in the line will vary as |sin(βz)| (where
φ = ±π/2).
A more complicated situation arises when the reﬂected voltage is neither 0 nor
100 percent of the incident voltage. Some energy is absorbed by the load and some
is reﬂected. The slotted line, therefore, supports a voltage that is composed of both
a traveling wave and a standing wave. It is customary to describe this voltage as a
standing wave, even though a traveling wave is also present. We will see that the
voltage does not have zero amplitude at any point for all time, and the degree to
which the voltage is divided between a traveling wave and a true standing wave is
expressed by the ratio of the maximum amplitude found by the probe to the minimum
amplitude (VSWR). This information, along with the positions of the voltage minima
or maxima with respect to that of the load, enable one to determine the load impedance.
The VSWR also provides a measure of the quality of the termination. Speciﬁcally, a
perfectly matched load yields a VSWR of exactly 1. A totally reﬂecting load produces
an inﬁnite VSWR.
To derive the speciﬁc form of the total voltage, we begin with the forward and
backward-propagating waves that occur within the slotted line. The load is positioned
at z = 0, and so all positions within the slotted line occur at negative values of z.
Taking the input wave amplitude as V0, the total phasor voltage is
VsT (z) = V0e−jβz + V0e jβz
(79)
The line, being lossless, has real characteristic impedance, Z0. The load impedance,
ZL, is in general complex, which leads to a complex reﬂection coefﬁcient:
 = ZL −Z0
ZL + Z0
= ||e jφ
(80)
If the load is a short circuit (ZL = 0), φ is equal to π; if ZL is real and less than Z0, φ
is also equal to π; and if ZL is real and greater than Z0, φ is zero. Using (80), we may
rewrite (79) in the form:
VsT (z) = V0
!
e−jβz + ||e j(βz+φ)"
= V0e jφ/2 !
e−jβze−jφ/2 + ||e jβze jφ/2"
(81)
To express (81) in a more useful form, we can apply the algebraic trick of adding and
subtracting the term V0(1 −||)e−jβz:
VsT (z) = V0(1 −||)e−jβz + V0||e jφ/2 !
e−jβze−jφ/2 + e jβze jφ/2"
(82)
The last term in parentheses in (82) becomes a cosine, and we write
VsT (z) = V0(1 −||)e−jβz + 2V0||e jφ/2 cos(βz + φ/2)
(83)

CHAPTER 10

The important characteristics of this result are most easily seen by converting it to

(84)
Equation (84) is recognized as the sum of a traveling wave of amplitude (1 −||)V0
and a standing wave having amplitude 2||V0. We can visualize events as follows:
The portion of the incident wave that reﬂects and back-propagates in the slotted line
interferes with an equivalent portion of the incident wave to form a standing wave.
The rest of the incident wave (which does not interfere) is the traveling wave part of
(84). The maximum amplitude observed in the line is found where the amplitudes
of the two terms in (84) add directly to give (1 + ||)V0. The minimum amplitude
is found where the standing wave achieves a null, leaving only the traveling wave
amplitude of (1 −||)V0. The fact that the two terms in (84) combine in this way
with the proper phasing is not immediately apparent, but the following arguments
will show that this does occur.
To obtain the minimum and maximum voltage amplitudes, we may revisit the
ﬁrst part of Eq. (81):
VsT (z) = V0
!
e−jβz + ||e j(βz+φ)"
(85)
First, the minimum voltage amplitude is obtained when the two terms in (85) subtract
directly (having a phase difference of π). This occurs at locations
zmin = −1
2β (φ + (2m + 1)π)
(m = 0, 1, 2, . . .)
(86)
Note again that all positions within the slotted line occur at negative values of z.
Substituting (86) into (85) leads to the minimum amplitude:
VsT (zmin) = V0(1 −||)
(87)
The same result is obtained by substituting (86) into the real voltage, (84). This
produces a null in the standing wave part, and we obtain
V(zmin, t) = ±V0(1 −||) sin(ωt + φ/2)
(88)
The voltage oscillates (through zero) in time, with amplitude V0(1 −||). The plus
and minus signs in (88) apply to even and odd values of m in (86), respectively.
Next, the maximum voltage amplitude is obtained when the two terms in (85)
add in-phase. This will occur at locations given by
zmax = −1
2β (φ + 2mπ)
(m = 0, 1, 2, . . .)
(89)

326
ENGINEERING ELECTROMAGNETICS
On substituting (89) into (85), we obtain
VsT (zmax) = V0(1 + ||)
(90)
As before, we may substitute (89) into the real instantaneous voltage (84). The effect
is to produce a maximum in the standing wave part, which then adds in-phase to the
running wave. The result is
V(zmax, t) = ±V0(1 + ||) cos(ωt + φ/2)
(91)
where the plus and minus signs apply to positive and negative values of m in (89),
respectively. Again, the voltage oscillates through zero in time, with amplitude
V0(1 + ||).
Note that a voltage maximum is located at the load (z = 0) if φ = 0; moreover,
φ = 0 when  is real and positive. This occurs for real ZL when ZL > Z0. Thus
there is a voltage maximum at the load when the load impedance is greater than Z0
and both impedances are real. With φ = 0, maxima also occur at zmax = −mπ/β =
−mλ/2. For a zero-load impedance, φ = π, and the maxima are found at zmax =
−π/(2β), −3π/(2β), or zmax = −λ/4, −3λ/4, and so forth.
The minima are separated by multiples of one half-wavelength (as are the
maxima), and for a zero load impedance, the ﬁrst minimum occurs when −βz = 0,
or at the load. In general, a voltage minimum is found at z = 0 whenever φ = π;
this occurs if ZL < Z0 where ZL is real. The general results are illustrated in
Figure 10.6.

Finally, the voltage standing wave ratio is deﬁned as:
s ≡VsT (zmax)
VsT (zmin) = 1 + ||
1 −||
(92)
Since the absolute voltage amplitudes have divided out, our measured VSWR permits
the immediate evaluation of ||. The phase of  is then found by measuring the
location of the ﬁrst maximum or minimum with respect to the load, and then using
(86) or (89) as appropriate. Once  is known, the load impedance can be found,
assuming Z0 is known.
D10.3. What voltage standing wave ratio results when  = ±1/2?
Ans. 3
EXAMPLE 10.7
Slotted line measurements yield a VSWR of 5, a 15-cm spacing between successive
voltage maxima, and the ﬁrst maximum at a distance of 7.5 cm in front of the load.
Determine the load impedance, assuming a 50- impedance for the slotted line.
Solution. The 15-cm spacing between maxima is λ/2, implying a wavelength of
30 cm. Because the slotted line is air-ﬁlled, the frequency is f = c/λ = 1 GHz. The
ﬁrst maximum at 7.5 cm is thus at a distance of λ/4 from the load, which means that
a voltage minimum occurs at the load. Thus  will be real and negative. We use (92)
to write
|| = s −1
s + 1 = 5 −1
5 + 1 = 2

So
 = −2
3 = ZL −Z0

which we solve for ZL to obtain

TRANSMISSION LINES
OF FINITE LENGTH
A new type of problem emerges when considering the propagation of sinusoidal
voltages on ﬁnite-length lines that have loads that are not impedance matched. In
such cases, numerous reﬂections occur at the load and at the generator, setting up a
multiwave bidirectional voltage distribution in the line. As always, the objective is
to determine the net power transferred to the load in steady state, but we must now
include the effect of the numerous forward- and backward-reﬂected waves.

Figure 10.7
Finite-length transmission line configuration and its equivalent circuit.
Figure 10.7 shows the basic problem. The line, assumed to be lossless, has
characteristic impedance Z0 and is of length l. The sinusoidal voltage source at
frequency ω provides phasor voltage Vs. Associated with the souce is a complex
internal impedance, Zg, as shown. The load impedance, ZL, is also assumed to be
complex and is located at z = 0. The line thus exists along the negative z axis.
The easiest method of approaching the problem is not to attempt to analyze every
reﬂection individually, but rather to recognize that in steady state, there will exist one
net forward wave and one net backward wave, representing the superposition of all
waves that are incident on the load and all waves that are reﬂected from it. We may
thus write the total voltage in the line as
VsT (z) = V +
0 e−jβz + V −
0 e jβz
(93)
in which V +
0 and V −
0 are complex amplitudes, composed respectively of the sum of
all individual forward and backward wave amplitudes and phases. In a similar way,
we may write the total current in the line:
IsT (z) = I +
0 e−jβz + I −
0 e jβz
(94)
We now deﬁne the wave impedance, Zw(z), as the ratio of the total phasor voltage to
the total phasor current. Using (93) and (94), this becomes:
Zw(z) ≡VsT (z)
IsT (z) = V +
0 e−jβz + V −
0 e jβz
I +
0 e−jβz + I −
0 e jβz
(95)
We next use the relations V −
0 = V +

0 = V +
0 /Z0, and I −
0 = −V −
0 /Z0. Eq. (95)
simpliﬁes to
Zw(z) = Z0
e−jβz + e jβz
e−jβz −e jβz

(96)
Now, using the Euler identity, (32), and substituting  = (ZL −Z0)/(ZL + Z0),
Eq. (96) becomes
Zw(z) = Z0
 ZL cos(βz) −j Z0 sin(βz)
Z0 cos(βz) −j ZL sin(βz)

(97)
The wave impedance at the line input is now found by evaluating (97) at z = −l,
obtaining

(98)
This is the quantity that we need in order to create the equivalent circuit in Figure 10.7.
One special case is that in which the line length is a half-wavelength, or an integer
multiple thereof. In that case,
βl = 2π
λ

= mπ
(m = 0, 1, 2, . . .)
Using this result in (98), we ﬁnd
Zin(l = mλ/2) = ZL
(99)
For a half-wave line, the equivalent circuit can be constructed simply by removing
the line completely and placing the load impedance at the input. This simpliﬁcation
works, of course, provided the line length is indeed an integer multiple of a half-
wavelength. Once the frequency begins to vary, the condition is no longer satisﬁed,
and (98) must be used in its general form to ﬁnd Zin.
Another important special case is that in which the line length is an odd multiple
of a quarter wavelength:
βl = 2π
λ (2m + 1)λ

(m = 0, 1, 2, . . .)
Using this result in (98) leads to
Zin(l = λ/4) = Z2

(100)
An immediate application of (100) is to the problem of joining two lines having
different characteristic impedances. Suppose the impedances are (from left to right)
Z01 and Z03. At the joint, we may insert an additional line whose characteristic
impedance is Z02 and whose length is λ/4. We thus have a sequence of joined lines
whose impedances progress as Z01, Z02, and Z03, in that order. A voltage wave is
now incident from line 1 onto the joint between Z01 and Z02. Now the effective load
at the far end of line 2 is Z03. The input impedance to line 2 at any frequency is now
Zin = Z02
Z03 cos β2l + j Z02 sin β2l
Z02 cos β2l + j Z03 sin β2l
(101)
Then, since the length of line 2 is λ/4,
Zin(line 2) = Z2
02
Z03
(102)
Reﬂections at the Z01–Z02 interface will not occur if Zin = Z01. Therefore, we can
match the junction (allowing complete transmission through the three-line sequence)

if Z02 is chosen so that
Z02 =

Z01Z03
(103)
This technique is called quarter-wave matching and again is limited to the frequency
(or narrow band of frequencies) such that l .= (2m + 1)λ/4. We will encounter more
examples of these techniques when we explore electromagnetic wave reﬂection in
Chapter 12. Meanwhile, further examples that involve the use of the input impedance
and the VSWR are presented in Section 10.12.
10.12
SOME TRANSMISSION LINE
EXAMPLES
In this section, we apply many of the results that we obtained in the previous sections
to several typical transmission line problems. We simplify our work by restricting our
attention to the lossless line.
Let us begin by assuming a two-wire 300  line (Z0 = 300 ), such as the
lead-in wire from the antenna to a television or FM receiver. The circuit is shown in
Figure 10.8. The line is 2 m long, and the values of L and C are such that the velocity
on the line is 2.5×108 m/s. We will terminate the line with a receiver having an input
resistance of 300  and represent the antenna by its Thevenin equivalent Z = 300 
in series with Vs = 60 V at 100 MHz. This antenna voltage is larger by a factor of
about 105 than it would be in a practical case, but it also provides simpler values to
work with; in order to think practical thoughts, divide currents or voltages by 105,
divide powers by 1010, and leave impedances alone.
Because the load impedance is equal to the characteristic impedance, the line is
matched; the reﬂection coefﬁcient is zero, and the standing wave ratio is unity. For
the given velocity and frequency, the wavelength on the line is v/f = 2.5 m, and the
phase constant is 2π/λ = 0.8π rad/m; the attenuation constant is zero. The electrical
length of the line is βl = (0.8π)2, or 1.6π rad. This length may also be expressed as
288◦, or 0.8 wavelength.
The input impedance offered to the voltage source is 300 , and since the internal
impedance of the source is 300 , the voltage at the input to the line is half of 60 V,
or 30 V. The source is matched to the line and delivers the maximum available power
Figure 10.8
A transmission line that is matched at both ends produces no
reflections and thus delivers maximum power to the load.

CHAPTER 10

331
to the line. Because there is no reﬂection and no attenuation, the voltage at the load
is 30 V, but it is delayed in phase by 1.6π rad. Thus,
Vin = 30 cos(2π108t) V
whereas
VL = 30 cos(2π108t −1.6π) V
The input current is
Iin = Vin
300 = 0.1 cos(2π108t) A
while the load current is
IL = 0.1 cos(2π108t −1.6π) A
The average power delivered to the input of the line by the source must all be delivered
to the load by the line,
Pin = PL = 1
2 × 30 × 0.1 = 1.5 W
Now let us connect a second receiver, also having an input resistance of 300 ,
across the line in parallel with the ﬁrst receiver. The load impedance is now 150 ,
the reﬂection coefﬁcient is
 = 150 −300
150 + 300 = −1

and the standing wave ratio on the line is
s = 1 + 1

The input impedance is no longer 300 , but is now

= 510̸ −23.8◦= 466 −j206 
which is a capacitive impedance. Physically, this means that this length of line stores
more energy in its electric ﬁeld than in its magnetic ﬁeld. The input current phasor is
thus
Is,in =

300 + 466 −j206 = 0.0756̸ 15.0◦A
and the power supplied to the line by the source is
Pin = 1
2 × (0.0756)2 × 466 = 1.333 W
Since there are no losses in the line, 1.333 W must also be delivered to the load.
Note that this is less than the 1.50 W which we were able to deliver to a matched
load; moreover, this power must divide equally between two receivers, and thus each

332

receiver now receives only 0.667 W. Because the input impedance of each receiver is
300 , the voltage across the receiver is easily found as
0.667 = 1

|Vs,L|2
300
|Vs,L| = 20 V
in comparison with the 30 V obtained across the single load.
Before we leave this example, let us ask ourselves several questions about the
voltages on the transmission line. Where is the voltage a maximum and a minimum,
and what are these values? Does the phase of the load voltage still differ from the
input voltage by 288◦? Presumably, if we can answer these questions for the voltage,
we could do the same for the current.
Equation (89) serves to locate the voltage maxima at
zmax = −1
2β (φ + 2mπ)
(m = 0, 1, 2, . . .)
where  = ||e jφ. Thus, with β = 0.8π and φ = π, we ﬁnd
zmax = −0.625
and
−1.875 m
while the minima are λ/4 distant from the maxima;
zmin = 0
and
−1.25 m
and we ﬁnd that the load voltage (at z = 0) is a voltage minimum. This, of course,
veriﬁes the general conclusion we reached earlier: a voltage minimum occurs at the
load if ZL < Z0, and a voltage maximum occurs if ZL > Z0, where both impedances
are pure resistances.
The minimum voltage on the line is thus the load voltage, 20 V; the maximum
voltage must be 40 V, since the standing wave ratio is 2. The voltage at the input end
of the line is
Vs,in = Is,in Zin = (0.0756̸ 15.0◦)(510̸ −23.8◦) = 38.5̸ −8.8◦
The input voltage is almost as large as the maximum voltage anywhere on the line
because the line is about three-quarters of a wavelength long, a length which would
place the voltage maximum at the input when ZL < Z0.
Finally, it is of interest to determine the load voltage in magnitude and phase.

We may now let z = 0 in (104) to ﬁnd the load voltage,
Vs,L = (1 + )V +
0 = 20̸ 72◦= 20̸ −288◦
The amplitude agrees with our previous value. The presence of the reﬂected wave
causes Vs,in and Vs,L to differ in phase by about −279◦instead of −288◦.
EXAMPLE 10.8
In order to provide a slightly more complicated example, let us now place a purely
capacitive impedance of −j300  in parallel with the two 300  receivers. We are
to ﬁnd the input impedance and the power delivered to each receiver.
Solution. The load impedance is now 150  in parallel with −j300 , or
ZL = 150(−j300)
150 −j300 = −j300
1 −j2 = 120 −j60 
We ﬁrst calculate the reﬂection coefﬁcient and the VSWR:
 = 120 −j60 −300
120 −j60 + 300 = −180 −j60
420 −j60 = 0.447̸ −153.4◦
s = 1 + 0.447
1 −0.447 = 2.62
Thus, the VSWR is higher and the mismatch is therefore worse. Let us next calculate
the input impedance. The electrical length of the line is still 288◦, so that
Zin = 300 (120 −j60) cos 288◦+ j300 sin 288◦
300 cos 288◦+ j(120 −j60) sin 288◦= 755 −j138.5 
This leads to a source current of
Is,in =
VT h
ZT h + Zin
=
60
300 + 755 −j138.5 = 0.0564̸ 7.47◦A
Therefore, the average power delivered to the input of the line is Pin
=
1
2(0.0564)2(755) = 1.200 W. Since the line is lossless, it follows that PL = 1.200 W,
and each receiver gets only 0.6 W.
EXAMPLE 10.9
As a ﬁnal example, let us terminate our line with a purely capacitive impedance, ZL =
−j300 . We seek the reﬂection coefﬁcient, the VSWR, and the power delivered to
the load.
Solution. Obviously, we cannot deliver any average power to the load since it is a
pure reactance. As a consequence, the reﬂection coefﬁcient is
 = −j300 −300
−j300 + 300 = −j1 = 1̸ −90◦

334
ENGINEERING ELECTROMAGNETICS
and the reﬂected wave is equal in amplitude to the incident wave. Hence, it should
not surprise us to see that the VSWR is
s = 1 + | −j1|
1 −| −j1| = ∞
and the input impedance is a pure reactance,
Zin = 300 −j300 cos 288◦+ j300 sin 288◦
300 cos 288◦+ j(−j300) sin 288◦= j589
Thus, no average power can be delivered to the input impedance by the source, and
therefore no average power can be delivered to the load.
Although we could continue to ﬁnd numerous other facts and ﬁgures for these
examples, much of the work may be done more easily for problems of this type by
using graphical techniques. We encounter these in Section 10.13.

GRAPHICAL METHODS: THE SMITH
CHART
Transmission line problems often involve manipulations with complex numbers, mak-
ing the time and effort required for a solution several times greater than are needed
for a similar sequence of operations on real numbers. One means of reducing the
labor without seriously affecting the accuracy is by using transmission-line charts.
Probably the most widely used one is the Smith chart.3
Basically, this diagram shows curves of constant resistance and constant reac-
tance; these may represent either an input impedance or a load impedance. The latter,
of course, is the input impedance of a zero-length line. An indication of location along
the line is also provided, usually in terms of the fraction of a wavelength from a voltage
maximum or minimum. Although they are not speciﬁcally shown on the chart, the
standing-wave ratio and the magnitude and angle of the reﬂection coefﬁcient are very

quickly determined. As a matter of fact, the diagram is constructed within a circle of
unit radius, using polar coordinates, with radius variable || and counterclockwise
angle variable φ, where  = ||e jφ. Figure 10.9 shows this circle. Since || < 1, all
our information must lie on or within the unit circle. Peculiarly enough, the reﬂection
coefﬁcient itself will not be plotted on the ﬁnal chart, for these additional contours
would make the chart very difﬁcult to read.
The basic relationship upon which the chart is constructed is
 = ZL −Z0
ZL + Z0
(106)
The impedances that we plot on the chart will be normalized with respect to the
characteristic impedance. Let us identify the normalized load impedance as zL,
zL = r + jx = ZL

and thus
 = zL −1
zL + 1
or

In polar form, we have used || and φ as the magnitude and angle of . With r and
i as the real and imaginary parts of , we write
 = r + ji
(108)
Thus
r + jx = 1 + r + ji

The ﬁrst equation describes a family of circles, where each circle is associated
with a speciﬁc value of resistance r. For example, if r = 0, the radius of this zero-
resistance circle is seen to be unity, and it is centered at the origin (r = 0, i = 0).
This checks, for a pure reactance termination leads to a reﬂection coefﬁcient of unity
magnitude. On the other hand, if r = ∞, then zL = ∞and we have  = 1 + j0.
The circle described by (112) is centered at r = 1, i = 0 and has zero radius. It is
therefore the point  = 1 + j0, as we decided it should be. As another example, the
circle for r = 1 is centered at r = 0.5, i = 0 and has a radius of 0.5. This circle
is shown in Figure 10.10, along with circles for r = 0.5 and r = 2. All circles are
centered on the r axis and pass through the point  = 1 + j0.
Equation (113) also represents a family of circles, but each of these circles is
deﬁned by a particular value of x, rather than r. If x = ∞, then zL = ∞, and
 = 1 + j0 again. The circle described by (113) is centered at  = 1 + j0 and has
zero radius; it is therefore the point  = 1+ j0. If x = +1, then the circle is centered
at  = 1 + j1 and has unit radius. Only one-quarter of this circle lies within the
boundary curve || = 1, as shown in Figure 10.11. A similar quarter-circle appears
below the r axis for x = −1. The portions of other circles for x = 0.5, −0.5, 2,
and −2 are also shown. The “circle” representing x = 0 is the r axis; this is also
labeled in Figure 10.11.
The two families of circles both appear on the Smith chart, as shown in
Figure 10.12. It is now evident that if we are given ZL, we may divide by Z0 to

obtain zL, locate the appropriate r and x circles (interpolating as necessary), and
determine  by the intersection of the two circles. Because the chart does not have
concentric circles showing the values of ||, it is necessary to measure the radial
distance from the origin to the intersection with dividers or a compass and use an
auxiliary scale to ﬁnd ||. The graduated line segment below the chart in Figure
10.12 serves this purpose. The angle of  is φ, and it is the counterclockwise angle
from the r axis. Again, radial lines showing the angle would clutter up the chart

badly, so the angle is indicated on the circumference of the circle. A straight line from
the origin through the intersection may be extended to the perimeter of the chart. As
an example, if ZL = 25 + j50  on a 50  line, zL = 0.5 + j1, and point A on
Figure 10.12 shows the intersection of the r = 0.5 and x = 1 circles. The reﬂection
coefﬁcient is approximately 0.62 at an angle φ of 83◦.
The Smith chart is completed by adding a second scale on the circumference by
which distance along the line may be computed. This scale is in wavelength units, but
the values placed on it are not obvious. To obtain them, we ﬁrst divide the voltage at
any point along the line,
Vs = V +

by the current

Replacing z with −l and dividing numerator and denominator by e jβl, we have the
general equation relating normalized input impedance, reﬂection coefﬁcient, and

line length,
zin = 1 + e−j2βl
1 −e−j2βl = 1 + ||e j(φ−2βl)
1 −||e j(φ−2βl)
(114)
Note that when l = 0, we are located at the load, and zin = (1 + )/(l −) = zL, as
shown by (107).
Equation (114) shows that the input impedance at any point z = −l can be
obtained by replacing , the reﬂection coefﬁcient of the load, by e−j2βl. That is, we
decrease the angle of  by 2βl radians as we move from the load to the line input.
Only the angle of  is changed; the magnitude remains constant.
Thus, as we proceed from the load zL to the input impedance zin, we move
toward the generator a distance l on the transmission line, but we move through a
clockwise angle of 2βl on the Smith chart. Since the magnitude of  stays constant, the
movement toward the source is made along a constant-radius circle. One lap around
the chart is accomplished whenever βl changes by π rad, or when l changes by one-
half wavelength. This agrees with our earlier discovery that the input impedance of a
half-wavelength lossless line is equal to the load impedance.
The Smith chart is thus completed by the addition of a scale showing a change
of 0.5λ for one circumnavigation of the unit circle. For convenience, two scales are
usually given, one showing an increase in distance for clockwise movement and
the other an increase for counterclockwise travel. These two scales are shown in
Figure 10.13. Note that the one marked “wavelengths toward generator” (wtg) shows
increasing values of l/λ for clockwise travel, as described previously. The zero point
of the wtg scale is rather arbitrarily located to the left. This corresponds to input
impedances having phase angles of 0◦and RL < Z0. We have also seen that voltage
minima are always located here.
EXAMPLE 10.10
The use of the transmission line chart is best shown by example. Let us again consider
a load impedance, ZL = 25 + j50 , terminating a 50- line. The line length is
60 cm and the operating frequency is such that the wavelength on the line is 2 m. We
desire the input impedance.
Solution. We have zL = 0.5 + j1, which is marked as A on Figure 10.14, and we
read  = 0.62̸ 82◦. By drawing a straight line from the origin through A to the
circumference, we note a reading of 0.135 on the wtg scale. We have l/λ = 0.6/2 =
0.3, and it is, therefore, 0.3λ from the load to the input. We therefore ﬁnd zin on the
|| = 0.62 circle opposite a wtg reading of 0.135 + 0.300 = 0.435. This construction
is shown in Figure 10.14, and the point locating the input impedance is marked B.
The normalized input impedance is read as 0.28 −j0.40, and thus Zin = 14 −j20.
A more accurate analytical calculation gives Zin = 13.7 −j20.2.
Information concerning the location of the voltage maxima and minima is also
readily obtained on the Smith chart. We already know that a maximum or minimum

must occur at the load when ZL is a pure resistance; if RL > Z0 there is a maximum
at the load, and if RL < Z0 there is a minimum. We may extend this result now
by noting that we could cut off the load end of a transmission line at a point where
the input impedance is a pure resistance and replace that section with a resistance
Rin; there would be no changes on the generator portion of the line. It follows, then,
that the location of voltage maxima and minima must be at those points where Zin
is a pure resistance. Purely resistive input impedances must occur on the x = 0
line (the r axis) of the Smith chart. Voltage maxima or current minima occur when
r > 1, or at wtg = 0.25, and voltage minima or current maxima occur when r < 1,

or at wtg = 0. In Example 10.10, then, the maximum at wtg = 0.250 must occur
0.250 −0.135 = 0.115 wavelengths toward the generator from the load. This is a
distance of 0.115 × 200, or 23 cm from the load.
We should also note that because the standing wave ratio produced by a resistive
load RL is either RL/R0 or R0/RL, whichever is greater than unity, the value of s may
be read directly as the value of r at the intersection of the || circle and the r axis,
r > 1. In our example, this intersection is marked point C, and r = 4.2; thus, s = 4.2.
Transmission line charts may also be used for normalized admittances, although
there are several slight differences in such use. We let yL = YL/Y0 = g + jb and
use the r circles as g circles and the x circles as b circles. The two differences are,
ﬁrst, the line segment where g > 1 and b = 0 corresponds to a voltage minimum;
and second, 180◦must be added to the angle of  as read from the perimeter of the
chart. We shall use the Smith chart in this way in Section 10.14.
Special charts are also available for non-normalized lines, particularly 50 
charts and 20 mS charts.

Figure 10.15
A sketch of a coaxial slotted line. The distance scale is on the
slotted line. With the load in place, s = 2.5, and the minimum occurs at a scale
reading of 47 cm. For a short circuit, the minimum is located at a scale reading of
26 cm. The wavelength is 75 cm.
We next consider two examples of practical transmission line problems. The ﬁrst
is the determination of load impedance from experimental data, and the second is the
design of a single-stub matching network.
Let us assume that we have made experimental measurements on a 50  slotted
line that show there is a voltage standing wave ratio of 2.5. This has been determined
by moving a sliding carriage back and forth along the line to determine maximum and
minimum voltage readings. A scale provided on the track along which the carriage
moves indicates that a minimum occurs at a scale reading of 47.0 cm, as shown in
Figure 10.15. The zero point of the scale is arbitrary and does not correspond to the
location of the load. The location of the minimum is usually speciﬁed instead of the
maximum because it can be determined more accurately than that of the maximum;
think of the sharper minima on a rectiﬁed sine wave. The frequency of operation is
400 MHz, so the wavelength is 75 cm. In order to pinpoint the location of the load,
we remove it and replace it with a short circuit; the position of the minimum is then
determined as 26.0 cm.
We know that the short circuit must be located an integral number of half-
wavelengths from the minimum; let us arbitrarily locate it one half-wavelength away
at 26.0 −37.5 = −11.5 cm on the scale. Since the short circuit has replaced the
load, the load is also located at −11.5 cm. Our data thus show that the minimum
is 47.0 −(−11.5) = 58.5 cm from the load, or subtracting one-half wavelength, a
minimum is 21.0 cm from the load. The voltage maximum is thus 21.0 −(37.5/2) =
2.25 cm from the load, or 2.25/75 = 0.030 wavelength from the load.
With this information, we can now turn to the Smith chart. At a voltage maximum,
the input impedance is a pure resistance equal to sR0; on a normalized basis, zin = 2.5.

CHAPTER 10
Transmission Lines
343
Figure 10.16
If zin = 2.5 + j 0
on a line 0.3 wavelengths long, then
zL = 2.1 + j 0.8.
We therefore enter the chart at zin = 2.5 and read 0.250 on the wtg scale. Subtracting
0.030 wavelength to reach the load, we ﬁnd that the intersection of the s = 2.5 (or
|| = 0.429) circle and the radial line to 0.220 wavelength is at zL = 2.1+ j0.8. The
construction is sketched on the Smith chart of Figure 10.16. Thus ZL = 105+ j40 ,
a value that assumes its location at a scale reading of −11.5 cm, or an integral number
of half-wavelengths from that position. Of course, we may select the “location” of
our load at will by placing the short circuit at the point that we wish to consider the
load location. Since load locations are not well deﬁned, it is important to specify the
point (or plane) at which the load impedance is determined.
As a ﬁnal example, let us try to match this load to the 50  line by placing a
short-circuited stub of length d1 a distance d from the load (see Figure 10.17). The
stub line has the same characteristic impedance as the main line. The lengths d and
d1 are to be determined.
Figure 10.17
A short-circuited stub of length d1,
located at a distance d from a load ZL, is used to
provide a matched load to the left of the stub.

344
ENGINEERING ELECTROMAGNETICS
The input impedance to the stub is a pure reactance; when combined in parallel
with the input impedance of the length d containing the load, the resultant input
impedance must be 1 + j0. Because it is much easier to combine admittances in
parallel than impedances, let us rephrase our goal in admittance language: the input
admittance of the length d containing the load must be 1 + jbin for the addition of
the input admittance of the stub jbstub to produce a total admittance of 1 + j0. Hence
the stub admittance is −jbin. We will therefore use the Smith chart as an admittance
chart instead of an impedance chart.
The impedance of the load is 2.1 + j0.8, and its location is at −11.5 cm. The
admittance of the load is therefore 1/(2.1 + j0.8), and this value may be determined
by adding one-quarter wavelength on the Smith chart, as Zin for a quarter-wavelength
line is R2
0/ZL, or zin = 1/zL, or yin = zL. Entering the chart (Figure 10.18) at
zL = 2.1 + j0.8, we read 0.220 on the wtg scale; we add (or subtract) 0.250 and
ﬁnd the admittance 0.41 −j0.16 corresponding to this impedance. This point is
still located on the s = 2.5 circle. Now, at what point or points on this circle is
the real part of the admittance equal to unity? There are two answers, 1 + j0.95 at
wtg = 0.16, and 1 −j0.95 at wtg = 0.34, as shown in Figure 10.18. We select the
former value since this leads to the shorter stub. Hence ystub = −j0.95, and the stub
location corresponds to wtg = 0.16. Because the load admittance was found at wtg =
0.470, then we must move (0.5 −0.47) + 0.16 = 0.19 wavelength to get to the stub
location.
Finally, we may use the chart to determine the necessary length of the short-
circuited stub. The input conductance is zero for any length of short-circuited stub,
so we are restricted to the perimeter of the chart. At the short circuit, y = ∞and
wtg = 0.250. We ﬁnd that bin = −0.95 is achieved at wtg = 0.379, as shown in
Figure 10.18. The stub is therefore 0.379 −0.250 = 0.129 wavelength, or 9.67 cm
long.

TRANSIENT ANALYSIS
Throughout most of this chapter, we have considered the operation of transmission
linesundersteady-stateconditions,inwhichvoltageandcurrentweresinusoidalandat
a single frequency. In this section we move away from the simple time-harmonic case
and consider transmission line responses to voltage step functions and pulses, grouped
under the general heading of transients. These situations were brieﬂy considered in
Section 10.2 with regard to switched voltages and currents. Line operation in transient
mode is important to study because it allows us to understand how lines can be
used to store and release energy (in pulse-forming applications, for example). Pulse
propagation is important in general since digital signals, composed of sequences of
pulses, are widely used.
We will conﬁne our discussion to the propagation of transients in lines that are
lossless and have no dispersion, so that the basic behavior and analysis methods
may be learned. We must remember, however, that transient signals are necessarily
composed of numerous frequencies, as Fourier analysis will show. Consequently, the
question of dispersion in the line arises, since, as we have found, line propagation
constants and reﬂection coefﬁcients at complex loads will be frequency-dependent.
So, in general, pulses are likely to broaden with propagation distance, and pulse
shapes may change when reﬂecting from a complex load. These issues will not be
considered in detail here, but they are readily addressed when the precise frequency
dependences of β and  are known. In particular, β(ω) can be found by evaluating
the imaginary part of γ , as given in Eq. (41), which would in general include the
frequency dependences of R, C, G, and L arising from various mechanisms. For
example, the skin effect (which affects both the conductor resistance and the internal
inductance) will result in frequency-dependent R and L. Once β(ω) is known, pulse
broadening can be evaluated using the methods to be presented in Chapter 12.
We begin our basic discussion of transients by considering a lossless transmission
line of length l terminated by a matched load, RL = Z0, as shown in Figure 10.19a.

(a) Closing the switch at time t = 0 initiates voltage and current waves
V + and I +. The leading edge of both waves is indicated by the dashed line, which
propagates in the lossless line toward the load at velocity ν. In this case, V + = V0;
the line voltage is V + everywhere to the left of the leading edge, where current is
I + = V +/Z0. To the right of the leading edge, voltage and current are both zero.
Clockwise current, indicated here, is treated as positive and will occur when V + is
positive. (b) Voltage across the load resistor as a function of time, showing the one-way
transit time delay, l /ν.
At the front end of the line is a battery of voltage V0, which is connected to the line
by closing a switch. At time t = 0, the switch is closed, and the line voltage at z = 0
becomes equal to the battery voltage. This voltage, however, does not appear across
the load until adequate time has elapsed for the propagation delay. Speciﬁcally, at
t = 0, a voltage wave is initiated in the line at the battery end, which then propagates
toward the load. The leading edge of the wave, labeled V + in Figure 10.19, is of value
V + = V0. It can be thought of as a propagating step function, because at all points to
the left of V +, the line voltage is V0; at all points to the right (not yet reached by the
leading edge), the line voltage is zero. The wave propagates at velocity ν, which in
general is the group velocity in the line.4 The wave reaches the load at time t = l/ν
4 Because we have a step function (composed of many frequencies) as opposed to a sinusoid at a single
frequency, the wave will propagate at the group velocity. In a lossless line with no dispersion as
considered in this section, β = ω
√
LC, where L and C are constant with frequency. In this case, we
would ﬁnd that the group and phase velocities are equal; that is, dω/dβ = ω/β = ν = 1/
√
LC. We
will thus write the velocity as ν, knowing it to be both νp and νg.

and then does not reﬂect, as the load is matched. The transient phase is thus over, and
the load voltage is equal to the battery voltage. A plot of load voltage as a function
of time is shown in Figure 10.19b, indicating the propagation delay of t = l/ν.
Associated with the voltage wave V + is a current wave whose leading edge is
of value I +. This wave is a propagating step function as well, whose value at all
points to the left of V + is I + = V +/Z0; at all points to the right, current is zero. A
plot of current through the load as a function of time will thus be identical in form
to the voltage plot of Figure 10.19b, except that the load current at t = l/ν will be
IL = V +/Z0 = V0/RL.
We next consider a more general case, in which the load of Figure 10.19a is again
a resistor but is not matched to the line (RL ̸= Z0). Reﬂections will thus occur at the
load, complicating the problem. At t = 0, the switch is closed as before and a voltage
wave, V +
1 = V0, propagates to the right. Upon reaching the load, however, the wave
will now reﬂect, producing a back-propagating wave, V −
1 . The relation between V −
1
and V +
1 is through the reﬂection coefﬁcient at the load:
V −
1
V +

= L = RL −Z0
RL + Z0
(115)
As V −
1 propagates back toward the battery, it leaves behind its leading edge a total
voltage of V +
1 + V −
1 . Voltage V +
1 exists everywhere ahead of the V −
1 wave until it
reaches the battery, whereupon the entire line now is charged to voltage V +
1 + V −
1 .
At the battery, the V −
1 wave reﬂects to produce a new forward wave, V +
2 . The ratio
of V +
2 and V −
1 is found through the reﬂection coefﬁcient at the battery:
V +

V −

= g = Zg −Z0
Zg + Z0
= 0 −Z0
0 + Z0
= −1
(116)
where the impedance at the generator end, Zg, is that of the battery, or zero.
V +
2 (equal to −V −
1 ) now propagates to the load, where it reﬂects to produce
backward wave V −
2 = LV +
2 . This wave then returns to the battery, where it reﬂects
with g = −1, and the process repeats. Note that with each round trip the wave
voltage is reduced in magnitude because |L| < 1. Because of this the propagating
wave voltages will eventually approach zero, and steady state is reached.
The voltage across the load resistor can be found at any given time by summing
the voltage waves that have reached the load and have reﬂected from it up to that time.
After many round trips, the load voltage will be, in general,

Figure 10.20
With series resistance at the battery location, voltage
division occurs when the switch is closed, such that V0 = Vr g + V +
1 .
Shown is the first reflected wave, which leaves voltage V +
1 + V −
1 behind its
leading edge. Associated with the wave is current I −
1 , which is −V −
1 /Z0.
Counterclockwise current is treated as negative and will occur when V −
1 is
positive.
Allowing time to approach inﬁnity, the second term in parentheses in (117) becomes
the power series expansion for the expression 1/(1 −gL). Thus, in steady state we
obtain
VL = V +


(118)
In our present example, V +
1 = V0 and g = −1. Substituting these into (118), we
ﬁnd the expected result in steady state: VL = V0.
A more general situation would involve a nonzero impedance at the battery
location, as shown in Figure 10.20. In this case, a resistor of value Rg is positioned in
series with the battery. When the switch is closed, the battery voltage appears across
the series combination of Rg and the line characteristic impedance, Z0. The value of
the initial voltage wave, V +
1 , is thus found through simple voltage division, or
V +
1 =
V0Z0
Rg + Z0
(119)
With this initial value, the sequence of reﬂections and the development of the voltage
across the load occurs in the same manner as determined by (117), with the steady-
state value determined by (118). The value of the reﬂection coefﬁcient at the generator
end, determined by (116), is g = (Rg −Z0)/(Rg + Z0).
A useful way of keeping track of the voltage at any point in the line is through
a voltage reﬂection diagram. Such a diagram for the line of Figure 10.20 is shown
in Figure 10.21a. It is a two-dimensional plot in which position on the line, z, is
shown on the horizontal axis. Time is plotted on the vertical axis and is conveniently
expressed as it relates to position and velocity through t = z/ν. A vertical line, located
at z = l, is drawn, which, together with the ordinate, deﬁnes the z axis boundaries of
the transmission line. With the switch located at the battery position, the initial voltage
wave, V +
1 , starts at the origin, or lower-left corner of the diagram (z = t = 0). The
location of the leading edge of V +
1 as a function of time is shown as the diagonal line

that joins the origin to the point along the right-hand vertical line that corresponds to
time t = l/ν (the one-way transit time). From there (the load location), the position
of the leading edge of the reﬂected wave, V −
1 , is shown as a “reﬂected” line that joins
the t = l/ν point on the right boundary to the t = 2l/ν point on the ordinate. From
there (at the battery location), the wave reﬂects again, forming V +
2 , shown as a line
parallel to that for V +
1 . Subsequent reﬂected waves are shown, and their values are
labeled.

The voltage as a function of time at a given position in the line can now be
determined by adding the voltages in the waves as they intersect a vertical line drawn
at the desired location. This addition is performed starting at the bottom of the diagram
(t = 0) and progressing upward (in time). Whenever a voltage wave crosses the
vertical line, its value is added to the total at that time. For example, the voltage
at a location three-fourths the distance from the battery to the load is plotted in
Figure 10.21b. To obtain this plot, the line z = (3/4)l is drawn on the diagram.
Whenever a wave crosses this line, the voltage in the wave is added to the voltage that
has accumulated at z = (3/4)l over all earlier times. This general procedure enables
one to easily determine the voltage at any speciﬁc time and location. In doing so, the
terms in (117) that have occurred up to the chosen time are being added, but with
information on the time at which each term appears.
Line current can be found in a similar way through a current reﬂection diagram.
It is easiest to construct the current diagram directly from the voltage diagram by
determining a value for current that is associated with each voltage wave. In dealing
with current, it is important to keep track of the sign of the current because it relates to
the voltage waves and their polarities. Referring to Figures 10.19a and 10.20, we use
the convention in which current associated with a forward-z traveling voltage wave
of positive polarity is positive. This would result in current that ﬂows in the clock-
wise direction, as shown in Figure 10.19a. Current associated with a backward-z
travelingvoltagewaveofpositivepolarity(thusﬂowingcounterclockwise)isnegative.
Such a case is illustrated in Figure 10.20. In our two-dimensional transmission-line
drawings, we assign positive polarity to voltage waves propagating in either direction
if the upper conductor carries a positive charge and the lower conductor a negative
charge. In Figures 10.19a and 10.20, both voltage waves are of positive polarity, so
their associated currents will be net positive for the forward wave and net negative
for the backward wave. In general, we write
I + = V +
Z0
(120)
and
I −= −V −
Z0
(121)
Finding the current associated with a backward-propagating voltage wave immedi-
ately requires a minus sign, as (121) indicates.
Figure 10.22a shows the current reﬂection diagram that is derived from the
voltage diagram of Figure 10.21a. Note that the current values are labeled in terms of
the voltage values, with the appropriate sign added as per (120) and (121). Once the
current diagram is constructed, current at a given location and time can be found in
exactly the same manner as voltage is found using the voltage diagram. Figure 10.22b
shows the current as a function of time at the z = (3/4)l position, determined by
summing the current wave values as they cross the vertical line drawn at that location.

coefﬁcient

So V −
1 = −(1/3)V +
1 = −5/3 V. This wave returns to the battery, where it encoun-
ters reﬂection coefﬁcient g = 0. Thus, no further waves appear; steady state is
reached.

constructed. The values for the two current waves are

The voltage at the load as a function of time is now found by summing the
voltages along the vertical line at the load position. The resulting plot is shown in
Figure 10.24a. Current in the battery is found by summing the currents along the
vertical axis, with the resulting plot shown as Figure 10.24b. Note that in steady
state, we treat the circuit as lumped, with the battery in series with the 50- and 25-

In an initially charged line, closing the switch as shown initiates a
voltage wave of opposite polarity to that of the initial voltage. The wave thus
depletes the line voltage and will fully discharge the line in one round trip if
Rg = Z0.
This value is also found from the current reﬂection diagram for t > 2l/ν. Similarly,
the steady-state load voltage should be

Rg + RL
= (10)(25)
50 + 25 = 10
3 V
which is found also from the voltage reﬂection diagram for t > l/ν.
Another type of transient problem involves lines that are initially charged. In
these cases, the manner in which the line discharges through a load is of interest.
Consider the situation shown in Figure 10.25, in which a charged line of characteristic
impedance Z0 is discharged through a resistor of value Rg when a switch at the resistor
location is closed.5 We consider the resistor at the z = 0 location; the other end of
the line is open (as would be necessary) and is located at z = l.
When the switch is closed, current IR begins to ﬂow through the resistor, and the
line discharge process begins. This current does not immediately ﬂow everywhere
in the transmission line but begins at the resistor and establishes its presence at
more distant parts of the line as time progresses. By analogy, consider a long line
of automobiles at a red light. When the light turns green, the cars at the front move
through the intersection ﬁrst, followed successively by those further toward the rear.
The point that divides cars in motion and those standing still is, in fact, a wave that
propagates toward the back of the line. In the transmission line, the ﬂow of charge
progresses in a similar way. A voltage wave, V +
1 , is initiated and propagates to the
right. To the left of its leading edge, charge is in motion; to the right of the leading
edge, charge is stationary and carries its original density. Accompanying the charge
in motion to the left of V +
1 is a drop in the charge density as the discharge process
occurs, and so the line voltage to the left of V +
1 is partially reduced. This voltage will
be given by the sum of the initial voltage, V0, and V +
1 , which means that V +
1 must
5 Even though this is a load resistor, we will call it Rg because it is located at the front (generator) end
of the line.

in fact be negative (or of opposite sign to V0). The line discharge process is analyzed
by keeping track of V +
1 as it propagates and undergoes multiple reﬂections at the two
ends. Voltage and current reﬂection diagrams are used for this purpose in much the
same way as before.
Referring to Figure 10.25, we see that for positive V0 the current ﬂowing through
the resistor will be counterclockwise and hence negative. We also know that continuity
requires that the resistor current be equal to the current associated with the voltage
wave, or
IR = I +
1 = V +

Z0
Now the resistor voltage will be
VR = V0 + V +
1 = −IR Rg = −I +
1 Rg = −V +

Rg
where the minus signs arise from the fact that VR (having positive polarity) is produced
by the negative current, IR. We solve for V +
1 to obtain
V +
1 = −V0Z0
Z0 + Rg
(122)
Having found V +
1 , we can set up the voltage and current reﬂection diagrams. The
diagram for voltage is shown in Figure 10.26. Note that the initial condition of voltage
V0 everywhere on the line is accounted for by assigning voltage V0 to the horizontal
axis of the voltage diagram. The diagram is otherwise drawn as before, but with
L = 1 (at the open-circuited load end). Variations in how the line discharges thus
depend on the resistor value at the switch end, Rg, which determines the reﬂection
coefﬁcient, g, at that location. The current reﬂection diagram is derived from the
voltage diagram in the usual way. There is no initial current to consider.

Voltage across the resistor as a function of time, as
determined from the reflection diagram of Figure 10.26, in which
Rg = Z0 ( = 0).
A special case of practical importance is that in which the resistor is matched
to the line, or Rg = Z0. In this case, Eq. (122) gives V +
1 = −V0/2. The line fully
discharges in one round trip of V +
1 and produces a voltage across the resistor of value
VR = V0/2, which persists for time T = 2l/ν. The resistor voltage as a function
of time is shown in Figure 10.27. The transmission line in this application is known
as a pulse-forming line; pulses that are generated in this way are well formed and
of low noise, provided the switch is sufﬁciently fast. Commercial units are available
that are capable of generating high-voltage pulses of widths on the order of a few
nanoseconds, using thyratron-based switches.
When the resistor is not matched to the line, full discharge still occurs, but does
so over several reﬂections, leading to a complicated pulse shape.
EXAMPLE 10.12
In the charged line of Figure 10.25, the characteristic impedance is Z0 = 100 , and
Rg = 100/3 . The line is charged to an initial voltage, V0 = 160 V, and the switch is
closed at time t = 0. Determine and plot the voltage and current through the resistor
for time 0 < t < 8l/ν (four round trips).
Solution. With the given values of Rg and Z0, Eq. (47) gives g = −1/2. Then,
with L = 1, and using (122), we ﬁnd

Using these values on the voltage reﬂection diagram, we evaluate the voltage in time
at the resistor location by moving up the left-hand vertical axis, adding voltages as
we progress, and beginning with V0 + V +
1 at t = 0. Note that when we add voltages
along the vertical axis, we are encountering the intersection points between incident

and reﬂected waves, which occur (in time) at each integer multiple of 2l/ν. So, when
moving up the axis, we add the voltages of both waves to our total at each occurrence.
The voltage within each time interval is thus:

The current through the resistor is most easily obtained by dividing the voltages
in Figure 10.28a by −Rg. As a demonstration, we can also use the current diagram
of Figure 10.22a to obtain this result. Using (120) and (121), we evaluate the current
waves as follows:
I +
1 = V +
1 /Z0 = −1.2 A
I −
1 = −V −
1 /Z0 = +1.2 A
I +
2 = −I −

3 = −I −
3 = V +
3 /Z0 = −0.30 A
I +
4 = −I −
4 = V +
4 /Z0 = +0.15 A
Using these values on the current reﬂection diagram, Figure 10.22a, we add up
currents in the resistor in time by moving up the left-hand axis, as we did with
the voltage diagram. The result is shown in Figure 10.28b. As a further check to the
correctness of our diagram construction, we note that current at the open end of the
line (Z = l) must always be zero. Therefore, summing currents up the right-hand
axis must give a zero result for all time. The reader is encouraged to verify this.

A sinusoidal voltage wave of amplitude V0, frequency ω, and phase
constant β propagates in the forward z direction toward the open load end in
a lossless transmission line of characteristic impedance Z0. At the end, the
wave totally reﬂects with zero phase shift, and the reﬂected wave now
interferes with the incident wave to yield a standing wave pattern over the
line length (as per Example 10.1). Determine the standing wave pattern for
the current in the line. Express the result in real instantaneous form and
simplify.

A transmitter and receiver are connected using a cascaded pair of
transmission lines. At the operating frequency, line 1 has a measured loss of
0.1 dB/m, and line 2 is rated at 0.2 dB/m. The link is composed of 40 m of
line 1 joined to 25 m of line 2. At the joint, a splice loss of 2 dB is
measured. If the transmitted power is 100 mW, what is the received power?

An absolute measure of power is the dBm scale, in which power is speciﬁed

having a sensitivity of −20 dBm, indicating the mimimum power that it
must receive in order to adequately interpret the transmitted electronic data.
Suppose this receiver is at the load end of a 50- transmission line having
100-m length and loss rating of 0.09 dB/m. The receiver impedance is 75 ,

In a circuit in which a sinusoidal voltage source drives its internal impedance
in series with a load impedance, it is known that maximum power transfer
to the load occurs when the source and load impedances form a complex
conjugate pair. Suppose the source (with its internal impedance) now drives
a complex load of impedance ZL = RL + j X L that has been moved to the
end of a lossless transmission line of length ℓhaving characteristic

creating a rectangular voltage pulse in the line. Construct an appropriate
voltage reﬂection diagram for this case and use it to make a plot of the

his chapter is concerned with the application of Maxwell’s equations to the
problem of electromagnetic wave propagation. The uniform plane wave rep-
resents the simplest case, and while it is appropriate for an introduction, it is
of great practical importance. Waves encountered in practice can often be assumed
to be of this form. In this study, we will explore the basic principles of electromag-
netic wave propagation, and we will come to understand the physical processes that
determine the speed of propagation and the extent to which attenuation may occur.
We will derive and use the Poynting theorem to ﬁnd the power carried by a wave.
Finally, we will learn how to describe wave polarization. ■
11.1
WAVE PROPAGATION IN FREE SPACE
We begin with a quick study of Maxwell’s equations, in which we look for clues
of wave phenomena. In Chapter 10, we saw how voltages and currents propagate as
waves in transmission lines, and we know that the existence of voltages and currents
implies the existence of electric and magnetic ﬁelds. So we can identify a transmission
line as a structure that conﬁnes the ﬁelds while enabling them to travel along its length
as waves. It can be argued that it is the ﬁelds that generate the voltage and current
in a transmission line wave, and—if there is no structure on which the voltage and
current can exist—the ﬁelds will exist nevertheless, and will propagate. In free space,
the ﬁelds are not bounded by any conﬁning structure, and so they may assume any
magnitude and direction, as initially determined by the device (such as an antenna)
that generates them.
When considering electromagnetic waves in free space, we note that the medium
is sourceless (ρν = J = 0). Under these conditions, Maxwell’s equations may be
367

368
ENGINEERING ELECTROMAGNETICS
written in terms of E and H only as
∇× H = ϵ0
∂E
∂t
(1)
∇× E = −µ0
∂H
∂t
(2)
∇· E = 0
(3)
∇· H = 0
(4)
Now let us see whether wave motion can be inferred from these four equations
without actually solving them. Equation (1) states that if electric ﬁeld E is changing
with time at some point, then magnetic ﬁeld H has curl at that point; therefore H varies
spatially in a direction normal to its orientation direction. Also, if E is changing with
time, then H will in general also change with time, although not necessarily in the
same way. Next, we see from Eq. (2) that a time-varying H generates E, which,
having curl, varies spatially in the direction normal to its orientation. We now have
once more a changing electric ﬁeld, our original hypothesis, but this ﬁeld is present
a small distance away from the point of the original disturbance. We might guess
(correctly) that the velocity with which the effect moves away from the original point
is the velocity of light, but this must be checked by a more detailed examination of
Maxwell’s equations.
We postulate the existence of a uniform plane wave, in which both ﬁelds, E and
H, lie in the transverse plane—that is, the plane whose normal is the direction of
propagation. Furthermore, and by deﬁnition, both ﬁelds are of constant magnitude in
the transverse plane. For this reason, such a wave is sometimes called a transverse
electromagnetic (TEM) wave. The required spatial variation of both ﬁelds in the
direction normal to their orientations will therefore occur only in the direction of
travel—or normal to the transverse plane. Assume, for example, that E = Exax, or
that the electric ﬁeld is polarized in the x direction. If we further assume that wave
travel is in the z direction, we allow spatial variation of E only with z. Using Eq. (2),
we note that with these restrictions, the curl of E reduces to a single term:
∇× E = ∂Ex
∂z ay = −µ0
∂H
∂t = −µ0
∂Hy
∂t ay
(5)
The direction of the curl of E in (5) determines the direction of H, which we observe
to be along the y direction. Therefore, in a uniform plane wave, the directions of E and
H and the direction of travel are mutually orthogonal. Using the y-directed magnetic
ﬁeld, and the fact that it varies only in z, simpliﬁes Eq. (1) to read
∇× H = −∂Hy
∂z ax = ϵ0
∂E
∂t = ϵ0
∂Ex
∂t ax
(6)

CHAPTER 11
The Uniform Plane Wave

Equations (5) and (6) can be more succinctly written:
∂Ex
∂z
= −µ0
∂Hy
∂t
(7)
∂Hy
∂z
= −ϵ0
∂Ex
∂t
(8)
These equations compare directly with the telegraphist’s equations for the lossless
transmission line [Eqs. (20) and (21) in Chapter 10]. Further manipulations of (7)
and (8) proceed in the same manner as was done with the telegraphist’s equations.
Speciﬁcally, we differentiate (7) with respect to z, obtaining:
∂2Ex
∂z2
= −µ0
∂2Hy
∂t∂z
(9)
Then, (8) is differentiated with respect to t:
∂2Hy
∂z∂t = −ϵ0
∂2Ex
∂t2
(10)
Substituting (10) into (9) results in
∂2Ex
∂z2
= µ0ϵ0
∂2Ex
∂t2
(11)
This equation, in direct analogy to Eq. (13) in Chapter 10, we identify as the wave
equation for our x-polarized TEM electric ﬁeld in free space. From Eq. (11), we
further identify the propagation velocity:
ν =
1
√µ0ϵ0
= 3 × 108 m/s = c
(12)
where c denotes the velocity of light in free space. A similar procedure, involving
differentiating (7) with t and (8) with z, yields the wave equation for the magnetic
ﬁeld; it is identical in form to (11):
∂2Hy
∂z2
= µ0ϵ0
∂2Hy
∂t2
(13)
As was discussed in Chapter 10, the solution to equations of the form of (11) and
(13) will be forward- and backward-propagating waves having the general form [in
this case for Eq. (11)]:
Ex(z, t) = f1(t −z/ν) + f2(t + z/ν)
(14)
where again f1 amd f2 can be any function whose argument is of the form t ± z/ν.
From here, we immediately specialize to sinusoidal functions of a speciﬁed fre-
quencyandwritethesolutionto(11)intheformofforward-andbackward-propagating

cosines. Because the waves are sinusoidal, we denote their velocity as the phase ve-
locity, νp. The waves are written as:
Ex(z, t) = Ex(z, t) + E′
x(z, t)
= |Ex0| cos [ω(t −z/νp) + φ1] + |E′
x0| cos [ω(t + z/νp) + φ2]

(15)
In writing the second line of (15), we have used the fact that the waves are traveling in
free space, in which case the phase velocity, νp = c. Additionally, the wavenumber
in free space in deﬁned as
k0 ≡ω
c rad/m
(16)
In a manner consistant with our transmission line studies, we refer to the solutions
expressed in (15) as the real instantaneous forms of the electric ﬁeld. They are the
mathematical representations of what one would experimentally measure. The terms
ωt and k0z, appearing in (15), have units of angle and are usually expressed in radians.
We know that ω is the radian time frequency, measuring phase shift per unit time;
it has units of rad/s. In a similar way, we see that k0 will be interpreted as a spatial
frequency, which in the present case measures the phase shift per unit distance along
the z direction in rad/m. We note that k0 is the phase constant for lossless propagation
of uniform plane waves in free space. The wavelength in free space is the distance
over which the spatial phase shifts by 2π radians, assuming ﬁxed time, or
k0z = k0λ = 2π
→
λ = 2π
k0
(free space)
(17)
The manner in which the waves propagate is the same as we encountered in
transmission lines. Speciﬁcally, suppose we consider some point (such as a wave
crest) on the forward-propagating cosine function of Eq. (15). For a crest to occur,
the argument of the cosine must be an integer multiple of 2π. Considering the mth
crest of the wave, the condition becomes
k0z = 2mπ
So let us now consider the point on the cosine that we have chosen, and see what
happens as time is allowed to increase. Our requirement is that the entire cosine
argument be the same multiple of 2π for all time, in order to keep track of the chosen
point. Our condition becomes
ωt −k0z = ω(t −z/c) = 2mπ
(18)
As time increases, the position z must also increase in order to satisfy (18). The wave
crest (and the entire wave) moves in the positive z direction at phase velocity c (in
free space). Using similar reasoning, the wave in Eq. (15) having cosine argument
(ωt + k0z) describes a wave that moves in the negative z direction, since as time

increases, z must now decrease to keep the argument constant. For simplicity, we will
restrict our attention in this chapter to only the positive z traveling wave.
As was done for transmission line waves, we express the real instantaneous ﬁelds
of Eq. (15) in terms of their phasor forms. Using the forward-propagating ﬁeld in (15),
we write:
Ex(z, t) = 1
2|Ex0|e jφ1



Ex0
e−jk0ze jωt + c.c. = 1
2 Exse jωt + c.c. = Re[Exse jωt]
(19)
where c.c. denotes the complex conjugate, and where we identify the phasor electric
ﬁeld as Exs = Ex0e−jk0z. As indicated in (19), Ex0 is the complex amplitude (which
includes the phase, φ1).
EXAMPLE 11.1
Let us express Ey(z, t) = 100 cos(108t −0.5z + 30◦) V/m as a phasor.
Solution. We ﬁrst go to exponential notation,
Ey(z, t) = Re

100e j(108t−0.5z+30◦)
and then drop Re and suppress e j108t, obtaining the phasor
Eys(z) = 100e−j0.5z+ j30◦
Note that a mixed nomenclature is used for the angle in this case; that is, 0.5z is in
radians, while 30◦is in degrees. Given a scalar component or a vector expressed as a
phasor, we may easily recover the time-domain expression.
EXAMPLE 11.2
Given the complex amplitude of the electric ﬁeld of a uniform plane wave, E0 =
100ax +20̸ 30◦ay V/m, construct the phasor and real instantaneous ﬁelds if the wave
is known to propagate in the forward z direction in free space and has frequency of
10 MHz.
Solution. We begin by constructing the general phasor expression:
Es(z) =

100ax + 20e j30◦ay

e−jk0z
where k0 = ω/c = 2π × 107/3 × 108 = 0.21 rad/m. The real instantaneous form is
then found through the rule expressed in Eq. (19):
E(z, t) = Re

100e−j0.21ze j2π×107tax + 20e j30◦e−j0.21ze j2π×107tay


= 100 cos (2π × 107t −0.21z)ax + 20 cos (2π × 107t −0.21z + 30◦) ay

372
ENGINEERING ELECTROMAGNETICS
It is evident that taking the partial derivative of any ﬁeld quantity with respect
to time is equivalent to multiplying the corresponding phasor by jω. As an example,
we can express Eq. (8) (using sinusoidal ﬁelds) as
∂Hy
∂z
= −ϵ0
∂Ex

(20)
where, in a manner consistent with (19):
Ex(z, t) = 1
2 Exs(z) e jωt + c.c.
and
Hy(z, t) = 1
2 Hys(z) e jωt + c.c.

On substituting the ﬁelds in (21) into (20), the latter equation simpliﬁes to

= −jωϵ0Exs(z)
(22)
In obtaining this equation, we note ﬁrst that the complex conjugate terms in (21)
produce their own separate equation, redundant with (22); second, the e jωt factors,
common to both sides, have divided out; third, the partial derivative with z becomes
the total derivative, since the phasor, Hys, depends only on z.
We next apply this result to Maxwell’s equations, to obtain them in phasor form.
Substituting the ﬁeld as expressed in (21) into Eqs. (1) through (4) results in
∇× Hs = jωϵ0Es
(23)
∇× Es = −jωµ0Hs
(24)
∇· Es = 0
(25)
∇· Hs = 0
(26)
It should be noted that (25) and (26) are no longer independent relationships, for they
can be obtained by taking the divergence of (23) and (24), respectively.
Eqs. (23) through (26) may be used to obtain the sinusoidal steady-state vector
form of the wave equation in free space. We begin by taking the curl of both sides
of (24):
∇× ∇× Es = −jωµ0∇× Hs = ∇(∇· Es) −∇2Es
(27)
where the last equality is an identity, which deﬁnes the vector Laplacian of Es:
∇2Es = ∇(∇· Es) −∇× ∇× Es
From (25), we note that ∇· Es = 0. Using this, and substituting (23) in (27), we
obtain
∇2Es = −k2
0Es

where again, k0 = ω/c = ω√µ0ϵ0. Equation (28) is known as the vector Helmholtz
equation in free space.1 It is fairly formidable when expanded, even in rectangular
coordinates, for three scalar phasor equations result (one for each vector component),
and each equation has four terms. The x component of (28) becomes, still using the
del-operator notation,
∇2Exs = −k2

Let us now return to Maxwell’s equations, (23) through (26), and determine the
form of the H ﬁeld. Given Es, Hs is most easily obtained from (24):

In general, we ﬁnd from (32) that the electric and magnetic ﬁeld amplitudes of
the forward-propagating wave in free space are related through

(34b)
where the intrinsic impedance of free space is deﬁned as
η0 =
µ0
ϵ0
= 377 .= 120π 
(35)
The dimension of η0 in ohms is immediately evident from its deﬁnition as the ratio of
E (in units of V/m) to H (in units of A/m). It is in direct analogy to the characteristic
impedance, Z0, of a transmission line, where we deﬁned the latter as the ratio of
voltage to current in a traveling wave. We note that the difference between (34a) and
(34b) is a minus sign. This is consistent with the transmission line analogy that led to
Eqs. (25a) and (25b) in Chapter 10. Those equations accounted for the deﬁnitions of
positive and negative current associated with forward and backward voltage waves. In
a similar way, Eq. (34a) speciﬁes that in a forward-z propagating uniform plane wave
whose electric ﬁeld vector lies in the positive x direction at a given point in time and
space, the magnetic ﬁeld vector lies in the positive y direction at the same space and
time coordinates. In the case of a backward-z propagating wave having a positive
x-directed electric ﬁeld, the magnetic ﬁeld vector lies in the negative y direction. The
physical signiﬁcance of this has to do with the deﬁnition of power ﬂow in the wave,
as speciﬁed through the Poynting vector, S = E×H (in watts/m2). The cross product
of E with H must give the correct wave propagation direction, and so the need for
the minus sign in (34b) is apparent. Issues relating to power transmission will be
addressed in Section 11.3.
Some feeling for the way in which the ﬁelds vary in space may be obtained from
Figures 11.1a and 11.1b. The electric ﬁeld intensity in Figure 11.1a is shown at t = 0,
and the instantaneous value of the ﬁeld is depicted along three lines, the z axis and
arbitrary lines parallel to the z axis in the x = 0 and y = 0 planes. Since the ﬁeld
is uniform in planes perpendicular to the z axis, the variation along all three of the
lines is the same. One complete cycle of the variation occurs in a wavelength, λ. The
values of Hy at the same time and positions are shown in Figure 11.1b.
A uniform plane wave cannot exist physically, for it extends to inﬁnity in two
dimensions at least and represents an inﬁnite amount of energy. The distant ﬁeld of
a transmitting antenna, however, is essentially a uniform plane wave in some limited
region; for example, a radar signal impinging on a distant target is closely a uniform
plane wave.

(a) Arrows represent the instantaneous values of Ex0 cos[ω(t −z/c)] at
t = 0 along the z axis, along an arbitrary line in the x = 0 plane parallel to the z axis, and

of Hy are indicated. Note that Ex and Hy are in phase at any point in time.
Although we have considered only a wave varying sinusoidally in time and
space, a suitable combination of solutions to the wave equation may be made to
achieve a wave of any desired form, but which satisﬁes (14). The summation of
an inﬁnite number of harmonics through the use of a Fourier series can produce a
periodic wave of square or triangular shape in both space and time. Nonperiodic
waves may be obtained from our basic solution by Fourier integral methods. These
topics are among those considered in the more advanced books on electromagnetic
theory.

11.2
WAVE PROPAGATION IN DIELECTRICS
We now extend our analytical treatment of the uniform plane wave to propagation
in a dielectric of permittivity ϵ and permeability µ. The medium is assumed to be
homogeneous (having constant µ and ϵ with position) and isotropic (in which µ and

376
ENGINEERING ELECTROMAGNETICS
ϵ are invariant with ﬁeld orientation). The Helmholtz equation is
∇2Es = −k2Es
(36)
wherethewavenumberisafunctionofthematerialproperties,asdescribedbyµandϵ:
k = ω√µϵ = k0
√µrϵr
(37)
For Exs we have
d2Exs
dz2
= −k2Exs
(38)
An important feature of wave propagation in a dielectric is that k can be complex-
valued, and as such it is referred to as the complex propagation constant. A general
solution of (38), in fact, allows the possibility of a complex k, and it is customary to
write it in terms of its real and imaginary parts in the following way:
jk = α + jβ
(39)
A solution to (38) will be:
Exs = Ex0e−jkz = Ex0e−αze−jβz
(40)
Multiplying (40) by e jωt and taking the real part yields a form of the ﬁeld that can
be more easily visualized:
Ex = Ex0e−αz cos(ωt −βz)
(41)
We recognize this as a uniform plane wave that propagates in the forward z direction
with phase constant β, but which (for positive α) loses amplitude with increasing z
according to the factor e−αz. Thus the general effect of a complex-valued k is to yield a
traveling wave that changes its amplitude with distance. If α is positive, it is called the
attenuationcoefﬁcient.Ifα isnegative,thewavegrowsinamplitudewithdistance,and
α is called the gain coefﬁcient. The latter effect would occur, for example, in laser am-
pliﬁers.Inthepresentandfuturediscussionsinthisbook,wewillconsideronlypassive
media, in which one or more loss mechanisms are present, thus producing a positive α.
The attenuation coefﬁcient is measured in nepers per meter (Np/m) so that the
exponent of e can be measured in the dimensionless units of nepers. Thus, if α =
0.01 Np/m, the crest amplitude of the wave at z = 50 m will be e−0.5/e−0 = 0.607
of its value at z = 0. In traveling a distance 1/α in the +z direction, the amplitude of
the wave is reduced by the familiar factor of e−1, or 0.368.
The ways in which physical processes in a material can affect the wave electric
ﬁeld are described through a complex permittivity of the form
ϵ = ϵ′ −jϵ′′ = ϵ0(ϵ′
r −jϵ′′
r )
(42)

CHAPTER 11
The Uniform Plane Wave
377
Two important mechanisms that give rise to a complex permittivity (and thus result
in wave losses) are bound electron or ion oscillations and dipole relaxation, both of
which are discussed in Appendix E. An additional mechanism is the conduction of
free electrons or holes, which we will explore at length in this chapter.
Losses arising from the response of the medium to the magnetic ﬁeld can occur
as well, and these are modeled through a complex permeability, µ = µ′ −jµ′′ =
µ0(µ′
r −jµ′′
r ). Examples of such media include ferrimagnetic materials, or ferrites.
The magnetic response is usually very weak compared to the dielectric response in
most materials of interest for wave propagation; in such materials µ ≈µ0. Con-
sequently, our discussion of loss mechanisms will be conﬁned to those described
through the complex permittivity, and we will assume that µ is entirely real in our
treatment.
We can substitute (42) into (37), which results in
k = ω

µ(ϵ′ −jϵ′′) = ω

(43)
Note the presence of the second radical factor in (43), which becomes unity (and
real) as ϵ′′ vanishes. With nonzero ϵ′′, k is complex, and so losses occur which are
quantiﬁed through the attenuation coefﬁcient, α, in (39). The phase constant, β (and
consequently the wavelength and phase velocity), will also be affected by ϵ′′. α and
β are found by taking the real and imaginary parts of jk from (43). We obtain:
α = Re{ jk} = ω

We see that a nonzero α (and hence loss) results if the imaginary part of the
permittivity, ϵ′′, is present. We also observe in (44) and (45) the presence of the ratio
ϵ′′/ϵ′, which is called the loss tangent. The meaning of the term will be demonstrated
when we investigate the speciﬁc case of conductive media. The practical importance
of the ratio lies in its magnitude compared to unity, which enables simpliﬁcations to
be made in (44) and (45).
Whether or not losses occur, we see from (41) that the wave phase velocity is
given by
νp = ω
β
(46)
The wavelength is the distance required to effect a phase change of 2π radians

The electric and magnetic ﬁelds are no longer in phase.

and so ϵ = ϵ′. From (44), this leads to α = 0, and from (45),

The two ﬁelds are once again perpendicular to each other, perpendicular to the
direction of propagation, and in phase with each other everywhere. Note that when E
is crossed into H, the resultant vector is in the direction of propagation. We shall see
the reason for this when we discuss the Poynting vector.
EXAMPLE 11.3
Let us apply these results to a 1-MHz plane wave propagating in fresh water. At
this frequency, losses in water are negligible, which means that we can assume that
ϵ′′ .= 0. In water, µr = 1 and at 1 MHz, ϵ′
r = 81.

EXAMPLE 11.4
We again consider plane wave propagation in water, but at the much higher micro-
wave frequency of 2.5 GHz. At frequencies in this range and higher, dipole relaxation
and resonance phenomena in the water molecules become important.2 Real and imagi-
nary parts of the permittivity are present, and both vary with frequency. At frequencies
below that of visible light, the two mechanisms together produce a value of ϵ′′ that
increases with increasing frequency, reaching a maximum in the vicinity of 1013 Hz.
ϵ′ decreases with increasing frequency, reaching a minimum also in the vicinity of
1013 Hz. Reference 3 provides speciﬁc details. At 2.5 GHz, dipole relaxation effects
dominate. The permittivity values are ϵ′
r = 78 and ϵ′′

This ﬁrst calculation demonstrates the operating principle of the microwave oven.
Almost all foods contain water, and so they can be cooked when incident microwave
radiation is absorbed and converted into heat. Note that the ﬁeld will attenuate to a
value of e−1 times its initial value at a distance of 1/α = 4.8 cm. This distance is called
the penetration depth of the material, and of course it is frequency-dependent. The
4.8 cm depth is reasonable for cooking food, since it would lead to a temperature rise
that is fairly uniform throughout the depth of the material. At much higher frequencies,
where ϵ′′ is larger, the penetration depth decreases, and too much power is absorbed
at the surface; at lower frequencies, the penetration depth increases, and not enough
overall absorption occurs. Commercial microwave ovens operate at frequencies in the
vicinity of 2.5 GHz.
Using (45), in a calculation very similar to that for α, we ﬁnd β = 464 rad/m.
The wavelength is λ = 2π/β = 1.4 cm, whereas in free space this would have been
λ0 = c/f = 12 cm.

√1 −j(7/78) = 43 + j1.9 = 43̸ 2.6◦
and Ex leads Hy in time by 2.6◦at every point.
We next consider the case of conductive materials, in which currents are formed
by the motion of free electrons or holes under the inﬂuence of an electric ﬁeld.
The governing relation is J = σE, where σ is the material conductivity. With ﬁnite
conductivity, the wave loses power through resistive heating of the material. We look
for an interpretation of the complex permittivity as it relates to the conductivity.
2 These mechanisms and how they produce a complex permittivity are described in Appendix D.
Additionally, the reader is referred to pp. 73–84 in Reference 1 and pp. 678–82 in Reference 2 for
general treatments of relaxation and resonance effects on wave propagation. Discussions and data that
are speciﬁc to water are presented in Reference 3, pp. 314–16.

CHAPTER 11
The Uniform Plane Wave
381
Consider the Maxwell curl equation (23) which, using (42), becomes:
∇× Hs = jω(ϵ′ −jϵ′′)Es = ωϵ′′Es + jωϵ′Es
(53)
This equation can be expressed in a more familiar way, in which conduction current
is included:
∇× Hs = Js + jωϵEs
(54)
We next use Js = σEs, and interpret ϵ in (54) as ϵ′. The latter equation becomes:
∇× Hs = (σ + jωϵ′)Es = Jσs + Jds
(55)
which we have expressed in terms of conduction current density, Jσs = σEs, and
displacement current density, Jds = jωϵ′Es. Comparing Eqs. (53) and (55), we ﬁnd
that in a conductive medium:
ϵ′′ = σ
ω
(56)
Let us now turn our attention to the case of a dielectric material in which the loss
is very small. The criterion by which we should judge whether or not the loss is small
is the magnitude of the loss tangent, ϵ′′/ϵ′. This parameter will have a direct inﬂuence
on the attenuation coefﬁcient, α, as seen from Eq. (44). In the case of conducting
media, to which (56) applies, the loss tangent becomes σ/ωϵ′. By inspecting (55),
we see that the ratio of conduction current density to displacement current density
magnitudes is
Jσs
Jds
= ϵ′′
jϵ′ =
σ
jωϵ′
(57)
That is, these two vectors point in the same direction in space, but they are 90◦out of
phase in time. Displacement current density leads conduction current density by 90◦,
just as the current through a capacitor leads the current through a resistor in parallel
with it by 90◦in an ordinary electric circuit. This phase relationship is shown in
Figure 11.2. The angle θ (not to be confused with the polar angle in spherical
coordinates) may therefore be identiﬁed as the angle by which the displacement
current density leads the total current density, and
tan θ = ϵ′′
ϵ′ = σ
ωϵ′
(58)
The reasoning behind the term loss tangent is thus evident. Problem 11.16 at the end
of the chapter indicates that the Q of a capacitor (its quality factor, not its charge)
that incorporates a lossy dielectric is the reciprocal of the loss tangent.
If the loss tangent is small, then we may obtain useful approximations for the
attenuation and phase constants, and the intrinsic impedance. The criterion for a small
loss tangent is ϵ′′/ϵ′ ≪1, which we say identiﬁes the medium as a good dielectric.

In this comparison, we associate σ with G, µ with L, and ϵ with C. Note that in
plane wave propagation in media with no boundaries, there can be no quantity that is
analogous to the transmission line conductor resistance parameter, R. In many cases,

The conditions under which these approximations can be used depend on the

As a comparison, we repeat the computations of Example 11.4, using the approxima-
tion formulas (60a), (61), and (62b).

verify by repeating the calculations of both examples and expressing the results to four
or ﬁve signiﬁcant ﬁgures. As we know, this latter practice would not be meaningful
because the given parameters were not speciﬁed with such accuracy. Such is often the
case, since measured values are not always known with high precision. Depending
on how precise these values are, one can sometimes use a more relaxed judgment on
when the approximation formulas can be used by allowing loss tangent values that
can be larger than 0.1 (but still less than 1).

POYNTING’S THEOREM
AND WAVE POWER
In order to ﬁnd the power ﬂow associated with an electromagnetic wave, it is necessary
to develop a power theorem for the electromagnetic ﬁeld known as the Poynting the-
orem. It was originally postulated in 1884 by an English physicist, John H. Poynting.
The development begins with one of Maxwell’s curl equations, in which we
assume that the medium may be conductive:
∇× H = J + ∂D
∂t
(63)
Next, we take the scalar product of both sides of (63) with E,
E · ∇× H = E · J + E · ∂D
∂t
(64)
We then introduce the following vector identity, which may be proved by expansion
in rectangular coordinates:
∇· (E × H) = −E · ∇× H + H · ∇× E
(65)
Using (65) in the left side of (64) results in
H · ∇× E −∇· (E × H) = J · E + E · ∂D
∂t
(66)
where the curl of the electric ﬁeld is given by the other Maxwell curl equation:
∇× E = −∂B
∂t
Therefore
−H · ∂B
∂t −∇· (E × H) = J · E + E · ∂D
∂t
or
−∇· (E × H) = J · E + ϵE · ∂E
∂t + µH · ∂H
∂t
(67)

The two time derivatives in (67) can be rearranged as follows:

and

The divergence theorem is then applied to the left-hand side, thus converting the
volume integral there into an integral over the surface that encloses the volume. On
the right-hand side, the operations of spatial integration and time differentiation are
interchanged. The ﬁnal result is

Equation (70) is known as Poynting’s theorem. On the right-hand side, the ﬁrst
integral is the total (but instantaneous) ohmic power dissipated within the volume. The
second integral is the total energy stored in the electric ﬁeld, and the third integral is
the stored energy in the magnetic ﬁeld.3 Since time derivatives are taken of the second
and third integrals, those results give the time rates of increase of energy stored within
the volume, or the instantaneous power going to increase the stored energy. The sum
of the expressions on the right must therefore be the total power ﬂowing into this
volume, and so the total power ﬂowing out of the volume is

power ﬂow at a point, and many of us think of the Poynting vector as a “pointing”
vector. This homonym, while accidental, is correct.4
Because S is given by the cross product of E and H, the direction of power ﬂow
at any point is normal to both the E and H vectors. This certainly agrees with our
experience with the uniform plane wave, for propagation in the +z direction was
associated with an Ex and Hy component,
Exax × Hyay = Szaz
In a perfect dielectric, the E and H ﬁeld amplitudes are given by
Ex = Ex0 cos(ωt −βz)
Hy = Ex0
η cos(ωt −βz)
where η is real. The power density amplitude is therefore
Sz = E2
x0
η cos2(ωt −βz)
(73)
In the case of a lossy dielectric, Ex and Hy are not in time phase. We have
Ex = Ex0e−αz cos(ωt −βz)
If we let
η = |η|̸ θη
then we may write the magnetic ﬁeld intensity as
Hy = Ex0
|η| e−αz cos(ωt −βz −θη)
Thus,
Sz = Ex Hy = E2
x0
|η| e−2αz cos(ωt −βz) cos(ωt −βz −θη)
(74)
Because we are dealing with a sinusoidal signal, the time-average power density,
⟨Sz⟩, is the quantity that will ultimately be measured. To ﬁnd this, we integrate (74)
over one cycle and divide by the period T = 1/f . Additionally, the identity cos
A cos B = 1/2 cos(A + B) + 1/2 cos(A −B) is applied to the integrand, and we
obtain:

4 Note that the vector symbol S is used for the Poynting vector, and is not to be confused with the
differential area vector, dS. The latter, as we know, is the product of the outward normal to the surface
and the differential area.

CHAPTER 11

The second-harmonic component of the integrand in (75) integrates to zero, leaving
only the contribution from the dc component. The result is

Note that the power density attenuates as e−2αz, whereas Ex and Hy fall off as e−αz.

by using the phasor forms of the electric and magnetic ﬁelds. In vector form, this is

PROPAGATION IN GOOD
CONDUCTORS: SKIN EFFECT
As an additional study of propagation with loss, we will investigate the behavior of a
good conductor when a uniform plane wave is established in it. Such a material sat-
isﬁes the general high-loss criterion, in which the loss tangent, ϵ′′/ϵ′ ≫1. Applying
this to a good conductor leads to the more speciﬁc criterion, σ/(ωϵ′) ≫1. As before,
we have an interest in losses that occur on wave transmission into a good conductor,
and we will ﬁnd new approximations for the phase constant, attenuation coefﬁcient,
and intrinsic impedance. New to us, however, is a modiﬁcation of the basic problem,
appropriate for good conductors. This concerns waves associated with electromag-
netic ﬁelds existing in an external dielectric that adjoins the conductor surface; in
this case, the waves propagate along the surface. That portion of the overall ﬁeld that
exists within the conductor will suffer dissipative loss arising from the conduction
currents it generates. The overall ﬁeld therefore attenuates with increasing distance

388
ENGINEERING ELECTROMAGNETICS
of travel along the surface. This is the mechanism for the resistive transmission line
loss that we studied in Chapter 10, and which is embodied in the line resistance
parameter, R.
As implied, a good conductor has a high conductivity and large conduction
currents. The energy represented by the wave traveling through the material therefore
decreases as the wave propagates because ohmic losses are continuously present.
When we discussed the loss tangent, we saw that the ratio of conduction current
density to the displacement current density in a conducting material is given by
σ/ωϵ′.Choosingapoormetallicconductorandaveryhighfrequencyasaconservative
example, this ratio5 for nichrome (σ .= 106) at 100 MHz is about 2 × 108. We therefore
have a situation where σ/ωϵ′ ≫1, and we should be able to make several very good
approximations to ﬁnd α, β, and η for a good conductor.
The general expression for the propagation constant is, from (59),

Regardless of the parameters µ and σ of the conductor or of the frequency of the

5 It is customary to take ϵ′ = ϵ0 for metallic conductors.

CHAPTER 11

We may tie this ﬁeld in the conductor to an external ﬁeld at the conductor surface.
We let the region z > 0 be the good conductor and the region z < 0 be a perfect
dielectric. At the boundary surface z = 0, (80) becomes
Ex = Ex0 cos ωt
(z = 0)
This we shall consider as the source ﬁeld that establishes the ﬁelds within the con-
ductor. Since displacement current is negligible,
J = σE
Thus, the conduction current density at any point within the conductor is directly
related to E:

(81)
Equations (80) and (81) contain a wealth of information. Considering ﬁrst the
negative exponential term, we ﬁnd an exponential decrease in the conduction current
density and electric ﬁeld intensity with penetration into the conductor (away from the
source). The exponential factor is unity at z = 0 and decreases to e−1 = 0.368 when
z =
1
√π fµσ
This distance is denoted by δ and is termed the depth of penetration, or the skin depth,
δ =
1
√π f µσ = 1
α = 1
β
(82)
It is an important parameter in describing conductor behavior in electromagnetic
ﬁelds. To get some idea of the magnitude of the skin depth, let us consider copper,
σ = 5.8 × 107 S/m, at several different frequencies. We have
δCu = 0.066
√f
At a power frequency of 60 Hz, δCu = 8.53 mm. Remembering that the power density
carries an exponential term e−2αz, we see that the power density is multiplied by a
factor of 0.3682 = 0.135 for every 8.53 mm of distance into the copper.
At a microwave frequency of 10,000 MHz, δ is 6.61 × 10−4 mm. Stated more
generally, all ﬁelds in a good conductor such as copper are essentially zero at distances
greater than a few skin depths from the surface. Any current density or electric ﬁeld
intensity established at the surface of a good conductor decays rapidly as we progress
into the conductor. Electromagnetic energy is not transmitted in the interior of a
conductor; it travels in the region surrounding the conductor, while the conductor
merely guides the waves. We will consider guided propagation in more detail in
Chapter 13.
Suppose we have a copper bus bar in the substation of an electric utility company
which we wish to have carry large currents, and we therefore select dimensions of 2
by 4 inches. Then much of the copper is wasted, for the ﬁelds are greatly reduced in

390
ENGINEERING ELECTROMAGNETICS
one skin depth, about 8.5 mm.6 A hollow conductor with a wall thickness of about
12 mm would be a much better design. Although we are applying the results of an
analysis for an inﬁnite planar conductor to one of ﬁnite dimensions, the ﬁelds are
attenuated in the ﬁnite-size conductor in a similar (but not identical) fashion.
The extremely short skin depth at microwave frequencies shows that only the sur-
face coating of the guiding conductor is important. A piece of glass with an evaporated
silver surface 3 µm thick is an excellent conductor at these frequencies.
Next, let us determine expressions for the velocity and wavelength within a good
conductor. From (82), we already have
α = β = 1
δ =

π f µσ
Then, as
β = 2π
λ
we ﬁnd the wavelength to be
λ = 2πδ
(83)
Also, recalling that
νp = ω
β
we have
νp = ωδ
(84)
For copper at 60 Hz, λ = 5.36 cm and νp = 3.22 m/s, or about 7.2 mi/h! A lot of us
can run faster than that. In free space, of course, a 60 Hz wave has a wavelength of
3100 mi and travels at the velocity of light.
EXAMPLE 11.6
Let us again consider wave propagation in water, but this time we will consider
seawater. The primary difference between seawater and fresh water is of course the
salt content. Sodium chloride dissociates in water to form Na+ and Cl−ions, which,
being charged, will move when forced by an electric ﬁeld. Seawater is thus conductive,
and so it will attenuate electromagnetic waves by this mechanism. At frequencies
in the vicinity of 107 Hz and below, the bound charge effects in water discussed
earlier are negligible, and losses in seawater arise principally from the salt-associated
conductivity. We consider an incident wave of frequency 1 MHz. We wish to ﬁnd the
skin depth, wavelength, and phase velocity. In seawater, σ = 4 S/m, and ϵ′
r = 81.
6 This utility company operates at 60 Hz.

CHAPTER 11

Solution. We ﬁrst evaluate the loss tangent, using the given data:
σ
ωϵ′ =
4
(2π × 106)(81)(8.85 × 10−12) = 8.9 × 102 ≫1
Seawater is therefore a good conductor at 1 MHz (and at frequencies lower than this).
The skin depth is
δ =
1
√π f µσ =
1

(π × 106)(4π × 10−7)(4)
= 0.25 m = 25 cm
Now
λ = 2πδ = 1.6 m
and
νp = ωδ = (2π × 106)(0.25) = 1.6 × 106 m/sec
In free space, these values would have been λ = 300 m and of course ν = c.
With a 25-cm skin depth, it is obvious that radio frequency communication in
seawater is quite impractical. Notice, however, that δ varies as 1/√f , so that things
will improve at lower frequencies. For example, if we use a frequency of 10 Hz (in
the ELF, or extremely low frequency range), the skin depth is increased over that at
1 MHz by a factor of

106/10, so that
δ(10 Hz)
.= 80 m
The corresponding wavelength is λ = 2πδ .= 500 m. Frequencies in the ELF range
were used for many years in submarine communications. Signals were transmitted
from gigantic ground-based antennas (required because the free-space wavelength
associated with 10 Hz is 3 × 107 m). The signals were then received by submarines,
from which a suspended wire antenna of length shorter than 500 m is sufﬁcient. The
drawback is that signal data rates at ELF are slow enough that a single word can
take several minutes to transmit. Typically, ELF signals would be used to tell the
submarine to initiate emergency procedures, or to come near the surface in order to
receive a more detailed message via satellite.
We next turn our attention to ﬁnding the magnetic ﬁeld, Hy, associated with Ex.
To do so, we need an expression for the intrinsic impedance of a good conductor. We
begin with Eq. (48), Section 11.2, with ϵ′′ = σ/ω,
η =

jωµ
σ + jωϵ′
Since σ ≫ωϵ′, we have

(89)
Comparing (88) and (89), we see that they are identical. Thus the average power
loss in a conductor with skin effect present may be calculated by assuming that the
total current is distributed uniformly in one skin depth. In terms of resistance, we may
say that the resistance of a width b and length L of an inﬁnitely thick slab with skin
effect is the same as the resistance of a rectangular slab of width b, length L, and
thickness δ without skin effect, or with uniform current distribution.
We may apply this to a conductor of circular cross section with little error,
provided that the radius a is much greater than the skin depth. The resistance at
a high frequency where there is a well-developed skin effect is therefore found by
considering a slab of width equal to the circumference 2πa and thickness δ. Hence

WAVE POLARIZATION
In the previous sections, we have treated uniform plane waves in which the electric
and magnetic ﬁeld vectors were assumed to lie in ﬁxed directions. Speciﬁcally, with
the wave propagating along the z axis, E was taken to lie along x, which then required
H to lie along y. This orthogonal relationship between E, H, and S is always true for
a uniform plane wave. The directions of E and H within the plane perpendicular to az

CHAPTER 11
The Uniform Plane Wave

may change, however, as functions of time and position, depending on how the wave
was generated or on what type of medium it is propagating through. Thus a complete
description of an electromagnetic wave would not only include parameters such as
its wavelength, phase velocity, and power, but also a statement of the instantaneous
orientation of its ﬁeld vectors. We deﬁne the wave polarization as the time-dependent
electric ﬁeld vector orientation at a ﬁxed point in space. A more complete character-
ization of a wave’s polarization would in fact include specifying the ﬁeld orientation
at all points because some waves demonstrate spatial variations in their polarization.
Specifying only the electric ﬁeld direction is sufﬁcient, since magnetic ﬁeld is readily
found from E using Maxwell’s equations.
In the waves we have previously studied, E was in a ﬁxed straight orientation for
all times and positions. Such a wave is said to be linearly polarized. We have taken E
to lie along the x axis, but the ﬁeld could be oriented in any ﬁxed direction in the xy
plane and be linearly polarized. For positive z propagation, the wave would in general
have its electric ﬁeld phasor expressed as
Es = (Ex0ax + Ey0ay)e−αze−jβz
(91)
where Ex0 and Ey0 are constant amplitudes along x and y. The magnetic ﬁeld is readily
found by determining its x and y components directly from those of Es. Speciﬁcally,
Hs for the wave of Eq. (91) is
Hs = [Hx0ax + Hy0ay] e−αze −jβz =

The two ﬁelds are sketched in Figure 11.4. The ﬁgure demonstrates the reason
for the minus sign in the term involving Ey0 in Eq. (92). The direction of power ﬂow,
given by E × H, is in the positive z direction in this case. A component of E in the

positive y direction would require a component of H in the negative x direction—thus
the minus sign. Using (91) and (92), the power density in the wave is found using (77):

This result demonstrates the idea that our linearly polarized plane wave can be con-
sidered as two distinct plane waves having x and y polarizations, whose electric ﬁelds
are combining in phase to produce the total E. The same is true for the magnetic ﬁeld
components. This is a critical point in understanding wave polarization, in that any
polarization state can be described in terms of mutually perpendicular components
of the electric ﬁeld and their relative phasing.
We next consider the effect of a phase difference, φ, between Ex0 and Ey0, where
φ < π/2. For simplicity, we will consider propagation in a lossless medium. The
total ﬁeld in phasor form is
Es = (Ex0ax + Ey0e jφay)e−jβz
(93)
Again, to aid in visualization, we convert this wave to real instantaneous form by
multiplying by e jωt and taking the real part:
E(z, t) = Ex0 cos(ωt −βz)ax + Ey0 cos(ωt −βz + φ)ay
(94)
where we have assumed that Ex0 and Ey0 are real. Suppose we set t = 0, in which
case (94) becomes [using cos(−x) = cos(x)]
E(z, 0) = Ex0 cos(βz)ax + Ey0 cos(βz −φ)ay
(95)
The component magnitudes of E(z, 0) are plotted as functions of z in Figure 11.5.
Since time is ﬁxed at zero, the wave is frozen in position. An observer can move
along the z axis, measuring the component magnitudes and thus the orientation of the
total electric ﬁeld at each point. Let’s consider a crest of Ex, indicated as point a in
Figure 11.5. If φ were zero, Ey would have a crest at the same location. Since φ is
not zero (and positive), the crest of Ey that would otherwise occur at point a is now
displaced to point b farther down z. The two points are separated by distance φ/β.
Ey thus lags behind Ex when we consider the spatial dimension.
Now suppose the observer stops at some location on the z axis, and time is
allowed to move forward. Both ﬁelds now move in the positive z direction, as (94)
indicates. But point b reaches the observer ﬁrst, followed by point a. So we see that
Ey leads Ex when we consider the time dimension. In either case (ﬁxed t and varying
z, or vice versa) the observer notes that the net ﬁeld rotates about the z axis while
its magnitude changes. Considering a starting point in z and t, at which the ﬁeld has
a given orientation and magnitude, the wave will return to the same orientation and

Thus, to an observer at a fixed location, the y component leads in time.
magnitude at a distance of one wavelength in z (for ﬁxed t) or at a time t = 2π/ω
later (at a ﬁxed z).
For illustration purposes, if we take the length of the ﬁeld vector as a measure
of its magnitude, we ﬁnd that at a ﬁxed position, the tip of the vector traces out the
shape of an ellipse over time t = 2π/ω. The wave is said to be elliptically polarized.
Elliptical polarization is in fact the most general polarization state of a wave, since
it encompasses any magnitude and phase difference between Ex and Ey. Linear
polarization is a special case of elliptical polarization in which the phase difference
is zero.
Another special case of elliptical polarization occurs when Ex0 = Ey0 = E0 and
when φ = ±π/2. The wave in this case exhibits circular polarization. To see this,
we incorporate these restrictions into Eq. (94) to obtain
E(z, t) = E0[cos(ωt −βz)ax + cos(ωt −βz ± π/2)ay]
= E0[cos(ωt −βz)ax ∓sin(ωt −βz)ay]
(96)
If we consider a ﬁxed position along z (such as z = 0) and allow time to vary, (96),
with φ = +π/2, becomes
E(0, t) = E0[cos(ωt)ax −sin(ωt)ay]
(97)
If we choose −π/2 in (96), we obtain
E(0, t) = E0[cos(ωt)ax + sin(ωt)ay]
(98)
The ﬁeld vector of Eq. (98) rotates in the counterclockwise direction in the xy plane,
while maintaining constant amplitude E0, and so the tip of the vector traces out a
circle. Figure 11.6 shows this behavior.

Figure 11.6
Electric field in the xy plane
of a right circularly polarized plane wave,
as described by Eq. (98). As the wave
propagates in the forward z direction, the
field vector rotates counterclockwise in the
xy plane.
Choosing +π/2 leads to (97), whose ﬁeld vector rotates in the clockwise direction.
The handedness of the circular polarization is associated with the rotation and propa-
gation directions in the following manner: The wave exhibits left circular polarization
(l.c.p.) if, when orienting the left hand with the thumb in the direction of propagation,
the ﬁngers curl in the rotation direction of the ﬁeld with time. The wave exhibits right
circular polarization (r.c.p.) if, with the right-hand thumb in the propagation direc-
tion, the ﬁngers curl in the ﬁeld rotation direction.7 Thus, with forward z propagation,
(97) describes a left circularly polarized wave, and (98) describes a right circularly
polarized wave. The same convention is applied to elliptical polarization, in which
the descriptions left elliptical polarization and right elliptical polarization are used.
Using (96), the instantaneous angle of the ﬁeld from the x direction can be found
for any position along z through
θ(z, t) = tan−1

= ∓(ωt −βz)

where again the minus sign (yielding l.c.p. for positive z travel) applies for the choice
of φ = +π/2 in (96); the plus sign (yielding r.c.p. for positive z travel) is used if
7 This convention is reversed by some workers (most notably in optics) who emphasize the importance
of the spatial ﬁeld conﬁguration. Note that r.c.p. by our deﬁnition is formed by propagating a spatial
ﬁeld that is in the shape of a left-handed screw, and for that reason it is sometimes called left circular
polarization (see Figure 11.7). Left circular polarization as we deﬁne it results from propagating a
spatial ﬁeld in the shape of a right-handed screw, and it is called right circular polarization by the
spatial enthusiasts. Caution is obviously necessary in interpreting what is meant when polarization
handedness is stated in an unfamiliar text.

CHAPTER 11
The Uniform Plane Wave

Figure 11.7
Representation of a right circularly polarized wave. The electric
field vector (in white) will rotate toward the y axis as the entire wave moves
through the xy plane in the direction of k. This counterclockwise rotation (when
looking toward the wave source) satisfies the temporal right-handed rotation
convention as described in the text. The wave, however, appears as a
left-handed screw, and for this reason it is called left circular polarization in the
other convention.
φ = −π/2. If we choose z = 0, the angle becomes simply ωt, which reaches 2π
(one complete rotation) at time t = 2π/ω. If we choose t = 0 and allow z to vary, we
form a corkscrew-like ﬁeld pattern. One way to visualize this is to consider a spiral
staircase–shaped pattern, in which the ﬁeld lines (stairsteps) are perpendicular to the z
(or staircase) axis. The relationship between this spatial ﬁeld pattern and the resulting
time behavior at ﬁxed z as the wave propagates is shown in an artist’s conception in
Figure 11.7.
The handedness of the polarization is changed by reversing the pitch of the
corkscrew pattern. The spiral staircase model is only a visualization aid. It must be
remembered that the wave is still a uniform plane wave whose ﬁelds at any position
along z are inﬁnite in extent over the transverse plane.
There are many uses of circularly polarized waves. Perhaps the most obvious
advantage is that reception of a wave having circular polarization does not depend
on the antenna orientation in the plane normal to the propagation direction. Dipole
antennas, for example, are required to be oriented along the electric ﬁeld direction
of the signal they receive. If circularly polarized signals are transmitted, the receiver
orientation requirements are relaxed considerably. In optics, circularly polarized light

400
ENGINEERING ELECTROMAGNETICS
can be passed through a polarizer of any orientation, thus yielding linearly polarized
light in any direction (although one loses half the original power this way). Other
uses involve treating linearly polarized light as a superposition of circularly polarized
waves, to be described next.
Circularly polarized light can be generated using an anisotropic medium—a
material whose permittivity is a function of electric ﬁeld direction. Many crystals
have this property. A crystal orientation can be found such that along one direction
(say, the x axis), the permittivity is lowest, while along the orthogonal direction
(y axis), the permittivity is highest. The strategy is to input a linearly polarized wave
with its ﬁeld vector at 45 degrees to the x and y axes of the crystal. It will thus have
equal-amplitude x and y components in the crystal, and these will now propagate in
the z direction at different speeds. A phase difference (or retardation) accumulates
between the components as they propagate, which can reach π/2 if the crystal is long
enough. The wave at the output thus becomes circularly polarized. Such a crystal, cut
to the right length and used in this manner, is called a quarter-wave plate, since it
introduces a relative phase shift of π/2 between Ex and Ey, which is equivalent to λ/4.
It is useful to express circularly polarized waves in phasor form. To do this, we
note that (96) can be expressed as
E(z, t) = Re

E0e jωte−jβz
ax + e± jπ/2ay

Using the fact that e± jπ/2 = ± j, we identify the phasor form as:
Es = E0(ax ± jay)e−jβz
(100)
where the plus sign is used for left circular polarization and the minus sign for right
circular polarization. If the wave propagates in the negative z direction, we have
Es = E0(ax ± jay)e+ jβz
(101)
where in this case the positive sign applies to right circular polarization and the minus
sign to left circular polarization. The student is encouraged to verify this.
EXAMPLE 11.7
Let us consider the result of superimposing left and right circularly polarized ﬁelds
of the same amplitude, frequency, and propagation direction, but where a phase shift
of δ radians exists between the two.
Solution. Taking the waves to propagate in the +z direction, and introducing a
relative phase, δ, the total phasor ﬁeld is found, using (100):
EsT = EsR + EsL = E0[ax −jay]e−jβz + E0[ax + jay]e−jβze jδ
Grouping components together, this becomes
EsT = E0[(1 + e jδ)ax −j(1 −e jδ)ay]e−jβz
Factoring out an overall phase term, e jδ/2, we obtain
EsT = E0e jδ/2 
(e−jδ/2 + e jδ/2)ax −j(e−jδ/2 −e jδ/2)ay

e−jβz

CHAPTER 11
The Uniform Plane Wave
401
From Euler’s identity, we ﬁnd that e jδ/2 + e−jδ/2 = 2 cos δ/2, and e jδ/2 −e−jδ/2 =
2 j sin δ/2. Using these relations, we obtain
EsT = 2E0[cos(δ/2)ax + sin(δ/2)ay]e−j(βz−δ/2)
(102)
We recognize (102) as the electric ﬁeld of a linearly polarized wave, whose ﬁeld
vector is oriented at angle δ/2 from the x axis.
Example 11.7 shows that any linearly polarized wave can be expressed as the
sum of two circularly polarized waves of opposite handedness, where the linear po-
larization direction is determined by the relative phase difference between the two
waves. Such a representation is convenient (and necessary) when considering, for
example, the propagation of linearly polarized light through media which contain
organic molecules. These often exhibit spiral structures having left- or right-handed
pitch, and they will thus interact differently with left- or right-hand circular polar-
ization. As a result, the left circular component can propagate at a different speed
than the right circular component, and so the two waves will accumulate a phase
difference as they propagate. As a result, the direction of the linearly polarized ﬁeld
vector at the output of the material will differ from the direction that it had at the
input. The extent of this rotation can be used as a measurement tool to aid in material
studies.
Polarization issues will become extremely important when we consider wave
reﬂection in Chapter 12.

In an anisotropic medium, permittivity varies with electric ﬁeld direction,

n Chapter 11, we learned how to mathematically represent uniform plane waves
as functions of frequency, medium properties, and electric ﬁeld orientation. We
also learned how to calculate the wave velocity, attenuation, and power. In this
chapter we consider wave reﬂection and transmission at planar boundaries between
different media. Our study will allow any orientation between the wave and boundary
and will also include the important cases of multiple boundaries. We will also study
the practical case of waves that carry power over a ﬁnite band of frequencies, as
would occur, for example, in a modulated carrier. We will consider such waves in
dispersive media, in which some parameter that affects propagation (permittivity for
example) varies with frequency. The effect of a dispersive medium on a signal is of
great importance because the signal envelope will change its shape as it propagates.
As a result, detection and faithful representation of the original signal at the receiving
end become problematic. Consequently, dispersion and attenuation must both be
evaluated when establishing maximum allowable transmission distances. ■

REFLECTION OF UNIFORM PLANE
WAVES AT NORMAL INCIDENCE
We ﬁrst consider the phenomenon of reﬂection which occurs when a uniform plane
waveisincidentontheboundarybetweenregionscomposedoftwodifferentmaterials.
The treatment is specialized to the case of normal incidence—in which the wave
propagation direction is perpendicular to the boundary. In later sections, we remove
this restriction. Expressions will be found for the wave that is reﬂected from the inter-
face and for that which is transmitted from one region into the other. These results are
directly related to impedance-matching problems in ordinary transmission lines, as
we have already encountered in Chapter 10. They are also applicable to waveguides,
which we will study in Chapter 13.

We again assume that we have only a single vector component of the electric ﬁeld
intensity. Referring to Figure 12.1, we deﬁne region 1 (ϵ1, µ1) as the half-space for
which z < 0; region 2 (ϵ2, µ2) is the half-space for which z > 0. Initially we establish
a wave in region 1, traveling in the +z direction, and linearly polarized along x.
E+
x1(z, t) = E+
x10e−α1z cos(ωt −β1z)
In phasor form, this is
E+
xs1(z) = E+

(1)
where we take E+
x10 as real. The subscript 1 identiﬁes the region, and the superscript +
indicates a positively traveling wave. Associated with E+

where k1 and η1 are complex unless ϵ′′
1 (or σ1) is zero. This uniform plane wave in
region l that is traveling toward the boundary surface at z = 0 is called the incident
wave. Since the direction of propagation of the incident wave is perpendicular to the
boundary plane, we describe it as normal incidence.
We now recognize that energy may be transmitted across the boundary surface at
z = 0 into region 2 by providing a wave moving in the +z direction in that medium.
The phasor electric and magnetic ﬁelds for this wave are

This wave, which moves away from the boundary surface into region 2, is called the
transmitted wave. Note the use of the different propagation constant k2 and intrinsic
impedance η2.
Now we must satisfy the boundary conditions at z = 0 with these assumed ﬁelds.
With E polarized along x, the ﬁeld is tangent to the interface, and therefore the E
ﬁelds in regions l and 2 must be equal at z = 0. Setting z = 0 in (1) and (3) would
require that E+
x10 = E+
x20. H, being y-directed, is also a tangential ﬁeld, and must be
continuous across the boundary (no current sheets are present in real media). When
we let z = 0 in (2) and (4), we ﬁnd that we must have E+
x10/η1 = E+
x20/η2. Since
E+
x10 = E+
x20, then η1 = η2. But this is a very special condition that does not ﬁt the
facts in general, and we are therefore unable to satisfy the boundary conditions with
only an incident and a transmitted wave. We require a wave traveling away from the
boundary in region 1, as shown in Figure 12.1; this is the reﬂected wave,

where E−
x10 may be a complex quantity. Because this ﬁeld is traveling in the −z
direction, E−
xs1 = −η1H −
ys1 for the Poynting vector shows that E−
1 × H−
1 must be in
the −az direction.
The boundary conditions are now easily satisﬁed, and in the process the ampli-
tudes of the transmitted and reﬂected waves may be found in terms of E+
x10. The total
electric ﬁeld intensity is continuous at z = 0,
Exs1 = Exs2

(9)
It is evident that as η1 or η2 may be complex,  will also be complex, and so we
include a reﬂective phase shift, φ. The interpretation of Eq. (9) is identical to that
used with transmission lines [Eq. (73), Chapter 10].
The relative amplitude of the transmitted electric ﬁeld intensity is found by
combining (9) and (7) to yield the transmission coefﬁcient, τ,

(10)
whose form and interpretation are consistent with the usage in transmission lines
[Eq. (75), Chapter 10].
Let us see how these results may be applied to several special cases. We ﬁrst let
region 1 be a perfect dielectric and region 2 be a perfect conductor. Then we apply
Eq. (48), Chapter 11, with ϵ′′
2 = σ2/ω, obtaining
η2 =

jωµ2
σ2 + jωϵ′
2
= 0
in which zero is obtained since σ2 →∞. Therefore, from (10),
E+
x20 = 0
No time-varying ﬁelds can exist in the perfect conductor. An alternate way of looking
at this is to note that the skin depth is zero.
Because η2 = 0, Eq. (9) shows that
 = −1
and
E+
x10 = −E−
x10
The incident and reﬂected ﬁelds are of equal amplitude, and so all the incident
energy is reﬂected by the perfect conductor. The fact that the two ﬁelds are of opposite
sign indicates that at the boundary (or at the moment of reﬂection), the reﬂected ﬁeld
is shifted in phase by 180◦relative to the incident ﬁeld. The total E ﬁeld in region 1 is
Exs1 = E+
xs1 + E−
xs1
= E+
x10 e−jβ1z −E+
x10 e jβ1z

410
ENGINEERING ELECTROMAGNETICS
where we have let jk1 = 0 + jβ1 in the perfect dielectric. These terms may be
combined and simpliﬁed,
Exs1 = (e−jβ1z −e jβ1z) E+
x10
= −j2 sin(β1z) E+
x10
(11)
Multiplying (11) by e jωt and taking the real part, we obtain the real instantaneous
form:
Ex1(z, t) = 2E+
x10 sin(β1z) sin(ωt)
(12)
We recognize this total ﬁeld in region 1 as a standing wave, obtained by combining
two waves of equal amplitude traveling in opposite directions. We ﬁrst encountered
standing waves in transmission lines, but in the form of counterpropagating voltage
waves (see Example 10.1).
Again, we compare the form of (12) to that of the incident wave,
Ex1(z, t) = E+
x10 cos(ωt −β1z)
(13)
Here we see the term ωt −β1z or ω(t −z/νp1), which characterizes a wave traveling
in the +z direction at a velocity νp1 = ω/β1. In (12), however, the factors involving
time and distance are separate trigonometric terms. Whenever ωt = mπ, Ex1 is zero
at all positions. On the other hand, spatial nulls in the standing wave pattern occur
for all times wherever β1z = mπ, which in turn occurs when m = (0, ±1, ±2, . . .).
In such cases,
2π
λ1
z = mπ
and the null locations occur at
z = m λ1
2
Thus Ex1 = 0 at the boundary z = 0 and at every half-wavelength from the boundary
in region 1, z < 0, as illustrated in Figure 12.2.
Because E+
xs1 = η1 H +
ys1 and E−
xs1 = −η1 H −
ys1, the magnetic ﬁeld is
Hys1 = E+
x10
η1
(e−jβ1z + e jβ1z)
or
Hy1(z, t) = 2 E+
x10
η1
cos(β1z) cos(ωt)
(14)
This is also a standing wave, but it shows a maximum amplitude at the positions
where Ex1 = 0. It is also 90◦out of time phase with Ex1 everywhere. As a result, the
average power as determined through the Poynting vector [Eq. (77), Chapter 11] is
zero in the forward and backward directions.
Let us now consider perfect dielectrics in both regions 1 and 2; η1 and η2 are
both real positive quantities and α1 = α2 = 0. Equation (9) enables us to calculate

Solution. The reﬂection coefﬁcient is
 = 300 −100
300 + 100 = 0.5
and thus

100 = 1.00 A/m

Therefore, the average power density that is transmitted through the boundary into
region 2 is

y20 = 37.5 W/m2
We may check and conﬁrm the power conservation requirement:
⟨S1i⟩= ⟨S1r⟩+ ⟨S2⟩
A general rule on the transfer of power through reﬂection and transmission can
be formulated. We consider the same ﬁeld vector and interface orientations as before,
but allow for the case of complex impedances. For the incident power density, we have

Ans. 0.63; 0.37; 0.20 V/m
12.2
STANDING WAVE RATIO
In cases where || < 1, some energy is transmitted into the second region and some is
reﬂected. Region 1 therefore supports a ﬁeld that is composed of both a traveling wave
and a standing wave. We encountered this situation previously in transmission lines, in
which partial reﬂection occurs at the load. Measurements of the voltage standing wave
ratio and the locations of voltage minima or maxima enabled the determination of an
unknown load impedance or established the extent to which the load impedance was
matched to that of the line (Section 10.10). Similar measurements can be performed
on the ﬁeld amplitudes in plane wave reﬂection.
Using the same ﬁelds investigated in the previous section, we combine the in-
cident and reﬂected electric ﬁeld intensities. Medium 1 is assumed to be a perfect
dielectric (α1 = 0), but region 2 may be any material. The total electric ﬁeld phasor
in region 1 will be
Ex1T = E+
x1 + E−
x1 = E+
x10e−jβ1z + E+
x10e jβ1z
(18)
where the reﬂection coefﬁcient is as expressed in (9):
 = η2 −η1
η2 + η1
= ||e jφ
We allow for the possibility of a complex reﬂection coefﬁcient by including its phase,
φ. This is necessary because although η1 is real and positive for a lossless medium,

414
ENGINEERING ELECTROMAGNETICS
η2 will in general be complex. Additionally, if region 2 is a perfect conductor, η2 is
zero, and so φ is equal to π; if η2 is real and less than η1, φ is also equal to π; and if
η2 is real and greater than η1, φ is zero.
Incorporating the phase of  into (18), the total ﬁeld in region 1 becomes
Ex1T =
	
e−jβ1z + ||e j(β1z+φ)
E+
x10
(19)
The maximum and minimum ﬁeld amplitudes in (19) are z-dependent and are subject
to measurement. Their ratio, as found for voltage amplitudes in transmission lines
(Section 10.10), is the standing wave ratio, denoted by s. We have a maximum when
each term in the larger parentheses in (19) has the same phase angle; so, for E+
x10
positive and real,
|Ex1T |max = (1 + ||)E+
x10
(20)
and this occurs where
−β1z = β1z + φ + 2mπ
(m = 0, ±1, ±2, . . .)
(21)
Therefore
zmax = −1
2β1
(φ + 2mπ)
(22)
Note that an electric ﬁeld maximum is located at the boundary plane (z = 0) if φ = 0;
moreover, φ = 0 when  is real and positive. This occurs for real η1 and η2 when
η2 > η1. Thus there is a ﬁeld maximum at the boundary surface when the intrinsic
impedance of region 2 is greater than that of region 1 and both impedances are real.
With φ = 0, maxima also occur at zmax = −mπ/β1 = −mλ1/2.
For the perfect conductor φ = π, and these maxima are found at zmax = −π/
(2β1), −3π/(2β1), or zmax = −λ1/4, −3λ1/4, and so forth.
The minima must occur where the phase angles of the two terms in the larger
parentheses in (19) differ by 180◦, thus
|Ex1T |min = (1 −||)E+
x10
(23)
and this occurs where
−β1z = β1z + φ + π + 2mπ
(m = 0, ±1, ±2, . . .)
(24)
or
zmin = −1
2β1
(φ + (2m + 1)π)
(25)
The minima are separated by multiples of one half-wavelength (as are the maxima),
and for the perfect conductor the ﬁrst minimum occurs when −β1z = 0, or at the
conducting surface. In general, an electric ﬁeld minimum is found at z = 0 whenever
φ = π; this occurs if η2 < η1 and both are real. The results are mathematically
identical to those found for the transmission line study in Section 10.10. Figure 10.6
in that chapter provides a visualization.

CHAPTER 12
Plane Wave Reflection and Dispersion
415
Further insights can be obtained by working with Eq. (19) and rewriting it in real
instantaneous form. The steps are identical to those taken in Chapter 10, Eqs. (81)
through (84). We ﬁnd the total ﬁeld in region 1 to be
Ex1T (z, t) = (1 −||)E+
x10 cos(ωt −β1z)

standing wave
(26)
The ﬁeld expressed in Eq. (26) is the sum of a traveling wave of amplitude
(1 −||)E+
x10 and a standing wave having amplitude 2||E+
x10. The portion of the in-
cident wave that reﬂects and back-propagates in region 1 interferes with an equivalent
portion of the incident wave to form a standing wave. The rest of the incident wave
(that does not interfere) is the traveling wave part of (26). The maximum amplitude
observed in region 1 is found where the amplitudes of the two terms in (26) add
directly to give (1 + ||)E+
x10. The minimum amplitude is found where the standing
wave achieves a null, leaving only the traveling wave amplitude of (1−||)E+
x10. The
fact that the two terms in (26) combine in this way with the proper phasing can be
conﬁrmed by substituting zmax and zmin, as given by (22) and (25).
EXAMPLE 12.2
To illustrate some of these results, let us consider a 100-V/m, 3-GHz wave that is
propagating in a material having ϵ′
r1 = 4, µr1 = 1, and ϵ′′
r = 0. The wave is normally
incident on another perfect dielectric in region 2, z > 0, where ϵ′
r2 = 9 and µr2 = 1
(Figure 12.3). We seek the locations of the maxima and minima of E.
Figure 12.3
An incident wave, E +
xs1 =
100e−j 40πz V/m, is reflected with a reflection
coefficient  = −0.2. Dielectric 2 is infinitely thick.

416
ENGINEERING ELECTROMAGNETICS
Solution. We calculate ω = 6π × 109 rad/s, β1 = ω√µ1ϵ1 = 40π rad/m, and
β2 = ω√µ2ϵ2 = 60π rad/m. Although the wavelength would be 10 cm in air,
we ﬁnd here that λ1 = 2π/β1 = 5 cm, λ2 = 2π/β2 = 3.33 cm, η1 = 60π ,
η2 = 40π , and  = (η2 −η1)/(η2 + η1) = −0.2. Because  is real and negative
(η2 < η1), there will be a minimum of the electric ﬁeld at the boundary, and it will be
repeated at half-wavelength (2.5 cm) intervals in dielectric l. From (23), we see that
|Ex1T |min = 80 V/m.
Maxima of E are found at distances of 1.25, 3.75, 6.25, . . . cm from z = 0.
These maxima all have amplitudes of 120 V/m, as predicted by (20).
There are no maxima or minima in region 2 because there is no reﬂected wave
there.
The ratio of the maximum to minimum amplitudes is the standing wave ratio:
s = |Ex1T |max
|Ex1T |min
= 1 + ||
1 −||
(27)
Because || < 1, s is always positive and greater than or equal to unity. For the
preceding example,
s = 1 + |−0.2|
1 −|−0.2| = 1.2
0.8 = 1.5
If || = 1, the reﬂected and incident amplitudes are equal, all the incident energy
is reﬂected, and s is inﬁnite. Planes separated by multiples of λ1/2 can be found on
which Ex1 is zero at all times. Midway between these planes, Ex1 has a maximum
amplitude twice that of the incident wave.
If η2 = η1, then  = 0, no energy is reﬂected, and s = 1; the maximum and
minimum amplitudes are equal.
If one-half the incident power is reﬂected, ||2 = 0.5, || = 0.707, and s = 5.83.
D12.2. What value of s results when  = ±1/2?
Ans. 3
Because the standing wave ratio is a ratio of amplitudes, the relative amplitudes,
as measured by a probe, permit its use to determine s experimentally.
EXAMPLE 12.3
A uniform plane wave in air partially reﬂects from the surface of a material whose
properties are unknown. Measurements of the electric ﬁeld in the region in front of the
interface yield a 1.5-m spacing between maxima, with the ﬁrst maximum occurring
0.75 m from the interface. A standing wave ratio of 5 is measured. Determine the
intrinsic impedance, ηu, of the unknown material.

CHAPTER 12
Plane Wave Reflection and Dispersion
417
Solution. The 1.5 m spacing between maxima is λ/2, which implies that a wave-
length is 3.0 m, or f = 100 MHz. The ﬁrst maximum at 0.75 m is thus at a distance
of λ/4 from the interface, which means that a ﬁeld minimum occurs at the boundary.
Thus  will be real and negative. We use (27) to write
|| = s −1
s + 1 = 5 −1
5 + 1 = 2
3
So
 = −2
3 = ηu −η0
ηu + η0
which we solve for ηu to obtain
ηu = 1
5η0 = 377

= 75.4 
12.3
WAVE REFLECTION FROM
MULTIPLE INTERFACES
So far we have treated the reﬂection of waves at the single boundary that occurs be-
tween semi-inﬁnite media. In this section, we consider wave reﬂection from materials
that are ﬁnite in extent, such that we must consider the effect of the front and back
surfaces. Such a two-interface problem would occur, for example, for light incident
on a ﬂat piece of glass. Additional interfaces are present if the glass is coated with
one or more layers of dielectric material for the purpose (as we will see) of reducing
reﬂections. Such problems in which more than one interface is involved are frequently
encountered; single-interface problems are in fact more the exception than the rule.
Consider the general situation shown in Figure 12.4, in which a uniform plane
wave propagating in the forward z direction is normally incident from the left onto
the interface between regions 1 and 2; these have intrinsic impedances η1 and η2. A
third region of impedance η3 lies beyond region 2, and so a second interface exists
between regions 2 and 3. We let the second interface location occur at z = 0, and so
all positions to the left will be described by values of z that are negative. The width
of the second region is l, so the ﬁrst interface will occur at position z = −l.
When the incident wave reaches the ﬁrst interface, events occur as follows: A
portion of the wave reﬂects, while the remainder is transmitted, to propagate toward
the second interface. There, a portion is transmitted into region 3, while the rest
reﬂects and returns to the ﬁrst interface; there it is again partially reﬂected. This
reﬂected wave then combines with additional transmitted energy from region 1, and
the process repeats. We thus have a complicated sequence of multiple reﬂections
that occur within region 2, with partial transmission at each bounce. To analyze the
situation in this way would involve keeping track of a very large number of reﬂections;
this would be necessary when studying the transient phase of the process, where the
incident wave ﬁrst encounters the interfaces.
If the incident wave is left on for all time, however, a steady-state situation is
eventually reached, in which (1) an overall fraction of the incident wave is reﬂected

which the impedances of regions 2 and 3, along with

from the two-interface conﬁguration and back-propagates in region 1 with a deﬁnite
amplitude and phase; (2) an overall fraction of the incident wave is transmitted through
the two interfaces and forward-propagates in the third region; (3) a net backward wave
exists in region 2, consisting of all reﬂected waves from the second interface; and
(4) a net forward wave exists in region 2, which is the superposition of the transmitted
wave through the ﬁrst interface and all waves in region 2 that have reﬂected from
the ﬁrst interface and are now forward-propagating. The effect of combining many
co-propagating waves in this way is to establish a single wave which has a deﬁnite
amplitude and phase, determined through the sums of the amplitudes and phases of all
the component waves. In steady state, we thus have a total of ﬁve waves to consider.
These are the incident and net reﬂected waves in region 1, the net transmitted wave
in region 3, and the two counterpropagating waves in region 2.
The situation is analyzed in the same manner as that used in the analysis of
ﬁnite-length transmission lines (Section 10.11). Let us assume that all regions are
composed of lossless media, and consider the two waves in region 2. If we take these
as x-polarized, their electric ﬁelds combine to yield
Exs2 = E+
x20 e−jβ2z + E−

where β2 = ω√ϵr2/c, and where the amplitudes, E+

y-polarized magnetic ﬁeld is similarly written, using complex amplitudes:
Hys2 = H +
y20 e−jβ2z + H −
y20 e jβ2z
(28b)
We now note that the forward and backward electric ﬁeld amplitudes in region 2 are
related through the reﬂection coefﬁcient at the second interface, 23, where
23 = η3 −η2
η3 + η2
(29)

We thus have

We then write the magnetic ﬁeld amplitudes in terms of electric ﬁeld amplitudes

We now deﬁne the wave impedance, ηw, as the z-dependent ratio of the total elec-
tric ﬁeld to the total magnetic ﬁeld. In region 2, this becomes, using (28a) and (28b),
ηw(z) = Exs2
Hys2
= E+
x20e−jβ2z + E−
x20e jβ2z

y20e−jβ2z + H −

Then, using (30), (31a), and (31b), we obtain
ηw(z) = η2
e−jβ2z + 23e jβ2z
e−jβ2z −23e jβ2z

Now, using (29) and Euler’s identity, we have
ηw(z) = η2 × (η3 + η2)(cos β2z −j sin β2z) + (η3 −η2)(cos β2z + j sin β2z)
(η3 + η2)(cos β2z −j sin β2z) −(η3 −η2)(cos β2z + j sin β2z)
This is easily simpliﬁed to yield
ηw(z) = η2
η3 cos β2z −jη2 sin β2z
η2 cos β2z −jη3 sin β2z
(32)
We now use the wave impedance in region 2 to solve our reﬂection problem. Of
interest to us is the net reﬂected wave amplitude at the ﬁrst interface. Since tangential
E and H are continuous across the boundary, we have

(33a)
and

(z = −l)
(33b)
Then, in analogy to (7) and (8), we may write

E−

(35)
To ﬁnd the input impedance, we evaluate (32) at z = −l, resulting in
ηin = η2
η3 cos β2l + jη2 sin β2l
η2 cos β2l + jη3 sin β2l
(36)
Equations (35) and (36) are general results that enable us to calculate the net reﬂected
wave amplitude and phase from two parallel interfaces between lossless media.1
Note the dependence on the interface spacing, l, and on the wavelength as measured
in region 2, characterized by β2. Of immediate importance to us is the fraction of the
incident power that reﬂects from the dual interface and back-propagates in region 1.
As we found earlier, this fraction will be ||2. Also of interest is the transmitted
power, which propagates away from the second interface in region 3. It is simply the
remaining power fraction, which is 1 −||2. The power in region 2 stays constant
in steady state; power leaves that region to form the reﬂected and transmitted waves,
but is immediately replenished by the incident wave. We have already encountered
an analogous situation involving cascaded transmission lines, which culminated in
Eq. (101) in Chapter 10.
An important result of situations involving two interfaces is that it is possible to
achieve total transmission in certain cases. From (35), we see that total transmission
occurs when  = 0, or when ηin = η1. In this case, as in transmission lines, we say
that the input impedance is matched to that of the incident medium. There are a few
methods of accomplishing this.
As a start, suppose that η3 = η1, and region 2 is of such thickness that β2l = mπ,
where m is an integer. Now β2 = 2π/λ2, where λ2 is the wavelength as measured in
region 2. Therefore

l = mπ
or
l = m λ2

(37)
Withβ2l = mπ,thesecondregionthicknessisanintegermultipleofhalf-wavelengths
as measured in that medium. Equation (36) now reduces to ηin = η3. Thus the general
effect of a multiple half-wave thickness is to render the second region immaterial to
1 For convenience, (34a) and (34b) have been written for a speciﬁc time at which the incident wave
amplitude, E+
x10, occurs at z = −l. This establishes a zero-phase reference at the front interface for the
incident wave, and so it is from this reference that the reﬂected wave phase is determined. Equivalently,
we have repositioned the z = 0 point at the front interface. Eq. (36) allows this because it is only a
function of the interface spacing, l.

CHAPTER 12

421
the results on reﬂection and transmission. Equivalently, we have a single-interface
problem involving η1 and η3. Now, with η3 = η1, we have a matched input impedance,
and there is no net reﬂected wave. This method of choosing the region 2 thickness is
known as half-wave matching. Its applications include, for example, antenna housings
on airplanes known as radomes, which form a part of the fuselage. The antenna,
inside the aircraft, can transmit and receive through this layer, which can be shaped to
enable good aerodynamic characteristics. Note that the half-wave matching condition
no longer applies as we deviate from the wavelength that satisﬁes it. When this is
done, the device reﬂectivity increases (with increased wavelength deviation), so it
ultimately acts as a bandpass ﬁlter.
Often, it is convenient to express the dielectric constant of the medium through
the refractive index (or just index), n, deﬁned as
n = √ϵr
(38)
Characterizing materials by their refractive indices is primarily done at optical fre-
quencies (on the order of 1014 Hz), whereas at much lower frequencies, a dielectric
constant is traditionally speciﬁed. Since ϵr is complex in lossy media, the index will
also be complex. Rather than complicate the situation in this way, we will restrict
our use of the refractive index to cases involving lossless media, having ϵ′′
r = 0, and
µr = 1. Under lossless conditions, we may write the plane wave phase constant and
the material intrinsic impedance in terms of the index through
β = k = ω√µ0ϵ0
√ϵr = nω

(39)
and
η =

(40)
Finally, the phase velocity and wavelength in a material of index n are

(41)
and
λ = νp
f = λ0

(42)
where λ0 is the wavelength in free space. It is obviously important not to confuse
the index n with the similar-appearing Greek η (intrinsic impedance), which has an
entirely different meaning.
Another application, typically seen in optics, is the Fabry-Perot interferometer.
This, in its simplest form, consists of a single block of glass or other transparent

422

material of index n, whose thickness, l, is set to transmit wavelengths which satisfy
the condition λ = λ0/n = 2l/m. Often we want to transmit only one wavelength,
not several, as (37) would allow. We would therefore like to assure that adjacent
wavelengths that are passed through the device are separated as far as possible, so
that only one will lie within the input power spectrum. In terms of wavelength as
measured in the material, this separation is in general given by
λm−1 −λm = λ f =
2l
m −1 −2l
m =
2l
m(m −1)
.= 2l
m2
Note that m is the number of half-wavelengths in region 2, or m = 2l/λ = 2nl/λ0,
where λ0 is the desired free-space wavelength for transmission. Thus
λ f .= λ2
2
2l
(43a)
In terms of wavelength measured in free space, this becomes
λ f 0 = nλ f .= λ2

2nl
(43b)
λ f 0 is known as the free spectral range of the Fabry-Perot interferometer in terms
of free-space wavelength separation. The interferometer can be used as a narrow-
band ﬁlter (transmitting a desired wavelength and a narrow spectrum around this
wavelength) if the spectrum to be ﬁltered is narrower than the free spectral range.
EXAMPLE 12.4
Suppose we wish to ﬁlter an optical spectrum of full width λs0 = 50 nm (measured
in free space), whose center wavelength, λ0, is in the red part of the visible spectrum
at 600 nm, where one nm (nanometer) is 10−9 m. A Fabry-Perot ﬁlter is to be used,
consisting of a lossless glass plate in air, having refractive index n = 1.45. We need
to ﬁnd the required range of glass thicknesses such that multiple wavelength orders
will not be transmitted.
Solution. We require that the free spectral range be greater than the optical spectral
width, or λ f 0 > λs. Using (43b)
l <
λ2
0
2nλs0
So
l <
6002
2(1.45)(50) = 2.5 × 103nm = 2.5 µm
where 1µm (micrometer) = 10−6 m. Fabricating a glass plate of this thickness or less
is somewhat ridiculous to contemplate. Instead, what is often used is an airspace of
thickness on this order, between two thick plates whose surfaces on the sides opposite
the airspace are antireﬂection coated. This is in fact a more versatile conﬁguration
because the wavelength to be transmitted (and the free spectral range) can be adjusted
by varying the plate separation.

CHAPTER 12
Plane Wave Reflection and Dispersion
423
Next, we remove the restriction η1 = η3 and look for a way to produce zero
reﬂection. Returning to Eq. (36), suppose we set β2l = (2m −1)π/2, or an odd
multiple of π/2. This means that
2π
λ2
l = (2m −1)π
2
(m = 1, 2, 3, . . .)
or
l = (2m −1)λ2
4
(44)
The thickness is an odd multiple of a quarter-wavelength as measured in region 2.
Under this condition, (36) reduces to
ηin = η2
2
η3
(45)
Typically, we choose the second region impedance to allow matching between given
impedances η1 and η3. To achieve total transmission, we require that ηin = η1, so that
the required second region impedance becomes
η2 = √η1η3
(46)
With the conditions given by (44) and (46) satisﬁed, we have performed quarter-wave
matching. The design of antireﬂective coatings for optical devices is based on this
principle.
EXAMPLE 12.5
We wish to coat a glass surface with an appropriate dielectric layer to provide total
transmission from air to the glass at a free-space wavelength of 570 nm. The glass
has refractive index n3 = 1.45. Determine the required index for the coating and its
minimum thickness.
Solution. The known impedances are η1 = 377  and η3 = 377/1.45 = 260 .
Using (46) we have
η2 =

(377)(260) = 313 
The index of region 2 will then be
n2 =
377
313

= 1.20
The wavelength in region 2 will be
λ2 = 570
1.20 = 475 nm
The minimum thickness of the dielectric layer is then
l = λ2
4 = 119 nm = 0.119 µm

Figure 12.5
A three-interface problem in which input
impedance ηin,a is transformed back to the front interface
to form input impedance ηin,b.
The procedure in this section for evaluating wave reﬂection has involved calcu-
lating an effective impedance at the ﬁrst interface, ηin, which is expressed in terms of
the impedances that lie beyond the front surface. This process of impedance trans-
formation is more apparent when we consider problems involving more than two
interfaces.
For example, consider the three-interface situation shown in Figure 12.5, where
a wave is incident from the left in region 1. We wish to determine the fraction of the
incident power that is reﬂected and back-propagates in region 1 and the fraction of the
incident power that is transmitted into region 4. To do this, we need to ﬁnd the input
impedance at the front surface (the interface between regions 1 and 2). We start by
transforming the impedance of region 4 to form the input impedance at the boundary
between regions 2 and 3. This is shown as ηin,b in Figure 12.5. Using (36), we have
ηin,b = η3
η4 cos β3lb + jη3 sin β3lb
η3 cos β3lb + jη4 sin β3lb
(47)
We have now effectively reduced the situation to a two-interface problem in which
ηin,b is the impedance of all that lies beyond the second interface. The input impedance
at the front interface, ηin,a, is now found by transforming ηin,b as follows:
ηin,a = η2
ηin,b cos β2la + jη2 sin β2la
η2 cos β2la + jηin,b sin β2la
(48)
The reﬂected power fraction is now ||2, where
 = ηin,a −η1
ηin,a + η1

CHAPTER 12
Plane Wave Reflection and Dispersion
425
The fraction of the power transmitted into region 4 is, as before, 1−||2. The method
of impedance transformation can be applied in this manner to any number of inter-
faces. The process, although tedious, is easily handled by a computer.
The motivation for using multiple layers to reduce reﬂection is that the resulting
structure is less sensitive to deviations from the design wavelength if the impedances
(or refractive indices) are arranged to progressively increase or decrease from layer to
layer. For multiple layers to antireﬂection coat a camera lens, for example, the layer
on the lens surface would be of impedance very close to that of the glass. Subsequent
layers are given progressively higher impedances. With a large number of layers
fabricated in this way, the situation begins to approach (but never reaches) the ideal
case, in which the top layer impedance matches that of air, while the impedances
of deeper layers continuously decrease until reaching the value of the glass surface.
With this continuously varying impedance, there is no surface from which to reﬂect,
and so light of any wavelength is totally transmitted. Multilayer coatings designed in
this way produce excellent broadband transmission characteristics.

PLANE WAVE PROPAGATION
IN GENERAL DIRECTIONS
In this section, we will learn how to mathematically describe uniform plane waves
that propagate in any direction. Our motivation for doing this is our need to address
the problem of incident waves on boundaries that are not perpendicular to the prop-
agation direction. Such problems of oblique incidence generally occur, with normal
incidence being a special case. Addressing such problems requires (as always) that we
establish an appropriate coordinate system. With the boundary positioned in the x, y
plane, for example, the incident wave will propagate in a direction that could involve
all three coordinate axes, whereas with normal incidence, we were only concerned
with propagation along z. We need a mathematical formalism that will allow for the
general direction case.
Let us consider a wave that propagates in a lossless medium, with propagation
constant β = k = ω√µϵ. For simplicity, we consider a two-dimensional case, where
the wave travels in a direction between the x and z axes. The ﬁrst step is to consider the
propagation constant as a vector, k, indicated in Figure 12.6. The direction of k is the
propagation direction, which is the same as the direction of the Poynting vector in
our case.2 The magnitude of k is the phase shift per unit distance along that direction.
2 We assume here that the wave is in an isotropic medium, where the permittivity and permeability do
not change with ﬁeld orientation. In anisotropic media (where ϵ and/or µ depend on ﬁeld orientation),
the directions of the Poynting vector and k may differ.

426
ENGINEERING ELECTROMAGNETICS
Figure 12.6
Representation of a uniform plane wave with
wavevector k at angle θ to the x axis. The phase at point
(x, z) is given by k · r. Planes of constant phase (shown as
lines perpendicular to k) are spaced by wavelength λ but
have wider spacing when measured along the x or z axis.
Part of the process of characterizing a wave involves specifying its phase at any
spatial location. For the waves we have considered that propagate along the z axis,
this was accomplished by the factor e± jkz in the phasor form. To specify the phase in
our two-dimensional problem, we make use of the vector nature of k and consider the
phase at a general location (x, z) described through the position vector r. The phase
at that location, referenced to the origin, is given by the projection of k along r times
the magnitude of r, or just k · r. If the electric ﬁeld is of magnitude E0, we can thus
write down the phasor form of the wave in Figure 12.6 as
Es = E0e−jk · r
(49)
The minus sign in the exponent indicates that the phase along r moves in time in
the direction of increasing r. Again, the wave power ﬂow in an isotropic medium
occurs in the direction along which the phase shift per unit distance is maximum—or
along k. The vector r serves as a means to measure phase at any point using k. This
construction is easily extended to three dimensions by allowing k and r to each have
three components.
In our two-dimensional case of Figure 12.6, we can express k in terms of its x
and z components:
k = kxax + kzaz

CHAPTER 12
Plane Wave Reflection and Dispersion
427
The position vector, r, can be similarly expressed:
r = xax + zaz
so that
k · r = kxx + kzz
Equation (49) now becomes
Es = E0e−j(kx x+kzz)
(50)
Whereas Eq. (49) provided the general form of the wave, Eq. (50) is the form that
is speciﬁc to the situation. Given a wave expressed by (50), the angle of propagation
from the x axis is readily found through
θ = tan−1
 kz
kx

The wavelength and phase velocity depend on the direction one is considering. In the
direction of k, these will be
λ = 2π
k
=
2π
	
k2x + k2z

1/2
and
νp = ω
k =

If, for example, we consider the x direction, these quantities will be
λx = 2π
kx
and
νpx = ω
kx
Note that both λx and νpx are greater than their counterparts along the direction of k.
This result, at ﬁrst surprising, can be understood through the geometry of Figure 12.6.
The diagram shows a series of phase fronts (planes of constant phase) which intersect
k at right angles. The phase shift between adjacent fronts is set at 2π in the ﬁgure; this
corresponds to a spatial separation along the k direction of one wavelength, as shown.
The phase fronts intersect the x axis, and we see that along x the front separation is
greater than it was along k. λx is the spacing between fronts along x and is indicated

428
ENGINEERING ELECTROMAGNETICS
on the ﬁgure. The phase velocity along x is the velocity of the intersection points
between the phase fronts and the x axis. Again, from the geometry, we see that this
velocity must be faster than the velocity along k and will, of course, exceed the
speed of light in the medium. This does not constitute a violation of special relativity,
however, since the energy in the wave ﬂows in the direction of k and not along x or z.
The wave frequency is f = ω/2π and is invariant with direction. Note, for example,
that in the directions we have considered,
f = νp
λ = νpx
λx

PLANE WAVE REFLECTION AT
OBLIQUE INCIDENCE ANGLES
We now consider the problem of wave reﬂection from plane interfaces, in which
the incident wave propagates at some angle to the surface. Our objectives are (1) to
determine the relation between incident, reﬂected, and transmitted angles, and (2) to
derive reﬂection and transmission coefﬁcients that are functions of the incident angle
and wave polarization. We will also show that cases exist in which total reﬂection or
total transmission may occur at the interface between two dielectrics if the angle of
incidence and the polarization are appropriately chosen.

CHAPTER 12

Figure 12.7
Geometries for plane wave incidence at angle θ1 onto an interface
between dielectrics having intrinsic impedances η1 and η2. The two polarization
cases are shown: (a) p-polarization (or TM), with E in the plane of incidence;
(b) s-polarization (or TE), with E perpendicular to the plane of incidence.
The situation is illustrated in Figure 12.7, in which the incident wave direction and
position-dependent phase are characterized by wavevector k+
1 . The angle of incidence
is the angle between k+
1 and a line that is normal to the surface (the x axis in this case).
The incidence angle is shown as θ1. The reﬂected wave, characterized by wavevector
k−
1 , will propagate away from the interface at angle θ′
1. Finally, the transmitted wave,
characterized by k2, will propagate into the second region at angle θ2 as shown. One
would suspect (from previous experience) that the incident and reﬂected angles are
equal (θ1 = θ′
1), which is correct. We need to show this, however, to be complete.
The two media are lossless dielectrics, characterized by intrinsic impedances η1
and η2. We will assume, as before, that the materials are nonmagnetic, and thus have
permeability µ0. Consequently, the materials are adequately described by specifying
their dielectric constants, ϵr1 and ϵr2, or their refractive indices, n1 = √ϵr1 and
n2 = √ϵr2.
In Figure 12.7, two cases are shown that differ by the choice of electric ﬁeld
orientation. In Figure 12.7a, the E ﬁeld is polarized in the plane of the page, with H
therefore perpendicular to the page and pointing outward. In this illustration, the plane
of the page is also the plane of incidence, which is more precisely deﬁned as the plane
spanned by the incident k vector and the normal to the surface. With E lying in the
plane of incidence, the wave is said to have parallel polarization or to be p-polarized
(E is parallel to the incidence plane). Note that although H is perpendicular to the
incidence plane, it lies parallel (or transverse) to the interface. Consequently, another
name for this type of polarization is transverse magnetic, or TM polarization.
Figure 12.7b shows the situation in which the ﬁeld directions have been rotated
by 90◦. Now H lies in the plane of incidence, whereas E is perpendicular to the plane.
Because E is used to deﬁne polarization, the conﬁguration is called perpendicular

430
ENGINEERING ELECTROMAGNETICS
polarization, or is said to be s-polarized.3 E is also parallel to the interface, and so
the case is also called transverse electric, or TE polarization. We will ﬁnd that the
reﬂection and transmission coefﬁcients will differ for the two polarization types, but
that reﬂection and transmission angles will not depend on polarization. We only need
to consider s- and p-polarizations because any other ﬁeld direction can be constructed
as some combination of s and p waves.
Our desired knowledge of reﬂection and transmission coefﬁcients, as well as how
the angles relate, can be found through the ﬁeld boundary conditions at the interface.
Speciﬁcally, we require that the transverse components of E and H be continuous
across the interface. These were the conditions we used to ﬁnd  and τ for normal
incidence (θ1 = 0), which is in fact a special case of our current problem. We will
consider the case of p-polarization (Figure 12.7a) ﬁrst. To begin, we write down the
incident, reﬂected, and transmitted ﬁelds in phasor form, using the notation developed
in Section 12.4:

(55)

(56)
and where
r = x ax + z az
(57)
The wavevector magnitudes are k1 = ω√ϵr1/c = n1ω/c and k2 = ω√ϵr2/c =
n2ω/c.
Now, to evaluate the boundary condition that requires continuous tangential elec-
tric ﬁeld, we need to ﬁnd the components of the electric ﬁelds (z components) that
are parallel to the interface. Projecting all E ﬁelds in the z direction, and using (51)
through (57), we ﬁnd

The boundary condition for a continuous tangential electric ﬁeld now reads:
E+

(at x = 0)
We now substitute Eqs. (58) through (60) into (61) and evaluate the result at x = 0
to obtain

10 cos θ′

(61)
Note that E+
10, E−
10, and E20 are all constants (independent of z). Further, we require
that (61) hold for all values of z (everywhere on the interface). For this to occur, it
must follow that all the phase terms appearing in (61) are equal. Speciﬁcally,
k1z sin θ1 = k1z sin θ′
1 = k2z sin θ2
From this, we see immediately that θ′
1 = θ1, or the angle of reﬂection is equal to the
angle of incidence. We also ﬁnd that
k1 sin θ1 = k2 sin θ2
(62)
Equation (62) is known as Snell’s law of refraction. Because, in general, k = nω/c,
we can rewrite (62) in terms of the refractive indices:
n1 sin θ1 = n2 sin θ2
(63)
Equation (63) is the form of Snell’s law that is most readily used for our present
case of nonmagnetic dielectrics. Equation (62) is a more general form which would
apply, for example, to cases involving materials with different permeabilities as well
as different permittivities. In general, we would have k1 = (ω/c)√µr1ϵr1 and k2 =
(ω/c)√µr2ϵr2.
Having found the relations between angles, we next turn to our second objective,
which is to determine the relations between the amplitudes, E+
10, E−
10, and E20. To
accomplish this, we need to consider the other boundary condition, requiring tangen-
tial continuity of H at x = 0. The magnetic ﬁeld vectors for the p-polarized wave are
all negative y-directed. At the boundary, the ﬁeld amplitudes are related through
H +
10 + H −
10 = H20
(64)
Then, when we use the fact that θ′
1 = θ1 and invoke Snell’s law, (61) becomes
E+
10 cos θ1 + E−
10 cos θ1 = E20 cos θ2
(65)
Using the medium intrinsic impedances, we know, for example, that E+
10/H +
10 = η1
and E+
20/H +
20 = η2. Eq. (64) can be written as follows:
E+
10 cos θ1
η1p
−E−
10 cos θ1
η1p
= E+
20 cos θ2
η2p
(66)
Note the minus sign in front of the second term in (66), which results from the fact
that E−
10 cos θ1 is negative (from Figure 12.7a), whereas H −
10 is positive (again from
the ﬁgure). When we write Eq. (66), effective impedances, valid for p-polarization,

are deﬁned through
η1p = η1 cos θ1
(67)
and
η2p = η2 cos θ2
(68)
Using this representation, Eqs. (65) and (66) are now in a form that enables them
to be solved together for the ratios E−
10/E+
10 and E20/E+

procedures to those used in solving (7) and (8), we ﬁnd the reﬂection and transmission

Equations (67) through (74) are what we need to calculate wave reﬂection and trans-
mission for either polarization, and at any incident angle.
EXAMPLE 12.7
A uniform plane wave is incident from air onto glass at an angle from the normal of
30◦. Determine the fraction of the incident power that is reﬂected and transmitted for
(a) p-polarization and (b) s-polarization. Glass has refractive index n2 = 1.45.

CHAPTER 12

Solution. First, we apply Snell’s law to ﬁnd the transmission angle. Using n1 = 1
for air, we use (63) to ﬁnd
θ2 = sin−1
sin 30

Now, for p-polarization:
η1p = η1 cos 30 = (377)(.866) = 326 
η2p = η2 cos 20.2 = 377
1.45(.938) = 244 
Then, using (69), we ﬁnd
p = 244 −326
244 + 326 = −0.144
The fraction of the incident power that is reﬂected is
Pr
Pinc
= |p|2 = .021
The transmitted fraction is then

For s-polarization, we have

η2s = η2 sec 20.2 =
377
1.45(.938) = 277 
Then, using (71):
s = 277 −435
277 + 435 = −.222
The reﬂected power fraction is thus
|s|2 = .049
The fraction of the incident power that is transmitted is
1 −|s|2 = .951
InExample12.7,reﬂectioncoefﬁcientvaluesforthetwopolarizationswerefound
to be negative. The meaning of a negative reﬂection coefﬁcient is that the component
of the reﬂected electric ﬁeld that is parallel to the interface will be directed opposite
the incident ﬁeld component when both are evaluated at the boundary.
This effect is alsoobservedwhenthesecondmediumisaperfectconductor.Inthis
case, we know that the electric ﬁeld inside the conductor must be zero. Consequently,
η2 = E20/H20 = 0, and the reﬂection coefﬁcients will be p = s = −1. Total
reﬂection occurs, regardless of the incident angle or polarization.

TOTAL REFLECTION AND TOTAL
TRANSMISSION OF OBLIQUELY
INCIDENT WAVES
Now that we have methods available to us for solving problems involving oblique in-
cidence reﬂection and transmission, we can explore the special cases of total reﬂection
and total transmission. We look for special combinations of media, incidence angles,
and polarizations that produce these properties. To begin, we identify the necessary
condition for total reﬂection. We want total power reﬂection, so that ||2 = ∗= 1,
where  is either p or s. The fact that this condition involves the possibility of a
complex  allows some ﬂexibility. For the incident medium, we note that η1p and
η1s will always be real and positive. On the other hand, when we consider the second
medium, η2p and η2s involve factors of cos θ2 or 1/ cos θ2, where

(75)
where Snell’s law has been used. We observe that cos θ2, and hence η2p and η2s,
become imaginary whenever sin θ1 > n2/n1. Let us consider parallel polarization,
for example. Under conditions of imaginary η2p, (69) becomes
p = j|η2p| −η1p
j|η2p| + η1p
= −η1p −j|η2p|
η1p + j|η2p| = −Z
Z∗
where Z = η1p −j|η2p|. We can therefore see that p∗
p = 1, meaning total power
reﬂection, whenever η2p is imaginary. The same will be true whenever η2p is zero,
which will occur when sin θ1 = n2/n1. We thus have our condition for total reﬂection,
which is
sin θ1 ≥n2
n1
(76)
From this condition arises the critical angle of total reﬂection, θc, deﬁned through
sin θc = n2
n1
(77)
The total reﬂection condition can thus be more succinctly written as
θ1 ≥θc
(for total reﬂection)
(78)
Note that for (76) and (77) to make sense, it must be true that n2 < n1, or the wave
must be incident from a medium of higher refractive index than that of the medium
beyond the boundary. For this reason, the total reﬂection condition is sometimes
called total internal reﬂection; it is often seen (and applied) in optical devices such

as beam-steering prisms, where light within the glass structure totally reﬂects from
glass-air interfaces.
EXAMPLE 12.8
A prism is to be used to turn a beam of light by 90◦, as shown in Figure 12.8.
Light enters and exits the prism through two antireﬂective (AR-coated) surfaces.
Total reﬂection is to occur at the back surface, where the incident angle is 45◦to the
normal. Determine the minimum required refractive index of the prism material if the
surrounding region is air.
Solution. Considering the back surface, the medium beyond the interface is air, with
n2 = 1.00. Because θ1 = 45◦, (76) is used to obtain
n1 ≥
n2
sin 45 =
√
2 = 1.41
Because fused silica glass has refractive index ng = 1.45, it is a suitable material for
this application and is in fact widely used.
Another important application of total reﬂection is in optical waveguides. These,
in their simplest form, are constructed of three layers of glass, in which the middle
layer has a slightly higher refractive index than the outer two. Figure 12.9 shows
the basic structure. Light, propagating from left to right, is conﬁned to the middle
layer by total reﬂection at the two interfaces, as shown. Optical ﬁber waveguides are
constructed on this principle, in which a cylindrical glass core region of small radius
is surrounded coaxially by a lower-index cladding glass material of larger radius.
Basic waveguiding principles as applied to metallic and dielectric structures will be
presented in Chapter 13.

is simply that  = 0. We investigate this possibility for the two polarizations. First,
we consider s-polarization. If s = 0, then from (71) we require that η2s = η1s, or

where we have used η1 = η0/n1 and η2 = η0/n2. We call this special angle θB, where
total transmission occurs, the Brewster angle or polarization angle. The latter name
comes from the fact that if light having both s- and p-polarization components is
incident at θ1 = θB, the p component will be totally transmitted, leaving the partially
reﬂected light entirely s-polarized. At angles that are slightly off the Brewster angle,
the reﬂected light is still predominantly s-polarized. Most reﬂected light that we see
originates from horizontal surfaces (such as the surface of the ocean), and so the light
has mostly horizontal polarization. Polaroid sunglasses take advantage of this fact to
reduce glare, for they are made to block the transmission of horizontally polarized
light while passing light that is vertically polarized.

in which p and s, from (69) and (71), are plotted as functions of the incident
angle, θ1. Curves are shown for selected values of the refractive index ratio, n1/n2.
For all plots in which n1/n2 > 1, s and p achieve values of ±1 at the critical angle.
At larger angles, the reﬂection coefﬁcients become imaginary (and are not shown)
but nevertheless retain magnitudes of unity. The occurrence of the Brewster angle is
evident in the curves for p (Figure 12.10a) because all curves cross the θ1 axis. This
behavior is not seen in the s functions because s is positive for all values of θ1
when n1/n2 > 1.

WAVE PROPAGATION
IN DISPERSIVE MEDIA
In Chapter 11, we encountered situations in which the complex permittivity of the
medium depends on frequency. This is true in all materials through a number of pos-
sible mechanisms. One of these, mentioned earlier, is that oscillating bound charges
in a material are in fact harmonic oscillators that have resonant frequencies associated
with them (see Appendix D). When the frequency of an incoming electromagnetic
wave is at or near a bound charge resonance, the wave will induce strong oscilla-
tions; these in turn have the effect of depleting energy from the wave in its original
form. The wave thus experiences absorption, and it does so to a greater extent than
it would at a frequency that is detuned from resonance. A related effect is that the

real part of the dielectric constant will be different at frequencies near resonance than
at frequencies far from resonance. In short, resonance effects give rise to values of
ϵ′ and ϵ′′ that will vary continuously with frequency. These in turn will produce a
fairly complicated frequency dependence in the attenuation and phase constants as
expressed in Eqs. (44) and (45) in Chapter 11.
This section concerns the effect of a frequency-varying dielectric constant (or
refractive index) on a wave as it propagates in an otherwise lossless medium. This
situation arises quite often because signiﬁcant refractive index variation can occur at
frequencies far away from resonance, where absorptive losses are negligible. A classic
example of this is the separation of white light into its component colors by a glass
prism. In this case, the frequency-dependent refractive index results in different angles
of refraction for the different colors—hence the separation. The color separation effect
produced by the prism is known as angular dispersion, or more speciﬁcally, chromatic
angular dispersion.
The term dispersion implies a separation of distinguishable components of a
wave. In the case of the prism, the components are the various colors that have
been spatially separated. An important point here is that the spectral power has been
dispersed by the prism. We can illustrate this idea by considering what it would take
to measure the difference in refracted angles between, for example, blue and red light.
One would need to use a power detector with a very narrow aperture, as shown in
Figure 12.11. The detector would be positioned at the locations of the blue and red
light from the prism, with the narrow aperture allowing essentially one color at a
time (or light over a very narrow spectral range) to pass through to the detector. The
detector would then measure the power in what we could call a “spectral packet,” or a
very narrow slice of the total power spectrum. The smaller the aperture, the narrower
the spectral width of the packet, and the greater the precision in the measurement.4 It
4 To perform this experiment, one would need to measure the wavelength as well. To do this, the
detector would likely be located at the output of a spectrometer or monochrometer whose input slit
performs the function of the bandwidth-limiting aperture.

is important for us to think of wave power as subdivided into spectral packets in this
way because it will ﬁgure prominently in our interpretation of the main topic of this
section, which is wave dispersion in time.
We now consider a lossless nonmagnetic medium in which the refractive index
varies with frequency. The phase constant of a uniform plane wave in this medium
will assume the form
β(ω) = k = ω

µ0ϵ(ω) = n(ω)ω
c
(80)
If we take n(ω) to be a monotonically increasing function of frequency (as is usu-
ally the case), a plot of ω versus β would look something like the curve shown in
Figure 12.12. Such a plot is known as an ω-β diagram for the medium. Much can be
learned about how waves propagate in the material by considering the shape of the
ω-β curve.
Suppose we have two waves at two frequencies, ωa and ωb, which are co-
propagating in the material and whose amplitudes are equal. The two frequencies
are labeled on the curve in Figure 12.12, along with the frequency midway between
the two, ω0. The corresponding phase constants, βa, βb, and β0, are also labeled. The
electric ﬁelds of the two waves are linearly polarized in the same direction (along x,
for example), while both waves propagate in the forward z direction. The waves will
thus interfere with each other, producing a resultant wave whose ﬁeld function can
be found simply by adding the E ﬁelds of the two waves. This addition is done using

the complex ﬁelds:
Ec,net(z, t) = E0[e−jβaze jωat + e−jβbze jωbt]
Note that we must use the full complex forms (with frequency dependence retained)
as opposed to the phasor forms, since the waves are at different frequencies. Next,
we factor out the term e−jβ0ze jω0t:
Ec,net(z, t) = E0e−jβ0ze jω0t[e jβze−jωt + e−jβze jωt]
= 2E0e−jβ0ze jω0t cos(ωt−βz)
(81)
where
ω = ω0 −ωa = ωb −ω0
and
β = β0 −βa = βb −β0
The preceding expression for β is approximately true as long as ω is small. This
can be seen from Figure 12.12 by observing how the shape of the curve affects β,
given uniform frequency spacings.
The real instantaneous form of (81) is found through
Enet(z, t) = Re{Ec,net} = 2E0 cos(ωt −βz) cos(ω0t −β0z)
(82)
If ω is fairly small compared to ω0, we recognize (82) as a carrier wave at fre-
quency ω0 that is sinusoidally modulated at frequency ω. The two original waves
are thus “beating” together to form a slow modulation, as one would hear when the
same note is played by two slightly out-of-tune musical instruments. The resultant
wave is shown in Figure 12.13.

Plot of the total electric field strength as a function of z (with
t = 0) of two co-propagating waves having different frequencies, ωa and ωb,
as per Eq. (81). The rapid oscillations are associated with the carrier
frequency, ω0 = (ωa + ωb)/2. The slower modulation is associated with the
envelope or ‘‘beat’’frequency, ω = (ωb −ωa)/2.

442
ENGINEERING ELECTROMAGNETICS
Of interest to us are the phase velocities of the carrier wave and the modulation
envelope. From (82), we can immediately write these down as:
νpc = ω0
β0
(carrier velocity)
(83)
νpe = ω
β
(envelope velocity)
(84)
Referring to the ω-β diagram, Figure 12.12, we recognize the carrier phase velocity
as the slope of the straight line that joins the origin to the point on the curve whose
coordinates are ω0 and β0. We recognize the envelope velocity as a quantity that
approximates the slope of the ω-β curve at the location of an operation point speciﬁed
by (ω0, β0). The envelope velocity in this case is thus somewhat less than the carrier
velocity. As ω becomes vanishingly small, the envelope velocity is exactly the slope
of the curve at ω0. We can therefore state the following for our example:
lim
ω→0
ω
β = dω
dβ

ω0
= νg(ω0)
(85)
The quantity dω/dβ is called the group velocity function for the material, νg(ω). When
evaluated at a speciﬁed frequency ω0, it represents the velocity of a group of frequen-
cies within a spectral packet of vanishingly small width, centered at frequency ω0. In
stating this, we have extended our two-frequency example to include waves that have a
continuous frequency spectrum. Each frequency component (or packet) is associated
with a group velocity at which the energy in that packet propagates. Since the slope
of the ω-β curve changes with frequency, group velocity will obviously be a function
of frequency. The group velocity dispersion of the medium is, to the ﬁrst order, the
rate at which the slope of the ω-β curve changes with frequency. It is this behavior
that is of critical practical importance to the propagation of modulated waves within
dispersive media and to understanding the extent to which the modulation envelope
may degrade with propagation distance.

PULSE BROADENING
IN DISPERSIVE MEDIA
To see how a dispersive medium affects a modulated wave, let us consider the prop-
agation of an electromagnetic pulse. Pulses are used in digital signals, where the
presence or absence of a pulse in a given time slot corresponds to a digital “one” or
“zero.” The effect of the dispersive medium on a pulse is to broaden it in time. To
see how this happens, we consider the pulse spectrum, which is found through the
Fourier transform of the pulse in time domain. In particular, suppose the pulse shape
in time is Gaussian, and has electric ﬁeld given at position z = 0 by
E(0, t) = E0e−1
2 (t/T )2e jω0t
(86)
where E0 is a constant, ω0 is the carrier frequency, and T is the characteristic half-
width of the pulse envelope; this is the time at which the pulse intensity, or magnitude
of the Poynting vector, falls to 1/e of its maximum value (note that intensity is
proportional to the square of the electric ﬁeld). The frequency spectrum of the pulse
is the Fourier transform of (86), which is
E(0, ω) = E0T
√
2π
e−1
2 T 2(ω−ω0)2
(87)
Note from (87) that the frequency displacement from ω0 at which the spectral intensity
(proportional to |E(0, ω)|2) falls to 1/e of its maximum is ω = ω −ω0 = 1/T .
Figure 12.14a shows the Gaussian intensity spectrum of the pulse, centered at
ω0, where the frequencies corresponding to the 1/e spectral intensity positions, ωa
and ωb, are indicated. Figure 12.14b shows the same three frequencies marked on
the ω-β curve for the medium. Three lines are drawn that are tangent to the curve at
the three frequency locations. The slopes of the lines indicate the group velocities at
ωa, ωb, and ω0, indicated as νga, νgb, and νg0. We can think of the pulse spreading
in time as resulting from the differences in propagation times of the spectral energy
packets that make up the pulse spectrum. Since the pulse spectral energy is highest

at the center frequency, ω0, we can use this as a reference point about which further
spreading of the energy will occur. For example, let us consider the difference in
arrival times (group delays) between the frequency components, ω0 and ωb, after
propagating through a distance z of the medium:

The essential point is that the medium is acting as what could be called a temporal
prism. Instead of spreading out the spectral energy packets spatially, it is spreading

them out in time. In this process, a new temporal pulse envelope is constructed whose
width is based fundamentally on the spread of propagation delays of the different
spectral components. By determining the delay difference between the peak spectral
component and the component at the spectral half-width, we construct an expression
for the new temporal half-width. This assumes, of course, that the initial pulse width
is negligible in comparison, but if not, we can account for that also, as will be shown
later on.
To evaluate (88), we need more information about the ω-β curve. If we assume
that the curve is smooth and has fairly uniform curvature, we can express β(ω) as the
ﬁrst three terms of a Taylor series expansion about the carrier frequency, ω0:
β(ω) .= β(ω0) + (ω −ω0)β1 + 1
2(ω −ω0)2β2

Note that if the ω-β curve were a straight line, then the ﬁrst two terms in (89) would
precisely describe β(ω). It is the third term in (89), involving β2, that describes the
curvature and ultimately the dispersion.
Noting that β0, β1, and β2 are constants, we take the ﬁrst derivative of (89) with
respect to ω to ﬁnd
dβ
dω = β1 + (ω −ω0)β2
(92)
We now substitute (92) into (88) to obtain
τ = [β1 + (ωb −ω0)β2] z −[β1 + (ω0 −ω0)β2] z = ωβ2z = β2z
T
(93)
where ω = (ωb−ω0) = 1/T . β2, as deﬁned in Eq. (91), is the dispersion parameter.
Its units are in general time2/distance, that is, pulse spread in time per unit spectral
bandwidth, per unit distance. In optical ﬁbers, for example, the units most commonly
used are picoseconds2/kilometer (psec2/km). β2 can be determined when we know
how β varies with frequency, or it can be measured.
If the initial pulse width is very short compared to τ, then the broadened pulse
width at location z will be simply τ. If the initial pulse width is comparable to τ,
then the pulse width at z can be found through the convolution of the initial Gaussian

446
ENGINEERING ELECTROMAGNETICS
pulse envelope of width T with a Gaussian envelope whose width is τ. Thus, in
general, the pulse width at location z will be
T ′ =

T 2 + (τ)2
(94)
EXAMPLE 12.11
An optical ﬁber link is known to have dispersion β2 = 20 ps2/km. A Gaussian light
pulse at the input of the ﬁber is of initial width T = 10 ps. Determine the width of
the pulse at the ﬁber output if the ﬁber is 15 km long.
Solution. The pulse spread will be
τ = β2z
T
= (20)(15)
10
= 30 ps
So the output pulse width is
T ′ =

(10)2 + (30)2 = 32 ps
An interesting by-product of pulse broadening through chromatic dispersion is
that the broadened pulse is chirped. This means that the instantaneous frequency
of the pulse varies monotonically (either increases or decreases) with time over the
pulse envelope. This again is just a manifestation of the broadening mechanism, in
which the spectral components at different frequencies are spread out in time as they
propagate at different group velocities. We can quantify the effect by calculating the
group delay, τg, as a function of frequency, using (92). We obtain:
τg = z
νg
= z dβ
dω = (β1 + (ω −ω0)β2) z
(95)
This equation tells us that the group delay will be a linear function of frequency
and that higher frequencies will arrive at later times if β2 is positive. We refer to
the chirp as positive if the lower frequencies lead the higher frequencies in time
[requiring a positive β2 in (95)]; chirp is negative if the higher frequencies lead in time
(negative β2). Figure 12.15 shows the broadening effect and illustrates the chirping
phenomenon.
D12.6. For the ﬁber link of Example 12.11, a 20-ps pulse is input instead of
the 10-ps pulse in the example. Determine the output pulsewidth.
Ans. 25 ps
As a ﬁnal point, we note that the pulse bandwidth, ω, was found to be 1/T .
This is true as long as the Fourier transform of the pulse envelope is taken, as was
done with (86) to obtain (87). In that case, E0 was taken to be a constant, and so the
only time variation arose from the carrier wave and the Gaussian envelope. Such a

under the second trace to demonstrate the chirping effect
as the pulse broadens. Note the reduced amplitude of the
broadened pulse, which occurs because the pulse energy
(the area under the intensity envelope) is constant.
pulse, whose frequency spectrum is obtained only from the pulse envelope, is known
as transform-limited. In general, however, additional frequency bandwidth may be
present since E0 may vary with time for one reason or another (such as phase noise
that could be present on the carrier). In these cases, pulse broadening is found from
the more general expression
τ = ωβ2z
(96)
where ω is the net spectral bandwidth arising from all sources. Clearly, transform-
limited pulses are preferred in order to minimize broadening because these will have
the smallest spectral width for a given pulse width.

Guided Waves

n this chapter, we investigate several structures for guiding electromagnetic
waves, and we explore the principles by which these operate. Included are trans-
mission lines, which we ﬁrst explored from the viewpoint of their currents and
voltages in Chapter 10, and which we now revisit from a ﬁelds point of view. We
then broaden the discussion to include several waveguiding devices. Broadly deﬁned,
a waveguide is a structure through which electromagnetic waves can be transmitted
from point to point and within which the ﬁelds are conﬁned to a certain extent. A
transmission line ﬁts this description, but it is a special case that employs two conduc-
tors, and it propagates a purely TEM ﬁeld conﬁguration. Waveguides in general depart
from these restrictions and may employ any number of conductors and dielectrics—or
as we will see, dielectrics alone and no conductors.
The chapter begins with a presentation of several transmission line structures,
with emphasis on obtaining expressions for the primary constants, L, C, G, and R, for
high- and low-frequency operating regimes. Next, we begin our study of waveguides
by ﬁrst taking a broad view of waveguide devices to obtain a physical understanding
of how they work and the conditions under which they are used. We then explore the
simple parallel-plate structure and distinguish between its operation as a transmission
line and as a waveguide. In this device, the concept of waveguide modes is developed,
as are the conditions under which these will occur. We will study the electric and
magnetic ﬁeld conﬁgurations of the guided modes using simple plane wave models
and the wave equation. We will then study more complicated structures, including
rectangular waveguides, dielectric slab waveguides, and optical ﬁbers. ■
13.1
TRANSMISSION LINE FIELDS
AND PRIMARY CONSTANTS
We begin by establishing the equivalence between transmission line operations when
considering voltage and current, from the point of view of the ﬁelds within the line.
Consider, for example, the parallel-plate line shown in Figure 13.1. In the line, we

current distributions along the length is associated with transverse

assume that the plate spacing, d, is much less than the line width, b (into the page),
so electric and magnetic ﬁelds can be assumed to be uniform within any transverse
plane. Lossless propagation is also assumed. Figure 13.1 shows the side view, which
includes the propagation axis z. The ﬁelds, along with the voltage and current, are
shown at an instant in time.
The voltage and current in phasor form are:
Vs(z) = V0e−jβz
(1a)
Is(z) = V0
Z0
e−jβz
(1b)
where Z0 = √L/C. The electric ﬁeld in a given transverse plane at location z is just
the parallel-plate capacitor ﬁeld:
Esx(z) = Vs
d = V0
d e−jβz
(2a)
The magnetic ﬁeld is equal to the surface current density, assumed uniform, on either
plate [Eq. (12), Chapter 7]:
Hsy(z) = Ksz = Is
b = V0
bZ0
e−jβz
(2b)
The two ﬁelds, both uniform, orthogonal, and lying in the transverse plane, are iden-
tical in form to those of a uniform plane wave. As such, they are transverse electro-
magnetic (TEM) ﬁelds, also known simply as transmission-line ﬁelds. They differ
from the ﬁelds of the uniform plane wave only in that they exist within the interior of
the line, and nowhere else.
The power ﬂow down the line is found through the time-average Poynting vector,
integrated over the line cross section. Using (2a) and (2b), we ﬁnd:

The power transmitted by the line is one of the most important quantities that we
wish to know from a practical standpoint. Eq. (3) shows that this can be obtained
consistently through the line ﬁelds, or through the voltage and current. As would be

loss mechanisms (other than conductivity) in addition to the dispersive properties of
the dielectric. The transmission-line ﬁelds are also needed to produce the primary
constants, as we now demonstrate for the parallel-plate line and other selected line
geometries.
We assume the line is ﬁlled with dielectric having permittivity ϵ′, conductivity
σ, and permeability µ, usually µ0 (Figure 13.2). The upper and lower plate thickness
is t, which, along with the plate width b and plate conductivity σc, is used to evaluate
the resistance per unit length parameter R under low-frequency conditions. We will,
however, consider high-frequency operation, in which the skin effect gives an effective
plate thickness or skin depth δ that is much less than t.
First, the capacitance and conductance per unit length are simply those of the
parallel-plate structure, assuming static ﬁelds. Using Eq. (27) from Chapter 6, we ﬁnd
C = ϵ′b
d
(4)
The value of permittivity used should be appropriate for the range of operating
frequencies considered.
The conductance per unit length may be determined easily from the capacitance
expression by use of the simple relation between capacitance and resistance [Eq. (45),
Chapter 6]:
G = σ
ϵ′ C = σb
d
(5)
The evaluation of L and R involves the assumption of a well-developed skin
effect such that δ ≪t. Consequently, the inductance is primarily external because
the magnetic ﬂux within either conductor is negligible compared to that between
conductors. Therefore,
L .= Lext = µd
b
(6)
Note that LextC = µϵ′ = 1/ν2
p, and we are therefore able to evaluate the external
inductance for any transmission line for which we know the capacitance and insulator
characteristics.
The last of the four parameters that we need is the resistance R per unit length.
If the frequency is very high and the skin depth δ is very small, then we obtain an

456
ENGINEERING ELECTROMAGNETICS
appropriate expression for R by distributing the total current uniformly throughout
a depth δ. The skin effect resistance (through both conductors in series over a unit
length) is
R =

impedance of the line here with the parameter formulas:

If necessary, a more accurate value may be obtained from Eq. (47), Chapter 10. Note

Coaxial (High Frequencies)
We next consider a coaxial cable in which the dielectric has an inner radius a and
outer radius b (Figure 13.3). The capacitance per unit length, obtained as Eq. (5) of
Section 6.3, is
C =
2πϵ′
ln(b/a)
(9)

Now, using the relation RC = ϵ/σ (see Problem 6.6), the conductance is
G =
2πσ
ln(b/a)
(10)
where σ is the conductivity of the dielectric between the conductors at the operating
frequency.
The inductance per unit length was computed for the coaxial cable as Eq. (50) in
Section 8.10,
Lext = µ
2π ln(b/a)
(11)
Again, this is an external inductance, for the small skin depth precludes any appre-
ciable magnetic ﬂux within the conductors.
For a circular conductor of radius a and conductivity σc, we let Eq. (90) of
Section 11.4 apply to a unit length, obtaining
Rinner =
1
2πaδσc
There is also a resistance for the outer conductor, which has an inner radius b. We
assume the same conductivity σc and the same value of skin depth δ, leading to
Router =

Because the line current ﬂows through these two resistances in series, the total resis-
tance is the sum:

13.1.2
Coaxial (Low Frequencies)
We now obtain the coaxial line parameter values at very low frequencies where there
is no appreciable skin effect and the current is assumed to be distributed uniformly
throughout the conductor cross sections.
We ﬁrst note that the current distribution in the conductor does not affect either
the capacitance or conductance per unit length. Therefore,
C =
2πϵ′
ln(b/a)
(14)
and
G =
2πσ
ln(b/a)
(15)
The resistance per unit length may be calculated by dc methods, R = l/(σcS), where
l = 1 m and σc is the conductivity of the outer and inner conductors. The area of the

center conductor is πa2 and that of the outer is π(c2 −b2). Adding the two resistance
values, we have

(16)
Only one of the four parameter values remains to be found, the inductance per unit
length. The external inductance that we calculated at high frequencies is the greatest
part of the total inductance. To it, however, must be added smaller terms representing
the internal inductances of the inner and outer conductors.
At very low frequencies where the current distribution is uniform, the internal
inductance of the center conductor is the subject of Problem 43 in Chapter 8; the
relationship is also given as Eq. (62) in Section 8.10:
La,int = µ

The determination of the internal inductance of the outer shell is a more difﬁcult
problem, and most of the work was requested in Problem 36 in Chapter 8. There,
we found that the energy stored per unit length in an outer cylindrical shell of inner

Coaxial (Intermediate Frequencies)
There still remains the frequency interval where the skin depth is neither very much
larger than nor very much smaller than the radius. In this case, the current distribution
is governed by Bessel functions, and both the resistance and internal inductance are
complicated expressions. Values are tabulated in the handbooks, and it is necessary to
use them for very small conductor sizes at high frequencies and for larger conductor
sizes used in power transmission at low frequencies.1
1 Bessel functions are discussed within the context of optical ﬁber in Section 13.7. The current
distribution, internal inductance, and internal resistance of round wires is discussed (with numerical
examples) in Weeks, pp. 35–44. See the References at the end of this chapter.

13.1.6
Microstrip Line (Low Frequencies)
Microstrip line is one example of a class of conﬁgurations involving planar conduc-
tors of ﬁnite widths on or within dielectric substrates; they are usually employed
as device interconnects for microelectronic circuitry. The microstrip conﬁguration,
shown in Figure 13.5, consists of a dielectric (assumed lossless) of thickness d and of
permittivity ϵ′ = ϵrϵ0, sandwiched between a conducting ground plane and a narrow
conducting strip of width w. The region above the top strip is air (assumed here) or
a dielectric of lower permittivity.
The structure approaches the case of the parallel-plate line if w ≫d. In a
microstrip, such an assumption is generally not valid, and so signiﬁcant charge den-
sities exist on both surfaces of the upper conductor. The resulting electric ﬁeld, origi-
nating at the top conductor and terminating on the bottom conductor, will exist within

both substrate and air regions. The same is true for the magnetic ﬁeld, which cir-
culates around the top conductor. This electromagnetic ﬁeld conﬁguration cannot
propagate as a purely TEM wave because wave velocities within the two media will
differ. Instead, waves having z components of E and H occur, with the z component
magnitudes established so that the air and dielectric ﬁelds do achieve equal phase
velocities (the reasoning behind this will be explained in Section 13.6). Analyzing
the structure while allowing for the special ﬁelds is complicated, but it is usually
permissible to approach the problem under the assumption of negligible z compo-
nents. This is the quasi TEM approximation, in which the static ﬁelds (obtainable
through numerical solution of Laplace’s equation, for example) are used to evaluate
the primary constants. Accurate results are obtained at low frequencies (below 1 or
2 GHz). At higher frequencies, results obtained through the static ﬁelds can still be
used but in conjunction with appropriate modifying functions. We will consider the
simple case of low-frequency operation and assume lossless propagation.2
To begin, it is useful to consider the microstrip line characteristics when the
dielectric is not present. Assuming that both conductors have very small thicknesses,
the internal inductance will be negligible, and so the phase velocity within the air-ﬁlled
line, νp0, will be
νp0 =
1
√LextC0
=
1
√µ0ϵ0
= c
(27a)
where C0 is the capacitance of the air-ﬁlled line (obtained from the electric ﬁeld for
that case), and c is the velocity of light. With the dielectric in place, the capacitance
changes, but the inductance does not, provided the dielectric permeability is µ0. Using
(27a), the phase velocity now becomes
νp =

√ϵr,eff

where the effective dielectric constant for the microstrip line is

(28)
It is implied from (28) that the microstrip capacitance C would result if both the
air and substrate regions were ﬁlled homogeneously with material having dielectric
constant ϵr,eff. The effective dielectric constant is a convenient parameter to use
2 The high-frequency case is treated in detail in Edwards (Reference 2).

462
ENGINEERING ELECTROMAGNETICS
because it provides a way of unifying the effects of the dielectric and the conduc-
tor geometry. To see this, consider the two extreme cases involving large and small
width-to-height ratios, w/d. If w/d is very large, then the line resembles the parallel-
plate line, in which nearly all of the electric ﬁeld exists within the dielectric. In this
case ϵr,eff .= ϵr. On the other hand, for a very narrow top strip, or small w/d, the
dielectric and air regions contain roughly equal amounts of electric ﬂux. In that case,
the effective dielectric constant approaches its minimum, given by the average of the
two dielectric constants. We therefore obtain the range of allowed values of ϵr,eff:
1
2(ϵr + 1) < ϵr,eff < ϵr
(29)
The physical interpretation of ϵr,eff is that it is a weighted average of the dielectric
constants of the substrate and air regions, with the weighting determined by the extent
to which the electric ﬁeld ﬁlls either region. We may thus write the effective dielectric
constant in terms of a ﬁeld ﬁlling factor, q, for the substrate:
ϵr,eff = 1 + q(ϵr −1)
(30)
where 0.5 < q < 1. With large w/d, q →1; with small w/d, q →0.5.
Now,thecharacteristicimpedancesoftheair-ﬁlledlineandthelinewithdielectric
substrate are, respectively, Zair
0 = √Lext/C0 and Z0 = √LextC. Then, using (28), we
ﬁnd
Z0 =
Zair
0
√ϵr,eff
(31)
A procedure for obtaining the characteristic impedance would be to ﬁrst evaluate the
air-ﬁlled impedance for a given w/d. Then, knowing the effective dielectric constant,
determine the actual impedance using (31). Another problem would be to determine
the required ratio w/d for a given substrate material in order to achieve a desired
characteristic impedance.
Detailed analyses have led to numerous approximation formulas for the evalua-
tion of ϵr,eff, Zair
0 , and Z0 within different regimes (again, see Reference 2 and the ref-
erences therein). For example, with dimensions restricted such that 1.3 < w/d < 3.3,
applicable formulas include:

BASIC WAVEGUIDE OPERATION
Waveguides assume many different forms that depend on the purpose of the guide
and on the frequency of the waves to be transmitted. The simplest form (in terms of
analysis) is the parallel-plate guide shown in Figure 13.6. Other forms are the hollow-
pipe guides, including the rectangular waveguide of Figure 13.7, and the cylindrical
guide, shown in Figure 13.8. Dielectric waveguides, used primarily at optical fre-
quencies, include the slab waveguide of Figure 13.9 and the optical ﬁber, shown in
Figure 13.10. Each of these structures possesses certain advantages over the others,
depending on the application and the frequency of the waves to be transmitted. All
guides, however, exhibit the same basic operating principles, which we will explore
in this section.
To develop an understanding of waveguide behavior, we consider the parallel-
plate waveguide of Figure 13.6. At ﬁrst, we recognize this as one of the transmission-
line structures that we investigated in Section 13.1. So the ﬁrst question that arises is:

Figure 13.1, which shows the ﬁelds when the line operates as a transmission line. As
we saw earlier, a sinusoidal voltage wave, with voltage applied between conductors,
leads to an electric ﬁeld that is directed vertically between the conductors as shown.
Because current ﬂows only in the z direction, magnetic ﬁeld will be oriented in and out
of the page (in the y direction). The interior ﬁelds comprise a plane electromagnetic
wave which propagates in the z direction (as the Poynting vector will show), since
both ﬁelds lie in the transverse plane. We refer to this as a transmission-line wave,

which, as discussed in Section 13.1, is a transverse electromagnetic, or TEM, wave.
The wavevector k, shown in Figure 13.1, indicates the direction of wave travel as well
as the direction of power ﬂow.
As the frequency is increased, a remarkable change occurs in the way the ﬁelds
progagate down the line. Although the original ﬁeld conﬁguration of Figure 13.1 may
still be present, another possibility emerges, which is shown in Figure 13.11. Again,
a plane wave is guided in the z direction, but by means of a progression of zig-zag
reﬂections at the upper and lower plates. Wavevectors ku and kd are associated with
the upward-and downward-propagating waves, respectively, and these have identical
magnitudes,
|ku| = |kd| = k = ω√µϵ
For such a wave to propagate, all upward-propagating waves must be in phase (as
must be true of all downward-propagating waves). This condition can only be satisﬁed
at certain discrete angles of incidence, shown as θ in Figure 13.11. An allowed value
of θ, along with the resulting ﬁeld conﬁguration, comprise a waveguide mode of the
structure. Associated with each guided mode is a cutoff frequency. If the operating
frequency is below the cutoff frequency, the mode will not propagate. If above cutoff,

In a parallel-plate waveguide, plane waves can
propagate by oblique reflection from the conducting walls. This
produces a waveguide mode that is not TEM.

the mode propagates. The TEM mode, however, has no cutoff; it will be supported
at any frequency. At a given frequency, the guide may support several modes, the
quantity of which depends on the plate separation and on the dielectric constant
of the interior medium, as will be shown. The number of modes increases as the
frequency is raised.
So to answer our initial question on the distinction between transmission lines
and waveguides, we can state the following: Transmission lines consist of two or
more conductors and as a rule will support TEM waves (or something which could
approximate such a wave). A waveguide may consist of one or more conductors, or
no conductors at all, and will support waveguide modes of forms similar to those
just described. Waveguides may or may not support TEM waves, depending on the
design.
In the parallel-plate guide, two types of waveguide modes can be supported.
These are shown in Figure 13.12 as arising from the s and p orientations of the plane
wave polarizations. In a manner consistent with our previous discussions on oblique
reﬂection (Section 12.5), we identify a transverse electric or TE mode when E is
perpendicular to the plane of incidence (s-polarized); this positions E parallel to the
transverse plane of the waveguide, as well as to the boundaries. Similarly, a transverse
magnetic or TM mode results with a p polarized wave; the entire H ﬁeld is in the
y direction and is thus within the transverse plane of the guide. Both possibilities
are illustrated in Figure 13.12. Note, for example, that with E in the y direction
(TE mode), H will have x and z components. Likewise, a TM mode will have
x and z components of E.3 In any event, the reader can verify from the geome-
try of Figure 13.12 that it is not possible to achieve a purely TEM mode for val-
ues of θ other than 90◦. Other wave polarizations are possible that lie between the
TE and TM cases, but these can always be expressed as superpositions of TE and
TM modes.
3 Other types of modes can exist in other structures (not the parallel-plate guide) in which both E and
H have z components. These are known as hybrid modes, and they typically occur in guides with
cylindrical cross sections, such as the optical ﬁber.

13.3
PLANE WAVE ANALYSIS OF THE
PARALLEL-PLATE WAVEGUIDE
Let us now investigate the conditions under which waveguide modes will occur,
using our plane wave model for the mode ﬁelds. In Figure 13.13a, a zig-zag path
is again shown, but this time phase fronts are drawn that are associated with two
of the upward-propagating waves. The ﬁrst wave has reﬂected twice (at the top and
bottom surfaces) to form the second wave (the downward-propagating phase fronts
are not shown). Note that the phase fronts of the second wave do not coincide with
those of the ﬁrst wave, and so the two waves are out of phase. In Figure 13.13b,
the wave angle has been adjusted so that the two waves are now in phase. Having
satisﬁed this condition for the two waves, we will ﬁnd that all upward-propagating
waves will have coincident phase fronts. The same condition will automatically occur
for all downward-propagating waves. This is the requirement to establish a guided
mode.
In Figure 13.14 we show the wavevector, ku, and its components, along with a
series of phase fronts. A drawing of this kind for kd would be the same, except the

propagation in a parallel-plate guide in
which the wave angle is such that the
upward-propagating waves are not in
phase. (b) The wave angle has been
adjusted so that the upward waves are
in phase, resulting in a guided mode.

x component, κm, would be reversed. In Section 12.4, we measured the phase shift
per unit distance along the x and z directions by the components, kx and kz, which
varied continuously as the direction of k changed. In our discussion of waveguides,
we introduce a different notation, where κm and βm are used for kx and kz. The
subscript m is an integer indicating the mode number. This provides a subtle hint that
βm and κm will assume only certain discrete values that correspond to certain allowed
directions of ku and kd, such that our coincident phase front requirement is satisﬁed.4
From the geometry we see that for any value of m,
βm =

k2 −κ2m
(35)
Use of the symbol βm for the z components of ku and kd is appropriate because βm
will ultimately be the phase constant for the mth waveguide mode, measuring phase
shift per distance down the guide; it is also used to determine the phase velocity of
the mode, ω/βm, and the group velocity, dω/dβm.
Throughout our discussion, we will assume that the medium within the guide is
lossless and nonmagnetic, so that

which we express either in terms of the dielectric constant, ϵ′
r, or the refractive index,
n, of the medium.
It is κm, the x component of ku and kd, that will be useful to us in quantifying
our requirement on coincident phase fronts through a condition known as transverse
resonance. This condition states that the net phase shift measured during a round trip
over the full transverse dimension of the guide must be an integer multiple of 2π
radians. This is another way of stating that all upward- (or downward-) propagating
plane waves must have coincident phases. The various segments of this round trip are
illustrated in Figure 13.15. We assume for this exercise that the waves are frozen in
time and that an observer moves vertically over the round trip, measuring phase shift
along the way. In the ﬁrst segment (Figure 13.15a), the observer starts at a position
just above the lower conductor and moves vertically to the top conductor through
distance d. The measured phase shift over this distance is κmd rad. On reaching the
top surface, the observer will note a possible phase shift on reﬂection (Figure 13.15b).
This will be π if the wave is TE polarized and will be zero if the wave is TM polarized
(see Figure 13.16 for a demonstration of this). Next, the observer moves along the
reﬂected wave phases down to the lower conductor and again measures a phase shift
of κmd (Figure 13.15c). Finally, after including the phase shift on reﬂection at the
bottom conductor, the observer is back at the original starting point and is noting the
phase of the next upward-propagating wave.
The total phase shift over the round trip is required to be an integer multiple
of 2π:
κmd + φ + κmd + φ = 2mπ
(37)
where φ is the phase shift on reﬂection at each boundary. Note that with φ = π
(TE waves) or 0 (TM waves), the net reﬂective phase shift over a round trip is 2π or 0,
regardless of the angle of incidence. Thus the reﬂective phase shift has no bearing on
the current problem, and we may simplify (37) to read
κm = mπ
d
(38)
which is valid for both TE and TM modes. Note from Figure 13.14 that κm = k cos θm.
Thus the wave angles for the allowed modes are readily found from (38) with (36):

phase shift in the reflected (downward)
wave is measured, while accounting for
the reflective phase shift at the top plate
(b); finally, the phase shift on reflection at
the bottom plate is added, thus returning
to the starting position, but with a new
upward wave (c). Transverse resonance
occurs if the phase at the final point is the
same as that at the starting point (the two
upward waves are in phase).

The phase shift of a wave on reflection from a perfectly conducting surface
depends on whether the incident wave is TE (s-polarized) or TM (p-polarized). In both
drawings, electric fields are shown as they would appear immediately adjacent to the
conducting boundary. In (a) the field of a TE wave reverses direction upon reflection to
establish a zero net field at the boundary. This constitutes a π phase shift, as is evident by
considering a fictitious transmitted wave (dashed line) formed by a simple rotation of the
reflected wave into alignment with the incident wave. In (b) an incident TM wave experiences
a reversal of the z component of its electric field. The resultant field of the reflected wave,
however, has not been phase-shifted; rotating the reflected wave into alignment with the
incident wave (dashed line) shows this.

The signiﬁcance of the cutoff frequency is readily seen from (42): If the operating
frequency ω is greater than the cutoff frequency for mode m, then that mode will have
phase constant βm that is real-valued, and so the mode will propagate. For ω < ωcm,
βm is imaginary, and the mode does not propagate.
Associated with the cutoff frequency is the cutoff wavelength, λcm, deﬁned as the
free-space wavelength at which cutoff for mode m occurs. This will be

Note, for example, that in an air-ﬁlled guide (n = 1) the wavelength at which the

one-half wavelength. Mode m will propagate whenever ω > ωcm, or equivalently
whenever λ < λcm. Use of the cutoff wavelength enables us to construct a second

r = 2.1. Determine the maximum operating frequency
such that only the TEM mode will propagate. Also ﬁnd the range of frequencies
over which the TE1 and TM1 (m = 1) modes, and no higher-order modes, will

will be

√
2.1
= 1.03 × 1010 Hz = 10.3 GHz
To propagate only TEM waves, we must have f < 10.3 GHz. To allow TE1 and
TM1 (along with TEM) only, the frequency range must be ωc1 < ω < ωc2, where
ωc2 = 2ωc1, from (41). Thus, the frequencies at which we will have the m = 1 modes
and TEM will be 10.3 GHz < f < 20.6 GHz.
EXAMPLE 13.2
In the parallel-plate guide of Example 13.1, the operating wavelength is λ = 2 mm.
How many waveguide modes will propagate?
Solution. For mode m to propagate, the requirement is λ < λcm. For the given wave-
guide and wavelength, the inequality becomes, using (43),
2 mm < 2

Thus the guide will support modes at the given wavelength up to order m = 14. Since
there will be a TE and a TM mode for each value of m, this gives, not including the
TEM mode, a total of 28 guided modes that are above cutoff.

CHAPTER 13

The ﬁeld conﬁguration for a given mode can be found through the superposition
of the ﬁelds of all the reﬂected waves. We can do this for the TE waves, for example,
by writing the electric ﬁeld phasor in the guide in terms of incident and reﬂected ﬁelds
through
Eys = E0e−jku·r −E0e−jkd·r
(45)
where the wavevectors, ku and kd, are indicated in Figure 13.12. The minus sign in
front of the second term arises from the π phase shift on reﬂection. From the geometry
depicted in Figure 13.14, we write
ku = κmax + βmaz
(46)
and
kd = −κmax + βmaz
(47)
Then, using

Eq. (45) becomes
Eys = E0(e−jκmx −e jkmx)e−jβmz = 2 j E0 sin(κmx)e−jβmz = E′
0 sin(κmx)e−jβmz
(48)
where the plane wave amplitude, E0, and the overall phase are absorbed into E′

0 sin(κmx) cos(ωt −βmz)
(TE mode above cutoff)
(49)
We interpret this as a wave that propagates in the positive z direction (down the guide)
while having a ﬁeld proﬁle that varies with x.5 The TE mode ﬁeld is the interference
pattern resulting from the superposition of the upward and downward plane waves.
Note that if ω < ωcm, then (42) yields an imaginary value for βm, which we may
write as −j|βm| = −jαm. Eqs. (48) and (49) then become
Eys = E′
0 sin(κmx)e−αmz
(50)
E(z, t) = E′
0 sin(κmx)e−αmz cos(ωt)
(TE mode below cutoff)
(51)
This mode does not propagate, but simply oscillates at frequency ω, while exhibiting
a ﬁeld pattern that decreases in strength with increasing z. The attenuation coefﬁcient,
αm, is found from (42) with ω < ωcm:

We note from (39) and (41) that the plane wave angle is related to the cutoff
frequency and cutoff wavelength through
cos θm = ωcm
ω

(53)
So we see that at cutoff (ω = ωcm), θm = 0, and the plane waves are just reﬂecting
back and forth over the cross section; they are making no forward progress down
the guide. As ω is increased beyond cutoff (or λ is decreased), the wave angle in-
creases, approaching 90◦as ω approaches inﬁnity (or as λ approaches zero). From
Figure 13.14, we have
βm = k sin θm = nω
c sin θm
(54)
and so the phase velocity of mode m will be
νpm = ω
βm
=
c
n sin θm
(55)
The velocity minimizes at c/n for all modes, approaching this value at frequencies
far above cutoff; νpm approaches inﬁnity as the frequency is reduced to approach the
cutoff frequency. Again, phase velocity is the speed of the phases in the z direction,
and the fact that this velocity may exceed the speed of light in the medium is not a
violation of relativistic principles, as discussed in Section 12.7.
The energy will propagate at the group velocity, νg = dω/dβ. Using (42), we

In the guide of Example 13.1, the operating frequency is 25 GHz. Consequently,
modes for which m = 1 and m = 2 will be above cutoff. Determine the group delay

PARALLEL-PLATE GUIDE ANALYSIS
USING THE WAVE EQUATION
The most direct approach in the analysis of any waveguide is through the wave
equation, which we solve subject to the boundary conditions at the conducting walls.
The form of the equation that we will use is that of Eq. (28) in Section 11.1, which was
written for the case of free-space propagation. We account for the dielectric properties
in the waveguide by replacing k0 in that equation with k to obtain:
∇2Es = −k2Es
(58)
where k = nω/c as before.
We can use the results of the last section to help us visualize the process of solving
the wave equation. For example, we may consider TE modes ﬁrst, in which there will
be only a y component of E. The wave equation becomes:
∂2Eys
∂x2
+ ∂2Eys
∂y2
+ ∂2Eys
∂z2
+ k2Eys = 0
(59)
We assume that the width of the guide (in the y direction) is very large compared to
the plate separation d. Therefore we can assume no y variation in the ﬁelds (fringing
ﬁelds are ignored), and so ∂2Eys/∂y2 = 0. We also know that the z variation will be
of the form e−jβmz. The form of the ﬁeld solution will thus be
Eys = E0 fm(x)e−jβmz
(60)
where E0 is a constant, and where fm(x) is a normalized function to be determined
(whose maximum value is unity). We have included subscript m on β, κ, and f (x),
since we anticipate several solutions that correspond to discrete modes, to which we
associate mode number m. We now substitute (60) into (59) to obtain

fm(x) = 0
(61)
where E0 and e−jβmz have divided out, and where we have used the fact that

Note also that we have written (61) using the total derivative d2/dx2, as fm is a
function only of x. We next make use of the geometry of Figure 13.14, and we note

that k2 −β2
m = κ2
m. Using this in (61) we obtain
d2fm(x)
dx2
+ κ2
m fm(x) = 0
(62)
The general solution of (62) will be
fm(x) = cos(κmx) + sin(κmx)
(63)
We next apply the appropriate boundary conditions in our problem to evaluate
κm. From Figure 13.6, conducting boundaries appear at x = 0 and x = d, at which
the tangential electric ﬁeld (Ey) must be zero. In Eq. (63), only the sin(κmx) term
will allow the boundary conditions to be satisﬁed, so we retain it and drop the cosine
term. The x = 0 condition is automatically satisﬁed by the sine function. The x = d
condition is met when we choose the value of κm such that
κm = mπ
d
(64)
We recognize Eq. (64) as the same result that we obtained using the transverse res-
onance condition of Section 13.3. The ﬁnal form of Eys is obtained by substituting
fm(x) as expressed through (63) and (64) into (60), yielding a result that is consistent
with the one expressed in Eq. (48):
Eys = E0 sin
mπx
d

e−jβmz
(65)
An additional signiﬁcance of the mode number m is seen when considering the
form of the electric ﬁeld of (65). Speciﬁcally, m is the number of spatial half-cycles
of electric ﬁeld that occur over the distance d in the transverse plane. This can be
understood physically by considering the behavior of the guide at cutoff. As we
learned in the last section, the plane wave angle of incidence in the guide at cutoff
is zero, meaning that the wave simply bounces up and down between the conducting
walls. The wave must be resonant in the structure, which means that the net round
trip phase shift is 2mπ. With the plane waves oriented vertically, βm = 0, and so
κm = k = 2nπ/λcm. So at cutoff,
mπ
d
= 2nπ

(66)
which leads to
d = mλcm

The waveguide is simply a one-dimensional resonant cavity, in which a wave can
oscillate in the x direction if its wavelength as measured in the medium is an integer
multiple of 2d where the integer is m.

(a) A plane wave associated
with an m = 4 mode, showing a net phase
shift of 4π (two wavelengths measured in x)
occurring over distance d in the transverse
plane. (b) As frequency increases, an increase
in wave angle is required to maintain the 4π
transverse phase shift.
Now, as the frequency increases, wavelength will decrease, and so the require-
ment of wavelength equaling an integer multiple of 2d is no longer met. The response
of the mode is to establish z components of ku and kd, which results in the de-
creased wavelength being compensated by an increase in wavelength as measured
in the x direction. Figure 13.17 shows this effect for the m = 4 mode, in which the
wave angle, θ4, steadily increases with increasing frequency. Thus, the mode retains
precisely the functional form of its ﬁeld in the x direction, but it establishes an increas-
ing value of βm as the frequency is raised. This invariance in the transverse spatial
pattern means that the mode will retain its identity at all frequencies. Group velocity,
expressed in (57), is changing as well, meaning that the changing wave angle with
frequency is a mechanism for group velocity dispersion, known simply as waveguide
dispersion. Pulses, for example, that propagate in a single waveguide mode will thus
experience broadening in the manner considered in Section 12.8.
Having found the electric ﬁeld, we can ﬁnd the magnetic ﬁeld using Maxwell’s
equations. We note from our plane wave model that we expect to obtain x and z
components of Hs for a TE mode. We use the Maxwell equation
∇× Es = −jωµHs
(69)
where, in the present case of having only a y component of Es, we have
∇× Es = ∂Eys
∂x az −∂Eys
∂z ax = κm E0 cos(κmx)e−jβmzaz + jβm E0 sin(κmx)e−jβmzax
(70)

CHAPTER 13

479
We solve for Hs by dividing both sides of (69) by −jωµ. Performing this operation
on (70), we obtain the two magnetic ﬁeld components:
Hxs = −βm
ωµ E0 sin(κmx)e−jβmz
(71)
Hzs = j κm
ωµ E0 cos(κmx)e−jβmz
(72)
Together, these two components form closed-loop patterns for Hs in the x, z plane,
as can be veriﬁed using the streamline plotting methods developed in Section 2.6.
It is interesting to consider the magnitude of Hs, which is found through
|Hs| =

RECTANGULAR WAVEGUIDES
In this section we consider the rectangular waveguide, a structure that is usually used
in the microwave region of the electromagnetic spectrum. The guide is shown in
Figure 13.7. As always, the propagation direction is along the z axis. The guide is
of width a along x and height b along y. We can relate the geometry to that of the
parallel-plate guide of previous sections by thinking of the rectangular guide as two

480
ENGINEERING ELECTROMAGNETICS
parallel-plate guides of orthogonal orientation that are assembled to form one unit. We
have a pair of horizontal conducting walls (along the x direction) and a pair of vertical
walls (along y), all of which form one continuous boundary. The wave equation in
its full three-dimensional form [Eq. (59)] must now be solved, for in general we may
have ﬁeld variations in all three coordinate directions.
In the parallel-plate guide, we found that the TEM mode can exist, along with
TE and TM modes. The rectangular guide will support the TE and TM modes, but
it will not support a TEM mode. This is because, in contrast to the parallel-plate
guide, we now have a conducting boundary that completely surrounds the transverse
plane. The nonexistence of TEM can be understood by remembering that any electric
ﬁeld must have a zero tangential component at the boundary. This means that it is
impossible to set up an electric ﬁeld that will not exhibit the sideways variation that
is necessary to satisfy this boundary condition. Because E varies in the transverse
plane, the computation of H through ∇× E = −jωµH must lead to a z component
of H, and so we cannot have a TEM mode. We cannot ﬁnd any other orientation of a
completely transverse E in the guide that will allow a completely transverse H.
13.5.1
Using Maxwell’s Equations to Relate Field
Components
With the modes dividing into TE and TM types, the standard approach is to ﬁrst solve
the wave equation for the z components. By deﬁnition, Ez = 0 in a TE mode, and
Hz = 0 in a TM mode. Therefore, we will ﬁnd the TE mode solution by solving
the wave equation for Hz, and we will obtain the TM mode solution by solving for
Ez. Using these results, all transverse ﬁeld components are obtained directly through
Maxwell’s equations. This procedure may sound a little tedious (which it is), but we
can be certain to ﬁnd all the modes this way. First, we will handle the problem of
ﬁnding transverse components in terms of the z components.
To begin the process, we assume that the phasor electric and magnetic ﬁelds will
be forward-z propagating functions that exhibit spatial variation in the xy plane; the
only z variation is that of a forward-propagating wave:
Es(x, y, z) = Es(x, y, 0)e−jβz
(76a)
Hs(x, y, z) = Hs(x, y, 0)e−jβz
(76b)
We can then obtain expressions for the transverse components of the phasor ﬁelds
by evaluating the x and y components of the Maxwell curl equations in sourceless
media. In evaluating the curl, it is evident from (76) that ∂/∂z = −jβ. The result is
∇× Es = −jωµHs →

∂Ezs/∂y + jβEys = −jωµHxs (x component) (77a)
jβExs + ∂Ezs/∂x = jωµHys (y component)
(77b)
∇× Hs = jωϵEs →

∂Hzs/∂y + jβHys = jωϵExs (x component)
(78a)
jβHxs + ∂Hzs/∂x = −jωϵEys (y component)
(78b)
Now, pairs of the above equations can be solved together in order to express the
individual transverse ﬁeld components in terms of derivatives of the z components of

κ is deﬁned in the same manner as in the parallel-plate guide [Eq. (35)]:

(80)
where k = ω√µϵ. In the parallel-plate geometry, we found that discrete values of κ
and β resulted from the analysis, which we then subscripted with the integer mode
number, m (κm and βm). The interpretation of m was the number of ﬁeld maxima that
occurred between plates (in the x direction). In the rectangular guide, ﬁeld variations
will occur in both x and y, and so we will ﬁnd it necessary to assign two integer
subscripts to κ and β, thus leading to
κmp =

k2 −β2mp
(81)
where m and p indicate the number of ﬁeld variations in the x and y directions. The
form of Eq. (81) suggests that plane wave (ray) theory could be used to obtain the
mode ﬁelds in the rectangular guide, as was accomplished in Section 13.3 for the
parallel-plate guide. This is, in fact, the case, and is readily accomplished for cases
in which plane wave reﬂections occur between only two opposing boundaries (either
top to bottom or side to side), and this would be true only for certain TE modes. The
method becomes complicated when reﬂections occur at all four surfaces; but in any
case, the interpretation of κmp is the transverse (xy plane) component of the plane
wave-vector k, while βmp is the z component, as before.
The next step is to solve the wave equation for the z components of E and H,
from which we will ﬁnd the ﬁelds of the TM and TE modes.
13.5.2
TM Modes
Finding the TM modes begins with the wave equation [Eq. (59)], in which derivatives
with respect to z are equivalent to multiplying by jβ. We write the equation for the z

∂2Ezs
∂x2
+ ∂2Ezs
∂y2
+ (k2 −β2
mp)Ezs = 0
(82)
The solution of (82) can be written as a sum of terms, each of which involves the
product of three functions that exhibit individual variation with x, y, and z:
Ezs(x, y, z) =

m,p
Fm(x) G p(y) exp(−jβmp z)
(83)
where the functions Fm(x) and G p(y) (not normalized) are to be determined. Each
term in (83) corresponds to one mode of the guide, and will by itself be a solution
to (82). To determine the functions, a single term in (83) is substituted into (82).
Noting that all derivatives are applied to functions of a single variable (and thus
partial derivatives become total derivatives), and using (81), the result is
G p(y)d2Fm
dx2 + Fm(x)d2G p
dy2 + κ2
mp Fm(x) G p(y) = 0
(84)
in which the exp(−jβmp z) term has divided out. Rearranging (84), we get

(85)
Terms in (85) are grouped such that all of the x variation is in the ﬁrst term, which
varies only with x, and all y variation is in the second term, which varies only with y.
Now, consider what would happen if x is allowed to vary while holding y ﬁxed. The
second and third terms would be ﬁxed, and Eq. (85) must always hold. Therefore, the
x-varying ﬁrst term must be a constant. This constant is denoted −κ2
m, as indicated in
(85). The same is true for the second term, which must also turn out to be a constant
if y is allowed to vary while x is ﬁxed. We assign the second term the constant value
−κ2
p as indicated. Eq. (85) then states that
κ2
mp = κ2
m + κ2
p
(86)
which suggests an immediate geometrical interpretation: As κmp is the transverse
plane component of the wavevector k, κm and κp are clearly the x and y components
of κmp (and of k)—again if one thinks in terms of plane waves and how they would
bounce around in the waveguide to form the overall mode. Also indicated in (86) is
the fact that κm and κp will be functions, respectively, of the integers m and p, as we
will ﬁnd.
Under the above conditions, Eq. (85) will now separate into two equations—one
in each variable:

Equation (87) is now easily solved. We obtain
Fm(x) = Am cos(κmx) + Bm sin(κmx)
(88a)
G p(y) = C p cos(κpy) + Dp sin(κpy)
(88b)
Using these, along with (83), the general solution for z component of Es for a single
TM mode can be constructed:
Ezs = [Am cos(κmx) + Bm sin(κmx)][C p cos(κpy) + Dp sin(κpy)] exp(−jβmp z)
(89)
The constants in (89) can be evaluated by applying the boundary conditions of the
ﬁeld on all four surfaces. Speciﬁcally, as Ezs is tangent to all the conducting surfaces,
it must vanish on all of them. Referring to Figure 13.7, the boundary conditions are
Ezs = 0 at x = 0, y = 0, x = a, and y = b
Obtaining zero ﬁeld at x = 0 and y = 0 is accomplished by dropping the cosine terms
in (89) (setting Am = C p = 0). The values of κm and κp that appear in the remaining
sine terms are then set to the following, in order to assure zero ﬁeld at x = a and
y = b:
κm = mπ
a
(90a)
κp = pπ

Using these results, and deﬁning B = Bm Dp, Eq. (89) becomes:
Ezs = B sin (κmx) sin

exp(−jβmp z)

Now, to ﬁnd the remaining (transverse) ﬁeld components, we substitute Eq. (91a) into

13.5.3
TE Modes
To obtain the TE mode ﬁelds, we solve the wave equation for the z component of H
and then use Eq. (79) as before to ﬁnd the transverse components. The wave equation
is now the same as (82), except that Ezs is replaced by Hzs:
∂2Hzs
∂x2

and the solution is of the form:
Hzs(x, y, z) =

m,p
F′
m(x) G′
p(y) exp(−jβmp z)
(93)
The procedure from here is identical to that involving TM modes, and the general
solution will be
Hzs = [A′
m cos(κmx) + B′
m sin(κmx)][C′
p cos(κpy) + D′
p sin(κpy)] exp(−jβmp z)
(94)
Again, the expression is simpliﬁed by using the appropriate boundary conditions. We
know that tangential electric ﬁeld must vanish on all conducting boundaries. When
we relate the electric ﬁeld to magnetic ﬁeld derivatives using (79c) and (79d), the
following conditions develop:
Exs

y=0,b = 0 ⇒

Requiring this result to be zero at y = 0 and y = b leads to dropping the cos(κpy)
term (set D′
p = 0) and requiring that κp = pπ/b as before. Applying Eq. (95b) to
(94) results in

respect to x. Setting this result to zero at x = 0 and x = a leads to dropping the
cos(κmx) term (setting B′
m = 0), and requiring that κm = mπ/a as before. With all

These ﬁeld components pertain to modes designated TEmp. For these modes, either

cases, as will be discussed later. Some very good illustrations of TE and TM modes
are presented in Ref. 3.

The phase constant for a given mode can be expressed using Eq. (81):
βmp =

As discussed for the parallel-plate guide, it is again clear from (99) that the operating
frequency, ω, must exceed the cutoff frequency, ωCmp, to achieve a real value for
βmp (and thus enabling mode mp to propagate). Equation (100) applies to both TE
and TM modes, and thus some combination of both mode types may be present (or
above cutoff) at a given frequency. It is evident that the choice of guide dimensions,

486

a and b, along with the material properties, ϵr and µr, will determine the number of
modes that will propagate. For the typical case in which µr = 1, using n = √ϵr,
and identifying the speed of light, c = 1/√µ0ϵ0, we may re-write (100) in a manner
consistent with Eq. (41):

λCmp is the free space wavelength at cutoff. If measured in the medium that ﬁlls the

Now, in a manner consistent with Eq. (44), Eq. (99) becomes

where λ is the free space wavelength. As we saw before, a TEmp or TMmp mode can

13.5.5
Special Cases: TEm0 and TE0p Modes
The most important mode in the rectangular guide is the one that can propagate by
itself. As we know, this will be the mode that has the lowest cutoff frequency (or the
highest cutoff wavelength), so that over a certain range of frequencies, this mode will
be above cutoff, while all others are below cutoff. By inspecting Eq. (101), and noting
that a > b, the lowest cutoff frequency will occur for the mode in which m = 1 and
p = 0, which will be the TE10 mode (remember that a TM10 mode does not exist, as
can be shown in (91)). It turns out that this mode, and those of the same general type,
are of the same form as those of the parallel-plate structure.
The speciﬁc ﬁelds for the TEm0 family of modes are obtained from (96a) through
(96e) by setting p = 0, which means, using (86) and (90), that
κm = κmp

p=0 = mπ
a
(104)
and κp = 0. Under these conditions, the only surviving ﬁeld components in (91)
will be Eys, Hxs, and Hzs. It is convenient to deﬁne the ﬁeld equations in terms of
an electric ﬁeld amplitude, E0, which is composed of all the amplitude terms in Eq.
(96e). Speciﬁcally, deﬁne
E0 = −jωµ κm

Substituting (104) and (105) into Eqs. (96e), (96c), and (96a) leads to the following
expressions for the TEm0 mode ﬁelds:
Eys = E0 sin (κmx) e−jβm0z
(106)
Hxs = −βm0
ωµ E0 sin (κmx) e−jβm0z
(107)
Hzs = j κm
ωµ E0 cos(κmx)e−jβm0z
(108)
It can be seen that these expressions are identical to the parallel-plate ﬁelds, Eqs. (65),
(71), and (72). For TEm0, we again note that the subscripts indicate that there are m
half cycles of the electric ﬁeld over the x dimension and there is zero variation in y.
The cutoff frequency for the TEm0 mode is given by (101), appropriately modiﬁed:
ωCm0 = mπc

All of the implications on mode behavior above and below cutoff are exactly the same
as we found for the parallel-plate guide. The plane wave analysis is also carried out in
the same manner. TEm0 modes can be modeled as plane waves that propagate down
the guide by reﬂecting between the vertical side walls.
The electric ﬁeld of the fundamental (TE10) mode is, from (106):
Eys = E0 sin

This ﬁeld is plotted in Figure 13.18a. The ﬁeld is vertically polarized, terminates on
the top and bottom plates, and becomes zero at the two vertical walls, as is required
from our boundary condition on a tangential electric ﬁeld at a conducting surface. Its
cutoff wavelength is found from (102) to be
λC10 = 2na
(112)
which means that cutoff for this mode is achieved when the guide horizontal dimen-
sion, a, is equal to a half-wavelength (as measured in the medium).
Another possibility is the TE0p ﬁeld conﬁguration, which consists of a horizon-
tally polarized electric ﬁeld. Figure 13.18b shows the ﬁeld for TE01. The speciﬁc ﬁelds
for the TE0p family are obtained from Eqs. (96a) through (96e) by setting m = 0,

EXAMPLE 13.4
An air-ﬁlled rectangular waveguide has dimensions a = 2 cm and b = 1 cm. Deter-
mine the range of frequencies over which the guide will operate single mode (TE10).
Solution. Since the guide is air-ﬁlled, n = 1, and (109) gives, for m = 1:
fC10 = ωC10
2π
= c
2a = 3 × 1010
2(2)
= 7.5 GHz
The next higher-order mode will be either TE20 or TE01, which, from (100) will have
the same cutoff frequency because a = 2b. This frequency will be twice that found
for TE10, or 15 GHz. Thus the operating frequency range over which the guide will
be single mode is 7.5 GHz < f < 15 GHz.
Having seen how rectangular waveguides work, questions arise: why are they
used and when are they useful? Let us consider for a moment the operation of a
transmission line at frequencies high enough such that waveguide modes can occur.
The onset of guided modes in a transmission line, known as moding, is in fact a
problem that needs to be avoided, because signal distortion may result. A signal that
is input to such a line will ﬁnd its power divided in some proportions among the
various modes. The signal power in each mode propagates at a group velocity unique
to that mode. With the power thus distributed, distortion will occur over sufﬁcient
distances, as the signal components among the modes lose synchronization with each
other, owing to the different delay times (group delays) associated with the different
modes. We encountered this concept in Example 13.3.
The above problem of modal dispersion in transmission lines is avoided by
ensuring that only the TEM mode propagates, and that all waveguide modes are
below cutoff. This is accomplished either by using line dimensions that are smaller
than one-half the signal wavelength, or by assuring an upper limit to the operating
frequency in a given line. But it is more complicated than this.
In Section 13.1, we saw that increasing the frequency increases the line loss as a
result of the skin effect. This is manifested through the increase in the series resistance
per unit length, R. One can compensate by increasing one or more dimensions in
the line cross section, as shown for example in Eqs. (7) and (12), but only to the
point at which moding may occur. Typically, the increasing loss with increasing
frequency will render the transmission line useless before the onset of moding, but
one still cannot increase the line dimensions to reduce losses without considering the
possibility of moding. This limitation on dimensions also limits the power handling
capability of the line, as the voltage at which dielectric breakdown occurs decreases
with decreasing conductor separation. Consequently, the use of transmission lines,
as frequencies are increased beyond a certain point, becomes undesirable, as losses
will become excessive, and as the limitation on dimensions will limit the power-
handling capability. Instead, we look to other guiding structures, among which is the
rectangular guide.
Because the rectangular guide will not support a TEM mode, it will not operate
until the frequency exceeds the cutoff frequency of the lowest-order guided mode of

490
ENGINEERING ELECTROMAGNETICS
the structure. Thus, the guide must be constructed large enough to accomplish this
for a given frequency; the required transverse dimensions will consequently be larger
than those of a transmission line that is designed to support only the TEM mode. The
increased size, coupled with the fact that there is more conductor surface area than
in a transmission line of equal volume, means that losses will be substantially lower
in the rectangular waveguide structure. Additionally, the guides will support more
power at a given electric ﬁeld strength than a transmission line, as the rectangular
guide will have a higher cross-sectional area.
Still, hollow pipe guides must operate in a single mode in order to avoid the
signal distortion problems arising from multimode transmission. This means that the
guides must be of dimension such that they operate above the cutoff frequency of
the lowest-order mode, but below the cutoff frequency of the next higher-order mode,
as demonstrated in Example 13.4. Increasing the operating frequency again means
that the guide transverse dimensions must be decreased to maintain single mode op-
eration. This can be accomplished to a point at which skin effect losses again become
problematic (remember that the skin depth is decreasing with increasing frequency,
in addition to the decrease in metal surface area with diminishing guide size). In addi-
tion, the guides become too difﬁcult to fabricate, with machining tolerances becoming
more stringent. So again, as frequencies are further increased, we look for another
type of structure.

air-ﬁlled rectangular guide so that it will operate in a single mode over the

13.6
PLANAR DIELECTRIC WAVEGUIDES
When skin effect losses become excessive, a good way to remove them is to remove the
metal in the structure entirely and use interfaces between dielectrics for the conﬁning
surfaces. We thus obtain a dielectric waveguide; a basic form, the symmetric slab
waveguide, is shown in Figure 13.19. The structure is so named because of its vertical
symmetry about the z axis. The guide is assumed to have width in y much greater than
the slab thickness d, so the problem becomes two-dimensional, with ﬁelds presumed
to vary with x and z while being independent of y. The slab waveguide works in
very much the same way as the parallel-plate waveguide, except wave reﬂections
occur at the interfaces between dielectrics, having different refractive indices, n1
for the slab and n2 for the surrounding regions above and below. In the dielectric
guide, total reﬂection is needed, so the incident angle must exceed the critical angle.
Consequently, as discussed in Section 12.6, the slab index, n1, must be greater than
that of the surrounding materials, n2. Dielectric guides differ from conducting guides
in that power is not completely conﬁned to the slab but resides partially above and
below.

CHAPTER 13
Guided Waves

Figure 13.19
Symmetric dielectric slab waveguide structure, in
which waves propagate along z. The guide is assumed to be infinite
in the y direction, thus making the problem two-dimensional.
Dielectric guides are used primarily at optical frequencies (on the order of
1014 Hz). Again, guide transverse dimensions must be kept on the order of a wave-
length to achieve operation in a single mode. A number of fabrication methods can be
used to accomplish this. For example, a glass plate can be doped with materials that
will raise the refractive index. The doping process allows materials to be introduced
only within a thin layer adjacent to the surface that is a few micrometers thick.
Tounderstandhowtheguideoperates,considerFigure13.20,whichshowsawave
propagating through the slab by multiple reﬂections, but where partial transmission
into the upper and lower regions occurs at each bounce. Wavevectors are shown in
the middle and upper regions, along with their components in the x and z directions.
As we found in Chapter 12, the z components (β) of all wavevectors are equal, as
must be true if the ﬁeld boundary conditions at the interfaces are to be satisﬁed for all
positions and times. Partial transmission at the boundaries is, of course, an undesirable
situation, since power in the slab will eventually leak away. We thus have a leaky wave
propagating in the structure, whereas we need to have a guided mode. Note that in
either case, we still have the two possibilities of wave polarization, and the resulting
mode designation—either TE or TM.
Total power reﬂection at the boundaries for TE or TM waves implies, respectively,
that |s|2 or |p|2 is unity, where the reﬂection coefﬁcients are given in Eqs. (71) and
(69) in Chapter 12.
s = η2s −η1s
η2s + η1s
(119)
and
p = η2p −η1p
η2p + η1p
(120)
As discussed in Section 12.6, we require that the effective impedances, η2s or η2p,
be purely imaginary, zero, or inﬁnite if (119) or (120) is to have unity magnitudes.

Now, from the geometry of Figure 13.20, we can construct the ﬁeld distribution

where
k1u = κ1ax + βaz
(127)
and
k1d = −κ1ax + βaz
(128)
The second term in (126) may either add to or subtract from the ﬁrst term, since either
case would result in a symmetric intensity distribution in the x direction. We expect
this because the guide is symmetric. Now, using r = xax + zaz, (126) becomes
Ey1s = E0[e jκ1x + e−jκ1x]e−jβz = 2E0 cos(κ1x)e−jβz
(129)
for the choice of the plus sign in (126), and
Ey1s = E0[e jκ1x −e−jκ1x]e−jβz = 2 j E0 sin(κ1x)e−jβz
(130)
if the minus sign is chosen. Because κ1 = n1k0 cos θ1, we see that larger values of κ1
imply smaller values of θ1 at a given frequency. In addition, larger κ1 values result
in a greater number of spatial oscillations of the electric ﬁeld over the transverse
dimension, as (129) and (130) show. We found similar behavior in the parallel-plate
guide. In the slab waveguide, as with the parallel-plate guide, we associate higher-
order modes with increasing values of κ1.6
In the regions above and below the slab, waves propagate according to wave-
vectors k2u and k2d as shown in Figure 13.20. Above the slab, for example (x > d/2),
the TE electric ﬁeld will be of the form
Ey2s = E02e−jk2·r = E02e−jκ2xe−jβz
(131)
However, κ2 = n2k0 cos θ2, where cos θ2, given in (123), is imaginary. We may
therefore write
κ2 = −jγ2

with the metal guides, we will obtain discrete values of these quantities. To keep notation simple, the m
subscript is suppressed, and we will assume it to be understood. Again, subscripts 1 and 2 in this section
indicate, respectively, the slab and surrounding regions, and have nothing to do with mode number.

The ﬁelds expressed in (134) and (135) are those of surface waves. Note that they
propagate in the z direction only, according to e−jβz, but simply reduce in amplitude
with increasing |x|, according to the e−γ2(x−d/2) term in (134) and the eγ2(x+d/2) term
in (135). These waves represent a certain fraction of the total power in the mode, and
so we see an important fundamental difference between dielectric waveguides and
metal waveguides: in the dielectric guide, the ﬁelds (and guided power) exist over
a cross section that extends beyond the conﬁning boundaries, and in principle they
exist over an inﬁnite cross section. In practical situations, the exponential decay of
the ﬁelds above and below the boundaries is typically sufﬁcient to render the ﬁelds
negligible within a few slab thicknesses from each boundary.
The total electric ﬁeld distribution is composed of the ﬁeld in all three regions
and is sketched in Figure 13.21 for the ﬁrst few modes. Within the slab, the ﬁeld
is oscillatory and is of a similar form to that of the parallel-plate waveguide. The
difference is that the ﬁelds in the slab waveguide do not reach zero at the boundaries
but connect to the evanescent ﬁelds above and below the slab. The restriction is that
the TE ﬁelds on either side of a boundary (being tangent to the interface) must match
at the boundary. Speciﬁcally,

Solution of the wave equation yields (as it must) results identical to these. The reader
is referred to References 2 and 3 for the details. The magnetic ﬁeld for the TE modes
will consist of x and z components, as was true for the parallel-plate guide. Finally,
the TM mode ﬁelds will be nearly the same in form as those of TE modes, but with
a simple rotation in polarization of the plane wave components by 90◦. Thus, in
TM modes, Hy will result, and it will have the same form as Ey for TE, as presented
in (137) and (138).
Apart from the differences in the ﬁeld structures, the dielectric slab waveguide
operates in a manner that is qualitatively similar to the parallel-plate guide. Again,
a ﬁnite number of discrete modes will be allowed at a given frequency, and this
number increases as frequency increases. Higher-order modes are characterized by
successively smaller values of θ1.
An important difference in the slab waveguide occurs at cutoff for any mode. We
know that θ = 0 at cutoff in the metal guides. In the dielectric guide at cutoff, the wave
angle, θ1, is equal to the critical angle, θc. Then, as the frequency of a given mode
is raised, its θ1 value increases beyond θc in order to maintain transverse resonance,
while maintaining the same number of ﬁeld oscillations in the transverse plane.
As wave angle increases, however, the character of the evanescent ﬁelds changes
signiﬁcantly. This can be understood by considering the wave angle dependence on
evanescent decay coefﬁcient, γ2, as given by (133). Note, in that equation, that as θ1
increases (as frequency goes up), γ2 also increases, leading to a more rapid falloff
of the ﬁelds with increasing distance above and below the slab. The mode therefore
becomes more tightly conﬁned to the slab as frequency is raised. Also, at a given
frequency, lower-order modes, having smaller wave angles, will have lower values
of γ2 as (133) indicates. Consequently, when considering several modes propagating
together at a single frequency, the higher-order modes will carry a greater percentage
of their power in the upper and lower regions surrounding the slab than will modes
of lower order.
One can determine the conditions under which modes will propagate by using the
transverse resonance condition, as we did with the parallel-plate guide. We perform
the transverse round trip analysis in the slab region in the same manner that was done
in Section 13.3, and obtain an equation similar to (37):
κ1d + φTE + κ1d + φTE = 2mπ
(139)

496
ENGINEERING ELECTROMAGNETICS
for TE waves and
κ1d + φTM + κ1d + φTM = 2mπ
(140)
for the TM case. Eqs. (139) and (140) are called the eigenvalue equations for the
symmetric dielectric slab waveguide. The phase shifts on reﬂection, φTE and φTM,
are the phases of the reﬂection coefﬁcients, s and p, given in (119) and (120). These
are readily found, but they turn out to be functions of θ1. As we know, κ1 also depends
on θ1, but in a different way than φTE and φTM. Consequently, (139) and (140) are
transcendental in θ1, and they cannot be solved in closed form. Instead, numerical or
graphical methods must be used (see References 4 or 5). Emerging from this solution
process, however, is a fairly simple cutoff condition for any TE or TM mode:

2 ≥(m −1)π
(m = 1, 2, 3, . . .)
(141)
For mode m to propagate, (141) must hold. The physical interpretation of the
mode number m is again the number of half-cycles of the electric ﬁeld (for TE modes)
or magnetic ﬁeld (for TM modes) that occur over the transverse dimension. The
lowest-order mode (m = 1) is seen to have no cutoff—it will propagate from zero
frequency on up. We will thus achieve single-mode operation (actually a single pair
of TE and TM modes) if we can assure that the m = 2 modes are below cutoff. Using
(141), our single-mode condition will thus be:

OPTICAL FIBER
Optical ﬁber works on the same principle as the dielectric slab waveguide, except
of course for the round cross section. A step index ﬁber is shown in Figure 13.10,
in which a high index core of radius a is surrounded by a lower-index cladding of
radius b. Light is conﬁned to the core through the mechanism of total reﬂection, but
again some fraction of the power resides in the cladding as well. As we found in the
slab waveguide, the cladding power again moves in toward the core as frequency is
raised. Additionally, as is true in the slab waveguide, the ﬁber supports a mode that has
no cutoff.
Analysis of the optical ﬁber is complicated. This is mainly because of the round
cross section, along with the fact that it is generally a three-dimensional problem; the
slab waveguide had only two dimensions to be concerned about. It is possible to ana-
lyze the ﬁber using rays within the core that reﬂect from the cladding boundary as light
progresses down the ﬁber. We did this with the slab waveguide and obtained results
fairly quickly. The method is difﬁcult in ﬁber, however, because ray paths are com-
plicated. There are two types of rays in the core: (1) those that pass through the ﬁber
axis (z axis), known as meridional rays, and (2) those that avoid the axis but progress
in a spiral-like path as they propagate down the guide. These are known as skew rays;
their analysis, although possible, is tedious. Fiber modes are developed that can be
associated with the individual ray types, or with combinations thereof, but it is easier
to obtain these by solving the wave equation directly. Our purpose in this section is to
provide a ﬁrst exposure to the optical ﬁber problem (and to avoid an excessively long
treatment). To accomplish this, we will solve the simplest case in the quickest way.
The simplest ﬁber conﬁguration is that of a step index, but with the core and
cladding indices of values that are very close, that is n1 .= n2. This is the weak-
quidance condition, whose simplifying effect on the analysis is signiﬁcant. We
already saw how core and cladding indices in the slab waveguide need to be very
close in value in order to achieve single-mode or few-mode operation. Fiber manu-
facturershavetakenthisresulttoheart,suchthattheweak-guidanceconditionisinfact
satisﬁed by most commercial ﬁbers today. Typical dimensions of a single-mode ﬁber
are between 5 and 10 µm for the core diameter, with the cladding diameter usually
125 µm. Refractive index differences between core and cladding are typically a small
fraction of a percent.

The main result of the weak-guidance condition is that a set of modes appears in
which each mode is linearly polarized. This means that light having x-polarization,
for example, will enter the ﬁber and establish itself in a mode or in a set of modes
that preserve the x-polarization. Magnetic ﬁeld is essentially orthogonal to E, and so
it would in that case lie in the y direction. The z components of both ﬁelds, although
present, are too weak to be of signiﬁcance; the nearly equal core and cladding indices
lead to ray paths that are essentially parallel to the guide axis—deviating only slightly.
In fact, we may write for a given mode, Ex .= ηHy, when η is approximated as the in-
trinsicimpedanceofthecladding.Therefore,intheweak-guidanceapproximation,the
ﬁber mode ﬁelds are treated as plane waves (nonuniform, of course). The designation
for these modes is LPℓm, meaning linearly polarized, with integer order parameters
ℓand m. The latter express the numbers of variations over the two dimensions in the
circular transverse plane. Speciﬁcally, ℓ, the azimuthal mode number, is one-half the
number of power density maxima (or minima) that occur at a given radius as φ varies
from 0 to 2π. The radial mode number, m, expresses the number of maxima that occur
along a radial line (at constant φ) that extends from zero to inﬁnity.
Although we may assume a linearly polarized ﬁeld in a rectangular coordinate
system, we are obliged to work in cylindrical coordinates for obvious reasons. In
a manner that reminds us of the rectangular waveguide, it is possible to write the
x-polarized phasor electric ﬁeld within a weakly guiding cylindrical ﬁber as a product
of three functions, each of which varies with one of the coordinate variables, ρ, φ,
and z:
Exs(ρ, φ, z) =

i
Ri(ρ)i(φ) exp(−jβiz)
(144)
Each term in the summation is an individual mode of the ﬁber. Note that the z function
is just the propagation term, e−jβz, since we are assuming an inﬁnitely long lossless
ﬁber.
The wave equation is Eq. (58), which we may write for the assumed x component
of Es, but in which the Laplacian operator is written in cylindrical coordinates:

(145)
where we recognize that the ∂2/∂z2 operation, when applied to (144), leads to a
factor of −β2. We now substitute a single term of (144) into (145) [since each term
in (144) should alone satisfy the wave equation]. Dropping the subscript i, expanding
the radial derivative, and rearranging terms, we obtain:

We note that the left-hand side of (146) varies only with ρ, whereas the right-hand side
varies only with φ. Since the two variables are independent, it must follow that each
side of the equation must be equal to a constant. Calling this constant ℓ2, as shown,

(147b)
The solution of (147a) is of the form of the sine or cosine of φ:
(φ) =
$ cos(ℓφ + α)
sin(ℓφ + α)
(148)
where α is a constant. The form of (148) dictates that ℓmust be an integer, since the
same mode ﬁeld must occur in the transverse plane as φ is changed by 2π radians.
Since the ﬁber is round, the orientation of the x and y axes in the transverse plane is
immaterial, so we may choose the cosine function and set α = 0. We will thus use
(φ) = cos(ℓφ).
The solution of (147b) to obtain the radial function is more complicated.
Eq. (147b) is a form of Bessel’s equation, whose solutions are Bessel functions
of various forms. The key parameter is the function βt = (k2 −β2)1/2, the square
of which appears in (147b). Note that βt will differ in the two regions: Within the
core (ρ < a), βt = βt1 = (n2
1k2
0 −β2)1/2; within the cladding (ρ > a), we have
βt = βt2 = (n2
2k2
0 −β2)1/2. Depending on the relative magnitudes of k and β, βt may
be real or imaginary. These possibilities lead to two solution forms of (147b):
R(ρ) =
$ AJℓ(βtρ)
βt real
BKℓ(|βt|ρ)
βt imaginary
(149)
where A and B areconstants. Jℓ(βtρ)istheordinaryBesselfunctionoftheﬁrstkind,of
order ℓand of argument βtρ. Kℓ(|βt|ρ) is the modiﬁed Bessel function of the second
kind, of order ℓ, and having argument |βt|ρ. The ﬁrst two orders of each of these
functions are illustrated in Figures 13.22a and b. In our study, it is necessary to know
the precise zero crossings of the J0 and J1 functions. Those shown in Figure 13.22a
are as follows: For J0, the zeros are 2.405, 5.520, 8.654, 11.792, and 14.931. For J1,
the zeros are 0, 3.832, 7.016, 10.173, and 13.324. Other Bessel function types would
contribute to the solutions in Eq. (149), but these exhibit nonphysical behavior with
radius and are not included.
We next need to determine which of the two solutions is appropriate for each
region. Within the core (ρ < a) we expect to get an oscillatory solution for the
ﬁeld—much in the same manner as we found in the slab waveguide. Therefore,
we assign the ordinary Bessel function solutions to that region by requiring that
βt1 = (n2
1k2
0 −β2)1/2 is real. In the cladding (ρ > a), we expect surface waves that
decrease in amplitude with increasing radius away from the core/cladding boundary.

The Bessel K functions provide this behavior and will apply if βt2 is imaginary.
Requiring this, we may therefore write |βt2| = (β2 −n2
2k2
0)1/2. The diminishing ﬁeld
amplitude with increasing radius within the cladding allows us to neglect the effect
of the outer cladding boundary (at ρ = b), as ﬁelds there are presumed too weak for
this boundary to have any effect on the mode ﬁeld.
Because βt1 and βt2 are in units of m−1, it is convenient to normalize these
quantities (while making them dimensionless) by multiplying both by the core radius,
a. Our new normalized parameters become

u and w are in direct analogy with the quantities κ1d and κ2d in the slab waveguide.
As in those parameters, β is the z component of both n1k0 and n2k0 and is the phase
constant of the guided mode. β must be the same in both regions so that the ﬁeld
boundary conditions will be satisﬁed at ρ = a for all z and t.
We may now construct the total solution for Exs for a single guided mode, using
(144) along with (148), (149), (150a), and (150b):
Exs =
$E0Jℓ(uρ/a) cos(ℓφ)e−jβz
ρ ≤a
E0[Jℓ(u)/Kℓ(w)]Kℓ(wρ/a) cos(ℓφ)e−jβz
ρ ≥a
(151)
Note that we have let the coefﬁcient A in (149) equal E0, and B = E0[Jℓ(u)/Kℓ(w)].
These choices assure that the expressions for Exs in the two regions become equal
at ρ = a, a condition approximately true as long as n1 .= n2 (the weak-guidance
approximation).
Again, the weak-guidance condition also allows the approximation H .= E/η,
with η taken as the intrinsic impedance of the cladding. Having Es and Hs enables us
to ﬁnd the LPℓm mode average power density (or light intensity) through

where I0 is the peak intensity value. The role of the azimuthal mode number ℓ, as
evident in (153a) and (153b), is to determine the number of intensity variations around
the circle, 0 < φ < 2π; it also determines the order of the Bessel functions that are
used. The inﬂuence of the radial mode number, m, is not immediately apparent in
(153a) and (153b). Brieﬂy stated, m determines the range of allowed values of u that
occur in the Bessel function, J(uρ/a). The greater the value of m, the greater the
allowed values of u; with larger u, the Bessel function goes through more oscillations
over the range 0 < ρ < a, and so more radial intensity variations occur with larger m.
In the slab waveguide, the mode number (also m) determines the allowed ranges of
κ1. As we saw in Section 13.6, increasing κ1 at a given frequency means that the slab
ray propagates closer to the normal (smaller θ1), and so more spatial oscillations of
the ﬁeld occur in the transverse direction (larger m).
The ﬁnal step in the analysis is to obtain an equation from which values of
mode parameters (u, w, and β, for example) can be determined for a given operating
frequency and ﬁber construction. In the slab waveguide, two equations, (139) and
(140), were found using transverse resonance arguments, and these were associated

502
ENGINEERING ELECTROMAGNETICS
with TE and TM waves in the slab. In our ﬁber, we do not apply transverse resonance
directly,butratherimplicitly,byrequiringthatallﬁeldssatisfytheboundaryconditions
at the core/cladding interface, ρ = a.7 We have already applied conditions on the
transverse ﬁelds to obtain Eq. (151). The remaining condition is continuity of the
z components of E and H. In the weak-guidance approximation, we have neglected
all z components, but we will consider them now for this last exercise. Using Faraday’s
law in point form, continuity of Hzs at ρ = a is the same as the continuity of the
z component of ∇× Es, provided that µ = µ0 (or is the same value) in both regions.
Speciﬁcally

(154)
The procedure begins by expressing the electric ﬁeld in (151) in terms of ρ and φ
components and then applying (154). This is a lengthy procedure and is left as an
exercise (or may be found in Reference 5). The result is the eigenvalue equation for
LP modes in the weakly guiding step index ﬁber:
Jℓ−1(u)
Jℓ(u)
= −w
u
Kℓ−1(w)
Kℓ(w)
(155)
This equation, like (139) and (140), is transcendental, and it must be solved for u and
w numerically or graphically. This exercise in all of its aspects is beyond the scope of
our treatment. Instead, we will obtain from (155) the conditions for cutoff for a given
mode and some properties of the most important mode—that which has no cutoff,
and which is therefore the mode that is present in single-mode ﬁber.
The solution of (155) is facilitated by noting that u and w can be combined to give
a new parameter that is independent of β and depends only on the ﬁber construction
and on the operating frequency. This new parameter, called the normalized frequency,
or V number, is found using (150a) and (150b):
V ≡

u2 + w2 = ak0

n2

(156)
We note that an increase in V is accomplished through an increase in core radius,
frequency, or index difference.
The cutoff condition for a given mode can now be found from (155) in conjunction
with (156). To do this, we note that cutoff in a dielectric guide means that total
reﬂectionatthecore/claddingboundaryjustceases,andpowerjustbeginstopropagate
radially, away from the core. The effect on the electric ﬁeld of Eq. (151) is to produce
a cladding ﬁeld that no longer diminishes with increasing radius. This occurs in the
modiﬁedBesselfunction, K(wρ/a),whenw = 0.Thisisourgeneralcutoffcondition,
7 Recall that the equations for reﬂection coefﬁcient (119) and (120), from which the phase shift on
reﬂection used in transverse resonance is determined, originally came from the application of the
ﬁeld boundary conditions.

CHAPTER 13

503
which we now apply to (155), whose right-hand side becomes zero when w = 0. This
leads to cutoff values of u and V (uc and Vc), and, by (156), uc = Vc. Eq. (155) at
cutoff now becomes:
Jℓ−1(Vc) = 0
(157)
Finding the cutoff condition for a given mode is now a matter of ﬁnding the appro-
priate zero of the relevant ordinary Bessel function, as determined by (157). This
gives the value of V at cutoff for that mode.
For example, the lowest-order mode is the simplest in structure; therefore it has no
variations in φ and one variation (one maximum) in ρ. The designation for this mode
is therefore LP01, and with ℓ= 0, (157) gives the cutoff condition as J−1(Vc) = 0.
Because J−1 = J1 (true only for the J1 Bessel function), we take the ﬁrst zero of J1,
which is Vc(01) = 0. The LP01 mode therefore has no cutoff and will propagate at the
exclusion of all other modes provided V for the ﬁber is greater than zero but less than
Vc for the next-higher-order mode. By inspecting Figure 13.22a, we see that the next
Bessel function zero is 2.405 (for the J0 function). Therefore, ℓ−1 = 0 in (156), and
so ℓ= 1 for the next-higher-order mode. Also, we use the lowest value of mℓ(m = 1),
and the mode is therefore identiﬁed as LP11. Its cutoff V is Vc(11) = 2.405. If m = 2
were to be chosen instead, we would obtain the cutoff V number for the LP12 mode.
We use the next zero of the J0 function, which is 5.520, or Vc(12) = 5.520. In this
way, the radial mode number, m, numbers the zeros of the Bessel function of order
ℓ−1, taken in order of increasing value.
When we follow the reasoning just described, the condition for single-mode
operation in a step index ﬁber is found to be
V < Vc(11) = 2.405
(158)
Then, using (156) along with k0 = 2π/λ, we ﬁnd

as the requirement on free-space wavelength to achieve single-mode operation in a
step index ﬁber. The similarity to the single-mode condition in the slab waveguide
[Eq. (143)] is apparent. The cutoff wavelength, λc, is that for the LP11 mode. Its value
is quoted as a speciﬁcation of most commercial single-mode ﬁber.
EXAMPLE 13.6
The cutoff wavelength of a step index ﬁber is quoted as λc = 1.20 µm. If the ﬁber is

The two intensities for a single V value are plotted as functions of radius at φ = 0 in
Figure 13.23. We again note the lower conﬁnement of the higher-order mode to the
core, as was true in the slab waveguide.
As V increases (accomplished by increasing the frequency, for example), existing
modes become more tightly conﬁned to the core, while new modes of higher order
may begin to propagate. The behavior of the lowest-order mode with changing V is
depicted in Figure 13.24, where we again note that the mode becomes more tightly
conﬁned as V increases. In determining the intensities, Eq. (155) must in general be
solved numerically to obtain u and w. Various analytic approximations to the exact
numerical solution exist, the best of which is the Rudolf-Neumann formula for the
LP01 mode, valid over the range 1.3 < V < 3.5:
w01 .= 1.1428V −0.9960
(162)
Having w01, u01 can be found from (156), knowing V .
Another important simpliﬁcation for the LP01 mode is the approximation of its
intensity proﬁle by a Gaussian function. An inspection of any of the intensity plots
of Figure 13.24 shows a resemblence to a Gaussian, which would be expressed as
I01 ≈I0e−2ρ2/ρ2
0
(163)
where ρ0, termed the mode ﬁeld radius, is deﬁned as the radius from the ﬁber axis
at which the mode intensity falls to 1/e2 times its on-axis value. This radius depends
on frequency, and most generally on V. A similar approximation can be made for the
fundamental symmetric slab waveguide mode intensity. In step index ﬁber, the best ﬁt
between the Gaussian approximation and the actual mode intensity as given in (160)
is given by the Marcuse formula:
ρ0

index fiber, as functions of normalized radius, ρ/a. Both
functions were evaluated at the same operating
frequency; the relatively weak confinement of the LP11
mode compared to that of LP01 is evident.
The mode ﬁeld radius (at a quoted wavelength) is another important speciﬁ-
cation (along with the cutoff wavelength) of commercial single-mode ﬁber. It is
important to know for several reasons: First, in splicing or connecting two single-
mode ﬁbers together, the lowest connection loss will be attained if both ﬁbers have
the same mode ﬁeld radius, and if the ﬁber axes are precisely aligned. Different
radii or displaced axes result in increased loss, but this can be calculated and com-
pared with measurement. Alignment tolerance (allowable deviation from precise axis
alignment) is relaxed somewhat if the ﬁbers have larger mode ﬁeld radii. Second,
a smaller mode ﬁeld radius means that the ﬁber is less likely to suffer loss as a
result of bending. A loosely conﬁned mode tends to radiate away more as the ﬁber
is bent. Finally, mode ﬁeld radius is directly related to the mode phase constant, β,
since if u and w are known (found from ρ0), β can be found from (150a) or (150b).
Therefore, knowledge of how β changes with frequency (leading to the quantiﬁ-
cation of dispersion) can be found by measuring the change in mode ﬁeld radius
with frequency. Again, References 4 and 5 (and references therein) provide more
detail.

e are used to the idea that loss mechanisms in electrical devices, including
transmission lines and waveguides, are associated with resistive effects
in which electrical power is transformed into heat. We have also assumed
that time-varying electric and magnetic ﬁelds are totally conﬁned to a waveguide
or circuit. In fact, conﬁnement is rarely complete, and electromagnetic power will
radiate away from the device to some degree. Radiation may generally be an unwanted
effect, as it represents an additional power loss mechanism, or a device may receive
unwanted signals from the surrounding region. On the other hand, a well-designed
antenna provides an efﬁcient interface between guided waves and free-space waves
for purposes of intentionally radiating or receiving electromagnetic power. In either
case, it is important to understand the radiation phenomenon so that it can either be
used most effectively or be reduced to a minimum. In this chapter, our goal is to
establish such an understanding and to explore several practical examples of antenna
design.■
14.1
BASIC RADIATION PRINCIPLES: THE
HERTZIAN DIPOLE
The essential point of this chapter is that any time-varying current distribution will
radiate electromagnetic power. So our ﬁrst task is to ﬁnd the ﬁelds that radiate from a
speciﬁctime-varyingsource.Thisproblemisdifferentfromanythatwehaveexplored.
In our treatment of waves and ﬁelds in bulk media and in waveguides, only the
wave motion in the medium was investigated, and the sources of the ﬁelds were not
considered. Earlier in Chapter 11, we found the current distribution in a conductor
by relating it to assumed electric and magnetic ﬁeld intensities at the conductor

surface. Although this would relate the current source to the ﬁeld, it is not practical
for our purposes because the conductors were considered inﬁnite in size in at least
one dimension.
We begin by studying a current ﬁlament of inﬁnitesimally small cross-section,
positioned within an inﬁnite lossless medium that is speciﬁed by permeability µ and
permittivity ϵ (both real). The ﬁlament is speciﬁed as having a differential length, but
we will later extend the results easily to larger dimensions that are on the order of
a wavelength. The ﬁlament is positioned with its center at the origin and is oriented
along the z axis as shown in Figure 14.1. The positive sense of the current is taken in
the az direction. A uniform current I(t) = I0 cos ωt is assumed to ﬂow in this short
length d. The existence of such a current would imply the existence of time-varying
charges of equal and opposite instantaneous amplitude on each end of the wire. For
this reason, the wire is termed an elemental or Hertzian dipole. This is distinct in
meaning from the more general deﬁnition of a dipole antenna that we will use later
in this chapter.
The ﬁrst step is the application of the retarded vector magnetic potential expres-
sion, as presented in Section 9.5,
A =
 µ I[t −R/v] dL
4π R
(1)
where I is a function of the retarded time t −R/v.
When a single frequency is used to drive the antenna, v is the phase velocity of
a wave at that frequency in the medium around the current element, and is given by

CHAPTER 14

v = 1/√µϵ. Since no integration is required for the short ﬁlament, we have
A = µ I[t −R/v] d
4π R
az
(2)
Only the z component of A is present, for the current is only in the az direction. At
any point P at distance R from the origin, the vector potential is retarded by R/v and
so we use
I[t −R/v] = I0 cos

(3)
where the wavenumber in the lossless medium is k = ω/v = ω√µϵ. In phasor form,
Eq. (3) becomes
Is = I0 e−jkR
(4)
where the current amplitude, I0, is assumed to be real (as it will be throughout this
chapter). Incorporating (4) into (2), we ﬁnd the phasor retarded potential:
As = Azs az = µI0d
4π R e−jkR az
(5)
Using a mixed coordinate system for the moment, we now replace R by the small r
of the spherical coordinate system and then determine which spherical components
are represented by Azs. Using the projections as illustrated in Figure 14.2, we ﬁnd
Ars = Azs cos θ
(6a)
Aθs = −Azs sin θ
(6b)
and therefore
Ars = µI0d

From these two components of the vector magnetic potential at P we can now
ﬁnd Bs or Hs from the deﬁnition of As,
Bs = µHs = ∇× As
(8)
Taking the indicated partial derivatives as speciﬁed by the curl operator in spherical
coordinates, we are able to separate Eq. (8) into its three spherical components, of
which only the φ component is non-zero:
Hφs = 1

(10)
The electric ﬁeld that is associated with Eq. (10) is found from one of Maxwell’s
equations—speciﬁcally the point form of Ampere’s circuital law as applied to the
surrounding region (where conduction and convection current are absent). In phasor
form, this is Eq. (23) in Chapter 11, except that in the present case we allow for a
lossless medium having permittivity ϵ:
∇× Hs = jωϵEs
(11)
Using (11), we expand the curl in spherical coordinates, assuming the existence of
only a φ component for Hs. The resulting electric ﬁeld components are:

Equations (10), (13a), and (13b) are the ﬁelds that we set out to ﬁnd. The next step
is to interpret them. We ﬁrst notice the e−jkr factor appearing with each component.
By itself, this term describes a spherical wave, propagating outward from the origin
in the positive r direction with a phase constant k = 2π/λ. λ is the wavelength as

In (17) and (18), the principal value is always taken when evaluating the inverse

the range ±π/2 as kr varies between zero and inﬁnity. Suppose a single frequency
(k value) is chosen, and the ﬁelds are observed at a ﬁxed instant in time. Consider
observing the ﬁeld along a path in the direction of increasing r, in which spatial
oscillations will be seen as r varies. As a result of the phase terms in (17) and (18),
the oscillation period will change with increasing r. We may demonstrate this by
considering the Hφ component as a function of r under the following conditions:

A few important points emerge when studying Eq. (21). First, at distances r that
are on the order of a wavelength, the expression consists of two sinusoidal functions
having the same period but in which the amplitude of the second one increases with
increasing r. This leads to signiﬁcant nonsinusoidal behavior, in that the ﬁeld as a
function of r/λ will oscillate, but with nonuniform periodicity, and with positive and
negative amplitudes that differ in each cycle. Second, at distances r that are much
greater than a wavelength, the second term in (21) dominates, and the ﬁeld variation
with r approaches that of a pure sinusoid. We may therefore say that, for all practical
purposes, the wave at large distances, wherer >> λ, is a uniform plane wave having a
sinusoidal variation with distance (and time, of course) and a well-deﬁned wavelength.
This wave evidently carries power away from the differential antenna.
We should now take a more careful look at the expressions containing terms
varying as 1/r3, 1/r2, and 1/r in Eqs. (10), (13a), and (13b). At points very close
to the current element, the 1/r3 term must be dominant. In the numerical example
we have used, the relative values of the terms in 1/r3, 1/r2, and 1/r in the Eθs
expression are about 250, 16, and 1, respectively, when r is 1 cm. The variation
of an electric ﬁeld as 1/r3 should remind us of the electrostatic ﬁeld of the dipole
(Chapter 4). The development of this concept is the subject of Problem 14.4. The
near-ﬁeld terms represent energy stored in a reactive (capacitive) ﬁeld, and they do
not contribute to the radiated power. The inverse-square term in the Hφs expression
is similarly important only in the region very near to the current element. It corre-
sponds to the induction ﬁeld of the dc element, as found through the Biot-Savart law
(Problem 14.5).
At distances corresponding to, say, 10 or more wavelengths from the current
element, the product kr = 2πr/λ > 20π, and the ﬁelds dramatically simplify.
In Eqs. (14)–(16), the terms within brackets involving 1/(kr)2 and 1/(kr)4 can be
considered much less than unity, and can be neglected. In addition, the phases (Eqs.
(17) and (18)) all approach π/2. The effect is also seen in Eqs. (10), (13a), and (13b),
in which all terms except the inverse-distance (1/r) term may be neglected. At such
distances, at which kr >> 1 (equivalently r >> λ), we are said to be in the far-ﬁeld
or far-zone. The remaining ﬁeld terms that have the 1/r dependence are the radiation
ﬁelds. This produces an approximately zero Ers ﬁeld, leaving only Eθs and Hφs. Thus,
in the far zone:
Ers .= 0
Eθs = j I0kd

Hφs = j I0kd

E-plane pattern of a vertical current
element. The crest amplitude of Eθs is
plotted as a function of the polar angle
θ at a constant distance r . The locus is
a circle.
The relation between these ﬁelds is evidently the same as that of a uniform plane wave,
which an expanding spherical wave approximates at large radii, and over regions in
which 1/r is approximately constant. Speciﬁcally,
Eθs = ηHφs
(kr >> 1 or r >> λ)
(24)
The variation of both radiation ﬁelds with the polar angle θ is the same; the ﬁelds
maximize in the equatorial plane (xy plane) of the current element and vanish off the
ends of the element. The variation with angle may be shown by plotting a vertical, or
E-plane pattern (assuming a vertical orientation of the current element). The E plane is
simply the coordinate plane that contains the electric ﬁeld, which in our present case,
is any surface of constant φ in the spherical coordinate system. Figure 14.3 shows
an E-plane plot of Eq. (22) in polar coordinates, in which the relative magnitude of
Eθs is plotted against θ for a constant r. The length of the vector shown in the ﬁgure
represents the magnitude of Eθ, normalized to unity at θ = 90◦; the vector length is
just | sin θ|, and so as θ varies, the tip of the vector traces out a circle as shown.
A horizontal, or H-plane pattern may also be plotted for this or more complicated
antenna systems. In the present case, this would show the variation of ﬁeld intensity
with φ. The H-plane of the current element (the plane that contains the magnetic ﬁeld)
is any plane that is normal to the z axis. As Eθ is not a function of φ, the H-plane
plot would be simply a circle centered at the origin.

It is important to fully describe and quantify the radiation from a general antenna. To
do this, we need to be aware of a few new concepts and deﬁnitions.
In order to evaluate the radiated power, the time-average Poynting vector must

If, for example, the differential length is 0.01λ, then Rrad is about 0.08 
. This
small resistance is probably comparable to the ohmic resistance of a practical antenna
(providing a measure of the power dissipated through heat), and thus the efﬁciency
of the antenna is likely to be too low. Effective matching to the source also becomes
very difﬁcult to achieve, for the input reactance of an electrically short antenna is
much greater in magnitude than the input resistance Rrad.
Evaluating the net power from the antenna, as carried out in (27), involved the
integration of the Poynting vector over a spherical shell of presumed large radius,
such that the antenna appeared as a point source at the sphere center. In view of this,

a new concept of power density can be introduced; this involves the power that is
carried within a very thin cone with its vertex at the antenna location. The axis of the
cone extends along a line of radius, and thus the cone intersects the spherical surface
over which the integral in (27) is taken. That portion of the sphere area that the cone
intersects will have area A. We deﬁne the solid angle of the cone in the following
manner: If A = r2, where r is the sphere radius, then the cone is deﬁned as having a
solid angle, 
, equal to one steradian (sr).1 As the total sphere area is 4πr2, we see
that the total solid angle contained within a sphere is 4π steradians.
As a consequence of this deﬁnition, differential area on the sphere surface can
be expressed in terms of a differential solid angle through:
d A = r2 d
(31)
The total sphere area can then be expressed as an integral over solid angle, or equiv-
alently by an integral using spherical coordinates:

We can now express the Poynting vector magnitude as found in Eq. (26) in units
of power per unit solid angle. To do this, we multiply the Watts/m2 power density
in (26) by the sphere area encompassed in one steradian—which is r2. The result,
known as the radiation intensity, is
K(θ, φ) = r2Sr
W/Sr

which, for the Hertzian dipole, gives the same result as found in (28).
The advantage of using the radiation intensity for power density is that this quan-
tity is independent of the radius. This is true, however, only if the original power
density exhibits a 1/r2 dependence. In fact, all antennas have this functional depen-
dence on radius in the far zone, in that when far enough away, the antenna appears as a
point source of power. Assuming the surrounding medium does not absorb any power,
the integral of the Poynting vector over a closed sphere of any radius must give the
same result. This fact demands an inverse-square dependence on radius for the power
density. With the radial dependence removed, one can concentrate on the angular
dependence of the power density as expressed by K, and this will differ signiﬁcantly
among different antennas.
A special case of a power source is an isotropic radiator, deﬁned as having a
constant radiation intensity (i.e., K = Kiso is independent of θ and φ). This gives a
simple relation between K and the total radiated power:
Pr =
 4π
0
Kiso d
 = 4π Kiso
⇒
Kiso = Pr/4π
(isotropic radiator)
(37)
Generally, K will vary with angle, giving more intensity in some directions than
in others. It is useful to compare the radiation intensity in a given direction to that

which would occur if the antenna were to radiate the same net power isotropically.
The directivity function, D(θ, φ), does this.2 Using (36) and (37), we can write the
directivity:

Pr/4π = 4π K(θ, φ)

Of particular interest in most cases is the maximum value of the directivity, Dmax,
which is sometimes called simply D (without the θ and φ dependence indicated):
D = Dmax = 4π Kmax

in which the maximum radiation intensity, Kmax, will usually occur at more than one
set of values of θ and φ. Typically, the directivity is quoted in decibels, according to

Ans. 3; 4.77; 10 log10(n + 1)
Usually, one would like to have a much higher directivity than what we just
found for the Hertzian dipole. One implication of a low directivity (and a problem
2 In earlier times (and in older texts), the directivity function was called the directive gain. The latter
term has since been discarded by the Antenna Standards Committee of the IEEE Antennas and
Propagation Society, in favor of the term “directivity.” Details are found in IEEE Std 145-1993.

with the short antenna) is that power is radiated over a broad angular range in the
E plane. In most cases, it is desired to conﬁne the power to a narrow range, or
small beamwidth, thus increasing the directivity. The 3-dB beamwidth is deﬁned
as the separation between the two angles at which the directivity falls to one-half
its maximum value. For the Hertzian dipole, and using the D(θ, φ) result from the
previous example, the beamwidth will be the span between the two θ values on either
side of 90◦at which sin2 θ = 1/2, or | sin θ| = 1/
√
2 = 0.707. These two values
are 45◦and 135◦, representing a 3-dB beamwidth of 135◦−45◦= 90◦. We will
see that using a longer antenna leads to both a narrower beamwidth and an increased
radiation resistance. In the H plane, radiation is uniform at all values of φ, no matter
what length is used. It is necessary to use multiple antennas in an array in order to
narrow the beam in the H-plane.
We have based several deﬁnitions on the total average power that is radiated by
the antenna, Pr. It is desirable, however, to distinguish the radiated power from the
input power that is supplied to the antenna, Pin. It is likely that Pin will be somewhat
greater than Pr because of resistive losses in the conducting materials that make up
the antenna. To overcome this resistance, a greater input voltage amplitude would be
necessary to generate a given current amplitude, I0, on which all of our power compu-
tations have been based. The antenna gain is deﬁned in such a way to accommodate
this difference.3
Speciﬁcally, suppose that the antenna in question were to isotropically radiate
all of the electrical power that is supplied to it, which is Pin. The radiation intensity
would simply be Ks = Pin/4π. Gain is deﬁned as the ratio of the actual radiation
intensity in a speciﬁed direction, to Ks:
G(θ, φ) = K(θ, φ)
Ks
= 4π K(θ, φ)
Pin
(41)
Note that the term 4π K(θ, φ) would be the radiated power of an isotropic antenna
whose (in that case, constant) radiation intensity is K(θ, φ). The gain thus expresses
the ratio of the radiated power of an antenna to the input power as if the antenna were
to radiate isotropically with constant K as evaluated at a selected θ and φ. Using
(38), we can relate directivity to gain:
D(θ, φ) = 4π K(θ, φ)
Pr

Pr
G(θ, φ) = 1
ηr
G(θ, φ)
(42)
where ηr is the radiation efﬁciency of the antenna, deﬁned as the ratio of the radiated
power to the input power. Other ways of writing this are:
ηr = Pr
Pin
= G(θ, φ)
D(θ, φ) = Gmax
Dmax
(43)
which expresses ηr as the maximum gain divided by the maximum directivity.
3 The antenna gain deﬁned in this way is sometimes called the power gain.

14.3
MAGNETIC DIPOLE
An interesting device that is closely related to the Hertzian dipole is the magnetic
dipole antenna. Shown in Figure 14.5, the antenna consists of a circular current loop
of radius a, centered at the origin, and in the xy plane. The loop current is sinusoidal
and is given by I(t) = I0 cos ωt, as was the case in the Hertzian dipole. Although it is
possible to work out the ﬁelds for this antenna, beginning with the retarded potentials
as in the previous section, there is a much faster way.
We ﬁrst note that the circulating current implies the existence of a circulating
electric ﬁeld that overlaps the wire and that has the same time dependence. So one
could simply replace the wire by a circular electric ﬁeld that we could designate as
E(a, t) = E0(a) cos(ωt) aφ. Such a change would replace conduction current with
displacement current, which will have no effect on the surrounding ﬁeld solutions for
E and H. Next, suppose that we could replace the electric ﬁeld by a magnetic ﬁeld,
again of the form H(a, t) = H0 cos(ωt) aφ. This is the magnetic ﬁeld that would be
generated by the Hertzian dipole at radius a in the xy plane, and it enables us to obtain
the solution for the current loop ﬁeld through the following method:
We begin with Maxwell’s equations in a sourceless medium (ρv = J = 0):
∇× H = ϵ ∂E
∂t

Magnetic (left) and electric dipole antennas are dual structures, producing identical
field patterns but with the roles of E and H interchanged.

524
ENGINEERING ELECTROMAGNETICS
By inspection, we see that the equations would be unchanged if we replace E with H,
H with −E, ϵ with µ, and µ with ϵ. This illustrates the concept of duality in electro-
magnetics. The fact that the current loop electric ﬁeld will have the same functional
form as the electric dipole magnetic ﬁeld means that with the above substitutions,
we can construct the current loop ﬁelds directly from the electric dipole results. It
is because of this duality between ﬁeld solutions of the two devices that the name,
magnetic dipole antenna, is applied to the current loop device.
Before making the substitutions, we must relate the currents and geometries of
the two devices. To do this, consider ﬁrst the static electric dipole result of Chapter 4
(Eq. (35)). We can specialize this result by ﬁnding the electric ﬁeld on the z axis
(θ = 0). We ﬁnd
E|θ=0 =
Qd
2πϵz3 az
(45)
We can next study the current loop magnetic ﬁeld as found on the z axis, in which a
steady current I0 is present. This result can be obtained using the Biot–Savart Law:
H|θ=0 = πa2I0
2πz3 az
(46)
Now the current associated with a harmonically time-varying charge on the electric
dipole, Q(t), is
I0 = dQ
dt = jωQ
⇒
Q = I0
jω
(47)
If we substitute Eq. (47) into Eq. (45), and replace d with jωϵ(πa2), we ﬁnd that
Eq. (45) is transformed to Eq. (46). We now perform these substitutions, along with
the replacements, H for E, −E for H, ϵ for µ, and µ for ϵ, on Eqs. (14), (15), and
(16). The results are

Eφs and Hθs survive, and these simplify to compare closely with (22) and (23). This
process of exploiting duality in electromagnetics is a very powerful method that can
be applied in many situations.

14.4
THIN WIRE ANTENNAS
In addition to giving insights on radiation fundamentals, the Hertzian dipole results
provide us with a basis from which the ﬁelds associated with more complicated
antennas can be derived. In this section this methodology is applied to the more
practical problem of straight thin wire antennas of any length. We will ﬁnd that for
a given wavelength, changes in antenna length lead to dramatic variations in (and
control of) the radiation pattern. We will also note improvement in directivity and
efﬁciency when using certain antenna lengths.
The basic arrangement is shown in Figure 14.6. In a simplistic way, it is possible
to think of the antenna as having been formed by bending the two wires of an open-
ended transmission line down and up by 90◦. The midpoint, at which the bends
occur, is known as the feed point. The current, originally present, persists and is
instantaneously ﬂowing in the same direction in the lower and upper sections of the
antenna. If the current is sinusoidal, a standing wave is set up in the antenna wires,
with zeros occurring at the wire ends at z = ±ℓ. A symmetric antenna of this type is
called a dipole.
The actual current distribution on a very thin wire antenna is very nearly sinu-
soidal. With zero current at the ends, maxima occur one-quarter wavelength from
each end, and the current continues to vary in this manner toward the feed point. The
current at the feed will be small for an antenna whose overall length, 2ℓ, is an integral
number of wavelengths; but it will be equal to the maximum found at any point on
the antenna if the antenna length is an odd multiple of a half wavelength.
Figure 14.6
A thin dipole antenna driven
sinusoidally by a two-wire line. The current
amplitude distribution, shown in the adjacent
plot, is approximately linear if the overall length is
sufficiently less than a half-wavelength. Current
amplitude maximizes at the center (feed) point.

526
ENGINEERING ELECTROMAGNETICS
On a short antenna, where 2ℓis signiﬁcantly less than a half-wavelength, we see
only the ﬁrst portion of the sine wave; the amplitude of the current increases in an
approximately linear manner, from zero at the ends to a maximum value at the feed, as
indicated in Figure 14.6. The gap at the feed point is small and has negligible effects.
The short antenna approximation (in which a linear current variation along the length
can be assumed) is reasonable for antennas having an overall length that is less than
about one-tenth of a wavelength.
A simple extension of the Hertzian dipole results can be performed in the short
antenna regime (ℓ< λ/20). If this is the case, then retardation effects may be ne-
glected. That is, signals arriving at any ﬁeld point P from the two ends of the antenna
are approximately in phase. The average current along the antenna is I0/2, where
I0 is the input current at the feed. The electric and magnetic ﬁeld intensities will
thus be one-half the values given in (22) and (23), and there are no changes in the
vertical and horizontal patterns. The power will be one-quarter of its previous value,
and thus the radiation resistance will also be one-quarter of the value given by (30).
Matters improve as the antenna length is increased, but retardation effects must then
be included.
For longer lengths, the current distribution is treated the same as that of an open-
ended transmission line that propagates a TEM wave. This will be a standing wave
in which the current phasor is given by
Is(z) .= I0 sin(kz)
(51)
where the open end is located at z = 0. Also, for a TEM wave on a transmission line,
the phase constant will be β = k = ω√µϵ. When the line is unfolded to form the
antenna, the z axis is rotated to the vertical orientation with z = 0 occurring at the
feed point. The current in (51) is then modiﬁed to be
Is(z) .=
 I0 sin k(ℓ−z)
(z > 0)
I0 sin k(ℓ+ z)
(z < 0)
	
= I0 sin k(ℓ−|z|)
(52)
The strategy from here is to consider the antenna as made up of a stack of
Hertzian dipoles, each having length dz (Figure 14.7). The current amplitude in each
Hertzian is determined according to its position z along the length, and is given by
(52). The far-zone ﬁeld from each Hertzian can then be written using Eq. (22), suitably
modiﬁed. We write this as a differential ﬁeld contribution at a far point at distance r′
and spherical coordinate angle, θ′:
dEθs = j Is(z) k dz
4πr′
η sin θ′ e−jkr′
(53)
The coordinates r′ and θ′ are, of course, referenced from the center of the
Hertzian, which itself is at a position z along the antenna length. We need to ref-
erence these local coordinates to the origin, which occurs at the antenna feed point.
To do this, we borrow from the methods used to analyze the static electric dipole
as presented in Sec. 4.7. Referring to Fig. 14.7, we can write the relation between

the observation point, P, lies in the far zone, distance lines r and r ′
are approximately parallel, so they differ in length by z cos θ.

the same point as
r′ .= r −z cos θ
(54)
where, in the far ﬁeld, θ′ .= θ, and distance lines r′ and r are approximately parallel.
Eq. (53) is then modiﬁed to read
dEθs = j Is(z) k dz
4πr
η sin θ e−jk(r−z cos θ)
(55)
Notice that in obtaining (55) from (53) we have approximated r′ .= r in the denom-
inator, as the use of Eq. (54) will make little difference when considering amplitude
variations with z and θ. The exponential term in (55) does include (54) because slight
variations in z or θ will greatly impact the phase.
Now, the total electric ﬁeld at the far-zone position (r, θ) will be the sum of all the
Hertzian dipole contributions along the antenna length, which becomes the integral:

This important function, when normalized, is the E-plane pattern of the dipole an-
tenna. It explicitly shows how choices in dipole length affect the θ dependence in
the pattern, and it ultimately determines the dependence on ℓof the directive gain,
directivity, and radiated power for a given current.
Plots of the magnitude of F(θ) in the E-plane are shown in Figure 14.8a and b for
selected dipole lengths. In these, the xz plane is chosen, although the results will be
the same in any plane that contains the z axis. The plots show a trend toward narrower
radiation beams as length increases, but to the point at which secondary maxima,
or sidelobes, develop for overall antenna lengths (2ℓ) that exceed one wavelength.

antennas having overall lengths, 2ℓ, of (a) λ/16 (solid black), λ/2 (dashed), and λ (red), and (b)
1.3λ (dashed), and 2λ (red). In (a), the beam-narrowing trend is evident as length increases (or
as wavelength decreases). Note that the λ/16 curves are nearly circular and thus approximate
the Hertzian dipole pattern. At lengths that exceed one wavelength, sidelobes begin to develop,
as exhibited in the smaller beams in the 1.3λ pattern in (b). As length increases, the sidelobes
grow to form the four symmetrically arranged main lobes of the 2λ antenna, where the lobe in
the first quadrant maximizes at θ = 57.5◦. The main lobes along x that were present in the 1.3λ
antenna diminish with increasing length, and have vanished completely when the length
reaches 2λ.
The presence of sidelobes is usually not wanted, mainly because they represent ra-
diated power in directions other than that of the main beam (θ = π/2). Sidelobe
power will therefore likely miss the intended receiver. In addition, the sidelobe di-
rections change with wavelength, and will therefore impart an angular spread to
a radiated signal, to an extent which will of course increase with increasing signal
bandwidth. These problems are avoided by using antenna lengths that are less than one
wavelength.

Numerically, it is found that the two angles on either side of the maximum at θ = 90◦
that satisfy the above equation are θ1/2 = 51◦and 129◦. The half-power beamwidth
is thus 129◦−51◦= 78◦.
Directivity and radiation resistance are then found using (64) and (65), in which the
integral of [F(θ)]2 can be performed numerically. The results are Dmax = 1.64 (or
2.15 dB), and Rrad = 73 ohms.

ELECTROMAGNETIC RADIATION AND ANTENNAS

In the half-wave dipole, the standing wave current amplitude maximizes at the
feed point, and the antenna is said to be operated on resonance. As a result, the driving
point impedance, one-quarter wavelength in front of the open ends, would in principle
be purely real 4 and equal to the 73-
 radiation resistance, assuming that the antenna
is otherwise lossless. This is the primary motivation for using half-wave dipoles, in
that they provide a fairly close impedance match to conventional transmission lines
(whose characteristic impedances are on the same order).
Actually, because the antenna is essentially an unfolded transmission line, the
half-wave dipole does not behave as an ideal quarter-wave transmission line section, as
we might suspect considering the discussions in Section 14.1. An appreciable reactive
part of the input impedance will likely be present, but the half-wavelength dimension
is very close to the length at which the reactance goes to zero. Methods of evaluating
the reactance are beyond the scope of our treatment, but are considered in detail in
Ref. 1. For a thin lossless dipole of length exactly λ/2, the input impedance would be
Zin = 73 + j X, where X is in the vicinity of 40 
. The input reactance is extremely
sensitive to the antenna length and can be reduced to zero by a very slight reduction
in the overall length below λ/2, leaving the real part essentially unaffected. Similar
behavior is seen in dipoles having lengths that are integer multiples of λ/2, but in
these, radiation resistances are considerably higher, thus yielding a poorer impedance
match. At dipole lengths between half-wavelength multiples, input reactances can
be much higher (in the vicinity of j600 
) and can become sensitive to the wire
thickness, in addition to the length. In practice, when connecting a transmission line
feed, the input reactance can be zeroed by length reduction or by using matching
techniques such as those discussed in Chapter 10.
Plots of directivity and radiation resistance as functions of antenna length are
shown in Figure 14.9. Directivity increases modestly with length, whereas radiation
resistancereachesalocalmaximumatalengthbetween3λ/4andλ.Atgreaterlengths,
additional peaks in Rrad occur at higher levels, but performance is compromised by
the presence of sidelobes. Again, half-wave dipoles are typically used because single-
lobe behavior is assured over a broad spectral bandwidth, whereas radiation resistance
(73 
) is close to the impedance of standard transmission lines that are used to feed
the antenna.
As a ﬁnal exercise in wire antennas, we consider the operation of a monopole
antenna. This is one-half a dipole plus a perfectly conducting plane, as shown in Figure
14.10a. The image principle discussed in Section 5.5 provides the image shown in
Figure 14.10b, so that the monopole and its image form a dipole. Therefore, all ﬁeld
equationsthatpertaintothedipoleapplydirectlytotheupperhalf-space.ThePoynting
vector is therefore also the same above the plane, but the integration to ﬁnd the total
power radiated is performed only through the hemisphere that surrounds the upper
half-space. So the radiated power and the radiation resistance for the monopole are
half the corresponding values for the dipole. As an example, a quarter-wave monopole
4Think of a half-rotation (λ/4) around the Smith chart from the open circuit point, toward the
generator, where, with loss present, the end position would be somewhere on the negative real axis.

Monopole antennas may be driven by a coaxial cable below the plane, having

outer conductor connected to the plane. If the region below the plane is inaccessible
or inconvenient, the coax may be laid on top of the plane and its outer conductor
connected to it. Examples of this type of antenna include AM broadcasting towers
and citizens’ band antennas.

ARRAYS OF TWO ELEMENTS
We next address the problem of establishing better control of the directional prop-
erties of antenna radiation. Although some control of directivity is achieved through
adjustment of the length of a wire antenna, these results only appear as changes in
the E-plane pattern. The H-plane pattern always remains a circle (no φ variation), as
long as a single vertical wire antenna is used. By using multiple elements in an array,
signiﬁcant improvement in directivity as determined in both E and H planes can be
achieved. Our objective in this section is to lay the groundwork for the analysis of
arrays by considering the simple case of using two elements. The resulting methods
are readily extendable to multiple element conﬁgurations.
The basic conﬁguration is shown in Figure 14.11. Here, we have our original wire
antenna with its feed at the origin, and oriented along the z axis. A second identical
antenna, parallel to the ﬁrst, is positioned at location d on the x axis. The two carry
the same current amplitude, I0 (leading to far-ﬁeld amplitude E0), but we allow the
second antenna current to exhibit a constant phase difference, ξ, from that of the ﬁrst.
The far-ﬁeld observation point, P, lies at spherical coordinates, (r, θ, φ). From this
point, the antennas appear close enough together so that (1) the radial lines, r and

r1, are essentially parallel, and (2) the electric ﬁeld directions at P are essentially the
same (along aθ). Using Eq. (57), we may therefore write the total ﬁeld at P, with the
understanding that the presence of the second antenna on the x axis will introduce a
φ dependence in the ﬁeld that was previously not present:

(67)
Next, we may express the distance to P from the second antenna, r1, in terms of the
distance to the ﬁrst antenna, r (also the spherical coordinate radius), by noting that in
the far-ﬁeld approximation we have
r1 .= r −s
where s is one leg of the right triangle formed by drawing a perpendicular line segment
between the second antenna and the line of radius, r, as shown in Figures 14.11 and
14.12. The length, s, is the projection of the antenna separation, d, onto the radial
line, r, and is found through
s = d ax · ar = d sin θ cos φ
(68)
Therefore,
r1 .= r −d sin θ cos φ
(69)
In the far-ﬁeld, the distance, d sin θ cos φ, is very small compared to r, which
allows us to neglect the difference between r and r1 in the magnitude terms in (67)
(so that 1/r1 .= 1/r). As we know from the dipole studies, the difference cannot be
neglected in the phase terms in (67) because phase is very sensitive to slight changes
in r. With these considerations in mind, Eq. (67) becomes

Equation (74) demonstrates the important principle of pattern multiplication that
applies to arrays of identical antennas. Speciﬁcally, the total ﬁeld magnitude consists
of the product of the pattern function magnitude, or element factor for the individual
antennas, |F(θ)|, and the normalized array factor magnitude, given by | cos(ψ/2)|.
The array factor is often denoted by
A(θ, φ) = cos(ψ/2) = cos

Equation (74) then becomes
|Eθ P(r, θ, φ)| = 2E0

|F(θ) | |A(θ, φ)|
(76)
This principle can be extended to arrays of multiple elements by appropriately modi-
fying the array factor, as we will ﬁnd. The underlying assumption is that the individual
array elements are essentially uncoupled; that is, they induce negligible currents in
each other. With appreciable coupling, the problem is far more complicated, and
pattern multiplication cannot be used.
In the ﬁeld pattern expressed in (76), the E plane (or θ dependence) is primarily
determined by the individual elements, or by |F(θ)|. It is in the H plane where the
effect of the array is the strongest. In fact, the main reason for using an array of this
conﬁguration is to enable control of the H-plane pattern. In the H plane (θ = π/2),

The H-plane pattern depends on the choices of the relative current phase, ξ, and the
element spacing, d.

This reaches a maximum at φ = π/2 and 3π/2, or along the direction that is normal
to the plane of the antennas (the y axis). This occurs regardless of the choice of d,
and the array is thus referred to as a broadside array. Now, by choosing d = λ/2,
we obtain A = cos[(π/2) cos φ], which becomes zero at φ = 0 and π (along the x
axis), and we have single main beams along the positive and negative y axis. When
d is increased beyond λ/2, additional maxima (sidelobes) appear as φ is varied, but
zeros still occur along the x axis if d is set to odd multiples of λ/2.
The broadside array of the previous example can be regarded as the simplest case.
More interesting behavior occurs when a nonzero phase difference exists between the
two currents, and adjustments can be performed in the phase and element spacing.
EXAMPLE 14.4
Determine the necessary conditions to establish an endﬁre array, in which the maxi-
mum radiation is directed along the x axis.

positive sign is chosen. Equation (77) now becomes

This function maximizes at φ = 0, and reaches zero at φ = π. We have thus created

works can be understood by realizing that the phase lag in current in the element
at x = d just compensates for the phase lag that arises from the propagation delay
between the element at the origin and the one at x = d. The second element radiation
is therefore precisely in phase with the radiation from the ﬁrst element. The two ﬁelds,
therefore, constructively interfere and propagate together in the forward x direction.
In the reverse direction, radiation from the antenna at x = d arrives at the origin to
ﬁnd itself π radians out of phase with the radiation from the x = 0 element. The
two ﬁelds therefore destructively interfere, and no radiation occurs in the negative x
direction.

UNIFORM LINEAR ARRAYS
We next expand our treatment to arrays of more than two elements. By doing this,
more options are given to the designer that enable improvement of the directivity
and possibly an increase in the bandwidth of the antenna, for example, As might
be imagined, a full treatment of this subject would require an entire book. Here, we
consider only the case of the uniform linear array to exemplify the analysis methods
and to present some of the key results.
The uniform linear array conﬁguration is shown in Figure 14.13. The array is
linear because the elements are arranged along a straight line (the x axis in this
case). The array is uniform because all elements are identical, have equal spacing, d,
and carry the same current amplitude, I0, and the phase progression in current from
element to element is given by a constant value, ξ. The normalized array factor for
the two-element array can be expressed using (71) as:

|An(ψ)| as evaluated from Eq. (81) over the range −2π < ψ < 2π for cases in which the
number of elements, n, is (a) 4, and (b) 8.
Plots of Eq. (81) are shown in Figure 14.14 for the cases in which n = 4 and
n = 8. Note that the functions always maximize to unity when ψ = 2mπ, where m is
an integer that includes zero. These principal maxima corrrespond to the main beams
of the array pattern. The effect of increasing the number of elements is to narrow the
main lobes and to bring in more secondary maxima (sidelobes).
To see how the array pattern is shaped, it is necessary to interpret the array
function, Eq. (81), with regard to angular variation in the H plane. In this plane
(where θ = π/2), we have ψ = ξ + kd cos φ. Then, knowing that φ varies from 0 to
2π radians, cos φ varies between ±1, and we can see that ψ will be within the range
ξ −kd ≤ψ ≤ξ + kd
(83)
Choices of the current phasing, ξ, and the antenna spacing, d, determine the range of
ψ values that will appear in the actual array pattern. This could lead, in some cases,
to a fairly narrow range in ψ that may or may not include a principal maximum. The
current phase determines the central value of ψ and the antenna spacing determines
the maximum variation of ψ that occurs about the central value as the azimuth angle
φ is varied.
As discussed in Section 14.5, a broadside array has main beams that occur normal
to the array plane (at φ = π/2, 3π/2). The condition for this is that the principal
maximum, ψ = 0, will occur at these angles. We therefore write
ψ = 0 = ξ + kd cos(π/2) = ξ
and so we would set ξ = 0 to obtain a broadside array. In this case, (83) gives −kd <
ψ < kd. The central value of ψ is thus zero, and so the principal maximum there is
included in the pattern. In the H plane, and with ξ = 0, we thus have ψ = kd cos φ.
The ψ = 0 point will always occur at φ = π/2 and 3π/2, and this will be true
regardless of the choice of element spacing d. The effect of increasing d is to enlarge
the range of ψ that results when φ varies over its range of 0 to 2π. Therefore, for a
given number of elements, the main beam will get narrower, but more sidelobes will
be present in the pattern when the element spacing is increased.

540
ENGINEERING ELECTROMAGNETICS
An endﬁre array requires a principal maximum to occur along the x axis. In the
H plane, we may therefore write
ψ = 0 = ξ + kd cos(0) = ξ + kd
or ξ = −kd to obtain endﬁre operation with a maximum occurring along the positive
x axis. This may or may not result in a main beam occurring along the negative x
axis as well.
EXAMPLE 14.5
For arrays of 4 and 8 elements, select the current phase and element spacing that will
give unidirectional endﬁre operation, in which the main beam exists in the φ = 0
direction, whereas no radiation occurs in the direction of φ = π, nor in the broadside
directions (φ = ±π/2).
Solution. We want ψ = 0 when φ = 0. Therefore, from ψ = ξ + kd cos φ, we
would require that 0 = ξ +kd, or that ξ = −kd. Using 4 or 8 elements, we ﬁnd either
from Eq. (81) or from Figure 14.14 that zeros will occur when ψ = ±π/2 and ±π.
Therefore, if we choose ξ = −π/2 and d = λ/4, we obtain ψ = −π/2 at φ = π/2,
3π/2, and ψ = −π at φ = π. We thus have ψ = −(π/2)(1 −cos φ). Polar plots of
the resulting array functions are shown in Figure 14.15a and b. Again, the move from
4 to 8 elements has the effect of decreasing the main beamwidth, while increasing the
sidelobe count from 1 to 3, in this case. If an odd number of elements is used with the
above choices in phasing and spacing, a small sidelobe will be present in the φ = π
direction.
In general, we may choose current phasing and element spacing to establish the
main beam in any direction. Choosing the ψ = 0 principal maximum, we may write
ψ = 0 = ξ + kd cos φmax
⇒cos φmax = −ξ
kd
so that the main beam direction can be changed by varying the current phasing.

ANTENNAS AS RECEIVERS
We next turn to the other fundamental purpose of an antenna, which is its use as
a means to detect, or receive, radiation that originates from a distant source. We
will approach this problem through study of a transmit-receive antenna system. This
is composed of two antennas, along with their supporting electronics, that play the
interchangeable roles of transmitter and detector.
Figure 14.16 shows an example of a transmit-receive arrangement, in which the
two coupled antennas together comprise a linear two-port network. Voltage V1 and
current I1 on the antenna at the left affect the voltage and current (V2 and I2) on
the antenna at the right—and vice-versa. This coupling is quantiﬁed through trans-
impedance parameters, Z12 and Z21. The governing equations take the form
V1 = Z11I1 + Z12I2
(84a)
V2 = Z21I1 + Z22I2
(84b)
Z11 and Z22 are the input impedances to antennas 1 and 2 when either antenna is
isolated and is used as a transmitter, or equivalently, if the two antennas are sufﬁciently
far away from each other. The real parts of Z11 and Z22 will be the associated radiation

resistances, provided ohmic losses in all conductors and all losses to surrounding
objects are reduced to zero. We will assume this, in addition to far-zone operation, to
be true here. The trans-impedances, Z12 and Z21, depend on the spacing and relative
orientation between the antennas, as well as on the characteristics of the surrounding
medium. A critical property of the transimpedances in a linear medium is that they
are equal. This property is the embodiment of the reciprocity theorem. Stated simply,
Z12 = Z21
(85)
Further insights can be found by inverting (84a) and (84b), and invoking the admit-
tance parameters, Yi j:
I1 = Y11V1 + Y12V2
(86a)
I2 = Y21V1 + Y22V2
(86b)
where, again, the reciprocity theorem tells us that Y12 = Y21.
Now, suppose that the terminals of antenna 2 are shorted, so that V2 = 0. In this
case, Eq. (86b) gives I ′
2 = Y21V ′
1, where the single prime denotes the condition of a
shorted antenna 2. Instead, we could short antenna 1, resulting in I ′′
1 = Y12V ′′
2 (with
the double prime indicating conditions with antenna 1 shorted). Because reciprocity
holds, it follows that

Equation (87) applies regardless of the relative positioning and orientation of the
two antennas. We know that in a given direction, each antenna will transmit a power
density whose value is determined by the antenna radiation pattern. Furthermore, we
would expect to see the current that is set up on the receiving antenna depend on that
antenna’s orientation; that is, there is a reception pattern that the receiving antenna
presents to the incoming signal. Now, for a ﬁxed relative orientation between the two
antennas, with antenna 1 as the transmitter, and antenna 2 shorted, a certain ratio
V ′
1/I ′
2 will be obtained. This ratio will depend on the relative orientation, which in
turn will depend on the radiation pattern of antenna 1 and on the reception pattern of
antenna 2. If roles are reversed such that the transmitter now becomes the receiver,
and with antenna 1 shorted, a ratio V ′′
2 /I ′′
1 will be obtained that by Eq. (87) is the same
as before. The conclusion we must come to is that the extent to which the receiving
antenna accepts power will be determined by its radiation pattern. This means, for
example, that the main beam direction in the radiation pattern of the receiving antenna
corresponds to the direction from which it is most sensitive to incoming signals. The
radiation and receiving patterns of any antenna are the same.

antenna 2 is the receiver, at which the load is attached. A primary assumption is that the
antennas are far enough away from each other so that only forward coupling (through
Z21) will be appreciable. The large separation distance means that the induced current

I2 is likely to be much less than I1. Reverse coupling (through Z12) would involve
transmission of the received signal in antenna 2 back to antenna 1; speciﬁcally, the
induced current I2 further induces a (now very weak) additional current I ′
1 on antenna
1; that antenna would then carry a net current of I1 + I ′
1, where I ′
1 << I1. We
therefore assume that the product Z12I2 can be neglected, under which Eq. (84a) gives
V1 = Z11I1. A load impedance, ZL, is connected across the terminals of antenna 2,
as shown in the upper part of Figure 14.17. V2 is the voltage across this load. Current
IL = −I2 now ﬂows through the load. Taking this current as positive, Eq. (84b)
becomes
V2 = VL = Z21I1 −Z22IL
(88)
This is just the Kirchoff voltage law equation for the right-hand equivalent circuit
shown in the lower part of Figure 14.17. The term Z21I1 is interpreted as the source
voltage for this circuit, originating from antenna 1. Using (88), along with VL = ZL IL,
leads to

By comparing the above result with Eq. (65), R11 is interpreted as the radiation

current amplitude at the driving point is the maximum amplitude, I0. As we found
earlier, the latter will occur in a dipole if the overall antenna length is an integer
multiple of a half-wavelength. Using (91) and (92), we write the ratio of the received

by radial distance, r, and with relative orientations that are speciﬁed by values of θ, as
measured with respect to each antenna axis.5 With antenna 1 serving as the transmitter
and antenna 2 serving as the receiver, the radiation pattern of antenna 1 is given as
a function of θ1 and φ1, while the receiving pattern of antenna 2 (equivalent to its
radiation pattern) is given as a function of θ2 and φ2.
A convenient way to express the received power in an antenna is through its
effective area, denoted Ae(θ, φ), and expressed in m2. Refer to Figure 14.18, and
consider the average power density at the receiver (antenna 2) position, originating
from the transmitter (antenna 1). As per Eqs. (25) and (26), this will be the magnitude
of the Poynting vector at that location, Sr(r, θ1, φ1) in W/m2, where a dependence on
φ is now necessary to describe all possible relative orientations. The effective area
of the receiving antenna is deﬁned such that when the power density is multiplied by
the effective area, the power dissipated by a matched load at the receiving antenna is
obtained. With antenna 2 as the receiver, we write
PL2 = Sr1(r, θ1, φ1) × Ae2(θ2, φ2)
[W]
(94)
But now, using Eqs. (34) and (38), we may write the power density in terms of the
directivity of antenna 1:
Sr1(r, θ1, φ1) =
Pr1
4πr2 D1(θ1, φ1)
(95)
Combining Eqs. (94) and (95), we obtain the ratio of the power received by antenna
2 to the power radiated by antenna 1:
PL2
Pr1
= Ae2(θ2, φ2) D1(θ1, φ1)
4πr2
=
|Z21|2
4R11R22
(96)
where the second equality repeats Eq. (93). We can solve (96) to ﬁnd
|Z21|2 = R11R22 Ae2(θ2, φ2) D1(θ1, φ1)
πr2
(97a)
We next note that if roles are reversed, in which antenna 2 transmits to antenna 1, we
would ﬁnd
|Z12|2 = R11R22 Ae1(θ1, φ1) D2(θ2, φ2)
πr2
(97b)
5One way to express the relative orientations is to deﬁne the z axis along the radial distance line, r. Then
angles θi and φi (i = 1, 2) are used locally to describe the orientations of the antenna axes, in which the
origins of the two spherical coordinate systems are located at each antenna feed. The φ coordinate
would thus be the angle of rotation about the r axis. For example, in Figure 14.18, with both antennas
in the plane of the page, both φ coordinates could be assigned values of zero. With antenna 2 rotated
about r such that it is normal to the page, φ2 would be 90◦, and the antennas would be cross-polarized.

546
ENGINEERING ELECTROMAGNETICS
The reciprocity theorem states that Z12 = Z21. By equating Eqs. (97a) and (97b),
it therefore follows that
D1(θ1, φ1)
Ae1(θ1, φ1) = D2(θ2, φ2)
Ae2(θ2, φ2) = Constant
(98)
That is, the ratio of directivity to effective area for any antenna is a universal con-
stant, independent of the antenna type or the direction in which these parameters are
evaluated. To evaluate the constant, we only need to look at one case.
EXAMPLE 14.6
Find the effective area of a Hertzian dipole, and determine the general relation between
the directivity and effective area of any antenna.
Solution. With the Hertzian dipole as the receiving antenna, and having length d,
its load voltage, VL, will depend on the electric ﬁeld that it intercepts from antenna 1.
Speciﬁcally, we ﬁnd the projection of the transmitting antenna ﬁeld along the length
of receiving antenna. This projected ﬁeld, when multiplied by the length of antenna 2,
gives the input voltage to the receiving antenna equivalent circuit. Referring to Figure
14.18, the projection angle is α, and thus the voltage that drives the Hertzian dipole
will be
Vin = Ei cos α × d = Ei d sin θ2
The equivalent circuit for the Hertzian dipole is now the same as that of the receiving
antenna as shown in Figure 14.17, except that we replace the source voltage, I1Z21,
with Vin as given above. Assuming a conjugate-matched load (ZL = Z∗
22), the current
through the load is now
IL = Ei d sin θ2

Comparing Eqs. (102) and (103), we ﬁnd the relation that we are looking for: the
effective area and directivity for any antenna are related through
D(θ, φ) = 4π
λ2 Ae(θ, φ)
(104)
We can now return to Eq. (96) and use Eq. (104) to rewrite the ratio of the power
delivered to the receiving antenna load to the total power radiated by the transmitting
antenna: this yields an expression that involves the simple product of the effective
areas, known as the Friis transmission formula:

(106)
These results provide an effective summary of what was discussed in this section,
by way of giving us a very useful design tool for a free space communication link.
Again, Eq. (105) assumes lossless antennas in the far zones of each other and gives
the power dissipated by a load that is conjugate matched to the receiving antenna
impedance.

A two-element dipole array is conﬁgured to provide zero radiation in the
broadside (φ = ±90◦) and endﬁre (φ = 0, 180◦) directions, but with
maxima occurring at angles in between. Consider such a set-up with ψ = π
at φ = 0 and ψ = −3π at φ = π, with both values determined in the
H-plane. a) Verify that these values give zero broadside and endﬁre
radiation. b) Determine the required relative current phase, ξ. b) Determine
the required element spacing, d. c) Determine the values of φ at which
maxima in the radiation pattern occur.
14.21
In the two-element endﬁre array of Example 14.4, consider the effect of
varying the operating frequency, f , away from the original design
frequency, f0, while maintaining the original current phasing, ξ = −π/2.
Determine the values of φ at which the maxima occur when the frequency is
changed to (a) f = 1.5 f0; (b) f = 2 f0.
14.22
Revisit Problem 14.21, but with the current phase allowed to vary with
frequency (this will automatically occur if the phase difference is
established by a simple time delay between the feed currents). Now, the
current phase difference will be ξ ′ = ξ f/f0, where f0 is the original
(design) frequency. Under this condition, radiation will maximize in the
φ = 0 direction regardless of frequency (show this). Backward radiation
(along φ = π) will develop, however, as the frequency is tuned away from
f0. Derive an expression for the front-to-back ratio, deﬁned as the ratio of
the radiation intensities at φ = 0 and φ = π, expressed in decibels. Express
this result as a function of the frequency ratio f/f0. Evaluate the
front-to-back ratio for (a) f = 1.5 f0; (b) f = 2 f0 and; (c) f = 0.75 f0.

GENERAL CURVILINEAR COORDINATES
Let us consider a general orthogonal coordinate system in which a point is located
by the intersection of three mutually perpendicular surfaces (of unspeciﬁed form or
shape),
u = constant
ν = constant
w = constant
where u, ν, and w are the variables of the coordinate system. If each variable is
increased by a differential amount and three more mutually perpendicular surfaces
are drawn corresponding to these new values, a differential volume is formed which
approximates a rectangular parallelepiped. Because u, ν, and w need not be measures
of length, such as, the angle variables of the cylindrical and spherical coordinate
systems, each must be multiplied by a general function of u, ν, and w in order to
obtain the differential sides of the parallelepiped. Thus we deﬁne the scale factors h1,
h2, and h3 each as a function of the three variables u, ν, and w and write the lengths
of the sides of the differential volume as
dL1 = h1du
dL2 = h2dν
dL3 = h3dw
In the three coordinate systems discussed in Chapter 1, it is apparent that the
variables and scale factors are
Rectangular:
u = x
ν = y
w = z
h1 = 1
h2 = 1
h3 = 1
Cylindrical:

Because u, ν, and w are independent variables, this last expression may be written as

subscripts and of u, ν, and w. Thus the total ﬂux leaving the differential volume is

Units
We describe ﬁrst the International System (abbreviated SI, for Syst`eme International
d’Unit´es), which is used in this book and is now standard in electrical engineering
and much of physics. It has also been ofﬁcially adopted as the international system
of units by many countries, including the United States.1
The fundamental unit of length is the meter, which was deﬁned in the lat-
ter part of the nineteenth century as the distance between two marks on a certain
platinum-iridium bar. The deﬁnition was improved in 1960 by relating the meter to
the wavelength of the radiation emitted by the rare gas isotope krypton 86 under
certain speciﬁed conditions. This so-called krypton meter was accurate to four parts
per billion, a value leading to negligible uncertainties in constructing skyscrapers or
building highways, but capable of causing an error greater than one meter in deter-
mining the distance to the moon. The meter was redeﬁned in 1983 in terms of the
velocity of light. At that time the velocity of light was speciﬁed to be an auxiliary
constant with an exact value of 299,792,458 meters per second. As a result, the latest
deﬁnition of the meter is the distance light travels in a vacuum in 1/299,792,458
of a second. If greater accuracy is achieved in measuring c, that value will remain
299,792,458 m/s, but the length of the meter will change.
It is evident that our deﬁnition of the meter is expressed in terms of the second,
the fundamental unit of time. The second is deﬁned as 9,192,631,770 periods of
the transition frequency between the hyperﬁne levels F = 4, m F = 0, and F = 3,
m F = 0 of the ground state 2s1/2 of the atom of cesium 133, unperturbed by external
1 The International System of Units was adopted by the Eleventh General Conference on Weights and
Measures in Paris in 1960, and it was ofﬁcially adopted for scientiﬁc usage by the National Bureau of
Standards in 1964. It is a metric system, which interestingly enough is the only system which has ever
received speciﬁc sanction from Congress. This occurred ﬁrst in 1966 and then again in 1975 with the
Metric Conversion Act, which provides for “voluntary conversion” to the metric system. No speciﬁc
time was speciﬁed, however, and we can assume that it will still be a few years before the bathroom
scale reads mass in kilograms and Miss America is a 90–60–90.

ﬁelds. This deﬁnition of the second, complex though it may be, permits time to be
measured with an accuracy better than one part in 1013.
The standard mass of one kilogram is deﬁned as the mass of an international
standard in the form of a platinum-iridium cylinder at the International Bureau of
Weights and Measures at S`evres, France.
The unit of temperature is the kelvin, deﬁned by placing the triple-point temper-
ature of water at 273.16 kelvins.
A ﬁfth unit is the candela, deﬁned as the luminous intensity of an omnidirectional
radiator at the freezing temperature of platinum (2042 K) having an area of 1/600,000
square meter and under a pressure of 101,325 newtons per square meter.
The last of the fundamental units is the ampere. Before explicitly deﬁning the
ampere, we must ﬁrst deﬁne the newton. It is deﬁned in terms of the other fundamental
units from Newton’s third law as the force required to produce an acceleration of
one meter per second per second on a one-kilogram mass. We now may deﬁne the
ampere as that constant current, ﬂowing in opposite directions in two straight parallel
conductors of inﬁnite length and negligible cross section, separated one meter in
vacuum, that produces a repulsive force of 2×10−7 newton per meter length between
the two conductors. The force between the two parallel conductors is known to be
F = µ0
I 2
2πd
and thus
2 × 10−7 = µ0
1
2π
or
µ0 = 4π × 10−7
(kg · m/A2 · s2, or H/m)
We thus ﬁnd that our deﬁnition of the ampere has been formulated in such a way as
to assign an exact, simple, numerical value to the permeability of free space.
Returning to the International System, the units in which the other electric and
magnetic quantities are measured are given in the body of the text at the time each
quantity is deﬁned, and all of them can be related to the basic units already deﬁned.
For example, our work with the plane wave in Chapter 11 shows that the velocity
with which an electromagnetic wave propagates in free space is
c =
1
√µ0ϵ0
and thus
ϵ0 =
1
µ0c2 =
1
4π10−7c2 = 8.854 187 817 × 10−12 F/m
It is evident that the numerical value of ϵ0 depends upon the deﬁned value of the
velocity of light in vacuum, 299,792,458 m/s.
The units are also given in Table B.1 for easy reference. They are listed in the
same order in which they are deﬁned in the text.

Finally, other systems of units have been used in electricity and magnetism. In the
electrostatic system of units (esu), Coulomb’s law is written for free space,
F = Q1Q2
R2
(esu)
The permittivity of free space is assigned the value of unity. The gram and centimeter
are the fundamental units of mass and distance, and the esu system is therefore a cgs
system. Units bearing the preﬁx stat- belong to the electrostatic system of units.
In a similar manner, the electromagnetic system of units (emu) is based on
Coulomb’s law for magnetic poles, and the permeability of free space is unity. The
preﬁx ab- identiﬁes emu units. When electric quantities are expressed in esu units,
magnetic quantities are expressed in emu units, and both appear in the same equa-
tion (such as Maxwell’s curl equations), the velocity of light appears explicitly. This
follows from noting that in esu ϵ0 = 1, but µ0ϵ0 = 1/c2, and therefore µ0 = 1/c2,
and in emu µ0 = 1, and hence ϵ0 = 1/c2. Thus, in this intermixed system known as
the Gaussian system of units,
∇× H = 4πJ + 1
c
∂D
∂t
(Gaussian)
Other systems include the factor 4π explicitly in Coulomb’s law, and it then does
not appear in Maxwell’s equations. When this is done, the system is said to be rational-
ized. Hence the Gaussian system is an unrationalized cgs system (when rationalized
it is known as the Heaviside–Lorentz system), and the International System we have
used throughout this book is a rationalized mks system.

Material Constants
Table C.1 lists typical values of the relative permittivity ϵ′
r or dielectric constant for
common insulating and dielectric materials, along with representative values for the
loss tangent. The values should only be considered representative for each mate-
rial, and they apply to normal temperature and humidity conditions and to very low
audio frequencies. Most of them have been taken from Reference Data for Radio
Engineers.1 The Standard Handbook for Electrical Engineers,2 and von Hippel,3
and these volumes may be referred to for further information on these and other
materials.
Table C.2 gives the conductivity for a number of metallic conductors, for a
few insulating materials, and for several other materials of general interest. The
values have been taken from the references listed previously, and they apply at
zero frequency and at room temperature. The listing is in the order of decreasing
conductivity.
Some representative values of the relative permeability for various diamagnetic,
paramagnetic, ferrimagnetic, and ferromagnetic materials are listed in Table C.3.
They have been extracted from the references listed previously, and the data for the
ferromagnetic materials is only valid for very low magnetic ﬂux densities. Maximum
permeabilities may be an order of magnitude higher.
Values are given in Table C.4 for the charge and rest mass of an electron, the
permittivity and permeability of free space, and the velocity of light.4

The Uniqueness
Theorem
Let us assume that we have two solutions of Laplace’s equation, V1 and V2, both
general functions of the coordinates used. Therefore
∇2V1 = 0
and
∇2V2 = 0
from which
∇2(V1 −V2) = 0
Each solution must also satisfy the boundary conditions, and if we represent the
given potential values on the boundaries by Vb, then the value of V1 on the boundary
V1b and the value of V2 on the boundary V2b must both be identical to Vb,
V1b = V2b = Vb
or
V1b −V2b = 0
In Section 4.8, Eq. (43), we made use of a vector identity,
∇· (V D) ≡V (∇· D) + D · (∇V )
which holds for any scalar V and any vector D. For the present application we shall
select V1 −V2 as the scalar and ∇(V1 −V2) as the vector, giving
∇· [(V1 −V2)∇(V1 −V2)] ≡(V1 −V2)[∇· ∇(V1 −V2)]

The divergence theorem allows us to replace the volume integral on the left side of
the equation with the closed surface integral over the surface surrounding the volume.
This surface consists of the boundaries already speciﬁed on which V1b = V2b, and
therefore

vol
∇· [(V1 −V2)∇(V1 −V2)] dν =

S
[(V1b −V2b)∇(V1b −V2b)] · dS = 0
One of the factors of the ﬁrst integral on the right side of (D.1) is ∇· ∇(V1 −V2),
or ∇2(V1 −V2), which is zero by hypothesis, and therefore that integral is zero. Hence
the remaining volume integral must be zero:

vol
[∇(V1 −V2)]2 dν = 0
There are two reasons why an integral may be zero: either the integrand (the
quantity under the integral sign) is everywhere zero, or the integrand is positive in
some regions and negative in others, and the contributions cancel algebraically. In this
case the ﬁrst reason must hold because [∇(V1 −V2)]2 cannot be negative. Therefore
[∇(V1 −V2)]2 = 0
and
∇(V1 −V2) = 0
Finally, if the gradient of V1 −V2 is everywhere zero, then V1 −V2 cannot change
with any coordinates, and
V1 −V2 = constant
If we can show that this constant is zero, we shall have accomplished our proof. The
constant is easily evaluated by considering a point on the boundary. Here V1 −V2 =
V1b −V2b = 0, and we see that the constant is indeed zero, and therefore
V1 = V2
giving two identical solutions.
The uniqueness theorem also applies to Poisson’s equation, for if ∇2V1 = −ρν/ϵ
and ∇2V2 = −ρν/ϵ, then ∇2(V1−V2) = 0 as before.Boundary conditionsstill require
that V1b −V2b = 0, and the proof is identical from this point.
This constitutes the proof of the uniqueness theorem. Viewed as the answer to a
question, “How do two solutions of Laplace’s or Poisson’s equation compare if they
both satisfy the same boundary conditions?” the uniqueness theorem should please
us by its ensurance that the answers are identical. Once we can ﬁnd any method of
solving Laplace’s or Poisson’s equation subject to given boundary conditions, we
have solved our problem once and for all. No other method can ever give a different
answer.

Origins of the Complex
Permittivity
As we learned in Chapter 5, a dielectric can be modeled as an arrangement of atoms
and molecules in free space, which can be polarized by an electric ﬁeld. The ﬁeld
forces positive and negative bound charges to separate against their Coulomb attrac-
tive forces, thus producing an array of microscopic dipoles. The molecules can be
arranged in an ordered and predictable manner (such as in a crystal) or may exhibit
random positioning and orientation, as would occur in an amorphous material or a
liquid. The molecules may or may not exhibit permanent dipole moments (existing
before the ﬁeld is applied), and if they do, they will usually have random orienta-
tions throughout the material volume. As discussed in Section 5.7, the displacement of
charges in a regular manner, as induced by an electric ﬁeld, gives rise to a macroscopic
polarization, P, deﬁned as the dipole moment per unit volume:
P = lim

i=1
pi
(E.1)
where N is the number of dipoles per unit volume and pi is the dipole moment of the
ith atom or molecule, found through
pi = Qidi
(E.2)
Qi is the positive one of the two bound charges composing dipole i, and di is the
distance between charges, expressed as a vector from the negative to the positive
charge. Again, borrowing from Section 5.7, the electric ﬁeld and the polarization are
related through
P = ϵ0χeE
(E.3)
where the electric susceptibility, χe, forms the more interesting part of the dielectric
constant:
ϵr = 1 + χe
(E.4)
567

568
ENGINEERING ELECTROMAGNETICS
Therefore, to understand the nature of ϵr, we need to understand χe, which in turn
means that we need to explore the behavior of the polarization, P.
Here, we consider the added complications of how the dipoles respond to a time-
harmonic ﬁeld that propagates as a wave through the material. The result of applying
such a forcing function is that oscillating dipole moments are set up, and these in turn
establish a polarization wave that propagates through the material. The effect is to
produce a polarization function, P(z, t), having the same functional form as the driving
ﬁeld, E(z, t). The molecules themselves do not move through the material, but their
oscillating dipole moments collectively exhibit wave motion, just as waves in pools of
water are formed by the up and down motion of the water. From here, the description
of the process gets complicated and in many ways beyond the scope of our present
discussion. We can form a basic qualitative understanding, however, by considering
the classical description of the process, which is that the dipoles, once oscillating,
behave as microscopic antennas, re-radiating ﬁelds that in turn co-propagate with
the applied ﬁeld. Depending on the frequency, there will be some phase difference
between the incident ﬁeld and the radiated ﬁeld at a given dipole location. This
results in a net ﬁeld (formed through the superposition of the two) that now interacts
with the next dipole. Radiation from this dipole adds to the previous ﬁeld as before,
and the process repeats from dipole to dipole. The accumulated phase shifts at each
location are manifested as a net slowing down of the phase velocity of the resultant
wave. Attenuation of the ﬁeld may also occur which, in this classical model, can be
accounted for by partial phase cancellation between incident and radiated ﬁelds.
For our classical description, we use the Lorentz model, in which the medium
is considered as an ensemble of identical ﬁxed electron oscillators in free space. The
Coulomb binding forces on the electrons are modeled by springs that attach the elec-
trons to the positive nuclei. We consider electrons for simplicity, but similar models
can be used for any bound charged particle. Figure E.1 shows a single oscillator,
located at position z in the material, and oriented along x. A uniform plane wave,
assumed to be linearly polarized along x, propagates through the material in the z
direction. The electric ﬁeld in the wave displaces the electron of the oscillator in the
x direction through a distance represented by the vector d; a dipole moment is thus
established,
p(z, t) = −ed(z, t)
(E.5)
Figure E.1

between positive and negative charge modeled by that of a

where the electron charge, e, is treated as a positive quantity. The applied force is
Fa(z, t) = −eE(z, t)
(E.6)
We need to remember that E(z, t) at a given oscillator location is the net ﬁeld, com-
posed of the original applied ﬁeld plus the radiated ﬁelds from all other oscillators.
The relative phasing between oscillators is precisely determined by the spatial and
temporal behavior of E(z, t).
The restoring force on the electron, Fr, is that produced by the spring which is
assumed to obey Hooke’s law:
Fr(z, t) = −ksd(z, t)
(E.7)
where ks is the spring constant (not to be confused with the propagation constant). If
the ﬁeld is turned off, the electron is released and will oscillate about the nucleus at
the resonant frequency, given by
ω0 =

ks/m
(E.8)
where m is the mass of the electron. The oscillation, however, will be damped since
the electron will experience forces and collisions from neighboring oscillators. We
model these as a velocity-dependent damping force:
Fd(z, t) = −mγdv(z, t)
(E.9)
where v(z, t) is the electron velocity. Associated with this damping is the dephasing
process among the electron oscillators in the system. Their relative phasing, once
ﬁxed by the applied sinusoidal ﬁeld, is destroyed through collisions and dies away
exponentially until a state of totally random phase exists between oscillators. The 1/e
point in this process occurs at the dephasing time of the system, which is inversely
proportional to the damping coefﬁcient, γd (in fact it is 2/γd). We are, of course,
driving this damped resonant system with an electric ﬁeld at frequency ω. We can
therefore expect the response of the oscillators, measured through the magnitude of
d, to be frequency-dependent in much the same way as an RLC circuit is when driven
by a sinusoidal voltage.
We can now use Newton’s second law and write down the forces acting on the
single oscillator of Figure E.1. To simplify the process a little we can use the complex
form of the electric ﬁeld:
Ec = E0e−jkze jωt
(E.10)
Deﬁning a as the acceleration vector of the electron, we have
ma = Fa + Fr + Fd
or
m ∂2dc
∂t2 + mγd
∂dc
∂t + ksdc = −eEc
(E.11)
Note that since we are driving the system with the complex ﬁeld, Ec, we anticipate a
displacement wave, dc, of the form
dc = d0e−jkze−jωt

ϵ′ = ϵ0(1 + χ′

Key features to note in Figure E.2 include the symmetric χ′′
e function, whose full-
width at its half-maximum amplitude is γd. Near the resonant frequency, where χ′′
res
maximizes, wave attenuation maximizes as seen from Eq. (44), Chapter 11. Addi-
tionally, we see that away from resonance, attenuation is relatively weak, and the
material becomes transparent. As Figure E.2 shows, there is still signiﬁcant variation
of χ′
res with frequency away from resonance, which leads to a frequency-dependent
refractive index; this is expressed approximately as
n .=

1 + χ′res
(away from resonance)
(E.22)
This frequency-dependent n, arising from the material resonance, leads to phase and
group velocities that also depend on frequency. Thus, group dispersion, leading to
pulse-broadening effects as discussed in Chapter 12, can be directly attributable to
material resonances.
Somewhat surprisingly, the classical “spring model” described here can provide
very accurate predictions on dielectric constant behavior with frequency (particularly
off-resonance) and can be used to a certain extent to model absorption properties. The
model is insufﬁcient, however, when attempting to describe the more salient features
of materials; speciﬁcally, it assumes that the oscillating electron can assume any one
of a continuum of energy states, when, in fact, energy states in any atomic system are
quantized. As a result, the important effects arising from transitions between discrete
energy levels, such as spontaneous and stimulated absorption and emission, are not
included in our classical spring system. Quantum mechanical models must be used

Figure E.3
Idealized sketches of ensembles of polar molecules
under conditions of (a) random orientation of the dipole moments,
and (b) dipole moments aligned under the influence of an applied
electric field. Conditions in (b) are greatly exaggerated, since
typically only a very small percentage of the dipoles align
themselves with the field. But still enough alignment occurs to
produce measurable changes in the material properties.
to fully describe the medium polarization properties, but the results of such studies
often reduce to those of the spring model when ﬁeld amplitudes are very low.
Another way that a dielectric can respond to an electric ﬁeld is through the
orientation of molecules that possess permanent dipole moments. In such cases, the
molecules must be free to move or rotate, and so the material is typically a liquid
or a gas. Figure E.3 shows an arrangement of polar molecules in a liquid (such as
water) in which there is no applied ﬁeld (Figure E.3a) and where an electric ﬁeld
is present (Figure E.3b). Applying the ﬁeld causes the dipole moments, previously
having random orientations, to line up, and so a net material polarization, P, results.
Associated with this, of course, is a susceptibility function, χe, through which P
relates to E.
Some interesting developments occur when the applied ﬁeld is time-harmonic.
With ﬁeld periodically reversing direction, the dipoles are forced to follow, but they do
so against their natural propensity to randomize, owing to thermal motion. Thermal
motion thus acts as a “restoring” force, effectively opposing the applied ﬁeld. We can
also think of the thermal effects as viscous forces that introduce some difﬁculty in
“pushing” the dipoles back and forth. One might expect (correctly) that polarizations
of greater amplitude in each direction can be attained at lower frequencies, because
enough time is given during each cycle for the dipoles to achieve complete alignment.
The polarization amplitude will weaken as the frequency increases because there is
no longer enough time for complete alignment during each cycle. This is the basic
description of the dipole relaxation mechanism for the complex permittivity. There
is no resonant frequency associated with the process.

APPENDIX E

The complex susceptibility associated with dipole relaxation is essentially that
of an “overdamped” oscillator, and is given by
χrel =
Np2/ϵ0
3kBT (1 + jωτ)
(E.23)
where p is the permanent dipole moment magnitude of each molecule, kB is
Boltzmann’s constant, and T is the temperature in degees Kelvin. τ is the thermal
randomization time, deﬁned as the time for the polarization, P, to relax to 1/e of
its original value when the ﬁeld is turned off. χrel is complex, and so it will possess
absorptive and dispersive components (imaginary and real parts) as we found in the
resonant case. The form of Eq. (E.23) is identical to that of the response of a series
RC circuit driven by a sinusoidal voltage (where τ becomes RC).
Microwave absorption in water occurs through the relaxation mechanism in polar
water molecules, and is the primary means by which microwave cooking is done, as
discussed in Chapter 11. Frequencies near 2.5 GHz are typically used, since these
provide the optimum penetration depth. The peak water absorption arising from dipole
relaxation occurs at much higher frequencies, however.
A given material may possess more than one resonance and may have a dipole
relaxation response as well. In such cases, the net susceptibility is found in frequency
domain by the direct sum of all component susceptibilities. In general, we may write:
χe = χrel +
n

i=1
χi
res
(E.24)
where χi
res is the susceptibility associated with the ith resonant frequency, and n is
the number of resonances in the material. The reader is referred to the references for
Chapter 11 for further reading on resonance and relaxation effects in dielectrics.
