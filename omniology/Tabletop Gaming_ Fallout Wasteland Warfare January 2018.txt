Every year the Emperor walks through 
the Imperial Gardens to greet the spring, 
every year he stops beneath the sakura 
trees, and every year you try to paint his 
picture. This will be your year.
Sakura is a light tactical game of pushing 
your luck, and pushing your friends. Each 
player will simultaneously decide how 
far to move both their character and the 
Emperor. The player closest to the Emperor 
when the cherry blossoms are reached 
will gain a huge amount of prestige, but if 
you push too far you risk bumping into the 
Emperor and walking away in disgrace.

even take a trip back in time to game with the Vikings...

We asked…
What games and 
conventions are you looking 
forward to in 2018?
You said…
Betrayal Legacy!
Jennifer Kaufer
Star Wars: Legion is the obvious 
one, but Betrayal Legacy has the 
potential to be an all-time great 
horror-themed game.
Daniel Williams
Fallout: Wasteland Warfare is the 
game I’m most looking forward 
to. Also intrigued by Star Wars: 
Legion. As for shows, always look 
forward to Salute!
Mark Sheppard
UK Games Expo gets bigger and 
better every year, so can’t wait 
for even more! Also interested to 
see how Tabletop Gaming Live will 
be in September before heading 
to Essen Spiel for only the second 
time in October.
Sam Freeman
Forbidden Lands by Fria Ligan. 
Also the BattleTech game on PC.
Dave Thompson
PAW 2018 in Feb in Plymouth, 
Devon. Plus more new Necromunda.
Ian Henderson
Village Attacks, which looks like 
being a hoot and has some lovely 
miniatures. Really hoping the 
gameplay is as good.
Jeﬀ Stokes
Shadows of Brimstone: Forbidden 
Fortress, Time of Legends: Joan of 
Arc (especially historical mode).
Kevin Thomas
BACK TO THE HOUSE 
ON THE HILL
Pandemic Legacy and Risk 
Legacy designer Rob Daviau 
returns with Betrayal Legacy
The man who pioneered the legacy genre 
with Risk Legacy and Pandemic Legacy has 
revealed his plans to transform another 
tabletop favourite.
Betrayal Legacy is Rob Daviau’s 
upcoming take on Betrayal at House on 
the Hill, the 2004 horror adventure game 
known for its various haunt scenarios and 
traitor mechanics.
Betrayal Legacy will again feature 50 haunts, but each 
playthrough will be connected in a series of 13 chapters 
that tells a story over several decades and multiple 
generations of the same families. That means you might 
play as one character, only to control their descendant 
in a later scenario (if they survive, that is). Items found in 
the spooky manor can also be passed down, gaining extra 
signiﬁcance and becoming family heirlooms.
Although you can expect the game to feature the 
same permanent modiﬁcation and destruction of the 
board, cards and whatnot as other legacy games, 
Betrayal Legacy is said to be fully replayable after the 
story is ﬁnished, allowing you to experience the haunts 
you might’ve missed.
The game marks a return to Betrayal at House 
on the Hill for Daviau, more than a decade after he 
worked on the 2004 game while at Hasbro – the same 
role that later led him to create Risk Legacy, his ﬁrst 
title based on the innovative format.
Betrayal Legacy is planned for release toward the end 
of 2018.
MASTERS OF MAGIC 
Te latest Magic: Te Gathering World 
Cup has crowned its international victors
Japan has bested Poland to take home the latest 
World Magic Cup from the annual tournament.
2017’s competition saw 73 teams of three from 
around the globe battle it out in the collectible card 
game, with China, Italy, Poland, Wales, Slovakia and 
Germany ﬁlling out the top eight rankings.
The home nations performed well, with all but 
Northern Ireland making it through to the second day 
of the competition. Scotland made history by becoming 
the only team to always make it to the second day and 
walked away with a Spirit Award for its display of its 
national pride with Braveheart-style face paint and kilts.
The highest-placed UK team was Wales, which lost 
to Poland in the day three quarterﬁnals, placing it ﬁfth 
overall. The team also picked up a Spirit Award.
Next year’s World Magic Cup will be held from 
December 14th to 16th in Barcelona, Spain.

PAINTS USED
ZENITHAL HIGHLIGHTING
Zenithal highlighting at its core is a much more complicated 
process than what I am going to show you in this guide. I will 
show a basic version that helps apply a simpliﬁ ed version 
of highlighting. This begins at the basecoating stage, whilst 
preparing the model for the later stages.
Begin by basecoating the 
miniature black. This is easiest 
with a black spray paint.
Once the black is dry, apply a 
light spray of white from the 
top around the model. This 
will create a light element 
of highlighting and shading 
straight oﬀ  the bat that will 
either provide shading and 
highlighting in later stages or a 
guide as to where they should 
be applied. 
STAGES
Each creature is split up into four stages, each with a list 
of colours and the corresponding paint that was used 
for it. Each stage uses a diﬀ erent technique to achieve a 
similar eﬀ ect on each element but with diﬀ erent colours.
Stage 1 is base colours. Base colours are applied using a 
mix of glazes and ﬂ at colours.
Stage 2 is applying shading. In this stage we use 
various washes and glazes to add an element of 
shading to the models.
Stage 3 is highlighting. This stage involves applying a line 
of your colour along the hard edges and ridges of the 
area. I would recommend using a ﬁ ne brush and adding a 
tiny dash of water to your paints.
Stage 4 is ﬁ nal highlight. This involves adding a small dot 
or dash of a colour, generally in the same area as the 
previous highlight, but focusing on corners or where folds 
in cloth meet. For hair or fur it involves adding a dot to 
the tip of each strand. If you ﬁ nd yourself unsure of where 
to apply the highlights or spot highlights, look over the 
images alongside the guide and compare that stage to 
the last.
Stage 5 is the ﬁ nal details. This stage involves cleaning up 
and adding a few spot highlights. This stage also includes 
painting the base of the model.

More fun than tiling your bathroom!
AZUL
TRY THIS IF YOU LIKED… SAGRADA
Azul has fewer moving parts than Sagrada, but its drafting and tile-laying 
mechanics are just as strong and the visuals are equally gorgeous.
WHAT’S IN 
THE BOX?
◗ 100 resin tiles
◗ Four player boards
◗ Nine factory displays
◗ First player marker
◗ Linen bag
I
t was only a matter of time before 
someone took term ‘tile-laying’ 
literally and designed a game 
about – you guessed it – laying down 
tiles. Azul embraces this prosaic 
premise and takes it to a wonderfully 
colourful place, delivering ambitious 
gameplay on its way.
‘Azul’ – Spanish and Portuguese 
for 'blue' – comes from the word 
‘azulejos’, decorative tiles used by 
Portuguese monarch Manuel I. Tis 
sets up the game, giving players some 
background information to justify 
tiling walls – beyond this, though, the 
theme is entirely window dressing. 
Tis is fairly insigniﬁcant as, at its 
heart, Azul is a quick abstract game 
with beautifully-made tiles.
At a ﬁrst glance, it might seem that 
there are a lot of luck elements within 
the game. After the initial random 
drawing of tiles out of a bag, however, 
the game becomes pure strategy. 
Players can collect tiles of the 
same colour from one of the plates, 
moving remaining tiles to the centre. 
Alternatively, they can also pick from 
the centre, once at least one tile has 
been moved there. Once taken by 
the player, the tiles are moved to the 
‘pattern lines’. 
Already, this simple action of 
picking up tiles and placing them 
on the player mat has a myriad of 
possible tactical decisions. Players 
might take a risk and discard several 
tiles to the middle, in the hope that 
enough tiles of the same colour will 
accumulate by the time the turn 
returns to them, allowing them to 
pick up a lot of them at the same 
time – but there's always the chance 
their opponents might get those 
tiles ahead of them. Te order in 
which the tiles are transferred to 
the ‘pattern lines’ is important, too. 
Which colour is best to build ﬁrst? 
Which colours are other players 
going for? Which combinations need 
to be picked up to avoid excess tiles 
going to the ‘ﬂoor line’ and hence 
earning a player minus points?
Te scoring part of Azul is equally 
tactical. Transferring one tile from 
the pattern line to the ‘wall’ earns 
players a single point. Put tiles 
adjacent to each other instead and 
you'll score one point for each tile 
in a horizontal and vertical row 
attached to the newly-placed tile. 
Tis means that points can rack up 
quite fast with thoughtful sequence 
of placements. It also eliminates 
a possibility of a runaway winner, 
because one cleverly added tile to 
the wall can bring in enough points 
to catch up, even in the last round. 
Winning in Azul depends entirely on 
the player and the set of decisions 
they make during the game.
Tis is not to say that Azul lacks 
player interaction and opponents 
cannot inﬂuence each other’s moves. 
In the drafting stage of the game it is 
quite easy to steal tiles form under 
an opponent’s nose or, alternatively, 
leave them with tiles they do not 
want. Tis confrontation is most 
pronounced in a two-player game, 
where Azul turns into a tense chess-
like game of push-and-pull between 
the players.
Despite the simplicity of its 
mechanics, Azul’s rules can feel 
ﬁddly and confusing, especially with 
its scoring. Azul is the type of game 
that will ‘click’ after playing it once, 
and the second time going players 
will make more strategic and better-
informed decisions. Luckily, one 
game of Azul, even with four people, 
lasts about half an hour, so it is very 
easy to play just one more.
Azul is everything one would 
want from an abstract game; it looks 
instantly beautiful on the table 
and its gameplay is challenging 
and addictive. Te game is really 
good at rewarding players for their 
thoughtful mo ves and placements, 
and, despite one minor luck 
element, there is a real breadth of 
choice and decisions to be made 
throughout the game. 
Breathtakingly beautiful and tactically 
exciting, Azul will be a great addition 
to any board game shelf. While its 
premise is seemingly mundane, this is 
a game unlike any other.

JAMEY STEGMAIER
The man behind strategy hit Scythe and last year’s Charterstone mulls over 
the game that started it all: 2013’s winemaking, worker-placing Viticulture
F I R S T  T U R N
of wine had a diﬀerent numerical system; so some wine 
might get much more valuable the longer it ages, while 
other wine might de-value as it ages. And it wasn’t fun. So 
over time I simpliﬁed those things and focused more on fun 
and function.”
HOW TO PLAY
“In Viticulture you are one of potentially up to six players 
who are running a vineyard. You build buildings to expand 
your vineyard, you plant vines, you accept wine orders and 
you’re trying to fulﬁl those wine orders. Vineyard tours, and 
tasting, are a big part of the industry, so I wanted to capture 
that element, too. Not that I’m a ‘wine person’. I’m more 
of a beer drinker, myself. But I did a lot of research!”
END OF THE GAME
“I never really knew what would come out of Viticulture. I 
hoped that people would play it. What I didn’t imagine was 
that it would become an evergreen game for Stonemaier. 
We go through three or four printings a year, especially 
since the Essential Edition came out. A very special moment 
was when Uwe Rosenberg emailed me and said he enjoyed 
playing it. And then for me to actually work with him, on 
designing the Moor Visitors expansion, was incredible.” 
STRATEGY TIPS
“I severely underestimated the value of blind 
playtesting. Tat’s when the designer or publisher 
sends ﬁles of the game to people to playtest 
when they’re not there. So the designer doesn’t 
help teach the game, or answer questions. 
And you usually get some incredible 
feedback by doing this. With Viticulture, 
most of the blind playtesting came during 
the Kickstarter campaign, which is much 
later than it needs to be done. So th at was 
a big takeaway for me, and a big thing I 
advocate to other designers.” 
BACKGROUND
“I have been designing games as a fun hobby since I 
was a little kid. But it wasn’t until I was midway through 
my second career – as a director of operations at an on-
campus facility – that I started on Viticulture. Kickstarter 
was a big inspiration; when I started to see board 
game projects on it, it clicked that maybe I could make 
something that people would want.” 
COMPONENTS
“When I’m designing a game and I play another game 
for the ﬁrst time, it will often inﬂuence me. If I recall 
correctly, at the time I started designing Viticulture I 
got Fresco for Christmas. So that had an immediate 
impact, in that it has a ‘wake up’ track very similar to 
Viticulture’s. I also played Stone Age around that time, 
too, and that’s when I thought, ‘Oh, I really love the 
worker-placement thing. Let me see if that’s a good ﬁt for 
Viticulture’. Before that, it was more of a card game.” 
 
OBJECT
“I wanted to design a game I thought would appeal to 
gamers, and also appeal to non-gamers who just happen 
to love wine. Tough that didn’t end up being the case. It 
ended up much more appealing to gamers… and gamers 
who like wine. Winemaking just came to mind as one of 
these things we tend to romanticise. Like farming. It’s 
kind of odd that we romanticise that, because I think very 
few people actually want to go out and work on a farm. 
But it somehow works as a romanticised idea in board 
games. And wine, I thought, elevated that idea a little bit.”
SETUP
“Te game was much more spreadsheety early on. I was 
trying to simulate too many things. I had weather factoring 
into the value of the grapes. I had soil types that would 
impact on how good the grapes were. And in your cellar, 
where right now you just age wine sequentially, every type

CYBERPUNK
First released in the late ‘80s at the height of 
the gritty sci-ﬁ sub-genre rooted in sex, drugs 
and (virtual) rock ‘n’ roll, Cyberpunk was a shot 
of adrenaline wired directly into players’ nerves. 
Among the diverse characters players can create 
are hackers and mercenaries able to augment 
themselves with advanced tech – although the 
blurring of lines between human and machine often 
plays into the drama, especially as the combat sticks to a realistic 
approach that means characters remain vulnerable to a single bullet. The original game 
was set in 2013, but later editions advanced the setting to 2020 and then 2030 as life 
caught up with art. As rich and rewarding as a Philip K. Dick story, Cyberpunk might well 
be the coolest game on this list – or indeed on the tabletop.

DUNGEONS & 
DRAGONS
Let’s get this one out the way ﬁrst, shall we? 
Dungeons & Dragons is the obvious choice, but 
it’s the obvious choice for a reason. Flexible, 
simple to get to grips 
with and backed up by 
more than four decades 
of supplements and 
adventures, the world’s 
biggest RPG has never 
been better or easier to get 
into for newcomers thanks 
to its fantastic ﬁfth edition 
and a slew of new digital 
tools to help ﬁrst-time 
heroes jump straight in.

Whether your alter-ego is a hapless bank robber, doomed investigator 
of the paranormal or tech-obsessed hacker, there’s an RPG out there 
for you. Here are ten titles you shouldn’t pass up the chance to play
January 2018
FIASCO
In every roleplaying campaign, things 
inevitably go awry. There are few 
games, however, where accidents 
and mishaps aren’t just part of the 
action – they are the action. Fiasco 
is inspired by tales about hapless 
criminals, capturing the black 
comedy and drama of ﬁlms like 
Fargo in about the same amount of 
time as a movie without the need 
for a GM. There’s no preparation 
needed and the action is dictated 
by little more than imagination and 
six-sided dice, making it a great 
way for those looking for a ﬁrst 
taste of roleplaying to have fun.
Play if you like: Screwing up 
without worrying about it, not 
having a GM, the Coen brothers
ADVENTURES IN 
MIDDLE-EARTH
Although you’ll need Dungeons & Dragons’ ﬁfth edition to use 
this Lord of the Rings-inspired set of books (earlier RPG The One 
Ring is a standalone option), there’s probably no better choice 
if you’re a diehard fan of Tolkien’s momentous fantasy series. Set just after The 
Hobbit, Adventures in Middle-earth’s Player’s 
Guide provides all the rules needed to create 
characters rooted in the lore of the world, 
while the various supplements bring even 
more races, creatures and locations to your 
campaign. There are several other changes 
to D&D’s formula too, swapping alignment 
for corruption (all players are good) and 
introducing extra tips for journeys and advice 
on forming your own fellowship, but combat 
and much of the D&D foundation remains the 
same, making it just as easy to get started.

NUMENERA
Set on our Earth, but 
in a far-ﬂung future 
approximately a billion 
years from now (so, a 
while), Monte Cook’s sci-
ﬁ creation boasts a captivating setting 
and reﬁned d20-powered gameplay that 
has quickly made it a modern smash hit. 
Players’ characters are created using 
a simple system that uses a single 
sentence to outline their personality, 
background and skills before heading 
out into the Ninth World and 
discovering its mixture of fantasy 
tropes ﬁltered through imaginative 
science-ﬁction. After inspiring everything 
from a video game and short ﬁlm to a series of novels and other 
board games, a sequel to the game is planned for release later 
this year, but it’s still well worth revisiting the original.
Play if you like: Exploring strange but familiar worlds, 
Clarke’s Third Law, unconventional fantasy
SHADOWRUN
Combining the advanced tech of sci-ﬁ with the magical 
wonder of fantasy, Shadowrun takes place in a world 
that has been inhabited by mythological creatures, 
leading to humans giving birth to beings such as elves, 
dwarves and more or transforming into orks and trolls. 
There’s often a cyberpunk edge to the 
action, with underground hackers working 
together to break into megacorporations 
– although sometimes they’re simply 
working for a rival company. Shadowrun’s 
incredible setting has been the source 
of endless inspiration for players and 
creators alike, spawning dozens of 
novels, other games and more – so if 
you’re hooked, there’s no shortage of 
ways to dive even deeper into the world.
Play if you like: Fantasy 
and sci-ﬁ together, Android: 
Netrunner, cyberpunk
VAMPIRE
Flipping the typical RPG setup, 
in Vampire players are the monsters, embodying 
the undead personalities of blood-sucking kindred in the moody, 
atmospheric World of Darkness that would go on to serve as the 
backdrop to RPGs based on other classic horror creatures such as 
Werewolf, Mummy, Demon and Wraith. Vampire moves away from 
many of the clichés of vampire stories, exploring the idea of a civilisation 
of clashing vampire clans hidden in modern-day cities. Both a ‘classic’ 
game – The Masquerade – and updated sequel The Requiem are still 
available, with a ﬁfth edition of The Masquerade due out early this year 
and introducing a focus on ‘you are what you eat’ mechanics .

CALL OF CTHULHU
The ultimate horror RPG, Call of Cthulhu is a stone-cold classic of 
the tabletop. Set in the world of terrifying cosmic monsters and 
murderous occultists created by H.P. Lovecraft, Call of Cthulhu 
diﬀers from so many roleplaying games by making players’ 
investigators physically and psychologically fragile as they delve 
into the forbidden knowledge of the unknown. Characters don’t have classes; instead, 
they’re just like regular humans with occupations and particular skills trying (often 
in vain) to stop the world’s destruction. Often this 
means that players spend hours attempting to 
solve a mystery only to end up dead, insane or 
worse, but Call of Cthulhu makes failure so fun 
it’s easy to see why it continues to be so popular 
more than 30 years after it debuted. The most 
recent seventh edition ﬁxes many of the issues of 
older versions, particularly surrounding combat, 
and there’s plenty of spin-oﬀs and supplements 
available for fans, from the comic book-like Pulp 
Cthulhu to the Arkham Horror board games 
inspired by the original RPG.
Play if you like: Scary movies, Lovecraft, mysteries, 
going insane (it’s more fun than it sounds)
GURPS
The Generic Universal RolePlaying System is one of the 
most versatile RPGs around, oﬀering a ﬂexible set of rules 
that can be used to roleplay in pretty much any setting 
or genre you can think of. Characters are deﬁned with 
a set of basic traits and then a set of advantages and 
disadvantages that help to give them 
realism and balance – for instance, a 
particularly clever character might also 
have a drinking problem. GURPS might 
require a little more eﬀort to get going 
than some of the other entries on this list 
because of the scope and complexity of 
its one-size-ﬁts-all approach, but if you’re 
looking for a single game that could be 
used for everything from a gunslinging 
cowboy adventure to a planet-hopping 
space opera, it’s got you covered. 
Play if you like: Thinking of ideas that 
others don’t have, playing exactly the 
way you want to, literally anything
PATHFINDER
Based on the third edition 
rules of Dungeons & Dragons 
(and therefore backwards 
compatible with many of its 
supplements), Pathﬁnder 
was originally designed as a successor to the 
roleplaying favourite but quickly forged its own 
path with a unique approach to character 
creation, class progression and combat that 
saw it gather a massive following itself. The 
game has an essentially active community 
thanks to the Pathﬁnder Society and Adventure 
Path, a series of campaigns released as six 
monthly episodes. Pathﬁnder was followed up 
with a sci-ﬁ sequel, Starﬁnder, last year, which 
takes place in the same expansive universe and 
adds in rules for spaceship dogﬁghts and more.

GENESYS CORE 
RULEBOOK
Genesys is Fantasy 
Flight’s new foray into 
roleplaying games. It’s 
not a single large setting, 
but ﬁve smaller ones and, 
while the rules require a 
specialist set of dice, the 
mechanics promise to 
allow a greater degree of 
freedom to work within 
the worlds provided. In 
the manner of Steve 
Jackson’s GURPS before 
it, the core book is a single 
ruleset to set you on the 
path, with no doubt with 
many expansions to follow. 
WORLD WAR 
CTHULHU: 
OUR AMERICAN 
COUSINS
The 1970s were a decade 
of revolution, both on home 
soil and abroad, and it is 
into the colonies that World 
War Cthulhu: Cold War now 
ventures. This book details 
intelligence agencies and 
coverups, and contains a 
full guide on how to create 
American investigators 
for WWC. It also contains 
a complete adventure 
designed for characters 
made with the book and a 
series of NPCs to use.
UNMASKED
From the ‘70s to the 
‘80s, and a world very 
dissimilar from the recent 
Tales from the Loop 
RPG set in the decade. 
Unmasked is the latest 
oﬀering using the Cypher 
system ﬁrst seen in 
Numenera and features 
a world where the players 
are teens who don masks 
in the evening to ﬁght as 
their superpowered alter-
egos. With a full setting 
and all-new abilities to 
add to your other Cypher 
games, it promises to be 
a very dark future. 
CONAN THE 
MERCENARY
The latest oﬀering from 
Modiphius covers the 
times when Conan was 
a sellsword. Players 
are given the chance 
to work as a part of the 
mercenary companies, 
as well as knowing 
where to ﬁnd work as a 
mercenary, the countries 
that have the most 
need for them and the 
enemies that they are 
often hired to ﬁght. The 
book also includes rules 
for mass battles and the 
tactics of mercenaries.
CAPHARNAÜM
The upcoming English 
translation of the French 
game Capharnaüm: The 
Tales of the Dragon-
Marked. A world not 
unlike the original 
Arabian Nights, but with 
more in common with 
the Exalted universe, 
players live vicariously 
as paragons of the gods 
in the unending sun of 
a land in chaos. Due 
in the ﬁrst quarter of 
2018, and with a series 
of adventures already 
planned, this will be one 
to watch .
Te start of a new year means a beginning for both new 
games and fresh takes on older roleplaying classics

W
hen was the last time you saw 
someone smoking on the cover 
of a board game? How about two 
people smoking? How about on the cover of a 
game published by Mattel, the home of Barbie 
and Fisher-Price?
Caf é International is that game. In the late 
1980s Mattel Germany had made a big push 
into the booming board game market, 
working with premier-league designers 
to produce a range of family-
friendly titles. ‘Family-friendly’ 
is a relative term; Mattel’s 
oﬀerings included Till 
Eulenspiegel, a game 
based on a series of 
folktales about a 
character who 
mostly does 
enormous shits, 
and Suppenkasper, 
a trick-forcing game 
about building meals and 
making other players 
eat them, which 
includes a 
laxatives 
card – more 
shitting – and 
which you win by 
being closest to the ideal 
weight when another 
player dies of anorexia 
or explodes from 
overeating. I’m not trying 
to explain or justify 
these games, I’m just 
noting that they exist 
and were published by Mattel. You 
may never look at a Barbie the same way again.
And then Café International won the Spiel 
des Jahres. 
Café International is an altogether more 
tasteful aﬀair, or so you might think. A 
tile-placing game of seating diners at a 
cosmopolitan restaurant, it was the brainchild 
of veteran designer Rudi Hoﬀman, who had 
been producing games since the 1960s, and 
was a forerunner of a style of tile-based 
mechanics that 11 years later would 
evolve into Carcassonne.
Tere’s a restaurant with 24 
tables and a bar in the middle. 
For reasons that are unclear 
each table may only be 
occupied by people of a 
certain nationality, and if 
you were wondering at 
what point in the 20th 
century Germany got 
over the stigma of 
the racial segregation 
imposed by the Nazis, 
evidently by 1989 they 
were just ﬁne with it. 
What’s more, each table 
can only be occupied 
by mixed couples or 
groups – no singletons 
or single-sex 
gatherings here – and a 
table of four must be two 
men and two women. 
Your job is to use the 
ﬁve tiles in your hand 
to ﬁll as much of the 
restaurant as possible, 
two tiles at a time. You 
score for each tile, with 
scores that increase the more 
game published by Mattel, the home of Barbie
and Fisher-Price?

people there are at a table, and double if 
they’re all of the same nationality. Because, 
you see, some of the tables have chairs that 
overlap with other tables: the English (it says 
‘England’ not ‘Britain’ or ‘UK’) must share 
their space with Africans, Chinese, Spaniards 
and Italians. It’s not a roleplaying game, but 
roleplaying some of the conversations that 
might ensue between people forced onto the 
same tables does give the game an interesting 
new dimension. 
Teoretically it’s possible to ﬁll the board 
completely, but in practice some tiles soon 
become unplayable, and that’s where the 
bar in the middle comes in. It has 20 seats. 
Putting otherwise unplayable tiles on the 
ﬁrst ﬁve will actually earn you points, but the 
numbers get increasingly negative after that. 
Add an interesting twist that reduces your 
hand size by one every time you complete a 
table of four diners from the same country, 
and some clever stuﬀ with jokers, and you’ve 
got an interesting, engaging and pleasantly 
unpredictable game.
Tere are two problems with Café 
International. Te ﬁrst is one that I’ve 
mentioned before: the Spiel des Jahres is an 
award for family games, and therefore some 
of its winners lack the tactical depth that an 
older, more hobbyist crowd would expect. Café 
International is one of those titles. Te small 
hand size makes it hard to think tactically 
more than a turn ahead, and the fact that each 
player is supposed to keep their tiles face-up 
removes any element of mystery from the 
gameplay. It’s fun to play, and an enjoyable 
mental workout, but it feels more like a 
competitive puzzle than a regular game. In 
1989 this was groundbreaking stuﬀ, but it’s not 
aged well.
Te other problem is the tiles that represent 
the diners of the 12 nations. Here we learn a 
lot about the way Germans stereotyped the 
world in 1989, and if the gameplay feels dated 
then hold onto your hair – we’re only getting 
started. Te tiles show pictures of the diners, 
male and female. A lot of them are what you 
might expect: Americans have big hats or big 
hair; the English have a bowler and a pipe, or a 
Lady Di haircut and an overbite. Generally the 
white European people come out of it okay. 
However, those who are African (thick lips, 
wide grins) or Chinese (slit-eyed and buck-
toothed) are less fortunate.
It’s not screamingly oﬀensive, and certainly 
wasn’t intended to be. But it is oﬀensive, and if 
a game was released with these kind of images 
today then your social media platform of choice 
would have a meltdown. Café International is 
an artefact of its time in more ways than just its 
game design, and that time was early 1989. Te 
Soviet bloc still existed, Berlin would still be 
divided by a wall for another few months and 
national attitudes were all about us-and-them. 
All the same, I’m pretty sure that if I’d been 
writing this review in 1989, I’d still have called 
out this art for its casual racism.
It’s a shame. Tere’s a lot to like in Café 
International. It’s not great with two players, 
but it’s a clever melding of puzzle and theme, 
not quite like anything else. Te gameplay is 
about how we should be able to ﬁnd ways to 
share the same space despite our diﬀerences. 
But its graphic design anchors it ﬁrmly at 
the end of a strange, troubled decade, and 
perhaps it should have stayed there.

THE SCI-FI ADVENTURE BOARD GAME 
FOR 1-5 PLAYERS

JASON 
THOMPSON
The quick-draw creator of Mangaka and Cartooner 
explains why Cosmic Encounter is out of this world
my favourite game
total number of dead tokens – everyone’s dead tokens 
– to all its attacks. To ﬁght the Warpish, you really 
need an ally like the healer, who brings tokens back from 
the dead. Or the zombie, who never dies; its defeated 
tokens just shamble to other planets and regroup. Te 
trader can trade hands with an opponent, the plant can 
copy and accumulate other players’ powers, the terrorist 
booby-traps planets so they explode…
Te base set of Fantasy Flight’s 2008 Cosmic Encounter 
(the most recent edition) has 50 alien powers; there’s nearly 
200 if you add all the expansions, and each combination 
of dueling aliens is a unique game. Like your class in 
Dungeons & Dragons, your alien race in Cosmic determines 
your strategy and even your personality if you choose to 
roleplay. Like characters in a good ﬁghting game, the aliens 
are asymmetrical, varying in complexity and strength, from 
the awesome virus (multiply your tokens by the value of 
your attack card, instead of adding it) to the questionable 
worm (move your tokens around between your planets, 
like they’re burrowing – I think? I still don’t understand 
it). While there’s no blatantly useless prank aliens, the 
designers of Cosmic understand that a lot of fun is worth 
sacriﬁcing a little balance. In northern California coﬀee 
shops in the 1990s, my friends and I house-ruled it and 
played games with two or three alien powers each, just 
to see what amazing combos we could pull oﬀ. Cosmic’s 
sense of escalating chaos inspired the design of my own 
games, Mangaka and Cartooner, in the sense that strange, 
unexpected card interactions are a fun thing to be desired.
From its simple, clean, primary-colored components 
and tokens, to its delightfully goofy, bug-eyed aliens, 
Cosmic Encounter is a delight to look at. Much more 
importantly, it’s a delight to play. Te modularity of 
the rules makes it easy to simplify it or make it more 
complex by taking out certain aliens and classes 
of cards. Each time I play it I marvel at how the 
designers knew what to put in and what to 
leave out, what to leave to player 
choice and what to randomise. 
(How much playtesting did it 
take for the designers to decide 
that players shouldn’t be able to 
choose who they ﬁght each round, so 
people can’t gang up on the weakest player and 
wipe them out of the game?)
Te ﬁrst edition of Cosmic is subtitled “A Science 
Fiction Game for Everyone”. It really is. Some life forms, like 
some games, are so perfect they don’t need to evolve. 
C
osmic Encounter, the world’s greatest 
science-ﬁction board game, is now more 
than 40 years old, but it doesn’t look it. For 
a game that was conceived in 1972 and 
published in 1977, when tactical wargames 
and their Gygaxian spawn ruled geek culture, Cosmic 
Encounter feels like an ancient alien, a visitor from 
some advanced civilisation bearing gaming insights that 
wouldn’t become commonplace for 30 years.
It’s the execution, not some high concept, that makes 
Cosmic Encounter so great. “Alien races compete for territory 
by taking over each other’s planets” could have been the 
pitch for any 1970s wargame. Even as late as 1988 Avalon Hill 
was still making crusty sci-ﬁ games like Merchant of Venus, 
with preset maps, dice-based subsystems and hundreds of 
unique tokens; in contrast, Cosmic Encounter is a triumph of 
abstraction and minimalism. Each player’s starting territory 
consists of an identical star system with ﬁve identical planets. 
Te territories slot together in a modular way, gathered 
around the central repository for dead tokens: the warp. 
Each planet starts with four identical tokens, which represent 
your troops, and the cone (a pointer) that represents 
where your troops are headed in any given round.
Combat is basic. Each player has a hand of numbered 
cards and, when you ﬁght, each side plays a card facedown. 
Flip them over: the player with the higher number, plus 
the number of tokens in combat, wins. (Here comes the 
diplomatic element: you can send foreign troops/tokens to 
assist your friends.) It’s a bluﬃng game, like poker: should 
you commit your best card to the battle, or will you end up 
wasting a 40 while your opponent throws the ﬁght with a -5? 
Of course, if they’ve got allies when they play that -5, sending 
their trusting friends screaming to their deaths, grudges will 
be held. Win ﬁve ﬁghts, conquer ﬁve planets and you win.
What makes this simple foundation work is that Cosmic 
(as we called it when I played it in school) is one of the ﬁrst 
examples of an exceptions-based rules system. Weird cards 
tweak the gameplay in countless ways, from compromise 
cards (you lose the battle, even against a -5, but can draw 
consolation cards from your opponent’s hand) to multiplier 
cards and special cards which initiate a non-violent deal 
between players or have other strange eﬀects.
Te real twist is alien races. At the start of the game 
each player chooses or randomly draws an alien card, 
which gives you a unique special power for the entire 
game. For example, the sorcerer can choose to switch 
attack cards with their opponent, after they’re chosen 
but before they’re ﬂipped face-up. Te Warpish adds the

Te irradiated America 
and mutated inhabitants 
of Fallout come to life in 
Wasteland Warfare, a 
miniatures game that 
embraces the roleplaying 
core of the series with 
its story-focused 
take on wargaming. 
Chris Birch leads 
us on a tour of the 
post-apocalypse
Words and photographs

T
hese evocative four words have 
served as the opening for all 
four of the main instalments in 
the Fallout series, starting with 
the 1997 debut of the post-
apocalyptic roleplaying video 
game. When it comes to Fallout 
itself, however, things have 
changed drastically since its 
days of 2D turn-based strategy 
on the PC, with 2008’s Fallout 3 turning the game into 
a real-time ﬁrst-person roleplaying shooter. Fallout 
3 went on to sell more than 12 million copies across 
consoles and PC – the same number of copies shipped 
in the ﬁrst 24 hours of its successor, 2015’s Fallout 4.
Te series’ latest transformation may be its biggest 
in a decade, as it swaps pixels for plastic. Fallout: 
Wasteland Warfare ﬁnally brings the setting of an 
America decimated by nuclear war to the tabletop in 
the form of a miniatures wargame. While its heavily-
armoured Brotherhood of Steel knights may recall space 
marines and its super mutants have a similar green hue 
and bulky brute force to orks, Wasteland Warfare is far 
more than just simple fan service or another two-a-
penny sci-ﬁ miniatures eﬀort, paying ample homage to 
Fallout’s roleplaying and strategy origins. Te result is 
a wargame with a tale to tell that doesn’t shy away from 
layering in aspects of roleplaying and storytelling over 
its dice-driven combat.
“I’m sure a lot of people will just buy it for the minis 
to collect, but we’re not just trying to make a dumbed-
down game, which would be very tempting,” explains 
Chris Birch, founder of UK studio and Wasteland 
Warfare publisher Modiphius. “I believe in making 
really great experiences.”
Fallout’s arrival on the tabletop could be considered 
a return of sorts. Te original PC game was initially 
designed based on Steve Jackson’s ﬂexible pen-and-
paper roleplaying system GURPS but was eventually 
forced to drop the framework for reasons that remain 
disputed to this day. In the place of GURPS, developer 
Interplay created the SPECIAL system, which based 
characters’ combat proﬁciency, conversational tact 
and more on seven attributes: strength, perception, 
endurance, charisma, intelligence, agility and luck.
Just as it has done for all of the video games to date, 
SPECIAL lies at the foundation of Wasteland Warfare, 
inﬂuencing the stats of each unit as they do battle in 
the irradiated ruins of cities or abandoned tunnels 
of underground nuclear bunkers – the series’ iconic

vaults. Te system’s all-encompassing dilution of each 
character’s mental and physical abilities means that, 
in some ways, skirmishes become more like dungeons 
in an RPG. One turn, a character might be engaged 
in a gun battle; another could ﬁnd them bartering for 
information, searching for items or taking control of a 
remote turret or robot.
“Every character has SPECIAL stats, so it means 
you’ve got a lot more ﬂexibility with stuﬀ you can 
do with scenarios,” Birch says. “You might have to 
interact with someone using your charisma, you 
might have to use your strength to break open a door, 
you might have to hack a piece of equipment. It’s 
another level above the normal wargame. Maybe it’s 
more of an adventure game.”
If the similarities with an RPG weren’t strong 
enough, Wasteland Warfare employs a dice pool that 
strays away from the familiar six-sided cubes so often 
used in wargames, including a d20 and ﬁve pairs 
of colour-coded d12s – “Weird dice,” Birch jokingly 
calls them. As well as traditional number checks 
for accuracy and armour, the custom dice include 
symbols for bonus damage, armour penetration and 
the activation of special abilities with results showing 
the series’ Nuka-Cola drink bottles. 
Te dice tie into each unit’s distinctive SPECIAL 
stats in a unique way that reﬂects their diﬀering 
skills – a human might have their overall hit points 
dictated by their ability to dodge with agility, while 
a tougher muscled mutant might shake oﬀ attacks 
using endurance instead. Te scores aﬀect characters’ 
eﬀectiveness with diﬀerent types of weapon, 
too, making mutants formidable up close while 
Brotherhood of Steel soldiers excel at longer range.
“Super mutants can’t hack doors because of their 
big hands,” Birch laughs.
Adding to the streamlined wargame mechanics is 
a set of similarly colour-coded movement and range 
rulers (both the dice and the rulers feature symbology 
for use by colourblind players). Particular weapons 
gain bonus damage dice and other eﬀects at diﬀerent 
ranges, neatly decoded by weapon cards attached to 
each character’s main reference sheet. Tese cards bring 
into the fold a reimagining of VATS, the slow-motion 
targeting system introduced in Fallout 3 that allowed 
players of the video game to eﬀectively pause the action 
and target speciﬁc areas of an opponent’s body to 
incapacitate limbs or deal critical damage. In Wasteland 
Warfare, certain weapons can cause ongoing negative 
eﬀects to enemies when triggered by the right roll.
Te rolls go beyond combat, too, heightening 
the feeling of exploration and survival in the 
nuclear wilderness.
“Tere can be pools of radiation that might give you 
radiation damage,” explains Birch. “You might search 
a container and ﬁnd out that it’s radioactive when you 
open it, which will give you a radioactive attack. Tere 
are traps; you might ﬁnd a trapped box or Nuka-Cola 
machine. Tere’s diﬀerent things to search like consoles 
and vending machines – all the classic stuﬀ from Fallout. 
We’ve even got the little terrible radiation shelters; the 
really mad radiation shelters that really weren’t very 
good and you keep ﬁnding skeletons inside them.”
WRITTEN BY THE WINNERS
Te narrative focus of the missions is reﬂected 
by an extensive campaign mode inspired 
– at least to begin with – by the stories 
of the last two numbered entries 

in the series (2010’s non-direct sequel Fallout: New 
Vegas is seemingly skipped over). Tese scenarios can 
be tackled with two players taking control of either side 
of the encounter, or in a single-player mode that uses AI 
cards to control the moves of the enemies and ensure 
they’re engaging with the varying objectives on the map. 
As well as the ﬁve scripted narrative missions in the core 
box, there are also ﬁve solo-centric scenarios, plus ﬁve 
tutorial chapters.
“You can play solo; a lot of wargamers don’t get 
round to see all their friends,” Birch conﬁrms. “It’s got 
a really fun solo play side to it, you can just go and 
explore the wasteland. You and your dog.”
In classic roleplaying fashion, Wasteland Warfare’s 
story opens with the player’s ‘sole survivor’ emerging 
from their vault to ﬁnd a dog caught in a trap. It turns 
out to be a trap laid by super mutants, who return to 
check their catch and decide that the human would 
make for a better snack. Winning the skirmish unlocks 
canine companion Dogmeat for the survivor, in the 
ﬁrst of several branching moments in the campaign 
that lead to diﬀerent endings and rewards – in another 
example mentioned by Birch, the player seeks revenge 
for a character’s murdered brother, interrogating an 
enemy leader to potentially discover the real killer, 
with the speech check’s outcome revealing diﬀerent 
cards and plot beats.
Making your way through the rest of the story 
presents the chance to acquire further teammates and 
improved items and equipment, gradually building up 
from the survivor and a pistol to a roving band of allies 
that persist between matches. Tis includes events such 
as mercenaries, who could be hired using caps and 
added to the deck of wasteland event cards revealed 
during each round, appearing later to take a shot at an 
enemy. Other cards drawn from a quest deck between 
scenarios can aﬀect the potential incidents that occur 
during the following scenario, triggering dangers such 
as a radroach infestion or radiation storm.
“Te game is kind of, if you like Mordheim or 
Necromunda, it’s more that kind of grow a little crew 
and develop them, but you can have a big game as 
well,” Birch says. “It plays up to, like, 30 ﬁgures. Tere’s 
a lot more narrative to it, a lot of storylines in the 
missions. You can just play a normal battle, but it’s very 
much– I’ve been a big wargamer since I was a kid, so I 
really wanted to make sure there was a lot more deep 
storylines to the games, as well.”
Te sense of storytelling in the Fallout world will 
extend to the game’s presence at tournaments and 
other organised play events, with Birch revealing that 
both standard and narrative-focused competitions will 
be an option. For those wanting to keep up with the 
game’s plot, Modiphius plans to release free monthly 
missions online, punctuated by bigger organised play 
narrative packs every three to four months.
For more generalised battles outside of the story 
progression, such as one-oﬀ skirmishes, the core game 
includes ﬁve more setups that involve less 
speciﬁc objectives.
“Where possible we’re using 
storylines from the game 
that already exist 
instead of creating 
new content,” Birch 
says. “Tere’s so many 
quests and stories for 
us to work from. Or we 
can be quite generic, 
where you’re looking 
through the ruins of an 
old atomic power planet 
for a synth head that 
contains some secrets. But 
there’s a storyline that we’re 
working loosely based around the 
main quest lines in Fallout 4 and 3.”
With such a strong focus on 
narrative gameplay and character 
progression, and the rich world 
and inhabitants of Fallout already 
established over the course of 
decades, some players may ﬁnd 
themselves wondering why 
Fallout studio Bethesda passed 
up the opportunity to produce 
a full-blown roleplaying game 
based on the setting.

It’s another level above 
the normal wargame. 
Maybe it’s more of an 
adventure game.

“Tey didn’t really want to do a roleplaying game 
because they know, of anyone, how much work is 
involved in approving a roleplaying game,” Birch 
responds. “Luckily, we’ve got a fantastic world to delve 
into so we don’t have to create anything really. We’re 
going to be enlarging upon some of the references to 
other battles and missions to create lots of scenarios. 
In a sense, if you just take three or four characters 
onto the battleﬁeld versus a bunch of creatures, you’re 
almost playing an adventure there. It’s very ﬂexible.”
SETTLE FOR MORE
In place of the customisable player-created characters 
that served as the heroes in the Fallout video games, 
Wasteland Warfare takes the step of canonising 
two vault dwellers as the default protagonists of its 
campaign: female hero Nora and male lead Nate.
“Obviously they’re from Fallout 4,” Birch says. “We’re 
going to do a set of vault dwellers, generic ones. We’re 
going to work our way through, from Fallout 4, Fallout 
3, backwards.”
To stop the survivors stealing the spotlight, other 
characters can be made heroic, unlocking additional 
abilities to use during an encounter, such as the 
chance for extra actions, environmental interactions 
and critical hits. Tese heroic individuals can 
subsequently be promoted to leaders, introducing 
area-of-eﬀect skills that boost allies around them – 
including characters from previously hostile factions.
“You’ll be able to build your force with diﬀerent 
allies and mix-and-match,” Birch conﬁrms. “Or if you 
want, you can just go, ‘I really want a Brotherhood 
of Steel guy in power armour, I really like 
that super mutant with a big hammer, 
I want to have a survivors and Dogmeat with armour’ 
– you can just build your own thing, because it’s your 
world, it’s your game.”
Speaking of the fan-favourite hound, there’ll be no 
shortage of customisation options for those wanting to 
roam the wasteland with their poochy pal.
“It’s probably the single most popular character 
in the game,” Birch laughs. “Tere’s various versions 
of Dogmeat, so you get to play vanilla Dogmeat, or 
Dogmeat with his goggles and bandana, armoured 
Dogmeat, that kind of thing.”
Te character progression is most pronounced 
in the game’s settlement mode, which sees players 
improving their individual home base in-between 
scenarios using caps collected by winning games and 
searching containers. Building structures and upgrading 
utilities allows players to keep more and better gear 
found during missions, which are otherwise potentially

discarded as they ‘wear out’. Some of the buildings allow 
players to choose speciﬁc weapons and armour to take 
into their next battle, while others require the drawing 
of random cards to represent scavenging the wastes for 
whatever will do – a better headquarters means more 
control over your loadout.
“You’ll be able to upgrade your settlement in 
the background, so you’ll be able to buy an armour 
workbench to give you access to more T-60 armour 
suits,” Birch explains. “You might get a weapon 
workbench to get access to better upgrades for 
your weapons.”
While player settlements are tracked on paper by 
default, it’s not hard to imagine committed fans taking 
the opportunity to build their own scenery or use some 
of the pre-built structures being released for the game 
to render their base in 3D. Whether it exists on paper 
or in plastic, players can bring their post-apocalyptic 
home to life by engaging in head-to-head modes that 
make use of the customisability, including a setup 
where one player attacks the other’s base.

say, ‘Look, let’s do a 500-cap battle, I’ll attack your 
settlement,’ you think: ‘Ah, maybe I’ll buy more 
turrets this time because Chris is always buying 
loads of mutant hounds which come racing in.’ It’s a 
bit like doing a tower defence game, where you can 
try diﬀerent strategies each time. So you’re not ﬁxed 
on that one base, you can rebuild your base with 
your caps.”
Players can also work together against the 
game’s AI, controlling separate factions or the 
same group of survivors depending on the scale 
of the encounter.
“You can even play co-op, so you and me could 
defend our base against the game, which will attack us 
with a larger force,” Birch summarises.
While Wasteland Warfare will feature a narrative 
focus in both casual matches and tournaments, 
the option to simply build a force using traditional 
points will be there, too – so if you want to set out 
into the wasteland with just two fully kitted-out 
soldiers or a dozen nimble survivors in little more 
than their radioactive undies, you can do so. In a 
break from convention, how much each character, 
piece of equipment and ability will cost doesn’t come 
written on the cards. In fact, the space has been left 
deliberately blank so the inevitable shifting values 
can be easily adjusted as a result of feedback from 
the game’s community and tournament scene, with 
Modiphius planning to update them each month so 
players can choose whether to write them in or use 
sleeves to avoid having to correct their components.
“Tey always change,” Birch admits. “We’re just 
being honest.”
ROOM FOR WAR 
Wasteland Warfare’s stories recreate the desperate 
ﬁght for survival in the wilderness between 
scattered groups of survivors. Introduce more 
miniatures, though, and the scale of the game 
can be taken from smaller encounters between a 
handful of ﬁgures to sweeping clashes between 
dozens of units, with players’ control changing from 
moving individual models to ordering collected 
squads around the battleﬁeld. 
Birch says that the game’s ﬂexible scale was partially 
inspired by viral YouTube videos featuring mods for 

25
tabletopgaming.co.uk
F A L L O U T:  WA S T E L A N D  WA R F A R E
Fallout’s PC versions, where players are able to spawn 
in dozens of computer-controlled characters and 
enemies and watch them duke it out to the death.
“Lots of people always do all these videos with, 
‘Let’s have 50 deathclaws versus 100 Brotherhood 
of Steel and see what happens,’” he explains “So 
people are kind of putting their own little wargames 
together. I want to be able to do that in real life with 
the miniatures.”
Fallout’s in-universe history is comprised of 
countless ﬁghts between the world’s various factions, 
so there’s no shortage of opposing forces ready to 
players to assume control of – and battles from the 
extensive lore of the universe ready to be recreated.
“Te obvious factions we’ve got are the raiders, 
Brotherhood of Steel, Te Institute, the super mutants,” 
Birch says. “We’ve got this kind of generic faction called 
the ‘survivors’, which is Mama Murphy, Ronnie, Sturges, 
some Minutemen, Preston Garvey. Tere will be a 
Minutemen faction later on. So you could play back in 
time when the Minutemen were forced [to abandon 
their Fort Independence base]. Tere’ll be the Enclave, 
later on, as well. Ten we’re going to work our way 
through other stuﬀ. Tere’s lots of little, mini factions. 
For example, Riley’s Rangers, who are on the good side. 
So the survivors would have them as an ally. So there’s 
lots of allied units. Tere’s lots of neutral units. People 
like Children of the Atom and stuﬀ like that.
“I think a lot of people remember what the video 
game is like and think, ‘Well, I want to be able to play 
the battles that you hear about in the game. Like the 
Battle of Hoover Dam or something,’” he says. “You 
often hear about battles and go, ‘Wouldn’t it be great to 
play that and have more troops around you?’ 
“What we’re trying to do is look at all the behind-
the-scenes stories. So, you hear about a battle that took 
place – we’ll play that battle out. We’re going to have a 
diﬀerent branching story that’s still within the universe.”
Te ﬁrst three sides in the game will be relatively 
straightforward – Brotherhood of Steel, super mutants 
and the survivors – but there are already plans to take 
Wasteland Warfare in a wilder direction with some of its 
ﬁrst expansions. Among these will be rules to turn the 
world’s creatures and robots, which otherwise primarily 
appear as environmental elements during encounters, 
into their own playable factions – including the chance 
to build an army of fearsome chameleonic deathclaws 
and mutated crab-like mirelurks, or a legion of 
assaultrons, protectrons and other custom automatons 
created with build-it-yourself robot parts.
All of this builds towards Birch’s ultimate vision for 
Wasteland Warfare: a highly adaptable wargame that 
allows players to play out conﬂicts great and small 
in one of the richest post-apocalyptic universes ever 
created. With the world of Fallout ripe with endless 
stories to be explored on the tabletop, it looks like 
Wasteland Warefare is well  on its way to ﬁnd its own 
place at the end of the world.  
The scenario opens with a Brotherhood 
of Steel knight and couple of initiates 
that have encountered three super 
mutants around the Red Rocket gas 
station. We pick the Brotherhood of 
Steel side for the gatling laser, which 
ﬁres ﬁve times and reduces armour with 
every consecutive hit.
With an equal number of ﬁgures, we 
roll to decide the ﬁrst player. It’s the 
super mutants, which move up into cover 
behind a pile of junk and the main building.
The knight charges up his gatling 
laser and takes all ﬁve shots at the 
approaching super mutant leader while 
he’s still exposed. Two shots land, but 
are stopped by the mutant’s armour. 
One of the initiates takes a pop at 
another of the mutants and successfully 
dishes out a wound thanks to the laser 
riﬂe’s special armour-bypassing ability. 
The Brotherhood hold their ground 
behind cover.
The knight lets oﬀ another blast of the 
gatling laser at the mutant leader, with 
one single shot of the ﬁve dealing a wound 
despite the cover bonus. As the leader 
moves out into the open to charge at the 
knight, an initiate opens ﬁre but misses. 
His squadmate moves closer to beneﬁt 
from the shorter range of his riﬂe, sinking 
a shot through one of the mutants’ 
armour but failing to bring down the giant.
A super mutant ﬁnally closes the 
gap, charging into melee with one of 
the initiates, which gets him a bonus as 
he swings at the human’s head with his 
board. Somehow it misses, allowing the 
soldier’s companion to join the fray and 
retaliate with his stun baton, stunning the 
monster – but it hardly matters with his 
cranium completely turned to mush. He 
drops down dead.
The knight opens ﬁre for a third time 
at the mutant leader and a lucky series of 
four hits in a row turns him into a bloody 
mess. Two down, one to go.
The remaining super mutant runs up 
to the initiates and, after shrugging oﬀ 
a series of knife and baton attacks from 
the pair, tears right through one of them 
with a single point-blank shotgun blast 
thanks to two bonus damage dice. Gulp.
With just one hit point left, the mutant 
survives one more knife attack and 
takes out the other initiate with another 
brutal blast. Weakened, the beast ﬁnally 
falls to an attack from the charging 
knight – but not without leaving his gory 
mark on the wasteland.

f literature has Roald Dahl, it could be that 
gaming has Jerry Hawthorne.
Te designer’s Mice & Mystics was a 
dungeon crawler unlike any other, combining 
the adventuring and dice-throwing of 
Dungeons & Dragons and HeroQuest with 
the in-depth story of a children’s novel, 
contained in its tome of narrative directions 
that doubled as a kind of artiﬁcial paper game 
master. Players weren’t just characters; they 
were readers, both passively discovering and actively 
controlling the action and plot during each of the 
game’s scenarios, ﬁttingly referred to as ‘chapters’.
Just as the work of Dahl, Neil Gaiman and Terry 
Pratchett never shies away from addressing the darker 
side of life and fantasy, Hawthorne’s tale of staunch 
courtiers transformed, Te Witches-style, into ﬁeld 
mice was full of moments of tension and horror as the 
group encountered insects, rats and cockroaches now 
big enough to snuﬀ them out. To say nothing of the 
game’s greatest threat: the prowling housecat, Brodie.
Te result was an experience that was grown-up 
enough in its tone and roleplaying-lite gameplay to 
keep parents and other older players interested, while 
still having the simplicity and fairytale feel needed to 
give kids their ﬁrst proper taste of gaming.
Hawthorne’s next big project stays true to his 
commitment to storytelling on the tabletop and 
all-ages approach to design. While Stuﬀed Fables can 
in many ways be seen as a student of Mice & Mystics’ 
philosophies, though, the designer is resolute in 
pointing out its diﬀerences to his best-known work.
“I approached this as its own separate project,” he 
says. “It’s a whole new game system that I created so 
that I could tell stories like this. But the similarities 
it has with Mice & Mystics are a natural comparison 
because the game is also a story. I don’t know of 
any other games out there that really do as heavy 
storytelling as Mice & Mystics and now Stuﬀed Fables. 
You really are playing inside of a storybook.”
On this last point, he’s being quite literal. Where 
Mice & Mystics’ structure felt like a book with chapter-
style scenarios and a connected storyline, Stuﬀed 
Fables takes the comparison to its conclusion by 
combining rules and game board into a single tome 
that is laid out ﬂat in the centre of the table. Players 
place their miniature adventurers directly onto the 
environment, while the opposite page might explain 
the story, narrative choices or any special rules needed 
for that particular mission.
“Te book is really a great innovation because it 
allows me to tell a much richer story since every page 
is completely diﬀerent,” Hawthorne says. 
“You don’t know what to expect because 
the information is somewhat hidden from you 
because it’s in the book form, too. So you’ve gotta 
play to the point where you can turn that page 
and ﬁnd out what happens next. Tat page-
turning kind of dopamine response you get, that’s 
diﬀerent than Mice & Mystics, because Mice & 
Mystics you were always working with that same 
set of tiles that were arranged in as many creative 
ways as I could possibly imagine, but you would 
cross that fairly quickly.”

DREAM TEAM
Stuﬀed Fables’ story takes place a world away 
from the castles and dungeons of Mice 
& Mystics, but the fairytale morals and 
childhood themes remain as strong as ever.
Players take on the role of the ‘Stuﬃes’: stuﬀed 
toys tasked with protecting a young girl from nightmares 
while she sleeps. In the game’s opening, the girl is 
moved from her crib to a full-size bed for the ﬁrst time, 
with her parents using the toys to help calm her nerves.
“Stuﬀed animals are kind of like surrogate parents 
if you think about it,” Hawthorne explains. “Tey 
really exist so that parents can get a good 
night’s sleep. Tey give kids something to 
snuggle and ﬁght away their fears so that 
parents can sleep and the child can sleep 
and everybody gets a good night’s rest.”
With the magical protection of the crib’s bars 
gone, the forces of the Nightmare King, an evil 
presence that takes advantage of children’s 
disturbed sleep, invade the girl’s room. 
After a tussle with the minions, the 
Stuﬃes end up being sucked into the 
portal to the nightmare world, which is 
inhabited by broken and lost toys. Stuﬀed 
Fables follows the party as it attempts to help those 
stranded in the nightmare realm while also ﬁghting oﬀ 
further attacks by the Nightmare King.
Te story spans seven chapters, each representing 
a diﬀerent year in the girl’s life from the age of three 
until she turns ten. Te natural progression of the 
overarching narrative means that each scenario is 
based on a fresh confrontation with the Nightmare 
King as the girl grows up and overcomes the various 
challenges of getting a good night’s rest.
“When you sit down to play one session of 
Stuﬀed Fables you’ll be playing through one night 
in this little girl’s life where you would normally 
expect her sleep to be troubled,” Hawthorne reiterates. 
“Tose are the nights where the Nightmare King is 
going to come and those are the nights 
where mayhem happens. For instance, 
the second chapter of the book is the night 
where the players put her to bed for the ﬁrst time 
without an overnight diaper, so she’s potty training. 
Tat night when the minions arrive they run around 
the house turning on faucets, making all this water. 
So you have this little caper where our heroes are 
running around the house trying to turn oﬀ faucets 
before the little girl wets the bed. Tat just leads to 
more and more adventure.”
Although the wider saga has a ﬁxed story it wants 
to tell, players’ actions will be able to inﬂuence the 
outcome of each separate section, resulting in diﬀerent 
encounters and even ﬁnales depending on 
what they choice to do.
“A play session will be roughly 90 minutes, 
give or take, because the story is branching – 
so you might take a diﬀerent turn in the story 
that might make the story last a little bit longer,” 
Hawthorne explains. “You just play through the book; 
the book just basically guides you right on through.
“You’re going to play through the seven stories 
in the game, and each of them have three possible 
endings to them. So if you were to play through it 
again you might have diﬀerent endings and a diﬀerent 
experience. But it is a fairly linear story – there’s just 
diﬀerent paths and diﬀerent tracks you can take to get 
to the same sort of thing. Once you ﬁnish all seven 
stories, it’ll tell a complete story.”

It’s not just the story that players’ choices will 
impact. Te gameplay will be subtly altered as the 
group completes diﬀerent objectives and explores the 
world, unlocking various items and other discoveries 
that persist between the chapters and can pop up later 
in the same campaign.
“Tere’s some other elements in the game that kind 
of change the game,” explains Hawthorne. “So as you 
play the game some of the events that happen, some of 
the things you do in the game, will alter the game itself 
so it changes – in a small way, not in a big overblown 
way, because everything here is real streamlined and 
easy to pick up and learn so families can play without 
the rules getting in the way.”
Te main way this will occur is through new cards 
being added to Stuﬀed Fables’ various diﬀerent decks.
“When you encounter those cards through gameplay 
in the future you’ll have a diﬀerent experience because 
of having seeded those cards into the deck earlier 
through choices,” Hawthorne clariﬁes.
It’s a system that sounds similar to the evolving 
card pools of legacy games such as Gloomhaven and 
Pandemic Legacy, but Hawthorne is quick to point out 
that any changes made during a single playthrough 
will be able to be reset for future campaigns, rather 
than causing permanent alterations.
“Just in a single campaign those cards will be fed 
into the decks and then, later on, if you wanted to reset 
the whole thing, each little deck has a card that tells 
you what goes in it so you can easily reset everything,” 
he conﬁrms. “It’s done very lightly, it’s not real heavy or 
rooted heavily in the mechanics or anything. Basically, 
when you go through the story, it’ll tell you: ‘Oh, you 
did this? Okay, put this card into your deck.’ So there’s 
no micro-management or anything like that.”
MICE & DICE
Clearly inspired by Hawthorne’s adoration of HeroQuest, 
Mice & Mystics was a dice-chucker through and through. 
You threw dice to move. You threw dice to attack and 
defend. You threw dice to cast spells, use abilities and 
even level-up. It was a straightforward setup that 
earned as many admirers for its simplicity 
and tense excitement as it did 
detractors for encouraging gameplay 
so heavily rooted in luck.

Stuﬀed Fables doesn’t shy away from Hawthorne’s 
love of rolling dice. In fact, it ratchets up the element of 
randomness even further with a second layer of luck, 
as players pull ﬁve colour-coded dice from a blind bag 
of 35. Te colours of the dice dictate what that player 
can do on their turn – move, attack, use abilities and 
so on – and are rolled in a similar manner to Mice & 
Mystics to decide the level of success.
“One of the things that I found restrictive after I had 
designed Mice & Mystics was working within the use of 
those dice, the custom dice, and working with a limited 
amount of tiles for telling stories,” Hawthorne recalls. 
“So when I was creating this game, I tried to create the 
most open-ended and ﬂexible system possible.”
Te designer is adamant that combining two random 
elements doesn’t overdo the reliance on chance – “I like 
dice and I like luck games, so I’m not afraid of that sort 
of thing,” he asserts – but adds that there will be ways for 
players to help recover from less fortunate draws and 
rolls by swapping dice with their teammates.
“We have all these little gizmos in the game that are 
all about co-operating together by sharing dice and 
making sure you optimise the way that your team uses 
all of the dice you have available to you, keeping track 
of how many dice have been used up and what’s going 
to be available and what you anticipate pulling out of 
the bag,” Hawthorne details.
“All that stuﬀ really works well, especially with a 
wide variety of ages playing the game. It’s fun and 
pretty intuitive. Once you learn how to play it, it’s not 
like you’re going to have to go back and relearn how to 
play each time you sit down to play because it really is 
a simple and pretty elegant ruleset.”
Hawthorne believes that using dice rolls is central 
to both Mice & Mystics and Stuﬀed Fables’ appeal to 
adults and children alike, allowing every player – no 
matter their experience – to be subject to the same 
strokes of good fortune and ill fate.
“When you’re designing for a wide variety of gaming 
skill levels and a wide variety of ages, luck is your great 
leveller; it really evens things out,” he states. “I think 
that everybody will probably, depending on their luck 
tolerance, ﬁnd within this system ways to maximise 
your capabilities without being too luck-dependent.”
Tat’s not to say that skill won’t play a part. Another 
major modiﬁcation from Mice & Mystics is the concept 
of levelling up, which in the squeaky fantasy game 
was handled with the ‘cheese system’; speciﬁc die 
results would grant players crumbs of cheese that 
could be consumed to perform special abilities or 
level up. Minions had their own cheese wheel, which 
could trigger extra waves of enemies and advanced 
the timer for each scenario. Stuﬀed Fables strips back 
some of this light roleplaying dressing for a sense of 
progression that keeps the players right at its centre.
“Te idea that I’m working with is that because of 
the way that the dice and stuﬀ work in the game, as you 
get better at playing the game, you’ll be able to handle

more and more challenges,” Hawthorne says. “So 
there’s nothing mechanical really; it all basically relies 
upon the players getting better at co-operating with 
each other and better at optimising their choices. It’s 
not really all about getting the best gear or levelling-up 
or anything like that. Tere’s nothing really like that 
in the game; you just level-up basically by becoming 
better at playing the game.”
A FAMILY AFFAIR
While its world of adventuring animals aligns closer 
with classic fantasy such as Dungeons & Dragons, Lord 
of the Rings or, perhaps most of all, Brian Jacques’ 
Redwall novels (“I love Redwall!” Hawthorne conﬁrms 
when the comparison is mentioned), Hawthorne recalls 
that the key inspiration for Mice & Mystics actually 
came from a place many may not expect – Pixar’s 2004 
animated superhero movie, Te Incredibles.
“What I loved about Te Incredibles was that you 
had this family and they’re superheroes, but they’re a 
superhero family,” he enthuses. “Each member of that 
family had a superpower that also kind of matched 
their typical role in the household; so the father was 
strong, the mother was ﬂexible, the daughter just wants 
to disappear and the little boy’s just a handful running 
around all of the place. I thought, ‘Wouldn’t it be great 
if you could have a co-operative game where a family 
could work together as a team using their own special 
powers and accomplish missions that basically were 
based on family virtues?’ Tat’s how I started to design 
Mice & Mystics, the mechanics behind it.”
With the game’s basic feel beginning to take shape, it 
was another precious moment spent with his children 
that led Hawthorne to develop the storytelling focus 
and magical world that would come to deﬁne Mice & 
Mystics as a modern family gaming staple.
“My daughter was struggling with reading at the 
time – she was young and learning how to read and we 
were really concerned about her,” Hawthorne recalls. 
“So I thought, ‘Okay, I’m just going to make a game, 
I’m going to use this family thing because that will 
draw everyone in my household in, and I’m going to 
make reading a big part of the game.’ I wanted to break 
up the reading with game, so that she could have it in 
smaller chunks. Ten I made it about mice, because 
mice were her favourite thing at the time. So that’s how 
Mice & Mystics turned out.”
As he begun to sketch out his ideas for Stuﬀed Fables, 
Hawthorne found himself inspired by another Pixar 
movie, 2015’s Inside Out, which represented the clashing 
emotions of a young girl as distinct characters living 
inside her head – Joy, Sadness, Anger, Fear and Disgust.
“You get to watch how emotions work, it’s kind of 
like a model on how the human emotional spectrum 
works,” the designer says. “Each of those characters 
was colour-coded, I noticed, so I thought, ‘Oh wow, 
wouldn’t this be a cool way to gamify something, to

“Tat morphed into Stuﬀed Fables, where each of 
the stuﬀed animals basically represents an aspect of 
this little girl’s personality. Tey’re colour-coded and 
they work with the diﬀerent-coloured dice that are in 
the game.”
To reﬂect each Stuﬃe’s individual nature and the 
role they play in the young girl’s psyche, the characters 
have the ability to re-roll a single colour of dice during 
the game as an ‘always-on’ talent. 
“Te coloured dice match the character attributes,” 
explains Hawthorne. “So if you’re playing the little lion, 
he’s always angry all the time and he’s really good at 
ﬁghting, so he gets to re-roll the dice that’s connected 
to ﬁghting: red dice. So he’s much better at combat 
than the other Stuﬃes.”
More powerful are so-called ‘heart’ abilities, which 
reinforce the game’s kid-friendly preaching of peace, 
love and understanding and tie into the wider lore and 
enchanted wonder of the universe.
“Inside each little stuﬀed animal is a plastic heart 
that was placed there by the great manufacturer,” 
Hawthorne narrates. “When all those stuﬀed animal 
heroes are in this other world, doing good deeds ﬁlls 
that little heart with love energy, and that love energy 
is how they power up their special abilities. So we have 
this sort of system where you are encouraged to be 
charitable and to help out the needy little broken lost 
toys in this other world. By doing so, you power up 
your superpower and become more powerful. It’s all 
based upon merit.”
With a more moralising tone than most board 
games and its creator’s aﬃnity for creating 
memorable moments between parents and children 
(as well as groups of adults absorbed by inventive 
fantasy), Stuﬀed Fables – like Mice & Mystics before it – 
begins to blur the line with the literary and cinematic 
works inspiring Hawthorne.
“I’m a parent and I have a couple of kids at home, 
so I kind of put a lot of the things that are important 
to me into my games,” he says. “I just really love 
getting together with my kids, watching movies 
and stuﬀ like that, and those ideas come to me in 
the form of stories that I basically gamify, so that if 
families want to they can sit down and play through 
an experience that’s similar to reading a book or 
seeing a movie.”
GAMES FOR THE SOUL
More than half a decade on from Mice & Mystics, 
Hawthorne is still searching for ways to tell his tales 
on the tabletop. Stuﬀed Fables is the latest destination 
along that journey, but its designer doesn’t see the 
game as bringing a close to his last tale just yet. If 
anything, it’s simply a new chapter.
“I don’t look at it as an end for Mice & Mystics,” 
Hawthorne insists. “It might be an evolution. If you’re 
able to play Mice & Mystics inside of a storybook like 
this, the variety of experiences would be amazing. 
I would love to bring this book concept to Mice & 
Mystics. I think that everybody would respond to that 
quite well, being able to play inside of a book. It’s really 
pretty cool.”

Even Stuﬀed Fables may prove to be just the middle 
chapter of Hawthorne’s ongoing hunt for captivating 
yarns spun through a pattern of play.
“I don’t currently have any plans to do a sequel 
to Stuﬀed Fables,” he reveals. “I’ve had some people 
already asking if I’m going to do one where the 
central character is a little boy so you can get a little 
boy’s perspective. I have no plans right now for that. 
I’m more in the moment right now and not trying 
to plan out too far, because I think that I can create 
better games if I keep my mind on what I’m working 
on right now.”
Yet, having found the ideal format to mirror his own 
melding together of gaming and storytelling, Hawthorne 
is keen to experiment further – perhaps even going 
beyond the realms of fairytales and childhood.
“Once you learn how this game system works, you 
could pick up and play an AdventureBook game in any 
setting and the mechanics would have the ﬂexibility 
to adapt to all of those settings,” he says. “You could be 
playing a space version of an AdventureBook game or 
even a dark theme or an adult theme, it doesn’t have to 
be always about stuﬀed animals or mice or whatever.”
As our conversation draws to a close, Hawthorne 
begins to tell an anecdote that captures his own 
absolute desire – to not only tell stories, but to 
emotionally move players to the point where the 
experience of  playing his games become stories to be 
told themselves.
“I was on an airplane one time and I was sitting next 
to a lady and she was reading a book she was almost 
ﬁnished with,” he begins. “On the other side of me 
was somebody who was doing a sudoku puzzle. Te 
woman ﬁnished her book and she leaned back and her 
eyes got ﬁlled with tears and she just clutched the book 
to her chest. Te experience was obviously emotionally 
moving for her. Te other person ﬁnished up their 
sudoku puzzle and they curled up their newspaper 
and put it away. I thought to myself: ‘A year from now, 
who’s going to remember this plane ﬂight? Is it going 
to be the lady who read the book, or is it going to be 
the person who played the sudoku puzzle?’ Sudoku is a 
rewarding experience, but can you remember your last 
sudoku puzzle? Does it stick out in your mind? But you 
remember the last book you read or the last emotional 
experience you had, or the last great exciting game that 
you played.
“While both of them bring enjoyment into our lives, 
I want my games to be more like the books that have an 
indelible impact on your soul.”

TERRA MYSTICA
Words by Matt Jarvis
Come explore an ever-changing fantasy landscape where a medley 
of races must adapt the terrain around them and jostle with their 
neighbours to grow their home – but there’s little room for luck
January 2018
N
o matter how big the fantasy world, 
it’s inevitable that its inhabitants 
will eventually begin to rub up 
against each other. From Tolkien’s 
tension between elves and 
dwarves to the interfamilial conﬂicts of A Song 
of Ice & Fire, much of fantasy’s greatest drama 
springs from the classic gripe of not getting along 
with your neighbours.
Terra Mystica places this tension right at its 
heart, constructing an intense strategy game 
around the idea of several factions trying to 
carve out their own place in the world. Players 
are able to pick from more than a dozen 
diﬀerent races, from mermaids and witches to 
fakirs and giants, each of which has their own 
distinct personality and abilities.
With luck all but absent from the way players 
are able to expand their territory and advance 
their civilisation, Terra Mystica becomes a game 
of pure strategy and competition between the 
rival groups – and the players controlling them.
Te intricate but tight mechanics and depth 
involved in mastering each of the 14 peoples 
has led the 2012 title to become one of the 
most acclaimed strategy board games of all 
time – a success story that its recent sci-ﬁ 
sequel no doubt hopes to repeat.
WHAT’S IT ALL ABOUT?
Although its denizens drive the action of the 
game forward, it’s actually the land of Terra 
Mystica itself that’s the star of the show.
You see, the terrain of the world isn’t the 
most hospitable to begin with. Each of the races 
starts on one of seven home landscapes – desert, 
plains, swamp, lake, forest, mountain and 
wasteland – they’ve already adjusted to survive 
on, but they’ll need to adapt to take spread their 
H AV E  Y O U  P L AY E D ?

rule across more of the land. More speciﬁcally, 
they’ll need to adapt the terrain; each faction is 
able to terraform an unoccupied space to their 
home landscape by paying a varying amount 
of spades depending on the starting type and 
their unique transformation cycle. To cross and 
traverse rivers to travel even further across the 
world, the sides will need to develop their ability 
to use boats or (literally) build bridges.
Once a plot has been made habitable, a 
faction can build a dwelling on it, which can 
later be upgraded to a trading house, temple, 
sanctuary or stronghold to increase their 
income of coins, power or priests. Victory 
points are partially awarded for having the 
largest connected areas on the map and 
players’ progress along four cult tracks, 
representing their advancement in the worship 
of earth, ﬁre, water and air, which can also 
grant some bonuses at the end of each round.
HOW DO YOU PLAY?
Designed by Jens Drogemuller and Helge 
Ostertag, with help from Agricola, Patchwork 
and A Feast for Odin mastermind Uwe 
Rosenberg, Terra Mystica features no direct 
conﬂict between players but masters the 
passive-aggressive competition of the 
Eurogame genre. 
Each turn consists of a simple set of 
actions that quickly gain complexity as the 
claustrophobic feel of the map takes eﬀect, 
forcing players to carefully consider every 
move and the potential beneﬁts it could hand 
to their rivals.
As they say: keep your friends close, but 
your enemies closer. In Terra Mystica, this 
has real gameplay beneﬁts. Players can gain 
extra power when an opponent builds next to 
their existing structures and it costs more to 
upgrade a dwelling next to another building, 
making staying in close proximity to your 
rivals very beneﬁcial indeed.
Placing a group of four structures of the same 
colour next to each other forms a town, which 
grants extra victory points, other rewards and the 
chance to advance to the ﬁnal space on a cult 
track – which is only accessible by the ﬁrst player 
to do so. Creating sacred structures also presents 
the chance to collect favour tiles, which boost 
that side’s standing with a particular cult 
and might also unlock a special ability.
Players can improve up their 
standing further by utilising a 
selection of bonus cards selected 
when moving between rounds, 
which can gain extra victory 
points or resources once a 
player ﬁnishes their actions 
for the turn – with those who 
pass earlier getting to pick their 
bonus for the following round ﬁrst.
Each of the 14 races’ unique powers and 
starting habitats is key to its strategy – 
and players’ victory
Although terraforming spaces and establishing 
buildings to build up their resources is the core 
of Terra Mystica, players are aided by several 
special abilities that increase their capability 
to conquer the map. Each faction has a special 
power unlocked once a stronghold has been 
constructed, allowing them to gather bonus 
points or changing the standard rules in other 
interesting ways to propel them towards victory.
NOT ENOUGH SPACE
Five years after Terra Mystica was released, a 
follow-up to the game was announced. Gaia 
Project takes the terraforming concepts that 
drive the gameplay and blasts them into outer 
space, expanding the idea of civilisations looking 
to spread their presence to an entire galaxy of 
planets instead of a single world.
In a major change to the way players must 
transform potential new homes, the board is 
made up of ten (seven in the two-player game) 
modular sector tiles that create a diﬀerent layout 
in every match.
Tere’s another 14 unique factions from 
players to choose from, too, which are once 
again equipped with special abilities and 
bonuses to help them colonise the universe. 
To help them further, the various sides can 
advance six diﬀerent types of technology 
– terraforming, navigation, AI, economy, 
research and gaiaforming – making it easier for 
them to travel further across the system, gather 
resources, increase their scientiﬁc knowledge 
or terraform a wider variety of planets 
Some of the worlds are known as ‘transdim’ 
planets, strange worlds that can’t be built 
upon but can be harnessed for their resources. 
To access the worlds, players must begin a 
Gaia Project, which grants them the chance to 
utilise gaiaformers to transform the transdim 
planet into a gaia planet.
Created by Drogemuller and Ostertag 
and said to be a ‘spiritual successor’ to Terra 
Mystica, Gaia Project oﬀers a whole new way 
to enjoy the head-to-head empire-builder 
without changing its heart.
WHY SHOULD I TRY IT?
Terra Mystica is an endlessly replayable 
strategy gem that shines due to its 
combination of luckless strategy and 
asymmetrical player abilities.
Every match feels unique as the diﬀerent 
opposing factions lock horns, but the gameplay 
has been ﬁnely tuned to ensure that each race 
has an equal chance of victory in the right hands.
If the basic game wasn’t enough of a puzzle to 
be solved, the game’s ﬁrst expansion, Fire & Ice, 
adds another six factions to the mix – including 
two that really shake things up by changing the 
rules even more.
Although the game’s complexity, length and 
variability between races can be imposing for 
ﬁrst-time players, the payoﬀ is more than worth 
the eﬀort. Tere are also digital versions of the 
game available on mobile and PC that include 
a handy interactive tutorial and the ability to 
play against diﬀerent computer diﬃculties and 
review your moves to help you develop and 
improve your play style with even less eﬀort.
Half a decade on, Terra Mystica remains one 
of the ﬁnest strategy experiences on the tabletop. 
With Gaia Project taking the brilliant gameplay 
one step further, it seems that Drogemuller and 
Ostertag’s creation will remain a ﬁrm favourite 
for years to come.

KICKSTARTING
somewhere in the low thousands of pounds), and it’s a 
decision a lot of tabletop games go for.
But projects whose creators go for a homemade 
video are often either made by people with at least a 
little skill at creating video – which isn’t us – or they’re 
for games firmly aimed at a definite hobbyist market. 
They’re promoting their project to people who’ve 
backed games on Kickstarter before, people who 
understand how this whole process works and who are 
excited to find new interesting work to support.
In the case of Art Deck, we obviously want to 
involve that audience, but it may be more immediately 
appealing to people who want a party game, or 
something to play with their kids, or even something 
to use to get themselves to start drawing. People 
who may have never backed a game on Kickstarter 
before. To draw these potential players in, to get them 
watching the video and to make it clear that we’re 
able to deliver on our promises, needs a higher level 
of polish. So it’s probably worth gritting our teeth and 
paying for a professional – even if that does mean we’re 
paying money that we won’t be able to recoup if the 
Kickstarter fails.  
So that’s where we are now: planning a video, talking 
to people who might make it and trying to get the rest 
of the game to the point where we actually can film it. 
Working on draft designs for the cards, getting a couple 
of decks printed, making any last-minute rule tweaks.
It’s all getting very real. And that’s making us think 
about something we’ve been unconsciously trying 
to avoid for the last couple of months – the sneaking 
suspicion that ‘Art Deck’ is maybe... not a good name. 
That it might, in fact, even be... a bad name. It’s 
certainly not a very memorable name; even our friends 
are sometimes pretty vague on what the game’s called. 
(In the last few weeks people have tried “Art Game”, 
“Art Cards”, “That Drawing Game of Yours” and “You 
Know, That Thing You Made Where Anna Hid Under 
The Table”.)
We’re both just really, really bad at naming 
things – I mean, we run a company called Matheson 
Marcault, a name which people can’t successfully 
spell, pronounce or remember. So maybe we should 
just stick with the pretty bad name we’ve got, content 
that it could be so much worse. Or maybe it’s time for 
a last-minute rebrand... 
A
s we get ready to fill in our Kickstarter 
page, slowly edging towards the point 
where we can hit the big launch button 
on our project, we’ve got some tough 
decisions to make. Some of these are 
design decisions. Some of them are about our target 
audience; do we stress the party game aspect of Art 
Deck, its possibilities as a creativity tool or its function 
as critical commentary on 1970s instructional artwork? 
(Probably not that last one!) Some of the decisions are 
about what we’re offering backers, and how elaborate 
we want to get with our reward levels.
Some of the scariest choices are about how much 
money to spend upfront, before we even know whether 
the campaign is going to succeed.
One of the biggest tasks before we can launch – and 
one of the biggest possible expenses – is the campaign 
video. You know the sort of thing: a video where we 
show a moment from Art Deck, explain how it works 
and then try to let people know why we think they 
might want to support the game. 
We could make something ourselves. It wouldn’t 
be great, but we could put something together that 
explains the game and shows a bit of gameplay. It 
would save money (a professional video would cost

enuinely new ideas are rare 
in gaming. Designers take 
inspiration from one another’s 
work and riﬀ oﬀ of existing 
concepts, tweaking and tinkering 
to develop new spins on what others have 
done before. 2008’s Dominion is an exception. 
It created the concept of a deckbuilding 
game, where players craft a deck of cards as 
they play.
It’s proved massively inﬂuential, with a host 
of creators incorporating its novel approach 
into their own designs but, a decade after its 
release, Dominion remains one of the most 
popular games in the hobby.
I spoke to its designer, Donald X. Vaccarino, 
about the game’s development, its success and 
what its future might hold.
BUILDING BLOCKS
“I made games even as a kid,” Vaccarino says. 
“But I didn’t really start making lots of games 
until 1995, inspired by Magic: Te Gathering; 
I was really grabbed by the idea of interacting 
rules on cards. But, while I played lots of 
Magic, the idea for Dominion didn’t come 
from there.”
“I was working on a game called Spirit 
Warriors II, where each player would have 
a deck representing their party of fantasy 
heroes, à la Dungeons & Dragons. Each hero 
was represented by ten cards and you shuﬄed 
them together to make your deck.”
He worked enthusiastically on the idea, but 
soon saw that his design had some problems.
“I realised that the math involved would 
be too hard,” he says. “You’d be looking at a 
card in your hand; it’s a card for your ranger, 
it deals two damage per level of bow skill. 
What’s his bow skill? It’s three, so that’s six 
damage. Now remember that number and 
look at the next card in your hand, a card for 
your paladin, and his sword skill is…
“You’d look back and forth and back and 
forth remembering numbers, and at the end 
maybe you didn’t even decide to ﬁght. It 
didn’t seem like it would work.”
Undeterred, Vaccarino worked to simplify 
his design. Along the way he came up with a 
concept that seemed intriguing.
“I really wanted to be building up my 
party,” he says. “I hit on the idea of having 
you build the deck as the game went on – 
when your ranger levels up, you get a new 
card for him, better than his previous cards.”
Te approach allowed players to 
incrementally improve their characters with 
each passing turn, starting the game with a 
handful of low-powered cards and gradually 
upping the quality of their decks as their 
inexperienced adventurers grew into battle-
hardened warriors. While it ﬁrst came to 
Vaccarino as an element of a more complex 
design, he suspected that the idea could 
stand on its own.
“I realised that I could make a game out 
of just that with none of the other pieces,” he 
said. “Just building a deck.
“I jotted down some notes on it, then 
went back to Spirit Warriors II. Months later 
I needed a game quickly for a game night, 
and Spirit Warriors II still needed tons of 
work, but the simple deckbuilding game was 
something I could just whip out. So I did.”
Te basic side project would go on to 
become Dominion, dropping the original 
D&D-inspired theme and instead casting 
players as aspirational monarchs competing 
to build thriving kingdoms. As they played, 
they added cards to their deck to generate 
victory points or to take a variety of actions 
– drawing extra cards, forcing opponents to

discard some of theirs, removing weak cards 
from a deck to improve the odds of drawing 
more useful ones. It allowed for a variety of 
tactical approaches that evolved in diﬀerent 
ways over the course of every game, and it 
proved to be an instant hit with Vaccarino’s 
game group.
“Dominion took over all of our 
gaming,” he says. “I had a 
Magic night and a game 
night; they both turned 
into Dominion nights, 
with extra Dominion on 
the side.
“I had made the 
game on the weekend 
and put it out on the 
kitchen table. For all I 
knew it wouldn’t work at all. But it was good 
times, and we were enthusiastic about playing 
another game immediately. And, I mean, 
that was that for years to come; the game of 
choice was Dominion. A few months later I 
made a couple of new games, and my friends 
just were not interested in trying them. Trying 
something new would cut into Dominion time. 
So, I made more expansions instead.”
Vaccarino and his friends experimented 
with diﬀerent strategies, discovering the 
power of diﬀerent card combinations and the 
importance of stripping out less eﬀective cards 
from their decks. As they played, Vaccarino 
made changes to the design, removing cards 
that didn’t work as he’d hoped. But he says 
the ﬁnal result wasn’t far removed from his 
original idea.
“If you’d played the game shortly after 
I made it, and then again when it was 
published, you’d have had trouble ﬁguring out 
the diﬀerences,” he says.
WORLD DOMINATION
Encouraged by his friends’ enthusiasm, 
Vaccarino decided to approach publishers 
with his design. He struck a deal with Rio 
Grande Games, whose previous releases 
included English-language versions of 
European games like Power Grid and Puerto 
Rico. His experience with his own game group 
had left him conﬁdent 
that Dominion 
could be a similarly 
successful hit.
“I wasn’t conﬁdent 
I could get the game 
published,” he said. 
“But I was sure that 
if I did, it would 
eventually have a shelf 
to itself in game stores. I had already had the 
experience of a group of gamers switching to 
nothing but Dominion, so the fact that people 
became big fans was not surprising.”
Strategic card games were already a mainstay 
of analogue gaming, with Magic and its 
competitors creating communities of players

around the globe. But where the likes of 
Pokémon or the gothic Vampire: Te Eternal 
Struggle required players to trade or buy new 
cards to build their collections, Dominion 
oﬀered a similar experience in a single, 
self-contained game. It met with a massively 
enthusiastic reaction from players and, in 2009, 
won the tabletop industry’s most coveted prize: 
the Spiel des Jahres or ‘Game of the Year’ award.
“I didn’t think I had a shot, even after 
it was nominated, just due to Dominion’s 
complexity,” says Vaccarino. “And I think they 
added the more complex game category [the 
Kennerspiel des Jahres or ‘Expert Game of the 
Year’] later because they ended up deciding 
Dominion was too complex after all.”
Fans were hungry for more, and Vaccarino 
had more to give them. Years before Dominion 
had been published, he had already begun 
work on expansions that added new cards to 
the mix. Te ﬁrst, Intrigue, could be played 
as a standalone game or combined with the 
original set to support up to eight players. Te 
next, Seaside, experimented with the game’s 
turn structure, adding cards that played 
out their eﬀects over multiple rounds. Later 
additions gave players new ways to score 
points or to use resource cards, opening up 
fresh strategies to explore.
Vaccarino says he became more adept 
at designing expansions over time, with 
players’ reactions helping to guide the game’s 
ongoing development.
“I feel like I got a lot better as I went along,” 
he says. “Te early sets have the most duds 
because I wasn’t as good at the game. We 
would have a card sometimes and that would 
be enough for me. I wouldn’t play around 
with it and ask, ‘Could I make it stronger? How 
does it compare to other cards?’
“I got feedback from players. Tey didn’t 
like how some cards didn’t have resources, 
they just attacked opponents. I stopped 
making those. Tey liked attacks in general 
less than I’d expected. Later sets have fewer 
attacks, more non-attack interaction.
“Te Alchemy expansion was too slow. I 
hadn’t realised that until it was out. I started 
paying more attention to avoiding cards being 
slow to resolve. With Hinterlands I went too far 
in trying to dredge the last ounce of playability 
out of each card. It’s better to have simpler 
cards that are a little strong or weak. I’ve tried 
not to make that mistake since.”
Tis self-criticism might seem harsh given 
the game’s ongoing popularity, but it’s left its 
designer with a ﬁrm perspective on how best 
to grow the card pool.
“At this point the big challenge is trying to 
keep complexity down,” he says. “You run 
out of simple things to do, but it’s bad to get 
complex. It’s ﬁne if strategy is complex, but 
not if the cards are.”
OFTEN COPIED, 
NEVER EQUALLED
While Dominion is a highlight of Vaccarino’s 
design career, it’s not the only one. In 2011 
he released Kingdom Builder, a simple but 
thoughtful board game that, like his previous 
hit, cast players as rulers looking to expand 
their domains. Players would draw a card 
from a communal deck corresponding 
to diﬀerent types of terrain on the board, 
claiming territory and aiming to seize areas 
that best met the needs of their subjects – from 
miners and ﬁshermen looking for mountains 
and rivers to hermits seeking remote spots 
removed from civilisation.
“It started out trying to be a Dominion 
spin-oﬀ,” says Vaccarino. “You played cards to 
take over spaces on the board, and took over 
spaces to gain cards. I eventually cut out the 
deckbuilding and replaced it with drawing a 
card and putting three pieces on that type of 
terrain. Te deckbuilding part just didn’t seem 
essential; it was just there to be there.”
Te game earned him his second Spiel 
des Jahres, making Vaccarino one of a select 
handful of designers to win the accolade more 
than once. While he’s pleased to have one of 
the industry’s biggest recent hits to his name, 
he’s also glad to have received recognition for 
other games.

“A big eﬀect of Dominion on my career 
is that it’s meant I’ve spent years making 
Dominion expansions instead of new games,” 
he says. “Dominion winning was great, 
obviously. But it didn’t just make publishers 
want to publish my games. I still had trouble 
even getting games looked at. It was after 
Kingdom Builder won that publishers said: 
‘Okay, show us something.’”
Vaccarino continues to work on new 
Dominion expansions, although he says he plans 
to reduce the pace of his work on the game to 
allow him to devote time to other projects.
While the game still boasts a large and 
enthusiastic community of players, it’s also 
inspired other designers to come up with their 
own spin on its deckbuilding premise. For 
Vaccarino, though, many of the games that 
followed in Dominion’s trail haven’t done enough 
to distinguish themselves from his original design.
“I always say that it’s great that people got 
to make Dominion-inspired games, and sad 
what most people decided to do with the 
privilege,” he says. “Tere are all these games 
that don’t add much to Dominion. I don’t look 
at those games so much because I don’t want 
anyone thinking I copied whatever Dominion 
mechanic from a Dominion clone.
“Tere are actual new games inspired by 
Dominion. Two examples I always cite are A 
Few Acres of Snow and Eminent Domain. But I 
mostly haven’t played them.”
While he thinks some deckbuilding 
games are a little too close to Dominion for 
comfort, a recent development is far more 
straightforwardly problematic. Counterfeit 
copies have started to appear online, with 
unscrupulous manufacturers pirating the 
game in its entirety. But while you might 
expect the designer to be furious at having 
his work ripped oﬀ, Vaccarino doesn’t let it 
bother him.
“Most games don’t make any money, and 
so won’t be counterfeited,” he says. “If your 
game is such a hit that it’s being counterfeited, 
it’s also making you good money. Making less 
money, when you’re making good money; like, 
it’s not what you want, but how much does it 
really aﬀect your life?”
He plans to keep working on expansions 
for the game, he says, but he’d also like to 
work on new spin-oﬀs and unrelated titles. 
With keeping Dominion fresh for players 
taking up so much of his time, could he ever 
see himself passing on responsibility to other 
designers, just as long-running games like 
Magic have passed through the hands of 
many diﬀerent creators?
“No,” he says simply. “I don’t see someone 
else taking over.”

HOW WE MADE
HOW WE MADE
HOW WE MADE
ARCTIC SCAVENGERS
Where Dominion cast players as wealthy 
nobles, Arctic Scavengers adopts a much 
bleaker tone, with bands of survivors 
struggling to eke out an existence in a 
frozen, post-apocalyptic wasteland. Players 
aim to build powerful tribes, recruiting 
characters with specialised skills and 
scouring the remnants of civilisation for 
precious supplies and equipment. 
A FEW ACRES OF SNOW
Part of a trio of deckbuilding games from 
designer Martin Wallace, this two-player 
war game recreates clashes between 
French and British colonial forces in 
North America. You’ll gain new cards by 
capturing territory and strengthening your 
hold on the continent. Wallace developed 
the game’s mechanisms further in the 
fantasy follow-up Mythotopia and space 
conquest game A Handful of Stars. 
TRAINS 
Deckbuilding board game Trains puts you 
and your friends in the shoes of Japanese 
railway company directors. You’ll use your 
cards to acquire locomotives and lay down 
tracks, hoping to build a system that’s 
as eﬃcient and dependable as the real 
Japanese rail network... as opposed to the 
British one.
STAR REALMS
Designed by two former Magic: The 
Gathering pro players, Star Realms 
distilled the deckbuilding experience to 
a one-on-one showdown, with players 
controlling galactic empires ﬁghting to 
dominate the universe. It’s a slick, simple 
and addictive take on the formula, and 
if you don’t have any opponents handy, 
there’s a well-executed smartphone app 
with a busy community of online players.
DICE MASTERS
Dice Masters takes the core ideas behind 
Dominion and swaps cards for custom-
made dice representing characters from 
a variety of pop-culture universes. While 
the ﬁrst Dice Masters sets featured 
characters from Marvel comics, the 
game has expanded to incorporate DC 
characters like Batman and Wonder 
Woman as well as ﬁgures from Yu-Gi-
Oh!, Dungeons & Dragons and Teenage 
Mutant Ninja Turtles.
MYSTIC VALE 
Where most deckbuilding games 
challenge players to create a customised 
deck, Mystic Vale takes things one 
step further, letting them build their 
own individual cards. Using a system of 
modular transparent cards that slide 
into plastic sleeves, it allows players to 
combine multiple powerful eﬀects on a 
single card. It also comes with a blackjack-
style push-your-luck element, where 
players can draw additional cards, but at 
the risk of unleashing corrupting magic 
that could cost them the game.

Te number of counterfeit games being sold online to unwilling fans is rising. 
With players increasingly at risk of shoddy-quality and even dangerous 
versions of their favourite titles, we look into the dark world of tabletop forgery
Words by Matt Jarvis | Illustration by Sam Richwood

tabletopgaming.co.uk
“A 
bout eight months ago we started 
to get all of these customer 
services requests. People picking 
up the phone saying, ‘Hi, I 
bought a Ticket to Ride from 
Amazon, the cards are all rubbish, I’m missing ﬁve 
black trains and the board doesn’t lay ﬂat.’”
At ﬁrst, Steve Buckmaster says, it was assumed 
that the copies of Days of Wonder’s iconic train game 
were normal outliers from the production process. 
Esdevium, the dominant UK distributor of which 
Buckmaster is MD, began to send out replacement 
parts for the incomplete sets, as it would with any 
other game missing pieces. Still, something didn’t 
sit quite right – a feeling reinforced by the growing 
number of complaints about a title usually known for 
its high standard of quality. Tree or four months later, 
overwhelmed by requests, Esdevium decided to look 
into the matter. It seemed that one of its most popular 
games had fallen prey to cheap forgeries being sold 
online via third-party sellers, with unsuspecting 
buyers unaware that their copy was an unoﬃcial fake.
Very quickly, it became 
clear that it was an issue 
far beyond Ticket to 
Ride. Sales of some of 
the industry’s biggest 
games have become 
ﬂooded by fakes as part 
of what Buckmaster 
describes as an “endemic” 
counterfeiting problem. Especially at risk are titles 
that had become staple games for introducing 
new players to hobby gaming because of their 
accessible gameplay and simple components – 
factors that now made them easier to duplicate.
“Games that have relatively simple card 
components in particular – Dominion being a great 
example – where it’s just printing cards, it’s relatively 
straightforward for someone to counterfeit,” 
Buckmaster says. “Tey need the print ﬁles and 
the ability to make cards – which most factories 
will have – then they just need to make boxes and 
plastic inserts, which again most factories will be 
able to do. Oﬀ they go on their merry way making 
a counterfeit version of the game. So I think the 
criteria for a target to counterfeit is that the game 
has got to be a relative perennial. 
“What we would consider the stable gateway 
games of this industry – Ticket to Ride, Catan, 
Pandemic, Dominion – have a good level of sales, 
yet they come from relatively small publishers 
that are going to struggle to be able to take the 
action required to try and get counterfeiters shut 
down. It’s a real challenge for our time.”
Partly to blame for the surge in forgeries is 
gaming’s boom in mainstream popularity over the 
last few years, with multi-million-dollar Kickstarters 
and consistently rising sales attracting both genuine 
and illegitimate attempts to cash in on the tabletop’s 
golden age. Te biggest enabling factor has been 
the internet; while crowdfunding has made it 
easier than ever before for creators to ﬁnd a global 
audience for their otherwise niche projects, the 
online removal of worldwide barriers has turned 
counterfeiting into an international issue.
“Right now we’re dealing with signiﬁcant 
counterfeiting coming out of the Far East and, no 
matter what we do, it’s very hard to contain because 
the internet and online commerce has made it able to 
reach far and wide and deep and it’s hard to ﬁgure out 
exactly where the nexus of all that stuﬀ is originating,” 
says Christian T. Petersen, CEO of Asmodee North 
America, the mega-publisher that owns studios such 
as Fantasy Flight, Z-Man Games and Plaid Hat.
Although the full extent to which counterfeits are 
pervading the market remains currently unclear due 
to some companies refusing to release their data, 
Asmodee’s internal ﬁgures suggest that up to 60% 
of all online sales for some games are now fakes.
“We’re able to do a bunch of data analysis online 
and we can also compare year-over-year numbers 
and look at the sellers actually selling the product,” 
Petersen explains. “A product like – just as an example 
– 7 Wonders may have been aﬀected more than 60%.”
“We’ve been told that counterfeit games have 
dramatically increased recently,” observes Richard 
Lee, COO of major game manufacturer Panda. 
“Scanning and printing technology has improved by a 
large amount and has become much less expensive as 
well, which has led to more counterfeiting activities.”
Scott Tepper of Dominion, Race for the Galaxy 
and Roll for the Galaxy outlet Rio Grande Games 
echoes that the overall scale of counterfeiting is still 
being looked into by the publisher, but suggests 
less of an impact on its aﬀected games. 
“We are still investigating the extent to which the 
recent counterfeit Dominions reached the US market,” 
he says. “In comparison with our total sales, the 
percentage of counterfeits that we believe have recently 
appeared is a small percentage of our total sales.”
Wizards of the Coast, the Hasbro-owned 
publisher responsible for Dungeons & Dragons, 
Magic: Te Gathering and wargame studio Avalon 
Hill, concurs that it has experienced counterfeiting, 
but adds that – at least from what it has seen –fake 
games still remain the exception.
“We take counterfeiting very seriously,” a 
representative for the company tells us. “While we 
can’t comment on speciﬁc anti-counterfeiting tactics 
or investigations, we can say that we occasionally 
learn of small quantities of counterfeit Wizards of the 
Coast games being sold online. When this happens, 
we investigate. Our investigation team is second-to-
none in the gaming industry and works closely with 
our state, federal and international law enforcement 
partners to target and stop counterfeiters.”
DOING DAMAGE
Te targeting of gateway games by counterfeiters 
is particularly troublesome for publishers and 
distributors because of the players most likely to 
end up with a fake in their collection. Tere’s a good 
chance that committed gamers already own several 
of the entry-level titles aﬀected, or will see notices 
put out via social media, websites and newsletters 
concerning possible fakes. But a standard consumer 
picking up a hobby game for the ﬁrst time won’t 
necessarily be on the lookout.
“What we’re really 
worried about is somebody 
who’s possibly new to board 
games and, rightly so, going 
for something like Ticket to 
Ride, Pandemic or Catan as 
their ﬁrst or second board 
game purchase,” Buckmaster 
says. “They go online, buy 
the cheapest, get a counterfeit copy and go, ‘Ergh, 
this was a poor gaming experience,’ because they 
were missing components or the rules weren’t right 
because they’d been counterfeited.
“We are more concerned about the, dare I say it, 
mums and families; people that are new to board 
gaming in general being caught out by this. For 
hardcore alpha gamers that are buying a mixture of 
games on Kickstarter and on release and all that sort 
of stuﬀ, they’re probably safe at this moment in time.”
“If a counterfeit game happens to be the ﬁrst 
game that person has ever played, it could leave 
a bad taste in their mouth and keep them from 
trying other games,” agrees Panda’s Lee.
It’s not only players who can be put oﬀ gaming by 
dodgy copies. With many designers making a living 
through royalties earned on sales of their games, 
having their work copied without compensation 
can drastically impact their living. 
“Counterfeits cause damage on several levels,” says 
Tepper. “Te designer, who has done considerable 
work to create an exceptional game, does not receive 
the deserved royalties for the counterfeit copies.
“Damage is done to our brand when customers 
receive these inferior knockoﬀs and think that this low 
quality is representative of Rio Grande Games and then 
decide not to try any of the Dominion expansions.”
No matter what we do, 
it’s very hard to contain.

“Buying counterfeits only helps the 
counterfeiters – and takes money out of the pockets 
of the hard-working people who are creating 
the games,” agrees Shari Spiro, CEO of independent 
publisher Breaking Games and manufacturer Ad 
Magic, which has produced various games including 
Exploding Kittens and Cards Against Humanity.
“Whether or not the end consumer cares about 
whether a game designer gets their royalty on games, 
they’ve put their heart and soul into something, 
they created a game that’s going to be fantastic,” 
Buckmaster adds. “Tey’re obviously being cheated 
out of their income, 
which is the royalties they 
make on selling games. 
Which I suppose also 
impacts their ability to 
continue to develop 
games and do stuﬀ.”
In the most extreme 
of cases, fake board 
games can even pose 
a risk to the health of 
players by bypassing 
universal safety checks 
“Te world out there is not entirely aware of the 
enormous inﬂuence of counterfeiters online and how 
much stuff is actually not authentic and even potentially 
dangerous,” says Petersen. “Because we do, of course, 
a lot of testing on all our materials to make sure they’re 
[safety] compliant, vis-à-vis the poison in plastics, 
the lead paint on wood and so on and so forth. I can 
assure you that counterfeiters have no such testing.”
Buckmaster presents a speciﬁc example of one 
game aimed at children that had been found to 
lack the quality control of the oﬃcial product.
“We don’t even know if the counterfeit Dobble 
game can be played properly because it’s quite a 
mathematical game. It’s not enough to sit there and 
have some cards with symbols on, you actually 
have to have the exact right mix and it has to 
be a certain way. We have seen the counterfeit 
tins deform; we don’t know if they’ve been tested for 
harmful elements. As a genuine manufacturer, there’s 
quite strict safety testing that you have to do on your 
product to ensure it’s in no way going to be harmful.”
Tepper oﬀers a similarly frank warning.
“Te authentic Dominions and expansions are 
made in our partner factories in the US and in 
Europe,” he conﬁrms. “We are conﬁdent in their 
quality and safety for our customers. From what we 
have seen, the counterfeit copies have cheaper card 
stock for the cards and have inferior card trays which 
are ﬂimsy and break easily. We can only guess at 
the harm end users are exposing themselves to 
from the counterfeit copies as they are not made 
using the strict standards we use in our games.”
RETAIL WOES
Te majority of publishers we spoke to pointed the 
ﬁnger at Amazon’s third-party Marketplace and 
‘Fulﬁlled by Amazon’ programme – where third-party 
stock is stored and sent out of Amazon warehouses 
– for allowing online stores to freely oﬀer illegitimate 
copies of games, which are often misunderstood by 
buyers to be vouched for by the retail giant.
Buckmaster says that, in certain cases, direct 
sales of some Esdevium games through Amazon 
have been reduced by up to 80% of their usual level 
when a seller of counterfeits manages to get the ‘buy 
box’ – making them the default choice for customers 
that land on the page and hit the ‘Add to Basket’ button.
“Te way that Amazon is structured, most 
consumers make the assumption that if it’s fulﬁlled 
by Amazon, it must be ﬁne – this is unfortunately 
not always the case,” he says.
Although Amazon does remove counterfeit 
sellers when ﬂagged up by lawyers working on 
behalf of bigger studios, one major publisher that 
wished to remain anonymous told us that Amazon 
had been ‘diﬃcult’ and ‘slow’ to work with on the 
matter, allegedly taking up to a week to shut down 
some stores and going so far as to reinstate multiple 
third-party sellers accused of oﬀering counterfeit 
games when the claims had been contested. Multiple 
sources claimed that counterfeit sellers they had 
identiﬁed had later resurfaced under the guise of 
a diﬀerent store, allowing them to simply sell the 
products under a diﬀerent name. Tis reportedly even 
caused Amazon’s own sales of at least one popular 
game to ‘tank’, a source close to the matter said.
“Amazon prohibits the sale of inauthentic and 
fraudulent products,” an Amazon spokesperson told 
Tabletop Gaming in a statement. “We remove items 
in violation of our policies as soon as we become 
aware of them and block bad actors suspected of 
engaging in illegal behaviour, such as counterfeit.
“If merchants sell counterfeit goods, we may 
immediately suspend or terminate their selling 
privileges and destroy inventory 
in our fulﬁlment centres 
without reimbursement. In 
addition, if we determine that a 
seller account has been used to 
engage in fraud or other illegal 
activity, remittances and 
payments may be withheld. 
Te sale of counterfeit goods 
can also lead to legal action 
by rights holders and civil 
and criminal penalties.
“We are constantly innovating on behalf of 
our customers and working with manufacturers, 
content owners, vendors and sellers to improve 
the ways we detect and prevent counterfeit 
products from reaching our marketplace.”
Amazon does require that Marketplace sellers 
oﬀer a return policy equal to or better than its own 30-
day rule and oﬀer replacements for products found 
to not be as advertised within a “reasonable time”.
“As much as we’ve been struggling with 
Amazon, there is an element of accountability 
where you can go back and go: ‘Look, I think I’ve 
got something counterfeit,’” Buckmaster says.
Tat’s not the case with another online retail 
giant alleged to be oﬀering fake board games for 
sale: auction site eBay, which Buckmaster calls “a 
dog-eat-dog marketplace, basically”. Under the

platform’s rules, sellers are not required to oﬀer a 
returns policy, but eBay does oﬀer a Money Back 
Guarantee to reimburse users who receive an item 
that fails to match its listing description.
“Counterfeits are illegal and not welcome on any of 
eBay’s sites,” a spokesperson for eBay told us. “eBay is 
fully committed to combating the sale of counterfeit 
goods and has consistently been the internet industry 
leader in working to stop the online sale of counterfeit 
goods. eBay runs several anti-counterfeit initiatives 
including the Veriﬁed Rights Owner Programme, 
and is continually introducing new proactive 
measures to combat the global trade in counterfeits.”
COUNTERATTACK
As tabletop gaming grows and matures further, it’s 
all but certain that counterfeiting will continue. 
Petersen describes the problem as like an endless 
game of whack-a-mole, while Buckmaster says 
the number of games ﬁnding their way into the 
mainstream and hunger for popular titles means 
there’s no shortage of targets for forgers.
“I think the problem will continue, even if we 
can get some games cleaned up,” Buckmaster says. 
“Let’s say, for example, we manage to close down 
the problem on Dixit; my gut feeling is they might 
go onto something like Forbidden Island instead. 
Tey’ll just choose another stable product that’s 
always ranked highly on Amazon and go start 
counterfeiting that product, as well.’
However, steps are being taken to try and combat 
the number of fakes ﬁnding their way into players’ 
hands. Ad Magic and Breaking Games recently 
artnered with security and authentication specialist 
De la Rue to place custom 3D holograms on the 
companies’ games as proof of their genuineness. 
Other publishers and manufacturers have similarly 
stepped up their own eﬀorts to stem the ﬂow.
“As games become more complex and 
advanced from a production standpoint, the 
harder it will be for counterfeiters to keep up,” 
predicts Panda CEO Michael Lee.
Ultimately, though, it seems that the best way 
to avoid ending up with a counterfeit in your 
collection comes back to age-old advice.
“If a deal looks too good to be true, it probably 
is,” Buckmaster advises. “I know in this day and age 
a lot of people will want to buy the cheapest online 
oﬀer, but it’s always worth checking the source; if 
in doubt, buy from a brick-and-mortar store where 
you can actually see what you are buying”
“If you are going to buy from a third-party seller, 
read their feedback comments,” Tepper says. “Te 
third-party resellers that we caught selling counterfeit 
Dominions had multiple instances of feedback 
regarding counterfeit products. So either people 
are not checking these comments or they are willing to 
roll the dice for a ‘good deal’. You get what you pay for.”  
SPOT THE FAKE
Rio Grande’s Scott Tepper runs 
us through the diﬀerences 
between a genuine copy of 
Dominion: Second Edition (on the 
left) and a fake (on the right)
“It is diﬃcult to tell if you have 
a counterfeit copy of Dominion 
without opening up the box. The 
counterfeit copy is lighter in 
colour, but that would be diﬃcult 
to perceive without having an 
authentic copy next to it.
“Another hint that you might 
have a counterfeit copy is that 
there is a code, ELM 62812, 
in white print that appears 
under the Dominion logo on the 
side panel that has the picture 
of the bandit. That is a code 
referencing a particular print 
run from our factory. All of the 
counterfeit copies we have seen 
so far reference that code. But 
it is possible to have a copy 
with that code that is authentic, 
so that code alone is not an 
indicator of a counterfeit.
“There is also a diﬀerence 
in the linen ﬁnish of the box 
paper. An authentic copy has a 
ﬂat, non-glossy linen ﬁnish. The 
counterfeits have a more glossy 
ﬁnish that looks like a linen 
ﬁnish, but that is more due to 
the photograph of the cover art 
than an actual linen ﬁnish. But it 
is hard to discern this through 
the plastic wrap.
“Once you open the box, it is 
easy to see obvious tells. The 
counterfeit game has a very 
badly-made thin plastic inlay that 
crumples and breaks easily. The 
cards are lower quality than 
authentic Dominion cards, and 
the artists’ names on the cards 
are not white, but tend toward 
orange and red.”

D
uring the 1880s, while excavating 
the ancient Swedish town of Birka, 
archaeologist Knut Hjalmar Stolpe 
unearthed a large, well-furnished 
grave containing a Viking warrior. 
Alongside the armour-clad remains, Stolpe 
found weapons (sword, axe, spear, arrows), 
two shields, the skeletons of two unfortunate 
horses and, nestled lovingly in the corpse’s lap, 
a full set of board game pieces.
Te importance of this ﬁnal element was only 
emphasised when, in September 2017, DNA 
testing conﬁrmed that the remains were in fact 
female. Te arms and armour suggested she was 
a warrior, but the game pieces encouraged the 
most exciting conclusion: that she was of high 
status – perhaps “a powerful military leader,” as 
archaeologist Charlotte Hedenstierna-Jonson 
put it at the time of the revelation. Which 
means, in terms of upending our view of Viking 
society as male-dominated, the fact this real-life 
shieldmaiden could swing a blade is actually less 
signiﬁcant than her ownership of a board game. 
Tabletop gaming wasn’t just a frivolous 
pastime for Vikings – male or female. It was a 
sign of status. A huge deal. 
Tese days, if you threw an axe in a board 
game café, there’s a good chance it would 
hit a box with Vikings on it. From Eric Lang’s 
epic, Ragnarokkin’ Blood Rage (itself a 
reimplementation of his 2007 game Midgard), 
through 2016’s rather more whimsical 
Blue Orange title Vikings on Board, to Uwe 
Rosenberg’s gorgeously complex worker 
placement/tile-laying hybrid A Feast for 
Odin (which even comes with a detailed 
almanac on Norse life), the Viking theme has 
never been more popular. Not that it’s a new 
phenomenon, of course. Look at TSR’s 1982 
game Viking Gods, for example, or 2004’s Fire 
& Axe. Technically, the world-dominating 
Catan’s Viking-themed, too; designer Klaus 
Teuber was inspired by the Viking settlement 
of Iceland.
But there’s also a chance your café-terrorising 
throwing axe would (aside from getting you 
arrested, of course) strike the oldest Viking 
game of all. Te original Viking game. Te 
one whose pieces lay in the lap of that ancient 
chieftess, and which now is making something 
of a comeback. Namely, hnefataﬂ. 
RULES OF ENGAGEMENT
In June 2017, IT development manager David 
Lonsdale drove over 100 miles from his home 
in Peterborough to take part in a hnefataﬂ 
tournament held at the Hull and East Riding 
Museum. His brother Steve travelled with him, 
having introduced David to the game three 
years earlier, and the pair ended up facing 
each other in the ﬁnal. David was triumphant. 
“I guess its simplicity was the main thing,” 
says Lonsdale of why the game – which he also 
plays online – ﬁrst hooked him. When we speak, 
he reveals he’s just qualiﬁed for the top group on 
the Aage Nielsen website’s World Taﬂ Federation 
hnefataﬂ championship tournament.
“I was a reasonable chess player when I was 
younger, but I’m not the sort of person who

can sit down and learn lots of openings and 
things. What I liked about hnefataﬂ is generally 
it’s a simpler game with very simple rules. 
Whoever you’re playing, be they experienced 
or a learner, that simplicity means you can be 
on a relatively level playing ﬁeld.” 
Pronounced “neﬀa-taﬄe” and meaning 
‘king’s table’, it’s a two-player abstract strategy 
game which, intriguingly, is asymmetric. 
Te white player takes the defensive role, 
with their fewer pieces starting arranged in 
a diamond pattern around the king at the 
centre of a grid-based board. Teir objective 
is to move the king to safety, typically by 
reaching a corner square.
Te black player has no king, and 
commands twice as many troops as the white. 
Tese are arrayed in four, arrow-shaped 
groups around the board’s edge, and their task 
is to capture the white king.
Every piece moves like a rook in chess, and 
capturing usually happens when one player’s 
piece is trapped between two of the other player’s; 
although capturing a king in most versions of the 
game means you have to surround him on four 
sides. As you can guess, choosing black makes it 
a much tougher game, more reliant on long-term 
strategy than the reactive style white requires. 
Hnefataﬂ’s asymmetric nature is what 
appeals to Dr. Roderick Dale who, as cultural 
engagement fellow at the University of 
Nottingham’s Centre for the Study of the Viking 
Age, is one of the UK’s leading Viking experts.
“It makes you think,” he says, “because it 
requires diﬀerent things from you depending 
on which side you play. I actually ﬁnd it more 
interesting than chess. If you swap sides you’re 
eﬀectively playing two diﬀerent games, in 
some ways.” 
LOST IN TRANSLATION
One of the game’s foremost proponents in the 
UK is Damian Walker, who in 2004 founded the 
hnefataﬂ website (taﬂ.cyningstan.com) – an 
excellent online repository of all things Viking-
gamey – and has written two books on the game 
(Reconstructing Hnefataﬂ and An Introduction 
to Hnefataﬂ). It was in fact Walker who 
organised the Hull tournament won by David 
Lonsdale. He ﬁrst came across hnefataﬂ 15 
years ago, while reading a book about ancient 
board games, titled Te World Of Games. 
Hnefataﬂ involves 
an asymmetric 
setup where one 
player attempts to 
protect their king 
while the other 
tries to capture him

H N E F ATA F L :  T H E  V I K I N G  G A M E

“It was the striking appearance of the game 
that caught my eye,” Walker says. “Tough it’s 
got an asymmetrical division of forces between 
the two players, the board layout looks very 
symmetrical and pleasing. Once I discovered 
the game, it was the mystery surrounding it 
that kept me interested; it turned out that there 
was a lot of information waiting to be found. 
We know a lot more about it now than we did 
10 or 15 years ago.”
At the heart of that mystery were the rules 
of the game itself, which it seems the Vikings 
never wrote down.
“For decades,” explains Walker, “everyone was 
trying to reconstruct it from a faulty translation.”
It turns out that an English misunderstanding 
of Swedish scientist Carl Linneaus’ 18th-
century Latin account of the rules, recorded 
after he played the game in Lapland, gave 
rise to the idea that the king needs to be 
surrounded on all four sides when, in fact, 
says Walker, “the Latin passage says that 
the king is captured like other pieces except 
when he still sits in his central ‘castle’ square; 
only then does it take four enemies to 
surround him”. Hence the imbalance, “where 
it’s very hard to capture the king – especially 
since both the English and Latin rules have 
the king winning when he gets to the edge of 
the board”.
Tis has led to dozens of modern variants 
on the game that attempt to balance out the 
rules, such as by stating that the king needs 
to get to a corner, rather than the board’s 
edge. Tis is stated by the ‘Copenhagen’ 
ruleset, followed by the Aage Nielsen 
tournament. Other variants include the 
Fetlar rules (established for the world 
championship on the Hebridean island 
of Fetlar, overseen by hnefataﬂ enthusiast 
Peter Kelly until his death in 2014), as well 
as the diﬀerent ancient versions of the game, 
played on a variety of board sizes from 
seven-by-seven up to 19-by-19: brandub, 
tablut, tawlbwrdd, alea evangelii… 
For Lonsdale, this sheer variety and 
mutability is far from oﬀ-putting. Just the 
opposite, in fact.
“What really interests me isn’t so much the 
playing of an individual game, it’s actually 
playing to try and work out the best version,” he 
says. “You know: on a particular-sized board, 
should you be playing with an unarmed king 
[ie. one that can’t take enemy pieces], corner-
square sort of combination? What’s the right 
combination of rules on a certain board to get 
an even balance between black and white?”
For the more casual player, though, it’s 
probably best just to go with the rules as 
given in the History Craft Ltd version of the 
game (as summarised above, and close to the 
Copenhagen ones), simply titled Te Viking 
Game. Tis impressively designed set bases its 
pieces on the 12th-century Lewis chessmen 
found in the Outer Hebrides in 1831 and 
comes with a grid printed on natural linen 
that incorporates “typical Viking patterns”. 
You really feel, when playing with this set, that 
you’re experiencing the game as the Vikings 
themselves did, back in the historical murk of 
the Dark Ages.
NORSE PLAY
Board gaming was, conﬁrms Dale, “quite 
important” to the Vikings: “It was almost 
certainly something that everybody did.”
Taﬂ (ie. “table”) games – which descended 
from even more ancient, Roman games – were 
signiﬁcant enough to feature in Te Sagas of 
Icelanders; plus, of course, there’s all the 
archaeological evidence to show that, as Dale 
puts it: “Playing board games was something 
you did when you weren’t busy trying to 
conquer the Danelaw.” Hnefataﬂ sets were 
“prized possessions,” says Damian Walker; 
“Archaeologists have found some very ﬁne 
examples buried as grave goods.”
It was, as its name suggests, truly the game 
of kings. Not that playing it with an actual king 
was a good idea. 

“Tere’s a story that Cnut the Great, king of 
England and Denmark [from 1016 to 1035], 
was at a feast at Roskilde when his brother-
in-law Ulf saw that he was in a bad mood 
and thought, ‘Right, let’s cheer him up with 
a board game,’” relates Dale. “But when they 
played, Cnut wanted to take a move back, and 
he and Ulf argued about it until Ulf kicked the 
table over and stormed out. So Cnut had him 
killed the next day.” 
Still, whatever the risks, if you wanted to 
be considered a proper member of Viking 
aristocracy, you needed to know how to play 
board games.
“Earl Rögnvald of Orkney wrote a poem 
describing his skills,” Dale explains, “all the 
skills you would need to be a well-rounded 
member of the aristocracy. And he includes in 
it his skill at playing board games.”
You can’t help but wonder if hnefataﬂ was 
treated by the Vikings as some kind of strategy 
primer – a way of honing their battle tactics. You 
can imagine that its asymmetric nature, which 
makes victory harder for the ‘invading’ force 
and therefore more glorious when achieved 
over the besieged whites, might appeal to a 
people who, while actually mostly ﬁshers and 
farmers, were nevertheless renowned and 
feared for their raiding and pillaging tendencies. 
Certainly, the presence of taﬂ pieces in that 
unknown female warrior’s grave was taken as a 
strong sign she might be a military leader. 
“It would have been a good way to teach 
tactical thinking,” says Walker, “but I don’t know 
if the Vikings used it for that purpose. It seems 
to have been played mostly for relaxation.”
Historian Dale is even less sure: “Whether 
the board games were actually intended to 
teach strategy per se, or whether that type of 
thinking is just a byproduct of playing board 
games, we have absolutely no idea. Tey’re 
never presented as teaching strategy in the 
source material that we have. And I don’t 
think we can even begin to speculate as to 
why they’d particularly like an asymmetric 
game. I mean, you have to remember this 
style of game had been popular for thousands 
of years.” 
A medieval gaming piece from the 9th to mid-
11th centuries made from cast lead or lead 
alloy. The shape of the piece (similar to a rook 
in chess) might mean that it was used as a king 
in hnefataﬂ matches (The Portable Antiquities 
Scheme/The Trustees of the British Museum)
And then, from around the 13th century 
onwards, hnefataﬂ almost completely 
disappeared from tabletops. Its younger, 
cooler and distinctly less lop-sided cousin 
chess sidled into town and became the new 
rage. Scandinavians, thinks Dale, must have 
noticed the aristocracy in Francia playing this 
intriguing, impressive Eastern import, and 
adopted it as a new kind of status symbol.
“Te popular kids were playing it,” he notes. 
“So everybody else wanted to play it.” 
THE RETURN OF 
THE KING’S TABLE
It wasn’t until the mid-19th century that 
hnefataﬂ truly reappeared, when chess 
company Jacques of London put out the ﬁrst-
ever commercial version of the game, using 
James Edward Smith’s (mis)translation of 
Linnaeus’ rules (albeit with the rule-balancing 
addition that the king couldn’t capture 
black pieces). Much later, in 1965, it was 
reimagined as naval strategy game Breakthru 
(although Walker says that’s “a diﬀerent game 
altogether”, only loosely inspired by hnefataﬂ). 
Ten, in 1970, Milton Bradley published its 
own version of the game named Swords and 
Shields. Neither exactly took oﬀ. 
It’s only in more recent years that players are 
rediscovering the Vikings’ favourite pastime 
(apart from, y’know, sacking Lindisfarne) in any 
signiﬁcant numbers, with Walker’s tournament 
joining annual events in West Stoke and 
Formby – as well as the Fetlar tournament, 
which is expected to return this spring. 
History Craft’s Te Viking Game, which 
smartly makes a virtue of its ancient nature 
rather than trying to gussy it up in modern 
clothing, is certainly helping spread 
awareness, as are websites like Walker’s and 
Aage Nielsen’s. People – not just Eric Lang and 
Uwe Rosenberg – can’t seem to get enough of 
those hairy, Dark Age raiders.
“It may be that it’s kicking oﬀ more now 
because Vikings are particularly fashionable 
at the moment,” suggests Dale, who himself 
has been besotted with Vikings since hearing 
Norse myths as a child on his Hebridean 
grandmother’s knee, “thanks to the Vikings 
TV series and Te Last Kingdom. I think more 
people may be getting interested in it just 
because of that.” 
Hnefataﬂ certainly rewards that interest. 
It’s more accessible than chess, while its 
asymmetric nature gives it an idiosyncratic 
appeal. Besides, if it was good enough for old 
Earl Rögnvald – a saint, no less – it’s surely 
good enough for any of us.  
It seems to have 
been played 
mostly for 
relaxation.

Doctors Paul Wake and Sam Illingworth
M
any of us will be beginning 
2018 by trying to undo the 
excesses brought about 
during the tail end of 2017. 
Joining a gym, opening a 
new savings account, cutting down on cheese 
and perhaps gleefully returning Monopoly to 
the deepest recesses of our shelving units. What 
is it about family get-togethers that makes us 
reach for the red and white box when spending 
time with the extended family? We certainly 
don’t seem to enjoy the game...
Hasbro’s 2013 ‘Disconnect Reconnect’ 
advert certainly captures the sentiment 
behind us getting games to the table, but it 
is some way oﬀ the reality of what happens 
once play begins. One online response to the 
video says it all: “Monopoly doesn’t make 
friendships, it breaks them.”
A recent survey named Monopoly as 
the cause of nearly half of all game-related 
arguments and the game most likely to end 
with a ﬂipped board (which is exactly what 
happens in Hasbro’s 2017 ‘Monopoly New 
Classic Edition’ ad). But why? Research 
from the Georgia Institute of Technology has 
shown that games that minimise luck and 
resource management are the most eﬀective 
in fostering collaboration. In other words, 
science tells us that Monopoly (a game 
that is based entirely on luck and resource 
management) might well be the worst 
game to play with non-gamers, as there’s a 
very real risk that they will come away with 
the impression that board games are little 
more than a cause of conﬂict and strife.
Of course, conﬂict is at the heart of many 
games. As Roger Caillois, a key ﬁgure in game 
studies, puts it, competition (what he calls 
‘agôn’) is a key element of play. Competitive 
games, he says, are “like a combat in which 
equality of chances is artiﬁcially created”. 
Players of Monopoly will be all too aware 
that any such ‘equality’ is often abandoned 
the moment that its uncontrollable human 
variables (players) sit down at the table. Tis 
can be ﬁne; it can even make the game worth 
playing, when everyone understands the game’s 
(unwritten) rules. As Caillois puts it, play is 
an activity that’s separate (in time and space) 
from everyday life, so if in-game conﬂicts are 
spilling over into the ‘real’ world (as Hasbro’s 
2016 Monopoly Christmas helpline suggests) 
then things are clearly going awry! Perhaps we 
might conclude that being comfortable with 
‘competitive play’ is something that takes practice.
Readers of this magazine won’t need Caillois 
to tell them that competition is just one aspect of 
play. Eurogames such as Carcassonne allow for 
less painful ‘indirect competition,’ collaborative 
games such as Pandemic and Arkham Horror 
displace competition by treating the system as 
the antagonist, while ‘semi-collaborative’ games 
such as Dead of Winter and Betrayal at House 
on the Hill match competition with storytelling 
and imaginative roleplay. In other words, there 
might be better games to play with your non-
game-playing family and friends than Monopoly, 
especially if you want to play with them again.
So, the next time Uncle Nigel suggests a 
friendly game of Monopoly, reach for your 
copy of Betrayal and suggest swapping 
hotels and stations for statuary corridors and 
research laboratories.

PAINTS USED
ZENITHAL HIGHLIGHTING
Zenithal highlighting at its core is a much more complicated 
process than what I am going to show you in this guide. I will 
show a basic version that helps apply a simpliﬁ ed version 
of highlighting. This begins at the basecoating stage, whilst 
preparing the model for the later stages.
Begin by basecoating the 
miniature black. This is easiest 
with a black spray paint.
Once the black is dry, apply a 
light spray of white from the 
top around the model. This 
will create a light element 
of highlighting and shading 
straight oﬀ  the bat that will 
either provide shading and 
highlighting in later stages or a 
guide as to where they should 
be applied. 
STAGES
Each creature is split up into four stages, each with a list 
of colours and the corresponding paint that was used 
for it. Each stage uses a diﬀ erent technique to achieve a 
similar eﬀ ect on each element but with diﬀ erent colours.
Stage 1 is base colours. Base colours are applied using a 
mix of glazes and ﬂ at colours.
Stage 2 is applying shading. In this stage we use 
various washes and glazes to add an element of 
shading to the models.
Stage 3 is highlighting. This stage involves applying a line 
of your colour along the hard edges and ridges of the 
area. I would recommend using a ﬁ ne brush and adding a 
tiny dash of water to your paints.
Stage 4 is ﬁ nal highlight. This involves adding a small dot 
or dash of a colour, generally in the same area as the 
previous highlight, but focusing on corners or where folds 
in cloth meet. For hair or fur it involves adding a dot to 
the tip of each strand. If you ﬁ nd yourself unsure of where 
to apply the highlights or spot highlights, look over the 
images alongside the guide and compare that stage to 
the last.
Stage 5 is the ﬁ nal details. This stage involves cleaning up 
and adding a few spot highlights. This stage also includes 
painting the base of the model.

More fun than tiling your bathroom!
AZUL
TRY THIS IF YOU LIKED… SAGRADA
Azul has fewer moving parts than Sagrada, but its drafting and tile-laying 
mechanics are just as strong and the visuals are equally gorgeous.
WHAT’S IN 
THE BOX?
◗ 100 resin tiles
◗ Four player boards
◗ Nine factory displays
◗ First player marker
◗ Linen bag
I
t was only a matter of time before 
someone took term ‘tile-laying’ 
literally and designed a game 
about – you guessed it – laying down 
tiles. Azul embraces this prosaic 
premise and takes it to a wonderfully 
colourful place, delivering ambitious 
gameplay on its way.
‘Azul’ – Spanish and Portuguese 
for 'blue' – comes from the word 
‘azulejos’, decorative tiles used by 
Portuguese monarch Manuel I. Tis 
sets up the game, giving players some 
background information to justify 
tiling walls – beyond this, though, the 
theme is entirely window dressing. 
Tis is fairly insigniﬁcant as, at its 
heart, Azul is a quick abstract game 
with beautifully-made tiles.
At a ﬁrst glance, it might seem that 
there are a lot of luck elements within 
the game. After the initial random 
drawing of tiles out of a bag, however, 
the game becomes pure strategy. 
Players can collect tiles of the 
same colour from one of the plates, 
moving remaining tiles to the centre. 
Alternatively, they can also pick from 
the centre, once at least one tile has 
been moved there. Once taken by 
the player, the tiles are moved to the 
‘pattern lines’. 
Already, this simple action of 
picking up tiles and placing them 
on the player mat has a myriad of 
possible tactical decisions. Players 
might take a risk and discard several 
tiles to the middle, in the hope that 
enough tiles of the same colour will 
accumulate by the time the turn 
returns to them, allowing them to 
pick up a lot of them at the same 
time – but there's always the chance 
their opponents might get those 
tiles ahead of them. Te order in 
which the tiles are transferred to 
the ‘pattern lines’ is important, too. 
Which colour is best to build ﬁrst? 
Which colours are other players 
going for? Which combinations need 
to be picked up to avoid excess tiles 
going to the ‘ﬂoor line’ and hence 
earning a player minus points?
Te scoring part of Azul is equally 
tactical. Transferring one tile from 
the pattern line to the ‘wall’ earns 
players a single point. Put tiles 
adjacent to each other instead and 
you'll score one point for each tile 
in a horizontal and vertical row 
attached to the newly-placed tile. 
Tis means that points can rack up 
quite fast with thoughtful sequence 
of placements. It also eliminates 
a possibility of a runaway winner, 
because one cleverly added tile to 
the wall can bring in enough points 
to catch up, even in the last round. 
Winning in Azul depends entirely on 
the player and the set of decisions 
they make during the game.
Tis is not to say that Azul lacks 
player interaction and opponents 
cannot inﬂuence each other’s moves. 
In the drafting stage of the game it is 
quite easy to steal tiles form under 
an opponent’s nose or, alternatively, 
leave them with tiles they do not 
want. Tis confrontation is most 
pronounced in a two-player game, 
where Azul turns into a tense chess-
like game of push-and-pull between 
the players.
Despite the simplicity of its 
mechanics, Azul’s rules can feel 
ﬁddly and confusing, especially with 
its scoring. Azul is the type of game 
that will ‘click’ after playing it once, 
and the second time going players 
will make more strategic and better-
informed decisions. Luckily, one 
game of Azul, even with four people, 
lasts about half an hour, so it is very 
easy to play just one more.
Azul is everything one would 
want from an abstract game; it looks 
instantly beautiful on the table 
and its gameplay is challenging 
and addictive. Te game is really 
good at rewarding players for their 
thoughtful mo ves and placements, 
and, despite one minor luck 
element, there is a real breadth of 
choice and decisions to be made 
throughout the game. 
Breathtakingly beautiful and tactically 
exciting, Azul will be a great addition 
to any board game shelf. While its 
premise is seemingly mundane, this is 
a game unlike any other.

“T
he axe forgets, but the tree 
remembers.”
Vengeance opens with an 
African proverb. It’s more 
than just a clever way to 
imbue its tales of revenge and reprisal with a 
particular tone of unrelenting drive and pent-up 
fury come unleashed. Te aphorism also very 
deliberately brings to mind the opening shots of 
cinematic eﬀorts from directors from Tarantino 
to the Coen brothers; from True Grit and John 
Wick to Gladiator and Inglorious Basterds, 
ﬁlm is full of stories of aggrieved victims 
rising up to dish out payback on those 
responsible for their suﬀering. Vengeance 
aims to ﬁnd that same level of heightened 
emotion and unﬂinching action in the rolling 
of dice and drafting of cards.
“It’s a board game take on revenge 
movies – your Kill Bill, Oldboy-style thing,” 
sums up creator Gordon Calleja. “Oldboy, 
more than Kill Bill. Te Korean [original] – Park 
Chan-wook’s Oldboy. Te Vengeance trilogy 
was mainly the inspiration. Kill Bill was 
second, maybe.”
As with any good revenge ﬂick, 
Vengeance starts with each 
player’s character being horribly 
mistreated by one of the game’s 
cast of baddies, during a 
phase ﬁttingly titled Te 
Wronging. Te antagonists 
inﬂict one of three diﬀerent 
types of lasting damage to the 
heroes, from crushing their knee 
to inﬂict broken damage, which 
reduces that character’s combat 
ability throughout the rest of 
the game, to mentally scarring 
them, which limits their ability 
to heal, upgrade and more.
It’s these cards that serve as 
the thematic motivation that 
spurs each character to seek 
justice, but they also serve as a 
key foundation for the ensuing 
gameplay, dictating which 
boss and surrounding gang 
that player must pursue to 
maximise their score by the 
time the cardboard credits 
roll. Tis means that players 
can also choose to ramp 
up their avatar’s anguish to 
increase their own challenge, 
with the potential to reap 
the rewards if violent 
karma is delivered.
“At the start when you draft, you have to suﬀer 
three cards, but you can suﬀer as many as you 
want – the more you suﬀer, the more damaged 
you are and the less ability you have, but the 
more points you can score,” Calleja says.
True to its onscreen muses, Vengeance’s 
core action sees its protagonists working their 
way through their foe’s underlings before 
eventually facing their ultimate nemesis at the 
top of the chain.
“Te heart of the game is the ﬁght,” 
enthuses Calleja.
Combat is executed with dice rolls that are 
cashed in to allow each hero to take down an 
enemy in their current room, a minion in an 
adjacent room or to move out of an area to 
avoid taking damage themselves. Upgrades 
acquired over the course of a playthrough 
present the chance to modify rolls, helping to 
deal with the various types of attacker standing 
in the way – whether it’s cannon fodder needing 
to be eliminated ﬁrst, blockers restricting the 
character’s movement or tough guys able to 
deal extra hits.
“Each of these minions has a diﬀerent 
ability,” Calleja explains. “Tat’s how the 
dice-based puzzle works. It’s like a dungeon 
crawler. Te diﬀerence is here it’s a post-luck 
situation – you have your dice rolled and then 
you make your decisions after, rather than make 
your decisions then roll dice, which is what 
most dungeon crawlers do. It’s pre-luck versus 
post-luck.”
GONNA NEED A MONTAGE
Dispatching adversaries may be where 
Vengeance’s title rings truest, but it’s not all there 
is to the game. Just as the best action movies 
establish their characters’ motives and justify 
their superhuman-seeming abilities, Calleja has 
integrated natural lulls in the ﬁghting to allow 
Vengeance’s characters – and players – to catch 
their breath and prepare for the next battle.
“Te game alternates between montage 
phases, which are your classic Eye of the Tiger 
‘getting better’ training, and going out to 
recon,” he details. 
Each montage consists of players selecting 
cards and drafting dice from a central pool to 
set up their next run at taking down their rival, 
before seeking out the boss or their aﬃliated 
gang members in one of several diﬀerent 
locations during the recon phase.
“Tese are like little snapshots, little 
scenarios, vignettes,” Calleja says of the 
separate environments that are placed next to 
each other on the table and can be tackled by 
diﬀerent players at the same time, in a blending

of simultaneous action that brings to mind 
the splitscreen visuals and parallel editing 
associated with 24, Te Godfather and Te 
Silence of the Lambs. 
Te result is a game that the designer is 
conﬁdent pays ample thematic homage to 
its ﬁlmic inspirations and conjures the right 
emotional responses from players without 
diluting or losing its interactive aspects as a 
board game.
“I always start with the theme,” Calleja reveals. 
“Tis and [2015 post-apocalyptic survival game] 
Posthuman, all my games are theme ﬁrst. 
So theme/idea ﬁrst, then I start shaping the 
mechanics, then I develop the theme more, then 
I develop the mechanics more. It’s an iterative 
process between rules and story or images in the 
player’s mind. I try to have things that are not 
abstracted but rather little actions to stimulate 
those sequences of little mental images that 
create a sort of ongoing story.”
Calleja’s commitment to mimicking not 
only the tone of movies, but also their gradual 
build-up of dramatic momentum, helps keep 
the background mechanisms of the gameplay 
tight, ensuring that a match of Vengeance 
would play out in the same time it might take 
to watch a silver screen blockbuster.
“It’s two hours for four people,” Calleja states 
conﬁdently. “Te idea was to keep it two hours, 
and it’s two hours. When you play with a timer, 
if you’re speedy, you can play in an hour and a 
half. Test groups that take up the time or don’t 
play with a timer take about two hours.”
Despite the game’s rip-roaring action 
movie feel, Calleja says that early versions 
of Vengeance were stretched to wearisome 
lengths by players failing to take the 
necessary risks and live out the moment-
to-moment ﬁght for survival demanded 
by the genre.
“Te ﬁght was always the same,” the 
designer recalls. “Te ﬁght was there, 
and the theme and the overall [idea of] 
you needing to ﬁnd the guys and score 
them by going to ﬁnd them, that was there. 
But the montage was the thing that changed 
a lot. Initially you chose whether you fought 
or stayed in – montage or ﬁght. But we 
found after a couple of months of testing 
that one group was taking really long, 
like four hours, because they were 
playing really safely. Tey’d heal 
everything, upgrade everything 
and then go in. So the only 
way to keep it under a certain 
amount of time was to have 
that structure.
“I took the inspiration from movies themselves 
that have a structure and went for a prelude, 
Te Wronging and then acts one, two and three 
that replicate that kind of movie structure. Tat 
worked a lot better because I could control the 
time. Tat was the biggest change.”
Although Vengeance’s dice-driven exploits 
are inherently reliant on luck and keep the 
feeling of tension running suitably high, 
Calleja is keen to stress that players still have 
plenty of agency and control over the outcome 
of their quest for retribution. 
“Initially the montage was only dice and that’s 
it,” he says. “Ten we added the cards to make 
it a bit less luck-based. Ten there’s two modes 
– easy mode and a hardcore mode, which is the 
more interesting and tactical one. In easy mode, 
you have six cards, you choose three of them and 
play them and get them back. In hardcore mode, 
you play your three, then you discard two of 
them. So you only keep one and you cannot use 
them again. So you have to kind of plan an arc.”
Te more strategic aspects of the game can 
be highlighted further by removing the use of 
a three-minute sand timer, which is used in 
the standard mode to force players to make 
quick decisions during the ﬁghting phase. 
“Some test groups didn’t want to use the 
timer,” Calleja says. “Ten it becomes a much 
more tactical attempt to get 
the perfect combination 
of moves. At ﬁrst it’s 
easy when you have only your ﬁrst upgrade 
and it’s easy to mitigate the rolls and stuﬀ, 
but then when you get lots of these chained 
together it can become quite a head-spin.”
Another proposed variant isn’t found in 
the core box, but is instead set to be released 
as a separate expansion that reintroduces 
direct player-versus-player combat to the 
game, dramatically altering the dynamic of 
the otherwise passively competitive setup. 
Te Saboteurs set allows players to recruit 
the titular guns-for-hire and plant them on a 
gang’s den, ambushing rival characters as they 
attempt to chase down their target.
“We found that most of our testers did not 
want that kind of direct conﬂict, so we left that 
type of conﬂict out of the main game and put it 
in a separate place,” Calleja reveals.
Perhaps even more intriguing than 
Vengeance’s multiplayer mode is its solo 
campaign, which sees a single character 
play through a predetermined narrative 
based on their in-universe history. Replacing 
the competition with fellow avengers and 
randomised elements with a more focused 
perspective, it’s the closest the game comes to 
oﬀering a scripted, movie-like experience.
“Each character, on the back, you have a 
backstory and setup sheet for the solo game,” 
explains Calleja. “Ten it tells you which 
vengeance decks you use and how to prepare the 
boss deck. You have a story for that character.

The heart of

“You can do this

‘He’s getting back at the guy who wrecked his 
punk club’ – and you go through the various 
objectives you need to get. Some of them are 
simple – go nab this boss – and then they get 
more complex as the character progresses.”
THREE CHEERS FOR 
SWEET REVENGE
With its in-built narrative structure, 
character-centric drama and fast-paced, 
dice-powered combat, Vengeance’s 
cinematic world of troubled heroes and 
pervasive archvillains might seem like a setting ripe 
for further exploration. Calleja answers carefully 
when asked about the possibility of a follow-up 
that would allow him to double-down on the 
storytelling aspect, such as a roleplaying game.
“Yes,” he replies coyly after a brief pause. 
“Actually, I’m working on something using the 
same dice-based system at the moment. It’ll be 
a co-operative RPG-ish thing. Tat’s all I can say 
about it at the moment. Tat’s the idea.
“I seem to enjoy making things using rules to 
create story. I’m a games researcher and a games 
academic, so I write a lot about game narrative and 
involvement and immersion. So I guess that stuﬀ 
ﬁnds its way through the board games. Initially 
Posthuman was created as an illustration of this 
series of papers I’ve been writing on emergent 
narrative in games. I made a board game to try 
and illustrate it. Tat’s where this all started.”
Calleja is openly passionate when it comes to 
his attempts to push the ability of board games 
to emotionally engage players and tell stories 
that go beyond the linear form of ﬁlm – while 
still boasting a comparable level of reﬁned 
artistry and overall vision. His latest project may 
be indebted to the cinema screen and played 
on the tabletop, yet the designer outwardly 
expresses a desire to imprint his stylistic intent 
on a canvas touched by ﬁlm and games alike.
“My main job is in video game research and I 
have a video game studio, Mighty Box,” he says. 
“It’s been nice moving over to the cardboard 
world. I feel like I have more of a direct 
relationship with the imaginations of my players, 
because they have to animate the rules and 
pieces and art internally rather than have that 
worked out for you onscreen. Tat’s what I enjoy.
“You have to ﬁll in those gaps, right? Scott 
McCloud has a great book on comics and 
how the work in-between the panels is what 
generates or stimulates the imagination more 
than anything else. Tat’s the kind of thing I 
try to do with my games.” 
“You can do this 
thing like it tells you the
backstory, what they’re trying to do –
‘He’s getting back at the guy who wrecked his 
punk club’ – and you go through the various
objectives you need to get. Some of them are 
simple – go nab this boss – and then they get
more complex as the character progresses.”

F
rom increased sales, booming convention 
numbers and the success of this very 
magazine, it’s clear that tabletop gaming is 
enjoying a bit of a renaissance. Tere are 
dozens of strands that have all contributed 
to this trend, but it’s hard to get the numbers and 
stats needed to fully quantify their impact.
Recently, however, Dungeons & Dragons 
publisher Wizards of the Coast revealed one 
interesting nugget of information: more than 
50% of players who started with the roleplaying 
game’s latest ﬁfth edition got into it through 
watching people play online. Tis is backed 
by numbers from popular streaming platform 
Twitch, which show that the amount of D&D 
content its users produce has been doubling each 
year since 2017. Tese are the kind of numbers 
that can shape an industry.
STRANGE ENCOUNTERS
It seems strange to call someone a veteran of 
an industry that’s only been around a handful 
of years, but if you could call anybody a 
veteran streamer it would be Will Jones.
Te founder of Encounter Roleplay, Jones 
has been living, breathing and sleeping 
tabletop RPGs since setting the group up in 
2015. What started as a hobby has morphed 
into a full-time career that has taken him 
across the globe.
“I started DMing when I was just 10 or 11, 
roping in my family to play with me, and it all 
spiralled out of control from there,” he says. 
“Twitch is quite similar in a way. Tis feels like 
something I’ve been doing for much, much 
longer than I actually have been.”
From humble beginnings, the Encounter 
Roleplay network has blossomed to include 
ten diﬀerent weekly shows, ranging from a 
horriﬁc Call of Cthulhu campaign to a high 
fantasy D&D playthrough. Its Twitch channel 
is followed by more than 19,000 people and 
the group recently launched a Kickstarter 
campaign for its own adventures.
One of the advantages of livestreaming RPGs, 
and why the format has proved so successful, 
Jones says, is the way it allows content creators 
and audiences to interact directly.
“We used to run a Q&A show,” he explains. 
“People would ask us about DMing or playing 
the games and we’d talk back. But I realised 
that what would actually be best would be 
to actually provide real examples – to run 
through games in a way that allowed us to talk 
directly to the audience while playing.
“Tat’s something you couldn’t achieve if 
the format didn’t work like this. Tat’s one of 
the big advantages you get from streaming, 
and why it’s been so popular, I think. It’s been

STREAMING AHEAD
Watching people play RPGs and board games 
online has never been more popular – and the 
boom in livestreaming on YouTube and Twitch 
is leading to a new wave of on-screen stars

FRONTLINE GAMING
If you’re a fan of competitive Warhammer 
you probably know about the Independent 
Tournament Circuit. What you may not know 
is that the company behind the ITC rules, US-
based Frontline Gaming, streams competitive 
games most nights through its Twitch channel.

YOGSQUEST
The Yogscast crew are best known for their 
work on video games, but their Yogsquest show 
cuts down on the tech for a focus on pen-and-
paper RPGs. Like many others they started out 
with D&D, but have since embraced several of 
the other systems out there.

great to see the explosion in the people playing 
RPGs online since we started.”
MAJOR PLAYERS
Of course, it isn’t just the fans that are turning 
their eyes to streaming. Tabletop developers 
and publishers across the globe have leapt upon 
the idea of having fans show their love for their 
products online and, for the most part, are moving 
to support and foster growth wherever they can.
While D&D publisher Wizards of the Coast 
is perhaps the most visible company to make a 
major move into livestreaming – its latest major 
announcements have all come through streaming 
events and its Twitch channel features a huge 
range of shows, including one from Encounter 
Roleplay – others are also taking a major interest.
Games Workshop has run its ‘Warhammer 
TV’ channel on Twitch and YouTube for several 
years now and has moved to livestreaming major 
tournaments and events, while board games giant 
Asmodee teamed up with Twitch to showcase 
content from the 2017 Essen gaming expo.
Even when companies aren’t moving directly 
into the streaming circuit themselves, more 
and more are putting out video content that 
at least feels inspired by the movement – less 
formalised rules explanations and pre-scripted 
adverts, more chatter and realistic gameplay.
Modiphius, publisher of countless RPGs, 
board games and wargames, has started putting 
out video content with precisely this kind of 
feel. In the run-up to the release of Fallout: 
Wasteland Warfare, founder Chris Birch and 
wargames manager Jon Webb put out a series 
of videos showing themselves playing through 
the game that had a friendly, informal feel 
reminiscent of fan-made streams.
“We’re always trying to be quite friendly as 
a business – to be open and talk directly to our 
fans,” explains Birch. “Tat means we don’t 
always want to be highly polished, super-edited. 
We want to talk to people at their level rather 
than talk down to them.”
Te company has certainly embraced this 
approach, which highlights one of the other 
advantages to getting games and other products 
out in front of fans and streamers alike – it 
allows developers to communicate directly with 
the communities that buy their products and 
play their games.
Birch notes that “this doesn’t always mean 
doing exactly what the loudest, shoutiest voices 
are saying,” but nevertheless provides another 
route for fans to communicate, in the same way 
that the streamers themselves can interact with 
their watchers.
“At the moment we’re focusing mainly on 
recorded video, but we’re setting up to do 
livestreaming,” he adds.
“With a worldwide fanbase, being live isn’t 
necessarily always a bonus. Especially as much 
of our audience is in the US; if we want to talk 
to them we either need to schedule things at 
a weird hour or just assume that much of the 
audience isn’t going to watch it live.”
WHATEVER WORKS
One of the exciting and worrying things about 
being on the cutting edge is working out what 
works and what doesn’t. Even when you 
think you have that nailed down, some new 
technology or approach comes along and 
quickly changes that, too.
Just a decade ago most people would have 
laughed at the idea of millions of people 
watching strangers stream themselves playing 
video games, but now we live in a world where 
more than 15 million people tune into Twitch 
every day – and that’s only one site among many.
Tere are technical and logistical challenges 
when it comes to showing live gameplay at the 
tabletop, even when compared to ‘conventional’ 
video games. Ideally you need several cameras 
and mics, all of which need to be set up correctly 
and reliable enough to run for several hours 
without any issues.
Even when you have the practical side of things 
solved, there’s the more esoteric side of things to 
settle. Do you show a battle grid, if you have one? 
How about character sheets and dice rolls? What 
do you do about things like secret rolls and notes 
passed to the DM? Is it even possible to stream 
something like Battlestar Galactica or Dead of 
Winter, where vital information being hidden on a 
tiny card is an integral part of the experience? 
“Wargames always look great on camera, and 
RPGs are getting better and better as people 
work out how to present that stuﬀ,” says Birch. 
“Shield of Tomorrow, the Star Trek Adventures 
show from Geek & Sundry on Twitch, is a great 
example of that.
“Ultimately, it all comes down to the people. 
With the right people, and the right chemistry, 
anything can look good. I’m a huge fan of 
Watch It Played, a show by Rodney Smith, 
because he’s such a passionate and engaged fan 
of the games he’s talking about. You can’t help 
but want to play them!
“Likewise, you can sometimes get people 
playing a great game – but if they’re boring…”
No matter what happens next for tabletop 
gaming, it’s hard to imagine that streaming 
is going to go away anytime soon. Te only 
real uncertainty lies in where the next major 
success will be. 
ENCOUNTER ROLEPLAY
It’s rare to ﬁnd a group of people so committed 
to their cause as the Encounter Roleplay 
team. The sheer range of shows they oﬀer is 
baﬀling, as is the quality. Lose your mind with 
Lovecraftian horror one day, ﬁght a dragon

CRITICAL ROLE
The granddaddy of all RPG streams, Critical 
Role has spawned fans in the hundreds

the way and the archives remain a treat.

More fun than tiling your bathroom!
AZUL
TRY THIS IF YOU LIKED… SAGRADA
Azul has fewer moving parts than Sagrada, but its drafting and tile-laying 
mechanics are just as strong and the visuals are equally gorgeous.
WHAT’S IN 
THE BOX?
◗ 100 resin tiles
◗ Four player boards
◗ Nine factory displays
◗ First player marker
◗ Linen bag
I
t was only a matter of time before 
someone took term ‘tile-laying’ 
literally and designed a game 
about – you guessed it – laying down 
tiles. Azul embraces this prosaic 
premise and takes it to a wonderfully 
colourful place, delivering ambitious 
gameplay on its way.
‘Azul’ – Spanish and Portuguese 
for 'blue' – comes from the word 
‘azulejos’, decorative tiles used by 
Portuguese monarch Manuel I. Tis 
sets up the game, giving players some 
background information to justify 
tiling walls – beyond this, though, the 
theme is entirely window dressing. 
Tis is fairly insigniﬁcant as, at its 
heart, Azul is a quick abstract game 
with beautifully-made tiles.
At a ﬁrst glance, it might seem that 
there are a lot of luck elements within 
the game. After the initial random 
drawing of tiles out of a bag, however, 
the game becomes pure strategy. 
Players can collect tiles of the 
same colour from one of the plates, 
moving remaining tiles to the centre. 
Alternatively, they can also pick from 
the centre, once at least one tile has 
been moved there. Once taken by 
the player, the tiles are moved to the 
‘pattern lines’. 
Already, this simple action of 
picking up tiles and placing them 
on the player mat has a myriad of 
possible tactical decisions. Players 
might take a risk and discard several 
tiles to the middle, in the hope that 
enough tiles of the same colour will 
accumulate by the time the turn 
returns to them, allowing them to 
pick up a lot of them at the same 
time – but there's always the chance 
their opponents might get those 
tiles ahead of them. Te order in 
which the tiles are transferred to 
the ‘pattern lines’ is important, too. 
Which colour is best to build ﬁrst? 
Which colours are other players 
going for? Which combinations need 
to be picked up to avoid excess tiles 
going to the ‘ﬂoor line’ and hence 
earning a player minus points?
Te scoring part of Azul is equally 
tactical. Transferring one tile from 
the pattern line to the ‘wall’ earns 
players a single point. Put tiles 
adjacent to each other instead and 
you'll score one point for each tile 
in a horizontal and vertical row 
attached to the newly-placed tile. 
Tis means that points can rack up 
quite fast with thoughtful sequence 
of placements. It also eliminates 
a possibility of a runaway winner, 
because one cleverly added tile to 
the wall can bring in enough points 
to catch up, even in the last round. 
Winning in Azul depends entirely on 
the player and the set of decisions 
they make during the game.
Tis is not to say that Azul lacks 
player interaction and opponents 
cannot inﬂuence each other’s moves. 
In the drafting stage of the game it is 
quite easy to steal tiles form under 
an opponent’s nose or, alternatively, 
leave them with tiles they do not 
want. Tis confrontation is most 
pronounced in a two-player game, 
where Azul turns into a tense chess-
like game of push-and-pull between 
the players.
Despite the simplicity of its 
mechanics, Azul’s rules can feel 
ﬁddly and confusing, especially with 
its scoring. Azul is the type of game 
that will ‘click’ after playing it once, 
and the second time going players 
will make more strategic and better-
informed decisions. Luckily, one 
game of Azul, even with four people, 
lasts about half an hour, so it is very 
easy to play just one more.
Azul is everything one would 
want from an abstract game; it looks 
instantly beautiful on the table 
and its gameplay is challenging 
and addictive. Te game is really 
good at rewarding players for their 
thoughtful mo ves and placements, 
and, despite one minor luck 
element, there is a real breadth of 
choice and decisions to be made 
throughout the game. 
Breathtakingly beautiful and tactically 
exciting, Azul will be a great addition 
to any board game shelf. While its 
premise is seemingly mundane, this is 
a game unlike any other.

TRY THIS IF

CASTLES OF 
BURGUNDY
Like Stefan Feld’s 
ﬁef-building Euro 
classic, Pulsar 
combines dice 
drafting with limited 
action selection 
and a wide array of 
action choices to 
fantastic eﬀect. 
WHAT’S IN 
THE BOX?
◗  Star cluster board
◗  Dice board
◗ Gyrodyne board
◗ Die modiﬁer board
◗  Six double-sided 
technology boards
◗  Four HQ boards
◗ 24 transmitter tiles
◗  17 planetary

◗ 12 four-cube tokens
◗ 120 player tokens

ith its central, circular star 
cluster board and curving 
peripheral mats – including 
a stack of technology boards that trail 
pleasingly out like the tail of a comet – 
Pulsar 2849 certainly looks the cosmic-
energy-harnessing business. So much 
so, it’s initially rather overwhelming. 
Planetary system tiles, colour-
themed interstellar routes, a dice board, 
pulsar-power-harnessing gyrodynes, 
modular transmitters, die modiﬁer 
tokens and tracks for both engineering 
(which rewards cubes that in turn 
reward a bonus die) and initiative (aka 
turn order) – not to mention player-
mat HQs with their own pyramidically 
arranged extra actions – mean the ﬁrst 
few plays will need to be approached 
carefully and with much reference 
to the rulebook. But once you start 
rolling (literally, as Pulsar’s driven by 
dice drafting), you’ll gradually come to 
appreciate the absorbing theme and 
ﬁne-tuned balance that lie beneath the 
pretty-but-bewildering surface. 
After a couple of quaintly humorous 
games (2011’s Last Will and 2015’s Te 
Prodigal’s Club), designer Vladimír 
Suchý has returned to the more 
epic territory of his earlier titles, like 
Shipyard (2009) and 20th Century 
(2010). Except, for the ﬁrst time, he’s 
gone sci-ﬁ rather than historical, 
pitting players against each other in 
the galactic equivalent of a gold rush 
(the date in the title is deliberately a 
millennium after the famous 1849 
Californian scramble for gold). It’s not 
shiny metal you’re after but interstellar 
energy generated by pulsars, which you 
race to reach before your competitors, 
before constructing immense 
gyrodynamic generators (or gyrodynes) 
and setting them spinning. It might 
help to build a few energy transmission 
arrays to help distribute this energy to 
all the planets you’ve discovered and 
established stations on. 
Every possible action (there are tons 
to choose from, varying from game 
to game depending on your layout) is 
determined by the result of a die roll, 
with seven tossed at the start of each 
of the game’s eight rounds in a two- to 
three-player bout and nine with four 
people. You can only select two dice 
each per round (plus possible bonus 
dice, whose value you quickly come to 
appreciate), so you have to think extra 
carefully about those choices.
Suchý rather smartly adds another 
level of decision-making; with a 
median value attached to each round’s 
roll, picking a low  number provides 
you with a mitigating bonus move up 
one of the two aforementioned tracks. 
For example, taking a one could push 
you into pole position for receiving 
enough engineering cubes to 
purchase a high-numbered bonus die 
on a future turn. In contrast, going for 
a sweet high number moves you back, 
with possible penalties to your victory 
point tally at the end of each round. 
Like all good Euros there are 
multiple routes to victory and 
minimal take-thatiness. Even if 
someone snatches a die you were 
craving, you have many other options; 
and besides, you’ll likely have a handy 
modiﬁer token you can use. 
It’s impressively elegant, and each 
replay allows whole new strategies to 
be explored. Like the black hole that sits 
at the hub of that attractively cornerless 
board, it will utterly suck you in. 
A triumphant, innovative blend of 
mechanism and theme; whether 
you dig racing spaceships, exploring 
systems or constructing immense 
moneymaking structures, Pulsar 2849 
delivers in space-spades.

Build an empire in a ﬂash with this elegant strategy game
    
SID MEIER’S CIVILIZATION: A NEW DAWN
TRY THIS IF YOU LIKED… CLASH OF CULTURES
With its smartly-crafted gameplay, A New Dawn condenses the strategy and 
feeling of weighter empire-builders into a mere fraction of the time. 
WHAT’S IN 
THE BOX?
◗ Eight leader sheets
◗ 16 map tiles
◗ Event dial
◗ 80 focus cards
◗ Four tech dials
◗  16 city-state 
diplomacy cards
◗  16 player

cities, caravans)
◗ 32 resource tokens
◗  Nine barbarian tokens
◗ 34 trade tokens
◗ Two six-sided tokens
◗ Four focus bars
D
espite its suggestive title, 
A New Dawn bears little in 
common with the two previous 
board game adaptations of Sid Meier’s 
popular strategy series. Nor does it 
share much DNA with the classic 
Avalon Hill Civilization that originally 
inspired the PC game franchise. 
Te main surprise for fans of epic 
empire-building favourites such as 
Trough the Ages, Clash of Cultures 
or Civilization will be that A New 
Dawn isn’t a multi-hour marathon of 
complex technology trees (a system 
that the original Civ pioneered), 
micro-management and gradual 
cultural evolution from the beginning 
of humanity to the modern age and 
beyond. A New Dawn can be learnt, 
played and packed away in well under 
two hours – a feat rarely heard of in 
this genre.
Despite its relatively short length, 
the game ticks almost all of the 
boxes you’d expect from a quality 
civ-builder. Tere’s the expansion 
of territory, advancement of tech, 
forging (and breaking) of diplomatic 
bonds and option for direct conﬂict 
when the need arises. It’s just all been 
elegantly condensed and streamlined 
into a game that – while perhaps 
not as deep as the heavyweights – 
manages to occupy a very comfortable 
space as a still meaty ﬁller.
What makes the game particularly 
pacey is the decision to make each turn 
consist of a single action, rather than 
covering every element of running an 
empire at once. One turn you might 
choose to attack nearby barbarians 
(which randomly move and respawn 
between the players' turns) or conquer 
a city-state; the next you might instead 
focus on expanding your territory 
by placing more control tokens or 
advancing your caravans across the 
map to establish diplomacy and trade 
with your neighbours. Tis not only 
helps those less familiar with the 
multifaceted strategy of empire-builders 
understand what’s going on, but also 
keeps everyone engaged as control 
quickly bounces between players.
Te vast majority of actions are 
dictated by ﬁve cards in a focus bar 
representing the broad strategic 
pillars, which are reset to the back of 
the queue after they’re used. Waiting 
to use a card makes it more powerful 
(greater combat strength, more tech 
points, the ability to expand into 
tougher terrain and so on), making the 
main tension of the game more akin to 
a tight hand management card game 
than a traditional strategy board game.
Te ﬁve cards can be upgraded by 
gathering enough tech points, but 
there’s no ﬁxed linear progression – a 
starting card can be replaced with 
the most advanced version without 
needing to go through the two 
stages between. Tis keeps up the 
momentum and avoids funneling 
players down a particular play style, 
but it does detract from the typical 
satisfaction of watching your empire 
progressively advance through the 
eras, leaving things feeling a little 
more thematically disjointed. Te 
victory conditions are similarly less 
clear-cut, requiring three random 
achievements spread across the 4X 
spectrum rather than presenting the 
chance to win with a singular focus.
On the whole, A New Dawn looks 
great, with a fantastic modular map 
and plastic miniatures for cities and 
caravans, supplemented by basic 
but easily-read counters that slightly 
abstract a kind of combined worker-
warrior presence. Although one of 
the game’s strengths is its relative 
simplicity and most of the rules are 
communicated by the cards, some of 
the speciﬁc details (what you get for 
defeating a barbarian, what’s gained 
from trading with a city-state) will 
require referring back to the rulebook 
– at least until you’ve memorised 
them, which admittedly doesn’t 
take long. Each starting faction has 
a diﬀerent unique skill and starting 
order, giving just enough of a sense of 
distinctness between them. 
A New Dawn packs so much of the 
satisfaction of a far heavier and longer 
game into its comparatively modest 
oﬀering. It’s not a replacement for 
the grand epics of the genre, but it’s 
a brilliant option for those looking 
for an experience that still feels 
meaningful and engaging but could 
be played in a lunchtime. 
While it doesn’t have quite the same 
sense of grandeur as the classics 
in the genre, A New Dawn is a 
streamlined and satisfying empire-
builder that manages to do a lot with a 
little. It’s a perfect gateway option for 
strategy newcomers and a pleasing 
ﬁller for diehard fans.

Fifth Edition levels up in its ﬁrst major expansion
D&D: XANATHAR’S 
GUIDE TO EVERYTHING
TRY THIS IF YOU LIKED… D&D: PLAYER’S HANDBOOK
While you certainly don’t need XGtE to play the latest edition of D&D, its 
additions and clariﬁcations mean it's deﬁnitely worth grabbing a copy if you can. 
I
t can be a little tricky to describe 
what Xanathar’s Guide to Everything 
(XGtE) represents. Te core of the 
book is a wealth of new options for 
building and playing Dungeons & 
Dragons characters, but there are 
also clariﬁcations or reﬁnements of 
existing rules, as well as fresh advice 
on encounter- and campaign-building 
far beyond what you would expect of a 
simple supplement.
In many ways the slightly 
unfocused air of XGtE is a reﬂection 
of how modern games – both tabletop 
and digital – are no longer static 
products, eternally ﬁxed at version 1.0. 
It was clearly shaped by community 
feedback and directly addresses many 
of the questions and concerns that 
regularly crop up in Reddit threads 
and Twitter feeds.
Sometimes this means clearing 
up ambiguous rules, such as setting 
out the penalties for sleeping in 
armour or determining whether 
player characters can tell what spell 
an enemy mage is casting. Mostly, 
however, it involves setting out a 
whole load of new rules for sub-
classes, equipment and spells.
Even these new options are based 
around what the D&D community has 
been looking for – or, at least, what 
the most vocal part has been looking 
for. Many of the character options 
are designed to take routes that some 
players felt were missing from the 
initial release, such as a ‘death’ cleric 
that focuses on helping the fallen rest 
for good rather than turning them into 
cackling zombies.
Tere’s also been a real focus on 
letting players translate some less 
traditional fantasy archetypes from 
their head to the tabletop without the 
need for reﬂavouring or house-ruling 
existing content. For example, with 
the inquisitive rogue sub-class you 
can now create a Sherlock Holmes-
esque investigator with an eye for 
detail and a ﬁghting style based 
around reading enemy movements, 
while new spells allow brawny 
warrior-wizards to mix it up in close 
combat and still pump out damage.
Barring one or two missteps – the 
designers have already acknowledged 
that some groups may want to house-
rule an ultra-eﬃcient healing spell 
– the new character options presented 
in XGtE are great fun and slot snugly 
into the existing ruleset.
In many ways, the fact that the new 
rules feel fun without seeming over-
powered is perhaps the book’s biggest 
success of all. 
Major RPGs such as D&D tend to 
suﬀer from a phenomenon known 
as ‘power creep’. Tis is where the 
developers feel the need to push out 
new content – classes, races, magic 
items and so on – that begins to 
eclipse the earlier options in terms 
of raw power or usefulness. D&D's 
ﬁfth edition has thus far steered well 
clear of this problem and has showed 
considerable restraint in terms of new 
supplements but, as XGtE is arguably 
the ﬁrst major content update, many 
veterans were keeping an eye out for 
the telltale signs of the creep.
For the most part, this doesn’t 
seem to be a problem. Tere are a 
few things that appeal to the power 
gamers out there, but this is always 
going to be the case and none of them 
seem to make any existing abilities or 
characters completely obsolete.
Indeed, plenty of the content 
doesn’t have any impact on the 
gameplay whatsoever, such as a guide 
for generating character backstories 
or long tables of random names for 
the DM to consult when players insist 
on speaking to everyone in the tavern.
Te best way to describe XGtE, 
perhaps, is that it upgrades your 
experience to D&D 5.1. It’s a huge 
content update that tweaks things 
here and there, presented with all the 
usual top-notch design and writing 
work we’ve come to expect from the 
D&D team. Arguably some of the rules 
clariﬁcations should be presented 
as errata or an update to the existing 
core books rather than requiring you 
to buy a new one, but when that’s the 
biggest complaint going you know you 
have a success on your hands. 
It’s a little on the pricey side for 
what you get, but Xanathar’s Guide 
to Everything is an excellent way to 
upgrade your group’s Dungeons & 
Dragons experience.

Take a relaxing walk through the woods in search of 
treasure with the creator of Agricola
INDIAN SUMMER
TRY THIS IF YOU LIKED… BÄRENPARK
If you prefer the woods without bears shitting in them, Indian Summer is a 
more elegant and less numeric exploration of a similar tile-placing mechanic.
WHAT’S IN 
THE BOX?
◗  Six forest ﬂoor boards
◗  Two game boards
◗  75 leaf tiles
◗  20 animal tiles
◗  32 squirrel tiles
◗  80 treasures
◗  Four backpacks 
(player aids)
◗  Berry bush
◗  Hiking shoes tile
A 
few years ago video games 
saw a strangely controversial 
new genre emerge: games in 
which you explored an environment 
and looked at things. Dubbed 
‘walking simulators’, they were a 
tranquil, meditative alternative to 
the running and gunning of big-
budget titles. Now board games are 
producing a similar genre: gentle 
games with themes so laid back 
they’re practically horizontal ﬁlled 
with elements guaranteed to give you 
warm fuzzy feelings: fallen leaves, 
autumn berries, hazelnuts, badgers, 
squirrels – and Uwe Rosenberg.
Indian Summer is the sequel to 
2015’s Cottage Garden, and the second 
part in a ‘puzzle trilogy’ of games by 
the designer of Agricola, Bohnanza 
and Patchwork. Both Cottage and 
Indian, and Patchwork too, involve 
arranging odd-shaped tiles to cover 
boards, where some of the spaces you 
cover have special eﬀects.
Here, each player gets a board 
showing part of the forest ﬂoor, 
including what the game calls 
‘treasures’: mushrooms, berries, 
feathers and nuts. Each also gets a 
hand of ﬁve tiles showing fallen leaves, 
which can be red (ﬁve squares), orange 
(four) or green (three). All the pieces 
are gorgeous. Tey’re not ﬂashy, but 
they’re beautifully harmonious and 
work together to build up a lovely 
collage of autumnal detritus. 
However, each tile also has a 
hole in it, and if you can position 
that hole over a treasure then you 
put a relevant token over the hole. 
Complete a subsection of the board 
and you can claim every token on it. 
Complete a particular arrangement 
of holes and you can cover them 
with an animal tile, which gives you 
more tokens and makes your board 
even prettier. First to ﬁll their board 
ends the game, but there are some 
special conditions that may snatch 
the victory from you and shatter your 
inner calm.
Two styles of play become obvious 
quickly. You can arrange leaves, 
tokens and the occasional animal 
in a pleasing fashion, and Indian 
Summer is great for that. It’s a lovely, 
very satisfying game to play. Its theme 
of having a walk through the woods 
doesn’t quite ﬁt, but you’ll feel you’re 
doing well right up to the moment 
you lose, and you won’t really care 
because it’s the kind of game where 
you can swap nuts for squirrels to ﬁll 
holes in your pattern. It’s just nice.
Or you can realise the way to win 
is using the treasures eﬀectively, 
because each one can be spent for an 
advantage – reﬁlling your hand early, 
taking other players’ tiles and so on 
– and you can spend more than one 
each turn. If every player twigs this, the 
game stops being a nice walk through 
the forest and becomes a frantic sprint 
trying to avoid muggers. Tis is Indian 
Summer’s true form, and where you’ll 
have most fun on replays.
Tere’s also a solo-play ruleset, 
where the ‘puzzle trilogy’ earns its 
name. You have just ten turns to ﬁll 
your board, and it is properly hard.
Indian Summer is the child of 
Patchwork and the sibling of Cottage 
Garden, but its mechanics are more 
elegant (though twiddly in places), its 
gameplay more holistic and its charm 
more obvious. It is not a truly great 
game – if you already own one of its 
relatives then don’t feel you have to 
have this – but, for the connoisseur, 
watching a master designer work 
through variations on a theme is a 
true pleasure. 
The core gameplay is nothing new, but 
this is not the same game as Cottage 
Garden and its bucolic theme hides 
tactical depth. Not many games make 
you ask yourself whether you should 
risk shattering the tranquility around 
the table by grabbing the win.

In space, no one can hear you laugh. 
But you probably won’t.
CLANK! IN! SPACE!
TRY THIS IF YOU LIKED… CLANK!
Clank! In! Space! takes the underlying mechanical pinnings of Clank! and 
provides some new elements to play with in its futuristic sci-ﬁ setting.
WHAT’S IN 
THE BOX?
◗  Modular board
◗  180+ cards
◗  80+ tokens
◗  Market board
◗  Five power crystals
◗  Player cubes, 
markers and pawns
◗  Boss cubes, marker 
and cloth bag
2
016’s Clank! combined 
Dominion-style deckbuilding 
with dungeon-crawling fantasy, 
with players sneaking through 
subterranean caverns, stealing 
priceless treasures and avoiding the 
ire of a justiﬁably angry dragon. It 
generated considerable buzz online, 
and now it’s spawned a sci-ﬁ sequel, 
Clank! In! Space!, which swaps swords 
and spells for lasers and lightsabers.
At its core, the follow-up will feel 
familiar to anyone who’s played games 
like Star Realms or Marvel Legendary. 
You start with a handful of low-powered 
cards, adding new, more impressive 
ones to your deck with each passing 
round. Clank! In! Space! builds on the 
deckbuilding formula, though, with 
a board representing a space station; 
you use the cards in your hand to 
explore its twisting maze of corridors, 
conveyor belts and teleporter pads in 
search of high-tech goodies to pilfer.
Like its predecessor, the game’s 
biggest hook is its emphasis on 
stealth. As you move around the 
board you generate noise, represented 
by cubes in each player’s colour. Tese 
go into an ominous black bag and 
can prove fatal when Lord Eradikus, 
the station’s commander, attacks at 
random intervals throughout the 
game. When that happens, you draw 
some cubes from the bag, with players 
taking damage whenever one of their 
own appears. Bigger, more eﬀective 
moves generate more noise, meaning 
you can never be sure whether 
an audacious play will earn you a 
glorious victory – or a splattery death.
It adds drama to proceedings, but it 
also introduces an element that’s been 
virtually abandoned in modern game 
design: player elimination. Suﬀer too 
much damage and you’ll be knocked 
out of the race. Escape before your 
rivals and you’ll be sidelined while 
they ﬁnish the game without you. 
In either case, you’ll be reduced to a 
secondary role, pulling cubes from the 
bag of doom to inﬂict additional pain 
on your remaining opponents.
It’s not particularly entertaining, and it 
isn’t the only place where the game shows 
some rough edges. Its deckbuilding 
element comes with a decent 
assortment of strategies to discover, 
but little that other games haven’t done 
already. Te nerdy sense of humour, 
which incorporates tongue-in-cheek 
references to everything from Star Trek 
to Hitchhiker’s Guide, suﬀers from the 
Munchkin problem of losing its comedic 
punch after your ﬁrst playthrough.
Te game does manage to create an 
atmosphere of ramping tension, with 
boss attacks getting deadlier over time. 
Its combination of clever cardplay and 
board-based thievery also throws up 
some interesting problems to solve, 
and for fans of the original Clank! , this 
deep-space reimagining oﬀers some 
tweaks on its predecessor’s blueprint.
But if you’re in the market for a 
deckbuilding board game, you aren’t 
short of choices – and Clank! In! Space! 
does little to elevate itself above the 
middle of the pack. 
Clank! In! Space! creates some tricky 
logistical puzzles and its bag-building 
damage system makes for some tense 
moments, but it’s hampered by player 
elimination, a deckbuilding system that 
oﬀers little new for experienced players 
and an over-reliance on pop culture in-
jokes that quickly becomes grating.

A royal occasion to celebrate
QUEENDOMINO
WHAT’S IN 
THE BOX?
◗ Four starting tiles
◗ Four 3D castles
◗ Eight king meeples
◗ 48 dominoes 
◗ 32 building tiles
◗ Builder’s board
◗ 22 knight meeples
◗ 15 towers
◗ Queen meeple
◗ Dragon meeple
◗ 42 coins
◗ Scoring pad
D
escribed by creator Bruno 
Cathala himself as the game he 
wanted to play after hundreds 
of Kingdomino matches, Queendomino 
evolves the Spiel des Jahres winner’s 
simple kingdom-laying game with the 
abilities to construct buildings, tax 
your lands and even play host to the 
eponymous royal.
Te basics remain the same as 
in Kingdomino: players connect 
dominoes to their grid, before 
reserving their next tile (and deciding 
the following turn’s order) by popping 
their king down on one of the next 
four tiles. Te bulk of players’ points 
are still earned from multiplying 
the number of connected matching 
squares by the number of crowns in 
that territory – but there are several 
new aspects to consider, too. 
Te order in which players take their 
turn is even more important here, as it 
grants ﬁrst dibs on the available row of 
building tiles, which can be constructed 
on a vacant red space by spending 
coins. Tese buildings blow open the 
strategy of Kingdomino’s straightforward 
tile arrangement with the chance 
to gather bonus points for each 
individual territory, knight or tower 
– with the greatest number of towers 
resulting in a visit from the queen, who 
lowers costs and adds another score 
multiplier at the end of the game.
Knights are used as a simple way 
of collecting income by earning 
tax based on the size of a speciﬁc 
territory, but their limited numbers 
mean that careful planning is needed 
to juggle acquiring valuable buildings 
without ﬁnding yourself unable to 
act in later rounds. Tis tension is 
increased by the way that buildings 
on the board decrease in cost as other 
structures are built, meaning that 
holding oﬀ on purchasing a tile – and 
hoping your opponents don’t take it in 
the meantime – can be crucial.
Te expanded number of ways 
to gather points outside of just 
having the biggest territories means 
there’s more opportunity for closer 
competition and routes to victory – 
something sure to please those who 
felt Kingdomino was overly simplistic.
Te race to construct certain 
buildings ﬁrst and compete for the 
favours of the queen adds a few 
more layers of player interaction to 
the game on top of the fundamental 
selection of dominos – especially in 
the way that the dragon can be coaxed 
from its cave to burn down one of the 
available buildings, leaving a gap in 
the row for the remainder of the round 
and allowing a player to watch their 
rivals’ plans go literally up in ﬂames.
Te added rules do mean that 
there’s a little more score-keeping 
to do at the end of a match, often 
resulting in a minute or two of maths. 
Luckily, this is ably helped along by 
the included score pad, which does 
a fantastic job of breaking down the 
various sums in a way that avoids 
the momentum hitting a wall. To be 
honest, the only possible criticism of 
the set we can see is that the adorable 
3D castles seem to be just a smidge 
too small for the queen meeple to sit 
within while in residence.
Queendomino builds on 
Kingdomino’s foundation in a way that 
feels just right. Te queen, knights, 
dragon and buildings are a natural ﬁt 
for the charming fantasy world (which 
continues to look eye-wateringly 
gorgeous) and avoid tipping the 
gameplay complexity scales too far or 
stretching the 20-minute play time past 
its breaking point. Te rules can still 
be learnt by adults and children alike 
in a couple of minutes, but it feels like 
deepening the scope of the domino-
laying treasure has taken it from being 
one of the best releases of 2016 to 
becoming a gaming classic for all time. 
Expanding a brilliant idea with just 
a dash more complexity and depth, 
Queendomino is an utter joy to play. 
The new buildings and scoring rules 
are a natural ﬁt without diluting the 
pure strategy that made Kingdomino 
such a pleasure, conﬁrming the tile-
layer’s rightful rule on its throne.

Raxxon, Raxxoﬀ
RAXXON
TRY THIS IF YOU LIKED… DEAD OF WINTER
While Dead of Winter is undeniably superior in both gameplay and its use of theme, 
if you are yearning for more games in that universe, Raxxon can scratch that itch.
WHAT’S IN 
THE BOX?
◗ Six character sheets
◗ Game board
◗ 60 population cards
◗ 40 Raxxon cards
◗ 60 action tokens
◗  Raxxon power token
R
iding on Dead of Winter’s success 
Plaid Hat Games has come up 
with a new game set in the same 
universe. Raxxon is a Wayland-Yutani 
or Umbrella Corporation equivalent 
based in the Dead of Winter universe; it 
is the evil corporation responsible for the 
zombie outbreak, hiding behind a fake 
mask of being a progressive technological 
saviour. In this co-operative game, 
players are trying to identify the healthy 
population among the infected and safely 
rescue them from the city.
On paper, everything about Raxxon 
sounds exciting and interesting. Players 
select their characters, each with a set of 
available actions that are similar overall, 
but with some intricate diﬀerences. 
Every good deed triggers a set of not-so-
good and sometimes even disastrous 
consequences on the following turn, 
requiring players to carefully weigh the 
beneﬁts of their actions against possible 
bad outcomes every round. Te second 
main element of the game is a grid of 
citizens, among which the healthy and 
infected are hiding. Here there is another 
push-your-luck element, as cards have 
diﬀerent eﬀects upon being turned 
over. For example, when two ‘hostile’ 
cards are face-up, another card has to be 
revealed or, upon discovering ‘chaotic’ 
within the crowd, an extra card is added 
to the grid. So, as much as one might be 
inclined to turn over every card on the 
grid before committing to any strategy, 
revealing cards carelessly can lead to dire 
outcomes. Of course, this would not be 
a game in the Dead of Winter lineage if it 
did not have special cards – here called 
Raxxon cards – that present players with a 
scenario and a set of choices to make. 
Te world that Raxxon paints seems 
comprehensive and logical. It has a 
human and a story element with the 
scenario cards, and the push-your-luck 
mechanics are well placed within the 
game. Yet, somehow, Raxxon manages 
to be just slightly oﬀ in all of its elements, 
ﬁring wide of its aim at ‘challenging’ to 
land squarely on ‘frustrating’. 
Raxxon cards only trigger when 
a certain set of events has occurred, 
meaning they almost never do. Tis 
in turn throws oﬀ the balance of the 
consequences on the player’s mat, 
because choosing an action that will 
require them to take a Raxxon card feels 
less like a bad outcome and more like 
'whatever, it won’t trigger anyway’.
Te game also lacks a feeling of 
achievement. Typically, during the round, 
a few healthy citizens will be saved, some 
infected will be put into the quarantine 
– which means they will return to the 
game in a few rounds – and a mixture of 
cards will be ‘killed oﬀ’ , which also means 
they will eventually return to the game. 
Tere is a constant cycle of the same set of 
cards, where players make small changes, 
weeding out the good ones from the mix 
every so often, but otherwise not doing 
anything else of signiﬁcance. 
Te more healthy cards that are taken 
oﬀ the board, the higher the probability 
of revealing infected cards and hence 
triggering bad outcomes. Tat element 
of challenge is what might keep some 
people coming back to Raxxon in an 
attempt to beat it, especially as the game 
has several levels of diﬃculty. But when 
things go bad, they quickly turn to being 
disastrous, and attempts to prevent it feel 
like trying to hold back an avalanche. 
You could be playing a round knowing 
that you have already lost; aware that one 
wrong turn, one bit of sour luck, will end 
the game immediately. However, as you 
have not technically triggered the game’s 
end, you persevere, diligently taking 
your actions until there are no more 
options left and you have, predictably, 
lost. Tis comes with a certain feeling of 
hopelessness which, while thematically 
appropriate, is not enjoyable in a co-
operative setting. 
Raxxon builds on the base of an 
excellent theme with some really good 
ideas and push-your-luck elements. 
Even a slight balance change and minor 
rules adjustments could easily transform 
Raxxon into a very good game. For now, 
however, the main reason to pick it up is 
the bonus Dead of Winter cards that come 
in the box. 
Raxxon deﬁnitely has some interesting 
ideas, especially in its push-your-luck 
mechanics, but it forgets that tough 
games also need to be fun and rewarding.

◗ Six hero dashboards

sheet pads
◗ Six coloured bases

W
ho doesn’t love a good, 
old-fashioned dungeon 
bash? If you’re the kind of 
person who likes answering rhetorical 
questions, and your answer to that one 
was “Me, actually,” then you’ll probably 
want to skip Massive Darkness. 
Otherwise, keep reading: you may be 
in for a bloodletting treat. 
Tis latest CMON/Guillotine Games 
big-box oﬀering is the Zombicide 
gang’s stab at doing a straightforward 
high-fantasy hack ‘n’ slash adventure, 
featuring characters (wizard, ranger, 
barbarian) as stock as the monsters 
(goblins, orcs, giant spiders). Its 
particular similarity to Zombicide: 
Black Plague is undeniable, right down 
to the ‘spot the diﬀerence’ box art. But, 
as you might expect, it also draws from 
the likes of Descent (though this is pure 
co-op) and Super Dungeon Explore 
– albeit without the swollen-headed 
chibi stylings. 
Tere are no real surprises during 
the unboxing. Lavishly-illustrated 
modular tiles? Check. Impressive 
minis? Check. A cascade of multi-
coloured dice? Check. Numerous 
item, monster and event cards? 
Check, check, check. As in Black 
Plague, each player gets a nifty, card-
couching plastic dashboard, complete 
with peg holes to track health and XP 
– though spending that XP requires a 
bit of old-school pencil-and-papering, 
as each class (tanky Paladin of Fury, 
roguish Bloodmoon Nightrunner, 
DPS-ﬂavoured Pit Fighter Berserker 
and so on) comes with a box-checking 
sheet pad on which to mark your skill-
up choices. 
Te gameplay unfolds either in 
normal mode (where each session’s a 
standalone run) or the tougher story 
mode: a non-legacy campaign that 
slows progress to a gelatinous cube’s 
pace by reducing experience gains by 
a factor of ﬁve. As you’d expect, every 
scenario is about tackling wave after 
wave of foe, while looting and item-
managing like crazy.
Te only big twist – and it’s a neat 
one – is the ‘Shadow Mode’ concept. 
Every character has special abilities that 
only trigger in the dark, as deﬁned by 
the art on those beautifully-designed 
tiles. Tis allows for some intuitive 
strategies to play out; strike from, or 
retreat into, the unlit murk and you gain 
an advantage over your enemies.
What really elevates Massive 
Darkness above much of its dungeon-
crawly brethren is the way designers 
Raphaël Guiton, Jean-Baptiste Lullien 
and Nicolas Raoult have taken the 
formula and reﬁned it into to a 
satisfyingly sleek experience. Te 
menu of actions is short without 
being restrictive. Movement and 
line of sight is quick and intuitive, 
with large-squared ‘zones’ replacing 
small grids or hexes. Combat is swift, 
maths-light and blissfully stat-free, 
with attack and defence dice tossed 
simultaneously. Item pickups are 
entertainingly generous; so much so, 
you’ll ﬁnd yourself often taking the 
game’s ‘transmute’ action to trade 
up three bits of loot for a single new, 
improved item. Each game levels-up 
as a whole as you progress from tile to 
tile, rather than each character dinging 
individually – which sounds clumsy, 
but really works. 
Tinking about it, even if you did 
answer “Me, actually” above, Massive 
Darkness might just win you over. Go 
on, give it a bash.

Te horror hit swaps ghouls and 
ghosts for Dungeons & Dragons
BETRAYAL AT BALDUR’S GATE
TRY THIS IF 
YOU LIKED… 
BETRAYAL AT 
HOUSE ON 
THE HILL
Even if you’re not 
a Dungeons & 
Dragons diehard, 
there’s plenty to 
like in this set of 
50 new haunts. 
WHAT’S IN 
THE BOX?
◗ Traitor’s Tome
◗ Secrets of Survival
◗ 42 tiles
◗  Elfsong Tavern/
inner chamber/
kitchen start tile
◗  Catacomb landing/
kitchen basement 
start tile
◗  Six pre-painted plastic 
adventurer ﬁgures
◗  Six two-sided 
character cards
◗ 30 plastic clips
◗ Eight dice
◗ Turn/damage track
◗ 86 cards
◗ 215 tokens
B
etrayal at House on the Hill 
is the tabletop equivalent 
of a horror B-movie; often 
inconsistent in gameplay, pacing and 
tone, its haunts where one player is 
revealed as a surprise traitor and turns 
against their former companions 
are an acquired taste best enjoyed 
for their silly fun and schlocky self-
awareness rather than earnestly. 
In many ways, the original game’s 
exploration of a haunted manor – 
complete with one-oﬀ events and items 
– was reminiscent of a lighthearted 
Dungeons & Dragons campaign where 
the DM and scenario are only decided 
once the ectoplasm hits the fan.
Betrayal at Baldur’s Gate takes the 
natural step of relocating Betrayal 
to the streets, shops and catacombs 
of D&D’s iconic city, recasting 
its paranormal investigators as 
adventurers doing battle against some 
of the storied RPG’s various creatures.
To ﬁt with the now explicit 
roleplaying inspiration, Betrayal’s 
mechanics have been evolved with 
some notable changes. Not least is 
the addition of powers to its cast of 12 
selectable characters, who hit all of the 
D&D tropes you’d hope for – you can 
even cast Magic Missile.
A few of the background mechanics 
have been tweaked, too, in an eﬀort 
to lessen some of the divisive balance 
issues often derided by Betrayal’s 
detractors. Biggest of all is a rethinking 
of the way that haunts are activated – 
instead of rolling six dice (with 0, 1 and 
2 results) and triggering a haunt when 
the total is lower than the number of 
revealed omen cards, players now roll a 
number of dice equal to the number of 
omens in play and only begin the haunt 
once they roll a six or higher. It means 
that setting oﬀ a haunt prematurely 
while the players are still gathering items 
and revealing the map is far less likely, 
but it does detract from the tension 
somewhat by negating the ﬁrst couple 
of rolls – although there’s nothing 
stopping you playing by the old rules.
Te components – another one of 
Betrayal’s weak spots – have likewise 
been improved. Te dreaded stat 
clips do make a return, but have been 
subtly altered to stop them sliding 
straight oﬀ the edge of character 
cards – easily one of the original 
game’s most frustrating aspects. Te 
pre-painted character miniatures 
won’t win any painting competitions, 
but for the modest price of entry the 
decoration does more than enough to 
bring the world to life.
Tere are another 50 haunts here, 
and they’re as hit-and-miss as in 
the ﬁrst Betrayal. A few fall ﬂat with 
combat-heavy dice fests and iﬀy writing, 
but there’s plenty of fun to be had in 
the mix as you run around and enjoy 
lighthearted spins on classic D&D 
themes – although it has to be said the 
outside setting with its incongruous mix 
of buildings, alleys and underground 
tunnels lacks the claustrophobic panic 
of being trapped in a haunted house 
with a potential murderer.
Perhaps the biggest shame about 
Baldur’s Gate is that the presentation 
sticks too closely to the half-and-half 
nature of its title. It feels like there’s 
a missed opportunity in keeping 
characters’ traits the same as those 
in Betrayal (speed, might, sanity 
and intelligence) rather than simply 
swapping them for D&D’s iconic 
character attributes of DEX, STR, 
CON and INT. Despite D&D-speciﬁc 
details and images, the general event, 
item and omen card icons remain 
untouched, with the Traitor’s Tome 
and Secrets of Survival books also 
sticking to their Betrayal roots – would 
it have been too much to ask for a fun 
play on the Player’s Handbook and 
Dungeon Master’s Guide?
Still, what is here is still fun enough 
if you’ve explored every corner of 
Betrayal and its expansion – or you’re 
a D&D fan looking for a fast and 
amusing reimagining of the roleplaying 
universe. At the very least, those new 
clips are almost worth it alone. 
The D&D redressing doesn’t go as 
far as it could, but the improvements 
made to Betrayal’s often inconsistent 
gameplay and components are very 
welcome – and there’s still lots of 
laughs in store.

EX LIBRIS
TRY THIS IF YOU LIKED… LORDS OF WATERDEEP
Once you have successfully domesticated owlbears, visit the village of Ex Libris 
for more magic and insightful reading – but a touch less skullduggery. 
WHAT’S IN 
THE BOX?
◗  Folding town board
◗  Double-sided 
dry-erase ‘Oﬃcial

Form’ board
◗  Dry-erase marker
◗  12 double-sided 
library tiles
◗  18 oversized 
location tiles
◗  12 standard

◗  12 special

◗  152 book cards 
(with 510 unique 
book titles)
◗ Six category cards
E
x Libris immediately taps into 
the geeky love of organising 
collections by carefully curating 
types, genres and alphabetical order, 
and, most importantly, feeling pride 
in it. In this game, players are collating 
their own library and competing with 
other aspiring book collectors for the 
honour to become Grand Librarian of 
a magical, but unnamed – yet clearly 
well-read – village. Even for those 
who might ﬁnd that type of activity 
mundane or boring, Ex Libris still 
provides a game full of charm with a 
wonderful sense of humour.
Ex Libris eﬀortlessly blends 
elements of worker placement and 
card drafting together. Players send 
their meeples around the board to 
diﬀerent places to get more book 
cards and abilities, while building 
their own library back at home base. 
As with every good library, a certain 
set of instructions must be followed; 
for example, the obvious alphabetical 
ordering and structural shelf stability. 
Even in libraries, rules were made to 
be broken, and particularly sneaky 
players can even get away with some 
of the inconsistencies if the library 
inspector does not spot them at the 
end of the game.
Ex Libris is really good at rewarding 
players for almost everything they 
do. Collected the most books from 
the ‘prominent books’ category? 
Get some points. Have very stable 
shelves? More points! Here, have 
some points for the rarest category in 
your library, too! While keeping track 
of all the bonus points might initially 
seem overwhelming, all the scoring 
elements are so seamlessly integrated 
into the actions players would be 
doing anyway that they are not at all 
hard to achieve. Te tactical choice 
within the game is to pick one or two 
of them to focus on, as well as keeping 
an eye on the types of libraries other 
collectors are making.
It is rare to ﬁnd a game that is 
such a joyful experience throughout 
– this even includes its rulebook, 
which can be a real buzzkill in most 
board games, but that isn't the 
case here. Having trudged through 
so many illogical, unnecessarily 
complicated and term-heavy 
instructions that even some of the 
best games can have, it is refreshing 
to open a rulebook that is structured 
logically and has witty well-placed 
observations that make you want to 
play the game, rather than give up on 
it. Te game components are equally 
a delight; each player chooses their 
own library, with a unique special 
ability and a matching meeple to 
suit, including a sasquatch, snowman 
and wizard meeples, and even a 
gelatinous cube. 
All 152 cards have diﬀerent book 
titles that not only match their 
respective letters and correspond 
thematically to the book category 
to which they belong, but are also 
funny. Tese include gems like Not a 
Guide Tat Won’t Help With Double 
Negatives, twin volumes Parasites 
& You and Parasites in You, An 
Incomplete Guide to Procrastination, 
and many more. Te game also 
provides a dry-wipe checklist board 
and a marker for scoring, so take that, 
tear-away scoring sheets!
Te components are generally so 
well thought-out and produced that 
one weird misstep in the design of 
the game’s worker placement tiles 
really stands out. Every tile oﬀers a 
diﬀerent power, typically described in 
white text across colourful and busy 
artwork, which is hard to see even 
when seated directly in front of the 
tile. With tiles rotating each round, it 
is hard to learn them and players have 
to keep referring to them by picking 
up and bringing them almost to their 
nose to see the text. 
Tat graphical hiccup aside, Ex 
Libris is charm in a box. Although it 
deﬁnitely has a competitive edge, it 
is one of those rare games where the 
experience of playing it is more of a 
reward than the victory points at the 
end of the game. 
Ex Libris eﬀortlessly blends tactical 
gameplay with humour and whimsy, 
while celebrating our inner geeky love 
of collecting and organising.

HUNT FOR THE RING

WHITEHALL 
MYSTERY
Hunt for the Ring 
builds on its hidden 
movement core 
with meaningful 
powers and 
fantastic use of its 
setting – perfect if 
you prefer Middle-
earth to murder.
WHAT’S IN 
THE BOX?
◗  Double-sided board
◗  Seven plastic ﬁgures 
(Nazgúl, Frodo, Gandalf, 
Lord of the Nazgûl)
◗  Ring-bearer’s screen

H
unt for the Ring is the latest 
Tolkien adaptation from two of the 
masters of capturing the author’s 
epic fantasy world of Middle-earth on 
the tabletop: War of the Ring co-creators 
Francesco Nepitello and Marco Maggi. 
Tis time, the pair has teamed up with 
hidden movement expert Gabriele Mari, 
best known for Jack the Ripper favourites 
Letters from Whitechapel and Whitehall 
Mystery, and scaled down their scope 
from simulating the entirety of the Lord 
of the Rings trilogy to focusing on just the 
opening of Fellowship of the Ring as Frodo 
and his hobbit companions attempt to 
ﬂee the pursuing Nazgûl and reach Bree 
before moving on to Rivendell.
Hunt for the Ring feels very much 
like the meeting of minds behind its 
designers’ signature games. Te tense 
pursuit and claustrophobic escapes of 
the Ripper games are here, combined 
with the dice drafting, thematic powers 
and dedication to Middle-earth lore 
seen in War of the Ring. In fact, Hunt for 
the Ring can be played as a prelude to 
War of the Ring, with the outcome of the 
game handing either the Free People or 
Shadow a starting advantage. Tat may 
sound like a hell of a commitment, but 
Hunt is nowhere near the length or 
weight of War – even if you complete 
both of its two separate chapters in 
a single sitting. (A way to save your 
progress between the halves is included.)
What Hunt does have in common with 
War is that it feels distinctly like you’re 
living through the events of Tolkien’s 
novels. As they search for ‘Baggins’, the 
Nazgûl are able to gather information 
to narrow down Frodo's potential 
location from a section of the map to 
a more speciﬁc area, before searching 
individual locations to pick up his trail 
– and key information can increase 
their power, enabling extra abilities and 
potentially unleashing the fearsome 
Lord of the Nazgûl. To help Frodo, each 
of his companions has a helpful talent, 
supplemented by ally cards and tokens 
that present the chance to distract, 
block and resist the corruption of the 
Ringwraiths and the One Ring. 
Tere’s a lot of variety in the powers 
and decisions going on, and it all feels 
true to the world of Middle-earth. Te 
Nazgûl travel faster on roads and at night, 
while Frodo must rest at the end of a 
day – or can choose to press on, but risks 
being discovered by his hunters. Te core 
gameplay is quick to pick up, and being 
found as Frodo doesn’t mean an instant 
loss, making it a relatively easy game to 
get into – like the best in the genre, the 
complexity is left to what decisions you can 
make, rather than how they are performed. 
Uniquely, Hunt for the Ring is two 
hidden movement games in one. If 
Frodo reaches Bree, the outcome sets 
up a second half where the hidden 
player switches control to Gandalf, 
while Frodo’s movement becomes an 
automated journey to Rivendell deﬁned 
by a deck of route cards. Gandalf 
serves as a sort of escort needing to 
mislead the Nazgûl for long enough to 
allow Frodo to get through and gains 
some slightly diﬀerent powers, but the 
gameplay otherwise remains largely 
the same – there’s no need to relearn 
every aspect. Te second chapter isn’t 
quite as engaging for the ‘good’ player 
as the ﬁrst given the inability to choose 
Frodo’s path, but it does make for a fun 
and interesting variant on the idea of 
hidden movement.
Hunt for the Ring isn’t a revolutionary 
entry in the hidden movement genre, but 
that doesn’t stop it being an impeccably 
well-crafted game – especially for those 
wanting to spend more time immersed 
in Middle-earth. If you can't get enough 
of the fantasy world, this is the perfect 
excuse to dive right back in. 
Hunt for the Ring absolutely nails 
its Middle-earth theme by capturing 
the same tension and drama of 
Tolkien’s novel with excellent use of its 
characters and lore. The gameplay 
isn’t necessarily world-changing, but 
it’s still a fantastic hidden movement 
experience with plenty to enjoy – 
especially if you love Lord of the Rings.

It’s all for one and everyone for themselves in this 
brain-burning game of interstellar politics
SIDEREAL CONFLUENCE: 
TRADING AND NEGOTIATION 
IN THE ELYSIAN QUADRANT
WHAT’S IN 
THE BOX?
◗  Nine faction sheets
◗  292 wooden 
resource tokens
◗  390 cards
◗  Ship, victory 
point and faction 
ability tokens
I
ts title may sound like some sort of 
embarrassing medical condition, 
but Sidereal Conﬂuence is actually a 
game of deep-space diplomacy where 
starfaring species vie to become the 
dominant faction in a cut-throat cosmos. 
While that’s hardly a novel concept, 
the game combines free-wheeling 
negotiation with complex economic 
strategy in some intriguing ways.
It rejects the militaristic ﬂavour 
of many sci-ﬁ games in favour of 
interplanetary politics. While it’s 
undeniably competitive, it encourages 
co-operation between players. 
You’ll use resources represented by 
diﬀerent coloured tokens to research 
technologies, gaining new abilities 
and victory points in the process. But 
each new discovery requires a diﬀerent 
combination of resources to unlock, 
and you won’t be able to acquire them 
without help.
During each round you’ll trade 
resources with your opponents – 
it’s here that things get interesting, 
because just about everything is up 
for grabs. You’ll exchange goods, 
planetary colonies and ﬂeets of 
spaceships, and striking deals that see 
you come out ahead while remaining 
palatable to your opponents is a subtle 
art. To complicate things further, you’ll 
also be able to make agreements that 
play out over multiple turns, or to forge 
complex trades between three or more 
players at a time.
Te really interesting bit, though? 
All of this negotiatio n happens 
simultaneously. Rather than taking 
turns to propose trades, players all pile 
in at once, with goods, promises and 
recriminations passing back and forth 
across the table like a kind of mathsy 
mosh pit. It’s hard to stay on top of it all 
and, if you’re not careful, you can ﬁnd 
yourself out of your depth and at the 
mercy of your rivals. A bit like the Brexit 
negotiations, but in space.
Each of the game’s factions comes 
with a unique set of abilities that 
lend themselves to diﬀerent tactical 
approaches. Te Faderan are cosmic 
venture capitalists, handing resources 
to other factions and cashing in 
when they use them to develop new 
technologies. Te Unity coalition 
generates valuable multi-purpose 
tokens that command a hefty price 
from other players. Te insectoid 
Kt’Zr’Kt’Rtl (pronounced exactly as 
it’s spelled) are anarchic hackers, 
shaping technologies to their needs.
Each species comes with a player 
sheet outlining their strengths and 
oﬀering some advice on how best to 
play with them. Tey also come with a 
diﬃculty rating, and some are far more 
complicated than others to get to grips 
with; this means newer players can 
pilot one of the simpler races to ease 
themselves into the game. But it also 
introduces imbalance, and how much 
can you really savour a victory if your 
opponents are playing a much harder 
faction than you?
Tere’s also the rulebook, which 
throws around in-game terms before 
explaining what they actually mean, 
and the game’s complex graphic 
design, which means that you probably 
won’t understand how everything 
works until you’ve actually played a 
few rounds.
Tat could deﬁnitely be frustrating, 
especially at a time when so many 
publishers are working to make the 
process of learning games as pain-free 
as possible. But if you’re looking for 
a mix of frantic player interaction 
and cold, cruel logic, then Sidereal 
Conﬂuence has a lot to get your teeth – 
or hideous alien mandibles – into. 
Sidereal Conﬂuence will delight some 
players and repel others. Its emphasis 
on deal-making makes for some heated 
negotiations, and its cube-pushing 
economics requires some serious 
analytical skills. But it comes with a 
convoluted setup and a punishing 
learning curve, and you should ask 
yourself whether you’re likely to enjoy it 
enough to justify the hard work it entails.

Te seed of a brilliant idea blossoms 
into a green-ﬁngered delight
PHOTOSYNTHESIS
TRY THIS IF YOU LIKED… TAK: A BEAUTIFUL GAME
A pure strategy title at its heart, Photosynthesis relies on the same back-and-
forth blocking and simply complex rules as this absolutely abstract gem. 
WHAT’S IN 
THE BOX?
◗ Game board
◗ Sun segment
◗ Four player boards
◗ First player token
◗ 24 scoring tokens
◗  Four light 
point trackers
◗  Four sun 
revolution counters
◗ 24 seed tokens
◗ 32 little trees
◗ 16 medium trees
◗ Eight big trees
P
hotosynthesis has perhaps one 
of the loveliest concepts seen 
in any game. Players act as a 
sort of stand-in for Mother Nature, 
sowing seeds that gradually grow into 
towering trees as the seasons pass, 
eventually ending their life cycle 
before new seeds spring up through 
the earth, continuing the loop.
Photosynthesis isn’t just a cute 
idea, either. Although the game looks 
absolutely gorgeous thanks to its 3D 
cardboard trees in hues of green, 
orange and blue, there’s also a core 
of pure strategy that runs through its 
trunk, leaving the gameplay as solid 
as an ancient oak.
No game about plants could truly 
ﬂourish without the sun and, true to 
its name, Photosynthesis depends on 
the star to fuel its interesting choices. 
Te sun rotates around the board 
each turn, allowing players to collect 
light points to spend on growing 
seeds and trees already on the 
board or adding more to their pool 
of potential ﬂorae. It’s an ingenious 
idea implemented with such beauty 
and simplicity it’s a wonder it’s never 
been done before – although it’s hard 
to imagine it being realised much 
better than this.
What’s even smarter is the way that 
the shifting rays begin to cast shadows 
as players’ saplings spring up through 
the ground, stopping plants caught 
in the shade of a taller tree from 
collecting light points or growing taller 
until they emerge back into the sun.
Because the spaces towards the 
centre of the board earn greater 
bounties of victory points when 
trees reach their highest point, this 
results in an intense and tight-
knit battle for sunlight as players 
carefully position their plants 
to leave each other in the dark. 
Cashing in a tree for points means 
removing it from the board, leading 
to standoﬀs between players as 
those in an advantageous position 
balance gaining points (which 
steadily decrease with each tree that 
completes the cycle in each of the 
four regions) with maintaining their 
dominance over smaller shrubs.
Te full rules about shadows 
restricting the growth of shaded trees 
are actually proposed as an advanced 
mode in the rulebook, but we found 
them to be so crucial to the game’s 
depth and enjoyment that we’d 
recommend using them from the oﬀ.
Tere’s no luck involved at all in 
the way that plants collect light points 
and the sun shifts around the edge 
of the forest, making the strategy as 
dependent on the constant sparring, 
blocks and reversals between players 
as something like chess – that just 
happens to involve seeds and trees. 
Tis also means that the game plays 
just as well in a head-to-head between 
two people, with extra opponents 
escalating the feeling of ﬁghting for 
room in a crowded wood. 
Tat said, Photosynthesis isn’t 
perfect. Te straightforward loop 
of gaining light, planting seeds, 
growing trees and collecting points 
doesn’t change up much over the 
course of the game, which can lead 
to less than satisfying repetition if the 
more engaging interactions between 
players fails to take hold. On the 
other hand, those who don’t like the 
feeling of being blocked at every turn 
by other players may ﬁnd that the 
claustrophobic competition relies a 
little too much on overly-aggressive 
play – and loses too much tension 
to stay interesting if playing with the 
trimmed-down rules.
Tese are very minor problems 
with a game that otherwise delivers 
on the promise of an intense 
abstract strategy experience 
wrapped up in a presentation that 
leaves other games in the shade. As 
it turns out, being all bark still leaves 
plenty to chew on. 
Photosynthesis doesn’t just look 
gorgeous – it also delivers plenty of 
gameplay punch with its surprisingly 
intense battle for sunlight. The simple 
yet brilliant idea at its core is beautifully 
executed, although you may ﬁnd it 
becomes a little repetitive on repeated 
visits or is a bit too hostile for less 
confrontational players.

as a gateway to miniatures games?

◗ Eight initative cards
◗ 52 tactics cards
◗ Reversible board 
◗ Custom dice
◗ Counters
◗ Tokens
◗ ID stickers
◗  Access Guide to Human Sphere
W
elcome to the future and the 
25th season of Aristeia!, a fast-
paced and brutal extreme 
sports game. You'll be playing with a team 
of four Aristos, ﬁghting and manoeuvring 
for control of the HexaDome.
Te game has four simple phases – 
planning, turns, objectives and recovery 
– with a match lasting for ﬁve rounds 
or until eight points are scored, which 
you achieve by controlling the scoring 
zone. Each player takes alternative turns 
with each of their Aristos until all of them 
have been activated. 
Each character model comes with 
a stat, initiative and four tactics cards. 
Te models come pre-assembled and of 
decent quality with plenty of details, if 
you wish to paint them. Each character 
has ﬁve action points and spends two 
to walk as many spaces as they have 
movement, which can be interrupted 
by other abilities – so you could walk 
Parvati three spaces, use her medikit, 
let rip with her submachine guns 
akimbo and then move again. Parvati’s 
versatility at ﬁghting, healing and 
removing conditions probably makes 
her the best all-rounder of the box. 
Te custom dice mechanics of rolling 
for attack and defence are very familiar, 
but with a couple twists that put Corvus 
Belli's Inﬁnity signature on them 
– which makes sense, given Aristeia! is 
set in the sci-ﬁ miniatures universe. 
Just like Inﬁnity, when you roll for an 
attack it can quickly lead to the death 
of the attacker, so it's best to remember 
Inﬁnity's 'It’s always your turn' philosophy 
and leave expert swordsman Miyamoto 
Mushashi be while he is adjacent 
because he can turn blocks into damage.
Every character has a 'switch' that 
allows them to use certain symbols 
on a dice roll to pull oﬀ a wide range 
of abilities. For example, 8-Ball’s 
switch allows the character to displace 
himself, so often you can’t attack him 
for fear of him moving into a scoring 
zone or out of a melee zone.
In the turns phase, the character 
with the highest initiative controls 
activation order. Gata is all about speed 
and starts with the highest native 
initiative in the box, but is very fragile 
with only two wounds – you can use 
this control to keep her safe from harm 
by activating her last in one round and 
then ﬁrst in the next. 
You can make a green action without 
fear of your opponent rolling any dice, 
which makes heXx3r very powerful at 
displacing both enemy and friendly 
models around the dome. When you 
use a red action it’s a damage-dealing 
attack and, as well as using switches, 
the enemy can damage the attacker by 
rolling successful hits in defence.
Each team starts with a deck of ten basic 
cards and every character adds two more 
for a full deck of 18. You start the match by 
drawing four and gain a card whenever an 
enemy model is moved to the inﬁrmary. At 
the end of a round you draw a card, plus 
an additional card if you scored that 
round. Te cards clearly state when and 
how they are used, and can be used for a 
wide variety of actions, but adding extra 
dice or free attacks are the most common 
– I lost one game due to my opponent 
adding an extra action point then 
walking straight into the scoring zone.
Aristeia! is a simple, addictive game 
that runs for around an hour and allows 
for more tactile depth as each match goes 
on. It captures the idea of a superstar 
battle arena, with heroes trading blows 
and jockeying for position rather than 
statically standing there trading blows. 
If you liked Inﬁnity's 
setting and miniatures 
but found the 300-
plus pages of rules 
too heavy, this is the 
unquestionably the 
board game for you.

Te old-school future rises
ELITE ENCOUNTERS
TRY THIS IF 
YOU LIKED… 
STAR TREK 
ADVENTURES
Sometimes 
exploring the depths 
of space can be its 
own reward.
H
ow you feel about Elite Encounte rs 
will likely be determined by one 
simple question: does the idea of 
a game with detailed rules for a bionic 
liver ﬁll you with glee? If the answer is 
yes, followed by a barrage of questions 
on exactly what stats it modiﬁes and how 
much it can be traded for, this may well 
be the RPG for you.
Like the video game series that 
inspired it, Encounters plants the players 
in the boots of explorers, ﬁghters and 
traders making their way through a rich 
sci-ﬁ world. It’s a setting where grand 
galactic politics melds with mundane 
delivery runs and encounters with space 
pirates and, while it will naturally appeal 
to fans of either the classic 1984 game or 
its more modern sequels, the game uses 
enough sci-ﬁ tropes that even newcomers 
will feel comfortable in short order.
When it comes to talking about 
the game itself, the ﬁrst thing that 
needs to be established is that this 
is not the only RPG using the Elite 
licence to come out recently. Elite: 
Dangerous, which has been developed 
by Spidermind Games, followed hot 
in Encounters’ heels and seems to be a 
rather diﬀerent experience – arguably 
a more modern one.
It’s worth noting that ‘modern’ 
does not necessarily equal ‘better’. 
Encounters has a truly old-school feel 
that permeates everything from the 
dense typeface and monochrome 
design to the tables and charts listing 
diﬀerent trade goods. Besides a 
few touches of modern design here 
and there, Encounters wouldn’t feel 
particularly out of place among the 
RPGs of the ‘80s and ‘90s.
Te main mechanic is incredibly 
simple. It only uses a handful of d6s, 
with the amount being rolled being 
determined by circumstances and stats 
and the target you need to beat relating 
to the diﬃculty of the task. In order 
to climb a rocky cliﬀ, for example, a 
player may need to roll at least one 
4+ on two or three dice depending on 
how they built their ‘avatar’, while an 
incredibly diﬃcult task may require 
them to roll a 6+ or even a 7+.
Where things start to get interesting 
is all the modiﬁers that can be added, 
depending on everything from 
equipment to experience. Tat bionic 
liver, for example, provides you with 
a bonus to ‘sense’ rolls when you’ve 
been drinking.
Diﬀerent weapons work in diﬀerent 
ways, and these can diverge even 
further once players start loading up 
on alternative ammo types that are 
neatly codiﬁed and set out in the rules. 
Likewise, ships can be completely 
customised depending on the number 
of hardpoints and systems available.
Tere is an incredible amount of 
depth on display, but Encounters is not 
the easiest RPG to pick up and play. It 
can be confusing in places and trying 
to get the entire table caught up on all 
the rules and options open to them can 
be an exercise in frustration.
If your gaming group has only 
ever dallied with modern systems, 
Encounters may come as a shock. It is 
unapologetically lo-ﬁ and old-school 
in both design and presentation, with 
the art on display seemingly culled 
from the video games themselves. Te 
layout and presentation of vital rules 
are straight from an older generation of 
products and can be confusing if your 
experiences have mostly been with 
more streamlined RPGs.
Te book was almost completely 
written and designed by just one man, 
David Hughes, and it shows – again, 
for better and for worse. It lacks polish 
but the passion and dedication to the 
world of Elite on display is inspiring. If 
you and your friends feel like a return 
to the awe and wonder you felt when 
the original game came out in 1984 
this may well spark happy memories. 
But if you just want a simple system 
for roaming about the galaxy, blasting 
aliens and having a good time it might 
be worth a miss. 
Elite Encounters is an 
unapologetically old-
school slice of space 
adventure. Whether 
that’s a good or bad 
thing is up to you and 
your gaming group.

INBETWEEN
ASSET DROP
A
lthough its gameplay was 
devised almost a year before 
Stranger Tings made its Netﬂix 
debut, it’s perhaps no coincidence that 
InBetween’s full release comes hot on 
the heels of the second season of the 
‘80s-inﬂected horror TV phenomenon; 
this is a Stranger Tings card game in 
all but name.
It’s a particularly enjoyable one, too, 
as two players take it in turns to try and 
drag the townspeople of Upsideville 
into one of two dimensions, depending 
S
ubscription boxes have become 
a booming industry in the last 
few years, so much so that they 
have now entered not only the sphere 
of tabletop gaming but also painting 
and modelling.
Asset Drop is one such miniatures-
centric subscription package, coming 
in at just under £20 a month. Each 
‘drop’ contains a variety of paints, 
brushes and more niche tools like 
pigment powders.
Something that always makes me 
wary of loot crates is their unpredictable 
nature, but Asset Drop mitigates this 
with the way it selects and presents 
the contents. Te contents of each box 
aren’t random but carefully selected to 
complement each other. For instance, 
the three shades of grey paint, from 
Secret Weapon, are perfect when used 
together as a base, layer and highlight. 
Tere’s the combination of a textured 
paint, from Coat d’Arms, and a pigment, 
on whether they’re trying to protect the 
humans or attack them as a mysterious 
being called only 'the Creature’.
Each side of the tense tug of war 
feels distinct to control; the town is able 
to utilise 28 diverse bits of equipment 
in their ﬁght to survive, while the 
Creature has a more limited pool of 
seven repeatable actions. Gameplay 
is as easy as choosing a single card to 
play, which either moves a matching 
character one step towards your 
dimension or adds a symbol to their 
card so they’ll match more cards in the 
future, making them easier to move. 
Each player can also spend energy to 
trigger special powers or set oﬀ their 
one-time-use 'awareness' ability, 
making timing crucial to coming out 
on top – it does help if you’ve played at 
least a couple of times and know some 
of the cards in the deck, too.
One of the game’s best features is the 
ring of characters that forms its main 
play area. As well as looking great, an 
from BrokenToad – both of which can 
be used individually, but can also be 
combined to great eﬀect. Tere’s even 
a Coat d’Arms basing brush included 
to make use of the textured paint, 
as it can be damaging to your usual 
brushes. Tis is something that is 
covered in the fantastic painting guide 
that comes in each box. 
Produced speciﬁcally around the 
contents of the box, each guide goes 
into a good amount of detail about the 
supplies: telling you a little about the 
company that makes them, what they 
are designed to do and how to use them.
What’s great about these write-ups 
is that they provide examples and 
pictures, but they are also surprisingly 
in-depth. Te guide included in our 
sample, on Ammo's Brass and Old 
Brass metallic paints, covered not 
only how to paint and layer with those 
speciﬁc colours but also hints and tips 
on using metallics in general. 
activity marker makes its way around 
the circle at the end of each player’s 
turn, activating the unique abilities 
of any characters who are in either 
dimension (those ‘in-between’ don’t 
do anything) which give either player a 
helping hand as they aim to devour (as 
the Creature) or secure (as the town) 
three people. Each side can also win 
by raising their awareness ﬁve times, 
which happens when the activity 
marker ends a turn on a player in either 
dimension – encouraging a heated 
back-and-forth battle to keep characters 
out of your opponent’s realm. 
InBetween pulls its thrilling head-
to-head concept oﬀ with aplomb 
thanks to a tight set of mechanics, 
fast pace and a fantastic visual style. 
In some ways it’s a shame it doesn’t 
have the Stranger Tings name 
attached – if only so more people 
would be guaranteed to pick it up 
and give it a play. 
Tis guide really helps to tie 
the whole package together; 
the result is that it really feels 
like you’re receiving a lesson 
rather than a random selection 
of paints and brushes. (Not to 
mention a lollipop – you can’t 
forget the lollipop).

Dismantle a castle to build your own in 
this stylish tile-based riﬀ on mahjong
DRAGON CASTLE
TRY THIS IF YOU LIKED… CASTLES OF MAD KING LUDWIG
If you have the bug for building castles on the tabletop, Dragon Castle brings a 
diﬀerent angle and a third dimension to your in-game architecture. 
WHAT’S IN 
THE BOX?
◗ Two main boards
◗ Four realm boards
◗ 116 plastic tiles
◗ 40 shrines
◗ 85 victory tokens
◗ Eight misc tokens
◗ 10 dragon cards
◗ 10 spirit cards
I
n games, mahjong means two 
things. It can be the classic Qing-
dynasty tile-based set-making 
game, the ancestor of rummy, or it can 
be the solitaire game, usually digital, 
where the player clears a pattern 
of tiles by ﬁnding matching pairs. 
Dragon Castle is inspired by both of 
them. What does that mean? Mostly 
that this is a heavy box, because it’s 
got 116 chunky plastic tiles in it.
In Dragon Castle the players take 
tiles from the eponymous structure, 
formed of all the tiles stacked together, 
and use them to make smaller and 
altogether less impressive castles. 
You score points for arranging tiles in 
particular ways, but these can change 
depending on which dragons and 
spirits are watching over the game, 
because each brings its own special 
abilities and scoring conditions.
You start your turn by removig 
tiles from the dragon castle – 
usually a matching pair, though 
you can take one tile and a 
shrine marker, or discard one tile 
for a victory point. Shrines are 
important because most of the 
scoring is based around them. 
Te tiles have six suits in two 
groups of diﬀerent value, and taking 
them works like the solitaire version 
of mahjong. Tis gives the game a 
puzzle dynamic, as well as being the 
only time where players can aﬀect 
each others’ play – by taking tiles that 
someone else wants. Mostly Dragon 
Castle feels like you’re each playing 
a solo game, drawing from a shared 
resource while racing to be the one who 
has built the most points at the end.
Once you have your tiles you place 
them on your realm board, aiming to 
make groups of four or more of the 
same suit, which you can ‘consolidate’ 
by ﬂipping them. Consolidated tiles 
can be built on either with more tiles, 
or with shrines. Te higher a shrine is, 
the more points it’s worth.
Te game’s strategy lies in arranging 
the tiles on your realm board, 
consolidating sets and having enough 
shrines, and this is where the game 
shines. Te pair-matching mechanic 
of taking the castle apart is a natural 
ﬁt for the components, but isn’t as 
interesting or tactical as it should be.
Te dragons and spirits with their 
unique powers are what bring the 
game alive and give it replay value, 
along with the diﬀerent ways the 
Dragon Castle can be built. Without 
them the experience is quite dry. 
Te tiles are wonderfully tactile and 
playing with them ought to be a 
pleasure, but the heart of the game 
lies elsewhere.
Dragon Castle is a good game with 
clever touches and it’s beautifully 
presented, but it lacks the elegance 
and compulsiveness of either of its 
forebears – and even though the box 
is full of mahjong tiles, it’s not a full 
set and you won’t be able to play 
mahjong with them. 
A clever and beautiful game about 
building through set-building, but 
strangely uninvolving.

M
antic adds yet another game to its 
extensive catalogue with Star Saga, 
a sci-ﬁ dungeon crawler set within 
the Warpath universe.
Te core box comes with 35 miniatures, 
representing everything from the military 
minions you’ll face to the abominations 
created by the universe’s deadly plague, and 
everything is one piece – for the most part 
they are great models, ﬁlled with details.
My only gripes are a fair amount of mould 
lines and that some of the goons, especially 
the security forces and soldiers, feel a little 
generic. Each of the hero characters and 
the bosses they face, however, are fantastic. 
Te heroes have the mixed squad feel we 
all love to see in our fantasy adventure 
games, with classic roles like the dwarf, 
elf and mage ﬁlled by the dwarf (but in 
space!), judwan and kayowan, all with 
an updated futuristic look.
For this painting guide we are 
going to take a look at how to paint 
the villains of the game. Painted up 
they really help add to the narrative 
and capture the spirit of the tale 
Mantic has created, immersing 
you in the sci-ﬁ adventure.

PAINTS USED
ZENITHAL HIGHLIGHTING
Zenithal highlighting at its core is a much more complicated 
process than what I am going to show you in this guide. I will 
show a basic version that helps apply a simpliﬁ ed version 
of highlighting. This begins at the basecoating stage, whilst 
preparing the model for the later stages.
Begin by basecoating the 
miniature black. This is easiest 
with a black spray paint.
Once the black is dry, apply a 
light spray of white from the 
top around the model. This 
will create a light element 
of highlighting and shading 
straight oﬀ  the bat that will 
either provide shading and 
highlighting in later stages or a 
guide as to where they should 
be applied. 
STAGES
Each creature is split up into four stages, each with a list 
of colours and the corresponding paint that was used 
for it. Each stage uses a diﬀ erent technique to achieve a 
similar eﬀ ect on each element but with diﬀ erent colours.
Stage 1 is base colours. Base colours are applied using a 
mix of glazes and ﬂ at colours.
Stage 2 is applying shading. In this stage we use 
various washes and glazes to add an element of 
shading to the models.
Stage 3 is highlighting. This stage involves applying a line 
of your colour along the hard edges and ridges of the 
area. I would recommend using a ﬁ ne brush and adding a 
tiny dash of water to your paints.
Stage 4 is ﬁ nal highlight. This involves adding a small dot 
or dash of a colour, generally in the same area as the 
previous highlight, but focusing on corners or where folds 
in cloth meet. For hair or fur it involves adding a dot to 
the tip of each strand. If you ﬁ nd yourself unsure of where 
to apply the highlights or spot highlights, look over the 
images alongside the guide and compare that stage to 
the last.
Stage 5 is the ﬁ nal details. This stage involves cleaning up 
and adding a few spot highlights. This stage also includes 
painting the base of the model.

W
e’ve spent a lot of time 
in this column covering 
speciﬁc ways to build 
campaigns and improve 
your DM process, but 
none of that is very useful if you don’t have a 
group of people to play with. Perhaps the most 
important skill a DM can have, in addition to 
being able to run a game well, is being able to 
entice and enthral new players. Let’s dive in!
START WITH THE BASICS
Tabletop roleplaying games like Dungeons 
& Dragons are incredibly complex aﬀairs. 
Tere’s a reason why thousands of pages 
of text go into each game’s system across 
several tomes of books, notes and rules. A 
sure-ﬁre way to overwhelm a prospective 
new player is to hand them the Player’s 
Handbook for a weekend and tell them to 
go read it in preparation. Tat’s like asking 
someone to read the entire dictionary to 
learn how to speak English.
Instead, you should slowly introduce 
concepts over time outside of a game night 
setting. Before you all gather around a 
table with dice and character sheets, chat 
about some ideas over lunch. If you’ve 
got a friend that’s never played a tabletop 
roleplaying game before just sit them down 
and do everything verbally: “You wake 
up in a dark dungeon with only rags for 
clothes. What do you do?” See where their 
imagination goes. 
Give them dice as needed for encounters 
and, by the time it’s done, they’ll likely be 
curious about where things can go next. 
Tis would be a great time to introduce 
character sheets and the concept of 
roleplaying. When you do that, make sure 
you start with pre-generated characters, 
such as those included in the D&D: Fifth 
Edition starter set.
CHECK YOUR PRIORITIES 
Above all else, the most important thing to 
remember as a DM is that players always 
come ﬁrst. Just because you’ve come up 
with this excellent idea for a challenging 
campaign that could take several months to 
complete doesn’t mean that your players will 
care or want to play it. 
Furthermore, don’t spend too long waxing 
poetic about your amazing world and unique 
If you ﬁnd yourself teaching an 
RPG newcomer – or are trying 
to roleplay for the ﬁrst 
time yourself – follow 
our tips to ensure 
the introductory 
experience 
becomes the 
ﬁrst of many

NEW PLAYERS

characters. Don’t let the focus drift towards 
the non-player characters too much. Bring 
it back and make it about the players as the 
protagonists and what they decide to do 
inside this world you’ve made.
Don’t forget that players are people. 
It might sound silly, but when you really 
get into the heat of a campaign it’s easy to 
look at yourself as the DM ﬁrst and friend 
second, but communication is vital to a 
successful RPG. 
Before the games start, take the time to 
discuss what the players want most out of 
the experience and what their goals are. 
Crafting a super-serious campaign without 
a hint of humour for a group of people that 
crack jokes constantly probably isn’t a good 
idea, for example.
SHOW, DON’T TELL 
(UNLESS YOU NEED TO)
Once you get your priorities set and 
understand your players’ comfort levels you 
can more easily identify areas where players 
can be pushed a bit outside of their comfort 
zone to try new things. When you’re DMing a 
group of mostly new players, you may ﬁnd that 
some aspects are tougher to grasp than others. 
A common example is a new player that loves 
combat often has trouble feeling comfortable 
with roleplaying out loud, especially in front 
of strangers.
So when the game is underway don’t spend 
too long explaining the rules if you want to 
make sure no-one falls asleep. Teach them the 
basics and explain the gist of it all, but wait for 
speciﬁcs until necessary. For example, don’t 
bother explaining the diﬀerence between 
attack and damage rolls until combat starts 
and don’t explain how ability scores aﬀect a 
character’s success with actions until a player 
wants to do something requiring an ability 
check or saving throw.
Once that ball starts rolling it will likely 
pick up steam very quickly. To ensure player 
experiences stay at the forefront of it all, feel 
free to bend the rules where necessary to 
encourage a fun and casual game. Players will 
appreciate something that’s fun, even if slightly 
oﬀ the rulebook, much more than they would 
blindly adhering to the game mechanics. 
As long as you follow these basic steps, you 
should be well on your way towards creating 
an open and accommodating environment for 
new players. 
Entertaining and keeping players engaged 
should come ﬁrst – even if it means 
bending the rules (Wizards of the Coast)

January 2018
Uncon took place at the same time as Essen 
over in Germany. Did this affect your plans?
Massively. I recall posting on the Board Game 
Trade + Chat Facebook page about Uncon and 
somebody informed of me the clash with Essen. 
I was very naive in my reply: “But that is in 
Germany, surely not that many people from the 
UK are travelling to Germany?” I was so wrong. 
I wish I changed the dates. I emailed and 
contacted at least 20 different game designers; 
only one of those agreed to come to Uncon. The 
others, you guessed it, went to Essen.
I promise the next one won’t clash with 
Essen! We are looking around April 2018 for 
the next Uncon.
What were some of the most popular games at 
the most recent event? How does this compare 
to past Uncons?
Terraforming Mars has been a massive hit in 
our group so that got played. Kingdomino was 
played almost continuously in the family zone. 
I also saw games such as Scythe being played. 
But above all the other games, the true star of 
the show was Rhino Hero: Super Battle! 
 
Why do you choose to host Uncon in Thanet?
I grew up in Thanet and have lived there my 
whole life. All my friends and family are here 
and I feel like Thanet deserved something 
different. People told me to go further inland, 
Canterbury or Ashford, but my heart was to 
keep this event in Thanet.
We hold a board game social every 
Monday night which is attended by 25 to 
40 guests every week, so we knew that we 
had the support. As a thank you to them, 
for helping us build such a unique gaming 
group, I wasn’t moving the event out of 
the area. 
How did the idea for Uncon emerge?
We started our first Uncon back in July 2016. It 
was originally meant to be a one-off Saturday 
for our board game group, ‘All Around the 
Board’. We enjoyed it so much that we decided 
the next time, we would do it properly. The July 
event was really just a massive usual games 
night for us, but October saw more stalls, test 
players and other activities.
 
What’s the story behind the name?
As we were halfway through the July event, 
I looked around and counted 80 people. I 
turned to my friend and said “There are 80 
people in here!” and he replied, “It is more like 
a convention!” I laughed and said, “Yeah, an 
unconventional convention.” This is where the 
name ‘Uncon’ began.
After that event, people were using the 
hashtag #uncon over social media and asking 
us “When is the next one?” After a talk with my 
partner, we agreed that we would host another 
one and try to make it more of a conventional 
convention, but kept the name ‘Uncon.’
What makes the convention stand out?
We are all about family. We are a very inclusive 
group and welcome people of all ages and abilities.
We really try to reach out to non-gamers 
and gateway gamers because it wasn’t that 
long ago that we were newcomers to the hobby 
ourselves. We really try to educate non-gamers 
that modern board gaming is much different 
and much more interesting than ever before.
We really advertised the family zone to the 
locals to try and get children from around 
our area to experience something new and 
exciting. Plus, there aren’t many conventions 
that have a five-year-old games host – our 
daughter did a really smashing job of that!

friendly Thanet convention with a five-year-old host

January 2018
You recently held an in-store gaming day 
for Mantic – the first the publisher has held 
outside of its own HQ. How did the event go? 
What did you do on the day?
Our Mantic Games day was massive. It was 
one of the best events we have ever held in-
store, with lots of demo games and exclusive 
goodies available.
What other events and gaming meetups for 
local players do you organise?
We have weekly gaming nights on Monday, 
Tuesday and Thursday.
We play everything from Star Wars and 
Warhammer 40,000 to The Walking Dead 
and Munchkin.
In January we have a Wild West Exodus day 
coming up, and in February Warlord Games 
will be joining us for a games day.
What’s the local gaming communuty 
like in Rochester?
The local gaming community is huge. As our 
gaming evenings are growing, so is the local 
interest in gaming generally.
Many of our regulars have become close 
friends and we are very lucky to have such a 
great group of customers.
When did Rochester Games, Models & Railways 
first open? How’s the shop changed since then?
The shop first opened in 2011 in Rochester High 
Street. We had a small shop which was five times 
smaller than the one we have now.
Your name suggests a focus on more traditional 
areas of the tabletop hobby, such as wargaming. 
Why is this such an interesting area for you?
Our name – Rochester Games, Models and 
Railways – says it all. We sell everything for all 
three hobbies.
Do you stock many non-wargame board games? 
How has your selection of games changed over 
the years?
We stock a big range of board games, from 
Connect Four to Poison Explosion and Firefly.
Which games have been proving particularly 
popular recently?
The Walking Dead: All Out War has been huge 
for us, as has Flames of War and Team Yankee.
What upcoming releases are you looking 
forward to this year?
Star Wars: Legion is certainly one to watch 
this year.
We are always inspired by our customers and 
forever grateful for their loyalty and business. 
They have helped us to build upon a dream that 
without them would not have been possible.
What are your future plans for Rochester 
Games, Models & Railways for the rest of 
2018 and beyond?
Rochester Games, Models & Railways will 
always be expanding. Eventually we would like 
other stores across the county, but for the time 
being we will always be bringing in new ranges 
and expanding those we already stock. 
Victoria Stuck chats about the Kentish store’s love 
of miniatures and its recent in-store gaming days

Te earliest record of this imagery I know of 
is from an 1872 publication called All the Year 
Round, which presented a story of a young 
white sailor coming into contact with native 
islanders with “a brass ring through his 
hideous nose” and “the thigh-bone of a man 
stuck horizontally through his matted hair”. 
Tese ideas are designed to present an image 
of the uncivilised savage and would have 
been a fairly typical scene of distant island 
stereotypes in the 1800s, but as a marketing 
theme in the year 2000 it’s a more unusual move.
Te theme continues inside the box; the game’s 
components are all miniatures of tribal savages in a 
similar vein, some with what appears to be dreadlocked 
hair and others with tribal spears. While there is evidence 
of cannibalism throughout several historical cultures, no 
single culture ﬁts the stereotype of boiling missionaries in 
a pot on some far-oﬀ South Paciﬁc island. 
Tere’s a reason you don’t see this picture of 
cannibalism in popular media today. Te ideas of 
cannibalism that were presented and accepted until 
the 1970s are a damaging stereotype that borrows from 
diﬀerent tribal styles and practices and blends them 
into a narrative of the uncivilised native. Unfortunately 
this narrative does exactly what it was supposed to do: 
skew the worldview and place Western civilisation as 
a superior culture by creating a ﬁctional lens through 
which we can alienate other cultures. 
Words Phil Robinson
L
et’s Do Lunch! is a board game with a very 
tenuous connection to cannibalism –not 
something I would have expected to see 
coming from a large game publisher, in this 
case Hasbro, in the year 2000. Te game itself 
is actually quite good fun; it’s one of those games that 
entices you in with simple rules and then as you play 
forces you to develop some strategy and start thinking 
more carefully about piece placement. Te box is 
colourful, the plastic miniatures are all nicely detailed 
and the board looks good. Tis is a game that plays 
well and has high production values.
From a social anthropology point of view, Let’s Do 
Lunch! is certainly an interesting item. Firstly, we need 
to dispose of the idea that the theme of cannibalism in 
some way enhances the game. Te game could have 
been themed in many diﬀerent ways – in fact, there 
is a digital game for the PC called Flower Power that 
is essentially the same game with the same rules but 
a diﬀerent theme. Actually, the process of planting 
ﬂowers in Flower Power makes even more sense with 
regards to the rules than that of placing cannibals on 
the board; the cannibalism element has no relationship 
or eﬀect on the game other than as an attempt to create 
something unusual for marketing purposes.
Te cover of the box shows two characters from 
opposing tribes: one in the cooking pot being boiled 
for the other’s lunch. Te character in the pot has a ring 
though his nose and the chef has a bone tied in her hair.
