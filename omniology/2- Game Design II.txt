I will talk to you of art,

Bumming a ride on the omnibus of art.

ACKNOWLEDGMENTS
This has been a long project, and even longer now that it is in second edition. So 
many people have been kind enough to help make it come into being; I know I am 
going to miss some.
Nyra and Emma, the loves of my life, who always encouraged me, and put up 
with years of me staring into space and jotting little notes when I should have been, 
say, mowing the lawn, doing the dishes, or putting out that fire in the backyard.
My mother, Susanne Fahringer, who, when I was twelve, understood somehow 
that Dungeons & Dragons was very, very important.
My brother, Ben, who taught me how to play Thunder, a card game he invented 
in a dream when he was four years old.
Jeff McGinley, for putting that whole ice cream cone in his mouth. And for put­
ting up with me for three decades.
Reagan Heller, who worked with me for countless hours in countless restau­
rants, airplanes, and meeting rooms coming up with visualization ideas for the 
lens images on the card deck, designed the card layouts, and did graphic design for 
several aspects of the book.
Kim Kiser and Dan Lin, who somehow found time to develop the new cover.
The entire staff at Schell Games, who gave great feedback, and pretended not to 
care that I was missing meetings to get the book done.
Emma Backer, who performed all the Cinderella tasks—typesetting the cards, 
wrangling the card artists, cleaning up and organizing book images, tracking down 
copyright holders, and cleaning the ashes from the fireplace.
The team at Elsevier/Morgan Kaufmann, who kindly let a two-year project take 
five years: Tim Cox, Georgia Kennedy, Beth Millett, Paul Gottehrer, Chris Simpson, 
Laura Lewin, and Kathryn Spencer.
The team at Taylor & Francis, especially Rick Adams and Marsha Pronin, who 
let what should have been a six-month editing job turn into an eighteen-month 
overhaul.
Everyone at the Disney VR Studio who put up with my rambling theoretical non­
sense conversations for all those years, especially Mike Goslin, Joe Shochet, Mark 
Mine, David Rose, Bruce Woodside, Felipe Lara, Gary Daines, Mk Haley, Daniel 
Aasheim, and Jan Wallace.

HELLO
Hello there! Come in, come in! What a nice surprise—I had no idea you would be 
visiting today. I’m sorry if it is a little messy in here, I’ve been writing. Please—
make yourself comfortable. Good, good. Now let’s see… where should we begin? 
Oh—I should introduce myself!
My name is Jesse Schell, and I have always loved designing games. Here’s picture 
of me:
I was shorter then. Since that picture was taken, I’ve done a lot of different things. 
I’ve worked in circuses as a professional juggler. I’ve been a writer, comedian, and 
magician’s apprentice. I’ve worked at IBM and Bell Communications Research as 
a software engineer. I’ve designed and developed interactive theme park rides and 
massively multiplayer games for the Walt Disney Company. I’ve started my own 
game studio, and become a professor at Carnegie Mellon University. But when peo­
ple ask me what I do, I tell them that I am a game designer.
I mention all this only because at various times in this book, I will be drawing 
examples from these experiences, since every single one of them has taught me 
valuable lessons about the art of game design. That might sound surprising now, 
but hopefully, as you read this book, it will help you see the ways that game design 
meaningfully connects to the many experiences in your own life.
One thing I should clarify: While the goal of this book is primarily to teach you 
how to be a better videogame designer, many of the principles we explore will 
have little to do with videogames specifically—you will find they are more broadly 

xxxviii
HELLO
applicable than that. The good news is that much of what you read here will work 
equally well no matter what kind of game you are designing—digital, analog, or 
otherwise.
What Is Game Design?
As we begin, it is important for us to be absolutely clear about what is meant by 
“game design.” After all, it is what the rest of the book is about, and some people 
seem a bit confused about it.
Game design is the act of deciding what a game should be.
That’s it. On the surface, it sounds too simple.
“You mean you design a game by just making one decision?”
No. To decide what a game is, you must make hundreds, usually thousands of 
decisions.
“Don’t I need special equipment to design a game?”
No. Since game design is simply decision making, you can actually design a 
game in your head. Usually, though, you will want to write down these decisions, 
because our memories are weak, and it is easy to miss something important if you 
don’t write things down. Further, if you want other people to help you make deci­
sions, or to help build the game, you need to communicate these decisions to them 
somehow, and writing them down is a good way to do that.
“What about programming? Don’t game designers have to be computer 
programmers?”
No, they don’t. First of all, many games can be played without the use of com­
puters or technology; board games, card games, and athletic games, for example. 
Secondly, even for computer games or videogames, it is possible to make the deci­
sions about what those games should be without knowing all the technical details 
of how those decisions are carried out. Of course, it can be a tremendous help if you 
do know these details, just as being a skilled writer or artist can help. This allows 
you to make better decisions more quickly, but it is not strictly necessary. It is like 
the relationship between architects and carpenters: an architect does not need to 
know everything the carpenter knows, but an architect must know everything the 
carpenter is capable of.
“So, you mean that the game designer just comes up with the story for the 
game?”
No. Story decisions are one aspect of a game design, but there are many, 
many others. Decisions about rules, look and feel, timing, pacing, risk-taking, 

xxxix
HELLO
rewards, punishments, and everything else the player experiences is the 
responsibility of the game designer.
“So the game designer makes decisions about what the game should be, 
writes them down, and moves on?”
Almost never. None of us has a perfect imagination, and the games we design in 
our heads and on paper almost never come out quite the way we expected. Many 
decisions are impossible to make until the designer has seen the game in action. 
For this reason, the designer is usually involved in the development of a game from 
the very beginning to the very end, making decisions about how the game should 
be all along the way.
It is important to make the distinction between “game developer” and “game 
designer.” A game developer is anyone who has any involvement with the creation 
of the game at all. Engineers, animators, modelers, musicians, writers, producers, 
and designers who work on games are all game developers. Game designers are just 
one species of game developer.
“So, the game designer is the only one allowed to make decisions about the 
game?”
Let’s turn that around: Anyone who makes decisions about how the game should 
be is a game designer. Designer is a role, not a person. Almost every developer on 
a team makes some decisions about how the game will be, just through the act of 
creating content for the game. These decisions are game design decisions, and when 
you make them, you are a game designer. For this reason, no matter what your role 
on a game development team, an understanding of the principles of game design 
will make you better at what you do.
Waiting for Mendeleev
The voyage of discovery is not in seeking new landscapes but in having new eyes.
—Marcel Proust
The goal of this book is to make you the best game designer you can be.
Unfortunately, at present, there is no “unified theory of game design,” no simple 
formula that shows us how to make good games. So what can we do?
We are in a position something like the ancient alchemists. In the time before 
Mendeleev (men-duh-lay-uv) discovered the periodic table, showing how all the 
fundamental elements were interrelated, alchemists relied on a patchwork quilt of 
rules of thumb about how different chemicals could combine. These were neces­
sarily incomplete, sometimes incorrect, and often semimystical, but by using these 
rules, the alchemists were able to accomplish surprising things, and their pursuit of 
the truth eventually led to modern chemistry.

xl
HELLO
Game designers await their Mendeleev. At this point we have no periodic 
table. We have our own patchwork of principles and rules, which, less than per­
fect, allows us to get the job done. I have tried to gather together the best of these 
into one place, so that you can study them, consider them, make use of them, and 
see how others have used them.
Good game design happens when you view your game from as many perspectives 
as possible. I refer to these perspectives as lenses, because each one is a way of view­
ing your design. The lenses are small sets of questions you should ask yourself about 
your design. They are not blueprints or recipes, but tools for examining your design. 
They will be introduced, one at a time, throughout the book. A deck of cards, with one 
card summarizing each lens, has been created to accompany this book. It is available 
as a free smartphone app, and can also be purchased as a physical deck of cards at 
http://artofgamedesign.com, to make it easy to use the lenses while you are designing.
None of the lenses are perfect, and none are complete, but each is useful in one 
context or another, for each gives a unique perspective on your design. The idea is 
that even though we can’t have one complete picture, by taking all of these small 
imperfect lenses and using them to view your problem from many different per­
spectives, you will be able to use your discretion to figure out the best design. I wish 
we had one all-seeing lens. We don’t. So, instead of discarding the many imperfect 
ones we do have, it is wisest to collect and use as wide a variety of them as possible, 
for as we will see, game design is more art than science, more like cooking than 
chemistry, and we must admit the possibility that our Mendeleev will never come.
Focus on Fundamentals
Many people assume that to best study the principles of game design, one would 
naturally study the most modern, complex, high-tech games that are available. This 
approach is completely wrong. Videogames are just a natural growth of traditional 
games into a new medium. The rules that govern them are still the same. An archi­
tect must understand how to design a shed before he can design a skyscraper, and 
so we will often be studying some of the very simplest games. Some of these will be 
videogames, but some will be far simpler: Dice games. Card games. Board games. 
Playground games. If we cannot understand the principles of these games, how can 
we have a hope of understanding more complex games? Some will argue that these 
games are old, and therefore not worth studying, but as Thoreau said, “We might 
as well omit to study Nature because she is old.” A game is a game is a game. The 
principles that make the classic games fun are the same principles that make the 
most modern games fun. The classic games have the added advantage that they 
have withstood the tests of time. Their success is not due to the novelty of their 
technology, which is the case with many modern games. These classic games have 
deeper qualities that, as game designers, we must learn to understand.
As well as a focus on classic games, this book will strive to deliver the deepest and 
most fundamental principles of game design, as opposed to genre-specific principles 

xli
HELLO
(“Fifteen tips for a better story-based first-person shooter!”), because genres come 
and go, but the basic principles of game design are principles of human psychology 
that have been with us for ages, and will be with us for ages to come. Well-versed 
in these fundamentals, you will be able to master any genre that appears, and even 
invent new genres of your own. As opposed to other books on game design, whose 
goal often seems to be to cover as much ground as possible, this book will not strive 
to cover ground, but to teach you to dig in the most fertile places.
And though this book will teach you principles you will be able to use to create 
traditional board and card games, it is very much slanted toward the videogame 
industry. Why? Because a game designer’s job is to create new games. The explosion 
of computer technology has allowed for innovation in the field of game design such 
as the world has never seen. There are more game designers alive today than have 
ever been alive in all of human history. Chances are, if you want to create games, 
you will be creating them somewhere on the cutting edge of this new technology, 
and this book is prepared to show you how to do just that, although most of the 
principles here will work just as well with more traditional game genres.
Talk to Strangers
Do not forget to entertain strangers, for by so doing some have unwittingly 
entertained angels.
—Hebrews 13:2
Game developers have a reputation for xenophobia, that is, fear of strangers. By 
this I mean not unfamiliar individuals, but rather unfamiliar techniques, prac­
tices, and principles. It almost seems like they believe that if it didn’t originate in 
the game industry, it isn’t worth considering. The truth is really that game devel­
opers are usually just too busy to look outside their immediate surroundings. 
Making good games is hard, so developers keep their heads down, stay focused, 
and get the job done. They usually don’t have the time to seek out new techniques, 
figure out how to integrate them into their games, and take the risk that a new 
technique might fail. So, they play it safe, and stick with what they know, which 
unfortunately leads to a lot of the “cookie-cutter” game titles that you see on the 
market.
But to succeed, to create something great and innovative, you have to do some­
thing different. This is not a book about how to make cookie-cutter games. It is a 
book about how to create great new designs. If you were surprised by the focus 
this book places on non-digital games, you will be even more surprised to see 
how it uses principles, methods, and examples from things that aren’t even games. 
Examples from music, architecture, film, science, painting, literature, and every­
thing else under the sun will be pulled in. And why not? Why should we have to 
develop all our principles from scratch, when hard work we can use has been going 
on in other fields, sometimes for hundreds or thousands of years? Design principles 

xlii
HELLO
will come from everywhere because design is everywhere, and design is the same 
everywhere. Not only will this book draw design inspiration from everywhere, it 
will persuade you to do the same. Everything you know and everything you have 
experienced is fair game at the game design table.
The Map
It does not make much difference what a person studies. All knowledge is related, 
and the man who studies anything, if he keeps at it, will become learned.
—Hypatia
Game design is not an easy subject to write about. Lenses and fundamentals are 
useful tools, but to truly understand game design is to understand an incredibly 
complex web of creativity, psychology, art, technology, and business. Everything 
in this web is connected to everything else. Changing one element affects all the 
others, and the understanding of one element influences the understanding of all 
of the others. Most experienced designers have built up this web in their minds, 
slowly, over many years, learning the elements and relationships by trial and error. 
And this is what makes game design so hard to write about. Books are necessarily 
linear. One idea must be presented at a time. For this reason, many game design 
books have an incomplete feeling to them—like a guided nighttime tour with a 
flashlight, the reader sees a lot of interesting things, but can’t really comprehend 
how they all fit together.
Game design is an adventure, and adventure needs a map. For this book, I 
have created a map that shows the web of game design relationships. You can 
see the complete map near the end of the book, but to see the entire map at once 
is confusing and overwhelming. Picasso once said, “To create, one must first 
destroy.” And so we will. We set everything aside, and begin our map as a blank 
slate. As we do this, I encourage you, too, to set aside your preconceptions about 
game design, so that you can approach this difficult but fascinating subject with 
an open mind.
Chapter 1 will begin by adding a single element, the designer. Successive 
chapters will add other elements, one at a time, gradually building up the com­
plex system of relationships between designer, player, game, team, and client, so 
you can see how they fit together, and why they fit together the way they do. By 
the end of the book, you will have, both on paper and in your mind, a map of 
these relationships. Of course, the map on paper is not the important one—the 
important one is the one in your mind. And the map is not the territory. It will 
necessarily be imperfect. But hopefully, after this book helps to create a map of 
relationships in your mind, you will test your mental map against reality, alter­
ing it and augmenting it, as you find parts of it that can be improved. Every 
designer goes through the journey of building their own personal map of these 

xliii
HELLO
relationships. If you are new to game design, this book should be able to give you 
the beginnings of your map. If you are already a seasoned game designer, I hope 
that this book can give you some ideas about how to improve the map you have.
Learning to Think
Every truth has four corners: as a teacher I give you one corner, and it is for you 
to find the other three.
—Confucius
What is Confucius talking about? Shouldn’t a good teacher show you all four cor­
ners, laying everything out plainly? No. To truly learn, remember, and understand, 
your mind must be in a state of questing, of seeking to find knowledge. If it is not in 
this state, a state of really wanting to deeply understand, the wisest principles will 
roll off you like water off a duck. There will be times in this book where things will 
not be laid out plainly—times where things are intentionally less clear so that when 
you do uncover the truth, it means something to you.
There is another reason for this sometimes cryptic approach. As discussed 
earlier, game design is not an exact science. It is full of mysteries and contradic­
tions. Our set of lenses will be incomplete and imperfect. To become a great game 
designer, it is not enough to be familiar with the set of principles this book has to 
offer. You must be ready to think for yourself, to figure out why certain principles 
don’t work in certain cases, and to invent new principles of your own. We await our 
Mendeleev. Perhaps it is you.
Why I Hate Books
I hate books, for they only teach people to talk about what they don’t understand.
—Jean-Jacques Rousseau
It is very important to have a balanced approach to study and practice.
—The Dalai Lama
Please do not think that reading this book, or any book, will make you into a game 
designer, much less a great game designer. Game design is not a set of principles, 
it is an activity. You could no sooner become a singer, pilot, or basketball player by 
reading a book than you could become a game designer. There is only one path to 
becoming a game designer, and that is the path of designing games—and more to 
the point, designing games that people really like. That means that simply jotting 
down your game idea isn’t enough. You must build the game, play it yourself, and 

xliv
HELLO
let others play it. When it doesn’t satisfy (and it won’t), you must change it. And 
change it. And change it again, dozens of times, until you have created a game 
that people actually enjoy playing. When you have been through this a few times, 
then you will start to understand what game design is. There’s a saying among 
game designers: “Your first ten games will suck—so get them out of the way fast.” 
The principles in this book will help to guide your designs, and give you useful 
perspectives on how to make better designs faster, but you can only become a good 
designer through practice. If you are not really interested in becoming a good game 
designer, put this book down now. It has nothing for you. But if you truly do want 
to be a game designer, then this book is not an end, but a beginning—the beginning 
of a continuous process of study, practice, assimilation, and synthesis that is going 
to last the rest of your life.

CHAPTER

In the Beginning, 
There Is the Designer
Magic Words
Would-be designers often ask me, “How do you become a game designer?” And the 
answer is easy: “Design games. Start now! Don’t wait! Don’t even finish this con­
versation! Just start designing! Go! Now!”
And some of them do just that. But many have a crisis of confidence and feel 
stuck in a catch-22: If only game designers can design games and you can only 
become a game designer by designing games, how can anyone ever get started? 
If this is how you feel, the answer is easy. Just say these magic words:
I am a game designer.
I’m serious. Say them out loud, right now. Don’t be shy—there’s no one here 
but us.
F I G U R E
1.1

2
CHAPTER One • In the Beginning, There Is the Designer
Did you do it? If so, congratulations. You are now a game designer. You might feel, 
at this moment, that you aren’t really a game designer yet, but that you’re just pre­
tending to be one. And that’s fine, because as we’ll explore later, people become 
what they pretend to be. Just go on pretending, doing the things you think a game 
designer would do, and before long, to your surprise, you will find you are one. If 
your confidence wavers, just repeat the magic words again: I am a game designer. 
Sometimes, I repeat them like this:
Who are you?
I am a game designer.
No, you’re not.
I am a game designer.
What kind of a designer?
I am a game designer.
You mean you play games.
I am a game designer.
This game of confidence building may seem silly at first. But it is far from the 
silliest thing you will do as a designer. And it is terribly important that you get good 
at building your confidence, for doubts about your abilities will forever plague you. 
As a novice designer, you will think, “I’ve never done this—I don’t know what I’m 
doing.” Once you have a little experience, you will think, “My skills are so narrow—
this new title is different. Maybe I just got lucky last time.” And when you are a 
seasoned designer, you will think, “The world is different now. Maybe I’ve lost my 
touch.”
Blow away these useless thoughts. They can’t help you. When a thing must be 
attempted, one must never think about possibility or impossibility. If you look at 
the great creative minds, all so different, you will find they have one thing in com­
mon: they lack a fear of ridicule. Some of the greatest innovations have come from 
people who only succeeded because they were too dumb to know that what they 
were doing was impossible. Game design is decision making, and decisions must 
be made with confidence.
Will you fail sometimes? Yes you will. You will fail again, and again, and 
again. You will fail many, many more times than you will succeed. But these 
failures are your only path to success. You will come to love your failures, 
because each failure brings you a step closer to a truly phenomenal game. There 
is a saying among jugglers: “If you aren’t dropping, you aren’t learning. And 
if you aren’t learning, you aren’t a juggler.” The same is true for game design: If 
you aren’t failing, you aren’t trying hard enough, and you aren’t really a game 
designer.

What Skills Does a Game Designer Need?
What Skills Does a Game Designer Need?
I have taken all knowledge to be my province.
—Francis Bacon
In short, all of them. Almost anything that you can be good at can become a useful 
skill for a game designer. Here are some of the big ones, listed alphabetically:
●
●
Animation—Modern games are full of characters that need to seem alive. The 
very word “animation” means “to give life.” Understanding the powers and lim­
its of character animation will let you open the door for clever game design ideas 
the world has yet to see.
●
●
Anthropology—You will be studying your audience in their natural habitat, 
trying to figure out their heart’s desire, so that your games might satisfy that 
desire.
●
●
Architecture—You will be designing more than buildings; you’ll be design­
ing whole cities and worlds. Familiarity with the world of architecture, that is, 
understanding the relationship between people and spaces, will give you a tre­
mendous leg up in creating game worlds.
●
●
Brainstorming—You will need to create new ideas by the dozens, nay, by the 
hundreds.
●
●
Business—The game industry is just that, an industry. Most games are made to 
make money. The better you understand the business end of things, the better 
chance you have of making the game of your dreams.
●
●
Cinematography—Many games will have movies in them. Almost all modern 
videogames have a virtual camera. You need to understand the art of cinematog­
raphy if you want to deliver an emotionally compelling experience.
●
●
Communication—You will need to talk with people in every discipline listed 
here, and even more. You will need to resolve disputes, solve problems of mis­
communication, and learn the truth about how your teammates, your client, and 
your audience really feel about your game.
●
●
Creative writing—You will be creating entire fictional worlds and populations to 
live in them and deciding the events that will happen there.
●
●
Economics—Many modern games feature complex economies of game resources. 
An understanding of the rules of economics can be surprisingly helpful.
●
●
Engineering—Modern videogames involve some of the most complex engi­
neering in the world today, with some titles counting their lines of code in the 
millions. New technical innovations make new kinds of gameplay possible. 

4
CHAPTER One • In the Beginning, There Is the Designer
Innovative game designers must understand both the limits and the powers that 
each technology brings.
●
●
Games—Naturally, familiarity with games will be of great use to you, but not 
just familiarity with the kind of games you intend to create. Your knowledge of 
the workings of every kind of game from pin the tail on the donkey to Panzer 
Dragoon will give you the raw materials you need when you create new games.
●
●
History—Many games are placed in historical settings. Even the ones placed in 
fantasy settings can draw incredible inspiration from history.
●
●
Management—Anytime a team works together toward a goal, there must be 
some management. Good designers can succeed even when management is bad, 
secretly “managing from below” to get the job done.
●
●
Mathematics—Games are full of mathematics, probability, risk analyses, and 
complex scoring systems, not to mention the mathematics that stands behind 
computer graphics and computer science in general. A skilled designer must not 
be afraid to delve into math from time to time.
●
●
Music—Music is the language of the soul. If your games are going to truly touch 
people, to immerse, and embrace them, they cannot do it without music.
●
●
Psychology—Your goal is to make a human being happy. You must understand 
the workings of the human mind or you are designing in the dark.
●
●
Public speaking—You will frequently need to present your ideas to a group. 
Sometimes you will speak to solicit their feedback; sometimes you will speak to 
persuade them of the genius of your new idea. Whatever the reason, you must be 
confident, clear, natural, and interesting, or people will be suspicious that you 
don’t know what you are doing.
●
●
Sound design—Sound is what truly convinces the mind that it is in a place; in 
other words, “hearing is believing.”
●
●
Technical writing—You need to create documents that clearly describe your 
complex designs without leaving any holes or gaps.
●
●
Visual arts—Your games will be full of graphic elements. You must be fluent in 
the language of graphic design and know how to use it to create the feeling you 
want your game to have.
And of course, there are many more. Daunting, isn’t it? How could anyone pos­
sibly master all of these things? The truth is that no one can. But the more of these 
things you are comfortable working with, however imperfectly, the better off you 
will be, for growth only happens when we exceed our limits. This is another reason 
that game designers must be confident and fearless. But there is one skill that is the 
key to all the others.

The Most Important Skill
The Most Important Skill
Of all the skills mentioned in the previous section, one is far and away the most 
important, and it sounds so strange to most people that I didn’t even list it. Many 
people guess “creativity,” and I would argue that this is probably the second most 
important skill. Some guess “critical thinking” or “logic,” since game design is 
about decision making. These are indeed important, but by no means the most 
important skills.
Some say “communication,” which starts to get close. The word communica­
tion has unfortunately become corrupted over the centuries. It once referred to an 
exchange of ideas but now has become a synonym for talking, as in “I have some­
thing to communicate to you.” Talking is certainly an important skill, but good com­
munication and good game design are rooted in something far more basic and far 
more important.
Listening.
The most important skill for a game designer is listening.
Game designers must listen to many things. These can be grouped into five 
major categories: team, audience, game, client, and self. Most of this book will be 
about how to listen to these five things.
This may sound absurd to you. Is listening even a skill? We are not equipped 
with “earlids.” How can we help but listen?
By listening, I don’t mean merely hearing what is said. I mean a deeper listen­
ing, a thoughtful listening. For example, you are at work, and you see your friend 
Fred. “Hi Fred, how are you?” you say. Fred frowns, looks down, shifts his weight 
uncomfortably, seems to be hunting for words, and then says quietly, without eye 
contact, “Uh, fine, I guess.” And then, he collects himself, takes a breath, and looks 
you in the eye as he determinedly, but not convincingly, says a little louder, “I’m, 
uh, fine. How are you?”
So how is Fred? His words say, “He’s fine.” Great. Fred is fine. If you are just 
“surface listening,” you might draw that conclusion. But if you listen more deeply, 
paying full attention to Fred’s body language, subtle facial expression, tone of 
voice, and gestures, you might hear a very different message: “Actually, I’m not 
fine. I have a serious problem that I think I might want to discuss with you. But 
I won’t do that unless I get some kind of commitment from you that you really 
care about my problem, because it is kind of a personal issue. If you don’t want to 
get involved with it, though, I won’t bother you with it, and I’ll just pretend that 
everything is okay.”
All of that was right there, in Fred’s “I’m fine.” And if you were listening deeply 
to what he said, you heard it all, clear as a bell, plain as day, as if he’d said it out 
loud. This is the kind of listening that game designers must engage in, day in and 
day out, with every decision that they make.

6
CHAPTER One • In the Beginning, There Is the Designer
When you listen thoughtfully, you observe everything and constantly ask your­
self questions: “Is that right?” “Why is it that way?” “Is this how she really feels?” 
“Now that I know that, what does it mean?”
Game designer Brian Moriarty once pointed out that there was a time when 
we didn’t use the word “listen,” instead we said “list!” And where did this come 
from? Well, what do we do when we listen? We tip our head to one side—our head 
literally lists, as a boat at sea. And when we tip to one side, we put ourselves off 
balance; we accept the possibility of upset. When we listen deeply, we put our­
selves in a position of risk. We accept the possibility that what we hear may upset 
us and may cause everything we know to be contradicted. It is the ultimate in 
open-mindedness. It is the only way to learn the truth. You must approach every­
thing as a child does, assuming nothing, observing everything, and listening as 
Herman Hesse describes in Siddhartha:
To listen with a silent heart, with a waiting, open soul. Without passion, with­
out desire, without judgment, without rebuke.
The Five Kinds of Listening
Because game design is such an interconnected web, we will be visiting and revisit­
ing the five kinds of listening and exploring their interconnections throughout this 
book.
You will need to listen to your team (Chapters 25 and 26), since you will be 
building your game and making crucial game design decisions together with them. 
Remember that big list of skills? Together, your team might have all of them. If you 
can listen deeply to your team and truly communicate with them, you will all func­
tion as one unit, as if you all shared the same skills.
You will need to listen to your audience (Chapters 9 through 11, 23, 24, and 32) 
because these are the people who will be playing your game. Ultimately, if they 
aren’t happy with your game, you have failed. And the only way to know what will 
make them happy is to listen to them deeply, getting to know them better than they 
know themselves.
You will need to listen to your game (most chapters in the book). What does 
this even mean? It means you will get to know your game inside and out. Like a 
mechanic who can tell what is wrong with a car by listening to the engine, you will 
get to know what is wrong with your game by listening to it run.
You will need to listen to your client (Chapters 29 through 31). The client is the 
one who is paying you to design the game, and if you don’t give them what they 
want, they’ll go to someone else who does. Only by listening to them, deeply, will 
you be able to tell what they really want, deep in their hearts.

7
The Secret of the Gifted
And last, you will need to listen to your self (Chapters 1, 7, and 34). This sounds 
easy, but for many, it is the most difficult kind of listening. If you can master it, 
however, it will be one of your most powerful tools and the secret behind your tre­
mendous creativity.
The Secret of the Gifted
After all that fancy talk, your confidence might be fading already. You might be 
wondering whether game design is really for you. You might have noticed that 
skilled game designers seem to have a special gift for the work. It comes easily 
and naturally to them, and though you love games, you wonder if you are gifted 
enough to succeed as a designer. Well, here is a little secret about gifts. There are 
two kinds. First, there is the innate gift of a given skill. This is the minor gift. If you 
have this gift, a skill such as game design, mathematics, or playing the piano comes 
naturally to you. You can do it easily, almost without thinking. But you don’t neces­
sarily enjoy doing it. There are millions of people with minor gifts of all kinds, who, 
though skilled, never do anything great with their gifted skill, and this is because 
they lack the major gift.
The major gift is love of the work. This might seem backward. How can love of 
using a skill be more important than the skill itself? It is for this simple reason: If 
you have the major gift, the love of designing games, you will design games using 
whatever limited skills you have. And you will keep doing it. And your love for the 
work will shine through, infusing your work with an indescribable glow that only 
comes from the love of doing it. And through practice, your game design skills, 
like muscles, will grow and become more powerful, until eventually your skills 
will be as great, or greater than, those of someone who only has the minor gift. 
And people will say, “Wow. That one is a truly gifted game designer.” They will 
think you have the minor gift, of course, but only you will know the secret source 
of your skill, which is the major gift: love of the work.
But maybe you aren’t sure if you have the major gift. You aren’t sure if you 
truly love game design. I have encountered many students who started designing 
games just to see what it was like, only to find that to their surprise, they truly 
love the work. I have also encountered those who were certain that they were des­
tined to be game designers. Some of them even had the minor gift. But when they 
experienced what game design really was like, they realized it wasn’t for them.
There is only one way to find out if you have the major gift. Start down the path, 
and see if it makes your heart sing.
So recite your magic words, for down the path we go!
I am a game designer.
I am a game designer.
I am a game designer.
I am a game designer.

Of the innumerable effects, or impressions, of which the heart, the intellect, or 
the soul is susceptible, what one shall I, on the present occasion, select?
—Edgar Allen Poe, The Philosophy of Composition
In Chapter 1, we established that everything begins with the game designer and 
that the game designer needs certain skills. Now it is time to begin talking about 
what a game designer uses those skills for. Put another way, we need to ask, “What 
is the game designer’s goal?” At first, the answer seems obvious: a game designer’s 
goal is to design games.
But this is wrong.
Ultimately, a game designer does not care about games. Games are merely a 
means to an end. On their own, games are just artifacts—clumps of cardboard or 
bags of bits. Games are worthless unless people play them. Why is this? What magic 
happens when games are played?
When people play games, they have an experience. It is this experience that the 
designer cares about. Without the experience, the game is worthless.
I will warn you right now: we are about to enter territory that is very difficult to 
talk about, not because it is unfamiliar—in fact, quite the opposite. It is hard to talk 
about because it is too familiar. Everything we’ve ever seen (look at that sunset!), 
done (have you ever flown a plane?), thought (why is the sky blue?), or felt (this 
snow is so cold!) has been an experience. By definition, we can’t experience any­
thing that is not an experience. Experiences are so much a part of us; they are hard 
to think about (even thinking about experiences is an experience). But as familiar 
as we are with experiences, they are very hard to describe. You can’t see them, 
touch them, or hold them—you can’t even really share them. No two people can 
have identical experiences of the same thing—each person’s experience of some­
thing is completely unique.
And this is the paradox of experiences. On one level, they are shadowy and 
nebulous, and on another, they are all we know. But as tricky as experiences can 
be, creating them is all a game designer really cares about. We cannot shy away from 
them, retreating into the concreteness of our material game. We must use every 
means we can muster to comprehend, understand, and master the nature of human 
experience.

11
The Game Is Not the Experience
The Game Is Not the Experience
We must be absolutely clear on this point before we can proceed. The game is not 
the experience. The game enables the experience, but it is not the experience. This 
is a hard concept for some people to grasp. The ancient Zen question addresses this 
directly: “If a tree falls in the forest, and no one is there to hear it, does it make a 
sound?” This has been repeated so often that it sounds hackneyed, but it is exactly 
what we are talking about. If our definition of “sound” is air molecules vibrating, 
then yes, the tree makes a sound. If our definition of sound is the experience of hear­
ing a sound, then the answer is no, the tree makes no sound when no one is there. 
As designers, we don’t really care about the tree and how it falls—we care only 
about the experience of hearing it. The tree is just a means to an end. And if no one 
is there to hear it, well, we don’t care at all.
Game designers only care about what seems to exist. The player and the game 
are real. The experience is imaginary—but game designers are judged by the qual­
ity of this imaginary thing because it is the reason people play games.
If we could, through some high-tech magic, create experiences for people 
directly, with no underlying media—no game boards, no computers, no screens—
we would do it. In a sense, this is the dream of “artificial reality”—to be able to 
create experiences that are in no way limited by the constraints of the medium 
that delivers the experiences. It is a beautiful dream, but only a dream. We can­
not create experiences directly. Perhaps in the distant future, using technologies 
hard to imagine, such a thing could happen. Time will tell. For now, we live in the 
present, where all we can do is create artifacts (rule sets, game boards, computer 
programs) that are likely to create certain kinds of experiences when a player 
interacts with them.
And it is this that makes game design so very hard. Like building a ship in a 
bottle, we are far removed from what we are actually trying to create. We create 
F I G U R E

What’s water?

12
CHAPTER Two • THE DESIGNER CREATES AN EXPERIENCE
an artifact that a player interacts with and cross our fingers that the experience 
that takes place during that interaction is something they will enjoy. We never 
truly see the output of our work, since it is an experience had by someone else 
and, ultimately, unsharable.
This is why deep listening is so essential for game design.
Is This Unique to Games?
You might well ask what is so special about games, compared to other types of 
experiences, that require us to get into all of this touchy-feely experience stuff. And 
really, on one level, there is nothing special about games in this regard. Designers 
of all types of entertainment—books, movies, plays, music, rides, everything—have 
to cope with the same issue: How can you create something that will generate a 
certain experience when a person interacts with it?
But the split between artifact and experience is much more obvious for game 
design than it is for other types of entertainment, for a not-so-obvious reason. Game 
designers have to cope with much more interaction than the designers of more 
linear experiences. The author of a book or screenplay is designing a linear experi­
ence. There is a fairly direct mapping between what they create and what the reader 
or viewer experiences. Game designers don’t have it so easy. We give the player a 
great deal of control over the pacing and sequence of events in the experience. We 
even throw in random events! This makes the distinction between artifact and 
experience much more obvious than it is for linear entertainment. At the same time, 
though, it makes it much harder to be certain just what experience is really going to 
arise in the mind of the player.
So, why do we do it? What is so special about game experiences that we would 
give up the luxuries of control that linear entertainers enjoy? Are we simply masoch­
ists? Do we just do it for the challenge? No. As with everything else game design­
ers do, we do it for the experience it creates. There are certain feelings: feelings of 
choice, feelings of freedom, feelings of responsibility, feelings of accomplishment, 
feelings of friendship, and many others, which only game-based experiences seem 
to offer. This is why we go through all the trouble—to generate experiences that can 
be had no other way.
Three Practical Approaches to Chasing Rainbows
There ain’t no rules around here! We’re trying to accomplish something!
—Thomas Edison
So—we’ve established what we need to do—create games that will somehow gen­
erate wonderful, compelling, memorable experiences. To do this, we must embark 
on a daunting endeavor: to uncover both the mysteries of the human mind and the 

13
Three Practical Approaches to Chasing Rainbows
secrets of the human heart. No one field of study has managed to perfectly map 
this territory (Mendeleev, where are you?), but several different fields have man­
aged to map out parts of it. Three, in particular, stand out: psychology, anthropol­
ogy, and design. Psychologists want to understand the mechanisms that make 
people tick, anthropologists want to understand people on a human level, and 
designers just want to make people happy. We will be using approaches borrowed 
from all three of these fields, so let’s consider what each one has to offer us.
Psychology
Who better for us to learn the nature of human experience from than psycholo­
gists, the scientists who study the mechanisms that govern the human mind? And 
truly, they have made some discoveries about the mind that are incredibly useful, 
some of which will be covered in this book. In fact, you might expect that our quest 
for understanding how to create great human experiences might end right here 
and that the psychologists should have all the answers. Sadly, this is not the case. 
Because they are scientists, they are forced to work in the realm of what is real and 
provable. Early in the twentieth century, a schism in psychology developed. On one 
side of the battle were the behaviorists who focused only on measurable behavior, 
taking a “black box” approach to the study of the mind. Their primary tool was 
objective, controlled experimentation. On the other side were the phenomenologists 
who study what game designers care about most—the nature of human experience 
and “the feeling of what happens.” Their primary tool was introspection—the act of 
examining your experiences as they happen.
Unfortunately for us, the behaviorists won out, and for very good reasons. The 
behavioristic focus on objective, repeatable experiments makes for very good sci­
ence. One behaviorist can do an experiment, publish a paper about it, and other 
behaviorists can repeat the experiment under the same conditions, almost certainly 
getting the same results. The phenomenological approach, on the other hand, is 
necessarily subjective. Experiences themselves cannot be directly measured—only 
described and described imperfectly. When an experiment takes place in your 
mind, how can you possibly be sure the experimental conditions are controlled? 
As fascinating and useful as it might be to study our own internal thoughts and 
feelings, it makes for shaky science. As a result, for as much progress that has been 
made by modern psychology, it generally feels obligated to avoid the thing we care 
about the most—the nature of human experience.
Though psychology does not have all the answers we need, it does provide some 
very useful ones, as we’ll see. More than that, it provides approaches we can use 
quite effectively. Not bound by the strict responsibilities of good science, game 
designers can make use of both behavioristic experiments and phenomenological 
introspection to learn what we need to know, since ultimately, as designers, we are 
not concerned with what is definitely true in the world of objective reality, but only 
with what seems to be true in the world of subjective experience.

CHAPTER Two • THE DESIGNER CREATES AN EXPERIENCE
But perhaps there is another scientific approach that lies somewhere between the 
two extremes of behaviorism and phenomenology?
Anthropology
Anthropology is the most humanistic of the sciences and the most scientific of 
the humanities.
—Alfred L. Kroeber
Anthropology is another major branch of study about human beings and what they 
think and do. It takes a much more holistic approach than psychology, looking at 
everything about people including their physical, mental, and cultural aspects. It is 
very concerned with studying the similarities and differences between the various 
peoples of the world, not just today, but throughout history.
Of particular interest to game designers is the approach of cultural anthropology, 
which is the study of living peoples’ ways of life, mostly through fieldwork. Cultural 
anthropologists live with their subjects of study and try to immerse themselves 
completely in the world of the people they are trying to learn about. They strive for 
objective observation of culture and practices, but at the same time, they engage in 
introspection and take great pains to put themselves in the place of their subjects. 
This helps the anthropologist better imagine what it “feels like” to be their subjects.
We can learn a number of important things about human nature from the work 
of anthropologists—but much more important, by taking a cultural anthropolo­
gist’s approach to our players, interviewing them, learning everything we can about 
them, and putting ourselves in their place, we can gain insights that would not have 
been possible from a more objective point of view.
Design
The third field that has made important study of human experience is, not surpris­
ingly, the field of design. We will be able to learn useful things from almost every 
kind of designer: musicians, architects, authors, filmmakers, industrial designers, 
web designers, choreographers, visual designers, and many more. The incredible 
variety of design “rules of thumb” that comes from these different disciplines does 
an excellent job of illustrating useful principles about human experience. But unfor­
tunately, these principles can often be hard for us to use. Unlike scientists, designers 
seldom publish papers about their discoveries. The very best designers in various 
fields often know little about the workings of other fields of design. The musician 
may know a lot about rhythm but probably has given little thought to how the 
principles of rhythm might apply to something nonmusical, such as a novel or stage 
play, even though they may have meaningful practical application there, since they 

15
Introspection: Powers, Perils, and Practice
are ultimately rooted in the same place—the human mind. So to use principles 
from other areas of design, we will need to cast a wide net. Anyone who creates 
something that people are meant to experience and enjoy has something to teach 
us, and so we will pull rules and examples from designers of every stripe, being as 
“xenophilic” as possible.
Ideally, we would find ways to connect all the varied principles of design to 
each other through the common ground of psychology and anthropology, since 
ultimately all design principles are rooted in these. In some small ways, we will 
do that in this book. Perhaps one day these three fields will find a way to unify all 
their principles. For now, we will need to be content with building a few bridges 
here and there—this is no small accomplishment, since these are three fields that 
seldom have much cross-pollination. Further, some of the bridges will prove to be 
surprisingly useful! The task before us, game design, is so difficult that we cannot 
afford to be snobbish about where we get our knowledge. None of these approaches 
can solve all our problems, so we will mix and match them, trying to use them 
appropriately, like we might use tools from a toolbox. We must be both open-minded 
and practical—good ideas can come from anywhere, but they are only good for us 
if they help us create better experiences.
Introspection: Powers, Perils, and Practice
A dedicated scientist never hesitates to experiment on himself.
—Fenton Claypool
We have discussed some of the places to find useful tools for mastering human 
experience. Let’s now focus on one tool that has been used by all three disciplines: 
introspection. This is the seemingly simple act of examining your own thoughts 
and feelings—that is, your own experiences. While it is true you can never truly 
know the experience of another, you certainly can know your own. In one sense, it 
is all you can know. By deeply listening to your own self, that is, observing, evaluat­
ing, and describing your own experiences, you can make rapid, decisive judgments 
about what is and is not working in your game and why it is or is not working.
“But wait,” you might say. “Is introspection really such a good idea? If it isn’t 
good enough for the scientists, why is it good enough for us?” And this is a fair ques­
tion. There are two main perils associated with using introspection:
Peril #1: Introspection Can Lead to False 
Conclusions about Reality
This is the scientists’ main reason to reject introspection as a valid method of 
inquiry. Many pseudoscientists over the years have come up with crackpot theories 

16
CHAPTER Two • THE DESIGNER CREATES AN EXPERIENCE
based mainly on introspection. This happens so often because what seems to be 
true in our personal experience is not necessarily really true. Socrates, for example, 
noted that when we learn something new, it often feels like we knew it all along 
and that in learning it, it feels as if we were just reminded of something we already 
knew but had forgotten. This is an interesting observation, and most people can 
remember a learning experience that felt this way. But Socrates then goes too far 
and forms an elaborate argument that since learning can feel like recollection, we 
must then be reincarnated souls who are just now remembering what we learned 
in past lives.
This is the problem with drawing conclusions about reality based on introspec­
tion—just because something feels true, it doesn’t mean it is true. People very easily 
fall into the trap of building up structures of questionable logic to back up some­
thing that feels like it must be true. Scientists learn to be disciplined about avoiding 
this trap. Introspection certainly has its place in science—it allows one to examine 
a problem from points of view that mere logic won’t allow. Good scientists use intro­
spection all the time—but they don’t draw scientific conclusions from it.
Fortunately for us, game design is not science! While “objective truth about 
reality” is interesting and sometimes useful to us, we primarily care about what 
“feels like it is true.” Aristotle gives us another classical example that illustrates 
this perfectly. He wrote a number of works on a variety of topics, such as logic, 
physics, natural history, and philosophy. He is famous for the depth of his personal 
introspection, and when we examine his works, we find something interesting. His 
ideas about physics and natural history are largely discredited today. Why? Because 
he relied too much on what felt true, and not enough on controlled experiments. 
His introspection led him to all kinds of conclusions we now know to be false, such 
as the following:
●
●
Heavier objects fall faster than light ones.
●
●
The seat of consciousness is in the heart.
●
●
Life arises by spontaneous generation.
So why do we remember him as a genius, and not as a crackpot? Because his other 
works, about metaphysics, drama, ethics, and the mind, are still useful today. In 
these areas where what feels true matters more than what is objectively, provably 
true, most of his conclusions, reached through deep introspection, stand up to scru­
tiny thousands of years later.
The lesson here is simple: when dealing with the human heart and mind and try­
ing to understand experience and what things feel like, introspection is an incred­
ibly powerful and trustworthy tool. As game designers, we don’t need to worry 
much about this first peril. We care more about how things feel and less about 
what is really true. Because of this, we can often confidently trust our feelings and 
instincts when making conclusions about the quality of an experience.

17
Introspection: Powers, Perils, and Practice
Peril #2: What Is True of My Experiences 
May Not Be True for Others
This second danger of introspection is the one we must take seriously. With the first 
peril, we got a “Get Out of Jail Free” card because we are designers, not scientists. 
But we can’t get away from this one so easily. This peril is the peril of subjectivity 
and a place where many designers fall into a trap: “I like playing this game; there­
fore, it must be good.” And sometimes, this is right. But other times, if the audi­
ence has tastes that differ from your own, it is very, very wrong. Some designers 
take extreme positions on this ranging from “I will only design for people like me, 
because it is the only way I can be sure my game is good” to “introspection and 
subjective opinions can’t be trusted. Only playtesting can be trusted.” Each of these 
is a “safe” position but also has its limits and problems:
“I only design for people like me” has these problems:
●
●
Game designers tend to have unusual tastes. There may not be enough people 
like you out there to make your game a worthwhile investment.
●
●
You won’t be designing or developing alone. If different team members have dif­
ferent ideas about what is best, they can be hard to resolve.
●
●
There are many kinds of games and audiences that will be completely off limits 
to you.
“Personal opinions can’t be trusted” has these problems:
●
●
You can’t leave every decision to playtesting, especially early in the process, 
when there is no game yet to playtest. At this point, someone has to exert a per­
sonal opinion about what is good and bad.
●
●
Before a game is completely finished, playtesters may reject an unusual idea. 
They sometimes need to see it completed before they can really appreciate it. If 
you don’t trust your own feelings about what is good and bad, you may, at the 
advice of your playtesters, throw out an “ugly duckling” that could have grown 
up to be a beautiful swan.
●
●
Playtesting can only happen occasionally. Important game design decisions 
must be made on a daily basis.
The way out of this peril, without resorting to such limiting extremes, is again to 
listen. Introspection for game design is a process of not just listening to yourself 
but also listening to others. By observing your own experiences, and then observ­
ing others, and trying to put yourself in their place, you start to develop a picture 
of how your experiences differ from theirs. Once you have a clear picture of these 

18
CHAPTER Two • THE DESIGNER CREATES AN EXPERIENCE
differences, you can, like a cultural anthropologist, start to put yourself in the place 
of your audience and make predictions about what experiences they will and will 
not enjoy. It is a delicate art that must be practiced—and with practice, your skill at 
it will improve.
Dissect Your Feelings
Work in the invisible world as least as hard as you do in the visible.
—Rumi
It is not such a simple thing to know your feelings. It is not enough for a designer to 
simply have a general sense about whether they like something or not. You must be 
able to clearly state what you like, what you don’t like, and why. A friend of mine 
in college was notoriously bad at this. We would frequently drive each other crazy 
with conversations like the following:
Me: What did you eat at the cafeteria today?
Him: Pizza. It was bad.
Me: Bad? What was bad about it?
Him: It was just … bad.
Me: Do you mean it was too cold? Too hard? Too soggy? Too bitter? Too much 
sauce? Not enough sauce? Too cheesy? What was bad about it?
Him: I don’t know—it was just bad!
He was simply unable to clearly dissect his experiences. In the case of the pizza, 
he knew he didn’t like it but was unable to (or didn’t bother to) analyze the expe­
rience to the point where he could make useful suggestions about how the pizza 
might improve. This kind of experience dissection is a main goal of your introspec­
tion—it is something designers must do. When you play a game, you must be able 
to analyze how it made you feel, what it made you think of, and what it made you 
do. You must be able to state this analysis clearly. You must put words to it, for 
feelings are abstract, but words are concrete, and you will need this concreteness 
to describe to others the experiences you want your game to produce. You need to 
do this kind of analysis not only when designing and playing your own games but 
also when playing games other people have created. In fact, you should be able to 
analyze any experience you might have. The more you analyze your own experi­
ences, the more clearly you will be able to think about the kinds of experiences 
your games should create.
We have a special word for the feelings that rise up from within us: emotions. 
Our logical mind can easily dismiss emotions as unimportant, but they are the 
foundation of all memorable experience. So that we never forget the importance of 
emotions for experience design, let’s make them our first lens.

19
Defeating Heisenberg
Defeating Heisenberg
But there is still a greater challenge of introspection. How can we observe our 
own experiences without tainting them, since the act of observation itself is an 
experience? We face this problem quite often. Try to observe what your fingers 
are doing as you type at a computer keyboard and you will quickly find yourself 
typing slowly and making many errors, if you can still type at all. Try to observe 
yourself enjoying a movie or a game, and the enjoyment can quickly fade away. 
Some call this “paralysis by analysis,” and others refer to it as the Heisenberg 
principle. This principle, in reference to the Heisenberg uncertainty principle from 
quantum mechanics, points out that the motion of a particle cannot be observed 
without disturbing the motion of that particle. Similarly, the nature of an experi­
ence cannot be observed without disturbing the nature of that experience. This 
makes introspection sound hopeless. While it is a challenging problem, there are 
ways around it that are quite effective, though some take practice. Most of us are 
not in the habit of openly discussing the nature of our thought processes, so some 
of the following is going to sound a little strange.
Analyze Memories
One good thing about experiences is that we remember them. Analyzing an expe­
rience while it is happening can be hard, because the part of your mind used for 
analysis is normally focused on the experience itself. Analyzing your memory of an 
experience is much easier. Memory is imperfect, but analyzing a memory is better 
than nothing. Of course, the more you remember, the better, so working either with 
Lens #1: The Lens of Emotion
People may forget what you said, but they’ll never forget how you made 
them feel.
—Maya Angelou
To make sure the emotions you create are the right ones, ask yourself these 
questions:
●
●
What emotions would I like my player to experience? Why?
●
●
What emotions are players (including me) having when they play now? 
Why?
●
●
How can I bridge the gap between the emotions players are having and the 
emotions I’d like them to have?

20
CHAPTER Two • THE DESIGNER CREATES AN EXPERIENCE
memories of powerful experiences (these often make the best inspiration, anyway) 
or with fresh memories is best. If you have the mental discipline, it also can be very 
useful to engage in an experience (such as playing a game), with the intention of 
not analyzing it while you play, but with the intention of analyzing the memory of it 
immediately after. Just having this intention can help you remember more details of 
the experience without interfering with the experience itself. This does require you 
to remember that you are going to analyze it without letting that thought interfere 
with the experience. Tricky!
Two Passes
A method that builds on analyzing memories is to run through your experience 
twice. The first time, don’t stop to analyze anything—just have the experience. 
Then, go back and do it again, this time, analyzing everything—maybe even paus­
ing to take notes. You have the untainted experience fresh in your mind, and the 
second run-through lets you “relive it” but gives you a chance to stop and think, 
considering how it felt and why.
Sneak Glances
Is it possible to observe your experience without spoiling it? It is, but it takes some 
practice. It sounds strange to say this, but if you “sneak quick glances” at your expe­
rience while it is happening, you can often observe it quite well without degrading 
or interrupting it significantly. It is kind of like trying to get a good look at a stranger 
in a public place. Take a few short glances at them, and they won’t notice you are 
observing them. But look too long, and you will catch their attention, and they will 
notice you staring. Fortunately, you can learn a lot about an experience with a few 
short “mental glances.” Again, this takes some mental discipline or you will get car­
ried away with analysis. If you can make these mental glances habitual, just doing 
them all the time without thinking about it, they will interrupt things even less. 
Most people find what really interrupts their train of thought, or train of experience, 
is interior mental dialog. When you start asking and answering too many questions 
in your head, your experience is doomed. A “quick glance” is more like “Exciting 
enough? Yes.” Then, you immediately stop analyzing and get back to the experi­
ence, until the next glance.
Observe Silently
Ideally, though, you want to observe what is happening to you while it is happen­
ing, not just through a few quick glances but through continuous observation. You 
want it to be as if you were sitting outside yourself, watching yourself, except that 

21
Essential Experience
you see more than a normal observer. You can hear all of your thoughts and feel all 
of your feelings. When you enter this state, it is almost as if you have two minds: 
one moving, engaged in an experience, and one still, silently observing the other. 
This may sound completely bizarre, but it is quite possible and quite useful. It is a 
difficult state to achieve, but it can be reached. It seems to be something like the Zen 
practice of self-observation, and it is not unlike the meditation exercise of trying to 
observe your own breathing cycle. Normally we breathe without thinking, but at 
any moment, we may consciously take control of our breathing process—conse­
quently interfering with it. With practice however, you can observe your natural, 
unconscious breathing without disturbing it. But this takes practice, just as observ­
ing your experiences takes practice. Observing your experiences can be practiced 
anywhere—while watching TV, while working, while playing, or while doing any­
thing at all. You won’t get it right at first, but if you keep experimenting and practic­
ing, you will start to get the hang of it. It will take a great deal of practice. But if you 
truly want to listen to your self and understand the nature of human experience, 
you will find the practice worthwhile.
Essential Experience
But how does all this talk about experience and observations really fit in with games? 
If I want to make a game about, say, a snowball fight, does analyzing my memories 
of a real snowball fight have any bearing on the snowball fight game I want to make? 
There is no way I can perfectly replicate the experience of a real snowball fight with­
out real snow and real friends outside in the real world—so what is the point?
The point is that you don’t need to perfectly replicate real experiences to make a 
good game. What you need to do is to capture the essence of those experiences for 
your game. What does “the essence of an experience” really mean? Every memo­
rable experience has some key features that define it and make it special. When 
you go over your memory of a snowball fight experience, for example, you might 
think of a lot of things. There are some you might even consider essential to that 
experience: “There was so much snow, school was canceled.” “We played right in 
the street.” “The snow was just right for packing.” “It was so cold, but sunny—the 
sky was so blue.” “There were kids everywhere.” “We built this huge fort.” “Fred 
threw a snowball really high—when I looked up at it, he chucked one right at my 
head!” “We couldn’t stop laughing.” There are also parts of that experience that you 
don’t consider essential: “I was wearing corduroy pants.” “I had some mints in my 
pocket.” “A man walking his dog looked at us.”
As a game designer trying to design an experience, your goal is to figure out the 
essential elements that really define the experience you want to create and find ways 
to make them part of your game design. This way, the players of your game get to 
experience those essential elements. Much of this book will be about the many ways 
you can craft a game to get across the experience you want players to have. The key 
idea here is that the essential experience can often be delivered in a form that is very 

22
CHAPTER Two • THE DESIGNER CREATES AN EXPERIENCE
different from a real experience. To follow up on the snowball fight example, what are 
some of the ways you could convey the experience “it was so cold” through a snow­
ball fight game? If it is a videogame, you could certainly use artwork: the characters 
could breathe little puffs of condensation, and they could have a shivering anima­
tion. You could use sound effects—perhaps a whistling wind could convey coldness. 
Maybe there wasn’t a cold wind on the day you are imagining, but the sound effect 
might capture the essence and deliver an experience that seems cold to the player. 
You could use the rules of the game, too, if cold was really important to you. Maybe 
players can make better snowballs without gloves, but when their hands get too cold, 
they have to put gloves on. Again, that might not have really happened, but that game 
rule helps deliver an experience of coldness that will be integral part of your game.
Some people find this approach strange—they say, “Just design a game and see 
what experience comes out of it!” And I suppose it is true—if you don’t know what 
you want, you might not care what you get. But if you do know what you want—if 
you have a vision of how you would like your game to feel to the players—you 
need to consider how you are going to deliver the essential experience. And this 
brings us to our next lens.
If there is a big difference between the experience you want to create and the one 
you are actually creating, your game needs to change: you need to clearly state the 
essential experience you desire and find as many ways as possible to instill this 
essence into your game.
The design of the very successful baseball game in Wii Sports is an excellent 
example of the Lens of Essential Experience in use. Originally, the designers had 
intended to make it as much like real baseball as possible with the added bonus that 
you could swing your controller like a bat. As they proceeded, though, they real­
ized they wouldn’t have time to simulate every aspect of baseball as much as they 
wanted. So they made a big decision—since swinging the controller was the most 
unique part of this game, they would focus all their attention on getting that part of 
the baseball experience right—what they felt was the essential part. They decided 
that other details (nine innings, stealing bases, etc.) were not part of the essential 
experience they were trying to create.
Lens #2: The Lens of Essential Experience
To use this lens, you stop thinking about your game and start thinking about 
the experience of the player. Ask yourself these questions:
●
●
What experience do I want the player to have?
●
●
What is essential to that experience?
●
●
How can my game capture that essence?

23
All That’s Real Is What You Feel
Designer Chris Klug made masterful use of the Lens of Essential Experience when 
he created the tabletop role-playing game James Bond 007. Klug had been frustrated 
with previous attempts to create secret agent role-playing games, such as TSR’s Top 
Secret, because they played too much like war games—the essence of what made spy 
movies exciting just wasn’t there. For the Bond game, Klug designed the mechan­
ics to feel like the exciting James Bond films every way he could. One outstanding 
example was the creation of something called “Hero Points.” In traditional RPGs, 
when players would undertake a risky action, say, jumping out a window onto a 
moving helicopter, the game master would make some calculation of the probability 
of it succeeding, the player would roll the dice, and that was that. This gives the 
game master a difficult problem of balance: if the probability of succeeding at dan­
gerous actions is too low, the players won’t risk it. But if the chance is too high, the 
players will all act like superheroes, attempting and succeeding at all kinds of impos­
sible feats. Klug’s solution was to give players a budget of Hero Points, which they 
could use in risky situations to alter dice rolls to their favor. Since each player only 
got a small number of points to use on each adventure, players had to be very careful 
about when to use them—but when they did use them, it was to enact spectacular 
events that truly captured the essence of the James Bond books and films.
It is true that many designers do not use the Lens of Essential Experience. They 
just kind of follow their gut instinct and stumble across game structures that hap­
pen to enable experiences that people enjoy. The danger with this approach is that 
it relies on luck to a large extent. To be able to separate the experience from the 
game is very useful: if you have a clear picture in your mind of the experiences 
your players are having and what parts of your game enable that experience, you 
will have a much clearer picture of how to make your game better, because you will 
know which elements of the game you can safely change and which ones you can­
not. The ultimate goal of the game designer is to deliver an experience. When you 
have a clear picture of your ideal experience and its essential elements, your design 
has something to aspire to. Without that goal, you are just wandering in the dark.
All That’s Real Is What You Feel
All this talk of experience brings out an idea that is very strange indeed. The only 
reality that we can know is the reality of the experience. And we know that what we 
experience is “not really reality.” We filter reality through our senses and through 
our minds, and the consciousness we actually experience is a kind of illusion—not 
really reality at all. But this illusion is all that can ever be real for us, because it is us. 
This is a headache for philosophers, but a wonderful thing for game designers, 
because it means that the designed experiences that are created through our games 
have a chance of feeling as real and as meaningful (and sometimes more so) than 
our everyday experiences.
We will explore that further in Chapter 10, “The Player’s Mind,” but right now 
we should take a moment to consider where these experiences actually take place.

CHAPTER Three • THE EXPERIENCE TAKES PLACE IN A VENUE
The Shifting Sands of Platform
A tremendous amount of discussion takes place in the digital game realm about 
platforms. Players and designers are constantly debating about PC vs. console vs. 
mobile vs. tablet vs. web vs. handheld vs. arcade vs. etcetera vs. etcetera. Which 
is the best? The most profitable? The most fun? The most likely to still be here in 
three years? It is human nature to assume that when something is successful, it 
will remain that way forever. But it isn’t the case. Some things stay, and some go. 
Television mostly replaced radio, but it didn’t replace movies. Arcade gaming was 
replaced by PC gaming, which was replaced by console gaming, but then PC gam­
ing came back, and mobile and tablet gaming rose up. Is it random? Absolutely not. 
The thing that makes specific technologies come and go from our lives is as old 
and persistent as humanity itself. The mistake that we make again and again is 
to focus too much on the existing technologies (which, though new and shiny, are 
ephemeral) and to forget to focus on something so familiar as to be invisible: the 
places in our lives that we use those technologies. I like to call these venues.
It takes a bit of a mental shift to look past the technologies we use and instead to 
see the patterns of how we use them, but it is a good exercise, as it helps to give us 
insight about the past, present, and future of gameplay. I’ll share with you here the 
system of venues that I use to think about gameplay. It’s not a perfect system—it has 
both gaps and overlaps—but again and again I have found it useful when thinking 
about what kind of gameplay works best where and why.
Private Venues
Gameplay is often aided by privacy. To take the risk of immersing yourself in a fan­
tasy world, we like to be in a safe place, either alone or surrounded by people we 
know and trust. Naturally, some of the most important play spaces are in the home.

Private Venues
The Hearth
One of the defining aspects of the human species is our relationship with fire. 
Before we understood how to use fire, we lived much more like animals. Once we 
mastered and tamed fire, it changed us culturally, psychologically, and physically. 
It gave us light, warmth, and safety. It let us cook our food, allowing a simpler diges­
tive system and larger brains. Tending a fire was an around-the-clock responsibility, 
making families and large social groups more important than ever. Today, open 
fires are obsolete, but homes are still built with fireplaces, because it just “feels 
wrong” not to have one. Some anthropologists have theorized that the trance we fall 
into when staring at a fire may be an evolved behavior—if your mind finds it peace­
ful and tranquil to stare at a fire for hours on end, you have a tremendous survival 
advantage over someone else who gets distracted and lets it go out.
In most modern homes, the TV screen has replaced the fireplace. And it makes a 
pretty good substitute. It’s the right size, it gives light in the darkness, it flickers in 
a similar way, and instead of relying on family members to entertain each other by 
telling stories, this modern fire tells its own stories.
Not surprisingly, the hearth is also a good place for gameplaying. It seems to work 
best for games that can entertain multiple people, either by letting them play together 
or by being fun to watch. Nintendo’s Wii proved an excellent game system for hearth 
play, with a collection of games that not only could the whole family play but were 
also quite entertaining just to watch because of all the physical involvement in a 
virtual world. From the hearth point of view, it is hardly surprising that Nintendo’s 
follow-up system, the Wii U, was largely a disappointment, with a focus on a separate 
handheld screen that only one player could see and enjoy. Similarly, popular games 
about singing and dancing, such as SingStar and Dance Central, are natural fits for the 
hearth, as we’ve been singing and dancing around the fire for over a million years.
When new technologies arrive, people are quick to suggest an end to the hearth. 
“The end of television” or “the end of game consoles” is often shouted in the press. 
And surely, yes, the way we enjoy stories, songs, and gameplay in the heart of our 
home will continue to change and evolve, but the hearth has been with us since the 
dawn of humanity—don’t expect it to vanish anytime soon.
The Workbench
Most homes have some kind of private space set aside for working on hard problems. 
Whether it be an actual workbench in the basement for woodworking and repair 
projects, a sewing machine for making and fixing clothes, or a desk in a quiet cor­
ner for doing homework or writing, I refer to these collectively as “the workbench.” 
These places tend to be solitary and quiet and often a bit messy, since work is messy 
and guests to the home don’t usually visit these places. When computers came into 
the home, they very quickly found their way to “workbench” areas, since both work 
and play on a computer tend to be intense and solitary. It is interesting to note the 

28
CHAPTER Three • THE EXPERIENCE TAKES PLACE IN A VENUE
differences between “workbench” and “hearth” games. World of Warcraft and other 
massively multiplayer games, for all their popularity, have tended to stay at the 
“workbench” and out of the hearth. The success of Valve’s Steam network stems 
greatly from the fact that other game networks (e.g., Sony, Microsoft, Nintendo, and 
Apple) are focused mostly on other venues, leaving Steam to own the workbench.
Workbench games tend to be difficult and intense and can require hours of play 
at a time. They tend not to involve family members but may involve online play 
with others who are like-minded about the importance of the challenges the games 
provide. I find it very likely that as head-mounted virtual reality display systems 
start to come into the home, they will tend to take up residence at the workbench.
The Reading Nook
Reading is a relatively new pastime for humans, only coming into popularity in 
the last couple thousand years, but it has taken firm root. There is something 
magical about sitting alone with a text and letting it carry your mind away to a 
different world full of exciting and interesting people and places. Books are 
portable—we can read anywhere, but there are places we very much prefer to 
read. Most people prefer not to read in the hearth unless they are home alone, as 
it tends to be noisy and full of interruptions. Reading at the workbench isn’t very 
preferable either, because though it is private and quiet, it generally isn’t very 
comfortable. The workbench is a very “lean forward” place, whereas reading is 
more of a “lean back” activity. Typical reading nooks are in the bedroom or what­
ever room in the house that has a quiet chair or couch away from the TV.
But what does reading have to do with playing games? The connection isn’t 
obvious. PC gaming and game consoles are not good fits for the reading nook. 
When Apple announced the iPad, the game industry was not impressed. It didn’t 
have the convenience of a mobile phone that let you play games anywhere, and 
it didn’t have a control system that let players play the kinds of experiences so 
popular at the hearth and the workbench, so the game industry largely dismissed it. 
But the iPad caught on and quickly became a significant force in gaming. Why? 
Because it is the perfect platform for gameplay in the reading nook. Playing tablet 
games in bed, or on a couch, or in some quiet corner is very peaceful and relaxing, 
much like reading a book. And the games that succeed on tablets are very differ­
ent than ones that succeed on game consoles or on PC. They are easier, simpler, 
and more relaxing—the right kind of play to suit the reading nook.
Public Venues
Not all gameplay happens in the home, of course. The world is an exciting place, 
full exciting people, places, and things to visit. The secret to location-based enter­
tainment (LBE) has been well known for thousands of years. Whether you are 

29
Public Venues
running a tavern, a theater, a restaurant, a brothel, a theme park, or a video arcade, 
the rule is the same: give them something they can’t get at home.
The Theater
There is something magic about theaters. They come in many shapes and sizes and 
many purposes. Whether they be for plays, movies, musical performances, sporting 
events, or even planetarium shows, they have one thing in common: a large number 
of people gather to witness something together. Something magical happens when a 
crowd focuses on a sequence of events simultaneously. Somehow, we get something 
from the other people in the audience. I sometimes think we are able to subcon­
sciously sense how others are feeling about the performance, and it helps focus our 
own feelings. This is probably why so many TV shows feature laugh tracks—there 
is something about appreciating an experience together that feels very satisfying.
But it is this very crowd that makes playing games in the theater such a problem. 
Games, being interactive, want to be a unique experience for each player. Time and 
again, people have tried to make theatrical experiences where everyone in the audi­
ence participates, but there have not been any long-term successes yet. The joy of 
interactivity is watered down proportionately by the number of seats, either making 
for an experience that gets tiresome quickly or for a theater so small as to be unprof­
itable. It is possible that someone will find a way to use technology to overcome this 
difficulty—but any solution that does so will have to be very clever indeed.
The Arena
For thousands of years, competitive games have taken place in specialized fields of 
play. From chariot racing, to boxing, to team sports of all kinds, they all take place 
in the arena. Most of the time, the arena is large and out of doors, in a place spe­
cially designed for that type of gameplay. Baseball diamonds, golf courses, soccer 
fields, tennis courts, and horse tracks—all of these are a kind of arena. In addition 
to being specialized for this kind of gameplay, most of the time, the arena is in a 
public place, making it possible for others to witness what takes place there—in 
other words, who wins and who loses is not private, but rather a matter of public 
record. And since people can get pretty excited about watching these games, in 
many cases, a theater forms around the arena, creating two venues in one!
So far, digital gameplay has made little impact in the traditional outdoor sports 
arena. But that hasn’t stopped digital gameplay from taking on the characteristics 
of arena play. Multiplayer first-person shooters are very much a kind of arena play: 
though the players are technically in the workbench or the hearth, their minds are 
in the arena. And, more and more, virtual theaters are springing up around this 
play, as more and more people are watching each other play digital games, either 
live (hundreds of taverns now support “BarCraft” events, where people gather to 

30
CHAPTER Three • THE EXPERIENCE TAKES PLACE IN A VENUE
watch live broadcasts of StarCraft tournaments) or recorded, via YouTube or twitch.
tv. While certainly the lines are blurring, I suspect that over time, with new mobile 
and augmented reality technology, we will see traditional sporting arenas become 
ever more digital.
The Museum
Sometimes we need a break from the things in our day-to-day life, and we have 
a sense that by examining exotic things and places, we will get a dose of much 
needed variety, we will expand our knowledge of the world, and perhaps most 
importantly, we will return home with a new perspective that gives new life to 
the commonplace things around us. Of course, museums of every sort fall into the 
category I call the museum, but so do many other things. Zoos and aquariums are 
sorts of museums, and when we go sightseeing, we treat the city we visit as a sort 
of museum. Even shopping trips to unusual stores are a sort of museum visit, as we 
look at, and imagine owning, all sorts of new and exotic objects.
Gameplay might seem like an unusual partner for the museum, but many games 
are right at home there. More and more, actual museums incorporate gameplay 
experiences as a way to introduce visitors to information about what they are view­
ing. And visiting a video arcade has a very museum-like quality, as you pass from 
game to game, trying each and thinking about which ones you like best.
Half Private/Half Public Venues
Other venues exist somewhere between the privacy of the home and the openness 
of a public venue, or they find a way to exist in both. The flexibility of these spaces 
that live on the boundary between public and private is what makes them interest­
ing and important.
The Gaming Table
There is something very special about the games that are played around a table. 
There is a special face-to-face intimacy as the players sit like gods over the toy world 
they control. Certainly, we can do this in the home, but we have a tendency to do it 
mostly when guests are over, making our home a bit more public than it normally 
is. But table games also exist in more public places, such as a pool table at a bar or a 
poker table in a casino. There is something about table games that creates a special 
intensity in players. Curiously, both the sandwich and the sushi roll were invented 
at about the same time (the eighteenth century), though in very different parts of 
the world, by table gameplayers who were so obsessed with their games that they 
needed a way to eat without having to stop the game.

31
Venues Mixed and Matched
Board, card, and dice games have long been the mainstay of the gaming table. So 
far, excepting some experimental board games, digital games have not found much 
of a home at this venue, probably because of their reliance on vertical screens. As 
touch screens grow cheaper and larger, it is entirely possible that a whole new world 
of digital games will come into the table games venue.
The Playground
As adults who are excited about games, we can sometimes forget that play is largely 
the domain of children. And while children like to play in different ways in the home 
and they sometimes enjoy the formality of playing sports in arena-like venues, they 
also like to play out-of-doors with their friends. When we hear the world “play­
ground,” our first thought is often of play equipment at public parks. And while that 
is one sort of playground, any space where children gather for improvisational play, 
be it a backyard, a street, a vacant lot, or a cave in the woods, is a kind of playground.
Playground play is easy for adults to forget about, because we mostly don’t play 
that way anymore. But children always will, and they must—it is an important part 
of their development. The video game industry has largely ignored playground play 
so far, because it hasn’t been feasible for them to create games that work there—but 
as technology becomes more rugged and more mobile, that will likely change.
Anywhere
Some games don’t really care where they are played. Crossword puzzles, Sudoku, 
and Word Find games are classic examples of “play anywhere” games, which can 
be very useful on the bus or when you have a few spare minutes at work or school. 
Of course, the explosion of smartphone games has changed the anywhere venue 
forever, creating a vastly richer set of games that can be played anywhere, at any 
time. However, it is worth noting that these games, due to their interruptibility and 
small screen size, have some distinct qualities. They tend to be playable in tiny 
bites, and they tend to have very simple interfaces and stories. Additionally, because 
they are just filling a few minutes here and there during one’s day, players are gen­
erally not willing to pay very much for them up front, preferring them to be free if 
possible. In Chapter 31, “Profit,” we’ll talk more about the specifics of these games 
and the peculiarities of their business models.
Venues Mixed and Matched
It’s easy to find gaps and overlaps in this system of venues. What venue am I in 
when I play a game of pinball at a restaurant? What venue is a bowling alley? Is a 
casino a museum, an arena, a collection of table games, or something else entirely? 

32
CHAPTER Three • THE EXPERIENCE TAKES PLACE IN A VENUE
The important thing isn’t to have a perfect taxonomy of venues; the important thing 
is to see past the games and platforms so that you are aware of the venues and 
their properties, because while games and technologies change constantly, venues 
change very little. To that end, here is a lens to help you see the truth.
Now that we’ve talked about experiences and where they take place, we need to 
confront a more troubling question. What exactly makes a game a game?

provoking book about the relationship between humans and the spaces they live

Lens #3: The Lens of the Venue
The places that we play exert tremendous influence on the design of our games. 
To make sure you aren’t designing in a vacuum, ask yourself these questions:
●
●
What type of venue best suits the game I’m trying to create?
●
●
Does my venue have special properties that will influence my game?
●
●
What elements of my game are in harmony with my venue? What elements 
are not?

CHAPTER Four • THE EXPERIENCE RISES OUT OF A GAME
It is wonderful to talk about the design of experiences. Creating great experiences 
is indeed our goal. But we cannot touch experiences. We cannot manipulate them 
directly. What a game designer can control, can get his hands in, is the game. The 
game is your clay, and you will shape it and mold it to create all kinds of fabulous 
game experiences.
So what kind of games are we talking about? In this book, we mean all kinds 
of games: board games, card games, athletic games, playground games, party 
games, gambling games, puzzle games, arcade games, electronic games, com­
puter games, videogames, and just about any other game that you might think of, 
for, as we’ll see, the same principles of design apply to all of them. It is a little sur­
prising that with such variety between these kinds of games, we recognize them 
all as one kind, that is, as different as they are, we intuitively recognize them all 
as games.
What is it that these things have in common? Or, to put it another way, how do 
we define “game”?
A Rant about Definitions
Before we continue, I want to be clear about why we should seek such a definition. 
Is it so that we know what we mean when we say “game”? No. For the most part, 
we all know what we are talking about when we say game. It is true that the idea of 
what game (or any term) means will vary a bit from person to person, but mostly, 
we all know what a game is. Sometimes, in a discussion, a debate may arise about 
whether something is “truly a game,” forcing the discussion participants to clarify 
their own personal definition of what a game is, and once that is settled, the dis­
cussion moves on. There is nothing wrong with people having their own personal 
opinions about the proper definition of a game and what is or is not really a game, 
just as they may have similar opinions about what really is or not “music,” “art,” 
or “a sport.”
Some people, mostly academics, do not hold this view. They view the lack of 
standardized definitions in the world of game design as “a crisis” that is holding 
back the art form. Usually, the people most concerned about this are the farthest 
removed from the actual design and development of games. So how do real-world 
designers and developers get by without a standardized vocabulary? Just like 
everyone else: when there is ambiguity, they simply explain what they mean. 
Does this sometimes slow down discussions and therefore the design process? 
Yes and no. Yes, it requires that at times, designers have to stop and explain what 
they mean, which can slow things down a little (and only a little). On the other 
hand, this pause for clarification often saves time in the long run, since after the 
pause, the designers are definitely each clear about what the other means.

35
A Rant about Definitions
Would it be best if there was some centralized dictionary of standard terms we 
could all refer to when discussing issues of game design? It would certainly be con­
venient, but it is far from necessary, and the fact that we don’t have such a diction­
ary is far from a “barrier” or a “crisis.” It is just a slight inconvenience, because it 
means we sometimes have to stop and think about what we mean and what we are 
trying to say. In fact, having to do this, in the long run, may make us better design­
ers, not weaker ones, since we are forced to think just a little bit more. Further, such 
a dictionary would hardly be a gold standard for all time—as technologies change, 
they force us to reconsider some of our old definitions and terms, redefine some of 
them, and create new terms—so the process of definition and redefinition is likely 
to continue indefinitely or at least as long as there are advances in technology that 
are relevant to games.
Others say that the “real problem” with a lack of game design vocabulary is not 
a problem of standardized definitions, but a lack of terms, at all, to discuss some 
of the complex ideas that arise as part of the game design process. Therefore, they 
argue it is urgent that we try to put names on all these things. This is putting the 
cart before the horse, though, for the real problem we have is not a lack of words 
to describe elements of game design—the problem is a lack of clear thinking about 
what these ideas really are. As with many fields of design, game designers fol­
low their gut instincts and feelings about what makes a good or a bad game and 
sometimes have difficulty articulating what exactly it is about a certain design 
that is good or bad—they just know it when they see it, so they are able to design 
great things. And you can certainly get by this way. What is important is to state 
clearly what you mean when you say a design is good or bad and how, specifically, 
it can improve. It is not a matter of knowing the vocabulary of game design—it is 
a matter of knowing the ideas of game design—what we call them matters little. 
Standardized terms for these things will evolve over time—this is not a process that 
can be rushed. The terms designers find useful will survive, the ones they don’t will 
fall by the wayside.
That said, clear statements about important game design ideas, and terms 
to refer to them, are introduced all the time, and several are introduced in this 
book. These are not meant to be canonical definitions, but rather a clear expres­
sion of ideas that I hope you can use. If you have better ideas, or better terms, 
please use them instead—if your ideas and terms are indeed clear and strong, 
they will catch on and help other people more clearly think and express what 
they mean.
Some of the ideas we will have to deal with are necessarily murky. Terms like 
“experience,” “play,” and “game” are defined differently by different people, and 
considering that the ideas these terms represent do not have clear definitions even 
after the thousands of years we’ve been thinking and talking about them, it is 
unlikely they will be rigidly defined anytime soon.

36
CHAPTER Four • THE EXPERIENCE RISES OUT OF A GAME
Does this mean we should shy away from trying to define them? By no 
means. Defining things forces you to think about them clearly, concisely, and 
analytically. Having a list of terms and their definitions would teach you little. 
Embarking on the journey of trying to define these terms will teach you a great 
deal and strengthen your ability to think about design, even though the defini­
tions you end up with may prove imperfect. For this reason, you may find this 
chapter offers you more questions than it does answers. But that’s okay: the goal 
of this book is to make you a better designer, and a good designer must think.
So What Is a Game?
Now that we have discussed why we should define these things, let’s give it a try, 
beginning with some things we can say for sure about games. Here’s a start:
A game is something you play.
I don’t think anyone will disagree with that. But it doesn’t tell us very much. For 
example, is a game different than a toy? Yes. Games are more complex than toys and 
involve a different kind of play. We even use different languages:
A toy is something you play with.
Okay, interesting. Since toys are simpler than games, maybe we should try defin­
ing them first. Let’s see if we can do better with our definition of toy. You can play 
with friends, and they aren’t toys. Toys are objects.
A toy is an object you play with.
Well, that’s something. But I might play with a roll of tape while I talk on the 
phone. Does that make it a toy? Technically, yes, but probably not a very good one. 
In fact, anything you play with could be classified as a toy. Perhaps it is a good idea 
for us to start considering what makes for a good toy. “Fun” is one word that comes 
to mind in conjunction with good toys. In fact, you might say:
A good toy is an object that is fun to play with.
Not bad. But what do we mean when we say “fun?” Do we simply mean pleasure, 
or enjoyment? Pleasure is part of fun, but is fun simply pleasure? There are lots of 
experiences that are pleasurable, for example, eating a sandwich or lying in the sun, 
but it would seem strange to call those experiences “fun.” No, things that are fun 
have a special sparkle, a special excitement to them. Generally, fun things involve 
surprises. So a definition for fun might be:
Fun is pleasure with surprises.
Can that be right? Can it be that simple? It is strange how you can use a word 
your whole life and know for certain what it means, but not be able to express it 
clearly when asked. A good way to test definitions is to come up with counter­
examples. Can you think of things that are fun, but not pleasurable, or fun, but 
don’t involve some feeling of surprise? Conversely, can you think of things that are 
pleasurable and have surprises but aren’t fun? Surprise and fun are such important 
parts of every game design that they become our next two lenses.

37
So What Is a Game?
So, back to toys. We say that a toy is an object you play with, and a good toy is 
an object that is fun to play with. But what do we mean by play? This is a tricky 
one. We all know what play is when we see it, but it is hard to express. Many people 
have tried for a solid definition of what play means, and most of them seem to have 
failed in one way or another. Let’s consider a few.
Play is the aimless expenditure of exuberant energy.
—Friedrich Schiller
This is an expression of the outdated “surplus energy” theory of play that the 
purpose of play is to expend extra energy. Throughout the history of psychology, 
Lens #5: The Lens of Fun
Fun is desirable in nearly every game, although sometimes fun defies analy­
sis. To maximize your game’s fun, ask yourself these questions:
●
●
What parts of my game are fun? Why?
●
●
What parts need to be more fun?
Lens #4: The Lens of Surprise
Surprise is so basic that we can easily forget about it. Use this lens to remind your­
self to fill your game with interesting surprises. Ask yourself these questions:
●
●
What will surprise players when they play my game?
●
●
Does the story in my game have surprises? Do the game rules? Does the 
artwork? The technology?
●
●
Do your rules give players ways to surprise each other?
●
●
Do your rules give players ways to surprise themselves?
Surprise is a crucial part of all entertainment—it is at the root of humor, strat­
egy, and problem solving. Our brains are hardwired to enjoy surprises. In an 
experiment where participants received sprays of sugar water or plain water 
into their mouths, the participants who received random sprays considered 
the experience much more pleasurable than participants who received the 
sprays according to a fixed pattern, even though the same amount of sugar 
was delivered. In other experiments, brain scans revealed that even during 
unpleasant surprises, the pleasure centers of the brain are triggered.

38
CHAPTER Four • THE EXPERIENCE RISES OUT OF A GAME
there has been a tendency to oversimplify complex behaviors, and this is an early 
example of that. It also uses the word “aimless,” as if play did not have goals, which 
it most certainly does. Surely we can do better than this.
Play refers to those activities which are accompanied by a state of comparative 
pleasure, exhilaration, power, and the feeling of self-initiative.
—J. Barnard Gilmore
That certainly covers some of the territory. Those are certainly things that are 
often associated with play. But it doesn’t seem complete, somehow. Other things are 
also associated with play, like imagination, competition, and problem solving. At 
the same time, this definition is too broad. For example, an executive might work 
hard to land a contract and in doing so experience “comparative pleasure, exhilara­
tion, power, and the feeling of self-initiative,” but it would seem strange to call that 
an act of play. Let’s try something else.
Play is free movement within a more rigid structure.
—Katie Salen and Eric Zimmerman
This unusual definition, from the book Rules of Play, is an attempt to create a 
definition of play so open that it can include things like “the play of the light along 
the wall” and “the play of a car’s steering wheel.” And while it is hard to find some­
thing we would call play that is not covered by this definition, one can easily come 
up with examples of what seem to be nonplay activities that do fit. For example, if 
a child is forced to scrub the kitchen floor, the child is enjoying (enjoying may be 
the wrong word) free movement (can slide the brush around freely) within a more 
rigid structure (the floor), but it would sound strange to classify this activity as play. 
Nonetheless, thinking about your game from the point of view of this definition can 
be interesting. Perhaps a different definition can better capture the spirit of play.
Play is whatever is done spontaneously and for its own sake.
—George Santayana
This one is interesting. First, let us consider spontaneity. Play is quite often sponta­
neous. When we talk about someone being “playful,” that is part of what we mean. But 
is all play spontaneous? No. Someone might plan a softball game months in advance, 
for example, but when the game finally happens, it is still “play.” So spontaneity is 
sometimes part of play, but not always. Some consider spontaneity so important to the 
definition of play that any attempt to dampen it renders an activity not play. Bernard 
Mergen states his view: “Games, competitive games, which have a winner or a loser, 
are not, in my definition, play.” This viewpoint is so extreme as to seem ­ridiculous—by 
this logic, games (as we typically think of them) are not something you can play. This 
extreme aside, spontaneity does seem to be an important part of play.

39
So What Is a Game?
But how about the second part of Santayana’s definition: “done for its own sake”? 
By this, he seems to mean “we play because we like to.” As trivial as it sounds, this 
is an important characteristic of play. If we don’t like to do it, it probably isn’t play. 
That is, an activity itself cannot be classified as a “work activity” or “play activity.” 
Instead, what matters is one’s attitude about the activity. As Mary Poppins tells us 
in the Sherman brothers’ wonderful song, “A Spoonful of Sugar,”
In ev’ry job that must be done
There is an element of fun.
You find the fun and snap!
The job’s a game.
But how do we find the fun? Consider the story that psychologist Mihaly 
Csikszentmihalyi (pronounced “Chick sent me high”) relates about how factory 
worker Rico Medellin turns his job into a game:
The task he has to perform on each unit that passes in front of his station 
should take forty-three seconds to perform— the same exact operation almost 
six hundred times in a working day. Most people would grow tired of such work 
very soon. But Rico has been at this job for over five years, and he still enjoys it. 
The reason is that he approaches his task in the same way an Olympic athlete 
approaches his event: How can I beat my record?
This shift in attitude turned Rico’s job from work into play. How has it affected 
his job performance? “After five years, his best average for a day has been twenty-
eight seconds per unit.” And he still loves doing it: “‘It’s better than anything else,’ 
Rico says. ‘It’s a whole lot better than watching TV.’”
What is going on here? How does simple goal setting suddenly redefine an activ­
ity we would normally classify as work into an activity that is clearly a kind of 
play? The answer seems to be a change in the reason he is doing the activity. He 
is no longer doing it for someone else; he is now doing it for his own personal 
reasons. Santayana actually elaborates on his definition, stating that upon further 
examination,
Work and play … become equivalent to servitude and freedom.
When we work, we do it because we are obligated to. We work for food because 
we are slaves to our bellies. We work to pay the rent because we are slaves to our 
safety and comfort. Some of this servitude is willing servitude, such as willingness 
to earn money to care for our families, but it is servitude nonetheless. We are doing 
it because we have to, not because “we feel like it.” The more obligated you are to do 
something, the more it feels like work. The less obligated you are to do something, 
the more it feels like play. Stated differently, “It is an invariable principle of all play … 
that whoever plays, plays freely. Whoever must play cannot play.”
Building off of this, I’d like to share my own definition of play, which, though 
imperfect like these others, has its own interesting perspective. I often find when 
trying to define things about human activity, it can be useful to pay less attention 

40
CHAPTER Four • THE EXPERIENCE RISES OUT OF A GAME
to the activity itself and more attention to the thoughts and feelings that motivate 
the activity. I can’t help but notice that most play activities seem to be attempts to 
answer questions like the following:
●
●
“What happens when I turn this knob?”
●
●
“Can we beat this team?”
●
●
“What can I make with this clay?”
●
●
“How many times can I jump this rope?”
●
●
“What happens when I finish this level?”
When you seek to answer questions freely, of your own volition, and not because 
you are obligated to, we say you are curious. But curiosity doesn’t immediately 
imply you are going to play. No, play involves something else—play involves willful 
action, usually a willful action of touching or changing something—manipulating 
something, you might say. So one possible definition would be:
Play is manipulation that indulges curiosity.
When Rico tries to beat his assembly line goal, he is trying to answer the ques­
tion: “Can I beat my record?” Suddenly, the reason for his activity is not to earn 
money to pay the rent, but instead to indulge his curiosity about a personal question.
This definition calls some things play that we might not ordinarily think of as 
play, such as an artist experimenting on canvas. On the other hand, he might say he 
is “playing with color.” A chemist who tries an experiment to test a pet theory—is 
she playing? She might say she is “playing with an idea.” This definition has flaws 
(can you find them?), but I do find it a useful perspective, and personally, it is my 
favorite definition of play. It also brings us to Lens #6.
Lens #6: The Lens of Curiosity
To use this lens, think about the player’s true motivations—not just the goals 
your game has set forth but the reason the player wants to achieve those goals. 
Ask yourself these questions:
●
●
What questions does my game put into the player’s mind?
●
●
What am I doing to make them care about these questions?
●
●
What can I do to make them invent even more questions?
For example, a maze-finding videogame might have a time-limit goal such 
that at each level, players are trying to answer the question: “Can I find my 
way through this maze in 30 seconds?” A way to make them care more would 
be to play interesting animations when they solve each maze, so players might 
also ask the question: “I wonder what the next animation will be?”

We’ve come up with some definitions for toys and fun and even made a good solid run 
at play. Let’s try again to answer our original question: How should we define “game”?
Earlier we stated that “a game is something you play,” which seems to be true, 
but isn’t narrow enough. As with play, many people have tried to define “game.” 
Let’s look at a few of these.
Games are an exercise of voluntary control systems, in which there is a contest 
between powers, confined by rules in order to produce a disequilibrial outcome.
—Elliot Avedon and Brian Sutton-Smith
Wow. Very scientific! Let’s pick it apart.
First, “an exercise of voluntary control systems”: that is, like play, games are 
entered willfully.
Second, “a contest of powers”: that does seem to be part of most games. Two or 
more things are striving for dominance. Some single-player games don’t always 
feel this way (would you really call Tetris a contest of powers?), but this phrase gets 
across two things: games have goals, and games have conflict.
Third, “confined by rules”: a very important point! Games have rules. Toys do 
not have rules. Rules are definitely one of the defining aspects of games.
Fourth, “a disequilibrial outcome”: disequilibrial is an interesting word. It does not 
simply mean “unequal”; it instead implies that at one time, there was equilibrium, but 
that it was then lost. In other words, things started out even, but then somebody won. 
This is certainly true of most games—if you play, you either win or lose.
So this definition points out some key qualities important to games:
Q1. Games are entered willfully.
Q2. Games have goals.
Q3. Games have conflict.
Q4. Games have rules.
Q5. Games can be won and lost.
Let’s consider another definition—this time, not from academia but from the 
world of design:
[A game is] an interactive structure of endogenous meaning that requires play­
ers to struggle toward a goal.
—Greg Costikyan
Some of this is pretty clear, but what in the world is “endogenous”? We’ll get to 
that shortly. Let’s take this one apart, like the last one.

42
CHAPTER Four • THE EXPERIENCE RISES OUT OF A GAME
First, “an interactive structure”: Costikyan wants to make it very clear that the 
player is active, and not passive, and that the player and game interact with one 
another. This is definitely true of games—they have a structure (defined by the 
rules) with which you can interact and which can interact with you.
Second, “struggle toward a goal”: again, we see the idea of a goal, and struggle 
implies some kind of conflict. But it implies more—it implies challenge. Partly, 
Costikyan seems to be trying to define not just what makes a game but what makes 
a good game. Bad games have little challenge or too much challenge. Good games 
have just the right amount.
Third, “endogenous meaning”: endogenous is an excellent term that Costikyan 
brought from the world of biology to game design, and it means “caused by factors 
inside the organism or system,” or “internally generated.” So what is “endogenous 
meaning?” Costikyan is making the very important point that things that have value 
inside the game have value only inside the game. Monopoly money only has meaning 
in the context of the game of Monopoly. It is the game itself that gave it that meaning. 
When we play the game, the money is very important to us. Outside the game, it is 
completely unimportant. These ideas and terms are very useful to us, because they 
are often an excellent measure of how compelling a game really is. The game of rou­
lette does not have to be played with real money—it can be played with tokens or play 
money. But the game, on its own, generates little endogenous value. People will only 
play it when real money is at stake, because it just isn’t that compelling a game. The 
more compelling a game is, the greater the “endogenous value” that is created within 
the game. Some massively multiplayer role playing games have proved so compelling 
to people that imaginary game items are actually bought and sold for real money out­
side the game. Endogenous value is such a useful perspective that it becomes Lens #7.
Lens #7: The Lens of Endogenous Value
A game’s success hinges on the players’ willingness to pretend it is important. 
To use this lens, think about your players’ feelings about items, objects, and 
scoring in your game. Ask yourself these questions:
●
●
What is valuable to the players in my game?
●
●
How can I make it more valuable to them?
●
●
What is the relationship between value in the game and the players’ 
motivations?
Remember, the value of the items and score in the game is a direct reflection 
of how much players care about succeeding in your game. By thinking about 
what the players really care about and why, you can often get insights about 
how your game can improve.

43
No, Seriously, What Is a Game?
An example of the Lens of Endogenous Value: The game Bubsy for the SNES and 
Sega Genesis is a fairly standard platform game. You play a cat who tries to navigate 
to the end of levels, defeating enemies and avoiding obstacles and collecting yarn 
balls for extra points. However, the points serve no purpose other than to measure 
how many things you have collected. No other in-game reward is given for earning 
points. Most players gather yarn balls at first, with the expectation that they are 
valuable, but after playing a short while, they completely ignore them, focusing 
only on defeating enemies, avoiding obstacles, and getting to the end of the level. 
Why? Because the player’s motivation (see Lens #6, Curiosity) is merely to complete 
the levels. A higher score doesn’t help that, and thus the yarn balls have no endog­
enous value. Theoretically, a player who defeated all the levels might have a new 
motivation: defeat them again, but this time getting the highest score possible. In 
practice, the game itself was so difficult that the number of players who actually 
completed the game must have been small indeed.
Sonic the Hedgehog 2, for the Sega Genesis, was a similar platform game, but did 
not suffer from this problem. In Sonic 2, you collect rings instead of yarn balls, and 
the number of rings collected is very important to players—the rings have a lot of 
endogenous value. Why? Because carrying rings helps protect you from enemies, 
and every time you collect one hundred rings, you receive an extra life, which 
increases the chances you will be able to complete all the levels. In the end, 
Sonic 2 was a much more compelling game than Bubsy, and one of the reasons was 
this mechanism, which clearly shows its importance through endogenous value.
Costikyan’s definition gives us three new qualities that we can add to our list:
Q6. Games are interactive.
Q7. Games have challenge.
Q8. Games can create their own internal value.
Let’s consider one more definition of game:
A game is a closed, formal system, that engages players in structured conflict, 
and resolves in an unequal outcome.
—Tracy Fullerton, Chris Swain, and Steven Hoffman
Most of this has been covered by the previous definitions, but there are two parts 
of this one I want to pick out:
First, “engages players”: it is a good point that players find games to be engaging, 
that is, they make players feel “mentally immersed.” Technically, we might argue 
this is a quality of good games, though not all games, but it is an important point.
Second, “a closed, formal system”: this implies a lot of things. “System” means 
games are made of interrelated elements that work together. “Formal” is just a way 
of saying that the system is clearly defined, that is, it has rules. “Closed” is the 
interesting part here. It means that there are boundaries to the system. This hasn’t 

44
CHAPTER Four • THE EXPERIENCE RISES OUT OF A GAME
been mentioned explicitly yet in the other definitions, although the idea of endog­
enous value does imply it. Much has been made of this boundary at the edge of the 
game. Johan Huizinga called it “the magic circle,” and it does indeed have a kind 
of magical feeling to it. When we are mentally “in the game,” we have very differ­
ent thoughts, feelings, and values than when we are “out of the game.” How can 
games, which are nothing more than sets of rules, have this magical effect on us? 
To understand, we have to look to the human mind.
Let’s review the list of game qualities we have picked out of these various 
definitions:
Q1. Games are entered willfully.
Q2. Games have goals.
Q3. Games have conflict.
Q4. Games have rules.
Q5. Games can be won and lost.
Q6. Games are interactive.
Q7. Games have challenge.
Q8. Games can create their own internal value.
Q9. Games engage players.
Q10. Games are closed, formal systems.
That’s a lot, isn’t it? Alan Kay, the computer researcher, once advised me: “If 
you’ve written a software subroutine that takes more than ten arguments, look 
again. You probably missed a few.” This was his way of saying that if you need a 
long list to convey what you mean, you should find a better way to regroup your 
ideas. And indeed, this list of ten things does not seem complete. It is likely that we 
have missed a few.
It does seem odd that something as simple, compelling, and innate to us as 
the playing of games would require such an unwieldy definition. But maybe we’re 
approaching this the wrong way. Instead of approaching the gameplay experience 
from the outside in, that is, focusing on how games relate to people, as we have 
been doing, perhaps we should look from the other direction: How do people relate 
to games?
What is it that people like so much about games? People give many answers 
to this question that are true for some but not all games: “I like playing with my 
friends,” “I like the physical activity,” “I like feeling immersed in another world,” 
and many more. But there is one answer that people often give when they talk about 
playing games, which seems to apply to all games: “I like solving problems.”
That’s kind of weird, isn’t it? Normally, we think of problems as something nega­
tive. But we really do get pleasure from solving them. And, as humans, we are 
really good at solving problems. Our big complex brains can solve problems better 

45
No, Seriously, What Is a Game?
than any of the other animals, and this is our primary advantage as a species. So 
it should not seem strange that it is something we enjoy. The enjoyment of problem 
solving seems to be an evolved survival mechanism. People who enjoy solving 
problems are going to solve more problems and probably get better at solving prob­
lems and be more likely to survive.
But is it really true that most games involve problem solving? One is hard pressed 
to come up with a game that does not. Any game with a goal effectively has pre­
sented you with a problem to solve. Examples might be:
●
●
Find a way to get more points than the other team.
●
●
Find a way to get to the finish line before the other players.
●
●
Find a way to complete this level.
●
●
Find a way to destroy the other player before he destroys you.
Gambling games, at first, seem like a possible exception. Is someone playing 
craps really trying to solve a problem? Yes. The problem is how to take the right 
calculated risks and make as much money as possible. Another tricky example is 
a game where the outcome is completely random, such as the children’s card game 
of War. In War, the two players each have a stack of playing cards. In unison, they 
each flip over the top card from their stack to see who has the higher card. The 
player with the higher card wins the round keeping both cards. In the case of a tie, 
more cards are flipped, and the winner gets a larger take. Play continues until one 
player has all the cards.
How could a game like that possibly involve any problem solving? The outcome 
is predetermined—the players make no choices; they just gradually reveal who the 
winner will be. Nonetheless, children play this game just as happily as any other 
and draw no special distinction about this game differing somehow from other 
games. This baffled me for some time, so I took the cultural anthropologist point 
of view. I played the game with some children and tried hard to remember what 
it felt like to be a child playing War. And the answer quickly became obvious. For 
children, it is a problem-solving game. The problem they are trying to solve is “can I 
control fate and win this game?” And they try all kinds of ways to do it. They hope, 
they plead to the fates, they flip over the cards in all kinds of crazy ways—all super­
stitious behaviors, experimented with in an attempt to win the game. Ultimately, 
they learn the lesson of War: you cannot control fate. They realize the problem is 
unsolvable, and at that point, it is no longer a game, just an activity, and they soon 
move on to games with new problems to solve.
Another possible objection one might raise is that not every activity associated 
with gameplaying is a problem-solving activity. Often, the things people enjoy most 
about games, such as social interaction or physical exercise, have nothing to do 
with problem solving. But while these other activities might improve a game, they 
are not essential to the game. When problem solving is removed from a game, it 
ceases to be a game and becomes just an activity.

46
CHAPTER Four • THE EXPERIENCE RISES OUT OF A GAME
So if all games involve some kind of problem solving and problem solving is one 
of the things that define us as a species, perhaps we should look more closely at the 
mental mechanisms we use for problem solving to see if they have anything to do 
with the properties of games.
Problem Solving 101
Let’s consider what we do when we solve a problem and how it might relate to our 
numbered list of game qualities.
One of the first things we do is to state the problem we are trying to solve, that 
is, define a clear goal (Q2). Next, we frame the problem. We determine its boundar­
ies and the nature of the problem space. We also determine what methods we are 
allowed to use to solve the problem; that is, we determine the rules of the problem 
(Q4). How we do this is kind of hard to describe. It is not a completely verbal pro­
cess. It is almost as if our minds are equipped to set up an internal, minimized, sim­
plified version of reality that only includes the necessary interrelationships needed 
to solve the problem. This is like a cleaner, smaller version of the real-world situa­
tion, which we can more easily consider and manipulate or interact with (Q6). In a 
sense, we are establishing a closed, formal system (Q10) with a goal. We then work 
to reach that goal, which is usually challenging (Q7), because it involves some kind 
of conflict (Q3). If we care about the problem, we quickly become engaged (Q9) in 
solving it. When we are occupied in doing so, we kind of forget about the real world, 
since we are focused on our internal problem space. Since this problem space is not 
the real world and just a simplified version of it and solving the problem is impor­
tant to us, elements in the problem space quickly gain an internal importance, if 
they get us closer to our goal of solving the problem, and this importance does not 
need to be relevant outside the context of the problem (Q8). Eventually, we defeat 
the problem or are defeated by it, thus winning or losing (Q5).
Now we see the magic circle for what it really is: our internal problem-solving 
system. This does not make it any less magical. Somehow, our minds have the abil­
ity to create miniature realities based on the real world. These microrealities have 
so effectively distilled the essential elements of reality for a particular problem that 
manipulations of this internal world, and conclusions drawn from it, are valid and 
meaningful in the real world. We have little idea of how this really works—but it 
does work very, very well.
Could our definition of game possibly be this simple?
A game is a problem-solving activity.
That can’t be right. It might be a true statement, but it is too broad. There are lots 
of problem-solving activities that are not play. Many of them feel more like work. 
Many of them (“How can we reduce the production costs of these widgets by 8%?”) 
literally are work. But we’ve already determined that the difference between a play 

47
The Fruits of Our Labor
activity and a work activity has nothing to do with the activity itself, but one’s 
motivation for doing the activity. Astute readers will notice that only nine of our ten 
qualities were covered in our problem-solving analysis. A key quality “games are 
entered willfully” (Q1) was omitted. No, games cannot simply be problem-solving 
activities. One who plays them must also have that special, hard-to-define attitude 
that we consider essential to the nature of play. So a definition that nicely covers all 
ten qualities might be:
A game is a problem-solving activity, approached with a playful attitude.
This is a simple, elegant definition, which has the advantage of no fancy jargon. 
Whether you accept this definition or not, viewing your game as a problem to be 
solved is a useful perspective, and that perspective is Lens #8.
The Fruits of Our Labor
So we have embarked on a long journey of defining our terms. Let’s review what 
we came up with:
●
●
Fun is pleasure with surprises.
●
●
Play is manipulation that satisfies curiosity.
●
●
A toy is an object you play with.
●
●
A good toy is an object that is fun to play with.
●
●
A game is a problem-solving activity, approached with a playful attitude.
So are these the keys to the secrets of the universe? No. They only have value 
if they give you some insight into how to make better games. If they do, great! If 
not, then we had best move on and find something that will. You might not even 
agree with these definitions—if that’s the case, then good for you! It means you are 
Lens #8: The Lens of Problem Solving
To use this lens, think about the problems your players must solve to suc­
ceed at your game, for every game has problems to solve. Ask yourself these 
questions:
●
●
What problems does my game ask the player to solve?
●
●
Are there hidden problems to solve that arise as part of gameplay?
●
●
How can my game generate new problems so that players keep coming 
back?

48
CHAPTER Four • THE EXPERIENCE RISES OUT OF A GAME
thinking. So keep thinking! See if you can come up with better examples than what 
I have here. The whole point of defining these terms is to gain new insights—it is 
the insights that are the fruits of our labors, not the definitions. Perhaps your new 
definitions will lead to new and better insights that can help us all. One thing I feel 
certain of:
The whole truth regarding play cannot be known until the whole truth regard­
ing life itself is known.
—Lehman and Witty
So let’s not dawdle here. We’ve spent enough time thinking about what a game is. 
Now let’s go see what a game is made of.

CHAPTER Five • THE GAME CONSISTS OF ELEMENTS
What Are Little Games Made Of?
When my daughter was 3 years old, she became quite curious one day about what 
different things were made of. She ran around the room, excitedly pointing to 
things, trying to stump me with her questions:
“Daddy, what is the table made of?”
“Wood.”
“Daddy, what is the spoon made of?”
“Metal.”
“Daddy, what is this toy made of?”
“Plastic.”
As she looked around for a new object, I turned it around on her, with a question 
of my own.
“What are you made of?”
She paused to consider. She looked down at her hands, turning them over and 
studying them. And then, brightly, she announced:
“I’m made of skin!”
And for a three-year old, this is a perfectly reasonable conclusion. As we get 
older, of course, we learn more about what people are really made of—the complex 
relations between bones, muscles, organs, and the rest. Even as adults, though, our 
understanding of human anatomy is incomplete (can you point to your spleen, for 
instance, or describe what it does or how?), and this is acceptable for most of us, 
because we generally know enough to get by.
But we expect more from a doctor. A doctor needs to know, really know, how 
everything works inside us, how it all interrelates, and, when something goes 
wrong, how to figure out the source of the problem and fix it.

51
The Four Basic Elements
If you have just been a gameplayer up until now, you probably haven’t thought too 
much about what a game is made of. Thinking about a videogame, for example, you 
might, like most people, have a vague idea that a game is this kind of story world, with 
some rules and a computer program lurking around somewhere in there that somehow 
makes it all go. And that’s enough for most people to know in order to get by.
But guess what? You’re a doctor now. You need to know, intimately, what your 
patients (games) are really made of, how their pieces all fit together, and what makes 
them tick. When things go wrong, you’ll need to spot the true cause and come up with 
the best solution, or your game will surely die. And if that doesn’t sound hard enough, 
you’ll be asked to do things that most doctors are never asked: to create new kinds of 
organisms (radically new games) no one has ever seen before and bring them to life.
Much of this book is devoted to developing this essential understanding. Our 
study of anatomy begins with an understanding of the four basic elements that 
comprise every game.
The Four Basic Elements
There are many ways to break down and classify the many elements that form a 
game. I have found that the categories shown in Figure 5.3, which I call the elemen­
tal tetrad, are very useful. Let’s look briefly at each of the four and how they relate 
to the others:
	1.	 Mechanics: These are the procedures and rules of your game. Mechanics 
describe the goal of your game, how players can and cannot try to achieve 
it, and what happens when they try. If you compare games to more linear 
F I G U R E

52
CHAPTER Five • THE GAME CONSISTS OF ELEMENTS
entertainment experiences (books, movies, etc.), you will note that while lin­
ear experiences involve technology, story, and aesthetics, they do not involve 
mechanics, for it is mechanics that make a game a game. When you choose 
a set of mechanics as crucial to your gameplay, you will need to choose 
technology that can support them, aesthetics that emphasize them clearly to 
players, and a story that allows your (sometimes strange) game mechanics 
to make sense to the players. Mechanics will be given detailed attention in 
Chapters 12 through 14.
	2.	 Story: This is the sequence of events that unfolds in your game. It may be linear 
and prescripted, or it may be branching and emergent. When you have a story 
you want to tell through your game, you have to choose the mechanics that will 
both strengthen that story and let that story emerge. Like any storyteller, you 
will want to choose the aesthetics that help reinforce the ideas of your story 
and the technology that is best suited to the particular story that will come out 
of your game. Story, and its special relationship with game mechanics, will be 
studied in Chapters 17 and 18.
	3.	 Aesthetics: This is how your game looks, sounds, smells, tastes, and feels. 
Aesthetics are an incredibly important aspect of game design since they have 
the most direct relationship to a player’s experience. When you have a certain 
look, or tone, that you want players to experience and become immersed in, you 
will need to choose a technology that will not only allow the aesthetics to come 
through but amplify and reinforce them. You will want to choose the mechanics 
that make players feel like they are in the world that the aesthetics have defined, 
and you will want a story with a set of events that let your aesthetics emerge at 
the right pace and have the most impact. The skill of choosing aesthetics that 
reinforce the other elements of the game to create a truly memorable experience 
will be examined in Chapter 22.
	4.	 Technology: We are not exclusively referring to “high technology” here, but to 
any materials and interactions that make your game possible such as paper and 
pencil, plastic chits, or high-powered lasers. The technology you choose for your 
game enables it to do certain things and prohibits it from doing other things. 
The technology is essentially the medium in which the aesthetics take place, in 
which the mechanics will occur, and through which the story will be told. We 
will talk in detail about how to choose the right technology for your game in 
Chapter 28.
It is important to understand that none of the elements are more important than 
the others. The tetrad is arranged here in a diamond shape not to show any rela­
tive importance but only to help illustrate the “visibility gradient,” that is, the fact 
that technological elements tend to be the least visible to the players, aesthetics 
are the most visible, and mechanics and story are somewhere in the middle. It can 
be arranged in other ways. For example, to highlight the fact that technology and 
mechanics are “left brain” elements, whereas story and aesthetics are “right brain” 

53
The Four Basic Elements
elements, you might arrange the tetrad in a square. To emphasize the strong con­
nectedness of the elements to one another, they could be arranged as a tetrahedral 
pyramid—it really doesn’t matter.
The important thing to understand about the four elements is that they are all 
essential. No matter what game you design, you will make important decisions 
about all four elements. None is more important than the others, and each one 
powerfully influences each of the others. I have found that it is hard to get people 
to believe in the equality of the four elements. Game designers tend to believe that 
mechanics are primary; artists tend to believe the same about aesthetics; engi­
neers, technology; and writers, story. I suppose it is human nature to believe your 
piece is the most important. But, believe me, as a game designer, they are all your 
piece. Each has an equally powerful effect on the player’s experience of your game, 
and thus, each deserves equal attention. This point of view is crucial when using 
Lens #9.
Consider the design of the game Space Invaders (Taito 1978) by Toshihiro 
Nishikado. If (somehow) you aren’t familiar with the game, do a quick web search 
so that you understand the basics. We will consider the design from the points of 
view of the four basic elements.
Technology: All new games need to be innovative in some way. The technology 
behind Space Invaders was custom designed for the game. It was the first video-
game that allowed a player to fight an advancing army, and this was only pos­
sible due to the custom motherboard that was created for it. An entirely new set 
of gameplay mechanics was made possible with this technology. It was created 
solely for that purpose.
Mechanics: The gameplay mechanic of Space Invaders was new, which is always 
exciting. But more than that, it was interesting and well balanced. Not only 
does a player shoot at advancing aliens that shoot back at him, the player can 
Lens #9: The Lens of the Elemental Tetrad
To use this lens, take stock of what your game is truly made of. Consider each 
element separately and then all of them together as a whole.
Ask yourself these questions:
●
●
Is my game design using elements of all four types?
●
●
Could my design be improved by enhancing elements in one or more of the 
categories?
●
●
Are the four elements in harmony, reinforcing each other and working 
together toward a common theme?

54
CHAPTER Five • THE GAME CONSISTS OF ELEMENTS
hide behind shields that the aliens can destroy (or that the player can choose 
to destroy himself). Further, there is the possibility to earn bonus points by 
shooting a mysterious flying saucer. There is no need for a time limit, because 
the game can end two ways: the player’s ships can be destroyed by alien bombs 
and the advancing aliens will eventually reach the player’s home planet. Aliens 
closest to the player are easier to shoot and worth fewer points. Aliens farther 
away are worth more points. One more interesting game mechanic is that the 
more of the 48 aliens you destroy, the faster the invading army gets. This builds 
excitement and makes for the emergence of some interesting stories. Basically, 
the game mechanics behind Space Invaders are very solid and well balanced and 
were very innovative at the time.
Story: This game didn’t need to have a story. It could have been an abstract game 
where a triangle shoots at blocks. But having a story makes it far more exciting 
and easier to understand. The original story for Space Invaders, though, was not 
a story of alien invaders at all. It was originally a game where you fired at an 
army of advancing human soldiers. It is said that Taito decided this sent a bad 
message, so the story was changed. The new story, a story about advancing 
aliens, works much better for several reasons:
●
●
Several war-themed games had already been released (e.g., Sea Wolf, 1976). 
A game where you could be in a space battle was actually novel at the time.
●
●
Some people are squeamish about war games where you shoot people (Death 
Race, 1976, had made violence in videogames a sensitive issue).
●
●
The “high-tech” computer graphics lent themselves well to a game with a futur­
istic theme.
●
●
Marching soldiers are necessarily walking on the ground, which means the game 
would have had a “top-down” view. Space Invaders gives the sense that the aliens 
are gradually lowering toward the surface of your planet and you are shooting 
up at them. Somehow, hovering, flying aliens are believable and make for a more 
dramatic story—“if they touch down, we’re doomed!” A change in story allowed 
for a change in camera perspective with a dramatic impact on aesthetics.
Aesthetics: Some may sneer at the visuals, which now seem so primitive, but the 
designer did a lot with a little. The aliens are not all identical. There are three 
different designs, each worth a different amount of points. They each perform a 
simple two-frame “marching” animation that is very effective. The display was 
not capable of color—but a simple technology change took care of that! Since the 
player was confined to the bottom of the screen, the aliens to the middle, and the 
saucer to the top, colored strips of translucent plastic were glued to the screen 
so that your ship and shields were green, the aliens were white, and the saucer 
was red. This simple change in the technology of the game worked only because 
of the nature of the game mechanics and greatly improved the aesthetics of the

Skin and Skeleton
game. Audio is another important component of aesthetics. The marching invad­
ers made a sort of heartbeat noise, and as they sped up, the heartbeat sped up, 
which had a very visceral effect on the player. There were other sound effects 
that helped tell the story too. The most memorable was a punishing, buzzing 
crunch noise when your ship was hit with an alien missile. But not all aesthetics 
are in the game! The cabinet for Space Invaders had a design that was attractive 
and eye-catching that helped tell the story of the evil alien invaders.
Part of the key to the success of Space Invaders was that the four basic ele­
ments were all working hard toward the same goal—to let the player experience 
the fantasy of battling an alien army. Each of the elements made compromises for 
the other, and clearly deficits in one element often inspired the designer to make 
changes in another. These are the sort of clever insights you are likely to have when 
you view your design through the Lens of the Elemental Tetrad.
Skin and Skeleton
We will be discussing the four basic elements in more detail throughout this book 
as well as many other aspects of game anatomy. It is a wonderful thing to learn 
enough so that you can see past the skin of a game (the player’s experience) into 
the skeleton (the elements that make up the game). But you must beware of a ter­
rible trap that many designers fall into. Some designers, thinking constantly about 
the detailed internal workings of games, forget about the player experience. It is not 
enough to merely understand the various game elements and how they interrelate 
with one another—you must always consider how they relate to the experience. 
This is one of the great challenges of game design: to simultaneously feel the experi­
ence of your game while understanding which elements and elemental interactions 
are causing that experience and why. You must see skin and skeleton at once. If you 
focus only on skin, you can think about how an experience feels, but not under­
stand why it feels that way or how to improve it. If you focus only on skeleton, you 
can make a game structure that is beautiful in theory, but potentially horrible in 
practice. If you can manage to focus on both at once, you can see how it all works 
while feeling the power of your game’s experience at the same time.
In Chapter 2, we discussed the importance and the challenge of observing and 
analyzing your own experiences. As challenging as that is, it is not enough. You 
must also be able to think about the elements in your game that make the experi­
ence possible. This takes practice, just as the observation techniques of Chapter 2 
take practice. Essentially, the skill you need to develop is the ability to observe your 
own experience while thinking about the underlying causes of that experience.
This important skill is called holographic design, and it is detailed in Lens #10.

56
CHAPTER Five • THE GAME CONSISTS OF ELEMENTS
In future chapters, we will say much more about the elements that make up a game. 
Now let’s turn our attention to the reason these elements need to work together.
Lens #10: The Lens of Holographic Design
To use this lens, you must see everything in your game at once: the four ele­
ments and the player experience, as well as how they interrelate. It is accept­
able to shift your focus from skin to skeleton and back again, but it is far better 
to view your game and experience holographically.
Ask yourself these questions:
●
●
What elements of the game make the experience enjoyable?
●
●
What elements of the game detract from the experience?
●
●
How can I change game elements to improve the experience?

CHAPTER Six • THE ELEMENTS SUPPORT A THEME
To write a mighty book, you must choose a mighty theme.
—Herman Melville
Mere Games
Great themes and deep meanings are often associated with literature or with great 
works of art. Is it pretentious for a “mere game” to aspire to the same levels of 
greatness?
As game designers, we must confront the painful truth that many people view 
games, in all their forms, as meaningless diversions. Usually, when I press people 
who hold this view, I can get them to admit some game that is very important to 
them. Sometimes it is a sport, either one they have played or one they watch reli­
giously. Sometimes it is a card or board game that formed the cornerstone of their 
relationship with someone important to them. Sometimes it is a videogame with 
a storyline and characters that they identify with. When I point out the hypocrisy 
of games as meaningless, but a game as meaningful, they explain, “Well, it really 
wasn’t the game I cared about—it was the experience that went with the game.” But 
as we’ve discussed, experiences aren’t just associated with games at random; they 
are what emerge when players interact with a game. The parts of the experience 
that are important to people, such as the drama of a sporting event, the camaraderie 
between bridge players, or the rivalry of chess enthusiasts, all are determined by 
the design of the game.
Some people make the argument that games, especially videogames, cannot be 
deep and meaningful because they are simply too primitive in nature. The same 
argument was made about film at the beginning of the twentieth century when it 
was silent and black and white. As technology increased, this argument faded away. 
And the same is happening for games. In the 1970s, videogames were so simplified 
as to be almost completely abstract. Today, they can include text, pictures, video, 
sound, and music. As technology advances, more and more aspects of human life 
and expression will be integrated into games. There is nothing that cannot be part 
of a game. You can put a painting, a radio broadcast, or a movie into a game, but 
you cannot put a game into these other things. All these other types of media, and 
all media that is to come, are subsets of games. At their technological limit, games 
will subsume all other media.
Really, the problem is that games have only recently emerged as anything like a 
serious medium of expression. It will take time for the world to grow used to this 
idea. But we have no reason to wait. We can create games with powerful themes 
right now. But why? Why do this? Out of a selfish need for artistic expression? No. 
Because we are designers. Artistic expression is not our goal. Our goal is to create 
powerful experiences. It is possible to create games that do not have themes or that 

59
Unifying Themes
have very weak themes. However, if our games have unifying, resonant themes, the 
experiences we create will be much, much stronger.
Unifying Themes
The primary benefit of basing your design around a single theme is that all of the 
elements of your game will reinforce one another, since they will all be working 
toward a common goal. Sometimes it is best to let a theme emerge as you are cre­
ating the game. The sooner you have settled on a theme, the easier things will be 
for you, because you will have an easy method of deciding if something belongs in 
your game or not: If it reinforces the theme, it stays, but if it doesn’t, it goes.
There are two simple steps to using a theme to strengthen the power of your 
game’s experience:
Step 1: Figure out what your theme is.
Step 2: Use every means possible to reinforce that theme.
Sounds easy, but what is a theme? The theme is what your game is about. It is 
the idea that ties your entire game together—the idea that all the elements must 
support. If you don’t know what your theme is, it is very likely that your game is not 
engaging people as much as it could. Most game themes are experience based; that 
is, the goal of the design is to deliver an essential experience to the player.
Designer Rich Gold describes an elementary example of theming in his book 
The Plenitude. As a child, he had a book about elephants. The idea of the book 
was simple: to deliver an experience to children that lets them understand what 
elephants were. In a sense, you could say the theme was “What are elephants?” So, 
step 1 is done. This brings us to step 2: use every means possible to reinforce that 
theme. The authors did the obvious—the book contained text about elephants and 
pictures of elephants. But they took it a step further and cut the entire book, cover 
and pages, into the shape of an elephant, as well. At every turn, you need to look for 
opportunities to reinforce your theme in clever and unexpected ways.
Let me give a more detailed example based on a virtual reality game I worked 
on for Disney called Pirates of the Caribbean: Battle for the Buccaneer Gold. Our 
team (the Disney VR Studio) was given the assignment of creating an interactive 
adaptation of the popular Pirates of the Caribbean theme park ride, which can be 
seen in various incarnations at all the Disney parks. We knew we were going to 
put it in a Computer Augmented Virtual Environment (CAVE), which is basically 
a small room with 3D projections on the walls at DisneyQuest (Disney’s virtual 
reality center at Disney World), and the experience had to be about five minutes 
long, but no storyline or specific game goals had been set.

60
CHAPTER Six • THE ELEMENTS SUPPORT A THEME
We already had the beginnings of a theme: this attraction was going to be about 
pirates, which narrowed things down, but we were hoping to be more specific. 
What point of view did we want to take about pirates? There are several we could 
have taken:
●
●
A historical documentary about pirates.
●
●
A battle between competing pirate ships.
●
●
A search for hidden pirate treasure.
●
●
Pirates are villains and must be destroyed.
Several others came to mind as well. You can see that even with something as nar­
row as “pirates,” we still didn’t really have a theme, because there are many possible 
experiences around the idea of pirates that we could create. We started doing research, 
looking for game ideas, aesthetic ideas, and hopefully a clear, unifying theme.
We read a lot about the history of pirates, and we looked at pirate-themed video-
games other people had made. We talked to people who had been involved in the 
creation of the original Pirates of the Caribbean ride. We got lots of good details 
but were not getting much closer to a theme. One day, we all piled into a car and 
headed down to Disneyland to study the ride up close. We rode the ride dozens of 
times before park hours frantically scribbling notes and snapping pictures. There 
is a huge amount of detail in the ride—it is incredibly compelling. We could see 
that details were going to be very important. But what about the story? Weirdly, 
the Pirates of the Caribbean ride doesn’t tell a coherent story. It just features several 
immersive tableaus of pirates doing pirate things. In a sense, this is a real strength: 
the story is left to the rider’s imagination.
So, we learned some good things from riding, but we still didn’t have a theme. 
We interviewed park employees, and when the park opened, we chatted with guests 
about their feelings about the ride. We got lots of great details about how the ride 
looks, how it makes people feel, and what their favorite parts were, but none of it 
really clued us into a solid point of view for our theme.
On the way home in the car, as we talked over the thousands of details we had 
observed, we fretted a little that we still didn’t have a clear path forward. As we 
sat and thought, it was almost impossible not to hum the catchy theme song from 
the ride, having heard it so many times… “Yo ho, yo ho, a pirate’s life for me.” And 
suddenly it became clear! The Pirates of the Caribbean ride is not about pirates; it is 
about being a pirate! The whole goal of the ride is to fulfill the fantasy of what it is 
like to throw aside the rules of society and just start being a pirate! It might sound 
obvious in retrospect, but this shift in our thinking crystallized everything. This 
was not a historical recreation, and it was not about destroying pirates. It was about 
fulfilling the pirate fantasy that everyone has bubbling just below the surface, and 
what better way to create this feeling of being a pirate than through an immersive, 
interactive experience? We now had our experience-based theme: the fantasy of 
being a pirate.

61
Unifying Themes
And so step one was completed. We knew our theme. Now for step two, use 
every means possible to reinforce that theme. And we really did work hard to use 
everything we could to do just that. Some examples include the following:
●
●
CAVE shape: In the past, we had used square and hexagonal CAVES. We created 
a new, four-screen CAVE shape that was better suited to a pirate ship simulation.
●
●
Stereoptics: Not every CAVE experience uses stereoptics, but we chose to do so, 
because of the sense of depth they give. Letting your eyes focus on infinity really 
helped make it feel like you were out at sea.
●
●
Modified 3D glasses: Many off-the-shelf 3D glasses for theaters have blinders on 
the side to reduce distractions when watching a movie. We knew that a person’s 
sense of motion is strongly influenced by their peripheral vision, so these blind­
ers were a problem—they were detracting from our theme, since players weren’t 
getting enough of a sense of sailing at sea. We made arrangements with the 
manufacturer to have the blinders cut off.
●
●
Motion platform: We wanted to give the feeling of a rocking, swaying boat. 
A motion platform seemed like a good idea, but what kind? Eventually, we custom-
built a platform using pneumatics, because it felt the most like a ship at sea.
●
●
Interface: Part of the pirate fantasy is steering a ship, and part of it is firing 
cannons. We could have used joysticks or other off-the-shelf hardware, but that 
wouldn’t be very good theming. Instead, the ship is steered with a ship’s wheel, 
and we had real metal cannons that players would use to aim and fire.
●
●
Visuals: We had to make things look beautiful. The ride features a kind of 
“hyperreal” look, which fits perfectly with our theme. We used high-end graph­
ics hardware and rich textures and models to achieve a similar look.
●
●
Music: Through some pains, we got permission to use the music from the ride. 
It captures the theme so well and connects the game to the ride, in a powerful 
nostalgic way.
●
●
Audio: Our sound designers created a custom ten-speaker sound system that 
could play sounds from all directions, making you feel like you were out at sea. 
Some of the speakers were designed only to play cannon blasts and were placed 
at precisely the right distance from the boat so that the waveform would hit you 
in the stomach, so you would not just hear but feel the cannons firing.
●
●
A feeling of freedom: Piracy is all about freedom. Our gameplay mechanics were 
designed to let players sail wherever they chose but at the same time ensure the 
players have an exciting time. Details of how this was accomplished will be dis­
cussed in detail in Chapter 18, “Indirect Control.”
●
●
Dead men tell no tales: How to handle death in the game was a real question. 
Some advocated that this was a videogame, and we should handle it like video-
games traditionally do: if you die, there is some penalty, and then you come back 
to life, to play again. This didn’t fit in well with our theme of living the pirate 

62
CHAPTER Six • THE ELEMENTS SUPPORT A THEME
fantasy—in the fantasy, you don’t die, or if you do, it is in an incredibly dramatic 
way, and you do not return. Further, we were trying very hard to maintain a dra­
matic interest curve (explained in Chapter 16) for our five-minute experience, since 
drama is part of the pirate fantasy. If the players could suddenly die in the middle 
of the game, it would spoil that. Our solution was to make players invulnerable 
throughout the majority of the game, but if they took too many hits over the course 
of the experience, their ship would sink dramatically at the end of the final battle. 
This broke with videogame tradition, but theme is more important than tradition.
●
●
Treasure: Collecting vast hordes of treasure is an essential part of the pirate 
fantasy. Unfortunately, piles of gold are actually pretty hard to render convinc­
ingly in a videogame. We came up with a special technique that made flat, hand-
painted treasures seem to be solid, dimensional objects that sat prominently on 
the ship’s deck.
●
●
Lighting: We needed to light the room the players stood in. How could we 
theme that? We used special filters on the light that made it look like it was light 
reflected off of water.
●
●
A place for my stuff: People who step up to the controls need a place to put their 
bags, purses, etc. We could have just made a shelf. Instead, we created bags out 
of fishing nets that really look like they belong on a boat.
●
●
Air conditioning: The people in charge of facilities in the building where the 
game was going to go asked if we cared where the air conditioning vents in the 
room were placed. Our first thought was “who cares?” But then we thought, 
“How can we use this to reinforce our theme?” The vents were placed at the front 
of the ship, blowing back, so players feel a breeze as they sail their ship.
●
●
The eyes of bluebeard: One thing we never figured out how to theme was the 3D 
glasses. We experimented with making them look like pirate hats and bandanas, 
but it didn’t really work. One witty gentleman suggested that players should be 
forced to wear eye patches, so the 3D effect was unnecessary. In the end, we 
gave up and let that detail go unthemed. To our surprise, when the game had 
been installed at Disney World and we went to try it out, the cast member who 
was about to lead us on board proclaimed, “Before ye board, ye must wear the 
Eyes of Bluebeard.” This was surprising, because it was not in the “official script” 
given to cast members. The ride attendants succeeded where we had failed. It 
was a simple and effective way to theme a detail that escaped us and a powerful 
illustration that when you have a strong unifying theme, it makes it easier for 
everyone on the team to make useful contributions.
This is not a complete list. Everything we did and every decision we made were 
focused on whether it would reinforce the theme and deliver the essential experi­
ence we wanted to get across. You might argue that without a big budget, you can’t 
afford to do fancy theming. But many theming details are really quite inexpensive. 
They can be a line of text, or a color choice, or a sound effect. And theming is 

63
Resonance
fun—once you get in the habit of trying to make as many things as possible fit your 
theme, it’s hard to stop. But why would you stop? And this gives us Lens #11.
Resonance
A unifying theme is good—it focuses your design toward a single goal. But some 
themes are better than others. The best themes are ones that resonate with players—
themes that touch players deeply. The “fantasy of being a pirate” theme is powerful 
because it is a fantasy that everyone—kids, adults, men, and women—has had at 
one time or another. In a sense, it resonates with our desire to be free—free from 
our obligations, free from our worries and cares, free to do what we want, when 
we want to.
When you manage to tap into one of these resonant themes, you have some­
thing deep and powerful that has a true ability to move people and to give them an 
experience that is both transcendent and transforming. Earlier we discussed that 
some themes are experience based, that is, they are all about delivering a certain 
essential experience. When this experience is one that resonates with the fantasies 
and desires of your players, it will be an experience that quickly becomes impor­
tant to them. But there is another kind of theme that can be just as resonant as an 
experience-based theme, sometimes more so. This is the truth-based theme.
Consider the movie Titanic. This film deeply moved audiences the world over. 
Why? Sure, it was well executed, and it had great special effects and a sweet (though 
sometimes schmaltzy) love story, but lots of movies have those things. What was 
special here was a deep and resonant theme reinforced by every element of the 
film. So, what was the theme? At first, you might say that the theme was the Titanic 
itself and its tragic accident. And that is an important component of the movie. In 
fact, you could argue that it is a theme of the movie, but it is not the main theme. 
The main theme is not experience based. Instead, it is a simple statement, which I 
would phrase as something like “love is more important than life and stronger than 
death.” This is a powerful statement. But it is a statement that many of us believe 
Lens #11: The Lens of Unification
To use this lens, consider the reason behind it all. Ask yourself these questions:
●
●
What is my theme?
●
●
Am I using every means possible to reinforce that theme?
The Lens of Unification works very well with Lens #9, The Elemental Tetrad. 
Use the tetrad to separate out the elements of your game, so you can more eas­
ily study them from the perspective of a unified theme.

64
CHAPTER Six • THE ELEMENTS SUPPORT A THEME
deeply in our heart of hearts. It is certainly not a scientific truth, but for many, it is 
a deeply held, though rarely expressed, personal truth.
Many Hollywood insiders did not believe this movie could possibly be success­
ful: audiences would know the ending. But where better to tell a story that fits this 
powerful theme than in a place where we know almost everyone is going to die? 
The expensive special effects were not gratuitous—to fully grasp the import of this 
theme, we must feel like it is all real, like we are right there, like we are dying 
ourselves.
Truth-based themes can sometimes be hard to spot. Part of the power of these 
deep truths is that they are hidden. Often, a designer might not even consciously 
know they have chosen a particular theme or be able to express it verbally—they 
just have a certain feeling about how the experience should be. But it is worth the 
trouble to explore your feelings about these things to the point that you can express 
your theme concretely. It will make it much easier for you to decide what should and 
shouldn’t go into your game and make it easier for you to explain the rationale of 
these decisions to others in your team. When Stephen King was writing his famous 
novel Carrie, it was not until he was working on the second draft that he realized 
that this was a novel about blood, not just horror movie blood, but an exploration 
of the many meanings of blood, from injury, to family ties, to coming of age. And 
realizing this, he saw many opportunities to tune and strengthen the story.
An excellent example of a truth-based theme can be seen in Rob Daviau’s fas­
cinating board game Risk: Legacy. In this unusual game, Daviau did something 
never before attempted in the world of board games—he created game mechanics 
such that when you play, choices you make change the game permanently, for all 
time. The rules insist you modify the board with irremovable stickers, write on the 
board in permanent marker to claim territories, rip up and discard game cards, 
and even make permanent modifications to the game rulebook. These unusual 
game mechanics are novel and intriguing, but more importantly, they reinforce the 
game’s central theme: “war changes a world.”
Another example of a truth-based theme is the Hercules story. The VR Studio 
team was asked to create a game based upon Disney’s version of the ancient 
Hercules myth. When a story stays alive, told, and retold, for thousands of years like 
this story has, it is a pretty good clue that there is a truth-based theme hiding inside 
it. Sure, Hercules was a strong man, but that doesn’t seem quite important enough 
that it would so deeply resonate with people. We looked at the various versions of 
the story. Interestingly, there was not one canonical telling, even in ancient times. 
Sometimes Hercules had ten labors, sometimes twelve, and sometimes twenty. But 
there were certain aspects of the story that were always the same. In every story, 
Hercules is a man so virtuous that he defeats death. And this is a truth so deep that 
it is at the heart of many religions: if you are virtuous enough, you can defeat death. 
The Disney animators embodied this theme in Hercules’ conflict with Hades, Lord 
of the Underworld. We continued this theme in our game, by having it take place 
mostly in the Underworld, until the end, when you triumphantly break through to 
the world of the living for a final aerial battle against Hades. There were subthemes 

65
Resonance
too, such as a theme about the importance of teamwork, but ultimately, we placed 
these subthemes in the service of the main theme.
Sometimes you figure out your theme a piece at a time. Here’s another Disney 
story: when we started work on the Toontown Online project (Disney’s first mas­
sively multiplayer game), we were again unsure of our theme. We had done our 
homework on Toontown, studying both the Who Framed Roger Rabbit? movie and 
the Toontown section of Disneyland. Curiously, Toontown was not well defined in 
either place. We could see Toontown was powerful, though. The reason it was so ill 
defined was that everyone seemed to already have a sense of what it was—as if they 
had known all along that there was a special place where cartoon characters lived 
when they weren’t on the screen. This (slightly creepy) fact gave us a sense we were 
tapping into something fundamental and hidden. We started making lists of things 
we thought Toontown seemed to be about. Three big ones stood out:
	1.	 Having fun with your friends
	2.	 Escaping from reality
	3.	 Simplicity and transcendence
The first one lent itself really well to online networked play, and we liked that. 
The second one made a lot of sense—cartoons are a good form of escapism. The 
third one (which we’ll be exploring in more detail in Chapter 19, “Worlds”) is basi­
cally the idea that things are simpler in Toontown than they are in the real world, 
but you are also more powerful in Toontown than you are in the real world.
All of this helped clarify what we wanted to see in the game, but none of it 
really established a clear theme. These felt more like subthemes. At some point, 
we realized that these three things together strongly characterize something that 
back in Chapter 4 we discussed in detail: play. Play is about having fun with your 
friends and escaping from reality, and a play world is simpler than the real world, 
but you have much more power. But we didn’t feel like play was a powerful theme 
on its own. We needed something with more bite, with more conflict. This led us 
to play’s natural opponent: work. And then it was clear—“work vs. play” would be 
a very strong theme. Stated in more detail, “work wants to destroy play, but play 
must survive” was the truth-based theme we arrived at. Replace “work” and “play” 
with “slavery” and “freedom” as we did in Chapter 4, and the power of this theme 
becomes clear. It really felt right. We wanted to create a game that kids and parents 
could play together, with a theme they could both relate to—how better to do that 
than by playfully exploring one of the primary conflicts in their lives? And so we 
did. The story of Toontown Online became a story of robot executives (the Cogs) 
trying to turn colorful Toontown into a dingy office park. The Toons team up to 
fight off the Cogs with gags and practical jokes, and the Cogs fight back with office 
supplies. This story was strange enough that it raised some eyebrows inside the 
company, but we were confident it would work because it was an expression of a 
theme that we knew would resonate with our audience.

66
CHAPTER Six • THE ELEMENTS SUPPORT A THEME
Resonant themes elevate your work from craft to art. An artist is someone who 
takes you where you could never go alone, and a theme is the vehicle for getting 
there. Not every theme needs to be a resonant theme, of course. But when you find a 
deep resonant theme, it makes sense to use it for all it is worth. Some will be experi­
ence based, while others will be truth based. You can never tell which themes are 
resonant just through logic—you have to feel the resonance, deep inside yourself. 
It is an important form of self-listening and is also Lens #12.
Back to Reality
You may think that all this talk of resonant themes is too lofty for game design. 
And for some games, maybe it is. Does Angry Birds have a deep resonant theme? 
Maybe not, but it certainly does have a unifying theme that helped to drive the 
design. Resonant themes can add great power to your work, but even if your game 
doesn’t seem to have one, it will still be strengthened by a unifying theme to focus 
the experience.
Some designers reject the notion of theme, because they say, “the players will 
never notice.” And it is certainly true that the players cannot always state clearly the 
theme of a work that truly moves them—and that is because theme often operates at 
a subconscious level. Players know they like a game, but they can’t quite say why. 
Often, the reason is that all of the elements are reinforcing a theme that is interest­
ing or important to them. Theme is not about some puzzle-based symbolism where 
Lens #12: The Lens of Resonance
To use the Lens of Resonance, you must look for hidden power.
Ask yourself these questions:
●
●
What is it about my game that feels powerful and special?
●
●
When I describe my game to people, what ideas get them really excited?
●
●
If I had no constraints of any kind, what would this game be like?
●
●
I have certain instincts about how this game should be. What is driving 
those instincts?
The Lens of Resonance is a quiet, delicate instrument. It is a tool for listening 
to yourself and listening to others. We bury important things deep inside our­
selves, and when something causes them to resonate, it shakes us to our very 
core. The fact that these things are hidden gives them power but also makes 
them hard for us to find.

the designer intends a secret message. Theme is about focusing your work toward 
something that holds meaning for your players.
Different designers use theme in different ways as part of their design process. 
Now it is time for us to explore the many other aspects of the overall process of 
game design.

When you do that (maybe you have already), you might be thinking that you aren’t 
going about it the right way, not using the methods that “real” game designers use. 
I’m guessing the method you used to design your games was something like:
	1.	 Think of an idea.
	2.	 Try it out.
	3.	 Keep changing it and testing it until it seems good enough.
Which sounds kind of amateurish. Well, guess what? That is exactly what real game 
designers do. And this chapter would end here, except for the fact that some ways to 
do these things are better than others. You already know what to do. In this chapter 
and the next, we are going to discuss how to do it as well as possible.
Inspiration
As I mentioned earlier, I worked for several years as a professional juggler. When 
I was about fourteen years old, and my repertoire of tricks was limited to two, 
I attended my first juggling festival. If you haven’t attended one, they are remark­
able to see—they mainly consist of jugglers of all levels of skill and ability stand­
ing around in a large gymnasium, talking about, experimenting with, and sharing 
new techniques. It is a place where you can attempt the impossible and drop with­
out shame. But attending alone, my first time, it didn’t feel that way. I was incred­
ibly nervous—after all, I wasn’t a “real” juggler. I mostly walked around, eyes 
wide, hands in my pockets, terrified that someone would point and shout, “Hey! 
What’s HE doing here?” But of course, that didn’t happen. Everyone at the festival 
had learned just like I had—they had taught themselves. Once I grew comfortable, 
I shyly took out my beanbags and did a little practicing of my own. I watched 
other people do tricks, and I tried imitating them—sometimes I could do it. But 
as I looked around for more examples of techniques to try, there was one juggler 
who stood out from the rest. He was an old man in a powder blue jumpsuit, and 
his tricks were not like the others at all. He used patterns and rhythms that were 
unique, and his tricks, though not astonishing in their difficulty, were simply beau­
tiful to watch. I had to watch a long time before I realized that some of the tricks 
that seemed so special and unique when he did them were things I could already 
do—but when he did them, they had such a different style, a different feeling, that 
they seemed like something completely new. I watched him for about twenty min­
utes, and suddenly he looked at me and said, “Well?”
“Well, what?” I said, kind of embarrassed.
“Aren’t you going to try to copy me?”
“I—I don’t think I would know how,” I stammered out.

Inspiration
He laughed. “Yeah, they never can. Know why my tricks look so different?”
“Uh, practice?” I managed.
“No—everybody practices. Look around! They’re all practicing. No, my tricks 
look different because of where I get them. These guys, they get their tricks 
from each other. Which is fine—you can learn a lot that way. But it will never 
make you stand out.”
I thought about it. “So where do you get them?” I asked. “Books?”
“Ha! Books. That’s a good one. No, not books. You wanna know the secret?”
“Sure.”
“The secret is: don’t look to other jugglers for inspiration—look everywhere else.” 
He proceeded to do a beautiful looping pattern, where his arms kind of spiraled, 
and he turned occasional pirouettes. “I learned that one watching a ballet in New 
York. And this one…” he did a move that involved the balls popping up and down 
as his hands fluttered delicately back and forth. “I learned that from a flock of geese 
I saw take off from a lake up in Maine. And this,” he did a weird mechanical look­
ing movement where the balls almost appeared to move at right angles. “I learned 
that from a paper punch machine on Long Island.” He laughed a little and stopped 
juggling for a minute. “People try to copy these moves, but they can’t. They always 
try… yeah, look at that fella, over there!” He pointed to a juggler with a long pony­
tail across the gym who was doing the “ballet” move. But it just looked dumb. 
Something was missing, but I couldn’t say what.
“See, these guys can copy my moves, but they can’t copy my inspiration.” He 
juggled a pattern that made me think of a spiraling double helix. Just then, the PA 
announced a beginner’s workshop—I thanked him and ran off. I didn’t see him 
again, but I never forgot him. I wish I knew his name, because his advice changed 
my approach to creativity forever.
Lens #13: The Lens of Infinite Inspiration
When you know how to listen, everybody is the guru.
—Ram Dass
To use this lens, stop looking at your game and stop looking at games like it. 
Instead, look everywhere else.
Ask yourself these questions:
●
●
What is an experience I have had in my life that I would want to share with 
others?
●
●
In what small way can I capture the essence of that experience and put it 
into my game?

CHAPTER Seven • THE GAME BEGINS WITH AN IDEA
Designer Chris Klug encourages all designers to find one key emotional experi­
ence to build your game around, which he calls “the emotional heart of art direc­
tion.” This notion is backed up by others. Four graduate students (Kyle Gabler, Kyle 
Gray, Matt Kucic, and Shalin Shodhan) undertook to create fifty videogames in a 
single semester and wrote about what they learned in the excellent essay “How to 
Prototype a Game in Under 7 Days.” The following is an excerpt:
As an alternative to brainstorming, we found that gathering art and music with 
some personal significance was particularly fruitful. People have commented 
that many of the games like “Gravity Head” or “On a Rainy Day” create a strong 
mood and have strong emotional appeal. It’s no accident. In these and many 
other cases, the soundtrack and initial art created a combined feeling that drove 
much of the gameplay decisions, story, and final art.
Mr. Gabler: “The idea behind ‘Tower of Goo’ came up while I was listening to 
(for some reason) the opening to Astor Piazzolla’s ‘Tango Apasionado’ after 
walking home, and had this drizzly vision of a town at sunset where everyone 
was leaving their houses, carrying out chairs, tables, and anything they could to 
build a giant tower in the center of their city. I didn’t know why exactly, but they 
wanted to climb up and up and up - but they weren’t very good civil engineers 
so you had to help them. The final prototype ended up a little more cheery, and 
I replaced the final music with Piazzolla’s more upbeat ‘Libertango,’ but here’s a 
case where an initial emotional target basically wrote the entire game.”
Inspiration is one of the secrets behind the strongest games. But how can you turn 
inspiration into a great game design?
The first step is admitting you have a problem.
Using this lens requires an open mind and a big imagination. You need to 
search your feelings and observe everything around you. You must be willing 
to try the impossible—for surely it is impossible for a roll of the dice to capture 
the excitement of a swordfight or for a videogame to make a player feel afraid 
of the dark—isn’t it? Use this lens to find the nongame experiences that will 
inspire your game. Your choices in the different quadrants of the tetrad (tech­
nology, mechanics, story, and aesthetics) can each be united by a single inspi­
ration, or each can build on different inspirations, blending them together to 
create something entirely new. When you have concrete visions based on real 
life that guide your decision making, your experience will acquire an undeni­
able power, strength, and uniqueness.
This lens works hand in hand with Lens #1, Essential Experience. Use the 
Lens of Infinite Inspiration to seek and find beautiful experiences and the 
Lens of Essential Experience to bring them into your game.

State the Problem
State the Problem
The purpose of design is to solve problems, and game design is no exception. 
Before you start coming up with ideas, you need to be certain of why you are doing 
it, and a problem statement is a way to state that clearly. Good problem statements 
tell both your goal and your constraints. For example, your initial problem state­
ment might be:
“How can I make a browser-based game that teenagers will really like?”
This makes clear both your goal (something teenagers will really like) and your 
constraints (it must be a browser-based game). One advantage of stating things 
so clearly is that it can make you realize that you might be mistakenly overcon­
straining the real problem. Maybe you’ve been thinking “browser-based game,” but 
really, there is no reason that what you create has to be a game at all—maybe some 
kind of browser-based toy or activity would be okay as long as teenagers really like it. 
So, you might restate your problem in broader terms:
“How can I make a browser-based experience that teenagers really like?”
It is crucial that you get the problem statement right—if you make it too broad, 
you might come up with designs that don’t meet your true goal, and if you make it 
too narrow (because you were focusing on solutions instead of the problem), you 
might cut yourself off from some clever solutions because you assumed that a cer­
tain kind of solution was the only valid one for your problem. People who come up 
with clever solutions are almost always the same people who take the time to figure 
out the real problem.
There are three advantages of clearly stating your problem:
	1.	 Broader creative space. Most people jump to solutions too fast and start their 
creative process there. If you start your process at the problem instead of at a 
proposed solution, you will be able to explore a broader creative space and find 
solutions that are hiding where no one else is looking.
	2.	 Clear measurement. You have a clear measurement of the quality of proposed 
ideas: How well do they solve the problem?
	3.	 Better communication. When you are designing with a team, communication is 
much easier if the problem has been clearly stated. Very often, collaborators will 
be trying to solve quite different problems and not realize it if the problem has 
not been clearly stated.
Sometimes, you will have already explored several ideas before you realize what the 
problem “really” is. That’s fine! Just make sure you go back and restate the problem 
clearly, once you see what it is.
A completed game design will cover all four elements of the elemental tetrad: 
technology, mechanics, story, and aesthetics. Often, your problem statement will 
constrain you to some established decisions about one (or more) of the four ele­
ments, and you will have to build from there. As you try to state your problem, it 

74
CHAPTER Seven • THE GAME BEGINS WITH AN IDEA
can be useful to examine it from the point of view of the tetrad to check where you 
have design freedom and where you don’t. Take a look at these four problem state­
ments: Which ones have already made decisions in what parts of the tetrad?
	1.	 How can I make a board game that uses the properties of magnets in an interest­
ing way?
	2.	 How can I make a videogame that tells the story of Hansel and Gretel?
	3.	 How can I make a game that feels like a surrealist painting?
	4.	 How can I improve on Tetris?
What if, by some miracle, you have no constraints? What if somehow you have the 
liberty to make a game about anything, anything at all, using any medium you 
like? If that is the case (and it seems highly unlikely!), you need to decide some 
constraints. Pick a story you might like to pursue or a game mechanic you would 
like to explore. The moment you pick something, you will have a problem state­
ment. Viewing your game as the solution to a problem is a useful perspective and 
also Lens #14.
How to Sleep
We have stated our problem and are ready to brainstorm! At least we will be, once 
we have properly prepared. Sleep is crucial to the process of idea generation—a 
good designer uses the tremendous power of sleep to its maximum advantage. 
Lens #14: The Lens of the Problem Statement
To use this lens, think of your game as the solution to a problem.
Ask yourself these questions:
●
●
What problem, or problems, am I really trying to solve?
●
●
Have I been making assumptions about this game that really have nothing 
to do with its true purpose?
●
●
Is a game really the best solution? Why?
●
●
How will I be able to tell if the problem is solved?
Defining the constraints and goals for your game as a problem statement can 
help move you to a clear game design much more quickly.

No one explains this better, I think, than surrealist painter Salvador Dali. The 
following (Dali’s Secret #3) is an excerpt from his book Fifty Secrets of Magic 
Craftsmanship:
In order to make use of the slumber with a key you must seat yourself in a bony 
armchair, preferably of Spanish style, with your head tilted back and resting on the 
stretched leather back. Your two hands must hang beyond the arms of the chair, 
to which your own must be soldered in a supineness of complete relaxation…
In this posture, you must hold a heavy key which you will keep suspended, 
delicately pressed between the extremities of the thumb and forefinger of your 
left hand. Under the key you will previously have placed a plate upside down 
on the floor. Having made these preparations, you will have merely to let 
yourself be progressively invaded by a sense of serene afternoon sleep, like the 
spiritual drop of anisette of your soul rising in the cube of sugar of your body. 
The moment the key drops from your fingers, you may be sure that the noise 
of its fall on the upside-down plate will awaken you, and you may be equally 
sure that this fugitive moment during which you cannot be assured of having 
really slept is totally sufficient, inasmuch as not a second more is needed for 
your whole physical and psychic being to be revivified by just the necessary 
amount of repose.

We are so captivated by and entangled in our subjective consciousness that we 
have forgotten the age-old fact that God speaks chiefly through dreams and 
visions.
—Carl Jung
Is Dali crazy? The benefits of a good night’s sleep are easy to believe—but what 
possible benefit could there be in a nap that lasts only a fraction of a second? The 
answer becomes clear only when you consider where your ideas come from. Most 
of our good, clever, creative ideas are not arrived at through a process of logical, 
reasoned argument. No, the really good ideas just seem to pop up out of nowhere; 
that is, they come from somewhere below the surface of our consciousness—a place 
we call the subconscious. The subconscious mind is not well understood, but it is a 
source of tremendous, and possibly all, creative power.
Proof of this power is evident when we consider our dreams. Your subconscious 
has been creating these fascinating little comedies and dramas, each one different, 
three shows nightly, since before you were born. Far from a sequence of random 
images, most people frequently have dreams that are quite meaningful. There are 
many known instances of important problems solved in dreams. One of the most 
famous is the story of the chemist Friedrich Von Kekule who had long been puzzling 

76
CHAPTER Seven • THE GAME BEGINS WITH AN IDEA
over the structure of benzene (C6H6). No matter how he or anyone else tried to make 
the chains of atoms fit together, it didn’t work. Nothing about them made sense, and 
some scientists were wondering if this pointed to a fundamental misunderstanding 
about the nature of molecular bonding. And then, his dream:
Again the atoms danced before my eyes. My mind’s eye, sharpened by many pre­
vious experiences, distinguished larger structures of diverse forms, long series, 
closely joined together; all in motion, turning and twisting like serpents. But 
see what was that? One serpent had seized its own tail and this image whirled 
defiantly before my eyes. As by a lightning flash, I awoke.
And upon awakening, he knew that benzene’s structure was a ring shape. Now, 
would you say Kekule himself thought of the solution? From his description, he 
merely watched the solution play out in front of him and recognized it when he 
saw it. It was as if the author of the dreams had solved the problem and was merely 
presenting it to Kekule. But who is the author of these dreams?
On one level, the subconscious mind is part of us, but on another, it seems to be 
quite separate. Some people become quite uncomfortable at the idea of regarding 
one’s subconscious mind as another person. It is an idea that sounds, well, kind of 
crazy. But creativity is crazy, so that shouldn’t stop us—in fact, it should encourage 
us. So, why not treat it like a separate entity? No one has to know—it can be your 
little secret. Bizarre as it sounds, treating your subconscious like another person 
can be quite useful, because as humans, we like to anthropomorphize things, 
because it gives us a well-understood model for thinking about and interacting 
with them. You won’t be alone in this practice—creative minds have been doing 
it for thousands of years. Stephen King describes his silent partner in his book On 
Writing:
There is a muse (traditionally, the muses were women, but mine’s a guy; I’m 
afraid we’ll just have to live with that), but he’s not going to come fluttering 
down into your writing room and scatter creative fairy-dust all over your 
typewriter or computer station. He lives in the ground. He’s a basement guy. 
You have to descend to his level, and once you get down there you have to 
furnish an apartment for him to live in. You have to do all the grunt labor, 
in other words, while the muse sits and smokes cigars and admires his bowl­
ing trophies and pretends to ignore you. Do you think this is fair? I think 
it’s fair. He may not be much to look at, that muse-guy, and he may not be 
much of a conversationalist (what I get out of mine is mostly surly grunts, 
unless he’s on duty), but he’s got the inspiration. It’s right that you should 
do all the work and burn all the midnight oil, because the guy with the cigar 
and the little wings has got a bag of magic. There’s stuff in there that can 
change your life.
Believe me, I know.

So, if we pretend our creative subconscious is another person, what is that person 
like? You might already have a mental picture of yours. Here are some common 
characteristics of the creative subconscious that most people seem to share:
●
●
Can’t talk, or at least chooses not to. Not in words, anyway. Tends to communi­
cate through imagery and emotions.
●
●
Impulsive. Tends not to plan ahead, tends to live in the moment.
●
●
Emotional. Gets swept up in whatever you are feeling—happy, angry, excited, 
afraid—the subconscious seems to feel things more deeply and more powerfully 
than the conscious mind.
●
●
Playful. It has a constant curiosity and loves wordplay and pranks.
●
●
Irrational. Not bound by logic and rationality, the subconscious comes up with 
ideas that often make no sense. Need to go to the moon? Perhaps a long ladder 
will work. Sometimes these ideas are a useless distraction, but sometimes they 
are the clever perspective you have sought all along—whoever heard of a ring 
molecule, for example?
I sometimes wonder if the long-term appeal of the character of Harpo Marx, from 
the Marx Brothers films, has to do with the fact that he matches the profile of the 
creative subconscious almost perfectly—perhaps this is his resonant theme. Harpo 
doesn’t speak (or doesn’t care to), is impulsive (eats whatever he sees, chases girls, 
gets into fights), is very emotional (always laughing, crying, or having fits of anger), 
is always playful, and is certainly irrational. However, his crazy solutions to prob­
lems often save the day, and in quiet moments, he plays music of angelic beauty—
not for the praise of others but simply for the joy of doing it. I like to think of Harpo 
as the patron saint of the creative subconscious (see Figure 7.2).

CHAPTER Seven • THE GAME BEGINS WITH AN IDEA
Sometimes, though, working with the creative subconscious can make you feel 
like you have a deranged four-year-old living inside your head. Without the rational 
mind to plan things out, take precautions, and set things straight, this guy would 
never survive on his own. For this reason, many people get in the habit of ignoring 
what the subconscious mind suggests. If you are doing your taxes, that is probably 
a good idea. But if you are brainstorming about games, your silent partner is more 
powerful than you are. Keep in mind that he has been creating entertaining virtual 
worlds for you each night, since before you were born, and he is more in touch with 
the essence of experience than you can ever hope to be. Here are some tips for get­
ting the most out of this unusual creative partnership.
Subconscious Tip #1: Pay Attention
“Should we be mindful of dreams?” Joseph asked. “Can we interpret them?”
The Master looked into his eyes and said tersely: “We should be mindful of 
everything, for we can interpret everything.”
—Herman Hesse, The Glass Bead Game
As usual, the key is listening, this time to your self (sort of). The subconscious is no 
different than anyone else: if you get in the habit of ignoring it, it is going to stop 
making suggestions. If you get in the habit of listening to it, seriously considering 
its ideas, and thanking it when you get a good one, it will start to offer more and 
better suggestions. So, how do you listen to something that can’t talk? What you 
must do is pay closer attention to your thoughts, your feelings, your emotions, and 
your dreams, for those are the ways the subconscious communicates. This sounds 
really strange, but it really does work—the more you pay attention to what the sub­
conscious has to say, the more work it will do for you.
For example, say you are brainstorming ideas for a surfing game. You are 
thinking about which beaches it should be set at and what kind of camera sys­
tems are going to be best for a surfing game. Suddenly, you have this inkling of 
an idea: “What if the surfboards were bananas?” which is crazy, of course—and 
where do you think it came from? Now, you could say to yourself, “That’s stupid—
let’s constrain this to reality, please.” Or you could take a few moments and seri­
ously consider the idea: “Okay, so what if the surfboards were bananas?” And 
then another thought comes: “With monkeys surfing on them.” And suddenly, 
this doesn’t seem so dumb—maybe this banana surfing monkey game could be 
something different, something new, something that might gain you a wider audi­
ence than the more realistic game you had originally planned. And even if you 
ultimately reject the idea, your subconscious might feel a little more respected 
and take part more seriously in the brainstorming process because of the time you 
spent considering its suggestions—and what did it cost you? Only a few seconds 
of quiet reflection.

79

Subconscious Tip #2: Record Your Ideas
Certainly you will record your ideas during a brainstorming session, but why 
not record them all the time? The human memory is terrible. By recording all of 
your ideas, two things happen. First, you’ll have a record of many ideas that you 
would likely have forgotten otherwise, and second, you’ll free up your mind to 
think of other things. When you think of an important idea and you don’t write 
it down, it kind of bangs around up there, taking up space and mental energy, 
because your mind recognizes it as important and doesn’t want to forget the 
important idea. Something magic happens when you record it—it is like your 
mind doesn’t feel the need to think about the idea as much. I find it makes my 
mind feel clean and open, as opposed to cluttered and cramped. The Japanese 
call this mental state “mizu no kokoro,” often translated as “mind like water.” 
It leaves the freedom to think seriously about the design of the day, without 
tripping over the clutter of important unrecorded ideas. An inexpensive voice 
recorder or voice recorder app can be an invaluable tool for a game designer. 
Whenever an interesting idea comes to you, just speak it into the recorder and 
deal with it later. You have to have the discipline to periodically transcribe those 
recordings, but really, that is a small price to pay for a huge idea collection and 
a clean mental workspace.
Subconscious Tip #3: Manage Its Appetites (Judiciously)
Let’s be honest here—the subconscious mind has appetites, some of which are pri­
mal. These appetites seem to be part of its job—just as it is the rational mind’s job 
to determine which appetites can be safely fed and how to go about doing that. If 
the subconscious mind feels one of these appetites too strongly, it will obsess about 
it. When it is obsessing, it can’t do good creative work. If you are trying to come 
up with new ideas for a real-time strategy game and all you can think about is 
candy bars or how your girlfriend left you or how much you hate your roommate, 
you aren’t going to be able to get much good work done, because these intrusive 
thoughts will distract you and the source of these intrusive thoughts, your subcon­
scious mind, isn’t getting any work done either and he’s the one who has to do the 
heavy lifting. Maslow’s hierarchy, which we’ll discuss in Chapter 11, “Motivation,” 
is a pretty good guide here—if you don’t have food, safety, and healthy personal 
relationships, it will be hard to do self-actualizing creative work. So, make it a 
priority to get these things worked out, and come up with compromises that will 
keep your subconscious satisfied so it can spend its time coming up with genius 
ideas. Use good judgment, of course—some appetites are dangerous and should be 
curbed, not fed, for if you feed them, they tend to grow, which makes everything 
much worse in the long term. It is possible that the tendency for so many creative 
types to self-destruct may be the result of a close, but poorly managed, relationship 
with their subconscious mind.

CHAPTER Seven • THE GAME BEGINS WITH AN IDEA
Subconscious Tip #4: Sleep
It is a common experience that a problem difficult at night is resolved in the 
morning after the committee of sleep has worked on it.
—John Steinbeck
As Salvador Dali points out, sleep is crucial and not just the slumber with a key. 
We used to think that sleep was for the body—but it has become clear that sleep is 
primarily for the benefit of the mind. Some strange process of sorting, filing, and 
reorganizing seems to be going on when we sleep. Clearly, the subconscious is 
wide awake and active for at least a part of the sleep cycle—the part that features 
dreams. I have built up my relationship with my own creative subconscious to 
the point that I sometimes get a sense of when he “is around” or “is not around,” 
and I certainly find that when I haven’t had enough sleep, often he isn’t around. 
It feels like he takes naps when I (we?) haven’t had enough sleep or at least he isn’t 
participating much in what I’m doing, and this absence shows in my work. I have 
been in more than one brainstorming meeting where I was contributing almost 
nothing useful, and then just following a feeling of him “showing up,” a flood of 
useful ideas came forth.
Subconscious Tip #5: Don’t Push Too Hard
So now you must labor with your brains, and now you must forbear your activ­
ity, and see what the great Soul showeth.
—Ralph Waldo Emerson
You don’t have ideas – they just let you know when they’re ready.
—Stephen Moffat
Did you ever try to think of a name during a conversation, maybe someone you 
know, maybe some movie star, and you know you know it, but just can’t think of it? 
So you squint your eyes and try and force the answer out of your mind—but it just 
doesn’t come. So, you give up and move on, talking about something else. A few 
minutes later, suddenly the answer pops into your mind. Now, where do you think 
that came from? It is as if the subconscious was working on the problem of finding 
that name in the background while you moved on to other things. When it found 
the answer, it gave it to you. No amount of concentration or straining was going to 
move it along faster; in fact, this seems to slow the process down, because who can 
work with someone looming over their shoulder? The same goes for your creative 
work. Don’t expect immediate answers from your subconscious. Give it a problem 
to solve (one more advantage of a clear problem statement!), make clear the problem 

81
Sixteen Nitty-Gritty Brainstorming Tips
is important, and leave it to do its work. The answer might come quickly, it might 
come slowly, or it might not come at all. But nagging and looming won’t make it 
come any faster—it will just slow things down.
A Personal Relationship
You may find that your relationship with your subconscious is different than what 
I describe here. This is expected—different people’s minds work in different ways. 
The important thing is that you find the techniques that work best for you, and the 
only way you can do that is by following your instincts (hints from the subcon­
scious) about what will be creatively productive and start trying experiments. Some 
of these will be necessarily strange. Slumber with a key is strange, but it worked 
for Dali. Treating your subconscious mind like a full-time roommate is strange, but 
it works for Stephen King. To become the best game designer you can be, you must 
find the techniques that work for you, and no one can tell you what those are—you 
must discover them yourself.
Sixteen Nitty-Gritty Brainstorming Tips
Creativity is for people who don’t have a good idea in the first place.
—Anonymous
You and your silent partner are ready to tackle your problem. Now comes the fun 
part: brainstorming! That is, it’s fun when the ideas come—when they don’t, it’s 
terrifying! So, how can you make sure they do come?
Brainstorm Tip #1: The Write Answer
You’ve stated your problem. Now, start writing down solutions! Why write them 
down? Why not just sit and think until that brilliant idea comes to you? Because your 
memory is terrible! You are going to want to mix and match little pieces from doz­
ens, if not hundreds, of ideas and you will never be able to remember them all. Even 
worse, as we discussed earlier, when you have many disconnected ideas in your head, 
they can crowd out new ideas. So make room! Were you ever really mad at someone 
so you wrote them a nasty letter (which you might have never sent) and immediately 
felt better? Something magic happens when you put your ideas on paper. So do it!
Brainstorm Tip #2: Write or Type?
What is the best way to record your ideas? Whatever works best for you! Some 
people like typing best, some like writing. Cartoonist and writer Lynda Barry insists 

82
CHAPTER Seven • THE GAME BEGINS WITH AN IDEA
that there is magic in a moving pen that pulls ideas out of your mind in a way that 
a computer keyboard can never match, and I tend to agree.
I personally like writing on unlined paper, because it allows for more expres­
sion and creativity—you can circle ideas, draw little sketches, connect ideas with 
arrows, cross things out, etc. You can always type up the good stuff later.
Brainstorm Tip #3: Sketch
Not all ideas can be easily expressed through text. So draw some pictures! It doesn’t 
matter that you can’t draw—try! When you express your ideas visually, not only will 
you remember them more easily, the pictures you draw will trigger more ideas. Try 
this out. You’ll be surprised at how well it works. Need to make a game about mice? 
Start drawing some mice—real rough—just crude little mouse blobs. I guarantee you 
will find ideas popping into your head that simply weren’t there a minute ago.
Brainstorm Tip #4: Toys
Another way to get your mind visually engaged in your problem is to bring some 
toys to the table. Pick some that have something to do with your problem and some 
that have nothing to do with it! Why do you think that restaurants like TGI Friday’s 
have all that crazy stuff on the walls? Is it just decoration? No. When people see it, 
they think of things to talk about, and the more things they think of to talk about, 
the more enjoyable their restaurant experience. If it works for restaurateurs, it can 
work for you. Toys don’t just visually engage your creativity—they also engage it in 
a tactile way. Even better, why not bring a big lump of clay, or Play-Doh, so you can 
make little sculptures of your ideas? It sounds silly, but creativity is silly.
Brainstorm Tip #5: Change Your Perspective
The whole point of the lenses in this book is that they get you looking at your game 
from different perspectives. But why stop there? Don’t just brainstorm sitting in 
your chair—stand up on your chair—things look different up there! Go to different 
places—immerse yourself in different things. Brainstorm on the bus, at the beach, 
at the mall, or in a toy store, while standing on your head—anything that sparks 
your imagination and makes you think of new things is worth doing.
Brainstorm Tip #6: Immerse Yourself
You’ve stated your problem; now immerse yourself in it! Find people in your target 
audience at the mall—what are they buying? Why? Eavesdrop on them—what are 
they talking about? What is important to them? You need to know these people 

83
Sixteen Nitty-Gritty Brainstorming Tips
intimately. Have you settled on a technology already? Learn everything you can 
about it—cover your walls with its specs—find that secret thing it can do that no 
one has noticed yet. Are you locked into a theme or storyline? Find other adapta­
tions of similar stories and read or watch them. Do you need to do something new 
with an old gameplay mechanic? Play as many games that use that mechanic as you 
can find—and some that don’t!
Brainstorm Tip #7: Crack Jokes
Some people are nervous about using humor to do serious work, but when you 
are brainstorming, sometimes jokes are what get the job done. Jokes (Can you be 
a closet claustrophobic?) loosen up our minds (Is it possible to be totally partial?) 
and make us see things from a perspective that we missed before (Save the whales! 
Collect the whole set!)—and new perspectives are how great ideas happen! Be 
warned, though! Jokes can get you off track, especially in a group setting. It’s fine 
to get off track sometimes (the good ideas might not be on the track); just make it 
your responsibility to get things back on track. A brainstorming commandment to 
live by: “He who derails, rerails.”
Brainstorm Tip #8: Spare No Expense
From childhood, most of us are trained not to waste resources: “Don’t use the good 
markers!” “Don’t waste paper!” “Don’t waste money!” Brainstorming is not the time 
to be frugal. Never let materials get in the way of your creativity. You are going to 
be trying to find the million dollar ideas—you can’t let a few pennies for paper or 
ink get in the way. When brainstorming, I like to use a fancy pen and heavy gauge 
paper, and I like to write in big letters, only using one side of the paper. Why? Partly 
because I can lay out all the sheets on the table, or on the floor, and consider all the 
ideas from a distance if I need to. Partly because it gives the process a certain dig­
nity. But partly because it just feels right! And when brainstorming, you need to do 
what feels right for you—every little thing you do that makes you a little more cre­
atively comfortable increases the chances that the great idea will come. And what 
is right for one person isn’t right for everyone—you must constantly experiment to 
find what works best. But if you can’t get the materials you prefer, don’t you dare 
whine about it—use what you’ve got! There is work to be done!
Brainstorm Tip #9: The Writing on the Wall
You might prefer writing on a whiteboard to writing on paper. If so, do it! If you are 
brainstorming in a team setting, you will need some kind of solution that everyone 
can see at once. Some people like to use index cards to write down their ideas. 

84
CHAPTER Seven • THE GAME BEGINS WITH AN IDEA
These can be tacked to a bulletin board and have the advantage of being easily repo­
sitioned. The downside is that they are sometimes too small for a big idea. I find 
I prefer giant (2 ft × 2.5 ft) Post-it sheets (expensive, but we spare no expense!) or 
sheets of butcher paper with masking tape. This way, you can write lists on the wall 
but easily reposition them when you run out of room. Even better, you can take 
them down, stack them, roll them up, and store them. A year later, when someone 
says, “Hey, what were some of those robot game ideas we had last year?” you can 
go pull them out, stick them up, and restart your brainstorming session as if it had 
never stopped.
Brainstorm Tip #10: The Space Remembers
This excellent phrase is from the book The Art of Innovation by Tom Kelley. 
One more reason to put things on the wall: our memory for lists is bad, but our 
memory for where things are positioned around us is very good. By posting your 
ideas in the room all around you, you can more easily remember where they are. 
This is crucial, since you will be trying to find connections between dozens of 
different ideas and you need any help you can get—particularly if you will be 
brainstorming over several sessions. It is quite remarkable. If you put a bunch of 
ideas up on the walls and you go away for a few weeks, you will forget most of 
it. But walk back into that room where the ideas are posted, and it feels like you 
never left.
Brainstorm Tip #11: Write Everything
The best way to have a good idea is to have a lot of ideas.
—Linus Pauling
You’ve got your fancy pens, your fancy paper, your fancy coffee, some toys, 
some modeling clay, everything you think you might need to be creative. Now 
you are waiting for that brilliant idea to come. Mistake! Don’t wait—just start 
writing down everything you can think of that is remotely connected to your 
problem. Write down every stupid idea that comes into your head. And a lot of 
them will be stupid. But you have to get the stupid ones out of the way before the 
good ones start showing up. And sometimes a stupid idea becomes the inspira­
tion for a genius idea, so write it all down. Don’t censor yourself. You have to 
give up your fear of being wrong and your fear of looking silly. This is hard for 
most of us to do, but it comes with practice. And if you are brainstorming with 
other people, certainly don’t censor them—their stupid ideas are just as good as 
your stupid ideas!

85
Sixteen Nitty-Gritty Brainstorming Tips
Brainstorm Tip #12: Number Your Lists
Much of your brainstorming will consist of lists. When you make lists, number 
them! This does two things: First, it makes the lists easier to discuss (“I like ideas 
3 through 7, but 8 is my favorite!”) and, secondly, and this is extremely weird, when 
a list of things is numbered, the numbers somehow give a certain dignity to the 
things in the list. Consider these two lists:
	1.	 Chicken broth
	2.	 Umbrellas
	3.	 Wind
	4.	 Spatulas
●
●
Chicken broth
●
●
Umbrellas
●
●
Wind
●
●
Spatulas
Don’t the items in the numbered list seem more important, somehow? If one of them 
suddenly disappeared, you would be much more likely to notice. This dignity will 
make you (and others) more likely to take the ideas on the list seriously.
Brainstorm Tip #13: Destroy Your Assumptions
I learned this excellent tip from designer Rob Daviau. Make a list of everything 
about your game that you are assuming to be true, such as “I assume that it is 
designed to be played indoors,” “I assume that the player will look at the screen,” 
and “I assume the player only uses one finger to touch the screen.” This can be a 
long list, because we assume so much. Once you have a good list, go through each 
item, and think about how your game would work if that assumption wasn’t true. 
Most of the time, the assumption must stand. But once in a while, blowing up one of 
your assumptions will give you a great insight. Rob says he arrived at the design for 
Risk: Legacy when he considered destroying the standard board game assumption: 
“One game does not affect the next one.”
Brainstorm Tip #14: Mix and Match Categories
It’s great when game ideas, Athena-like, spring forth from your head, fully 
formed. But it doesn’t happen that way every time. A great technique for help­
ing ideas come together is to brainstorm in categories. The elemental tetrad 
comes in handy here. For example, you might have decided you want to make 

86
CHAPTER Seven • THE GAME BEGINS WITH AN IDEA
a game for teenage girls. You might make separate lists, which you can start to 
mix and match, something like the following:
Technology Ideas
	1.	 Smartphone game
	2.	 Virtual reality headset game
	3.	 PC
	4.	 Integrated with instant messaging
	5.	 Game console
Mechanics Ideas
	1.	 Sims-like game.
	2.	 Interactive fiction game.
	3.	 The winner makes the most friends.
	4.	 Try to spread rumors about the other players.
	5.	 Try to help as many people as possible.
	6.	 Tetris-like game.
Story Ideas
	1.	 High school drama.
	2.	 College themed.
	3.	 You play cupid.
	4.	 You’re a TV star.
	5.	 Hospital theme.
	6.	 Music theme.
	
a.	 You’re a rock star.
	
b.	 You’re a dancer.
Aesthetic Ideas
	1.	 Cel shaded.
	2.	 Anime style.
	3.	 All characters are animals.
	4.	 R&B music defines the game.
	5.	 Edgy rock/punk music defines the feel.

87
Look At All These Ideas! Now What?
Once you have lists like these (though you should have dozen more entries on 
each list!), you are free to start mixing and matching ideas—maybe a smartphone-
based Tetris-like game, which has a hospital theme, where all the characters are 
animals…. Or how about a Sims-like console game based on high school with an 
anime style? By having all these lists of partial ideas that can easily be mixed 
and matched, fully formed game ideas that you might never have thought of start 
springing up all over the place, each taking on a life of their own. Don’t be afraid to 
make up other categories, either, as you need them!
Brainstorm Tip #15: Talk to Yourself
There is tremendous social stigma against talking to yourself. But when brain­
storming alone, some people find it really helpful—there is something about saying 
things out loud that makes them more real than just thinking them in your head. 
Find a place where you can freely talk to yourself without getting funny looks. 
Another trick, if you are brainstorming in a public place, hold a cell phone next to 
your head while you talk to yourself—it’s silly, but it works.
Brainstorm Tip #16: Find a Partner
When you brainstorm with other people, it is a very different experience than brain­
storming alone. Finding the right brainstorming partner can make a world of dif­
ference—sometimes the two of you can get to great solutions many times faster 
than either of you could alone, as you bounce ideas back and forth and complete 
one another’s sentences. Just having someone to talk out loud to, even if they say 
nothing, can sometimes move the process along faster. Do keep in mind that adding 
more and more people doesn’t necessarily help, though. Usually, small groups of no 
more than four are best. Groups work best when brainstorming a narrow problem, 
not a broad, open-ended one. And, honestly, most groups go about brainstorming all 
wrong. Research shows that a group just showing up in a room trying to brainstorm 
cold on an idea is a recipe for wasted time. Much better is to have each individual 
brainstorm independently first and only then get together to share ideas, mix and 
match them, and solve problems together. Also, certain people make bad brainstorm­
ing partners—these are usually people who try to poke holes in every idea or people 
who have very narrow tastes. These people are best avoided, and you’ll be more 
productive without them. Team brainstorming can have tremendous benefits and 
tremendous perils, which we will discuss in greater detail in Chapter 25, “Team.”
Look At All These Ideas! Now What?
Our goal in this chapter was to “think of an idea.” After a little brainstorming, you 
probably have a hundred! And this is how it should be. A game designer must be 
able to come up with dozens of ideas on any topic. As you practice, you will be able 

88
CHAPTER Seven • THE GAME BEGINS WITH AN IDEA
to come up with more and better ideas in less time. But this is just the beginning 
of your design process. The next step is to narrow down this broad list of ideas and 
start doing something useful with them.

CHAPTER Eight • THE GAME IMPROVES THROUGH ITERATION
Choosing an Idea
An idea that is not dangerous is unworthy of being called an idea at all.
—Elbert Hubbard
After a painfully rapturous brainstorming session, you have a huge list of ideas in 
front of you. This is where many designers trip up. They have so many ideas they 
like, they aren’t sure what to pick. Or they have a lot of mediocre ideas, but nothing 
spectacular, so again they aren’t sure what to pick. So they float around for too long, 
in a vague haze of indecision, hoping that the “right idea” will suddenly become 
clear, if they just wait a little longer.
But something magic happens when you pick an idea and decide you are going 
to make it happen. As Steinbeck says in Of Mice and Men, “A plan is a real thing.” 
Once you make the internal decision, “Yes, I’m going to do this,” flaws you missed 
before suddenly become evident, as do benefits. It is kind of like flipping a coin to 
make a decision—when the coin comes down, you suddenly know what you really 
want. There is something inside us that makes us think about things differently 
before we’ve decided to do them than after we’ve committed. So take advantage 
of this quirk of human nature—make snap decisions about your design, commit 
to sticking with them, and immediately start thinking about the consequences of 
the choice you have just made.
But what if, with the enlightenment that suddenly comes with commitment, 
you realize you’ve made the wrong choice? The answer is easy: be ready to reverse 
your decision when you realize it is wrong. Many people find this difficult—once 
they have made a design decision, they are uncomfortable letting it go. You can’t 
afford this kind of sentimentality. Ideas are not like fine china, ideas are like 
paper cups—they are cheap to manufacture, and when one has holes in it, go get 
another one.
Some people are quite disconcerted by this combination of snap decisions 
combined with sudden reversals. But it is the most efficient way to make full 
use of your decision-making power, and game design is all about making deci­
sions—you need to make the best decisions possible, as fast as possible, and 
this slightly eccentric behavior is the way to do it. It’s always better to commit 
to an idea sooner, rather than later—you will get to a good decision much faster 
than if you bide your time considering potential alternatives. Just don’t fall in 
love with your decision and be ready to reverse it the moment it isn’t working 
for you.
So how do you pick? In one sense, the answer is, “Best guess, Mr. Sulu.” More 
analytically, there are many factors you will need to consider as you start develop­
ing a seed idea. It can pay to keep in mind what your idea must grow into before 
you even choose a seed.

91
The Eight Filters
The Eight Filters
Your finished design will eventually have to make it through eight tests, or filters. 
Only when it passes all of them is your design “good enough.” Whenever it fails one 
of these tests, you will have to change the design and then run it through all eight 
tests, or “filters,” again, because a change that makes it past one filter might make 
it fail in another one. In a sense, the design process mainly consists of stating your 
problem, getting an initial idea, and finding a way to get it past all eight filters.
The eight filters are as follows:
Filter #1: Artistic impulse: This is the most personal of the filters. You, as the 
designer, basically ask yourself whether the game “feels right” to you, and if it does, 
it passes the test. If it doesn’t, something needs to change. Your gut feelings and the 
gut feelings of your team are important. They won’t always be right, but the other 
filters will balance that out.
Key Question: “Does this game feel right?”
Filter #2: Demographics: Your game is likely to have an intended audience. 
This might be an age bracket, or a gender, or some other distinct audience (e.g., 
“golf enthusiasts”). You have to consider whether your design is right for the 
demographic you are targeting. Demographics will be discussed in more detail in 
Chapter 9, “Player.”
Key Question: “Will the intended audience like this game enough?”
Filter #3: Experience design: To apply this filter, take into account everything you 
know about creating a good experience, including aesthetics, interest curves, resonant 
theme, and game balancing. Many of the lenses in this book are about experience 
design—to pass this filter, your game must stand up to the scrutiny of many lenses.
Key Question: “Is this a well-designed game?”
Filter #4: Innovation: If you are designing a new game, by definition, there needs 
to be something new about it, something players haven’t seen before. Whether your 
game is novel enough is a subjective question, but a very important one.
Key Question: “Is this game novel enough?”
Filter #5: Business and marketing: The games business is a business, and design­
ers who want their games to sell must consider the realities of this and integrate 
them into their game’s design. This involves many questions. Are the theme and 
story going to be appealing to consumers? Is the game so easily explainable that 
one can understand what it is about just by looking at the overview? What are the 
expectations consumers are going to have about this game based on the genre? How 
do the features of this game compare to other similar games in the marketplace? 
Will the cost of producing this game be so high as to make it unprofitable? Does 
the business model for the game make sense? The answers to these and many other 

92
CHAPTER Eight • THE GAME IMPROVES THROUGH ITERATION
questions are going to have an impact on your design. Ironically, the innovative idea 
that drove the initial design may prove to be completely untenable when viewed 
through this filter. This will be discussed in detail in Chapter 31, “Profit.”
Key Question: “Will this game be profitable?”
Filter #6: Engineering: Until you have built it, a game idea is just an idea, and 
ideas are not necessarily bound by the constraints of what is possible or practical. 
To pass this filter, you have to answer the question, “How are we going to build 
this?” The answer may be that the limits of technology do not permit the idea as 
originally envisioned to be constructed. Novice designers often grow frustrated 
with the limits that engineering imposes on their designs. However, the engineer­
ing filter can just as often grow a game in new directions, because in the process 
of applying this filter, you may realize that engineering makes possible features 
for your game that did not initially occur to you. The ideas that appear during the 
application of this filter can be particularly valuable, since you can be certain that 
they are practical. More issues of engineering and technology will be discussed in 
Chapter 28, “Technology.”
Key Question: “Is it technically possible to build this game?”
Filter #7: Social/Community: Sometimes, it is not enough for a game to be fun. 
Some of the design goals may require a strong social component, a strong viral com­
ponent, or the formation of a thriving community around your game. The design 
of your game will have a strong impact on these things. This will be discussed in 
detail in Chapters 23 and 24.
Key Question: “Does this game meet our social and community goals?”
Filter #8: Playtesting: Once the game has been developed to the point that it is play­
able, you must apply the playtesting filter, which is arguably the most important of 
all the filters. It is one thing to imagine what playing a game will be like, and quite 
another to actually play it, and yet another to see it played by your target audience. 
You will want to get your game to a playable stage as soon as possible, because 
when you actually see your game in action, important changes that must be made 
will become obvious. In addition to modifying the game itself, the application of 
this filter often changes and tunes the other filters as you start to learn more about 
your game mechanics and the psychology of your intended audience. Playtesting 
will be discussed in detail in Chapter 27.
Key Question: “Do the playtesters enjoy the game enough?”
Sometimes, in the course of design, you may find a need to change one of the filters—
perhaps originally you targeted one demographic (say, males ages 18–35), but while 
designing, you stumbled into something that better fits another demographic (say, 
females over 50). Changing the filters is fine, when your design constraints will 
allow it. The important thing is that somehow, by changing the filters or by chang­
ing your design, you find a way to get through all eight.

93
The Rule of the Loop
You will be using these filters continuously throughout the rest of the design and 
development process of your game. When picking an initial idea, it makes sense 
to evaluate which of your ideas is going to have the best shot of being molded and 
shaped to the point it can survive this gauntlet. The perspective of the eight filters 
is a very useful way to evaluate your game, so let’s make it Lens #15.
The Rule of the Loop
It is somewhat daunting to consider that all of Chapter 7 and the first part of this 
one have merely been an elaboration of “(1) Think of an idea.” On the other hand, 
ideas are at the root of design, and their production is so mysterious as to be almost 
magical, so perhaps it shouldn’t surprise us that there is so much to say about this 
single step.
At this point in the process, you have thought of many ideas and chosen one, 
and now it is time to move on to the next step: “(2) Try it out.” And many design­
ers and developers do just that—leap in and try out their game. And if your game 
is simple—such as a card game, board game, or very simple computer game—and 
you have plenty of time to test it and change it, over and over, until it is great, you 
probably should do just that.
Lens #15: The Lens of the Eight Filters
To use this lens, you must consider the many constraints your design must 
satisfy. You can only call your design finished when it can pass through all 
eight filters without requiring a change.
Ask yourself the eight key questions:
●
●
Does this game feel right?
●
●
Will the intended audience like this game enough?
●
●
Is this a well-designed game?
●
●
Is this game novel enough?
●
●
Will this game sell?
●
●
Is it technically possible to build this game?
●
●
Does this game meet our social and community goals?
●
●
Do the playtesters enjoy this game enough?
In some situations, there may be still more filters; for example, an educa­
tional game will also have to answer questions like “Does this game teach 
what it is supposed to?” If your design requires more filters, don’t neglect them.

94
CHAPTER Eight • THE GAME IMPROVES THROUGH ITERATION
But what if you can’t just build a working prototype of your game in an hour 
or two? What if your game vision requires months of artwork and programming 
before you will even be able to try it out? If this is the case (as it is for many mod­
ern videogame designs), you need to proceed cautiously at this point. The process 
of game design and development is necessarily iterative, or looping. It is impos­
sible to accurately plan how many loops it is really going to take before your game 
passes all eight filters and is “good enough.” This is what makes game develop­
ment so incredibly risky—you are gambling that you will be able to get your game 
to pass all eight filters on a fixed budget, when you really don’t know if that will 
be possible.
The naïve strategy, which many still use today, is to start slapping the game 
together and hope for the best. Sometimes this works. But when it doesn’t, you are 
in a horrible mess. You either have to ship a game that you know isn’t good enough 
or suffer the expense of continuing development until it is. And often, this extra 
time and expense is enough to make the project completely unprofitable.
In truth, this is a problem for all software projects. Software projects are so com­
plex that it is very difficult to predict how long they will take to build and how long 
it will take to find and fix all of the bugs that will surely appear during develop­
ment. On top of all that, games have the added burden of needing to be fun—game 
developers have a couple of extra filters that nongame software developers don’t 
need to worry about.
The real problem here is the rule of the loop.
The Rule of the Loop: The more times you test and improve your design, the 
better your game will be.
The Rule of the Loop is not a lens, because it is not a perspective—it is an abso­
lute truth. There are no exceptions to the Rule of the Loop. You will try, at times in 
your career, to rationalize it away, to convince yourself that “this time, the design 
is so good, we don’t have to test and improve,” or “we really have no choice—we’ll 
have to hope for the best,” and you will suffer for it each time. The horrible thing 
about computer games is that the amount of time and money it takes to test and 
adjust the system is so much greater than for traditional games. It means computer 
game developers have no choice but to loop fewer times, which is a terribly risky 
thing to do.
If you are indeed embarking on the design of a game that is likely to involve long 
“test and improve” loops, you need to answer these two questions:
●
●
Loop question 1: How can I make every loop count?
●
●
Loop question 2: How can I loop as fast as possible?
The software engineering people have thought about this problem a lot over the 
last forty years, and they have come up with some useful techniques.

A Short History of Software Engineering
A Short History of Software Engineering
Danger—Waterfall—Keep Back
In the 1960s, when software development was still relatively new, there was very 
little in the way of formal process. Programmers just made their best guesses about 
how long things would take, and they would start coding. Often the guesses were 
wrong, and many software projects went disastrously over budget. In the 1970s, in 
an attempt to bring some order to this unpredictable process, many developers (usu­
ally at the behest of nontechnical management) tried to adopt the “waterfall model” 
of software development, which was an orderly seven-step process for software 
development. It was generally presented looking something like this:
And it certainly looks appealing! Seven orderly steps, and when each is com­
plete, nothing remains but to move on to the next one—the very name “waterfall” 
implies that no iteration is needed, since waterfalls generally do not flow uphill.
The waterfall model had one good quality: it encouraged developers to spend more 
time in planning and design before just jumping into the code. Except for that, it is 
complete nonsense, because it violates the Rule of the Loop. Managers found it incred­
ibly appealing, but programmers knew it to be absurd—software is simply too complex 
for such a linear process to ever work. Even Winston Royce, who wrote the paper that

was the foundation for all of this, disagreed with the waterfall model as it is commonly 
understood. Interestingly, his original paper emphasizes the importance of iteration 
and the ability to go back to previous steps as needed. He never even used the word 
“waterfall”! But what was taught at universities and corporations everywhere was 
this linear approach. The whole thing seems to have been wishful thinking, mostly 
promulgated by people who did not actually have to build real systems themselves.
Barry Boehm Loves You
Then, in 1986, Barry Boehm (pronounced “beam”) presented a different model, 
which was based more closely on how real software development actually hap­
pens. It is usually presented as a somewhat intimidating diagram, where develop­
ment starts in the middle and spirals out clockwise, passing through four quadrants 
again and again (Figure 8.3).

The spiral model of software development.

THE AGILE MANIFESTO
His model has a lot of complex detail, but we don’t need to go into all of 
that. There are basically three great ideas wrapped up in here: risk assessment, 
prototypes, and looping. In brief, the spiral model suggests that you do the 
following:
	1.	 Come up with a basic design.
	2.	 Figure out the greatest risks in your design.
	3.	 Build prototypes that mitigate those risks.
	4.	 Test the prototypes.
	5.	 Come up with a more detailed design based on what you have learned.
	6.	 Return to step 2.
And basically, you repeat this loop until the system is done. This beats the water­
fall model hands down, because it is all about the Rule of the Loop. Also, it answers 
the questions we stated earlier:
●
●
Loop question 1: How can I make every loop count?
Spiral model answer: Assess your risks and mitigate them.
●
●
Loop question 2: How can I loop as fast as possible?
Spiral model answer: Build many rough prototypes.
There have been many descendants of the spiral model, but by far the most suc­
cessful has been the spread of agile development.
The Agile Manifesto
The event that most shaped modern game design and development occurred in 2001 
at a ski resort in Snowbird, Utah, when a group of software engineers put together 
the Agile Manifesto. Continuing in the vein of Barry Boehm, they attempted to put 
forth the values and principles that were behind the creation of excellent software. 
The manifesto and its 12 key principles are reprinted in full here:
Individuals and interactions over processes and tools
Working software over comprehensive documentation
Customer collaboration over contract negotiation
Responding to change over following a plan
That is, while there is value in the items on
the right, we value the items on the left more.

98
CHAPTER Eight • THE GAME IMPROVES THROUGH ITERATION
We follow these principles:
	 1.	 Our highest priority is to satisfy the customer through early and continuous 
delivery of valuable software.
	 2.	 Welcome changing requirements, even late in development. Agile processes 
harness change for the customer’s competitive advantage.
	 3.	 Deliver working software frequently, from a couple of weeks to a couple of 
months, with a preference to the shorter timescale.
	 4.	 Business people and developers must work together daily throughout the 
project.
	 5.	 Build projects around motivated individuals. Give them the environment and 
support they need, and trust them to get the job done.
	 6.	 The most efficient and effective method of conveying information to and within 
a development team is face-to-face conversation.
	 7.	 Working software is the primary measure of progress.
	 8.	 Agile processes promote sustainable development. The sponsors, developers, 
and users should be able to maintain a constant pace indefinitely.
	 9.	 Continuous attention to technical excellence and good design enhances agility.
	10.	 Simplicity—the art of maximizing the amount of work not done—is essential.
	11.	 The best architectures, requirements, and designs emerge from self-organizing 
teams.
	12.	At regular intervals, the team reflects on how to become more effective, then 
tunes and adjusts its behavior accordingly.
These principles have been translated into concrete practices that take many 
forms and names but are most often referred to as “scrum.” Agile and scrum made 
a huge impact on the software world and a bigger impact on videogame developers, 
who have been especially passionate about embracing these principles. My observa­
tions are that at this point in time, over 80% of videogame developers claim to be 
using some version of agile development. Looking at the nature of agile develop­
ment, it’s not hard to see why.
A full description of agile methods and processes is beyond the scope of this 
book, but here are the core elements used by most developers:
Flexible goals: Central to the agile philosophy is the notion that we can’t know 
precisely what we are going to have time to create. By planning around a more 
flexible set of goals, and not merely tolerating changes to the plan, but planning for 
changes to the plan, the team can adapt to new ideas and information throughout 
the course of development.
Prioritized backlog: Instead of working toward a rigid set of features, agile teams 
instead work with a backlog, which is a list of features sorted by priority. Anytime 

99
Risk Assessment and Prototyping
someone has a new idea for a feature, it can be added to the backlog. In each sprint, 
the team revisits the backlog and reprioritizes the features—important ones get a high 
ranking, less important ones get a low ranking. This makes it easy to decide what to 
work on next—just look at the top of the backlog. It is important to realize that there 
is no guarantee that everything on the backlog will get done—there is only guarantee 
that the most important things will get done with whatever time is available.
Sprints: Instead of focusing primarily on working toward a long-term (multi­
month) goal, agile developers work in a series of “sprints,” where each sprint is a 
few weeks long and has a concrete working deliverable at the end of it. Atari founder 
Nolan Bushnell once said, “The ultimate inspiration is the deadline,” and it is true—
deadlines have a special way of making things happen, and that is precisely the 
philosophy behind sprinting: more deadlines means more things get done.
Scrum meetings: Instead of weekly “status meetings,” agile developers have 
daily “scrum” meetings, designed for brevity and effectiveness. These meetings 
are typically 10–15 minutes long and are often held standing up, to underline their 
brief nature. During these meetings, each member explains exactly three things 
and nothing more: what they accomplished yesterday, what they plan to accomplish 
today, and what problems they are facing. Solutions to these problems are discussed 
one-on-one by the appropriate team members after the meeting is over. In this sys­
tem, each team member stays aware of what the others are doing and gives them a 
chance to get help from team members.
Demo day: At the end of each sprint, everyone gets together, face to face, to see 
and experiment with what was produced. Working from this new baseline, the 
team does risk analysis and works together to plan the next sprint.
Retrospectives: Also at the end of each sprint, the team has a “retrospective” 
meeting, which is not about the product they are working on, but rather about the 
process they are using. This is a chance for the team to discuss what they are doing 
right, what they are doing wrong, and how they should adjust their process for the 
next sprint.
It is important to keep in mind that agile is a philosophy, not a prescribed meth­
odology, and that there is some significant variety in the way different developers 
carry it out. While these approaches have their differences, they are all designed 
to create as many loops as possible and to make each loop count. Necessarily, all 
feature risk assessment and prototyping at their core.
Risk Assessment and Prototyping
Example: Prisoners of Bubbleville
Let’s say you and your team have decided you want to make a videogame all about 
parachuting into a city. You have a brief design description that you based on the 
elemental tetrad:

100
CHAPTER Eight • THE GAME IMPROVES THROUGH ITERATION
Prisoners of Bubbleville: Design Brief
Story: You are “Smiley,” a parachuting cat. The good people of Bubbleville are 
trapped in their houses by an evil wizard. You must find a way to defeat the wiz­
ard, by repeatedly parachuting into the city and sliding down chimneys to visit the 
citizens and get clues about how to stop the wizard.
Mechanics: As you parachute toward the city, you are trying to grab magic bub­
bles that rise up from the city and use their energy to shoot rays at evil vultures that 
try to pop the bubbles and rip your parachute. Simultaneously, you must navigate 
down to one of several target buildings in the city.
Aesthetics: A cartoony look and feel.
Technology: Multiple platform 3D console game using a third-party engine.
One approach you could take would be to just start building the game. Start writ­
ing code, designing detailed levels, and animating the characters, while you wait for 
it all to come together, to see what it will really be like. But this could be incredibly 
dangerous. Assuming this is an eighteen-month project, it might take as long as 
six months before you even have anything you can playtest. What if you learned, at 
that point, that your game idea wasn’t fun? Or your game engine wasn’t up to the 
job? You would be in real trouble. You would be one-third of the way through the 
project and would only have completed a single loop!
Instead, the right thing is to sit down with your team and do a risk analysis. This 
means making a list of all the things that might jeopardize the project. A sample list 
for this game might be the following:
Prisoners of Bubbleville: Risk List
Risk #1: The bubble collecting/vulture shooting mechanic might not be as fun 
as we think.
Risk #2: The game engine might not be able to handle drawing an entire city and 
all those bubbles and vultures at once.
Risk #3: Our current thinking is that we need thirty different houses to make a 
full game—creating all the different interiors and animated characters might take 
more time than we have.
Risk #4: We aren’t sure people will like our characters and story.
Risk #5: There is a chance the publisher might insist we theme this game to a 
new summer movie about stunt parachuting.
In reality, you will probably have many more risks, but for the sake of our example, 
we’ll just consider these. So what do you do about these risks? You could just cross 
your fingers and hope these things don’t happen, or you could do the smart thing: 
risk mitigation. The idea is to reduce or eliminate the risks as soon as possible, often 
by building small prototypes. Let’s look at how each of these risks could be mitigated:
Prisoners of Bubbleville: Risk Mitigation
Risk #1: The bubble collecting/vulture shooting mechanic might not be as fun 
as we think.
Game mechanics can often be abstracted and played in a simpler form. Have a 
programmer make a very abstract version of this gameplay mechanic, perhaps in 

101
Risk Assessment and Prototyping
2D, with simple geometric shapes instead of animated characters. You can prob­
ably have a working game in a week or two and start answering questions about 
whether it is fun right away. If it isn’t, you can make quick modifications to the 
simple prototype, until it is fun, and then begin work on the elaborate 3D version. 
You’ll be doing more loops sooner, wisely taking advantage of the Rule of the Loop. 
You might object to this approach, thinking that throwing out the 2D prototyping 
code, which the players will never see, is wasteful. In the long run, though, you 
would have saved time, because you will be coding the right game sooner and not 
endlessly coding and recoding the wrong game.
Risk #2: The game engine might not be able to handle drawing an entire city and 
all those bubbles and vultures at once.
If you wait for all the final artwork to answer this question, you could put your­
self in a horrible situation: if the game engine can’t handle it, you now have to 
ask the artists to redo their work so it is less strain on the game engine or ask 
the programmers to spend extra time trying to find tricks to render everything 
more efficiently (or most likely, both of these things). To mitigate the risk, build a 
quick prototype, right away, that does nothing but show the approximate number 
of equivalent items on screen, to see if the engine can handle it. This prototype has 
no gameplay; it is purely to test technical limits. If it can handle it, great! If it can’t, 
you can figure out a solution now, before any art has been generated. Again, this 
prototype will be a throwaway.
Risk #3: Our current thinking is that we need 30 different houses to make a full 
game—creating all the different interiors and animated characters might take more 
time than we have.
If you get halfway into development before you realize that you don’t have the 
resources to build all the artwork, you are doomed. Have an artist create one house 
and one animated character immediately to see how long it takes, and if it takes 
longer than you can afford, change your design immediately—maybe you could 
have fewer houses, or maybe you could reuse some the interiors and characters.
Risk #4: We aren’t sure people will like our characters and story.
If you really are concerned about this, you cannot wait until the characters and 
story are in the game to find out. What kind of prototype do we build here? An art 
prototype—it might not even be on a computer—just a bulletin board. Have your 
artists draw some concept art or produce test renders of your characters and set­
tings. Create some storyboards that show how the story progresses. Once you have 
these, start showing them to people (hopefully people in your target demographic) 
and gauge their reactions. Figure out what they like, don’t like, and why. Maybe 
they like the look of the main character but hate his attitude. Maybe the villain is 
exciting, but the story is boring. You can figure most of this out completely inde­
pendent of the game. Each time you do this and make a change, you’ve completed 
another loop and gotten one step closer to making a good game.
Risk #5: There is a chance we might have to theme this game to a new summer 
movie about stunt parachuting.

102
CHAPTER Eight • THE GAME IMPROVES THROUGH ITERATION
This risk might sound absurd, but this kind of thing happens all the time. When it 
happens in the middle of a project, it can be horrible. And you can’t ignore this kind 
of thing—you must seriously consider every risk that might threaten your project. 
Will a prototype help in this case? Probably not. To mitigate this risk, you can lean 
on management to get a decision as fast as possible, or you could decide to make 
a game that could more easily be rethemed to the movie. You might even come up 
with a plan for making two different games—the key idea is that you consider the 
risk immediately and take action now to make sure it doesn’t endanger your game.
Risk assessment and mitigation are such useful perspectives to take; it becomes 
Lens #16.
Ten Tips for Productive Prototyping
It is widely understood that rapid prototyping is crucial for quality game develop­
ment. Here are some tips that will help you build the best, most useful prototypes 
for your game.
Prototyping Tip #1: Answer a Question
Every prototype should be designed to answer a question and sometimes more than 
one. You should be able to state the questions clearly. If you can’t, your prototype is 
Lens #16: The Lens of Risk Mitigation
Because the sage always confronts difficulties, he never experiences them.
—Tao Te Ching
To use this lens, stop thinking positively, and start seriously considering the 
things that could go horribly wrong with your game.
Ask yourself these questions:
●
●
What could keep this game from being great?
●
●
How can we stop that from happening?
Risk management is hard. It means you have to face up to the problems 
you would most like to avoid and solve them immediately. But if you discipline 
yourself to do it, you’ll loop more times, and more usefully, and get a better 
game as a result. It is tempting to ignore potential problems and just work on 
the parts of your game you feel most confident about. You must resist this 
temptation and focus on the parts of your game that are in danger.

103
Ten Tips for Productive Prototyping
in real danger of becoming a time-wasting boondoggle, instead of the time-saving 
experiment it is supposed to be. Here are some sample questions a prototype might 
answer:
●
●
How many animated characters can our technology support in a scene?
●
●
Is our core gameplay fun? Does it stay fun for a long time?
●
●
Do our characters and settings fit together well aesthetically?
●
●
How large does a level of this game need to be?
Resist the temptation to overbuild your prototype, and focus only on making it 
answer the key question.
Prototyping Tip #2: Forget Quality
Game developers of every stripe have one thing in common: they are proud of 
their craft. Naturally, then, many find the idea of doing a “quick and dirty” pro­
totype completely abhorrent. Artists will spend too much time on early concept 
sketches—programmers will spend too much time on good software engineering 
for a piece of throwaway code. When working on a prototype, all that matters is 
whether it answers the question. The faster it can do that, the better—even if it just 
barely works and looks rough around the edges. In fact, polishing your prototype 
may even make things worse. Playtesters (and colleagues) are more likely to point 
out problems with something that looks rough than with something that looks pol­
ished. Since your goal is to find problems immediately so you can solve them early, 
a polished prototype can actually defeat your purpose by hiding real problems, thus 
lulling you into a false sense of security.
There is no getting around the Rule of the Loop. The faster you build the proto­
type that answers your question, the better, despite how ugly it may look.
Prototyping Tip #3: Don’t Get Attached
In The Mythical Man Month, Fred Brooks made the famous statement: “Plan to 
throw one away—you will anyway.” By this he means that whether you like it or 
not, the first version of your system is not going to be a finished product, but really 
a prototype that you will need to discard before you build the system the “right” 
way. But in truth, you may throw away many prototypes. Less experienced devel­
opers often have a hard time doing this—it makes them feel like they have failed. 
You need to enter the prototyping work with the mind-set that it is all temporary—
all that matters is answering the question. Look at each prototype as a learning 
opportunity—as practice for when you build the “real” system. Of course, you won’t 
throw out everything—you’ll keep little pieces here and there that really work and 

104
CHAPTER Eight • THE GAME IMPROVES THROUGH ITERATION
you’ll combine them to make something greater. This can be painful. As designer 
Nicole Epps once put it, “You must learn how to cut up your babies.”
Prototyping Tip #4: Prioritize Your Prototypes
When you make your list of risks, you might realize that you need several pro­
totypes to mitigate all the risks that you face. The right thing to do is to priori­
tize them like the agile developers do, so that you face the biggest risks first. You 
should also consider dependence—if the results of one prototype have the potential 
to make the other prototypes meaningless, the “upstream” prototype is definitely 
your highest priority.
Prototyping Tip #5: Parallelize Prototypes Productively
One great way to get more loops in is to do more than one at a time. While the system 
engineers work on prototypes to answer technology questions, the artists can work 
on art prototypes, and the game scripters can work on gameplay prototypes. Having 
lots of small, independent prototypes can help you answer more questions faster.
Prototyping Tip #6: It Doesn’t Have to Be Digital
Your goal is to loop as usefully and as frequently as possible. So if you can manage 
it, why not just get the software out of the way? If you are clever, you can prototype 
your fancy videogame idea as a simple board game, or what we sometimes call a 
paper prototype. Why do this? Because you can make board games fast and often 
capture the same gameplay. This lets you spot problems sooner—much of the pro­
cess of prototyping is about looking for problems and figuring out how to fix them, 
so paper prototyping can be a real time saver. If your game is turn based to start 
with, this becomes easy. The turn-based combat system for Toontown Online was 
prototyped through a simple board game, which let us carefully balance the many 
types of attacks and combos. We would keep track of hit points on paper or on a 
whiteboard and play again and again, adding and subtracting rules until the game 
seemed balanced enough to try coding up.
Even real-time games can be played as paper prototypes. Sometimes they can be 
converted to a turn-based mode that still manages to capture the gameplay. Other 
times, you can just play them in real time or nearly. The best way to do it is to have 
other people help you. We’ll consider two examples.
Tetris: A Paper Prototype
Let’s say you wanted to make a paper prototype of Tetris. You could cut out little card­
board pieces and put them in a pile. Get someone else to choose them at random 

105
Ten Tips for Productive Prototyping
and start sliding them down the “board” (a sketch you’ve drawn on a piece of 
paper), while you grab them, and try to rotate them into place. To complete a line, 
you have to just use your imagination or pause the game while you cut the pieces 
with an X-Acto knife. This would not be the perfect Tetris experience, but it might 
be close enough for you to start to see if you had the right kinds of shapes and also 
enough to give you some sense of how fast the pieces should drop. And you could 
get the whole thing going in about fifteen minutes.
Halo: A Paper Prototype
Would it be possible to make a paper prototype of a first-person shooter? Sure! You 
need different people to play the different AI characters as well as different play­
ers. Draw out the map on a big piece of graph paper, and get little game pieces to 
represent the different players and enemies. You need one person to control each 
of the players and one for each of the enemies. You could then either make some 
turn-based rules about how to move and shoot or get yourself a metronome! It is 
easy to find free metronome apps. Configure your metronome to tick once every 
five seconds, and make a rule that you can move one square of graph paper with 
every tick. When there is a line of sight, you can take a shot at another player or 
monster, but only one shot per tick. This will give the feeling of playing the whole 
thing in slow motion, but that can be a good thing, because it gives you time to 
think about what is working and not working while you are playing the game. You 
can get a great sense of how big your map should be, the shapes of hallways and 
rooms that make for an interesting game, the properties your weapons should have, 
and many other things—and you can do it all lightning fast!
Prototyping Tip #7: It Doesn’t Have to Be Interactive
All your prototypes need not be digital; they don’t even need to be interactive. Simple 
sketches and animations can go a long way toward answering questions about game­
play. Prince of Persia: Sands of Time, with its novel jumping and time-reversal mechan­
ics, was originally prototyped purely with noninteractive animations of the incredible 
acrobatics the designers imagined, so the team could more easily look at, think about, 
and discuss how to create interactive systems that would achieve this vision.
Prototyping Tip #8: Pick a “Fast Loop” Game Engine
The traditional method of software development is kind of like baking bread:
	1.	 Write code.
	2.	 Compile and link.
	3.	 Run your game.

106
CHAPTER Eight • THE GAME IMPROVES THROUGH ITERATION
	4.	 Navigate through your game to the part you want to test.
	5.	 Test it out.
	6.	 Go back to step 1.
If you don’t like the bread (your test results), there is no choice but to start the whole 
process over again. It takes way too long, especially for a large game. By choosing 
an engine with the right kind of scripting system, you can make changes to your 
code while the game is running. This makes things more like working with clay—
you can change them continuously:
	1.	 Run your game.
	2.	 Navigate through your game to the part you want to test.
	3.	 Test it out.
	4.	 Write code.
	5.	 Go back to step 3.
By recoding your system while it is running, you can get in more loops per day, and 
the quality of your game goes up commensurately. I have used Scheme, Smalltalk, 
and Python for this in the past, but any late-binding language will do the job. 
Unity makes it possible with javascript or C#. If you are afraid that these kinds of 
languages run too slowly, remember that it is okay to write your games with more 
than one kind of code: write the low-level stuff that doesn’t need to change much 
in something fast but static (Assembly, C++, etc.), and write the high-level stuff in 
something slower but dynamic. This may take some technical work to pull off, but 
it is worth it because it lets you take advantage of the Rule of the Loop.
Prototyping Tip #9: Build the Toy First
Back in Chapter 4, we distinguished between toys and games. Toys are fun to play 
with for their own sake. In contrast, games have goals and are a much richer expe­
rience based around problem solving. We should never forget, though, that many 
games are built on top of toys. A ball is a toy, but baseball is a game. A little ava­
tar that runs and jumps is a toy, but Donkey Kong is a game. You should make 
sure that your toy is fun to play with before you design a game around it. You might 
find that once you actually build your toy, you are surprised by what makes it fun, 
and whole new ideas for games might become apparent to you.
Game designer David Jones says that when designing the game Lemmings, his 
team followed exactly this method. They thought it would be fun to make a lit­
tle world with lots of little creatures walking around doing different things. They 
weren’t sure what the game would be, but the world sounded fun, so they built it. 
Once they could actually play with the “toy,” they started talking seriously about 

107
Ten Tips for Productive Prototyping
what kinds of games could be built around it. Jones tells a similar story about the 
development of Grand Theft Auto: “Grand Theft Auto was not designed as Grand 
Theft Auto. It was designed as a medium. It was designed to be a living, breathing 
city that was fun to play.” Once the “medium” was developed and the team could 
see that it was a fun toy, they had to decide what game to build with it. They real­
ized the city was like a maze, so they borrowed maze game mechanics from some­
thing they knew was good. Jones explains: “GTA came from Pac-Man. The dots are 
the little people. There’s me in my little, yellow car. And the ghosts are policemen.”
By building the toy first and then coming up with the game, you can radically 
increase the quality of your game, because it will be fun on two levels. Further, if 
the gameplay you create is based on the parts of the toy that are the most fun, the 
two levels will be supporting each other in the strongest way possible. Game design­
ers often forget to consider the toy perspective. To help us remember, we’ll make it 
Lens #17.
Prototyping Tip #10: Seize Opportunities for More Loops
As things change in the course of game development, sometimes more time 
becomes available. Some of the greatest successes in the game industry have come 
from unexpected events allowing for more loops. Halo, for instance, was originally 
in development as a Macintosh game. When a deal with Microsoft meant a change 
to PC, the team used it as an opportunity to throw out things that weren’t working 
Lens #17: The Lens of the Toy
To use this lens, stop thinking about whether your game is fun to play, and 
start thinking about whether it is fun to play with.
Ask yourself these questions:
●
●
If my game had no goal, would it be fun at all? If not, how can I change 
that?
●
●
When people see my game, do they want to start interacting with it, even 
before they know what to do? If not, how can I change that?
There are two ways to use the Lens of the Toy. One way is to use it on an exist­
ing game, to figure out how to add more toylike qualities to it—that is, how to 
make it more approachable and more fun to manipulate. But the second way, 
the braver way, is to use it to invent and create new toys before you even have 
any idea what games will be played with them. This is risky if you are on a 
schedule—but if you are not, it can be a great “divining rod” to help you find 
wonderful games you might not have discovered otherwise.

108
CHAPTER Eight • THE GAME IMPROVES THROUGH ITERATION
and to iterate further on what they knew was good. A second windfall came when 
Microsoft asked them to change from PC to the newly announced Xbox! The extra 
time necessary to make technical changes also afforded time to iterate and improve 
gameplay. Because the designers took savvy advantage of those unplanned loops, 
the quality of the game went through the roof.
Closing the Loop
Once you have built your prototypes, all that remains is to test them, and then 
based on what you have learned, start the whole process over again. Recall the 
informal process we discussed earlier:
The Informal Loop
	1.	 Think of an idea.
	2.	 Try it out.
	3.	 Keep changing it and testing it until it seems good enough.
We have now made the preceding loop a bit more formal:
The Formal Loop
	1.	 State the problem.
	2.	 Brainstorm some possible solutions.
	3.	 Choose a solution.
	4.	 List the risks of using that solution.
	5.	 Build prototypes to mitigate the risks.
	6.	 Test the prototypes. If they are good enough, stop.
	7.	 State the new problems you are trying to solve, and go to step 2.
With each round of prototyping, you will find yourself stating the problems in 
more detail. To give an example, let’s say you are given the task of creating a racing 
game—but there has to be something new and interesting about it. Here is a sum­
mary of how a few loops of that process might play out.
Loop 1: “New Racing” Game

❍This might not feel innovative enough.

❍Artists working on concept sketches of underwater racetracks

❍Designers prototyping (using paper prototypes and by hacking an existing 
racecar game) novel effects (subs that can also rise out of water and fly, 
tracking missiles, depth charges, racing through a minefield)
❍
❍Programmers testing out simple water effects
●
●
Results
❍
❍Underwater racetracks look okay if there is a “glowing path” in the water. 
Underwater tunnels will be cool! So will flying submarines following tracks 
that go in and out of the water!
❍
❍Early prototypes seem fun, provided the submarines are very fast and 
maneuverable. It will be necessary to make them “racing subs.” The mix of 
flying and swimming feels very novel. Subs should go faster when flying, so 
we will need to find a way to limit the amount of time they can spend in the 
air. The little playtesting we have done makes it clear this game must sup­
port networked multiplay.
❍
❍Some water effects are easier than others. Splashes look good, so do under­
water bubbles. Making the whole screen waver takes too much CPU and is 
kind of distracting anyway.

❍
❍If the racing subs look “too cartoony,” they might turn off older play­
ers. If they look too realistic, they might just seem silly with this kind of 
gameplay.

CHAPTER Eight • THE GAME IMPROVES THROUGH ITERATION
❍
❍Until we know how much time we are spending in and out of the water, it is 
impossible to design levels or to do the artwork for the landscapes.
❍
❍The team has never done networked multiplay for a racing game. We aren’t 
completely sure we can do it.
●
●
Prototypes
❍
❍Artists will sketch different kinds of subs, in a number of different styles: car­
toony, realistic, hyperrealistic subs that are living creatures. The team will vote 
on them, and we will also informally survey members of our target audience.
❍
❍Programmers and designers will work together on a very crude prototype 
that lets them experiment with how much time should be spent in and out of 
the water and different mechanics for managing that.
❍
❍Programmers will build a rough framework for networked multiplay that 
should handle all the kinds of messages this kind of game will need.
●
●
Results
❍
❍Everyone loves the “dino-sub” designs. There is strong agreement between 
team members and potential audience members that “swimming dinosaurs” 
are the right look and feel for this game.
❍
❍After several experiments, it becomes clear that for most levels, 60% of 
time should be spent underwater, 20% in the air, and 20% near the surface, 
where players who grab the right power-ups can fly above the water for a 
speed advantage.
❍
❍The early networked experiments show that mostly the racing is not a prob­
lem for multiplay, but if we can avoid using rapid-fire machine guns, multi­
play will be a lot easier.

Detailed problem statements
❍
❍We need to figure out if we can schedule all the animation time needed for 
the dinosaurs.

❍We need to develop the “right” number of levels for this game.

❍We need to figure out all the power-ups that will go into this game.
❍
❍We need to determine all the weapons that this game should support (and 
avoid rapid-fire machine guns because of networking constraints).
Notice how the problem statements gradually evolved and got more specific with 
each loop. Also notice how ugly problems bubbled to the surface quickly: What if 

111
How Much Is Enough?
the team hadn’t tried out all the different character designs so early? What if three 
levels of the game had already been designed and modeled before anyone noticed 
the problem of keeping players in the air for the right amount of time? What if the 
machine gun system had already been coded up and the whole gameplay mechanic 
centered around it, before anyone realized it would break the networking code? 
These problems got addressed quickly because of so many early loops. It looks like 
just two complete loops and the beginning of a third one, but because of the wise 
use of parallelism, there were really six design loops.
Also notice how the whole team was involved in important design decisions. 
There is no way that a lone designer could have done this—much of the design was 
informed by the technology and the aesthetics.
How Much Is Enough?
…and now I saw, though too late, the folly of beginning a work before we count 
the cost, and before we judge rightly of our own strength to go through with it.
—Robinson Crusoe
You might wonder how many loops are needed before the game is done. This is a 
very hard question to answer, and it is what makes game development so difficult 
to schedule. The Rule of the Loop implies that one more loop will always make 
your game a little better. So as the saying goes, “the work is never finished—only 
abandoned.” The important thing is to make sure you get enough loops in to 
produce a game you are proud of before you’ve used up the entire development 
budget.
So when you stand there at the beginning of the first loop, is it possible to make 
an accurate estimate of when you will have a finished, high-quality game? No. 
It is simply not possible. Experienced designers, after a time, get better at guessing, 
but the large number of game titles that ship later than originally promised, or with 
lower quality than originally promised, is testament to the fact that there is just no 
way to know. Why is this? Because at the beginning of the first loop, you don’t yet 
know what you are going to build! With each loop, though, you get a more solid 
idea of what the game will really be, and this allows for more accurate estimates.
Game designer Mark Cerny has described a system for game design and develop­
ment that he calls “The Method.” Not surprisingly, this features a system of iteration 
and risk mitigation. But The Method makes an interesting distinction between what 
Cerny calls “preproduction” and “production” (terms borrowed from Hollywood). 
He argues that you are in preproduction until you have finished two publishable 
levels of your game, complete with all necessary features. In other words, until 
you have two completely finished levels, you are still figuring out the fundamental 
design of your game. Once you reach this magic point, you are now in produc­
tion. This means that you know enough about what your game really is that you 
can safely schedule the rest of development. Cerny states that usually this point is 

112
CHAPTER Eight • THE GAME IMPROVES THROUGH ITERATION
generally reached when 30% of the necessary budget has been spent. So if it costs 
you $1 million to get to this point, it will probably cost you another $2.3 million 
to actually complete the game. This is a great rule of thumb, and realistically, this 
might be the most accurate way to really plan the release date for a game. The prob­
lem with it is that you won’t really know what the game will cost or when it will be 
complete until you have already spent 30% of what it will take to get there. In truth, 
this problem is unavoidable—The Method just guides you toward reaching a point 
of predictability as soon as is realistically possible.
Over the years, I have developed my own rules of thumb for getting games done 
on time and under budget, which I call the 50% rules.
50% rule the first: When planning your game, make sure that you build it in 
such a way that if 50% of your budget were removed, you could still have a ship­
pable game. This rule will force you to keep your systems simple and will help 
guarantee that when things go wrong (and they will go wrong) and you have to cut 
some features, you will still be guaranteed a shippable game.
50% rule the second: All core gameplay elements should be fully playable at 
the halfway mark in your schedule. If this is true, it means you’ll spend about half 
the time getting the game working and half the time making it great. All too often, 
developers plan to spend 80% of the time getting it working and 20% of the time 
making it great. And of course, things go wrong, and that 20% gets eaten up, and 
in the end, you have a game that is late and weak. If you plan to have all systems 
playable at the 50% mark, even when things go wrong, you will have time for the 
important loops that make your game great.
Your Secret Fuel
Much of this chapter has been very analytical, and that’s as it should be, since 
thoughtful analysis will do a great deal to help ensure that your game design and 
development are optimized. But with all that analysis, it can be easy to forget why 
you pursued this idea in the first place.
Lens #18: The Lens of Passion
At the end of each prototype, when you are carefully mitigating risks and 
planning what to do next, don’t forget to check how you feel about your game 
with these important questions:
●
●
Am I filled with blinding passion about how great this game will be?
●
●
If I’ve lost the passion, can I find it again?
●
●
If the passion isn’t coming back, shouldn’t I be doing something else?

who we are making them for.

is the way your subconscious tells you that it is excited about your game. If 
the passion has gone away, something has gone wrong—if you can’t figure out 
what it is, it is very likely your game will be dead on arrival. Passion has its 
dangers—it is an irrational emotion, after all, but you must take it seriously, 
for more often than not, passion is what knocks down obstacles and carries a 
game to success.

CHAPTER Nine • THE GAME IS MADE FOR A PLAYER
Einstein’s Violin
At one point in his career, Albert Einstein was asked by a small local organization 
to be the guest of honor at a luncheon and to give a lecture about his research. He 
agreed to do so. The luncheon was quite pleasant, and when the time came, the 
host anxiously announced that Albert Einstein, the famous scientist, was there to 
talk about his theories of special and general relativity. Einstein took the stage, 
and looking out a largely nonacademic audience consisting of mostly old ladies, he 
explained to them that he certainly could talk about his work, but it was a bit dull, 
and he was thinking perhaps instead the audience would prefer to hear him play the 
violin. The host and audience both agreed that it sounded like a fine idea. Einstein 
proceeded to play several pieces he knew well, creating a delightful experience the 
entire audience was able to enjoy and surely one they remembered for the rest of 
their lives.
Einstein was able to create such a memorable experience because he knew his 
audience. As much as he loved thinking and talking about physics, he knew that it 
wasn’t something that his audience would be really interested in. Sure, they asked 
him to talk about physics, because they thought it would be the best way to get what 
they really wanted—an intimate encounter with the famous Albert Einstein.
To create a great experience, you must do the same as Einstein. You must know 
what your audience will and will not like, and you must know it even better than 
they do. You would think that finding out what people want would be easy, but it 
isn’t, because in many cases, they don’t really know. They might think they know, 
but often there is a big difference between what they think they want and what it 
is they will actually enjoy.
As with everything else in game design, the key here is a kind of listening. 
You must learn to listen to your players, thoroughly and deeply. You must become 
intimate with their thoughts, their emotions, their fears, and their desires. Some of 
these will be so secret that your players themselves are not even consciously aware 
of them—and as we discussed in Chapter 6, “Theme,” it is often these that are the 
most important.

Demographics
Project Yourself
So how can you do this kind of deep listening? One of the best ways is to use your 
power of empathy (discussed further in Chapter 10, “Player’s Mind”) to put yourself 
into their place. In 1954, when Disneyland Park was being constructed, Walt Disney 
would frequently walk around the park inspecting the progress. Often, he would 
be seen to walk for a distance, stop, and suddenly crouch to the ground, peering 
at something in the distance. Then he would get up, walk a few steps, and crouch 
again. After seeing him do this repeatedly, some of his designers asked what he was 
doing—was there something wrong with his back? His explanation was simple: 
How else could he know what Disneyland would look like to children?
In retrospect, this seems obvious—things look different at different eye heights, 
and the perspective of children at Disneyland is just as important as, if not more 
than, the perspective of adults. And physical perspective is not enough—you must 
adopt their mental perspective as well, actively projecting yourself into the mind 
of your player. You must actively try to become them, trying to see what they see, 
hear what they hear, and think what they think. It is very easy to get stuck in the 
high and mighty mind of the designer and forget to project yourself into the mind of 
the player—it is something that requires constant attention and vigilance, but you 
can do it if you try.
If you are creating a game for a target audience that you used to be part of 
(e.g., a woman creating a game for teen girls), you have an advantage—you can get in 
touch with your memories about how you thought, what you liked, and how things 
felt when you were that age. People are surprisingly good at forgetting what things 
were really like when they were younger. As a designer, you can’t afford to forget. 
Work hard to bring back your old memories, and make them vivid and strong again. 
Keep these old memories well oiled—they are some of your most valuable tools.
But what if you are making something for an audience that you have never been 
a part of, and perhaps never will be (e.g., a young man creating a game for middle-
aged women)? Then you must use a different tactic—you must think hard about 
people you have known who are in the target demographic and imagine what it is 
like to be them. Like a cultural anthropologist, you should spend time with your 
target audience, talking with them, observing them, and imagining what it is like to 
be them. Everyone has some innate power to do this—but if you practice it, you will 
improve. If you can mentally become any type of player, you can greatly expand the 
audience for your games, because your designs will be able to include people that 
other designers have ignored.
Demographics
Age doesn’t make us childish, as they say. It only finds us real children still.

CHAPTER Nine • THE GAME IS MADE FOR A PLAYER
We know that all individuals are each unique, but when creating something meant 
to be enjoyed by vast numbers of people, we have to consider ways that groups of 
people are the same. We call these groups demographics, or sometimes market seg­
ments. There is no “official” means of establishing these groups—different profes­
sions have different reasons for grouping them differently. For game designers, the 
two most significant demographic variables are age and gender. We all play differ­
ently as we get older, and males and females play differently than one another at 
all ages. What follows is an analysis of some of the typical age demographics that a 
game designer has to consider.
●
●
0–3, infant/toddler: Children in this age bracket are very interested in toys, but 
the complexity and problem solving involved in games is generally too much for 
them. Abstract interfaces (like a gamepad) are generally beyond them, but direct 
interfaces (like a touch screen), they find fascinating.
●
●
4–6, preschooler: This is the age where children generally show their first inter­
est in games. The games are very simple and played with parents more often 
F I G U R E
9.3

119
Demographics
than with one another, because the parents know how to bend the rules to keep 
the games enjoyable and interesting.
●
●
7–9, kids: The age of seven has long been called the “age of reason.” At this age, 
children have entered school, are generally able to read, are able to think things 
through, and solve hard problems. Naturally, they become very interested in 
gameplaying. This is also the age where children start making their own deci­
sions about what kinds of toys and games they like and dislike, no longer just 
accepting whatever their parents choose for them.
●
●
10–13, preteen or “tween”: It is only recently that marketers have started to 
recognize this group as distinct from both “kids” and “teens.” Children this age 
are going through a period of tremendous neurological growth and are suddenly 
able to think about things more deeply and with more nuance than they were 
a few years back. This age is sometimes called the “age of obsession,” because 
children this age start to get quite passionate about their interests. For boys espe­
cially, these interests are often games.
●
●
13–18, teen: The job of a teenager is to start getting ready for adulthood. At this 
age, we generally see a significant divergence between male and female inter­
ests. Boys continue to be interested (and often get more interested) in competi­
tion and mastery, whereas girls become more focused on real-world issues and 
communication. This makes boy and girl game interests very different at this 
age. Teens of both genders are very interested in experimenting with new kinds 
of experiences, though, and some of those can happen through gameplay.
●
●
18–24, young adult: This is the first “adult” age grouping and the mark of an 
important transition. Adults, in general, play less than children do. Most adults 
do continue to play, but at this point, with their teenage experiments out of the 
way, they have established certain tastes about the kind of play and entertain­
ment they enjoy. Young adults usually have both time and money on their hands, 
which makes them big consumers of games.
●
●
25–35, twenties and thirties: At this age, time starts to become more precious. 
This is the age of “peak family formation.” As the responsibilities of adulthood 
start to add up, most adults in this age bracket are only casual gameplayers, play­
ing games as an occasional amusement or playing games with their young chil­
dren. On the other hand, “hardcore gamers” in this age bracket—that is, people 
for whom playing games is their primary hobby—are an important target market 
because they purchase a lot of games and are often quite vocal about what they do 
and don’t like, potentially influencing the buying decisions of their social network.
●
●
35–50, thirties and forties: Sometimes referred to as the “family maturation” 
stage, most adults in this bracket are very caught up in career and family respon­
sibilities and are only casual gameplayers. As their children become older, adults 
in this age group are often the ones who make decisions about expensive game 
purchases, and when possible, they look for gameplaying opportunities the 
whole family can enjoy together.

120
CHAPTER Nine • THE GAME IS MADE FOR A PLAYER
●
●
50+, fifties and up: Often called the “empty nesters,” adults in this age bracket 
suddenly have a lot of time on their hands—their children have moved out, and 
they will soon be facing retirement. Some return to games they enjoyed when 
they were younger, and others, looking for a change, turn to new game experi­
ences. Adults in this age group are particularly interested in game experiences 
that have a strong social component, such as golf, tennis, bridge, and online 
multiplayer games. Facebook games, in particular, have been very successful 
with this age group. Their eyes and hands aren’t what they used to be, and so 
games that involve tiny screens or complex fine motor control can be frustrating 
to them.
There are other ways to break up groups by age, but these nine groups are how 
the game industry usually does it, because they reflect changes in play pat­
terns. It is interesting to consider the transitional experiences that separate each 
group from the next. Most of the younger groups are separated by periods of 
mental development, while the older groups are primarily separated by family 
transitions.
Something important to remember when creating games for any age group: all 
play activities are connected to childhood, since childhood is centered around play. 
Therefore, to create games for someone of a particular age, you must be in tune 
with the games and themes that were popular when they were children. To put it 
another way: to truly communicate with someone, you must speak the language of 
their childhood.

PETER PAN: We have fun, don’t we? I taught you to fly and to fight! What more 
could there be?
WENDY: There is so much more.
PETER PAN: What? What else is there?
WENDY: I don’t know. I guess it becomes clearer as you grow up.
Males and females are different. They have different interests, different tastes, and 
different skills and abilities. Which of these are innate and which are learned are 
often difficult to say—and to a designer, it doesn’t much matter—what matters is 
acknowledging and designing for these differences.
These differences show up in sharp relief when one examines videogame sales. 
The majority of console videogames, for example, are played by boys and men. 
Some have suggested that this is largely because of the male-oriented aesthetics of 
these games, which often feature aggressive male characters, graphic violence, and 
hypersexualized female characters. But experiments to change these aesthetics, 
while maintaining the same core gameplay mechanics, have largely failed. It would 
seem some deeper quality of games is the driving factor.

121
The Medium Is the Misogynist?
Raph Koster, in his book A Theory of Fun, suggests that the core of playing and 
winning games is mastering abstract formal systems, which is something generally 
enjoyed more by boys and men than it is by girls and women. If this is the case (and 
it does seem to be true), then games at their core are an inherently more male than 
female activity.
So how can we explain the fact that some games are very popular with girls and 
women, such as social games on Facebook, which are largely dominated by female 
players? The answer is that just because games contain abstract formal systems at 
their core, it does not mean that finding and mastering these systems is the only 
experience that games can create. Instead, this core can support a wide variety of 
experiences that appeal to both genders, such as story, creativity, learning, and 
socialization. In this way, games are like apples: you can still enjoy the fruit even if 
you don’t like the core.
Entire books have been written about the differences between how males and 
females play, and there is great debate about which kinds of play are really “more 
male” or “more female.” There is certainly no definitive master list of what each 
gender prefers. The important thing is that you realize that there are some impor­
tant differences and that you carefully consider whether your game has the right 
features to delight the audience you are designing for. What follows is a short list 
of a few of the strongest differences between how males and females like to play. 
These are generalizations, certainly not true for every individual, but when making 
games for large audiences, generalizations are useful.
Five Things Males Like to See in Games
If you are a woman and you don’t understand men, chances are you are think­
ing too hard.
—Louis Ramey
	1.	 Mastery: Males enjoy mastering things. It doesn’t have to be something impor­
tant or useful—it only has to be challenging. Females tend to be more interested 
in mastery when it has a meaningful purpose.
	2.	 Competition: Males really enjoy competing against others to prove that they 
are the best. For females, the bad feelings that can come from losing the game 
(or causing another player to lose) often outweigh the positive feelings that come 
from winning.
	3.	 Destruction: Males like destroying things. A lot. Often, when young boys play 
with blocks, the most exciting part for them is not the building, but knocking 
down the tower once it is built. Videogames are a natural fit for this kind of 
gameplay, allowing for virtual destruction of a magnitude far greater than would 
be possible in the real world.

122
CHAPTER Nine • THE GAME IS MADE FOR A PLAYER
	4.	 Spatial puzzles: Studies have shown that males generally have stronger skills of 
spatial reasoning than females, and most people would agree that this matches 
anecdotal evidence. Accordingly, puzzles that involve navigating 3D spaces are 
often quite intriguing to males, while they can sometimes prove frustrating for 
females.
	5.	 Trial and error: Women often joke that men hate reading directions, and there 
is some truth to that. Males tend to have a preference for learning things through 
trial and error. In a sense, this makes it easier to design interfaces for them, since 
they actually sometimes prefer an interface that requires some experimentation 
to understand, which ties into the pleasure of mastery.
Five Things Females Like to See in Games
Females want experiences where they can make emotional and social discover­
ies that they can apply to their own lives.
—Heidi Dangelmeier
	1.	 Emotion: Females like experiences that explore the richness of human emo­
tion. For males, emotion is an interesting component of an experience but sel­
dom an end in itself. A somewhat crass but telling example of this contrast can 
be found at the ends of the “romantic relationship media” spectrum. At one 
end are romance novels (one-third of all fiction books sold are romance novels), 
which focus primarily on the emotional aspects of romantic relationships and 
are purchased almost exclusively by women. At the other end of the spectrum is 
pornography, which focuses primarily on the physical aspects of romantic rela­
tionships and is purchased almost exclusively by men.
	2.	 Real world: Females tend to prefer entertainment that connects meaningfully 
to the real world. If you watch young girls and young boys play, girls will more 
frequently play games that are strongly connected to the real world (playing 
“house,” pretending to be a veterinarian, playing dress-up, etc.), whereas boys 
will more frequently take on the role of fantasy characters. One of the all-time 
best-selling computer game titles for girls was Barbie Fashion Designer, which 
lets girls design, print, and sew custom clothes for their real-world Barbie dolls. 
Compare this to Barbie as Rapunzel, an adventure game in a fantasy setting. 
Although it featured the same character (Barbie), it did not have a real-world 
component and was not nearly as popular.
	 	 This trend continues through adulthood—when things are connected to the real 
world in a meaningful way, women become more interested. Sometimes this is 
through the content (the Sims games, e.g., have more female players than male, 

123
The Medium Is the Misogynist?
and their content is a simulation of the day-to-day life of ordinary people), and 
sometimes it is through the social aspects of the games. The massive influx of 
female players to online social games seems to have less to do with the games 
and much more to do with the centrality of the friends’ list as a game feature. 
Playing with virtual players is “just pretend,” but playing with real players can 
build real relationships.
	3.	 Nurturing: Females enjoy nurturing. Girls enjoy taking care of baby dolls, toy 
pets, and children younger than themselves. It is not uncommon to see girls sac­
rifice a winning position in a competitive game to help a weaker player, partly 
because the relationships and feelings of the players are more important than the 
game, but partly out of the joy of nurturing. The success of farming games and 
pet games with girls and women is due in large part to their nurturing mechan­
ics. In the development of Toontown Online, a “healing” game mechanic was 
required for the combat system. We observed that healing other players was very 
appealing to girls and women we discussed the game with, and it was important 
to us that this game works equally well for males and females, so we made a 
bold decision. In most role-playing games, players mostly heal themselves but 
have the option of healing others. In Toontown, you cannot heal yourself—only 
others. This increases the value of a player with healing skill and encourages 
nurturing play. A player who wants to can make healing their primary activity 
in Toontown.
	4.	 Dialog and verbal puzzles: It is often said that what females lack in spatial 
skills they make up for in increased verbal skills. Women purchase many more 
books than men do, and the audience for crossword puzzles is mostly female. 
The popular mobile game Words with Friends has a majority (63% as of 2013) of 
female players.
	5.	 Learning by example: Just as males tend to eschew instructions, favoring 
a trial-and-error approach, females tend to prefer learning by example. They 
have a strong appreciation for clear tutorials that lead you carefully, step-by-
step, so that when it is time to attempt a task, the player knows what she is 
supposed to do.
There are many other differences, of course. For example, males tend to be very 
focused on one task at a time, whereas females can more easily work on many 
parallel tasks, and not forget about any of them. Games that make use of this mul­
titasking skill (e.g., the Sims or Farmville) can sometimes have a stronger female 
appeal. “Hidden Picture” games have become a very popular genre with women, 
leading some to speculate that it engages primal gathering behaviors, which some 
believe to be more powerful in the female brain than in the male. Whether that is 
the true reason women like hidden picture games is controversial, but the success 
of the games with the female demographic is not.

124
CHAPTER Nine • THE GAME IS MADE FOR A PLAYER
You must look closely at your game to determine its strengths and weaknesses 
on a gender basis. Sometimes this leads to fascinating discoveries. The designers 
of Hasbro’s Pox, a wireless electronic handheld game, knew that their game was 
going to be an inherently social experience, and so they reasoned that it should 
have features that girls would like as well as boys. As they observed children play­
ing in playgrounds, however, they noticed something very interesting: girls almost 
never play games spontaneously in large groups. There is no female equivalent 
of a pickup game of touch football. On the surface, this is strange—girls tend to 
be more social, so you might expect that games involving large gatherings would 
appeal to them more. The problem seems to lie in conflict resolution. When a 
group of boys play a game and there is a dispute, play stops, there is a (sometimes 
heated) discussion, and the dispute is resolved. At times, this involves one boy 
going home in tears, but despite that, play continues. When a group of girls play a 
game and there is a dispute, it is a different story. Most of the girls will take sides 
on the dispute, and it generally cannot be resolved right away. Play stops, and 
often cannot continue. Girls will play team sports when they are formally orga­
nized, but two informal competing teams put too much stress on their personal 
relationships to be worth the trouble. The Hasbro designers realized that though 
their game concept was social, it was also inherently competitive, and ultimately 
they decided to design it for boys only.
The introduction of digital technology has done a great deal to make clear gender 
differences in gameplay. In the past, most games were very social, played in the real 
world, with real people. The introduction of affordable computers gave us a type of 
game that
●
●
Had all social aspects removed
●
●
Had most verbal and emotional aspects removed
●
●
Was largely divorced from the real world
●
●
Was generally hard to learn
●
●
And offered the possibility for unlimited virtual destruction
It is hardly surprising that early computer and videogames were primarily popu­
lar with a male audience. As digital technology has evolved to the point that 
videogames can now support emotional character portrayals, richer stories, and 
the opportunity to play with real friends at convenient times, the female audi­
ence for videogames has been commensurately growing. It will be interesting to 
see which upcoming technological and design advances attract even more female 
gamers.
Whether you consider age, gender, or other factors, the important thing is that 
you put yourself in the perspective of the player, so you can carefully consider 
what will make the game the most fun for them. This important perspective is

The Medium Is the Misogynist?
When developing Pirates of the Caribbean: Battle for the Buccaneer Gold for 
DisneyQuest, we had to consider a wide range of demographics. Many arcades and 
interactive location-based entertainment centers have a somewhat narrow demo­
graphic: teenage boys. DisneyQuest’s goal was to support the same demographic 
as the Disney theme parks: pretty much everybody, particularly families. Further, 
DisneyQuest’s goal is to get the whole family playing games together. With such a 
broad range of skill levels and interests within any given family, this was quite a 
challenge. But by carefully considering the interests of each potential player, we 
found a way to make it work. Roughly, we broke it down this way:
Boys: We had little worry that boys would enjoy playing this game. It is an excit­
ing “adventure and battle fantasy” where players can pilot a pirate ship and man 
powerful cannons. Early tests showed that boys enjoyed it a great deal and tended 
to play offensively—trying to seek out and destroy every pirate ship they could find. 
They engaged in some communication but always stayed very focused on the task 
of destroying the enemy as skillfully as possible.
Girls: We were not so confident that girls would like this game, since they don’t 
usually have the same zeal for “blowing up bad guys.” To our surprise, girls seemed 
to like the game a great deal, but they played it in a different way. Girls generally 
tended to play more defensively—they were more concerned about protecting their 
ship from invaders than chasing down other ships. When we became aware of 
Lens #19: The Lens of the Player
To use this lens, stop thinking about your game, and start thinking about your 
player.
Ask yourself these questions about the people who will play your game:
●
●
In general, what do they like?
●
●
What don’t they like? Why?
●
●
What do they expect to see in a game?
●
●
If I were in their place, what would I want to see in a game?
●
●
What would they like or dislike about my game in particular?
A good game designer should always be thinking of the player and should be 
an advocate for the player. Skilled designers hold The Lens of the Player and 
Lens #10, Holographic Design, in the same hand, thinking about the player, the 
experience of the game, and the mechanics of the game all at the same time. 
Thinking about the player is useful, but even more useful is watching them 
play your game. The more you observe them playing, the more easily you’ll be 
able to predict what they are going to enjoy.

CHAPTER Nine • THE GAME IS MADE FOR A PLAYER
this, we made sure to create a balance of invading ships and enemies that could be 
chased to support offensive as well as defensive play. The girls seemed very excited 
about the treasures you could gather, so we made sure to pile them up conspicu­
ously on the deck and make them visually interesting. Further, we designed the 
final battle so that flying skeletons would charge the ship and snatch the treasures 
off of the deck. This made the skeleton shooting task much more important and 
rewarding to the girls. The girls also seemed to enjoy the social aspects of the game 
more than the boys did—they would constantly shout warnings and suggestions to 
each other, occasionally having face-to-face “huddles” where they would divide up 
responsibilities.
Men: We sometimes joked that men were just “tall boys with credit cards.” They 
seemed to like the game in the same ways the boys did, although they tended to 
play the game in a slightly more reserved way—often carefully puzzling out the 
optimal way to play the game.
Women: We had very little confidence that women, mothers in particular, would 
find much to enjoy with this game. Mothers tend to have a different theme park 
experience than the rest of the family, because their main concern is not how much 
fun they personally have but how much fun the rest of the family has. In early tests 
of pirates, we noticed that women, and mothers in particular, tended to gravitate 
toward the back of the ship, while the rest of the family moved toward the front. 
This usually meant that the family members manned the cannons and that mom 
steered the ship, since the ship’s wheel was in the back. At first, this seemed a 
recipe for disaster—mom doesn’t have much videogame experience, and a poorly 
steered ship has the potential to ruin the experience for everyone.
But this isn’t what happened at all. Since mom wants to see everyone have a 
good time, she suddenly has a vested interest in steering the ship as well as pos­
sible. Being at the helm, which has the best view, she has a chance to keep an eye 
on everyone, to steer the ship to interesting places, and to slow things down if her 
family is overwhelmed. Further, she is in a good position to manage her crew, warn­
ing them of oncoming dangers and giving orders (“Dylan! Give your sister a turn on 
that side!”) designed to make sure everyone has fun. This was a great way to make 
mom really care about how the game turned out.
Accepting the fact that women would be steering the ship more often than boys, 
girls, or men meant that we had to be sure that steering the ship was easy for some­
one who was not a frequent videogame player, but this was a small price to pay to 
include a key part of our audience. Frequently, we would hear kids comment when 
coming off the ride: “Wow, Mom, you were really good at that!”
By paying close attention to the desires and behaviors of our various target demo­
graphics, we were able to balance the game to suit all of them. In the beginning, we 
just had ideas about where there might be problems making the game appeal to all 
four of these groups—it was only through attentive prototyping and playtesting that 
we started to realize the possible solutions to these problems. We watched closely 
to see how each demographic group tried to play our game, and then we changed it 
to support each group’s style of play.

127
Psychographics
Psychographics
Of course, age and gender aren’t the only ways to group potential players. There are 
many other factors you can use. Demographics generally refer to external factors 
(age, gender, income, ethnicity, etc.), and those can sometimes be a useful way to 
group your audience. But really, when we group people by these external factors, we 
are trying to get at something internal: what each group finds pleasurable. A more 
direct approach is to focus less on how players appear on the outside and more on 
how they think on the inside. This is called psychographics.
Some psychographic breakdowns have to do with “lifestyle” choices, such as 
“dog lover,” “baseball fan,” or “hardcore FPS player.” These are easy to understand, 
since they are tied to concrete activities. If you are creating a game about dogs, 
baseball, or shooting people in tunnels, you will naturally want to pay close atten­
tion to the preferences of each of these lifestyle groups.
But other kinds of psychographics aren’t so tied to concrete activities. They have 
more to do with what a person enjoys the most—the kind of pleasures they look 
for when participating in a game activity or, really, any activity. This is important, 
for ultimately, the motivation for every human action can be traced back to some 
kind of pleasure seeking. It is a tricky business, though, for there are many kinds of 
pleasures in the world and no one seeks only one kind. But it is certainly true that 
people have their pleasure preferences. Game designer Marc LeBlanc has proposed 
a list of eight pleasures that he considers the primary “game pleasures.”
LeBlanc’s Taxonomy of Game Pleasures
	1.	 Sensation: Pleasures of sensation involve using your senses. Seeing something 
beautiful, hearing music, touching silk, and smelling or tasting delicious food 
are all pleasures of sensation. It is primarily the aesthetics of your game that will 
deliver these pleasures. Greg Costikyan tells a story about sensation:
As an example of the difference that mere sensation can make, consider the 
board game Axis & Allies. I first bought it when it was published by Nova 
Games, an obscure publisher of hobby games. It had an extremely garish board, 
and ugly cardboard counters to represent the military units. I played it once, 
thought it was pretty dumb, and put it away. Some years later, it was bought 
and republished by Milton Bradley, with an elegant new board, and with hun­
dreds of plastic pieces in the shapes of aircraft, ships, tanks, and infantrymen— 
I’ve played it many times since. It’s the sheer tactile joy of pushing around little 
military figures on the board that makes the game fun to play.
	 	 Sensory pleasure is often the pleasure of the toy (see Lens #17). This pleasure 
cannot make a bad game into a good one, but it can often make a good game into 
a better one.

128
CHAPTER Nine • THE GAME IS MADE FOR A PLAYER
	2.	 Fantasy: This is the pleasure of the imaginary world and the pleasure of imagin­
ing yourself as something that you are not. We will discuss this pleasure further 
in Chapters 19 and 20.
	3.	 Narrative: By the pleasure of narrative, LeBlanc does not necessarily mean the 
telling of a prescribed, linear story. He means instead a dramatic unfolding of 
a sequence of events, however it happens. We’ll be talking more about this in 
Chapters 16 and 17.
	4.	 Challenge: In some sense, challenge can be considered one of the core pleasures 
of gameplay, since every game, at its heart, has a problem to be solved. For some 
players, this pleasure is enough—but others need more.
	5.	 Fellowship: Here, LeBlanc is referring to everything enjoyable about friendship, 
cooperation, and community. Without a doubt, for some players, this is the 
main attraction of playing games. We will discuss this further in Chapters 23 
and 24.
	6.	 Discovery: The pleasure of discovery is a broad one: any time you seek and find 
something new, that is a discovery. Sometimes this is the exploration of your 
game world, and sometimes it is the discovery of a secret feature or clever strat­
egy. Without a doubt, discovering new things is a key game pleasure.
	7.	 Expression: This is the pleasure of expressing yourself and the pleasure of creat­
ing things. In the past, this is a pleasure that was generally neglected in game 
design. Today, games allow players to design their own characters and build and 
share their own levels. Often, the “expression” that takes place in a game does 
little to achieve the goals of the game. Designing new outfits for your character 
doesn’t help you advance in most games—but for some players, it may be the 
very reason they play.
	8.	 Submission: This is the pleasure of entering the magic circle—of leaving the 
real world behind and entering into a new, more enjoyable, set of rules and 
meaning. In a sense, all games involve the pleasure of submission, but some 
game worlds are simply more pleasing and interesting to enter than others. 
In some games, you are forced to suspend your disbelief—in others, the game 
itself seems to suspend your disbelief effortlessly, and your mind easily enters 
and stays in the game world. It is these games that make submission truly a 
pleasure.
It is useful to examine these different pleasures, because different individuals place 
different values on each one. Game designer Richard Bartle, who has spent many 
years designing MUDs and other online games, observes that players fall into four 
main groups in terms of their game pleasure preferences. Bartle’s four types are 
easy to remember, because they have the suits of playing cards as a convenient 
mnemonic. It is left as an exercise to the reader to understand why each card suit 
was chosen to represent each category.

129
Psychographics
Bartle’s Taxonomy of Player Types
	1.	 ♦ Achievers want to achieve the goals of the game. Their primary pleasure is 
challenge.
	2.	 ♠ Explorers want to get to know the breadth of the game. Their primary pleasure 
is discovery.
	3.	 ♥ Socializers are interested in relationships with other people. They primarily 
seek the pleasures of fellowship.
	4.	 ♣ Killers are interested in competing with and defeating others. This category 
does not map well to LeBlanc’s taxonomy. For the most part, it seems killers enjoy 
a mix of the pleasures of competition and destruction. Interestingly, Bartle char­
acterizes them as primarily interested in “imposing themselves on others” and 
includes in this category people who are primarily interested in helping others.
Bartle also proposes a fascinating graph (Figure 9.4) that shows how the four types 
neatly cover a sort of space: that is, achievers are interested in acting on the world, 
explorers are interested in interacting with the world, socializers are interested in 
interacting with players, and killers are interested in acting on players.
More Pleasure: MORE!
We must use caution when trying to make such simple taxonomies to describe 
something as complex as human desire. Under close scrutiny, both LeBlanc’s and 
Bartle’s taxonomies (and other similar lists) have gaps and when misused can gloss 
over subtle pleasures that might easily be missed, such as “destruction” and “nur­
turing,” which we encountered in our discussion of gender. The following is a list 
of a few more pleasures to be considered:

CHAPTER Nine • THE GAME IS MADE FOR A PLAYER
●
●
Anticipation: When you know a pleasure is coming, just waiting for it is a kind 
of pleasure.
●
●
Completion: It feels good to finish something. Many games take advantage of 
the pleasure of completion—any game where you have to “eat all the dots,” 
“destroy all the bad guys,” or otherwise “clear the level” is taking advantage of 
this pleasure.
●
●
Delight in another’s misfortune: Typically, we feel this when some unjust per­
son suddenly gets their comeuppance. It is an important aspect of competitive 
games. The Germans call it schadenfreude (pronounced shoddenfroyduh).
●
●
Gift giving: There is a unique pleasure when you make someone else happy 
through the surprise of a gift. We wrap our presents to heighten and intensify 
this surprise. The pleasure is not just that the person is happy but that you made 
them happy.
●
●
Humor: Two unconnected things are suddenly united by a paradigm shift. It is 
hard to describe, but we all know it when it happens. Weirdly, it causes us to 
make a barking noise.
●
●
Possibility: This is the pleasure of having many choices and knowing you could 
pick any one of them. This is often experienced when shopping or at a buffet 
table.
●
●
Pride in an accomplishment: This is a pleasure all its own that can persist 
long after the accomplishment was made. The Yiddish word naches (pronounced 
“nock-hess”) is about this kind of pleased satisfaction, usually referring to pride 
in children or grandchildren.
●
●
Surprise: As Lens #4, Surprise, shows us, the brain likes surprises.
●
●
Thrill: There is a saying among roller coaster designers that “fear minus death 
equals fun.” Thrill is that kind of fun—you experience terror but feel secure in 
your safety.
●
●
Triumph over adversity: This is that pleasure that you have accomplished some­
thing that you knew was a long shot. Typically, this pleasure is accompanied 
by shouts of personal triumph. The Italians have a word for this pleasure: fiero 
(pronounced fee-air-o).
●
●
Wonder: An overwhelming feeling of awe and amazement.
And there are many, many more. I list these pleasures that fall outside of easy 
classification to illustrate the richness of the pleasure space. Lists of pleasures can 
serve as convenient rules of thumb, but don’t forget to keep an open mind for ones 
that might not be on your list. Also keep in mind that pleasure is very context sen­
sitive. What might be very pleasurable in one context (dancing at a party) might 
be torturously embarrassing in another context (dancing at a job interview). The 
crucial perspective of pleasure gives us Lens #20.

Knowing your players intimately, more intimately than they know themselves, 
is the key to giving them a game they will enjoy. In Chapter 10, we will get to know 
them even better.

Lens #20: The Lens of Pleasure
To use this lens, think about the kinds of pleasure your game does and does 
not provide.
Ask yourself these questions:
●
●
What pleasures does your game give to players? Can these be improved?
●
●
What pleasures are missing from your experience? Why? Can they be 
added?
Ultimately, the job of a game is to give pleasure. By going through lists of 
known pleasures and considering how well your game delivers each one, you 
may be inspired to make changes to your game that will increase your play­
ers’ enjoyment. Always be on the lookout, though, for unique, unclassified 
pleasures not found in most games—for one of these might be what gives your 
game the unique quality it needs.

the Player’s Mind

CHAPTER Ten • THE EXPERIENCE IS IN THE PLAYER’S MIND
We have already discussed that ultimately, experiences are what a game designer 
creates. These experiences can only happen in one place—the human brain. 
Entertaining the human brain is hard because it is so complex—it is the most com­
plex object in the known universe.
Even worse, most of its workings are hidden from us.
Until you got to this sentence, were you at all conscious of the position of your 
feet, the rate of your breathing, or how your eyes were moving across the page? Do 
you even know how your eyes move across the page? Do they move smoothly and 
linearly, or do they take little hops? How could you have read books for so many 
years without being sure of the answer to that question? When you speak, do you 
really know what you are going to say before you say it? Incredibly, when you drive 
a car, somehow you observe the curvature of the roadway and translate that into a 
rotational angle by which you move the steering wheel. Who does that calculation? 
Can you even remember paying attention to the curvature of the roadway? And how 
does it happen that just because this sentence contains the words “imagine eating 
a hamburger with pickles,” your mouth is watering right now?
Consider this pattern:
Somehow, you know what comes next. How did you reach that conclusion? Was 
it through a process of deductive logic, or did you just “see” the answer? If you just 
saw it, what did you see? And who drew the picture that you saw?
Here’s one more. Try this experiment: find a friend, and ask them to do these 
three things:
	1.	 Say the word “boast” five times. “Boast, boast, boast, boast, boast.”
	2.	 Spell the word “boast” out loud. “B-O-A-S-T.”
	3.	 Answer this question: “What do you put in a toaster?”
Your friend will likely give the answer “toast.” Generally, toast is what you take 
out of a toaster, not what you put in. If you omit the first two steps, most people will 
give a more correct answer, like “bread.” Priming the brain’s networks with “boast” 
is enough to make the word “toast” seem like a better candidate than the correct 
answer, “bread.” We normally think of answering a question like “What do you put 
in a toaster?” as a very conscious event, but the truth is that the subconscious exerts 
terrific control over almost everything we say and do. Mostly it does that wisely and 
well, and we feel like “we” are doing it—but from time to time, it makes a laughable 
mistake and reveals how much control it truly has.

Modeling
The majority of what is going on in our brains is hidden from the conscious mind. 
Psychologists are gradually making progress toward understanding these subcon­
scious processes, but generally, we are in the dark as to how they really work. The 
workings of our mind are mostly outside our understanding and mostly outside 
our control. But the mind is the place that game experiences happen, so we must 
do what we can to get a working knowledge of what seems to be going on in there. 
In Chapter 7, “Idea,” we talked about using the power of the creative subconscious 
to be a better designer. Now we must consider the interaction of the conscious and 
subconscious in the mind of the player. Everything that is known about the human 
mind would fill many encyclopedias—we will contain our examination of the mind 
to some of the key factors that relate to game design.
There are four principal mental abilities that make gameplay possible. These are 
modeling, focus, imagination, and empathy. We will consider each in turn and then 
examine the secret priorities of every player’s subconscious mind.
Modeling
Reality is amazingly complex. The only way our minds are able to get by at all is 
by simplifying reality so that we can make some sense of it. Correspondingly, our 
minds do not deal with reality itself, but instead with models of reality. Mostly we 
do not notice this—the modeling takes place below our awareness. Consciousness 
is an illusion that our internal experiences are reality, when in truth they are imper­
fect simulations of something we may never truly understand. The illusion is a very 
good one, but at times we run into places where our internal simulations fail. Some 
of these are visual, like this picture:
In reality, those dots are not changing color as our eyes move around, but our 
brain sure does make it look like they are.
Some examples don’t become clear until you think about them a little bit, such 
as the visible light spectrum. From a physics point of view, visible light, infrared, 
ultraviolet, and microwaves are all the same kind of electromagnetic radiation, just 
at different wavelengths. Our eyes can only see a tiny fraction of this smooth spec­
trum, and we call this fraction visible light. It would be very useful if we could 
see other kinds of light. Seeing infrared light, for example, would let us easily spot 
predators in the dark, since all living things emit infrared light. Unfortunately, the 
F I G U R E
10.3

136
CHAPTER Ten • THE EXPERIENCE IS IN THE PLAYER’S MIND
insides of our eyeballs emit infrared as well, so if we could see it, we would be 
quickly blinded by our own glow. As a result, a huge amount of useful data, that is, 
everything outside the visible light range of the electromagnetic spectrum, is not 
part of our perceived reality.
Even the visible light we can see is strangely filtered by our eyes and brains. 
Because of the construction of our eye, this spread of visible light wavelengths looks 
like it falls into distinct groupings, which we call colors. When we look at a rainbow 
that comes out of a prism, we can draw lines to separate one color from another. In 
truth, though, this is just an artifact of the mechanics of the retina. In reality, there 
is no sharp separation of colors, just a smooth gradient of wavelengths, even though 
our eyes tell us that blue and light blue are much more similar than, say, light blue 
and green. We evolved this eye structure because breaking up the wavelengths into 
groups like this is a useful way to better understand the world. “Colors” are only an 
illusion, not part of reality at all, but a very useful model of reality.
Reality is full of aspects that aren’t at all part of our day-to-day modeling. For 
example, our bodies, our homes, and our food are teeming with microscopic bacte­
ria and mites. Many are single celled, but others, such as the demodex folliculorum 
that lives in our eyelashes, pores, and hair follicles, are almost large enough (up to 
0.4 mm) to be seen with the naked eye. These tiny creatures are everywhere around 
us, but are generally not part of our mental models at all, because mostly, we don’t 
need or want to know about them.
One good way to get a grasp on some of our mental models is to look for things 
that feel natural to us until we think about them. Consider this picture of Charlie 
Brown. At first glance, nothing seems too unusual about him—he’s just a boy. But 
upon reflection, he looks nothing like a real person. His head is nearly as big as his 
body! His fingers are little bumps! Most distressing of all, he is made of lines. Look 
around you—nothing is made of lines—everything is made of lumps. His unreality 
doesn’t become apparent until we stop and consciously think about it, and this is a 
clue to how the brain models things.

Modeling
Charlie Brown seems like a person even though he doesn’t look like anyone we 
know because he matches some of our internal models. We accept his giant head 
because our minds store much more information about heads and faces than the 
rest of the body, since so much information about a person’s feelings comes from 
their face. If instead he had a small head and giant feet, he would immediately look 
ridiculous, because he wouldn’t match our internal models at all.
And what about his lines? It is a challenging problem for the brain to look at a 
scene and pick out which objects are separate from each other. When it does, below 
our conscious level, our internal visual processing system draws lines around each 
separate object. Our conscious mind never sees these lines, but it does get a feeling 
about which things in a scene are separate objects. When we are presented with a 
picture already drawn with lines, it has been “predigested” in a sense, matching our 
internal modeling mechanisms perfectly and saving them a lot of work. This is part 
of why people find cartoons and comics so soothing to look at—our brain needs to 
do less work to understand them.
Stage magicians amaze us by taking advantage of our mental models and then 
breaking them. In our mind, our models are reality, so we feel like we are seeing 
someone do the impossible. The audible gasp that comes from an audience at the 
culmination of a magic trick is the sound of their mental models being torn asunder. 
It is only through our faith that “it must be a trick” that we are able to reason that 
magicians don’t have supernatural powers.
Our brains do a tremendous amount of work to boil down the complexity of real­
ity into simpler mental models that can be easily stored, considered, and manipu­
lated. And this is not just the case for visual objects. It is also the case for human 
relationships, risk and reward evaluation, and decision making. Our minds look at 
a complex situation and try to boil it down to a simple set of rules and relationships 
that we can manipulate internally.
As game designers, we care a lot about these mental models because games, 
with their simple rules, are like Charlie Brown—they are predigested models that 
we can easily absorb and manipulate. This is why they are relaxing to play—they 
are less work for our brain than the real world, because so much of the complexity 
has been stripped away. Abstract strategy games, like tic-tac-toe and backgammon, 
are almost completely bare models. Other games, like computer-based RPGs, take 
a simple model and coat it with some sugary aesthetics, so that the very act of 
working to digest the model is pleasurable. This is so different from the real world, 
where you have to work so hard to figure out what the rules of the game even are 
and then work even harder to properly play by them, never sure if you are doing 
the right thing. And this is why games can sometimes be great practice for the 
real world—it is why they still teach chess at West Point—games give us practice 
digesting and experimenting with simpler models, so we can work our way up to 
ones as complex as the real world and be competent at dealing with them when 
we are ready.

138
CHAPTER Ten • THE EXPERIENCE IS IN THE PLAYER’S MIND
The important thing to understand is that everything we experience and think 
about is a model—not reality. Reality is beyond our understanding and comprehen­
sion. All we can understand is our little model of reality. Sometimes this model 
breaks, and we have to fix it. The reality we experience is just an illusion, but this 
illusion is the only reality we will ever know. As a designer, if you can understand 
and control how that illusion is formed in your player’s mind, you will create experi­
ences that feel as real, or more real, than reality itself.
Focus
Time sometimes flies like a bird, sometimes crawls like a snail; but a man is 
happiest when he does not even notice whether it passes swiftly or slowly.
—Ivan Turgenev
One crucial technique our brains use to make sense of the world is the ability 
to focus its attention selectively, ignoring some things and devoting more mental 
power to others. The brain’s ability to do this can be startling. One example is the 
“cocktail party effect,” which is our remarkable ability to pay attention to a single 
conversation when a roomful of people are all talking at once. Even though the 
sound waves from many conversations are hitting our ears simultaneously, we 
somehow have the ability to “tune in” one and “tune out” the others. To study this, 
psychologists have performed what are sometimes called “dichotic ear ­studies.” 
In these experiments, subjects wear headphones that deliver different audio expe­
riences to each ear. For example, a voice in a subject’s left ear might be reading 
Shakespeare, and the voice in a subject’s right ear might be reading a stream of 
numbers. Provided the voices are not too similar, subjects who are asked to focus 
on one of the voices and repeat back what they are hearing as they hear it are gen­
erally able to do so. Afterward, when asked questions about what the other voice 
was saying, subjects generally have no idea. Their brains focused only on selected 
information and tuned out the rest.
What we focus on at any given moment is determined through a blend of our 
unconscious desires and our conscious will. When we create games, our goal is 
to create an experience interesting enough that it holds the player’s focus as long 
and as intensely as possible. When something captures our complete attention and 
imagination for a long period, we enter an interesting mental state. The rest of the 
world seems to fall away, and we have no intrusive thoughts. All we are thinking 
about is what we are doing, and we completely lose track of time. This state of 
sustained focus, pleasure, and enjoyment is referred to as “flow” and has been the 
subject of extensive study by psychologist Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi and many oth­
ers. Flow is sometimes defined as “a feeling of complete and energized focus in an 
activity, with a high level of enjoyment and fulfillment.” It pays for game designers 

139
Focus
to make a careful study of flow, because this is exactly the feeling we want the play­
ers of our games to enjoy. The following are some of the key components necessary 
to create an activity that puts a player into a flow state:
●
●
Clear goals: When our goals are clear, we are able to more easily stay focused on 
our task. When goals are unclear, we are not “into” our task, for we aren’t at all 
certain whether our current actions are useful.
●
●
No distractions: Distractions steal focus from our task. No focus, no flow. This 
means engaging both mind and hands. Menial labor with no thought makes the 
mind wander; just sitting and thinking can make the hands fidget. These “itchy” 
feelings are each a kind of distraction.
●
●
Direct feedback: If every time we take an action, we have to wait before we 
know what effect the action caused, we will quickly become distracted and lose 
focus on our task. When feedback is immediate, we can easily stay focused. 
We’ll talk much more about feedback in Chapter 15, “Interface.”
●
●
Continuously challenging: Human beings love a challenge. But it must be a 
challenge we think we can achieve. If we start to think we can’t achieve it, we 
feel frustrated, and our minds start seeking an activity more likely to be reward­
ing. On the other hand, if the challenge is too easy, we feel bored, and again, our 
minds start seeking more rewarding activities. Chapter 13, “Balance,” will have 
more to say about challenge.
Flow activities must manage to stay in the narrow margin of challenge that lies 
between boredom and frustration, for both of these unpleasant extremes cause our 
mind to change its focus to a new activity. Csikszentmihalyi calls this margin the 
“flow channel.” He gives an example of the flow channel, using, not surprisingly, 
a game:
Let us assume that the figure below represents a specific activity—for example, 
the game of tennis. The two theoretically most important dimensions of the 
experience, challenges and skills, are represented on the two axes of the dia­
gram. The letter A represents Alex, a boy who is learning to play tennis. The 
diagram shows Alex at four different points in time. When he first starts playing 
(A1), Alex has practically no skills, and the only challenge he faces is hitting the 
ball over the net. This is not a very difficult feat, but Alex is likely to enjoy it 
because the difficulty is just right for his rudimentary skills. So at this point he 
will probably be in flow. But he cannot stay there long. After a while, if he keeps 
practicing, his skills are bound to improve, and then he will grow bored just bat­
ting the ball over the net (A2). Or it might happen that he meets a more practiced 
opponent, in which case he will realize that there are much harder challenges 
for him than just lobbing the ball—at that point, he will feel some anxiety (A3) 
concerning his poor performance.

140
CHAPTER Ten • THE EXPERIENCE IS IN THE PLAYER’S MIND
Neither boredom nor anxiety are positive experiences, so Alex will be motivated 
to return to the flow state. How is he to do it? Glancing again at the diagram, we 
see that if he is bored (A2) and wishes to be in flow again, Alex has essentially 
only one choice: to increase the challenges he is facing. (He also has a second 
choice, which is to give up tennis altogether—in which case A would simply dis­
appear from the diagram.) By setting himself a new and more difficult goal that 
matches his skills—for instance, to beat an opponent just a little more advanced 
that he is—Alex would be back in flow (A4).
If Alex is anxious (A3), the way back to flow requires that he increase his skills. 
Theoretically he could also reduce the challenges he is facing, and thus return 
to the flow where he started (in A1), but in practice it is difficult to ignore chal­
lenges once one is aware that they exist.
The diagram shows that both A1 and A4 represent situations in which Alex is 
in flow. Although both are equally enjoyable, the two states are quite different 
in that A4 is a more complex experience than A1. It is more complex because it 
involves greater challenges, and demands greater skill from the player.
But A4, although complex and enjoyable, does not represent a stable situation 
either. As Alex keeps playing, either he will become bored by the stale oppor­
tunities he finds at that level, or he will become anxious and frustrated by his 
relatively low ability. So the motivation to enjoy himself again will push him 
to get back into the flow channel, but now at a level of complexity even higher 
than A4.
It is this dynamic feature that explains why flow activities lead to growth and 
discovery. One cannot enjoy doing the same thing at the same level for long. 
We grow either bored or frustrated, and then the desire to enjoy ourselves again 
pushes us to stretch our skills, or to discover new opportunities for using them.
You can see how keeping someone in the flow channel is a delicate balance, for 
a player’s skill level seldom stays in one place. As their skill increases, you must

present them with commensurate challenges. For traditional games, this challenge 
primarily comes from seeking out more challenging opponents. In videogames, 
there is often a sequence of levels that gradually get more challenging. This pattern 
of levels of increasing difficulty is nicely self-balancing—players with a lot of skill 
can usually move through the lower levels quickly, until they come to the levels that 
challenge them. This connection between skill and the speed of finishing a level 
helps keep skilled players from getting bored. However, it is the rare player who is 
persistent enough to win the game, mastering all levels. Most players eventually 
reach a level where they spend so much time in the frustration zone that they give 
up on the game. There is much debate about whether that is a bad thing (many play­
ers are frustrated) or a good thing (since only skilled, persistent players can reach 
the end, the accomplishment is special).
Many designers are quick to point out that while staying in the flow channel is 
important, some ways of moving up the channel are better than others. Moving 
straight up the channel like this…
…is definitely better than the game ending in anxiety or boredom. But consider 
the play experience that follows a track more like this:

CHAPTER Ten • THE EXPERIENCE IS IN THE PLAYER’S MIND
This will probably feel much more interesting to a player. It is a repeating cycle 
of increasing challenge, followed by a reward, often of more power, which gives 
an easier period of less challenge. Soon enough, the challenge ramps up again. For 
example, a videogame might feature a gun that lets me destroy enemies if I shoot 
them three times. As I proceed through the game, the enemies grow more numer­
ous, increasing the challenge. If I rise to the challenge, though, and defeat enough 
enemies, I might be rewarded with a gun that lets me destroy the enemies with only 
two shots. Suddenly the game is easier, which is very rewarding. This easy period 
doesn’t last though, because soon new enemies that take three and even four shots 
to destroy, even with my new gun, will start to appear, taking the challenge to new 
heights.
This cycle of “tense and release, tense and release” comes up again and again 
in design. It seems to be inherent to human enjoyment. Too much tension, and we 
wear out. Too much relaxation, and we grow bored. When we fluctuate between 
the two, we enjoy both excitement and relaxation, and this oscillation also provides 
both the pleasure of variety and the pleasure of anticipation.
You can see how useful the idea of flow and the flow channel can be for discuss­
ing and analyzing a gameplay experience—so useful that it is Lens #21.
Flow is a very hard thing to test for. You won’t see it in ten minutes of gameplay. You 
must observe players for longer periods. Even trickier, a game that keeps someone 
in flow the first few times they play it may later become boring or frustrating.
Lens #21: The Lens of Flow
To use this lens, consider what is holding your player’s focus.
Ask yourself these questions:
●
●
Does my game have clear goals? If not, how can I fix that?
●
●
Are the goals of the player the same goals I intended?
●
●
Are there parts of the game that distract players to the point they forget 
their goal? If so, can these distractions be reduced or tied into the game 
goals?
●
●
Does my game provide a steady stream of not-too-easy, not-too-hard chal­
lenges, taking into account the fact that the player’s skills may be gradually 
improving?
●
●
Are the player’s skills improving at the rate I had hoped? If not, how can I 
change that?

143
Empathy
When observing a player, flow can be easy to miss—you must learn to recog­
nize it. It is not always accompanied by external expressions of emotion—it often 
involves quiet withdrawal. Players in flow playing solo games will often be quiet, 
possibly muttering to themselves. They are so focused that they are sometimes slow 
to respond or irritated if you ask them questions. Players in flow during multiplayer 
games will sometimes communicate with one another enthusiastically, constantly 
focused on the game. Once you notice a player going into flow during your game, 
you need to watch them closely—they won’t stay there forever. You must watch for 
that crucial moment—the event that moves them out of the flow channel, so you 
can figure out how to make sure that event doesn’t happen in your next prototype 
of the game.
One final note: don’t forget to turn the Lens of Flow on yourself! You will surely 
find that times of flow are when you get the most done as a designer—make sure to 
organize your design time so you can get to that special state of mind as frequently 
as possible.
Empathy
As human beings, we have an amazing ability to project ourselves into the place of 
others. When we do this, we think the other person’s thoughts and feel their feel­
ings, to the best of our ability. It is one of the hallmarks of our ability to understand 
one another that we can do this, and it is an integral part of gameplay.
There is an interesting theater exercise where a group of actors is divided into 
two groups. In the first group, each actor chooses an emotion (happiness, sadness, 
anger, etc.), and then they all mill about the stage, each trying to project their cho­
sen emotion through attitude, walk, and facial expression. The second group does 
not choose an emotion. They just walk about at random among the first group, try­
ing to establish eye contact with others. The first time they try this, the actors in 
the second group discover themselves doing something shocking—whenever they 
make eye contact with someone projecting an emotion, they take on the emotion 
themselves and make the corresponding facial expression, without consciously 
willing to do so.
This is how strong our power of empathy can be. Without even trying, we become 
other people. When we see someone who is happy, we can feel their joy as if it is our 
own. When we see someone who is sad, we can feel their pain. Entertainers use our 
power of empathy to make us feel we are part of the story world they are creating. 
Amazingly, our empathy can be cast from one person to another in the blink of an 
eye. We can even empathize with animals.
Have you noticed that dogs have much richer facial expression than other ani­
mals? They express emotion with their eyes and eyebrows much like we do 
(Figure 10.8). Wolves (dog ancestors) don’t have nearly the range of facial expres­
sion of domesticated dogs. Dogs appear to have evolved this ability as a survival 

144
CHAPTER Ten • THE EXPERIENCE IS IN THE PLAYER’S MIND
skill. Dogs that could make the right faces could capture our empathy, and we, sud­
denly feeling their feelings, became more likely to take care of them.
Of course, the brain does all this using mental models—in truth, we are empa­
thizing not with real people or animals, but with our mental models of them—
which means we are easily tricked. We can feel emotion when there is none. 
A photo, a drawing, or a videogame character can just as easily capture our empa­
thy. Cinematographers understand this, and they fling our empathy all over the 
place, from one character to another, thus manipulating our feelings and emotions. 
Next time you watch television, pay attention, moment to moment, about where 
your empathy is going and why it is going there.
As game designers, we will make use of empathy in the same ways that novelists, 
graphic artists, and filmmakers do, but we also have our own set of new empathic 
interactions. Games are about problem solving, and empathic projection is a useful 
method of problem solving. If I can imagine myself in the place of another, I can 
make better decisions about what that person can do to solve a particular problem. 
Also, in games, you don’t just project your feelings into a character, you project your 
entire decision-making capacity into that character and can become them in a way 
that isn’t possible in noninteractive media. We will discuss the implications of this 
in detail in Chapter 20, “Characters.”

Imagination
Imagination
The most beautiful world is always entered through imagination.
—Hellen Keller
Imagination puts the player into the game by putting the game into the player 
(Figure 10.9).
You might think, when I talk about the power of the player’s imagination, that I 
might mean their creative imagination and the power to make up dreamlike fantasy 
worlds—but I am talking about something much more mundane. The imagination 
I’m talking about is the miraculous power that everyone takes for granted—the 
everyday imagination that every person uses for communication and problem solv­
ing. For example, if I tell you a short story, “The mailman stole my car yesterday,” I 
have actually told you very little but already you have a picture of what happened. 
Weirdly, your picture is full of details that I didn’t include in my story. Take a look 
at the mental image that formed, and answer these questions:
●
●
What did the mailman look like?
●
●
What kind of neighborhood was my car in when he stole it?
●
●
What color was the car?
●
●
What time of day did he steal it?
●
●
How did he steal it?
●
●
Why did he steal it?
Now, I didn’t tell you any of those things, but your amazing imagination just 
made up a bunch of these details so that you could more easily think about what 
F I G U R E

146
CHAPTER Ten • THE EXPERIENCE IS IN THE PLAYER’S MIND
I was telling you. Now, if I suddenly give you more information, like “It wasn’t a 
real car, but an expensive model toy car,” you quickly reformulate your imaginary 
image to fit what you have heard, and your answers to the preceding questions 
might change correspondingly. This ability to automatically fill in gaps is very rele­
vant for game design, for it means that our games don’t need to give every detail and 
players will be able to fill in the rest. The art comes in knowing what you should 
show the player and what you should leave to their imagination.
This power, when you think about it, is quite incredible. The fact that our brains 
only deal in simplified models of reality means that we can manipulate these mod­
els effortlessly, sometimes into situations that wouldn’t be possible in reality. I can 
see an armchair and imagine what it would look like if it were a different color or a 
different size, if it was made of oatmeal, or if it was walking around. We do a lot of 
problem solving this way. If I ask you to find a way to change a light bulb without a 
stepladder, you immediately start imagining possible solutions.
Imagination has two crucial functions: the first is communication (often for sto­
rytelling) and the second is problem solving. Since games prominently feature both 
of these, game designers must understand how to engage the player’s imagination 
as a storytelling partner, as well as having a sense of the problems it will and will 
not be able to solve.
The human mind is truly the most fascinating, amazing, complex thing that we 
know. We may never unravel all of its mysteries. The more we know about it, the 
better a chance we’ll have of creating a great experience in it, for it is the site where 
all our game experiences take place. And never forget! You are equipped with one 
yourself. You can use your own powers of modeling, focus, empathy, and imagina­
tion to get to know how these powers are being used in the mind of your player. 
In this way, self-listening can be the key to listening to your audience. In the next 
chapter, we’ll do some of that self-listening to understand why the brain is moti­
vated to use any of these powers at all.

Player’s Motivation

CHAPTER Eleven • THE PLAYER’S MIND IS DRIVEN BY THE PLAYER’S MOTIVATION
Let us begin this chapter by facing a painful truth.
Games are not important.
Sure, we like playing them. We get all excited about them and have wonderful, mem­
orable experiences when playing them. But in the larger scheme of our lives, there is 
always something more important we could be doing. And, in fact, this is true for all 
entertainment. It is no exaggeration to say that the goal of all entertainment experi­
ences is to take something unimportant (such as a ball going through a hoop, a story 
about imaginary animals, or whether this card is a king or an ace) and make it seem 
very important indeed. Is this deception? It is not. In the end, we are always aware 
that it is “just a game.” But during play, something happens in us that makes it feel 
like it is so much more. Something drives us and compels us to care about these trivial 
experiences as if they were matters of life and death. This is the magic of motivation. 
The question of why we do what we do is as old as philosophy itself, but there can be 
no doubt that game designers seem to have special insights into human motivation.
The reality of what game designers actually understand is somewhat murkier, 
and it is this murkiness that makes game design so challenging. In truth, most 
designers create systems of motivation less through masterful understanding of 
the intricacies of psychology and more through gut instinct and experimentation, 
occasionally stumbling into success. However, any insights about motivation are 
potentially useful, and this is one of the rare areas where psychological research is 
well aligned with our design goals, so let’s start there.
Needs…
In 1943, psychologist Abraham Maslow wrote a paper titled “A Theory of Human 
Motivation,” which proposed a hierarchy of human needs. This is often presented 
as a pyramid:
F I G U R E
11.2
Self-
actualization
Pursue inner talent
Creativity · Fullfilment
Belonging love
Self-esteem
Achievement · Mastery
Recognition · Respect
Maslow’s hierarchy of needs
Safety
Security · Stability · Freedom from fear
Friends · Family · Spouse · Lover
Physiological
Food · Water · Shelter · Warmth

149
…And More Needs
The idea here is that people are not motivated to pursue the higher level needs 
on this list until the lower needs are satisfied. For example, if someone is starving 
to death, this is a priority over a feeling of safety. If someone doesn’t feel safe, they 
aren’t going to seriously pursue human relationships. If someone doesn’t feel love 
and social belonging, they aren’t going to pursue things that will boost their self-
esteem. And if they don’t have good self-esteem, they will not be able to pursue 
their talents (remember the major gift?) to do what they were “born to do.”
If you think hard, you can come up with some possible exceptions to this model, 
but overall, it works well enough to be a very useful tool for discussing player’s 
motivations in games. It is interesting to think about different game activities and 
where they fall on this hierarchy. Many game activities are about achievement and 
mastery, which places them at level four, self-esteem. But some are lower. Looking 
at the hierarchy, the reasons for the appeal and staying power of multiplayer games 
suddenly become clear—they fulfill more basic needs than single player gameplay, 
so it shouldn’t be surprising that many players will feel more motivated to do them.
Can you think of gameplay activities that go even farther down on the hierarchy, 
to the second or first level? How about activities on the fifth level? It can be argued 
that the success of Minecraft comes from its complete coverage of the pyramid. 
It covers the bottom two levels with its fantasy context (you are trying to gather 
resources to build safe shelter), and it covers the top three levels by being a multi­
player game about mastery and creativity.
Any game that connects you with other people lets you feel a sense of accom­
plishment, and lets you build and create things that let you express yourself fulfills 
the needs on the third, fourth, and fifth levels. Viewed from this perspective, the 
popularity and staying power of games with both online communities and content 
creation tools makes a lot of sense. It is also interesting to consider how the differ­
ent levels can feed into one another. But there are other ways to think about needs.
…And More Needs
As interesting as Maslow’s point of view is, more modern psychologists have taken 
up new points of view on the question of needs. Particularly relevant to games is 
the work of Edward Deci and Richard Ryan, who have done a great deal to develop 
what is called self-determination theory. Don’t let that ugly name scare you. All 
they are saying is that just as humans have physical needs, we also have mental 
needs—not just wants or desires, but actual needs. When these needs are unmet, 
we become mentally unhealthy. Surprisingly, Ryan and Deci suggest that we have 
precisely three mental needs:
	1.	 Competence: I need to feel good at something.
	2.	 Autonomy: I need freedom to do things my own way.
	3.	 Relatedness: I need to connect with other people.

150
CHAPTER Eleven • THE PLAYER’S MIND IS DRIVEN BY THE PLAYER’S MOTIVATION
These are somewhat startling in their simplicity, but a great body of evidence 
backs up their validity. And it is hard not to notice how well games tend to fulfill all 
three of these needs. Games are designed to make you feel mastery. Games give you 
freedom to play the way you want to play. In fact, they give more freedom than that: 
since they are only games, you can stop playing whenever you like. And, of course, 
most games are designed to be played with other people, to help form social con­
nections and bonds. In future chapters, we will encounter lenses that individually 
address competence, autonomy, and relatedness. But to remember the importance 
of needs in general, take this lens.
Intrinsic vs. Extrinsic Motivation
Yet another way to think about motivation is by looking at where it comes from. 
This is particularly relevant for game designers, since games use so many different 
kinds of motivation to keep players interested. On the surface, it sounds simple: 
when I feel like doing something, we say I am intrinsically motivated, but when 
someone pays me to do something, we say I am extrinsically motivated. It may 
sound simple, but in the reality of games, things quickly become tangled. Do I play 
Pac-Man because I enjoy the visceral thrill of racing and chasing through the maze 
Lens #22: The Lens of Needs
To use this lens, stop thinking about your game, and start thinking about 
what basic human needs it fulfills.
Ask yourself these questions:
●
●
On which levels of Maslow’s hierarchy is my game operating?
●
●
Does it fill the needs of competence, autonomy, and relatedness?
●
●
How can I make my game fill more basic needs than it already does?
●
●
For the needs my game is already filling, how can it fill those needs even 
better?
It sounds strange to talk about a game fulfilling basic human needs, but every­
thing that people do is an attempt to fulfill these needs in some way. And keep 
in mind, some games fulfill needs better than others—your game can’t just 
promise the need, it must deliver fulfillment of the need. If a player imagines 
that playing your game is going to make them feel better about themselves, or 
get to know their friends better, and your game doesn’t deliver on these needs, 
your player will move on to a game that does.

151
Wanna vs. Hafta
(intrinsic) or because the game gives me points (extrinsic)? What if I am truly 
motivated by the excitement of getting a high score? Is that intrinsic, or extrinsic, 
or both? Let’s say that PepsiCo creates a game where you get points and prizes for 
drinking Mountain Dew. That’s clearly a system of extrinsic motivation. But what 
if the game becomes a joke between my friends and I and we have an intrinsically 
fun social experience one-upping each other by winning more points and prizes? 
Some are quick to vilify extrinsic motivation as being “cheap” game design, but 
savvy designers know that one motivation can grow on another, like a vine grow­
ing on a trellis.
Some psychologists have tried to illustrate the complexity of intrinsic and extrin­
sic motivations by showing them as a continuum:
The key idea is that “intrinsic” and “extrinsic” are not binary, but a gradient 
where the more the motivation comes from “your true self,” the more internal it is. 
As a game designer, it is important to have a sense of how internal or external the 
different motivations in your game really are, for all motivations are not created 
equal, and sometimes they can interact in unexpected ways. In one famous study, 
two groups of children were asked to draw pictures. The first group was paid for 
each picture they created, the second group was not. If you believe the idea that 
more motivation is better, then you might expect that the paid group would draw 
more pictures and better pictures. And you would be half right—they did draw 
more pictures, but the quality was lower—the pictures were not as interesting and 
thoughtful. But here’s the surprising part: when drawing time was up, each group 
was asked to wait, while the researchers left the room. The unpaid children, with 
crayons and paper in front of them, naturally kept drawing. The paid children, 
however, did not. They put their crayons down and just waited. It would seem 
motivation is not purely additive; rather, the act of adding extrinsic motivation to 
something that is already intrinsically motivating slides it along the continuum 
toward the external, draining away the intrinsic motivation! This has serious 
repercussions for those who believe that any activity can be easily “gamified” by 
adding simple points, badges, and rewards.
Wanna vs. Hafta
In Chapter 4, “Game,” we talked about how a change in attitude can turn work into 
play, and vice versa. This, without a doubt, is meaningfully connected to motivation. 
Think back to the example of the factory worker who made a game of trying to beat

his manufacturing record each day and how it vastly increased his motivation and 
his engagement. What happened there, exactly? Certainly, one could argue that his 
motivation became more internal. He was less focused on the external reward for 
doing his job (getting paid) and became more focused on something more internal—
beating his personal record, because he wanted to, and thus his motivation became 
more his own.
But there is something else at work here, too. It was something that I did not fully 
comprehend until I was reading a book about neuroscience that pointed out that 
pleasure seeking and pain avoiding are two different systems in the brain. They are 
not a simple continuum of pain to pleasure, but two different sets of motivational 
circuits. So often, though, we just group pleasure seeking and pain avoiding into 
one lump we call “motivation” and think no more about it. But when we think to 
separate them, interesting things come to light.
The relevance of this to games becomes clear when considering the following 
example. Let’s say I start a new software company: Big Red Button Software. Our 
first product is a new kind of tax preparation software. We send you a big red 
button in the mail, you push it, and bam! Your taxes are instantly prepared, guar­
anteeing you the maximum refund allowable by law. I suspect you would agree 
that is a pretty amazing software product, and I’m glad you like it, because we are 
getting ready to release our second product: it’s a game called Angry Birds. Again, 
we send you a big red button in the mail, and this time when you push it, bam! 
You instantly win!
But that’s not such an amazing software product, is it? In fact, it might be the 
worst game ever. What is it that makes these two applications so radically differ­
ent? Simply this: I “hafta” do my taxes, but I “wanna” play a game. Taxes are all 
about pain avoidance. I don’t do them because I enjoy them, or because someone 
is paying me to do them, but because I’ll suffer heavy fines and maybe go to jail if 
I don’t do them. But playing a game is all about pleasure seeking. There is no pen­
alty for not playing—I do it simply because I enjoy doing it. This has nothing to do 
with the activity and everything to do with our attitude toward it. A friend of mine 
loves preparing tax forms, and likewise, video games bore him. For him, taxes are 
a “wanna” activity, and videogames are a “hafta.”
So why do we care about this? Because while many gameplaying motivations are 
about pleasure seeking, not all of them are—many are centered on pain avoidance. 
When you are avoiding enemies and “trying not to die,” you are in pain avoidance 
mode. When you are scooping up gold stars and scoring clever combos, you are in 
pleasure-seeking mode. They are both valid kinds of motivation and can actually 
work well in combination. However, sometimes the combination gets out of bal­
ance. “Free to play” games often begin entirely focused on pleasure seeking: big 
rewards, unexpected bonuses, and exciting animations. But over time, they build 
up obligations—come back by a certain time or lose points, invite more friends or 
miss out on prizes. Gradually, these games slide from pleasure seeking motivations 
to pain avoidance motivations. They keep you coming back, but you don’t always 
feel as good about it. For this reason, as designer Sheri Graner Ray puts it, “People 

153
Wanna vs. Hafta
don’t just stop playing these games, they divorce them.” Many World of Warcraft 
players have had similar experiences. They begin playing because there are so 
many fun things to do, one of which is to join a guild and enjoy the friendship and 
camaraderie of team play. But sometimes guild leaders, in a desire to succeed, pres­
sure their members to play more than they want to. Players want to avoid the pain 
of shame from their guild, so they keep showing up, and gradually, playing starts to 
feel like something you “hafta” do.
For an interesting perspective on the motivations in your game, try putting each 
one on a matrix, where one axis is internal/external and the other is hafta/wanna. 
It is one more illustration of how richly complex and interesting human motivation 
can be.
Be wary of those who tell you that human motivation is a simple thing, for you 
ignore its complexity at your peril. Take this lens to help you remember.
Lens #23: The Lens of Motivation
Every game is a complex ecosystem of motivations. To examine them more 
closely, ask yourself these questions:
●
●
What motivations do players have to play my game?
●
●
Which motivations are most internal? Which are most external?
●
●
Which are pleasure seeking? Which are pain avoiding?
●
●
Which motivations support each other?
●
●
Which motivations are in conflict?

CHAPTER Eleven • THE PLAYER’S MIND IS DRIVEN BY THE PLAYER’S MOTIVATION
Novelty
Unquestionably, the popular thing in this world is novelty.
—Mark Twain
It is impossible to overestimate the importance of novelty as motivation in the realm 
of game design. Human beings are natural explorers, and we are always interested 
in that which is new. If quality was our primary concern, our bookstores would be 
full of classics whose quality is time tested and true. Instead, classics get a dusty 
shelf in the back, while the majority of books for sale are brand new. And this is 
even truer for games. Conversation about games is dominated by what is new and 
what is coming next. Thirst for novelty is a tremendous part of what motivates play­
ers to purchase games. Games and systems that cost hundreds of dollars today will 
be sold for pennies on eBay tomorrow. Thirst for novelty is also big part of what 
keeps players playing—believing there is something new on the next level is a pow­
erful incentive to finish this one.
One of the most powerful kinds of novelty in games is novelty that makes you 
think in a whole new way. Portal is a great example of this, with its bizarre mechanic 
of shooting connected “holes” into ceilings, walls, and floors. Its advertising slogan, 
“Now you’re thinking with portals,” is very appropriate, because the mechanics of 
the game make you think about the world in a whole new way. Even though it’s the 
same old world, you have a new way of interacting with it—one that probably never 
occurred to you because it didn’t seem possible. But suddenly it is not only possible 
but urgent that you do so. Novel ways of thinking stretch our brains in a way that 
can feel incredibly rewarding.
Keep in mind, however, that there is such a thing as being too novel. Every suc­
cessful game is a mix of the novel and the familiar. Many fascinating games have 
failed by being ahead of their time. An even greater danger is that your game may 
have novelty, but no other qualities to give it staying power. Be cautious not to fool 
yourself that novelty is enough. Novelty will get the word out and drive early sales, 
but if there is not a solid game underneath, your players will vanish as suddenly as 
they arrived.
It is easy to shake one’s head at the sad state of a society that demands novelty 
over quality, but seeking and seizing novelty is the way the human race explores 
what is possible, ever questing for a better world. So do not despair at man’s insa­
tiable appetite for novelty—instead, embrace it, and give the people what they want: 
something they have never experienced before. Just be sure that when the novelty 
wears off, there is still something there to care about. Take this lens to be sure you 
remember.

155
Judgment
Judgment
The fourth level of Maslow’s hierarchy, self-esteem, is the one most intimately con­
nected to games. But why? One deep need common to everyone is the need to be 
judged. This might sound wrong—don’t people hate being judged? They don’t—
they only hate being judged unfairly. We have a deep inner need to know how we 
stack up. And when we aren’t happy with how we are judged, we work hard until 
we are judged favorably. The fact that games are excellent systems for objective 
judgment is one of their most appealing qualities.
Lens #24: The Lens of Novelty
Different isn’t always better, but better is always different.
—Scotty Meltzer
To ensure you harness the powerful motivation of novelty, ask yourself these 
questions:
●
●
What is novel about my game?
●
●
Does my game have novelties throughout or just at the beginning?
●
●
Do I have the right mix of the novel and the familiar?
●
●
When the novelty wears off, will players still enjoy my game?
Lens #25: The Lens of Judgment
To decide if your game is a good judge of the players, ask yourself these 
questions:
●
●
What does your game judge about the players?
●
●
How does it communicate this judgment?
●
●
Do players feel the judgment is fair?
●
●
Do they care about the judgment?
●
●
Does the judgment make them want to improve?

CHAPTER Eleven • THE PLAYER’S MIND IS DRIVEN BY THE PLAYER’S MOTIVATION
This chapter has only scratched the surface of the nature of human motivation with 
regard to games. But don’t worry—it isn’t a topic we can abandon. Every aspect of 
creating great games ultimately relates back to human motivation. Consider this a 
starting point, a foundation on which you will build greater and greater understand­
ing of why we do what we do. Let’s take the next step by examining the mecha­
nisms that make games work.

CHAPTER Twelve • SOME ELEMENTS ARE GAME MECHANICS
We have talked a lot about designers, players, and the experience of gameplaying. 
It is time to talk nuts and bolts about what games are really made of. Game design­
ers must learn to use their x-ray vision to be able to see past the skin of a game and 
quickly discern the skeleton, which is defined by the game mechanics.
But what are these mysterious mechanics?
Game mechanics are the core of what a game truly is. They are the interactions 
and relationships that remain when all of the aesthetics, technology, and story are 
stripped away.
As with many things in game design, we do not have a universally agreed-upon 
taxonomy of game mechanics. One reason for this is that the mechanics of gameplay, 
even for simple games, tend to be quite complex and very difficult to disentangle. 
Attempts at simplifying these complex mechanics to the point of perfect mathemati­
cal understanding result in systems of description that are obviously incomplete. 
Economic “game theory” is an example of this. You would think with a name like 
“game theory,” it would be of great use to game designers, but in truth, it can only 
handle such simple systems that it is seldom useful for designing real games.
But there is another reason that taxonomies of game mechanics are incomplete. 
On one level, game mechanics are very objective, clearly stated sets of rules. On 
another level, though, they involve something more mysterious. Earlier, we dis­
cussed how the mind breaks down all games into mental models that it can easily 
manipulate. Part of game mechanics necessarily involves describing the structure 
of these mental models. Since these exist largely in the darkness of the subcon­
scious mind, it is hard for us come up with a well-defined analytical taxonomy of 
how they work.
But that doesn’t mean we shouldn’t try. Some authors have approached this 
problem from a very academic perspective, more concerned with an analysis that 
is philosophically watertight than with one that might be useful to designers. 
We can’t afford this kind of pedantry. Knowledge for the sake of knowledge is a 
fine thing, but our interest is in knowledge for the sake of great games, even if 
it means a taxonomy that has some gray areas. With that said, I present the tax­
onomy that I use to classify game mechanics. These mechanics fall largely into 
seven main categories, and each one can provide useful insights on your game 
design.
Mechanic 1: Space
Every game takes place in some kind of space. This space is the “magic circle” 
of gameplay. It defines the various places that can exist in a game and how those 
places are related to one another. As a game mechanic, space is a mathematical 
construct. We need to strip away all visuals, all aesthetics, and simply look at the 
abstract construction of a game’s space.

159
Mechanic 1: Space
There are no hard and fast rules for describing these abstract, stripped-down 
game spaces. Generally, though, game spaces
	1.	 Are either discrete or continuous
	2.	 Have some number of dimensions
	3.	 Have bounded areas that may or may not be connected
The game of tic-tac-toe, for example, features a board that is discrete and 2D. What 
do we mean by “discrete”? Well, even though we commonly draw a tic-tac-toe board 
like this:
It is not really a continuous space, because we only care about boundaries, not 
the space within each cell. Whether you put your X...

160
CHAPTER Twelve • SOME ELEMENTS ARE GAME MECHANICS
It doesn’t really matter—all those are equivalent in terms of the game. But if you 
put your X here:
That is another matter entirely. So, even though the players can make their marks 
in an infinite number of places in a continuous 2D space, there are really only nine 
discrete places that have any actual meaning in the game. In a sense, we really have 
nine zero-dimensional cells, connected to each other in a 2D grid, like this:
Each circle represents a 0D place, and each line shows which places are con­
nected to each other. In tic-tac-toe, there is no movement from place to place, but 
adjacency is very important. Without adjacency, it would just be nine disconnected 
points. With the adjacency, it becomes a discrete 2D space, with clear boundar­
ies—the space is three cells wide and three cells high. The space for a chessboard 
is similar, except that it is an 8⁜×⁜8 space.
A game with fancy aesthetics can fool you into thinking that its functional space 
is more complex than it really is. Consider a Monopoly board.
At first glance, you might say it is a discrete 2D space, like a chessboard, with 
most of the middle cells missing. But it can be more simply represented as a 1D 
space—a single line of forty discrete points, which connects to itself in a loop. Sure, 
on the game board, the corner spaces look special because they are bigger, but func­
tionally that doesn’t matter, since each game square is a zero-dimensional space. 
Multiple game pieces can be in a single game square, but their relative positions 
within that square are meaningless.

F I G U R E
12.7

161
Mechanic 1: Space
But not all game spaces are discrete. A pool table is an example of a continuous 
2D space. It has a fixed length and width, and the balls can freely move about on the 
table, ricocheting off of the walls or falling into the holes, which are in fixed posi­
tions. Everyone would agree that the space is continuous, but is it 2D? Since clever 
players can sometimes cause the balls to leave the table and hop over each other, 
you could certainly argue that this is really a 3D game space, and for some pur­
poses, it is useful to think of it that way. There are no hard and fast rules for these 
abstract functional spaces. When designing a new game, there are times it will be 
useful for you to think of your space as 2D and there are times when thinking of 
it as 3D is more useful. The same goes for continuous vs. discrete. The purpose of 
stripping down a game into a functional space is so that you can more easily think 
about it, without the distractions of aesthetics or the real world. If you are thinking 
about modifying the game of soccer to a playing field with new boundaries, you 
will probably think about it in terms of a 2D continuous space.
But if you are thinking about modifying the height of the goal, or changing the 
rules about how high the players can kick the ball, or adding hills and valleys to the 
field, it is useful to think of it as a continuous 3D space instead.
There might even be times you think about a soccer field as a discrete space—
breaking it up into, say, nine major areas of play, with two extra areas on the left 
and right representing the goals. This mode of thinking might prove useful if you 
are analyzing the different kinds of play that take place in different parts of the field,

CHAPTER Twelve • SOME ELEMENTS ARE GAME MECHANICS
for example. The important thing is that you come up with abstract models of your 
game space that help you better understand the interrelationships of your game.
Nested Spaces
Many game spaces are more complex than the examples we have looked at here. 
Often, they feature “spaces within spaces.” Computer-based fantasy role-playing 
games are a good example of this. Most of them feature an “outdoor space” that is 
continuous and 2D. A player traveling this space sometimes encounters little icons 
representing towns, or caves, or castles. Players can enter these as completely sepa­
rate spaces, not really connected in any way to the “outdoor space” but through 
the gateway icon. This is not geographically realistic, of course—but it matches our 
mental models of how we think about spaces—when we are indoors we think about 
the space inside the building we are in, with little thought to how it exactly relates 
to the space outside. For this reason, these “spaces within spaces” are often a great 
way to create a simple representation of a complex world.
Zero Dimensions
Does every game take place in a space? Consider a game like “Twenty Questions,” 
where one player thinks of an object, and the other player asks “yes or no” ques­
tions trying to guess what it is. There is no game board and nothing moves—the 
game is just two people talking. You might argue that this game has no space. On 
the other hand, you might find it useful to think of the game happening in a space 
that looks like Figure 12.11.
The mind of the answerer contains the secret object. The mind of the questioner 
is where all the weighing of the previous answers is going on, and the conversation 
space between them is how they exchange information. Every game has some kind

of information or “state” (as we’ll see later in Mechanic 2), and this has to exist 
somewhere. So, even if a game takes place in a single point of zero dimensions, it 
can be useful to think of it as a space. You may find that figuring out an abstract 
model for a game whose space seems to be trivial may lead you to insights about it 
that surprise you.
Being able to think about the space of your game in functional abstract terms is 
an essential perspective for a designer, and it is Lens #26.
When thinking about game spaces, it is easy to be swayed by aesthetics. There 
are many ways to represent your game space, and they are all good, as long as 
they work for you. When you can think of your space in these pure abstract terms, 
it helps you let go of assumptions about the real world, and it lets you focus on 
the kinds of gameplay interactions you would like to see. Of course, once you 
have manipulated the abstract space so that you are happy with its layout, you 
will want to apply aesthetics to it. The Lens of Functional Space works quite well 
with Lens #10, Holographic Design. If you can simultaneously see your abstract 
functional space and the aesthetic space the player will experience, as well as 
how they interrelate, you can make confident decisions about the shape of your 
game’s world.
Mechanic 2: Time
In the real world, time is the most mysterious of dimensions. Against our will, we 
travel through it, ever forward, with no way to stop, turn around, slow down, or 
speed up. In the world of games, we often try to remedy this lack of control by creat­
ing toy worlds that let us play with time like gods.
Lens #26: The Lens of Functional Space
To use this lens, think about the space in which your game really takes place 
when all surface elements are stripped away.
Ask yourself these questions:
●
●
Is the space of this game discrete or continuous?
●
●
How many dimensions does it have?
●
●
What are the boundaries of the space?
●
●
Are there subspaces? How are they connected?
●
●
Is there more than one useful way to abstractly model the space of this 
game?

164
CHAPTER Twelve • SOME ELEMENTS ARE GAME MECHANICS
Discrete and Continuous Time
Just as space in games can be discrete or continuous, so can time. We have a word 
for the unit of discrete time in a game: the “turn.” Generally, in turn-based games, 
time matters little. Each turn counts as a discrete unit of time, and the time between 
turns, as far as the game is concerned, doesn’t exist. Scrabble games, for example, 
are generally recorded as a series of moves, with no record of the amount of time 
that each move took, because real clock time is irrelevant to the game mechanics.
Of course, there are many games that are not turn based, but instead operate 
in continuous time. Most action videogames are this way, as are most sports. And 
some games use a mix of time systems. Tournament chess is turn-based but has a 
continuous clock to place time limits on each player.
Clocks and Races
Clocks of varying types are used in many games, to set absolute time limits for all 
kinds of things. The “sand timer” used in Boggle, the game clock in American foot­
ball, and even the duration of Mario’s jump in Donkey Kong are different kinds of 
“clock” mechanisms, designed to limit gameplay through absolute measure of time. 
Just as there can be nested spaces, sometimes time is nested, as well. Basketball, for 
instance, is often played with a game clock to limit the length of total play but also 
with a much shorter “shot clock” to help ensure players take more risks, keeping 
the gameplay interesting.
Other measures of time are more relative—we usually refer to these as “races.” 
In the case of a race, there is not a fixed time limit, but rather pressure to be faster 
than another player. Sometimes this is very obvious, like in an auto race, but other 
races are more subtle, such as my race in Space Invaders to destroy all the invading 
aliens before they manage to touch the ground.
There are many games, of course, where time is not a limiting factor, but it is still 
a meaningful factor. In baseball, for example, innings are not timed, but if the game 
goes on too long, it can exhaust the pitcher, making time an important part of the 
game. In Chapter 13, “Balance,” we will talk about different game factors that can 
control how long a game takes to play.
Controlling Time
Games give us the chance to do something we can never do in the real world: con­
trol time. This happens in a number of fascinating ways. Sometimes we stop time 
completely, as when a “time-out” is called in sporting match or when the “pause” 
button is pushed on a videogame. Occasionally, we speed up time, as happens in 
games like Civilization, so that we can see years pass in just seconds. But most 
often, we rewind time, which is what happens every time you die in a videogame 

165
Mechanic 3: Objects, Attributes, and States
and return to a previous checkpoint. Some games, such as Braid, go so far as to 
make manipulation of game time a central mechanic.
Since time is invisible and unstoppable, it is easy to forget. Take this lens to help 
you remember.
Mechanic 3: Objects, Attributes, and States
A space without anything in it is, well, just a space. Your game space will surely 
have objects in it. Characters, props, tokens, scoreboards, or anything that can be 
seen or manipulated in your game falls into this category. Objects are the “nouns” 
of game mechanics. Technically, there are times you might consider the space itself 
an object, but usually the space of your game is different enough from other objects 
that it stands apart. Objects generally have one or more attributes, one of which is 
often the current position in the game space.
Attributes are categories of information about an object. For example, in a rac­
ing game, a car might have maximum speed and current speed as attributes. Each 
attribute has a current state. The state of the “maximum speed” attribute might be 
150 mph, while the state of the “current speed” attribute might be 75 mph if that 
is how fast the car is going. Maximum speed is not a state that will change much, 
unless perhaps you upgrade the engine in your car. Current speed, on the other 
hand, changes constantly as you play.
Lens #27: The Lens of Time
It is said that “timing is everything.” Our goal as designers is to create experi­
ences, and experiences are easily spoiled when they are too short or too long, 
too fast or too slow. Ask these questions to make yours just the right length:
●
●
What is it that determines the length of my gameplay activities?
●
●
Are my players frustrated because the game ends too early? How can I 
change that?
●
●
Are my players bored because the game goes on too long? How can I change 
that?
●
●
Would clocks or races make my gameplay more exciting?
●
●
Time limits can irritate players. Would I better off without time limits?
●
●
Would a hierarchy of time structures help my game? That is, several short 
rounds that together comprise a larger round?
Timing can be very difficult to get right, but it can make or break a game. Often, 
it makes sense to follow the old vaudevillian adage “Leave’em wanting more.”

166
CHAPTER Twelve • SOME ELEMENTS ARE GAME MECHANICS
If objects are the nouns of game mechanics, attributes and their states are the 
adjectives.
Attributes can be static (such as the color of a checker), never changing through­
out the game, or dynamic (the checker has a “movement mode” attribute with three 
possible states: “normal,” “king,” and “captured”). Primarily, we are interested in 
dynamic attributes.
The following are two more examples:
	1.	 In chess, the king has a “movement mode” attribute with three important states 
(“free to move,” “in check,” and “checkmated.”)
	2.	 In Monopoly, each property on the board can be considered an object with a 
dynamic “number of houses” attribute with six states (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, hotel) and a 
“mortgaged” attribute with two states (yes, no).
Is it important to communicate every state change to the player? Not necessarily. 
Some state changes are better hidden. But for others, it is crucial to be sure they are 
communicated to the player. A good rule of thumb is that if two objects behave the 
same way, they should look the same. If they behave differently, they should look 
different.
Videogame objects, especially ones that simulate intelligent characters, have 
so many attributes and states that it is easy for a designer to get confused. It is 
often useful to construct a state diagram for each attribute to make sure you 
understand which states are connected to which and what triggers state changes. 
In terms of game programming, implementing the state of an attribute as a “state 
machine” can be a very useful way to keep all this complexity tidy and easy to 
debug. Figure 12.12 is a sample state diagram for the “movement” attribute of 
the ghosts in Pac Man.

Mechanic 3: Objects, Attributes, and States
The circle that reads “In Cage” is the initial state for the ghosts (double circle is 
often used to indicate the start state). Each of the arrows indicates a possible state 
transition, with an event that triggers that transition. Diagrams like these are very 
useful when trying to design complex behaviors in a game. They force you to really 
think through everything that can happen to an object and what makes it happen. 
By implementing these state transitions in computer code, you automatically forbid 
illegal transitions (such as “In Cage” → “Blue”), which helps cut down on puzzling 
bugs. These diagrams can get quite complicated and are sometimes nested. For 
example, it is quite likely that the real Pac-Man algorithm actually has several sub­
states in “Chasing Pac Man,” such as “Scanning for Pac-Man,” “On Pac-Man’s Tail,” 
and “Moving through a Tunnel.”
Deciding which objects have what attributes and what states is up to you. There 
are often multiple ways to represent the same thing. In a game of poker, for exam­
ple, you could define a player’s hand as an area of the game space that has five card 
objects in it, or you could decide you don’t want to think of cards as objects and 
just call the player’s hand an object that has five different card attributes. As with 
everything in game design, the “right” way to think about something is whichever 
way is most useful at the moment.
Games that force the players to be aware of too many states (too many game 
pieces, too many statistics about each character) to play can confuse and over­
whelm. In Chapter 13, “Balance,” we’ll discuss techniques for optimizing the 
amount of state the players have to deal with. Thinking of your game strictly as a 
set of objects and attributes with changing states can give a very useful perspective, 
and it serves as Lens #28.
Lens #28: The Lens of the State Machine
To use this lens, think about what information changes during your game.
Ask yourself these questions:
●
●
What are the objects in my game?
●
●
What are the attributes of the objects?
●
●
What are the possible states for each attribute?
●
●
What triggers the state changes for each attribute?
Gameplaying is decision making. Decisions are made based on information. 
Deciding the different attributes, their states, and what changes them is core 
to the mechanics of your game.

168
CHAPTER Twelve • SOME ELEMENTS ARE GAME MECHANICS
Secrets
A very important decision about game attributes and their states is who is aware 
of which ones. In many board games, all information is public; that is, everyone 
knows it. In a game of chess, both players can see every piece on the board and 
every piece that has been captured—there are no secrets, except what the other 
player is thinking. In card games, hidden or private state is a big part of the game. 
You know what cards you hold, but which ones your opponents hold is a mystery 
for you to puzzle out. The game of poker, for example, is largely about trying to 
guess what cards your opponents have while attempting to conceal information 
about what cards you might have. Games become dramatically different when you 
change what information is public or private. In standard “draw poker,” all states 
are private—players can only guess your hand based on how much you bet. In “stud 
poker,” some of your cards are private and some are public. This gives opponents 
much more information about each other’s situations, and the game feels very dif­
ferent. Board games such as Battleship and Stratego are all about guessing the states 
of your opponent’s private attributes.
In videogames, we face something new: a state that only the game itself knows 
about. This raises a question about whether virtual opponents, from a game 
mechanics standpoint, should be thought of as players or just part of the game. This 
is well illustrated by a story: In 1980, my grandfather bought an Intellivision game 
console, which came with a “Las Vegas Poker and Blackjack” game cartridge. He 
had great fun with it, but my grandmother refused to play. “It cheats,” she insisted. 
I told her that was silly—it was just a computer—how could it cheat? She explained 
her reasoning: “It knows what all my cards are, and all the cards in the deck! How 
can it not cheat?” And I had to admit that my explanation that the computer “doesn’t 
look at those” when it is making decisions about playing the game sounded kind of 
weak. But it brings out the point that there were really three entities in that game 
who knew the states of different attributes: my grandfather, who was aware of the 
state of his hand; the virtual opponent algorithm, which was “aware” of the state 
of its hand; and lastly the main algorithm for the game, which was aware of both 
players’ hands, every card in the deck, and everything else about the game.
So, it seems that from a public/private attribute point of view, it makes sense 
to consider virtual opponents as individual entities on par with players. The game 
itself, though, is yet another entity, with a special status, since it isn’t really playing 
the game, although it may be making decisions that enable the game to happen. 
Celia Pearce points out another kind of information, which is private from all of 
the entities we have mentioned so far: randomly generated information, such as a 
die roll. Depending on your views about predestination, you might argue that this 
information doesn’t even exist until it is generated and revealed, so that referring to 
it as private is a little silly. But it does fit well into a Venn diagram I call the “hierar­
chy of knowers,” which helps to visualize the relationship between the public and 
private states:

Each circle in Figure 12.13 represents a “knower.” The “knowers” are god, the 
game, and players 1, 2, and 3. Each point represents some information in the game—
the state of an attribute:
●
●
A is information that is completely public, such as the position playing piece on 
a game board, or a face-up card. All the players are aware of it.
●
●
B is the state that is shared between players 2 and 3 but kept secret from player 1. 
Perhaps 2 and 3 each had the opportunity to look at a face-down card, but player 
1 didn’t. Or maybe players 2 and 3 are virtual opponents of player 1, and their 
algorithm has them sharing information so they can team up against player 1.
●
●
C is information private to a single player, in this case player 2. It could be cards 
he was dealt, for example.
●
●
D is information that the game knows about, but not the players themselves. 
There are some mechanical board games where this kind of state exists in the 
physical structure of the board game, but is unknown to the players. Stay Alive 
was a classic example, with plastic sliders that when moved revealed holes in 
the board. Touché is another interesting example, where magnets of unknown 
polarity are placed under each square of the board. The states are “known” 
by the game, but not by the players. Another example is tabletop role-playing 
games, which feature a “dungeon master,” or “game master,” who is not one of 
the players and who privately knows a great deal of the game state, since he is 
the operational mechanism of the game, so to speak. Most computer games have 
a great deal of internal state that is not known to the players.
●
●
E is randomly generated information, known only by the fates, god, etc.
Secrets are power. Lens #29 will help you channel that power to make your game 
as interesting as it can be. Take it, but don’t tell anyone.

CHAPTER Twelve • SOME ELEMENTS ARE GAME MECHANICS
Mechanic 4: Actions
The next important game mechanic is the action. Actions are the “verbs” of game 
mechanics. There are two perspectives on actions or, put another way, two ways to 
answer the question “What can the players do?”
The first kind of action is the basic action. These are simply the base actions 
a player can take. For example, in checkers, a player can perform only three basic 
operations:
	1.	 Move a checker forward.
	2.	 Jump an opponent’s checker.
	3.	 Move a checker backwards (kings only).
The second kind of action is strategic action. These are actions that are only 
meaningful in the larger picture of the game—they have to do with how the player is 
Lens #29: The Lens of Secrets
Change who has what information, and you change your game completely. 
To use this lens, think about who knows what and why.
Ask yourself these questions:
●
●
What is known by the game only?
●
●
What is known by all players?
●
●
What is known by some or only one player?
●
●
Would changing who knows what information improve my game in some 
way?
Gameplaying is decision making. Decisions are made based on information. 
Deciding the different attributes, their states, and who knows about them is 
core to the mechanics of your game. Small changes to who knows what infor­
mation can radically change a game, sometimes for the better, sometimes for 
the worse. Who knows about what attributes can even change over the course 
of a game—a great way to create drama in your game is to make an important 
piece of private information suddenly become public.

171
Mechanic 4: Actions
using basic actions to achieve a goal. The list of strategic actions is generally longer 
than the list of basic actions. Consider some possible strategic actions in checkers:
●
●
Protect a checker from being captured by moving another checker behind it.
●
●
Force an opponent into making an unwanted jump.
●
●
Sacrifice a checker to trick his opponent.
●
●
Build a “bridge” to protect his back row.
●
●
Move a checker into the “king row” to make it a king.
Emergent Gameplay
The strategic actions often involve subtle interactions within the game and are often 
very strategic moves. These actions are mostly not part of the rules, per se, but 
rather actions and strategies that emerge naturally as the game is played. Most 
game designers agree that interesting emergent actions are the hallmark of a good 
game. Consequently, the ratio of meaningful strategic actions to basic actions is a 
good measure of how much emergent behavior your game features. It is an elegant 
game indeed that allows a player a small number of basic actions but a large num­
ber of strategic actions. It should be noted that this is a somewhat subjective mea­
sure, since the number of “meaningful” strategic actions is a matter of opinion.
Trying to create “emergent gameplay,” that is, interesting strategic actions, has 
been likened to tending a garden, since what emerges has a life of its own, but at 
the same time, it is fragile and easily destroyed. When you notice some interesting 
strategic actions showing up in your game, you must be able to recognize them and 
then do what you can to nurture them and give them a chance to flourish. But what 
makes these things spring up in the first place? It is not just luck—there are things 
you can do to increase the chances of interesting strategic actions appearing. Here 
are five tips for preparing the soil of your game and planting seeds of emergence.
	1.	 Add more verbs: That is, add more basic actions. The strategic actions appear 
when basic actions interact with each other, with objects, and with the game 
space. When you add more basic actions, there are more opportunities for inter­
action and thus emergence. A game where you can run, jump, shoot, buy, sell, 
drive, and build is going to have a lot more potential for emergence than a game 
where you can just run and jump. Be careful, though—adding too many basic 
actions, especially ones that don’t interact with each other well, can lead to a 
game that is bloated, confusing, and inelegant. Keep in mind that the ratio 
of strategic actions to basic actions is more important than the sheer number 
of basic actions. It is usually better to add one good basic action than a slew of 
mediocre ones.

172
CHAPTER Twelve • SOME ELEMENTS ARE GAME MECHANICS
	2.	 Verbs that can act on many objects: This is possibly the single most powerful 
thing you can do to make an elegant, interesting game. If you give a player a gun 
that can only shoot bad guys, you have a very simple game. But if that same gun 
can also be used to shoot a lock off a door, break a window, hunt for food, pop 
a car tire, or write messages on the wall, you now start to enter a world of many 
possibilities. You still only have one basic action: “shoot,” but by increasing the 
number of things you can usefully shoot at, the number of meaningful strategic 
actions increases as well.
	3.	 Goals that can be achieved more than one way: It’s great to let players do all 
kinds of different things in your game, giving them lots of verbs, and verbs 
with lots of objects. But if the goals can only be achieved one way, players 
have no reason to look for unusual interactions and interesting strategies. To 
follow up with the “shoot” example, if you let players shoot all kinds of things, 
but the goal of your game is just “shoot the boss monster,” the players will 
only do that. On the other hand, if you can shoot the monster, or shoot out a 
support chain so a chandelier could crash down on him, or maybe even not 
shoot him at all, but stop him through some nonviolent means, you will have 
a rich, dynamic gameplay, where lots of things are possible. The challenge 
with this approach is that the game becomes hard to balance, for if one of the 
options is always significantly easier than the others (a dominant strategy), play­
ers will always pursue that option. We will discuss that further in Chapter 13, 
“Balance.”
	4.	 Many subjects: If checkers involved just one red checker and one black one but 
had the same rules, the game would not be interesting at all. It is because the 
players have many different pieces they can move, pieces that can interact with 
one another, coordinating and sacrificing, that the game becomes interesting. 
This method obviously doesn’t work for all games, but it can work in some sur­
prising places. The number of strategic actions seems to have roughly a magni­
tude of subjects times verbs times objects, so adding more subjects is very likely 
to increase the number of strategic actions.
	5.	 Side effects that change constraints: If every time you take an action, it 
has side effects that change the constraints on you or your opponent, very 
interesting gameplay is likely to result. Let us again look to checkers. Every 
time you move a piece, you not only change the squares that you threaten 
with capture, but you simultaneously change which squares your opponent 
(and you) can move into. In a sense, every move changes the very nature 
of the game space, whether or not you intended it to. Think how different 
checkers would be if multiple pieces could peacefully cohabitate on a single 
square. By forcing multiple aspects of the game to change with every basic 
action, you are very likely to cause interesting strategic actions to suddenly 
appear.

173
Mechanic 4: Actions
When comparing games with books and films, one of the most striking differ­
ences is the number of verbs. Games usually limit players to a very narrow range 
of potential actions, while in stories the number of possible actions that characters 
can engage in seems nearly limitless. This is a natural side effect of the fact that in 
games, the actions and all their effects must be simulated on the fly, while in stories 
it is all worked out ahead of time. In Chapter 18, “Indirect Control,” we will discuss 
how this “action gap” can be bridged in the mind of the player, so that you can give 
the feeling of limitless possibilities while keeping the number of basic actions at a 
manageable limit.
The reason so many games seem similar to one another is because they use the 
same set of actions. Look at the games that are considered “derivative,” and you 
will see that they have the same set of actions as older games. Look at games that 
people call “innovative,” and you will find that they give the players new kinds 
of actions, either basic or strategic. When Donkey Kong first appeared, it seemed 
very different because it was about running and jumping, which was new at the 
time. Harvest Moon was a game about farming. Katamari Damacy was about roll­
ing a sticky ball. The actions a player can take are so crucial to defining a game’s 
mechanics that changing a single action can give you a completely different game.
Some designers dream of games where any verb the player can think of is a 
possible action, and this is a beautiful dream. Some massively multiplayer games 
are starting to move in that direction, offering a wide range of verbs for combat, 
crafting, and social interaction. In a way, this is a return to the past—in the 1970s 
and 1980s, text adventures were very popular typically featuring dozens or hun­
dreds of possible verbs. Only with the rise of more visual games did the number 
of verbs suddenly decrease, because it was not feasible to support all those actions 
in a visual-based game. The demise (or hibernation?) of the text adventure genre 
is usually attributed to the public’s hunger for fancy visuals—but perhaps, from 
an action perspective, there is another explanation. Modern 3D videogames give 
Lens #30: The Lens of Emergence
To make sure your game has interesting qualities of emergence, ask yourself 
these questions:
●
●
How many verbs do my players have?
●
●
How many objects can each verb act on?
●
●
How many ways can players achieve their goals?
●
●
How many subjects do the players control?
●
●
How do side effects change constraints?

174
CHAPTER Twelve • SOME ELEMENTS ARE GAME MECHANICS
you a very limited range of basic actions. The player generally knows every action 
they can possibly attempt. In text adventures, the complete set of basic actions 
was unclear, and discovering them was part of the game. Very often, the solution 
to a tricky puzzle was thinking to type an unusual verb, like “spin the fish” or 
“tickle the monkey.” While this was all very creative, it was also often frustrat­
ing—for every one of the hundreds of verbs a game supported, there were thou­
sands it did not. As a result, players did not really have the “complete freedom” 
that text adventure interfaces pretended to give them. It is possible that this frus­
tration, more than anything else, caused text adventures to fall from favor.
Your choice of actions significantly defines your game structure, so let’s make 
that Lens #31.
Mechanic 5: Rules
The rules are really the most fundamental mechanic. They define the space, the 
timing, the objects, the actions, the consequences of the actions, the constraints on 
the actions, and the goals. In other words, they make possible all the mechanics we 
have seen so far and add the crucial thing that makes a game a game—goals.
Lens #31: The Lens of Action
To use this lens, think about what your players can do and what they can’t 
and why.
Ask yourself these questions:
●
●
What are the basic actions in my game?
●
●
What are the strategic actions?
●
●
What strategic actions would I like to see? How can I change my game in 
order to make those possible?
●
●
Am I happy with the ratio of strategic to basic actions?
●
●
What actions do players wish they could do in my game that they cannot? 
Can I somehow enable these, either as basic or strategic actions?
A game without actions is like a sentence without verbs—nothing happens. 
Deciding the actions in your game will be the most fundamental decision 
you can make as a game designer. Tiny changes to these actions will have 
tremendous ripple effects with the possibility of either creating marvelous 
emergent gameplay or making a game that is predictable and tedious. Choose 
your actions carefully, and learn to listen to your game and your players to 
learn what is made possible by your choices.

175
Mechanic 5: Rules
Parlett’s Rule Analysis
David Parlett, game historian, did a very good job of analyzing the different kinds 
of rules that are involved with gameplay, as shown in this diagram.
This shows the relationships between all the kinds of rules we are likely to 
encounter, so let’s consider each.
	1.	 Operational rules: These are the easiest to understand. These are basically 
“What the players do to play the game.” When players understand the opera­
tional rules, they can play a game.
	2.	 Foundational rules: The foundational rules are the underlying formal structure 
of the game. The operational rules might say “The player should roll a six-sided 
die, and collect that many power chips.” The foundational rules would be more 
abstract: “The player’s power value is increased by a random number from 
1 to 6.” Foundational rules are a mathematical representation of game state and 
how and when it changes. Boards, dice, chips, health meters, etc., are all just 
operational ways of keeping track of the foundational game state. As Parlett’s 
diagram shows, foundational rules inform operational rules. There is not yet 
any standard notation for representing these rules, and there is some question 
about whether a complete notation is even possible. In real life, game designers 
learn to see the foundational rules on an as-needed basis, but seldom do they 
have any need to formally document the entire set of foundational rules in a 
completely abstract way.

CHAPTER Twelve • SOME ELEMENTS ARE GAME MECHANICS
	3.	 Behavioral rules: These are rules that are implicit to gameplay, which most 
people naturally understand as part of “good sportsmanship.” For example, dur­
ing a game of chess, one should not tickle the other player while they are trying 
to think or take five hours to make a move. These are seldom stated explicitly—
mostly, everyone knows them. The fact that they exist underlines the point that 
a game is a kind of social contract between players. These, too, inform the opera­
tional rules. Steven Sniderman has written an excellent essay about behavioral 
rules called “Unwritten Rules.”
	4.	 Written rules: These are the “rules that come with the game,” the document that 
players have to read to gain an understanding of the operational rules. Of course, 
in reality, only a small number of people read this document—most people learn 
a game by having someone else explain how to play. Why? It is very hard to 
encode the nonlinear intricacies of how to play a game into a document and 
similarly hard to decode such a document. Modern videogames have gradually 
been doing away with written rules in favor of having the game itself teach play­
ers how to play through interactive tutorials. This hands-on approach is far more 
effective, though it can be challenging and time consuming to design and imple­
ment as it involves many iterations that cannot be completed until the game is 
in its final state. Every game designer must have a ready answer to the question: 
“How will players learn to play my game?” Because if someone can’t figure out 
your game, they will not play it.
	5.	 Laws: These are only formed when games are played in serious, competitive 
settings, where the stakes are high enough that a need is felt to explicitly record 
the rules of good sportsmanship or where there is need to clarify or modify the 
official written rules. These are often called “tournament rules,” since during a 
serious tournament is when there is the most need for this kind of official clari­
fication. Consider these tournament rules for playing Tekken 5 (a fighting game) 
at the 2005 Penny Arcade Expo:
	
a.	 Single elimination.
	
b.	 You may bring your own controller.
	
c.	 Standard VS mode.
	
d.	 100% health.
	
e.	 Random stage select.
	
f.	 60 second timer.
	
g.	 Best 3 of 5 rounds.
	
h.	 Best 2 of 3 games.
	
i.	 Mokujin is banned.
	 	 Most of these are just clarifying exactly which game settings will be used in 
the tournament. “You may bring your own controller” is a formalized decision 
about what is “fair play.” The most interesting rule here is “Mokujin is banned.” 

177
Mechanic 5: Rules
Mokujin is one of the characters you can choose to play in Tekken 5. The general 
feeling among players is that Mokujin’s “stun” move is so powerful that any 
player who chooses to play Mokujin is likely to win the game, making a tourna­
ment pointless. So this “law” is an attempt to improve the game, ensuring the 
tournament is balanced, fair, and fun.
	6.	 Official rules: These are created when a game is played seriously enough that a 
group of players feels a need to merge the written rules with the laws. Over time, 
these official rules later become the written rules. In chess, when a player makes 
a move that puts the opponent’s king in danger of checkmate, that player is obli­
gated to warn the opponent by saying “check.” At one time, this was a “law,” not 
a written rule, but now it is part of the “official rules.”
	7.	 Advisory rules: Often called “rules of strategy,” these are just tips to help you 
play better, and not really “rules” at all from a game mechanics standpoint.
	8.	 House rules: These rules are not explicitly described by Parlett, but he does point 
out that as players play a game, they may find they want to tune the operational 
rules to make the game more fun. This is the “feedback” on his diagram, since 
house rules are usually created by players in response to a deficiency perceived 
after a few rounds of play.
Modes
Many games have very different rules during different parts of play. The rules often 
change completely from mode to mode, almost like completely separate games. One 
memorable instance was the racing game Pitstop. Most of the time, it was a typical 
racing game but with a twist—if you didn’t pull over to change your tires periodi­
cally, they would burst. When you did pull over, the game changed completely—
now you were not racing your car, but rather racing to change your tires, with a 
completely different game interface. When your game changes modes in a dramatic 
way like this, it is very important that you let your players know which mode you 
are in. Too many modes and the players can get confused. Very often, there is one 
main mode, with several submodes, which is a good hierarchical way to organize 
the different modes. Game designer Sid Meier proposes an excellent rule of thumb: 
players should never spend so much time in a subgame that they forget what they 
were doing in the main game.
Enforcer
One of the most significant differences between videogames and more traditional 
games is how the rules are enforced. In traditional games, rules are primarily 
enforced by the players themselves or by an impartial referee in high-stakes games, 
such as sporting events. With computer games, it becomes possible (and sometimes 

178
CHAPTER Twelve • SOME ELEMENTS ARE GAME MECHANICS
necessary) for the computer to enforce the rules. This is more than a convenience—
it allows for the creation of games much more complex than was traditionally 
possible, because now the players don’t have to memorize all the rules about what 
is and is not possible—they just try things in the game, and see what works and 
what doesn’t work—they don’t have to memorize it all, or look it up. In a sense, 
what used to be a “rule” now becomes a physical constraint of the game world. If a 
piece isn’t allowed to move a certain way, it simply doesn’t move that way. Many of 
the game rules are enforced by the design of the space, the objects, and the actions. 
A game like Warcraft could conceivably be a board game, but there would be so 
many rules to remember and state to keep track of that it would quickly become a 
dreary experience. By offloading the dull work of rules enforcement onto the com­
puter, games can reach depths of complexity, subtlety, and richness that are not pos­
sible any other way. But proceed with caution—if the rules of your videogame are so 
complex that a player can’t even form a rough idea of how the game works, they will 
be overwhelmed and confused. You must make the rules of a complex videogame 
something that players can discover and understand naturally—not something they 
have to memorize.
Cheatability
The reason games need an enforcer is to prevent cheating. Violating the rules is bad 
gamesmanship, certainly, but as we’ve seen throughout history, some players will 
stop at nothing to be perceived as the winner. Obviously, when you play a game, 
you want to make sure others don’t cheat. But cheating has a more insidious effect 
than that—if players start believing your game is cheatable, even if it isn’t, all the 
precious endogenous value you have worked to develop just slips away. Players 
imagine themselves working hard to win and imagine another player cheating, and 
it makes them feel like chumps. That is the danger of cheatability—if players feel 
like your game can be cheated, some will try to cheat, but most will just no longer 
want to play.
The Most Important Rule
Games have a lot of rules—how to move and what you can and cannot do—but 
there is one rule at the foundation of all the others: the object of the game. Games 
are about achieving goals—you must be able to state your game’s goal and state it 
clearly. Often, there is not just one goal in a game, but a sequence of them—you 
will need to state each and how they relate to one another. A clumsy statement of 
your game’s goal can be off-putting to players right from the beginning—if they 
don’t completely understand the purpose of their actions, they cannot proceed 

179
Mechanic 5: Rules
with any certainty. Newcomers to chess are often stymied when someone awk­
wardly tries to explain the object of the game: “Your goal is to put the other king 
in checkmate… that means you move your pieces so he can’t move without being 
in check… which, uh, means that one of your pieces could potentially capture 
him, except that, um, it’s against the rules to capture the king.” As a boy, I often 
wondered why a game considered to be so elegant could have such an inelegant 
goal. I played the game for years before I realized that the goal of chess is actu­
ally quite simple: “Capture your opponent’s king.” All the folderol about check 
and checkmate is simply there to politely warn your opponent that they are in 
imminent danger. It is remarkable how more interested a potential chess player 
becomes when you tell them that simple four-word goal. The same is true for any 
game you create—the more easily players understand the goal, the more easily 
they can visualize achieving it, and the more likely they are going to want to play 
your game.
When a goal is set in a player’s mind, it gives them tremendous motivation to see 
it through. Having a clear set of well-constructed goals or quests is crucial to keep­
ing your players engaged and motivated. Good game goals are as follows:
	1.	 Concrete: Players understand and can clearly state what they are supposed to 
achieve.
	2.	 Achievable: Players need to think that they have a chance of achieving the goal. 
If it seems impossible to them, they will quickly give up.
	3.	 Rewarding: A lot goes into making an achieved goal rewarding. If the goal has 
the right level of challenge, just achieving it at all is a reward in itself. But why 
not go further? You can make your goal even more rewarding by giving the 
player something valuable upon reaching the goal—use Lens #20, Pleasure, to 
find different ways to reward the player and really make them proud of their 
achievement. And while it is important to reward players that achieve a goal, it 
is equally (or more) important that players appreciate that the goal is rewarding 
before they have achieved it, so that they are inspired to attempt to achieve it. 
Don’t overinflate their expectations, though, for if they are disappointed with the 
reward for achieving a goal, they will not play again! We will talk much more 
about rewards in the next chapter.
And while it is important that each of the goals in your game has these qualities, 
it is also important that you have a good balance of goals in your game, with some 
short-term and some much longer term. This balance of goals will make your play­
ers feel they know what to do immediately and that ultimately they will achieve 
something important and magnificent.
It is easy to focus so much on the action of a game that you forget about the goals. 
To help us remember the importance of goals, let’s add this lens to our toolbox.

180
CHAPTER Twelve • SOME ELEMENTS ARE GAME MECHANICS
It can be fascinating to pick up the Lens of the Toy, the Lens of Curiosity, and 
the Lens of Goals at the same time to see how these aspects of your game influence 
each other.
Wrapping Up Rules
Rules are the most fundamental of all game mechanics. A game is not just defined 
by its rules; a game is its rules. It is important to view your game from a rules per­
spective, and that is Lens #33.
Lens #33: The Lens of Rules
To use this lens, look deep into your game, until you can make out its most 
basic structure. Ask yourself these questions:
●
●
What are the foundational rules of my game? How do these differ from the 
operational rules?
●
●
Are there “laws” or “house rules” that are forming as the game develops? 
Should these be incorporated into my game directly?
●
●
Are there different modes in my game? Do these modes make things sim­
pler, or more complex? Would the game be better with fewer modes? More 
modes?
Lens #32: The Lens of Goals
To ensure the goals of your game are appropriate and well balanced, ask your­
self these questions:
●
●
What is the ultimate goal of my game?
●
●
Is that goal clear to players?
●
●
If there is a series of goals, do the players understand that?
●
●
Are the different goals related to each other in a meaningful way?
●
●
Are my goals concrete, achievable, and rewarding?
●
●
Do I have a good balance of short- and long-term goals?
●
●
Do players have a chance to decide on their own goals?

181
Mechanic 6: Skill
Mechanic 6: Skill
In virtute sunt multi ascensus.
(There are many degrees in excellence.)
—Cicero
The mechanic of skill shifts the focus away from the game and onto the player. 
Every game requires players to exercise certain skills. If the player’s skill level is a 
good match to the game’s difficulty, the player will feel challenged and stay in the 
flow channel (as discussed in Chapter 10, “Player’s Mind”).
Most games do not just require one skill from a player—they require a blend of 
different skills. When you design a game, it is a worthwhile exercise to make a list 
of the skills that your game requires from the player. Even though there are thou­
sands of possible skills that can go into a game, skills can generally be divided into 
three main categories:
	1.	 Physical skills: These include skills involving strength, dexterity, coordination, 
and physical endurance. Physical skills are an important part of most sports. 
Effectively manipulating a game controller is a kind of physical skill, but many 
videogames (such as camera-based dance games) require a broader range of 
physical skills from players.
	2.	 Mental skills: These include the skills of memory, observation, and puzzle solv­
ing. Although some people shy away from games that require too much in the

Are the rules easy to understand, or is there confusion about them? If there 
is confusion, should I fix it by changing the rules or by explaining them 
more clearly?
There is a common misconception that designers make games by sitting down 
and writing a set of rules. This usually isn’t how it happens at all. A game’s 
rules are arrived at gradually and experimentally. The designer’s mind gen­
erally works in the domain of “operational rules,” occasionally switching to 
the perspective of “foundational rules” when thinking about how to change 
or improve the game. The “written rules” usually come toward the end, once 
the game is playable. Part of the designer’s job is to make sure there are rules 
that cover every circumstance. Be sure to take careful notes as you playtest, 
because it is during these tests that holes in your rules will appear—if you 
just patch them quickly and don’t make a note, the same hole will just show 
up again later. A game is its rules—give them the time and consideration that 
they deserve.

way of mental skills, it is the rare game that doesn’t involve some mental skills, 
because games are interesting when there are interesting decisions to make, and 
decision making is a mental skill.
	3.	 Social skills: These include, among other things, reading an opponent (guessing 
what he is thinking), fooling an opponent, and coordinating with teammates. 
Typically, we think of social skills in terms of your ability to make friends and 
influence people, but the range of social and communication skills in games is 
much wider. Poker is largely a social game, because so much of it rests on con­
cealing your thoughts and guessing the thoughts of others. Sports are very social, 
as well, with their focus on teamwork and on “psyching out” your opponents.
Real vs. Virtual Skills
It is important to draw a distinction here: When we talk about skill as a game 
mechanic, we are talking about a real skill the player must have. In videogames, 
it is common to talk about your character’s skill level. You might hear a player 
announce “My warrior just gained two points on his sword fighting skill!” But 
“sword fighting” is not a real skill required of the player—the player is really just 
pushing the right buttons on the control pad at the right time. Sword fighting, in 
this context, is a virtual skill—one that the player is pretending to have. The inter­
esting thing about virtual skills is that they can improve even though the player’s 
actual skill does not. The player might be just as sloppy at mashing the controller 
buttons as he ever was, but by mashing them enough times, he might be rewarded 
with a higher level of virtual skill, which allows his character to become a faster, 
more powerful swordfighter. Many “free-to-play” games have a whole monetization 
strategy based on the purchase of virtual skills.
Virtual skills are a great way to give a player a feeling of power. Taken too far, it 
can feel hollow—some critics of massively multiplayer games complain that there is 
too much emphasis on virtual skills, and not enough on real skills. Often, the key to 
a fun game is finding the right mix of real and virtual skills. Many novice designers 
confuse the two—it is important that you draw a clear distinction between them in 
your mind.
Enumerating Skills
Making a list of all the skills required in your game can be a very useful exercise. 
You might make a general list: “my game requires memory, problem solving, and 
pattern matching skills.” Or you might make it very specific: “my game requires 
players to quickly identify and mentally rotate specific two-dimensional shapes in 
their heads, while solving a grid-based packing problem.” Listing skills can be very 
tricky—one interesting example comes from the game RC Pro Am, a racing game for 
the NES. In it, players steer the car with the joypad (left thumb), accelerate with the 

183
Mechanic 6: Skill
A button (right thumb), and fire weapons at opponents with the B button (also right 
thumb). To master this game, two surprising skills were required—the first was 
problem solving. Generally on NES games, you only push one button at a time—you 
take your thumb off the A button when you want to push the B button. But in RC 
Pro Am, this is disastrous—it means that if you want to fire a rocket (the B button), 
you have to release the car’s accelerator (the A button), and your opponent quickly 
speeds away! How to solve this problem? Some players try using a thumb for one 
button and finger for the other, but this is awkward and makes the game too hard to 
play. The best solution seems to involve a new grip on the controller: you hold your 
thumb sideways on the A button, so that when you want to occasionally push the B 
button, you can roll it down onto the B button smoothly, without releasing the accel­
erator. Once the player has solved this problem, they then need to practice this very 
specific physical skill. And of course, there are many other skills involved in the 
game—managing resources (missiles and mines, so you don’t run out), memoriz­
ing race courses, reacting to sharp turns and unexpected road hazards, and many 
more. The point is that even a game that seems somewhat simple might require 
many different skills from a player. As a designer, you need to know what these are.
It is easy to fool yourself into thinking your game is about one skill, when other 
skills are actually more important. Many action-based videogames seem, on the 
surface, to be mainly about quickly reacting to opponents, when in truth there is 
a lot of puzzle solving required to figure out the right way to react to them and a 
lot of memorization required to avoid being surprised next time you play a given 
level. Designers are often disappointed to realize that a game they thought was 
about quick decisions and thinking on your feet is really about memorizing which 
enemies pop out at what time—a very different (and much more tedious) experience 
for the player. The skills that a player exercises go a long way toward determining 
the nature of that player’s experience, so you must know what these are. Viewing 
your game from this perspective is Lens #34.
Lens #34: The Lens of Skill
To use this lens, stop looking at your game, and start looking at the skills you 
are asking of your players.
Ask yourself these questions:
●
●
What skills does my game require from the player?
●
●
Are there categories of skill that this game is missing?
●
●
Which skills are dominant?
●
●
Are these skills creating the experience I want?

CHAPTER Twelve • SOME ELEMENTS ARE GAME MECHANICS
Mechanic 7: Chance
Our seventh and final game mechanic is chance. We deal with it last because it 
concerns interactions between all of the other six mechanics: space, time, objects, 
actions, rules, and skills.
Chance is an essential part of a fun game because chance means uncertainty, 
and uncertainty means surprises. And as we have discussed earlier, surprises are 
an important source of human pleasure and the secret ingredient of fun.
We must now proceed with caution. You can never take chance for granted, for 
it is very tricky—the math can be difficult, and our intuitions about it are often 
wrong. But a good game designer must become the master of chance and probabil­
ity, sculpting it to his will, to create an experience that is always full of challenging 
decisions and interesting surprises. The challenges of understanding chance are 
well illustrated by a story about the invention of the mathematics of probability—
invented, not surprisingly, for the express purpose of game design.
Invention of Probability
Il est tres bon ésprit, mais quel dommage, il n’est pas geometre.
(He’s a nice guy, but unfortunately, no mathematician.)
—Pascal to Fermat regarding the Chevalier de Méré
It was the year 1654, and French nobleman Antoine Gombaud, the Chevalier de 
Méré (pronounced “Shevulyay duh Mayray”), had a problem. He was an avid gam­
bler and had been playing a game where he would bet that if he rolled a single die 
●
●
Are some players much better at these skills than others? Does this make 
the game feel unfair?
●
●
Can players improve their skills with practice, leading to a feeling of 
mastery?
●
●
Does this game demand the right level of skill?
Exercising skills can be a joyful thing—it is one of the reasons that people love 
games. Of course, it is only joyful if the skills are interesting and rewarding 
and if the challenge level strikes that ideal balance between “too easy” and 
“too hard.” Even dull skills (such as pushing buttons) can be made more inter­
esting by dressing them up as virtual skills and providing the right level of 
challenge. Use this lens as a window into the experience the player is having. 
Because skills do so much to define experience, the Lens of Skill works quite 
well in conjunction with Lens #2, Essential Experience.

Mechanic 7: Chance
four times, at least one time it would come up as a six. He had made some good 
money from this game, but his friends got tired of losing and refused to play it with 
him any further. Trying to find a new way to fleece his friends, he invented a new 
game that he believed had the same odds as the last one. In his new game, he would 
bet that if he rolled a pair of dice twenty-four times, a twelve would come up at least 
once. His friends were wary at first but soon grew to like his new game, because the 
Chevalier started losing money fast! He was confused, because by his math, both 
games had the same odds. Chevalier’s reasoning was as follows:
First Game: In four rolls of a single die, the Chevalier wins if at least one six 
comes up.
The Chevalier reasoned that the chance of a single die coming up 6 was 1/6, and 
therefore rolling a die four times should mean the chance of winning was
	
4⁜×⁜(1/6)⁜渠屮=⁜4/6⁜=⁜66%, which explained why he tended to win.
Second Game: In twenty-four rolls of a pair of dice, the Chevalier wins if at least 
one 12 comes up.
The Chevalier determined that the chance of getting a 12 (double sixes) on a pair 
of dice was 1/36. He reasoned, then, that rolling the dice 24 times meant the odds 
should be
	
24⁜×⁜(1/36)⁜=⁜24/36⁜=⁜2/3⁜=⁜66%. The same odds as the last game!
Confused and losing money, he wrote a letter to mathematician Blaise Pascal, 
asking for advice. Pascal found the problem intriguing—there was no established 
mathematics to answer these questions. Pascal then wrote to his father’s friend, 
Pierre de Fermat, for help. Pascal and Fermat began a lengthy correspondence about 
this and similar problems and, in discovering methods of solving them, established 
probability theory as a new branch of mathematics.
What are the real odds of Chevalier’s games? To understand that, we have to get into 
some math—don’t fret, it’s easy math that anyone can do. Fully covering the mathemat­
ics of probability is not necessary for game design (and beyond the scope of this book), 
but knowing some of the basics can be quite handy. If you are a math genius, you can 
skip this section, or at least read it smugly. For the rest of us, I present the following:
Ten Rules of Probability Every Game Designer Should Know
Rule #1: Fractions Are Decimals Are Percents
If you are one of those people who has always had a hard time with fractions and 
percents, it’s time to face up and deal with them, because they are the language 
of probability. Don’t stress—you can always use a calculator—no one is looking. 

186
CHAPTER Twelve • SOME ELEMENTS ARE GAME MECHANICS
The thing you have to come to grips with is that fractions, decimals, and percents 
are all the same thing and can be used interchangeably. In other words, ½⁜=⁜0.5⁜=⁜50%. 
Those aren’t three different numbers; they are just three ways of writing exactly 
the same number.
Converting from fractions to decimals is easy. Need to know the decimal equiva­
lent of 33/50? Just type 33⁜÷⁜50 into your calculator, and you’ll get 0.66. What about 
percents? They’re easy too. If you look up the word “percent” in the dictionary, 
you’ll see that it really means “per 100.” So, 66% really means 66 per 100, or 66/100, 
or 0.66. If you look at Chevalier’s previous math, you’ll see why we need to convert 
back and forth so often—as humans, we like to talk in percents, but we also like to 
talk about “one chance in six”—so we need a way to convert between these forms. 
If you are the kind of person who suffers from math anxiety, just relax and practice 
a few of these on the calculator—you’ll have the hang of it in no time.
Rule #2: Zero to One—and That’s It!
This one’s easy. Probabilities can only range from 0% to 100%, that is, from 0 to 1 
(see Rule #1), no less and no more. While you can say there is a 10% chance of 
something happening, there is no such thing as a –10% chance and certainly no 
such thing as a 110% chance. A 0% chance of something happening means it won’t 
happen, and a 100% chance means it definitely will. This all might sound obvious, 
but it points out a major problem with Chevalier’s math. Consider his first game 
with the four dice. He believed that with four dice, he had a 4⁜×⁜(1/6), or 4/6, or 
0.66, or 66% chance of having a six come up. But what if he had seven dice? Then 
he would have had 7⁜×⁜(1/6) or 7/6 or 1.17 or 117% chance of winning! And that is 
certainly wrong—if you roll a die seven times, it might be likely that a six will come 
up one of those times, but it is not guaranteed (in fact, it is about a 72% chance). 
Anytime you calculate a probability that comes up greater than 100% (or less than 0%), 
you know for certain that you’ve done something wrong.
Rule #3: “Looked For” Divided By “Possible 
Outcomes” Equals Probability
The first two rules lay some basic groundwork, but now we are going to talk about 
what probability really is—and it is quite simple. You just take the number of times 
your “looked for” outcome can come up and divide by the number of possible out­
comes (assuming your outcomes are equally likely), and you’ve got it. What is the 
chance of a six coming up when you roll a die? Well, there are six possible outcomes, 
and only one of them is the one we are looking for, so the chance of a six coming 
up is 1⁜÷⁜6, or 1/6, or about 17%. What is the chance of an even number coming up 
when you roll a die? There are 3 even numbers, so the answer is 3/6, or 50%. What is 
the chance of drawing a face card from a deck of cards? There are twelve face cards 
in a deck, and fifty-two cards total, so your chances of getting a face card are 12/52, 
or about 23%. If you understand this, you’ve got the fundamental idea of probability.

187
Mechanic 7: Chance
Rule #4: Enumerate!
If Rule #3 is as simple as it sounds (and it is), you might wonder why probability 
is so tricky. The reason is that the two numbers we need (the number of “looked 
for” outcomes and the number of possible outcomes) are not always so obvious. 
For example, if I asked you what the odds of flipping a coin three times and get­
ting “heads” at least twice, what is the number of “looked for” outcomes? I’d be 
surprised if you could answer that without writing anything down. An easy way to 
find out the answer is to enumerate all the possible outcomes:
	1.	 HHH
	2.	 HHT
	3.	 HTH
	4.	 HTT
	5.	 THH
	6.	 THT
	7.	 TTH
	8.	 TTT
There are exactly eight possible outcomes. Which ones have heads at least twice? 
#1, #2, #3, and #5. That’s 4 outcomes out of 8 possibilities, so the answer is 4/8, or 
a 50% chance. Now, why didn’t the Chevalier do this with his games? With his first 
game, there were four die rolls, which means 6⁜×⁜6⁜×⁜6⁜×⁜6, or 1296 possibilities. It 
would have been dull work, but he could have enumerated all the possibilities in 
an hour or so (the list would have looked like 1111, 1112, 1113, 1114, 1115, 1116, 
1121, 1122, 1123, etc.), then counted up the number of combinations that had a six 
in them (671), and divided that by 1296 for his answer. Enumeration will let you 
solve almost any probability problem, if you have the time. Consider the Chevalier’s 
second game, though: 24 rolls of 2 dice! There are 36 possible outcomes for 2 dice, 
and so enumerating all 24 rolls would have meant writing down 3624 (a number 37 
digits long) combinations. Even if he could somehow write down one combination 
a second, it would have taken longer than the age of the universe to list them all. 
Enumeration is handy, but when it takes too long, you need to take shortcuts—and 
that’s what the other rules are for.
Rule #5: In Certain Cases, OR Means Add
Very often, we want to determine the chances of “this OR that” happening, such 
as what are the chances of drawing a face card OR an ace from a deck of cards? 
When the two things we are talking about are mutually exclusive, that is, when it is 
impossible for both of them to happen simultaneously, you can add their individual 
probabilities to get an overall probability. For example, the chances of drawing a 

188
CHAPTER Twelve • SOME ELEMENTS ARE GAME MECHANICS
face card are 12/52, and the chances of drawing an ace are 4/52. Since these are 
mutually exclusive events (it is impossible for them both to happen at once), we can 
add them up: 12/52⁜渠屮+⁜渠屮4/52⁜=⁜16/52, or about a 31% chance.
But what if we asked a different question: What are the chances of drawing 
an ace from a deck of cards or a diamond? If we add these probabilities, we get 
4/52⁜+⁜13/52 (13 diamonds in a deck)⁜=⁜17/52. But, if we enumerate, we see this is 
wrong—the right answer is 16/52. Why? Because the two cases are not mutually 
exclusive—I could draw the ace of diamonds! Since this case is not mutually exclu­
sive, “or” does not mean add.
Let’s look at Chevalier’s first game. He seems to be trying to use this rule for his 
die rolls—adding up four probabilities: 1/6⁜+⁜1/6⁜+⁜1/6⁜+⁜1/6. But he gets the wrong 
answer, because the four events are not mutually exclusive. The addition rule is 
handy, but you must be certain the events you are adding up are mutually exclusive 
from one another.
Rule #6: In Certain Cases, AND Means Multiply
This rule is almost the opposite of the previous one! If we want to find the probabil­
ity of two things happening simultaneously, we can multiply their probabilities to 
get the answer—but ONLY if the two events are NOT mutually exclusive! Consider 
two die rolls. If we want to find the probability of rolling a six on both rolls, we can 
multiply together the probabilities of the two events: The chance of getting a six on 
one die roll is 1/6, and also 1/6 for a second die roll. So the chance of getting two 
sixes is 1/6⁜×⁜1/6⁜=⁜1/36. You could also have determined that by enumeration, of 
course, but this is a much speedier way to do it.
In Rule #5, we asked for the probability of drawing an ace OR a diamond 
from a deck of cards—the rule failed, because the two events were not mutually 
exclusive. So what if we asked about the probability of drawing an ace AND a 
diamond? In other words, what is the probability of drawing the ace of diamonds? 
It should be fairly intuitive that the answer is 1/52, but we can check that with 
Rule #6, since we know the two events are not mutually exclusive. The chance of 
getting an ace is 4/52, and the chance of a diamond is 13/52. Multiplying them, 
4/52⁜×⁜13/52⁜=⁜52/2704⁜=⁜1/52. So, the rule works and matches our intuition.
Do we have enough rules yet to solve Chevalier’s problems? Let’s consider his 
first game:
First Game: In four rolls of a single die, the Chevalier wins if at least one six comes up.
We’ve already established that we could enumerate this and get the answer 
671/1296, but that would take an hour. Is there a quicker way, using the rules we 
have?
(I’ll warn you now—this gets a little hairy. If you don’t really care that much, 
save yourself the headache, and just skip to Rule #7. If you do care, then press on—
you will find it worth the effort.)

189
Mechanic 7: Chance
If the question was about the chances of rolling a die four times and getting four 
sixes, that would be an AND question for four events that are not mutually exclu­
sive, and we could just use Rule #6: 1/6⁜×⁜1/6⁜×⁜1/6⁜×⁜1/6⁜=⁜1/1296. But that isn’t 
what is asked. This is an OR question for four events that are not mutually exclusive 
(it is possible for the Chevalier to get multiple sixes on the four rolls). So what can 
we do? Well, one way is to break it down into events that are mutually exclusive and 
then add them up. Another way to phrase this game is
What are the chances of rolling four dice, and getting either
	a.	 Four sixes, OR
	b.	 Three sixes and one non-six, OR
	c.	 Two sixes and two non-sixes, OR
	d.	 One six and three non-sixes
That might sound a little complicated, but it is four different mutually exclusive 
events, and if we can figure the probability of each, we can just add them up and get 
our answer. We’ve already figured out the probability of (a), using Rule #6: 1/1296. 
So, how about (b)? Really, (b) is four different mutually exclusive possibilities:
	1.	 6, 6, 6, non-six
	2.	 6, 6, non-six, 6
	3.	 6, non-six, 6, 6,
	4.	 Non-six, 6, 6, 6
The probability of rolling a six is 1/6, the probability of rolling a non-six is 5/6. 
So, the probability of each of those is 1/6⁜×⁜1/6⁜×⁜1/6⁜×⁜5/6⁜=⁜5/1296. Now, if we add 
up all four, that comes to 20/1296. So, the probability of (b) is 20/1296.
How about (c)? This one is the same as the last, but there are more combinations. 
It is tricky to figure out how many ways there are for exactly two sixes and two non-
sixes to come up, but there are six ways:
	1.	 6, 6, non-six, non-six
	2.	 6, non-six, 6, non-six
	3.	 6, non-six, non-six, 6
	4.	 non-six, 6, 6, non-six
	5.	 non-six, 6, non-six, 6
	6.	 non-six, non-six, 6, 6
And the probability of each of these is 1/6⁜×⁜1/6⁜×⁜5/6⁜×⁜5/6⁜=⁜25/1296. Adding up all 
six of them comes to 150/1296.

190
CHAPTER Twelve • SOME ELEMENTS ARE GAME MECHANICS
This leaves only (d), which is the inverse of (b):
	a.	 Non-six, non-six, non-six, 6
	b.	 Non-six, non-six, 6, non-six
	c.	 Non-six, 6, non-six, non-six
	d.	 6, non-six, non-six, non-six
The probability of each is 5/6⁜×⁜5/6⁜×⁜5/6⁜×⁜1/6⁜=⁜125/1296. Adding up all four gives 
500/1296.
So, we have now calculated the probability of the four mutually exclusive events:
	a.	 Four sixes—(1/1296)
	b.	 Three sixes and one non-six—(20/1296)
	c.	 Two sixes and two non-sixes—(150/1296)
	d.	 One six and three non-sixes—(500/1296)
Adding up those four probabilities (as Rule #5 allows) gives us a total of 671/1296, 
or about 51.77%. So, we can see that this was a good game for the Chevalier—by 
winning more than 50% of the time, he eventually was likely to make a profit, but 
the game was close enough to even that his friends believed they had a chance—at 
least for a while. It certainly is a very different result than the 66% chance of win­
ning the Chevalier believed he had!
This is the same answer we could have gotten from enumeration, but much 
faster. Really, though, we did a kind of enumeration—it is just that the rules of 
addition and multiplication let us count everything up much faster. Could we do 
the same thing to get the answer to Chevalier’s second game? We could, but with 24 
rolls of two dice, it would probably take an hour or more! This is faster than enu­
meration, but we can do even better by being tricky—that’s where Rule #7 comes in.
Rule #7: One Minus “Does” = “Doesn’t”
This is a more intuitive rule. If the chance of something happening is 10%, the 
chance of it not happening is 90%. Why is this useful? Because often it is quite hard 
to figure out the chance of something happening but easy to figure out the chance 
of it NOT happening.
Consider Chevalier’s second game. To figure out the chance of double sixes com­
ing up at least once on twenty-four die rolls would be nightmarish to figure out, 
because you have so many different possible events to add together (1 double sixes, 
23 non–double sixes; 2 double sixes, 22 non–double sixes; etc.). On the other hand, 
what if we ask a different question: What are the chances of rolling two dice twenty-
four times and NOT getting double sixes? That is now an AND question, for events 
that are not mutually exclusive, so we can use Rule #6 to get the answer! But first 
we’ll use Rule #7 twice—watch.

191
Mechanic 7: Chance
The chance of double sixes coming up on a single roll of the dice is 1/36. So, by 
Rule #7, the chance of not getting double sixes is 1⁜−⁜1/36, or 35/36.
So, using Rule #6 (multiplication), the chances of not getting double sixes 24 
times in a row is 35/36⁜×⁜35/36 twenty-four times, or as we say (35/36)24. You would 
not want to do this calculation by hand, but using a calculator, you find the answer 
is around 0.5086, or 50.86%. But that is the chance of the Chevalier losing. To find 
the chance of the Chevalier winning, we apply Rule #7 again: 1⁜−⁜0.5086⁜=⁜0.4914, or 
about 49.14%. Now it is clear why he lost this game! His chances of winning were 
close enough to even that it was hard for him to tell if this was a winning or losing 
game, but after playing many times, he was very likely to lose.
Even though all probability problems can be solved through enumeration, Rule 
#7 can be a really handy shortcut. In fact, we could have used the same rule to solve 
Chevalier’s first game!
Rule #8: The Sum of Multiple Linear Random Selections Is 
NOT a Linear Random Selection!
Don’t panic. This one sounds hard, but it is really easy. A “linear random selec­
tion” is simply a random event where all the outcomes have an equal chance of 
happening. A die roll is a great example of a linear random selection. If you add up 
multiple die rolls, though, the possible outcomes do NOT have an equal chance of 
happening. If you roll two dice, for example, your chance of getting a seven is very 
good, while your chance of getting a twelve is small. Enumerating all the possibili­
ties shows you why:

Look at how many 7’s there are and only one little twelve! We can show this in a 
graph, called a probability distribution curve, to visually see the chances of each 
total coming up:
Rule #8 might seem like a very obvious rule, but I frequently find novice game 
designers make the mistake of adding together two randomly selected numbers 
without realizing its effect. Sometimes, it is exactly the effect you want—in the 
game Dungeons and Dragons, players generate (virtual) skill attributes with values 
ranging from 3 to 18 by rolling three six-sided dice. As a result, you see a lot of 
attribute values around 10 or 11, but very few at 3 or 18, and this is exactly what the 

192
CHAPTER Twelve • SOME ELEMENTS ARE GAME MECHANICS
designers wanted. How would the game be different if players simply rolled a single 
twenty-sided die to get their attributes?
Game designers who want to use mechanic of chance as a tool in their games 
must know what kind of probability distribution curve they want and know how 
to get it. With practice, probability distribution curves will be a very valuable tool 
in your toolbox.
Rule #9: Roll the Dice
All the probability we’ve been talking about so far is theoretical probability, that is, 
mathematically, what ought to happen. There is also practical probability, which is 
a measure of what has happened. For example, the theoretical probability of getting 
a 6 when I roll a die is a perfect 1/6, or about 16.67%. I could find the practical prob­
ability by rolling a six-sided die 100 times and recording how many times I get a 
six. I might record 20 sixes out of 100. In that case, my practical probability is 20%, 
which is not too far from the theoretical probability. Of course, the more trials I do, 
the closer I would expect the practical probability to get to the theoretical probabil­
ity. This is sometimes known as the “Monte Carlo” method, after the famous casino.
The great thing about the Monte Carlo method of determining probability is that it 
doesn’t involve any complex math—you just repeat the test over and over again and 
record how it comes out. It can sometimes give more useful results than theoretical 
probability too, because it is a measure of the real thing. If there is some factor that 
your mathematics didn’t capture (e.g., perhaps your die is slightly weighted toward 
sixes), or if the math is just so complicated that you can’t come up with a theoreti­
cal representation of your case, the Monte Carlo method can be just the thing. The 
Chevalier could easily have found good answers to his questions by just rolling the 
dice again and again, counting up wins, and dividing by the number of trials.
And here in the computer age, if you know how to do a little bit of programming 
(or know someone who can—see Rule #10), you can easily simulate millions of tri­
als in just a few minutes. It isn’t too hard to program simulations of games and get

some very useful probability answers. For example, in Monopoly, which squares 
are landed on most frequently? It would be nearly impossible to figure this out 
theoretically—but a simple Monte Carlo simulation allows you to answer the ques­
tion quickly by using a computer to roll the dice and move the pieces around the 
board a few million times. Alternatively, you could make use of the Machinations 
system created by Joris Dormans, which is specifically designed to model gameplay 
systems and show patterns of results through repeated simulations.
Rule #10: Geeks Love Showing Off (Gombaud’s Law)
This is the most important of all the probability rules. If you forget all the oth­
ers but remember this one, you’ll get by just fine. There are many more difficult 
aspects of probability that we won’t get into here—when you run into them, the 
easiest thing to do is to find someone who considers themselves a “math whiz.” 
Generally, these people are thrilled to have someone actually needing their exper­
tise, and they will bend over backwards to help you. I have used Rule #10 to solve 
hard game design probability questions again and again. If there aren’t any experts 
around you, post your question on a forum or mailing list. If you really want a fast 
response, preface it with “This problem is probably too difficult for anyone to solve, 
but I thought I would ask anyway,” for there are many math experts who love the 
ego boost of solving a problem that others think is impossible. In a sense, your 
hard problem is a game for them—why not use game design techniques to make it 
as attractive as possible?
You might even be doing your geek a favor! I like to call Rule #10 “Gombaud’s 
Law,” in honor of Antoine Gombaud, the Chevalier de Méré, who, through his 
awareness of this principle, not only solved his gambling problem (his mathemati­
cal one, anyway), but inadvertently initiated all of probability theory.
You might be afraid of exercising Rule #10, because you are afraid of asking 
stupid questions. If you feel that way, don’t forget that Pascal and Fermat owed the 
Chevalier a great debt—without his stupid questions, they never would have made 
some of their greatest discoveries. Your stupid question might lead to a great truth 
of its own—but you’ll never know unless you ask.
Expected Value
You will use probability in many ways in your designs, but one of the most use­
ful will be to calculate expected value. Very often, when you take an action in a 
game, the action will have a value, either positive or negative. This might be points, 
tokens, or money gained or lost. The expected value of a transaction in a game is 
the average of all the possible values that could result.
For example, there might be a rule in a board game that when a player lands 
on a green space, he can roll a six-sided die and get that many power points. The 
expected value of this event is the average of all the possible outcomes. To get the 

194
CHAPTER Twelve • SOME ELEMENTS ARE GAME MECHANICS
average in this case, since all the probabilities are equal, we can add up all the 
possible die rolls, 1⁜+⁜2⁜+⁜3⁜+⁜4⁜+⁜5⁜+⁜6⁜=⁜21, and divide by 6, which gives us 3.5. As a 
game designer, it is very useful for you to know that each time someone lands on a 
green space, they will, on average, get 3.5 power points.
But not all examples are so simple—some involve negative outcomes, and out­
comes that aren’t evenly weighted. Consider a game where a player rolls two dice. 
If they get a 7’s, or an 11’s, they win $5, but if they get anything else, they lose $1. 
How do we figure out the expected value of this game?
The chance of rolling a 7 is 6/36.
The chance of rolling an 11 is 2/36.
Using Rule #8, the chance of rolling anything else is 1⁜−⁜8/36, or 28/36.
So, to calculate the expected value, we multiply the probabilities by the values 
for each and add them all up, like this:
Outcome 
Chance⁜×⁜Outcome 
Value 
7
6/36⁜×⁜$5
$0.83
11
2/36⁜×⁜$5
$0.28
Everything else
28/36⁜×⁜− $1
−$0.78
Expected value
$0.33
So, we see that this is a good game to play, because in the long run, you will, on aver­
age, win thirty-three cents each time you play. But, what if we changed the game, so 
that only 7’s are winning numbers and 11’s make you lose a dollar, just like all the 
other numbers? This changes the expected value, like this:
Outcome

Value 
7
6/36⁜×⁜$5
$0.83
Everything else
30/36⁜×⁜− $1

An expected value of zero means that this game is just as good as flipping a coin in 
the long run. Wins and losses are completely balanced. What if we change it again, 
so that this time only eleven wins?

Mechanic 7: Chance
Ouch! As you might expect, this is a losing game. You’ll lose, on average, about 
eighty-six cents each time you play it. Of course, you could make it into a fair game, 
or even a winning game, by increasing the payoff for getting an eleven.
Consider Values Carefully
Expected value is an excellent tool for game balancing, which we will discuss more 
in the next chapter—but if you aren’t careful about what the true value of an out­
come is, it can be very misleading.
Consider these three attacks that might be part of a fantasy role-playing game:
Attack Name 
Chance of Hitting (%) 
Damage 
Wind
100
4
Fireball
80
5
Lightning bolt
20
40
What is the expected value of each of these? Wind is easy—it always does exactly 
4 damage, so the expected value of that attack is 4. Fireball hits 80% of the time 
and misses 20% of the time, so it’s expected value is (5⁜×⁜0.8)⁜+⁜(0⁜×⁜0.2)⁜=⁜4 points, 
the same as the wind attack. The lightning bolt attack doesn’t hit very often, but 
when it does, it packs a wallop. Its expected value is (40⁜×⁜0.2)⁜+⁜(0⁜×⁜0.8)⁜=⁜8 points.
Now, based on those values, one might conclude that players would always use 
the lightning bolt attack, since on average it does double the damage of the other 
two attacks. And if you are fighting an enemy that has 500 hit points, that might be 
correct. But what about an enemy with 15 hit points? Most players would not use 
lightning bolt in that case—they would opt for something weaker but surer. Why is 
this? Because even though the lightning bolt can do 40 damage points, only 15 of 
them are of any use in that situation—the real expected value of the lightning bolt 
against an enemy with 15 HP is (0.2⁜×⁜15)⁜+⁜(0.8⁜×⁜0)⁜=⁜3 points, which is lower than 
both the wind and the fireball attack.
You must always take care to measure the real values of actions in your game. If 
something gives a benefit that a player can’t use, or contains a hidden penalty, you 
must capture that in your calculations.
Human Element
You must also keep in mind that expected value calculations do not perfectly pre­
dict human behavior. You would expect players to always choose the option with 
the highest expected value, but that is not always the case. In some cases, this is 
due to ignorance—because players did not realize the actual expected value. For 
example, if you didn’t tell players the respective chances of wind, fireball, and 

196
CHAPTER Twelve • SOME ELEMENTS ARE GAME MECHANICS
lightning bolt, but left it to them to discover them through trial and error, you might 
find that players who tried lightning bolt several times and never got a hit reached 
the conclusion that “lightning bolt never hits” and therefore has an expected value 
of zero. The estimates that players make about how often an event happens are 
often incorrect. You must be aware of the “perceived probabilities” that players have 
arrived at, because it will determine how they play.
But sometimes, even with perfect information, players still will not choose an 
option with the highest expected value. Two psychologists, Kahneman and Tversky, 
tried an interesting experiment, where they asked a number of subjects which of 
the two games they would like to play:
Game A:
66% chance of winning $2400
33% chance of winning $2500
1% chance of winning $0
Game B:
100% chance of winning $2400
These are both pretty great games to play! But is one better than the other? If you 
do the expected value calculations
Expected Value of Game A: 0.66⁜×⁜$2400⁜+⁜0.33⁜×⁜$2500⁜+⁜0.01⁜×⁜$0⁜=⁜$2409
Expected Value of Game B: 1.00⁜×⁜2400⁜=⁜$2400
You can see that Game A has a higher expected value. But only 18% of the subjects 
they surveyed picked A, while 82% preferred playing Game B.
Why? The reason is that the expected value calculation does not capture an 
important human element: regret. People not only seek out options that create the 
most pleasure, they also avoid the ones that cause the most pain. If you played Game 
A (and we’re assuming you only get to play it once), and were unlucky enough to 
get that 1% and $0, it would feel pretty bad. People are often willing to pay a price 
to eliminate the potential of regret—“buying peace of mind,” as the insurance sales­
men say. Not only are they willing to pay a price to avoid regret, they are willing to 
take risks. This is why a gambler who has lost a little money is often willing to take 
more risks to try to get the money back. Tversky puts it this way: “When it comes 
to taking risks for gains, people are conservative. They will make a sure gain over 
a problem gain. But we are also finding that when people are faced with a choice 
between a small, certain loss and a large, probable loss, they will gamble.” This 
appears to be a large part of the success of the “free-to-play” game Puzzle & Dragons. 
Players perform a series of puzzles and rack up treasures while making their way 
through a dungeon. Sometimes, though, they perish in the dungeon, and the game 

197
Mechanic 7: Chance
effectively says, “Oh, that’s too bad, you’re dying. Look at all the treasure you are 
going to lose. Are you sure you don’t want to pay just a little bit of real money, so 
you have a shot at keeping what you have earned?” And many people respond by 
paying cash money to avoid that small, certain loss.
In some cases, the human mind inflates some risks completely out of proportion. 
In one study, Tversky asked people to estimate the likelihood of various causes of 
death and obtained the following results:
Cause of Death 
Estimated 
Chance (%) 
Actual 
Chance (%) 
Heart disease
22
34
Cancer
18
23
Other natural causes
33
35
Accident
32
5
Homicide
10
1
Other unnatural causes
11
2
What is particularly interesting here is that the subjects making estimates under­
estimated the top three categories (natural causes of death) and significantly over­
estimated the bottom three (unnatural causes of death). This distortion of reality 
seems to be a reflection of the fears of the respondents. What bearing does this have 
on game design? As a designer, you must have not only a grasp of the actual prob­
abilities of events in your game but also the perceived probabilities, which may be 
quite different for a number of reasons.
You will need to consider both actual and perceived probabilities when calculating 
expected values, which provide such useful information that they make Lens #35.
Lens #35: The Lens of Expected Value
To use this lens, think about the chance of different events occurring in your 
game and what those mean to your player.
Ask yourself these questions:
●
●
What is the actual chance of a certain event occurring?
●
●
What is the perceived chance?
●
●
What value does the outcome of that event have? Can the value be quanti­
fied? Are there intangible aspects of value that I am not considering?
●
●
Each action a player can take has a different expected value when I add up 
all the possible outcomes. Am I happy with these values? Do they give the 
player interesting choices? Are they too rewarding, or too punishing?

198
CHAPTER Twelve • SOME ELEMENTS ARE GAME MECHANICS
Skill and Chance Get Tangled
As tricky as probability and the difference between actual and perceived values 
might be, the game mechanic of chance has more tricks up its sleeve. As much as 
we like to think that chance and skill are completely separate mechanics, there are 
important interactions between them that we cannot ignore. Here are five of the 
most important skill/chance interactions for a game designer to consider.
	1.	 Estimating chance is a skill: In many games, what separates the skilled players 
from the unskilled is their ability to predict what is going to happen next, often 
through calculating probabilities. The game of blackjack, for example, is almost 
entirely about knowing the odds. Some players even practice “card counting,” 
which is the practice of keeping track of what cards have already been played, 
since each card played changes the odds of what subsequent cards can appear. 
The perceived probabilities in your game can vary a great deal between players 
who are skilled estimators and those who are not.
	2.	 Skills have a probability of success: Naively, one might think that completely 
skill-based games, such as chess or baseball, have no aspects of randomness 
or risk in them. But from a player’s point of view, this simply isn’t true. Every 
action has some level of risk, and players are constantly making expected value 
decisions, deciding when to play it safe and when to take a big risk. These risks 
can be difficult to quantify (what are the odds that I can successfully steal a base 
or that I can trap my opponent’s queen without him noticing?), but they are still 
risks. When designing a game, you need to make sure they are balanced just as 
you would balance “pure chance” game elements, like drawn cards or die rolls.
	3.	 Estimating an opponent’s skill is a skill: A big part of a player’s ability to deter­
mine the chances of success for a particular action rests on their ability to estimate 
their opponent’s skill. A fascinating part of many games is trying to fool your oppo­
nent into thinking your skills are greater than they are, to prevent him from trying 
Expected value is one of your most valuable tools for analyzing game balance. 
The challenge of using it is finding a way to numerically represent everything 
that can happen to a player. Gaining and losing money is easy to represent. 
But what is the numerical value of “boots of speed” that let you run faster or 
a “warp gate” that lets you skip two levels? These are difficult to quantify per­
fectly—but that doesn’t mean you can’t take a guess. As we’ll see in the next 
chapter, as you go through multiple iterations of game testing and tweaking 
parameters and values in your game, you will also be tweaking your own esti­
mations of the values of different outcomes. Quantifying these less tangible 
elements can be quite enlightening, because it makes you think concretely 
about what is valuable to the player and why—and this concrete knowledge 
will put you in control of the balance of your game.

199
Mechanic 7: Chance
anything too bold and to make him uncertain of himself. Likewise, sometimes the 
opposite is true—in some games, it is a good strategy to make a player think your 
skills are less than they really are, so that your opponent will not notice your subtle 
strategies and will perhaps try actions that would be risky against a skilled player.
	4.	 Predicting pure chance is an imagined skill: Humans look for patterns, con­
sciously and subconsciously, to help predict what is going to happen next. Our 
mania for patterns often leads us to look for and find patterns where none exist. 
Two of the most common false patterns are the “lucky streak fallacy” (I’ve had 
several wins in a row, and therefore another is likely) and, its opposite, the “gam­
bler’s fallacy” (I’ve had several losses, so I must be due for a win). It is easy to 
scoff at these as ignorant, but in the all-important mind of the player, detecting 
these bogus patterns feels like the exercise of a real skill, and as a designer, you 
should find ways to use that to your advantage.
	5.	 Controlling pure chance is an imagined skill: Not only do our brains actively 
seek patterns, but they also actively and desperately seek cause-and-effect rela­
tionships. With pure chance, there is no way to control the outcome—but that 
doesn’t stop people from rolling the dice a certain way, carrying lucky charms, 
or engaging in other superstitious rituals. This feeling that it might be possible to 
control fate is part of what makes gambling games so exciting. Intellectually, we 
know it isn’t possible, but when you are up there rolling the dice, saying “come 
on, come on…,” it certainly feels like it might be possible, especially when you 
get lucky! If you try playing games of pure chance, but completely disengage 
yourself from the idea that anything you think or do can influence the outcome, 
much of the fun suddenly drains away. Our natural tendency to try to control fate 
can make games of chance feel like games of skill.
Chance is tricky stuff, because it intertwines hard math, human psychology, and 
all of the basic game mechanics. But this trickiness is what gives games their rich­
ness, complexity, and depth. The last of our seven basic game mechanics gives us 
Lens #36.
Lens #36: The Lens of Chance
To use this lens, focus on the parts of your game that involve randomness and 
risk, keeping in mind that those two things are not the same.
Ask yourself these questions:
●
●
What in my game is truly random? What parts just feel random?
●
●
Does the randomness give the players positive feelings of excitement and 
challenge, or does it give them negative feelings of hopelessness and lack 
of control?

At long last, we have made it through all seven of the basic game mechanics. 
Soon, we will move onto more advanced mechanics that are built from these, such 
as puzzles and interactive story structures. But first, we need to explore methods of 
bringing these basic elements into balance.

What is the relationship between chance and skill in my game? Are there

there ways I can make exercising skills feel more like risk taking?
Risk and randomness are like spices. A game without any hint of them can be 
completely bland, but put in too much and they overwhelm everything else. 
But get them just right, and they bring out the flavor of everything else in your 
game. Unfortunately, using them in your game is not as simple as sprinkling 
them on top. You must look into your game to see where elements of risk and 
randomness naturally arise, and then decide how you can best tame them to 
do your bidding. Don’t fall into the trap of thinking that elements of chance 
only occur around die rolls or randomly generated numbers. On the contrary, 
you can find them wherever a player encounters the unknown.

CHAPTER Thirteen • GAME MECHANICS MUST BE IN BALANCE
A false balance is an abomination to the Lord.
—Proverbs 11:1
Have you ever looked forward to playing a game that you were certain was going 
to be incredibly fun, only to be terribly disappointed? This game had a story that 
sounded interesting, the kind of gameplay action that is your favorite, cutting-edge 
technology, and beautiful artwork—but somehow the play was monotonous, con­
fusing, and frustrating. This is a game that is out of balance.
To novice designers, the business of balancing a game seems quite mysteri­
ous—but really, balancing a game is nothing more than adjusting the elements 
of the game until they deliver the experience you want. Balancing a game is far 
from a science; in fact, despite the simple mathematics that is often involved, 
it is generally considered the most artful part of game design, for it is all about 
understanding subtle nuances in the relationships between the elements of your 
game and knowing which ones to alter, how much to alter them, and which ones 
to leave alone.
Part of what makes game balancing so difficult is that no two games are alike 
and every game has many different factors that need to be in balance. As a designer, 
you must discern what elements in your game need to be balanced and then experi­
ment with changing them until you have them generating exactly the experience 
you want your players to have.
Think of it like creating a new recipe—it is one thing to determine the ingre­
dients you need, but another is to decide how much of each to use and how they 
should be combined. Some of the decisions you make will be based on hard math­
ematics (1.5 teaspoons of baking powder leavens 1 cup of flour), but others, like 
how much sugar to use, are often a matter of personal taste. A skilled chef can make 
the simplest of recipes a delight to eat for the same reason a skilled game designer 
can make the simplest of games a delight to play—they both know how to balance 
the ingredients.
Game balancing can come in a variety of forms, because every different game 
has different things that must be brought into balance. Still, there are some patterns 
of balance that occur over and over again. Balancing a game is all about examining 
it carefully, so this chapter will be rich with many lenses.
The Twelve Most Common Types of Game Balance
Balance Type #1: Fairness
There is no joy in an unequal battle.
—Mrs. Cavour

203
The Twelve Most Common Types of Game Balance
Symmetrical Games
One quality that players universally seek in games is fairness. Players want to feel 
that the forces working against them do not have an advantage that will make them 
impossible to defeat. One of the simplest ways to ensure this is to make your game 
symmetrical, that is, to give equal resources and powers to all players. Most tradi­
tional board games (such as checkers, chess, and Monopoly) and almost all sports 
use this method to be sure that no player has an unfair advantage over another. If 
you want to put players in direct competition with each other and you expect them 
to have roughly equal levels of skill, symmetrical games are a great choice. They are 
particularly good systems for determining which player is the best, since all things 
in the game are equal but for the skill and strategy that the individual players bring 
to the game. In these games, perfect symmetry is not always possible as there is 
often some minor issue such as “who goes first?” or “who starts with the ball?” that 
gives one side a small advantage over the other. Generally, random selection, such 
as a coin toss or die roll, is the solution. Though it gives one player a small advan­
tage, over many games, the advantage is distributed evenly. In some cases, the way 
this asymmetry is remedied is by giving the advantage to the player with the least 
skill—such as “youngest player goes first.” This is an elegant way to use the natural 
imbalance of the game to help balance the skill levels of the players.
Asymmetrical Games
It is also possible, and often desirable, to give opponents different resources and 
abilities. If you do, be aware that you have a significant balancing task ahead of 
you! Here are some of the reasons you might create an asymmetrical game:
	1.	 To simulate a real-world situation: If the point of your game is to simulate the 
battle between Axis and Allied forces during World War II, a symmetrical game 
does not make sense, since the real-world conflict was not symmetrical.
	2.	 To give players another way to explore the game space: Exploration is one of the 
great pleasures of gameplay. Players often enjoy exploring the possibilities of playing 
the same game with different powers and resources. In a fighting game, for example, 
if two players have ten different fighters to choose from, each with different powers, 
there are ten times ten different pairings, each of which requires ­different strategies, 
and effectively you have turned one game into one hundred games.
	3.	 Personalization: Different players bring different skills to a game—if you give 
the players a choice of powers and resources that best match their own skills, it 
makes them feel powerful—they have been able to shape the game to emphasize 
the thing they are best at.
	4.	 To level the playing field: Sometimes, your opponents have radically differ­
ent skill levels. This is especially true if you have opponents that are computer 

204
CHAPTER Thirteen • GAME MECHANICS MUST BE IN BALANCE
controlled. Consider the game of Pac-Man. It would be more symmetrical if there 
were just one ghost chasing Pac-Man, not four. But if that was the case, the 
player would win easily for a human can easily outwit a computer when it comes 
to navigating a maze. But to outwit four computer-controlled opponents at once 
brings the game into balance and gives the computer a fair chance of defeating 
the player. Some games are customizable in this regard—a golf handicap, for 
instance, lets players of different levels compete at the challenge levels they will 
both enjoy. Whether to introduce this kind of balancing depends on whether 
your game is meant to be a standard measure of player’s skill or whether the goal 
is to provide challenge to all players.
	5.	 To create interesting situations: In the infinite space of all the games that can 
be created, many more of them are asymmetrical than are symmetrical. Pitting 
asymmetrical forces against each other can often be interesting and thought 
provoking for the players, since it is not always obvious what the right strate­
gies will be to win the game. Players become naturally curious about whether 
one side or another has an advantage, and they will often spend a great deal 
of time and thought to try to decide whether the game is truly fair. The game 
of Bhag-Chal (the official board game of Nepal) is an excellent example of this. 
In this game, not only do the players have unequal forces, they also have differ­
ent goals! One player controls five tigers, while the other controls twenty goats. 
The tiger player wins by eating five goats, and the goat player wins by position­
ing the goats so that no tiger can move. Though it is generally acknowledged 
by experienced players that the game is balanced, novices to the game spend 
a great deal of time discussing whether one side or the other has particular 
advantage and playing the game over and over trying to determine the best 
strategies and counter strategies.
It can be quite difficult to properly adjust the resources and powers in an asym­
metrical game to make them feel evenly matched. The most common method of 
doing so is to assign a value to each resource or power and make sure that the sum 
of the values is equal for both sides. See the following section for an example.
Biplane Battle
Imagine a game of biplane dogfight combat. Each player gets to choose one of the 
following planes:
Plane 
Speed 
Maneuverability 
Firepower 
Piranha
Medium
Medium
Medium
Revenger
High
High
Low
Sopwith Camel
Low
Low
Medium

205
The Twelve Most Common Types of Game Balance
Are these planes equally balanced? It is hard to say. At first glance, though, we 
might evaluate all three categories as low = 1, medium = 2, and high = 3. This 
gives us new information:
Plane 
Speed 
Maneuverability 
Firepower 
Totals 
Piranha
Medium (2)
Medium (2)
Medium (2)
6
Revenger
High (3)
High (3)
Low (1)
7
Sopwith Camel
Low (1)
Low (1)
Medium (2)
4
Looked at from this point of view, the player with the Revenger seems to have an 
unfair advantage over the others. And that may be the case. But after playing the 
game a little, maybe we notice that the Piranha and the Revenger seem evenly 
matched but players who fly the Sopwith Camel generally lose. This might lead us to 
speculate that Firepower is more valuable than the other categories—maybe twice 
as valuable. In other words, for the Firepower column, low = 2, medium = 4, and 
high = 6. This gives us a new table:

Revenger

This gives us totals that match our observation of the game in action. We may 
now have a model that shows us how to balance the game to make it fair. To test 
our theory, we might change the Firepower for the Sopwith Camel to be high (6), 
giving us a new table:

It would appear that if our model is correct, these three planes are equally bal­
anced. But that’s only a theory. The way we find out is by playtesting the game. If 
we play and determine that gameplay feels roughly fair no matter which plane you 
use, then our model is correct. But what if we play and realize that the Sopwith 
Camel is still losing battles? In that case, we will have to make a new speculation, 
change our model, rebalance, and try playing again.
It is important to note that the act of balancing and developing a model of how to 
balance go hand in hand. As you balance, you learn more about relationships in the 

206
CHAPTER Thirteen • GAME MECHANICS MUST BE IN BALANCE
game, and you can make a better mathematical model that represents these relation­
ships. And as you change the model, you learn more about the right way to balance 
your game. The model informs the balance, and the balancing informs the model.
Also note that balancing a game can only really begin once the game is playable. 
Many a game has suffered in the marketplace because all the time in the schedule 
got used up just getting the game to work, and not enough time was allotted to bal­
ance the game before it needed to go to market. There is an old rule of thumb that 
it takes six months to balance your game after you have a completely working ver­
sion, but this varies a great deal depending on the type and scope of your game. The 
rule I personally use is that half the development time should be spent balancing 
the game. Certainly, the more new gameplay elements you have, the longer it will 
take you to balance it properly.
Rock, Paper, Scissors
One simple way to balance elements for fairness is to make sure that whenever 
something in your game has an advantage over something else, yet another thing 
has an advantage over that! The iconic example of this is the game of Rock, Paper, 
Scissors where
●
●
Rock breaks scissors
●
●
Scissors cut paper
●
●
Paper covers rock
None of the elements can be supreme, because there is always another that can 
defeat it. It is a simple way to ensure that every game element has both strengths 
and weaknesses. Fighting games particularly like to use this technique to help 
ensure none of the warriors a player might choose are undefeatable.
Balancing your game to make it feel fair is one of the most fundamental types 
of game balancing. You will surely want to use the Lens of Fairness on any game 
you create.
Lens #37: The Lens of Fairness
To use the Lens of Fairness, think carefully about the game from each player’s 
point of view. Taking into account each player’s skill level, find a way to give 
each player a chance of winning that each will consider to be fair.
Ask yourself these questions:
●
●
Should my game be symmetrical? Why?

Should my game be asymmetrical? Why?

Balance Type #2: Challenge vs. Success
Let us revisit this diagram from Chapter 10, “Player’s Mind.”
We know that keeping the player in the flow channel is desirable. If play is too 
challenging, the player becomes frustrated. But if the player succeeds too easily, 
they can become bored. Keeping the player on the middle path means keeping the 
experiences of challenge and success in proper balance. This can be particularly 
difficult since players may have all different levels of skill. What one player finds 
●
●
Which is more important: that my game is a reliable measure of who has 
the most skill or that it provide an interesting challenge to all players?
●
●
If I want players of different skill levels to play together, what means will I 
use to make the game interesting and challenging for everyone?
Fairness can be a slippery subject. There are some cases where one side has 
an advantage over the other and the game still seems fair. Sometimes this is so 
that players of unequal skill can play together, but there can be other reasons. 
In the game Alien vs. Predator, for example, it is generally recognized that 
in multiplayer mode, Predators have a significant advantage over the Aliens. 
Players do not consider it to be unfair, however, because it is in keeping with 
the Alien vs. Predator story world, and they accept that if they play as an Alien, 
they will be at a disadvantage and will need to compensate for that with extra 
skill. It is a badge of pride among players to be able to win the game when 
playing as an Alien.

CHAPTER Thirteen • GAME MECHANICS MUST BE IN BALANCE
boring, another may find challenging, and yet another may find frustrating. Some 
common techniques for striking a proper balance include the following:
●
●
Increase difficulty with each success: This is a very common pattern in vid­
eogames—each level is harder than the last. Players build their skill until 
they can complete a level, only to be presented with one that challenges them 
yet again. Don’t forget, of course, to use the tense and release pattern shown 
earlier.
●
●
Let players get through easy parts fast: Assuming your game has some method 
of gradually increasing the difficulty, you do yourself a service by allowing 
skilled players to finish a level quickly if they can easily master it. This way, 
skilled players will blow through easy levels, quickly getting to a challenge that 
is more interesting to them, while less skilled players will be challenged by the 
early levels. This lets every player quickly get to the part of the game that is a 
challenge. If you arrange it differently, such that each level takes one hour to 
play, regardless of skill level, skilled players may quickly grow bored from lack 
of challenge.
●
●
Create “layers of challenge”: A popular pattern in games is to give a grade, or 
some number of stars, at the end of each level or mission. If you get a “D” or “F,” 
you must repeat the level, but if you get a “C” or better, you can continue. This 
creates a situation with a lot of flexibility in how you can play it. Novice players 
are thrilled to get a “C” and unlock the next level. As they gain experience and 
have unlocked all the levels, they may set themselves a new challenge—to earn 
an “A” (or even “A+”!) on earlier levels.
●
●
Let players choose the difficulty level: A tried and true method is to let play­
ers choose to play on “easy, medium, or hard” modes. Some games (e.g., many 
Atari 2600 games) even let you change the difficulty-level midgame. The upside 
of this is that players can quickly find the appropriate challenge level for their 
skill level. The downside is that you have to create and balance multiple versions 
of your game. Also, it can detract from the “reality” of your game—players will 
argue over which version is the “real” one or be left feeling unsure whether any 
of them are “real.”
●
●
Playtest with a variety of players: Many designers fall into a trap of only test­
ing with people who are constantly exposed to the game and end up design­
ing a game that is too frustrating for novices. Others fall into the opposite trap 
and only test their game with people who have never played before. They end 
up designing a game that experienced players quickly grow bored with. Wise 
designers playtest with a mix of skilled and novice players, to be sure that their 
game is fun at first, fun after a while, and fun much, much later.
●
●
Give the losers a break: Mario Kart is famous for its unusual system of giving out 
power-ups. Players who are ahead in the race get meager power-ups, while play­
ers who are far behind get the good stuff, allowing them to race ahead. This is a 

209
The Twelve Most Common Types of Game Balance
great system for that game because it feels more fair and keeps everyone engaged: 
players who are behind need to pay attention because a game-changing power-
up could come at any second, and players who are ahead cannot afford to rest 
on their laurels because that “blue shell” could hit them at any time. This tricky 
system does a great job at nudging all players to the center of the flow channel.
One of the toughest challenges in game balancing is deciding how difficult the 
game should get over time. Many designers are so afraid of players beating their 
game too easily that they make later levels so fiendishly difficult to win that 90% of 
players eventually give up on the game in frustration. These designers hope that the 
increased challenge will extend the play time—and there is something to that—if 
you have expended forty hours to get through level nine, you will probably be will­
ing to work pretty hard to defeat level ten. But in truth, there are so many competing 
games to play that many players just give up in frustration. On the other hand, with 
a free to play game, this late-game frustration might be just what you want, to spur 
players to pay money and move toward completion. As a designer, it makes sense 
to ask yourself, “What percentage of players do I want to be able to complete this 
game?” and then design for that.
And don’t forget: just learning to play a game at all is a challenge! For this rea­
son, the first level or two of a game is often incredibly simplistic—the player is so 
challenged just trying to understand the “controls and goals” that any additional 
challenge might push them right into frustration. Not to mention the fact that a few 
early successes can do a lot to build a player’s confidence—a confident player will 
give up less easily on a game.
Challenge is a core element of gameplay and can be so difficult to balance that 
it merits its own lens.
Lens #38: The Lens of Challenge
Challenge is at the core of almost all gameplay. You could even say that a 
game is defined by its goals and its challenges. When examining the chal­
lenges in your game, ask yourself these questions:
●
●
 What are the challenges in my game?
●
●
 Are they too easy, too hard, or just right?
●
●
 Can my challenges accommodate a wide variety of skill levels?
●
●
 How does the level of challenge increase as the player succeeds?
●
●
 Is there enough variety in the challenges?
●
●
 What is the maximum level of challenge in my game?

210
CHAPTER Thirteen • GAME MECHANICS MUST BE IN BALANCE
Balance Type #3: Meaningful Choices
There are many different ways to give a player choices in a game. Meaningful 
choices for a player lead them to ask themselves questions, such as the following:
●
●
Where should I go?
●
●
How should I spend my resources?
●
●
What should I practice and try to perfect?
●
●
How should I dress my character?
●
●
Should I try to get through the game quickly or carefully?
●
●
Should I focus on offense or defense?
●
●
What strategy should I use in this situation?
●
●
Which power should I choose?
●
●
Should I play it safe or take a big risk?
A good game gives the player meaningful choices. Not just any choices but choices 
that will have a real impact on what happens next and how the game turns out. 
Many designers fall into the trap of offering the player meaningless choices; for 
example, in a racing game, you might have 50 vehicles to choose from, but if they 
all drive the same way, it is like having no choice at all. Other designers fall into a 
different trap—offering choices that no one would want. You might offer a soldier 
ten guns, all different, but if one of them is clearly better than the rest, again it is 
like having no choice at all.
When choices are offered to a player, but one of them is clearly better than the 
rest, this is called a dominant strategy. Once a dominant strategy is discovered, the 
game is no longer fun, because the puzzle of the game has been solved—there are 
no more choices to make. When you discover that a game you are working on has a 
dominant strategy, you must change the rules (balance things) so that this strategy 
no longer dominates and meaningful choice can be restored to the game. The previ­
ous Biplane Battle example is an example of just that—a designer trying to balance 
a game to remove a dominant strategy and restore meaningful choice to the players. 
Hidden dominant strategies that are discovered by players are often referred to as 
“exploits,” since they can be exploited by players to take a shortcut to success that 
the designer never intended.
In early development of a game, dominant strategies abound. As the game contin­
ues development, these strategies start to get properly balanced. Paradoxically, this 
often throws novice designers into a panic: “Yesterday, I understood the right way 
to play this game—but with these new changes, I’m not sure about the right way to 
play it!” They feel like they have lost their handle on their own game. But in reality, 
the game has just taken a big step forward! It no longer has a dominant strategy, and 
now there are meaningful choices to be made. Instead of fearing this moment, you 

211
The Twelve Most Common Types of Game Balance
should cherish it and take the opportunity to see if you can understand why the cur­
rent configuration of rules and values is putting your game into balance.
But this leads to another question: how many meaningful choices should we give 
to a player? Michael Mateas points out that the number of choices a player seeks is 
dependent on the number of things they desire:
●
●
If choices > desires, then the player is overwhelmed.
●
●
If choices < desires, the player is frustrated.
●
●
If choices = desires, the player has a feeling of freedom and fulfillment.
So, to properly determine the number of choices, you need to figure out the types 
and number of things the player would like to do. In some situations, the player 
wants only a small number of meaningful choices (choosing to take the left or 
right fork in the road is interesting—choosing to take one of thirty side roads is 
overwhelming). Other times, a huge number of choices are desired (e.g., a clothes 
shopping interface in the Sims).
Meaningful choices are the heart of interactivity, and having a lens to examine 
them is quite useful.
Triangularity
One of the most exciting and interesting choices for a player to make is whether to 
play it safe and go for a small reward or take a big risk to try for a big reward. This 
is a hard decision to make, if the game is balanced properly. I find that about eight 
out of ten times someone comes to me asking for help on a game prototype that “just 
isn’t fun”; the game is missing this kind of meaningful choice. You could call this 
“balanced asymmetric risk,” since you are balancing a low risk with low reward 
against a high risk for high reward, but that is kind of a mouthful. This relationship 
comes up so often, and is so important, that I like to give it a shorter name: trian­
gularity. The player is one point of the triangle, the low-risk choice is the second 
point, and the high-risk choice is the third.
Lens #39: The Lens of Meaningful Choices
When we make meaningful choices, it lets us feel like the things we do matter. 
To use this lens, ask yourself these questions:
●
●
What choices am I asking the player to make?
●
●
Are they meaningful? How?
●
●
Am I giving the player the right number of choices? Would more make 
them feel more powerful? Would less make the game clearer?
●
●
Are there any dominant strategies in my game?

212
CHAPTER Thirteen • GAME MECHANICS MUST BE IN BALANCE
An example of a game that has good triangularity is Space Invaders. Most of the 
time in the game you are shooting at low point aliens near your ship worth 10, 20, 
and 30 points. They are slow moving and easy to shoot, and shooting them makes 
you safer because it stops them from dropping bombs on you. Every once in a 
while, however, a little red flying saucer flies across the top of the screen. It poses 
no threat, and it is quite difficult and dangerous to shoot. It is difficult because it is 
moving and far away, and it is dangerous because to properly aim at it, you have 
to take your eyes off your ship to look at it, and you risk getting hit by a bomb. 
However, it is worth between 100 and 300 points! Without the flying saucer, Space 
Invaders gets quite tedious, because your choices are few—you just shoot and shoot 
and shoot. With the flying saucer, you occasionally have a very difficult, meaning­
ful choice to make—should you play it safe or take a risk and go for the big points? 
Triangularity is so important that it gets its own lens.
Lens #40: The Lens of Triangularity
Giving a player the choice to play it safe for a low reward or to take a risk for a 
big reward is a great way to make your game interesting and exciting. To use 
the Lens of Triangularity, ask yourself these questions:
●
●
Do I have triangularity now? If not, how can I get it?
●
●
Is my attempt at triangularity balanced? That is, are the rewards commen­
surate with the risks?
Once you start looking for triangularity in games, you will see it everywhere. 
A dull, monotonous game can quickly become exciting and rewarding when 
you add a dash of triangularity.

The Twelve Most Common Types of Game Balance
A classic example of triangularity appears in the book Hackers by Steven Levy. 
An MIT engineer hacked a vending machine giving each user a choice: get your 
snack from the vending machine for normal price as usual or take a chance. 
A digital coin could be flipped, resulting in your snack either costing double or 
being completely free.
A good way to make sure your triangularity is balanced is to use Lens #35, 
Expected Value. The arcade game Qix provides an interesting example of balanc­
ing with expected values. In it, you try to draw rectangular shapes to surround 
territory on a blank game board. While you do this, a blob of lines, called the 
Qix, floats around the board at random. If the Qix touches one of your rectangles 
before you finish drawing it, you die. But if you finish drawing the rectangle, then 
you claim that area of the board. When you have covered 75% of the board, you 
win the level.
The designers of the game give the player a very explicit choice—each time 
he draws a rectangle, he can either move quickly (drawing a blue rectangle) or 
at half speed (drawing an orange rectangle). Since moving at half speed is twice 
as dangerous, rectangles drawn at half speed are given double the points. This 
works because if we assume that the chance of successfully drawing a fast, blue 
rectangle is 20% and it is worth 100 points, then the expected value of attempt­
ing to draw one is 100 points × 20% = 20 points. We also know that drawing a 
rectangle at half speed has half the chance of succeeding, so we get a table that 
looks like this:
Speed 
Chance of 
Success (%) 
Points 
Expected Value 
Fast (blue)
20
100
20
Slow (orange)
10
?
20
We want the game to be balanced, so we keep the expected value constant. It is 
pretty easy to see that if we want the game to be balanced, the point value should 
be 200 points for the same size slow rectangle. The difficult part with this kind of 
thing is figuring out the chance of success—we often have to estimate—but this 
is another case where the model informs the prototype and testing the prototype 
informs the model, creating a virtuous circle where eventually the model is correct 
and the game is balanced.
Mario Kart is a symphony of triangularity. Again and again, it brings you 
high-risk/low-risk choices with appropriate payoffs. Examples include the 
following:
●
●
Manual or automatic? Manual requires more skill to use, but when used well, it 
gives you more speed boosts.

214
CHAPTER Thirteen • GAME MECHANICS MUST BE IN BALANCE
●
●
Kart or bike? Karts have a faster base speed—but if you do a wheelie on a bike 
(which is risky because you can’t turn during a wheelie), you go faster than the 
karts do.
●
●
Grab power-ups? (risking a crash) or ignore them?
●
●
Use power-ups? (risk breaking your concentration) or ignore them?
●
●
Keep the power-up you’ve got? or dump it in favor of a new one?
●
●
Use speed boost pads? They speed you up but tend to be in dangerous 
locations.
●
●
Hit the gas early? If you hit the gas early at the starting line, you get a speed 
boost if you time it right, and a frustrating delay if you time it wrong.
●
●
Left or right? Many tracks include forking tracks that have a low-risk and high-
risk path—and of course the high-risk path has more speed boosts.
Balancing Type #4: Skill vs. Chance
In Chapter 12, we talked in detail about the mechanics of skill and chance. In a 
real sense, these are two opposing forces in any game design. Too much chance 
negates the effects of player skill and vice versa. There is no easy answer for 
this one—some players prefer games with as few elements of chance as possible, 
and other players prefer the opposite. Games of skill tend to be more like athletic 
contests—systems of judgment that determine which player is the best. Games of 
chance often have a more relaxed, casual nature—after all, much of the outcome 
is up to fate. To strike the balance, you must use Lens #19, The Player, to under­
stand how much skill and how much chance will be the right amount for the 
audience of your game. Differences in preference are sometimes determined by 
age or gender, and sometimes even by culture; for example, German board game 
players seem to prefer games that minimize the effects of chance more so than, 
say, American players.
One very common method of balancing these is to alternate the use of chance 
and skill in a game. For example, dealing out a hand of cards is pure chance—
but choosing how to play them is pure skill. Rolling a die to see how far you 
move is pure chance—deciding where to move your piece is pure skill. This can 
create an alternating pattern of tension and relaxation that can be very pleasing 
to players.
Designer David Perry advises that the key to addictive game design is designing 
your game such that players are doing three things at all times: exercising a skill, 
taking risks, and working a strategy. And it is certainly true that any time players 
are taking risks, they are up against chance, in some way.
Choosing how to balance skill and chance will determine the character of your 
game. Examine it closely with this lens.

215
The Twelve Most Common Types of Game Balance
Balancing Type #5: Head vs. Hands
This type of balancing is quite straightforward: how much of the game should 
involve doing a challenging physical activity (be it steering, throwing, or push­
ing buttons dexterously), and how much of it should involve thinking? These 
two things are not as separate as they might seem on the surface—many games 
involve constant strategizing and puzzle solving while simultaneously pulling off 
feats of speed and dexterity. Other games alternate the two types of gameplay for 
variety. Consider the “action platform” game genre—you work your way through 
a level, dexterously guiding your avatar to jump over obstacles, and maybe shoot­
ing at enemies, occasionally pausing to solve some small puzzle that prevents you 
from clearing the level. Often, the intensity is increased at the end of a level by a 
“boss monster,” who can only be defeated through a mix of puzzle solving (“Oh! 
I have to jump on his tail, and that makes him drop his shield for a second!”) and 
dexterity (“I only have a second to shoot an arrow into that narrow gap!”).
It is important, though, to understand what your target market prefers in a game—
more thinking or more dexterity? And it is equally important that your game clearly 
communicate what balance you have chosen to put into it. Consider the very unusual 
game Pac-Man 2: The New Adventures for the Sega Genesis. The name suggested that 
it would be a game of action and a little strategy, like the original Pac-Man. But a 
quick glance at the box told another story—this appeared to be a 2D platform game, 
like Super Mario Brothers or Sonic the Hedgehog, which meant action plus a little 
puzzle solving. But actually playing the game revealed something completely differ­
ent! Though it visually looked like an action platform game, it was really a game of 
strange psychological puzzles, where you subtly guided Pac-Man into different emo­
tional states to get him to get past various obstacles. Players expecting mostly action 
and little thinking were disappointed—players looking for a game about puzzle solv­
ing generally didn’t play the game, rejecting it based on its “action-based” appearance.
Lens #41: The Lens of Skill vs. Chance
To help determine how to balance skill and chance in your game, ask yourself 
these questions:
●
●
Are my players here to be judged (skill) or to take risks (chance)?
●
●
Skill tends to be more serious than chance: is my game serious or casual?
●
●
Are parts of my game tedious? If so, will adding elements of chance 
enliven them?
●
●
Do parts of my game feel too random? If so, will replacing elements of chance 
with elements of skill or strategy make the players feel more in control?

216
CHAPTER Thirteen • GAME MECHANICS MUST BE IN BALANCE
When Games Magazine reviews a videogame, they give it a ranking on a slid­
ing scale where one end is “fingers” and the other end is “brain.” It can be easy to 
forget that a game with a lot of button pushing can still involve a lot of thought and 
strategy. Use Lens #34, Skill, to understand the different skills in your game, and 
then use this lens to balance those skills.
Balance Type #6: Competition vs. Cooperation
Competition and cooperation are basic, animal urges. All higher animals are driven 
to compete against others partly for survival and partly to establish their status in 
the community. Opposite of that, there is also a basic instinct to cooperate with oth­
ers, since a team, with its many eyes and hands and its diverse abilities, is always 
more powerful than an individual. Competition and cooperation are so important 
to our survival that we need to experiment with them—partly to get better at them 
and partly to learn about our friends and family—so we get a better sense of who 
is good at what and how we can work together. Games provide a very socially safe 
way to explore how the people around us behave in stressful situations—this is a 
secret reason we like to play games together.
When it comes to games, competitive games are more common than cooper­
ative ones, though some very interesting cooperative games have been created. 
Cookie and Cream for the PlayStation 2 is an action platform puzzle game where two

Yogi Berra once said, “Baseball is 90% mental. The other half is physical.” To 
make sure your game has a more realistic balance of mental and physical ele­
ments, use the Lens of Head and Hands. Ask yourself these questions:
●
●
Are my players looking for mindless action or an intellectual challenge?
●
●
Would adding more places that involve puzzle solving in my game make it 
more interesting?
●
●
Are there places where the player can relax their brain and just play the 
game without thinking?
●
●
Can I give the player a choice—succeed either by exercising a high level 
of dexterity or by finding a clever strategy that works with a minimum of 
physical skill?
●
●
If “1” means all physical and “10” means all mental, what number would 
my game get?
This lens works particularly well when used in conjunction with Lens #19, 
The Player.

217
The Twelve Most Common Types of Game Balance
players play side by side on parallel paths trying to get through a level. And Reiner 
Knizia’s Lord of the Rings board game is a fascinating example of a game where the 
players do not compete at all, but instead coordinate their efforts in an attempt to 
win the game together.
Some games find interesting ways to blend competition and cooperation. The 
arcade game Joust can be played solo, where a player competes against many 
computer-controlled enemies, or it can be played in a two-player mode, where both 
players compete against enemies together in the same arena. There is a tension 
between competition and cooperation in Joust that is very interesting: On the com­
petitive side, the players get points based on how many enemies they defeat, and 
they can battle each other if they choose. But on the cooperative side, players can 
get higher scores overall if they coordinate their attacks and protect each other. It is 
up to the players to decide whether they are trying to beat each other (getting the 
highest relative score) or trying to beat the game (trying to get the highest absolute 
score). The game plays up this tension: some levels are designated “Team Wave”—if 
both players can survive the level, they each get 3000 bonus points. Other levels are 
designated “Gladiator Wave”—the first player who defeats another gets 3000 bonus 
points. This interesting alternation between cooperation and competition gives the 
game a lot of variety and lets players explore whether their partner is more inter­
ested in cooperation or competition.
And while competition and cooperation are polar opposites, they can be quite 
conveniently combined into a situation where you get the best of both. How? 
Through team competition! Common in athletic sports, the rise of networked gam­
ing has allowed team competition to grow and thrive in the world of videogames.
Competition and cooperation are so important that we need three lenses to 
examine them properly.
Lens #43: The Lens of Competition
Determining who is most skilled at something is a basic human urge. Games 
of competition can satisfy that urge. Use this lens to be sure your competitive 
game makes people want to win it. Ask yourself these questions:
●
●
Does my game give a fair measurement of player skill?
●
●
Do people want to win my game? Why?
●
●
Is winning this game something people can be proud of? Why?
●
●
Can novices meaningfully compete at my game?
●
●
Can experts meaningfully compete at my game?
●

CHAPTER Thirteen • GAME MECHANICS MUST BE IN BALANCE
As more and more games go online, more opportunities for different types of 
competition and collaboration become available, from casual multiplayer games of 
chess between two people to competing guilds of thousands of players in MMORPGs. 
But the psychological forces that drive us to enjoy competition and cooperation have 
not changed—the better you can understand and balance these forces, the stronger 
your game will become.
Lens #45: The Lens of Competition vs. Cooperation
Balancing competition and cooperation can be done in many interesting ways. 
Use this lens to decide whether they are balanced properly in your game. Ask 
these questions:
●
●
 If “1” is competition and “10” is cooperation, what number should my 
game get?
●
●
 Can I give players a choice whether to play cooperatively or competitively?
●
●
 Does my audience prefer competition, cooperation, or a mix?
●
●
 Is team competition something that makes sense for my game? Is my game 
more fun with team competition or with solo competition?
Lens #44: The Lens of Cooperation
Collaborating and succeeding as a team is a special pleasure that can create 
lasting social bonds. Use this lens to study the cooperative aspects of your 
game. Ask these questions:
●
●
Cooperation requires communication. Do my players have enough oppor­
tunity to communicate? How could communication be enhanced?
●
●
Are my players friends already, or are they strangers? If they are strangers, 
can I help them break the ice?
●
●
Is there synergy (2 + 2 = 5) or antergy (2 + 2 = 3) when the players work 
together? Why?
●
●
Do all the players have the same role, or do they have special jobs?
●
●
Cooperation is greatly enhanced when there is no way an individual can do 
a task alone. Does my game have tasks like that?
●
●
Tasks that force communication inspire cooperation. Do any of my tasks 
force communication?

The Twelve Most Common Types of Game Balance
Balance Type #7: Short vs. Long
One important thing to balance in every game is the length of the gameplay. If the 
game is too short, players may not get a chance to develop and execute meaningful 
strategies. But if the game goes on too long, players may grow bored, or they may 
avoid the game because playing it requires too much of a time commitment.
The things that determine the length of a game are often subtle. The game of 
Monopoly, for example, when played by the official rules, often ends in about ninety 
minutes. But many players find these rules too harsh and modify them to give out 
cash jackpots and ease the restrictions on when you must purchase properties, which 
as a side effect makes the game last much longer, typically three hours, or even more.
The main factors that determine when a game ends are the win or lose condi­
tions. By altering these conditions, you can dramatically change the length of the 
game. The designers of the arcade game Spy Hunter came up with a very interest­
ing system to balance the length of their game. In Spy Hunter, you drive a car that 
fires machine guns at enemies on a highway. In early prototypes, when your car 
was destroyed three times, the game was over. The game is very challenging, par­
ticularly for novice players, and the designers found that these players were having 
very short games and feeling frustrated—so they introduced a new rule: For the first 
ninety seconds of gameplay, the player has an unlimited supply of cars—they can­
not lose the game during this time. After that time is up, they only have a few cars, 
and when they are destroyed, the game is over.
The designers of Minotaur (who later went on to make Halo) had another inter­
esting method of balancing the length of their game. Minotaur was a networked 
game where up to four players would run around a maze, gathering weapons and 
spells, and try to destroy the other players in the maze. The game ends when only 
one player is left alive. The designers saw a problem where a stalemate could result 
if players don’t confront each other and the game would run the risk of becoming 
boring. One way to solve the problem would be to set a time limit and declare a win­
ner based on a point system, but instead they did something much more elegant. 
They created a new rule: after twenty minutes, a bell sounds, and “Armageddon” 
begins; all surviving players are suddenly transported to a small room filled with 
monsters and other hazards, where no one can survive for long. This way, the game 
is guaranteed to end in less than twenty five minutes, in a rather dramatic fashion, 
and one player can still be declared the winner.
Balance Type #8: Rewards
A prince should be quick to reward and slow to punish.
—Ovid
Why is it that people will spend so much time playing a videogame, just to get a 
good score? We have talked earlier about how games become structures of judgment 

220
CHAPTER Thirteen • GAME MECHANICS MUST BE IN BALANCE
and that people want to be judged. But people don’t just want any judgment—they 
want to be judged favorably. Rewards are the way the game tells the player “you 
have done well.”
There are several common types of rewards that games tend to give. Each is 
different, but they all have one thing in common—they fulfill the player’s desires.
●
●
Praise: The simplest of rewards, the game just tells you that you did good work, 
through either an explicit statement, a special sound effect, or even an in-game 
character speaking to you. It all amounts to the same thing: the game has judged 
you, and it approves. Nintendo games are famous for giving players lots of sec­
ondary praise via sounds and animations for every reward they get.
●
●
Points: In many games, points serve no purpose than a measure of the play­
er’s success, be it through skill or luck. Sometimes these points are a gateway 
to another reward, but often, this measurement of your success is enough—
particularly if others can see it on a high score list.
●
●
Prolonged play: In many games (pinball, for example), the goal of the game is to 
risk resources (in pinball, your ball) to rack up as many points as possible with­
out losing what you have put at risk (your ball down the drain). In games with 
this structure of “lives,” the most valuable reward a player can get is an extra 
life. Other games that have time limits reward players by adding time to their 
play session, which really amounts to the same thing. Prolonged play is desirable 
because it allows for a higher score and a measure of success, but it also taps into 
our natural human drive for survival. Modern free to play games have a slight 
twist on this with the “energy” model. Run out of energy, and play is paused 
until you pay for more or until a certain number of hours pass.
●
●
A gateway: While we have a desire to be judged favorably, we also have a desire 
to explore. Game structures that reward success by moving you to new parts of 
the game satisfy this basic urge. Anytime you earn access to a new level or win 
a key to a locked door, you have received a gateway reward.
●
●
Spectacle: We like to enjoy beautiful and interesting things. Often, games will 
play music or show animations as a simple reward. The “intermission” at the end 
of level 2 in Pac-Man was probably the first example of this in a videogame. This 
kind of reward seldom satisfies players on its own, so it tends to be paired with 
other types of rewards.
●
●
Expression: Many players like to express themselves within a game with special 
clothes or decorations. Even though these often have nothing to do with a goal 
in the game, they can be great fun for a player and satisfy a basic urge to make 
a mark on the world.
●
●
Powers: Becoming more powerful is something that everyone desires in real 
life, and in a game, becoming more powerful is likely to improve the game’s 
judgment of a player’s success. These powers can come in many forms: getting 
“kinged” in checkers, becoming tall in Super Mario World, speeding up in Sonic 

221
The Twelve Most Common Types of Game Balance
the Hedgehog, and getting special weaponry in Call of Duty. The thing all pow­
ers have in common is that they give you a way to reach your goal more quickly 
than you could before.
●
●
Resources: While casino games and lotteries reward the player with real money, 
videogames more frequently reward the player with resources they can only use 
in the game (e.g., food, energy, ammunition, hit points). Some games, instead 
of giving resources directly, give virtual money that the player can choose how 
to spend. Usually the things that one can buy with this money are resources, 
powers, prolonged play, or expression. Free to play games, of course, blur this 
distinction by letting you spend real money to get virtual money (but almost 
never the other way around).
●
●
Status: High leaderboard rankings, special achievements, or anything else that 
gives a player higher status in the community of players can be very desirable 
award, especially to competitive players.
●
●
Completion: Completing all the goals in a game gives a special feeling of closure 
to players that they seldom get from solving problems in real life. In many games, 
this is the ultimate reward—when you have reached this point, there is often no 
point in playing the game any further.
Most of the rewards you will encounter in games fall into one or more of the afore­
mentioned categories, though these categories are often combined in interesting 
ways. Many games reward the player with points, but when the points reach a cer­
tain score, the player gets a bonus reward of an extra life (resource, prolonged play). 
Often, players will get a special item (resource) that lets them do something new 
(powers). Other games let a player enter their name or draw a picture (expression) if 
they get a high score (points). Some games show a special animation (spectacle) at 
the end (completion) if the player unlocks every area in the game (gateway).
But how to balance these rewards? That is, how many should be given out, and 
which ones? This is a difficult question, and the answer is different for almost every 
game. Generally, the more types of rewards you can work into your game, the better. 
Two other reward rules of thumb from the world of psychology include the following:
●
●
People have a tendency to get acclimated to rewards the more they receive them, 
and what was rewarding an hour ago is no big deal now. One simple method many 
games use to overcome this is to gradually increase the value of the rewards as the 
player progresses in the game. In a way, this is a cheesy trick, but it works—even 
when you know the designer is doing it and why, it still feels very rewarding to 
suddenly get bigger rewards in conjunction with getting to a new part of a game.
●
●
The power of variable rewards over fixed ones has been proven in thousands of 
psychological experiments. For example, if every monster you defeat gives you 
ten points, that gets predictable and boring pretty quickly—but if every monster 
you defeat has a 2/3 chance of giving you zero points, but a 1/3 chance of giving 
you thirty points, this stays rewarding for a much longer time, even though you 

222
CHAPTER Thirteen • GAME MECHANICS MUST BE IN BALANCE
are giving out the same number of points on average. It’s like bringing donuts 
to work—if you bring them every Friday, people will come to expect them and 
take them for granted. But if you bring them every now and then on random 
days, they are a delightful surprise each time. Part of what makes triangularity 
so interesting to players is its connection to variable reward.
Balance Type #9: Punishment
The idea of a game that punishes the player can seem a little strange—aren’t games 
supposed to be fun? Paradoxically, though, punishment used properly can increase 
the enjoyment that players get from games. Here are some reasons that a game 
might punish players:
●
●
Punishment creates endogenous value: We’ve talked about the importance of 
creating value within a game (Lens #7, Endogenous Value). Resources in a game 
are worth more if there is a chance they can be taken away.
Lens #46: The Lens of Reward
Everyone likes to be told they are doing a good job. Ask these questions to 
determine if your game is giving out the right rewards in the right amounts 
at the right times:
●
●
What rewards is my game giving out now? Can it give out others as well?
●
●
Are players excited when they get rewards in my game, or are they bored 
by them? Why?
●
●
Getting a reward you don’t understand is like getting no reward at all. Do 
my players understand the rewards they are getting?
●
●
Are the rewards my game gives out too regular? Can they be given out in a 
more variable way?
●
●
How are my rewards related to one another? Is there a way that they could 
be better connected?
●
●
How are my rewards building? Too fast, too slow, or just right?
Balancing rewards is different for every game. Not only does a designer have 
to worry about giving out the right ones, but he have to worry about giving 
them at the right times in the right amounts. This can only be determined 
through trial and error—even then, it probably won’t be right for everyone. 
When trying to balance rewards, it is hard to be perfect—you often have to 
settle for “good enough.”

223
The Twelve Most Common Types of Game Balance
●
●
Taking risks is exciting: Particularly if the potential rewards are balanced 
against the risks! But you can only take risks if there are negative consequences 
or punishments. Giving players a chance to risk terrible consequences makes 
success much, much sweeter.
●
●
Possible punishment increases challenge: We’ve discussed the importance of 
challenging players—when failure means a punishing setback in the game, the 
challenge of play increases. Increasing the punishment that comes with failure 
can be one way to increase the challenge.
Here are some common types of punishment used in games. Many of them are 
simply rewards in reverse.
●
●
Shaming: The opposite of praise, this is simply the game telling you that you 
are doing a bad job. This can happen with explicit messages (e.g., “Missed” or 
“Defeated!”) or with discouraging animations, sound effects, and music.
●
●
Loss of points: Players find this type of punishment so painful that it is relatively 
rare in videogames or even in traditional games and sports. Maybe it is less an 
issue of it being painful and more of the fact that when players can lose points, 
it cheapens the value of the earned points. Points that can’t be taken away are 
very valuable—points that could be subtracted on the next bad move have less 
endogenous value.
●
●
Shortened play: “Losing a life” in a game is an example of this kind of punish­
ment. Some games that work on a timer will shorten play by taking time off the 
clock.
●
●
Terminated play: Game over, man.
●
●
Setback: When, after dying, a game returns you to the start of a level, or to 
the last checkpoint, this is a setback punishment. In games that are all about 
proceeding to the end, a setback is a very logical punishment. The balancing 
challenge is to figure out exactly where the checkpoints belong to make the pun­
ishments seem meaningful, but not unreasonable.
●
●
Removal of powers: The designer must tread carefully here—players greatly trea­
sure the powers they have earned, and to have them taken away may feel unfair 
to them. In Ultima Online, players who were killed in battle turned into ghosts. To 
come back to life, they had to find their way to a shrine. If they took too long getting 
there, they would lose valuable skill points that had taken weeks to earn. Many play­
ers felt this was too harsh a punishment. One way to remove powers fairly is to take 
them away temporarily. Some amusement parks feature bumper car battle tanks 
that shoot tennis balls at each other. The tanks have targets on each side, and if an 
opponent hits one of your targets with a tennis ball, your tank goes into an uncon­
trolled spin for five seconds and your gun becomes inoperable during that time.
●
●
Resource depletion: Loss of money, goods, ammunition, shields, or hit 
points fall into this category. This is one of the most common types of game 
punishment.

224
CHAPTER Thirteen • GAME MECHANICS MUST BE IN BALANCE
One thing that psychological study has shown is that reward is always a better 
tool for reinforcement than punishment. Whenever possible, if you need to encour­
age a player to do something, it is better to use a reward than a punishment, if you 
can. One great example from Blizzard’s game Diablo is the business of gathering 
food in games. Many game designers at one time or another get the idea that they 
would like to make a game with a “realistic” system of food gathering. That is, if 
you do not gather food, your character suffers from diminished powers because 
of hunger. Blizzard implemented this and found that players considered it a nui­
sance—they must perform a fairly boring activity or suffer a penalty. So, Blizzard 
turned it around and implemented a system where your player never gets hungry, 
but if they do eat food, they get a temporary boost in abilities. Players liked this 
much better. By changing a punishment into a reward, they were able to turn the 
same activity from a negative to a positive.
When punishment is necessary, however, how much to use is a delicate ques­
tion. When developing Toontown Online, we had to face the question of what was 
to be the harshest punishment in a light, fun MMORPG for kids. We ultimately 
decided on a combination of light punishments for “dying,” which in Toontown is 
called “becoming sad,” for the game is so lighthearted that players do not have a life 
meter, but rather a laff meter, and the enemy’s goal is not to kill the player outright, 
but just to make him sad enough to stop acting like a cartoon character. When your 
laff meter goes to zero in Toontown, these things happen:
●
●
You are teleported from the battle area back to a playground zone (setback). This 
setback is very minor—the distance is usually only a minute’s walk.
●
●
All the items you are carrying disappear (resource depletion). This is also minor—
the items are inexpensive and can be earned again in about 10 minutes of play.
●
●
Your character hangs his or her head sadly (shame).
●
●
For about 30 seconds, your character walks at a painfully slow pace and is unable 
to leave the playground zone or engage in any meaningful gameplay (temporary 
removal of powers).
●
●
Your laff meter (hit points) goes to zero (resource depletion), and the player will 
probably want to wait for it to increase (it increases over time in a playground 
zone) before exploring again.
This combination of light punishments is just enough to make players use cau­
tion in battles. We tried lighter versions, and it made battles boring—there was no 
risk in them. We tried tougher versions, and it made players too cautious in battles. 
Eventually we settled on a combination that struck an appropriate balance between 
encouraging caution and risk in the players.
It is crucial that all punishment in a game is for things that the player is able 
to understand and prevent. When punishment feels random and unstoppable, it 
makes the player feel a complete lack of control, which is a very bad feeling, and the 

225
The Twelve Most Common Types of Game Balance
player will quickly label the game “unfair.” Once this happens, a player is seldom 
willing to engage in a game further.
Players dislike punishment, of course, and you must be thoughtful about whether 
there are tricky ways that players can avoid your punishment. Richard Garriott’s 
game Ultima III, though greatly beloved, contained very strict punishment. It was a 
game that took close to hundred hours to complete, and if your four characters per­
ished while you were playing, your game state was completely erased, and you had 
to begin the game again! Players generally felt this was unfair, and as a result, it was 
common practice if your characters were near death to shut off the computer before 
the game had a chance to erase the saved game, effectively dodging the punishment.
It is worth mentioning that there is a certain class of player that lives for games 
that are insanely challenging and loves games that have strong punishments (cough, 
Demon Souls, cough), because they can feel so proud about having beaten such a dif­
ficult game. These players are a fringe group, though, and even they have their limits. 
They will quickly call a game “unfair” if they cannot see how to prevent punishment.
Balance Type #10: Freedom vs. Controlled Experience
Games are interactive, and the point of interactivity is to give the player control, 
or freedom, over the experience. But how much control? Giving the player con­
trol over everything is not only more work for the game developer; it can also 
be boring for the player! After all, a game isn’t meant to be a simulation of real 
life, but rather more interesting than real life—this sometimes means cutting 
out boring, complex, or unnecessary decisions and actions. One simple kind 
Lens #47: The Lens of Punishment
Punishment must be used delicately, since after all, players are in a game of 
their own free will. Balanced appropriately, it will give everything in your 
game more meaning, and players will have a real sense of pride when they 
succeed at your game. To examine the punishment in your game, ask yourself 
these questions:
●
●
What are the punishments in my game?
●
●
Why am I punishing the players? What do I hope to achieve by it?
●
●
Do my punishments seem fair to the players? Why or why not?
●
●
Is there a way to turn these punishments into rewards and get the same or 
a better effect?
●
●
Are my strong punishments balanced against commensurately strong 
rewards?

226
CHAPTER Thirteen • GAME MECHANICS MUST BE IN BALANCE
of game balance that every designer must consider is where to give the player 
freedom and how much freedom to give.
In Aladdin’s Magic Carpet VR Adventure, we were faced with a very difficult 
problem in the final scene within the Cave of Wonders. To make the conflict with 
Jafar, the villain, be as exciting as possible, we needed to take control of the cam­
era. But we didn’t want to compromise the freedom that players felt in the scene. 
Observing players during playtests, though, they all wanted to do the same thing—
fly to the top of the hill where Jafar was standing. After several experiments, we 
made a bold decision—we would take away freedom from the players in this scene 
so they could have a perfect flight up the hill to confront Jafar. This was in sharp 
contrast to the rest of the experience, where players could fly wherever they wanted 
with no restrictions. In our tests, not a single one of our playtesters noticed we had 
taken away their freedom, because the game had trained them that they could go 
wherever they wanted and this scene happened to be arranged such that everyone 
who viewed it wanted the same thing. We decided that this was a case where the 
balance should fall on the side of controlled experience instead of freedom, because 
it made for a better experience for the player.
Balance Type #11: Simple vs. Complex
It seems that perfection is reached not when there is nothing left to add, but 
when there is nothing left to take away.
—Antoine de Saint-Exupery
Simplicity and complexity of game mechanics can seem very paradoxical. Calling 
a game “simple” can be a criticism, such as “so simple it is boring.” It can also 
be a compliment: “so simple and elegant!” Complexity can also be a double-
edged sword. Games are criticized as “overly complex and confusing” or com­
plimented as “richly and intricately complex.” To make sure your game has the 
“good simplicity” and the “good complexity,” but not the bad, we need to look 
at the nature of simplicity and complexity in games and how to strike the right 
balance between them.
So much praise is heaped on classic games for being ingeniously simple that it 
might make you think that making a complex game is a bad thing. Let’s look at the 
different kinds of complexity that show up in games:
●
●
Innate complexity: When the very rules of the game get very complex, I call this 
innate complexity. This is the kind of complexity that often gets a bad name. It 
generally arises either because the designer is trying to simulate a complex real-
world situation or because extra rules need to be added to a game in order to 
balance it. When you see a ruleset with lots of “exception cases,” this is generally 
a ruleset that is innately complex. Games like this can be hard to learn, but some 
people really enjoy mastering the complex rulesets.

227
The Twelve Most Common Types of Game Balance
●
●
Emergent complexity: This is the kind of complexity that everyone praises. Just as 
the simple structure of H2O lets myriad complex snowflakes appear, games like Go 
have a very simple rulesets that give rise to billions of intricate, complex game situ­
ations. We call this emergent complexity: when games are praised for being simple 
and complex at the same time, it is the emergent complexity that is being praised.
Emergent complexity can be difficult to achieve, but is worth the effort. Ideally, 
one can create a simple ruleset out of which emerges the thing every game designer 
strives for: balanced surprises. If you can design a simple game that becomes a fac­
tory for a never-ending stream of balanced surprises, people will play your game 
for centuries to come. The only way to find out whether you have achieved this is 
to keep playing and changing your game over and over until the surprises start to 
come. Of course, using Lens #30, Emergence, can help, too.
So, if emergent complexity is so great, why would anyone make a game that is 
innately complex? Well, sometimes you need the innate complexity to simulate a 
real-world situation, such as re-creating a historical battle. Other times, you add 
more innate complexity to balance your game a little better. The pawns in chess 
have movement rules that are innately complex: when they move, they can only 
move forward one square, into an unoccupied space, unless it is their first move, 
in which case they can move one or two spaces. One exception to this is when 
they are capturing another piece; in that case, they can only move diagonally 
forward, but only one square, even if it is their first move.
This rule has some innate complexity (some keywords of innate complexity: 
“unless,” “except,” “exception,” “but,” and “even if”), but it is one that evolved grad­
ually in an attempt to make sure pawns had a behavior that was well balanced and 
interesting. And, in fact, it is well worth it, for this small amount of innate complex­
ity blossoms into a great deal more emergent complexity—particularly because the 
pawns can only move forward but capture diagonally—that leads to fascinatingly 
complex pawn structures that can form on the board that would never be possible 
with a simpler ruleset.
Lens #48: The Lens of Simplicity/Complexity
Striking the right balance between simplicity and complexity is difficult and 
must be done for the right reasons. Use this lens to help your game become 
one in which meaningful complexity arises out of a simple system. Ask your­
self these questions:
●
●
What elements of innate complexity do I have in my game?
●
●
Is there a way this innate complexity could be turned into emergent complexity?
●
●
Do elements of emergent complexity arise from my game? If not, why not?
●
●
Are there elements of my game that are too simple?

228
CHAPTER Thirteen • GAME MECHANICS MUST BE IN BALANCE
Natural vs. Artificial Balancing
Designers must be careful when adding innate complexity in an attempt to balance 
a game, however. Adding too many rules to get the behavior you want is sometimes 
called “artificial balancing” as opposed to the “natural balancing” that can come 
when a desired effect arises naturally from the interactions in a game. Consider 
Space Invaders: it has a wonderful balance of increasing difficulty that forms very 
naturally. The invaders adhere to a very simple rule—the fewer there are, the faster 
they go. From this, some very desirable properties emerge:
	1.	 The game starts slow and speeds up the more the player succeeds.
	2.	 It is easy to hit targets in the beginning, but the more the player succeeds, the 
harder it is to hit targets.
Those two properties are not the result of innate rules, but rather nicely balanced 
properties that emerge from a single simple rule.
Elegance
We call simple systems that perform robustly in complex situations elegant. Elegance 
is one of the most desirable qualities in any game, because it means you have a 
game that is simple to learn and understand but is full of interesting emergent 
complexity. And while elegance can seem somewhat ineffable and hard to capture, 
you can easily rate the elegance of a given game element by counting the number 
of purposes it has. For example, the dots in Pac-Man serve the following purposes:
	1.	 They give the player a short-term goal: “Eat the dots close to me.”
	2.	 They give the player a long-term goal: “Clear all the dots from the board.”
	3.	 They slow the player down slightly when eating them, creating good triangular­
ity (safer to go down a corridor with no dots, riskier to go down one with dots).
	4.	 They give the player points, which are a measure of success.
	5.	 They give the player points, which can earn an extra life.
Five different purposes, just for those simple dots! This makes them very ele­
gant. You can imagine a version of Pac-Man where the dots did not do all those 
things; for example, if the dots didn’t slow the player down and didn’t award points 
or extra lives, they would have less purpose and be less elegant. There is an old 
Hollywood rule of thumb: if a line in a script doesn’t serve at least two purposes, 
it should be cut. Many designers, when they find their game doesn’t feel right, first 
think, “Hmm… what do I need to add?” Often, a better question is, “What do I need 
to remove?” One thing I like to do is look for all the things in my game that are only 
serving one purpose and think about which of them can be combined.

229
The Twelve Most Common Types of Game Balance
In working on Pirates of the Caribbean: Battle for the Buccaneer Gold, we origi­
nally planned to have two main characters: a friendly host at the start of the game, 
whose only job was to explain how to play, and a villain at the end of the game, 
whose only purpose was to engage in a dramatic final battle. This was a short 
(five minutes) game for Disneyworld, and it felt strange to have to use up time to 
introduce both of these two characters, and it was a strain on the budget as well to 
make them both look good. We started talking about just cutting either the tutorial 
at the beginning or the battle at the end, but they were both very important for a 
fulfilling game. Then we hit on an idea: what if the host at the beginning also was 
the villain at the end? This not only saved us development time but saved game 
time since we only needed to introduce one character. Further, it made the character 
seem more interesting and a more credible pirate (since he tricks the player), and it 
also created a surprising plot twist! By giving this one character several purposes, 
it made for a game structure we felt was very elegant indeed.
Character
As important as elegance is, though, there is such a thing as honing a thing down 
too far. Consider the leaning tower of Pisa. Its significant tilt serves no purpose—it 
is an accidental flaw. The Lens of Elegance would have us remove its tilt and turn it 
into the perfectly straight tower of Pisa. But who would want to visit that? It might 
be elegant, but it would be boring—it would have no character. Think of the tokens 
in Monopoly: a hat, a shoe, a dog, a statue, and a battleship. They have nothing to 
do with a game about real estate. Arguably, they should be themed as little land­
lords. But no one would do that, because it would strip Monopoly of its character. 
Why is Mario a plumber? It has almost nothing to do with what he does or the world 
he lives in. But this weird inconsistency gives him character.
Lens #49: The Lens of Elegance
Most “classic games” are considered to be masterpieces of elegance. Use this 
lens to make your game as elegant as possible. Ask yourself these questions:
●
●
What are the elements of my game?
●
●
What are the purposes of each element? Count these up to give the element 
an “elegance rating.”
●
●
For elements with only one or two purposes, can some of these be com­
bined into each other or removed altogether?
●
●
For elements with several purposes, is it possible for them to take on even 
more?

CHAPTER Thirteen • GAME MECHANICS MUST BE IN BALANCE
Balance Type #12: Detail vs. Imagination
As we discussed in Chapter 10, the game is not the experience—games are simply 
structures that engender mental models in the mind of the player. In doing so, 
the games provide some level of detail but leave it to the player to fill in the rest. 
Deciding exactly what details should be provided and which should be left to the 
player’s imagination is a different but important kind of balance to strike. Here are 
some tips for how to do it well.
●
●
Only detail what you can do well: Players have rich, detailed imaginations. If 
there is something you need to present that is of lower quality than your players 
will be able to imagine, don’t do it—let the imagination do the heavy lifting! Let’s 
say you would like to play recorded dialog for your whole game, but you don’t 
have the budget for quality voice actors or you don’t have the storage space for all 
that dialog. An engineer might suggest trying speech synthesis, that is, letting 
the computer speak for the characters. After all, it is cheap, requires no storage 
space, and can be tuned somewhat to sound like different characters, right? All 
that is true—but also, it will make everyone sound like a robot, and unless you 
are making a game about robots, your players will not be able to take it seriously. 
An even cheaper alternative is to use subtitles. Some people might claim that this 
means there is no voice at all! But that isn’t true. The player’s imagination will 
fill in a voice—a voice far better than the one you will be able to synthesize. This 
same idea goes for just about everything in the game: scenery, sound effects, 
characters, animations, and special effects. If you can’t do it well, try to find a 
way to leave it to the player’s imagination.
●
●
Give details the imagination can use: Players have a lot to learn when they 
come to a new game—any clear details you can give them that make the game 
easier to understand will be welcome. Consider the game of chess. It is mostly 
a somewhat abstract game, but some interesting details have been filled in. 
Lens #50: The Lens of Character
Elegance and character are opposites. They are like miniature versions of sim­
plicity and complexity and must be kept in balance. To make sure your game 
has lovable, defining quirks, ask yourself these questions:
●
●
 Is there anything strange in my game that players talk about excitedly?
●
●
 Does my game have funny qualities that make it unique?
●
●
 Does my game have flaws that players like?

231
The Twelve Most Common Types of Game Balance
The game is set in a medieval era, and the pieces, which easily could have 
been numbered or just made as abstract shapes, are given the roles of people 
in a medieval court. It isn’t a lot of detail—the kings, for example, don’t have 
names, and we know nothing about their kingdoms or their policies—but 
none of that matters. In fact, if this were to be a real simulation of an army 
between two kingdoms, the rules of movement and capture would make no 
sense at all! What matters about the “kings” in chess is that the tallest of the 
chess pieces has movements that are slightly evocative of a real king. He is 
important and must move slowly and must be carefully guarded. Any other 
details can be left to the imaginations of the players to fill in as they see fit. 
Similarly, picturing the “knights” as horses helps us remember that they can 
jump around the board in ways the others cannot. By giving details that help 
our imaginations better grasp their functionality, the game becomes much 
more accessible to us.
●
●
Familiar worlds do not need much detail: If you are creating a simulation of 
something that the player is likely to know very well, such as a city street or 
a house interior, you have little need to simulate every little detail—since the 
player already knows what these places are like, they will quickly fill them in 
with imagination, if you give them a few relevant details. If the point of your 
game, though, is to educate someone about a place they have never been before, 
imagination will be of little help, and you will find it necessary to fill in a great 
deal of detail.
●
●
Use the binocular effect: When spectators bring binoculars to an opera or a 
sporting event, they use them mostly at the beginning of the event, to get a close-
up view of the different players or performers. Once this close-up view has been 
put into memory, the glasses can be set aside, for now the imagination goes to 
work, filling in the close-ups on the tiny distant figures. Videogames replicate 
this effect all the time, often by showing a close-up of a character at the begin­
ning of the game who is going to be an inch-high sprite for the rest of the experi­
ence. It is an easy way to use a little detail to get a lot of imagination.
●
●
Give details that inspire imagination: Again, chess is a great example. To be 
able to control all the members of a royal army is a fantasy that the mind quickly 
takes to—and of course, it is a fantasy—it only has to be tied to reality by a thin 
thread. Giving players situations they can easily fantasize about lets their imagi­
nation take wing, and all kinds of imaginary details will quickly crystallize 
around one little detail that the designer provided.
We will talk more about the balance between detail and imagination in 
Chapter 20, “Characters,” since deciding what to leave to the imagination is a 
key question when it comes to characters in games. Because the imagination 
of the player is where the gameplaying experience takes place, the Lens of 
Imagination is an important tool.

CHAPTER Thirteen • GAME MECHANICS MUST BE IN BALANCE
Game Balancing Methodologies
We have discussed a great number of things that can be balanced within games. 
Let us now turn our attention to general methods of balancing that can be 
broadly applied to many types of balancing. You may find you can use some of 
these together, but others are contradictory—this is because different designers 
prefer different methods. You must experiment to find the method that is right 
for you.
●
●
Use the Lens of the Problem Statement: Earlier, we discussed the importance 
of clearly stating your design problems before jumping to solutions. An out-of-
balance game is a problem that will benefit greatly from a clear problem state­
ment. Many designers end up making a mess of their games by jumping in with 
balancing solutions before they have thought clearly about what the problem 
really is.
●
●
Doubling and halving:
You never know what is enough unless you know what is more than enough.
—William Blake, Proverbs of Hell
Lens #51: The Lens of Imagination
All games have some element of imagination and some element of connection 
to reality. Use this lens to help find the balance between detail and imagina­
tion. Ask yourself these questions:
●
●
What must the player understand to play my game?
●
●
Can some element of imagination help them understand that better?
●
●
What high-quality, realistic details can we provide in this game?
●
●
What details would be low quality if we provided them? Can imagination 
fill the gap instead?
●
●
Can I give details that the imagination will be able to reuse again and 
again?
●
●
What details I provide inspire imagination?
●
●
What details I provide stifle imagination?

233
Game Balancing Methodologies
The rule of doubling and halving suggests that when changing values to balance 
your game, you will waste time by changing them by small amounts. Instead, 
start by doubling or halving your values in the direction they need to go. For 
example, if a rocket does 100 points of damage and you think that perhaps that 
is too much, don’t decrease it by 10 or 20, but rather set the damage value to 50 
and see how that works. If that is too low, then try a number halfway between 50 
and 100. By pushing the values farther than your intuition tells you, the limits of 
good balance start to become clear more quickly.
This rule is often attributed to designer Brian Reynolds. I contacted him to ask 
about it, and he had this to say:
That’s indeed a principle I regularly use (and espouse), but the original credit 
for it goes to none other than the illustrious Sid Meier. I often tell the story 
of how he took me aside as a young designer (when he caught me repeatedly 
changing something by 10%, I’m sure) back in the early 90s when we were 
working on Colonization, and it’s probably through the retelling of the story 
that it got associated with me. The point of the rule is to change something 
so that you can actually feel the difference right away. That gives you a much 
clearer idea of the workings of the variable you are changing, and saves you 
getting lost in the weeds wondering if you have even had an effect (or worse, 
seeing a change where none has really been accomplished, perhaps because of 
an unusual series of random numbers).
●
●
Train your intuition by guessing exactly: The more game design you do, the 
better your intuition will become. You can train your intuition for better game 
balancing by getting in the practice of guessing exactly. For example, if a projec­
tile in your game is moving at 10 feet per second and you get the feeling that is 
too slow, concentrate on what the exact number might be. Maybe your intuition 
tells you that 13 is too low, but 14 is a little too high. “13.7? No… Maybe 13.8. 
Yes—13.8 just feels right.” Once you have arrived at this intuitive guess, plug 
it in and see. You might find it is too low, or too high, or maybe even exactly 
right. Regardless, you will have just given your intuition some excellent data 
for when you guess next time. You can experience the same thing with your 
microwave oven. It is hard to know exactly what time to put in when reheating 
leftovers. And if you just make rough guesses, rounded to thirty seconds, you’ll 
never get much better at guessing. But if you guess exactly every time you put 
food in the microwave (1:40? Too hot… 1:20? Too cold… 1:30? Hmm… No, 1:32 
seems right), in a couple months, you will be able to make surprisingly accurate 
guesses because you will have trained your intuition.
●
●
Document your model: You should write down what you think the relationships 
are between the things you are balancing. This will help clarify your thoughts and 
give you a framework to record the results of your game balancing experiments.

234
CHAPTER Thirteen • GAME MECHANICS MUST BE IN BALANCE
●
●
Tune your model as you tune your game: As was mentioned in the “asymmetri­
cal game” section near the start of this chapter, as you experiment with balanc­
ing your game, you will develop a better model about how things are related 
within the game. With each balancing experiment that you try, you should note 
not only whether it improved your game but whether the experiment matches 
your model for how game mechanics are related. Then you should alter your 
model if it doesn’t match what you expected. Writing down your observations 
and your model helps a great deal!
●
●
Plan to balance: You know you are going to have to balance your game. As you 
are designing it, you might have a pretty good idea of what aspects of it you will 
need to balance. Take advantage of that, and put in systems that make it easy to 
change the values you expect to have to balance. If you can change these values 
while the game is running, that is even better. Better still is to have a content 
management system that lets you continue to balance the game even after it 
ships. The Rule of the Loop is in full force while you are game balancing, and in 
the modern world of online game distribution, you can (and must!) keep looping 
well after the game has shipped.
●
●
Let the players do it: Every once in a while you will run into a designer who has 
this bright idea: “Let’s let the players balance the game! That way they can pick 
the values that are right for them!” This sounds good in theory (who wouldn’t 
want a game that was custom tailored for a personalized level of challenge?) 
but tends to fail in practice because players have a conflict of interest. Yes, they 
want the game to give them a challenge, but at the same time, they want to win 
the game as easily as they can! And when all the values are set that way (Look 
at me! I have a million lives!), it is a quick rush of fun that quickly gets boring 
since there is no challenge left. Worst of all, returning from an overpowered 
game to a reasonable game balance is a little like trying to kick heroin—the 
lack of power makes the ordinary game feel limiting and dull. The Monopoly 
example serves us well again: people who play with the player-created rule that 
you get a jackpot when you land on free parking complain that the game goes 
on too long, but if you convince them to play by the official rules (that have 
no such jackpots), they often complain that it seems less exciting than the old 
way. There are times when letting the players balance the game is a good idea 
(usually through difficulty levels), but mostly, balancing the game is better left 
to the designers.
Balancing Game Economies
One of the more challenging structures to balance in any game is a “game econ­
omy.” The definition of a game economy is simple. We talked earlier about how 

235
Balancing Game Economies
to balance meaningful decisions, and that is just what any economy is defined 
by—two meaningful decisions, namely,
●
●
How will I earn money?
●
●
How will I spend the money I have earned?
Now, “money” in this context can be anything that can be traded for something 
else. If your game lets players earn skill points and then spend them on different 
skills, those skill points are money. What is important is that players have the 
two choices described earlier—that is what makes an economy. What makes for a 
meaningful economy is the depth and meaning in those two choices. And these two 
choices are usually in a loop, because usually players spend their money in ways 
that will help them earn more money, which will give them more opportunities to 
spend money, and so on. This alternating pattern of earning and spending is very 
appealing to players and shows up in many guises, a sort of alternating ratchet that 
moves players forward, like walking on two legs.
Balancing economies, particularly in large online multiplayer games, where 
players can buy or sell items to each other, can be very difficult, because you are 
really balancing many of the things we have already discussed at once:
●
●
Fairness: Do any players get unfair advantage by buying certain things or earn­
ing a certain way?
●
●
Challenge: Can players buy something that makes the game too easy for them? 
Is earning money to buy what they want too hard?
●
●
Choices: Do players have enough ways to earn money? To spend money?
●
●
Chance: Is earning money more skill based or chance based?
●
●
Cooperation: Can players pool their funds in interesting ways? Can they collude 
in a way that exploits “holes” in the economy?
●
●
Time: Does it take too long to earn money, or is it earned too quickly?
●
●
Rewards: Is it rewarding to earn money? To spend money?
●
●
Punishment: How do punishments affect a player’s ability to earn and spend 
money?
●
●
Freedom: Can players buy what they want and earn the way they want?
There are many different ways to balance economies in games, from controlling 
how much money is created by the game to controlling the different ways to earn and 
spend it. But the goals of balancing a game economy are the same as balancing any 
other game mechanics—to be sure the players can enjoy a fun, challenging game.

236
CHAPTER Thirteen • GAME MECHANICS MUST BE IN BALANCE
Dynamic Game Balancing
Dreamy young game designers frequently speak of their desire to create a system 
that will “adjust to the player’s skill level on the fly.” That is, if the game is too easy 
or too difficult for a player, the game will detect this and change the difficulty until 
it is at the right level of challenge for the player. And this is a beautiful dream. But 
it is a dream that is rife with some surprising problems.
●
●
It spoils the reality of the world: Players want to believe, on some level, that the 
game world they are playing in is real. But if they know that all of their oppo­
nents’ abilities are not absolute, but relative to the player’s skill level, it damages 
the illusion that these opponents are fixed challenges to be met and mastered.
●
●
It is exploitable: If players know the game will get easier when they play badly, 
they may choose to play badly just to make an upcoming part of the game easy 
to get through, completely defeating the purpose of the self-balancing system.
●
●
Players improve with practice: The Incredible Hulk for the PlayStation 2 caused 
some controversy by making the enemies get easier if you were defeated by them 
more than a certain number of times. Many players felt insulted by this, and oth­
ers felt disappointed—they wanted to keep practicing until they could master the 
challenge, and the game took away that pleasure.
This is not to say that dynamic game balancing is a dead end. I only mean to 
point out that implementing such a system is not so straightforward. I suspect that 
advances in this area will involve some very clever, counterintuitive ideas.
Lens #52: The Lens of Economy
Giving a game an economy can give it surprising depth and a life all its own. 
But like all living things, it can be difficult to control. Use this lens to keep 
your economy in balance:
●
●
How can my players earn money? Should there be other ways?
●
●
What can my players buy? Why?
●
●
Is money too easy to get? Too hard? How can I change this?
●
●
Are choices about earning and spending meaningful ones?
●
●
Is a universal currency a good idea in my game, or should there be special­
ized currencies?

The Big Picture
Game balancing is a big topic both in breadth and depth. I have tried to cover as 
many major points as possible, but each game has unique things that need to be 
balanced, so it would be impossible to cover everything. Use the Lens of Balance to 
look for any balancing problems the other lenses might have missed.

CHAPTER Fourteen • GAME MECHANICS SUPPORT PUZZLES
Puzzles are wonderful mechanisms that form key parts of many games. Sometimes 
they are very visible, and other times they are so enmeshed into the gameplay as 
to make them hidden, but what all puzzles have in common is that they make the 
player stop and think. Examining with Lens #42, Head and Hands, puzzles are 
firmly on the “head” side. It can be argued that any time a player stops during 
gameplay to think, they are solving a puzzle. The relationship between puzzles 
and games is tricky. In Chapter 4, “Game,” we talked about how every game is “a 
problem-solving activity, approached playfully.” Puzzles, too, are problem-solving 
activities—does this make them games? In this chapter, we will explore how to 
make good puzzles, and what the best ways are to incorporate puzzles into games. 
But first, we too should stop and think to better understand the puzzle–game 
relationship.
The Puzzle of Puzzles
There is much debate about whether puzzles are “really games.” Certainly, puzzles 
are often part of games, but does that mean they are games? In a sense, puzzles are 
just “fun problems.” If you go back and review Chapter 4, you will find that, surpris­
ingly, “fun problem” meets the many qualifications that we listed for the definition 
of a game. So, maybe each puzzle is really a kind of game?
Something bothers people about calling puzzles games. A jigsaw puzzle doesn’t 
feel like a game nor does a crossword puzzle. Would you call Rubik’s Cube a game? 
Probably not. So what is missing from puzzles that we are inclined to exclude them 
from our definition of games? First of all, most puzzles are just single player, but 
that can hardly be an objection—many things we immediately classify as games, 
from solitaire to Final Fantasy, are single player. They still have conflict; it is just 
between the player and system, not between player and player.
A young Chris Crawford once made the bold statement that puzzles are not even 
really interactive, since they don’t actively respond to the player. This is question­
able, partly because some puzzles do indeed respond to the player, particularly 
puzzles in videogames. Some people have suggested that any game that both has an 
ending and is guaranteed to give the same output to a player who always gives the 
same input is really a puzzle, and not a game. This would mean many story-based 
adventure games, such as Zork, Zelda, or Uncharted, might not qualify as games at 
all, but only as puzzles. But this doesn’t really ring true.
Perhaps puzzles are kind of like penguins. The first explorers to see penguins 
must have been kind of surprised, and probably at a loss as to how to classify them, 
thinking something like “Well, they kind of look like birds, but they can’t be birds, 
because birds can fly. They must be something else.” But further examination leads 
to the conclusion that penguins are indeed birds: just birds that can’t fly. So what is 
it that puzzles can’t do?

241
Aren’t Puzzles Dead?
Puzzlemaster Scott Kim once said that “A puzzle is fun, and has a right answer.” 
The irony of that is that once you find that right answer, the puzzle ceases to be fun. 
Or as Emily Dickinson once put it:
The Riddle we can guess
We speedily despise—
Not anything is stale so long
As Yesterday’s surprise.
The thing that really seems to bother people about calling puzzles games is that 
they are not replayable. Once you figure out the best strategy, you can solve the 
puzzle every time, and it is no longer fun. Games are not usually this way. Most 
games have enough dynamic elements that each time you play you are confronted 
again with a new set of problems to solve. Sometimes this is because you have an 
intelligent human opponent (checkers, chess, backgammon, etc.), and sometimes 
it is because the game is able to generate lots of different challenges for you, either 
through ever-advancing goals (setting a new high score record) or through some 
kind of rich challenge-generation mechanism (solitaire, Rubik’s Cube, Tetris, etc.)
In Chapter 12, “Balance,” we gave a name to the situation when a single strategy 
will defeat a game every time: a “dominant strategy.” When a game has a domi­
nant strategy, it doesn’t cease to be a game; it just isn’t a very good game. Children 
like tic-tac-toe until they find the dominant strategy. At that point, the puzzle of 
tic-tac-toe has been solved, and the game ceases to be interesting. Usually, we say 
games that have dominant strategies are bad, unless, of course, the whole point of 
the game is to find that dominant strategy. This leads to an interesting definition 
of a puzzle:
A Puzzle Is a Game with a Dominant Strategy
From this point of view, puzzles are just games that aren’t fun to replay, just as pen­
guins are birds that cannot fly. This is why both puzzles and games have problem 
solving at their core—puzzles are just miniature games whose goal is to find the 
dominant strategy.
Aren’t Puzzles Dead?
When I discuss the importance of puzzles with students, there is always someone 
who asks, “Aren’t puzzles old fashioned? I mean, sure they were a part of adventure 
games twenty years ago, but modern videogames are based on action, not puzzles, 
right? Besides, with all the walk-throughs on the web, everyone can get the answers 
to puzzles easily—so what’s the point?”

242
CHAPTER Fourteen • GAME MECHANICS SUPPORT PUZZLES
And this is an understandable point of view. In the 1980s and even early 1990s, 
adventure games (Zork, Myst, Monkey Island, King’s Quest, etc.) were very popular, 
and these usually featured very explicit puzzles. With the rise of console gaming, 
games that slid a bit more toward the “hands” side of the spectrum and away from the 
“head” side became more popular. But did the puzzles go away? No. Remember—a 
puzzle is anything that makes you stop and think, and mental challenges can add sig­
nificant variety to an action-based game. As game designers grew more experienced 
and games developed more fluid and continuous control schemes, the puzzles became 
less explicit and more woven into the fabric of the gameplay. Instead of completely 
stopping play and demanding that the player slides around pieces of a puzzle before 
they could continue, modern games integrate the puzzles into their environment.
For example, The 7th Guest, a popular game released in 1992, featured puz­
zles that, though interesting, were often completely incongruous. While walking 
through a house, you find cans on a shelf, and you need to rearrange them so that 
the letters on them form a sentence. Then you would suddenly find a giant chess­
board and be told that to continue in the game, you must find a way to exchange the 
positions of all the black pieces and the white pieces. Then you would look through 
a telescope and do a puzzle about connecting planets with lines.
Contrast that to The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker, which has many puzzles 
but smoothly integrates them into environments in the game. When confronted 
with a river of lava, you have to figure out how to throw water jugs in the right pat­
tern so that you can cross the river. When you are in a dungeon where the doors are 
opened and closed by a complex series of switches, you must figure out how to use 
items found in the dungeon (statues, etc.) to flip the switches so you can success­
fully get through all the doors. Some of these are quite complex; for example, some 
enemies in the dungeon are paralyzed when light falls on them. To get the doors 
open, you must lure the enemies onto the right switches and then shoot flaming 
arrows near enough to paralyze them to keep the door open so you can run out. But 
in all cases, the puzzle elements are natural parts of the environment, and the goals 
of solving the puzzle are direct goals of the player’s avatar.
This gradual change from explicit, incongruous puzzles to implicit, well-inte­
grated ones is less because of a change in the tastes of the gaming audience and 
more because game designers have matured in their skills. Look at The 7th Guest 
and Zelda puzzles with Lens #49, Elegance, and notice how many more purposes 
the implicit puzzle serves as opposed to the explicit one.
Our two examples were adventure games. Can other genres include puzzles? 
Absolutely. When you play a fighting game and you have to stop and think about 
which strategies are going to work best against a particular opponent, you are solving 
a puzzle. When you play a racing game and are trying to figure out where on the track 
to use your turbo booster to finish the race in less than a minute, you are solving a 
puzzle. When you play a first-person shooter and you think about which order you 
should shoot the enemies so that you take the least damage, you are solving a puzzle.
But what about walk-throughs on the web? Haven’t they spoiled videogame puz­
zles forever? They have not. We’ll see why in the next section.

Good Puzzles
Good Puzzles
Okay—so, puzzles are everywhere. The thing we really care about is how to create 
good puzzles that will improve our games. Here are ten principles of puzzle design 
that can be useful in any game genre.
Puzzle Principle #1: Make the Goal Easily Understood
To get people interested in your puzzle, they have to know what they are supposed 
to do. Consider this puzzle:
Just looking at it, it isn’t at all obvious what the goal is. Is it about color match­
ing? Is the goal to take it apart? Or maybe to put it back together? It isn’t easy to tell 
for sure. Contrast that to this puzzle:
Almost anyone can look at this and tell that the goal is to get the disk off of the 
shaft, even though they have never seen this before. The goal is clear.
The same thing applies to puzzles in videogames. If players aren’t sure what they 
are supposed to do, they will quickly lose interest, unless figuring out what to do 
is actually fun. And there are a lot of puzzles where figuring out what to do is part 
of the puzzle. But you must use caution with these kinds of puzzles—generally, 
only die-hard puzzle fans like that kind of challenge. Consider the fate of Hasbro’s 
Nemesis Factor. This ingenious puzzle is much revered by puzzle fanatics for being 
creative, interesting, and challenging—it challenges the player with one hundred

puzzles, gradually increasing in difficulty. Its design is incredible, and Hasbro 
surely hoped they might have another Rubik’s Cube on their hands. But sadly, it did 
not sell well. Why? It violated our first puzzle principle—the goal was not clear. Its 
curious stair-step design made it difficult to guess the goal, or even guess how you 
might interact with it at all, just by looking at it. Even after you have purchased it, 
the game still tells you little about what you are supposed to do. The player must fig­
ure out the goal of each puzzle and then try to solve it, and each of the one ­hundred 
puzzles has a different goal. It’s the sort of thing that hardcore puzzle freaks love, 
but a more general audience finds frustrating, because it is a very open-ended kind 
of problem that gives little feedback about whether you are on the right track.
When designing puzzles, make sure to view them through Lens #32, Goals, and 
make sure that you are clear to the player about what you want them to know about 
the goals of your puzzle.
Puzzle Principle #2: Make It Easy to Get Started
Once a player understands the goal of your puzzle, then they need to get started solv­
ing it. With some puzzles, it is quite clear how to begin. Consider Sam Loyd’s famous 
“15 Puzzle,” whose goal is to slide the tiles back into numerical order from 1 to 15.
Although the series of moves to solve the puzzle is not obvious, how you would 
get started manipulating it is very clear to most players. Contrast that to this puzzle, 
where the goal is to figure out which digit each letter represents:
F I G U R E
14.5
F I G U R E
14.4

Good Puzzles
Like the fifteen Puzzle, the goal is very clear. However, most players are at a 
complete loss as to how to begin solving a puzzle like this. Hardcore puzzle solv­
ers will likely begin a lengthy trial-and-error session to figure out how they might 
approach it, but most players will just abandon it as “too hard.”
Another piece of wisdom from Scott Kim is, “To design a good puzzle, first build 
a good toy.” And it makes sense to pull out Lens #17, The Toy, when designing your 
puzzle, for good toys make it obvious how to manipulate them. More than that, 
the player is drawn toward manipulating them. This is one of the things that made 
Rubik’s Cube so successful: even someone who has no intention of trying to solve 
the puzzle wants to see what it feels like to touch it, hold it, and twist it.
Puzzle Principle #3: Give a Sense of Progress
What is the difference between a riddle and a puzzle? In most cases, the big difference 
is progress. A riddle is just a question that demands an answer. A puzzle also demands 
an answer but frequently involves manipulating something so that you can see or feel 
yourself getting closer to the solution, bit by bit. Players like this sense of progress—it 
gives them hope that they may actually arrive at an answer. Riddles are not this way—
you just have to think and think, and maybe start making guesses, which are either 
right or wrong. In early computer adventure games, riddles were frequently encoun­
tered, since they were so easy to put into a game—but the “stone wall” they give to the 
player is so frustrating that they are virtually absent from modern adventure games.
But there is a way to turn a riddle into a puzzle—it’s a game we call “Twenty 
Questions.” This is the game where one player thinks of a thing or a person and the 
other player gets to ask twenty yes/no questions in an attempt to learn what the first 
player is thinking of.
The great thing about the game of Twenty Questions is the sense of progress that a 
player gets. By using their questions to gradually narrow down the space of possible 
Lens #54: The Lens of Accessibility
When you present a puzzle to players (or a game of any kind), they should 
be able to clearly visualize what their first few steps would be. Ask yourself 
these questions:
●
●
How will players know how to begin solving my puzzle or playing my 
game? Do I need to explain it, or is it self-evident?
●
●
Does my puzzle or game act like something they have seen before? If it 
does, how can I draw attention to that similarity. If it does not, how can I 
make them understand how it does behave?
●
●
Does my puzzle or game draw people in and make them want to touch it 
and manipulate it? If not, how I can I change it so that it does?

246
CHAPTER Fourteen • GAME MECHANICS SUPPORT PUZZLES
answers, they can get closer and closer to a solution—after all, 220 is over one mil­
lion, and this means that twenty well-crafted yes/no questions could home in on one 
answer out of a million possibilities. When players get frustrated playing Twenty 
Questions, it is because they feel like they aren’t getting any closer to an answer.
One of the things that made players persistently try to solve Rubik’s Cube is the 
sense of progress it gives. Gradually, a novice player is able to add more and more 
colors to one side, until voila! An entire side is completed! This is a clear sign of 
progress and something that makes players quite proud! Now they just have to do 
that five more times, right?
Of course, visible progress is important in more than just puzzles. It’s important 
in all aspects of gameplay, and even in life. Research shows that visible progress (or 
lack thereof) is the primary driver of mood in the workplace. And consider inflation: 
why is it that prices and wages tend to rise over time? It is not an economic principle; 
it is a psychological one: people want to have yearly pay raises, because it feels like 
progress. That money has to come from somewhere, so eventually prices go up.
Visible progress is so important to puzzle and game design that it becomes our 
next lens.
Puzzle Principle #4: Give a Sense of Solvability
Related to a sense of progress is a sense of solvability. If players begin to suspect 
that your puzzle is not solvable, they will become afraid that they are hopelessly 
wasting their time and give up in disgust. You need to convince them that it is solv­
able. Visible progress is a good way to do this, but so is outright stating that your 
puzzle has an answer. Returning to Rubik’s Cube, it had a very elegant method of 
making it clear to the player that it was a solvable puzzle—when purchased, it is 
already in the solved state—the player then scrambles it up, usually by twisting it 
about a dozen times. At this point, it is quite obviously solvable—in as many moves 
as it took to scramble it, just backward! But of course, most players find that solving 
Lens #55: The Lens of Visible Progress
Players need to see that they are making progress when solving a difficult 
problem. To make sure they are getting this feedback, ask yourself these 
questions:
●
●
What does it mean to make progress in my game or puzzle?
●
●
Is there enough progress in my game? Is there a way I can add more interim 
steps of progressive success?
●
●
What progress is visible, and what progress is hidden? Can I find a way to 
reveal what is hidden?

247
Good Puzzles
it takes many more twists than that. But as frustrated as they may get, they never 
have any doubt that it can be solved.
Puzzle Principle #5: Increase Difficulty Gradually
We’ve already discussed the fact that difficulty in games should increase gradually 
(Lens #38, Challenge), and successful puzzles also adhere to this maxim. But how 
can a puzzle increase in difficulty? Isn’t it either solved or not solved? Most puzzles 
are solved by taking a series of actions that are often small steps toward a chain 
of goals that leads to solving the puzzle. It is these actions that should gradually 
increase in difficulty. The classic jigsaw puzzle provides a naturally balanced series 
of these steps. A player who tries to solve a jigsaw puzzle doesn’t just start sticking 
pieces together until it is solved; instead they usually follow this sequence of steps:
	1.	 Flip all the pieces so that the picture side is up (mindlessly easy).
	2.	 Find the corner pieces (very easy).
	3.	 Find the edge pieces (easy).
	4.	 Connect the edge pieces into a frame (a slight challenge, rewarding when 
completed).
	5.	 Sort the remaining pieces by color (easy).
	6.	 Start assembling sections that are obviously near each other (a moderate 
challenge).
	7.	 Assemble the pieces that could go anywhere (a significant challenge).
This gradual increase in difficulty is part of what gives jigsaw puzzles lasting 
appeal. Now and then, someone releases a jigsaw puzzle that is meant to be tougher 
than normal, and they usually do it by changing the properties of the puzzle so that 
some (or all) of steps 1 through 6 are eliminated.
One Tough Puzzle, shown below, does just that. And while it is interesting as 
a novelty, the only interesting part about it is how immediately difficult it is. The 
pleasing nature of gradually increasing difficulty that makes jigsaw puzzles a 
perennial favorite is absent.
F I G U R E
14.6

248
CHAPTER Fourteen • GAME MECHANICS SUPPORT PUZZLES
One easy way to ensure that difficulty increases gradually is to give the players 
control over the order of the steps to your puzzle. Consider the crossword puzzle—
players have dozens of questions to answer, with each one answered giving hints 
about the unanswered ones. Players naturally gravitate toward answering the ques­
tions that are easiest for them and slowly work their way up toward harder ques­
tions. Giving the player this kind of choice is called parallelism, and it has another 
excellent property.
Puzzle Principle #6: Parallelism Lets the Player Rest
Puzzles make a player stop and think. A real danger is that the player will be unable to 
think their way past your puzzle and, unable to make progress, will abandon the game 
entirely. A good way to safeguard against this is to give them several different related 
puzzles at once. This way, if they get tired of banging their head on one of them, 
they can go off and try another for a while. In the process of doing that, they would 
have taken a break from the first puzzle, and they may be ready to try it again with 
the renewed vigor that a break can provide. The old saying that “A change is as good 
as a rest” applies perfectly here. Games like crossword puzzles and Sudoku do this 
naturally. But videogames can do it as well. It is the rare RPG that gives puzzles and 
challenges to a player one at a time—much more common is to give two or more paral­
lel challenges at once, since the player is much less likely to grow frustrated this way.
Puzzle Principle #7: Pyramid Structure Extends Interest
One more thing that parallelism lends itself to is pyramid puzzle structure. This 
means a series of small puzzles that each give some kind of clue to a larger puzzle. 
A classic example is the Jumble scrambled word game frequently seen in newspapers.
Lens #56: The Lens of Parallelism
Parallelism in your puzzle brings parallel benefits to the player’s experience. 
To use this lens, ask yourself these questions:
●
●
Are there bottlenecks in my design where players are unable to proceed if 
they cannot solve a particular challenge? If so, can I add parallel challenges 
for a player to work on when this challenge stumps them?
●
●
If parallel challenges are too similar, the parallelism offers little benefit. 
Are my parallel challenges different enough from each other to give players 
the benefit of variety?
●
●
Can my parallel challenges be connected somehow? Is there a way that 
making progress on one can make it easier to solve the others?

249
Good Puzzles
This puzzle could be made simpler by just asking you to unscramble the four 
words. But by having each unscrambled word give a few more letters for a more dif­
ficult scrambled phrase, the game combines short- and long-term goals. It gradually 
increases difficulty, and most important, a pyramid has a point: this game has a 
single clear and meaningful goal—to figure out the punch line of the joke presented 
by the cartoon.
Lens #57: The Lens of the Pyramid
Pyramids fascinate us because they have a singular highest point. To give 
your puzzle the allure of the ancient pyramids, ask yourself these questions:
●
●
Is there a way all the pieces of my puzzle can feed into a singular challenge 
at the end?
●
●
Big pyramids are often made of little pyramids—can I have a hierarchy 
of ever more challenging puzzle elements, gradually leading to a final 
challenge?
●
●
Is the challenge at the top of my pyramid interesting, compelling, and 
clear? Does it make people want to work in order to get to it?

CHAPTER Fourteen • GAME MECHANICS SUPPORT PUZZLES
Puzzle Principle #8: Hints Extend Interest
“Hints?! What is the point of even having a puzzle if we are going to give hints?” 
I hear you cry. Well, sometimes when a player is about to give up on your puzzle in 
frustration and disgust, a well-timed hint can renew their hope and their curiosity. 
And while it “cheapens” the puzzle-solving experience somewhat, solving a puzzle 
with a hint is much better than not solving it at all. One thing Hasbro’s Nemesis Factor 
did brilliantly was to include a hint system. It featured a “hint” button, and the player 
who presses it gets to hear a brief one- or two-word hint about the puzzle they are cur­
rently working on like “staircase” or “music.” Pushing it a second time gives another 
less cryptic hint. To help balance this hint system, there is a slight point penalty for 
asking for hints, but generally players are willing to take the hit and get a hint than 
give up on the puzzle altogether. A few “escape the room” puzzle games have taken 
this logic one step further—the games are free to play, but hints cost money.
Today, with walk-throughs of virtually every game available on the Internet, you 
can argue that hints are not really necessary for hard videogame puzzles. But still 
you might consider them, since solving a puzzle based on a hint can be more enjoy­
able than just cribbing the answer from someone else.
Puzzle Principle #9: Give the Answer!
No, seriously, hear me out on this one. Ask yourself this question: what is it that is 
so pleasurable about solving puzzles? Most people answer that it is the “Aha!” expe­
rience you get when you figure out the answer. But the funny thing is that experi­
ence is triggered not by solving the puzzle but by seeing the answer. Sure, it’s a little 
sweeter if you solved it yourself, but if you have given serious consideration to a 
problem, your problem-solving brain is primed for a rush of pleasure at merely see­
ing or hearing the answer. Think about mystery novels—they are just big puzzles in 
book form. And sometimes readers guess the ending ahead of time, but more often, 
they are surprised (Oh! The butler did it! I see now!), which is just as pleasurable, 
or weirdly, more pleasurable than if they had figured it out themselves.
So, how can you put this into practice? In the age of the Internet, you probably 
won’t have to—if your game is known at all, answers to your puzzles will quickly 
be posted online. But why not consider saving your players the trouble and give 
them a way to find out the answers to your puzzles from within your game, if they 
are truly stumped?
Puzzle Principle #10: Perceptual Shifts Are a Double-Edged Sword
Consider this puzzle:
Can you arrange six matchsticks so they form four equilateral triangles?
No, seriously, consider it. And by that, I mean, try to solve it.

251
A Final Piece
I’m guessing one of three things happened. Either (A) you’ve seen this one 
before, and solving it involved no pleasurable “Aha,” although maybe there was a 
little pleasurable smugness or (B) you had a “perceptual shift,” that is, a big leap in 
your assumptions and came up with the right answer, which was very exciting or 
(C) someone told you the answer, and you had a little bit of “Aha!” combined with 
a little bit of shame for not figuring it out yourself or (D) you gave up in frustration, 
feeling kind of ashamed.
The point I want to make with this is that puzzles like this, which involve a per­
ceptual shift where “either you get it or you don’t,” are a problematic double-edged 
sword. When a player is able to make the perceptual shift, they receive a great deal 
of pleasure and solve the puzzle. But if they are not able to make the perceptual 
shift, they get nothing. Puzzles like this involve almost no possibility of progress 
or gradual increase in difficulty—just a lot of staring and straining for inspiration 
to come. They are almost like riddles in this way, and generally, you will find they 
should be used sparingly in videogames or in any other medium where the player 
expects to be able to make continual progress.
A Final Piece
This concludes the ten principles of puzzle design. There are certainly others, but 
these ten can take you a long way if you use them in your designs. Puzzles can add 
a meaningful mental dimension to any game. Before we move on to a new topic, I’ll 
leave you with a final lens that is useful to see if your game has enough puzzles of the 
right kind.
Lens #58: The Lens of the Puzzle
Puzzles make the player stop and think. To ensure your puzzles are doing 
everything you want to shape the player experience, ask yourself these 
questions:
●
●
What are the puzzles in my game?
●
●
Should I have more puzzles, or less? Why?
●
●
Which of the ten puzzle principles apply to each of my puzzles?
●
●
Do I have any incongruous puzzles? How can I better integrate them into 
the game? (Use Lens #49, Elegance, to help do this).
In the last few chapters, we have focused on game internals—it is now time to 
consider an external element, the interface of the game.

CHAPTER Fifteen • PLAYERS PLAY GAMES THROUGH AN INTERFACE
Between Yin and Yang
Remember in Chapter 10 when we talked about the strange relationship between 
player and game? Specifically, that the player puts their mind inside the game 
world, but that game world really only exists in the mind of the player? This magi­
cal situation, which is at the heart of all we care about, is made possible by the 
game interface, which is where player and game come together. Interface is the infi­
nitely thin membrane that separates white/yang/player and black/yin/game. When 
the interface fails, the delicate flame of experience that rises from the player/game 
interaction is suddenly snuffed out. For this reason, it is crucial for us to understand 
how our game interface works and to make it as robust, as powerful, and as invis­
ible as we can.
Before we proceed, though, we should consider the goal of a good interface. It 
isn’t “to look nice” or “to be fluid,” although those are nice qualities. The goal of an 
interface is to make players feel in control of their experience. This idea is important 
enough that we should keep a lens around for frequent examination of whether a 
player feels in control.
Lens #59: The Lens of Control
This lens has uses beyond just examining your interface, since meaningful 
control is essential for immersive interactivity. To use this lens, ask yourself 
these questions:
●

When players use the interface, does it do what is expected? If not, why 
not?

Breaking It Down
Like many things we encounter in game design, interface is not simple or easily 
described. “Interface” can mean many things—a game controller, a display device, 
a system of manipulating a virtual character, the way the game communicates 
information to the player, and many other things. To avoid confusion and to under­
stand it properly, we need to separate it out into component parts.
Let’s work from the outside in. Initially, we know that we have a player and a 
game world.
On the simplest level, the interface is everything that is in between them. 
So, what is in there? There is some way that the player touches something to 
make changes in the world. This could be by manipulating pieces on a game 
board or by using a game controller or keyboard and mouse. Let’s call this 
physical input. And similarly, there is some way the player can see what is 
going on in the game world. It could be by looking at a game board, or it could

CHAPTER Fifteen • PLAYERS PLAY GAMES THROUGH AN INTERFACE
be some kind of display screen with audio or other sensory output. Let’s call 
this physical output. So we have the following:
This looks pretty simple and is the way most people naively think about game 
interface. But some important things are missing from this picture. While there are 
times when the physical input and output are directly connected to elements in the 
game world, there are other times that there is some amount of intermediate inter­
face. When you play Pac-Man and there is a score display at the top of the screen, 
this is not really part of the game world—it is really part of the interface. The same 
goes for menus and buttons on mouse-based interfaces or when you hit an enemy 
for ten points of damage and a stylized “10” floats out of his body. When you play 
most 3D games, you do not see the entire world, but instead you see a view into the 
world from a virtual camera with a position in the virtual space of the game world. 
All these things are part of a conceptual layer that exists between the physical 
input/output and the game world. This layer is usually called virtual interface and 
has both input elements (such as a virtual menu where the player makes a selec­
tion) and output elements (such as a score display) (see Figure 15.5).
Sometimes, the virtual layer is so thin that it is almost nonexistent, but other 
times, it is very dense, full of virtual buttons, sliders, displays, and menus that help 
the player play the game, but aren’t part of the game world. This virtual layer must 
be handled delicately, for, as designer Daniel Burwen notes, the less abstraction 
there is in an interface, the more emotional connection we feel to our content.
And that makes a pretty complete picture of the major interface elements involved 
in a game. But we’ve left out something crucial to the design of any game interface: 
mapping. On every arrow on the right side of the diagram, some special things 
are happening—it is not as if data are simply passed through—rather, these data 
go through a special transformation based on how the software is designed. Every 
one of the arrows on the game side represents a separate piece of computer code. 
How all this behaves together in composite defines the interface for your game.

Some quick examples of the kinds of logic that can be contained in each of those 
six arrows are as follows:
	1.	 Physical Input → World: If pushing a thumbstick makes my avatar run, the map­
ping tells how fast it will run and how quickly it will slow down if I let go. If I push 
the thumbstick harder, does my character run faster? Will my character accelerate 
over time? Will “double tapping” the thumbstick make my character dash?
	2.	 World → Physical Output: If you cannot see the entire world at once, what parts 
of it can you see? How will it be shown?
	3.	 Physical Input → Virtual Interface: In a mouse-based menu interface, what 
does clicking do? What does double-clicking do? Can I drag parts of the interface 
around?
	4.	 Virtual Interface → World: When the player manipulates the virtual interface, 
what effect does this have on the world? If they select an item in the world and 
use a pop-up menu to take an action on it, does that action take effect immedi­
ately or after some delay?
	5.	 World → Virtual Interface: How are changes in the world manifested in the vir­
tual interface? When do scores and energy bars change? Do events in the world 
lead to special pop-up windows or menus or mode changes in the interface? 
When players enter a battle, will special battle menus appear?
	6.	 Virtual Interface → Physical Output: What data are shown to the player, and 
where does it go on the screen? What colors will it be? What fonts? Will hit points 
pulse or make a sound when they are very low?
For close examination of these six types of connections, we introduce two new

CHAPTER Fifteen • PLAYERS PLAY GAMES THROUGH AN INTERFACE
Lens #61: The Lens of Virtual Interface
Designing virtual interfaces can be very tricky. Done poorly, they become 
a wall between the player and the game world. Done well, they amplify the 
power and control a player has in the game world. Ask these questions to 
make sure that your virtual interface is enhancing player experience as much 
as possible:
●
●
What information does a player need to receive that isn’t obvious just by 
looking at the game world?
●
●
When does the player need this information? All the time? Only occasion­
ally? Only at the end of a level?
●
●
How can this information be delivered to the player in a way that won’t 
interfere with the player’s interactions with the game world?
Lens #60: The Lens of Physical Interface
Somehow, the player has a physical interaction with your game. Copying exist­
ing physical interfaces is an easy trap to fall into. Use this lens to be sure that 
your physical interface is well suited to your game by asking these questions:
●
●
What does the player pick up and touch? Can this be made more pleasing?
●
●
How does this map to the actions in the game world? Can the mapping be 
more direct?
●
●
If you can’t create a custom physical interface, what metaphor are you 
using when you map the inputs to the game world?
●
●
How does the physical interface look under the Lens of the Toy?
●
●
How does the player see, hear, and touch the world of the game? Is there a 
way to include a physical output device that will make the world become 
more real in the player’s imagination?
The world of videogames occasionally goes through dry spells where 
designers feel it is not feasible to create custom physical interfaces. But the 
marketplace thrives on experimentation and novelty, and suddenly specially 
crafted physical interfaces, like the Dance Dance Revolution mat, the Guitar 
Hero guitar, and the Wiimote appear bringing new life to old gameplay by 
giving players a new way to interact with old game mechanics.

259
Breaking It Down
Of course, these six kinds of mapping cannot be designed independently—they must 
all work in unison to create a great interface. But before we move on, we must con­
sider two other important kinds of mapping, represented by the arrows that come and 
go from the player or, more specifically, from the player’s imagination. This is when 
a player becomes so immersed in a game, he or she is no longer pushing buttons and 
watching a television (TV) screen, instead, he or she is running, jumping, and swing­
ing a sword. And you can hear this in a player’s language. A player generally won’t 
say, “I controlled my avatar, so he ran to the castle, and then I pressed the red button 
to make him throw a grappling hook, then I started tapping the blue button to make 
my avatar climb up.” No, a player describes the gameplay this way: “I ran up the 
hill, threw my grappling hook, and started climbing the castle wall.” Players project 
themselves into games and on some level disregard that the interface is there at all, 
unless it suddenly becomes confusing. A person’s ability to project consciousness into 
whatever they are controlling is almost alarming. But it is only possible if the interface 
becomes second nature to the player, and this gives us our next lens.
●
●
Are there elements of the game world that are easier to interact with using 
a virtual interface (like a pop-up menu, for instance) than they are to inter­
act with directly?
●
●
What kind of virtual interface is best suited to my physical interface? 
Pop-up menus, for example, are a poor match for a gamepad controller.
Lens #62: The Lens of Transparency
No matter how beautiful your interface is, it would be better if there were 
less of it.
—Edward Tufte
The ideal interface becomes invisible to the player letting the player’s imagi­
nation be completely immersed in the game world. To ensure invisibility, ask 
yourself these questions:
●
●
What are the player’s desires? Does the interface let the players do what 
they want?
●
●
Is the interface simple enough that with practice, players will be able to use 
it without thinking?
●
●
Do new players find the interface intuitive? If not, can it be made more 
intuitive, somehow? Would allowing players to customize the controls 
help or hurt?

260
CHAPTER Fifteen • PLAYERS PLAY GAMES THROUGH AN INTERFACE
This interface, a parody from the web comic Penny Arcade, is probably not 
transparent.
The Loop of Interaction
Information flows in a loop from player to game to player to game, round and round. 
It is almost like this flow pushes a waterwheel that generates experience when it 
spins. But it can’t be just any information that flows around this loop. The informa­
tion that is returned to the player by the game dramatically affects what the player 
will do next. This information is generally called feedback, and the quality of this 
feedback can exert a powerful influence on how much the player understands and 
enjoys what is happening in your game.
●
●
Does the interface work well in all situations, or are there cases (near a corner, 
going very fast, etc.) when it behaves in ways that will confuse the player?
●
●
Can players continue to use the interface well in stressful situations, or do 
they start fumbling with the controls or missing crucial information? If so, 
how can this be improved?
●
●
Does anything confuse players about the interface? On which of the six 
interface arrows is it happening?
●
●
Do players feel a sense of immersion when using the interface?

261
The Loop of Interaction
The importance of good feedback is easily overlooked. One example is the net 
on a basketball hoop. The net does not affect the gameplay at all—but it slows 
the ball as it descends from the hoop, so that all players can clearly see, and even 
hear, that it went in.
A less obvious example is the Swiffer (Figure 15.7), a simple device designed to 
be a better solution for cleaning floors than the traditional broom/dustpan combi­
nation. Some people who have attempted to redesign the broom and dustpan have 
merely modified the existing solution, making a pan that clips to the broom handle, 
making sturdier broom bristles, adding a lid to the dustpan, etc. It would appear 
that the designers of the Swiffer used Lens #14, Problem Statement, to invent a brand 
new solution. If we look at some of the problems with the broom/dustpan solution,
Problem #1: It’s impossible to sweep all the dust into the dustpan.
Problem #2: When standing, the dustpan is hard to use. When crouching, the 
broom is hard to use.
Problem #3: The broom doesn’t really get all the dust.
Problem #4: Your hands get kind of dirty when you try to sweep dust into the 
dustpan.
Problem #5: Transferring the dirt from the dustpan to the trash is perilous—it 
often spills or blows around.
We see that the Swiffer, with its disposable cloth, solves these problems fairly well:
Solution #1: No dustpan is needed.
Solution #2: There is no need to crouch when using the Swiffer.
Solution #3: The Swiffer cloth captures far more dust than a broom can.
Solution #4: Your hands stay clean.
Solution #5: The cloth is easily disposed of.

CHAPTER Fifteen • PLAYERS PLAY GAMES THROUGH AN INTERFACE
So, the Swiffer solves a lot of problems, which makes it very appealing. But it 
has an appeal beyond these practical things. It has a strong psychological appeal—
frankly, it is fun to use. Why? Because the design addresses problems that most 
people wouldn’t state as problems. Here is an example:
Problem #6: The user gets little feedback about how well they have cleaned the floor.
Unless a floor is really dirty, it is hard to see whether your sweeping is making 
any difference just by looking at the floor. You might say, “Who cares? All that mat­
ters is how well it cleans, right?” But this lack of feedback can make the entire task 
feel somewhat futile, which means that the user enjoys it less and will clean their 
floor less often. In other words, less feedback = dirtier floor. But the Swiffer solves 
this problem very well:
Solution #6: The dirt you have removed from the floor is clearly visible on the 
cleaning cloth when you are done.
This feedback shows the user quite clearly that what they have done makes a 
real difference in how clean the floor is. This triggers all kinds of pleasures—
satisfaction of having done something useful, the pleasure of purification, and even 
the pleasure of having secret knowledge that others cannot see. And though this 
feedback doesn’t come until the end of the task, the user comes to anticipate it and 
looks forward to seeing this concrete evidence of a job well done.
Using this lens takes some effort, since feedback in a game is continuous but 
needs to be different in different situations. It takes a lot of mental effort to use this 
lens in every moment of your game, but it is time well spent, because it will help 
guarantee that the game is clear, challenging, and rewarding.
Lens #63: The Lens of Feedback
The feedback a player gets from the game is many things: judgment, reward, 
instruction, encouragement, and challenge. Use this lens to be sure your feed­
back loop is creating the experience you want by asking these questions at 
every moment in your game:
●
●
What do players need to know at this moment?
●
●
What do players want to know at this moment?
●
●
What do you want players to feel at this moment? How can you give feed­
back that creates that feeling?
●
●
What do the players want to feel at this moment? Is there an opportunity 
for them to create a situation where they will feel that?
●
●
What is the player’s goal at this moment? What feedback will help them 
toward that goal?

263
The Loop of Interaction
Experiences without feedback are frustrating and confusing. At many crosswalks 
in the United States, pedestrians can push a button that will make the DON’T WALK 
sign change to a WALK sign so they can cross the street safely. But it can’t change 
right away, since that would cause traffic accidents. So the poor pedestrian often has 
to wait up to a minute to see whether pressing the button had any effect. As a result, 
you see all kinds of strange button-pressing behavior: some people push the button 
and hold it for several seconds; others push it several times in a row, just to be safe. 
And the whole experience is accompanied by a sense of uncertainty—pedestrians 
can often be seen nervously studying the lights and DON’T WALK sign to see if it is 
going to change, because they might not have pushed the button correctly.
What a delight it was to visit the United Kingdom and find that in some areas 
the crosswalk buttons give immediate feedback in the form of an illuminated WAIT 
sign that comes on when the button has been pushed and turns off when the WALK 
period has ended (Figure 15.9)! The addition of some simple feedback turned an 
experience where a pedestrian feels frustrated into one where they can feel confi­
dent and in control.
Generally, it is a good rule of thumb that if your interface does not respond to 
player input within a tenth of a second, the player is going to feel like something 
is wrong with the interface. A typically problematic example of this often appears 
when you make a game with a “jump” button. If the animator working on the jump 
animation is new to videogames, he is very likely to put a “wind up” or “anticipa­
tion” on the jump animation, where the character crouches down, getting ready 
to jump, for probably one-quarter to one-half a second. This is sound animation 
practice, but because this breaks the tenth of a second rule (I push the jump but­
ton, but my character doesn’t actually end up in the air until a half second later), it 
drives players crazy with frustration.

Juiciness
But let’s return to our sweeping example: a dirty cloth is not the only feedback that 
the Swiffer gives the user. Let’s consider another problem with the broom and dust­
pan that most people would be unlikely to state.
Problem #7: Sweeping is boring.
Well, of course it is! It’s sweeping! But what do we mean by boring? We need to 
break this down further. Specifically:
●
●
Sweeping is repetitive (same motion over and over).
●
●
It requires you to focus your attention on something with no surprises (if you 
don’t monitor that little pile of dust, it goes everywhere).
How does the Swiffer meet this challenge?
Solution #7: Using the Swiffer is fun!
This may well be the single biggest selling point of the Swiffer. In TV advertise­
ments for the Swiffer, they show people joyously dancing through houses cleaning

Juiciness
floors, and some ads featured people picking up the Swiffer out of sheer curiosity 
and then cleaning the floors while playing with the Swiffer like a child plays with a 
toy. And the Swiffer does very well under Lens #17, The Toy—it is fun to play with… 
but why? It’s just a cloth on a stick, right? Yes, in one sense, but the base of the 
Swiffer, where the cloth goes, is attached to the stick with a special sort of hinge, so 
that when you rotate your wrist, even slightly, the base that holds the cloth rotates 
dramatically. A little motion from my wrist makes the cleaning mechanism move 
easily, fluidly, and powerfully—getting into exactly the position you want it to be 
in with a minimum of effort. Using it feels kind of like running a magic race car 
around the floor of your house. The motion that the cleaning base shows is second-
order motion, that is, motion that is derived from the action of the player. When a 
system shows a lot of second-order motion that a player can easily control and that 
gives the player a lot of power and rewards, we say that it is a juicy system—like a 
ripe peach, just a little bit of interaction with it gives you a continuous flow of deli­
cious reward. Juiciness is often overlooked as an important quality in a game. To 
avoid overlooking it, use this lens.
We discussed in Chapter 4 how the difference between work and play is one of 
attitude. I chose this nongame example of the Swiffer as an illustration because the 
feedback it gives is so powerful that it changes work into play. And it is important 
for your interface to be fun, if possible—since your game is meant to be fun and you 
run the risk of creating inner contradictions and a self-defeating experience if you 
put a dry, painful interface as the player’s gateway to your supposedly fun experi­
ence. Remember, fun is pleasure with surprises, so if your interface is going to be 
fun, it should give both.
Lens #64: The Lens of Juiciness
To call an interface “juicy” might seem kind of silly—although it is very com­
mon to hear an interface with very little feedback described as “dry.” Juicy 
interfaces are fun the moment you pick them up. To maximize juiciness, ask 
yourself these questions:
●
●
Is my interface giving the player continuous feedback for their actions? If 
not, why not?
●
●
Is second-order motion created by the actions of the player? Is this motion 
powerful and interesting?
●
●
Juicy systems reward the player many ways at once. When I give the player 
a reward, how many ways am I simultaneously rewarding them? Can I find 
more ways?

266
CHAPTER Fifteen • PLAYERS PLAY GAMES THROUGH AN INTERFACE
Primality
One kind of interface that tends to be associated with juicy fun is the touch inter­
face found on phones and tablets. Touch interfaces have done a lot to change 
the world of gaming in a very short time. Young children, in particular, seem to 
take to touch interfaces with surprising ease. But why? The obvious answer is 
“because they are intuitive.” But that’s really a pretty vaporous answer, since the 
definition of “intuitive” is “easy to understand.” So the question becomes “why is 
it that touch interfaces are so easy to understand?” And the answer is this: they 
are primal.
Until the advent of touch computing, every computer interface took the form 
of tool use. I would interact with some physical object (keyboard, mouse, button 
panel, punch card, etc.), and some remote (not near my finger) response would 
take place. Gradually, like with all tools, we learn how they work and become 
accustomed to them. But tool use is not primal, by which I mean, prehuman. 
Humans started using tools about three million years ago, which is a pretty good 
run. But still animals have been touching things, intuitively, for much longer: 
probably something like 300 or 400 million years. And our brains, of course, are 
evolved from those brains. When you think about the three-layer structure of the 
human brain, it becomes clearer—the lowest-level “reptilian” section of the brain 
is able to process touch, but tool use probably requires help from the neocortex, the 
highest level of the brain.
When you think of it that way, it becomes obvious why touch is more intuitive 
than using a mouse or game controller. But then, of course, it raises a broader 
question—what parts of my game are primal, and what parts require higher 
brain function? It seems certain that the more you can engage and involve the 
primal parts of the brain, the more intuitive and powerful your gameplay will 
feel, which helps to explain why so many games contain elements such as the 
following:
●
●
Gather fruit-like items.
●
●
Fight a threatening enemy.
●
●
Find your way through an unfamiliar environment.
●
●
Overcome obstacles to get to a mate (how scientists say “rescue the princess”).
To really know what parts of the brain are involved in a given activity, you need 
to be a brain scientist doing MRI research. But to make an educated guess about 
whether your interface and game activity has low-level primality, just think about 
whether it is something that animals can do. If they can, there’s a good chance you 
are tapping into the power of primality.

267
Channels of Information
Channels of Information
One important goal of any interface is to communicate information. Determining 
the best way for your game to communicate necessary information to the player 
requires some thoughtful design, since games can often contain a great deal of 
information and often much of it is needed at the same time. To figure out the 
best way to present the information in your game, try following these steps. 
Referring back to our interface data flow diagram from the beginning of the 
chapter, we are mostly talking about arrows 5 (World → Virtual Interface) and 6 
(Virtual Interface → Physical Output).
Step 1: List and Prioritize Information
A game has to present a lot of information, but it is not all equally important. Let’s 
say we were designing the interface for a game similar to the classic NES game, 
Legend of Zelda. We might begin by listing all of the information the player needs 
to see. A simple unprioritized list might look like
	1.	 Number of rubies
	2.	 Number of keys
	3.	 Health
	4.	 Immediate surroundings
	5.	 Distant surroundings
	6.	 Other inventory
	7.	 Current weapon
	8.	 Current treasure
	9.	 Number of bombs
Lens #65: The Lens of Primality
Some actions and interfaces are so intuitive that animals were doing them 
hundreds of millions of years ago. To capture the power of primality, ask 
yourself these questions:
●
●
What parts of my game are so primal an animal could play? Why?
●
●
What parts of my game could be more primal?

268
CHAPTER Fifteen • PLAYERS PLAY GAMES THROUGH AN INTERFACE
Now, we might sort these by importance:
Need to know every moment:
	4.	 Immediate surroundings
Need to glance at from time to time while playing:
	1.	 Number of rubies
	2.	 Number of keys
	3.	 Health
	5.	 Distant surroundings
	7.	 Current weapon
	8.	 Current treasure
	9.	 Number of bombs
Need to know only occasionally:
	6.	 Other inventory
Step 2: List Channels
A channel of information is just a way of communicating a stream of data. Exactly 
what the channels are varies from game to game—and there is a lot of flexibility in 
how you choose them. Some possible channels of information might be
●
●
The top center of the screen
●
●
The bottom right of the screen
●
●
My avatar
●
●
Game sound effects
●
●
Game music
●
●
The border of the game screen
●
●
The chest of the approaching enemy
●
●
The word balloon over a character’s head
It can be a good idea to list out the possible channels that you think you might 
use. In Legend of Zelda, the main channels of information the designers settled on 
were
●
●
Main display area
●
●
Dashboard of information at the top of the screen

269
Channels of Information
Also, they decided there would be a “mode change” the player could activate by 
hitting the “select” button (we’ll discuss mode changes later in this chapter), which 
has different channels of information:
●
●
Auxiliary display area
●
●
Dashboard of information at the bottom of the screen
Step 3: Map Information to Channels
Now, the difficult task comes of mapping the types of information to the different 
channels. This is usually done partly by instinct, partly by experience, and mostly 
by trial and error—drawing lots of little sketches, thinking about them, and then 
redrawing them, until you think you have something worth trying out. In Zelda, 
the mapping is as follows:
Main display area:
	4. Immediate surroundings
Dashboard of information at the top of the screen:
	1.	 Number of rubies
	2.	 Number of keys
	3.	 Health
	5.	 Distant surroundings
	7.	 Current weapon
	8.	 Current treasure
	9.	 Number of bombs
Auxiliary display area:
	6. Other inventory
Taking a look at the main screen (Figure 15.11) and subscreen (Figure 15.10), you 
can see other interesting choices that were made:
Note that the dashboard information is so important to gameplay that it needs to 
be shown all the time on both the main screen and subscreen. And the contents of 
that dashboard really involve seven different channels of information. Notice how 
they split them up—“life” was deemed so important that it got nearly one-third of 
the interface. Rubies, keys, and bombs, though their functions are different, each 
have to communicate a two-digit number, so they are all grouped together. The 
weapon and treasure you are holding are so important that they have little boxes 
around them. The “A” and “B” are reminders to the player about which buttons to 
hit in order to use these items.

270
CHAPTER Fifteen • PLAYERS PLAY GAMES THROUGH AN INTERFACE
Also note on the inventory screen how extra space was used to give the player 
some instruction on how to use it.
You can see that even though this is a relatively simple interface compared to 
more modern games, there were many decisions the designer made about how to 
lay it out, and these decisions made a significant impact on the game experience.
Step 4: Review Use of Dimensions
A channel of information in a game can have several dimensions. For example, if 
you have decided to map “damage to an enemy” to “numbers that fly out of that 
enemy,” you have several dimensions you can work with on that channel. Some of 
these might be
●
●
The number you display
●
●
The color of the number

NES Zelda main screen.
F I G U R E 
15.10
NES Zelda subscreen.

271
Channels of Information
●
●
The size of the numerals
●
●
The font of the numerals
Now you have to decide which of these dimensions, if any, you want to use. 
Surely you will use the first one, the number. But will the color mean anything? 
Perhaps you will use the other dimensions as reinforcers of the information—num­
bers under 50 will be white and small, numbers from 50 to 99 will be yellow and 
medium sized, but numbers 100 and over will be red and very large and in a special 
font to emphasize the amount of damage.
And while using multiple dimensions on a channel to reinforce a piece of infor­
mation is a way to make the information very clear (and also kind of juicy), you 
could also take a different approach and decide to put different pieces of information 
on the different dimensions. For example, you might decide to color the numbers to 
indicate friend (white) or foe (red). Then you might make the size of the numbers 
indicate how close the character is to defeat—small numerals might mean the char­
acter has a lot of hit points left, while large numerals might mean they are about to 
die. This kind of technique can be very efficient and elegant. By using a single num­
ber, you have communicated three different pieces of information. The risk is that 
you have to educate the player on what these different dimensions on one channel 
of information represent, which might be difficult for some players to understand or 
remember. Good use of channels and dimensions is what makes for an elegant, well 
laid out interface, so we keep a special lens around for this kind of examination.
Modes
What is an interface mode? Simply put, it is a change in one of the mapping arrows 
(1–6) in our interface diagram. For example, if pressing the B button changes the 
Lens #66: The Lens of Channels and Dimensions
Choosing how to map game information to channels and dimensions is the 
heart of designing your game interface. Use this lens to make sure you do it 
thoughtfully and well. Ask yourself these questions:
●
●
What data need to travel to and from the player?
●
●
Which data are most important?
●
●
What channels do I have available to transmit these data?
●
●
Which channels are most appropriate for which data? Why?
●
●
Which dimensions are available on the different channels?

●
How should I use those dimensions?

functionality of the gamepad so that instead of making your avatar run around, 
it makes your avatar aim a water hose, which is a mode change, the mapping on 
arrow #1 (Physical Interface → World) has just changed. Mode changes can happen 
as a result of mapping changes on any of the six arrows.
Modes are a great way to add variety to your game, but you must be very care­
ful, since you run a risk of confusing the player if they don’t realize that a mode 
change has occurred. Here are a few tips to avoid getting in trouble with interface 
modes.
Mode Tip #1: Use as Few Modes as Possible
The fewer the modes, the less chance a player is going to get confused. Having 
multiple interface modes isn’t a bad thing, but you should add modes cautiously, for 
each one is something the new the player is going to have to learn and understand.
Mode Tip #2: Avoid Overlapping Modes
Just as we have channels of information from the game to the player, there are simi­
lar channels of information from the player to the game. Each button or thumbstick 
is a channel of information; for example, let’s say you have a game that lets you 
change between walking mode (the thumbstick navigates) and throwing mode 
(the thumbstick aims). Later, you decide to add a driving mode as well (the thumb­
stick steers a car). What happens if the player changes into throwing mode while 
they are driving? You could try to allow this, potentially putting you into two modes 
at once (driving and throwing). And while this might work, it also might be a disas­
ter if the thumbstick is simultaneously steering a car and controlling an aiming 
interface. It might be wiser to move the aiming, in all cases, to a second thumbstick, 
if your physical interface has one. By making your modes distinct and nonoverlap­
ping, you keep yourself out of trouble. If you find you need to have overlapping 
modes, make sure they use different channels of information on the interface. For 
example, the thumbstick could have two navigating modes (flying or walking), and 
the button has two shooting modes (shoot fireball or lightning bolt). These modes 
are on completely different dimensions, so they can overlap safely—I can switch 
between shooting fireballs and shooting lightning bolts while either walking or fly­
ing with no confusing effects.
Mode Tip #3: Make Different Modes Look as Different as Possible
In other words, look at your modes with Lens #63, Feedback, and Lens #62, 
Transparency. If a player doesn’t know what mode they are in, they are going to be 
confused and frustrated. The old Unix text editing system, vi (pronounced as “V. I.”), 
was a symphony of confusing modes. Most people would expect that a text editor, 

273
Channels of Information
when it started up, would be in a mode that would allow you to enter text. But not 
so for vi. It was actually in a mode where each letter of the keyboard either would 
issue a command, like “delete line,” or would put the editor into a new mode. But 
hitting these keys would give no feedback about what mode you were in. If you 
actually wanted to enter text, you had to type a letter “i,” and then you would be 
in text insert mode, which looked exactly like command entry mode. It was impos­
sible to figure out on your own, and even seasoned vi users would occasionally get 
confused about what mode they were in.
Some great ways to make your modes look different in video games are 
listed next.
●
●
Change something large and visible on the screen: In Halo and most first-
person shooters, when you change weapons, it is very visible. As a side note, 
the amount of ammo you have left is given through an interesting channel—it is 
right on the back of your gun.
●
●
Change the action your avatar is taking: In the classic arcade game Jungle King, 
you go from a vine swinging mode to a swimming mode. Because your avatar 
is doing something so obviously different, it is clear that the mode has changed 
(also his hair changes color—that might be overkill).
●
●
Change the on screen data: In Final Fantasy games and most RPGs, when you 
enter combat mode, many combat statistics and menus suddenly come up, and it 
is obvious there has been a mode change.
●
●
Change the camera perspective: This is often overlooked as an indicator of a 
mode change, but it can be very effective.
Lens #67: The Lens of Modes
An interface of any complexity is going to require modes. To make sure your 
modes make the player feel powerful and in control and do not confuse or 
overwhelm, ask yourself these questions:
●
●
What modes do I need in my game? Why?
●
●
Can any modes be collapsed or combined?
●
●
Are any of the modes overlapping? If so, can I put them on different input 
channels?
●
●
When the game changes modes, how does the player know that? Can the 
game communicate the mode change in more than one way?

Other Interface Tips
Okay—we’ve covered interface data flow, feedback, channels, dimensions, and 
modes. That’s a good start. But whole books have been written about the topic 
of interface design, and we have so many other interesting things to discuss; we 
must move on! But before we do, here are some general tips for making good game 
interfaces.
Interface Tip #1: Steal
More politely, we would call this the “top-down approach” to interface design. If 
you are designing an interface for a known game genre, say an action/platform 
game, you can begin with the interface of a known success in this area and then 
change it around to suit the things that are unique about your game. This can save 
you a lot of design time and has the benefit of being a familiar interface to your 
users. Of course, if your game has nothing new to offer, this will make it feel like a 
clone—but it is often surprising how one little change leads to another, which leads 
to another, and before you know it, your clone interface has morphed into some­
thing quite different.
Interface Tip #2: Customize
Also called the bottom-up approach, it is the opposite of stealing. With this approach, 
you design your interface from scratch, by listing out information, channels, and 
dimensions like we explained earlier. This is a great way to get an interface that 
looks unique and is custom to your particular game. If your gameplay is novel, you 
may find this is the only path available to you. But even if your gameplay is nothing 
new, you may be surprised when you try to build it from the bottom up—you may 
find that you invent a whole new way to play your game, because everyone else has 
just been copying what is successful and you took the time to actually examine the 
problem and tried to do a better job.
Interface Tip #3: Design around Your Physical Interface
The world of videogame development features platforms with radically different 
interfaces: touch interfaces, motion interfaces, mouse and keyboard, gamepads, and 
even virtual reality helmets. It is tempting to make games that can work equally 
well on all these platforms, so that you can sell them to as many people as possible. 
But the truth is that trying to design a game independent of any particular interface 
is usually a path to a dull game. Think about Angry Birds—its megasuccess was 

275
Other Interface Tips
partly due to the fact that it used the touch interface so well. Remember the Lens 
of the Toy? If the core interaction of your game is a unique type of play that takes 
advantage of what is unique to that physical interface, it can get enough attention to 
make giving up those other platforms more than worthwhile.
Interface Tip #4: Theme Your Interface
Often it is a different artist who designs the interface artwork than the one who 
designs the game world. In Chapter 6, “Theme,” we talked about the importance of 
theming everything, and interface is no exception. Go over every inch of your inter­
face with Lens #11, Unification, and see if you can find a way to tie it all together 
with the rest of the experience.
Interface Tip #5: Sound Maps to Touch
Usually, when we think of using sound in a game, we think of creating a sound­
scape to give a sense of place (tweeting birds in a meadow), or to make actions seem 
more realistic (hearing glass break when you see it break), or to give the player 
feedback about their progress in the game (a musical glissando when you pick up a 
treasure). But there is an often overlooked aspect to sound that has a direct bearing 
on interface: the human mind easily maps sound to touch. This is important, since 
when we manipulate things in the real world, touch is a central component of feed­
back we get about manipulation. In a virtual interface, we get little, if any, informa­
tion through our touch sense. But you can simulate touch by playing appropriate 
sounds. First, you have to think about what you would like your interface to feel like 
if it were real, and then you have to decide what sounds will best create that feeling. 
If you do this successfully, people will marvel at what a pleasure your interface is 
to use, but they will have difficulty expressing exactly why. I have high hopes that 
future interfaces will find ways to more successfully involve tactile feedback, but 
until they do, sound is your best bet.
Interface Tip #6: Balance Options and Simplicity with Layers
When designing an interface, you will be confronted by two conflicting desires: the 
desire to give the player as many options as possible and the desire to make your 
interface as simple as possible. As with so many things in game design, the key to 
success is striking a balance. And one good way to achieve this balance is by creat­
ing layers of interface through modes and submodes. If you have done a good job of 
prioritizing your interface, you will have a good head start toward figuring out how 
to do this. A typical videogame example of this is hiding inventory and configura­
tion menus under an infrequently used button, such as “start.”

276
CHAPTER Fifteen • PLAYERS PLAY GAMES THROUGH AN INTERFACE
Interface Tip #7: Use Metaphors
A great shortcut to giving a player understanding of how your interface works is by 
making it resemble something the player has seen before. For example, in design­
ing the game ToyTopia, my team had a very unusual constraint. In this game, the 
player issues keyboard commands (go up, go right, etc.) to a small team of windup 
toys. Since it was a synchronous multiplayer game, the plan was to keep things 
in sync by introducing a delay between when a player issued a command and 
when a toy would receive it. This way, we could keep games in sync on different 
players’ machines because the local artificial delay would be the same length as 
the unavoidable network delay of a signal traveling from one computer to another. 
Unfortunately (and not surprisingly), players found this to be confusing—they are 
used to a button push taking action immediately—not taking a half second before 
something happens. The team was frustrated to the point of considering abandon­
ing the whole scheme, but then someone had the idea that if we showed a visible 
radio signal traveling from the virtual button to the toy and accompanied it by a 
“radio transmission” sound effect, it might help players understand the mecha­
nism better. And it worked! With the new system, the radio transmission metaphor 
clearly explained the delay in action and also gave the players some immediate 
feedback about what was happening. And under Lens #11, Unification, this change 
helped reinforce the theme, which was about radio-controlled toys.
Interface Tip #8: If It Looks Different, It Should Act Different
Game developers frequently fall into the trap of going against this tip in the name 
of visual variety. For example, they might be making a game where you fight fly­
ing saucers. To add some visual spice, someone gets the idea to have the saucers be

Other Interface Tips
different colors: some are red, some purple, and some green. Players who see these 
are surely going to think that they are functionally different—that they perhaps go 
different speeds or have different point values. If they are not and they just have 
different paint jobs, players are sure to be disappointed and confused.
Similarly, designers often make the opposite mistake, creating two things that 
look the same but behave differently. For example, you might create an “X” button 
that when pressed, closes part of the interface. Later, in need of a button that allows 
players to delete items from the game, “X” might seem like a logical choice to rep­
resent delete. But if the same “X” sometimes means “delete” and sometimes means 
“close window,” it has a good chance of confusing and frustrating players.
Interface Tip #9: Test, Test, Test!
No one gets an interface right the first time. New games require new interfaces, 
and you cannot take it for granted that your new interface is going to be clear, 
power giving, and fun unless you have people try it out. Test it as early as possible 
and as often as possible. Build prototypes of your interface well before you have a 
complete playable game. Make paper and cardboard prototypes of any button or 
menu systems that you have, and get people to act out playing the game and using 
the interface so that you can see where they are having trouble. Most important, by 
working with players this way, like an anthropologist, you will start to get better 
ideas about their intentions from moment to moment, which will inform all of your 
interface decisions.
Interface Tip #10: Break the Rules to Help Your Player
Since many games are variations on existing themes, there is a lot of copying of 
interface designs from game to game. So much so that certain rules of thumb tend 
to show up for each genre of game. These can be useful, but it is easy to follow them 
slavishly without thinking about whether they are really a good idea for the players 
of your game. One example involves PC games using a mouse. The left mouse but­
ton is considered the main button, and some games choose to use the right mouse 
button for other functionality. So, a rule of thumb is that the right mouse button 
should generally not do anything, unless you are in a special mode where it has 
a purpose. However, this rule is often taken too far—and in simple games, such 
as children’s games, where the right mouse button isn’t used at all, most design­
ers tend to leave it completely disabled, so that all gameplay happens through the 
left mouse button. But when children use a mouse, they frequently click the wrong 
mouse button because their hands are small. Smart designers break this rule of 
thumb and make the left and right mouse buttons both map to the same action, so 
that either button can be pressed successfully. Really, why wouldn’t you do this for 
every game that only needs one mouse button?

CHAPTER Sixteen • EXPERIENCES CAN BE JUDGED BY THEIR INTEREST CURVES
My First Lens
When I was sixteen, I landed my first job working as a professional entertainer. 
It was in a show troupe at a local amusement park. I had hopes of being a part 
of shows where I could make good use of my much-practiced juggling skills, but 
my job ended up being a mix of a lot of things—puppeteering, wearing a raccoon 
costume, working the mixing board backstage, and hosting audience participation 
comedy shows. But one day the head of the troupe, a magician named Mark Tripp, 
came to me, explaining, “Listen—that new stage on the east side of the park is 
almost finished. We’re going to move the music revue over there, and I’m going to 
be putting on a magic show. On my days off, we need some other show to fill the 
gap. Do you think you and Tom could put together a juggling show?”
Naturally, I was very excited—Tom and I had been practicing together every 
chance we could get, hoping that we might get an opportunity to do our own 
show. We talked it over and put together a rough script, with brief descriptions 
of the various tricks we could do and the patter and jokes that would link them 
together. We practiced it until we felt it was ready for a trial run. In a couple of 
days, our big moment came, and we got to try the show in front of an audience. 
We opened with a balancing routine, followed by some ring juggling, then club 
juggling, then club passing, and ending with five ball juggling, which we felt was 
our hardest trick. It was exhilarating to be performing our very own show. At the 
end, we took our bows and went backstage triumphantly.
Mark was backstage waiting for us. “Well, what did you think?” we asked proudly.
“Not bad,” he said, “but it could be a lot better.”
“Better?” I said, surprised, “but we didn’t drop anything!”
“True,” he replied, “but were you listening to that audience?”
I thought back. “Well, they were a little slow to warm up, I guess, but they really 
liked the club passing routine!”
“Yes, but how about the five ball juggling—your last routine?”
We had to admit that didn’t go over as big as we thought it would.
“Let me see your script,” he said. He read it over carefully, sometimes nodding, 
sometimes squinting at it. He thought for a moment and said, “You have some good 
stuff in this act, but the progression isn’t quite right.” Tom and I looked at each other.
“Progression?” I asked.
“Yeah,” he responded, picking up a pencil, “See, your show right now is kind of 
shaped like this,” and he sketched this shape on the back of the script:

Interest Curves
He went on. “Audiences generally prefer to see a show shaped more like this.”
“See?”
I didn’t see. But I had the feeling I was looking at something very important.
“It’s simple. You need to start with more of a bang—to get their attention. Then 
you back off and do something a little smaller, to give them a chance to relax and get 
to know you. Then you gradually build up with bigger and bigger routines, until you 
give them a grand finale that exceeds their expectations. If you put your ring routine 
first and your club passing routine last, I think you’ll have a much better show.”
The next day, we tried the show again, changing almost nothing but the order 
of the routines—and Mark was absolutely right. The audience was excited from 
the very beginning, and then their interest and excitement slowly built up over the 
course of the show to a grand climax with our club passing routine. Even though we 
dropped things a couple times in the second show, the audience response was twice 
what we had at the first show, with a few people jumping to their feet and shouting 
at the climax of the final routine.
Mark was waiting for us backstage, smiling this time. “It seems like it went bet­
ter today,” he said. Tom replied, “After you suggested that we change the show, it 
seemed so obvious. It’s weird that we couldn’t see it on our own.”
“It’s not weird at all,” said Mark. “When you are working on a show, you are 
thinking about all the details and how one thing links to another. It requires a real 
change in perspective to rise above the show and look at it as a whole from the audi­
ence’s point of view. But it makes a real difference, huh?”
“It sure does!” I said, “I guess we have a lot to think about.”
“Well, don’t think about it now—you two have a puppet show in five minutes.”
Interest Curves
Since my time at the amusement park, I have found myself using this technique 
again and again when designing games and have always found it useful. But what 
are these graphs, really? Let’s take a moment and examine them in detail.

CHAPTER Sixteen • EXPERIENCES CAN BE JUDGED BY THEIR INTEREST CURVES
The first thing to realize is that any entertainment experience is a series of 
moments. Some are more powerful than others, and when we make these graphs, 
we are generally charting the most powerful moments. Back in my Imagineering 
days, when we would present a new idea for a theme park ride to the CEO of Disney, 
we could expect one certain question: “What are the top ten moments in your experi­
ence?” This question takes a lot of thought and preparation to answer properly, but if 
we didn’t have a clear answer, the pitch meeting was over. When you chart an inter­
est curve, you are figuring out how to best arrange the best moments of your experi­
ence, and you can’t do that if you don’t know what they are. That’s what makes the 
Lens of Moments so important.
Once you know your moments, how should you chart them out? The quality of 
an entertainment experience can be measured by the extent to which its unfolding 
sequence of events is able to hold a guest’s interest. I use the term “guest” instead of 
“player” because it is a term that works with games as well as more general experi­
ences. The level of interest over the course of the experience can be plotted out in 
an interest curve. Figure 16.3 shows an example of an interest curve for a successful 
entertainment experience.
Lens #68: The Lens of Moments
Memorable moments are stars that make up the constellation of your interest 
curve. To chart what is most important, ask yourself these questions:
●
●
What are the key moments in my game?
●
●
How can I make each moment as powerful as possible?

Interest Curves
At point (A), the guest comes into the experience with some level of interest; 
otherwise, they probably wouldn’t be there. This initial interest comes from precon­
ceived expectations about how entertaining the experience will be. Depending on 
the type of experience, these expectations are influenced by the packaging, adver­
tisements, advice from friends, etc. While we want this initial interest to be as high 
as possible to get guests in the door, overinflating it can actually make the overall 
experience less interesting.
Then the experience starts. Quickly we come to point (B), sometimes called 
“the hook.” This is something that really grabs you and gets you excited about the 
experience. In a musical, it is the opening number. In the Beatles song Revolution, 
it is the screaming guitar riff. In Hamlet, it is the appearance of the ghost. In a 
videogame, it often takes the form of a little movie before the game starts. Having 
a good hook is very important. It gives the guest a hint of what is to come and pro­
vides a nice interest spike, which will help sustain focus over the less interesting 
part where the experience is beginning to unfold and not much has happened yet.
Once the hook is over, we settle down to business. If the experience is well 
crafted, the guest’s interest will continually rise, temporarily peaking at points like 
(C) and (E) and occasionally dropping down a bit to points like (D) and (F), only in 
anticipation of rising again.
Finally, at point (G), there is a climax of some kind, and by point (H), the story is 
resolved, the guest is satisfied, and the experience is over. Hopefully, the guest goes out 
with some interest left over, perhaps even more than when they came in. When show 
business veterans say “leave them wanting more,” this is what they are talking about.
Of course, not every good entertainment experience follows this exact curve. But 
most successful entertainment experiences will contain some of the elements that 
our picture of a good interest curve displays.
This diagram, on the other hand, shows an interest curve for a less successful 
entertainment experience. There are lots of possibilities for bad interest curves, but 
this one is particularly bad, although not as uncommon as one might hope.

CHAPTER Sixteen • EXPERIENCES CAN BE JUDGED BY THEIR INTEREST CURVES
As in our good curve, the guest comes in with some interest at point (a) but is 
immediately disappointed, and due to the lack of a decent hook, the guest’s interest 
begins to wane.
Eventually, something somewhat interesting happens, which is good, but it 
doesn’t last, peaking at point (b), and the guest’s interest continues its downhill 
slide until it crosses, at point (c), the interest threshold. This is the point where the 
guest has become so disinterested in the experience that he changes the channel, 
leaves the theater, closes the book, or shuts off the game.
This dismal dullness doesn’t continue forever, and something interesting does 
happen later at point (d), but it doesn’t last, and instead of coming to a climax, the 
experience just peters out at point (e)—not that it matters, since the guest probably 
gave up on it some time ago.
Interest curves can be a very useful tool when creating an entertainment experi­
ence. By charting out the level of expected interest over the course of an experience, 
trouble spots often become clear and can be corrected. Further, when observing 
guests having the experience, it is useful to compare their level of observed inter­
est to the level of interest that you, as an entertainer, anticipated they would have. 
Often, plotting different curves for different demographics is a useful exercise. 
Depending on your experience, it might be great for some groups but boring for 
others (e.g., “guy movies” vs. “chick flicks”), or it might be an experience with 
“something for everyone,” meaning well-structured curves for several different 
demographic groups.
Patterns inside Patterns
Once you start thinking about games and entertainment experiences in terms of 
interest curves, you start seeing the pattern of the good interest curve everywhere. 
You can see it in the three-act structure of a Hollywood movie. You can see it in the 
structure of popular songs (musical intro, verse, chorus, verse, chorus, bridge, big 
finish). When Aristotle says that every tragedy has a complication and a denoue­
ment, you can see it there. When comedians talk about the “rule of three,” you can 
see the interest curve. Anytime someone tells a story that is interesting, engaging, 
or funny, the structure is there, like in this “High Dive Horror” story, which was 
sent in by a girl to the “Embarrassing Moments” column of a teen magazine:
High Dive Horror
I was at an indoor pool, and my friends had dared me to jump off the highest 
diving board. I’m really afraid of heights, but I climbed all the way up anyway. 
I was looking down, trying to convince myself to jump, when my stomach just 
turned over and I barfed—right into the pool! Even worse, it fell on a group of 
cute guys! I climbed down as fast as I could and hid in the bathroom, but every­
one knew what I’d done!

285
Patterns inside Patterns
You can even see the pattern quite concretely in the layout of a roller coaster 
track. And naturally, this pattern shows up in games. The first time I found myself 
using it was when I was working on the Mark 2 version of Aladdin’s Magic Carpet 
virtual reality experience for Disneyland. Some of us on the team had been discuss­
ing how, although the experience was a lot of fun, it seemed to drag a little bit at 
one point, and we were talking about how to improve that. It occurred to me that 
drawing an interest curve of the game would probably be a good idea. It had a shape 
roughly like this:
And suddenly it was very clear to me that the flat part was a real problem. How 
to fix it wasn’t obvious. Simply putting more interesting moments in it might not be 
enough—since if the interest level was too high, it would diminish the interest of 
what was to come later. I finally realized that it might make the most sense to cut 
the flat part from the game entirely. Talking to the show director, he was opposed 
to cutting it—he felt we’d put too much work into it to cut it now, which was under­
standable because we were pretty late in development at this point. Instead, he 
suggested putting a shortcut at the beginning of the flat part so that some players 
could bypass that area if they wanted. We put the shortcut in (a merchant’s tent you 
could fly into that magically transported you to the heart of the city), and it was 
clear that players who knew about it preferred to take it. Observing the game in use 
after installation, it was common to see the game operators watching the players 
progress on monitors suddenly lean down to a player and whisper in their ear “go 
in that tent!” When I first witnessed this, I asked the operator why she told them 
that, and she replied, “Well, I don’t know … they just seem to have more fun when 
they go that way.”
But the Magic Carpet experience was a brief one—only about five minutes long. 
It makes sense to ask whether this pattern is meaningful at all for longer experi­
ences. Will what works for a five-minute experience still work for one that goes on 
for hours? As some evidence that it does, consider the game of Half-Life 2, one of 
the most critically acclaimed games of all time. Look at this graph of the number 
of player deaths that happen through a game of Half-Life 2, Episode 1, which has an 
average completion time of five hours and thirty-nine minutes.

CHAPTER Sixteen • EXPERIENCES CAN BE JUDGED BY THEIR INTEREST CURVES
The three lines indicate the three difficulty settings for the game. Do these 
shapes look familiar? It can certainly be argued that the number of times a player 
dies is a good indicator of challenge, which is connected to how interesting the 
experience is.
But what about even longer experiences like multiplayer games, where a 
player might play for hundreds of hours? How can the same pattern hold up for 
a five hundred hour experience? The answer is a little surprising: interest curve 
patterns can be fractal.
In other words, each long peak, upon closer examination, can have an internal 
structure that looks like the overall pattern, something like.

Patterns inside Patterns
And of course, this can go as many layers deep as you like. Typical videogames 
have this pattern in roughly three levels:
	1.	 Overall game: Intro movie, followed by a series of levels of rising interest, end­
ing with a major climax where the player defeats the game.
	2.	 Each level: New aesthetics or challenges engage the player at the start, and then 
the player is confronted with a series of challenges (battles, puzzles, etc.) that 
provide rising interest until the end of the level, which often ends with some 
kind of “boss battle.”
	3.	 Each challenge: Every challenge the player encounters hopefully has a good 
interest curve in itself, with an interesting introduction, and stepped rising chal­
lenges as you work your way through it.
Multiplayer games have to give the player an even larger structure, which we’ll 
discuss further in Chapter 24, “Communities.”
Interest curves will prove to be one of the most useful and versatile tools you can 
use as a game designer, so let’s add them to our toolbox.
Lens #69: The Lens of the Interest Curve
Exactly what captivates the human mind often seems different for every per­
son, but the most pleasurable patterns of that captivation are remarkably simi­
lar for everyone. To see how a player’s interest in your experience changes 
over time, ask yourself these questions:
●
●
If I draw an interest curve of my experience, how is it generally shaped?
●
●
Does it have a hook?
●
●
Does it have gradually rising interest, punctuated by periods of rest?
●
●
Is there a grand finale, more interesting than everything else?
●
●
What changes would give me a better interest curve?
●
●
Is there a fractal structure to my interest curve? Should there be?
●
●
Do my intuitions about the interest curve match the observed interest of 
the players? If I ask playtesters to draw an interest curve, what does it look 
like?
Since all players are different, you may find it quite useful to use the Lens 
of the Interest Curve and Lens #19, The Player, at the same time, creating a 
unique interest curve for each of the types of players your game is trying to 
reach.

288
CHAPTER Sixteen • EXPERIENCES CAN BE JUDGED BY THEIR INTEREST CURVES
What Comprises Interest?
At this point, you might find your analytical left brain crying out, “I like these charts 
and graphs, but how can I objectively evaluate how interesting something is to another 
person? This all seems very touchy-feely!” And it is very touchy-feely. Many people 
ask what the “units of interest” are. And there is no good answer for that—we do not 
yet have a fun-o-meter that can give a reading in “millifuns.” But that’s okay, because 
all we care about are relative changes in interest—absolute interest is less important.
To determine the interest level, you have to experience it with your whole self, using 
your empathy and imagination and using skills of the right brain as well as the left. 
Still, your left brain may be happy to know that overall interest can be broken down 
further into other factors. There are many ways to do that, but I like to use these three:
Factor 1: Inherent Interest
Some events are simply more interesting than others. Generally, risk is more inter­
esting than safety, fancy is more interesting than plain, and the unusual is more 
interesting than the ordinary. Dramatic change and the potential for dramatic 
change are always interesting. Accordingly, a story about a man wrestling an alli­
gator is probably going to be more interesting than a story about a man eating a 
cheese sandwich. We simply have internal drives that push us to be more interested 
in some things than others. Lens #6, Curiosity, comes in handy when evaluating 
inherent interest, but it is a useful enough concept that it gets its own lens.
Lens #70: The Lens of Inherent Interest
Drama is anticipation mingled with uncertainty.
—William Archer
Some things are just interesting. Use this lens to be sure your game has inher­
ently interesting qualities by asking these questions:
●
●
What aspects of my game will capture the interest of a player immediately?
●
●
Does my game let the player see or do something they have never seen or 
done before?
●
●
What base instincts does my game appeal to? Can it appeal to more of them?
●
●
What higher instincts does my game appeal to? Can it appeal to more of those?
●
●
Does dramatic change and anticipation of dramatic change happen in my 
game? How can it be more dramatic?

289
What Comprises Interest?
The events don’t stand alone, however. They build on one another, creating what 
is often called the story arc. Part of the inherent interest of events depends on how 
they relate to one another. For example, in the story of Goldilocks and the Three 
Bears, most of the events in the story aren’t very interesting: Goldilocks eats por­
ridge, sits in chairs, and takes a nap. But these boring events make possible the 
more interesting part of the story where the bears discover their home has been 
disturbed.
Factor 2: Poetry of Presentation
This refers to the aesthetics of the entertainment experience. The more beautiful 
the artistry used in presenting the experience, whether that artistry be writing, 
music, dance, acting, comedy, cinematography, graphic design, or whatever, the 
more interesting and compelling the guests will find it. Of course, if you can give a 
beautiful presentation to something that is inherently interesting in the first place, 
all the better. We will discuss this further in Chapter 22, “Aesthetics,” but let’s add 
this useful idea to our toolbox right now.
Factor 3: Projection
This is the extent to which you compel a guest to use their powers of empathy 
and imagination to put themselves into the experience. This factor is crucial to 
understanding the commonality between story and gameplay and requires some 
explanation.
Consider the example of winning the lottery (an inherently interesting event). If a 
stranger wins the lottery, you might be mildly interested in hearing about it. If one of 
your friends wins the lottery, that is somewhat more interesting. If you win the lottery, 
Lens #71: The Lens of Beauty
Beauty is mysterious. Why, for example, do the most beautiful things have 
a touch of sadness about them? Use this lens to contemplate the mysteries of 
beauty in your game by asking yourself these questions:
●
●
What elements make up my game? How can each one be more beautiful?
●
●
Some things are not beautiful in themselves, but are beautiful in combina­
tion. How can the elements of my game be composed in a way that is poetic 
and beautiful?
●
●
What does beauty mean within the context of my game?

290
CHAPTER Sixteen • EXPERIENCES CAN BE JUDGED BY THEIR INTEREST CURVES
you will surely be interested enough to focus your attention on that fact. Events that 
happen to us are just more interesting than events that happen to other people.
You would think that this would put storytellers at a disadvantage, since the 
stories they tell are usually about someone else, often someone you have never 
heard of, or even someone who doesn’t actually exist. However, storytellers know 
that guests have the power of empathy, the ability to put themselves in the place of 
another person. An important part of the art of storytelling is to create characters 
that the guests can empathize with easily, for the more the guests can empathize 
with the characters, the more interesting the events become that happen to those 
characters. When you start almost any entertainment experience, the characters in 
it are strangers. As you get to know them, they become like your friends and you 
begin to care about what happens to them, and your interest in events involving 
them grows. At some point, you might even mentally put yourself in their place, 
bringing you to the height of projection.
In terms of trying to build projection, imagination is as important as empa­
thy. Humans exist in two worlds: the outward-facing world of perception and the 
inward-facing world of imagination. Every entertainment experience creates its own 
little world in the imagination. This world does not have to be realistic (although it 
might be), but it does need to be internally consistent. When the world is consistent 
and compelling, it fills the guest’s imagination, and mentally, the guest enters the 
world. We often say that the guest is “immersed” in the world. This kind of immer­
sion increases projection, boosting the overall interest of the guest significantly. The 
suspension of disbelief that keeps the guest immersed in the story world is fragile 
indeed. One small contradiction is all it takes to bring the guest back to reality and 
“take them out” of the experience.
Episodic forms of entertainment, such as soap operas, sitcoms, and serialized 
fiction, take advantage of the power of projection by creating characters and a 
world that persist from one entertainment experience to the next. Returning guests 
are already familiar with these persistent characters and settings, and each time

What Comprises Interest?
they experience an episode, their projection grows, and the fantasy world becomes 
“more real.” This episodic strategy can quickly backfire, however, if the creator fails 
to carefully maintain the integrity of the characters and the world. If new aspects of 
the world contradict previously established aspects or if the regular characters start 
to do or say things that are “out of character” to serve the storyline of some new 
episode, then not only is the episode compromised, but the integrity of the entire 
fantasy world, which spans all episodes, past, present, and future. From the guest’s 
point of view, one bad episode can spoil the entire series, because the compromised 
characters and setting will seem phony from the point of contradiction onward and 
it will be difficult for the guest to sustain projection.
Another way to build up the player’s projection into the world you have cre­
ated is to provide multiple ways to enter that world. Many people think of toys and 
games based on popular movies or television shows as nothing but a gimmicky way 
to make a few extra dollars by riding the coattails of a successful entertainment 
experience. But these toys and games provide new ways for children to access an 
established fantasy world. The toys let them spend more time in that world, and the 
longer they spend imagining they are in the fantasy world, the greater their projec­
tion into that world and the characters in it becomes. We will talk more about this 
idea in Chapter 19, “Worlds.”
Interactive entertainment has an even more remarkable advantage, in terms of 
projection. The guest can be the main character. The events actually happen to 
the guest and are all the more interesting for that reason. Also, unlike story-based 
entertainment, where the story world exists only in the guest’s imagination, interac­
tive entertainment creates significant overlap between perception and imagination, 
allowing the guest to directly manipulate and change the story world. This is why 
videogames can present events with little inherent interest or poetry but still be 
compelling to guests. What they lack in inherent interest and poetry of presenta­
tion, they can often make up for in projection.
We will discuss projection further in Chapter 20, “Characters” when we talk 
about avatars, but let’s introduce a lens to examine it now.
Lens #72: The Lens of Projection
One key indicator that someone is enjoying an experience is that they have 
projected their imaginations into it. When they do this, their enjoyment of 
the experience increases significantly, in a sort of virtuous circle. To examine 
whether your game is well suited to induce projection from your players, ask 
yourself these questions:
●
●
What is there in my game that players can relate to? What else can I add?
●
●
What is there in my game that will capture a player’s imagination? What

CHAPTER Sixteen • EXPERIENCES CAN BE JUDGED BY THEIR INTEREST CURVES
Interest Factor Examples
To ensure the relationship between the interest factors is clear, let’s compare some 
different entertainment experiences.
Some brave street performers attract attention by juggling running chainsaws. 
This is an inherently interesting event. It is hard not to at least look up when it is 
going on around you. The poetry with which it is presented, however, is usually 
somewhat limited. There is some projection, though, as it is easy to imagine what 
it would be like to catch the wrong end of a chainsaw. When you witness the act in 
person, the projection is even greater.
How about a violin concerto? The events (two sticks rubbed together) are not 
that inherently interesting, and the projection is usually not very notable. In this 
case, the poetry has to carry the experience. If the music isn’t beautifully played, 
the performance will not be very interesting. Now, there are exceptions. The inher­
ent interest can build up when the music is well structured or when the evening’s

program is well structured. If the music makes you feel as if you are in another 
place or if you feel a particular empathy for the musician, there may be significant 
projection (see Figure 16.10).
Consider the popular videogame Tetris. The game mainly consists of an endless 
sequence of falling blocks. This leaves little room for inherent interest or poetry of 
presentation; however, the projection can be intense. The guest makes all the deci­
sions, and success or failure is completely contingent on the guest’s performance. 
This is a shortcut that traditional storytelling is unable to take. In terms of an inter­
esting entertainment experience, the large amount of projection makes up for what 
is lacking in poetry or inherent interest (see Figure 16.11).

CHAPTER Sixteen • EXPERIENCES CAN BE JUDGED BY THEIR INTEREST CURVES
Putting It All Together
Some people find it useful to qualify the types of interest that happen at different 
points in their experience, letting you see which types of interest are holding the 
audience’s interest at different times, creating graphs that look something like:
However you do it, examining the interest that a player has in a game is the best 
way to measure the quality of the experience you are creating. Opinions sometimes 
differ about what shapes are best for an interest curve, but if you don’t take a step 
back and draw an interest curve of your experience, you risk not being able to see 
the forest for the trees. If you get in the habit of creating interest curves, though, you 
will have insights into design that others are likely to miss.
But a problem looms up before us. Games do not always follow the same pattern 
of experience. They are not linear. If that is true, then how can interest curves be 
of any use to us? To address that question properly, we must first spend some time 
discussing the most traditional type of linear entertainment experience.

CHAPTER Seventeen • ONE KIND OF EXPERIENCE IS THE STORY
God never wrote a good play in his life.
—Kurt Vonnegut
Story/Game Duality
At the dawn of the twentieth century, physicists started noticing something very 
strange. They noticed that electromagnetic waves and subatomic particles, which 
had long been thought to be fairly well-understood phenomena, were interacting in 
unexpected ways. Years of theorizing, experimenting, and theorizing again led to 
a bizarre conclusion: waves and particles were the same thing, both manifestations 
of a singular phenomenon. This “wave-particle duality” challenged the underpin­
nings of all that was known about matter and energy and made it clear that we 
didn’t understand the universe quite as well as we had thought.
Now we are well into the next century, and storytellers are faced with a similar 
conundrum. With the advent of computer games, story, and gameplay, two age-
old enterprises with very different sets of rules show a similar duality. Storytellers 
are now faced with a medium where they cannot be certain what path their story 
will take, just as the physicists found that they could no longer be certain what 
path their electrons would take. Both groups can now only speak in terms of 
probabilities.
Historically, stories have been single-threaded experiences that can be enjoyed 
by an individual, and games have been experiences with many possible outcomes 
that are enjoyed by a group. The introduction of the single-player computer game 
challenged these paradigms. Early computer games were simply traditional games, 
such as tic-tac-toe or chess but with the computer acting as the opponent. In the 
mid-1970s, adventure games with storylines began to appear that let the player 
become the main character in the story. Thousands of experiments combining 
story and gameplay began to take place. Some used computers and electronics, and 
others used pencil and paper. Some were brilliant successes, others were dismal 
failures. The one thing these experiments proved was that experiences could be 
created that had elements of both story and gameplay. This fact seriously called 
into question the assumption that stories and games are governed by different sets 
of rules.
There is still much debate about the relationship between story and gameplay. 
Some people are so story-oriented that they believe that adding gameplay is guar­
anteed to ruin a good story. Others feel the opposite—that a game with strong story 
elements has been cheapened somehow. Still others prefer a middle-of-the-road 
approach. As game designer Bob Bates once told me: “Story and gameplay are like 
oil and vinegar. Theoretically they don’t mix, but if you put them in a bottle and 
shake them up real good, they’re pretty good on a salad.”
Setting theory aside, and taking a good look at the game titles that people really 
enjoy, there can be no doubt that stories must do something to enhance gameplay, 

297
Myth of Passive Entertainment
since most games have some kind of strong story element, and it is the rare game 
that has no story element at all. Some stories are thick, epic tales, like the elabo­
rate multihour storytelling of the Final Fantasy series. Others are incredibly subtle. 
Consider the game of chess. It could be a completely abstract game, but it isn’t—it 
has a gossamer thin layer of story about two warring medieval kingdoms. And even 
games with no story built in them at all tend to inspire players to make up a story 
to give the game context meaning. I played Liar’s Dice with some school-age kids 
recently, which is a completely abstract dice game. They liked the game, but after a 
few rounds, one of them said, “Let’s pretend we are pirates— playing for our souls!” 
which was greeted with enthusiasm all around the table.
Ultimately, of course, we don’t care about creating either stories or games—we 
care about creating experiences. Stories and games can each be thought of as 
machines that help create experiences. In this chapter, we will discuss how stories 
and games can be combined and what techniques work best for creating experi­
ences that neither a gameless story nor a storyless game could create on its own.
Myth of Passive Entertainment
Before we go any further, I want to deal with the persistent myth that interactive 
storytelling is completely different from traditional storytelling. I would have hoped 
that by this day and age, with story-based games taking in billions of dollars each 
year, this antiquated misconception would be obsolete and long forgotten. Sadly, it 
seems to spring up, weed-like, in the minds of each new generation of novice game 
designers. The argument generally goes like this:
Interactive stories are fundamentally different from noninteractive stories, 
because in noninteractive stories, you are completely passive, just sitting there, 
as the story plods on, with or without you.
At this point, the speaker usually rolls back his eyes, lolls his tongue, and drools 
to underline the point.
In interactive stories, on the other hand, you are active and involved, continu­
ally making decisions. You are doing things, not just passively observing them. 
Really, interactive storytelling is a fundamentally new art form, and as a result, 
interactive designers have little to learn from traditional storytellers.
The idea that the mechanics of traditional storytelling, which are innate to the 
human ability to communicate, are somehow nullified by interactivity is absurd. It 
is a poorly told story that doesn’t compel the listener to think and make decisions 
during the telling. When one is engaged in any kind of storyline, interactive or not, 
one is continually making decisions: “What will happen next?” “What should the 
hero do?” “Where did that rabbit go?” “Don’t open that door!” The difference only 

298
CHAPTER Seventeen • ONE KIND OF EXPERIENCE IS THE STORY
comes in the participant’s ability to take action. The desire to act and all the thoughts 
and emotions that go with that are present in both. A masterful storyteller knows 
how to create this desire within a listener’s mind and then knows exactly how and 
when (and when not) to fulfill it. This skill translates well into interactive media, 
although it is made more difficult because the storyteller must predict, account for, 
respond to, and smoothly integrate the actions of the participant into the experience.
In other words, while interactive storytelling is more challenging than tradi­
tional storytelling, by no means is it fundamentally different. And since story is an 
important part of so many game designs, game designers are well served to learn 
all they can about traditional storytelling techniques.
The Dream
“But wait!” I hear you cry out. “I have a dream of beautiful interactive storytelling—
a dream that rises above mere gameplay, a dream where a wonderfully told story 
is completely interactive, and makes the participant feel like they are in the great­
est movie ever made, while still having complete freedom of action, thought, and 
expression! Surely this dream can’t be achieved if we continue to imitate past forms 
of story and gameplay.”
And I admit that it is a beautiful dream—one that has spurred the creation of 
many fascinating experiments in interactive storytelling. But so far, no one has 
come anywhere close to realizing this dream. But this hasn’t stopped people from 
creating interactive storytelling experiences that are truly wonderful, enjoyable, 
and memorable, despite the fact that they are somewhat limited in the structure and 
in the freedom they give the participant.
Shortly, we’ll discuss the reasons this dream hasn’t become a reality, and may 
never become a reality. But first, let’s talk about what actually works.
The Reality
Real-World Method 1: The String of Pearls
For all the grand dreams of interactive storytelling, there are two methods that 
dominate the world of game design. The first and most dominant in videogames is 
commonly called the “string of pearls” or sometimes the “rivers and lakes” method. 
It is called this because it can be visually represented like this:
F I G U R E
17.2

299
The Reality
The idea is that a completely noninteractive story (the string) is presented 
in the form of a text, a slideshow, or an animated sequence and then the player 
is given a period of free movement and control (the pearl) with a fixed goal in 
mind. When the goal is achieved, the player travels down the string via another 
noninteractive sequence to the next pearl, in other words, cut scene, game level, 
cut scene, game level.
Many people criticize this method as “not really being interactive,” but play­
ers sure do enjoy it. And really there should be little wonder at that. The string 
of pearls method gives the player an experience where they get to enjoy a finely 
crafted story, punctuated with periods of interactivity and challenge. The reward 
for succeeding at the challenge? More story and new challenges. Though some 
snobs will scoff, it is a neat little system that works very well, and it strikes a nice 
balance between gameplay and storytelling. While older games were sometimes 
ham-fisted with their approach, some newer games, such as Ico, The Walking 
Dead, and The Last of Us, have shown how artfully the string and the pearls can 
be joined together.
Real-World Method 2: The Story Machine
To understand this method, we have to take a good look at what a story is. It is 
nothing more than a sequence of events that someone relates to someone else. 
“I was out of gum, so I went to the drugstore” is a story, just not a very inter­
esting one. A good game, however, tends to generate series of events that are 
interesting, often so interesting that people want to tell someone else what hap­
pened. From this point of view, a good game is like a story machine—generating 
sequences of events that are very interesting indeed. Think of the thousands 
of stories created by the game of baseball or the game of golf. The designers or 
these games never had these stories in mind when they designed the games, 
but the games produced them, nonetheless. Curiously, the more prescripting 
the designer puts into their game (like with the string of pearls), the fewer 
stories their game is likely to produce. Some videogames, such as The Sims or 
Minecraft, are specifically designed to be story generators and are very effective 
in this regard. Some critics say that these games don’t really count as “interac­
tive stories,” because the stories have no author. But we don’t care about that, 
because all we care about is creating great experiences—if someone experiences 
something they consider a great story, and it has no author, does that diminish 
the impact of the experience? Certainly not. In fact, it’s an interesting question 
to consider which is more challenging—to create a great story or to create a sys­
tem that generates great stories when people interact with it. Either way, this is a 
powerful method of interactive storytelling, and one that should not be ignored 
or taken for granted. The vast number of “Let’s Play” videos on YouTube and 

300
CHAPTER Seventeen • ONE KIND OF EXPERIENCE IS THE STORY
twitch.tv are testament that people like to share these stories. Use this lens to 
determine how to make your game a better story generator.
In terms of methods of interactive storytelling, these two methods surely cover 
99% of all games ever created. What is interesting is how opposite they are from 
each other. The string of pearls requires a linear story to be created ahead of time, 
and the story machine thrives when as little story as possible has been created 
ahead of time. “But surely there is something in between!” I hear the dreamer cry. 
“Neither of these methods are the real, true dream of interactive storytelling! The 
first method is basically a linear path, and the second one isn’t really storytelling at 
all—it’s just game design! What about my vision of a wonderfully branching story 
tree, full of AI characters, and dozens of satisfying endings, so that a participant 
will want to enjoy it over and over?”
And this is a good question. Why isn’t this vision a reality? Why isn’t it the domi­
nant form of interactive storytelling? The usual suspects (conservative publishers, a 
weak-minded mass audience, lazy designers) are not to blame. The reason that this 
vision isn’t a reality is because it is riddled with many challenging problems that 
haven’t been successfully solved yet—and may never be solved. These problems are 
real and serious and deserve careful consideration.
Lens #73: The Lens of the Story Machine
A good game is a machine that generates stories when people play it. To 
make sure your story machine is as productive as possible, ask yourself these 
questions:
●
●
When players have different choices about how to achieve goals, new and 
different stories can arise. How can I add more of these choices?
●
●
Different conflicts lead to different stories. How can I allow more types of 
conflict to arise from my game?
●
●
When players can personalize the characters and setting, they will care 
more about story outcomes, and similar stories can start to feel very differ­
ent. How can I let players personalize the story?
●
●
Good stories have good interest curves. Do my rules lead to stories with 
good interest curves?
●
●
A story is only good if you can tell it. Who can your players tell the story to 
that will actually care?

301
The Problems
The Problems
Problem #1: Good Stories Have Unity
Really, it is a simple thing to make an interactive story tree. Just keep making 
choices that lead to more choices that lead to more choices. Do that and you’ll 
get all kinds of stories. But how many of them will be enjoyable? What kind of 
interest curve will they have? One thing that we know about good stories is that 
they have intense unity—the problem that is presented in the first five minutes of 
the story is a driving force that has meaning all the way until the end. Imagine 
an interactive Cinderella story. “You are Cinderella. Your stepmother has told 
you to clean out the fireplace. Do you (1) do it or (2) pack your bags and leave?” 
If Cinderella leaves and, say, gets a job as an administrative assistant, it isn’t 
the Cinderella story anymore. The reason for Cinderella’s wretched situation is 
so that she can rise out of it dramatically, suddenly, and unexpectedly. No end­
ing you could write for the Cinderella story can compare with the ending that 
it already has, because the whole thing is crafted as a unit—the beginning and 
ending are of a piece. To craft a story with twenty endings and one beginning 
that is the perfect beginning for each of the twenty is challenging, to say the 
least. As a result, most interactive stories with many branching paths end up 
feeling kind of watery, weak, and disconnected.
Problem #2: The Combinatorial Explosion
I fear there are too many realities.
—John Steinbeck, Travels with Charley
It seems so simple to propose: I’ll give the player three choices in this scene, 
three in the next, and so on. But let’s say your story is ten choices deep—if each 
choice leads to a unique event and three new choices, you will need to write 88,573 
different outcomes to the choices the player will make. And if ten choices sound 
kind of short, and you want to have twenty opportunities for three choices from 
the beginning to the end of the story, that means you’ll need to write 5,230,176,601 
outcomes. These large numbers make any kind of meaningful branching storytell­
ing impossible in our short life spans. And sadly, the main way that most interac­
tive storytellers deal with this perplexing plethora of plotlines is to start fusing 
outcomes together—something like (Figure 17.3):
And this certainly makes the storytelling more manageable, but look at what has 
just happened. For all the choices the player had (well, not that many here, really), 
they all end up at the same place. How meaningful can these choices have been 
if they all lead to the same conclusion? The combinatorial explosion is frustrating 

302
CHAPTER Seventeen • ONE KIND OF EXPERIENCE IS THE STORY
because it leads to compromises on top of Band-Aids on top of compromises and 
ultimately a weak story. And you still have to write a lot more scenes than the player 
will ever see.
Problem #3: Multiple Endings Disappoint
One thing that interactive storytellers like to fantasize about is how wonderful it is 
that a story can have multiple endings. After all, this means the player will be able 
to play again and again with a different experience every time! And like many 
fantasies, the reality tends to disappoint. Many games have experimented with 
having multiple endings to their game story. Almost universally, the player ends 
up thinking two things when they encounter their first ending in one of these:
	1.	 “Is this the real ending?” In other words, the happiest ending, or the ending that 
is most unified with the story beginning. We all like to dream that we can find 
a way to write equally valid endings, but because good stories have unity, this 
generally doesn’t happen. And when players start to suspect they may be on the 
wrong track, they stop experiencing the story and start thinking about what they 
should have done instead, which defeats any attempt at storytelling. The string 
of pearls has a tremendous advantage here—the player is always on the correct 
story path, and they know it—any problem-solving action is surely a path toward 
a rewarding ending.
	2.	 “Do I have to play this whole thing again to see another ending?” In other 
words, the multiple endings go against the idea of unity, and as much as we 
would like to dream that the gameplay would be significantly different if the 
player made different choices, it almost never is, and so the player now has to go 
on a long repetitive trudge to explore the story tree, which probably will not be 
worth the effort and tedium, since there is likely a lot of repeated content upon 
F I G U R E
17.3

303
The Problems
a second playing (in an attempt to manage a combinatorial explosion), which 
will look pretty bad under Lens #4, Surprise. Some games have tried novel 
approaches to deal with this problem. The infamous game Psychic Detective 
(once summed up in a review as “One of the worst games ever made. Also, a 
masterpiece”) was a continuously moving 30-minute experience that always 
culminated in a final psychic battle with the villain, in which your powers were 
determined by the path you took through the game. As a result, to master the 
game, you had to play it through over and over again. Since most of the game 
consists of video clips, and the game tree has some significant bottlenecks that 
you must experience every time, the designers filmed multiple versions of the 
bottleneck areas, each with different dialog but containing the same informa­
tion. As hard as the designers worked to solve the problem of repeated content 
(and many other problems), players generally found the process of replaying the 
interactive story somewhat tedious.
There are exceptions, of course. Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic featured 
a novel type of player choice—did they want to play the game on the “light 
side” or “dark side” of the force, that is, with good or evil goals? Depending on 
which of the paths you choose, you have different adventures, different quests, 
and ultimately a different ending. It can be argued that this isn’t really a case 
of two different endings on the same story, but two completely different sto­
ries—so different that they are each equally valid. Players who try to take the 
middle path (the, uh, beige side of the force?) generally find the experience to be 
dissatisfactory.
Problem #4: Not Enough Verbs
The things that videogame characters spend their time doing are very different than 
the things that characters in movies and books spend their time doing:
Videogame verbs: run, shoot, jump, climb, throw, cast, punch, fly
Movie verbs: talk, ask, negotiate, convince, argue, shout, plead, complain
Videogame characters are severely limited in their ability to do anything that 
requires something to happen above the neck. Most of what happens in stories is 
communication, and at the present time, videogames just can’t support that. Game 
designer Chris Swain has suggested that when technology advances to the point 
that players can have an intelligent, spoken conversation with computer-controlled 
game characters, it will have an effect similar to the introduction of talking pic­
tures. Suddenly, a medium that was mostly considered an amusing novelty will 
quickly become the dominant form of cultural storytelling. Until then, however, the 
lack of usable verbs in videogames significantly hampers our ability to use games 
as a storytelling medium.

304
CHAPTER Seventeen • ONE KIND OF EXPERIENCE IS THE STORY
Problem #5: Time Travel Makes Tragedy Obsolete
Of all the problems that interactive storytelling faces, this final one is quite possibly 
the most overlooked, the most crippling, and the most insoluble. The question is often 
asked, “Why don’t videogames make us cry?” and this may well be the answer. Tragic 
stories are often considered the most serious, most important, and most moving type 
of story. Unfortunately, they are generally off limits to the interactive storyteller.
Freedom and control are one of the most exciting parts of any interactive story, 
but they come at a terrible price: the storyteller must give up inevitability. In a pow­
erful tragic story, there is a moment where you can see the horrible thing that is 
going to happen, and you feel yourself wishing, begging, and hoping that it won’t—
but you are powerless to stop this path toward inevitable destiny. This rush of being 
carried along toward certain doom is something that videogame stories simply can­
not support, for it is as if every protagonist has a time machine, and anything seri­
ously bad that happens can always be undone. How could you make a game out of 
Romeo and Juliet, for example, where Shakespeare’s ending (spoiler alert: they both 
commit suicide) is the “real” ending for the game?
Not all good stories are tragic of course. But any experience that met the qualifica­
tions of the dream of interactive fiction should at least have the potential for tragedy. 
Instead, we get what the narrator in Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time intones when 
your character dies: “Wait — that’s not what really happened…” Freedom and destiny 
are polar opposites. As such, any solution to this problem has to be very clever indeed.
The Dream Reborn
The problems with the dream of interactive storytelling are not trivial. Perhaps, one 
day, artificial personalities so realistic that it is impossible to tell them from humans 
will be intimately involved in our story and game experiences, but even that does 
not solve all of the problems presented here—anymore than a well-run game of 
Dungeons and Dragons, where human intelligence is behind every game character, 
can solve all these problems. No magic solution is likely to solve all five at once. 
This is not a reason to despair; the reason the dream is a failure is because it is 
flawed. Flawed, because it is obsessed with story, not with experience, and experi­
ence is all we care about. Focusing on story structure at the expense of experience 
is the same sin as focusing too much on technology, on aesthetics, or on gameplay 
structure at the expense of experience. Does this mean we need to discard our 
dreams? No—we just need to improve them. When you change your dream to one 
of creating innovative, meaningful, and mind-expanding experiences and keep in 
mind these may need to mix and blend traditional story and game structures in 
untraditional ways, the dream can come true for you every day. We live in a sea 
of stories, but most people new to storytelling find it harder than they expect. The 
following tips and Chapter 18, “Indirect Control,” address some interesting ways 
to make the story elements of your game as interesting and involving as possible.

305
Story Tips for Game Designers
Story Tips for Game Designers
Story Tip #1: Goals, Obstacles, and Conflicts
It is an old maxim of Hollywood screenwriting that the main ingredients for a story 
are (1) a character with a goal and (2) obstacles that keep him or her from reaching 
that goal.
As the character tries to overcome the obstacles, interesting conflicts tend to arise, 
particularly when another character has a conflicting goal. This simple pattern leads to 
very interesting stories because it means the character has to engage in problem solv­
ing (which we find very interesting); because conflicts lead to unpredictable results, 
in other words surprises (which we find very interesting); and because the bigger the 
obstacle, the bigger the potential for dramatic change (which we find very interesting).
Are these ingredients just as useful when creating videogame stories? Absolutely—
and maybe even more so. We’ve already discussed Lens #32, Goals—the goal of the 
main character will be the goal of the player and will be the driving force that 
keeps them moving along the string of pearls, if you choose to create one. And the 
obstacles that character meets will be the challenges the player faces. If you want 
your game to have a solidly integrated story, it is very important that these things 
line up—if you give the player a challenge that has nothing to do with the obstacles 
the main character faces, you have just weakened the experience considerably. But 
if you can find a way to make the challenges of the game meaningful, as well as 
dramatic obstacles for the main character, your story and game structure will fuse 
into one, which goes a long way toward making the player feel like part of the story. 
We already have a Lens of Goals—here is its sister lens.
Lens #74: The Lens of the Obstacle
A goal with no obstacles is not worth pursuing. Use this lens to make sure 
your obstacles are ones that your players will want to overcome.
●

What is the relationship between the main character and the goal? Why 
does the character care about it?
●
●
What are the obstacles between the character and the goal?

●
Is there an antagonist who is behind the obstacles? What is the relationship 
between the protagonist and the antagonist?

Do the obstacles gradually increase in difficulty?

●
Some say “the bigger the obstacle, the better the story.” Are your obstacles 
big enough? Can they be bigger?

●
Great stories often involve the protagonist transforming in order to over­
come the obstacle. How does your protagonist transform?

CHAPTER Seventeen • ONE KIND OF EXPERIENCE IS THE STORY
Story Tip #2: Make It Real
Know your world as God knows this one.
—Robert McKee
It is one thing to come up with a plot line, a list of characters, and a set of rules 
for a fantasy world. It is something else again to see it in your mind, as if it is a 
real place. To get there, you must think about it constantly, imagining you are one 
of the characters living in the world. One of the secrets of ride design at Disney 
is that each experience, such as the Haunted Mansion or Splash Mountain, has 
an elaborate backstory that is not shared with the public, but all the designers 
know it and they use it to keep the world solid. Tolkien did not simply sit down 
and write The Lord of the Rings one day; instead, he spent years imagining and 
documenting the world of Middle Earth, its history, people, and languages before 
the stories really began to take shape. That level of detailed planning is seldom 
necessary, but if you can’t answer basic questions about the history of your world 
and the motivations of your characters, it will show in your work, and people will 
see it for what it is: unimaginative. Always remember: If it’s not real to you, it’s 
not real to them.
Story Tip #3: Provide Simplicity and Transcendence
One thing that game worlds and fantasy worlds tend to have in common is that 
they offer the player a combination of simplicity (the game world is simpler than 
the real world) and transcendence (the player is more powerful in the game 
world than they are in the real world). This potent combination explains why 
so many types of story worlds show up again and again in games, such as the 
following:
●
●
Medieval: The stream of swords and sorcery worlds seems to be never ending. 
These worlds are simpler than the world we know, because the technologies are 
primitive. But they are seldom accurate simulations of medieval times—there is 
almost always some kind of magic added, and this provides the transcendence. 
The continued success of this genre surely stems from the fact that it combines 
the simple and the transcendent in such a primal way.
●
●
Futuristic: Many games and science fiction stories are set in the future. But these 
very seldom are any kind of realistic interpretation of the future we are likely to 
see—one with continued suburban sprawl, safer cars, longer work hours, and 
ever more complicated cell phone plans. No—the future that we see in these 
worlds is usually more of a post-apocalyptic future; in other words, a bomb went 
off, or we are on some strange frontier planet, and the world is much simpler. 
And of course we have access to sufficiently advanced technologies—which, as

Story Tips for Game Designers
Arthur C. Clarke noted, are indistinguishable from magic—at least in terms of 
transcendence.
●
●
War: In war, things are simpler, since all normal rules and laws are set aside. 
And the transcendence comes from a powerful weaponry that lets participants 
become like gods, deciding who lives and who dies. It is a horror in reality, but 
in fantasy it gives a player powerful feelings of simplicity and transcendence.
●
●
Modern: Modern settings are unusual for game stories, unless the player suddenly 
has surprisingly more power than normal. This can be accomplished in many ways. 
The Grand Theft Auto series uses criminal life to give both simplicity (life is simpler 
when you don’t obey laws) and transcendence (you are more powerful when you 
don’t obey laws). The Sims creates a simplified dollhouse version of human life, and 
it gives the player transcendent godlike powers to control the characters in the game.
●
●
Abstract: Abstract worlds, such as Minecraft, are not only simpler than the real 
world; they are simpler than the average videogame! As Notch discovered, com­
bining that simplicity with the godlike power to create and destroy can create a 
pretty successful game.
Simplicity and transcendence form a powerful combination that is easily botched. 
Use this lens to make sure you combine them just right.
Story Tip #4: Consider the Hero’s Journey
In 1949, mythologist Joseph Campbell published his first book, The Hero with a 
Thousand Faces. In this text, he describes an underlying structure that most mytho­
logical stories seem to share, which he calls the monomyth, or hero’s journey. He 
goes into great detail about how this structure underlies the stories of Moses, Buddha, 
Christ, Odysseus, Prometheus, Osiris, and many others. Many writers and artists 
found great inspiration in Campbell’s work. Most famously, George Lucas based the 
structure of Star Wars around structures Campbell described, with great success.
Lens #75: The Lens of Simplicity and Transcendence
To make sure you have the right mix of simplicity and transcendence, ask 
yourself these questions:
●
●
How is my world simpler than the real world? Can it be simpler in other ways?
●
●
What kind of transcendent power do I give to the player? How can I give 
even more without removing challenge from the game?
●
●
Is my combination of simplicity and transcendence contrived, or does it 
provide my players with a special kind of wish fulfillment?

CHAPTER Seventeen • ONE KIND OF EXPERIENCE IS THE STORY
In 1992, Christopher Vogler, a Hollywood writer and producer, published a 
book called The Writer’s Journey, which was a practical guide to writing stories 
using the archetypes that Campbell describes. Vogler’s book is not as scholarly 
as Campbell’s text, but it serves as a far more accessible and practical guide for 
writers who would like to use the hero’s journey as a framework. The Wachowski 
brothers, who wrote The Matrix (which rather clearly follows the hero’s journey 
model), are said to have used Vogler’s book as a guide. As accessible as the text is, 
it is often criticized for being over-formulaic and for shoehorning too many stories 
into a single formula. Nonetheless, many people find it gives them useful insights 
into the structure of heroic stories.
Because so many videogames revolve around a theme of heroism, it is only logi­
cal that the hero’s journey is a relevant structure for a powerful videogame story. 
Since several books and a plethora of websites already exist describing how to 
structure a story around the hero’s journey, I will only give an overview of it here.
Vogler’s Synopsis of the Hero’s Journey
	  1.	 The ordinary world—Establishing scenes that show our hero is a regular 
­person leading an ordinary life.
	  2.	The call to adventure—The hero is presented with a challenge that disrupts 
their ordinary life.
	  3.	 Refusal of the call—The hero makes excuses about why he can’t go on the 
adventure.
	  4.	Meeting with the mentor—Some wise figure gives advice, training, or aid.
	  5.	 Crossing the threshold—The hero leaves the ordinary world (often under pres­
sure) and enters the adventure world.
	  6.	Tests, allies, enemies—The hero faces minor challenges, makes allies, ­confronts 
enemies, and learns the workings of the adventure world.
	  7.	 Approaching the cave—The hero encounters setbacks and needs to try some­
thing new.
	  8.	The ordeal—The hero faces a peak life or death crisis.
	  9.	 The reward—The hero survives, overcomes their fear, and gets the reward.
	10.	 The road back—The hero returns to the ordinary world, but the problems still 
aren’t all solved.
	11.	 Resurrection—The hero faces a still greater crisis and has to use everything he 
has learned.
	12.	Returning with the elixir—The journey is now well and truly complete, and 
the hero’s success has improved the lives of everyone in the ordinary world.
By no means do you need to have all twelve of these steps in your heroic story—you 
can tell a good heroic story with fewer or more or in a different order.

Story Tips for Game Designers
As a side note, it is an interesting exercise to look at the hero’s journey through 
Lens #69, Interest Curve—you will see a familiar form emerge.
Some storytellers take great offense at the idea that good storytelling can be 
accomplished by formula. But the hero’s journey is not so much a formula, guar­
anteed to produce an entertaining story; rather, it is a form that many entertaining 
stories tend to take. Think of it as a skeleton. Just as humans have tremendous 
variety despite all of us having the same 208 bones, heroic stories can take millions 
of forms despite some common internal structure.
Most storytellers seem to agree that using the hero’s journey as a starting point 
for your writing isn’t a very good idea. As Bob Bates puts it:
The Hero’s Journey isn’t a box of tools you can use to fix every story problem. But 
it’s somewhat similar to a circuit tester. You can clamp the leads around a prob­
lem spot in your story and check to see if there’s enough mythical current flowing. 
And if you don’t have enough juice, it can help point out the source of the problem.
Better to write your story first, and if you notice that it might have something 
in common with elements of the monomyth, then spend some time considering 
whether your story might be improved by following archetypical structures and 
elements more closely. In other words, use the hero’s journey as a lens.
Story Tip #5: Put Your Story to Work!
As we discussed in Chapter 5, “Elements,” it is possible to start a design in any corner 
of the tetrad—story, gameplay, technology, or aesthetics. And many designs begin 
with a story. Following that story too slavishly, at the expense of the other elements, 
is a common mistake—and an especially silly one, since story is, in some ways, the 
most pliable of all the elements! Story elements can often be changed with just a few 
words, where changing elements of gameplay might takes weeks of balancing, and 
changing elements of technology might take months of reprogramming.
Lens #76: The Lens of the Hero’s Journey
Many heroic stories have similar structure. Use this lens to make sure you 
haven’t missed out on any elements that might improve your story. Ask your­
self these questions:
●
●
Does my story have elements that qualify it as a heroic story?
●
●
If so, how does it match up with the structure of the hero’s journey?
●
●
Would my story be improved by including more archetypical elements?
●
●
Does my story match this form so closely that it feels hackneyed?

CHAPTER Seventeen • ONE KIND OF EXPERIENCE IS THE STORY
I once heard some developers of a 3DO game talk about some development head­
aches they were having. Their game involved flying over a planet in a spaceship and 
shooting down enemy ships. The game was 3D, and to maintain performance, they 
could not afford to draw distant terrain. To keep the terrain from looking strange 
when it popped in, they had planned to use the old trick of making the world foggy. 
But due to some quirk of the 3D hardware, the only fog they could make was a weird 
green color that looked completely unrealistic. Initially, the team assumed they would 
have to scrap this solution, when suddenly, story to the rescue! Someone had the idea 
that maybe the evil aliens who had taken over the planet had done so by shrouding 
it with toxic gas. This little change in the story suddenly made a technical approach 
that supported the desired gameplay mechanic completely possible. As a side effect, it 
arguably improved the story, making the alien takeover seem all the more dramatic.
I had a similar experience developing my Mordak’s Revenge board game. My 
initial design for the gameplay required players to travel about the board, collect­
ing five keys. When they had all five, they had to journey to the stronghold of the 
evil wizard Mordak to unlock the stronghold and battle him. In playtests, it quickly 
became clear that it would be a better game mechanic if Mordak could somehow 
come to the player who had collected the keys, since it was more immediate, and it 
meant that the battle against Mordak could be fought in a variety of terrains. But I 
was troubled because then the story didn’t make any sense. So, once again, story to 
the rescue! What if, instead, Mordak had a secret stronghold that no one could find? 
And instead of collecting keys, the players had to collect five summoning stones? 
When all five were collected, Mordak could be summoned immediately out of his 
stronghold and forced to battle the player in whatever terrain the player was cur­
rently in. This simple change to the story made the desired gameplay possible. 
It also was more novel than my somewhat trite “villain in the castle” story.
Always keep in mind how limber, flexible, and powerful a story can be—don’t be 
afraid to mold your story to support the gameplay you think is best.
Story Tip #6: Keep Your Story World Consistent
There is an old French saying that goes:
If you add a spoonful of wine to a barrelful of sewage,
you get a barrelful of sewage.
If you add a spoonful of sewage to a barrelful of wine,
you get a barrelful of sewage.
In some ways, story worlds are fragile like the barrelful of wine. One small 
inconsistency in the logic of the world, and the reality of the world is broken for­
ever. In Hollywood, the term “jumping the shark” is used to describe a television 
show that has deteriorated to a point that it can never be taken seriously again. The 
term is a reference to the popular seventies show Happy Days. As a season finale, 

311
Story Tips for Game Designers
the writers had Fonzie, the most popular character in the show, jump over a line of 
school buses on his motorcycle. The episode was greatly hyped and had excellent 
ratings. In the next season, in an attempt to repeat this success, and to play off the 
popularity of the film Jaws, they had a waterskiing Fonzie jump over a shark. This 
was so ridiculous, and so far out of Fonzie’s character, that fans of the show were 
repulsed. The problem was not so much that one particular episode had a ridiculous 
premise, but rather that the character and his world were forever tainted and could 
never be taken seriously again. Here is another example: shortly after the release of 
Mass Effect 3, many players complained at their disappointment with the ending to 
the trilogy. The creators responded, announcing they were going to release a patch 
that changed the ending. This led to a massive uproar, proving that the quality of a 
story is less important than the illusion that it is real. One small error in consistency 
can make a whole world break apart, damaging its past, present, and future.
If you have a set of rules that define how things work in your world, stick with 
them, and take them seriously. If, for example, in your world you can pick up a 
microwave oven and put it in your pocket, that might be a little strange, but maybe 
in your world, pockets are magic and can hold all kinds of things. If later, though, a 
player tries to put an ironing board in their pocket and is told “that is too big for you 
to carry,” the player will be frustrated, will stop taking your story world seriously, 
and will stop projecting his imagination into it. Invisibly, in the blink of an eye, 
your world will have changed from a real, live place to a sad, broken toy.
Story Tip #7: Make Your Story World Accessible
In Jules Verne’s classic tale, From the Earth to the Moon (1865), he tells the story of three 
men who travel to the moon in a spaceship fired from a giant cannon. Despite the fact 
that the book goes into great detail about the science of the cannon, the premise seems 
ridiculous to modern eyes because any cannon blast powerful enough to launch a 
spacecraft would surely kill everyone inside. We know from experience that rockets 
are a far safer and realistic method of sending people to the moon. One might think 
that Verne did not use rockets in his story because they had not yet been invented—but 
this was not the case. Rockets were commonly used as weapons at that time—consider 
the “rockets’ red glare” in the Star Spangled Banner (1814), for instance.
So, surely Verne knew about rockets, and he seems to have had enough of a 
scientific mind to realize that they were a much more reasonable method of putting 
a craft into space than a cannon would be. So why did he write his story this way? 
The answer seems to be that it was much more accessible to his audience.
Consider the progressions of military technology over the course of the nine­
teenth century. First, consider rockets:
1812: William Congreve’s rockets: 6.5” diameter, 42 pounds, two mile range
1840: William Hale’s rockets: same as Congreve’s but slightly more accurate
In nearly thirty years, rockets showed no growth and only slight improvement.

312
CHAPTER Seventeen • ONE KIND OF EXPERIENCE IS THE STORY
But now consider cannons:
1855: Dahlgren’s gun: 100 pound shell, three mile range
1860: Rodman’s Columbiad: 1000 pound shell, six mile range
In a mere five years, the size of a cannon shell had increased by ten times! 
Keeping in mind that the American Civil War was making international headlines 
in 1865, it only took a small leap of the imagination to picture even larger and more 
powerful cannons appearing within the next few years—possibly large enough to 
fire shells clear to the moon.
Verne surely understood that rockets were the most likely method of man 
reaching the moon—but he was a storyteller, not a scientist, and he had the good 
sense to know that when you are telling a story, truth isn’t always your friend. 
What the player will believe and enjoy is more important that what is physically 
accurate.
When I worked on Pirates of the Caribbean: Battle for the Buccaneer Gold, several 
examples of this principle arose. One was the speed of the boat—initially, we took 
pains to make sure our pirate ship traveled at a realistic speed. But we quickly 
found that this speed was so slow (or appeared to be, at our height from the water) 
that players quickly became bored. So, we cast reality to the winds, as it were, and 
just made the boat go at a speed that felt realistic and exciting, even though it was 
not realistic at all. Another example can be clearly seen in this screenshot from 
the game:

Story Tips for Game Designers
Look at those boats and consider which way the wind is blowing. Weirdly, it 
seems to be behind all of them. And indeed it is. To ask players to understand how 
to sail a ship with the wind was simply too much to ask in an action game—and 
no player ever asked us about that; they simply assumed that the boats drove like 
cars or motorboats, because that is what they were familiar with. As a minor detail, 
consider the flags at the top of the ship masts—they are being blown in the opposite 
direction as the sails! The modeler of the ships initially had them facing the correct 
way, but it looked strange to our playtesters, who were more used to seeing a flag 
flying on a car antenna than on a ship’s mast. Our players would frequently ask 
why the flags pointed the wrong way, and we would explain: “No, see, the wind is 
blowing from behind the ships…” and they would say “Oh… hmm…. I guess that’s 
right.” But after a while, we got tired of explaining it, so we just made the flags point 
the other way, and people stopped asking about them, because now they looked 
“normal.”
There are times, though, that your story requires something strange that the 
player has never seen before, which can’t be made readily accessible. In these cases, 
it is very important that you call special attention to that thing and make the players 
understand what it is and how it works. I once had a team of students who made a 
little game about two hamsters in a pet store who fall in love but are unable to meet 
because they are in separate cages. Their game had the player use a little hamster 
cannon to try to launch the boy hamster to the girl hamster’s cage. It was pointed 
out to them that there is no such thing as a hamster cannon, and as a result the 
story seemed kind of strange and hard to believe. One solution would have been 
to change the cannon to something else that could launch the boy hamster, like 
perhaps a hamster wheel, but the team wanted to keep the cannon, so they took 
a different approach. In the establishing shots of the pet shop, they prominently 
featured signs reading “Special! Hamster Cannons on sale!” This not only served 
as an intriguing hook for the experience, creating anticipation to see what a ham­
ster cannon would look like, but it introduced this very strange item to the player 
so that when it showed up, it didn’t seem so strange after all—just a natural part 
of an unusual world. Surreal elements are not at all uncommon in games, and it is 
important that you understand how to smoothly integrate them. One handy way to 
do that is to use this lens.
Lens #77: The Lens of the Weirdest Thing
Having weird things in your story can help give meaning to unusual game 
mechanics—it can capture the interest of the player, and it can make your 
world seem special. Too many things that are too weird, though, will render 
your story puzzling and inaccessible. To make sure your story is the good kind 
of weird, ask yourself these questions:

CHAPTER Seventeen • ONE KIND OF EXPERIENCE IS THE STORY
Story Tip #8: Use Clichés Judiciously
One criticism videogame stories seem unable to escape is overuse of cliché. After all, 
you can only save the world from evil aliens, use your wizardry against an evil dragon, 
or fight a dungeon full of zombies with a shotgun a certain number of times before it 
becomes tedious. This drives some designers to avoid any story setting or theme that 
has been done before—sometimes pushing their story and setting into something so 
offbeat that players are unable to understand what it is or relate to it at all.
For all their potential to be abused, clichés have the tremendous advantage of being 
familiar to the player, and what is familiar is understandable and comprehensible. 
It has been said that every successful videogame finds a way to combine something 
familiar with something novel. Some designers would never make a game about ninjas, 
because ninjas have been done to death. But what if you made a story about a lonely 
ninja, an incompetent ninja, a ninja dog, a robotic ninja, or a third grade girl who leads 
a secret life as a ninja? All of these storylines have the potential to be something new 
and different while having a hook into a world the player already understands.
It is certainly an error to overuse clichés, but it is an equal error to exile them 
from your toolbox.
Story Tip #9: Sometimes a Map Brings a Story to Life
When we think of writing stories, we generally think of words, characters, and 
plotlines. But stories can come from unexpected places. Robert Louis Stevenson 
had no intention of writing what is considered his greatest work: Treasure Island. 
Obligated to entertain a schoolboy during a particularly rainy vacation, he and the 
boy took turns drawing pictures. On a whim, Stevenson drew a map of a fanciful 
island, which suddenly took on a life of its own:
…as I paused upon my map of ‘Treasure Island’, the future character of the book 
began to appear there visibly among imaginary woods; and their brown faces 
and bright weapons peeped out upon me from unexpected quarters, as they 
passed to and fro, fighting and hunting treasure, on these few square inches of 
a flat projection. The next thing I knew I had some papers before me and was 
writing out a list of chapters.
●
●
What’s the weirdest thing in my story?
●
●
How can I make sure that the weirdest thing doesn’t confuse or alienate 
the player?
●
●
If there are multiple weird things, should I maybe get rid of, or coalesce, 
some of them?
●
●
If there is nothing weird in my story, is the story still interesting?

Other Reading to Consider
Most videogames do not happen in world of words, but in a physical place. By 
making sketches and drawings of this place, often a story will naturally take shape, 
as you are compelled to consider who lives there, what they do, and why.
So much more can be said about a story that we cannot possibly cover it all 
here. But whatever you create, whether it be an abstract game with only the thin­
nest veneer of theme and setting or a vast epic adventure with hundreds of detailed 
characters, you are wise to make the story elements of your game as meaningful 
and powerful as possible. So, we end this chapter with a general-purpose lens, 
which can benefit any game as a tool for studying this very important quadrant of 
the elemental tetrad.

In late 1966, musician John Lennon was invited to attend an art exhibition called 
Unfinished Paintings and Objects at the Indica Gallery in London. He had no special 
interest in avant-garde art and had never heard of the artist, a woman named Yoko 
Ono, but when he arrived, one particular piece caught his attention: a tall steplad­
der in the center of the room. Mounted above it, on the ceiling, was a white canvas 
that appeared to be blank. Above the ladder, beside the ceiling-mounted canvas, 
hung a magnifying glass on a chain. John eyed this weird assemblage uncertainly—
was he just supposed to look up at it? The painting looked blank—but if it was, why 
was the magnifier up there? He bolstered his courage, climbed the wobbly ladder, 
and, precariously balancing on the top step, picked up the magnifier and craned his 
neck to look up at the white canvas. At first he thought it was blank, some kind of 
artistic statement about nothingness. But then he saw it: one tiny word, impossible 
to read without the glass, that would change his life forever.
The word was yes.

The Feeling of Freedom
The Feeling of Freedom
In previous chapters, we touched on the conflict between story and gameplay. At 
its heart, this is a conflict about freedom. The wonderful thing about games and 
interactive experiences is the freedom that the player feels—this freedom gives the 
player the wonderful feeling of control and makes it easy for them to project their 
imaginations into the world you have created. The feeling of freedom is so impor­
tant in a game that it merits a new lens.
And even though it makes it very difficult for us to control the interest curve for 
the player, when we give them those wonderful feelings of interactivity and control, 
we have to give them freedom, right?
Wrong.
We don’t always have to give the player true freedom—we only have to give the 
player the feeling of freedom. For, as we’ve discussed, all that’s real is what you 
feel—if a clever designer can make a player feel free, when really the player has 
very few choices, or even no choice at all, then suddenly we have the best of both 
worlds, the player has the wonderful feeling of freedom, and the designer has man­
aged to economically create an experience with an ideal interest curve and an ideal 
set of events.
But how is such a thing possible? How can one create the feeling of freedom, 
when no freedom or very limited freedom exists? After all, a designer has no control 
over what a player does when they enter a game, right?
Lens #79: The Lens of Freedom
A feeling of freedom is one of the things that separate games from other forms 
of entertainment. To make sure your players feel as free as possible, ask your­
self these questions:
●
●
When do my players have freedom of action? Do they feel free at these 
times?
●
●
When are they constrained? Do they feel constrained at these times?
●
●
Are there any places I can let them feel more free than they do now?
●
●
Are there any places where they are overwhelmed by too much freedom?

320
CHAPTER Eighteen • STORY AND GAME STRUCTURES CAN BE ARTFULLY MERGED WITH INDIRECT CONTROL
No, not right. It is true that the designer does not have direct control over what a 
player does, but through various subtle means, they can exert indirect control over 
the actions of a player. And this indirect control is possibly the most subtle, delicate, 
artful, and important technique of any we will encounter.
To understand what I’m talking about, let’s look at some of the methods of indi­
rect control. There are many of them, varied and subtle, but generally these six do 
most of the work.
Indirect Control Method #1: Constraints
Consider the difference between these two requests:
Request 1: Pick a color: _____________
Request 2: Pick a color:   a. red   b. blue   c. green
Both of them give the answerer freedom of choice, and they are both asking for 
about the same thing. But the difference is tremendous because for Request 1, the 
answerer could have chosen one of millions of different answers—“fire engine red,” 
“cauliflower blue,” “mauvish taupe,” “sky blue pink,” “no, you pick a color,” or just 
about anything, really.
But for Request 2, the answerer only has three choices. They still have freedom, 
they still get to choose, but we have managed to cut the number of choices from mil­
lions to three! And the answerers who were going to pick red, blue, or green anyway 
won’t even notice the difference. And still others will prefer Request 2 over Request 
1, because too much freedom can be a daunting thing—it forces your imagination to 
work hard. In my amusement park days, I sometimes worked in the candy store, in 
front of a big display of sixty flavors of old-fashioned stick candy. A hundred times 
a day, people would come in and ask “What flavors do you have back there?” At 
first, I thought I would be a smart aleck and recite all sixty flavors—as I did this, the 
customer’s eyes would get wide with fear, and right around the thirty-second flavor, 
they would say, “Stop! Stop! That’s enough!” They were completely overwhelmed 
by so many choices. After a while, I thought of a new approach. When they asked 
about the flavors, I would say “We have every flavor you can imagine. Go on, name 
the flavors you would like— I’m sure we have them.”
At first they would be impressed with this powerful freedom. But then they 
would furrow up their brows, think hard, and say, “Uh… cherry? No, wait… I don’t 
want that… Hmm…. peppermint? No… Oh, just forget it,” and they would walk 
away in frustration. Finally, I figured out a strategy that sold a lot of candy sticks. 
When someone would ask about the flavors, I would say “We have just about every 
flavor you can imagine, but our most popular flavors are Cherry, Blueberry, Lemon, 
Root Beer, Wintergreen, and Licorice.” They were delighted at having the feeling 
of freedom but also glad to have a small number of attractive choices; in fact, most 
customers would choose from the “popular six,” a list I made up and a list I would 
change frequently to help ensure the other flavors didn’t get too old on the shelf. 

321
Indirect Control Method #2: Goals
This is an example of indirect control in action—by constraining their choices, 
I made it more likely they would make a choice. But not just any choice—the choices 
I guided them toward. And despite my tricky methods of constraining their choices, 
they retained a feeling of freedom and perhaps felt an enhanced feeling of freedom, 
since their choices were clearer than when I didn’t guide them at all.
This method of indirect control by constraint is used in games all the time. 
If a game puts a player in an empty room with two doors, the player will almost 
certainly go through one of them. Which one, we don’t necessarily know, but they 
will surely go through one, since a door is a message that says “open me” and 
players are naturally curious. After all, there is nowhere else to go. If you ask the 
player if they had choices, they would say they did, for even two options is a choice. 
Compare this to putting a player in an open field, out on a city street, or in a shop­
ping mall. In those cases, where they go and what they do is far more open ended 
and difficult to predict—unless you use other methods of indirect control.
Indirect Control Method #2: Goals
The most common and straightforward use of indirect control in game design is 
through goals. If a player has two doors they can go through, I don’t really know 
which one they are going to enter. But if I give them a goal of “go find all the 
bananas,” and one of the doors clearly has bananas behind it, I can make a pretty 
good guess about where they are going to go.
Earlier, we talked about the importance of establishing good goals to give players 
a reason to care about your game. Once clear and achievable goals have been estab­
lished, though, you can take advantage of that fact by sculpting your world around 
the goals, since your players will only go places and do things that they think will 
help fulfill the goals. If your driving game is about racing through a city to get to 
a finish line, you don’t have to build a complete street map, because if you clearly 
mark the fastest route, people will mostly stick to that. You might add a small num­
ber of side streets (especially if some are shortcuts!) to give a feeling of freedom, but 
the goal you have selected will indirectly control players to avoid exploring every 
little side street. Creating content that players will never see does not give them 
more freedom—it just wastes development resources that could be used to improve 
the places that the players will see.
One fascinating real-world example of this can be seen in the men’s restrooms 
of Amsterdam’s Schiphol Airport. Users of the urinals in these restrooms quickly 
notice that they contain a fly. This is not an actual fly; rather, it is just an etching in 
the surface of the porcelain. Why? The designers were trying to solve the problem of 
“sloppy marksmanship,” which results in the need for more janitorial service. The 
etched fly creates an implicit goal—hit the fly. By placing the fly in the center of the 
urinal (and slightly to one side to soften the angle of incidence), the bathrooms stay 
cleaner. The “players” have not had their freedom diminished in the least, but are 
indirectly controlled toward the behavior that the designers find optimal.

Indirect Control Method #3: Interface
We’ve already talked about feedback, transparency, juiciness, and important 
aspects of a good interface. But there is something else to consider about your inter­
face: indirect control. Because players want interfaces to be transparent, they don’t 
really think about the interface, if they can help it. In other words, they set up their 
expectations about what they can and cannot do in a game based on the interface. If 
your “rock star” game has a plastic guitar as the physical interface, your players are 
probably going to expect to play the guitar, and it probably will not occur to them 
that they might want to do something else. If you give them a gamepad instead, 
they might wonder if they can play different instruments and do stage dives, or any 
number of other things a rock star might do. But that plastic guitar secretly steals 
away those options—silently limiting the players to a single activity. When we built 
our virtual pirates attraction with a wooden ship’s wheel and thirty-pound spun-
aluminum cannons, no guest ever asked whether they could sword fight as part of 
the game—that option never entered their minds.
And it isn’t just the physical interface that has this power—the virtual interface 
has it, too. Even the avatar you control, which is part of the virtual interface, exerts 
indirect control over the player. If the player controls Lara Croft, they will try to do 
certain things. If they control a dragonfly, an elephant, or a Sherman tank, they will 
try to do very different things. The choice of avatar is partly about who a player will 
relate to, but it is also about implicitly limiting the player’s options.
Indirect Control Method #4: Visual Design
We are led to believe a lie
when we see with, not through, the eye.
—William Blake
Anyone who works in an area of the visual arts knows that layout affects where 
the guest will look. This becomes very important in an interactive experience, since 
guests tend to go to what draws their attention. Therefore, if you can control where 
someone is going to look, you can control where they are going to go. Figure 18.3 
shows a simple example.
It is difficult, looking at this picture, for your eyes not to be led to the center of 
the page. A guest looking at this scene in an interactive experience would be very 
likely to examine the central triangle before considering what might be at the edges 
of the frame. This is in sharp contrast to Figure 18.4.
Here, the guest’s eyes are compelled to explore the edges of the frame and 
beyond. If this scene were part of an interactive experience, it would be a good 
bet that the guest would be trying to find out more about the objects on the edges, 
rather than the circle in the middle of the scene. Most likely, they would try to push 
past the borders of the screen, if they could.

323
Indirect Control Method #4: Visual Design
These examples are abstract, but there are plenty of real-world examples 
that illustrate the same thing. The designers of quilts, for example, think a 
great deal about how to draw the eye. It is often said that a good quilt design 
makes the eye flit continuously around the quilt, never letting it come to rest 
on a single image.

CHAPTER Eighteen • STORY AND GAME STRUCTURES CAN BE ARTFULLY MERGED WITH INDIRECT CONTROL
Set designers, illustrators, architects, and cinematographers use these principles 
to guide the eye of their guests and indirectly control their focus. One excellent 
example is the castle at the center of Disneyland. Walt Disney knew that there was 
some risk of guests entering the park and milling about at the entrance, unsure of 
where to go. The castle is placed such that the guests’ eyes are immediately drawn 
to it upon entering the park (similar to the first figure), and their feet are quick to 
follow. Soon the guests are at the Disneyland hub, with several visual landmarks 
beckoning them in different directions (similar to the second figure). Indirectly, Walt 
was able to control guests to do just what he wanted them to do: Move quickly to the 
center of Disneyland, and then branch out randomly to other parts of the park. Of 
course, the guests are seldom aware of this manipulation. After all, no one told them 
where to go. All the guests know is that without much thinking, and with total free­
dom, they ended up somewhere interesting and had a fun entertainment experience.
Walt even had a name for this kind of manipulation. He called it a visual 
“weenie,” a reference to the way dogs are sometimes controlled on a movie set: A 
trainer holds a hot dog or piece of meat in the air, and moves it around to control 
where the dog will look, since nothing draws the attention of a dog better than food.
One of the keys to good level design is that the player’s eyes pull them through 
the level, effortlessly. It makes the player feel in control and immersed in the world. 
Understanding what pulls the eye of the player can give you tremendous power 
over the choices players want to make. When the Disney VR Studio worked on the 
Mark 2 version of Aladdin’s Magic Carpet Ride: VR Adventure, we faced a significant 
conundrum. One very important scene was the palace throne room, shown here:
F I G U R E

325
Indirect Control Method #4: Visual Design
The animation director wanted players to fly into this room, then fly up to that 
little throne at the base of the elephant statue, and sit for a moment and listen to a 
message from the Sultan before they continued their gameplay. We had hoped that 
the little Sultan, dressed in white hopping up and down on that throne, would be 
enough to draw people over to listen to him—but that didn’t happen. These players 
were on flying carpets! They wanted to fly all around, up to the ceiling, around the 
pillars, anywhere they could. Their implicit goal was to fly and have fun—visiting 
the Sultan didn’t fit in with that plan. Seeing no other choice, we were all set to 
implement a system that seized control from the players, dragging them across the 
room to the Sultan and gluing them to the spot while he talked. No one liked this 
idea, since we all knew it meant robbing the players of their precious feeling of 
freedom.
But then the art director had an idea.
He painted a single red line on the floor, like this:
His thinking was that maybe guests would follow the red line. We were all 
somewhat skeptical, but it was an easy thing for us to prototype. And to our 
stunned amazement, guests did exactly that! Upon entering the room, instead of 
flying every which way like we had seen before, they followed the red line like 
it was some kind of tractor beam, right up to the Sultan’s throne. And when he 
started talking (by that time guests were right up close to him), they waited to hear 
what he had to say! It didn’t work every single time, but it did work over 90% of

326
CHAPTER Eighteen • STORY AND GAME STRUCTURES CAN BE ARTFULLY MERGED WITH INDIRECT CONTROL
the time, which was perfectly adequate for this experience. The most startling part 
was in the interviews afterwards—upon asking players why they followed the red 
line in the throne room, they would say “What red line?” It didn’t register in their 
conscious memory at all.
At first this didn’t make sense to me: How could a simple red line wipe the idea 
of flying around the room out of the minds of the players? But then I realized—it 
was seeing the columns and the chandeliers that put the idea of flying around into 
their minds. The red line was so visually dominant in the scene that it stopped them 
from noticing these other things, and so the idea to do these other things didn’t even 
occur to them.
Curiously, we faced a new version of this problem in the Mark 3 version of the 
game. In this version, which was for four simultaneous players, we didn’t want 
them all to go to the Sultan. We wanted them to split up and go to different places—
we wanted some players to visit the Sultan and others to fly through doors on the 
left and right sides of the room. But the tyrannical red line was making all four play­
ers fly up to the Sultan. Again we started discussing how we probably had to force 
the players to split up—but then we had a different thought—could we change the 
red line to make that happen? We tried this:

327
Indirect Control Method #5: Characters
And it worked beautifully. In most cases, two players would visit the throne, one 
player would branch left following the line to the left door, and one player would 
branch right, following the line to the right door.
Indirect Control Method #5: Characters
One very straightforward method of indirectly controlling the player is through 
computer-controlled characters in the game. If you can use your storytelling ability 
to make the player actually care about the characters—that is, willingly wanting to 
obey them, protect them, help them, or destroy them—you suddenly have an excel­
lent tool to control what the player will and will not try to do.
This was used to great effect in an early interactive movie: Mr. Sardonicus, 
directed by William Castle in 1961, featured an unusual gimmick. The narrator 
explains that how the film ends is up to the audience—should the villain suffer 
punishment, or be forgiven? Each audience member was given a “thumbs-up/
thumbs-down” card to hold up, so the projectionist could load the appropriate film 
reel. Castle had significant confidence that audiences would choose the “punish­
ment” reel. He was so confident, in fact, that he never bothered to film the “for­
giveness” reel, and no audience ever noticed.
In the game Animal Crossing, a mysterious council called the Happy Room 
Academy (HRA) periodically evaluates how well you have decorated the interior 
of your house and awards you points based on how well you have done. Players 
work very hard to get these points—partly because it is a goal of the game, but I 
think also partly because it feels embarrassing to think that someone is looking at 
the inside of your house and shaking their head in disgust, even if they are only 
imaginary.
In the game Ico, your goal is to protect a princess who travels with you. The 
designers have a very clever timer mechanism in the game—evil spirits appear 
if you stay still too long, grab the princess, and try to drag her into a hole in the 
ground. Even though they can’t hurt her unless they succeed in carrying her away, 
and it takes some time for them to actually pull her into the hole, I found myself 
snapping into action the moment they appeared, for the very idea of them touching 
her made me feel like I was letting her down.
Characters can be a great way to manipulate the choices the player is trying to 
make or how they feel about those choices. But first, you have to make the player 
care about how those imaginary characters feel, for once you have done that, it is 
easy to inspire action in the player, for one marvelous aspect of human nature is 
a deep desire to help those we empathize with. It is a point of view so useful we 
should add it to our toolbox.

328
CHAPTER Eighteen • STORY AND GAME STRUCTURES CAN BE ARTFULLY MERGED WITH INDIRECT CONTROL
Indirect Control Method #6: Music
When most designers think of adding music to a game, they usually think of the 
mood they want to create and the atmosphere of the game. But music can also have 
a significant effect on what players do.
Restaurants use this method all the time. Fast music makes people eat faster, 
so during a lunch rush, many restaurants play high-energy dance music, because 
faster eating means more profits. And of course, during a slow period, like three 
in the afternoon, they do the opposite. An empty restaurant often is a sign of a bad 
restaurant, so to make diners linger, they play slow music, which slows down the 
eating and makes customers consider ordering an extra cup of coffee or a dessert. 
Of course, the patrons don’t realize this is happening—they think they have total 
freedom over their actions.
If it works for restaurant managers, it can work for you. Think about what kind 
of music you should play to make players:
●
●
Look around for something hidden.
●
●
Destroy everything possible without slowing down.
●
●
Realize they are heading the wrong way.
●
●
Move slowly and carefully.
●
●
Worry about accidentally hurting innocent bystanders.
●
●
Go as far and as fast as possible without looking back.
Music is the language of the soul, and as such, it speaks to players on a deep 
level—a level so deep that it can change their moods, desires, and actions—and 
they don’t even realize it is happening.
These six methods of indirect control can be very powerful ways to balance 
freedom and good storytelling. That it is possible your design is exerting control on 
players in ways you never intended is a note of caution, though. I took a friend to 
Lens #80: The Lens of Help
Deep down, everyone wants to be helpful. To channel this helpful spirit toward 
engaging gameplay, ask yourself these questions:
●
●
Within the context of the game, who is the player helping?
●
●
Can I make the player feel more connected to the characters who need help?
●
●
Can I better tell the story of how meeting game goals helps someone?
●
●
How can the helped characters show their appreciation?

Walt Disney World’s scary Alien Encounter experience back in the 1990s (it has since 
been made less frightening and more family friendly). It consisted of indoor circular 
amphitheater with strange chairs that could create the illusion that a vicious alien 
monster was loose in the dark theater, brushing against you and breathing down 
your neck. It was so unique and exciting, I felt sure my friend would enjoy it, but 
when it was over, he seemed nonplussed. I asked what he thought, and he said, “It 
was okay. But when I saw how it was laid out in a circle, and they strapped us into 
the chairs, I was sure the theater would spin. But we just sat there. I mean, it was 
okay, just not what I expected.”
To make sure your experience has the right kind of indirect control, use this lens.

While designing Pirates of the Caribbean: Battle for the Buccaneer Gold, we faced a 
significant challenge. We had to create a very powerful interactive experience that 
would only last five minutes. The interest curve had to be excellent, since a family of 
four could be paying as much as $20 just to play this game one time. But at the same 
time, we knew this couldn’t just be a linear experience, because the very essence 
of being a pirate involved a feeling of tremendous freedom. Based on our previous 
experiences, we knew that this was a great opportunity for some indirect control.
Lens #81: The Lens of Indirect Control
Every designer has a vision of what they would like the players to do to have 
an ideal play experience. To help ensure the players do these things of their 
own free will, ask yourself these questions:
●
●
Ideally, what would I like the players to do?
●
●
Can constraints get players to do it?
●
●
Can goals get players to do it?

Can interface get players to do it?

Is there some other method I can use to coerce players toward ideal behav­
ior without impinging on their feeling of freedom?

●
Is my design inducing desires I’d rather the player not have?

CHAPTER Eighteen • STORY AND GAME STRUCTURES CAN BE ARTFULLY MERGED WITH INDIRECT CONTROL
Our early prototypes of the game made one thing clear: If we just set people 
out on the ocean to battle enemies, they had great fun for about two minutes and 
twenty seconds. Then their zeal would wane, and they would sometimes ask, “So… 
is this all we do?” Clearly, this was an unacceptable interest curve. Players wanted 
more buildup. We thought a way to achieve this would be with some more inter­
esting scenarios. We thought that by putting these scenarios near islands that the 
players could approach, it would be a great way to guide them to where interesting 
things were happening—kind of like the castle guides people in Disneyland. So, we 
drew up an initial map:
Players would start in the center, where we expected they would fight some 
enemies, and then they would hopefully sail for one of the islands, each designed 
to be interesting and visible from a distance. Which island they went to was up to 
them—they had freedom to choose, for each island had different types of encoun­
ters. At one, evil pirates were besieging a burning town. At another, a surprising 
mining operation was taking place on the side of a volcano. At a third, the royal 
navy was transporting huge quantities of gold and guarding their stronghold with 
catapults that launched fireballs. We were sure that these big islands would draw a 
lot of player interest.
Boy, were we wrong. Taking a look at Figure 18.9, you can see the problem.

331
Collusion
The players have been told that their goal is to sink the pirate ships. Here they 
are surrounded by large, threatening pirate ships with bright white sails. Look at 
that poor volcano in the distance. It is hardly noticeable and has nothing to do with 
the player goals!
We saw right away that this wasn’t working. And we started considering the 
possibility of putting the pirate ship on a fixed path that guided them to the islands. 
But then we had a funny idea. What if the enemy pirate ships didn’t act in their 
own best interest? Up until now, we had been spending a lot of time writing fancy 
algorithms to make the enemy ships attack with interesting and intelligent strate­
gies. Our new idea was to scrap all that and change the logic of the ships. With the 
new system, at the start of the game, when the players encounter ships on the open 
ocean, the ships would attack the players, but then they would start to flee. The 
players, fixed on their goal of destroying enemy ships, would pursue them. We then 
tried to time things so that right about when the players destroyed the enemy ships, 
the ships had arrived at one of the islands (chosen randomly). With the ships sunk, 
the players would look up to find themselves at an interesting island scenario. They 
would do battle there, only to be attacked by new ships that again fled—to where? 
To whatever island the players had not visited yet.
This strategy worked magnificently. With a feeling of total freedom, the players 
would have a very structured experience: they would start with an exciting battle, 
followed by a mini-scenario, followed by a new naval battle, followed by another 
new mini-scenario. We knew we had to have a big finish, but we couldn’t be sure 
where the players would be. So a little bit after the fourth minute, the big finish 
came to them, in the form of a sudden fog and an attack by ghost pirates who 
engaged the players in an epic final battle.

CHAPTER Eighteen • STORY AND GAME STRUCTURES CAN BE ARTFULLY MERGED WITH INDIRECT CONTROL
The whole thing was only possible because we did something very unusual—we 
made the characters in the game have two simultaneous goals. On one hand, their 
goal is to engage the players in a challenging battle. On the other hand, their goal is 
to lead the players to interesting places to keep the flow of the experience optimal. 
I call this principle collusion, since the game characters are colluding with the 
designer to make an experience that will be optimal for the players. It is an interest­
ing form of indirect control that joins methods of using goals, characters, and visual 
design for a single unified effect.
There is some evidence that this kind of indirect control via collusion may be cen­
tral to the future of interactive storytelling. The fascinating Façade experience, cre­
ated by Andrew Stern and Michael Mateas, takes this idea to a new level. In Façade, 
you play the role of a guest at a dinner party, hosted by Grace and Trip, a married 
couple. Your interface is one that mainly consists of speaking through typed text, 
which offers tremendous freedom and flexibility. As you play, you quickly notice 
that you are the only guest at the party, and weirdly, it is their anniversary. The 
situation is very uncomfortable because of their constant bickering, each trying to 
get you to take sides in their arguments. It is a very unusual game experience with 
goals that are more like those in a novel or television show than in a videogame.
Something else is unusual, too. The game seems to play quite differently on dif­
ferent sessions—each time you play, you hear perhaps 10% of the dialog that was 
recorded. This is not a string of pearls structure, or even a branching structure. This 
is a simulation where Grace and Trip are artificially intelligent characters who have 
goals they are trying to achieve. This is done through fairly standard AI models of 
goals related to behaviors that are triggered by sensors (Figure 18.11).
However, like our tricky pirate ships, Grace and Trip are not just trying to satisfy 
their own goals. They also are very aware that they are part of a story and, as such, 
should be trying to make it interesting. As they make their choices about what to say 
and do, part of their decision concerns whether what they are saying is of the proper 
F I G U R E

Collusion
tension for this part of the story, and the designers encoded a timeline of what they 
thought was an appropriate tension over time for the experience (Figure 18.12).
Does that graph look familiar? By having Grace and Trip make decisions that 
follow this tension graph, while simultaneously trying to fulfill the goals they have 
as characters in the story, their behavior makes sense while keeping the player 
interested in the sequence of events.
It would seem that we have only scratched the surface of the type of experiences 
that might be possible through the clever use of collusion. If you’d like to consider 
how you might use it in your game, use this lens.

CHAPTER Nineteen • STORIES AND GAMES TAKE PLACE IN WORLDS
Transmedia Worlds
In May of 1977, the film Star Wars premiered. It was a surprise hit with young 
and old alike, but especially with the young. Children were going to see it again 
and again. It took nearly a year for Kenner Toys to produce a line of action figures 
based on the movie characters, but even a year after the film’s release, the toys 
were a tremendous success, selling as fast as they could be produced and continu­
ing to sell well for years. Other Star Wars merchandise was produced—posters, 
jigsaw puzzles, sleeping bags, paper plates, and just about everything else you can 
­imagine—but nothing was as popular as the action figures.
Some people believe that selling this kind of merchandise is just a way to cash 
in on hype and that, ultimately, it cheapens a film. I mean, these toys look kind of 
cheesy compared to what you see in the movie.
So, why did they sell so many action figures? For some people, they were just 
a cool decoration—something they could look at and remember the film. But for 
most children, they were something else—they were a gateway into the Star Wars 
universe.
For if you observed children playing with them, you would notice something 
very strange. Seldom would they act out scenes from the movie, as an adult might 
expect. Instead, they would make up all kinds of stories featuring these characters 
with only a loose relationship to the plotline from the movie, which was fairly 
complex and somewhat difficult for a child to fully comprehend. This might lead 
you to conclude that it was the characters that were so popular, not the story from 
Star Wars. But often, you would see children give these characters completely dif­
ferent names, and completely different relationships than they had in the film, as 
they enacted dramas and comedies starring this cast of characters in bedrooms and 
backyards everywhere in the world.
So, if it wasn’t the plotline or the characters that the kids were so excited by, 
then what was left? The answer is that it was the world of Star Wars that was so 
F I G U R E
19.2

337
The Power of Pokemon
compelling—and the toys provided another gateway into that world—one that was 
better than the movie, in some ways, since it was interactive, participatory, flex­
ible, portable, and social. And weirdly, these toys made the Star Wars world more 
meaningful for children, not less, because the toys afforded them the ability to visit 
the world, sculpt it, change it, and make it their own. And as Star Wars sequels 
started to appear, there was great anticipation, but how much of that anticipation 
was a desire to hear a new story and how much of it was the excitement of reenter­
ing that world?
Henry Jenkins coined the term transmedia worlds to refer to fantasy worlds that 
can be entered through many different media—print, video, animation, toys, games, 
and many others. This is a very useful concept, for it really is as if the world exists 
apart from the media that support it. Many people find this a bizarre concept—they 
think of books, films, games, and toys as separate things, each standing on their 
own. But more and more often, the real product that is created is not a story, or a toy, 
or a game, but a world. But you can’t sell a world, so these various products are sold 
as gateways into this world, each leading to different parts of it. And if the world is 
well constructed, the more gateways you visit, the more real and solid the world will 
become in your imagination. But if these gateways contradict each other or provide 
inconsistent information, the world crumbles quickly into dust and ashes, and sud­
denly the products are worth nothing.
Why is this? Why do worlds become so real for us, more real than the media that 
define them? It is because we want them to be real. Some part of us wants to believe 
that these worlds aren’t just stories in books, sets of rules, or actors on a screen, but 
that these worlds actually exist and that maybe, somehow, someday, we can find 
our way to them.
This is why people so casually throw out magazines but hesitate before throwing 
out a comic book—after all, there’s a world in there.
The Power of Pokemon
Pokemon is arguably one of the most successful transmedia worlds of all time. 
Since its introduction, the combined sales of all Pokemon products combined is 
over $24 billion, making it the second most lucrative videogame franchise of all 
time, second only to Mario. And though many tried to write it off as a short-term 
fad, over fifteen years later, new Pokemon games are consistently top sellers. It is 
worth understanding the history of Pokemon to better understand the power of its 
transmedia world.
Pokemon began as a game for the Nintendo Game Boy system. Its designer, 
Tajiri Satoshi, had collected insects as a boy, and seeing the “game link” feature 
that allowed message passing between two Game Boys in 1991, he had a vision 
of insects traveling along the cable. He approached Nintendo about the idea, and 
then he and his team spent five years developing and perfecting the title. In 1996, 
“Pocket Monsters” (the direct translation of the Japanese title) as a pair of games 

338
CHAPTER Nineteen • STORIES AND GAMES TAKE PLACE IN WORLDS
(red and green) was launched. It was essentially a traditional RPG (not unlike 
Ultima or Final Fantasy), except that you could capture the monsters you fought 
and make them part of your team.
The graphics and game action were not elaborate or advanced—but the inter­
actions were rich and interesting, since the team had spent five years to properly 
balance the game. It is important to realize how primitive the graphics really were. 
The original Game Boy only allowed four shades of olive for the graphics, and two 
battling Pokemon would basically stand next to each other and wiggle as the player 
chose attacks from a simple menu.
The game was a huge success—so much so that a comic book and an anime 
series were soon planned. Unlike many TV shows that are only loosely connected to 
the videogame they were based on (e.g., the dreadful Hanna Barbera Pac-Man car­
toon), the Pokemon show reflected the intricate rules of the gameplay very closely, 
and the adventures of the main character were directly based on the quest path 
through the Game Boy game. The result was a show that so mirrored the mechan­
ics of the game, that watching it players better understood what strategies to use in 
the game.
But most importantly, the TV show gave gameplayers a new gateway into the 
Pokemon universe—one that showed the Pokemon in full color with dramatic ani­
mation and sound. When viewers would return to the Game Boy, these vivid images 
were retained in their imaginations, making the crudeness of Game Boy graphics 
and sound completely irrelevant. As mentioned in Chapter 13, “Balance,” this is 
sometimes called the “binocular effect,” so named because it is like when people 
take binoculars to a sporting event or opera glasses to the theater. No one watches 
the whole event through the binoculars. Instead, the binoculars are used early on to 
give a close-up view of the distant figures. Once someone has seen them close up, 
they can map that image onto the tiny figures they see on the stage in their visual 
imagination.
These two gateways had tremendous synergy—wanting to succeed at the game 
gave reasons to watch the TV show, and watching the TV show made playing the 
game more vivid and exciting.
And if this wasn’t enough, in 1999, Nintendo worked with Wizards of the Coast, 
the company that produced the breakthrough Magic: The Gathering collectible card 
game, to create a new collectible card game, based on the world of Pokemon. This 
game, like the TV show, held as closely as possible to the core mechanics of the 
Game Boy game. This gave players a third method of entry into this world—one 
that was both portable and very social. Although the Game Boy game featured the 
game link cable for trading Pokemon, the truth was that players only used it occa­
sionally—most of the time, it was played as a solo adventure. Not so with the card 
game—its low price and accessibility made it very popular with children (especially 
boys), playing off their interest in competing with their peers and fitting in naturally 
with the Pokemon slogan of “Gotta catch’em all!”
These three complementary gateways into a single solid world made the prop­
erty a near unstoppable force. People who didn’t understand the Pokemon universe 

339
Properties of Transmedia Worlds
were completely bewildered: Is this thing a game, or a TV show, or what? What is it 
about the storyline that is so great that kids want to spend all this money on it? I was 
fortunate enough to be at a roundtable discussion in 1999 with the head of a major 
entertainment company. Someone asked him what he thought of “this Pokemon 
craze,” and he replied, “The movie comes out in a few months, and that’ll be the 
end of it.” He was wrong, of course, because he fundamentally did not get the idea 
of transmedia worlds. He was completely mired in the old Hollywood way of think­
ing about story worlds—a big Hollywood movie defines the world, then there are 
toys, games, and TV shows that mimic that. The idea of a world that could be based 
in the ruleset of a handheld videogame or a world that could get stronger with each 
new medium you add to it was completely unfamiliar to him (he is not in charge of 
that company any longer).
The strength of Pokemon is not just in the game concept, but in the careful and 
consistent use of multiple media as gateways into a single, well-defined world.
Properties of Transmedia Worlds
Transmedia worlds have several properties that make them interesting.
Transmedia Worlds Are Powerful
Successful transmedia worlds exert a powerful effect over fans. It is stronger than 
just a fan’s love of an interesting story. It is almost as if the world becomes a sort 
of personal utopia that they fantasize about visiting. Sometimes, these fantasies 
are short term, but for many, they are long term, lasting on through their lives. For 
some, these long-term fantasies are something they turn to, now and then, for a 
sort of mental break. An adult who keeps a Transformer toy around as a decoration 
might be a good example of this. The toy gives him a convenient mental gateway to 
the world of Transformers that he can visit occasionally.
But for others, the passion for this personal utopia becomes something they 
actively engage in every day. Such was certainly the case with Scott Edward Nall, 
who on his 30th birthday legally changed his name to Optimus Prime, one of the 
lead robots in the Transformers Universe. In fact, if you look at “hardcore fans” 
of any kind of fiction, you will find that in almost all cases, the properties with 
the most devoted fans are the ones that are the strongest transmedia worlds. Star 
Trek, Star Wars, Transformers, Lord of the Rings, Marvel Comics, Harry Potter, and 
many other properties that get hardcore fans have a world at their core. More than 
the enjoyment of a good storyline, or the appreciation of interesting characters, 
the desire to enter a fantasy world seems to be what propels these fans to such 
extremes. Fantasy is an important concept in games that some argue it is more 
important than story. To be sure you remember to capture the epic power of fan­
tasy, take this lens.

CHAPTER Nineteen • STORIES AND GAMES TAKE PLACE IN WORLDS
Transmedia Worlds Are Long Lived
Solid transmedia worlds continue for a surprisingly long time. Superman appeared 
over seventy-five years ago. James Bond has been around for sixty years. Star Trek 
and Doctor Who still thrive after fifty years. Walt Disney realized the power of 
transmedia as he started developing comic books to help keep the worlds of his 
animation properties alive and created Disneyland to this same end. One of his 
strongest arguments for investing in such an unusual venture was that it would 
help keep up the public’s interest in Disney films by giving them another gateway 
into the world of the films. The Copyright Term Extension Act of 1998 extended the 
length of corporate copyrights from 75 to 95 years. This was greatly spurred by the 
fact that some still lucrative properties (such as early Mickey Mouse cartoons) were 
in danger of falling into the public domain. Right or wrong, some have suggested 
that one of the reasons that this act passed seems to be that it just feels wrong to let 
a carefully managed, well-beloved world fall into the wrong hands.
One very good reason to cultivate a strong transmedia world is that if you do it 
well, it can be profitable for a very long time. This seems particularly true for worlds 
that appeal to children—when the children grow into adulthood, they often want to 
share the worlds with their children, creating a cycle that can go on a very long time.
Transmedia Worlds Evolve over Time
But these worlds do not remain static over time—they evolve. Consider a trans­
media world over a hundred years old (and still popular!): the world of Sherlock 
Holmes. When we think of Sherlock Holmes today, we typically think of him in his 
trademark deerstalker cap and oversized calabash pipe. But if you read the text of 
the Sherlock Holmes stories, these items are not mentioned in the text. Nor do they 
appear in the artwork of Sidney Paget, who did all of the original illustrations for 
the stories. So where did they come from? Both pipe and cap seem to have been 
made popular by William Gillette, an actor who portrayed Holmes in a series of 
plays based on the stories. He chose the unusual hat and the oversized pipe because 
Lens #83: The Lens of Fantasy
Everyone has secret wishes and desires. To be sure your world fulfills them, 
ask yourself these questions:
●
●
What fantasy does my world fulfill?
●
●
Who does the player fantasize about being?
●
●
What does my player fantasize about doing there?

341
What Successful Transmedia Worlds Have in Common
they would be distinct and visible even from the back row of a theater. The plays 
were immensely popular, so much so that future illustrators of the Holmes sto­
ries used photos of Gillette as a model for their illustrations. Weirdly, the pipe and 
cap have become the icons for Sherlock Holmes—icons that his creator, Sir Arthur 
Conan Doyle, never envisioned. But this is the way of transmedia worlds—as new 
media provide new gateways to the world, the world itself (or people’s perception 
of it, which amounts to the same thing for an imaginary world) changes to accom­
modate the new gateways.
Another excellent example of this comes from an even older and more beloved 
transmedia world—the world of Santa Claus. If ever there was a fantasy utopia 
that people truly want to be real, it is Santa’s world—a world where once a year 
a benevolent figure carefully considers your heart’s desire, and gives it to you if 
you are worthy. Consider the many paths of entry to this world: Not only are there 
stories, poems, songs, and movies, but you can write him letters, and even visit 
Santa himself! Just think of it—a fictional character comes to your house and eats 
your cookies and then leaves behind a treasure trove of gifts! We so badly want this 
world to exist that millions of people go to tremendous expense and feats of decep­
tion to make children believe it to be an unquestionable reality.
But who is the author of this world? Like all long-lived transmedia worlds, it 
was a great collaborative effort. Storytellers and artists continually try to augment 
Santa’s world. Some succeed, like the introduction of Santa’s reindeer by Clement 
Moore in 1823, or the introduction of Rudolph by Robert L. May in 1939. Many oth­
ers fail. No less a storyteller than L. Frank Baum, the author of the Wizard of Oz 
stories, failed miserably with his 1902 Life and Adventures of Santa Claus, which 
attempted to establish Santa’s origin as a mortal selected for immortality by a coun­
cil of nymphs, gnomes, and demons.
Who decides which new features enter a transmedia world, and which ones 
are rejected? It somehow happens as part of our collective consciousness. Through 
some unspoken democratic process, everyone just decides whether a particular fea­
ture seems appropriate or inappropriate, and the fictional world changes slightly 
to accommodate. There is no formal decision—it just happens. If a story feature is 
well-liked, it takes root. If not, it fades away. In the long run, the world is governed 
by those who visit it.
What Successful Transmedia Worlds Have in Common
Successful transmedia worlds are powerful and valuable—so what do they have in 
common?
●
●
They tend to be rooted in a single medium: For all of their many gateways, the 
most successful of the transmedia worlds started out by making a huge splash in 
just one medium. Sherlock Holmes was serialized fiction. Superman was a comic 
book. Star Wars was a movie. Star Trek was a TV show. Pokemon was a handheld 

342
CHAPTER Nineteen • STORIES AND GAMES TAKE PLACE IN WORLDS
game. Transformers was a toy. All of these have appeared in many other forms, 
but each is at its very strongest when in its original medium.
●
●
They are intuitive: When doing research for Toontown Online, I tried to learn 
as much as I could about the fictional world of Toontown. As I studied the 
film Who Framed Roger Rabbit, I realized that very little about Toontown was 
really described there. The film didn’t need to describe Toontown in great detail 
because everyone already knew it existed. Without anyone ever expressly saying 
it, it was somehow common knowledge that all cartoon characters live together 
in a cartoon universe that is very different than ours. The creators of Superman 
and Batman surely never had any intention that their characters shared the 
world with other superheroes, but it was intuitive to comic readers that these 
characters lived in the same world—and so now they do.
●
●
They have a creative individual at their core: The majority of successful trans­
media worlds are rooted in the imagination and aesthetic styling of a single indi­
vidual. People like Walt Disney, Shigeru Miyamoto, L. Frank Baum, Tajiri Satoshi, 
Jim Henson, J.K. Rowling, and George Lucas are all examples. Occasionally, 
small, tight teams are able to create successful transmedia worlds, but it is very 
rare indeed for successful worlds to be created by large teams. There is some­
thing about the holistic vision of a world that comes to a single individual that 
gives it the strength, solidity, integrity, and beauty necessary to survive the pres­
sure of many gateways.
●
●
They facilitate the telling of many stories: Successful transmedia worlds are 
never based around a single plotline. They have a solidity and an interconnect­
edness that goes far beyond that. They leave room for future stories and for 
guests to imagine their own stories.
●
●
They make sense through any of their gateways: One kiss of death for almost 
any movie is the phrase “It makes more sense if you read the book.” You never 
know which gateway guests might enter first, so you must make all of them 
equally inviting and welcoming. Pokemon certainly succeeded in this regard—
its TV show, comic, video, and card games were each understandable and enjoy­
able in their own right. Any of these could be a first encounter with the world of 
Pokemon that might lead to other ports of entry later on.
A counterexample would be some of the things that were attempted with the 
world of the Matrix. Enter the Matrix, a critically panned videogame based on the 
second film, Matrix: Reloaded, took the novel approach of not telling the story of 
the movie, but rather a parallel story that intersected with the movie. This was 
an interesting idea, but if you didn’t see the movie, it was confusing. Similarly, 
Animatrix, a series of animated shorts that happen in the Matrix universe only 
make sense if the viewer is already intimate with the Matrix universe. This “it 
only makes sense if you enter through all the gateways” approach was intriguing 
for a few, but alienating for most.

343
What Successful Transmedia Worlds Have in Common
●
●
They are often about discovery: This makes sense because a world about dis­
covery encourages visits from many gateways.
●
●
They are about wish fulfillment: Imagining a fantasy world is a lot of work. 
Players will not do it unless it is a world that they truly would like to visit—a 
world that fulfills some deep and important wish.
Transmedia worlds are the future of entertainment. It is no longer sufficient to focus 
just on creating a great experience in a single medium. Increasingly, designers are 
asked to create new gateways to existing worlds—not an easy task. But those who 
can create gateways that excite players by creatively giving them a new perspective 
on and enjoyment of a known world are much sought after. But even more sought 
after are those who can invent a successful transmedia world starting with noth­
ing but an understanding of their audience’s secret wishes. If you want to create or 
improve transmedia worlds, use this lens.
Strong transmedia worlds are not just empty places. A huge part of what makes 
them interesting is who lives there. It is this we turn our attention to now.
Lens #84: The Lens of the World
The world of your game is a thing that exists apart. Your game is a doorway to 
this magic place that exists only in the imagination of your players. To ensure 
your world has power and integrity, ask yourself these questions:
●
●
How is my world better than the real world?
●
●
Can there be multiple gateways to my world? How do they differ? How do 
they support each other?
●
●
Is my world centered on a single story, or could many stories happen here?

CHAPTER Twenty • WORLDS CONTAIN CHARACTERS
The Nature of Game Characters
If we are to create games that have great stories in them, these stories must contain 
memorable characters. It is an important question to ask: How are characters in 
games different than characters in other media? If we examine fictional characters 
in various media side by side, some differences become apparent. Here are some 
samples I chose from lists of the best novels, films, and videogames of the twentieth 
century.
Novel Characters
Holden Caulfield: The Catcher in the Rye. Holden is a teenager who wrestles with 
the phoniness and ugliness of the adult world.
Humbert Humbert: Lolita. Humbert is an adult consumed by lust for an adoles­
cent girl.
Tom Joad: The Grapes of Wrath. Tom is an ex-convict who tries to help his family 
after they lose their farm.
Ralph: Lord of the Flies. Ralph and many other children are stranded on an island 
and try to survive the island and each other.
Sethe: Beloved. Sethe is a woman who tries to rebuild her life after she and her 
daughter escape from slavery.
Movie Characters
Rick Blaine: Casablanca. Rick must choose between the love of his life and saving 
the life of her husband.
Indiana Jones: Raiders of the Lost Ark. An adventurous archaeologist must rescue 
the Ark of the Covenant from the Nazis.
Rose DeWitt Bukater: Titanic. A young woman falls in love on the ill-fated Titanic.
Norman Bates: Psycho. A man with an unusual case of schizophrenia commits 
murders and tries to cover them up.
Don Lockwood: Singin’ in the Rain. A silent film actor struggles to make the transi­
tion to talkies.
Game Characters
Mario: Super Mario Brothers. A cartoon plumber battles enemies to rescue a prin­
cess from an evil king.

347
The Nature of Game Characters
Solid Snake: Metal Gear Solid. A retired soldier infiltrates a nuclear weapons dis­
posal facility to neutralize a terrorist threat.
Cloud Strife: Final Fantasy VII. A band of rebels tries to defeat an evil megacorpora­
tion run by an evil wizard.
Link: Legend of Zelda. A young man must recover a magic artifact to rescue a prin­
cess from a villain.
Gordon Freeman: Half-Life 2. A physicist must battle aliens when an experiment 
goes horribly wrong.
So, examining these lists, what patterns do we see?
●
●
Mental → physical: The characters in the novels are involved in deep psychic 
struggles. This makes sense, since in a novel we spend much of our time lis­
tening to the characters’ innermost thoughts. The characters in the movies are 
involved in both emotional and physical struggles, which are resolved through 
combinations of communication and action. Again, when you consider the 
medium, this makes sense: We cannot hear the thoughts of film characters, but 
we can see what they say and do. Finally, the game characters are involved in 
conflicts that are almost entirely physical. Since these characters mostly have no 
thoughts (the player does the thinking for them) and are only occasionally able 
to speak, this again makes perfect sense. In all three cases, the characters are 
defined by their media.
●
●
Reality → fantasy: The novels tend to be very reality based; the films tend to 
be rooted in reality, but often pushing toward fantasy, and the game worlds are 
almost entirely fantasy situations. And the characters reflect this—they are prod­
ucts of their environment.
●
●
Complex → simple. For a variety of reasons, the complexity of the plots and 
depth of the characters gradually diminishes as we move from novels to games.
From this, one might conclude that games are doomed to have simple fantasy 
characters engaging mostly in physical actions. And that certainly is the easy path. 
After all, you can get away with mere action in games when you usually can’t in 
movies or novels. But it doesn’t mean it isn’t possible to add more depth, more 
mental conflict, and more interesting character relationships into your games—it 
just means that it is challenging. Some of the games on this list, Final Fantasy VII, 
for instance, have very involved sets of character relationships structured around 
a simple gameplay structure—as involved as they are, players are crying out for 
more—they want their games to have richer, more meaningful characters and sto­
rylines. For much of this chapter, we will be looking at methods that storytellers 
in other media use to define their characters and consider how we can adapt these 
methods to the creation of strong game characters.
Let’s start with a very special character: the avatar.

348
CHAPTER Twenty • WORLDS CONTAIN CHARACTERS
Avatars
There is something magical about the character that a player controls in a game, 
so magical that we give that character a special name: the avatar. The word is 
derived from a Sanskrit word that refers to a god magically taking physical form 
on earth. And the name is well chosen for a game character, since a similarly 
magical transformation takes place when players use their avatar to enter the 
world of the game.
The relationship between player and avatar is strange. There are times when the 
player is distinctly apart from the avatar, but other times when the player’s mental 
state is completely projected into the avatar, to the point that the player gasps if the 
avatar is injured or threatened. This should not be completely surprising—after all, 
we have the ability to project ourselves into just about anything we control. When 
we drive a car, for example, we project our identity into the car, as if it is an exten­
sion of ourselves. Examining a parking space, we will often say “I don’t think I can 
fit in there.” And if another car collides with our car, we don’t say “He hit my car!” 
Instead we say “He hit me!” So it should be no surprise that we can project our­
selves into a videogame character that we have direct control over.
Designers often debate about which is more immersive: the first- or third-­
person view. One argument is that greater projection can be achieved by provid­
ing a first-person perspective on a scene with no visible avatar. However, the 
power of empathy is strong, and when controlling a visible avatar, guests often 
wince in imagined pain upon seeing their avatar suffer a blow or sigh in relief 
upon seeing their avatar escape physical harm. It is almost as if the avatar is a 
kind of kinesthetic voodoo doll for the guest. Bowlers are another example of 
this phenomenon, as they try to exert “body English” on a bowling ball as it rolls 
down the lane toward the pins. These movements are largely subconscious and 
are a result of a bowler projecting himself onto the ball. In this sense, the bowling 
ball serves as the bowler’s avatar.
And it is one thing to project ourselves into our avatar as if our avatar is a tool, 
but the experience of projection can be so much more powerful if we actually relate 
to the character in some way. So, what kinds of characters are best suited for players 
to project themselves into?
The Ideal Form
The first type of character that is a good choice as an avatar is the kind that the 
player has always wanted to be. Characters like this—such as mighty warriors, 
powerful wizards, attractive princesses, ultra-suave secret agents—exert a pull on 
the psyche, since the force inside us that pushes us toward being our best finds the 
idea of projecting ourselves into an idealized form very appealing. Although these 
characters are not much like our real selves at all, they are people we sometimes 
dream about being.

349
Avatars
The Blank Slate
The second type of character that works well as an avatar is one that is, as Scott 
McCloud puts it, iconic. In his excellent book, Understanding Comics, McCloud 
makes the interesting point that the less detail that goes into a character, the more 
opportunity the reader has to project themselves into that character.
McCloud further points out that in comics, it is often the case that characters 
or environments that are meant to seem alien, foreign, or scary are given a lot of 
detail, because more detail makes them more “other.” When you combine an iconic 
character with a detailed world, you get a powerful combination, as McCloud shows 
in the following:

350
CHAPTER Twenty • WORLDS CONTAIN CHARACTERS
This idea has bearing well beyond the domain of comics. In videogames, we see 
the same phenomenon. Some of the most popular and compelling avatars are ones 
that are very iconic. Consider Mario: He isn’t much of an idealized form, but he is 
simple, hardly speaks, and is completely nonthreatening, so it is easy to project 
yourself into him.
The idealized form and the blank slate are often mixed. Consider Spider Man, for 
example. He is an ideal form: a powerful and brave superhero, but the mask that 
covers his face makes him almost completely iconic—a blank slate that could be 
almost anyone.
Periodically, gimmicky systems show up that let you take your own photograph 
and put it on your avatar. I’ve heard people selling these systems refer to this as 
“the ultimate dream for any gamer.” But these systems, while interesting as a nov­
elty, never take hold in the long term because people don’t play games to be them­
selves—they play games to be the people they wish they could be.
In Chapter 16, “Interest Curve,” we introduced Lens #72, Projection as a tool to 
examine how well players project themselves into the imaginary world of the game. 
We should also add a more specific lens, which examines how well they project 
themselves into their avatar.
Creating Compelling Game Characters
The avatar is important in a game, just as the protagonist is important in a tradi­
tional story. But we must not forget the other characters. There are dozens of books 
on scriptwriting and storytelling that can give you good advice on how to make 
strong, compelling characters. Here I will summarize some of the methods I have 
found most useful for developing characters in games.
Character Tip #1: List Character Functions
In the process of creating a story, one frequently invents characters as the story­
line demands them. But how about when the game demands them? A very useful 
Lens #85: The Lens of the Avatar
The avatar is a player’s gateway into the world of the game. To ensure the ava­
tar brings out as much of the player’s identity as possible, ask yourself these 
questions:
●
●
Is my avatar an ideal form likely to resonate with my players?
●
●
Does my avatar have iconic qualities that let a player project themselves 
into the character?

351
Creating Compelling Game Characters
technique when coming up with the cast of characters in your game is to list all the 
functions that these characters need to fulfill. Then list the characters you had been 
thinking of putting in the game, and see how they match up. For example, if you are 
making an action platform game, your list might look like the following:
Character Functions:
	1.	 Hero: the character who plays the game
	2.	 Mentor: gives advice and useful items
	3.	 Assistant: gives occasional tips
	4.	 Tutor: explains how to play the game
	5.	 Final boss: someone to have the last battle against
	6.	 Minions: bad guys
	7.	 Three bosses: tough guys to battle against
	8.	 Hostage: someone to rescue
Taking a peek into your imagination, you might have seen these characters:
	a.	 Princess Mouse: beautiful, but tough and no nonsense
	b.	 Wise Old Owl: full of wisdom, but forgetful
	c.	 Silver Hawk: angry and vengeful
	d.	 Sammy Snake: amoral and full of wry humor
	e.	 Rat Army: hundreds of rats with evil red eyes
So, now you have to match the characters to the functions. This is an opportu­
nity to really get creative. The traditional thing would be to make Princess Mouse 
the hostage. But why not do something different; make her the mentor? Or the 
hero? Or even the final boss! The Rat Army seem like natural minions—but who 
knows? Maybe they only have evil red eyes because they have been captured 
by the evil Princess Mouse who has hypnotized them, and they are actually the 
hostages! Hmm… it also seems we don’t have enough characters to fill all eight 
roles—we could make up more characters, or we could give some characters mul­
tiple roles. What if your mentor, Wise Old Owl, turns out to be the final boss? It 
would be an ironic twist and save you on the cost of developing a new charac­
ter. Maybe the Assistant and Tutor are both Sammy Snake—or maybe the Silver 
Hawk, the hostage, mentors you by sending telepathic messages from where he 
is being held.
By separating the functions of the characters from your vision of the characters, 
you can think clearly about making sure the game has characters doing all the 
necessary jobs and sometimes make things more efficient by folding them together. 
This method serves as a handy lens.

352
CHAPTER Twenty • WORLDS CONTAIN CHARACTERS
Character Tip #2: Define and Use Character Traits
Let’s say we had some dialog between your heroine, Sabu, and her sidekick, Lester—
simple expositional stuff, which helps set up the next level. Something like
LESTER: Sabu!
SABU: What is it?
LESTER: Someone has stolen the king’s crown!
SABU: Do you realize what this means?
LESTER: No.
SABU: It means the Dark Arrow has returned. We must stop him!
This dialog is pretty flat. While it tells us about the situation (missing crown) and 
the villain (Dark Arrow), it tells us nothing about Sabu or Lester. Your characters 
need to say and do things that define them as real people. To do this, you must 
know their traits.
There are many ways to define traits for your characters. Some advise creat­
ing a “character bible,” where you list out every possible thing you can think of 
that defines your character—their loves and hates, how they dress, what they eat, 
where they grew up, etc. And this can be a useful exercise. But ultimately, you 
will probably want to boil things down to a simpler essence: a small, distilled list 
of traits that encapsulate the character. You want to choose traits that are going 
to stay with your character through many situations that really define them as a 
person. Sometimes these can be a little contradictory, but real people have con­
tradictory traits, so why shouldn’t characters? Let’s say we gave Sabu and Lester 
these traits:
Sabu: trustworthy, short tempered, valiant, a fiery lover
Lester: arrogant, sarcastic, spiritual, impulsive
Lens #86: The Lens of Character Function
To make sure your characters are doing everything your game needs them to 
do, ask yourself these questions:
●
●
What are the roles I need the characters to fill?
●
●
What characters have I already imagined?
●
●
Which characters map well to which roles?
●
●
Can any characters fill more than one role?
●
●
Do I need to change the characters to better fit the roles?
●
●
Do I need any new characters?

353
Creating Compelling Game Characters
Now, let’s rewrite the dialog, trying to imbue it with these traits—preferably with 
more than one at a time (remember Lens #49, Elegance?).
LESTER (exploding into the room): By the Gods! Sabu, I have news! (impulsive 
and spiritual)
SABU: (covering herself): How dare you intrude on my privacy! (short tempered)
LESTER: Whatever. Maybe you don’t care that the king’s crown has been stolen? 
(arrogant and sarcastic)
SABU (a faraway look in her eye): This means I must do what I promised… (trust­
worthy and valiant)
LESTER: I pray to Vishnu this is not another story of an old flame… (Lester: spiri­
tual and sarcastic; Sabu: fiery lover)
SABU: Silence! The Dark Arrow broke my heart, and the heart of my sister—I 
promised her that if he ever returned, I would risk my life to destroy him. 
Prepare the chariot! (short tempered, fiery lover, trustworthy, valiant)
It isn’t simply dialog that benefits from this treatment. The actions you choose for 
your character, and how they are carried out, should demonstrate the traits as well. 
If your character is sneaky, does it show in his jump animation? If your character 
is depressed, does it show when they run? Maybe a depressed character shouldn’t 
run, but only walk. There is nothing magical about having lists of traits and using 
them—it just means that you know your characters well.
Character Tip #3: Use the Interpersonal Circumplex
Your characters won’t be alone, of course—they are going to interact with each 
other. One tool that Katherine Isbister brought from the world of social psychol­
ogy into the world of game design is the interpersonal circumplex. It is a graph 
you can use to visualize the relationships between characters. It has two axes: 
friendliness and dominance. This complex diagram shows where many traits lie 
on this graph:
Lens #87: The Lens of Character Traits
To ensure that the traits of a character show in what they say and do, ask 
yourself these questions:
●
●
What traits define my character?
●
●
How do these traits manifest themselves in the words, actions, and appear­
ance of my character?

CHAPTER Twenty • WORLDS CONTAIN CHARACTERS
This looks kind of overwhelming, but it can be a simple tool to use. Let’s say we 
wanted to show how other Star Wars characters related to Han Solo. Since friendli­
ness and dominance are relative characteristics, we always need to make them 
relative to a particular character. So Figure 20.5 is how you might graph out the 
characters relative to Han.
Laying the characters out on a graph like this gives a good way to visualize char­
acter relationships. Notice how extreme Darth Vader, Chewbacca, and C3PO are on 
the graph—these extremes are part of what makes them interesting. Also notice that 
the people he communicates with the most are the closest to him on the graph. What 
does the fact that there are no characters in the lower left quadrant tell us about Han? 
Consider how different the graphs would be for Luke, or for Darth Vader.
The circumplex is not a be-all or end-all tool, but it can be useful for thinking 
about character relationships because of the questions it can prompt. So, let’s put it 
in our toolbox.

Character Tip #4: Make a Character Web
The circumplex is a nice visual way to see some character relationships. But there 
can be many other factors in the relationships between your characters. The charac­
ter web is a good way to explore how the characters feel about each other and why. 
Lens #88: The Lens of the Interpersonal Circumplex
Understanding the relationships between your characters is crucial. One way 
to do this is to create a graph with one axis labeled hostile/friendly and the 
other labeled submissive/dominant. Pick a character to analyze, and put them 
in the middle. Plot out where other characters lie relative to that character, and 
ask yourself these questions:
●
●
Are there any gaps in the chart? Why are they there? Would it be better if 
the gaps were filled?
●
●
Are there “extreme characters” on the graph? If not, would it be better if 
there were?
●
●
Are the character’s friends in the same quadrant, or different quadrants? 
What if that were different?

CHAPTER Twenty • WORLDS CONTAIN CHARACTERS
The idea is simple: To analyze a character, write down what that character thinks of 
all the other characters. Here’s an example from the world of Archie comics:
Archie
●
●
Veronica: Archie is lured by her elegance and beauty. Though she is rich, Archie 
doesn’t care much about that.
●
●
Betty: Archie’s true love, but her insecurity constantly gives him mixed signals, 
so he doesn’t pursue her as forcefully as he might.
●
●
Reggie: Archie shouldn’t trust Reggie, but he often does, because Archie always 
tries to be a nice guy and Archie is kind of gullible.
●
●
Jughead: Archie’s best friend. What they have in common is that they are both 
underdogs.
Veronica
●
●
Archie: Veronica finds Archie attractive, but sometimes she seeks to date him to 
frustrate Betty and because she can always feel superior around him.
●
●
Betty: Veronica trusts Betty as a friend because they were friends as little girls. 
Veronica likes how she can always feel superior to Betty in terms of wealth and 
class, but it really frustrates Veronica that Betty is a better person.
●
●
Reggie: Reggie is an attractive buffoon who appreciates wealth, but Veronica 
gets frustrated that Reggie doesn’t really respect or love her.
●
●
Jughead: A nauseating freak—Veronica can’t understand why Archie is friends 
with him. Veronica often bribes him with food to get what she wants.
Betty
●
●
Archie: Her true love. She is shy, though, about telling him how she really feels, 
because Betty has low self-esteem.
●
●
Veronica: Betty’s BFF. She can be mean sometimes, and she is too money crazy, 
but friends are friends forever, so Betty stays with Veronica.
●
●
Reggie: Betty is intimidated by his wealth and showy attempts at class. She feels 
like she is supposed to like him, but secretly she is repelled by him.
●
●
Jughead: Betty thinks he’s cute and funny and glad that he’s such a good friend 
to her true love.
Reggie
●
●
Archie: Reggie’s archrival. Reggie can’t imagine what anyone sees in such a 
dopey nice guy. Occasionally, Reggie envies Archie’s popularity, but he always 
thinks he can find a tricky way to outdo Archie.

357
Creating Compelling Game Characters
●
●
Veronica: Reggie finds her attractive and rich—he likes the power of her wealth.
●
●
Betty: Reggie finds her attractive, and though her low self-esteem is a turnoff, to 
be able to win her, he would show his superiority over Archie.
●
●
Jughead: Reggie sees him as a total loser who deserves to be bullied, especially 
since he is friends with Archie.
Jughead
●
●
Archie: Jughead’s best friend, and the only one who understands and appreci­
ates Jughead’s love of food.
●
●
Veronica: The mean girl that Archie likes.
●
●
Betty: The nice girl that Archie likes.
●
●
Reggie: A bully.
You can see that this takes a little time, but it can be well worth the effort 
because of the questions it raises about character interactions you might not have 
thought about. It’s a very handy lens for giving your characters more depth.
The success of television shows like Lost and The Simpsons comes from a deep 
exploration of the character web. It is rare to see it explored well in games, which 
makes it an opportunity worth pursuing.
Character Tip #5: Use Status
Most of the character tips we’ve seen so far come from writers. But there is another 
profession that knows just as much about creating compelling characters, if not 
more—actors. Many people have drawn parallels between the unpredictable nature 
of interactive storytelling and the unpredictable nature of improvisational theater; 
indeed, the techniques of the improvisational actor can prove quite useful to game 
designers. These techniques are many and are well described in several books, 
but there is one, for me, that stands out above all others. It is really not so much a 
Lens #89: The Lens of the Character Web
To flesh out your characters’ relationships better, make a list of all your char­
acters, and ask yourself these questions:
●
●
How, specifically, does each character feel about each of the others?
●
●
Are there any connections unaccounted for? How can I use those?
●
●
Are there too many similar connections? How can they be more different?

358
CHAPTER Twenty • WORLDS CONTAIN CHARACTERS
technique, but a lens described impeccably well by Keith Johnstone in his classic 
book Impro—it is the Lens of Status.
Whenever people meet or interact, there is a hidden negotiation that constantly 
takes place. We are mostly not conscious of it, since it predates our ability to speak. 
It is our negotiation of status; that is, who is in charge of the current interaction? 
Status is not a matter of who you are; status is something you do. Johnstone illus­
trates this quite well with this bit of dialog:
TRAMP: ‘Ere! Where are you going?
DUCHESS: I’m sorry, I didn’t quite catch…
TRAMP: Are you deaf as well as blind?
The tramp, who you might expect to be very low status, is taking on an attitude 
of very high status. Any time two or more people interact in any setting—whether 
friends or enemies, collaborators or competitors, masters or servants—a negotiation 
of status takes place. We do this almost entirely subconsciously with posture, tone 
of voice, eye contact, and dozens of other detailed behaviors. What is surprising is 
how consistent these behaviors are across all cultures.
●
●
Typical low-status behaviors include fidgeting, avoiding eye contact, touching 
one’s own face, and generally being tense.
●
●
Typical high-status behaviors include being relaxed and in control, making 
strong eye contact, and, weirdly, not moving your head while you speak.
A typical improv exercise is to split the group of actors into two groups, who then 
intermingle—individuals in the first group (low status) make brief eye contact, then 
look away, while the second group (high status) makes and holds eye contact with 
others. Most actors who try this exercise quickly realize that this isn’t just playing 
pretend—the actors in the low-status group quickly find that they feel inferior and 
start unconsciously taking on other low-status characteristics. The actors in the 
high-status group start to feel superior and take on high-status characteristics. Even 
if you are by yourself, try talking without moving your head at all, and see how it 
makes you feel—or try the opposite—talking while turning your head frequently, 
and you will quickly get the idea.
Status is a relative thing, not absolute to an individual. Darth Vader takes on 
high-status behavior when he deals with Princess Leia, but he takes on low status 
when he deals with the Emperor.
Status can be conveyed in surprising ways—slow motion, for example, gives 
high status, as we’ve seen in The Six Million Dollar Man, The Matrix, and countless 
shampoo commercials. The way characters occupy space is also very telling of sta­
tus. Low-status characters go to places where they are less likely to encounter others 
or be noticed. High-status characters are in the most important place in the room.
Status is like a secret language that we all know so well we don’t know we’re 
speaking it. The problem with it being so subconscious is that when we create 
artificial characters, it doesn’t occur to us to give them these behaviors, because 

359
Creating Compelling Game Characters
generally we aren’t aware that we do these things. But if you do give these behaviors 
to your characters, you will quickly find that they seem aware of each other in a way 
that most videogame characters are not.
The game Munch’s Oddysee has great examples of character status interactions. 
In it, you control two different characters, one of whom is a slave and the other is 
bound to a wheelchair (low status). Throughout the game, you face arrogant (high-
status) enemies and get help from slavish (low-status) followers. The interactions 
between all these are quite interesting to see, and a great deal of comedy comes 
from unexpected status reversals, such as the followers mouthing off at Munch or 
at the enemies. The characters in this game show an awareness of each other’s pres­
ence that, while crude, is a step above many other games.
Status is a largely unexplored area in interactive entertainment. Brenda Harger, 
who first introduced me to the concept of status, is an excellent improv actress and 
a researcher at the Entertainment Technology Center at Carnegie Mellon University. 
She and her students have done some fascinating work on creating artificially intel­
ligent characters that are aware of their status and of the status of other characters 
and automatically adopt appropriate postures, actions, and personal space. Right 
now, most videogame characters behave the same way no matter who is around. It 
seems likely that the next generation of interactive game characters will seem more 
alive because they are aware of status.
In Chapter 16, “Interest Curve,” we talked about how important things that 
change dramatically are inherently interesting. Status is one of those important 
things. During arguments, people are vying to have the highest status (either by 
raising their own or lowering the status of their opponent), and this seesaw of status 
is what makes arguments interesting.
Status isn’t just about dialog, though—it is also about movement, eye contact, 
territory, and what characters do. It is a way of looking at the world, so let’s put it 
in our toolbox.
Lens #90: The Lens of Status
When people interact, they take on different behaviors depending on their 
status levels. To make your characters more aware of each other, ask yourself 
these questions:
●
●
What are the relative status levels of the characters in my game?
●
●
How can they show appropriate status behaviors?
●
●
Conflicts of status are interesting—how are my characters vying for status?
●
●
Changes of status are interesting—where do they happen in my game?
●
●
How am I giving the player a chance to express status?

360
CHAPTER Twenty • WORLDS CONTAIN CHARACTERS
Of course, having an understanding of status does more than give you insights 
into how to make realistic characters—it helps you understand and control real-life 
situations, like design meetings and client negotiations, but we’ll discuss those in 
later chapters.
Character Tip #6: Use the Power of the Voice
The human voice is an incredibly powerful thing, which can affect us at a deep 
subconscious level. This is why talking pictures elevated the cinema from a novelty 
to the dominant art form of the twentieth century. It is only in the past few years 
that technology has permitted videogames to make serious use of voice acting. Even 
now, the voice acting in games seems primitive compared to the powerful perfor­
mances in films.
Partly, this is true because game developers are often inexperienced when 
working with voice talent. Directing a voice actor is a delicate art that takes a 
certain knack and years of practice to do well. But there is another reason for 
weak voice acting in games—it is because we do the process backwards. In ani­
mated films, a script is written first, and then voice actors are brought in to record 
it. As they do, lines are changed, improvisations are made, and the good ones 
are incorporated into the script. Once the recordings are in place, the characters 
get designed (often incorporating facial features of the actors), and animation 
commences. In videogames, we do this the other way—the characters are often 
designed and modeled first; then the script is written, often basic animations are 
created; and then the voice acting is added last. This diminishes the power of 
the voice actor, who is now just trying to imitate what he sees, instead of rightly 
expressing how he truly feels his idea of the character would act and behave. The 
voice actor becomes peripheral to the creative process, not central, and the power 
of voice is weakened.
Why do we do this backwards? Because the process of game development is so 
volatile, it is expensive to create characters around their voices, since the script 
continues to change throughout the entire process. Hopefully, with time, we will 
develop techniques that will allow voice actors to become more central to game 
character design and reclaim the power of voice. Naughty Dog is one company that 
takes this notion seriously—both the Uncharted series and The Last of Us involved 
dozens of recording sessions that spanned the length of the projects, and the itera­
tive work with the voice actors seems to have made a real difference in the emo­
tional power of these games.
Character Tip #7: Use the Power of the Face
A huge percentage of our brains is taken up with custom hardware for processing 
facial expression. We have the most complex and expressive faces in the entire 
animal kingdom. Notice, for example, our eye whites—other animals do not have 

361
Creating Compelling Game Characters
visible eye whites. It would appear we evolved them as a method of communication. 
We are also the only animal that blushes and the only animal that cries.
Despite all these, few videogames give facial animation the attention it deserves. 
Game designers are so focused on the actions of the characters that they give little 
thought to their emotions. When a game does have meaningful facial animation 
(such as Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker), it often garners a lot of attention. The 
designers of OnLive Traveler, an early 3D chat room, had very strict polygon budgets 
for their characters. As they built and tested prototypes, they would ask their users 
each time: “Do the characters need more details?” And every time, the answer 
would come back, “Yes— in the face.” After five or six rounds of this, the bodies 
dwindled away to nothing, leaving the characters as eerie floating heads—but this 
was what the users preferred, since this was an activity about self-expression, and 
faces are the most expressive tool that exists.
Facial animation doesn’t have to be expensive—you can get tremendous power 
out of simple animated eyebrows or eye shapes. But you do have to have a character 
face that will be visible to the player. Avatar faces generally are not visible to the 
player. The designers of Doom found a way to change that by putting a small picture 
of the avatar’s face on the bottom of the screen. Since we can notice facial expression 
in our peripheral vision more easily than we can discern numbers, they wisely made 
the facial expression correspond to the health meter, so that players got a sense of 
how injured they were without having to take their eyes off of their enemies.

362
CHAPTER Twenty • WORLDS CONTAIN CHARACTERS
Most of all, you should focus on your characters’ eyes. It is said that the eyes are the 
windows to the soul, but so often, videogame characters have dull, dead eyes. If you 
can bring the eyes of your character to life, the whole character will come alive. Want 
your villain to seem evil? Focus on the eyes. Want your zombie to seem creepy? Give 
him creepy eyes. Want your penguin to seem cute? Focus on cute eyes. Another inter­
esting fact about eyes—we use them to tell who is related. Look at the cartoon eyes in 
the Simpsons, for example—each family has one set of eyes. Eyes hold many secrets. 
Give them proper attention, and your characters will thank you by coming to life.
Character Tip #8: Powerful Stories Transform Characters
People do not change, they are merely revealed.
—Anne Enright
One distinguishing feature of great stories is how their characters change. Video 
game designers seldom consider this, to their detriment. There is a tendency to treat 
game characters as fixed types—the villain is always the villain, the hero was born 
a hero. This makes for very boring storytelling. A few games, such as Fable and 
Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic, became famous because of the fact that they 
do what nearly every successful movie or book does—let events change the main 
character over time.
It is certainly true that meaningful character change is not possible for the main 
character in every game. But perhaps character change can happen to other char­
acters in the game such as the sidekick or the villain. A great way to visualize the 
potential for character change in your game is to make a character transformation 
chart, with characters on the left side and the different sections of your story along 
the top. Then, mark down the places where a character undergoes some kind of 
change. For example, consider the changes in the story of Cinderella:

363
Creating Compelling Game Characters
By looking at each character over time, instead of just the story thread, we get a 
unique perspective that helps us to better understand our characters. Some transfor­
mations are temporary and small, others are great and permanent. By considering 
how your characters should change and making the most of that, your game will 
tell a far more powerful story than if they pass through the story untouched by it. 
This perspective of character transformation is our final character lens.
Character Tip #9: Let Your Characters Surprise Us
In the novel Tender is the Night by F. Scott Fitzgerald, there is a conversation between 
Rosemary and Dick, which is terribly important to us as storytellers. It begins with 
Rosemary, the actress, asking a simple question:
“I wanted to ask you what you thought of my latest pictures— if you saw them.”
“It’ll take a few minutes to tell you,” Dick said. “Let’s suppose that Nicole says 
to you that Lanier is ill. What do you do in life? What does anyone do? They 
ACT— face, voice, words— the face shows sorrow, the voice shows shock, the 
words show sympathy.”
“Yes— I understand.”
“But in the theatre, No. In the theatre all the best comediennes have built up 
their reputations by burlesquing the correct emotional responses— fear and love 
and sympathy.”
“I see.” Yet she did not quite see.
“The danger to an actress is in responding. Again, let’s suppose that somebody 
told you, ‘Your lover is dead.’ In life you’d probably go to pieces. But on the stage 
you’re trying to entertain— the audience can do the ‘responding’ for themselves. 
First the actress has lines to follow, then she has to get the audience’s attention 
Lens #91: The Lens of Character Transformation
We pay attention to character transformation, because we care about what 
might change us. To ensure your characters are transforming in interesting 
ways, ask yourself these questions:
●
●
How does each of my characters change throughout the game?
●
●
How am I communicating those changes to the player? Can I communicate 
them more clearly, or more strongly?
●
●
Is there enough change?
●
●
Are the changes surprising and interesting?
●
●
Are the changes believable?

364
CHAPTER Twenty • WORLDS CONTAIN CHARACTERS
back on herself, away from the murdered Chinese or whatever the thing is. So 
she must do something unexpected. If the audience thinks the character is hard 
she goes soft on them— if they think she’s soft she goes hard. You go all OUT of 
character— you understand?”
“I don’t quite,” admitted Rosemary. “How do you mean out of character?”
“You do the unexpected thing until you’ve manoeuvred the audience back from 
the objective fact to yourself. THEN you slide into character again.”
This advice seems completely contrary to everything we know about storytelling 
and acting. We expect characters to behave realistically and believably. But here, 
Fitzgerald is telling us that in a good story, the characters do the opposite of what the 
audience expects. And it is totally true. When you know it look for it, you can see it 
everywhere. It’s in comedies, dramas, the classics, everywhere. The popular televi­
sion show Breaking Bad was practically founded on this principle. It’s yet another 
use for The Lens of Surprise. When characters have an emotional reaction that isn’t 
what we expect, we pay attention. Look for ways to let your characters surprise your 
players, and the players will hang on your characters’ every word and action.
Character Tip #10: Avoid the Uncanny Valley
Japanese roboticist Masahiro Mori noted something interesting about human 
response to robots and other artificial characters. If you think about how people 
empathize, you might notice that the closer something is to seeming human, the 
more they can empathize with it. You might even lay this out on a graph like:
And this makes perfect sense. The more something is like a person, the more 
empathy we give it. But Mori noted an interesting exception, as he worked on robots 
that tried to mimic humans—as soon as they started to get too human, perhaps 
moving from a metal face (think C-3PO) to one with artificial skin, people suddenly 
found them repulsive. It made the graph look like this:
Mori referred to this surprising dip in the curve as “the uncanny valley.” The 
cause of this uneasy feeling may be that when we see things that almost look like

Other Reading to Consider
people, our brains register them as “diseased people” who might be dangerous to 
be around. Zombies are a canonical example of the creepy things that live at the 
bottom of the uncanny valley.
The uncanny valley shows up in videogames and animation all the time. Every 
frame of films such as Final Fantasy and Polar Express look gorgeous and natu­
ral—when you just look at one frame. But when the films are in motion, there is 
something about the computer-generated humans that many people find creepy—
somehow, they don’t move quite right—they got too close to the valley and fell in. 
Contrast those characters to the cartoony characters (fish, toys, cars, robots) in 
Pixar films that have no problem generating empathy, because they stay to the left 
side of the valley, where that puppy dog is.
Videogame characters can easily have the same problems—especially in games 
that try to mimic reality. The day may come where videogame characters are so 
human looking that they can safely exist on the right side of the valley, but until 
then, use caution—it’s a long way down.
Characters definitely make a world more interesting, but for it to be a world at all, 
it needs something else—a space to exist.

CHAPTER Twenty-One • WORLDS CONTAIN SPACES
Wait a minute—didn’t we cover the idea of space in Chapter 12, “Mechanics?” Yes 
and no. We discussed the idea of functional space—but functional space is only the 
skeleton of the game space. In this chapter, we will examine the fleshed-out space 
the player actually experiences.
The Purpose of Architecture
Yes, build a Frank Lloyd house if you don’t mind camping in the front yard 
when it rains.
—Aline Barnsdall
What do you think of when you hear the word “architecture”? Most people think of 
grand buildings, particularly modern buildings with unusual shapes. People some­
times seem to think that the primary job of the architect is to sculpt the outer 
shape of a building, and that appreciation of good architecture means enjoying 
these building shapes like one might enjoy sculptures in a museum.
And while the outer shape of a structure is one aspect of architecture, it has little 
to do with the primary purpose of architecture.
The primary purpose of architecture is to control a person’s experience.
If all the experiences we wanted to have were to be found easily in nature, there 
would be no point to architecture. But those experiences aren’t always there, so 
architects design things to help us have the experiences we desire. We want to 
experience shade and dryness, so we put up shelters. We want to experience safety 
and security, so we build walls. We build houses, schools, malls, churches, offices, 
bowling alleys, hotels, and museums not because we want to look at those build­
ings, but because there are experiences we want to have that these buildings make 
possible. And when we say one of these buildings is “well designed,” we aren’t talk­
ing about what it looks like on the outside. What we are talking about is how well it 
creates the kind of experience we want to have when we are inside.
For this reason, architects and game designers are close cousins. Both create 
structures that people must enter in order to use. Neither architects nor game 
designers can create experiences directly—instead, both must rely on the use of 
indirect control to guide people into having the right kind of experience. And most 
importantly, both create structures that have no point other than to engender expe­
riences that make people happy.
Organizing Your Game Space
There is a more obvious connection between game designers and architects as 
well—both have to create spaces. And while game designers can learn a lot about 
creating meaningful and powerful spaces from architects, by no means do game 

369
Organizing Your Game Space
designers have to follow every rule of architecture, since the spaces they create are 
not made of bricks and mortar, but are completely virtual structures. And while this 
sounds like a wonderful freedom (it is), it can also be a burden. The lack of physical 
constraints means almost anything is possible—and if anything is possible, where 
do you begin?
One way to begin is to decide on an organizing principle for your game 
space. If you already have a pretty good idea how your game will be played, 
this should be pretty easy. Just look at your game through Lens #26, Functional 
Space (from Chapter 12, “Mechanics”), and use that as the skeleton for the 
space you will build.
But maybe you are still figuring out your functional space—perhaps your game 
design is still very early, and you are hoping that by creating a map, you might get a 
better sense of how your game works. In that case, here are five common ways that 
designers organize their game spaces.
	1.	 Linear: A surprising number of games are arranged on a linear game space 
where a player can only move forward and (maybe) back along a line. Sometimes 
the line has two ends; other times, it loops back on itself. Some well-known lin­
ear game spaces are as follows:
	
a.	 Candyland
	
b.	 Monopoly
	
c.	 Super Mario Brothers
	
d.	 Jetpack Joyride
	
e.	 Guitar Hero
	
	2.	 Grid: Arranging your game space on a grid has a lot of advantages. It can be easy 
for players to understand, it makes it easier to ensure that things line up, it keeps 
things in proper proportion, and of course, grids are very easy for computers to 
understand. Your grid need not be a grid of squares—it can also be of rectangles, 
hexagons (popular in war games), or even triangles. Some well-known grid-
based games are as follows:
	
a.	 Chess
	
b.	 Advance Wars

370
CHAPTER Twenty-One • WORLDS CONTAIN SPACES
	
c.	 Settlers of Catan
	
d.	 Legend of Zelda (NES)
	
e.	 Minecraft
	
	3.	 Web: A web arrangement is achieved by marking several points on a map and 
connecting them with paths. This is useful when you have several places you 
want players to visit but you want to give them a number of different ways to 
get to them. Sometimes there is meaningful travel along the paths, but other 
times, travel is instantaneous. Some examples of web-based game spaces are as 
follows:
	
a.	 Fox and Geese
	
b.	 Trivial Pursuit
	
c.	 Zork
	
d.	 Club Penguin
	
e.	 Puzzle Quest
	
	4.	 Points in space: This somewhat uncommon type of game space is usually for 
games that want to evoke something like wandering a desert and occasionally 
returning to an oasis, like one does in an RPG. It also is common for games 
where players get to define the game space themselves. Some examples of this 
kind of spatial organization are the following:
	
a.	 Bocce
	
b.	 Thin Ice (a board game involving wet marbles and a napkin)
	
c.	 Polarity (magnetic board game)

371
Organizing Your Game Space
	
d.	 Animal Crossing
	
e.	 Final Fantasy
	
	5.	 Divided space: This kind of space is most like a real map and is common in 
games that are trying to replicate a real map. It is achieved by carving the space 
up into sections in an irregular way. Some examples of games that have divided 
space are as follows:
	
a.	 Risk
	
b.	 Axis and Allies
	
c.	 Dark Tower
	
d.	 Zelda: Ocarina of Time
	
e.	 Civilization
	
These different organizing principles are often combined to make interesting new 
types of game spaces. The game of Clue is a combination of the grid and divided 
space patterns. Baseball is a combination of a linear structure and points in space.
A Word about Landmarks
One very important thing to consider whenever you organize a space: What are the 
landmarks? The very first text adventure game, Colossal Cave, had two different mazes. 
In one, every area was described as “You are in a maze of twisty passages, all alike.” 
Just as confusing though was the opposite maze, in which every area was described 
as “You are in a maze of twisty passages, all different.” For it is certainly true that too 
much chaos is just as monotonous as too much order. Players of Colossal Cave learned 
to drop items in the mazes, forming landmarks that helped them find their way. Any 
good game space has built-in landmarks, which help the players find where they are 
going and also make the space interesting to look at. Landmarks are what players 
remember and what they talk about, for they are what make a space memorable.

CHAPTER Twenty-One • WORLDS CONTAIN SPACES
Christopher Alexander Is a Genius
Christopher Alexander is an architect who has devoted his life to studying how 
places make us feel. His first book, The Timeless Way of Building (1979), tries to 
describe how there is a unique quality shared by spaces and objects that are truly 
well designed. As he puts it:
Imagine yourself on a winter afternoon with a pot of tea, a reading light, and 
two or three huge pillows to lean back against. Now make yourself comfortable. 
Not in some way which you can show to other people, and say how much you 
like it. I mean so that you really like it, for yourself.
You put the tea where you can reach it: but in a place where you can’t possibly 
knock it over. You pull the light down, to shine on the book, but not too brightly, 
and so that you can’t see the naked bulb. You put the cushions behind you, and 
place them, carefully, one by one, just where you want them, to support your 
back, your neck, your arm: so that you are supported just comfortably, just as 
you want to sip your tea, and read, and dream.
When you take the trouble to do all that, and you do it carefully, with much 
attention, then it may begin to have the quality which has no name.
It is hard to put a finger on exactly what this quality is, but most people know it 
when they experience it. Alexander notes that things that have the nameless quality 
usually have these aspects:
●
●
They feel alive, as if they hold energy.
●
●
They feel whole, like nothing is missing.
●
●
They feel comfortable; it is pleasing to be around them.
●
●
They feel free, not constrained unnaturally.
●
●
They feel exact, as if they are just how they are supposed to be.
●
●
They feel egoless, connected to the universe.
●
●
They feel eternal, as if they have always been and always will be.
●
●
They are free from inner contradictions.
The last of those, “free from inner contradictions,” is tremendously important to 
any designer, because inner contradictions are at the heart of any bad design. If a 
device is supposed to make my life easier, and it is hard to use, that is a contradic­
tion. If something is supposed to be fun, and it is boring or frustrating, that is a 
contradiction. A good designer must carefully remove inner contradictions, and not 
get used to them, or make excuses for them—so let’s add a tool to our toolbox for 
removing them.

373
Christopher Alexander Is a Genius
Alexander also explains that only through iteration and observation about how 
something is used can one arrive at a truly excellent design. In other words, the 
Rule of the Loop holds in architecture as well as game design. A concrete example 
of this is the system he describes for laying paths between buildings in a complex: 
“Lay no paths at all. Merely plant grass. Then come back a year later, see where 
people have worn paths in the grass, and only then begin to pave.”
Alexander’s next book, A Pattern Language, is his most famous and influen­
tial work. In it, he describes 253 different architectural patterns that seem to have 
the nameless quality. They range from large-scale patterns like “distribution of 
towns” and “agricultural valleys” to small-scale patterns such as “canvas roofs” and 
“windows which open wide.” The scope and striking detail of A Pattern Language 
changes the reader’s viewpoint about how they interact with the everyday world. 
Many game designers have stories to tell about how the book inspired them. 
Personally, I was baffled about how to structure the world of Toontown Online until 
I read this text, and suddenly much of it seemed obvious. Will Wright is said to 
have designed SimCity based on a desire to experiment with the patterns listed in 
the book. The entire “design patterns” movement in computer science stems from 
the power of this text as well. What will you create when you read it?
Alexander was not content to leave the nameless quality nameless. In his later 
books, he makes a deeper study of what truly gives something that special feeling. 
He did this by cataloging thousands of different things that did, or did not, have 
that feeling and then looked for similarities between them. In doing so, he gradu­
ally distilled out fifteen fundamental qualities that these things shared, as detailed 
in The Phenomenon of Life. The book gets its title from an insight he had about the 
nameless quality: The reason some things seem special to us is that they have some 
of the same qualities that living things have. As living beings ourselves, we feel 
connected to things and places that have qualities special to living things.
Delving into detail about these properties is well beyond the scope of this book, 
but it can be fascinating and useful to reflect on whether your game contains them. 
It is excellent mental exercise just to think about how these patterns, which mostly 
are about spatial and textural qualities, apply to games at all.
Lens #92: The Lens of Inner Contradiction
A good game cannot contain properties that defeat the game’s very purpose. 
To remove those contradictory qualities, ask yourself these questions:
●
●
What is the purpose of my game?
●
●
What are the purposes of each subsystem in my game?
●
●
Is there anything at all in my game that contradicts these purposes?
●
●
If so, how can I change that?

CHAPTER Twenty-One • WORLDS CONTAIN SPACES
Alexander’s Fifteen Properties of Living Structures
	 1.	Levels of scale: We see levels of scale in “telescoping goals,” where a player has 
to satisfy short-term goals to reach midterm ones and to eventually reach long-
term goals. We see it in fractal interest curves. We also see it in nested game 
world structures. Spore is a symphony of levels of scale.
	 2.	Strong centers: We see this in visual layout, certainly, but also in our story 
structure. The avatar is at the center of our game universe—and generally we 
prefer strong avatars over weak ones. Also, we prefer strong centers when it 
comes to our purpose in the game—our goal.
	 3.	Boundaries: Many games are primarily about boundaries! Certainly, any game 
about territory is an exploration of boundaries. But rules are another kind of 
boundary, and a game with no rules is no game at all.
	 4.	Alternating repetition: We see this on the pleasing shape of the chessboard, 
and we see it too in the cycle of level/boss/level/boss that comes up in so many 
games. Even tense/release/tense/release is an example of pleasing alternating 
repetition, as seen in Figure 10.7.
	 5.	Positive space: What Alexander means here is that the foreground and back­
ground elements both have beautiful, complementary shapes, like yin and yang. 
In a sense, a well-balanced game has this quality—allowing multiple alternate 
strategies to have an interlocked beauty.
	 6.	Good shape: This is as simple as it sounds—a shape that is pleasing. We cer­
tainly look for this in the visual elements of our games. But we can see and feel 
it, too, in level design. A good level feels “solid” and has a “good curve.”
	 7.	Local symmetries: This is different from an overall symmetry, like a mirror 
image; instead, this refers to multiple small, internal symmetries in a design. 
Zelda: The Wind Waker has this feeling throughout its architecture—when you 
are within a room or area, it seems to have a symmetry, but it is connected to 
other places in a way that feels organic. Rule systems and game balance can 
have this property as well.
	 8.	Deep interlock and ambiguity: This is when two things are so tightly inter­
twined that they define each other—if you took one away, the other wouldn’t be 
itself any longer. We see this in many board games, such as Go. The position of 
the pieces on the board is only meaningful relative to the opponent’s pieces.
	 9.	Contrast: In games, we have many kinds of contrast. The contrast between 
opponents, between what is controllable and what is not, and between reward 
and punishment. When opposites in our game are strongly contrasted, the game 
feels more meaningful and more powerful.
	10.	Gradients: This refers to qualities that change gradually. The gradually increas­
ing challenge curve is an example of this, but so are appropriately designed 
probability curves.

375
Christopher Alexander Is a Genius
	11.	 Roughness: When a game is too perfect, it has no character. The handmade 
feeling of “house rules” often makes a game seem more alive.
	12.	Echoes: Echoes are a kind of pleasing, unifying repetition. When the boss mon­
ster has something in common with his minions, we are experiencing echoes. 
Good interest curves have this property, especially fractal ones.
	13.	 The void: As Alexander says, “In the most profound centers which have perfect 
wholeness, there is at the heart a void which is like water, infinite in depth, sur­
rounded by and contrasted with the clutter of the stuff and fabric all around it.” 
Think of a church, or the human heart. When boss monsters tend to be in large, 
hollow spaces, we are experiencing the void.
	14.	 Simplicity and inner calm: Designers talk endlessly about how important it is 
for a game to be simple—usually with a small number of rules that have emer­
gent properties. Of course, these rules must be well balanced, which gives them 
the inner calm that Alexander describes.
	15.	Not-separateness: This refers to something being well connected to its sur­
roundings—as if it was part of them. Each rule of our game should have 
this property, but so should every element of our game. If everything in 
our game has this quality, a certain wholeness results, which makes the 
game feel very alive indeed. Lens #11, Unification can be a good guide to 
not-separateness.
Alexander’s approach to architecture can be quite useful when designing a game 
space. But as you see, the qualities he describes for a good space apply to many 
other aspects of game design as well. I have only been able to scratch the surface of 
Alexander’s approach to design here. Reading his many delightful books will surely 
give you new insights into game design. As a reminder of his thoughtful perspec­
tive, take this lens.
Lens #93: The Lens of The Nameless Quality
Certain things feel special and wonderful because of their natural, organic 
design. To ensure your game has these properties, ask yourself these questions:
●
●
Does my design have a special feeling of life, or do parts of my design feel 
dead? What would make my design feel more alive?
●
●
Which of Alexander’s fifteen qualities does my design have?
●
●
Could it have more of them, somehow?
●
●
Where does my design feel like myself?

376
CHAPTER Twenty-One • WORLDS CONTAIN SPACES
Real vs. Virtual Architecture
Alexander’s “deep fundamentals” perspective on architecture is useful, but it is also 
useful to look in detail at some of the peculiarities special to virtual architecture. 
When we study some of the spaces that have been made for popular videogames, 
they are often very strange. They have huge amounts of wasted space, weird and 
dangerous architectural features, and no real relationship with their outside envi­
ronment, and sometimes areas even overlap with themselves in physically impos­
sible ways.
These sorts of bizarre building constructs would be considered madness by 
real-world architects. Look at those weird hollow spaces and all that water. So 
why is it that when we play videogames, we don’t notice how strange the building 
layouts are?
It is because the human mind is very weak when it comes to translating 3D 
spaces into 2D maps. If you don’t believe me, think of a familiar place, somewhere 
you go all the time like your home, school, or workplace, and try to draw a map 
of it. Most people find this quite difficult—this simply isn’t how we store spaces in 
our minds—we think of them relatively, not absolutely. We know which doors go to 
which rooms, but as for what is behind a wall with no doors, we aren’t always quite 
F I G U R E
21.2
No one would build this in the real world.

377
Real vs. Virtual Architecture
sure. For that reason, it is not important that 3D spaces have realistic 2D blueprints. 
All that matters is how the space feels when the player is in it.
Know How Big
When we are in real spaces, a sense of scale comes naturally to us, because we have 
so many cues—lighting, shadows, textures, stereo vision, and, most importantly, 
the presence of our own bodies. But in virtual spaces, scale is not always so clear. 
Because so many real-world cues are missing, it is very easy to create a virtual 
space that is really much bigger or smaller than it looks. This can be very confusing 
and disorienting for players. I frequently have conversation with students and other 
novice world builders that go something like this:
Virtual Architect: My world looks funny… but I don’t know why…
Me: Well, things seem out of scale—that car is too big for the street, and 
those windows are too small for that building. How big is that car, 
anyway?
Virtual Architect: I don’t know… Maybe five units?
Me: So how big is a unit?
Virtual Architect: I don’t know. It’s all virtual… why does it matter?
And in one sense, he’s right—as long as everything in your world is in proper 
proportion, your virtual units could be feet, meters, cubits, or smurf hats, and it 
doesn’t matter. But the moment that anything is out of scale, or you suspect it might 
be out of scale, it becomes a very important question, because then you have to relate 
things back to the real world. For this reason, it is wise to make your game units 
something that you are intimately familiar with in the real world—for most people, 
feet or meters. This will save a lot of time and confusion, because if your units are 
feet, and your car is thirty units long, you will quickly know what the problem is.
But sometimes the elements of your world are properly proportioned, but to 
the players, things look out of scale. The typical culprits in this case include the 
following:
●
●
Eye height: If you have a first-person game with the virtual camera very high 
(more than seven feet off the ground) or very low (less than five feet off the 
ground), it will distort the view of the world, since people tend to assume an eye 
height similar to their own.
●
●
People and doorways: Two of the strongest cues for scale are people and door­
ways (which of course, are designed to accommodate people). If you have a 
world of giants or little people, it can confuse the player about scale; similarly, if 
you have decided that doorways are very large or very small in your game, that 

378
CHAPTER Twenty-One • WORLDS CONTAIN SPACES
can be similarly confusing. If you have no people, doorways, or other commonly 
sized man-made objects, players often can get a little confused about scale.
●
●
Texture scaling: An easy error to make when designing a world is to have tex­
tures that are not at the proper scale, such as a brick texture on the wall that is 
too large or a floor tile texture that is too small. Be sure that the textures you use 
match the scale of textures in the real world.
Third-Person Distortion
There is another special peculiarity of designing virtual spaces. Each of us has 
developed a natural sense of the relationship of how our bodies fit into the world 
that we see. When we play a third-person videogame, where we can see our body, 
our brain does an amazing thing; it somehow lets us be in two places at once—in 
the body of our character, but also floating eight feet behind our body—all the 
while letting this strange perspective feel very natural. And while we get tremen­
dous benefits from being able to see our virtual body in a game, something very 
odd happens to our sense of proportion. In wide-open outdoor scenes, we mostly 
don’t notice this. But when we try to control a character who is in a normal-sized 
interior space, the space feels frustratingly crowded, like we are driving around 
a house in a car.
Weirdly, most players do not identify this as a problem with the third-person 
avatar system, but they think the room too small. Is there a way to distort the room 
so that when it is experienced in this peculiar perspective it looks normal?
F I G U R E
21.3
Te problem: A room that is too
crowded for a third person viewpoint

379
Real vs. Virtual Architecture
Solution 1: Scale up the room and the furniture. If you scale up all the walls and 
furniture, it does make more room to move around but gives a weird feeling of your 
avatar being tiny like a small child, as normal-sized objects like chairs and sofas 
become too big to sit on.
Solution 2: Scale up the room, but leave the furniture normal size. Now you have 
a cavernous room with furniture huddled together in lonely looking clusters.

Solution 3: Scale up the room, leave the furniture normal size, but spread the fur­
niture out. This works a little better—the room no longer seems such a cavern, but 
it leaves the room looking strangely sparse, with unnaturally large spaces between 
objects in the room.
Solution 4: Scale up the room, scale up the furniture a little bit, and spread the 
furniture out. This solution, pioneered by the designers of Max Payne, works very 
well. In a first-person view, this looks kind of strange, but in a third-person view, it 
does a very good job of counteracting the distortion caused by the eyepoint being 
far from the body.

Other Reading to Consider
Level Design
We’re nearly at the end of this chapter, and we haven’t yet talked about level design. 
Or have we? In truth, we have been covering it all along! Not just in this chapter, but 
through the entire book. All a level designer does is arrange the architecture, props, 
and challenges in a game in ways that are fun and interesting—that is, making sure 
there is the right level of challenge, the right amount of reward, the right amount of 
meaningful choice, and all the other things that make a good game. Level design is 
just game design exercised in detail—and it isn’t easy, for the devil is in the details. 
Level design is different for every game, because every game is different. But if you 
use everything you know about game design when you design your level, exam­
ining it carefully through many lenses, the best level design choices will start to 
become clear.

Doctor, you say that there are no haloes

and what I see is an aberration
caused by old age, an affliction.
I tell you it has taken me all my life
to arrive at the vision of gas lamps as angels,
to soften and blur and finally banish
the edges you regret I don’t see,
to learn that the line I called the horizon
does not exist and sky and water,
so long apart, are the same state of being.

What can I say to convince you
the Houses of Parliament dissolve
night after night to become
the fluid dream of the Thames?
I will not return to a universe
of objects that don’t know each other,
as if islands were not the lost children
of one great continent. The world
is flux, and light becomes what it touches,
becomes water, lilies on water,
above and below water,
becomes lilac and mauve and yellow
and white and cerulean lamps,

The Value of Aesthetics
Aesthetics is the third quadrant of the elemental tetrad. Some game designers 
have disdain for aesthetic considerations in a game, calling them mere “surface 
details” that have nothing to do with what they consider important—the game 
mechanics. But we must always remember that we are not designing just game 
mechanics, but an entire experience. And aesthetic considerations are part of 
making any experience more enjoyable. Good artwork can do wondrous things 
for a game:
●
●
It can draw the player into a game they might have passed over.
●
●
It can make the game world feel solid, real, and magnificent, which makes the 
player take the game more seriously and increases endogenous value. Consider 
the axis and allies story in the “pleasure of sensation” section in Chapter 9, 
“Player.”
●
●
Aesthetic pleasure is no small thing. If your game is full of beautiful artwork, 
then every new thing that the player gets to see is a reward in itself.
●
●
Powerful game worlds have a certain “atmosphere.” It can be hard to describe 
what that is, exactly, but it is created by the way the visuals, sounds, music, and 
game mechanics all work together.
●
●
Just as the world often ignores character flaws in a beautiful woman or a hand­
some man, players are more likely to tolerate imperfections in your design if your 
game has a beautiful surface.
You already have many of the tools you need to evaluate aesthetics in your game. 
Obviously, Lens #71, Beauty is useful, but you can also improve and integrate your 
aesthetics by using these other lenses in a new way. Stop for a moment, and con­
sider how you might use each of these lenses not to observe the mechanics of your 
game, but the artwork in your game.

Learning to See
Learning to See
It makes sense to view your game artwork through many lenses, because the key 
to creating great artwork is in your ability to see. Not just to see a salt shaker and 
say “that’s a salt shaker,” but to really see it—see its shapes, colors, proportions, 
shadows, reflections, and textures—to see its relationship to its environment and to 
the people who use it, and to see its function, and to see its meaning. This kind of 
deep seeing is a visual equivalent of the deep listening we discussed at the begin­

Atmosphere is invisible and intangible. But somehow it envelops us, perme­
ates us, and makes us part of the world. To make sure the atmosphere of your 
world is properly intoxicating, ask yourself these questions:
●
●
Without using words, how can I describe the atmosphere of my game?
●
●
How can I use artistic content (both visual and audible) to deepen that 
atmosphere?

CHAPTER Twenty-Two • THE LOOK AND FEEL OF A WORLD IS DEFINED BY ITS AESTHETICS
It is amazing how difficult it can be to actually see things as they really are. The 
reason for this is efficiency—if we just stared in awe at everything we saw, taking 
in every little visual and audible detail, our minds would be so absorbed we would 
never get anything done. So, for efficiency, our brains, at a low level, categorize 
things before they enter our consciousness. We see a salt shaker or a dog, and our 
left brain just slaps a label on it, because it is easier to think about a label than to 
actually deeply see the thing itself in all its detail and uniqueness. When you are 
looking at and thinking about artwork in your game, you must learn to get your 
left brain to take a little break and let your right brain come out and play, for the 
right brain is able to see details that the left brain cannot. Betty Edwards’ excellent 
book, Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain, is a marvelous text on this subject 
that is designed to teach anyone to draw by teaching them how to see. This is a 
fascinating virtuous circle—really seeing helps you draw properly, and drawing 
helps you see properly.
How to Let Aesthetics Guide Your Design
Some people mistakenly believe that it doesn’t make sense to get artists involved 
in a game project until the game design is near completion. But our minds are very 
visual, and it is often the case that an illustration or pencil sketch can completely 
change the course of a design, because the way a game looks in your mind’s eye is 
often very different from the way it looks when it is drawn on paper. Sometimes, 
an inspiring piece of concept art can provide the uniting vision of the experience a 
game is trying to achieve. Other times, an illustration can make clear whether an 
interface idea is possible or not. And occasionally, a little doodle done as a joke to 
poke fun at a design suddenly proves to become the central theme of a game. Game 
designs are abstract—illustrations are concrete. In the painful process of converting 
your abstract design into a concrete game, illustrations can serve as a simple, effec­
tive way to ground your design in reality at the very start of a project.
If you have some artistic skill, it can be a great boon to you as a game designer—
because you can sketch, people will think your creative vision is as clear in your 
mind as it is on the paper. More than that, it might make you famous. There are 
only two categories of famous game designers: first, ones who design “god games,” 
such as Will Wright, Peter Molyneux, and Sid Meier, presumably because it is easy 
to imagine a designer of a world as its god; and second, ones who have a very 
distinct visual style, such as Shigeru Miyamoto and American McGee. So, if you 
have a distinct and appealing art style, you should seriously consider basing your 
games around it.
But what if (like me) artistic talents do not come naturally to you? What if you 
have neither the major nor minor gift when it comes to drawing? In this case, the 
best thing you can do is to find an artistic partner. For if you can find a talented 
artist with whom you communicate well, your nebulous idea can become a concrete 
vision very quickly. Partnerships like this can be golden, for a pretty picture is nice 

389
How Much Is Enough?
for a moment and a good idea is nice in theory, but a well-rendered image of a good 
idea is compelling in a way that few people can resist. Strong game designs that 
have good concept art will
●
●
Make your idea clear to everyone (you didn’t think anyone would actually read 
your design document, did you?)
●
●
Let people see, and imagine entering, your game world
●
●
Make people excited about playing your game
●
●
Make people excited about working on your game
●
●
Allow you to secure funding and other resources to develop your game
Now, you might think that the idea of having some detailed art at the beginning 
of a project goes against the idea of rapid prototyping, where often the game ele­
ments are completely abstract. But it isn’t so—an illustration is just another kind of 
prototype. It is almost like riding a seesaw—the abstract prototype gives you ideas 
for how the game should look, which drives you to make more concept art, and the 
concept art can give you ideas for how the game should play, which drives you to 
make new abstract prototypes. If you keep cycling this way, eventually you will 
arrive at a beautiful game that is fun to play and in which the artwork and game­
play complement each other perfectly, because they grew up together.
How Much Is Enough?
But this raises an important question—What is the right amount of detail for your 
concept art? Most artists want to make everything they do look absolutely gor­
geous—but beautiful art takes time, and sometimes rough sketches or rough mod­
els are enough to do the job. Young artists, especially, are afraid of doing rough 
sketches and showing them, for they fear that the rough quality will make people 
misjudge their talent. Creating sketches that are simple, rough, and useful is a valu­
able skill that must be practiced.
But of course, there are other times when only gorgeous full-color renderings 
will do to show the true feel of the game. One artist I used to work with had a great 
trick—he would create rough pencil sketches that were large and elaborate, then 
pick one key element of the picture, and render it with full color, clean lines, and 
nice shading. This was a marvelous balance—the viewer could see the scope and 
complexity of what he was presenting but also the quality of finished detail. The 
viewer could easily imagine what the whole image would look like if it were fin­
ished to the level of detail of that one key element.
Even in your finished product, you need to be judicious about where to put 
detail, for a few details in the right places can make your game world seem far 
larger and richer than it is. John Hench, one of the great Disney Imagineers, would 
often say that anyone can make things look good from far away—it’s making them 

390
CHAPTER Twenty-Two • THE LOOK AND FEEL OF A WORLD IS DEFINED BY ITS AESTHETICS
also look good close up that is hard. An example is Cinderella’s castle at Disney 
World. People see it from a distance and are drawn to it because it is so beautiful. 
If when they got close they found it was crudely painted fiberglass, they would be 
filled with disappointment. Instead, they find that close up it has gorgeous mosa­
ics and beautiful stone crafting, which exceeds their expectations, making it seem 
deep, beautiful, and real.
J.R.R. Tolkien’s worlds are famous for being deep and rich—one way he achieves 
this is through a trick he referred to as “distant mountains.” Throughout his books, 
he gives names to distant places, people, and events that are never actually encoun­
tered in the book. The names and brief descriptions make it seem like the world is 
larger and richer than it is. When fans would ask him why he didn’t add more detail 
about these things, he would reply that he could tell them all about the distant 
mountains, but if he did that, he’d need to create more distant mountains for those 
distant mountains.
Use Audio
It is very easy to fall into the trap of only thinking of visual art when you think 
about the aesthetics of your game. But audio can be incredibly powerful. Audio 
feedback is much more visceral than visual feedback and more easily simulates 
touch. A study was once performed where two groups of players were asked to rate 
the graphics of a game and only the graphics. Both players played the same game 
but for one difference: the first group had low-quality audio, and the second group 
had high-quality audio. Surprisingly, though the graphics were identical for both 
games, the “high-quality audio” group rated the graphics of the game more highly 
than the “low-quality audio” group.
One serious error that game developers often fall into is to not add music or 
sound to their game until the very end. The Kyle Gabler technique mentioned in 
Chapter 7, “Idea,” bears repeating here. Choose music for your game at the very 
beginning of your process, as early as possible—possibly before you even know 
what the game is! If you are able to choose a piece of music that feels the way you 
want your game to play, you have already efficiently made a great many subcon­
scious decisions about what you want your game to feel like, or in other words, its 
atmosphere. Like a theme, the music can channel the design of your game—if you 
ever find that part of your game is conflicting with the music that you feel is so 
right, it is a good indication that part of the game should change.
Balancing Art and Technology
The tight integration of art and technology in modern videogames makes for some 
very challenging design problems. The artists are simultaneously empowered by 
and restrained by technology, and the engineers are similarly empowered and 

391
Other Reading to Consider
restrained by art. So much of the art in games seems high tech that it is tempting to 
just let the engineers loose to create the artistic vision of the game—something they 
are often all too ready to do. Don’t let this happen! Talented artists have trained for 
a lifetime to imagine and define glorious, integrated artistic visions. They see the 
world differently from the rest of us, as Lisel Mueller’s poem illustrated so vividly at 
the start of this chapter. Whenever possible, let them drive the aesthetic bus. Am I 
saying you should ignore the engineers’ aesthetic participation? By no means! Make 
the engineers the navigators and mechanics—let them recommend new routes and 
shortcuts and let them soup up the bus, but let the artists decide the destination 
and let their talented hands steer the way to a beautiful game. Don’t just let the 
engineers include whatever shadow algorithm is the flavor of the month—instead, 
let the artists draw and paint the kind of shadows and textures they would want to 
see and then challenge the engineers to match that vision.
One thing you should consider carefully is finding a technical artist for your 
team. This unusual individual has the eye of an artist and the mind of a computer 
programmer. A talented technical artist can build bridges between the art team and 
the engineering team by being able to fluently speak both of their languages and by 
helping to build tools that make the artists feel in command of the technology and 
the engineers feel in command of the art. This balance is not something to be taken 
lightly—when it is not right, it feels like your game is cracked down the middle, but 
when you achieve it, your game is gorgeous and powerful in ways your players will 
have never seen before.

CHAPTER Twenty-Three • SOME GAMES ARE PLAYED WITH OTHER PLAYERS
We Are Not Alone
It is well to remember that the entire universe, with one trifling exception, is 
composed of others.
—John Andrew Holmes
No one ever said on their deathbed, “Gee, I wish I had spent more time alone 
with my computer.”
—Dani Bunten Berry
Man is a social animal. Humans generally avoid being alone whenever possible. 
In most cases, we don’t like to eat alone, sleep alone, work alone, or play alone. 
Prisoners who behave badly are put in solitary confinement, because, although 
being trapped in a cage with a dangerous criminal is bad, being alone is worse.
And, if you look back over the centuries, the history of game design reflects this. 
The majority of all games created are designed to be played with other players or 
against other players. Before the advent of computers, solo games, such as solitaire, 
were rare.
So what happened with videogames? A tremendous number of them are single-
player experiences. But why? Is there something about the technology that makes 
us want to give up our natural human tendency to socialize? Of course not. In fact, 
the trends are clear—each year, more videogames have a multiplayer or community 
component of some kind. The explosion of Facebook games and asynchronously 
social mobile games is a massive blossoming of human nature. The single-player 
phenomenon appears to have been a temporary abnormality, born partly because of 
the novelty of single-player interactive worlds and partly because of the technologi­
cal limitations of game software and hardware. Now that more and more game plat­
forms are going online and becoming connected, it is becoming the case that games 
not featuring a multiplayer component are once again becoming the rare case. The 
more technology advances and technological novelty wears off, the more electronic 
games start to fit the ancient social molds humans have had for thousands of years.
Does this mean that a day will come when there are no single-player games? 
Certainly not. There are plenty of times that humans do want to be alone for a 
time—reading books, exercising, meditating, and doing crossword puzzles are all 
delightful solitary pleasures, and videogames have elements in common with all of 
these. But humans tend to spend more time social than solitary, and in the long run, 
games will do the same.
Why We Play with Others
Every person is a half-open door, leading to a room for everyone.
—Tomas Transtomer

395
Why We Play with Others
Clearly, playing with other people is natural and, in fact, the preferred way for us to 
play games. But why? In this book so far, we have discussed dozens of reasons people 
play games: for pleasure, for challenge, for judgment, for rewards, for flow, for tran­
scendence, and many more. Although some of those are enhanced by the presence of 
other players, none of them require that presence. What is it that we specifically seek 
when playing games with other people? There seem to be five main reasons:
	1.	 Competition: When we think of multiplayer games, competition is usually the 
first thing that comes to mind—and for good reason. It simultaneously fills sev­
eral kinds of needs and desires for us. All at once, it
	
a.	 Allows for a balanced game on a level playing field (Lens #37, Fairness)
	
b.	 Provides us with a worthy opponent (Lens #38, Challenge and Lens #43, 
Competition)
	
c.	 Gives us an interesting problem to solve (Lens #8, Problem Solving)
	
d.	 Fulfills a deep inner need to determine our skill level relative to someone else 
in our social circle (Lens #25, Judgment and Lens #90, Status)
	
e.	 Allows for games involving complex strategy, choices, and psychology, all 
possible because of the intelligence and skill of our human opponent (Lens 
#39, Meaningful Choice, Lens #34, Skill, and Lens #79, Freedom)
	2.	 Collaboration: The opposite of competition, this is the “other way” we like to 
play together. Collaborative games are enjoyable to us because they
	
a.	 Allow us to partake in game actions and employ game strategies that are 
impossible with just one person (e.g., one-on-one baseball makes almost no 
sense)
	
b.	 Let us enjoy the (presumably evolved) deep pleasures that come from group 
problem solving and being part of a successful team
And while some people think of collaborative games as experimental, that 
is only the case when players are collaborating against an automated opponent. 
Most collaborative games follow the mold of team sports, which allow all the 
pleasures of collaboration and the pleasures of competition at the same time.
	3.	 Meeting up: We like to get together with our friends, but it can be socially awk­
ward to just show up and be forced to make conversation on a regular basis. 
Games, like food, give us a convenient reason to be together, give us something 
to share, and give us something to focus on that won’t make anyone in the room 
uncomfortable. Games are a great way for kids and parents to spend time with 
each other, and many are the friendships held together by a weekly game of 
chess, golf, tennis, bridge, bingo, basketball, or more recently League of Legends, 
Call of Duty, or Words with Friends.
	4.	 Exploring our friends: And while it is great to have an excuse to meet up with 
our friends, games let us do something else that we can’t do so easily with just 

396
CHAPTER Twenty-Three • SOME GAMES ARE PLAYED WITH OTHER PLAYERS
conversation—explore the minds and souls of our friends. In a conversation, we 
hear a friend’s opinions about likes and dislikes and their stories about the way 
they and other people have behaved. But these things are all filtered through the 
friend’s conception of what they think we want to hear. When we play a game 
with them, however, we get a glimpse of something more like the unvarnished 
truth. We get to see them solving problems. We get to see them making tough 
decisions under stress. We get to see them make decisions about when to cut 
someone a break and when to stab them in the back. We learn who we can trust 
and who we can’t. As Plato purportedly said, “You can learn more about a man 
in an hour of play than a year of conversation.”
	5.	 Exploring ourselves: Alone, games let us test the limits of our abilities, finding 
out what we enjoy and learning what we want to improve at. But when we are 
with others, we get to explore how we will behave in complex social situations, 
under stress. Do we have a tendency to let our friends win when they have a 
bad day, or to crush them unconditionally? Who do we prefer to team with, 
and why? How do we feel when publicly defeated, and how do we cope with 
that? How do our strategies differ from others, and why? Who do we choose to 
imitate, or find ourselves imitating? All these questions, and many others, are 
explored when we play games with other people. These are not trivial things—
they are important things, close to the heart of how we see ourselves and how 
we relate to other people.
And it is worth noting that for some of these it isn’t even necessary for everyone 
to play. There can be a good social connection just watching someone else play a 
game. For that reason, it becomes very important to think about how you design 
for spectators. In a venue like the hearth (living room), this is particularly impor­
tant, because there are likely to be others around who would rather be watch­
ing television. If you can make your game such a compelling spectacle that they’d 
rather watch than laughing, kibbutzing, and helping the players solve hard prob­
lems, you’ve done something really worthwhile. Further, more and more people are 
watching gameplay remotely through streamed videos. This is an easy perspective 
to forget, so let’s be sure to add it to our collection.
Lens #95: The Lens of Spectation
For thousands of years, man has loved to sit and watch others play games—
but only if the games are worth watching. To make your game spectator wor­
thy, ask yourself these questions:
●
●
Is my game interesting to watch? Why or why not?
●
●
How can I make it more interesting to watch?

397
Other Reading to Consider
Although multiplayer gameplay is important, you must employ it carefully and 
wisely, because it can be a lot of work and hard to control. Generally, it is safe to 
assume that a multiplayer online game will take four times the effort and expense 
to create compared to a similar single-player game. This is because multiplayer 
games are much more difficult to debug and to balance. The payoffs can be worth 
it, though—if the reasons for having the multiplayer gameplay are clear and certain. 
If the reason to add it is “because multiplay is cool,” you should probably think it 
through a little more.
There are many different, powerful reasons that we like to play games with other 
people. One additional reason, more powerful than the ones listed here, is the topic 
of our next chapter.

CHAPTER Twenty-Four • OTHER PLAYERS SOMETIMES FORM COMMUNITIES
More than Just Other Players
Games are something that inspires real passion in players, so it is not surprising 
that frequently, communities arise around games. These can be communities of 
fans, as in professional sports, or communities of players, as in World of Warcraft, 
or communities of designers, as in Minecraft and Little Big Planet. These commu­
nities can be very powerful forces, extending the life of a game by many years by 
constantly drawing in new players.
But what is a community, really? The answer is not so simple. It is not merely a 
group of people who know each other or who do the same thing. You might ride the 
train with the same people every day but never feel a sense of community in doing 
so. But you might feel a sense of community with total strangers who are fans of 
the same esoteric TV series that you love. There is a special feeling that goes with 
being part of a community. It is hard to describe, but we know it when we feel it. 
Two psychologists who set out to better understand this sense of community found 
that it has four primary elements:
	1.	 Membership: Something distinct makes it clear you are part of this group.
	2.	 Influence: Being part of this group gives you power over something.
	3.	 Integration and fulfillment of needs: Being part of this group does something 
for you.
	4.	 Shared emotional connection: You have some guarantee of sharing emotions 
about certain events with others in the group.
And while these four are unquestionably important aspects of community, I find I 
sometimes prefer designer Amy Jo Kim’s succinct definition of community: a group 
of people with a shared interest, purpose, or goal who get to know each other better 
over time.
But why, as a game designer, do you want communities to form around your 
game? There are three main reasons:
	1.	 Being part of a community fills a social need: People need to feel a part of 
something, and as Lens #22, Needs, shows us, social needs are very powerful.
	2.	 Longer “period of contagion”: The personal recommendation of a friend is the 
most influential factor when purchasing a game. Game designer Will Wright 
once pointed out that if we truly believe that interest in a game spreads like a 
virus, it makes sense to study epidemiology. And one thing that we know from 
epidemiology is that when the period of contagion doubles, the number of people 
who catch the disease can increase by ten times. “Catching the disease” in our 
case means buying the game. But what does “period of contagion” for a game 
mean? It is the time when a player is so excited about a game that they are talk­
ing about it constantly with everyone they know. Players who become part of a 
game community are likely to “stay contagious” for a long time, as the game will 

401

become a deeper part of their lives, giving them a lot to talk about. Will was, as 
usual, ahead of the curve, as virality is now seen as a key component for success 
in social and mobile games.
	3.	 More hours of play: It is often the case that players start to play a game for the 
game’s pleasures but stay with it over a long period for the community’s pleasures. 
I took a mountain vacation with a friend and his extended family once, and on 
the way there, he told me about a card game that his family loved playing. That 
evening, after dinner, the whole clan gathered around a big table to play, and I 
was quite eager to learn what it was about this unfamiliar game that they liked so 
well. They explained the rules, which were mind bogglingly simple—they basi­
cally consisted of passing cards to the right until all the cards were sorted in order. 
There were few decisions to make, and almost no skill whatever was required. 
Sometimes, it was hard even to say who won. I was incredibly disappointed, but 
as I looked around the table, I was the only one. Everyone else was talking, joking, 
and laughing as they played—and suddenly I realized that it didn’t matter that the 
game wasn’t perfect—what mattered was that it held them at the table and let them 
enjoy each other’s company, keeping their hands busy but their minds free. A game 
that has the ability to engender community will get played for a long, long time, 
no matter how lacking its other qualities might be. If the financial success of your 
game relies on subscription renewals, selling sequels, or microtransactions, the fact 
that community makes people want to play it longer becomes very important.
Ten Tips for Strong Communities
Community is complex and involves many different interrelated psychological phe­
nomena, but there are some basic things you can do to help foster a community 
around your game.
Community Tip #1: Foster Friendships
The idea of online friendships seems simple. Just like real friendships, but online, 
right? But what do we really understand about the nature of friendship? And how 
can we translate it to a game environment? To have a meaningful online relation­
ship with another person requires three things:
	1.	 The ability to talk: This sounds obvious. But a surprising number of online 
games have been created that offer players no ability to talk to each other—the 
designers hoping that some kind of nonverbal communication would happen 
through play and that would be enough. It is not enough. For a community to 
form, players must be able to speak to each other freely.
	2.	 Someone worth talking to: You cannot assume that all your players will want 
to talk to each other, any more than you can assume that strangers on a bus will 

402
CHAPTER Twenty-Four • OTHER PLAYERS SOMETIMES FORM COMMUNITIES
mingle. The explosion of social media has shown us that most people are mainly 
interested in connecting with (1) their friends and (2) celebrities. You must have 
a clear understanding of who your players want to talk to and why. This varies a 
great deal depending on your demographics. Adults often want to talk to others 
who can relate to their problems. Teenagers often seek members of the opposite 
sex or other people more interesting than their regular friends. And children 
generally have little interest in strangers—they would prefer to socialize with 
friends from real life. But understanding these age-based generalizations is not 
enough—you must understand the types of socialization that are specific to your 
game. Do your players seek competitors? Collaborators? Assistants? Quick chats 
or long-term relationships? If players can’t find the people they are interested in 
talking to, they will quickly drift away.
	3.	 Something worth talking about: The first two items could be satisfied by a good 
chat room. Games that foster community give the players a steady stream of 
things to talk about. This can come from the gameplay itself (games like Words 
with Friends and Draw Something have different content every time you play), 
depth of strategy inherent in the game (e.g., strategy discussion is a prime topic 
for chess communities) or from events, or rule changes that are introduced over 
time (typical topics of conversation in MMOs and CCGs). It is common to hear 
people say that “good online games are more community than game,” but this 
isn’t really true. Good online games must have a solid balance of community 
and game. If the game isn’t interesting enough, the community doesn’t have 
anything to talk about. On the other hand, if the community support for your 
game isn’t good enough, players will enjoy the game, but eventually wander off.
Plenty of games are designed to just be played with your friends. But what about 
making new friends in your game? Friendships have three distinct phases, and your 
game must also have good support for each of them if you want friendships to blos­
som and survive:
●
●
Friendship phase 1: Breaking the ice. Before two people can become friends, 
they first must meet. Meeting people for the first time is awkward. Ideally, your 
game will have a way that people can easily find the kind of people they might 
like to be friends with and then have some way to engage with them that is low 
in social pressure but allows them to express themselves a little, so others can 
see what they are like.
●
●
Friendship phase 2: Becoming friends. The moment when two people “become 
friends” is mysterious and subtle—but it almost always involves conversation 
about something both of them care about. And in games, that conversation is 
often about a gameplay experience the two friends just shared. Giving players 
opportunities to chat with each other after an intense play experience is one of 
the best ways to encourage the formation of friendships. It can be a good idea to 
create a friend-making ritual in your game, such as inviting another player to be 
on your “friends list.”

403
Ten Tips for Strong Communities
●
●
Friendship phase 3: Staying friends. Meeting people and making friends is one 
thing—staying friends is another. To stay friends with someone, you must be 
able to find them again to continue your friendship. In the real world, this is 
mostly up to the friends, but in online games, you need to give people some way 
they can find each other again. This might be through friends’ lists, or guilds, or 
even through memorable nicknames. Whatever works! But you have to do some­
thing, or your game misses out on the power of friendship, which is the glue that 
holds communities together.
Do keep in mind that different people are interested in different kinds of friend­
ships. Adults are often most interested in making friends with similar interests, while 
kids are more interested in playing games with their real-life friends. Friendship is so 
crucial to community, and to gameplaying in general, that it deserves its own lens.
Community Tip #2: Put Conflict at the Heart
Online game pioneer Jonathan Baron makes the point that conflict is at the heart 
of all communities. A sports team becomes a strong community because they have 
conflict with other teams. A parent/teacher association becomes a community 
when they are fighting for better schools. A group of vintage car fanatics become 
a community in their shared battle against entropy. Fortunately for us, conflict is 
a natural part of games. But not all game conflict results in community. The con­
flict in solitaire, for example, doesn’t do much to create a community. The conflict 
in your game must either spur players to demonstrate that they are better than 
everyone else (conflict against other players) or be the kind of conflict that is more 
likely to be resolved when people work together (conflict against the game). Many 
games build community on both of these kinds of conflict: collectible card games, 
for example, are all about being the very best player in your community, but their 
Lens #96: The Lens of Friendship
People love to play games with friends. To make sure your game has the right 
qualities to let people make and keep friendships, ask yourself these questions:
●
●
 What kind of friendships are my players looking for?
●
●
 How do my players break the ice?

strategies are so complex that players spend a lot of time sharing and discussing 
strategies. Similarly, Minecraft is about working together to build things but also 
about being the best player in the community.
Community Tip #3: Use Architecture to Shape Your Community
In some neighborhoods, people don’t really know their neighbors. In others, every­
one knows everyone else, and the whole neighborhood has a sense of community. 
Is this because the people are different? No. It is usually a side effect of how the 
neighborhoods are designed. Neighborhoods that are designed to be walkable (and 
with meaningful destinations to walk to) give neighbors a chance to communicate. 
And neighborhoods with a lot of dead-end streets tend not to have a lot of through 
traffic, so that when you see someone passing by, there is a good chance you will 
know them. In other words, there are frequent opportunities to see and talk with 
the same people over and over again. Online worlds can support these same design 
features, partly through buddy lists and guilds, but partly by creating places where 
people are likely to see each other again and again and still have time to talk. Many 
MMOs have areas where people tend to casually congregate and chat—these areas 
are often at a place where many players pass by regularly on their way to some 
important game business.
Community Tip #4: Create Community Property
When you can create things in your game that are not just owned by an individual 
player but by several, it can really encourage players to band together. Perhaps, for 
example, no individual player can afford to buy a ship in your game, but a group 
could team up and own it together. This group practically becomes an instant com­
munity, since they have to communicate frequently and be friendly to each other. 
The tremendous success of Eve Online is largely based on community property. The 
property you create doesn’t need to be so tangible—a guild’s status, for example, is 
a type of community property.
Community Tip #5: Let Players Express Themselves
Self-expression is very important in any multiplayer game. And while it is certainly 
true that players can express themselves through their gameplay strategies and 
styles of play, why stop there? You are, after all, creating a fantasy world where 
players can be whatever they would like to: why not let them express that? Rich, 
expressive avatar creation systems are much beloved by players of online games. So 
are systems of conversation that allow players to convey emotion or choose colors 
and styles for their text to display. The purchase of “vanity items” in online games is 
a key part of monetization for games ranging from World of Warcraft to Temple Run.

405
Ten Tips for Strong Communities
Player expression is not limited to online games—consider the expressive power 
in Charades or Pictionary. Game designer Shawn Patton once created a board game 
all about being a kid trying to have fun without getting dirty. Whenever you got 
dirty, you had to color your dirt onto your character card. Players had great fun 
making up stories about how they got dirty and coloring their characters to match 
the story. Even Monopoly allows the players expression—although it is for only 2–8 
players, the game has 12 different playing pieces, because it is an easy way to make 
sure players get a chance to express themselves.
Self-expression is extremely important but easily overlooked. Keep this lens so 
you remember to let players express themselves.
Community Tip #6: Support Three Levels
It is important to realize that when designing a game community, you are really 
designing three separate games for players at different levels of experience. Some 
might argue there are even more, but there are at the minimum these three:
	1.	 Level 1: The newbie. Players who are new to game communities are often over­
whelmed. They aren’t yet challenged by the game itself—they are challenged 
just by learning to play the game. In a sense, learning to play the game is the 
game for them—and so you are obligated to design that learning process so that 
it is as rewarding as possible. If you don’t, newbies will give up on the game 
before they really get into it, and you will significantly limit your audience. One 
of the best ways to make newbies feel rewarded and connected to the game is to 
create situations where they get to interact meaningfully with more experienced 
players. Some experienced players like greeting and teaching newbies for their 
own enjoyment, but if not enough of your players tend to do this, then why 
not give in-game rewards for helping newbies? An online version of Battletech 
did this indirectly in an interesting way—experienced players took the role of 
Lens #97: The Lens of Expression
When players get a chance to express themselves, it makes them feel alive, 
proud, important, and connected. To use this lens, ask yourself these questions:
●
●
How am I letting players express themselves?
●
●
What ways am I forgetting?
●
●
Are players proud of their identity? Why or why not?
This lens is important and overdue. It works very well in combination with 
other lenses, such as Lens #71, Beauty, and Lens #90, Status.

406
CHAPTER Twenty-Four • OTHER PLAYERS SOMETIMES FORM COMMUNITIES
generals and had to recruit their own armies. Newbies were honored to be asked 
and further honored to be placed right where the action is—on the front line, 
a place more experienced players learned to avoid. Even though the newbies 
would generally get slaughtered, it was win-win, in a way—the generals got lots 
of “cannon fodder,” and the new players got a taste of the action right away.
	2.	 Level 2: The player. The player is past the newbie stage. They completely under­
stand the game and are immersed in the game activities and in figuring out how 
to master them. Most of the design that goes into the game is aimed at this group.
	3.	 Level 3: The elder. For many games, particularly for any online game involving 
some kind of “leveling” system, there comes a point where the game itself is no 
longer interesting. Most of the secrets have been discovered, and many of the 
game pleasures have been squeezed dry. When players reach this state, they 
tend to leave, seeking a new game with new secrets. Some games, however, 
manage to retain these elder players by giving them an entirely different game 
to play—one that befits their level of skill, expertise, and devotion to the game. 
There is tremendous benefit to keeping elders around, since they are often some 
of the most vocal advertisers of your game and, further, they are experts about 
your game, often able to teach you how to improve it. Some typical “elder games” 
include the following:
	
a.	 A more difficult game: Often, particularly in MMOs, the middle game is 
about gradual, clear progression toward a goal: when the goal is reached, 
then what. Sometimes a different kind of game is presented to the higher-
level players, which is much more difficult—so difficult, in fact, that no one 
can ever consistently master it. In Toontown Online, “Cog Headquarters” 
areas that featured a new, platform-based gameplay and new battle system 
served this purpose. Some games let you rise in the ranks from soldier to 
general. Other games change from pitting you against the computer to pit­
ting you against the other players. There are many ways to add a more diffi­
cult game—but you are always left with the question: what to do when elders 
get tired of it?
	
b.	 Governance privileges: Some games give the elder players special levels of 
responsibility, such as deciding the rules of the game. Many MUDs gave elder 
players these kinds of powers. It is a great way to keep the elders involved 
and make them feel special, although you run some risk if you hand them 
too much control. Collectible card communities often have formal systems 
where experienced players can take tests to become official judges at game 
tournaments.
	
c.	 The joy of creation: Players who truly love a game often fantasize about 
extending it in new ways, particularly when they have grown tired of it. So, 
why not let them? Games like The Sims and Skyrim have built strong com­
munities by letting players create and share their own content. Many elders 
get to the point where they play the games only occasionally but spend most 

407
Ten Tips for Strong Communities
of their time creating new content. For them, the new game becomes one of 
status: can they become the most popular and respected designer?
	
d.	 Guild management: When players form groups, these groups often benefit 
from having organizers. Elders will often do this on their own, but if you give 
them a strong set of tools to help run their guild, the activity will be all the 
more appealing to them.
	
e.	 A chance to teach: Just as many experts in “real-world” activities enjoy a 
chance to teach, so do game experts. If you can give them both permission 
and encouragement to do so, some of them will enjoy serving as ambassa­
dors to the newbies and guides to the regular players. Some online games, 
such as Entropia Universe, give elders who would like to teach special status 
noting them as experts and teachers, which is something they are generally 
very proud of.
These three levels might sound like a lot of work, but really, they can often 
be implemented quite simply. Every year at Easter, for example, my neighborhood 
hosts an egg hunt for all the kids who live there. Quite naturally, they have found 
that it works best to have three levels of play:
●
●
Level 1—ages 2–5 (newbies): These kids hunt for eggs in a separate area from 
the older kids, so there is no concern about having to compete with them. All 
the eggs are placed in plain sight—not really hidden at all. For these preschool­
ers, though, just navigating the space, spotting the eggs, and picking them up 
are plenty of challenge. There are plenty of eggs and no pushy big kids to spoil 
the fun.
●
●
Level 2—ages 6–9 (players): These kids enjoy a standard egg hunt over a large 
area, with eggs hidden in places that are sometimes tricky. There are enough 
eggs for everyone, but kids still need to move fast and look carefully.
●
●
Level 3—ages 10–13 (elders): These older children are given the task of hiding 
the eggs. They are very proud of this job—they find it challenging and fun, feel 
honored with the responsibility, and enjoy the status it gives them, compared 
to the younger kids. They also often enjoy giving hints to the kids who are 
having trouble.
Community Tip #7: Force Players to Depend on Each Other
Conflict alone cannot create community. The conflict situation must be one where 
getting aid from other players will help resolve the conflict. Most videogame design­
ers have been conditioned to create games that are playable by a single player alone, 
even in a multiplayer game. The logic is something like “We don’t want to exclude 
players who would prefer to play alone.” And this is a valid concern. But when you 
create a game that can be mastered when playing solo, you diminish the value of 

408
CHAPTER Twenty-Four • OTHER PLAYERS SOMETIMES FORM COMMUNITIES
community. If, on the other hand, you create situations where players must commu­
nicate and interact to succeed, you give community real value. This often involves 
the counterintuitive step of taking something away from the players. The mobile 
game Spaceteam exemplifies this—each player has information vital to the mis­
sion that only others can act on—which guarantees constant communication. In 
Toontown Online, our team decided on an unusual rule: players cannot heal them­
selves during a battle—they can only heal other players. There was a great deal of 
concern that some players would find the rule frustrating, but after we implemented 
it, this did not seem to be the case. Instead, it achieved its objectives well. It forced 
people to communicate (“I need a Toon-up!”) and encouraged them to help each 
other. And really, people want to help each other—helping another person is a 
deeply satisfying feeling, even when it is just helping them win a videogame. But 
we are often shy about helping others, for fear we might insult them with our offer 
of help. But if you can create situations where players need each other’s help and 
can easily ask for it, others will quickly come to their aid, and your community will 
be the stronger for it.
Community Tip #8: Manage Your Community
If you believe that community is important to your game experience, you need to 
do more than just cross your fingers and hope it will happen. Now that games can 
be updated based on player feedback on an ongoing basis, players expect it. You 
need to create appropriate tools and systems to let your players communicate and 
organize, and you may need to have professional community managers who build 
and maintain a strong feedback loop between designers and players. Think of these 
managers like gardeners. They don’t create the communities directly, but they plant 
the seeds for them and encourage them to grow by observing and catering to their 
specific needs. This is a role of nurturing, listening, and encouraging, so not sur­
prisingly, many of the best community managers are female. Amy Jo Kim’s afore­
mentioned book, Community Building on the Web, has some excellent advice about 
how to carefully manage online communities by striking the right balance between 
a “hands-on” and “hands-off” approach.
Community Tip #9: Obligation to Others Is Powerful
In parts of aboriginal Australia, it is considered rude to give a gift unexpectedly, 
because doing so creates a burden to give a return gift. This may be a cultural 
extreme, but obligation to others is something deeply felt in all cultures. If you can 
create situations where players can make promises to each other (“Let’s meet up at 
10 p.m. Wednesday to fight some trolls”) or owe each other favors (“That healing 
spell saved my life! I owe you one!”), players will take them seriously. Many World 
of Warcraft players report that obligation to their guild is one of the strongest forces 

409
Ten Tips for Strong Communities
in getting them to play on a regular basis. This is partly because they want to enjoy 
high status in the guild, but often there is another reason—avoiding low status. 
Gifting was responsible for a huge part of the massively viral spread of Facebook 
games. As we’ve seen with Lens #25, Judgment, no one wants to be negatively 
judged by other players, and failing to live up to commitments is one of the quick­
est ways to make people think less of you. Carefully designed systems of player-
to-player commitment are an excellent way to get players to play your game on a 
regular basis and to help build strong community.
Community Tip #10: Create Community Events
Almost all successful communities are anchored by regular events. In the real 
world, these can be meetings, parties, competitions, practice sessions, or awards 
ceremonies. And in the virtual world, it’s pretty much the same. Events serve many 
purposes for a community:
●
●
They give players something to look forward to.
●
●
They create a shared experience, which makes players feel more connected to 
their community.
●
●
They punctuate time, giving players something to remember.
●
●
They are a guarantee of an opportunity to connect with others.
●
●
The knowledge that events are frequent makes players want to keep checking 
back to find out about which events are coming up.
Players will often create their own events, but why not create some of your own? 
With an online game, it can be as simple as creating a simple goal for players and 
sending a mass email.
Lens #98: The Lens of Community
To make sure your game fosters strong community, ask yourself these 
questions:
●
●
What conflict is at the heart of my community?
●
●
How does architecture shape my community?
●
●
Does my game support three levels of experience?
●
●
Are there community events?
●
●
Why do players need each other?

CHAPTER Twenty-Four • OTHER PLAYERS SOMETIMES FORM COMMUNITIES
The Challenge of Griefing
Griefing is one issue that any community-based game, particularly an online game, 
has to deal with eventually. For some players, the game itself isn’t as enjoyable as 
teasing, tricking, and torturing the other players. If you remember Bartle’s four-
player types matched to hearts, spades, diamonds, and clubs (Chapter 9, “Player”), 
the griefer would be the Joker.
Recalling Lens #90, Status, the griefer sees himself as higher status than the 
other players because of the power he can wield over them by spoiling a game that 
they care about and he doesn’t.
What can a game designer do about griefing? Some games have created “anti­
griefing policies” that ban griefers from the game—this is one way to handle the 
problem, but it creates the ugly situation of having to police griefing and then hav­
ing to maintain a “court of law” to decide which griefing was intentional abuse and 
which was just “fooling around.” A better idea is to avoid game systems that make 
griefing easy. These are the systems that are easiest for griefers to exploit:
●
●
Player vs. player combat: Some games, such as first-person shooters, make player 
vs. player (PvP) combat the heart of the game. But if you are making a game 
where PvP combat is not the core activity, you should think carefully about why 
you are supporting it. While it can be exciting, it can also make players feel con­
stantly threatened and never safe. A typical griefer trick in a game with no limits 
on PvP is to befriend a player, spending just enough time with them to build up 
some trust and then unexpectedly kill the player and steal their inventory. You 
could argue that this is “just part of the game,” but generally the griefers aren’t 
doing it for advantage in the game—they are doing it just for the enjoyment of 
torturing another human being. Ultimately, this creates an environment where 
players are afraid to talk to strangers—and what kind of community does that 
leave you with? If you really feel that PvP combat is an important part of your 
game, you should consider ways to confine it to special areas or circumstances, 
which makes it difficult to use it as a griefing opportunity.
●
●
Stealing: In many games, items give players a great deal of power. Any oppor­
tunity to rob others of this power is very attractive to griefers. This could be 
through pickpocketing or by “looting” a player after battling them. Being stolen 
from really makes a player feel violated, and as a result, griefers love doing it. 
Unless you are planning to make a game that is fun for griefers and frustrating 
for everyone else, you probably don’t want to support features that let players 
steal from each other. Of course, there are other kinds of stealing than just steal­
ing items. Some games have a problem with “kill stealing.” In the initial version 
of EverQuest, for example, only the player who dealt the final blow against an 
enemy would get any experience points for it. Griefers would make a habit of 
standing nearby a battle, waiting for a powerful monster to be nearly defeated, 
and then sneak in a killing blow, “stealing” all the experience. Again, few players 

411
The Challenge of Griefing
did this as a valid strategy, but many did it for the joy of griefing. Creating sys­
tems that make it difficult for players to seize things that are not rightfully theirs 
is one way to make griefing difficult.
●
●
Trading: If you give players the opportunity to trade items, you set up the pos­
sibility of unfair trades. If players have total information about the items they 
will receive, it is difficult to use the system for griefing. But if there is any way to 
misrepresent items that you are trying to trade, griefers will pounce and use it as 
an opportunity to make unfair trades.
●
●
Obscenities: One thing griefers enjoy is using shocking and disturbing language 
in front of other players. If you set up filters for this kind of language, it will 
become a game for griefers to find ways around your filtering system, and they 
almost always can, if you are using a “black list” (certain words are forbidden) 
or “white list” (only certain words are allowed), or any other kind of automated 
chat filter, because the human mind is so much better at detecting patterns than 
any machine. The most successful systems for stopping this kind of griefing are 
the ones that use an automated filter combined with a system that lets players 
report rude behavior. Voice chat makes this a much harder problem, but with 
the rise of voice recognition, it’s starting to happen. Amusingly, NBA 2K14 on 
Xbox One gives “technical fouls” when the microphone picks up spoken foul 
language. Another good technique to limit obscene griefing comes from using 
Lens #63, Feedback. Keeping in mind that obscenities are a game to the griefer, 
you can take the fun out of the game by giving them no feedback about whether 
the obscenity filter worked or not. Simply let them see the obscenity on their 
side, and filter the message appropriately to the other players. They can still find 
ways to beat this system, but it is much more work and much less fun.
●
●
Blocking the way: One of the simplest and most annoying griefing moves is to 
bar the way so that players can’t get where they are trying to go. Solutions to this 
problem range from making sure the collision system lets players slip past each 
other, to creating doorways wide enough that they cannot be blocked by a single 
player, to allowing players to push other players out of the way. In Toontown 
Online, we chose this last solution. But, even then, the griefers took advantage! 
Since players could push each other around, it became a popular prank to find 
an “abandoned avatar,” whose player had stepped away from the keyboard and 
push them slowly down the street and into a battle!
●
●
Loopholes: Possibly the griefer’s greatest joy is to find a loophole in a game sys­
tem that lets them do something that they shouldn’t be able to do. If griefers can 
disconnect during a battle to deny another player a valuable treasure, they will 
do it. If they can occasionally crash the server by jumping up and down in a cor­
ner for two hours, they will do it. If they can arrange furniture in a public place 
to spell obscene words, they will do it. And definitely if they find a way to steal 
resources, they will do it. Anything they can do to vandalize or annoy will make 
them feel powerful and important, particularly if other players don’t know how 

412
CHAPTER Twenty-Four • OTHER PLAYERS SOMETIMES FORM COMMUNITIES
to do it. You must be ever mindful of these loopholes and careful to remove them 
whenever they turn up. Dealing with problems like this is part of why making 
online multiplayer games is such an arduous process.
The Future of Game Communities
Game communities have been an important part of life on earth for centuries, 
mostly via sports teams, both professional and amateur. As we transition into the 
age of the Internet and social media, new kinds of game communities are becom­
ing ­important as well. In this new age, a person’s online identity becomes some­
thing important and intensely personal. Choosing an online handle and identity has 
become an important rite of passage for children and young teenagers. Most people 
who create these identities will retain them their entire lives. Most people who cre­
ated a handle twenty years ago still use the same one today and have no intention 
of changing it. Combine this with the fact that the most expressive online experi­
ence one can have is through multiplayer game worlds and one can easily imagine 
a future where players will create avatars for games as young children that become 
part of their personal and professional lives as they grow older. Just as people today 
often have lifelong allegiance to a particular sports team, perhaps the guilds play­
ers join as children will influence their personal social networks for the rest of their 
lives. And what will happen to these online identities and social networks when 
players die? Perhaps they will be memorialized in some kind of online mausoleum, 
or perhaps our avatars will outlive us and be passed on to children and grandchil­
dren, giving our future descendants a strange connection to their ancestors. It is 
an exciting time to be creating online games, for the new kinds of communities we 
invent may become permanent elements of human culture for centuries to come.

The Designer Usually 
Works with a Team
F I G U R E
25.1

414
CHAPTER Twenty-Five • THE DESIGNER USUALLY WORKS WITH A TEAM
The Secret of Successful Teamwork
To create a modern videogame, a team of tremendous diversity is required. You 
need a team of people with a wide variety of artistic, technical, design, and busi­
ness skills. They generally have very different backgrounds and value very different 
things. But if your game is going to be a great one, they will all have to pull together 
and set aside differences and disagreements to make the game as great as it can be.
And there is a simple secret shared by all teams that have ever successfully collab­
orated to make something great. It is so simple that when you hear it, you will likely 
think I’m not being serious. But this is the most serious thing I will say in this book.
The secret to successful teamwork is love.
No, really.
Now, by this, I don’t mean that if the team hold hands and sings “Kumbaya,” you 
are going to make a great game. I don’t even mean that you have to like the other 
people on the team, although it wouldn’t hurt.
What I mean is that you have to love the game you are making. For if everyone 
on the team has a deep and true love for the game they are making together and for 
the audience they are making it for, all differences and disagreements will be set 
aside in service of bringing the game into existence and making it be as wonderful 
as it can possibly be.
Developers lucky enough to have been on a team that truly loves the game they 
are making will know just what I mean. Everyone on the team feels like children 
anticipating Christmas when they think about the game getting finished and they 
think about that constantly.
Similarly, developers who have been on a team that had some kind of “love defi­
cit” will also know what I mean. There are three main kinds of problems when it 
comes to team love for their game:
●
●
Love problem #1: Team members incapable of loving any game. Though it is 
difficult to understand, some people get into the games business even though 
they have no particular love for games or the people who play them. When 
someone like this is on your team, it is like carrying deadweight. They often con­
tribute little of use and constantly waste time arguing with team members who 
actually love the work. Unfortunately, the team members in charge of manage­
ment or budget are most likely to have this affliction. Regardless, there is only 
one cure for a team member with this problem: get them off the team.
●
●
Love problem #2: Team members in love with a different game than the 
one they are making. This problem comes in many shapes and sizes: a level 
designer who only loves first-person shooters, forced to work on a role-playing 
game; an engineer who only loves games with cutting-edge graphics, forced to 

415
The Secret of Successful Teamwork
work on a simple web-based game; and an artist who loves the work of H. R. 
Giger, forced to develop a new game featuring the Care Bears. When you find 
members of your team have this problem, the key is to work with them, to see 
if there is something about the current game that they can fall in love with—or 
perhaps they have some idea for a new feature or element that will take the 
current game somewhere new and different. On the pirates game I mentioned 
in an earlier chapter, we ran into a love problem early on. The animators on 
the team were eagerly looking forward to animating exciting pirate characters 
for the game. But as the design proceeded, it became clear that this would be a 
game about ships—the only people in it would be far away and so tiny as to be 
incapable of any meaningful action or emotion. The animators tried to fight this 
for a while but gradually realized it was a losing battle, and they clearly began 
losing their love for the game discussing it in tones of quiet detachment. Several 
of us on the team saw this as a major problem—we needed the animators to 
put their heart and souls into making beautiful effects animations, but they 
seemed so disappointed they wouldn’t be able to animate characters, which 
didn’t seem possible. Then, in one meeting, everything changed. One of the 
animators brought a big sheaf of papers. “Look, I’ve been thinking about this 
game, and at first, I was really bummed that we cut all the characters, but then 
I started thinking the stars of this show are the ships—what could I do to make 
them cool?” He then proceeded to show pages and pages of sketches of how the 
ships would explode into pieces, how their masts would crack and break and 
crash into the sea, and how their sails would rip and tear and flap when hit with 
cannonballs—it was truly inspiring to everyone. Immediately, other animators 
were excitedly competing to see who could come up with the coolest effects. 
This shift in perspective turned a project they hated into one they loved, and it 
made a huge difference in game quality.
●
●
Love problem #3: Team members in love with different visions of the same 
game. This is the most common, and the most challenging, love problem. In this 
situation, a team is full of people passionate about building a game, but everyone 
has very different ideas about what the game will be like. The key to avoiding 
this problem is to get everyone on the same page about what the design is as 
soon as possible. There will be arguments and disagreements, but if everyone 
hears them out and respectfully considers the ideas that others present, the team 
can work toward that all important thing—a shared vision of something that all 
the team members love. But it can only happen with thorough communication 
and respect. The moment you sense that someone in a meeting doesn’t buy into 
an idea (even if they verbally claim they agree with it), you must stop every­
thing, find out why, and try to find a way to get them on board. If you don’t, they 
may secretly disagree with the direction and lose their love for the game. And 
when that happens, the valuable contributions they would have made are lost. 
No decision should be final until the team agrees that it is final.

416
CHAPTER Twenty-Five • THE DESIGNER USUALLY WORKS WITH A TEAM
If You Can’t Love the Game, Love the Audience
Getting others to love the game is part of your responsibility as a designer. But what 
about that terrible situation when, horror of horrors, you realize that you yourself do 
not love the game you are working on? Again, this is not something you can ignore 
or hope will remedy itself. Unless you find a way to love your game, the game you 
create will be mediocre at best, because the insincerity of your contribution will 
show through. So when your love for your game lapses, you must find a way to 
restore it. But how?
One way, as mentioned earlier, is to search long and hard for something in the 
game that you do love—perhaps it is a moment, or a clever mechanic, or a slick 
interface. If you can find just one thing that you are excited about and can be proud 
of, it can sometimes be enough to make the whole project worthwhile for you—
enough to make you love the game and work hard to make the game succeed.
But perhaps you can’t find that one thing to love, perhaps because you are not 
the target audience for the game. In that case, don’t think of it as a game for you—
think of it as what it really is, a game for the intended audience. Think of a time 
when you went through a great deal of preparation to give someone you love a 
special gift. Think how excited you were about seeing the expression on their face 
when they opened it up and saw it. The anticipation of this moment made you put 
so much thoughtful energy into the gift choice, the wrapping, and the presentation 
of it. You carefully designed that moment, because you loved that person and you 
wanted to see that moment when they were so happy. And what was it that made 
them happy? Just the gift? Surely not. What made them so happy was that you loved 
them so much that you created that special moment just for them. The love you put 
into that moment shone through and into their hearts. If you can take that kind of 
love and put it into the game you are creating for your audience, the love will shine 
through the game and into the hearts of your audience. The game will feel special 
to them, as they realize that someone really cared how they would feel when they 
played the game, and knowing that someone cares about you is a very special feel­
ing. A designer cannot fake this—you must really feel it. As the great magician 
Henry Thurston once said:
Long experience has taught me that the crux of my fortunes is whether I can 
radiate good will toward my audience. There is only one way to do it and that 
is to feel it. You can fool the eyes and minds of the audience, but you cannot 
fool their hearts.
If even this does not work for you, if you find that not only do you not love your 
game, but you have no particular love for your audience, only one thing remains: 
to pretend. This sounds like an insincere thing to do. Didn’t we just say that love 
cannot be faked? But something strange happens when we pretend to love things—
sometimes real love starts to emerge. Have you ever been part of a group that has 
to do some dreary task together? Perhaps a day of spring cleaning. Everyone is 

417
Designing Together
dreading it and moping about it. Then one person says, half jokingly, “Come on, 
everybody, this is gonna be awesome! We’re going to have so much fun!” Everyone 
chuckles at the sarcasm and, just for fun, starts approaching the activity with a pre­
tend “this is going to be awesome” attitude. And just by pretending this, soon the 
activity does start to become fun—and ironically, everyone starts to love it. If you 
don’t know how to love something, just ask yourself what kinds of things someone 
who really loved the game would say and do, and start doing those things. You may 
be surprised at the transformation that starts to take place within yourself.
Again, I am completely sincere when I say that team love for the game is the 
most important factor determining whether the team will succeed. Love is not a 
luxury—it is a necessity if you are to have any hope at all of producing a great game.
Designing Together
We forgot one important variation on our magic words:
I am a game designer.
If everyone on the team loves the project, that’s great! But it gives you a new prob­
lem—everyone is going to have opinions about the design! For some designers, this 
is terrifying—the idea that other members of the team want to contribute design 
ideas threatens their status as designer and puts them in a position where they have 
to argue with others about the “right” design for the game. These designers often 
choose to withdraw from the team, ignore these opinions, and produce a design 
completely independent from the rest of the team. The effect is predictable: all the 
beautiful ideas that each team member had for the game have been crushed, and 
the love they had for the game dries up and blows away. The designer becomes frus­
trated with the team because they seem unwilling and unable to realize his glorious 
vision and the game, as you might expect, pleases no one.
A much more successful approach is to include the team whenever possible in 
the design process. If you can set your ego aside, you will quickly realize that most 
of the people on the team with design ideas don’t want to hijack the game design—
they just want their ideas to be heard, because they, too, want the game to be great! 
Lens #100: The Lens of Love
To use this lens, ask yourself these questions:
●
●
Do I love my project? If not, how can I change that?
●
●
Does everyone on the team love the project? If not, how can that be changed?

418
CHAPTER Twenty-Five • THE DESIGNER USUALLY WORKS WITH A TEAM
If you include everyone in the design process, taking every idea and suggestion 
seriously, you will
●
●
Have more ideas to choose from
●
●
Weed out flawed ideas quickly
●
●
Be forced to view the game from many perspectives
●
●
Make everyone on the team feel like they own the design
When the whole team participates in the design, your game will be stronger, and 
everyone will embark on implementation with confidence that they understand the 
design. This is very important, because not all design decisions get made ahead of 
time. Hundreds of tiny decisions get made all the time—not by the designer but by 
the programmers, artists, and executives working on the game. If all of these people 
have a solid, shared understanding of the game design, these little decisions will all 
reinforce the design of the game, and the project will have a unified robustness and 
solidity that it can’t get any other way. It is not uncommon for many different people 
on a project to feel that their contribution was the most important part of the game—
and not unhealthy, either! This just means that many different team members feel 
personal ownership and responsibility for that game. One great way to amplify this 
feeling is to avoid “overfleshing” your designs. If you leave some ambiguity in the 
detailed design of your game, particularly for parts you aren’t sure about, it forces 
the developers working on that section of the game to think about what that section 
of the game should be like and to come up with ideas for how to implement those 
fine details. Since they are often closest to that part of the game, their instincts about 
detailed design are often quite good—and if their ideas are good ones and go into the 
game, they will feel real pride of ownership of those parts of the game.
Does this mean you have to have everyone involved in the design all the time? 
Not everyone has the stamina to spend three hours debating the right way to lay 
out the inventory interface, so for detailed discussions, you will probably want to 
establish a core design team based on who on the team is both interested and pro­
ductive at these kinds of sessions. But after this core team has come to consensus 
about how a design should work, you should present these ideas to the rest as soon 
as possible. A typical process looks something like the following:
	1.	 Initial brainstorming: Involves as much of the team as possible.
	2.	 Independent design: Core design team members think about ideas independently.
	3.	 Design discussion: Core design members bring their independent ideas together 
to discuss and try to come to consensus on ideas.
	4.	 Design presentation: The core design team presents their progress to the 
whole team, allowing time for comments and criticism. This identifies new 
problems and often turns into brainstorming, kicking off the next round of the 
iterative cycle.

419
Team Communication
It takes both time and energy to involve the whole team in the design, but you 
will find that it makes the game stronger in the long run, provided your team is able 
to communicate.
Team Communication
Teamwork is not a virtue. It is a choice.
—Patrick Lencioni
Hundreds of books have been written about how to facilitate good team communi­
cation. I’m going to boil it down here to ten key issues that are particularly perti­
nent for game design. You might think these things sound basic, and they are—but 
mastery of the basics is essential for excellence in any field, especially something 
as complicated as game design by a team. Without further ado, the ten keys to team 
communication are as follows:
	 1.	 Objectivity: This one is listed first because it is the most likely to go wrong. 
In the passionate throes of design ecstasy, it is easy to become attached to 
an idea that struck you like white lightning from heaven. But if other team 
members don’t like your idea, where are you then? Nowhere, if you are going 
to fight a war of opinions and gut feelings. The tool that will rescue you is 
Lens #14, Problem Statement. It can give you the objectivity you need. All 
team discussion must focus on how well-designed ideas solve the problems 
at hand. Personal preferences about these ideas don’t matter—all that matters 
is whether the ideas solve the problem. Don’t even talk about the idea as “my 
idea” or “Sue’s idea”—speak objectively: “The spaceship idea.” Not only will 
this separate the ideas from the individuals (giving them over to the team), 
but it will be clearer, as well. Another nice trick (which I learned from Randy 
Pausch) is to phrase alternatives as questions. For example, instead of saying 
“A is no good. I like B better,” simply saying “What if we did B instead of A?” 
lets the group collectively discuss the relative merits of B and A. It’s a subtle 
difference, but much about mastering team communication is subtle. If you 
can develop good habits of objectivity as a designer, everyone will bring you 
design questions to answer without hesitation, because they know there is no 
danger of an awkward situation when you “pass judgment” on the design—
they will just get honest, objective, useful feedback. Further, people will want 
to include you in every design session, because by bringing a tone of objectiv­
ity to the room, your presence can help defuse tense struggles between people 
taking a less objective attitude. And best of all, when a team design session has 
a tone of objectivity, every idea is taken seriously, which means that even shy 
team members will feel they can speak freely, and many ideas that might have 
hidden, trembling in the shadows, will confidently come to light.

420
CHAPTER Twenty-Five • THE DESIGNER USUALLY WORKS WITH A TEAM
	 2.	 Clarity: This one is simple. If communication is not clear, there is going to be 
confusion. When you explain something, check to see if people understand 
what you mean. Illustrate your ideas when possible. And if someone else says 
something that isn’t clear, don’t ever pretend you understand what they are 
saying. No matter how embarrassed you are, keep asking questions until you 
understand what they mean. Because if everyone on the design team isn’t on 
the same page, how can there be any meaningful communication? But under­
standing each other is only half of clarity—the other half is getting concrete 
and specific. There is a big difference between saying to your producer “I’ll 
design the combat system by Thursday” and saying “I’ll e-mail you a 3–5 page 
description of the interface for the turn-based combat system by this Thursday 
at 5 p.m.” The first throws wide the door for miscommunication, but the sec­
ond gives important details about a specific deliverable, leaving little room for 
misunderstanding.
	 3.	 Persistence: WRITE THINGS DOWN! There, I said it! Verbal communication is 
momentary—easily misunderstood and forgotten. Things that are recorded can 
be checked later by everyone on the team. And you should use every persistent 
medium that might be useful to you—notebooks, e-mail, forums, mailing lists, 
fileshares, wikis, printed documents, etc. Make sure someone in every design 
meeting is taking notes that can be shared with the team. On many teams, the 
producer is charged with this responsibility. When you do send an e-mail about 
a design topic, make sure to include everyone on the team. This avoids the dan­
ger of people being left out or even just feeling left out.
	 4.	 Comfort: I know this one sounds a little silly. What does comfort have to do 
with communication? Simply this: when people are comfortable, they are less 
distracted and communicate more freely. Make sure your team has a place to 
communicate that is quiet and with the right temperature, has enough chairs, 
and has a large writing surface; in short, it is a place that is physically com­
fortable. Also, you need to make sure team members aren’t hungry, thirsty, or 
overtired. People who are physically uncomfortable will be terrible commu­
nicators. And physical comfort isn’t enough—they must also be emotionally 
comfortable, which leads us to our next item.
	 5.	 Respect: We have discussed how the secret to being a good designer is to be 
a good listener. Well, the secret to good listening is to respect the person you 
are listening to. People who do not feel respected tend to speak little, and when 
they do speak, they often are not honest about their feelings, for fear they will 
be judged harshly. People who feel respected speak freely, openly, and honestly. 
Respecting people is easy, if you can remember to do it. Simply treat them, at 
every moment, how you would like to be treated. Don’t cut them off or roll your 
eyes, even if you think what they are saying is foolish. Be polite and patient at 
all times. Find nice things to say, even if you have to stretch a little. Keep in 
mind that others are more like you than unlike you—look for things you have 
in common, for it is easiest to respect people like ourselves. When all else fails, 

421
Team Communication
repeat this mantra to yourself: “What if I’m wrong?” If you somehow insult 
or offend someone, do not rush to defend what you have said. Rush instead 
to apologize and do so sincerely. For if you can manage to respect your team­
mates at all times, they cannot help but respect you. And when everyone feels 
respected, they will communicate at their best.
	 6.	 Trust: Respect is impossible without trust, and vice versa—if I can’t trust what 
you say and do, how can I know whether you respect me? Trust is not some­
thing that works on faith alone—relationships of trust gradually build up over 
time. For this reason, the quality of communication matters much less than 
the quantity of communication. People who see each other day in and day out, 
constantly talking, constantly solving problems together, gradually learn how 
much they can trust each other, and when. A group of people who barely know 
each other and only meet once a month have no idea who can be trusted with 
what. This is one area where digital communication isn’t good enough—there 
is something in the nuance of face-to-face communication that allows us to 
make subconscious decisions about how and when to trust people. The easi­
est way to figure out who trusts who on a team is to observe who eats lunch 
together. Most animals are very selective about who they eat with, and humans 
are no exception. If the artists eat separately from the programmers, there is a 
good chance the team has pipeline problems. If the Xbox team eats separately 
from the PlayStation team, there are often porting problems. Give your team 
every opportunity to be together and to communicate together, even if it is not 
about things to do with your project, for the more high-bandwidth communica­
tion (about anything!) that your team can have, the more they will learn how to 
trust each other—this is the reason so few game studios have individual offices, 
preferring instead to seat teams together in open offices where they can’t help 
but have constant face-to-face communication with one another all day long.
	 7.	 Honesty: Just as comfort depends on respect and respect depends on trust, 
trust depends on honesty. If you have somehow developed a reputation for 
dishonesty in some area, even if it has nothing to do with game design or devel­
opment, others will be afraid to be honest with you, which will inhibit team 
communication. Game development can sometimes get very political, and you 
will surely have to stretch the truth about some things from time to time—but 
your team must always feel certain they are getting the truth from you, or team 
communication will be strained.
	 8.	 Privacy: Being honest isn’t always easy, because sometimes the truth can be 
painful. And even though we all hope to stay objective in our design work, 
there are times when personal pride and ego are necessarily tangled up in 
our work. Talking about these things honestly in a public forum can be dif­
ficult or impossible. People will tell you their true feelings in a one-on-one 
conversation much more easily than in public. Take the time to speak pri­
vately with each member of the team when you can—they will often present 
ideas and discuss problems they simply did not feel comfortable discussing 

422
CHAPTER Twenty-Five • THE DESIGNER USUALLY WORKS WITH A TEAM
publicly. These one-on-one conversations also go a long way to help build 
trust, as well, creating a virtuous circle: more trust leads to more honest 
communication, which leads to still more trust, and so on.
	 9.	 Unity: During the design process, there will be many conflicting opinions 
and arguments about what is right for the game. This is healthy and natural. 
Ultimately, though, the team must arrive at a decision everyone agrees upon. 
Keep in mind that it takes two people to have a disagreement. If one member 
of the team is stubborn on a particular point, you must treat them with the 
respect they deserve and work with them until a meaningful compromise can 
be found. Asking them to explain why this point is so important to them can 
often make the rest of the team understand why the point is important. When 
this fails, an excellent question to ask is, “What would it take to bring you in?” 
You may not be able to settle this difference in opinion immediately, but the one 
thing you cannot do is ignore it. Intel has a wonderful phrase they use in these 
situations: “disagree and commit.” We can’t always agree on the best path, but 
we can come to agreement on what we are going to do right now. Team mem­
bers need to sometimes be able to agree to go down a path they don’t agree 
with for the sake of team unity. If they can’t do this, it will show in the game. 
Just as a single cylinder not firing in a car engine cuts performance in half and 
ultimately ruins the engine, one team member who does not buy into the design 
slows the efforts of everyone on the team and can, in the end, tear the team 
apart. The goal of communication is unity.
	10.	 Love: Where else could this chain possibly lead? And it is indeed a chain. 
Without objectivity, clarity, persistence, comfort, respect, trust, honesty, pri­
vacy, and unity, the love a team has for the game will be jeopardized. But if you 
have all these things, the team’s love for the game will shine through, and you 
will have no choice but to make an incredible game.
Lens #101: The Lens of the Team
To make sure your team is operating like a well-oiled machine, ask yourself 
these questions:
●
●
Is this the right team for this project? Why?
●
●
Is the team communicating objectively?
●
●
Is the team communicating clearly?
●
●
Is the team comfortable with each other?
●
●
Is there an air of trust and respect among the team?
●
●
Is the team ultimately able to unify around decisions?

423
Other Reading to Consider
Game design and development are hard. Unless you are multitalented and your 
project is tiny, you can’t do it alone. People are more important than ideas, because, 
in the words of Pixar’s Ed Catmull, “If you give a good idea to a mediocre group, 
they’ll screw it up. If you give a mediocre idea to a good group, they’ll fix it.”
You might think that all this team talk has nothing to do with design and that 
if other people on the team don’t do their jobs, it has nothing to do with you as a 
designer. And that may be true, but it has everything to do with the game that gets 
created. Since everyone who touches a game exerts some influence on its design, 
you need everyone on the team to pull together, if the glorious vision you share is 
ever to come to light.
Now, with all this team communication going on, someone is going to write 
some documents—and that is the subject of our next chapter.

CHAPTER Twenty-Six • THE TEAM SOMETIMES COMMUNICATES THROUGH DOCUMENTS
The Myth of the Game Design Document
Many novice game designers, and other dreamers, have an interesting vision of how 
the process of game design works. Not being acquainted with the Rule of the Loop, 
they believe that the process of game design involves a genius game designer sitting 
down alone at a keyboard and typing out a glorious and perfect game design docu­
ment. When this masterpiece is complete, all that needs to be done is to hand it to a 
competent team of programmers and artists and wait for them to turn this shining 
vision into a reality. “If only,” the frustrated would-be designer thinks, “I could find 
out the proper format for a game design document, I could become a professional 
game designer too! I’m full of ideas—but without this magic template, there is no 
way for me to design games.”
It is very important for me to be clear about this next point, so I am going to use 
a very large font. Please listen closely:
The magic template does not exist!
It never has existed, and it never will exist. Anyone who tells you otherwise 
is a fool or a liar. Even if such a thing did exist, it’s not clear that it would be 
helpful. Consider what designer Jason VandenBerghe has to say about game design 
documents:
The trouble with GDDs is that they are literally out of date the moment you 
write them. Design documents are an expression of your current theories 
about what will make your game good… but until you see those theories 
in practice, you cannot know. Unfortunately, it is in our nature to treat 
official documents as though they were specifications, or scripts, or blue­
prints. They are not - they are theories. Evil abounds when you have a docu­
ment that some people think is a plan, some people think is a theory, and 
some people think is a blueprint. Small teams can overcome these inequities 
through lots of interpersonal communication… but larger teams will have 
a much harder time.
Does this mean that documents are not a part of game design? No—documents 
are a very important part of game design. But documents are different for every 
game and different for every team. To understand the correct structure of the docu­
ments for your game, you must first understand their purpose.
The Purpose of Documents
Game documents have exactly two purposes: memory and communication.

427
Types of Game Documents
Memory
Humans have terrible memories. A game design will be full of thousands of impor­
tant decisions that define how the game works and why. There is a good chance you 
will not be able to remember them all. When these brilliant ideas are fresh in your 
mind, you will likely feel that they are impossible to forget. But two weeks and two 
hundred design decisions later, it is very easy to forget even the most ingenious of 
solutions. If you get in the habit of recording your design decisions, it will save you 
the trouble of having to solve the same problems all over again.
Communication
Even if you are blessed with a perfect memory, though, decisions about the design 
of your game must be communicated to many other people on the team. Documents 
are a very effective way to do that. And this communication, as we discussed in 
Chapter 25, “Team,” will not be one way. It will be a dialog, for as soon as a decision 
is put on paper, someone will find a problem with it or come up with a way to make 
it better. Documents can get more minds on the design faster to more quickly find 
and fix weaknesses in the game design. So many people need to see and touch these 
documents; it’s easy to see why Google Docs has become the standard way to write 
and update game documents.
Types of Game Documents
Since the purpose of documents is for memory and communication, the types of 
documents you will need are defined by what needs to be remembered and what 
needs to be communicated. It is the rare game where one document serves all 
necessary purposes—usually it makes sense to create several different kinds of 
documents. There are six main groups that need to remember and communicate 
different things, and each generates its own special kind of documents.

CHAPTER Twenty-Six • THE TEAM SOMETIMES COMMUNICATES THROUGH DOCUMENTS
The preceding figure shows some possible paths of memory and communica­
tion on a game design team. Each arrow could be a document or more than one 
document. Let’s look at each of the six groups and what documents they might 
create.
Design
	 1.	 Game design overview: This high-level document might only be a few pages. It 
is often written primarily for management so that they can understand enough 
about what this game is and who it is for, without getting into too much detail. 
The overview document can be useful for the whole team to get a sense of the 
big picture of the game. Designer Stone Librande gives excellent advice: every 
game should be explainable in a diagram on a poster that explains how the 
whole game fits together.
	 2.	 Detailed design document: This document is the one that describes all the 
game mechanics and interfaces in great detail. This document usually serves 
two purposes: so the designers remember all the little detailed ideas they came 
up with and  help communicate those ideas to the engineers who have to code 
them and the artists who need to make them look nice. Since this document 
is seldom seen by “outsiders,” it is usually a terrible mess with just enough 
detail to spark discussion and keep important ideas from being forgotten. It 
is often the thickest of the documents and is seldom kept up to date. Halfway 
through the project, it is often abandoned entirely—by that point, the game 
itself contains most of the important details, and the ones not in there are often 
exchanged through informal means, such as e-mails or short pages of notes. At 
the beginning of a project, though, finding the right form for your design docu­
ments is important. In most cases, it is much better to have many small docu­
ments detailing the various subsystems of the game than one giant document. 
Designer Rich Marmura puts it well, “My philosophy on GDDs is that I tailor 
them to the team I am working with. While the GDD is a place to organize my 
thoughts, it must also be a place where team members go for information and 
clarity. While a common core may remain consistent across GDDs, much of the 
structure and style change with the game. Just as no two teams or games are 
ever the same, no two GDDs should ever be the same.”
	 3.	 Story overview: Many games call for professional writers who will create 
dialog and narration for the game. These writers are often contracted and 
often far away from the rest of the team. The game designers often find it 
necessary to create a short document that describes the important settings, 
characters, and actions that will take place in the game. Frequently, the 
writers respond to this with interesting new ideas that change the whole 
game design.

429
Types of Game Documents
Engineering
	 4.	 Technical design document: Often, a videogame has many complex systems 
that have nothing to do with game mechanics and everything to do with getting 
things to appear on the screen, sending data over networks, and other crunchy 
technical tasks. Usually, no one outside the engineering team cares much about 
these details, but if the engineering team is more than one person, it often 
makes sense to record these details in a document so that when others join the 
team, they can understand how the whole thing is supposed to work. Like the 
detailed design document, it is rare for this to stay up to date more than halfway 
through a project, but writing this document is often essential to getting the 
necessary systems architected and the coding underway.
	 5.	 Pipeline overview: Much of the challenging work of engineering a videogame 
comes from properly integrating art assets into the game. There are often spe­
cial “do’s and don’ts” the artists must adhere to, if the art is to appear properly 
in the game. This brief document is usually generated by the engineers explic­
itly for the art team, and the simpler it is, the better.
	 6.	 System limitations: Designers and artists are often completely unaware of what 
is and is not possible on the system they are designing for (or so they pretend). 
For some games, the engineers find it useful to create documents that make clear 
certain limits that should not be crossed—number of polygons on the screen 
at once, number of update messages sent per second, number of simultaneous 
explosions on screen at once, etc. Often this information is not so cut and dried, 
but trying to establish it (and get it in writing) can save a lot of time later—and 
it can help foster discussions about creative solutions to get past these limits.
Art
	 7.	 Art bible: If several artists are going to work together on a title to create a sin­
gle, consistent look and feel, they must have some guidelines to help maintain 
this consistency. An “art bible” is simply a document that provides these guide­
lines. These might be character sheets, examples of environments, examples of 
color usage, examples of interface, or anything else that defines the look of any 
element in the game.
	 8.	 Concept art overview: There are many people on the team that need to under­
stand what the game is going to look like before it is built. This is the job of concept 
art. The art alone doesn’t usually tell the story, though—it often makes the most 
sense in a design document, so often the art team works with the design team to 
come up with a set of images that show how they will look and feel in the context 
of the game design. These early images end up everywhere—in the game design 
overview, in the detailed design document, and sometimes even in technical doc­
uments, to illustrate the type of look that the technology is striving to achieve.

430
CHAPTER Twenty-Six • THE TEAM SOMETIMES COMMUNICATES THROUGH DOCUMENTS
Production
	 9.	 Game budget: While we would all like to just “work on the game until it is done,” 
the economic realities of the game business seldom allow this. Usually, the team 
is required to come up with a cost to develop the game before they completely 
understand what they are building. This cost is usually arrived at through a 
document, usually a spreadsheet, that attempts to list all the work that needs to 
be done to complete the game and complete with time estimates that translate 
into dollars. It is impossible for the producer or project manager to come up with 
these numbers on their own, so they generally work closely with every part of the 
team to make the estimates as accurate as possible. Often this document is one of 
the first created, since it is used to help secure the funding for the project. A good 
project manager will continue to evolve this document throughout the project to 
ensure that the project does not go over the budget it has been allocated.
	10.	 Asset tracker: Somehow, be it with a simple spreadsheet or a more formal sys­
tem, you need to keep track of what has been created and what state it is in. This 
goes for code, game levels, art assets, sound and music, and design documents.
	11.	 Project schedule: On a well-run project, this document will be the one most fre­
quently updated. We know the process of game design and development is rife 
with surprises and unexpected changes. Nevertheless, some kind of planning 
is necessary, ideally planning that can change on a weekly basis at the least. 
A good project schedule document lists all the tasks that need to be accom­
plished, how long each will take, when each task must be completed, and who 
will do them. Hopefully, this document will take into account the fact that a 
single person shouldn’t do more than forty hours in a week and the fact that 
some tasks can’t be started until others are completed. Sometimes this schedule 
is kept on a spreadsheet and other times on more formal project management 
software. Keeping this document up to date can easily be a full-time job on a 
medium-sized or larger game.
Writing
	12.	 Story bible: While one might think that the story of the game might be deter­
mined entirely by the writers (if any) on the project, it is often the case that 
everyone on the project contributes meaningful changes to the story. The 
engine programmers might realize that a certain story element is going to be 
too much of a technical challenge, and they might propose a story change. The 
artists might have a visual idea for a whole new part of the story that the writ­
ers never imagined. The game designers might have some ideas for gameplay 
concepts that require story changes. A story bible that lays down the law about 
what is and is not possible in this story world makes it much easier for everyone 
on the team to contribute story ideas, and ultimately this makes for a stronger 
story world that is well integrated with art, technology, and gameplay.

431
So, Where Do I Start?
	13.	 Script: If the NPCs in the game are going to talk, their dialog has to come from 
somewhere! This dialog is often written in a script document that is either 
separate from or an appendix to the detailed design document. It is crucial that 
the game designers review all of the dialog, since it is all too easy for a line of 
dialog to be inconsistent with a rule of gameplay.
	14.	 Game tutorial and manual: Videogames are complex, and the players have to 
learn how to play them somehow. In-game tutorials, web pages, and printed 
manuals are how this usually happens. The text that goes into these is impor­
tant—if players can’t understand your game, how can they enjoy it? The details 
of your game design will likely continue to change up until the last minute of 
development, so it is important to be sure someone is continually checking this 
text to make sure it is still accurate with the game implementation.
Players
	15.	 Game walk-through: The developers aren’t the only ones who make docu­
ments about the game! If players like a game, they are going to write their own 
documents about it and post them online. Studying what your players write 
about your game can be a great way to find out, in detail, what players like and 
dislike about your game, which parts are too hard, and which are too easy. By 
the time a player walk-through is written, of course, it is often too late to change 
your game—but at least you’ll know for next time!
Again, these documents are not a magic template—there is no magic template! Each 
game is different and will have different needs in terms of both memory and com­
munication that you will have to discover for yourself.
So, Where Do I Start?
You start simply, just like you did when you started designing your game. Start 
with a document that is a rough bullet list of the ideas you want to include in your 
game. As the list grows, questions will arise in your mind about the design—these 
questions are crucial! Write them down so you don’t forget them! “Working on 
your design” will mostly mean answering these questions, so you don’t want to 
lose the questions. Each time you answer a question to your satisfaction, make a 
note of the decision and the reason why you made it. Gradually, your list of ideas, 
plans, questions, and answers will grow and start to fall naturally into sections. 
Keep writing down the things you need to remember and the things you need 
to communicate. Before you know it, you will have a design document—not one 
based on a magic template but one that grew organically around the unique design 
of your unique game.

don’t, ask yourself these questions:

CHAPTER Twenty-Seven • GOOD GAMES ARE CREATED THROUGH PLAYTESTING
Playtesting
It is easy, when developing a game, to fantasize about the player experience and to 
imagine how great it will be. Playtesting is necessary to serve as a wakeup call and 
force you to solve the ugly problems you’ve been putting off. Before we get too deep 
into this discussion, I want to draw the distinction between four different types of 
testing (focus groups, QA testing, usability testing, and playtesting):
	1.	 Focus groups: This is a term that often causes professional designers to wince. 
It refers to sessions where potential players are interviewed about their likes and 
dislikes, often in an attempt to determine whether they like a game idea that a 
company is considering. Focus groups can be quite useful in the right context 
(particularly when deciding the relative priority of well-defined features), but 
they have a bad name because they are so often poorly run and manipulated to 
kill ideas that management is afraid of.
	2.	 QA testing: QA is “quality assurance.” This testing has nothing to do with how 
enjoyable the game is and everything to do with looking for bugs.
	3.	 Usability testing: This is all about determining whether your interface and sys­
tems are intuitive and easy to use. Both of these are necessary for an enjoyable 
game, but they are not enough. Keep this in mind when someone suggests bring­
ing in a usability expert to make your game more fun.
	4.	 Playtesting: Separate from the previous three, playtesting is all about getting 
people to come play your game to see if it engenders the experience for which it 
was designed. And while the other three types of testing are useful and impor­
tant, in this chapter, we will focus only on the type of testing designers care 
about the most: playtesting.

My Terrible Secret
My Terrible Secret
I’m going to admit something now that is profoundly embarrassing. For years, I 
have tried to pretend that it isn’t the case, but there is no getting around it. I don’t 
like talking about it, because it makes me a hypocrite and calls my qualifications as 
a game designer into serious question.
However, my goal with this book is to help lay out how game design really is, 
not some idyllic dream version of how it should be. So, here it goes. Please try not 
to judge me too harshly.
I hate playtesting.
Does playtesting find problems early, while there is still time to fix them? Yes. 
Does playtesting build the team’s confidence that they are making the right game 
for the right audience? Yes. Is playtesting essential to making a good game? Yes. 
Does playtesting fill me with a terror so intense that I can’t even think straight? Yes, 
yes, yes!
It’s completely humiliating. I know that playtesting is good for my game, not just 
good, but necessary. But when it comes to actually doing the playtesting, I find every 
excuse possible to avoid it. First, I delay getting the playtesting organized. When it 
eventually gets organized, I make excuses why I can’t be there. When I actually am 
there, I find reasons not to observe it directly, getting distracted with anything else 
that might be nearby. I’m well aware of these tendencies, and I fight them tooth and 
nail, but still, my fear of playtesting remains.
Why? What am I so afraid of? It’s simple. I’m afraid that people won’t like my 
game. I should be above that, I know. But I’m not. When you make a game, you try 
to put everything you can into it: heart, soul, dreams, blood, sweat, and tears. A 
game you work hard on becomes a little piece of yourself. To have people engage 
with that and then reject it, well, it hurts. A lot. And don’t kid yourself—it is going 
to happen.
Having people hate your work is probably one of the most painful parts of being 
a game designer. And playtesting is like an engraved invitation that reads:
You are cordially invited
to tell me why I suck
Bring a friend — Refreshments Served
Does playtesting have to be so uncomfortable? It does. The whole point of play­
testing is to make clear to you that some of the decisions you were completely com­
fortable with are completely wrong. You need to find these things out as soon as 
possible, while there is still time to do something about them.
Maybe playtesting comes naturally to you. Maybe you have no fear of people 
ridiculing your work. If so, congratulations! Your objective viewpoint will be a great 
boon to you during playtesting sessions. But if you fear and loathe these sessions, 
like I do, there is only one thing to do: get over it. People are either going to like your 

436
CHAPTER Twenty-Seven • GOOD GAMES ARE CREATED THROUGH PLAYTESTING
game or they aren’t. If they do, great. If they don’t, also great! You have a chance to 
ask them why they don’t like it, so you can fix it. Let go of your fears and embrace 
playtesting for what it is: a wonderful opportunity to make your game better.
Every playtest is defined by five key questions: Why, who, where, what, and how?
Playtest Question the First: Why?
Do you remember how, in Chapter 8, “Iteration,” we discussed how every prototype 
is designed to answer a question? A playtest is a kind of prototype—not a prototype 
of the game, but a prototype of the game experience (which is what we care about 
the most!). If you don’t enter into your playtest with specific goals in mind, you 
stand a good chance of wasting your time. The more specific the questions you have 
when you organize the playtest, the more you will get out of it.
There are millions of questions you might want your playtest to answer. The 
most obvious one—“Is my game fun?”—is not enough. Generally, you want your 
questions to be as specific as possible. The examples are as follows—some general, 
some specific:
●
●
Do men and women play my game differently?
●
●
Do kids like my game better than adults?
●
●
Do players understand how to play?
●
●
Do players want to play a second time? A third time? A twentieth time? Why?
●
●
Do players feel the game is fair?
●
●
Are players ever bored?
●
●
Are players ever confused?
●
●
Are players ever frustrated?
●
●
Are there any dominant strategies or loopholes?
●
●
Does the game have hidden bugs?
●
●
What strategies do players find on their own?
●
●
Which parts of the game are the most fun?
●
●
Which parts of the game are the least fun?
●
●
Should the “A” button or “B” button be used for jumping?
●
●
Is level three too long?
●
●
Is the asparagus puzzle too hard?
These are just a few ideas to get you thinking. I often find that using the lenses 
throughout this book is a great way to come up with good playtesting questions.

437
Playtest Question the Second: Who?
Preparing a list of the questions you would like the playtest to answer is a great first 
step to planning a playtest, because until you have determined the “why,” as in “why 
are we having this playtest?” there is no way to answer the who, where, what, and how.
Playtest Question the Second: Who?
Once you know why you are having a playtest, you can decide who you should be 
testing. And who you pick is entirely determined by what you would like to learn. 
Most likely, you want to pick people who are in your target demographic. But even 
then, there are choices. Here are some common ones:
	1.	 Developers: The first people who will get a chance to try your game are the 
developers, so I’m listing them first.
	
a.	 Pros: The developers are right there! They can play the game a lot, and for a 
long time, and give lots of meaningful, thoughtful feedback. Also, you don’t 
need to worry about them filling out nondisclosure agreements (NDAs), 
since they already know all the confidential information about the game.
	
b.	 Cons: The developers are too close to the game—closer than any real player 
ever will be—and this will distort their opinions about the game. Some 
“design experts” will tell you that it is dangerous to playtest with people 
who work on the game and that you shouldn’t do it. This extreme position 
means, though, that you could miss out on some valuable insights. It is better 
to playtest the developers but take what they say with a grain of salt.
	2.	 Friends: The next people to try the game will most likely be friends and families 
of the developers.
	
a.	 Pros: Friends and families are highly available and comfortable talking to 
you. If they think of a good idea after the playtest is over, you’ll probably still 
get to hear it.
	
b.	 Cons: Your friends and family don’t want to hurt your feelings—after all, 
they have to deal with you on a regular basis. This might cause them to bend 
the truth when they don’t like something. Also, since they like you already, 
they are going to be predisposed to like the game—they will be trying to like 
it, which isn’t what will happen in the real world.
	3.	 Expert gamers: Every genre has its “experts”—hardcore players who have played 
every variety of the type of game you are making. These guys love coming to 
playtest games still in progress, because it gives their “expert” credentials a boost!
	
a.	 Pros: Having played many, if not all, of the games that are similar to the one 
you are making, these expert gamers can give you a detailed account, using 
technical terminology and specific examples, of how your game compares to 
games that are like it.

438
CHAPTER Twenty-Seven • GOOD GAMES ARE CREATED THROUGH PLAYTESTING
	
b.	 Cons: Just as only a small percentage of the eating public are gourmands, 
only a small percentage of the gaming public are, uh, “ludophiles.” Expert 
gamers are often more jaded and demand more complex and difficult game­
play challenges than the average gamer. Many a game has been spoiled by 
overtuning it for the elite tastes of a niche audience of hardcore enthusiasts. 
The Sims Online, which was expected to be a huge success, ended up as a 
crashing failure. One reason seems to have been that it was overtuned for the 
most hardcore players, who were more excited about created content than 
experiencing it.
	4.	 Tissue testers: Ideal testing conditions often include people who have never seen 
your game before. The industry likes to call them “fresh meat” or “tissue testers” 
(a reference to the fact that, like a Kleenex tissue, they can only be used once).
	
a.	 Pros: People who have never seen your game before see it with fresh eyes 
and will notice the things that you have gotten used to. For testing that tries 
to determine usability questions, communication questions, or questions of 
“initial appeal,” these testers can be very valuable.
	
b.	 Cons: Games are generally played multiple times, over many sessions. If you 
only test your game with “tissue testers,” you run the risk of making a game 
that has a strong first-time appeal but gets boring after multiple plays.
Again, who you test with will depend entirely on what you are trying to learn. 
Matching the testers to the questions you are trying to answer is the only way to get 
meaningful results. Nearly every game will test with some combination of the afore­
mentioned testers sometime during the design process—the key is having the right 
testers at the right times to answer the most questions as thoroughly as possible.
Playtest Question the Third: Where?
Just as much depends on the venue of your game (see Chapter 3, “Venue”), much 
depends on the venue of your playtest. Here are some different options:
	1.	 In your studio (or whatever you call the place you actually make the games)
	
a.	 Pros: The developers are all there. You are there. The game is there! So, test­
ing in your studio can be superconvenient for you. Also, it gives everyone on 
the team a chance to observe the game being played by real people.
	
b.	 Cons: The playtesters you bring in might not feel completely comfortable. 
They will be in strange surroundings, and unless they have some kind of pri­
vate room, they are likely to be afraid to have fun while others are working. 
If you host a playtest in your studio, you should go out of your way to make 
it as comfortable as possible. The last thing you want is playtesters who are 
afraid to make noise, have fun, and speak their minds. Asking the testers to 
bring friends helps.

439
Playtest Question the Third: Where?
	2.	 In a playtesting lab: Some (though, actually, surprisingly few) large game 
companies have special labs set aside for playtesting. Also, some third-party 
companies will playtest your game for you in special labs designed for the 
purpose.
	
a.	 Pros: The lab is designed for playtesting! It probably has all the things you 
could wish for: one-way mirrors, cameras on the playtesters, playtesting 
experts to ask the right questions and take detailed notes, and maybe even a 
carefully selected group of the right testers!
	
b.	 Cons: This kind of thing is usually very expensive. But if you can afford it, it 
may well be worth the investment.
	3.	 At some public venue: Could be a shopping mall, an event on a college campus, 
a games fest like PAX or Indiecade, or a table on a street corner.
	
a.	 Pros: It usually doesn’t cost much, and you will get a chance to get many 
testers, if you find the right venue. When Schell Games needed to test its 
Daniel Tiger’s Neighborhood games, we worked out an arrangement with 
the Pittsburgh Children’s Museum to test periodically right in the museum, 
which provided an endless supply of 3–5-year-old children and their par­
ents—precisely what we needed.
	
b.	 Cons: You may have a hard time finding the “right” testers, that is, the ones 
in your demographic. Also, if there are other things going on in this venue, 
testers may be distracted, not giving you their full attention.
	4.	 At the playtester’s home: After people buy your game, they are going to play it 
in their homes—why not let them play it there now?
	
a.	 Pros: You have a good chance of seeing your game played in its natural 
habitat, under real conditions. Your testers are likely to have their friends 
over, and you stand a chance of seeing real social interaction through your 
game.
	
b.	 Cons: Your playtest might be kind of limited. Probably only one or two 
designers can be there to observe, and you may only be able to test with a 
small number of people during a given session. You may also need to lug 
special hardware with you or at least spend time configuring machines to 
run your prototype software.
	5.	 Online: Why restrict your playtesting to the confines of the physical universe?
	
a.	 Pros: Lots of people will be able to test your game on machines with many 
different configurations. If the questions you need to answer involve stress 
testing your game or learning about massively multiplayer play, this may be 
your best option.
	
b.	 Cons: Quantity of playtesting comes at the price of quality of playtesting. 
Though many people may be playing, you won’t get the same level of insight 
when you aren’t in the same room with the testers. Also, if you are trying 

440
CHAPTER Twenty-Seven • GOOD GAMES ARE CREATED THROUGH PLAYTESTING
to keep your game a secret, this may be hard to do when you make it avail­
able for download. Also, first impressions are important, so you need to 
restrict your player base if you are going to put an unfinished version online. 
Fortunately, some online venues (such as Steam) are creating safe spaces to 
put beta versions of your game, to help control player expectation.
Where exactly you choose to test depends completely on the questions your test 
is trying to answer. Choose your test location with your important “why?” questions 
in mind. Often, the simplest ideas are best—consider this story from designer Curt 
Bererton:
One thing that we did that I found super effective in one of our alphas (for a 
Facebook game) was to put a text box about 2–3 lines of text in height below the 
game. All the text box said was “tell us how to make our game better,” and you 
could send one message per session after which the box would go away. Emails 
would go to a mailing list to which anyone on the team could sign up to see 
what players were putting in there.
This simple text field worked remarkably well during alpha and beta, and we 
even kept it in production for an adjustable small percentage of players (and all 
paying users) such that we’d get around 30 messages per day, which we could 
browse when we wished. You’d think you would get a lot more people swear­
ing or something, but pretty much everything was very high quality feedback. 
We found a ton of bugs, user experience issues, as well as just great ideas. We 
would look especially closely whenever we did a push of a new version. As a 
side note, if you send some summary player state data along (where they are in 
the tutorial or game progression) along with platform specs (version, memory 
etc.) it helps with bug hunting in addition to keeping your finger on the pulse 
of your community.
Playtest Question the Fourth: What?
By “What?” I mean “What will you look for in your playtest?” There are two types 
of things to look for.
The First What: Things You Know You Are Looking For
These come from the questions in your “why?” list. Hopefully, you are going to 
design your playtest so that you can look for answers to these questions (that’s 
why you listed them!). As you plan your test, make sure that you have a way to get 
some kind of answer to every question on your list. If there are parts of your game 
that aren’t relevant to these questions, consider making a special version of the 

441
Playtest Question the Fifth: How?
game that skips these parts to save time. If the questions can’t all be answered by 
a single test, consider making several minitests that will cover the span of things 
you need to find out.
The Second What: Things You Don’t Know You Are Looking For
Anyone can find things they know they are looking for—but only a truly obser­
vant designer, who has learned to listen deeply to players, can find the things they 
don’t know they are looking for. The key is to keep your eyes open for surprises. 
To be surprised at a playtest, you must already have ideas about what will happen: 
Players will attack level two a certain way, they will get excited at the start of level 
three, etc. Whenever anything out of the ordinary happens, good or bad, be ready 
to jump on it, and find a way to understand it. Do girls like your game more than 
boys, when you expected the opposite? Does your villain make people laugh when 
you thought he would be scary? Are players intrigued by something you thought 
was unimportant? Are they debating strategies you never considered? Find out why! 
Even if you weren’t testing for these things, take advantage of this opportunity to 
learn the truth about everything you thought you already understood. The insight 
that comes from understanding these surprises is the sweetest fruit that grows on 
the playtesting tree.
Playtest Question the Fifth: How?
So you’ve figured out why you want to have a playtest, who you will observe, where 
you will hold it, and even what you are going to look for. Those are great prelimi­
naries, but the rubber doesn’t meet the road until you decide how you are going to 
go about it.
Should You Even Be There?
There is a school of thought that believes it is dangerous to have the developers 
of a game present when it is tested. The danger is that their emotional invest­
ment in the game will cause them to encourage the players to overlook flaws and 
“infect” the players with an insider’s viewpoint. And this danger is very real. If 
you cannot stay objective during the playtest and properly police your behavior 
so that playtesters can remain “pure,” you definitely should not be there. If that 
is the case, it is a shame, because there is so much more you will learn by being 
present in person at a playtest than you can get from just reading survey data 
or watching recorded videos. So, though some design theorists might disagree, 
my advice is to find ways to restrain these corrupting impulses so you can be 
there in person.

442
CHAPTER Twenty-Seven • GOOD GAMES ARE CREATED THROUGH PLAYTESTING
What Do You Tell Them Up Front?
For some tests, you won’t tell the players anything at all—you’ll let the game speak 
for itself, particularly if you want to see if they can figure it out by themselves. But for 
the majority of playtests, you will need to tell players something to get them started. 
Use extreme caution when you do so—a few misplaced words right before play begins 
can spoil the entire test. If, for example, you tell players that their goal is to defeat the 
evil Chronos, some players might start looking for him right away and, in doing so, 
miss out on important details they would have found if you hadn’t said that. For this 
reason, you should take careful note of what you say to testers at the beginning, in 
case it has unexpected consequences. It can be a good idea to write it down ahead of 
time, so you can be sure you have prepped all the testers the same way.
Of course, you may find, over the course of several tests, a need to change your 
introductory speech to clarify certain things. And here is one of the great side ben­
efits of playtesting. When you run multiple playtest sessions in sequence, you will 
find yourself gradually tuning the instructions you give to the players, trimming 
a word here, and adding a phrase there, until you have a speech that is very clear 
and very efficient. Write this down! This speech can become the foundation of your 
in-game tutorial. Many game tutorials are terrible—the ones created by this method 
are likely to have an aura of excellence about them. Having an in-game tutorial that 
really makes players feel welcome and cared for is a great first impression for your 
game to make.
Where Do You Look?
Most people who attend a playtest tend to look where the player looks. If it is a 
videogame, this means at the screen. This makes sense, because this way you see 
what the player sees. But it isn’t where I look. I spend most of my time during a 
playtest looking at the players’ faces. Sure, I steal quick glances at the screen for 
context, but mostly, I watch faces, because I don’t just want to see what the players 
are doing, but how they feel when they are doing it. Their facial expressions give a 
wealth of data about the game that will never come out in postgame interviews or 
survey questions.
I learned to do this when I was a street performer. When you do street shows, the 
only money you get is what you collect by passing the hat at the end. So, if you want 
to have dinner that night, it becomes crucial to ensure the crowd you’ve scared 
up stays entertained. With practice, I soon found I could “read” the emotions of a 
crowd quickly and would tune my performance appropriately—stretching out parts 
they enjoyed and moving quickly through parts that bored them. I was quite sur­
prised, when I started making videogames, to find myself reading the emotions of 
the players as they played and determining how the game should change to improve 
the quality of the players’ emotional experiences. This is something that we are all 
equipped to do—it just has to be practiced.

443
Playtest Question the Fifth: How?
Of course, it would be best if our eyes could be everywhere at once: on the game, 
on the players’ faces, and even on their hands, to see if they are using the controls 
as we would expect. And with modern video technology, you can see it all! Getting 
a few different cameras set up to feed to a single split-screen image can be a great 
way to record the game, face, and hands at the same time, so you can go back later 
and see how all three of these things interrelate.
What Other Data Should You Collect During Play?
Watching with your own eyes and recording video of a play session can give you 
a lot of useful information, but there is other information you can gather as well. 
With a little planning, you can find ways to keep logs of important game events 
during each play session. If your game is digital, you can log all this automatically, 
but if your game is not, you can just make careful notes when these important 
events occur. What constitutes an “important event” will vary from game to game 
of course. Here are some examples of data you might want to collect:
●
●
How long did players spend in the character creator?
●
●
How many hits did it take to defeat the villain?
●
●
What was the average player score?
●
●
Which weapons were used the most?
The more your game can collect these data automatically, the more useful the 
data will be to you. In the past few years, it has become a necessity for anyone cre­
ating an MMO or free to play game to have a rigorous system of analytics in place 
accompanied by a content management system so that a continuous system of tun­
ing and testing can be taking place in perpetuity. This new kind of “quantitative 
design” has its dangers—it can lead to dull designs and fear of trusting your own 
instincts as a designer, but if you can overcome that, it is a subtle art that gives you 
new opportunities to understand player behavior.
Will I Disturb the Players Midgame?
This is a delicate question. When you disturb players midgame, perhaps to ask 
them a question about what they are doing, you run the risk of interfering with 
their natural play patterns. On the other hand, asking the right question at the right 
moment may give you an insight you would not have had any other way. You might 
argue that it is best to just make a note of the question you have in mind and ask 
the player about it when the play session is over. But by that time, the player is in a 
different state of mind and may have no recollection of what you are talking about. 
It is a difficult trade-off. Most designers seem to favor only interrupting when the 
player is doing something truly surprising that the designer does not understand.

CHAPTER Twenty-Seven • GOOD GAMES ARE CREATED THROUGH PLAYTESTING
Experts in human computer interaction often recommend the “think-aloud pro­
tocol” to learn the decision-making process of people interacting with software 
products. The idea is that you encourage the person using the software to verbalize 
all their internal thoughts into a kind of stream-of-consciousness ramble. With a 
game, this might sound something like: “Let’s see… I’m supposed to find bananas, 
but I don’t see any… I wonder what’s behind that log… Yow! Bad guys! Ouch! Take 
that! Okay… Hey, is that a banana up on that hill?” etc. With games, this can be 
tricky. For some people, the act of speaking their thoughts changes the way they 
behave—often their behavior becomes more thoughtful and careful, so the think-
aloud protocol can taint play patterns. Other people become paralyzed trying to play 
and talk at the same time, and when the gameplay gets stressful, they often stop 
talking altogether, which is frustrating, because these stressful moments are often 
when a designer needs the most insight into what a player is thinking. However, 
for some players, thinking aloud comes very naturally and can provide very useful 
information—the trick is identifying these players or training repeat playtesters to 
do it well. I have seen well-meaning interaction experts completely ruin playtests 
by constantly peppering players with questions during play in an attempt to elicit 
think-aloud. When and whether to use this technique is something you will need 
to decide for yourself.
What Data Will I Collect after the Play Session?
You will gain a tremendous amount of information just by observing players inter­
acting with your game. But you can gain even more with meaningful follow-up 
questions with interviews and surveys. But which should you choose?
Surveys
Surveys are a great way to have players answer straightforward questions about 
your game that are easily quantified. Here are some tips for getting the most out of 
surveys:
	1.	 Use pictures whenever possible, when asking about game elements or scenes, 
to help ensure the player knows what you mean.
	2.	 Online surveys can save you (and your playtesters) a lot of time. Systems like 
SurveyMonkey or Google Forms are easy to set up and are free or inexpensive.
	3.	 Don’t ask people to rate things on a scale from 1 to 10. You will get more con­
sistent results if you use a five-point scale, where each of the points is clearly 
labeled, such as
	
a.	 Terrible
	
b.	 Pretty bad

445
What Data Will I Collect after the Play Session?
	
c.	 So-so
	
d.	 Good
	
e.	 Excellent
	4.	 Don’t put too many questions on your survey, or people will start to tune out 
near the end, and your results won’t be worth much.
	5.	 Give them the survey right after they have played, while things are fresh in 
their mind.
	6.	 Have someone on hand to answer clarifying questions that the testers might 
have about the survey.
	7.	 Note the age and gender of each playtester surveyed, so you can see if these 
have a connection to player opinions.
	8.	 Don’t take survey data as gospel. It is unlikely that your survey is truly scien­
tific, and playtesters tend to make things up when they aren’t sure.
Interviews
A postgame interview is a great way to ask players questions too complex for a 
simple survey sheet. It’s also a way to get a sense of how they really felt about the 
game, since you can see emotion in their faces and hear it in their voices. Here are 
some interview tips:
●
●
Have a script of questions ready when you interview people. Leave space so 
you can write down their responses. Also leave space for general notes when the 
conversation takes unexpected turns (in other words, be ready for surprises!).
●
●
Interview people privately, when possible. People will speak more honestly in a 
one-on-one situation than in a case where others (particularly people they know) 
are listening in. If the tester has other friends who are testing, consider doing a 
group interview only after the private interview is done, to see if new information 
comes out when the close friends are talking to each other.
●
●
Playtesters will avoid hurting your feelings, particularly if they know (or 
think) you helped make the game. Sometimes, staying objective is not enough. 
I sometimes make a big show of saying “I need your help. This game has some 
real problems, but we’re not sure what they are. Please, if there is anything at 
all you don’t like about this game, it will be a great help to me if you let me 
know.” This gives a tester permission to speak honestly about their likes and 
dislikes.
●
●
Avoid memory tests. Asking players questions like “On level 3, when you got 
to the yellow butterflies, you flew left instead of right. Why?” will generally get 
you blank stares. Players are so busy playing the game; they don’t always form 
memories about things that are not immediately relevant to the goal of the 

446
CHAPTER Twenty-Seven • GOOD GAMES ARE CREATED THROUGH PLAYTESTING
game. If you need answers to questions like that, you should ask them while 
the game is being played.
●
●
Don’t expect playtesters to be game designers. Questions like “Would the game 
have been better if level three were harder?” may not get the results you want. In 
general, players always think they want the game to be easier, so they are likely 
to say “no” to that question. Most playtesters are not skilled at thinking about 
and discussing game mechanics. A better way to ask the same thing would be 
“were any parts of level three boring?,” which will probably get you an honest 
answer and the information you are looking for.
●
●
Ask for more than you need. Instead of asking “what was your least favorite 
part?” why not ask “what were your three least favorite parts?” You’ll get more 
data, and it will be sorted by priority… the thing that stands out most in a play­
er’s mind will come first.
●
●
Set your ego aside. It can be very hard to sit and listen to someone tell you how 
bad your game is. You will be sorely tempted to step in and defend your game 
and tell them how it is supposed to be. Resist this urge. No one cares how the 
game was supposed to be during this interview. Right now, all that matters is 
how this playtester feels about the game, and why. When you feel the temptation 
rise within you, steel yourself, and ask objective questions like “What don’t you 
like about it?” and “Can you tell me more about that?”
As technology advances and real-time analytics and dependence on microtrans­
action revenue become increasingly critical, the more playtesting is merging into 
ongoing game tuning. But don’t let that throw you—testing is testing. In the end, 
it’s all about collecting information about what people like and what they don’t and 
intelligently using that information to make better choices about your design.
Lens #103: The Lens of Playtesting
Playtesting is your chance to see your game in action. To ensure your playtests 
are as good as they can be, ask yourself these questions:
●
●
Why are we doing a playtest?
●
●
Who should be there?
●
●
Where should we hold it?
●
●
What will we look for?
●
●
How will we get the information we need?

Tom was making a drawing when Samuel came in. Samuel looked at the draw­
ing. “What is that?”
“I’m trying to work out a gate opener, so a man won’t have to get out of his rig. 
Here’s the pull rod to open the latch.”
“What’s going to open it?”
“I figured a strong spring.”
Samuel studied the drawing. “Then, what’s going to close it?”
“This bar here. It would slip to this spring, and give tension the other way.”
“I see. It might work, too, if the gate was truly hung. And it would only take 
twice as much time to make and keep up as twenty years of getting out of the 
rig to open the gate.”
Tom protested, “Sometimes with a skittish horse…”
“I know,” said his father. “but the main reason is that it’s fun.”
Tom grinned. “Caught me,” he said.

Technology, At Last
The machine does not isolate man from the great problems of nature but plunges 
him more deeply into them.
—Antoine de Saint-Exupery
It may seem strange, in a book that is ostensibly meant to instruct about the design 
of videogames, to wait until so near the end to talk about technology. But there is 
a reason. Technology looms large in the lives of game designers. And just as it is 
hard to study the stars when the sun is out, it is hard to study game design when 
technology is in the room. Technology is ever novel and ever surprising and ever 
presents new puzzles to solve. Of the four elements in the tetrad (technology, story, 
aesthetics, and mechanics), technology is the most dynamic, most volatile, and 
most unpredictable. It’s like having a drunken billionaire show up at your party—
all eyes are on him because no one knows what he might do. Well, at long last, it is 
time for us to plunge into the sun, to introduce ourselves to this drunken billionaire.
So, what is technology, anyway? Do we just mean computers and electronics? 
No… we mean something much broader. For a game designer, “technology” means 
the very medium of our game—the physical objects that make it possible. For 
Monopoly, the technology is a board, slips of paper, tokens, and dice. For hopscotch, 
it is a piece of chalk and a sidewalk. For Tetris, it is a computer, a screen, and a 
simple input device. Saying that technology is just the physical things our game is 
made of might seem obvious, but this idea has deep implications, because of how 
technology advances at such a rapid rate. Consider how many physical things have 
been invented since you were born. Ten thousand? A hundred thousand? A million? 
There are so many; it is hard to say for sure. But many of these new inventions can 

451
Foundational vs. Decorational
be used to make new kinds of games. And this is important because the quest of 
the game designer is forever a quest for the new. As we’ve said before, people buy 
new games because they are new. Because of this pressure for novelty and the sexi­
ness of new technology, it can be easy to get swept away in the possibilities of what 
technology can do and forget that our purpose is to create a great game.
Keeping your head about this, and not getting drunk along with the billionaire, 
can be a challenge for some people. Engineers, in particular, have a natural love of 
technology and are especially prone to its siren song. Walt Disney had very strong 
feelings about this, and in the landmark book, The Illusion of Life, animators Frank 
Thomas and Ollie Johnson relate that
For some reason, [Walt] had a distrust of engineers as men who designed pri­
marily for themselves without regard to the intended use of the product, and he 
refused to have anyone on the staff with the title, “Engineer.”
This is an extreme position, of course, but it underlines the importance of keep­
ing a level head about the place of technology in the experience on you are creating.
Foundational vs. Decorational
One of the most concrete ways to keep a sane perspective about technology is to 
understand the difference between foundational and decorational technologies. 
Foundational technologies are the ones that make a new kind of experience pos­
sible. Decorational technologies just make existing experiences better. I find that 
this illustration helps to make it clear:
The cake part of the cupcake is foundational technology. Without it, there couldn’t 
be a cupcake. The cherry and the icing are decorational technology. Adding them 
doesn’t make something fundamentally new; it just makes something old a little 
nicer. Perhaps some examples from entertainment and games will help make this 
even clearer.

Mickey’s First Cartoon
A common trivia question often pops up on quiz shows: “What was Mickey Mouse’s 
first cartoon?” And most of us know the answer: Steamboat Willie. And most of 
us, it turns out, are wrong. Steamboat Willie was predated by Plane Crazy, another 
Mickey cartoon that was released six  months earlier. What was so remarkable 
about Steamboat Willie that it is universally remembered as Mickey’s premiere? 
Technology. Specifically, Steamboat Willie was the first cartoon to feature synchro­
nized sound. And the sound was not decorational—the entire cartoon was designed 
around having a synchronized soundtrack. The storyline in Steamboat Willie pri­
marily features Mickey and Minnie playing various farm animals as if they were 
musical instruments. It was cute, clever, and catchy, and without synchronized 
sound, it would have made no sense whatever. The technology was foundational to 
the experience the cartoon created. Later, synchronized sound was added to Plane 
Crazy, but it was decorational: the sounds of growling airplane engines did little to 
change the fundamental experience of the cartoon.
Abalone

28.3

453
Foundational vs. Decorational
A low-tech example of an interesting foundational technology can be seen in 
Abalone, a board game invented in 1987 by Laurent Levi and Michel Lalet. The 
game board looks like the familiar game of Chinese checkers, but it has an impor­
tant difference: grooves between the holes make it possible to grab one marble 
and push it so that it pushes a whole row of other marbles along the grooves, 
so they “clunk” into the next holes. Most head-to-head games like this feature 
game mechanics based on capturing an opponent’s piece by landing on it or by 
jumping over it. Levi and Lalet realized that a board that allowed for pushing 
could feature a brand new mechanic, and so they designed a game where you 
capture a piece by shoving it off the board. The grooves were not a complicated 
technology, but they served as the foundation for a game experience that was 
completely new.
Sonic the Hedgehog
The Sonic the Hedgehog and Sonic the Hedgehog 2 games for the Sega Genesis were 
powerful examples of foundational technology. Sega knew that one of the key dif­
ferentiators between the Sega Genesis console and the competition, Super Nintendo, 
was that Sega’s system had an architecture that supported incredibly fast scrolling. 
The Sonic games (especially Sonic 2 with its lightning-fast spin dash) were designed 
expressly to exploit this ability. Players had never before played a game that fea­
tured such incredibly fast movement, and this is part of what made the games feel 
exciting and new.
Myst
It is hard today to comprehend how successful Myst was in the marketplace. It 
was the top selling PC game every month for five consecutive years. Yow. Anyway, 
this success came because of a mix of foundational and decorational technologies. 
The first technology was decorational: gorgeous 3D artwork. At the time (1993), 
computer-generated 3D artwork was something of a novelty. It had a look that was 
otherworldly and new. But to deliver these pretty pictures in a game required a 
more foundational technology: the CD-ROM drive. Before the CD-ROM, the detail 
of imagery in games was mostly limited to pixel art. The CD-ROM made possible 
games full of glorious images of photographic quality. And Cyan (the makers of 
Myst) took this very seriously. When CD-ROM drives first came out, they could 
be very flaky. There were many different manufacturers, many different drivers, 
and many ways for the software to fail. Cyan made a conscious choice to spend 
development time making sure their game ran on every possible CD-ROM/PC 

454
CHAPTER Twenty-Eight • THE TEAM BUILDS A GAME WITH TECHNOLOGY
combination—time that some on the team would rather have spent giving the 
game a more elaborate ending. But it would seem they made the right decision—
for years, nearly everyone who bought a CD-ROM drive for their home bought a 
copy of Myst, because they heard it was beautiful, and unlike many other CD-ROM 
games, this one was guaranteed to work.
Journey
In the early 1980s, engineers at Bally Midway had a great idea for a new videogame 
technology: why not put a digital camera onto an arcade machine, so that players 
who got a high score could do more than just enter their initials—they could pose 
for a picture! They built a prototype that would take black and white digital photos 
of winners and tried it out in a Chicago arcade. In what may have been the first 
instance of griefing, they were shocked to visit it the next day to find that several 
of the winners had “flashed” the camera, making their high score list an exhibit 
of low-res pornography. No one could think of a way to solve this problem, so the 
management put a halt to further development on the project. But the team didn’t 
give up so easily. They had put a lot of work into the technology and wanted to see 
something come from it. The result was Journey: The Arcade Game, a basic platform 
game that featured members of the rock band Journey as avatars. These avatars 
were very strange looking, having tiny cartoon bodies and grossly large heads that 
were black and white photos of the band members. The technology, which started 
as something more foundational, ended up as something purely decorational and a 
pretty ugly decoration at that. The fancy technology could not save a boring game, 
and it flopped.
Ragdoll Physics
A more modern example can be seen when considering the technology of “rag­
doll physics.” Ragdoll physics is a method of manipulating real-time animated 
characters so that their bodies can realistically interact with other elements in 
the game world in a way that is not prescripted. Put another way, if you pick up 
a game character by the arm and shake him around, his limbs will flop around 
realistically, with the movements completely calculated by the computer—no ani­
mator required. This has been used in countless first-person shooter games as 
a purely decorational technology: an NPC gets hit with a grenade, and his body 
flops through the air and onto the ground, using the mathematics of real-time 
physics to compute the motion. Even though sometimes it doesn’t look right (the 
bodies have bad interaction with some types of terrain), it is a minor novelty and 
the engineers love it.
Contrast that use with how the same algorithms are used in the game Ico. 
Ico was a landmark in storytelling games, partly because of the novelty of the 

455
The Hype Cycle
interaction between the main character Ico and the princess he is trying to rescue. 
For most of the game, Ico must lead the princess around by the hand, helping her 
through all kinds of dangerous perils. Because of the way the princess follows Ico, 
responding to every tug of his hand as he runs, climbs, and jumps, she seems alive 
in a way that is completely new and different. Most of the puzzles in the game are 
based on the fact that Ico has to lead the princess around, which would be impos­
sible without these algorithms. The engineers and designers behind Ico found a 
way to take a technology that had been used purely as a decoration and turn it 
into the foundation of a game experience the world had never encountered before.
As these examples show, it is a good habit, when encountering a new technology, 
to ask yourself, “How can I make this foundational to my game?”
The Touch Revolution
When touch games first appeared, on platforms like the Nintendo DS and the 
iPhone, many gamers complained loudly. A touchable screen was poor substitute 
for a gamepad—that is, when it tried to mimic a gamepad. Soon, games started to 
appear that wouldn’t have been possible without touch (such as Cooking Mama on 
the DS or Cut the Rope on iOS), and people felt very differently. It’s always the same 
story: new technology appears, and people say there is no point to it. That is, until 
someone designs for it.
The Hype Cycle
Another good way to ward off the intoxicating effects of technology is to understand 
the pattern of that intoxication. This is best described through a model created by 
Gartner Research, which they refer to as the Hype Cycle.

The Hype Cycle.

456
CHAPTER Twenty-Eight • THE TEAM BUILDS A GAME WITH TECHNOLOGY
The preceding graph represents visibility (the number of people talking about it) 
over time. Gartner suggests that every new technology goes through five phases 
of hype:
	1.	 Technology trigger: This is when the technology is first discovered or announced.
	2.	 Peak of inflated expectations: This is when many more people are talking about 
the technology than have actually experienced it. In other words, “nobody knows 
what it’s really like, but everyone says it’s great.” Companies launching a product 
(like, say, the new iPhone) try to make the most of this quirk of human nature 
to believe that a new technology will make your dreams come true, though this 
never seems to actually happen.
	3.	 Trough of disillusionment: When the technology can’t live up to the incredible 
hype that surrounded it (like, say, the Segway) and people see it in the cold, 
harsh light of reality, it quickly becomes unfashionable, even despised.
	4.	 Slope of enlightenment: Gradually, people and businesses start to figure out the 
areas where the technology is actually useful and beneficial.
	5.	 Plateau of productivity: At this point, the benefits of the technology are widely 
understood and accepted. The height of this plateau is dependent on how broadly 
useful the technology really is.
The funny thing about the Hype Cycle is that it happens every time. Somehow, 
people never seem to learn, and they repeat the same silly behaviors again and 
again: assuming the “new thing” will be life changing, hating it when it isn’t, and 
eventually using it for the things it is good at. As a game designer, you need to know 
about the Hype Cycle for three big reasons:
	1.	 Immunity: If you are aware of the Hype Cycle, you can make yourself immune to 
its effects and not risk your career on a technology you haven’t actually seen work.
	2.	 Inoculation: Chances are good that at some point you are going to find your­
self surrounded by people who have bought into the hype on some crazy new 
technology, and they will want you to design a game around it. If you can make 
them understand about the Hype Cycle, you may be able to save your team from 
making a dangerous decision.
	3.	 Fund-raising: There is no pretty way to say this. At some point, you are going 
to have an opportunity to pitch a design to someone who is fully under the spell 
of inflated expectations, and they are going to be willing to fund your game not 
because of its merits but because they believe that the technological bandwagon 
they are jumping on is going to make them very rich. You can try to persuade 
them of the truth, but it won’t work. The trick is to get the money before the 
trough of disillusionment and then to make something great, despite the tech­
nology. If you can do this, it will be a roller coaster ride, but you will get the 
game made.

457
The Innovator’s Dilemma
It can be very interesting to look back at the launch of different games and game 
systems and think about their Hype Cycles. I’ll leave that as an exercise to the 
reader, though, because we have a dilemma to discuss.
The Innovator’s Dilemma
Another pattern anyone working with new technologies needs to be aware of is the 
innovator’s dilemma (see Figure 28.5), from the book of the same name by Clayton 
Christensen. The basic idea is that technology companies often fail because they 
make the mistake of listening to their customers. This sounds counterintuitive—as 
we’ve discussed, listening to the people who play your games is very important. 
But Christensen is talking about a very specific situation: where a new technology 
has appeared that is different and not yet good enough to replace the old one. If you 
ask your customers what they think of the new technology, they will say “not good 
enough.” As a result, you might choose to ignore this new technology and focus on 
making gradual improvements to your old one. But that new technology is gradu­
ally improving, too. And suddenly, almost overnight, the new technology will cross 
some threshold into the realm of “good enough,” and all the customers of the old 
technology will suddenly jump ship for this new “disruptive technology” that is 
faster, better, and cheaper.
We’ve seen this in videogames many times. Makers of retail PC games did not 
take console gaming seriously for years—consoles just weren’t “good enough.” And 
then, suddenly, they were. And in less than a year, PC games went from being 
mainstream to being fringe. Motion controllers have been around for twenty years, 
but they were always considered too expensive or not reliable enough. As a result, 
most console manufacturers didn’t take them seriously. But then, after a series

CHAPTER Twenty-Eight • THE TEAM BUILDS A GAME WITH TECHNOLOGY
of gradual improvements and innovations, Nintendo released the Wiimote, with a 
clever motion controller that was “good enough,” and nearly took over the console 
market in the process. And right now, technologies like speech recognition, artifi­
cial intelligence (AI), brainwave sensing, and many more are ignored because they 
aren’t “good enough” for games. If you can manage to design games for technolo­
gies that are on the verge of “breaking through,” you can ride a wave of success that 
no one else saw coming—provided, of course, the technologies are foundational!
The Law of Divergence
One repeated error that comes up again and again when people try to predict the 
future of technology: they assume that technologies will converge and unify. For 
example, many people predict that one day soon you’ll have one device in your 
living room that will play all your videos, music, and games. But think about how 
many remote controls are in your living room. Three or four, yes? Of course, you 
used to have just one—but as technology advanced, the number of devices mul­
tiplied. Why? Because it always does. Different technologies advance at different 
rates, and so we have different devices, because if they were all glued together into 
one big TV/computer/music/videoplayer/game console, you’d have to replace the 
whole thing every time there was one new feature. Instead, technologies constantly 
diverge as they evolve, like fish in the Galapagos islands. By having them as sepa­
rate devices, you can mix and match and be ready for whatever shows up next. 
This will surely continue for videogames as we continue to develop more and more 
interesting new input and output systems for playing games.
There is an exception to the law of divergence, though: the pocket. Things we 
carry in our pockets (such as swiss army knives and smartphones) tend to have a 
convergence of technologies, for convenience. The pocket exception is important for 
games, as well, but it is well to remember it is just that: an exception.
The Singularity
We’ve all noticed how technology presses into our lives ever more strongly with 
each passing year. Without a doubt, the pace of technological progress is not just 
increasing, it is accelerating. As it does so, it becomes more and more difficult to 
predict the future. A thousand years ago, you could make a pretty good guess at 
what daily life would be like one hundred years in the future. Now it is difficult 
for us to make guesses at life just ten years in the future. Some people theorize 
that as technology continues to accelerate, soon we won’t be able to make predic­
tions about what life will be like a year away, a month away, or eventually in the 
next ten minutes. The moment where technological progress is so fast that we can 
make no predictions whatsoever is called the singularity, and some predict it will 
arrive in our lifetimes.

459
Look into Your Crystal Ball
This may sound farfetched, but there is no doubt that the rapid pace of tech­
nological change is good news for game designers, since new technologies mean 
new game possibilities. Further, it is not out of the question that our techniques of 
developing engaging virtual worlds, now considered merely an amusing pastime, 
may blossom into something central to the nature of human experience if the tech­
nologies for creating and experiencing virtual realities take sudden leaps forward.
Technology is the medium of your game and one of the four cornerstones of 
game design. Use this handy lens to examine your technological choices carefully.
Look into Your Crystal Ball
It is far better to foresee without certainty than not to foresee at all.
—Henri Poincare
To the blind, all things are sudden.
—Anonymous
One effect of rapid technological change is that people get so caught up trying to 
understand the new technology that is here now; they stop thinking about what 
is coming next. Weary with so much innovation, they have given up on trying 
to predict the future, believing it to be too difficult. This is to your tremendous 
advantage—for a great deal of what is to come can be guessed at, if you sit down 
and carefully think it through. And what a benefit to you, the designer, if you can 
guess right! You’ll be able to prepare for trends and developments that no one else 
saw coming, except you, because you used logic and reason to see what was com­
ing before it arrived. You won’t always get it right, of course, but each time you 
get it wrong, you’ll realize why, and it will make you a better predictor next time. 
Lens #104: The Lens of Technology
To make sure you are using the right technologies in the right way, ask your­
self these questions:
●
●
What technologies will help deliver the experience I want to create?
●
●
Am I using these technologies in ways that are foundational or decorational?
●
●
If I’m not using them foundationally, should I be using them at all?
●
●
Is this technology as cool as I think it is?
●
●
Is there a “disruptive technology” I should consider instead?

CHAPTER Twenty-Eight • THE TEAM BUILDS A GAME WITH TECHNOLOGY
The very act of trying to predict the future can change the way you see the world. 
Give it a try with some of these examples:
●
●
What will living room gaming be like in four years? How will it differ from what 
we have now?
●
●
How about eight years from now?
●
●
Two years from now, what percentage of games will be downloaded, as opposed 
to being loaded from a disk or cartridge? Why? How about five years from now?
●
●
Will tablets ever become the dominant gaming platform? Why or why not?
●
●
What will the next trend in massively multiplayer games be? Why?
●
●
What will small game studios be working on four years from now?
●
●
What will large game studios be working on four years from now?
●
●
How will sports games be different four years from now?
●
●
How will first-person shooters be different four years from now?
●
●
How will the genre of your choice be different four years from now?
●
●
What new genres might appear in the next four years? Why?
Answering questions like this can be tough. It helps if you discuss them with others. 
As you do so, you’ll find yourself plotting out things that are likely to happen and 
using those certainties as a scaffolding for your less confident predictions. It is not 
the predictions themselves that will be valuable to you, but rather the scaffolding that 
you create to make them. You will develop not just an instinct about technology but 
also how it fits with the human mind, for knowledge of both is necessary to predict 
the future, or as I like to say, technology+psychology=destiny. Further, attempts to 
predict the future often force you to examine historical trends, which give you insights 
that you can really use, and that are often correct. I’ve created a YouTube channel 
that you can find at http://crystalballsociety.com where I collect videos of myself and 
others making concrete predictions about the future. I’d love to include yours! With 
practice, trying to predict the future of technology won’t seem like such hard work 
and will start to become habitual. And who doesn’t want to see into the future?
Lens #105: The Lens of the Crystal Ball
If you would like to know the future of a particular game technology, ask 
yourself these questions, and make your answers as concrete as possible:

●
 What will ____ be like two years from now? Why?
●
●
 What will ____ be like four years from now? Why?
●
●
 What will ____ be like ten years from now? Why?

Look into Your Crystal Ball
Before we move on, we should take a moment to consider why it is that people 
get so excited about technology. Certainly, as we discussed in Chapter 16, “Interest 
Curves,” the potential for dramatic change that technology offers is going to be 
naturally interesting. But there is something more. There is something that technol­
ogy offers that every human being who ever lived has sought: utopia. A desire for 
utopia is something we all have in common. The dream of a perfect world is the 
driving force behind so much: schools, churches, governments, laws, inventions, 
Internet start-ups, health-care plans, revolutions, nonprofit organizations, books, 
art, and, yes, video games. In some ways especially video games. After all, what is it 
that we promise? Not just games, but whole worlds—worlds that are more exciting, 
more beautiful, and more fair than this one. Viewed this way, it is no wonder there 
is such a Hype Cycle around what we create. Players expect nothing less than for 
us to lead them to utopia. And when do they stop caring about our new games and 
systems, as it sometimes happens? It means they have lost their faith in us—that 
they no longer believe we know the way.
This is why it is of the utmost importance that when you choose new technolo­
gies, you choose the ones most likely to lead to a better world. At this point in time, 
I believe that these five types of technology have the best chance of fulfilling that 
dream.
	1.	 Magical interfaces: Intuitive interfaces are not enough; players want interfaces 
that feel magical. The success of the iPhone and iPad was largely centered on 
that magical feeling. One can debate the overall value of the Microsoft Kinect 
system, but no one can debate the millions of units that were purchased by play­
ers eager to try out a magical new interface.
	2.	 Fair payment: The models for how videogames are purchased have changed 
radically over the last decade, as many experiments have taken place. And 
still, players don’t find the systems we have for selling games to feel entirely 
fair. If you can come up with a system that players find fair, while still sustain­
ing your ability to create great games, players and developers alike will follow 
your lead.
	3.	 Less A, more I: That is, AI that feels less artificial. One of the broken promises of 
the computer revolution was computers that would think and communicate like 
humans. We’re still a long way off—but the technology that will get there first 
will be gaming, because our AI doesn’t have to be perfect, but it just has to be 
interesting. We are well poised for a decade of fascinating game AI developments 
that will capture the world’s imagination.
	4.	 Family and friends: As we’ve said, people generally don’t play games to be alone. 
They’d usually rather play them with family and friends. And while we have 
some games that work well for some relationships, there are so many oppor­
tunities that have been missed. Where are the games that a husband and wife 
will delightedly play together, night after night? Where are the games that put 
a whole family on a quest? Where are the games that let children connect with 

462
CHAPTER Twenty-Eight • THE TEAM BUILDS A GAME WITH TECHNOLOGY
their remote grandparents? The success of games like Words with Friends begins 
to point the way, but so many opportunities remain.
	5.	 Transformation: People play games for light amusement, yes—but what if you 
could make games that help people change into the people they truly want to be, 
transforming them mentally, physically, and spiritually? This is hard to deliver, 
but there is great demand for it, as the success of things like the Wii Fit and 
Lumosity has shown. If you choose technologies that help people improve them­
selves, you will undoubtedly be leading us to a better world.
The notion of utopia through games is an important, though counterintuitive, idea. 
Carry this lens like a torch to help you light the way.
My, what beautiful dreams. I need to wake you up, though—the client just walked in.

Lens #106: The Lens of Utopia
To be sure you are headed toward a better world, ask yourself these questions:
●
●
Am I creating something that feels magical?
●
●
Do people get excited just hearing about what I am making? Why or why 
not?
●
●
Does my game advance the state of the art in a meaningful way?

●
Does my game make the world a better place?

Who Cares What the Client Thinks?
In a perfect world, you, as a game designer, would only have to worry about pleas­
ing two groups of people: (1) your team and (2) your players.
But this is not a perfect world, and in most cases, there is someone else you have 
to think about: your client.
Sometimes this client is a game publisher, sometimes it is a media company 
that holds the rights to a popular franchise, and sometimes it is just someone with 
no entertainment experience who has decided they need a game for some reason. 
Clients come in all shapes and sizes.
Why do you care what the client thinks? Well, unless you are making your game as 
a hobby or you are independently wealthy, the client is probably paying you to make 
the game. And if they don’t like the way things are going, it’s literally game over.
Now, you might expect that the client views you as an expert—after all, the cli­
ent can’t make the game themselves—that’s why they came to you. And, naturally, 
you might then assume that the client respects your opinions about what is going 
to make the best game.
And sometimes that happens.
Or so I have heard.
But most of the time, your client is going to have very strong opinions about how 
the game should look, act, and play. And rightly so—they are paying for it, after 
all. Your ability to deal with these opinions is critical, and here is why. There are 
two kinds of game designers in the world: happy ones and cranky ones. The happy 
ones are either independently wealthy or good at dealing with the strong opinions 
of their clients. The cranky ones are not good at dealing with these strong opinions. 
This might sound glib, but I’m quite serious—your ability to build bridges of com­
promise that delight both you and your client is possibly the single greatest indica­
tor of whether you will be happy as a game designer in the long term.
But why? What’s so bad about the strong opinions of a client? What if the client 
has smart opinions? This can happen—sometimes clients have opinions that are 
very thoughtful and wise—and it’s a wonderful thing. But there are other times 
when the client will have opinions that are so idiotic, so foolish, and so hypocritical 
that it beggars belief. Some of the stupidest things you will ever hear in your life 

465
Coping with Bad Suggestions
will come out of your client’s mouth, and somehow, you will have to deal with that. 
And a lot is riding on how you do: your relationship with the client, your reputation 
as a designer, your happiness, and your game.
Coping with Bad Suggestions
Many designers, when they get a bad suggestion from a client, freeze like a deer in 
headlights, terrified of what to say. There are three ways to deal with this:
	1.	 Agree to the bad suggestion, for fear of displeasing the client. This is a disservice 
to your client and your game.
	2.	 Immediately tell the client why their suggestion is bad, so the client will be 
impressed with how wise you are. This usually backfires.
	3.	 Try to understand why the client is making this suggestion.
Response number three is the right answer. When someone makes a bad sug­
gestion, it doesn’t mean they are dumb—it just means they are trying to help. And 
most of the time, when one of these bad suggestions comes up, it is a solution to an 
unstated problem. This is a perfect time to pull out our old friend, Lens #14, Problem 
Statement! Because if you can figure out what problem the client is trying to solve 
with their suggestion, perhaps you can come up with a solution that does a better 
job of solving the problem, and the client will be thrilled.
As an example, there was once a racing game that was about halfway through 
development when the client came in for a review. After toying with the prototype 
for a few minutes, he looked at the team and said, “These cars need more chrome.” 
The lead artist looked at the designer in a panic—the models were mostly complete 
and had been approved by the client months ago. The lead engineer was similarly 
panicked—the performance was tough as it was and adding shiny chrome meant 
more drain on an already overworked CPU.
The designer could have said “Yes,” and he could have said “No,” but instead he 
said the only wise thing: “Why? Why do they need more chrome?” And the client’s 
response was surprising: “Well, as I was playing, I kind of felt like the cars weren’t 
as fast as they should be. I know changing the car speeds would probably be a lot of 
work for you guys, so I was just thinking that if you just put more chrome on the cars, 
it would make them look faster.” Now, this might sound like some pretty strange logic, 
but set that aside, and take note that the client was only trying to help! In fact, the team 
had the same feeling that the cars felt too slow and were going to bring that up. Their 
solution was a combination of making the cars move faster (easy) and lowering the 
camera viewpoint to make the perceived motion faster. They were able to make the 
changes with the client standing right there. He was thrilled to see the improvement 
and also pleased to understand a little more about how a racing game is put together.
This was a straightforward case of The Lens of the Problem Statement saving the 
day. People’s brains work fast, and they tend to jump to solutions before they even 

466
CHAPTER Twenty-Nine • YOUR GAME WILL PROBABLY HAVE A CLIENT
are sure what problem they are solving. Most bad suggestions can be resolved by 
the magic words “What problem are you trying to solve?”
Not That Rock
A completely different way that clients drive designers crazy is by the opposite of 
strong opinions: not knowing what they want. This is sometimes known as the 
game of “Not That Rock.” It works like this:
Client: Bring me a rock.
Designer: Okay, how about this one?
Client: No, not that rock.
Designer: Oh. Uh, how’s this?
Client: No, not that one, either.
(Repeat two hundred times.)
After ten or twenty rounds of this game, designers often become frustrated, shout­
ing to anyone who will listen, “I can’t believe this client! They have no idea what 
they want!” And that may well be true. But, really, if they knew exactly what they 
wanted, wouldn’t the game already be designed? A big part of the designer’s job 
is to help the client figure out what they want. This is just like listening to your 
audience—you must get to know the client better than he knows himself. Here’s 
the right way to play “Bring Me a Rock”:
Client: Bring me a rock.
Designer: What kind of rock?
Client: I’m not sure… I don’t know much about rocks.
Designer: Well, what are you going to do with it?
Client: Oh… I was going to put it by my driveway and paint a house number 
on it.
Designer: Ah… I think I know a good one… Let me bring you a few to choose from.
When you can manage to help a client figure out what they actually want, you are 
engaging in the design process and, at the same time, you are empowering your client 
by giving him an education he needs. If you play the game right, the client will come 
away feeling smart, and you will have designed a game that meets his needs perfectly.
The Three Layers of Desire
To really give your client what they want, you have to understand what is important 
to them—you have to care about what they care about and think how they think. 
Doing your homework to learn about the client, both personally and professionally, 

467
Firenze, 1498
is time well spent. Do they care more about striking it rich quickly or slowly building 
a reputation for good games? Are they looking to get into a new market or to capital­
ize on an existing one? What do they think makes a good game? You can learn a lot 
about a client just by talking to them and asking what they want—but keep in mind 
that people don’t always tell the truth. When trying to figure out what a client wants, 
keep in mind that everyone has three layers of desire: words, mind, and heart.
For example, a client might come to you and say, with her words: “I want you to 
make a game for the Rittenhouse Foundation. The game needs to teach algebra to 
eighth graders.”
But in her mind, she might be keeping a secret: “Actually, I want to make a 
space-themed game that teaches geometry. I’ve got it all planned out how it should 
work. I’m only going along with this algebra thing because the Rittenhouse people 
think it’s important.”
But in her heart, she might be thinking something else entirely: “I’m tired of 
being the financial person. I want people to see I have a creative side.”
Now, if you simply took her at her word, you might find, as the project proceeds, 
that she is fighting you on it and that she is taking it in directions that seem opposed 
to what the funders want, and overall, her behavior is quite strange. But if you are 
able to learn what is in her mind and, even better, her heart, you can possibly incor­
porate elements from this game she has been imagining and maybe find other ways 
to let her contribute creative ideas or at least take credit for them. If you are very 
clever, you can probably find a way to fulfill all three layers of desire—this is not a 
trivial thing, for when you have fulfilled someone’s heart’s desire, you may find you 
have a friend for life.
Firenze, 1498
I’d like to close this chapter with one of my favorite stories about dealing with cli­
ents. It happened in Florence, Italy, during the Renaissance. The city, years earlier, 
had purchased a very large, fine piece of marble for a sculpture, but an inexpert 
sculptor had set to work on it and gouged a great hole in the marble. The city 
lost confidence and fired him, and the great piece of marble deteriorated in the 
cathedral yard, exposed to the elements for many years. But in 1498, the mayor, 
Piero Soderini, went on a crusade to have something carved from the marble. He 
approached Leonardo da Vinci, but Leonardo had no interest in working with a 
damaged piece of marble. Besides, he remembered how the previous sculptor had 
been treated and wasn’t interested in getting the same shabby treatment. But one 
sculptor did come forward—a young man of twenty-six named Michelangelo. The 
mayor was skeptical that someone so young would be qualified, but Michelangelo 
brought a prototype with him: a model made of wax that showed how he would 
carefully arrange the legs of the figure to deal with the fact that the marble was 
both thin and badly gouged. Soderini and the commissioners were impressed and 
awarded Michelangelo the commission to create a statue of David.

468
CHAPTER Twenty-Nine • YOUR GAME WILL PROBABLY HAVE A CLIENT
One day, as the statue was nearing completion, the mayor decided to drop by to 
see how the work was going. The statue of David is very large, fourteen feet tall. 
This means that to work on it, Michelangelo had to surround it with scaffolding. 
As Michelangelo was working away high on the scaffold, Soderini came inside the 
scaffolding for a clear view. Fancying himself an expert, he told Michelangelo that 
the statue was good, but clearly, the nose was too large.
It was obvious to Michelangelo that Soderini was standing far too close to the 
statue for a proper viewing angle, because, after all, everyone’s nose looks too 
big when you look straight up at it. But it was also obvious that Soderini’s words 
were not telling the whole story—he had deeper layers of desire. Instead of trying 
to give Soderini a lesson in perspective, Michelangelo invited him to climb up the 
scaffold where the two of them could fix the nose together. As Soderini was climb­
ing, Michelangelo scooped up a little bit of marble dust in his pinky finger. When 
Soderini was at a proper viewing angle, Michelangelo put his chisel near the nose, 
gave it a few pretend taps with his hammer, and dropped the dust from his pinky 
to make it look like actual sculpting was in progress. After a couple minutes of this, 
Michelangelo stepped away and said, “Look at it now.” “I like it better,” replied 
Soderini, “you’ve made it come alive!”
This may seem like a cruel trick on Soderini. But was it? Clearly he came that 
day because he wanted some ownership of the statue—he wanted to be a creative 
partner. And he came away feeling he was. After this, if someone were then to 
criticize the statue, you can be sure that Soderini would be the first to come to its 
defense. I tell this story not to suggest that you lie to your clients, but rather to 
underline the importance of finding ways for them to feel like creative partners 
on your game. It is possible to do this without compromising your creative vision. 
Always keep in mind that the client has more to offer than just funding. It may 
be connections, business expertise, or a special understanding of the audience for 
your game. You will find that if you listen to your clients—truly, deeply, listen to 
them—they will listen to you.
Lens #107: The Lens of the Client
If you are making a game for someone else, you should probably know what 
they want. Ask yourself these questions:
●
●
What does the client say he wants?
●
●
What does the client think he wants?
●
●
What does the client really want, deep down in his heart?

CHAPTER Thirty • THE DESIGNER GIVES THE CLIENT A PITCH
Why Me?
If you are going to get someone to fund your game, publish your game, or distribute 
your game, you are going to have to convince them that your game is worth the 
risk, and this means pitching your game. You might be thinking, “Why me? Isn’t 
it enough that I’m designing it? Couldn’t someone else do this?” But, really, who 
is more qualified than you? The artists? The engineers? The management? As the 
game’s designer, you should know the game and why it is great better than anyone 
else. And if you don’t believe in your game enough to get up in front of people and 
sing its praises, then why should anyone else believe in it?
So, who will you pitch to, and when? It depends a lot on your situation. Part-
time indie devs will have different pitch requirements than full-time developers 
in huge companies, but both will have to do a lot of pitching to make a success­
ful game. In the beginning, you’ll be pitching rough ideas to team members and 
potential partners. When the team has agreed on a general concept, you might 
be pitching to management or to funders to get approval to build a prototype. 
When the prototype is built, you might be pitching your game to publishers or 
to Kickstarter to get development funds. And during development, when you 
realize that the game has to change in some important way, you’ll be pitching 
those changes to almost everyone. After the game is done, you’ll need to pitch 
it to reporters at game conferences. Pitches can be big: “Here’s why I need $75M 
for my new AAA game idea.” Or it can be tiny: “Bob, here’s why the corners 
on the spaceship need to be more rounded.” If you are going to develop games, 
you will constantly need to persuade people about your ideas, and you will 
constantly be in a position where you have to get people of every discipline and 
background to stand together behind an idea. The highest-pressure pitches are 
the ones where you are trying to get funding for the game, so this chapter will 
focus a little more on those.
A Negotiation of Power
Before we get into the specifics of putting together a good pitch, we should take a 
moment to understand exactly what a pitch is. And to understand that, it is neces­
sary to understand what power is. Power does not have to be about wealth or con­
trolling people, although it can be about those things. Power is simply the ability to 
get what you want. If you can get what you want, you are powerful. If you can’t get 
what you want, you are powerless.
But notice that our definition of power has two parts: “the ability to get” and 
“what you want.” Most people focus entirely on the first part, the ability to get. But 
the second part, what you want, is equally important. For if you don’t know what 
you want, you will find yourself continually grasping and never satisfied. But if you 
know what you want, you can focus your efforts much more effectively toward 
getting it, and in doing so, you will become powerful.

473
Twelve Tips for a Successful Pitch
And when you pitch your game, you are entering into a negotiation of power, 
where you are going to try to get what you want, while you convince someone else 
that your game is going to help them get what they want. For this reason, the foun­
dation of any successful pitch is knowing what you want and knowing what they 
want, which can be kind of complicated, keeping in mind that you each have three 
layers of desire.
The Hierarchy of Ideas
Novice designers will frequently be heard to complain, “I can’t believe it! I pitched 
this really cool idea, and no one was interested! What is wrong with people?” The 
answer is that nothing is wrong with people—it is just that cool ideas have a pretty 
low value on the hierarchy of ideas shown here:
Type of Idea 
Description 
Value 
Idea
Just a plain old idea
$0.083 (dime a dozen)
Cool idea
An idea that captures the 
imagination
$5
Really cool idea
A cool idea, shouted
$5
Good idea
An idea that someone could 
actually use
$100
Good idea in the right 
place at the right time, 
sold convincingly
Just what it sounds like
$1,000,000+
I know that’s silly, but the point is that when you pitch an idea, it won’t be judged 
on its overall merit—it will be judged by how useful it is, right now, to the person you 
are pitching it to. Those are the ideas that land deals worth millions. When you pitch 
a good idea and it gets rejected, don’t grind your teeth—take it to someone who can 
use it, or put it in your back pocket so you have it ready when its time finally comes.
Twelve Tips for a Successful Pitch
So you’ve learned about who you are pitching to and have figured out a good idea that 
they can use now, and you even know what you want them to do for you. Now what?
Pitch Tip #1: Get in the Door
You can’t pitch your idea if you can’t get in the door. Some doors are easy to get into, 
some aren’t. Big game publishers can be very hard to get an audience with. They 

474
CHAPTER Thirty • THE DESIGNER GIVES THE CLIENT A PITCH
are like the prettiest girl at school, and they know it. They will often ignore e-mails 
and messages and cancel meetings with almost no warning. They have their pick 
of developers to work with, so unless you can convince them you have something 
pretty special, it can be hard to even get in the door, especially if you are using the 
front door; that is, “Uh, hello, is this Big Time Games? I have a game design I want 
to pitch… who should I talk to?”
A much better approach is to use the back door, if you can; that is, know some­
one on the inside who can vouch for you. A publisher who would ignore your e-mail 
won’t ignore the e-mail of someone he works with on a regular basis. I think it is 
safe to say that the majority of game deals happen this way—a developer and a pub­
lisher were introduced to each other by a mutual friend. This is why industry events 
like the Game Developers Conference and local International Game Developer 
Association (IGDA) meetings are so important—they help you build up networks of 
contacts so that when your pitch is ready, you can get in the door.
Even if you are just pitching someone within your company, though, the same 
principle applies. The people who have the most power to make decisions about 
schedule and budget are the busiest. They are much more likely to hear you out and 
take you seriously if they already know you, like you, and trust you.
Pitch Tip #2: Show You Are Serious
When I worked at Walt Disney Imagineering, there was a remarkable event, held 
twice a year, called the Open Forum. It was an opportunity to pitch your brilliant 
idea to the top creative minds in charge of the Disney theme parks. Anyone at all 
in the entire organization was welcome to come and give their five-minute pitch to 
this panel of decision makers. They would then deliberate privately for five minutes 
and then give you five minutes of feedback. If they liked the idea, it would get taken 
to the next level and possibly get deployed in the parks! I loved the idea of getting a 
chance to pitch new ideas and would take advantage every time I could. Generally, 
I would be well prepared, but for one of the sessions, I just didn’t have the time. 
Instead of giving one fully fleshed out idea, I thought maybe I would come in with 
two less-fleshed-out ones. One was a fountain made of soap bubbles, and the other 
was a minicampfire for a restaurant so that guests could roast marshmallows right 
at their tables. When I presented these ideas, the panel had many questions. Would 
the fountain actually work? Would the minicampfire be safe? Had I built prototypes 
to answer these questions? I had to admit that I hadn’t. One panel member became 
indignant: “If you don’t care enough about these ideas to try them out, why should 
we?” It was humiliating, but he was absolutely right.
When you pitch a game, you have to show that you are serious about building 
it. It used to be that a developer could get a deal with a publisher just with a few 
sketches and a description of what the game would be like. That kind of deal is 
increasingly rare now—a working prototype is required in this day and age. But 
even a prototype is not enough—you need to show that you have given serious 

475
Twelve Tips for a Successful Pitch
thought to your game, its market, and how it works. This can be with a detailed 
design document (no one will read it, but they will weigh it) or, even better, with 
a clear presentation that details why the game will sell. Believing that your game 
could be fun isn’t enough—you must show you’ve done the work that proves your 
game will be fun and will monetize.
Pitch Tip #3: Be Organized
Organization is not a burden. Organization will set you free.
—Alton Brown
It’s real easy to fall into the “creative people aren’t organized” trap. Organization is 
just another way to show someone that you are serious. Also, the more organized 
you are, having just what you need at your fingertips, the more calm you’ll be, and 
the more in control you will be. A publisher is going to see an organized designer as 
a “lower-risk” designer, which will make them more likely to trust you.
So make sure your pitch is well planned. If you bring paper handouts, make sure 
they are easily accessible and that you have enough for everybody. If your presenta­
tion involves a computer, a projector, or (gulp) an Internet connection, make sure 
that they are really going to work—bring all the right cables, and get there early to 
test, just in case. I once scheduled a very important pitch with someone where we 
set a date but forgot to set a time! The day before I was scrambling to get in touch 
with them, to figure out if our meeting was still on and when exactly it would be! 
The whole thing was stressful, embarrassing, and unnecessary.
Pitch Tip #4: Be Passionate!!!!!
Unbelievably to me, I see pitches all the time where the person presenting seems 
kind of ambivalent about the game they are talking about. You want to get the 
people you are talking to excited about your game—to do that, you must be excited 
about your game! DO NOT try to fake this—it will come off completely phony. If you 
are actually, genuinely excited about your game when you talk about it, it will come 
through in the presentation, and it might even be infectious! And passion represents 
more than excitement—it also represents drive and commitment to deliver a quality 
game at any cost. Funders need to see this kind of commitment if they are going to 
entrust you with the necessary funding to produce your genius game.
Pitch Tip #5: Assume Their Point of View
In previous chapters, we’ve talked about the importance of listening to your 
audience, your game, and your team—the pitch is just one more occasion for 

476
CHAPTER Thirty • THE DESIGNER GIVES THE CLIENT A PITCH
listening. So often we assume that selling is all about us—if only we push hard 
enough, they’ll buy it. But no one likes to be confronted with a hard, pushy 
salesperson. What we like is when someone listens to us and tries to solve our 
problems. Your pitch should be all about that. Speak with the person you are 
going to pitch to in advance. Learn what you can about them, and make sure that 
the game you are planning to pitch is going to be a good fit for them—if it isn’t, 
don’t waste their time.
Even though you know the game you are pitching backward and forward, you 
must remember the person you are pitching to has never seen it before, so make 
sure you explain it in a way that they will easily understand—avoid jargon wher­
ever possible. Practice your pitch on friends and colleagues who aren’t familiar with 
the game idea to see if it makes sense to them.
Also remember that the person you are pitching to has probably seen hundreds 
of pitches and is very busy. Make sure that you don’t waste any time and get 
straight to the point. If they seem bored with a point you are making, pass over 
it and move on. If there is something they want more details about, they will ask 
questions.
One more way to assume the client’s point of view: consider the best-case sce­
nario. That is, they LOVE your pitch. Now what happens? In most cases, a deal can’t 
happen yet. The person you pitched to probably has to pitch it to colleagues or supe­
riors at their company. How easy have you made it for them? Here are the things 
that make it much easier for a “fan” of your project to pitch it to others:
●
●
Start by stating your platform, audience, and genre: Novice designers often 
want to keep people in suspense, unveiling what the game is halfway through 
the presentation. This is always a terrible idea. Tell them, right away, the plat­
form, the audience, and genre. If you don’t, they won’t hear a word you say 
because their minds will be obsessed with trying to figure out what kind of game 
this is so they can decide if they even care about it or not.
●
●
Do not begin by telling a story: I’m sure your story is great. But guess what? 
Lots of lousy games have great stories, and lots of great games have lousy stories. 
Instead of telling them the legendary backstory of the land of Nurl, pull out Lens 
#83, Fantasy, and tell them what fantasy the game fulfills.
●
●
Give your idea “handles”: That is, provide short phrases that summarize the 
idea: “It’s a bowling RPG!” “It’s Pokemon for grownups!” “It’s Nintendogs, with a 
whole zoo!” This will help them get the concept and make it easier for them to 
explain it to others.
●
●
Show, don’t tell: Got a working version? Great—show that! Even better, show a 
video that highlights the best features of it. If it’s too early in the process for that, 
at a minimum, create a slide show of what it is like to play the game. This is by 
far the best way to make them understand what you have in mind.

477
Twelve Tips for a Successful Pitch
●
●
Make it easy for them to pitch: Rarely are you pitching to someone who can 
independently make a final decision. Usually, the best case is that they love what 
you showed them and now they have to go convince their colleagues that it’s a 
good idea. Create pitch materials that speak for themselves, which don’t require 
you to be in the room giving a song and dance to be compelling. Arm them with 
key images, short videos, and self-explanatory bullet lists so that they can pitch 
it as well as you can.
Pitch Tip #6: Design the Pitch
The pitch is an experience, right? Why wouldn’t you design it at least as well as 
your game! Lots of lenses from this book will help you do it. Your pitch should be 
accessible, have surprises, have a good interest curve (a hook, a build, tense and 
release, a climax), etc. It should have a good aesthetic design, favoring images over 
words whenever possible. Your pitch should be elegant, focusing primarily on what 
is unique about your game, why it will succeed against the competition, and why 
it is a good fit for the person you are pitching it to. And whenever possible, your 
pitch should dazzle. Look for little ways you can impress them with flourishes of 
showmanship. Detailed animations, unexpected sound effects, humorous images, 
physical props, and anything else you can think of can help make it a great and 
memorable pitch. Even your venue can make a difference: I once had to pitch game 
about mummies to a publisher who was visiting New York City. I made arrange­
ments so that we could do the pitch in the Egyptian wing of the Metropolitan 
Museum of Art, in sight of actual mummies and tombs. The publisher was dazzled, 
and we got the project. If you can make even a simple PowerPoint presentation over­
flow with showmanship, it will give them confidence that you’ll do that and more 
when you make the game.
You should think through every moment that will happen during the entire pitch 
encounter. Will you have other team members there? When will you introduce 
them? When will you show your prototype? If you think that “overplanning” will 
spoil the energy of your pitch, you are wrong. You can always deviate from a plan if 
you want to, but having a plan will keep your mind free to focus on giving a great 
pitch, and you won’t have to worry about whether you have forgotten something 
important.
Pitch Tip #7: Know All the Details
During a pitch, you are going to get questions. Experienced, busy publishers aren’t 
going to wait until the end, either—they will break into your carefully planned 

478
CHAPTER Thirty • THE DESIGNER GIVES THE CLIENT A PITCH
presentation and ask detailed questions about the things they think are important. 
You need to have as many facts as possible at your fingertips. These include the 
following:
●
●
Design details: You should know your design inside and out. For parts of the 
design you’ve been putting off, you should at least have a guess. You should have 
confident answers for questions like “How many hours of gameplay?” “How long 
does it take to finish a level?” “How does multiplayer work?”
●
●
Schedule details: You need to know how long it will take to create the game and 
roughly how long it will take your team to get to each of the important milestones 
(design document completed, first playable prototype, first alpha, second alpha, 
beta, launch date, frequency of postlaunch updates). Make sure these times are 
realistic, or they will lose confidence in you fast. Be ready for the question: 
“What’s the fastest you could get this done?” Expect to be held to your answer.
●
●
Financial details: You should know what it will cost to get the game done. This 
means knowing how many people will be working on the game, how long they’ll 
be working on it, and other costs. Also expect the question: “How much money 
will this make?” You should probably base that answer on how comparable titles 
have monetized. Don’t just give one number—give what you think is a reason­
able range. Make ABSOLUTELY sure that the minimum number you give still 
makes the game a profitable venture.
●
●
Risks: You will be asked what the biggest risks on the project are. You need to 
be ready to state them clearly and succinctly, along with your plan for managing 
each one of them whether they are technical, gameplay, aesthetic, marketing, 
financial, or legal.
You also need to anticipate the questions that the people you are pitching to are 
going to ask. There is a legend about Imagineer Joe Rohde who was giving the final 
pitch of the Animal Kingdom theme park to Disney CEO Michael Eisner. Eisner had 
long wavered about whether this park was a good idea, and Joe was given his last 
chance to explain why it was. After Joe’s detailed presentation, Eisner said, “I’m 
sorry… I still don’t see what is so exciting about live animals.” Joe walked out of the 
meeting and returned, moments later, leading a Bengal tiger into the room. “This,” 
he declared, “is what is so exciting about live animals.” The theme park got its fund­
ing. When you can anticipate what questions are coming and give perfect answers, 
you can be magically persuasive.
Pitch Tip #8: Exude Confidence
While passion is important, confidence is just as important and not at all the same 
thing. Being confident means you are sure your game will be perfect for the client 
and that your team is the perfect team to pull it off. It means not getting shaken 

479
Twelve Tips for a Successful Pitch
when you get a tough question. It means knowing all the details. Keep in mind, 
you aren’t just selling the idea, you are selling yourself. If you seem nervous, it’s 
going to make people think you don’t believe what you are saying. When you show 
something impressive, you should act like it was nothing, like it was easy. If your 
other team members are with you, you should answer questions as a team with 
each confident about which questions the others can answer best.
And here is a magic word you can use when a tough question tries to shake your 
confidence: “Absolutely.” For questions like “Do you think this will sell in Europe?” 
“Can the servers handle the load?” “Can you make a kid’s version?” You might be 
thinking “yes” or “probably,” but I guarantee that “absolutely” will sound far more 
confident. Of course you need to back up that confident answer!
And a quick word about handshakes: if you aren’t sure you have a confident 
handshake, you need to practice until you do. Handshakes are a secret language 
of the subconscious, a system by which people (mainly men) assess personalities. 
Your words may sound confident, but if your handshake is not, it will cast doubt on 
everything you say. After all, if you can’t manage to be in sync with someone for two 
pumps and squeeze of the hand, how will the rest of the working relationship go?
But what if you don’t feel confident? What if you get really nervous talking in 
front of a group? The best thing to do is visualize a time when you were supremely 
confident. Putting yourself into that past moment will help you remember what 
confidence feels like and that you can be a confident person calmly in charge of an 
important situation.
Pitch Tip #9: Be Flexible
During your pitch, you are going to get curveballs. The person you are pitching to 
might suddenly reveal they hate your concept—what else do you have? You might 
have planned on a one-hour meeting only to be told “I only have twenty minutes.” You 
need to handle these kinds of things with coolness and confidence. Game designer 
Richard Garfield tells a story about how he went to a publisher to pitch RoboRally, 
an elaborate board game about robots in a factory. Garfield loved his game and 
gave a detailed pitch to a game publisher who sat patiently through it and then said, 
“I’m sorry, but we can’t use this. It’s too big. We’re looking for games that are small 
and portable. Got anything like that?” Garfield could have walked out, insulted, 
but instead he stayed objective and considered that his goal was to get a game pub­
lished—not necessarily this game. He mentioned that he was working on an idea 
for a new kind of card game—could he come back and present that? The game he 
pitched the second time eventually became the megahit Magic: The Gathering.
Pitch Tip #10: Rehearse
Planning your pitch is good; rehearsing it is better. The more you get comfort­
able talking about your game, the more natural your pitch will be. Look for any 

480
CHAPTER Thirty • THE DESIGNER GIVES THE CLIENT A PITCH
opportunity to practice—when your mother asks, “So, what have you been working 
on?” give her the pitch. Give it to your coworkers, to your hairdresser, or to your dog. 
It isn’t that the specific words of your pitch need to be memorized, but the chain of 
ideas needs to be able to spring forth naturally from you, like a favorite song.
If you are going to show a demo, rehearse that, too. Avoid, at all costs, pitching 
while you play! It makes you sound mentally deficient and wastes valuable time. 
Have a colleague play the game while you talk about it and answer questions. 
Unless they are excited about it, don’t expect executives to play your prototype. 
There is too much danger of them embarrassing themselves or crashing your proto­
type and embarrassing you.
Pitch Tip #11: Get Them to Own It
In Chapter 29, “Client,” we heard Michelangelo’s clever method of getting a client to 
own the project. But you don’t have to be so sneaky. Ideally, you want them to come 
away from your pitch thinking of the game as “their game.” Having an inside advo­
cate in the group you are pitching to really helps—someone who is presold on the 
concept and who will defend it to the others. Another way to improve the chances 
of them taking ownership is to integrate the ideas of the client into the pitch. If, 
in a previous conversation with them, they said “So, it’s a war game, huh? Does it 
have helicopters? I love helicopters!” you should be darn sure there are helicopters 
in your pitch somewhere. You can even integrate the client’s ideas on the fly, using 
concepts from their early questions (“Could it have giant rats?”) to explain things 
later in the pitch (“So, say you come upon a room full of giant rats…”). The easier 
you make it for them to imagine that it is their game, the closer they will be to 
accepting your proposal.
Pitch Tip #12: Follow Up
After your pitch, they will thank you and promise to get back to you. And they 
might—but they might just as easily not. This doesn’t mean that they didn’t like 
your pitch. They might have liked it very much but gotten swept up in some other, 
more pressing emergency. Within a few days of the pitch, you should find an excuse 
to follow up with them by e-mail or phone (“you had asked about details of the 
texture manager, and I just wanted to get back to you on that”) to subtly remind 
them that you are still around and that they owe you feedback. You have no good 
reason to nag them outright for an answer—if you do, you are likely to get an 
answer quickly: “no thanks.” They may need time to think about it, time to discuss 
internally, or time to review other competing proposals. Just keep following up 
periodically, not too often, until you get an answer. Never get frustrated if they don’t 
respond—be patient and understanding. It may be that the time for your idea to be 
useful just isn’t here yet. It is not uncommon to ping a publisher six months after a

Hey, What about Kickstarter?
pitch and to hear back, “Hey, I’m glad you contacted me. Remember that pitch you 
gave? I think we might want to talk to you about it. Can we meet next week?”
Hey, What about Kickstarter?
Ah, crowdsourcing. It seems like the perfect solution! Why should you have to pitch 
to some executive, when you can take my game right to the people and sell it to 
them before you even make it! Some designers have raised millions of dollars this 
way, why not you?
Kickstarter and its many cousins have certainly been a wonderful thing for some 
game developers, but most game developers who try to crowdfund fail. Why? Many 
of them fail to follow the aforementioned pitch tips—all the rules about getting right 
to the point, seeming organized, capturing the imagination, showing instead of tell­
ing, and dazzling the viewer are just as true in a video pitch as they are when you 
pitch in person. But there are some very specific things that people don’t realize 
about crowdfunding as well:
●
●
It’s a lot of work: Preparing and running a crowdfunding campaign is a huge 
amount of work. Expect to take a full month to design it and build your page and 
video, a full month to run the campaign, and then a full month later down the 
road to fulfill everything you promised (mailing t-shirts, making custom con­
tent, etc.). That’s two or three months you could have spent making your game, 
and you might not even get the money.
●
●
It’s really a preorder system: Crowdfunding is not a system of investment, and 
it is not a charity system. Most people who fund something are doing so because 
they are excited about getting something special, getting it before everyone else, 
and getting it at a good price. That’s great if you have invented, say, a next-
generation game controller. But if you plan to crowdfund your free to play iOS 
game, then watch out. Apple has no means for distributing early versions, and 
if the game is already free, why would anyone give you $25 before they even 
know if they like it? Crowdfunding works best with things that have a physical 
component or with games that have a high ($20+) fixed price.
●
●
Ask for as little as possible: You might think that by asking for more funding, 
it will incentivize the community to give you more. This does not seem to be 
the case. And with Kickstarter, if you don’t hit your target, you get nothing. Set 
the lowest funding target you can manage. If your campaign takes off, you can 
always get more.
●
●
Shorter is better: Sixty days of money sounds like more than thirty days, right? 
In most cases, no. Shorter campaigns seem to do better. Most campaigns find 
that they get most of the funding the first week (from people who are sure they 
want to fund it) and the last week (from people who prefer to wait till the last 
minute to decide). Whether you have two weeks in the middle or six weeks 

482
CHAPTER Thirty • THE DESIGNER GIVES THE CLIENT A PITCH
doesn’t seem to matter much, but the longer your campaign, the more work it 
will be, and the more chance there is people will forget about it.
●
●
Keep the rewards simple: Remember, it’s a preorder. Most just want an early 
release of the game at a good price. T-shirts and other tchotchkes are a nice idea 
but won’t change your funding very much, will be a lot of work to mail out, and 
may even overwhelm funders with too many choices.
●
●
Show, don’t tell: The most successful game crowdfunding videos show a taste of 
the game in action, and not much more. Why? Because crowdfunding is really 
mostly about preorders. Show them a slice of a cool game, and people will step 
up to buy it. Yap for five minutes about what the game might be, you’ll have a 
much harder time.
●
●
Hustle: Do anything you can to get the word out about your crowdfunding cam­
paign. Tweet and give updates as often as possible. Set tiny goals “Hey, we’re 
almost 10% there! You could be the one to get us to 10%!” Bother any influential 
people you help the word out. Don’t think you can sit back and let the campaign 
take care of itself—you have to be pushing it every second.
●
●
Have stretch goals: Stretch goals (Our goal is $40K, but if we hit $50K, we’ll add 
a blue laser level!) help a great deal with virality, because everyone who funded 
your game now has a reason to spread the word—after all, if I can get other peo­
ple to pledge money, then I’ll get more for the money I pledged, at no cost to me.
●
●
Be famous: There are no two ways about it. The most likely games to get funded 
are the ones by people who already have a following. If you aren’t famous, your 
game better be pretty incredible sounding or have a tiny funding goal.
In short, crowdfunding is a great move for some games, but not for others. In the 
end, it’s a pitch like any other and needs time and attention to be great. Every game 
begins with an idea, but it gets funded with a pitch. Keep this lens so you don’t 
forget to design your pitch as well as you design your game.
Lens #108: The Lens of the Pitch
To ensure your pitch is as good as it can be, ask yourself these questions:
●
●
 Why are you pitching this game to this client?
●
●
 What will you consider “a successful pitch”?
●
●
 What’s in it for the people you are pitching to?
●
●
 What do the people you are pitching to need to know about your game?

If you are pitching to an executive, the most important thing to them will be whether 
the game can make money, and how much. This is the subject of our next chapter.

to Make a Profit

486
CHAPTER Thirty-One • THE DESIGNER AND CLIENT WANT THE GAME TO MAKE A PROFIT
Love and Money
It is time to face another painful truth.
I know that you, personally, are designing games out of love for the medium. If 
there were no way to make money at game design, you would surely continue to do 
it as a hobby. The very word “amateur” literally means lover.
But money is the fuel that drives the game industry.
If games were not profitable, the industry would wither and die.
And in the real world of the game industry, there are many people who, if they 
learned today they could make 2% more profit a year selling can openers instead of 
games, would do so and feel really proud of their choice.
Perhaps you view these people with a certain contempt. But should you? Profits 
are necessary to the industry—who better to be in charge of them than people who 
love money? I mean, you don’t want to worry about money all day, do you? You have 
games to design. Why not let the money people be in charge of the money and the 
design people be in charge of the design, and everyone will be happy, right?
Sadly, no. Remember “form follows funding?” Decisions that the money people 
make (“you need to make this game with $200K, not the $450K you asked for”; 
“we’ve decided this game needs to have microtransactions, not a subscription”; 
“you have to include in-game advertising”) can have a tremendous impact on the 
game design. And the opposite is true—game design decisions will have an enor­
mous impact on profitability. In a weird way, design and management each hold the 
strings controlling the destiny of the other. Because of this, the money people are 
going to step in and tell you how to design your game, because they are afraid you 
might not understand the impacts of your design on profitability. And when there is 
a conflict between the two of you, who do you think is going to win? Keep in mind 
the golden rule: the one with the gold makes the rules.
For this reason, it’s really important that you understand enough about the 
business of games so that you can have an intelligent discussion with the money 
people. This will give you much more creative control, because if you can explain 
why your precious feature will make more money, in terms they’ll understand and 
believe, you’ve got a much better shot at having the game turn out the way you 
know is best.
You might be thinking, “I don’t know the first thing about business—all this 
financial stuff is going to be over my head.” But as a game designer, you already 
know a lot about psychology, and every business decision is really just a bet on 
the nature of human psychology. You don’t have to master every financial detail—
you just need to know enough about the game business to think about it and talk 
about it. It’s certainly simpler than learning about probability, and you seemed 
to understand that pretty well. I’m sure you’ve met someone with an MBA who, 
surprisingly, didn’t seem too bright. If that guy can understand it, so can you. And 
making money is a lot like a game—when you consider it from that point of view, it 
can actually be kind of fun to think about.

487
Know Your Business Model
This chapter isn’t going to get into great detail about the business of games—
there are other books for that. But we’ll talk about things you can do to make it 
easier to have meaningful conversations with the people who hold the purse strings 
on your game.
Know Your Business Model
Making money is art and working is art and good business is the best art.
—Andy Warhol
Retail
To understand any business, follow the money. If you understand where the 
money goes and why, you understand the business. For example, when a con­
sumer buys a $50 retail game title, this diagram shows, on average, where the 
money ends up:
Seeing this kind of diagram leads to questions like the following:
Q: What is a platform holder?
A: This is the company that makes a given console (Sony, Nintendo, Microsoft). 
They don’t usually make any money selling the consoles (they often lose money, 
selling them below cost!). They make their money by “taxing” the publisher for 
each title made.

CHAPTER Thirty-One • THE DESIGNER AND CLIENT WANT THE GAME TO MAKE A PROFIT
Q: Why does the retailer take so much?
A: Doesn’t the retailer seem greedy? But they aren’t. Retail is a low-margin business 
where they have to cut every possible corner to survive. It just costs a lot to run 
a store.
Q: Why does the publisher take so much?
A: Look at everything they have to do! They have to coordinate and bargain with 
all these different companies, and if anything goes wrong, they are the ones 
who lose money. If the game doesn’t sell, the developer still got paid to make the 
title, and the retailer will make the publisher buy back the unsold titles. Part of 
the reason the publisher takes so much is because they have to pay for titles that 
lose money.
Q: What is a markdown reserve?
A: Eventually, the title will be marked down, sold at a lower price. The retailer 
makes the publisher absorb some of the loss when this happens. On average, that 
comes to about $3 a unit.
Now, keep in mind, these numbers are averages. What really happens is much more 
detailed and can vary from one situation to another. But still! Look how much of the 
player’s $50 go to things that have nothing to do with actually making the game! 
You can see why developers were so excited when it became possible to sell directly 
to the consumer. Surely, it will be a win/win, right? The consumer pays less, and 
the developer gets more! Well, let’s take a look.

There we go, that’s more like it! This simple model cuts out the publisher, and the

(more or less) that Steam and the Apple app store use. Clean and simple! The con­
sumer pays a low price, say, $10, and the developer generally collects 70% of that. 
But, hey…
Q: What’s that question mark next to the $7?
A: Well, that’s because this diagram assumes the developer spends zero on 
marketing and advertising. Which is sometimes the case, but not usually. 
Usually, some amount of money needs to be spent to get people to find out 
about the game. This used to be the publisher’s problem, but if you are self-
publishing, well, it’s your problem now. Look back to Figure 31.2, where the 
publisher was spending $6 per customer, on average; if you do that here, 
you only are left with $1! Trying to decide how much to spend to acquire 
customers is one of the most challenging aspects of self-publishing, because 
there are no guarantees, and you must be careful not to spend more than the 
game takes in.
Free to Play
Shortly after direct download games appeared, prices started to drop, for reasons 
we’ll get into later. Eventually, they dropped all the way to zero, as developers 
realized that the way to get the most players was to give the game away for free, 
wait till players needed something, and then charge them for it. On one level, this 
seems great for players (they get to try the game for free to see if they like it), but on 
the other hand, players often feel like the game designer is intentionally designing 
game situations that lure the player into wanting to pay at key moments. Players 
feel this way because it’s true! Love it or hate it, that’s the way free to play (F2P) 
works. And it does work, to the tune of millions and millions of dollars. So let’s

CHAPTER Thirty-One • THE DESIGNER AND CLIENT WANT THE GAME TO MAKE A PROFIT
Q: What is average LTV?
A: LTV stands for lifetime value. That is, how much the average player pays over 
their entire play history. With F2P games, lots of players will pay zero. But some 
will pay a lot. The average amount spent per player is the average LTV. LTV var­
ies widely from game to game, so don’t take this $5 amount very seriously.
Q: What is customer acquisition?
A: That’s the way we measure what it costs, on average, to get someone to play your 
game. Again, $3 is just an example. With a very viral game, it might cost less. 
With some games, it costs more.
Q: Fifty cents profit? Aren’t I going to need a lot of customers?
A: Yes… yes you are. If your game cost $500K to make (a typical budget for a mobile 
F2P game), you’ll need a million players at these costs just to break even. You 
can see why increasing the LTV and decreasing the customer acquisition costs 
are so very important.
I’m sure you have many more questions about this—following the money does 
that—it raises questions—find the answers, and you’ll understand the business 
model. There are other business models, of course—subscriptions, board and card 
games, advergames, games that give you extra powers when you buy toys, and 
many more. And the peculiarities of each business model exert powerful forces 
that help define the nature of the games sold through them, which is why you 
need to understand them. It isn’t hard, really. If you find yourself baffled by a new 
business model, all you have to do is find a money person and ask them “Hey, 
can you show me where the money goes?” and pretty soon you’ll know just what 
questions to ask.
Know Your Competition
When you send your game out into the world, it doesn’t really go straight to con­
sumers. First, it must battle with dozens of other games to win the hearts and 
minds of potential players. It helps a great deal if you know something about what 
your game is competing with, for that can be as important as how good it is. Is your 
game the only zombie-pet-farming sim out there, or are there dozens? How does 
your game look compared to the others? Are you the best-in-breed or the low-budget 
alternative? Hopefully, your game is filling a gap that you have perceived in the 
market—something that people will really want, that isn’t already out there. If you 
can show the money people that you have done a thorough “gap analysis” by look­
ing at games that are close to yours but that are missing a key component that you 
will provide, it will help your case immensely.

491
Know Your Audience
Know Your Audience
Way back in Chapter 9, “Player,” we talked about the importance of knowing your 
audience so you can make them a great game. But you need to understand not just 
how your audience plays, but how your audience pays. What price point is going 
to seem fair to them? How do they feel about free to play? Is a high-priced game a 
turnoff for them, or do they see that as a valuable game? What features make them 
decide to buy a game? Your answers to these questions may shape your game more 
than anything else, so you need have solid answers. Use your designer powers here 
to see what the money people can’t. Sometimes, all they can see are charts and 
tables. If you can see into the heart and mind of your player and come up with a 
new pricing model you are sure they will find fair, you will be able to have more 
impact on the profitability of a game than a hundred financial analysts.
Consider the game Dungeons & Dragons Online. The designers originally made 
a subscription game, but as that model started to weaken, they decided to switch it 
to F2P. Many players dislike F2P adventure games—it can feel like you are cheat­
ing. It is as if the game says, “Hey… can’t kill the dragon, huh? Well, pay me $5 for 
this magic battle axe, and I bet you can do it.” So, you sheepishly pay the money, 
get the magic battle axe, kill the dragon, and, well, feel kind of like a failure. But 
consider how the designers of Dungeons & Dragons Online did it: they don’t ask 
you to pay for weapons; they ask you to pay for adventures. Their game feels 
­different, as if it says, “Would you like to go into the Dragon’s Cave? That adventure 
costs $5.” So, you pay for it and, with many tries and much difficulty, eventually 
slay the dragon. And on his treasure heap, guess what? There’s a magic battle axe. 
In both games, you paid $5 and ended up with a magic weapon, but in one, you 
feel like a cheat, and in the other, you feel like a hero. And all because someone 
understood the psychology of their player.
One significant consideration is whether you are making a “hardcore” or “casual” 
game. Honestly, it can be hard to draw a distinction between these categories, some­
times, as some people play Dark Souls casually, just for an hour once in a while, 
and others play eighty hours of hardcore Farmville a week. But what we mean when 
we use these terms is whether a player self-identifies as a “gamer.” If they do, they 
are often willing to pay a high price for content that means a lot to them. If they 
don’t self-identify this way, it doesn’t mean they never play games—they might play 
Angry Birds or Subway Surfer several times a week, but only to kill time. So, what’s 
the difference that matters most? How much they are willing to pay. There are prob­
ably a hundred casual players in the world for every hardcore gamer, but hardcore 
gamers are willing to pay a lot more for games they care about. Both markets are 
totally valid, but they must be approached quite differently. The casual market, con­
sisting of billions of people worldwide, can sound very appealing, but it can be very 
hard to get the attention of casual gamers, unless you get lucky and become sud­
denly fashionable (see Flappy Bird). Hardcore gamers, on the other hand, respond 

492
CHAPTER Thirty-One • THE DESIGNER AND CLIENT WANT THE GAME TO MAKE A PROFIT
well to something that is well-crafted and deep. It can cost more to make games 
for them, but they are often willing to pay more as well. Whatever you decide, the 
key is to know who will care about your game, what they will pay for it, and why.
Learn the Language
Every business model has its own unique jargon that serves as shorthand for talk­
ing about how the game makes money. If you want the money people to take you 
seriously, learn their language. If you can speak it as well as they do, they will 
make a place for you at the table. Learn to speak it better than they do, and you 
will find them deferring to your design decisions every time. Here are some terms 
you should know.
General Game Business Terms
●
●
SKU: Pronounced “skew.” Stands for “stock keeping unit.” It means a unique 
inventory item for a store. One game might come out as many SKUs, since each 
different console release is a SKU and each language version (Halo 3 in French) 
is a SKU. Publishers often measure themselves in terms of how many SKUs they 
put out in a year.
●
●
COGS: No, not like cogs in a machine. This is cost of goods sold. That is, what 
does it cost, per unit, to actually make the game.
●
●
Burn rate: What does it is cost, per month, to keep your studio open? Salaries, 
benefits, rent, etc.
●
●
Sold in vs. sold through: When the retailer buys games from the publisher, they 
are “sold in,” that is, sold into the store. But when a customer buys the game, 
then we say it is “sold through.” Since the publisher has to buy back titles the 
retailer can’t sell, the number of sold-in and sold-through titles might be very dif­
ferent. If a boastful publisher brags to you that a title has sold 1.5 million copies, 
and it’s just been out for a week, you can often burst his bubble by asking “sold 
in or sold through?” In the end, only “sold through” matters.
●
●
Units sold: Primarily important for retail and direct download games, this is 
simply how many times the game has been purchased. When pitching a new 
game, everyone will be trying to make determinations about how many units it 
will sell—often based on how well similar games have sold.
●
●
Breakeven: How many units of the game have to be sold before the publisher 
makes back the money they put into the game. For example, if the game cost 
$400,000 to develop and market, and you collect $5 for every unit sold, break­
even will be at 80,000 units sold. Below that, you lose money—above that, you 
make profit.

●
●
Churn: What percent of players do you lose each month? Ideally, this number 
is zero. The bigger the churn, the worse your retention, and everyone will ask 
“What can we do to keep them playing?”
●
●
Cost of acquisition: How much do you have to spend, on average, to get someone 
to download and play your game?
●
●
DAU: daily active users. How many people played your game in the last twenty 
four hours? This is the easiest fact about an F2P game to measure, and obviously 
bigger is better, so DAU gets a lot of attention.
●
●
MAU: monthly active users. How many players played your game in the last 
month? Wait a second, shouldn’t this just be DAU⁜×⁜30? No. If you have the same 
set of people playing your game every day, then your MAU will equal your DAU. 
If you have high churn, your MAU will be much greater than your DAU. Much is 
made of the MAU/DAU ratio.
●
●
ARPU: average revenue per user. Typically this is quoted monthly. In other 
words, figure out how much money is collected in the last thirty days, and divide 
it by your MAU, and that gives you your ARPU.
●
●
ARPPU: average revenue per paying user. That is, just looking at the players who 
pay money, how much to do they pay, on average? Like ARPU, this is also usu­
ally calculated on a monthly basis. This number will be higher (usually much 
higher) than your ARPU.
●
●
LTV: lifetime value. How much money are you making from the average player 
from when they first try your game till the time when they quit and never play 
again? This is a hard number to calculate, but it is very important, since it tells 
you how much you can safely spend to acquire new players. If the LTV of your 
average player is $5, it is a reasonable idea to spend $4 to acquire a new player, 
because eventually you’ll make a dollar from them. But if your LTV is $3, spend­
ing $4 would be foolish.
●
●
K-factor: This is a term borrowed from the world of viral marketing, who bor­
rowed it from the world of medicine. It is simply this: How many other new play­
ers does your average player bring in? If your game is very viral, and everyone is 
getting their friends to play, your k-factor is high. A high k-factor is very impor­
tant, because strong virality drastically lowers the cost of acquisition.
●
●
Whale: This unflattering term refers to players that pay A LOT for F2P games. 
Some will pay hundreds or even thousands of dollars if it helps them succeed. 
F2P designers pay a lot of attention to whales, as they can constitute a significant 
percentage of revenues for a game. One study found that 50% of game revenue 
comes from only 0.15% of players. If 50% of your revenue comes from whales, 
and you just found a way to get the whales to spend double what they normally 
do, that’s a big deal.

494
CHAPTER Thirty-One • THE DESIGNER AND CLIENT WANT THE GAME TO MAKE A PROFIT
There’s lots more of these, of course, but I list these just to give you a sample. You 
see they really aren’t that complicated. If you can have some familiarity with this 
kind of language and are brave enough to ask for explanations when you hear terms 
you don’t know, the money people will start to respect you, because they’ll see you 
care about the things they think are important. And these things are important—
without them, game design couldn’t be a career, only a hobby.
Know the Top Sellers
Try this: for whatever platform you care about most, make a list, right now, of the 
top ten moneymaking videogames of the last year. After you make your list, go on 
the web and compare reality to your list. If you had a perfect match, good job. If 
not, you should think about why you were off base. Did you not realize that titles 
based on movie franchises were so popular? Did you forget about F2P games? Did 
you think Pokemon wouldn’t be on the list? Did you assume that the games you 
liked best were the games everyone else liked? I can guarantee you that any funder 
you pitch to can name the top ten games. Why? Because the game industry is a hit-
driven business. Publishers make their money off of big hits, and so they study the 
hits scrupulously, in an attempt to understand what made them successful.
If you want to understand how publishers think, you need to analyze the hits. 
One company, Electronic Entertainment Design and Research (www.eedar.com), is 
taking this analysis to new levels by breaking games down feature by feature and 
performing complex mathematical analysis to try to understand which features 
contributed most to the financial success of each title. How much does multiplayer 
matter? How much do hours of gameplay matter? This is so developers and publish­
ers can use these data for future titles.
However you do it, find some way to get familiar with the hits in your market 
and demographic and understand why they were so successful. It will help you 
build a common understanding with the money people. And if you have special 
insights as to why certain game designs made so much money, I can guarantee that 
the money people will want to hear what you have to say.
The Importance of Barriers
I shall be telling this with a sigh
Somewhere ages and ages hence:
Two roads diverged in a wood, and I—
I took the one less traveled by,
And that has made all the difference.
—Robert Frost

495
The Importance of Barriers
When downloadable games that required no publisher became a reality, it was 
hailed by independent developers as massive win for the little guy. Surely, now, any 
little developer with a great idea could compete with the very biggest game publish­
ers. And it was true! In the iOS market, for example, some game developers found 
they could earn a very comfortable living selling their homemade games for $6.99 
in the app store. Soon, the world smelled the gold rush, and games started to appear 
by the thousands. And the prices started to drop: $4.99 became standard, then 
$3.99, $2.99, $1.99, then $.99, and finally, free. And ironically, in a market where the 
standard price was free, the game makers with the best chance of making money 
on their games were the ones who could get millions and millions of players—and 
in a crowded market, that meant spending a lot on marketing, and so, once again, 
we have a situation that significantly favors large publishers. No longer is it a chal­
lenge to get your game into the store—the challenge now is to stand out among the 
thousands of competitors. This has made it necessary for everyone who creates 
games in these markets to think heavily (and often spend heavily) when it comes to 
marketing. Markets like this, which are flooded with suppliers, are often referred to 
as “red ocean” markets, conjuring up a picture of a fish-eat-fish world where there 
is a great deal of blood in the water. How to survive? Either be the biggest fish or go 
find a “blue ocean.”
“Blue oceans” are places with relatively few competitors. Sometimes markets are 
like this because they are very new. But other times these are places where there are 
barriers that keep other people from entering. If you can get into one of these places, 
it can be very much to your advantage. At the present time, the iOS market is such 
a red ocean that 90% of games in the app store lose money, and only about 10% are 
profitable. Contrast that with the slot machine industry, which, due to government 
regulations, special hardware, special expertise, and dependence on special algo­
rithms, is a very hard part of the videogame market to enter. In this market, about 
90% of the games are profitable, and only about 10% lose money. Barriers make a 
huge difference to profitability, so if you can take advantage of them, you definitely 
should. Barriers come in many varieties—here are a few to consider:
●
●
Technical barriers: This can include special algorithms that make for new kinds 
of gameplay, or a new look and feel, or possibly a new kind of server technol­
ogy that allows for unique multiplayer gameplay. Many games have had great 
success by solving difficult technical problems that others can’t easily replicate.
●
●
Hardware barriers: If you have created a new kind of hardware platform, possi­
bly even one protected by patents, it will be hard for others to quickly follow you. 
When Skylanders came out, for example, everyone agreed it was a good idea, but 
very few companies were able to create a competitive product.
●
●
Expertise barriers: Maybe you know all there is to know about early childhood 
social–emotional learning, and you find there is a real market for games that 
help with that. People who don’t have your level of deep understanding will have 
a hard time competing.

496
CHAPTER Thirty-One • THE DESIGNER AND CLIENT WANT THE GAME TO MAKE A PROFIT
●
●
Sales and distribution barriers: I once cofounded a company that tried to sell 
training games to firefighters. We quickly realized that we would need a giant 
sales force to sell our software precinct by precinct. Other training companies 
already had sales relationships and sales forces in place—since we couldn’t 
afford to do that, we quickly got into a new business. If you have a special sales 
relationship (or can find a partner that does) with a certain market, think about 
how to take advantage of it.
●
●
Imagination barriers: Anybody could have made Minecraft. It is not a very com­
plicated game. But only one guy saw that making a game like that and selling it 
for a simple flat fee could work.
●
●
Relationship barriers: Some games require a special partner, maybe for a movie 
or franchise license. If the licensor will only work with people they trust, that 
is a significant barrier that keeps others from competing, if you have a special 
relationship with them.
●
●
Uncertainty barriers: Crazy new platforms are announced all the time. 
Sometimes everyone gets excited and jumps on them. Other times, developers 
are more uncertain. When the Microsoft Kinect was announced, most develop­
ers were skeptical that it would succeed. But a handful jumped the barrier of 
uncertainty and took a gamble on it, and when sales of it were unexpectedly 
high, they reaped the benefits of being one of very few games available for an 
unexpectedly popular platform.
Most people avoid barriers when they see them. They feel more comfortable follow­
ing the crowd. But following the crowd means eventually fighting the crowd. Many 
successful developers have found that choosing the road less traveled by has indeed 
made all the difference.
In the next chapter, we’ll talk about something far more important than money.
Lens #109: The Lens of Profit
Profits keep the game industry alive. Ask these questions to help your game 
become profitable:
●
●
Where does the money go in my game’s business model? Why?
●
●
How much will it cost to produce, market, distribute, and maintain this 
game? Why?
●
●
How much money will this game make? Why do I think that?
●
●
What are the barriers to entry in the market for this game?

CHAPTER Thirty-Two • GAMES TRANSFORM THEIR PLAYERS
How Do Games Change Us?
There is much debate about the long-term effect of games on the mind. Some believe 
that they have no lasting effect and that they just serve as a momentary distraction. 
Others believe that gameplay can be dangerous, inciting players to violence or ruin­
ing their lives through addiction. Still others believe that games are so good for us 
that they will become the cornerstone of twenty-first-century education.
How games change us is not a trivial question, for the answer to it is transform­
ing society as we speak—either for the better or for the worse.
Can Games Be Good for You?
Games come so naturally to humans and afford so much pleasure that only some­
one of a very extreme philosophical orientation would maintain that all gameplay 
is harmful. Several positive effects are often attributed to games.
Emotional Maintenance
Games are one of many activities that people engage in to try to maintain and con­
trol their mood and emotional state. People play games to try to
●
●
Vent anger and frustration: Games, particularly sports involving a lot of physi­
cal activity (football, basketball) or videogames involving a lot of fast action and 
battles, can be a cathartic way to “take out your feelings” on someone else in the 
safe world of the game.
●
●
Cheer up: When a person is depressed, whimsical games with funny situations 
(Cranium, Mario Party) can be a way to take your mind off your troubles and 
remember that you can still have fun.
●
●
Gain perspective: There are times when our troubles loom large on us and little 
things seem like they are the end of the world. Playing games gives us some 
distance from our real-world problems, so when we return, we more easily see 
them for what they are.
●
●
Build confidence: After a few real-life failures, it is easy to start to feel like you 
aren’t good at anything, which can lead to a feeling that everything in your life 
is beyond your control. Playing a game where your choices and actions can lead 
to a successful outcome can give a feeling of mastery that helps remind you that 
you can succeed and that you have some control over your destiny.
●
●
Relax: Sometimes we are simply unable to let go of our worries, because of either 
their size or their sheer number. Games force our brains to engage with some­
thing completely unconnected to our worries, letting us escape them for a while 
and giving us a much needed “emotional rest.”

501
Can Games Be Good for You?
And while it is true that efforts to play games for these reasons sometimes backfire—
if the game proves just as frustrating as real life, for example—in general, games 
serve the aforementioned tasks fairly well, acting as tools that help maintain our 
emotional health.
Connecting
Connecting socially with others is not always an easy thing to do. We are each 
caught up in our own problems and worries that others might not understand or 
care about. Games can act as a “social bridge,” giving us reasons to interact with 
each other, letting us see how others respond to a variety of situations, introducing 
topics of conversation, showing us what we have in common, and creating shared 
memories. This combination of factors makes games a great tool to help build and 
maintain relationships with the important people in our lives.
Exercise
Games, particularly sports, give us reason and motivation to perform healthy physi­
cal exercise. Recent studies have shown the health benefits of mental exercise, 
particularly for the elderly. The problem-solving nature of games makes them flex­
ible tools to provide both physical and mental exercises in many forms. As digital 
technology becomes smaller and more portable, new gateways for how to use it to 
enhance physical exercise will continue to appear.
Education
I have always had a fancy that learning might be made a play and recreation 
to children.
—John Locke, 1692
Some hold the position that education is serious, but games are not; therefore, games 
have no place in education. But an examination of our educational system shows 
that it is a game! Students (players) are given a series of assignments (goals) that 
must be handed in (accomplished) by certain due dates (time limits). They receive 
grades (scores) as feedback repeatedly as assignments (challenges) get harder and 
harder, until the end of the course when they are faced with a final exam (boss 
monster), which they can only pass (defeat) if they have mastered all the skills in 
the course (game). Students (players) who perform particularly well are listed on 
the honor roll (leaderboard).
So, why doesn’t education feel more like a game? The lenses in this book make it 
pretty clear. Traditional educational methods often feature a real lack of surprises, a 

502
CHAPTER Thirty-Two • GAMES TRANSFORM THEIR PLAYERS
lack of projection, a lack of pleasures, a lack of community, and a bad interest curve. 
When Marshall McLuhan said, “Anyone who thinks education and entertainment 
are different doesn’t know much about either,” this is what he was talking about. 
It’s not that learning isn’t fun, but it is just that many educational experiences are 
poorly designed.
So why haven’t educational videogames found more of a home in the classroom? 
There seem to be several reasons:
●
●
Time constraints: Playing games can take a long time and a variable amount of 
time—many meaningful, educational games are just too long of an experience 
for a classroom setting.
●
●
Variable pacing: One thing games are good at is letting players proceed at their 
own pace. In a school setting, the instructor usually has to keep everyone mov­
ing along at a single pace.
●
●
1965: People born before 1965 did not grow up playing videogames; therefore, 
games do not come naturally to them and seem kind of foreign. Up until recently, 
the educational system was primarily run by people born before 1965 (the aver­
age high school principal is 49 years old).
●
●
Good educational games are hard to make: To create something that delivers 
a complete, verifiable, assessable lesson, while still engaging students, is very 
hard. And an average semester class contains two or three dozens of different 
lessons that must be covered.
Despite these challenges, games can be excellent tools for education, but they work 
best as tools and not complete educational systems. A wise educator uses the right 
tool for the right job—what are the right educational jobs for games? Let’s consider 
some of the areas where games seem to have some advantage.
Giving the Brain What It Wants
Part of what makes education difficult is that it can be boring. Games, by their 
nature, are masterful at keeping the brain fully engaged—and this is because they 
give the brain what it wants. Here are examples:
●
●
Visible progress: As we discussed in Chapter 14, “Puzzles,” visible progress is a 
tremendous human motivator. So, naturally, good education must let the student 
experience visible progress. Game structures like leveling up and completing 
quests are one way to make progress clear and visible.
●
●
Make the abstract concrete: The human brain is challenged by abstract concepts. 
It has much more facility with that which is concrete. This is why good teachers 
use concrete examples to shed light on abstract principles. Games are naturally 
manipulable and can be good at making the abstract concrete. This is why war 

503
Can Games Be Good for You?
games and simulations are such an important part of military education—the 
abstract principles of military strategy are meaningless without the concrete reali­
ties of the battlefield.
●
●
Full engagement: When the brain has nothing to do, it gets “itchy,” and we get 
a kind of restless feeling. We also get this feeling when one part of the brain is 
engaged (say, listening to a lecture) but another part, such as the musical, social, 
or kinesthetic part, is not. This is why students in class often find themselves 
humming, whispering to neighbors, or tapping their fingers—those parts of the 
brain are eager for activity. Games excel at full engagement, occupying the eyes, 
ears, hands, and mind, often full of music and social activities. When every part 
of the mind is at a comfortable level of activity, there can be no level of distract­
ing restlessness, and education can take place more easily.
●
●
Lots of little goals: Brain loves clear and interesting goals, and good games are 
long chains of concrete, achievable, rewarding goals.
Once the mind is fully engaged, though, what will it learn?
Facts
One of the first areas that people naturally think of using videogames is to convey 
facts and to drill those facts. This works mainly because learning facts (state capi­
tals, times tables, names of infectious diseases, etc.) is dull and repetitive. It is an 
easy thing to integrate them into game systems that give auxiliary rewards as you 
make progress learning information that is not inherently interesting. Videogames, 
in particular, can make use of visuals and meaningful context that can help players 
learn and remember these facts.
Problem Solving
Combinatory play seems to be the essential feature in productive thought.
—Albert Einstein
Remember our definition of game? A problem-solving activity approached with a 
playful attitude. Naturally, when it comes to practicing problem solving, games have 
a chance to shine, particularly in cases where students need an opportunity to show 
that they can use a variety of different skills and techniques in an integrated way. 
For this reason, it may be the case that gamelike simulations may start to serve as 
final exams in areas where multiple techniques need to be combined in a realistic 
setting, such as police and rescue work, geology, architecture, and management.
Classroom work aside, it is interesting to note that an entire generation is being 
raised playing very complex videogames that require a great deal of planning, strat­
egy, and patience if the player is to succeed. Some theorize that this will lead to 

504
CHAPTER Thirty-Two • GAMES TRANSFORM THEIR PLAYERS
a generation that is far better at problem solving than any previous generation—
whether this is true remains to be seen.
Systems of Relationships
The thing that games arguably are best at teaching is illustrated by an ancient Zen 
koan:
Hyakujo wished to send a monk to open a new monastery. He told his pupils 
that whoever answered a question most ably would be appointed. Placing a 
water vase on the ground, he asked: “Who can say what this is without calling 
its name?”
The chief monk said: “No one can call it a wooden shoe.”
Isan, the cooking monk, tipped over the vase with his foot and went out.
Hyakujo smiled and said: “The chief monk loses.” And Isan became the master 
of the new monastery.
The chief monk knew his words could not tell the truth of what a water vase really 
is like, so he slyly tried to say what it was not. But Isan, whose training was in the 
most practical of arts, cooking, knew well that some things cannot be understood 
with words—they must be demonstrated to be understood.
And interactive demonstration is one place that games and simulations excel. 
Education researchers frequently refer to Miller’s pyramid of learning:
In this model, being able to do something is the pinnacle of knowledge, and 
game-based learning is almost entirely focused on doing.
Lectures, readings, and videos all have the weakness of being linear, and a linear 
medium is a very difficult way to convey a complex system of relationships. The 
only way to understand a complex system of relationships is to play with it and to 
get a holistic sense of how everything is connected.

Can Games Be Good for You?
Some systems of relationships best understood via simulation are listed as follows:
●
●
The human circulatory system
●
●
Traffic patterns in a major city
●
●
A nuclear reactor
●
●
The workings of a cell
●
●
The ecology of endangered species
●
●
Heating and cooling in the earth’s atmosphere
There is a tremendous difference in understanding between people who have merely 
read about these things and people who have played with simulations of them, 
because the players have not just read about the systems of relationships but also 
experienced them. And one of the most powerful ways they experience them is by 
testing their limits, pushing the simulation until it breaks. How much traffic does 
it take to make the commute time longer than the workday? How much water can 
the reactor lose before it melts down? What will irreversibly melt the polar ice caps? 
Simulations give the player permission to fail, which (aside from being fun) is incred­
ibly educational—because the learner not only sees the failures but sees why they 
happened, which leads to significant insight about the workings of the whole system.
One of the most striking instances of this I have ever seen is in the game 
Peacemaker from Impact Games. Peacemaker is a simulation of the Israeli/
Palestinian conflict, where players have the choice of playing the role of either the 
Israeli prime minister or the Palestinian president, with a goal of trying to make 
peace between the two nations. When playtesting the game with natives of these 
countries, the natives would often enter the game with a belief that if the other side 
would do a few simple things, the conflict would be over. As they would attempt to 
play the opposing side, however, they would quickly see it wasn’t as simple as they 
thought; complex pressures on both sides make it very difficult to reduce the con­
flict. Players then quickly succumb to curiosity. First, they try to see what it takes 
to bring these nations to all out war, and when they have that out of their systems, 
they try to solve the big challenge: are there any techniques that will successfully 
work to make peace between these nations?
Objections are often raised about simulating such serious topics. It seems unlikely 
that these simulations can be perfect. What if someone who plays with a simulation 
learns a technique that is only valid in the simulation but would be disastrous in the 
real world? For this reason, simulations often work much better with a live instruc­
tor who is able to point out the discrepancies and use them as teaching moments. 
It is worth noting, though, that people do not expect simulations to be completely 
accurate, and often, the simulation loopholes can be very instructive—they cause 
players to wonder “why doesn’t this happen in the real world?” That question alone 
can lead to deep insights about how the real world actually works. In other words, 
in some cases, a flawed simulation can be more instructive than a perfect one!

CHAPTER Thirty-Two • GAMES TRANSFORM THEIR PLAYERS
New Insights
In the movie Groundhog Day, Bill Murray plays a selfish, arrogant character who 
gets caught in a time loop that forces him to relive the same day over and over until 
he gets it right. Over the many repeats of that day, he experiments with how to inter­
act with people around him, gradually understanding them better and better. This 
understanding gives him insights that cause him to alter his behavior, until finally 
he has become the kind of person that willfully does the right thing, and when he 
finally escapes February 2, he is a changed man.
The important part of simulations of systems of relationships is the new insights 
that are given to the players—they are able to see these systems in ways they 
couldn’t before. And creating the change in perspective that leads to new insights 
is something games are very good at, since games create whole new realities, with 
new sets of rules, where you aren’t you anymore and you play the role of someone 
else entirely. This is a power of games that is just beginning to be tapped for the 
purposes of improving people’s lives. It is often said that children who grow up in 
low-income neighborhoods tend to aim lower in career aspirations because they 
simply can’t imagine they could succeed at a high-paying career. What if games 
could be used to help them imagine success and make it seem more achievable to 
them? What if games could help people understand how to escape an abusive rela­
tionship, break an addiction, or simply be a better volunteer? Perhaps we have just 
begun to scratch the surface of how life changing games can be.
Curiosity
The cure for boredom is curiosity. There is no cure for curiosity.
—Dorothy Parker
It has always been true that students who are curious have an advantage over their 
classmates who are not, because curious students are more likely to learn things 
on their own and they are more likely to retain what they learn, since they learn it 
because they want to. In a sense, curiosity makes you “own” your learning, and the 
learning you own is the learning you keep. But the recent proliferation of Internet 
access has increased this advantage a thousand times. A curious student can now 
learn as much as they want about any subject—all the information about every 
topic known to humankind is only a click away or will be soon. It seems very likely 
that a noticeable “curiosity gap” will begin to appear, since curious people will 
quickly grow to become experts at whatever topics interest them, while the incuri­
ous will be left far behind. It is possible that, in the coming decades, a curious mind 
may be the most valuable asset a person can have.
Surprisingly, though, we know very little about curiosity. Is it something we are 
born with, or is it something that can be taught? If it can be taught, nurtured, or 
strengthened, shouldn’t that become a top educational priority? Now recall from 
Chapter 4, “Game,” our definition of play: “manipulation that indulges curiosity.” 

507
Transformational Games
Could it be that shifting our educational systems toward more play-based models 
might be the best possible way to prepare children to thrive in the twenty-first century?
Creating Teachable Moments
Knowledge cannot simply be poured into a mind, like pouring coffee into a cup. The 
mind must be put into a state of readiness, a state where certain kinds of knowledge 
are suddenly useful and important and the mind hungrily reaches out to grab the 
knowledge, to absorb it, to use it immediately, and to save it for later. Good teach­
ers focus on painting scenarios and posing problems that put the minds of the 
students into this state. Games, with their concrete situations and their problems to 
be solved, can be an excellent tool for helping an instructor create these moments.
Transformational Games
Educational games are one kind of helpful game, but, as we’ve seen earlier, not the 
only kind. Games that help us exercise, connect with others, or change our hab­
its are also meaningfully helpful. To encompass this broader agenda, some have 
started to use the phrase serious games to separate them from games that are only 
for entertainment. I find this phrase dissatisfactory, for not only is it an insult to 
entertainment (which is a serious endeavor, indeed), but also it suggests that seri­
ousness is the primary goal of the games and that players are discouraged from 
having fun while playing them. I much prefer the phrase transformational games, 
because not only does it encompass a wide array of helpful games, but also it speaks 
to the primary purpose of these games—to change the player. In recent years, I have 
made a great study of transformational games and have worked to develop several 
of them. In doing so, I have picked up a few tips and tricks for doing them well, 
which I’m glad to share here.
Transformational Tip #1: Define Your Transformation
Possibly the most important reason to use the phrase “transformational games” is 
because it helps everyone remember the goal of creating the game: to transform the 
player. But if that is our goal, how exactly will we transform them? All too often, 
designers state their goal as “my game teaches math” or “my game gets people to 
exercise.” But those are just vague statements. They say nothing about what kind 
of change takes place in the player or how that change is to come about. Consider 
how much clearer it is when you say “my game changes players by introducing 
them to the concept of factoring and builds their familiarity with factors by giving 
them practice at breaking down composite numbers into their base factors” or “my 
game helps players develop a daily habit of exercise by giving them small, achiev­
able challenges each day.” To create successful and meaningful transformations, 

508
CHAPTER Thirty-Two • GAMES TRANSFORM THEIR PLAYERS
you must clearly state the change you want to take place and also the specifics of 
how and why your game will foster that change. Really, this is our old friend, 
Lens #14, Problem Statement. Of course, to create a successful transformational 
game, you must come up with a solid solution to how you enable the transforma­
tion, but you can’t possibly do that until you have clearly stated what transformation 
needs to take place.
Transformational Tip #2: Find Great Subject Matter Experts
You might think, “I can’t make a great game about teaching firefighters how to deal 
with chemical spills—I don’t know anything about that!” Of course you don’t. Sure, 
you could learn a little, by reading a few articles or books, but there are people out 
there who have devoted their lives to knowing every detail about a topic like that 
and how to best teach it to others. Find these people. They are usually thrilled to be 
able to take their expertise into a new dimension and eager to make sure you have 
every detail right. It is important to realize that there are two kinds of experts—
ones that have all the facts and others that know the best ways to teach those facts. 
If you can align yourself with both kinds of experts and you can learn to listen to 
them about what is and isn’t important, you will be taking great strides toward 
making a truly great transformational game.
Transformational Tip #3: What Does the Instructor Need?
So often, designers of transformational and educational games set out to create an 
experience that replaces the need for a skilled instructor. There is a time and place 
for that kind of application, certainly, when instructors are in short supply, for 
example. But often, the reality of transformational games is that they are used by 
an instructor to help transform someone—and if that is the case, why try to replace 
them? Trying to do so only will insult the instructor, and be honest, how can your 
little game replace that instructor’s lifetime of experience? Much better is to figure 
out how to make your game a tool for the instructor. But of course, to do that, you 
will need to talk to instructors, to see what problems they have (problem statement, 
again!) and how perhaps your game can help. Often, as we discussed earlier, the 
instructor is looking for better ways to create teachable moments. Instead of try­
ing to replace the instructor, why not think about making the instructor a kind of 
“dungeon master” who can be in charge of a scenario that challenges students with 
difficult problems? Then you get the benefit of the instructor’s wisdom and experi­
ence, not to mention their gratitude because you created a tool that magnifies their 
abilities and helps them achieve your shared goal of transforming students for the 
better. I believe that one of the greatest changes we will see to the effectiveness of 
transformational games is when every student and teacher has a standardized net­
worked tablet. Once that happens, experiences where a teacher can guide students 

509
Transformational Games
through multiplayer game simulations will suddenly become feasible, and I expect 
they will have a striking effect on education.
Transformational Tip #4: Don’t Do Too Much
It is tempting to set a goal of replacing an entire curriculum with your amazing 
do-everything transformational game. And usually, when you do this, you end up 
with something that does everything poorly. It is much better to pick one key trans­
formation and do that especially well. If it works and everyone likes it, they will 
ask for more, and then you can think about what the next steps should be. Most of 
the really effective transformational games (such as Peacemaker, Dragon Box Plus, 
Zombie Division, and Papers Please) strive for only one type of transformation and 
focus on doing that as well as possible.
Transformational Tip #5: Assess Transformation Appropriately
One of the most challenging things about creating transformational games is know­
ing whether the intended transformation actually took place. The truth is that most 
transformational games are experimental, and until the games are finished, it can be 
hard to know if they are really making the intended changes in the player. I have found 
there are generally five levels of assessment, which I list in ascending order of rigor:
	1.	 Feels like it: This is the lowest possible level of assessment. This is when the 
designers and players agree that it “feels like” some transformation is taking place. 
While this is arguably better than “feels like it’s not working,” it still isn’t much.
	2.	 Anecdotes: This is when you have some stories about situations where people 
played your game and it clearly caused some kind of useful transformation. 
Anecdotes can be very inspiring and sound good in a pitch, but they aren’t much 
proof of effectiveness.
	3.	 Subject matter expert (SME) approval: If you have high-quality SMEs, their 
stamp of approval that the game is an effective tool for transformation is very 
meaningful. Again, it isn’t really proof that it is working, but it is certainly a 
strong indicator that you are on the right track.
	4.	 Informal surveys and assessment: Tests either during your game or after the 
fact demonstrating a change in the player are an even better way to prove that 
your game is doing its job.
	5.	 Scientific testing and assessment: Formalized testing, organized by scien­
tists who are knowledgeable about the subject matter and who know enough 
about statistics to conduct meaningful scientific analysis of your players, is cer­
tainly the ideal way to prove to yourself that your game is causing the desired 
transformation.

510
CHAPTER Thirty-Two • GAMES TRANSFORM THEIR PLAYERS
Of course, meaningful scientific testing is time consuming and expensive. Different 
situations call for different methods. It’s important, going into a transformational 
games project, that the whole team be on the same page about how much rigor is 
necessary to feel good about what you are doing.
Transformational Tip #6: Choose the Right Venue
Remember Chapter 3, “Venue”? It isn’t enough to just make a game—you need to 
think hard about where your players will be when they play it and how that will 
affect the transformation. Will they play in the classroom? On the go? In a comfort­
able reading nook? In a workbench situation? Will they be alone or with others? 
Will they have unlimited time or a limited time window? Will anyone be there to 
help them, or are they on their own? The context of where, how, and with whom 
your game is played will make a tremendous difference in whether you meet your 
transformational goals.
Transformational Tip #7: Accept the Realities of the Market
I constantly talk to people who have all kinds of beautiful dreams about using games 
for all manner of transformational purpose. The truth is, though, it can be very chal­
lenging to find a way to turn great transformational games into a sustainable business 
model. Wishful thinking won’t get you there—what will is a clear understanding of 
what people will and will not pay for and why. Your amazing transformational games 
won’t change anyone if you can’t afford to get them made and can’t find a way to get 
them to the people who need them. For that reason, business savvy can be just as 
important as excellent game design in making a difference in the world.
Can Games Be Bad for You?
Some people are afraid of anything new. This is not unreasonable: many new things 
are dangerous. Games and gameplay are not new, of course; they have been around 
since the dawn of man. And traditional games have their dangers: sports can cause 
physical injury, gambling can lead to financial ruin, and obsession with any pas­
time can lead to a life out of balance.
But these dangers are not new. They are well known, and society has methods 
of handling them. What makes people nervous, especially parents, are the poten­
tial dangers of new types of games that have suddenly appeared in popular culture. 
Parents are always nervous when their children become immersed in something that 
the parents did not grow up with. As a parent, it is an uncomfortable feeling, because 
you have no idea how to properly guide your children and no idea how to properly 
keep them safe. The two areas that cause the most concern are violence and addiction.

511
Can Games Be Bad for You?
Violence
As we’ve discussed, games and stories frequently feature violent themes, because 
games and stories are often about conflict and violent action is a simple, dramatic 
way to settle a conflict. But no one worries much about the abstract violence that 
takes place in chess, Go, or Pac-Man. The game of chess does not seem to inspire the 
capture of real-world bishops and queens. Worries come about violence that is visu­
ally graphic. One focus group I witnessed was trying to determine where the aver­
age mom drew the line about what videogames were “too violent” for their kids. 
“Virtua Fighter was okay,” said the moms, “Mortal Kombat was not.” The ­difference? 
Blood. It wasn’t the actions that were involved in the games that bothered them 
(both games are mostly about kicking your opponent in the face), but rather the 
graphic bloodshed in Mortal Kombat that is completely absent in Virtua Fighter. 
They seemed to feel that without bloodshed, it was just a game—just imaginary. But 
the blood made the game creepily real, and to the moms in the interviews, a game 
that rewarded bloodshed felt perverse and dangerous.
But there have been many games without any visible blood that have raised con­
cern. The 1974 game Death Race, based on the movie Death Race 2000, was a racing 
game that rewarded players for running down little animated pedestrians. When 
angry parents began to protest this game appearing in local arcades, the publisher 
tried to make people believe that they weren’t people, but “goblins” that you were 
supposed to run down with your car. No one believed that because the dangers of 
reckless driving are too real.
When we did the very first test of Pirates of the Caribbean: Battle for the Buccaneer 
Gold for DisneyQuest, we were terrified. We were bringing families into play the 
game, and their reaction was going to determine the future of the game. Everyone 
on the team was very uncomfortable because the Columbine high school shootings 
had happened less than a week before, and here we were showing a game where 
you pulled the trigger on a cannon, over and over, blasting everything in sight.
To our surprise, no one even made the connection, and all the families had great 
fun. No one expressed any concerns at all about the game being too violent, even 
though we expressly asked about this in our interviews. Pirate cannons shooting 
down cartoon enemies were so far removed from the real world that it didn’t cause 
the slightest concern.
What accounts for these differences and inconsistencies? A simple fear: playing 
games with realistic violent content might make people desensitized to real-world 
violence or, worse, make them feel that real-world violence is fun and pleasurable.
How valid is this concern? It is hard to say for sure. We know it is possible to 
become desensitized to blood and gore: doctors and nurses must do this to function 
and make rational decisions during surgery. Soldiers and police officers must take 
it a step further and become desensitized to wounding and killing others, so they 
can think clearly in situations where they must commit violent acts. But this kind 
of desensitization isn’t what parents are worried about—after all, if playing video­
games made people grow into better doctors and law enforcement officials, there 

512
CHAPTER Thirty-Two • GAMES TRANSFORM THEIR PLAYERS
wouldn’t be much cause for concern. No, the worry about game violence is about 
the apparent similarity between the videogame player and the murderous psycho­
path—after all, both kill for fun.
But do violent games bring about this kind of psychopathic desensitization, or 
is something different happening? As we’ve discussed, the more someone plays a 
game, the more they see through the aesthetics of the game (for graphic violence is 
just an aesthetic choice) and put their minds in the pure problem-solving world of 
game mechanics. Even though the avatar may be going on a killing rampage, the 
player generally does not have thoughts of rage or murder, but thoughts of perfecting 
skills, solving puzzles, and accomplishing goals. Despite the millions of people who 
play games with violent themes, it is rare to hear a story about someone who felt 
drawn to act out a violent game in real life. It would seem that the average person is 
very good at distinguishing the difference between the fantasy world and real world. 
With the exception of those who already have violent psychotic tendencies, most of 
us seem to be able to compartmentalize: we know that a game is just a game.
But the concern that most have is not about adults—it is about children and teen­
agers who are still forming their views of the world. Are they able to safely compart­
mentalize violent play? We know they can with some kinds of play. Gerard Jones, 
in his book Killing Monsters, in fact makes the case that some level of violent play is 
not only natural, but necessary for healthy psychological development. But surely, 
there are limits. There are some images and ideas that children are not yet ready to 
deal with, and this is why rating systems for videogames are absolutely necessary 
so that parents can make informed choices about what their children can play with.
So, do violent videogames change us for the worse? Psychology is too imperfect 
a science to give a definitive answer, especially with something so new. So far, they 
don’t seem to have damaged our collective psyche, but as designers, we must be on 
guard. New advances in technology will continue to make possible more and more 
extreme types of violent play, and perhaps we will, without warning, find ourselves 
crossing some invisible line into gameplay that really does change people for the 
worse. This seems unlikely to me personally, but to say that it is impossible would 
be arrogant and irresponsible.
Addiction
The second greatest fear people have about the dangers of gaming is that of addic­
tion, that is, playing so much that it is interfering with or damaging more important 
things in life, such as school, work, health, and personal relationships. This is not 
just a concern about too much gameplaying, because after all, too much of anything 
(exercise, broccoli, vitamin C, oxygen) can be detrimental. No, this is a fear about 
compulsive behavior that a person is unable to give up, even though it is clearly 
having harmful consequences.
It is true that designers do continuously seek to create games that capture and 
engage the mind—games that make you want to keep playing. When someone is 

513
Can Games Be Bad for You?
excited about a new game, it isn’t unusual for them to compliment it by saying, “I 
love it! It’s so addictive!” But by this, they rarely mean that the game is damaging 
their lives, but rather that they feel some kind of pull to keep returning to it.
But there are people who play games so much that their lives suffer for it. Modern 
massively multiplayer games, with their huge worlds, social obligations, and multi­
year play goals, definitely draw certain people into self-destructive patterns of play.
It is worth pointing out that self-destructive gameplaying is nothing new. 
Gambling is one form that has been around for ages, but it is a special case, since it 
is the exogenous, not endogenous rewards that are so addictive. Even without mon­
etary rewards, though, there have long been cases of people playing games more 
than they should. The most common cases are college students. My grandparents 
used to talk about classmates who had to drop out of school from spending too 
much time playing bridge. Stephen King’s novel Hearts in Atlantis is a story (based 
on true events) about college students who fail out of school due to their addiction 
to the card game of Hearts and end up drafted into the Vietnam war as a result. In 
the 1970s, overplay of Dungeons & Dragons led to poor academic performance, and 
today League of Legends serves as an uncontrollable temptation for many students.
Nicholas Yee performed a very thoughtful study of the factors involved in “prob­
lematic usage” of games, where he shows that the reasons for self-destructive game­
play are different for different types of people or as he says:
The issue of MMORPG addiction is complex because different players are 
attracted to different aspects of the game, to different degrees, and may or 
may not be motivated by external factors that are using the game as an out­
let. Sometimes the game is pulling the player in; sometimes a real-life prob­
lem is pushing the player in. Oftentimes, it is a combination of both. There is 
no one way to treat MMORPG addiction because there are many reasons why 
people become obsessed with or addicted to MMORPGs. If you consider yourself 
addicted to MMORPGs and your playing habits are causing you real life prob­
lems, or if someone close to you has playing habits which are obsessive and 
unhealthy, consider seeking the help of a professional counselor or therapist who 
is trained in addiction problems.
There is no denying that for some people, this can be a real problem. The question 
is, “What can game designers do about it?” Some have suggested that if the design­
ers wouldn’t build in such attractive qualities, the problem would go away. But to 
suggest that it is irresponsible for designers to create games that are “too engag­
ing” is like saying that overeating is the fault of irresponsible bakers who insist on 
making cake taste “too delicious.” It is incumbent upon game designers, who are 
responsible for the play experiences they create, to find ways to make game struc­
tures fit into a well-balanced life. We cannot forget this or pretend it is someone 
else’s problem. It should be on all our minds, just as it is on the mind of designer 
Shigeru Miyamoto, who often signs his autograph for children with the following 
note: “On a sunny day, play outside.”

514
CHAPTER Thirty-Two • GAMES TRANSFORM THEIR PLAYERS
Experiences
So, do games change people? We have discussed at length the fact that we aren’t 
really designing games, we are designing experiences. And experiences are the 
only things that can change people—sometimes in unexpected ways. When creat­
ing Toontown Online, we created a chat system where players could communi­
cate quickly by picking phrases off a menu. Polite interactions between players 
seemed to us an important part of the Toontown aesthetic, and we felt it helped 
encourage cooperative play, so most of the phrases are supportive and encouraging 
(“Thanks!” “Good job!” etc.). This was in sharp contrast to standard MMO culture, 
which involves a lot of trash-talking—insulting the people you play with, as rudely 
as possible. During beta testing, we were surprised to get an e-mail from a player 
who was upset with us. He explained that normally he played Dark Ages of Camelot 
and started playing Toontown on the side. Gradually, though, he found himself 
playing Toontown more and Dark Ages less. The reason he was upset with us was 
that Toontown had changed his habits—he found that he tended not to trash-talk 
anymore and was inclined to thank everyone who helped. He was embarrassed 
(but also grudgingly grateful) that a simple game for children had manipulated his 
thought patterns so easily.
You might think that changing someone’s communication pattern is not that 
big a deal—but returning to the question of violence, consider, for a moment, what 
violence really is. Not the violence of stories or games, but real-world violence. In 
the real world, violence is seldom a means toward an end; instead, it is a form of 
communication—one that people resort to when all else fails. It is a desperate way 
of saying “I’m going to show you how much you are hurting me!”
We are just starting to understand how games can change us. It is imperative 
that we learn more about how they do, because the more we learn, the more we can 
use them not just as an amusement, but as a valuable tool for improving the human 
condition. Take this lens to help you remember this important idea.
Lens #110: The Lens of Transformation
Games create experiences, and experiences change people. To make sure only 
the best changes happen to your players, ask yourself these questions:
●
●
How can my game change players for the better?
●
●
How can my game change players for the worse?

The Danger of Obscurity
You should be prepared to understand that as a game designer, you are not going to 
get a lot of respect. If you manage to find a way to design games professionally, you 
can expect a lot of conversations like this:
Friend of a friend: So, what do you do?
You: I design videogames.
Friend of a friend (clearly uncomfortable): Oh… so, like that Grand Theft Auto?
It’s the same as if everyone who makes films were asked, “Oh… so, you’re a 
pornographer?”

519
Being Accountable
But you really can’t blame people. There is a lot of lurid material in the world 
of videogames, and lurid stories always get the most press. Slowly, this will surely 
change, as games become more and more mainstream. But even as it does, and it 
becomes less embarrassing to be a game designer, it will continue to be a profes­
sion where it is difficult to become famous, well known, or respected. Screenwriters 
have the same problem: people generally don’t care who makes the things they 
like, and the publishers would rather you didn’t become famous anyway, because 
it makes you expensive. But I’m not complaining about this—I am only mentioning 
it to point out something quite dangerous: Because you will be able to work in rela­
tive obscurity, no one is going to ask you to take responsibility for what you create.
And you might say, “It’s not my name on the line, it’s the name of the publisher, 
and they’re so worried about getting sued, I’m sure they won’t let anything out the 
door that would hurt anybody.”
But are you sure? Corporations make mistakes all the time. And further, corpora­
tions have no ethical responsibility. Sure, they have to follow the law, but beyond 
that, their sole and single purpose is to generate money, and ethics don’t enter into 
it, because corporations have no souls. Bank accounts, yes, legal responsibility, yes, 
but not souls—and that means no ethical responsibility. Only individuals can take 
ethical responsibility. Are you going to assume that game company managers are 
going to take on that kind of personal responsibility? They might, but you and I 
know they probably won’t. No, there is only one person who can take responsibility 
for what you create, and that is you.
Being Accountable
In Chapter 32, “Transform,” we talked about some ways that games might be dan­
gerous. And as new technologies arrive, there are also new ways for games to acci­
dentally do harm. Of all the dangers that games might or might not contain, the 
one that is most real and undeniable for players of online games is the potential to 
meet with dangerous strangers. When most people think about making their online 
game “safe,” they think about making sure that children aren’t exposed to foul 
language. But while foul language may be inappropriate, it has nothing to do with 
safety. No, the real danger is the fact that online games can be a mask of anonymity 
that dangerous people can use to take advantage of innocents. If you are designing 
a game that involves strangers talking to each other, you must take responsibility 
for what that might lead to. This is one of the rare cases where your choices in game 
design could cause lives to be saved or lost. You might think there is a one in a mil­
lion chance of something dangerous happening in your game, but if that is true, 
and your game is so successful that five million people play it, that dangerous thing 
will happen five times.
Many designers decide that they cannot be held responsible for what happens in 
their game, and they leave it to the lawyers to decide what is and is not safe. But are 
you content to leave your ethical responsibility in the hands of corporate lawyers?

CHAPTER Thirty-Three • DESIGNERS HAVE CERTAIN RESPONSIBILITIES
If you aren’t willing to take personal responsibility for the games you make, you 
shouldn’t be making them. I worked on one project where the team felt so strongly 
about this we asked our concept artist to create an image of what the cover of Time 
magazine would look like the week a child was abducted due to a lack of commu­
nication safeguards in our game. We never showed it outside the team, but every 
one of us burned this image into our minds to help us remember the responsibility 
that was on our shoulders.
Your Hidden Agenda
But you might argue that your game really is safe—there is no way it could do harm. 
And you might be right. Consider this: Is it possible you could find a way for your 
game to do good? To somehow make people’s lives better? If you know this is pos­
sible, and you choose not to do it, isn’t that, in a way, just as bad as making a game 
that harms people?
Now, don’t get me wrong—I’m not the type who is going to tell you that it is the 
responsibility of game companies to better the human race, even if it means losing 
some profits. The only responsibility of a game company is to make money. The 
responsibility for making games do good lies solely with you. Am I saying that you 
should try to convince management that your title will be better if it can somehow 
improve mankind? I am not. Management won’t care about that—their job is to 
serve the corporation, and the corporation only cares about making money.
What I am telling you is that, if you want to, you can design your games so that 
they will improve people’s lives, but you will probably need to do this in secret. 
Generally, it will not serve you well to tell management about how it is important 
to you that you use the powerful medium of games to help people, because if they 
know that is your goal, they will think your priorities are out of whack. But they 
aren’t. For if you make a game that is really good for people, but no one likes it 
(the game version of a broccoli smoothie), you haven’t helped anyone. The only 
way your games can serve humanity is if as many people play them as possible. 
The trick is to figure out what you can put into your best-selling games that will 
transform players for the better. You might think this impossible—that people only 
like what is bad for them. But it isn’t true. One thing people like better than almost 
anything else is being cared for. And if you can manage, through your game, to 
make your players into better people, they will feel, appreciate, and remember that 
rare feeling that someone else cares what they become.
The Secret Hidden in Plain Sight
Is it overkill to put this much consideration into the effect that games have on peo­
ple? It is not. Games are not just trivial amusements. Games are a means of creating 
experiences, and life itself is composed of nothing but experiences. Moreover, the 

521
The Ring
experiences that game designers create aren’t everyday experiences—they are ones 
where people live out their fantasies and strive to become what they have always 
secretly wished to be. Fantasy worlds created for children become modern mythol­
ogy—shared story worlds that stay with them as a guiding compass for the rest of 
their lives. We create utopias: ideal societies to which all nations are compared.
It is not enough to think of how games affect people today—we must consider 
how they will affect people tomorrow. You are working in, and inventing, the 
medium that will subsume all others. The medium that a person is immersed in 
when they are young defines how they will think for their entire lives. As you con­
tinue to invent and improve the medium of games, you are defining the thought 
process of the next generation. This is no trivial matter.
When you think about it, is there any human activity that cannot be viewed as a 
game, and therefore benefit from the principles of good game design?
The Ring
Have you ever thought about your pinky? How it is strangely smaller than all the 
other fingers? It almost seems like an accident—like some kind of withered append­
age. But it isn’t. It has a purpose that most of us are completely unaware of. Your 
pinky guides your hand. Every time you pick something up or put something down 
on a surface, your pinky is there first, feeling things out like a little antenna and 
safely guiding the hand into position.
In 1922, Rudyard Kipling was asked by the University of Toronto to create a 
ritual to help remind graduating engineers of their obligation to help society. At the 
conclusion of this solemn ritual, still practiced today, the engineer is given an iron 
ring, placed on the pinky finger of their dominant hand, as a lifelong reminder of 
this obligation.
One day, game designers may concoct their own ritual of obligation, but you 
don’t have time to wait for that. Your obligation begins today—this minute. If you 
truly believe that games can help people, then, here—take this ring. It is invisible, 
like mine—that way, you can’t lose it. If you are willing to accept the responsibili­
ties that go along with being a game designer, then you should put it on. Wear it as 
a reminder to let these responsibilities guide your hand. Think about it carefully 
before you put the ring on, though, because it doesn’t come off. Oh—and if you look 
closely, you’ll see it bears this inscription:

CHAPTER Thirty-Four • EACH DESIGNER HAS A PURPOSE
The Deepest Theming
At the start of this book, we talked about how listening is the most important skill 
for a game designer. And through the book, we examined facets of listening to your 
audience, to your game, to your team, and to your client.
But now, it is time to talk about the most important type of listening—listening 
to yourself. You might think it is easy to listen to yourself. But our subconscious 
mind holds many secrets. We often do things, and we don’t know why. Why, for 
instance, is game design so very important to you? Do you know? You might think 
that the time for this kind of self-reflection can come later. But it can’t, because 
life is very short. In a blink, you will look up and realize you don’t have any time 
left. For time destroys everything and takes everything away. Like Poe’s raven, 
it mocks you, cackling “nevermore” as it glides into the night. You can’t stop it. 
Your only hope is to do your important work now while you still can. You must 
run like death is behind you because death is behind you. Quick—take this lens 
so you don’t forget.
But what is that important work? How can you know? This is why you must 
learn to listen to yourself. There is some important purpose that is hidden inside 
you, and you must find out what it is. Surely, there is some reason you are going 
through all the trouble of trying to design great games. Maybe it is because you can 
see something in your mind’s eye that you feel will change someone’s life. Maybe 
it is because of something wonderful that you experienced once, and you want to 
share it with the world. Maybe something terrible happened to someone you loved, 
and you want to be sure it never happens again, to anyone. No one can know this 
purpose but you, and no one needs to know it but you. We spoke about how much 
more powerful your game will be if you know its theme, but do you know your own 
personal theme? You must figure it out as soon as possible, for once you know it, 
you will undergo an important creative change: your conscious and subconscious 
motivations will be united, and your work will gain a passion, a focus, and an inten­
sity that cannot possibly be greater.
To help you find your true motivation, take this final lens.

My goodness! Look at the time! I’ve talked long enough to fill a whole book. Thank 
you so much for dropping in—I really do enjoy talking about these things with 
someone as thoughtful and insightful as you are. Say, what was that clever anagram 
you mentioned? If I mix up the letters in “art of game design,” it spells “ragged…” 
something? Oh, yes! Very clever! I’ll have to remember that!
You have your map? Your ring? And all your lenses? Good, good. No, really, 
you can keep them—if you promise to use them. You can find a helpful deck of 
lens cards at http://artofgamedesign.com. And good luck with that game you men­
tioned—it sounds really fun! Let me know when we can try it out! If you are ever 
online, feel free to post your design progress on http://gamesprout.com, which is a 
great place to get feedback from me and other designers.
Thanks again for coming, and thanks so much for listening.
Keep in touch, okay?
After all, we game designers have to stick together.

similar triad of psychologist, anthropologist, and artist. Marc Prensky, in Digital 
Game Based Learning, talks about the three paths to knowledge: “The analytical 
path, where philosophers reflect, mediate, and make sense of objects and events; 
the empirical path, where scientists manipulate variables and conduct controlled 
experiments to validate reliable principles; and the pragmatic path where prac­
titioners struggle with real-world challenges and come up with strategies for 
effective and efficient performance.” Analytical corresponds to anthropology, 
empirical to psychology, and pragmatic to design.

story is most important.’ Are you saying that is not true in games?” I answered 
that not only is it not true in games, it is not true at Pixar. Did the Pixar team 
choose to make Toy Story because a story about plastic toys would be the best 
story anyone could tell? No—they chose it because their technology at the time 
prevented them from telling compelling stories about human beings. Plastic toys, 
though, they could render. So, in that case, technology came first, but then story 
was used to support it, and as with all great things, the different elements all sup­
ported each other.

you, then learn this simple rule: to convert from age to grade, just subtract five. 
That way, when someone says “What kind of game is good for 10–12 year olds?” 
you can automatically access your memories by thinking about what you and 
your friends liked in 5th, 6th, and 7th grades.

Chapter 15: Interface
Page 256—“Sometimes, the virtual layer is so thin as to be non-existent…” People 
who like Greek words call virtual interface “diegetic interface,” which is bor­
rowed from the world of sound design. “Diegetic” sound effects and music heard 
by the audience, but not by the characters in the film. Virtual interface is a good 
parallel.

Chapter 17: Story
Page 304—“How could you make a game out of Romeo and Juliet…” I was discuss­

made time travel impossible in our universe to ensure that our decisions meant 
something. I still lie awake at night thinking about this.
Page 304—“…has to be clever indeed.” MMOs do not have save points—and there­
fore have no time travel. It may well be that the most moving and dramatic 
gameplay experiences will thus come from that medium.

a Likert scale, if you want to sound like you know what you are talking about. 
Most people pronounce it Like-urt, but Dr. Likert pronounced it Lick-urt, so basi­
cally it is dealer’s choice. Maybe we should ask people to rate the two pronuncia­
