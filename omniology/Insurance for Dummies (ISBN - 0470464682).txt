Dedication
To Jewels, the love of my life for 40 years, for her support of the original 
year-long project, for sacrificing much of our time together, and for her 
being quiet as a mouse so I could concentrate on the updates needed for this 
second edition (not easy to do for a flaming extrovert!).
And to the One from whom all inspiration flows, who gave me the vision for 
this book, the passion for the subject, and the help along the way that made 
it all possible.


Author’s Acknowledgments
Both the original and second edition of this book would never have been 
possible without the help of many people. In addition to those people who 
were so helpful in assisting me with the first edition, there are some others 
I would like to acknowledge for their help with this second edition. I’d like 
to especially thank my wonderful insurance agent and account manager, 
Carol Bechay, who was able to handle the majority of the needs of my clients 
during the writing process. Thanks again to the multitalented Shaun Kuffel 
for taking such good care of my business clients and helping me solve all 
kinds of computer dilemmas. Thanks, Brett Erickson, for saving the day and 
my sanity when my printer kept crashing. Thanks again to Linda Peterson 
for her continued administrative assistance with the updates to several 
chapters. Thanks again to Jeanne Hansen, my agent, for all the effort in first 
believing my book had potential, for all the effort in finding a publisher, and 
for her help in negotiating the deal. Thanks to the customer-service agents at 
Corporate 4 Insurance Agency in Edina, Minnesota, where I office, for cover-
ing for me and servicing my clients: Randy Macey, Sharon Anderson, Dawn 
Nelson, Margaret Woolery, and Mary Page.
Thanks to these insurance folks for their technical assistance: Michael Sir 
(long-term disability), Sonia Kieffer (flood), Rob Olson of IRMI (auto, home, 
and umbrella), Debra Newman (long-term care), and Ivey Jackson (medical 
evacuation). Thanks to Maxine Coldren for again allowing use of her calligra-
phy talents on the Perils of the Sea artwork in Chapter 1.
Thanks to all the folks at John Wiley & Sons for their efforts on this second 
edition, especially my editor, Elizabeth Kuball. Her regular challenges to me 
to clarify passages definitely make this second edition easier for readers to 
understand.
A special thanks to those many clients who have believed enough in my 
efforts to offer value-added agent services to support the concept financially. 
I am still in business today, almost 30 years later because of them. Thanks to 
those of you whose stories I have anonymously shared in this book to help 
make for better understanding by readers.
And finally, thanks to a fine gentleman, Mr. E. W. Blanch, Sr., a staunch sup-
porter of insurance education and professionalism, who provided me with 
my first job in the insurance business 30 years ago and who, unknowingly, 
became a source of inspiration and resolve on my part to pursue those same 
ideals.

Introduction
“I
t takes rough seas to make good captains.” So says a plaque on my 
desk, given to me by a good friend who knows that I love to sail.
Storms do come up, in all shapes, sizes, and colors: fires, tornadoes, hurri-
canes, earthquakes, floods, premature death, disability, catastrophic health 
problems, lawsuits . . . the list goes on and on. You can’t always prevent these 
storms from occurring. But you can take many constructive actions before 
the storms occur that greatly reduce the damage they cause in your life.
You’re already familiar with many of these actions, such as controlling 
your diet, exercising, wearing your seatbelt, driving a car with an airbag, 
and installing a home alarm system. And you’re at least a little familiar with 
the device that allows you to share the impact of any losses you have with 
others — insurance.
Insurance. A dreaded word for most people. Its cringe factor ranks right up 
there with such joys as filling out your income-tax return, or balancing your 
checkbook when the bank says you’re $500 overdrawn, or shopping for your 
own cemetery plot. My beloved wife, Judy, has a favorite saying when she 
has to deal with such dreaded tasks: “I’d rather eat glass!”
If you’re a cringer when it comes to insurance, I wrote Insurance For Dummies 
for you. In this book, not only do I demystify the complexity of insurance poli-
cies, but I also point out the traps and pitfalls and tell you how you can best 
protect yourself from getting hurt by them. I wrote this book so that when 
you need help understanding any insurance topic, you can pull the book 
down from the shelf and quickly find what you need to know to protect your-
self properly.
About This Book
Insurance For Dummies is a reference. You don’t need to read the chapters in 
order from beginning to end — instead, dip into the book to find the informa-
tion you need today, and pull it down off the shelf when you have questions 
next week, next month, or next year. I don’t expect you to remember any-
thing in this book, either — there won’t be a test on it. You can always return 
to the book when you have questions.

2
Insurance For Dummies, 2nd Edition 
This book is different from other insurance books in several important ways:
 
✓ This book is written by someone who has actually worked in the 
trenches, directly with consumers (people like you!), helping them cre-
atively manage and insure the risks in their lives. So I’ve filled this book 
with practical, hands-on advice that really works — not academic stuff.
 
✓ This book emphasizes solutions to problems other than just buying 
insurance. In fact, I include a whole chapter on creative non-insurance 
strategies that not only help prevent or reduce the chances of a loss 
happening, but can also lower your insurance costs — strategies like 
putting jewelry you don’t wear in a safe-deposit box rather than insuring 
it, or carrying higher deductibles than normal on your health insurance 
if you’re fit and healthy.
 
✓ This book includes two full chapters on getting what you deserve at 
claim time — for both claims for damage to your car as well as to your 
home and belongings. These chapters contain tips I’ve gathered from 
my experience as a claims adjuster and an agent, helping clients get 
what they deserve for 30 years, including
 
• How to get paid top dollar for your car when it’s stolen or totaled 
in a collision
 
• How to be in the driver’s seat and minimize hassles when dealing 
with insurance adjusters
 
• How to create an inventory of your belongings, after they’re stolen, 
so that you can collect the full value of what you lost
 
✓ This book addresses all areas of personal insurance. Most insurance 
books are more limited — for example, covering only life insurance, only 
health insurance, or maybe auto and homeowner’s insurance together. 
But this book covers just about every type of insurance you could ever 
need help with.
Conventions Used in This Book
I don’t use many special conventions in this book, but there are a few you 
should be aware of:
 
✓ When I introduce a new term, I put it in italics, followed by a definition of 
the term (often in parentheses).
 
✓ I list Web addresses and e-mail addresses in monofont, so they stand 
out from the surrounding text.

3
 Introduction
Note: When this book was printed, some Web addresses may have needed to 
break across two lines of text. If that happened, rest assured that we haven’t 
put in any extra characters (such as hyphens) to indicate the break. So, when 
using one of these Web addresses, just type in exactly what you see in this 
book, pretending as though the line break doesn’t exist.
What You’re Not to Read
You don’t have to read any text preceded by a Technical Stuff icon (see 
the “Icons Used in This Book” section, later, for more on icons) in order to 
understand the subject at hand. And you can safely skip sidebars (text in gray 
boxes), too — read them if you want the full picture, but know that you can 
skip them without missing anything critical.
Foolish Assumptions
I don’t make many assumptions about you, but I do assume that you’re a 
consumer looking to buy insurance for the first time, or adjust your insur-
ance based on life changes. You may even be an insurance agent (new or sea-
soned), who’s looking for an easy way to explain insurance to your clients.
How This Book Is Organized
Insurance For Dummies is divided into six parts. Here’s a thumbnail sketch of 
what each part contains.
Part I: Getting Started
In your lifetime, you will face hundreds of insurance decisions. How much 
is enough coverage for lawsuits? How big a deductible should you choose? 
Should you buy earthquake insurance if you live in Nebraska?
In this part, I fill you in on seven principles that help you make good insur-
ance decisions — principles like “Don’t risk more than you can afford to lose” 
or “Consider the odds.” I also give you non-insurance strategies for reducing 
the chances of a loss in your life — strategies that can help lower your insur-
ance costs. Finally, I show you the smart way to buy insurance so you’ll have 
all the right coverage when you need it most — at claim time.

Insurance For Dummies, 2nd Edition 
Part II: Cars, Boats, RVs, and More: 
Insuring the Things You Drive
Cars. Boats. Trailers. Recreational vehicles. Whether you own, borrow, or 
rent, in this part, I give you answers to questions like:
 
✓ How much coverage should you buy for lawsuit protection?
 
✓ How large a deductible makes good sense for you?
 
✓ How do you properly insure your 1965 Mustang, fully restored, so you 
get paid top dollar for it if it’s stolen?
 
✓ How can you avoid being uninsured when you rent cars?
Plus, I offer strategies that you can use to get paid what you deserve for your 
auto insurance claims.
Part III: Home Sweet Home: Understanding 
Homeowner’s Insurance
In this part, I show you how to insure your home and your belongings. I 
explain what kinds of personal property aren’t covered by a typical hom-
eowner’s policy and tell you how you can get them covered. I introduce you 
to the most common homeowner’s policy exclusions and show you how you 
can avoid being hurt by them. I cover the special needs of renters and con-
dominium owners. I tell you how to cover yourself against personal lawsuits. 
And I even show you some of the basics when it comes to insuring a home 
business. Finally, I teach you some strategies to avoid problems and collect 
what you deserve for homeowner’s property claims.
Part IV: Singin’ in the Rain: 
Umbrella Policies and More
Many people don’t realize that, despite their best intentions, they’re still 
at risk of being sued. In this part, I introduce you to umbrella policies, and 
explain how they protect you from catastrophic lawsuits. I show you how to 
choose an umbrella policy that covers you for lawsuits not covered by your 
other policies.
In this part, I also fill you in on the changes you should make to your insur-
ance program when you experience changes in your life, such as getting mar-
ried, having a baby, hiring a nanny, and losing a loved one.

5
 Introduction
Part V: Managing Life, Health, 
and Disability Risks
In this part, I show you how to calculate how much life insurance to buy and 
what type is best. I offer tips on buying individual health insurance. And I 
introduce you to Medicare, including prescription drug coverage, and show 
you what makes a good Medicare supplement policy. I also give advice on 
buying long-term disability and long-term-care insurance.
Part VI: The Part of Tens
This wouldn’t be a For Dummies book without The Part of Tens. In this part, 
I describe the ten ingredients of a watertight insurance program, outline ten 
government insurance programs and explain how they work, and show you 
ten ways to save big bucks on car insurance.
Icons Used in This Book
Throughout this book, I use icons (little pictures in the margins) to draw your 
attention to certain kinds of information. Here are the icons I use and a key to 
what they mean:
 
This icon reminds you of information so important that you should read it 
more than once, just to make sure it stays with you.
 
Maybe you want to know a little more on why some insurance strategies work 
better than others. Maybe you’re dying to know the mathematical model I rec-
ommend for choosing the most cost-effective deductibles for you. This icon is 
the place to look for that sort of information. On the other hand, if you just 
want to catch the basic concepts, give this icon a pass.
 
This icon flags things that are especially useful for making the most of your 
insurance program.
 
This icon alerts you to areas of potential danger. Read any paragraphs that 
are flagged with this icon and take a close look at your life and your insur-
ance situation.

Insurance For Dummies, 2nd Edition 
Where to Go from Here
You’ve got your copy of Insurance For Dummies. Now what? You can dive into 
this book wherever you want! If you’re a new homeowner looking to insure 
your humble abode, head to Part III. If you have a sneaking suspicion that you 
don’t have the best car insurance, turn to Part II. Use the index and table of 
contents to locate the topics you’re most interested in today.
My wish for you is that your sail through life be a mostly peaceful one, full of 
gentle breezes. But if storms do come up, I hope the information and the tips 
I share with you in this book help you buy just the right insurance so that 
you’re fully covered and get paid promptly and fairly.

Part I
Getting Started

In this part . . .
B
eing well insured gives you peace of mind. Many 
people think that they’re well insured, only to find 
out otherwise at claim time. The chapters in this part 
start the process of fixing that problem by introducing 
you to principles that will help you make good insurance 
decisions while at the same time helping to minimize your 
insurance bill. Then your coverage gaps will be plugged 
and the peace of mind you feel will be real.

Chapter 1
Building a Great 
Insurance Program
In This Chapter
▶ Identifying the two keys to a great insurance program
▶ Seeing each type of insurance policy as a component in your overall plan
▶ Dealing effectively with all five major risk areas in your life
M
ost people buy insurance policies from all over the place. Car insur-
ance here. Home insurance there. Two or three different life insur-
ance policies bought at different times. Some group life insurance at work. 
Health insurance through an employer. They buy one type of insurance from 
their travel agency, another from their credit card company.
The first time I meet with a new client, this situation is fairly typical. A virtual 
hodgepodge of insurance, with several different agents, and no one oversee-
ing the big picture. They’re wasting money on overpriced coverages full of 
gaps and exclusions, and completely missing major coverages like long-term 
disability.
Does this sound familiar? If so, this book is for you!

10
Part I: Getting Started 
Protecting against rovers and assailing thieves
My favorite insurance clause, Perils Clause 
12 (see below), comes from the ocean marine 
cargo policy, crafted by members of the origi-
nal Lloyd’s coffee house in the 1600s, insuring 
cargo on its way to the new world — and it’s 
still in use today! Metaphorically, you’re on a 
sailboat navigating through life. On your jour-
ney, you’ll experience rough seas from time to 
time. Rovers and assailing thieves will appear. 
But if you’ve taken the time to build a solid 
insurance program one policy at a time, your 
boat will weather the storms.

11
 Chapter 1: Building a Great Insurance Program
Arming Yourself with the Basics
 
What makes a great insurance program? Two things:
 
✓ Balance: A solid insurance program covers all five major risk areas:
 
• Major damage to or destruction of your residence
 
• Major lawsuits
 
• Premature death
 
• Long-term disability
 
• Major medical bills
 
✓ Customized coverage: every policy covering these five major risk areas 
has been custom-designed with high limits and the proper endorse-
ments to cover the unique risks in your life that otherwise would not be 
covered by off-the-shelf policies.
Throughout this book, I refer to seven guiding principles that can help you 
make good choices on what to insure and what not to insure. For example, 
one of the principles is, “Don’t risk more than you can afford to lose.” If 
you can’t afford to lose your income, you need to buy long-term disability 
insurance, in case you’re ever disabled. Chapter 2 gives you all the guiding 
principles.
Believe it or not, insurance isn’t always the answer. In Chapter 3, I introduce 
four non-insurance strategies for managing the risks in your life. Implementing 
these strategies (for example, pay extra for added airbags and antilock brakes 
to reduce your risk of injury) can help lower your insurance bill.
What’s the best way to buy insurance: Here’s a hint: It’s not by calling around 
for quotes, making sure the coverage is “apples to apples” and then buying 
insurance from whoever has the lowest bid. The best way to buy insurance 
is to select a highly skilled agent who can help you build the best possible 
insurance program. In Chapter 4, I tell you how to find the best agent for you.
Insuring the Things You Drive
Several of the major risks you face in your life are associated with driving 
your own vehicles — whether it’s your car, a rental car, a boat, an RV, or 
some other type of vehicle.

12
Part I: Getting Started 
In Chapter 5, I walk you through each of the coverages of a personal auto 
policy. I help you figure out how much liability insurance is enough, tell you 
how to save money by eliminating overlapping medical coverage or opting 
for higher deductibles, give you advice on when to drop collision and com-
prehensive coverage from your older car, and more.
In Chapter 6, I tell you about specific risks that you take on when renting a 
vehicle and how you can protect yourself from each of them without spend-
ing the enormous amount of money that rental agencies charge. I also explain 
the coverage pitfalls of the free company car your employer provides you 
for work and how to sidestep them. I also give you tips on covering special 
vehicles, such as motorcycles and antique and collectible cars.
Chapter 7 deals with the risk of boats, RVs, snowmobiles, golf carts, and 
more — including both liability and physical damage issues whether you 
own, borrow, or rent them. I show you the most economical way to buy the 
coverage that you need. In Chapter 7, I also address all different types of 
trailer risks — for example, the liability risk when you tow an owned or non-
owned trailer behind your vehicle, when you park your trailer at home or, 
if you have a camping trailer, when you park it for the summer on a rented 
trailer lot.
In Chapter 8, I show you how to get paid what you deserve at claim time for 
all different types of automobile claims — when the accident is your fault, 
when it’s the other guy’s fault, when your vehicle is stolen. I give you tips for 
collecting more than blue-book value for your better-than-average car. I also 
show you how the appraisal clause works when you and the insurance com-
pany can’t agree on a price.
Finding Your Way Home with 
Homeowner’s Insurance
Your home is likely the biggest asset you’ll ever own. Insuring your home 
adequately is essential. Every homeowner’s policy is divided into six parts, 
each with its own coverage limits (see Chapter 9). I introduce you to six dif-
ferent homeowner’s forms as well — four forms designed for homeowners, 
one form for renters, and one form for condominium or town house owners. 
I show you how to choose the proper coverages for your building, contents 
and personal liability.
But homeowner’s insurance isn’t just about insuring the house itself — it’s 
also about insuring your property inside the house. Many different exclu-
sions and limitations apply to personal property. For example, jewelry has 
a dollar limit for theft, as well as the exclusion for loss of the stone from the 

13
 Chapter 1: Building a Great Insurance Program
setting. Jewelry is also very difficult to value after the loss. Scheduling jew-
elry specifically by having it appraised and added to the policy is the insur-
ance industry recommendation for this type of risk — but it’s not the best 
solution for an antique piece with huge sentimental value, which you have 
no intention of replacing. If cash won’t make you whole, I don’t recommend 
scheduling these kinds of jewelry. In this case, you’re far better off putting 
your special item in a safe deposit box and preventing the loss from happen-
ing in the first place. In Chapter 10, I give you the information you need to 
prevent this type of exclusion and others from hurting you.
Chapter 11 is all about many of the exclusions and limitations in a home-
owner’s policy and ways to work around them. For example, a homeowner’s 
policy contains an absolute business exclusion, which means that if you 
frequently work from home and occasionally have UPS deliver a business-
related package to your home, and if that delivery person slips on your icy 
driveway, is injured, and sues you, your homeowner’s policy will not defend 
you, nor will it pay any judgment against you. Why? Because the injury was 
business-related. But you don’t have to live with this gap: The solution to this 
particular problem is to add a $20-per-year endorsement to the policy that 
covers that type of claim.
Chapter 11 also covers flood insurance and whether you’re a candidate for 
it. Here’s a hint: You probably are — even if you don’t live anywhere near 
a body of water; but you’re probably not if your lower-level floor is below 
ground level on all four sides.
Condominium and town house owners have special insurance needs and 
have a homeowner’s policy form created just for those needs. If you buy the 
standard condominium unit owner policy off the shelf with no customization 
and no special endorsements, odds are, if you have any kind of claim, you’ll 
be sorely disappointed. In Chapter 12, I alert you to what the pitfalls are and 
give you my recommendations on how to circumvent each of them so you 
don’t get hurt. If you own a town house or condominium — or even a vaca-
tion timeshare — you’ll benefit greatly from Chapter 12.
If you have a home-based business, you need to deal with many risks — both 
property and liability risks. In Chapter 13, I fill you in on these risks and tell 
you how to get the insurance you need as a business owner. (Hint: It’s gener-
ally not to buy an endorsement to your homeowner’s policy. Even the best of 
these business endorsements are too restrictive, particularly when it comes 
to liability off premises.)
I wrap up the part on homeowner’s insurance with tips on collecting what 
you deserve for homeowner’s claims. I give you the steps to take to get a 
great structural claim settlement. And if you have a personal property loss, 
you’ll benefit from my tips for getting paid top dollar for your claim.

14
Part I: Getting Started 
Preparing for a Rainy Day 
with an Umbrella Policy
One of the most important personal policies you can own is the personal 
umbrella policy, which has three basic advantages:
 
✓ A million dollars or more of catastrophic liability protection
 
✓ Extra defense coverage in case you’re sued
 
✓ Coverage for some of the exposures not covered by auto and home-
owner’s insurance policies
Chapter 15 covers the basics of umbrella policies, and in Chapter 16, I detail 
the many different gaps that an umbrella policy can cover and show you how 
to choose a policy that covers the gaps in your life not otherwise covered by 
your auto or homeowner’s policy.
In Chapter 17, we switch gears a bit. Here I cover many of the changes you 
face in your adult life (everything from getting married to having a baby 
to building a house to hiring a nanny and more), tell you what some of the 
added exposures are during those changes, and explain the changes you 
should make to your program so these new exposures are covered properly.
Life, Health, and Disability: Protecting 
Yourself and Those You Love
Health insurance consists of several important ingredients, and in Chapter 
18 I tell you what those are and how to get them right. If individual health 
insurance is what you’re after (because you don’t have insurance through a 
job, for example), you’ll appreciate the money-saving tips in Chapter 18, too. 
I show you how you can pay for medical costs with pretax dollars and intro-
duce health savings accounts and how they work. Plus, I offer tips on dealing 
with various types of health insurance problems (from finding health insur-
ance when you can’t qualify medically on your own to deciding whether to 
continue to cover your college-age kid on your policy or take her off and rely 
on just the coverage available from the college).

15
 Chapter 1: Building a Great Insurance Program
Just because you have health insurance through your job doesn’t mean you’re 
off the hook. In Chapter 19, on group health insurance, I show you how to 
make a good decision when your employer offers you two or more different 
plans. I also help you evaluate whether to cover your dependents on the 
group policy or get them individual policies. And I explain your rights when 
you’re leaving a job. Finally, I explain how a new program guarantees you the 
right to get individual or group coverage without facing any limitations on any 
pre-existing medical conditions you or your family members might have.
Chapter 20 is a brand-new chapter to this edition of Insurance For Dummies — 
it’s on Medicare and Medicare supplements. Volumes of books have been 
written about this subject, but if you’re like most people, you’re overwhelmed. 
So, I start out the chapter by outlining the steps that I recommend my own 
clients take when they qualify for Medicare. In other words, I cut to the chase. 
And yes, the chapter does include information and tips to help you make good 
choices around the complicated and confusing Medicare Part D prescription 
drug coverage.
Chapter 21, also new to this edition of the book, covers the basics of long-
term care insurance and helps you evaluate your own need for coverage. I 
explain the new Medicaid partnership program and how it makes it easy for 
most people to determine how much coverage to buy.
Long-term disability is the subject of Chapter 22. I help you determine how 
much coverage to buy and evaluate possible sources of coverage. I also show 
you the shortcomings in group long-term disability programs and how to get 
supplemental insurance to protect yourself.
Last, but not least, is Chapter 23 on buying life insurance. In this chapter, I help 
you determine how much life insurance to buy; plus, I introduce you to the dif-
ferent types of life insurance and explain which ones make the most sense for 
your situation. I close the chapter introducing several different myths and mis-
conceptions about life insurance (for example, that life insurance is cheaper 
when you’re young — it’s not!) and provide accurate information.

Chapter 2
Introducing Seven Guiding 
Principles of Insurance
In This Chapter
▶ Making good insurance decisions
▶ Avoiding insurance gaps
▶ Discovering some non-insurance options
I
’m writing this book to help you take responsibility for your life. I’m writ-
ing for people who don’t want to be victims — people who want the tools 
and information to be empowered when they make decisions. If that sounds 
like you, you’re in the right place!
Throughout this book, I regularly refer to seven guiding principles, all of which 
I cover in greater detail in this chapter. Follow these seven principles when 
making decisions about your insurance program, and your decisions will be 
good ones.
Keep It Simple
Managing risk (the chance of a loss happening) and buying insurance is tough 
enough without making it any more complicated than it has to be. For every 
risk I show you, generally more than one strategy exists that effectively mini-
mizes that risk. Using the keep it simple principle, you take the simple path. 
Simple means easier and more likely to be implemented — simple is not less 
effective.

18
Part I: Getting Started 
Here’s an example of how this principle can be used: Following a major fire 
or burglary, one of the requirements in a homeowner’s policy is to create 
an inventory of what was lost or destroyed, including, if possible, any 
receipts and canceled checks. Does that sound like a nightmare to you? It is! 
Even harder than documenting what you had is remembering what you had! 
Imagine coming home from a hard day at the office and finding either charred 
remains of what was once your dream home or finding your front door 
broken and your home torn apart by a burglar. The emotional trauma is bad 
enough. But, in addition, you have to remember what’s missing, because you 
only get paid for what you can remember.
 
A policy is the legal contract between you and an insurance company in which 
the company agrees to pay covered claims when you have them in exchange 
for a monthly (or some other periodic) payment from you. Any given policy 
contains many coverages.
Conventional insurance wisdom has always held that the solution to this 
dilemma is to fill out a household inventory booklet prior to any loss, list-
ing descriptions and values for every piece of personal property you own 
in every room of the house. Talk about a fun way to spend an evening — or, 
more realistically, your two-week vacation.
A written inventory isn’t such a bad idea, but it violates the keep it simple 
principle because it’s complex, and it takes far too much time. As a result, it’s 
rarely accomplished.
 
A far simpler strategy for handling this documentation is a video or photo-
graphic inventory. This approach is easy, fast (you can film the whole house 
in an hour or two), and even fun — especially when you add a verbal descrip-
tion: “This vase here that looks like a garage sale reject is really an antique 
from the Ming Dynasty worth $2.5 million.”
I particularly like the video strategy because everything you own can be on 
one tape or DVD, it’s easily stored, and, best of all, you can easily add to it 
when you acquire new things. If you don’t own a video camera, you can easily 
rent or borrow one. An extra benefit of having filmed documentation at claim 
time is a reduced need for receipts: Most adjusters will waive that require-
ment if they can see the item in your home prior to the loss, in some kind of 
photographic format. All in all, the video strategy is superior in every way to 
the written inventory strategy. Of course, if the house burns down, so will all 
your records, so be sure to store the photos or DVD safely off-premises (for 
example, in a safe-deposit box at your bank).

 Chapter 2: Introducing Seven Guiding Principles of Insurance
Don’t Risk More than You 
Can Afford to Lose
I’m all for taking risks if it makes economic sense. Carrying large deductibles 
(the amount of a loss that you pay out of your own pocket before insurance 
kicks in) to lower insurance costs is a smart gamble if you save enough on 
your premiums (the price you pay for the insurance policy covering a defined 
time period — for example, six months or a year). Not buying collision insur-
ance on older cars that you could afford to replace is another smart gamble. 
But be sure to insure any risk that is a part of your life if the risk could cause 
you major financial loss — if it’s more than you can afford to lose.
For example, the financial hardship of your paycheck stopping as a result 
of a long-term illness or injury is substantial. About one-third of all workers, 
at some point in their career, have a long-term disability. Yet, many people 
who totally depend on their paycheck don’t have disability insurance. Big 
mistake — it’s a clear violation of the principle to only risk what you can 
afford to lose. Disability insurance is the most under-purchased major insur-
ance coverage in this country. (Coverage is a promise to pay a certain type of 
claim if it occurs; other examples include automobile liability coverage, theft 
coverage, and so on.) If the loss of your income would cause major financial 
problems in your household, and your employer doesn’t provide disability 
insurance for you, make sure you carry a good disability policy. (I explain 
what makes a good disability policy in Chapter 22.)
Don’t Risk a Lot for a Little
Spending a little now (for coverage) makes more sense than spending a lot of 
your own money later when something happens that you’re not covered for.
Most people who buy insurance can’t afford to buy unlimited quantities; you 
probably don’t have millions of dollars of liability coverage, for example. So 
you tend to buy a limit that feels comfortable and doesn’t blow your budget. 
But too many people are considerably under-insured, and, tragically, they’re 
seldom aware that better insurance would cost them very little.
 
Liability is your financial obligation to another person (or persons) for 
injuries or property damage you cause. Liability coverage is a promise in 
an insurance policy to defend you in court and pay what you owe another 
person (or persons) for injuries or property damage you cause, up to the 
liability limits you chose.

20
Part I: Getting Started 
Using car insurance as an example, the most commonly purchased liability 
insurance limit in the United States today is $100,000 per person for injuries 
you cause to others. Is that enough to pay for a seriously injured person’s 
medical bills and lost wages, as well as compensation for that person’s pain 
and suffering? Just the medical bills alone could easily use up the entire cov-
erage limit, leaving you to personally pay all other costs, plus some of your 
own defense costs. Your personal, uninsured financial loss could easily reach 
several hundred thousand dollars. Table 2-1 shows some typical annual costs 
for additional liability coverage for two cars in a metropolitan area.
Table 2-1

beyond the Cost for $100,000

Coverage beyond $100,000

$500,000
$80
$400,000
$1.5 million
$150
$1.4 million
$2.5 million
$225
$2.4 million
Following the rule to not risk a lot for a little means that you shouldn’t buy 
only $100,000 of coverage when each additional $100,000 of coverage costs so 
little. In fact, you can usually pay for the extra cost simply by boosting your 
policy deductibles to the next level. Increasing your deductible by $250 to 
$500 often saves you enough on your insurance bill to pay for most or all of 
the added cost of additional liability coverage.
Consider the Odds
This rule says that when the odds of a claim happening are virtually zero, and 
the insurance costs are inappropriately high, you shouldn’t buy the insur-
ance. Considering the odds also means buying insurance when the possibility 
exists that a serious claim could occur.
Homeowner’s policies exclude earthquake losses. But they do offer an option 
to buy the coverage for an additional charge. Here are two examples of how 
the principle of considering the odds applies: It’s estimated that only about 
20 percent of California homeowners had earthquake coverage to protect 
themselves against the devastating California earthquake of 1989, despite the 
high odds of an earthquake occurring. The 80 percent who were uninsured 

21
 Chapter 2: Introducing Seven Guiding Principles of Insurance
were in clear violation of both this rule (to consider the odds) and the rule 
not to risk more than you can afford to lose. As a result, many homeowners 
suffered ruinous, uninsured earthquake losses that easily could have been 
avoided with the purchase of insurance.
But, if you live in an area that has no prior history of earthquakes and is 
located nowhere near any known fault lines, the probability of an earthquake 
may be near zero. In this instance, considering the odds means maybe not 
buying earthquake insurance if it costs more than a few dollars a year.
Like earthquake damage, flood and surface-water losses are excluded under 
the traditional homeowner’s policy. Considering the odds means that if your 
home is located high on the pinnacle of a hill overlooking a valley and your 
basement is unfinished, you probably don’t need to spend your money on 
flood insurance. On the other hand, if your home is located in a low-lying 
flood plain or near a river, you probably should consider buying flood insur-
ance, because the odds of a large loss are good. (Flood insurance is available 
from the federal government — more on that in Chapter 11.)
Risk a Little for a Lot
This principle encourages you to avoid insurance when the risk is small in 
relation to the amount of the premium. Say, for example, you own a 1996 
Honda worth $1,000. You were just hit with a DUI, and you’re facing premi-
ums of two to three times what you had been paying — not just this year, 
but for each of the next three to five years. Your collision insurance premium 
with a $500 deductible has just increased from $100 to $300 a year. If you 
keep this coverage, the maximum risk to the insurance company is the value 
of the car ($1,000) minus your deductible ($500) minus the salvage value of 
the car ($50), which totals $450. This rule advises you not to buy what turns 
out to be $450 of insurance for a $300 annual premium. Under these circum-
stances, the smart move is to drop the collision coverage.
Avoid Las Vegas Insurance
 
Avoid any insurance that transfers only part of the risk to the insurance com-
pany, leaving you unprotected for the rest. Accidental-death insurance pur-
chased from an airport vending machine is a good example. It often only pays 
if you die in a plane crash in the next few days! What you really may need is 
more life insurance, protecting you all the time and from any cause.

22
Part I: Getting Started 
With Las Vegas insurance, you are, in effect, betting that if the claim occurs, 
it will be the result of a limited cause of loss you bet on. Not smart. Table 2-2 
shows some examples of Las Vegas insurance and a better alternative that 
gets rid of the gamble.

liability limits
Yes, the last item in Table 2-2 is tongue in cheek — no insurance company 
has come out with rush-hour insurance yet — but I hope it makes the point. 
The bottom line? If you buy any insurance that transfers only part of the 
risk — as these examples of Las Vegas coverage do — you leave yourself 
vulnerable. Spend a little more money, and get much better insurance.
Buy Insurance Only as a Last Resort
This principle advises you to buy insurance only when it’s the best and most 
cost-effective solution. You have many options in treating any given risk; 
insurance is only one. Treat your risks with non-insurance strategies first. 
(See Chapter 3 for all kinds of information on how to do that.)

23
 Chapter 2: Introducing Seven Guiding Principles of Insurance
Here’s one example of how this principle works: Say you’ve inherited 
Grandma’s heirloom sterling silver. It’s precious to you, so, naturally, you 
want the best coverage possible. Your agent has you get an appraisal that 
costs you $100. You buy a special rider to your homeowner’s policy cover-
ing the silver’s appraised value of $10,000 at a premium of $90 a year. One 
year later, burglars break into your home and steal your precious heirloom. 
In the meantime, the silver has increased in value to $15,000. You collect 
the $10,000 insurance proceeds from the policy, but you’ve suffered three 
disappointments:
 
✓ The $5,000 difference between the value of the stolen silver and the 
amount that insurance covered.
 
✓ Grandma’s pattern has been discontinued and it’s difficult to find an 
identical match.
 
✓ Even if you find the same pattern, it doesn’t have the sentimental value 
that Grandma’s exact set had.
Insurance is not the best solution for managing this risk — not only because 
cash is a poor substitute for treasures, but also because of the hassle and 
cost of the appraisal, as well as the insurance premium that’s due every year.
A better, non-insurance, method for handling Grandma’s silver risk (and at 
the same time following the keep it simple strategy) is to store the silver in 
an off-premises safe-deposit box, thus preventing the loss almost entirely. Or, 
if that isn’t practical because you want to use the silver for special occasions, 
hide it well, reducing by about 90 percent the chance of a loss through theft. 
You can further reduce the risk by adding a central burglar alarm.
 
When it comes to irreplaceable treasures, preventing the loss altogether is a 
far better strategy than insurance, without the costs or the pitfalls of insur-
ance coverage.

Chapter 3
Managing Your Risk without 
Buying Insurance
In This Chapter
▶ Using non-insurance strategies to manage the risks in your life
▶ Watching out for contracts that give you all the liability
▶ Applying insurance and non-insurance strategies to everyday problems
M
y goal with this book is to provide you with the tools you need to 
effectively manage the personal risks in your life. Insurance is an 
effective way of managing risk, but it’s not the only way. You can identify 
risks and treat them with creative, non-insurance strategies — and you 
should do so whenever possible, instead of limiting yourself to buying insur-
ance. Non-insurance strategies reduce your insurance costs and are often 
more effective than their insurance counterparts.
Many people throw insurance at every problem. Their kid turns 16, and they 
rush out to buy insurance. They inherit a stamp collection worth $50,000, and 
they buy more insurance. They rent a car on vacation and buy insurance for 
that car.
In this chapter, I fill you in on a different and better way of doing things: risk 
management. The essence of risk management is to treat risks with non-
insurance methods first and to buy insurance second. I start this chapter by 
giving you four non-insurance strategies for reducing risk. Then I put those 
strategies into action with a real-life case study.

26
Part I: Getting Started 
Practicing the ARRT 
of Risk Management
When it comes to risk management, there are four non-insurance strategies 
you can put to work in your life. To make it easier for you to remember them, 
just think of the acronym ARRT:
A = Avoid
R = Reduce
R = Retain
T = Transfer
In the following sections, I get into greater detail on each of these.
Avoiding risk
Avoiding risk means exactly what it says: When none of the other strategies 
for treating a risk seems suitable, sometimes the wisest decision is to simply 
avoid the risk. I avoid risks like skydiving, hang gliding, and auto racing. I’m 
sure I would enjoy those activities if I ever took them up. It’s just that, for me, 
the rewards aren’t worth the risks.
Here are some other examples where avoiding the risk may be the best 
strategy:
 
✓ Not licensing a teenage driver who is clearly still immature and 
irresponsible
 
✓ Not buying an expensive sports car while your driving record is poor 
and insurance costs are sky high
 
✓ Canceling your vacation plans to a war-ravaged part of the world
 
✓ Not buying a backyard trampoline for your kids because you can’t pre-
vent unsupervised use by other neighborhood children
Reducing risk
Reducing risk means taking actions that lower the probability of the loss 
happening at all or, if it does occur, lowering the loss’s possible severity. If 
you’ve inherited Grandma’s sterling silver, you can reduce the theft risk by 

27
 Chapter 3: Managing Your Risk without Buying Insurance
installing a central home alarm and/or by hiding the silver well. If you have a 
valuable baseball-card collection, you can greatly reduce the water damage 
risk by mounting and sealing the cards in waterproof plastic album pages (as 
my son, JP, did with my card collection for Father’s Day one year).
Here are some other examples of ways you can reduce your risks:
 
✓ Regularly checking prongs on a valuable diamond ring to reduce the risk 
of loss of the stone
 
✓ Eating healthy foods and working out regularly, not smoking, and getting 
plenty of rest
 
✓ Not drinking and driving
 
✓ Buying cars with safety features like air bags and antilock brakes and 
that test well in crash tests
 
Reducing risk has the advantage of being the one treatment strategy you can 
do the most with and have the most personal control over. It has other advan-
tages, too. If you significantly reduce a risk:
 
✓ The risk may be small enough that you feel safe avoiding insurance alto-
gether. For example, if you’ve stored your valuables in a safe-deposit 
box, you may not feel the need to insure them.
 
✓ You may feel comfortable carrying higher deductibles. For example, 
you may be able to save 50 percent on your health insurance costs by 
buying a $2,000 deductible, and know that a high deductible is a smart 
choice because your healthy lifestyle results in few claims.
 
✓ You may be able to get insurance at a better cost.
Throughout this book, I talk a lot about reducing risk — and I recommend it 
as at least a part of the solution to managing many of the risks in your life.
Retaining risk
Retaining risk refers to the strategy of paying losses out of your own pocket. 
Retaining risk can be voluntary (such as carrying higher deductibles in order 
to lower your premiums). Retaining may mean choosing to take the entire 
risk on less valuable items; for example, you may forgo insurance on a $300 
canoe. Retaining may mean not carrying insurance to cover low-frequency 
catastrophic losses that have almost no chance of happening where you 
live; for example, you probably won’t buy earthquake insurance if you live in 
Minnesota.

28
Part I: Getting Started 
 
Retaining risk can also be involuntary — bad news. In this category are the 
surprises you get at claim time, the risks you take every day without even 
knowing it, such as:
 
✓ Not having any coverage to protect against an injury lawsuit from the 
person who delivers a package to your home-based business and falls 
and is injured on your icy sidewalk
 
✓ Not being protected against the lawsuit from your co-worker who was 
injured while riding with you in your company car
 
✓ Receiving only $30,000 for your $50,000 kitchen fire because of deprecia-
tion deductions under your homeowner’s policy
 
✓ Being sued by a car-rental company for $10,000 in damages to a rental 
car — damages caused by a friend or co-worker — for which you naively 
agreed to be responsible when you scribbled your signature on the 
rental agreement
Much of the focus of this book is on uncovering these involuntary reten-
tions — the many pitfalls of personal policies. Throughout this book, I expose 
these hidden risks and show you steps you can take to protect yourself.
Transferring risk
Transferring risk refers to shifting the risk in whole or in part from yourself 
to another party. The most common form of transfer is the insurance mecha-
nism whereby, in exchange for a predetermined premium payment, an insur-
ance company will assume losses that you would’ve otherwise had to absorb 
yourself.
Here’s an example: You transfer the risk of fire damage to your home to an 
insurer for $800 a year. Your home is destroyed by fire. The insurance com-
pany pays the entire cost to rebuild, the cost to replace all your destroyed 
belongings, and even the additional costs you incur to live elsewhere while 
your new home is being rebuilt.
 
The other type of transfer (the bad kind) occurs in just about every contract 
you sign in your daily life. “But I never sign contracts,” you’re thinking. 
Really? I bet you do — we all do. In any given year, you likely sign contracts 
for an apartment lease, a boat rental, a vacation condo, a rental car, a credit 
card, a real estate purchase, or a home-repair proposal. These are just some 
examples of the contracts you sign in your daily life. I could give you many 
more. It’s almost impossible to be alive and not sign contracts in today’s 

29
 Chapter 3: Managing Your Risk without Buying Insurance
busy world. In just about every one of these contracts, someone is trying to 
transfer some kind of risk to you, often without your knowledge. If there’s a 
problem, you’re simply out of luck. Courts don’t accept failure to read what 
you’ve signed as an excuse.
Take a closer look at two types of everyday contracts in which you assume 
responsibility unknowingly, and the surprises that can be waiting for you.
 
✓ Renting a chainsaw from a hardware store: You assume absolute liabil-
ity for damage to the saw, even if it’s not your fault, as well as all liability 
for injuries to another person (for example, a friend using the saw), even 
if the injury was caused by a defect in the saw. You also release the 
store from responsibility for your injuries, even if they’re caused by a 
defect in the saw.
 
✓ Wedding reception catering: You assume all liability for injuries to 
guests, even when they’re caused by the negligence of the restaurant 
(for example, food poisoning). You agree to pay all defense costs of the 
restaurant in such injury lawsuits and to pay any judgment against the 
restaurant out of your own pocket.
Can you imagine how upset you’d be if some dear friends at your daughter’s 
wedding reception suffered serious illness or even death from contaminated 
food, and you were forced to pay to defend the restaurant? Plus, you had to 
pay all judgments against the restaurant, just because you innocently signed 
a contract to do so?
Does this scare you? I hope so. Fear is a good thing when it keeps you from 
hurting yourself. And if you don’t start paying attention to the routine con-
tracts of your daily life, you could easily assume a risk that can ruin you 
financially.
Putting ARRT into Action: A Case Study
The four risk treatment strategies of avoid, reduce, retain, and transfer work 
together. In fact, you’re more likely to combine the strategies instead of using 
them individually.
Here’s a case study that’s just one example of how you can put ARRT into 
action in your daily life: Let’s say your son is about to turn 16, and he wants 
to get his driver’s license.

30
Part I: Getting Started 
You can obviously avoid the risks associated with a 16-year-old driver by 
not allowing him to get a driver’s license. Other methods of avoiding this risk 
include chaining your teenager in the cellar or giving him up for adoption — 
but I’m guessing that, no matter how annoying his attitude can be at times, 
you’re not quite ready to get rid of him.
 
Avoiding is the strategy to take when none of the other strategies for treating 
a risk seems suitable. Odds are, when it comes to your teen, you’ll be able to 
manage the risk through a combination of the other three strategies and allow 
him to drive. (And no, he didn’t put me up to this.)
You can reduce the risks of injuries, property damage, and lawsuits by:
 
✓ Requiring your teenager to spend 30 or 40 hours of practice behind the 
wheel, alongside you, while facing all different driving scenarios and 
weather conditions
 
✓ Buying him a structurally solid and mechanically safe car, with working 
seat belts and air bags, to minimize injuries
 
✓ Asking your teen to sign a contract such as the Students Against 
Destructive Decisions (SADD) Contract for Life (available at www.sadd.
org/contract.htm), where he agrees not to drive after using drugs or 
alcohol, and you agree to pick him up anytime, anyplace, without giving 
him a hard time
You can retain some or all of the risk of damage to the car itself (collision, 
fire, theft) by either not buying damage insurance on the car at all or, if the 
car is worth too much, at least choosing large deductibles. This strategy will 
save you a bundle on your insurance costs.
You can transfer the ownership risk of personal lawsuits related to vehicle 
maintenance by transferring the vehicle title and maintenance responsibility 
to your teenager. This strategy won’t absolve you of responsibility for your 
teen’s behavior, but it can avoid lawsuits against you related to not maintain-
ing the vehicle in a reasonable manner. Your teen has considerably fewer 
assets and income than you do and is much less a target for lawsuits than 
you are, so he’ll need far less liability insurance coverage. (See my tips on 
insuring your teenage driver in Chapter 6.)
 
Be sure to check your state law to find the minimum age at which your teen 
can legally own a vehicle; you can find this information by contacting your 
state’s Department of Motor Vehicles.

 Chapter 3: Managing Your Risk without Buying Insurance
Managing super risks
In 1992, the Super Bowl was held in Minneapolis, 
which created an unexpected windfall for a few 
of my clients with nice homes. The hoopla of 
the Super Bowl attracts many more people than 
will ever attend the game itself, and there’s a 
severe shortage of hotel rooms and other 
types of housing. About a month before the 
game, I started getting calls from clients who 
were being offered incredible sums of money 
($10,000 for two weeks) to rent their homes to 
wealthy groups of international visitors wanting 
a nice environment for sleeping and entertain-
ing. Understandably, the offers were incred-
ibly tempting. But they were dangerous too, 
because the standard homeowner’s insurance 
policy is normally suspended during such a 
significant increase in exposure, which means 
my clients would have been totally uninsured 
for fires, injury lawsuits, and many other claims 
occurring during the rental.
The safest strategy was obviously to avoid the 
risk altogether and not rent out their homes. 
But for those who succumbed to the lure of 
the large cash offer, I suggested the following 
strategies:
 ✓ We reduced the risk by collecting siz-
able damage deposits and checking 
references.
 ✓ We transferred risks contractually to the 
renters through a short-term rental con-
tract making them absolutely liable for all 
damages to building and contents, as well 
as all injuries, regardless of fault. And we 
required them to provide proof, prior to 
occupancy, of both property and liability 
insurance, which named each of my clients 
as an additional insured for the duration of 
the rental.
 ✓ Just in case the contractual transfer didn’t 
hold up, we transferred property and liabil-
ity risks to insurance by successfully nego-
tiating with my clients’ home and umbrella 
liability insurers to waive any coverage sus-
pensions on grounds of the short duration 
of the rental. Note: The only time this nego-
tiation is possible is before the loss. All the 
insurers reluctantly agreed. To make cer-
tain that there would be no misunderstand-
ings with the insurance companies, we got 
written confirmation.
By paying close attention to all the risks and 
applying creative insurance and non-insurance 
strategies, the potential financial ruin was 
averted, and my clients were $10,000 richer. I 
wish I’d been working on a percentage!

Chapter 4
Buying Insurance
In This Chapter
▶ Looking at the dangers of buying insurance on price alone
▶ Identifying the two components of a great insurance program
▶ Finding a top insurance advisor at no extra cost
A
 great insurance program has two key components:
 
✓ Your program is in balance in all major risk areas.
 
✓ Each policy that you buy is well-designed with high limits for major 
loss coverages and with all the right endorsements that customize 
your policy to cover the risks in your life that would not otherwise be 
covered.
You’ll have a better chance of accomplishing both goals if you take time to 
locate a highly skilled insurance agent who’s an expert on every type of per-
sonal insurance that you need.
Yes, the cost of insurance is important. You want your costs to be competi-
tive and manageable. But the true cost of your insurance program is not only 
what you pay upfront in premiums but more importantly what you have to 
pay out-of-pocket at claim time. Most people who shop for insurance put all 
the emphasis on the front end costs — the premiums — and then may end up 
having to pay thousands or hundreds of thousands of dollars in uncovered 
claims later.
 
When it comes to insurance costs, it’s far better to pay a little too much in 
premiums than to pay for an uncovered major claim later.

34
Part I: Getting Started 
Understanding What Makes a 
Balanced Insurance Program
There are several major risks that you face regularly throughout your lifetime 
that, if they occur, can cause your financial ruin: major medical bills, major 
damage to or destruction of your residence, major lawsuits and the cost of 
defending them, long-term disability, premature death, and — especially for 
those over age 40 — the risk of extended long-term care.
Your insurance program is in balance if each of these major risk areas are 
equally well covered and you’re not spending too much on one area and too 
little on another.
Many people have major-loss coverage that’s out of balance. They may have 
a good medical plan with high limits, but no coverage for long-term disabili-
ties. They may have $1 million of life insurance on the breadwinner, but none 
on the homemaker. Their home may be fully insured, but they have only 
$100,000 of coverage for lawsuits and no umbrella liability policy.
 
A highly-skilled agent can help you identify imbalances in your insurance pro-
gram and suggest the corrective action needed, which is why taking the time 
to find the right agent is so important. Most people who buy insurance don’t 
take the time to find the right agent for them. They let whoever answered the 
phone and gave them the quote be their agent, without any knowledge of that 
person’s skill level. And, in the end, they get a less-skilled agent than they 
could have had for the same price.
For more information on finding the right insurance agent, turn to “Choosing 
Your Professional Advisor,” later in this chapter.
Customizing Each Policy to 
Meet Your Unique Needs
The ideal insurance policy is a single page that simply says, “If you have 
a loss — no matter what the cause and no matter how high the cost — we 
will cover it in full.” No exclusions. No 20-page policies. Wouldn’t that be 
wonderful?
Because that policy isn’t going to be available anytime soon, you want to get 
as close as possible to that ideal using a combination of several policies. In 
this book, I introduce you to the basics of each kind of personal policy and 

35
 Chapter 4: Buying Insurance
how to choose limits for each coverage. I show you what optional coverages 
everyone should buy and what optional endorsements are available to cover 
those risks unique to you that would not otherwise be covered under the 
basic policy.
 
One of the key guiding principles from Chapter 2 says, “Don’t risk more than 
you can afford to lose.” That means having all major risk areas in your life well 
covered. In order to accomplish that objective, you should work with a highly 
skilled professional agent.

Automobile, home, boat, umbrella, and other personal policies, as they’re 
sold off the shelf, rarely, if ever, cover all your major property and liability 
risks. But they will cover most, if not all, of those major risks if they’re cus-
tomized to your needs with proper coverage limits and appropriate coverage 
endorsements. Customizing a policy requires a great deal of coverage exper-
tise and care. And that’s why, for most people, locating and hiring the best 
possible advisor has to be the very highest priority when it comes to buying 
insurance.
Bargain-basement brain surgery
Suppose you’ve been told you need brain sur-
gery. If you shop for it the way many people 
shop for insurance, here’s what you do: You 
start by calling around town, getting quotes 
over the phone. You probably aren’t exactly 
sure what kind of brain surgery you need, so 
you decide to get a price for the type that you 
think you probably need. You get quotes from 
all over — from surgeons, clinics, hospitals, 
and even medical-school interns. You’re not 
concerned about skill — just price. After all, it’s 
only brain surgery.
You find a clinic that will do the surgery you 
think you need for the lowest price. You sign up 
for the brain surgery. The intern who answered 
the phone when you called does the surgery, 
even though one of the top brain surgeons in 
the area works for the clinic and would do the 
surgery for the same price as the intern. The 
intern, lacking the expertise to diagnose the 
exact type of surgery you need, performs the 
surgery you asked for in the quote. The top 
brain surgeon would have known enough to 
recognize that what you requested was the 
wrong procedure for you and would put you at 
risk for serious brain damage. She would have 
recommended a different, more expensive, but 
much more helpful surgery instead.
Insurance isn’t brain surgery. But it isn’t a com-
modity either. The moral of the story is that if 
you shop for insurance like this, you’ll probably 
end up with the wrong diagnosis, with possible 
serious side effects, and with a less skilled 
advisor than you need and could have had for 
the same price.

Part I: Getting Started 
Understanding how agents get paid
In almost all states, agents selling personal insurance get paid the same 
commission as every other agent representing that particular insurance 
company — usually about 10 percent to 15 percent — regardless of the 
agent’s experience, the agent’s skill level, or the quality of the insurance 
plan that the agent designs. This payment structure is both good news and 
bad news for you.
The good news: Getting an expert for the price of a novice
Although the flat commission compensation system is anti-consumer 
(rewarding quantity of sales rather than quality), you can really benefit from 
the system in one way: You can buy the very best talent for not a penny more 
than you would pay for the worst possible agent! Can you see how ridiculous 
it is to select your agent based on the warm body who gives you the quote? 
The vast majority of the time, the person you talk with the first time you call 
a company will not be one of that insurance company’s most skilled agents.
 
Almost all insurance buyers see an insurance premium as buying them one 
thing — an insurance policy. In reality, the premium pays for much more than 
that. The policy, the coverage, and the insurance company make up about 85 
percent of the premium. Professional advice, policy service, and help from a 
professional agent when there is a problem make up the other 15 percent. 
Spend that 15 percent wisely! Get the best agent that you can find.
 
The more complex your lifestyle and the more of a lawsuit target you are, the 
more important it is to take the time to find an agent with the most expertise 
that you can.
The bad news: Finding a needle in a haystack
The “everybody gets paid the same” rule for agent compensation has one 
big drawback: The marketplace pushes agents with greater skills away from 
smaller, personal insurance policies and their small commissions into business 
insurance, where the premiums and commissions more appropriately com-
pensate the best agents’ greater expertise. The current compensation arrange-
ment makes finding agents with great personal insurance skills a difficult task.
Knowing what you want in an advisor
Okay, so you’re sold on the idea of finding the best advisor that you can for 
the commission dollars that you’re spending. Where do you look for candi-
dates? And when you find two or more candidates, how can you select the 
one that’s best for you?

37
 Chapter 4: Buying Insurance
I suggest you build a checklist of what you want in your agent. Ask yourself 
the following questions:
 
✓ Do I want my life, health, disability, long-term-care, and other cover-
ages with the same agent? You’ll have the best-designed program if you 
can find one agent with the expertise to oversee your whole program — 
expertise in every kind of personal policy. At the very least, it’s wise not 
to have more than two agents that you work with.
 
✓ Is a regular, yearly review important to me? If so, add this to your 
shopping list. I recommend regular reviews. A well-designed insurance 
plan starts to rust with coverage gaps if it’s not polished up every year 
or two.
 
✓ Do I have a home business? If so, you must find someone with small-
business insurance expertise. Add that to your list.
 
✓ Are top claim skills important to me? Do you want the best possible 
claims coaching, to maximize your claim when you file it? Do you want 
an agent skilled enough to fight, successfully, for your rights if your 
claim is unjustly denied or underpaid?
Then use the answers to these questions to screen potential candidates.
Searching for candidates
You’re looking for an agent to probe your needs, identify coverage gaps, 
solve problems, help you resolve claim disputes, do annual reviews, and, in 
short, provide greater expertise. Here are some possible sources for candi-
dates. Try to get at least two to three prospects.
Word of mouth
Word of mouth is always one of the best sources when seeking a professional 
of any kind. But be careful not to fall into the price trap. Because so many 
people buy their insurance solely on price, when you ask for a referral for a 
good agent, you might get: “Call Bob. He’s a good guy. He saved me $200 a 
year. And he always remembers my birthday.” So you call Bob, get his quote, 
save your $200 or more, and end up with a good price for the wrong coverage 
(and an annual birthday card). And you’ve done nothing about your uninsured 
coverage gaps.
 
To avoid the price trap, be specific when asking for a referral. You don’t nec-
essarily want the best salesman or the one you’d most like to go to a ballgame 
with. You want the person who will give you the best professional advice.

38
Part I: Getting Started 
Professional societies
An insurance agent can earn a number of advanced insurance designations 
by completing a series of courses and passing the exams. Here are just a few:
 
✓ Chartered Property Casualty Underwriter (CPCU)
 
✓ Certified Insurance Counselor (CIC)
 
✓ Certified Life Underwriter (CLU)
 
✓ Accredited Advisor in Insurance (AAI)
Many others designations exist as well. Anyone earning any insurance desig-
nation has to spend 100 hours to 1,000 hours (for the CPCU) in the classroom 
and studying on her own, as well as pass national exams. These are people 
who have gained additional expertise in certain areas and who have a com-
mitment to professionalism and ethical behavior. Don’t choose an agent 
based solely on her professional designations, but weigh these designations 
(or the lack thereof) heavily in your decision.
Managing risk with a personal risk manager
When it comes right down to it, buying a bunch 
of insurance policies, even from very knowl-
edgeable agents who customize all the cov-
erages to your particular needs, still leaves 
you wanting. For example, you may need help 
sorting through your group health insurance 
options at work to pick the plan that offers your 
family the best all-around coverage for the least 
cost. If you’re married and both you and your 
spouse have group options from your respec-
tive employers, you may need help determining 
which plan is best to insure your children. What 
about your group options for additional life 
insurance? Should you apply for that if you have 
diabetes or other health issues? How much do 
you need? If you’re 65 and still working, should 
you apply for full Medicare now or stay on your 
employer’s group plan? The list of questions is 
endless. . . .
Personal risk managers are insurance agents 
who are highly skilled in every type of personal 
insurance policy. They help consumers identify 
and manage the risks in their lives — not just 
those covered by policies the agents handle — 
in exchange for a value-added, annual, risk-
management fee in addition to any commission 
earned by the agents.
There is no society of personal risk managers — 
at least not yet. You find one by first finding an 
agent highly skilled in every type of personal 
policy and then offering them the job. Offer to 
pay them an annual fee in exchange for helping 
you manage all the risks in your life — not just 
those covered by those policies that the agent 
handles for you. I know it’s possible because 
I’ve been practicing that way for my clients for 
over 20 years.

39
 Chapter 4: Buying Insurance
 
If you want some good leads to an agent prospect with expertise in personal 
property and liability policies — auto, home, umbrella, and so on — contact
 
✓ CPCU Society (phone: 800-932-2728, ext. 4; e-mail: membercenter@
cpcusociety.org; Web: www.cpcusociety.org): From the home 
page, click on Agent & Broker Locator to find an agent in your area.
 
✓ The Society of Certified Insurance Counselors (phone: 800-633-2165; 
e-mail: alliance@scic.com; Web: www.scic.com): Call and request a 
list of CIC agents who share your zip code.
Whatever names you get from these two societies will be good prospects 
for your agent search. (CPCU agents are more scarce, so you may need to 
request a state listing rather than asking for agents in your zip code.)
Insurance companies
If you already know you want to be insured with a particular company, go 
directly to that company for agent referrals. You can also go to the insurance 
company for agent leads if you’ve shopped ahead for a certain type of insur-
ance and found one or two insurers that are the lowest priced. (Remember: 
All you know at this point is that they’re the lowest priced for the coverage 
you shopped but not necessarily the coverage you need!)
 
What you need to find out from the insurer is who the company’s best, most 
knowledgeable agents are. The insurance company knows who these agents 
are, but the company is unlikely, for legal and other reasons, to give you their 
names. So here’s what I recommend: Call the local company office and ask 
them to fax or e-mail you a list of all their agents in your state who have a 
CPCU or CIC designation. They may not have a list at their fingertips, but they 
can get it for you. Whichever method you use, it should yield a small supply of 
quality prospects.
Making the choice
At this point, you’ve narrowed down your choice to one or two candidates for 
your “job opening” for an agent/advisor. You’re probably thinking, “How do I, 
with limited knowledge, make this choice? I don’t even know what to ask.”
Start by requesting a face-to-face meeting for the purpose of doing an insur-
ance review for every policy that you have including your group coverage at 
work. You’ll be able to tell by your gut feel whether this is the person for you.
If you’ve narrowed your field to two candidates, I recommend that you have 
both of them do the insurance review for you. The agent with the greater 
expertise and greater care for your well-being will stand out.

Part I: Getting Started 
 
The job of protecting you from financial ruin caused by property or liability 
claims is an important one. Approach it as seriously as you’d approach choos-
ing a doctor, lawyer, or accountant.
The insurance audit
Suppose you’re pretty content with your agent 
and even your insurance company. But you’ve 
got a lot to lose and you’d like a second opinion. 
You’re a little nervous about whether all your 
bases are covered, especially considering that 
you have an older home, a lot of artwork and 
antiques, a vacation condo in the mountains, 
and a small business you run from home. The 
question is: How can you get a second opinion 
from an expert? How much will it cost? And 
what results can you ask for?
If your state allows agents to charge fees for 
added services, approach an agent with good 
expertise and request an audit of your entire 
insurance program. Agree on an hourly rate or 
flat fee for the service. Here’s the format I use 
that works well: First, I meet with the clients 
for about 11/2 to 2 hours and probe to identify 
the property and liability risks in their lives. If 
they want, I also include life and health risks. 
I particularly focus on the risks not covered by 
standard insurance policies. I make sure that 
their program is balanced, that all the major 
risk areas — large lawsuits, major damage to 
residence, major medical bills, death and long-
term disability — are well covered, that no 
one major risk area has excessive coverage at 
the expense of another major risk area being 
grossly under-insured.
Next, I try to measure the size of the risks I’ve 
identified. I briefly review the prospective cli-
ents’ income and assets to assess how likely 
they are to be sued, and I help them determine 
an appropriate liability insurance limit. I gather 
information on their home to double- and triple-
check the adequacy of their home structural 
coverage. I help them determine how much life 
insurance to carry. I make sure that they have 
solid long-term disability coverage.
I review their contracts and leases, such as 
condominium association agreements or home 
business contracts to see what risks they have 
assumed in those agreements.
Then, I gather and review all their personal 
insurance policies, including group insurance — 
life, health, disability — with the purpose of 
discovering where the holes are, or where the 
program is out of balance.
Finally, I prepare a written report listing the 
problem areas and my recommended solution 
for each. The reports are usually two to three 
pages long and identify 8 to 20 problems.
The clients pay me for the report and can then 
use the information to buy insurance from any 
company or any agent. Or they can simply use 
the information to have their current agents 
make whatever policy changes are needed to 
plug their coverage gaps.
I’ve done scores of insurance audits. I’ve never 
had a client not benefit immensely. Any advisor 
you select can do the same for you for a fair 
price, if your state permits it.

41
 Chapter 4: Buying Insurance
 
Don’t get quotes at this stage yet. If you’re comfortable and she has the exper-
tise you’re looking for, ask her to design a program for you with all the right 
coverages. Then have her quote what she recommends and meet with her a 
second time to review the quotes and get her help making choices. Once all 
those changes are implemented, you should have satisfied both the compo-
nents of a great insurance program! How about that!
When you’ve completed the reviews, ask about the agent’s background, his 
educational and practical experience, and the kind of ongoing help you can 
expect — both in terms of regular fine-tuning of your program and in terms of 
the kind of assistance you’ll get in a serious claim or dispute. I wouldn’t con-
sider any candidate who doesn’t offer you the big three:
 
✓ The expertise to help you design a great protection plan with the least 
possible gaps
 
✓ Ongoing reviews and regular contact about new developments so your 
plan stays current
 
✓ Outstanding assistance at claim time, both coaching you and being a 
strong advocate for your rights in a dispute
Choosing an Insurance Company
A good agent can advise you on both the financial strength and the quality of 
claim service of any insurance company that you’re considering. If, however, 
you’re buying direct without advice or you just want more information on a 
particular company, go to www.ambest.com.
A. M. Best analyzes and rates insurance companies based on their overall 
quality and financial strength. It gives insurers grades, much like school — 
A++, A+, A, A–, B+, B, and so on. (For more details on each of the grades, go to 
www.ambest.com, click Ratings & Analysis, and select Ratings Definitions.) 
The higher the rating, generally, the safer you are from the risk of the insur-
ance company closing its doors and not being able to pay your claim.
 
Don’t buy insurance from any insurance company with an A. M. Best policy-
holder rating of less than A unless you have no other choice.
The larger your exposures and the greater your coverage limits, the stronger 
the insurance company rating you should seek. For example, if your income 
and/or assets make you a target for lawsuits, you’ll probably buy an umbrella 
policy (see Chapter 15). The A. M. Best rating for that umbrella policy should, 
ideally, be an A+ or A++. Picking an insurance company can be a gamble. 
Fortunately, organizations like A. M. Best help improve your odds.

drive, therefore I am. For most people, a vehicle is as 
indispensable as oxygen. When you drive, you careen 
about at amazing speeds in a multi-ton container of metal, 
glass, and explosive liquid. You expose yourself (and oth-
ers) to incredible liability simply by driving. Insurance on 
your vehicle is as indispensable as the vehicle itself. 
Without insurance, you could lose everything.
In this part, I show you how to protect yourself and others 
from all the different driving risks you face each day, 
whether you’re driving a car, a boat, an RV, a snowmobile, 
or something else. I also give you some sound advice on

A
mericans have a love affair with their cars, and because Americans 
own more cars per capita than any country in the world, a good place 
to begin examining insurance risks is to look at those associated with the 
ownership, maintenance, and use of our beloved cars. Unless you walk 
around with a loaded gun, an automobile is the most dangerous device you 
own. In one split second, driving a car can result in lawsuits, death, long-term 
disability, major medical expenses, and major property damage.
That’s why it’s so important to spend time setting up a solid car insurance 
program that will keep you from suffering heavy financial losses following 
a serious car accident. In this chapter, I show you how to create a solid car 
insurance program.
Protecting Against Lawsuits
Your personal automobile is the single largest possible source of cata-
strophic lawsuits and legal judgments against you for major injuries, death, 
and property damage. In this section, I fill you in on some specific strategies 
you can follow to protect yourself against this risk — first, by reducing your 
risk in the first place, and second, by buying liability coverage.

46
Part II: Cars, Boats, RVs, and More: Insuring the Things You Drive 
Reducing your lawsuit risks
You can reduce your risk of being sued by taking some non-insurance steps — 
steps that not only lower your risk but often lower your insurance costs as well:
 
✓ Obey traffic laws, including the speed limit. People who speed have 
many more accidents. A California study indicated that, with one 
speeding ticket in the last two years, your probability of having an at-
fault accident increased 95 percent. With two tickets, your probability 
increased 170 percent. If you received three speeding tickets, you were 
254 percent more likely to have an accident. If you have four speeding 
tickets, you’re almost 300 percent more likely to have an accident. This 
should help you understand why insurance companies bump your rate 
up when you get speeding tickets.
 
✓ Don’t drink and drive. Always use a designated driver. Period.
 
✓ Perform regular safety maintenance on your vehicle. Have your 
brakes, tires, steering, and lights checked by a mechanic.
 
✓ When you’re shopping for a car, buy a vehicle that’s highly rated 
for low damageability and passenger safety. Check out the Insurance 
Institute for Highway Safety Web site (www.iihs.org/ratings) for 
crash test results on various makes and models.
 
✓ Opt for added safety features like air bags or antilock brakes. They 
cost more, but they’ll save you money on your insurance premium and 
reduce your risk of injury.
 
✓ Always wear your seat belt and insist that your passengers do, too.
 
✓ Buy child safety seats and always use them. Look for a seat rated by 
the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA). For tips on 
child safety seats, go to www.nhtsa.gov and click on the Child Safety 
Seats link.
 
✓ Take a behind-the-wheel defensive driving class. Even if you don’t get 
a premium credit, you’ll be a better driver and have less chance of being 
involved in a serious accident — either one that is not your fault or one 
that you cause. And fewer accidents means better rates (and maybe 
longer lives).
 
✓ Require your teenager to have at least 30 hours of practice behind 
the wheel on his permit under all sorts of driving conditions before 
allowing him to get a driver’s license. No one can ever develop the 
skills needed to be a safe driver in just a few hours of mandatory driv-
er’s education.
 
✓ Allow your teen to drive based upon your determination of her ability 
to responsibly operate a car — regardless of when your state says she 
can legally drive. A teen who behaves immaturely and irresponsibly out 
of a vehicle usually behaves immaturely and irresponsibly in a vehicle.

47
 Chapter 5: Managing Your Personal Automobile Risks
Buying liability coverage
Liability insurance provides for your defense and pays legal judgments on 
your behalf. People who buy liability insurance frequently make two mistakes:
 
✓ They buy far too little coverage. “How much is enough liability insur-
ance?” you may be asking. It depends on who the victim is. It also 
depends on how suable you are. I call this your suability factor (see the 
“Your suability factor” section, later in this chapter).
 
✓ They buy inconsistent limits. For example, they have a $100,000 limit 
on their car, $300,000 on their home, and $50,000 on their boat. Suppose 
these are your limits and you injure someone seriously with your car. 
You have only $100,000 of coverage, yet had the same injury occurred 
at home, you would have $300,000 of coverage. See how illogical that is? 
Your only hope for enough coverage in this scenario is to drag the vic-
tim’s bleeding, unconscious body home, throw him down the stairs, and 
hope he doesn’t remember the car accident!
I cover how to fix both of these common mistakes in the following sections.
Your suability factor
I define suability factor as the probability of an injured party suing you for 
large sums — often for more than the amount of liability insurance you’re 
carrying. In order for that to happen, you must be worth something, either 
currently or in the future. Why? Because if there’s nothing to go after — no 
pot of gold at the end of the rainbow — many attorneys won’t take the case 
and help an injured party sue you.
Your suability factor is influenced by several elements:
 
✓ Your current income: The more you make, the higher your suability 
factor.
 
✓ Your current assets: If you have expensive cars and homes, lots of 
investments and savings, and other assets, your suability factor is 
higher.
 
✓ Your future income: If you’re a medical intern, a law-school student, or 
an MBA student, your suability factor is higher, even if you’re currently 
living in a studio apartment and eating ramen noodles every night.
 
✓ Your future assets: If your parents are wealthy and you stand to inherit 
a good chunk of change, your suability factor is higher.
 
People with high current incomes or assets usually are aware of their suabil-
ity. But people with little current income or assets often overlook their future 
income or asset potential and the effect it has on their current suability.

48
Part II: Cars, Boats, RVs, and More: Insuring the Things You Drive 
 
If you have one or more of these four elements contributing to a high suability 
factor, you’re more apt to be sued for amounts greater than your insurance 
coverage, and you need higher liability limits on all your insurance policies. 
An added advantage of higher liability limits is that the closer your liability 
limit comes to the economic value of the injury you cause, the greater the like-
lihood that the injured party will settle for your insurance policy limit and not 
pursue you — personally — beyond that.
Why who you hit matters
You’re on your way to work. You’re running 
behind schedule. You decide to run a yellow 
light. But just before the intersection, the light 
turns red. You slam on your brakes, but it’s too 
late. You broadside another vehicle. The driver 
is taken to the emergency room, undergoes 
surgery, and spends a month in the hospital. 
Following his release, he spends two years in 
rehabilitation, in and out of physical therapy, 
missing two years of work. His medical bills 
come to $100,000, but your potential liabil-
ity depends a lot on what his occupation and 
income is. Here are a few examples. Note that 
awards for pain and suffering are also influ-
enced by a person’s income loss. The total 
award for each example includes the $100,000 
in medical expenses each incur.
 ✓ If he’s a teacher, his lost wages for 2 years 
might be $120,000, his pain and suffer-
ing might be $300,000, and his total claim 
(including the $100,000 of medical expenses) 
might be $520,000.
 ✓ If he’s a banker, his lost wages might be 
$240,000, his pain and suffering might 
be $400,000, and his total claim might be 
$740,000.
 ✓ If she’s a doctor, her lost wages might 
be $600,000, her pain and suffering might 
be $500,000, and her total claim might be 
$1,200,000.
 ✓ And if he’s a professional baseball player, 
his lost wages might be $12 million, his pain 
and suffering might be $10 million, and his 
total claim might be $22,100,000!
Pretty eye-opening, isn’t it? Can you imagine 
what the numbers would be if the driver were 
killed, or had a permanent disability with a life-
time loss of income? The most common liability 
limit I see when I review a prospective client’s 
insurance is $100,000! As these examples illus-
trate, that’s ridiculously low.
I’m not suggesting that you rush out and buy $22 
million or more in liability insurance in case you 
happen to hit a professional athlete. (You proba-
bly won’t even be able to find liability insurance 
with limits more than $5 million to 10 million.) I 
am suggesting that you reevaluate your cover-
age limit based on a combination of this new 
awareness, the cost and availability of higher 
insurance limits, and how suable you are. To 
help pay for the increased cost of higher liability 
coverage, shift premium dollars away from less 
important coverages, like higher deductibles on 
coverage for damage to your own vehicle.

49
 Chapter 5: Managing Your Personal Automobile Risks
For some people, another variable in choosing a liability limit is their sense 
of moral responsibility. For example, a person who is not very suable may 
buy a higher liability limit than she would otherwise need, to make sure that 
any fellow human being she injures is provided for financially. If you’re one of 
these people, my hat goes off to you in admiration.
The cost of higher liability limits
You may be wondering how much it costs to raise your liability coverage — 
well, it costs very little. Call your agent and find out for yourself — you’ll be 
amazed! (Don’t forget to raise all your liability limits on your other personal 
policies to the same limit as your car insurance.) Table 5-1 shows an example 
of fairly typical costs involved in raising liability coverage from $100,000 for 
two cars, a home, a cabin, and a boat. (The numbers may vary depending on 
the insurance company and the circumstances of the insured.)
Table 5-1 
The Cost of Raising Liability Limits from $100,000
New Liability Limit
Additional Annual Premium
$300,000
$100
$500,000
$150
$1.5 million
$300
$2.5 million
$390
Each additional $ million
$90
 
Coverage beyond $500,000 is sold in $1 million increments under a cata-
strophic excess policy commonly referred to as an umbrella policy. (See 
Chapter 15 for more on umbrella policies.)
When you look at what you’re spending for the first $100,000 of coverage, you 
see that you can tremendously increase your catastrophic lawsuit coverage 
(not to mention your peace of mind) for just a little more money. Additional 
liability coverage is the best value in the insurance business.
The danger of split liability limits
Most liability coverage for homes, boats, recreational vehicles, and other 
personal policies is sold by insurance companies as a single limit (such as 
$300,000) that applies to all injuries and property damage you cause in a 
single accident, no matter how many people are injured or how much prop-
erty is damaged. In other words, if you’re in an accident, you have one pool 
of money to pay for all your liability.

50
Part II: Cars, Boats, RVs, and More: Insuring the Things You Drive 
Liability coverage for car accidents is also available as a single limit, but just 
as commonly it’s sold with split limits. With split-limits auto liability coverage, 
you select three limits (the maximum your policy pays):
 
✓ One for injuries you cause to a single person
 
✓ One for all injuries you cause in a single accident involving two or more

✓ One for all damage to property you cause in a single accident
 
Table 5-2 provides examples of three of the most typical combinations of split 
limits.

If you buy a single liability limit of $300,000 on your home, cabin, and boat poli-
cies, you should get the same $300,000 limit on your car insurance. If you 
request that limit from an agent selling only split limits (instead of a single limit 
of $300,000), here are the split limits the agent may suggest as an alternative:
 
✓ $100,000 per person for injuries you cause
 
✓ $300,000 per accident for injuries
 
✓ $50,000 per accident for all property damage you cause
 
The danger of buying split-limits coverage is a false sense of security given to 
you by the injury limit per accident. The limit you’re actually most likely to 
exhaust in a car accident is the injury limit per person.
Suppose you buy the limits shown in the second column in Table 5-2. Your 
policy limits you to $100,000 per person and $300,000 per accident for inju-
ries you cause. Here are some hypothetical injury claims, what a jury may 
award, and what your policy pays with those split limits:
 
✓ You rear-end a car ahead of you with only one occupant, resulting in 
injuries to the driver’s neck and back. Jury award: $250,000. You have a 
$300,000 limit per accident for injuries, so you’re fine, right? Well, your 
limit per person that you injure is $100,000, so you’re out $150,000.

51
 Chapter 5: Managing Your Personal Automobile Risks
 
✓ You rear-end the same car, but with two occupants. Both have neck and 
back injuries, one more serious than the other. Jury awards: $200,000 
to one, $50,000 to the other. You guessed it. The policy pays the full 
$50,000 for the less seriously injured person but only $100,000 for the 
more seriously injured person, and you’re out $100,000 ($200,000 minus 
the $100,000-per-person limit).
Neither of these scenarios involves catastrophic lawsuits, permanent serious 
injuries, or death. They are, in short, relatively ordinary. But look at what you 
would owe with split-limits coverage!
In both accident examples, the total amount of jury awards is within the 
$300,000 per accident limit. But because the policy also has a per person 
limit, the judgment costs you astronomical sums of money that you would 
not have owed if you had a $300,000 single-limit coverage.
 
Don’t forget about legal fees. Legal fees in an accident defense case can run 
$50,000, $100,000, or more! After you’ve used up your liability limit per acci-
dent, those legal costs come out of your pocket. Every time you’re sued for 
more than your policy limits, you’ll get a friendly letter from your insurance 
company (certified mail, of course) that tells you that after their policy limits 
have been paid out, you’re on your own.
 
So, how can you avoid the per-person pitfall of split-limits coverage? Because 
the vast majority of car accidents involve cars occupied by only one person, I 
recommend one of three strategies:
 
✓ Select a per-person limit high enough to meet your lawsuit coverage 
needs for one person’s injuries. In the two accident examples I just 
gave, for example, $250,000 to $500,000 of liability coverage per person 
would have saved you hundreds of thousands of dollars out of pocket 
for as little as $100 a year in additional insurance costs, if you’re insur-
ing two cars.
 
✓ Buy single-limit coverage — one pool of money large enough to cover 
all injuries and property damage without a limit on the amount paid 
to any one person. Because this includes property damage, and any 
amount spent to pay for property damage reduces the amount left to 
pay for injuries, be sure to buy a little extra coverage. The least amount 
of coverage you should consider is $300,000 to $500,000.
 
✓ Buy a second layer of liability insurance, called an umbrella policy, of 
$1 million or more. (See Chapter 15 for more on the personal umbrella 
policy.)

Insuring Your Personal Injuries
Injuries, often quite serious ones, happen in car accidents far more than in 
any other type of accident — plane, train, industrial, and so on. If you’re 
injured in a car accident, you usually have more than one source from which 
to collect your medical bills and lost wages. One source may be your own 
health and disability insurance. Another source may be the personal liabil-
ity coverage of the other driver, if the accident was his fault and if he has 
any insurance. But the process of collecting from the other driver can take 
months or even years. A third source is your car insurance.
You’ve got two types of coverage in a personal auto policy for your injuries in 
a car accident:
 
✓ Coverage for compensatory damages (what your injuries would be 
worth in a court, including compensation for pain and suffering) for your 
injuries caused by uninsured or under-insured motorists
 
✓ Coverage for your medical bills (and lost wages in some states) regard-
less of fault
I address these separately, because I have different recommendations for each.
Understanding uninsured and under-
insured motorist coverage
When you’re injured in a car accident caused by another driver, you can 
legally sue the other driver in most states to collect the fair value of your 
injury. If that driver has auto liability coverage, his policy pays you on his 
behalf, up to the liability policy limit he purchased. The economic value of 
your injury equals your out-of-pocket expenses plus compensation for your 
pain and suffering.
But what if the other driver has no insurance at all? Or what if the insurance 
limit he has is less than the costs of your injury? You can get a legal judgment 
against him and try to collect from him personally. But that can be an expen-
sive, long, drawn-out process. Plus, if he’s not worth very much and has a 
limited income, you may not collect much at all.
Fortunately, your own car insurance policy can solve the problem, if you buy 
adequate limits of uninsured motorists and under-insured motorists coverage.

53
 Chapter 5: Managing Your Personal Automobile Risks
 
✓ Uninsured motorists are other drivers who are either unidentified (hit 
and run) or have no liability insurance at all.
 
✓ Under-insured motorists are other drivers who have some auto liability 
coverage but the economic value of your injury exceeds their liability 
limit.
I see these two coverages as a form of reverse liability in that you collect 
some or all of the economic value of your injuries caused by another driver 
from your own insurance company, almost as if they were the other driver’s 
insurer. In short, uninsured and under-insured motorists coverage make 
up the gap between the other driver’s liability coverage and the amount of 
liability coverage he would have needed in order to pay your claim in full — 
subject, of course, to the amount of uninsured or under-insured motorists 
coverage you buy.
How do the two coverages work? Say you’re injured in a car accident 
caused by a driver who runs a stop sign. The economic value of your injury 
is $450,000. Now, assume that you bought $500,000 of both uninsured and 
under-insured motorists coverage under your own auto policy. For an under-
insured motorist, first, you collect for your injury from the other driver’s 
insurance in the amount of the other driver’s liability limit (say, $100,000). 
Then, you collect the balance of $350,000 from your own insurance company 
under your under-insured motorists coverage. Had the other driver been 
without any insurance, you would have collected all $450,000 under your 
uninsured motorists coverage.
 
Buy as much protection for your own injuries (caused by another person) as 
you buy to cover the injuries you yourself cause to someone else. In other 
words, buy the same uninsured and under-insured motorists coverage limits 
as you buy liability insurance limits to the extent those coverages are avail-
able in your state. Why? Because you’re worth every bit as much as a com-
plete stranger whom you might injure. Cover yourself accordingly.
Saving money on medical coverage
Coverage for your medical bills (and sometimes lost wages and replacement 
services — help around the home you have to hire) is generally offered by car 
insurance companies. Depending on your state’s laws, this medical coverage 
generally comes in two flavors:
 
✓ Medical payments coverage (plain vanilla)
 
✓ Personal injury protection coverage (banana fudge supreme)

54
Part II: Cars, Boats, RVs, and More: Insuring the Things You Drive 
Both coverages are similar in the sense that they pay your medical bills suf-
fered in a car accident, regardless of fault, up to the limit you purchased. 
Personal injury protection has the added advantage (at a considerably 
greater cost) of also reimbursing you for some of your lost wages or replace-
ment services. Some states even allow you (for an additional premium) to 
add together the personal injury coverage limits per car (called stacking) to 
cover a single injury (for example, $20,000 coverage per car × 3 cars on the 
policy = $60,000 total medical coverage for a single injury).
 
I don’t have space to cover all the different requirements or costs relating to 
these coverages, but keep in mind three things when buying either coverage:
 
✓ Check the law in your particular state. State laws on medical payments 
coverage or personal injury protection coverage vary dramatically.
 
✓ Buy only as much medical-related coverage as the law requires. 
Medical and disability costs should be covered under other policies you 
have, so having additional car insurance coverage is redundant.
 
✓ Don’t buy additional coverage for your medical bills and/or lost wages 
from car accidents only. This approach is betting that those particular 
kinds of expenses will happen just in an auto accident and is a violation 
of the principle “Don’t buy Las Vegas insurance” (see Chapter 2).
 
 Not buying more than minimum coverage limits for either medical pay-
ments or personal injury protection is an area where you can save 
money on your insurance. To fully transfer the risks of medical pay-
ments and personal injury, not just those arising from car accidents but 
from any illness or injury, you need major medical insurance and long-
term disability insurance — both of which cover financial losses no 
matter how the losses are caused, rendering special insurance to cover 
the damages caused only by car accidents superfluous.
 
 If you don’t already have major medical and long-term disability cov-
erage in your insurance portfolio, I urge you to consider adding both 
immediately. (See Chapter 18 on buying health insurance and Chapter 22 
on disability insurance.)
Insuring against Damage to Your Vehicle
In this section, I tell you how to manage the risks of damage to your 
vehicle — risks such as fire, theft, collision, vandalism, glass breakage, 
and so on. The AART non-insurance strategies from Chapter 3, particularly 
reducing and retaining, apply to managing vehicle damage risks. Here are 
just a few examples of how to use non-insurance strategies to reduce risks:

55
 Chapter 5: Managing Your Personal Automobile Risks
 
✓ Carry an onboard fire extinguisher to reduce the risk of a serious fire.
 
✓ Always lock your car and install a burglar alarm to reduce the risk of theft.
 
✓ Park in a locked garage at home and always park in well-lit, nonisolated 
areas when away from home to reduce both theft and vandalism risks.
 
✓ Keep a safe distance behind the vehicle ahead of you to reduce the risks 
of both glass breakage and collisions.
You can use the retaining strategy by either choosing higher deductibles or 
not buying damage insurance at all and paying all claims out of your own 
pocket.
Insurance for vehicle damage is usually offered in two parts:
 
✓ Collision: Covers damage from colliding with another object (for exam-
ple, a vehicle, post, or curb), regardless of fault
 
✓ Comprehensive (also known as other than collision): Covers most 
other kinds of accidental damage to the vehicle, such as fire, theft, van-
dalism, glass breakage, hitting a deer, wind, or hail.
Both of these coverages are subject to a front-end copayment on your part, 
called a deductible. When buying either or both of these coverages, assume 
as much risk as you can afford, financially and emotionally (see the nearby 
sidebar, “Deductible psychology”), through higher deductibles — or don’t 
purchase these coverages at all.
 
A couple of things to keep in mind here:
 
✓ Make sure that the insurance company gives you enough of a price 
discount for taking the additional risk. I offer some guidelines for 
choosing the most cost-effective deductibles, as well as for determining 
the point where dropping these coverages on an older car makes sense, 
later in this chapter.
 
✓ If you’re on a tight budget but still need higher liability insurance 
limits to protect future assets or income (like if you’re a student in 
medical school), it may make sense to carry higher deductibles even 
if the money to cover them isn’t currently available. The savings will 
often pay for most or all of the cost of the additional liability coverage 
you need. Incredibly, the savings for raising your collision coverage 
deductible by just $250 (from $250 to $500) is often enough to pay for 
an extra $200,000 of liability insurance. No matter how tight things are, 
coming up with another $250 to fix dents is far easier than coming up 
with $200,000 to cover lawsuits!

56
Part II: Cars, Boats, RVs, and More: Insuring the Things You Drive 
 
If your driving record has deteriorated and your premiums are in danger of 
rising significantly with one more claim, I recommend very high deductibles, 
such as $1,000. In all likelihood you won’t file a small claim — and risk higher 
rates — so why pay for something you’re not going to use anyway?
Choosing cost-effective deductibles
I estimate that the average person has a claim for damage to her vehicle 
every four or five years, so I advise my clients to choose a higher deductible 
if the extra risk (the difference in deductibles) can be recouped via premium 
savings within a reasonable time (in other words, four to five years). The 
number of years it takes to recoup that added risk is called the payback 
period. The formula looks like this:
payback period = the difference in deductibles ÷ the difference in annual 
premiums
If you’re trying to figure out the most economical deductible, look at the 
hypothetical examples I offer in Tables 5-3 through 5-6 to better understand 
how to determine the best deductible for you.
Here’s an example of how to use a table: Table 5-3 is an example of insurance 
costs for collision and comprehensive coverage for a 3-year-old Lexus driven 
by a 47-year-old woman and used for business. Reading across from left to 
right in Table 5-3:
 
✓ The first row, “Deductible,” shows the different deductible choices for 
both damage coverages.
 
✓ The second row, “Extra risk,” shows the dollar amount of the difference 
between each deductible (the extra dollar amount you’ll be at risk for if 
you choose a higher deductible).
Deductible psychology
Make sure that you can emotionally afford a 
high deductible before changing your policy. 
I’ve had a number of clients who chose higher 
deductibles, but when the loss occurred part-
ing with the money caused them major stress. 
I have one well-to-do client who could easily 
replace her new Jaguar out of petty cash but 
who opts for the lowest deductibles the insur-
ance company offers. She knows herself well 
enough to be aware that parting with any 
money at claim time would be emotionally trau-
matic for her.

57
 Chapter 5: Managing Your Personal Automobile Risks
 
✓ The third row, “Annual premiums,” shows the annual insurance cost for 
each deductible.
 
✓ The fourth row, “Annual savings,” shows the annual insurance cost sav-
ings if you choose the next higher deductible.
 
✓ And the fifth row, “Payback period,” represents the number of years it 
would take without a claim to save, through your reduced premiums, 
the amount of extra risk you would assume by opting for higher deduct-
ibles. The payback period is determined by dividing the extra deductible 
risk in the second row by the annual insurance premium savings in the 
fourth row. If the payback period is less than four or five years, choosing 
the higher deductible makes good sense.

In Table 5-3, the extra risk, from the second row, to increase the collision 
coverage deductible from $250 to $500 is $250. The annual premium savings, 
from the fourth row, to make that change is $100. Dividing the $250 extra 
risk by the $100 annual savings, you get 21/2 years. That means if she goes 
21/2 years without any claims, she’ll save $250 on her insurance costs — the 
amount of the added risk she took by raising her deductible. Using the rule 
of choosing a higher deductible if the payback period is less than four or five 
years, it’s clear that raising the deductible makes sense.
The payback period from the example in Table 5-3 — even for the highest 
deductibles — is only five years for collision and comprehensive coverages, 
making it logical to take the added risk for both coverages.
Table 5-4 shows a 5-year-old Honda used to commute to work by a 35-year-
old man. Although the premiums are less than they are for the more expen-
sive Lexus in Table 5-3, the extra risk of the higher deductibles can still be 
recaptured in five years and is still worth taking.

Clearly, with payback periods of two and a half years or less for each deduct-
ible, this high-risk driver is better off with the highest deductibles possible. 
Not to mention that, with three tickets, he won’t be turning in small claims 
anyway, because they may result in his being dropped by the insurance com-
pany. Would he be better off not carrying the coverages at all? See the next 
section for tips on making that call.
In Table 5-6, check out what happens to the insurance costs for this same 
Chevy if the 19-year-old sells the car to his 74-year-old granny who has never 
had a ticket in her life. The payback period for the highest deductibles far 
exceeds the four- to five-year guideline. This driver would clearly be better 
off with low to midrange deductibles.

Knowing when to drop collision 
and comprehensive coverage
When deciding whether a vehicle’s value has decreased enough to drop one 
or both of these vehicle damage coverages altogether, you apply the same 
four- to five-year payback guideline as I explain in the preceding section. The 
only difference is that the extra risk you’re assuming is the full value of the 
vehicle (less any salvage value collectible from a junkyard).
Assuming an old Chevy has a junk value of $300 and would cost $2,500 to 
replace with an equivalent automobile, the net risk is $2,200 (the $2,500 value 
less the $300 salvage value). Dividing the $2,200 risk by the collision and com-
prehensive premium will give you the payback period. Drop the coverage if 
the payback period is five years or less.
Evaluating Road Service and 
Car Rental Coverages
Other coverages offered by most insurers are towing/road-service coverage 
and loss-of-use/car-rental coverage.
 
I believe towing/road-service coverage, though inexpensive, is better suited to 
automobile clubs, like AAA, Amoco, and others. They’re good at it, claims are 
paperless, and they offer a number of other vehicle services — all for a flat fee.

60
Part II: Cars, Boats, RVs, and More: Insuring the Things You Drive 
On the other hand, towing/road-service coverage under car insurance is not 
paperless — you must pay the claim first yourself (usually), then file a formal 
claim report and wait two to three weeks for reimbursement. Coverage 
also is often limited to a dollar amount ($25, $50, $75, and so on). And a 
large number of these claims combined with other tickets and accidents 
can impair your relationship with your car insurance company. I’ve seen it 
happen several times.
Loss-of-use/car-rental coverage is quite important. If a collision or other cov-
ered loss deprives you of your car, you probably need a substitute. If your 
car is badly damaged, or there is a parts delay, that car-rental bill could be 
several hundred dollars out of pocket. Loss of use covers the daily cost to 
rent a vehicle while yours is out of commission due to a covered loss. Costs 
covered typically range from $10 to $50 per day for up to 30 days. I recom-
mend buying at least a $30-per-day benefit.
 
There is another major benefit to loss-of-use coverage. Any delays by the 
claims adjuster in getting to your car penalize the insurance company — not 
you — by increasing the cost of the claim. So it’s to the insurance company’s 
advantage to see your car as quickly as possible. And the coverage saves you 
a lot of aggravation that repair delays would cause you otherwise.
Avoiding the marriage penalty
One of the most common mistakes I’ve seen 
agents make when insuring a married couple 
is to list the policy in the name of only one of 
the spouses — usually the husband. Besides 
the obvious sexism, this practice creates a 
coverage concern: An unnamed spouse has 
automatic insurance only while she lives in the 
household. If she moves out, her automatic cov-
erage ends. “But a spouse is covered equally 
with the partner who’s named on the policy. The 
policy says so!” goes the rebuttal argument. 
True, but only if the spouse is a resident of the 
household. Under many policies, if you, the 
unlisted spouse, are not a resident of the listed 
spouse’s household (for example, if you sepa-
rate for a long period), you may have coverage 
only if you have your spouse’s permission. It’s 
important to know that this exclusionary lan-
guage is fairly universal, not just in auto policies 
but in virtually every personal policy (covering 
homes, boats, and so on).
When you get married, get every insurance 
policy listed in both names, on page one. If 
you’re either married or separated, check your 
policies before you read any further — every 
one of them. If any of the policies are not in both 
names, call your agent or insurance company 
as soon as possible and get this omission cor-
rected.

61
 Chapter 5: Managing Your Personal Automobile Risks
A swing and a myth: Automatic 
coverage for new cars
I often get phone calls from clients wanting 
to add coverage for a newly purchased auto-
mobile that they’ve been driving casually for a 
couple of weeks. When I tell them that they’ve 
been driving without car insurance, they reply 
with a shocked, “But I thought I had 30 days 
of automatic coverage!” That is often not the 
case. Yes, you do have automatic coverage for 
newly acquired vehicles under certain circum-
stances (for example, if it’s the first Tuesday of 
the month following a full moon). But assuming 
that you have automatic coverage is a huge 
mistake. I won’t bore you to tears describing all 
the scenarios in which you don’t have cover-
age. Let me give you the bottom line instead.
When adding a newly purchased vehicle to your 
auto policy, always arrange for the insurance 
on the vehicle to commence prior to the day you 
transfer the title or the day you start driving the 
new car regularly, whichever comes first. If you 
don’t, you may be uninsured at claim time.
All personal auto policies provide automatic 
liability coverage when test-driving a vehicle. 
That coverage, however, often stops the day 
you acquire possession. Follow this iron-clad 
rule and never be caught with your insurance 
pants down.
Warning: If you’re selling a car, don’t rely on 
the buyer to complete the title transfer for you, 
or you may get a phone call in the middle of 
the night from the police wondering about your 
abandoned car that was in an accident involv-
ing some serious injuries. Whether you’re a 
buyer or a seller, always accompany the other 
person to the title-transfer office and request 
proof of the transfer. Then, if you’re the seller, 
remove the insurance from the car.

S
ome vehicle risks have their own special set of problems, beyond the 
usual issues addressed in Chapter 5. In this chapter, I address the spe-

We’ll Pick You Up: Insuring a Rental Car
Renting a car, whether for business or for pleasure, puts you face-to-face with 
risks that your personal auto policy may not cover. Here are the four main 
sources of liability you face when renting a car:
 
✓ You have direct liability for injuries or property damage that you 
cause to others while operating the rental car. If you run a red light and 
injure others or damage their vehicle, for example, you’re at fault and 
responsible.
 
✓ You’re directly liable for damage to the rental car that you cause by 
your negligent driving. If you run a red light and damage the rental car, 
for example, you’re responsible for the repair costs.

64
Part II: Cars, Boats, RVs, and More: Insuring the Things You Drive 
 
✓ You’re responsible for damage to the rental car — damage that you 
did not cause but for which you agreed to be responsible when you 
signed the rental contract. Every rental contract I have ever looked at 
makes the renter absolutely liable for all damage regardless of fault! This 
clause has always been nonnegotiable. This means that you’re respon-
sible for damages such as hail damage, someone else running a red light 
and hitting you, someone vandalizing the car by keying it, or someone 
hot-wiring the car and stealing it. In short, if you return the car with 
any damage at all, you owe. With the cost of new cars today, that could 
mean more than $25,000 if the car is totaled or stolen.
 
✓ You’re liable for the loss of revenues the car rental agency suffers as a 
result of the car being unavailable to rent while being repaired. Again, 
you’ll owe this loss of revenue regardless of whether you actually caused 
the damage. You agree to be responsible when you sign the contract.
In the following sections, I fill you in on your options for addressing these 
sources of liability so that you’re at the least risk possible when you rent a car.
Uncovering how your auto 
policy covers car rentals
How well do you think your auto policy would cover the four types of liabili-
ties I list earlier? Because personal auto policies vary somewhat, it’s always 
best to check with your agent or insurer prior to renting, but here’s the norm:
 
✓ Injuries and property damage that you cause as a driver: Usually 
you’re covered up to your liability policy limit.
 
✓ Damage to the rental car that you cause: You are covered only if you 
have collision and comprehensive coverage on at least one of the vehi-
cles on your policy, subject to your deductible. You are not covered oth-
erwise; in this case, you may need to buy the collision-damage waiver 
coverage from the car rental company (see the next section).
 
✓ Damage to the rental car that you didn’t cause: You have contractu-
ally agreed to be responsible for all damage, regardless of whether you 
caused it. Again, you are covered only if you have collision and compre-
hensive coverage on at least one of the vehicles on your policy, subject 
to your deductible. You are not covered otherwise.
 
 Be sure to check with your insurance provider prior to renting a car to 
see exactly how your policy will apply, because policy language varies 
from company to company. Also, ask your agent to advise you about any 
state laws that may affect your coverage.
 
✓ Rental company’s lost income while a damaged car is being repaired: 
You may be covered only if you have loss-of-use coverage on at least 
one vehicle on your policy, and then only up to your loss-of-use policy 

65
 Chapter 6: Dealing with Special Auto Insurance Situations
limit (usually $20 to $50 per day). Your coverage depends on your insur-
ance company. You’re covered only up to a limit — for example, $20 a 
day. If you buy the optional collision-damage waiver coverage from the 
rental company, loss of use may be covered in full.
 
 Courts have ruled that rental companies can only charge you for their 
lost income on a car you return with damage if they had no other vehi-
cles available to rent.
Evaluating coverage from 
the rental agency
If you don’t have automatic coverage under your personal auto policy for 
any damage to a car you’re renting, regardless of cause, you should buy the 
optional collision-damage waiver (CDW) from the rental agency.
 
The CDW coverage supplied by rental car companies usually has two 
problems:
 
✓ Cost: It’s usually about $10 per day. If that amount doesn’t sound like 
much to you, consider that the bill comes to $3,650 over the course of 
a year. Compare that to perhaps $500 a year for collision and compre-
hensive coverage to insure the same car on your personal auto policy. 
Ouch!
 
✓ Restricted coverage: The average CDW coverage is full of restrictions 
that you would not tolerate if you were buying personal auto insurance. 
Often excluded are unlisted drivers, such as a spouse or friend who is 
sharing the driving with you. Other exclusions include driving outside 
the permitted geographic area, driving in a careless manner, or driving 
after drinking anything alcoholic — even a single drink. Read the fine 
print before you sign!
 
Even if you have insurance coverage for damage to a rental car on your per-
sonal auto policy, buying the CDW coverage from the rental agency may be 
advantageous in two circumstances:
 
✓ When protecting your auto insurance rates: One disadvantage of rely-
ing on your personal auto insurance policy to pay for damage to a rental 
car is that if you file a claim for which you are responsible, your rates will 
usually increase 20 percent to 25 percent for three years (the period of 
time most insurers surcharge rates for tickets and accidents). You won’t 
see an increase in your personal auto insurance rates if you file a claim 
under coverage that you purchased from the rental agency. If your driving 
record is already borderline, filing another claim against your insurance 
may even lead to your company canceling your policy. If either of those is 
an issue for you, you may want to consider buying the coverage from the 
rental agency and saving your personal auto coverage as a backup.

66
Part II: Cars, Boats, RVs, and More: Insuring the Things You Drive 
 
✓ When renting for business: Buying the rental agency’s coverage is 
also a good idea when you’re renting for business purposes and your 
employer reimburses your expenses. Because you’re using the rental 
car for your employer’s benefit, it seems reasonable that your employer 
should pay for the insurance and any claim costs.
Covering your rental car with a credit card
Your fancy, new, super-shiny credit card has promised you insurance cover-
age if you use it to rent a car. How safe should you feel knowing that your 
card is protecting you and your rental car? Well, some cards offer very broad 
coverages; others are very restrictive. Some have a dollar limit; others don’t.
Most credit card coverages don’t pay for damage to a rental car until you 
prove in writing that your personal auto policy doesn’t provide coverage. 
That can be a major disadvantage, because the entire cost of the rental car 
damage will be charged to your credit card until you get that proof.
 
I wouldn’t rely on coverage from your credit card unless it does both of the 
following:
 
✓ Provides primary coverage, which means it pays first and ignores your per-
sonal auto coverage. Diners Club is an example of a card that does this.
 
✓ Has no exclusions that could hurt you, such as careless driving, driving 
after even a single drink, and so on.
One for the road
I once had a client who took a business trip with 
a friend and coworker to California. My client 
signed the rental contract and listed his friend 
as a permitted driver. He bought the CDW cov-
erage from the rental agency. Later, he and his 
friend went to dinner. Both had a glass of wine 
with their meal. The friend drove the rental car 
back to the hotel parking lot where, in the dark, 
he drove over one of the concrete meridians, 
causing significant damage to the underside of 
the car — $3,500 in damage, to be exact.
Although the friend was a permitted driver, the 
rental agency declined to pay for the damage 
because of the alcohol-use exclusion and a 
careless-driving exclusion in their CDW con-
tract. If that wasn’t bad enough, guess who the 
rental agency came after for the $3,500? It was 
not the friend who caused the accident. It was 
my client, who signed the car rental agreement 
in which he agreed to be absolutely responsible 
for all damage no matter what the cause.
The moral of the story? Know what you’re sign-
ing. And if you’re sharing the rented car with 
a second person other than a family member, 
have the rental agreement listed jointly in both 
names and have the other person cosign the 
rental agreement, so that you share the damage 
responsibility.

67
 Chapter 6: Dealing with Special Auto Insurance Situations
Best advice? Order a sample policy ahead of time. Read (or ask your agent to 
read) the policy and all its exclusions, and to make sure it pays first before any 
other insurance you have. If it does that, with no exclusions of any concern, 
use the card and decline the watered-down coverage from the rental agency.
As for the four risks associated with renting a car, your personal auto policy 
covers the first one — injuries and property damage you cause. The credit 
card coverage should cover the other three.
Getting backup coverage from 
your personal umbrella
If you don’t have automatic coverage under a personal auto policy, you need 
to accept the CDW coverage from the rental agency or take the coverage 
your credit card company offers. But you have a $25,000 car you’re responsi-
ble for and you’re concerned about the coverage limitations of either choice. 
What can you do? Good news! You can find backup coverage with the right 
personal umbrella policy.
Renting abroad
When you’re renting a car abroad, the rental 
agency offers you two optional insurance 
coverages:
 ✓ Liability coverage, covering your responsi-
bility for injuries and property damage you 
cause to others.
 ✓ Vehicle damage coverage, covering your 
responsibility for any damage to the rental 
car. (This coverage is very similar to the 
domestic CDW coverage.)
Virtually all automobile policies sold in the 
United States do not provide coverage outside 
the United States, its possessions, and Canada. 
Therefore, I recommend buying all the cover-
age you can from the rental agency when 
you’re abroad, including liability coverage for 
injuries and property damage, as well as vehi-
cle damage coverage for damage to the vehicle 
you’re renting.
However, one exception exists: If you have a 
personal umbrella policy, you’re probably pro-
tected worldwide for liability. I’ve never seen an 
umbrella policy that did not provide worldwide 
coverage. To be safe, have your umbrella policy 
agent confirm this fact before you decline other 
types of international coverage.
I do, however, recommend that you buy the 
vehicle damage coverage from the rental 
agency. Even if your umbrella policy covers the 
damage, as many do, this additional protection 
can help you avoid unnecessary hassles and 
delays in your trip.

68
Part II: Cars, Boats, RVs, and More: Insuring the Things You Drive 
Start by checking with the agent or company writing your personal umbrella 
policy, if you have one. It’s a little-known fact that many — but not all — 
umbrella policies pay 100 percent of the damage to a car you rent, regard-
less of who caused the damage, as long as the rental contract makes you 
responsible. The umbrella coverage is usually subject to a deductible, typi-
cally $500. (See Chapter 16 for more on choosing the right umbrella policy to 
cover the liability coverage gaps in your life.)
 
Relying on this umbrella strategy has one disadvantage: possible claims settle-
ment delays. So don’t use your umbrella policy exclusively. Keep it for the 
nice backup it is.
Put It on My Boss’s Tab: 
Driving a Company Car
If you’re fortunate enough to have your employer provide you with a com-
pany car, you’ve got a tremendous perk. These days, it’s probably worth at 
least $400 per month to you. Like the rental car situation, it has a few pitfalls, 
and employers are seldom aware of them.
What I want you to draw from this section is a healthy fear — just enough 
so that if you’re ever furnished a company car, you’ll know that insurance 
limitations exist. Fully informed, you can avoid those types of uses for 
which you aren’t covered, or you can provide supplemental insurance for 
the company car through one of the two insurance strategies I lay out for 
you in this section.
Vacationing with friends, family, 
and expensive vehicles
This type of share-the-expense, share-the-
driving arrangement happens fairly frequently 
among friends and family members taking trips 
together. Usually, it involves renting something 
expensive like a deluxe van or a motor home. 
Anytime you’re responsible for a $150,000 motor 
home, you’d better be sure about the insurance 
arrangements before you get started!
When you rent a vehicle in this type of situation, 
always do three things:
 ✓ Have all parties sign the contract so that 
everyone is jointly liable.
 ✓ Buy the optional CDW coverage from the 
car rental agency to avoid possible hassles 
if the vehicle is damaged.
 ✓ Most important, check with your insurance 
agent in advance. Ask if your automobile 
and umbrella coverage will protect you (as 
a backup).

69
 Chapter 6: Dealing with Special Auto Insurance Situations
When you’re furnished a company car, you’re insured while driving it for 
your liability for injuries and property damage you cause to others by your 
employer’s business auto policy. You’re covered when driving other com-
pany vehicles as well, and even when driving borrowed or rented vehicles on 
company business.
 
There are, however, two driving situations that the company business auto 
policy usually won’t provide liability coverage for:
 
✓ When you borrow or rent vehicles for personal use
 
✓ When you injure a coworker riding with you in the company car
If you own and insure another car, the solution to both liability coverage 
gaps is simple and cheap: For driving borrowed or rented cars, your personal 
auto policy includes liability coverage automatically. Problem solved!
 
To protect yourself from the risk of injuring coworkers while driving your 
company car, ask your insurance agent to add an extended non-owned auto 
endorsement. The annual cost for this optional coverage is about $25 per year.
 
If you don’t own a personal vehicle and the only car in your household is the 
company car, you’ve got three possible strategies to choose from:
 
✓ The best (but also the most expensive) and safest is to cover both unin-
sured liability coverage gaps by buying a named non-owner personal 
auto policy. Because it is a personal auto policy, you have automatic 
liability coverage for driving other cars you borrow or rent. And because 
you’re specifically insuring your use of the company car, your liability 
for coworker injuries is also covered automatically.
Don’t mix business and pleasure
Some owners of small, family-owned busi-
nesses or corporations decide to insure a vehi-
cle they use personally under a personal rather 
than a business auto policy (even though the 
title to the vehicle is in the corporate name for 
tax purposes). Personal auto insurance is, on 
the average, about 30 percent less expensive 
than business auto insurance, so this does save 
money on the front end. But it can also lead to 
large uninsured claims on the back end.
When it comes to large risks, safe is better 
than cheap. When buying a car that you use 
for business, the safest approach is to insure 
the vehicle the same way you title it. Business 
title? Get a business policy. Personal title? Get a 
personal policy. You’ll avoid all the serious cov-
erage gaps that come with doing it any other 
way.

70
Part II: Cars, Boats, RVs, and More: Insuring the Things You Drive 
 
✓ A second strategy for managing the company car coverage gap has two 
parts:
 
• Have your employer add a broad-form drive-other-cars endorse-
ment to his business auto policy, which covers your liability while 
driving borrowed or rented vehicles. Make sure you also add all 
licensed family members to this endorsement; otherwise, they 
aren’t covered.
 
• Buy a personal umbrella policy of $1 million or more to cover 
injuries you cause to coworkers while using the company car. 
(See Chapter 16 for more on plugging coverage gaps with personal 
umbrella policies.) Be careful. Not all umbrella policies cover this 
risk. Be sure you include the company car on the application for 
the policy.
 
✓ A third strategy is one of the ARRT non-insurance strategies from 
Chapter 3: avoidance. You can avoid both risks by never driving cars 
other than the company car and never driving with coworker passengers.
 
 The avoidance strategy works only if you follow it perfectly. If you cheat 
even once, you risk incurring a catastrophic amount of liability. Because 
of the difficulty of following the avoidance strategy, I recommend you 
use one of the first two strategies instead. I mention the avoidance 
strategy only because I’ve had clients choose it — although their choice 
made me extremely nervous.
I Want It My Way: Protecting 
Your Customized Vehicles
Today, it’s fairly common for people to buy vehicles that are highly custom-
ized. What do I mean by customized? This broad category can include custom 
paint jobs, captain’s chairs, carpeting, high-end stereos, TVs, DVD players, 
refrigerators, slide-in campers, or pickup toppers. And don’t forget the spe-
cialized equipment installed in vehicles designed to assist the handicapped, 
such as wheelchair lifts.
If the equipment is anything beyond that which comes standard from the 
factory, the majority of auto policies do not insure that extra equipment for 
damage (for example, loss through theft, fire, vandalism, or collision).
You can, however, insure the custom equipment if you declare it to the insur-
ance company and pay an extra premium. Compare the price against the ben-
efits and decide if it’s worth the cost. That way you won’t have any surprises 
if you opt not to cover your customizations and face a loss.

 Chapter 6: Dealing with Special Auto Insurance Situations
Antiques Roadshow: Insuring Your 
Antiques and Classic Cars
The biggest concern that owners of classic cars have when insuring them is 
getting back the full collector’s value of the car — not just the book value. For 
example, the book value on a 1965 Ford Mustang convertible may be $500 for 
an unrestored car. However, the car may be worth $10,000 in restored condi-
tion. So how do you get an insurance company to pay out the $10,000 instead 
of the $500 for your classic car?
The insurance industry’s solution to this problem is an optional coverage 
they call stated-amount coverage. Here’s how it works: You collect and send 
to your insurance company both interior and exterior photos of the car and a 
market-value appraisal from a competent appraiser. The car is then listed on 
the policy for $10,000 (or whatever it’s worth), and you pay a premium based 
on that $10,000.
If the car is stolen, how much do you expect to collect? Ten thousand dol-
lars? Not likely. Stated-amount coverage pays the market value of the car at 
the time of the loss, not to exceed the stated amount (in this case, $10,000). 
People who buy stated-amount coverage mistakenly expect to receive the 
appraised value of the car if it is stolen or totaled. In the case of the Mustang, 
however, if the market has recently soured and the market value of the car is 
$6,000, you receive $6,000 — not the $10,000 that your premiums have been 
based on. Now assume that the market for the Mustang has improved, and the 
car’s value is $13,000. How much will you receive? Unfortunately, $10,000 — 
not $13,000.
 
Obviously, an inequity exists here. The major pitfall of stated-amount cover-
age is that it pays the lesser of the stated amount and the actual value of the 
car at the time of the loss. It does not pay any increases in the car’s value.
 
Until the insurance industry comes up with a better solution, I recommend 
that you adopt the following strategy when insuring antique or classic cars:
 
✓ Do not buy the optional stated-amount coverage. Instead, opt for the 
usual actual cash value coverage that comes standard with the policy.
 
✓ Gather photos of both the interior and exterior, as well as any apprais-
als, and keep them in a secure place outside the vehicle to prove what 
you had if the car is ever stolen.
If the car is ever totaled or stolen, the insurance company owes you the 
actual cash value (ACV) — generally interpreted by most claims adjusters to 
be the market value of your specific vehicle — on the date of loss.. That is 

72
Part II: Cars, Boats, RVs, and More: Insuring the Things You Drive 
where the photos and appraisal come in. You simply bring that documenta-
tion to a competent appraiser at claim time, have her give you a new current 
value appraisal, and submit the photos and the new appraisal to the adjuster 
for payment. In the case of the examples involving the Mustang, you would 
receive its actual value at the time of the loss — $6,000 in the first example 
and $13,000 in the second.
Bottom line: If you adopt this strategy, you get paid properly. Plus, you save 
the substantial added premium that you would be charged for stated-amount 
coverage.
Get Your Motor Runnin’: Covering 
Your Motorcycle
 
Most of Chapter 5 on the subject of automobiles also applies to motorcycles, 
so this section is brief. Here are my insurance tips for licensed two-wheelers:
 
✓ Buy the same liability insurance limits for injuries and property 
damage to others that you buy for all your other insurance coverage 
(cars, home, boat, cabin).
 
✓ Buy the same liability limits for guest passengers riding with you, if 
those limits are available. If they’re not, don’t carry passengers!
 
✓ Avoid lay-up periods, during which all coverage except comprehen-
sive is suspended for a small premium credit. It’s simply not worth the 
risk of your forgetting and accidentally driving during the lay-up period, 
such as on an unseasonably nice day in February, with no insurance.
 
✓ Avoid buying more medical coverage than state law requires. It 
simply duplicates the health insurance you already should be carrying. 
Following this tip will save you quite a bit of money on your cycle insur-
ance. (If you don’t carry health insurance, you’re breaking one of my 
Chapter 2 rules and gambling with more than you can afford to lose!)
 
✓ If it’s available in your state, carry uninsured and under-insured 
motorists coverage in limits equal to your liability limits.
 
✓ If you’ve customized your cycle, make sure to list the additions on 
your application. You may have to pay an extra premium if you want 
that equipment covered.
 
✓ If your cycle is worth enough that you carry collision and comprehen-
sive coverage, follow the guidelines in Chapter 5 regarding how to 
choose the most cost-effective deductibles.

73
 Chapter 6: Dealing with Special Auto Insurance Situations
To reduce both the chance of — and the seriousness of — injury claims to 
yourself and others, follow the two best risk management tips I know of:
 
✓ Prevent serious head injuries. Everyone on the cycle should wear a 
helmet. No exceptions.
 
✓ Minimize the amount of time you carry passengers. Passenger injuries 
are the number-one source of lawsuits against motorcycle operators.
Insuring Your New Teenage Driver
That day you’ve dreaded forever is finally here. Your little darling is now of 
legal driving age and is doing exactly what all kids his age do to their parents: 
He’s bugging the crap out of you to drive.
In my opinion after insuring hundreds of these new drivers for clients over 
three decades, there are three steps parents can take to significantly impact 
their child’s success as a driver:
 
✓ Expose your teen to many more hours of driving with a permit under 
your supervision than the law requires them to have, under every type 
of condition possible (ideally 30 to 40 hours).
 
✓ Do not okay your teen’s licensing until he’s responsible in all areas of 
his life. How responsible he is outside a car is pretty indicative of how 
he’ll drive.
 
✓ After he does get licensed, set limits on his driving in that first year. For 
example, when he’s driving, change his curfew from 11 p.m. to 10 p.m., 
set the rule that he can’t have more than one passenger in the car, tell 
him he can’t drive on the freeway, and so on.
For several other ideas on reducing the risks involving a teen driver, see the 
latter part of Chapter 3.
 
Keeping in mind that new teen driver roughly doubles your rates on the car 
she most often drives if she is an occasional operator and triples the rates if 
she is a principal operator, here are some tips that will reduce your insur-
ance bill:
 
✓ Keep her as an occasional-use driver for as long as you can. This strat-
egy saves 30 percent off her principal driver rates. (To reap the benefit 
of this practice, make sure you always have fewer cars than you have 
licensed drivers in the household.)

74
Part II: Cars, Boats, RVs, and More: Insuring the Things You Drive 
 
✓ Have her drive the older family vehicle, the value of which is low 
enough to not need collision or comprehensive. This approach saves 30 
percent of her occasional driver cost. (Plus, the older car can handle a 
few learning-how-to-drive dings and dents.)
 
✓ Encourage her to get good grades. If she gets a B average or better, you 
may be able to save 15 percent on your insurance — check with your 
agent to see about the incentives your insurer offers.
 
✓ Teach her to be a safe driver. If she has no tickets or accidents, you may 
be able to avoid a 25 percent three-year surcharge, for example.
 
✓ If she goes off to college 100 miles or more away from home and doesn’t 
bring a car with her, ask for a distant student credit. This can save you 
70 percent to 80 percent on her insurance costs. Plus, she’ll be able to 
drive during vacations and holidays and will be covered at school when 
she borrows a friend’s car.
 
✓ When she becomes a driver of her own car, keep it titled in your name 
until she is officially out of the house. She’ll pay 30 percent more on her 
own policy.

Chapter 7
Insuring Recreational 
Toys and Trailers
In This Chapter
▶ Understanding the automatic coverage of homeowner’s policies
▶ Discovering the insurance options for boats and RVs you own
▶ Protecting yourself when renting recreational toys
▶ Understanding how to insure every type of trailer
P
eople love their toys: speedboats, sailboats, pontoons, jet skis, mopeds, 
all-terrain vehicles, go-karts, golf carts, snowmobiles, campers. . . . The 
list goes on and on. They’re great fun — and they pose some significant risks 
to the owners, because most of them have little or no coverage under stan-
dard auto and homeowner’s policies.
When you consider insuring your recreational toys (whether a boat or snow-
mobile, golf cart or ATV), keep in mind that they all share the same two risks:
 
✓ Risk to your personal assets from injuries or property damage you 
cause others: This risk has to be insured, and it should be insured at the 
same limits you buy for your cars and home.
 
✓ Risk of theft or damage to the toy itself: Here the decision as to 
whether to insure depends on the toy’s current value, the cost to insure 
it, and your tolerance for taking the risk yourself.
In this chapter, I give you the information you need to insure your watercraft, 
recreational vehicles, and trailers. I also share how you can protect yourself 
when you’re borrowing or renting them from others.

76
Part II: Cars, Boats, RVs, and More: Insuring the Things You Drive 
Man Overboard! Insuring Watercraft
A friend once told me the second happiest day of his life occurred when he 
bought a boat. The happiest day occurred when he sold it! In between those 
two happy events, here are the kinds of risks he faced — and you face — as a 
boat owner, along with my advice on how to protect yourself from each.
Covering your liability
The typical homeowner’s policy has a liability exclusion for boats, but it isn’t 
all bad news: It includes some exceptions that actually provide coverage. The 
homeowner’s boat liability exclusion addresses several different scenarios — 
owning, renting, or borrowing a boat. I spell it all out in Table 7-1, but keep in 
mind that the references to boat lengths and horsepower (HP) in the table are 
for purposes of illustration only — the exact horsepower and boat lengths vary 
from one policy to the next. Also keep in mind that this section of a homeown-
er’s policy can be confusing, so if you’re not sure what you’re covered for, talk 
to your agent.
 
Your homeowner’s policy watercraft coverage may be different from what you 
see in Table 7-1. Consult your agent or read your homeowner’s policy to find 
out the specifics for your situation. Homeowner’s policies vary widely when it 
comes to boat coverage.
Covering your risk without buying insurance
When managing the risks that come with water-
craft, recreational vehicles, and trailers, you 
can make very good use of the non-insurance 
techniques I cover in Chapter 3 — avoid, 
reduce, retain, and transfer (ARRT):
 ✓ Avoid: You can avoid the risk altogether by 
not buying these toys, although I’m assum-
ing if you’re reading this chapter, that isn’t 
an option for you.
 ✓ Reduce: You can reduce the risk by using 
your toys responsibly, storing them in a 
safe place, making sure that they’re always 
locked when not in use, and being careful 
about who you let use the vehicles. Make 
sure that the guy driving your go-kart is a 
safe driver. Just because he’s your wife’s 
sister’s neighbor, doesn’t mean he should 
be allowed behind the wheel.
 ✓ Retain: If the watercraft, recreational 
vehicles, or trailers are older, their damage 
may not be worth insuring against. If you do 
decide to insure it, you can reduce costs by 
retaining a portion of the risk — a sizable 
deductible.
 ✓ Transfer: Transferring works, for example, if 
you own a boat and are leasing it to others 
when you’re not using it. You can transfer 
much of the risk of damage to the boat 
while it’s being rented to the renter by use 
of a contract.

Many insurers are starting to exclude liability coverage for jet-ski-type one- or 
two-person watercraft regardless of horsepower due to the disproportionately 
large number of injuries and deaths involved with these watercraft. They run 
at very high speeds and are often operated by teens too young to appreciate 
their danger. If you own or occasionally use one, check with your agent to 
make sure you’re covered, and exercise good judgment regarding its use.
In the following sections, I offer some tips for managing your boat liability 
risks under your homeowner’s policy. The following tips assume coverage 
identical to that in Table 7-1.
 
Check with your agent or carefully read your policy to determine exactly what 
your policy covers.
 
Here are some non-insurance strategies you can use to decrease the risks 
involved in operating a boat — whether you own it, borrow it, or rent it:
 
✓ Don’t mix drinking and boating. This one doesn’t need any explanation.
 
✓ If you have a motorized boat, have all users take a boating safety 
class that’s been approved by the U.S. Coast Guard (www.uscg.mil). 
In addition to being safer boaters, you usually get a nifty discount (10 
percent to 15 percent) on your boat insurance premiums, for the rest of 
your life.
 
✓ If young people drive the boat, make sure that they’re well-trained 
and know exactly what they are and are not allowed to do. Many boat-
ing accidents start with kids goofing off behind the wheel.

For boats you own
If you own a boat with an outboard motor of 25 HP or less, or a sailboat less 
than 26 feet long, you won’t need to buy separate boat liability coverage 
because coverage is included — free — in your homeowner’s policy. If you 
own any other type of boat or motor, you don’t have automatic coverage and 
will need to buy boat liability coverage, either as a homeowner’s endorse-
ment or in a separate boat policy.
For boats you borrow
If you operate almost any boat of any size that is borrowed (meaning nei-
ther owned nor rented), you have automatic liability coverage. Here are two 
examples of when this most likely would occur:
 
✓ Your friend invites your family to go water-skiing with his boat. He does 
the driving at first, but now he wants to ski, so he asks you to drive. If 
you carelessly drive the boat in a way that injures him or you hit a swim-
mer and are sued, where would you get your coverage? Right here — in 
your wonderful homeowner’s policy.
 
✓ If you go sailing with a friend on her boat and she lets you take the helm, 
where do you get liability coverage if you cause injuries or collide with 
another boat? Again, in your homeowner’s policy.
For boats you rent
If you rent a boat — say, on vacation — you have automatic coverage for 
your liability for injuries or property damage in each case except for the fol-
lowing two situations:
 
✓ If the boat you rent has an inboard motor or an inboard/outboard motor 
of more than 50 HP
 
✓ If the boat is a sailboat 26 feet long or more
 
To get liability coverage for these two excluded types of rented watercraft, 
you can
 
✓ Buy coverage from the boat rental agency, if it offers the coverage. 
Many don’t.
 
✓ Be covered under your existing boat liability policy. If you own a boat 
at home for which you have a boat liability policy, it may include cover-
age for when you rent most other boats. Again, many don’t.
 
✓ Get the coverage from a supplemental personal-liability policy called 
an umbrella policy (see Chapters 15 and 16 for more information). 
Be sure to read your policy or check with your agent. Not all umbrellas 
cover boat rentals. If yours doesn’t, shop for a better policy.

79
 Chapter 7: Insuring Recreational Toys and Trailers
 
When you’re renting a boat that is excluded under your homeowner’s policy, 
if you can’t get coverage from some other source, then the best non-insurance 
strategy to practice is to avoid the risk (see Chapter 3). Either don’t rent at all, 
or rent something else for which you will be insured.
Covering damage to your boat
Boats — including their motors, trailers, and other equipment — are usually 
limited in most homeowner’s policies to $1,500 of coverage, plus no wind 
coverage unless they’re stored inside a building and no theft coverage away 
from home. In addition, many of the hazards related to boating — such as 
collisions, sinking, and hitting submerged rocks — are not covered at all.
 
If your entire watercraft setup is worth less than $1,500 and you can live with 
the limitations (regarding wind, theft, and hazards), then you may want to 
forgo insurance and cover any losses out of your own pocket. If you go this 
route, make sure that you store the boat in an enclosed building to prevent 
wind damage, and while you’re using the boat prevent theft by securing it well 
if you leave it unattended.
 
If you want broader coverage, including coverage for normal boating hazards, 
buy either a special watercraft policy or a homeowner’s endorsement with 
open perils coverage (which covers every kind of loss or damage to your boat 
with just a few exclusions, like wear and tear, intentional damage, and so on). 
Annual premiums are about 1 percent to 2 percent of the value of the boat and 
equipment. The deductible is at least $100, however. Choose a higher deduct-
ible if you save enough on the premium to justify taking the extra risk.
Many boat buyers buy the boat, motor, and trailer at a discounted package 
price. Yet most freestanding boat policies ask you to declare a separate value 
for each item — the hull, the motor, and the trailer. Because any one of the 
three can be stolen, make sure that the amount you insure each for is the 
retail cost to buy the item by itself. Be sure to include something, typically 
$300 to $500, for miscellaneous boat equipment (anchors, oars, life jackets, 
fuel tanks, seat cushions, depth finders, and so on). And don’t forget to 
include sales tax in your values.
Insuring Recreational Vehicles
When I refer to recreational vehicles, I mean motorized vehicles not licensed 
for road use, such as ATVs, go-karts, golf carts, mopeds, snowmobiles, and 
so on. (Even those little motorized cars for kids, like Power Wheels, fall in 

80
Part II: Cars, Boats, RVs, and More: Insuring the Things You Drive 
this category.) All motorized vehicles — except those used for service to the 
home itself (such as riding lawn mowers) — are excluded from homeowner’s 
property coverage. Why? Because these vehicles present a greater-than-
average risk.
Unlike watercraft — where there is some coverage for small watercraft under 
a homeowner’s policy — there is no automatic liability coverage for owned 
recreational vehicles. The one exception is when you use the vehicles on 
your residential property or on vacant land you own — in both of those 
cases, your homeowner’s insurance will cover you.
Most homeowner’s policies provide liability coverage for any borrowed or 
rented recreational vehicles, regardless of size or horsepower, if they aren’t 
licensed for road use. So you’re covered when you rent a golf cart at your 
local course, for example, or when you rent snowmobiles on your Rocky 
Mountain winter vacation.
 
If you drive to and from the golf course or if you live in a community that 
allows golf-cart use on local streets, your homeowner’s policy may not cover 
your liability for your road use automatically. Newer versions of homeowner’s 
policies recognize the growing use of golf carts in retirement communities for 
local transportation to and from the grocery store, for example, so they’ve 
made an exception for such use if it complies with local traffic ordinances and 
community association rules. If your homeowner’s policy doesn’t cover you, 
you can arrange coverage through your auto policy. When in doubt, check 
with your agent.
The only time you need to buy liability coverage for your use of recreational 
vehicles is if you own them yourself (as opposed to borrowing or renting 
them), and you’re using them off your own land. So, for example, if you plan 
to go snowmobiling out on your neighbor’s fields, and someone gets hurt, 
you’re not covered under your homeowner’s policy.
 
Most insurers offer liability and optional theft or collision coverage for recre-
ational vehicles. Some offer the coverage under a homeowner’s policy 
endorsement; others offer a stand-alone recreational vehicle policy; and still 
others cover them as a special endorsement to your car insurance policy. The 
coverage is usually equally good under any of the three choices, so price them 
all with your agent.
 
Even if you buy full insurance coverage for a go-kart, almost all policies 
exclude racing, both organized or informal, and coverage is difficult to 
come by.

81
 Chapter 7: Insuring Recreational Toys and Trailers
Avoiding the Hidden Danger 
of Recreational Rentals
 
Even when you’ve arranged liability coverage for injuries and property 
damage you cause to the public while renting boats or recreational vehicles, 
you don’t have liability coverage for damage to the rented item itself. (See the 
exclusion in your homeowner’s policy for property that is in your custody.)
Here’s an example of the problem for a boat rental that also applies when 
renting recreational vehicles of all types: You’re on vacation and you see 
a boat that you want to rent. If you’re like most people, you scribble your 
signature on a contract without reading it. (Who has time to read? You’re on 
vacation!) You pay a damage deposit, usually about $500, and you assume 
that if you damage the boat, you’ll just lose your deposit. Then you’re off, 
operating a boat that you may be unfamiliar with, on a body of water that you 
may also be unfamiliar with.
Your uninsured liability for damage to the boat itself occurs in two ways:
 
✓ Your legal liability for damage you actually cause to the boat when oper-
ating it yourself
 
✓ Your contractual liability in which you agreed to be responsible for any-
thing that happens to the boat, even when the damage is not your fault
“Okay, but the worst that can happen is that I’m out the damage deposit,” 
you say. Not true, unless the damage is less than the damage deposit. The 
damage deposit is just a deposit. If the boat is destroyed in a tornado, or if 
you hit some submerged rocks causing an engine fire that burns the boat, 
you’re liable for the cost of the repairs or the cost to replace the boat.
Now, assume you’re sharing the rental with a friend. You’re both driving the 
boat, and you’re splitting the cost. But you signed the contract; he didn’t. 
Your friend drives recklessly and seriously damages the boat. Who does the 
rental agency go after? You — because you agreed to be responsible for any-
thing that happens! Ouch!
 
How can you protect yourself? Read the contract before you sign it or have it 
faxed to your insurance agent. If the contract makes you responsible (most 
rental contracts do), there are two ways to protect yourself:
 
✓ Buy the optional insurance from the rental agency, but only if it 
covers all the damage you’re responsible for. Often, it does not.
 
✓ Rely on coverage in your umbrella policy. If it doesn’t cover damage to 
any boat you rent, find an umbrella policy that does. The good ones do. 
(See Chapter 16 for tips on buying the right umbrella policy.)

On the Road Again: Managing 
Trailer Risks
Trailers come in just about every size, shape, and color you can imagine. 
There are pop-up tent trailers, horse trailers, utility trailers, boat trailers, and 
trailers to haul recreational vehicles. There are rental trailers for household 
moves. And of course there are camping trailers with self-contained living 
quarters. Some of these are towed from place to place; others are parked at 
an owned or leased property and used as vacation homes.
Finding liability coverage
The good news is that, when you’re hauling any trailer — whether you own 
it or not — liability coverage from your auto policy fully extends to the 
trailer automatically for the same liability limits as you carry on your vehi-
cles at no additional charge. The bad news is that the free coverage from the 
auto insurance policy ends as soon as the trailer is disconnected from the 
Up the creek without a policy
I rented a 28-foot sailboat, worth $30,000, on 
Lake Pepin in Southern Minnesota. I paid the 
$500 damage deposit and was told that amount 
would be all I owed if I damaged the boat. When 
I read the contract, I pointed out to the gruff 
character behind the desk that his contract 
made me responsible for the entire $30,000 — 
not just for the $500 — if any serious damage 
should occur. He scoffed, “Don’t worry about 
that! The owner has the boat insured. All you’d 
owe is the $500 deductible. She’d collect the 
rest from her insurance company.” He’s cor-
rect. But what he doesn’t know is how quickly 
the insurance company would send me a reg-
istered letter and a copy of the rental contract 
I signed, demanding that I reimburse them for 
all repair costs, or even for the cost of buying a 
new boat. And I would owe them every penny! 
That is exactly what would happen (not a pretty 
picture).
Always read rental contracts. See if you’re 
responsible for just your deposit or for the 
entire boat. If you’re responsible for the entire 
boat, you need to arrange for insurance. Do not 
rely on verbal statements from rental agents. 
And don’t assume that the optional insurance 
the rental agent offers is comprehensive — 
that it covers all damage you’re responsible 
for. Make sure there’s no dollar limit on the 
coverage (such as a $2,000 limit on a $30,000 
boat). Read the policy exclusions. Make sure 
the policy doesn’t exclude something important. 
If the policy has either a dollar limit less than 
the boat’s value or if it excludes anything you’re 
doing, don’t buy it.

83
 Chapter 7: Insuring Recreational Toys and Trailers
vehicle. A homeowner’s policy does extend liability coverage to your trailer 
when it’s at your residence or temporarily elsewhere, like a camping trailer 
at a campground.
Premises liability coverage ends, however, for a camping trailer away from 
home if you own or lease the land on which it sits (such as an owned lake lot 
or a trailer park lot leased for the summer). For a modest charge (less than 
$20 per year), you can get an extension on your homeowner’s policy, provid-
ing liability coverage to the trailer and the lot on which it sits.
 
Never park a camping trailer on a vacant lot you own or lease long-term 
without endorsing your homeowner’s policy to extend liability coverage to 
that lot.
Covering damage to your trailer
Trailers are typically covered only up to a $1,500 limit on a homeowner’s 
policy. Like watercraft, there is usually no windstorm coverage if they are out-
side a building and no theft coverage away from home. If your trailer is worth 
under $1,500, if you can protect it against wind damage in the open and theft 
damage away from home, and if you can live with paying your homeowner’s 
deductible if the trailer is damaged or stolen, don’t buy additional insurance.
You can get full collision and comprehensive coverage on your trailer by 
adding the trailer and its value to your auto policy. However, it’s usually less 
expensive to insure a boat or RV trailer on the same form you use to ensure 
the boat or RV.
Personal property being hauled in a camping trailer is covered under the 
homeowner’s off-premises coverage for the same perils that the homeown-
er’s policy covers — you get little or no breakage coverage. If you add special 
perils coverage to your homeowner’s policy, breakage coverage would apply 
to all but glassware and other highly breakable items.
 
However, if the trailer is parked on a lot owned or rented long term (such as a 
lakeshore lot), there may not be any theft coverage when you aren’t there. In 
that case, reducing the risk may be your best choice. When you leave the 
trailer for any length of time, take high-theft items with you (such as your por-
table TV, computer, and so on), and spend the extra money on a quality lock.

Getting What You Deserve 
for Automobile Claims
In This Chapter
▶ Documenting your claim to collect top dollar
▶ Working with the insurance adjuster effectively
▶ Maximizing your settlement
▶ Getting more than book value when your car is totaled
T
he majority of claim disputes or unhappiness, based on my years of 
observation, arise from claims for damage to automobiles, homes, and 
personal property. This chapter focuses on your automobile damage claims. 
(Turn to Chapter 14 for home and personal property claims.)
Your automobile claim is underpaid or denied by an insurance company for 
three main reasons:
 
✓ The type of claim being submitted isn’t covered at all or not fully 
covered by your particular policy — although it would have been 
fully covered by a more comprehensive policy. This situation is the 
most common.
 
✓ The type of claim being submitted is never covered by any policy. 
This situation rarely occurs.
 
✓ The claim is mishandled by the insurance company. This situation 
occurs enough that you need to be aware of the problem.
The majority of the other chapters in this book focus on the first bullet — 
protecting yourself by having coverages that are right for the unique risks in 
your life. This chapter’s focus is on the last bullet. In this chapter, I show you 
what to do to make sure that your automobile claim will be paid in full.

Part II: Cars, Boats, RVs, and More: Insuring the Things You Drive 
When You’re at Fault: Collecting 
from Your Collision Coverage
You’ve just been involved in a collision, and you have collision coverage on 
your auto policy. Collision coverage pays to fully repair your car or replace 
it if it’s a total loss (minus your deductible, of course), regardless of who’s 
at fault. If you’re the primary cause of an accident and your car is damaged, 
there are only two places to get the money for repairs — collision coverage 
or your kid’s piggy bank.
You report the claim either to your agent or directly to the insurer. A claims 
adjuster contacts you. If your car is drivable, you may be asked to get one or 
two estimates, or the adjuster may inspect the car herself and write her own 
estimate.
 
Here are a few of the common problems you may encounter during this pro-
cess and what you can do to solve them:
 
✓ You don’t like the shop that the insurer recommends. Most insurance 
companies have relationships with body shops that they’ve found to be 
easy to work with, as well as reasonable in their estimates and in negoti-
ating repair costs. In most states, though, you have the right to pick the 
shop of your choice, and you can insist that your insurance company 
work with that shop.
 
 Some shops are known to be price gougers. It benefits everyone if you 
avoid those shops — keeping repair costs reasonable keeps premiums 
down.
 
✓ The adjuster demands that you get two or three estimates. Requesting 
one estimate is reasonable — get it from your preferred body shop. If it’s 
not inconvenient, getting a second estimate helps keep shops honest. If 
you prefer not to get a second estimate, you may have the right to refuse 
and request that the insurance company send an appraiser to work out 
a repair price with your shop, especially if your car is not drivable. As 
for a third estimate, refuse — it’s totally unreasonable of the adjuster to 
ask that of you.
 
✓ Your preferred shop won’t honor the adjuster’s estimate. Unfortunately, 
this situation occurs often. When an adjuster is busy, he’ll write an esti-
mate and hand or mail you a check for that amount. At first, you may be 
happy to have such prompt service. Then you bring your car in, and 
the body shop refuses to repair it for the amount the adjuster gave you. 
The body shop often points out damage that the adjuster missed. Don’t 
worry — just call the adjuster and ask him to work out a new repair price 
with your shop and issue you a second check.

87
 Chapter 8: Getting What You Deserve for Automobile Claims
 
 Never accept an estimate and payment before your preferred body shop 
agrees to do the repairs for that amount.
 
✓ The body shop wants additional money from you before it will release 
the car. The shop may do this for one of two reasons:
 
• The adjuster may have approved additional damage, but the 
second claim check has not arrived. If so, the solution is to sign a 
form (available in every body shop) authorizing your insurer to 
bypass you and pay the shop directly for the additional cost. Then 
most shops will release your car without further problems. If the 
shop still won’t release your car, the best bet is to charge the addi-
tional amount to your credit card.
 
• A second possibility is that the shop may be trying to pull a fast 
one. All reputable shops know that any supplemental repairs 
must be approved by the adjuster. If the shop surprises you with 
demands for more money when you arrive, it did the repairs with-
out an authorization. The shop is hoping that you’ll be so desper-
ate to get your car released that you’ll either pay the difference 
yourself or protest so loudly to your insurance company that it will 
pay just to appease you.
 
 If the shop did not get an approval, the shop is the bad guy. Don’t 
pay them. Sign an authorization for your insurance company to pay 
additional amounts, if any, to the body shop. The shop then has to 
do what it should have done and try to work things out with your 
adjuster. But then it’s the shop’s problem, not yours.
 
✓ The insurer won’t pay for new parts. You have a nice, clean, low-
mileage, 8-year old car. It’s banged up. The adjuster’s estimate is for 
used parts, but you want new parts. The insurance company is within 
its rights to replace your used parts with used parts. You have the right 
to make sure that the parts are in good condition, and you can refuse to 
allow them to be used if they aren’t. You also have the right to demand 
new parts, although you’ll have to pay the difference between the cost of 
new parts and the cost of used parts. Think of it this way: The insurance 
company is within its rights when it only pays for used parts because it 
only has to replace what you had — and your parts certainly had some 
wear and tear on them by the time you were in the accident.
 
✓ Getting cash when you won’t be making the repairs. The insurance 
company, not you, gets to choose whether to repair, replace, or pay 
cash. That said, most insurers still let you choose cash if you prefer. 
Companies differ on the amount of cash they pay — some pay you the 
full repair cost; others pay what they call an appearance allowance to 
compensate you for the loss in value of your damaged car. If you’re 
not happy with the amount of an appearance allowance, go to a dealer. 
Show the used-car manager your car. Ask him to write on his letterhead 
both the preaccident and postaccident values of your car. You’re enti-
tled to receive the difference between these two values if you decide not 
to repair the car (assuming that value is less than the repair costs).

88
Part II: Cars, Boats, RVs, and More: Insuring the Things You Drive 
Deciding whether to file a small claim: 
How insurance company pricing works
You back into a post and cause $973 in damage 
to your car. You have a $500 collision coverage 
deductible. You file the claim and collect the 
$473. Four months later, your auto insurance 
premium comes with an at-fault accident sur-
charge of $300 a year for three years. In short, 
you end up paying $900 to collect $473.
You aren’t happy. Why didn’t someone warn 
you so that you could have paid the claim your-
self? And how unfair that the dollar amount 
of the rate increase for your minor accident 
could exceed what you collected in your claim! 
Here’s why that happens and how you can pro-
tect yourself in the future.
When you buy car insurance, you get grouped, 
and share losses with, people similar to you in 
age, location, use of car, and driving record 
(tickets and at-fault accidents). When any 
of these factors change, you move to, and 
share losses with, a different group of drivers. 
(Remember when you turned 25 and your rates 
dropped 30 percent? On that day, you weren’t 
a better driver than the day before, but you 
transferred to a group of more experienced 
drivers who have fewer accidents and lower 
premiums.)
Similar changes in your insurance rate happen 
when you move from one city to another, or 
change the use of your cars, or when you get 
tickets or are in an at-fault accident. You simply 
change groups. When you hit a post and file a 
claim, you change groups — just like when you 
get a couple of speeding tickets.
Before you file a small claim with your insur-
ance company, find out first how much more 
you’ll pay over the next few years in insurance 
premiums. If it’s greater than the claim value, 
you’re probably better off paying the claim 
yourself. Note that some insurance companies 
forgive the charge for the first at-fault accident 
if you’ve been insured with them a while. Other 
companies won’t charge for at-fault accidents 
unless the amount they spend exceeds a cer-
tain threshold — typically $500 or $1,000.
Your agent, if you have one, should always 
warn you of the impact it will have on your 
future rates when you report a small claim. He 
can estimate for you the extra costs of reporting 
the claim and help you decide if it’s in your best 
interest to do so.
Remember: Never file a small claim for an acci-
dent you cause without first knowing the total 
impact on your rates — unless there’s even 
the smallest injury. If there’s any kind of injury, 
always file the claim, no matter how small, or 
you could void your liability coverage for that 
injury.
A good agent will look at the entire family driv-
ing record when deciding to report a small 
claim. Maybe this minor accident, combined 
with a speeding ticket from two months ago, 
will jump your rates $1,500 over three years. 
Maybe the family driving record is so bad that 
one more accident will cancel your policy 
and force you into high risk insurance where 
the rates are double what you’re paying now. 
Under these circumstances, you may not even 
report a $2,500 accident. It may be cheaper, in 
the long run, to pay for it yourself.
If you do have a poor driving history, it may 
make sense not to carry collision coverage or 
to have high deductibles. Why pay for coverage 
that you aren’t going to use?

89
 Chapter 8: Getting What You Deserve for Automobile Claims
When It’s the Other Guy’s Fault: 
Considering Other Factors
When you’re in a collision caused by the other driver, you often have the 
choice between using your own collision coverage (if you have collision 
coverage) or collecting from the other driver’s liability insurance (if he has 
liability insurance). If you have no collision coverage on your car, you only 
have one choice: to collect from his insurance (or from him, personally, if he 
has no insurance).
 
Collision insurance pays to repair your car if it’s damaged in an accident, 
regardless of who’s at fault.
 
As a general rule, if your damage is caused by the other driver and you have 
collision coverage, you should collect from your own coverage, especially if 
your car is not drivable. Your insurance company will almost always be faster 
and easier to deal with, because you’re its customer. And, unlike with the 
other driver’s insurance company, your claim won’t be delayed because of an 
investigation (see “Proving your version of the accident,” later). Also, you’ll 
spend less in the long run, in spite of your collision deductible, in states where 
subrogation (see the “Sub-ro-what?” sidebar) and comparative negligence (see 
the “Comparative negligence: Assigning blame” sidebar) are allowed.
Sub-ro-what?
You’re in a wreck. Another driver caused the 
accident, but you choose to have your insur-
ance, under collision coverage, pay for the 
damage to your vehicle. Your legal rights to 
seek reimbursement from the other driver are 
transferred to your insurance company. This 
transfer of rights is known as subrogation. 
Your company gets compensated by the other 
driver’s company.
When your insurance company subrogates 
against the other driver, it usually tries to get 
your deductible reimbursed too, saving you a lot 
of hassle. For various reasons, it often collects 
less than 100 percent of the amount that it spent 
fixing your car. Whatever percentage it collects, 
you get the same percentage of your deductible 
back. The bad news is that the collection pro-
cess often takes six months or more. So when 
you spend your deductible, don’t look for the 
cash to come back to you anytime soon.

90
Part II: Cars, Boats, RVs, and More: Insuring the Things You Drive 
One of the biggest drawbacks to collecting from the other driver’s insurance 
is the delay in getting paid. Before the other driver’s insurance company can 
pay you, it has to interview the other driver and investigate the accident. 
That can take two weeks.
 
To expedite the process, you can
 
✓ Call and report the claim directly to the other driver’s insurance 
company or agent. When you aren’t the other company’s customer, the 
company may very likely take a few days just to get the claim reported 
and set up, so you’ll save time by getting the process started right away.
 
✓ When reporting the accident, get the other driver’s insurance com-
pany’s okay to pay for a rental car. If it balks and you need a rental, get 
one anyway and let the insurer know about it. Why? Because when the 
company is paying for a rental car, it speeds up your claim processing. 
Without a rental car, its slow processing hurts you; with a rental, delays 
hurt the insurance company. If the accident is the other guy’s fault, his 
insurance owes you both for the cost to repair you car and the cost 
of a replacement vehicle. Some insurance companies claim they don’t 
cover your rental. That’s baloney — if the company balks, send the bill 
directly to the other driver.
Comparative negligence: Assigning blame
Most states use comparative negligence to 
apportion fault in an auto accident. Comparative 
negligence takes into account the fact that not 
all accidents are 100 percent the fault of one 
driver. If you rear end someone who is sitting at 
a red light, you probably would be assessed 100 
percent of the fault. But if you pull from a stop 
sign into the side of a passing car, you may be 
assigned 85 percent of the fault, and the other 
driver may be assigned 15 percent.
The percentage of fault assessed the lesser at-
fault driver depends on how much opportunity 
that driver had or should have had to avoid the 
accident. There’s no hard and fast rule about 
fault.
If you have collision coverage and you live in 
a comparative negligence state, you’re almost 
always better off using your collision cover-
age, paying your deductible, and letting your 
insurance company subrogate against the 
other driver or insurance company — unless 
the other driver is 100 percent at fault. After 
subrogation, your net cost will always be less 
than collecting directly from the other driver’s 
insurance.

Navigating the Total-Loss Maze
When the costs to repair your car exceed your car’s value, you have what’s 
known as a total-loss claim. (If you want the full-blown details on how an 
insurance company figures this out, check out the nearby sidebar, “How you 
know if your car is really totaled.”)
If your car is a total loss, the actual cash value (that is, the preaccident 
market value) of your specific car at the time of loss needs to be established. 
Remember, this is different from book value. Book value is the average selling 
price of a car like yours, with similar features and mileage, in a cleaned up, 
dent-free condition. Various used car guides list these prices.
You should know three things about book value:
 
✓ It’s the average selling price for a car like yours, in your area, which 
means there were plenty of cars that sold for more — some even much 
more. Your mint car could be one of those. Of course, the reverse could 
also be true.
 
✓ It’s a guide — it says so right on the cover — not a bible.
 
✓ It doesn’t always take into account the supply and demand factors in 
your particular area. A sports car in Alaska may not be worth as much 
as a sports car in Los Angeles.
How you know if your car is really totaled
Your insurance company must determine three 
values before concluding that your car is a total 
loss:
 ✓ The value of your car at the time of the 
accident
 ✓ The total cost to repair your vehicle
 ✓ The amount a salvage yard would pay for 
your car
Your car is a total loss if the repair cost exceeds 
the car’s preaccident value minus any salvage 
value. For example, let’s say your car’s preacci-
dent value was $5,300 and the repair estimate is 
$4,800. At this point, it seems like the insurance 
company is $500 better off repairing your car. 
But now factor in salvage value. The salvage 
company bid is $850. The insurance company 
will total out your car because its net cost to do 
so is $5,300 (paid to you) less $850 (which it will 
get from the salvage company). Your insurance 
company ends up losing $4,450, which is $350 
less than the $4,800 it would have had to pay 
to fix the car.
Now suppose the repair estimate was only 
$4,000. The insurance company would probably 
still total it, because of hidden damage. Most 
estimates to repair seriously damaged cars 
underestimate the final costs because all the 
damage can’t be seen until repairs are started 
and the outer parts are removed. What starts 
out looking like a $4,000 repair often ends up 
costing closer to $5,000 or $6,000.

For all these reasons, the book value will be different from your specific car’s 
preaccident market value. (You can check out the book value of your car at 
www.kellybluebook.com.)
 
The pre-accident value of your car is what you would have to pay to replace it 
with a car almost exactly like yours. Therefore, your insurance company 
needs to check with used-car dealers to see what price your car, preaccident, 
would sell for. Push the insurance company to get at least three estimates 
from local dealers. (But be warned: The dealers may give the company a price 
that’s lower than the book value.)
To get the best settlement offer possible, check with at least three dealers 
yourself. Clip out any newspaper used-car ads for cars similar to yours. When 
you call dealers, talk only to the used-car manager, whose opinion will carry 
more weight than a salesman’s. Then write down the manager’s name, the 
dealership’s name, the manager’s phone number, and his estimate of what he 
would sell your car for. If your car is really mint and you have good photos, 
pay a personal visit to the dealership. The photos will help you get a higher 
estimated value.
Next, average those three estimates and any newspaper prices to come up 
with your own estimate of your car’s preaccident value. Then sit on it. When 
the adjuster makes you an offer, if it’s equal to or greater than your average 
estimate, smile at your good fortune. If the offer is less than yours, pull out 
your information and insist that he either accept your number or, at the very 
least, average your number with his. If he balks at that, enlist the aid of your 
insurance agent.
Keeping your car after it’s been totaled
Suppose you have a nice car. It’s your baby. 
You’ve cared for it, maintained it, changed 
the oil every 3,000 miles. It’s been a great car. 
Suddenly, it’s in an accident. The front end 
is banged up and needs new parts. It can be 
repaired and be as good as new, but your 
insurance company won’t pay for repairs. The 
insurer is calling it a total loss and offering you 
$5,300 for your baby. You protest, but the repair 
estimate is $5,800 — plus possible hidden 
damage. You’re heartbroken. Is there anything 
you can do?
Yes, even though the insurance company won’t 
generally volunteer this fact: You can accept 
the $5,300 (less your deductible) and keep the 
car by paying the insurance company what it 
would have received from the salvage yard 
(say, $500). You now still own your banged-up 
car and have $4,800 you can use toward repairs. 
You then can either not repair all the damage, 
or do what most people do — find a quality, 
small shop that, with the aid of used parts, can 
probably repair the entire car for $4,800 or less. 
Remember this strategy. It really works!

93
 Chapter 8: Getting What You Deserve for Automobile Claims
 
When you buy a car, you also have to pay sales tax, title fees, and so on. Be 
sure that the insurance company pays you for all those added costs. And 
don’t forget the prorated share of your license plate fee, based on the number 
of months until your plates would have expired.
 
In a total loss situation where the accident was caused by the other driver 
and where your car won’t be repaired, simultaneously file a claim with the 
other driver’s insurance and your own collision coverage. By filing both 
claims, you’ll get two offers for the value of your car, and you can take the 
highest one.
Dealing with Insurance Adjusters
An insurance adjuster is the person empowered by an insurance company to 
investigate your claim, when you file one, and to determine how much you 
are entitled to receive. Not only do adjusters have to determine whether 
you have coverage for your claim, but they also have to work to make sure 
that the repair or replacement costs are reasonable. Finally, they have to 
communicate to you — clearly — the settlement offer and how the offer was 
calculated.
I find that most adjusters do a good job of knowing their coverages and know-
ing how to control costs. When they fall short, it’s most often in one or more 
of the following areas:
When your car is stolen
A stolen car is deemed a total loss if it’s not 
recovered. But the majority of stolen cars are 
recovered, usually with damage. If that hap-
pens to you, remember that, even though your 
car was in a collision, the initial cause of loss 
was theft. Therefore, you will owe your theft 
deductible rather than your collision deductible. 
And the theft deductible is usually lower.
Also, because the insurance company doesn’t 
want to pay you for your car and then have it 
be recovered, the company typically will wait to 
settle as long as three to four weeks. Even if you 
don’t have loss-of-use coverage (car rental), 
because of this added wait, most policies will 
pay something (usually $15 a day) toward your 
cost of renting a car, starting 48 to 72 hours after 
you report the claim. Remember that in case the 
company forgets to offer it to you.

94
Part II: Cars, Boats, RVs, and More: Insuring the Things You Drive 
 
✓ Communicating: Some adjusters don’t explain how they arrive at the 
settlement, which is especially important if it’s less than what you had 
expected. Sometimes adjusters don’t tell policy holders what to do if 
repair shops or contractors won’t honor the adjuster’s estimate, or if 
there’s additional damage that the adjuster missed.
 
✓ Getting an agreed price on an auto repair: Some adjusters just mail 
a repair estimate and a check, putting you in the awkward position of 
having to find a body shop to do the work for that price.
 
✓ Being reachable: Sometimes getting in contact with the adjuster is 
almost impossible, and you aren’t given an alternative way to reach 
someone familiar with the claim, such as the adjuster’s supervisor.
 
 The number-one complaint I get from customers is the amount of phone 
tag they have to play to reach adjusters. You can eliminate most of that 
frustration by getting the following information the first time you con-
tact the adjuster:
 
• Claim number
 
• Date of the accident
 
• Adjuster’s name and phone number(s)
 
• Name and phone number(s) of the adjuster’s supervisor
 
 Don’t hesitate to call the adjuster’s supervisor if you need to reach 
someone right away or if you’re having a problem with the adjuster.
 
Here are some things you can do to make your claim go more smoothly:
 
✓ Request the direct-dial phone numbers for the adjuster and the adjus-
tor’s supervisor when the adjuster first contacts you.
 
✓ Never accept payment for any auto repairs without the adjuster and 
your body shop agreeing to a price.
 
✓ If you can’t reach the adjuster, or you aren’t unhappy with her for any 
reason, call her supervisor.
 
✓ If you don’t think the adjuster is doing a good job, call the supervisor 
or even the claims manager and request that she reassign your file to 
another adjuster. You don’t have to accept poor performance.
 
✓ If you have an agent, don’t hesitate to ask for help with any kind of 
problem that you’re having, especially if you feel the settlement offer 
is too low. A good agent has the skills to negotiate, on your behalf, to 
improve an unfair settlement offer.

95
 Chapter 8: Getting What You Deserve for Automobile Claims
Resolving Claim Disputes
If your auto damage claim is unjustly denied, go to your agent for help. Many 
agents have the expertise and skills to be an effective advocate for your 
rights, and they often succeed in getting claims paid. If that fails, you can 
mediate, arbitrate, file a complaint with your state insurance department, 
or even sue your insurance company. (See Chapter 14 for more on those 
options.)
But what if the adjuster agrees that you’re covered but disputes the amount 
of your claim? Fortunately, your policy has a simple, inexpensive solution 
built into the policy provisions — the appraisal clause.
Virtually every personal policy — auto, home, boat, and so on — contains an 
appraisal clause. Few people know about it, and even fewer people use it. In 
this section, I explain how to use the appraisal clause if you and your insur-
ance company don’t agree on how much your claim is worth.
 
Use the appraisal clause only after the best attempts of you and your agent to 
settle the claim for a fair amount have failed.
Either you or your insurance company may request an appraisal if you fail 
to agree on the dollar value of a covered claim. If you’re requesting one, you 
simply send the insurance company a letter with your request.
Each party picks an appraiser to represent his position. The two appraisers 
independently choose a disinterested umpire to resolve things if the two 
appraisers can’t reach an agreement. Each party pays for his own appraiser 
and splits other appraisal expenses (including the umpire’s cost, if needed).
The good news is that you aren’t forced to accept the insurance company’s 
offer. Also, the process is considerably cheaper and faster than lawsuits or 
arbitration.
 
For most property valuation disputes, you don’t need an elaborate group of 
three solemn judges. You just need a fair, unbiased, and disinterested person 
with excellent knowledge regarding the subject of the dispute — someone 
both parties are comfortable with — to act as the umpire. Both parties agree 
to abide by the umpire’s decision.

omeowner’s insurance policies are outstanding values — they offer 
tremendous amounts of coverage for very little money. But they’re 
also, in my opinion, the most dangerous personal policies you can buy, 
because they have the largest number of exclusions and limitations.
When you’re buying homeowner’s insurance, you have to figure out which 
risks you’re exposed to that fall outside the basic box of coverage. Then you 
can develop a strategy for dealing with those risks.
 
Most people make the mistake of shopping for their insurance based on price 
alone. What they usually end up with is the wrong coverage for a cheaper 
price! (See Chapter 4 for more on the right way to buy insurance.)
To buy the homeowner’s insurance you need, first you have to understand 
something about the basic homeowner’s policy. In this chapter, I explain the 
fundamentals of homeowner’s insurance. In Chapters 10 and 11, I show you 
the different types of coverage gaps and how to protect yourself from them.

Part III: Home Sweet Home: Understanding Homeowner’s Insurance 
Introducing the Six Parts of 
a Homeowner’s Policy
All homeowner’s policies have six major coverage parts:
 
✓ Coverage A: Covers damage to or destruction of your residence. (Note: 
This coverage does not apply to renter’s insurance policies.)
 
✓ Coverage B: Covers damage to or destruction of detached structures. 
(Note: This coverage does not apply to renter’s insurance policies.)
 
✓ Coverage C: Covers damage to, destruction of, or theft of personal prop-
erty anywhere in the world.
 
✓ Coverage D: Covers the added living costs you incur as a result of a loss 
covered by Coverage A, Coverage B, or Coverage C (such as lodging and 
meals).
 
✓ Coverage E: Covers non-vehicle personal liability for injuries and prop-
erty damage at home and anywhere else in the world.
 
✓ Coverage F: Covers medical payments to guests injured on your prem-
ises, regardless of fault.
In the following sections, I fill you in on each of these six coverages.
Note: When I refer to homeowner’s insurance, I also mean renter’s insurance 
(except for Coverage A and Coverage B, which don’t apply to renters).
Coverage A: Insuring your home
If you arrange the coverage on your residence properly, the insurance 
company fully repairs or replaces your home if it’s damaged or destroyed 
by a covered cause of loss — such as a fire, tornado, or whatever your 
policy happens to cover.
 
If you insure your home for less than its full replacement cost, you need to be 
aware of two possible claims penalties:

101
 Chapter 9: Understanding the Basics of Homeowner’s and Renter’s Insurance
 
✓ The first penalty occurs if you are under-insured for a total loss (the 
complete destruction of your home). Say your home — which you 
bought five years ago and insured for $275,000 — burns to the ground. 
The cost to rebuild that house in today’s market is $350,000. Because you 
insured the house for $275,000, you suffer an out-of-pocket loss of $75,000.
 
✓ The second penalty for under-insurance occurs when your home is 
partially damaged. Say you purchased a beautiful, hundred-year-old, 
two-story home for $300,000 a decade ago. You insure it for $250,000 — 
the purchase price of $300,000 less the $50,000 lot value. Were you to 
build this home new today, it would cost you $500,000. Let’s assume that 
you have a kitchen fire with extensive smoke and water damage, and 
that the total cost to repair your home is $150,000. Your insurance 
company pays you $100,000. You’re out $50,000! Why?
 
 The vast majority of homeowner’s policies will only pay the full cost 
to replace partial damage to your home if you insure your home for at 
least 80 percent or more of the cost to rebuild new. If you insure your 
home for less than 80 percent of the home’s full replacement cost, your 
claim settlement will be depreciated. On older homes, that may reduce 
your claim settlement by 35 percent or more. In this example, the cost 
to completely rebuild your 100-year-old home isn’t the $250,000 you 
insured your home for, but $500,000. Because $250,000 is far less than 
80 percent of $500,000, your settlement will be depreciated.
 
 Translated into English, the policy essentially says that if you insure 
your home for its depreciated market value (in this case, $250,000), the 
insurance company settles with you on a depreciated basis at claim 
time. The $50,000 penalty in this example represents the amount of 
depreciation deducted from the repair costs.
 
 If, on the other hand, you insure your home for its cost to build new (or 
at least 80 percent of that value, according to the formula in the policy), 
the insurance company settles your claim for the full replacement cost 
of the damage — up to your policy limit.
 
Always insure for 100 percent of the estimated new replacement cost. Paying 
the extra premium is far easier than facing thousands of dollars in losses out-
of-pocket at claim time from either not having enough insurance to rebuild if 
your home is destroyed or having your repair costs substantially depreciated 
on partial losses.
Also, add a home replacement guarantee, if it’s available. (See “Guaranteeing 
you’ll have enough insurance to rebuild,” later in this chapter, for more 
information.)

102
Part III: Home Sweet Home: Understanding Homeowner’s Insurance 
Coverage B: Insuring detached 
structures (garages, barns, 
swimming pools, and more)
Virtually all homeowner’s policies extend 10 percent of Coverage A — the 
residence coverage — to detached structures. In other words, if your home 
is insured for $200,000, you’ve got up to $20,000 worth of coverage for 
any detached structure — for no additional charge. Examples of detached 
structures include garages, pole barns, in-ground swimming pools, decks, 
and fences. (Always check your policy to see what’s counted as a detached 
structure — policies vary.)
 
The Coverage B coverage for detached structure has two pitfalls:
 
✓ The possibility of under-insurance: If the structure can’t be replaced for 
the 10 percent automatic coverage you get under Coverage A, and that’s 
all the coverage you have, you could be left holding the bag.
 
 Make sure your detached structure limit equals the total replacement 
value of all detached structures on your premises.
 
✓ The business exclusion: Many insurance companies exclude any 
detached structure used even partially for business.
Here’s an example from my own files that illustrates both pitfalls: Bob and 
Bobbie have a home insured for $150,000. They have a four-car, detached 
garage with an upstairs loft. If they were to build this garage new today, it 
would cost them $35,000. They have automatic coverage from their home-
owner’s policy that covers their house in the amount of $15,000 (10 percent 
of $150,000). To be properly insured, they have to buy an additional $20,000 
of detached-structure coverage (Coverage B) to bring their total coverage to 
$35,000.
In addition, Bob is self-employed — he owns and manages several rental 
properties. The detached garage, besides storing vehicles, also houses busi-
ness equipment like lawn mowers, snowblowers, and so on. Plus, his busi-
ness office is located upstairs in the loft portion of the detached garage.
Now, what if a tornado comes through destroying their $35,000 garage? 
Because they bought the extra $20,000 coverage, they do have $35,000 of 
insurance. The adjuster shows up with a $35,000 check the next day, right? 
Wrong. Because Bob stored business equipment in their garage, the insur-
ance company could deny their entire claim.

103
 Chapter 9: Understanding the Basics of Homeowner’s and Renter’s Insurance
This situation certainly doesn’t seem fair, but it’s how the coverage often 
works. The equipment had nothing to do with causing the destruction of the 
garage. Yet, all the insurance company has to prove to deny the claim is that 
the garage was even partially used for business purposes.
 
If you have a detached structure on your home premises that is even remotely 
used for business other than for storing business vehicles, you must find out 
if your policy has this business use exclusion. If so, be sure to request an 
endorsement to your homeowner’s policy that permits that business use.
Coverage C: Insuring your belongings
Two ways exist to value personal belongings for insurance purposes: actual 
cash value (used) and replacement cost (new).
 
Buy the replacement cost option! It’s generally only about 10 percent more 
expensive but you’ll receive 30 percent to 40 percent more at claim time. If the 
total cost of replacing your belongings after a major loss is $100,000, with 
Excusing the exclusions
I’m often asked why there are so many prop-
erty exclusions and limitations in homeowner’s 
policies. One reason is fairness. Remember: 
Insurance is just a mechanism where people 
facing similar risks pool resources (pay premi-
ums) into a large pot (the insurance company). 
It’s from that pot that compensation for dam-
ages from fires, thefts, lawsuits, and so on is 
paid. Insurance companies don’t pay claims, 
really — we do, with our premiums. The insurer 
is simply a middleman. The company collects 
money from those of us who don’t have losses 
and redistributes it to those who do.
It’s important that people who share losses be 
similar in the risks they face. That way, people 
with greater risks than the norm aren’t being 
subsidized by those with normal residential 
risks. For example, people with vast amounts of 
jewelry have considerably more jewelry claims 
than the usual homeowner. If jewelry cover-
age were unrestricted in the policy, the rates 
for non-jewelry owners would go up every time 
the jewelry owner lost or had another piece 
stolen.
Contrary to public perception, then, these exclu-
sions and limitations are not in the policy to be 
nasty. They’re there primarily to make sure that 
the premiums will be fair to all payers. Most of 
what is limited or excluded in the basic policy 
can be insured for an extra charge.
Remember: Read your policy to find out what is 
limited or excluded, before a serious loss hap-
pens, so that you can properly modify the policy 
to cover those things that otherwise would not 
be covered.

104
Part III: Home Sweet Home: Understanding Homeowner’s Insurance 
replacement cost coverage, you’ll get $100,000 (minus your deductible). With 
actual cash value coverage, you’ll probably get anywhere from $60,000 to 
$70,000, after deducting depreciation. Believe me, at claim time you’ll be glad 
you bought the better coverage.
One requirement of the replacement cost coverage is that you actually do 
replace the damaged or stolen property. Until you do replace it, the insur-
ance company only pays you the depreciated or used value.
For residence owners, the basic homeowner’s policy comes standard with 
personal property coverage of 50 percent to 75 percent of your Coverage 
A building limit. (The exact percentage varies, depending on the insurance 
company.) If you have a lot of high-end personal property, the automatic cov-
erage provided under the homeowner’s policy may not be enough.
 
Be sure you evaluate the contents-coverage limit on your policy and custom-
ize it to your needs. Don’t just take what comes automatically with your 
policy — it may not be enough. (Later in this chapter, I give you some tools 
to help estimate what your belongings are worth.)
Coverage D: Insuring additional 
living expenses
Your house is blown away by a tornado. Even your kitchen sink is in the next 
county. You check into a motel and call your insurance agent. You’ll need a 
place to live until you rebuild. You’ll need to eat your meals out. You’ll need 
a daily massage to soothe your shattered nerves. But you won’t have much in 
the way of utility bills. And you won’t be buying any groceries. Some of your 
living expenses will go way up. Others will shrink. The difference between the 
two expenses — the additional living expense — is covered by Coverage D.
This helpful coverage pays the additional — not the total — expenses you 
have to incur for lodging, meals, utilities, and so on as a result of a covered 
loss (such as a fire, smoke, or windstorm) that causes you to vacate your 
home. It usually will pay these costs for up to the policy limit, if any, or 12 
months, whichever is exhausted first. With some insurers, the benefit is 
unlimited (always a plus); with others, the benefit is a percentage of the 
Coverage A building limit.
 
Though higher limits are available, the odds of exhausting the base benefit are 
really slim, so almost no one buys more.

105
 Chapter 9: Understanding the Basics of Homeowner’s and Renter’s Insurance
Coverage E: Insuring your 
personal liability
Though the cost of coverage for your personal liability for injuries and 
property damage that you cause represents a small part of your total home-
owner’s bill, in my opinion this is just about the most important coverage 
in the policy. Why? Because it covers lawsuits and the cost of defending 
against lawsuits, and because it’s so comprehensive, covering most of your 
non-vehicle personal liability worldwide.
Here are some examples of claims that Coverage E would cover, including 
some from my own files:
 
✓ Your 6-year-old spills red punch on the neighbor’s white carpet, which 
requires a $3,000 carpet replacement.
 
✓ You get sued by a neighbor who, in spite of your repeated warnings, has 
allowed his child to climb your fence and harass your German shepherd. 
The child gets bitten, and you get sued.
 
✓ Your riding lawnmower kicks up a rock, hits a neighbor, and injures her.
 
✓ A child is hurt while you’re babysitting her.
 
✓ In a baseball game, your teenage son throws errantly to home plate 
and hits another player in the face, causing a loss of vision. That player 
grows older, still suffers from a loss of vision, and sues five years later 
for $100,000.
 
✓ You hit someone in the face playing racquetball.
 
✓ You’re snowboarding and collide accidentally with a skier who sues for 
injuries.
 
✓ Playing golf, your errant tee shot hits a bystander in the head. (Happens 
to me all the time.)
The bottom line? Coverage E is great coverage! Most homeowner’s policies 
include the first $100,000 of coverage at no extra charge.
 
The two biggest mistakes I see people make with Coverage E is not buying 
more than the $100,000 of free coverage, and not setting their personal liabil-
ity limits to match their other liability policy limits (on cars, cabins, boats, 
and so on).
 
You don’t know where the lawsuit may come from, so you want the same 
amount of coverage protecting you no matter where it comes from. You 
wouldn’t want different liability limits for different policies any more than 
you’d want different liability limits for different days of the week!

106
Part III: Home Sweet Home: Understanding Homeowner’s Insurance 
 
How much liability coverage should you buy? Here are some considerations:
 
✓ Your suability factor: How suable you are is affected by the size of 
your bank account, your income, your future income, and your asset 
prospects (in other words, inheritances). In short, your suability factor 
represents how likely it is that an attorney for the person you injure 
will come after you personally if you don’t have enough insurance. (See 
Chapter 5 for more on suability.)
 
✓ Your comfort zone: How high do you need the limits to go for your own 
peace of mind?
 
✓ Your sense of moral responsibility: Many people with a modest income 
and few assets buy high liability limits to be sure that anyone they may 
hurt gets provided for. If you’re one of these thoughtful people, I tip my 
hat in admiration and respect.
The insurance cost of higher limits is minimal. Additional liability insurance 
is truly one of the best values in the insurance business. An extra $200,000 
costs only about $15 a year; an extra $400,000, only about $25 a year!
 
So, how much liability coverage should you buy? Here’s my bottom line advice 
regarding liability limits: Choose a liability limit that considers your current 
and future assets and income, feels emotionally comfortable, satisfies your 
sense of moral responsibility to others, and matches what you would expect if 
you were the one suing. Bottom line: In my opinion, anyone with less than 
$500,000 liability coverage is under-insured. Most people should have limits of 
$1 million or more.
 
Whatever limit you decide on, be sure to adjust your auto, boat, and personal 
liability limits to match.
Coverage F: Insuring your 
guests’ medical bills
This is the sixth and final (and least important) homeowner’s coverage part. 
Let me start with what this is not: It is not health insurance for you or your 
family. Instead, it’s what I call good neighbor coverage. If a guest gets hurt on 
your premises, even if the injury is caused by her own carelessness, this cov-

You can increase the limit for an extra premium, but I would save your money. 
Odds are, most of the people you invite into your home have health insurance 
already. If they’re seriously hurt and may sue, your personal liability coverage 
responds. Just be aware that you have this coverage if you have an injured 
guest. As I said, good neighbor coverage.
Choosing the Right Homeowner’s 
Property Coverages
Coverages A, B, C, and D of homeowner’s policies cover property damage to 
your dwelling, detached structures and their contents, and any increase in 
living expenses related to property damage. That’s how homeowner’s poli-
cies are similar.
How they differ is in the kinds of losses they cover. All homeowner’s policies 
cover damage from fire or a windstorm, for example. But only some policies 
cover water damage from cracked plumbing or toilet overflows. And none 
automatically covers damage from a flood or an earthquake, though both 
coverages can be purchased.
To choose the homeowner’s policy best suited to your needs, you need to 
know which causes of loss are covered and which are not.
Understanding the causes-of-loss options: 
Basic, broad, and special
When you have a homeowner’s claim for damage to your property, the first 
question is, “Was the cause of the damage covered by the policy?” If “yes,” 
your claim is paid. If “no,” your claim is denied. Most insurance companies 
offer three choices for the types of losses covered:
 
✓ Basic form causes of loss: Very limited coverage. Limited to a handful of 
covered causes of loss, including fire, wind, vandalism, and very limited 
theft. This option is rarely sold or purchased anymore.
 
✓ Broad form causes of loss: Covers about 15 causes of loss. From my 
experience, the vast majority of the kinds of loss that damage a home or 
contents are covered. If you have a loss that’s on the list, you’re prob-
ably covered. If the cause of the loss isn’t on the list, you’re probably 
not covered.

108
Part III: Home Sweet Home: Understanding Homeowner’s Insurance 
 
✓ Special form causes of loss: The best. Covers any accidental cause of 
loss unless that cause of loss is specifically excluded. (Damage from 
floods, groundwater, sewer backup, earthquakes, and a few other causes 
of loss aren’t covered.)
Here are some examples, many from my own experience, of losses not 
included in the broad form list that are covered by the special form:
 
✓ Massive interior water damage from roof leaks to a town house: Claim 
of $30,000 paid.
 
✓ Interior damage to ceilings and walls caused by melting ice and snow 
that backed up under the shingles: Claims have averaged $4,000 to 
$10,000.
 
✓ Scorched counters or floors from hot pans dropped onto them: Claims 
to replace counters and floors run $5,000 or more.
 
✓ Paint spills on furniture: The average claim runs $2,000.
 
✓ Spills of any liquids on oriental rugs: Claims to replace rugs range from 
$600 to $20,000.
Probably the most unusual example I’ve heard of involved someone who took 
a month-long winter vacation in Florida. To keep his pipes from freezing back 
home in the cold North, he set his thermostat at 50°F (10°C). Shortly after he 
left home, the thermostat malfunctioned and never shut off. The combina-
tion of 90°F (32°C) heat and winter dryness warped all the floorboards in the 
house, requiring all the flooring to be torn up and replaced. Most of the floor 
coverings — tile, carpet, and so on — which had to be removed to get at the 
floor, also had to be replaced. If that loss happened today, the claim could 
easily be in excess of $75,000.
Neither “thermostat malfunction” nor “excessive heat” is on the list of covered 
losses on the broad form. But the special form covered the loss in full because 
“thermostat malfunction” is not on the list of exclusions. The annual extra 
insurance cost for the special form over the broad form? Probably $75 a year. 
(I’d say the homeowner with the faulty thermostat got his money’s worth!)
 
I flat out suggest that you not buy the basic form coverage — it’s way too 
restrictive. I like broad form coverage because the majority of your losses will 
be covered. But my favorite is the special form, because it puts you in the 
driver’s seat — no matter how bizarre the cause, from Martian invasions to 
some kind of damage from new cybertechnology, your loss is covered (unless 
it’s specifically excluded).

Introducing the six most common 
homeowner’s policies
If you looked at a typical menu of homeowner’s policies available from most 
insurance companies, you would see six entrees, ranging from light fare to a 
full-course meal. Each of these six options is referred to as a form. One form 
is designed specifically for renters, one is specifically for town house or con-
dominium owners, and the other four are for owners of private residences.
Table 9-1 shows the six homeowner’s forms most commonly used in the 
industry, the type of buyer they’re designed for, and the causes of loss cov-
ered under each (basic, broad, or special).

To choose the homeowner’s form best for you, first determine what type of 
buyer you are — homeowner, renter, or town house/condominium owner. 
Then determine the causes of loss you want covered — basic, broad, or 
special — for the building and again for the contents.
For example, if you rent, you would choose homeowner’s form 4. It comes 
automatically with broad form coverage. You can buy the special form for an 
extra charge. If you’re a homeowner and you want special form coverage on 
your structures but you’re comfortable with broad form coverage on belong-
ings, you would choose homeowner’s Form 3.
 
Which form do most insurers sell and 90 percent of homeowner’s buy? Form 3, 
covering buildings with the special form and contents with the broad form. 
The logic behind this decision is that the structure is the biggest property risk, 
and totally exposed to the elements, whereas most contents are more pro-
tected by being inside. It’s a reasonable argument. I think Form 3 is a reason-
able choice for most people.

110
Part III: Home Sweet Home: Understanding Homeowner’s Insurance 
 
If you have expensive personal belongings, fine arts, expensive rugs, paintings, 
or antiques, or if you simply like having the best, special form contents cover-
age is the best choice for you. It’s only about 10 percent more expensive than 
broad form coverage.
Here’s how to get special form coverage for both your home and contents:
 
✓ If you own a home, you have two choices: Buy a homeowner’s Form 5, if 
available, or buy a Form 3 and add a special perils contents endorsement.
 
✓ If you own a town house or condo, buy homeowner’s Form 6, add a 
special perils endorsement to Coverage A (building coverage), and add 
a special perils contents endorsement. (I devote an entire chapter — 
Chapter 12 — to the special needs of town house and condominium 
owners.)
 
✓ If you rent, buy homeowner’s Form 4 and add a special perils contents 
endorsement. (For more on insurance for renters, see the next section.)
Buying Renter’s Insurance
People who buy renter’s insurance (technically homeowner’s Form 4) do so 
when they don’t own the structure they occupy, but they do own the personal 
property in the structure and they’re concerned about that property being 
stolen. Specifically, they’re concerned about their most prized possessions — 
their 52-inch high-definition flat-screen TV, top-of-the-line stereo system, or 
$3,000 customized bicycle. That fear of being ripped off is what draws many 
people to look into buying renter’s insurance. And yes, if they are burglarized 
and have these valuables stolen, there will be coverage.
But renter’s insurance is much more than just theft coverage. The policy has 
all the coverages of a full-fledged homeowner’s policy, except for structural 
coverage. If you have a kitchen fire, and while your place is being restored, 
you have to live elsewhere, you’ll have coverage for additional living 
expenses. If you cause that fire and damage the structure that you’re renting, 
you’re liable for that damage and your liability coverage under the renter’s 
insurance will pay for repairing that damage. The liability coverage also will 
defend you and pay any judgments against you for injuries to guests who fall 
on your newly waxed floor. And often overlooked is that that same renter’s 
liability coverage applies anywhere else, too. For example, it will defend and 
pay any judgment against you caused by injuries you cause in sporting activi-
ties (racquetball, touch football, baseball, tennis, skiing, and so on).

111
 Chapter 9: Understanding the Basics of Homeowner’s and Renter’s Insurance
Valuing your belongings
One of the mistakes most people make when they insure their belongings in a 
renter’s policy is to totally under-insure them. They buy $10,000 or $15,000 of 
coverage but can never replace everything they own for close to that amount.
I recommend that you use the 200 percent method for valuing personal prop-
erty. Total up the replacement value of all your major items — furniture, 
appliances, television, stereo, and so on — and then double that number. 
You’ll end up with an amount high enough to replace all your major posses-
sions and still have an equal amount of money available to replace all your 
other possessions, such as clothing, dishes, silverware, towels, and other 
miscellaneous household items — items that are easy to overlook, but that 
you’ll still need to replace if something happens to them. That amount will 
also be high enough to replace bicycles, ski equipment, and other sporting 
gear, as well as tools.
 
Always buy the optional replacement cost coverage so that, in the event of a 
major loss, the insurance company will pay you enough to replace every-
thing brand-new. Otherwise, you’ll be paid the depreciated value for all your 
possessions — typically 40 percent less.
Evaluating your causes-of-loss options
Homeowner’s Form 4, for renters, automatically includes a broad form 
causes of loss coverage (refer to Table 9-1), but, for a reasonable additional 
fee (typically less than $100 per year), you can change that form to a special 
form so that all losses are covered other than the exclusions. You should 
definitely consider this option if you have a lot of high-end furnishings or 
property you use away from home, such as customized bicycles.
In Chapter 10, I introduce you to the homeowner’s policy coverage limita-
tions and restrictions on certain types of personal property. Be sure to read 
that chapter to see if any of those limitations and restrictions apply to you, 
and follow my recommendations.
Choosing a liability limit
The standard renter’s policy comes with $100,000 of personal liability 
coverage — not nearly enough to cover someone’s serious injuries or loss 
of life that you cause.

112
Part III: Home Sweet Home: Understanding Homeowner’s Insurance 
 
I have two recommendations with regard to personal liability limits:
 
✓ Buy at least $300,000 and ideally $500,000 of coverage. The cost is 
unbelievably cheap — typically $20 to $25 a year!
 
✓ Make sure that you buy the same liability coverage on your renter’s 
policy as you buy for your car insurance liability. Both liability limits 
are protecting the same assets and same income.
 
If you have a high income or the potential for a high income in the next few 
years, I recommend that you consider an umbrella policy (see Chapters 15 
and 16).
Establishing Property Coverage Limits
Insuring your home and contents properly to get the very best payout at 
claim time means insuring both for their full replacement cost. You prob-
ably have a pretty good idea of the market value of your home, but where do 
Giving your college kid a place to live without 
losing the roof over your own head
My client Ken called me one day. His college-
age son, with a couple of friends, was moving 
into an apartment off-campus. The landlord was 
requesting a parent’s signature on the lease to 
guarantee the rent payments. Ken wisely faxed 
me the lease.
If he had cosigned the lease with his son, Ken 
would have not only guaranteed the rent pay-
ments but would also have taken on all the 
other obligations of the lease. For example, if 
his son and his friends had a party in the apart-
ment and someone was badly injured, Ken’s 
assets would have been exposed to lawsuits. 
Similarly, if someone had too much to drink at a 
party and had a car accident seriously injuring 
others on the way home, Ken again could have 
been dragged into a lawsuit.
Ken was not too happy about those possibili-
ties, and I advised him not to sign the lease but 
instead give the landlord a separate document 
that guaranteed that, if the rent payments were 
not made by his son, Ken would take respon-
sibility for them, which is all the landlord was 
really looking for anyway. Avoiding the risk is 
often better than insuring it!
Had Ken already signed the lease, the only way 
to fully protect Ken would have been to extend 
his homeowner’s and umbrella liability policies 
to a second location — namely the college 
apartment. The insurance cost per year to do 
this would have been about $25.

113
 Chapter 9: Understanding the Basics of Homeowner’s and Renter’s Insurance
you find the replacement value? And how in the world do you compute the 
cost of all your furniture, clothing, appliances, and other belongings without 
taking six months off from work and consuming a drawer full of pain-reliever 
for all the headaches you’ll have?
In this section, I give you tools that can help you establish the approximate 
replacement cost of your home and its contents.
Determining the replacement 
cost of your home
The replacement cost of your home is the cost to rebuild it. Most insurance 
companies and/or their agents will estimate the replacement cost of your 
home using a computer program designed for that purpose. But how can you 
be sure their estimate is accurate?
Insuring your home for its replacement cost is important, to avoid serious 
penalties at claim time. But you also don’t want to spend more than you 
need to by over-insuring your home. The most accurate way to estimate 
your home’s replacement cost is to spend $200 to $500 (or more) and have a 
professional appraisal done. But that strategy is tough on the budget. And it 
doesn’t exactly follow the “Keep it simple” principle from Chapter 2.
 
I recommend two strategies to cross-check your agent’s estimate:
 
✓ Double-check the agent’s worksheet. Have the agent send you her 
worksheet. Make sure all the features and square footage are correct. 
Many times the information is not correct. It’s your job to make sure 
that it’s accurate.
 
✓ Use your home mortgage appraisal. If you’ve financed or refinanced 
your home recently, you paid for an appraisal and you’re entitled to a 
copy of it. If you don’t have a copy yet, call your mortgage company and 
request it. True, the appraisal is for market value, not cost new, but in 
almost all appraisals, the appraiser also includes the appraiser’s esti-
mated replacement cost.
 
 Their numbers are typically conservative, so be sure your building 
insurance equals or exceeds the mortgage appraisal’s replacement cost 
estimate. For example, if the insurance agent calculates the cost, new, of 
your home at $278,000 and your bank appraisal estimated it at $262,000, 
I’d be comfortable with the agent’s number. But if your bank appraisal 
estimated the cost, new, at $175,000, I’d make an issue out of that big 
difference. If you send the agent your bank appraisal, I’ll bet you can get 
her to adjust her number downward.

114
Part III: Home Sweet Home: Understanding Homeowner’s Insurance 
I’ve found that the larger and/or more customized your home is, especially 
if it’s an older home, the more likely it is that the insurance company’s esti-
mate is wrong. Determining the replacement cost of your home is a difficult 
process, but definitely worth your time.
 
The replacement cost is what you’re after — not the market value. It might 
cost you a lot more to rebuild your home than you could sell the home for.
Guaranteeing you’ll have enough 
insurance to rebuild
You’ve done your homework. You’ve double-checked your agent’s replace-
ment cost estimate and made appropriate coverage corrections. Suddenly, 
your home burns to the ground. You’ve insured your home for $258,000, 
but after the fire, the true cost to haul all the debris and rebuild is $292,000. 
You tried your best to buy the right coverage but your out-of-pocket loss is 
$34,000! Good news! This problem has a great solution — an optional home 
replacement guarantee, usually called extended replacement cost coverage.
 
Extended replacement cost coverage has three requirements you must 
comply with in order for the guarantee to be honored at claim time:
 
✓ You initially insure your home for 100 percent of its estimated replace-
ment cost as determined by your agent or insurance company (with 
your input, of course — see the preceding section).
 
✓ You agree to an inflation rider that annually adjusts your coverage limit 
by the construction cost index for new homes in your area and you pay 
the premium increase each year.
 
✓ You notify your insurer anytime you spend $5,000 or more in structural 
improvements and agree to the change in coverage and higher premium 
that results.
 
Be careful. Many people forget about the third requirement, which voids their 
guarantee. However, spending $5,000 or more is reportable only if it makes 
your home more expensive to rebuild new. Examples of expenditures that do 
not void your guarantee are replacing worn-out items like roofs or heating and 
cooling equipment, or cosmetic changes to your home that increase your 
enjoyment and probably increase the market value, but don’t affect the 
replacement cost at all (such as replacing kitchen cabinets or stripping off 
wallpaper and repainting walls with contemporary colors).

115
 Chapter 9: Understanding the Basics of Homeowner’s and Renter’s Insurance
As a result of the lessons of Hurricane Andrew, many insurers have capped 
their home replacement guarantee (usually 125 percent of your building cov-
erage). Unlimited coverage, though, is still very available. I like the unlimited 
coverage, especially if you have an older home where the exact replacement 
cost is difficult to determine.
 
When insuring your home, always double-check the insurance agent’s replace-
ment cost estimate so you don’t over-insure your home and, thus, pay too 
much for your insurance. And always buy the optional extended replacement 
cost coverage, without a cap if possible.
Estimating the cost to replace belongings
The most accurate way to determine the cost of replacing all your belongings 
is to take a full inventory of everything that you own. No one does that — 
but there are two methods that can get you close enough, whether you own 
or rent.
The 200 percent method
 
I like this method and use it a lot because you can do it in 30 minutes or less:
 
1. Add up the estimated new cost for all the major items in your home — 
furniture, stereo, TVs, appliances, computers, and so on.
 
2. Double the total.
 
 This will insure that you not only have enough coverage to replace all 
the major items you own, but that you have an equal amount available 
for all the smaller items — clothing, dishes, linens, athletic equipment, 
seasonal and stored items, and so on.
 
3. Add to that the values of any exceptional property or collections, art-
work, tools, home workshops, and so on.
Keep it fast and simple. Use your best guess on values, or it won’t get done.
The percent of building-value method (for homeowners only)
Oddly, the vast majority of homeowner’s insurance buyers accept the 
amount of contents coverage that comes with their homeowner’s policy (usu-
ally 70 percent of the building-coverage value). Why? Partly because it’s easy, 
and partly because most people have no idea of the significant value of prop-
erty they’ve accumulated over the years.

116
Part III: Home Sweet Home: Understanding Homeowner’s Insurance 
 
If you accept the percent of building-value method as a means of determining 
the amount of content coverage you have, make one modification. Inflate your 
contents limit by the value of any exceptional property: fine arts, collectibles, 
antiques, tools, and so on.
 
Don’t accept as gospel the estimates of others when they value your property, 
and don’t automatically accept the stock coverage that comes with your 
policy.
Choosing your deductible
The usual deductible that comes with a homeowner’s policy is $250 per 
claim. Most insurers allow you to increase the deductible to $500, $1,000, or 
more, in exchange for a lower premium. When deciding how big a deductible 
to carry, use three criteria:
 
✓ How much can you comfortably afford, financially, out of cash reserves?
 
✓ How much can you emotionally afford? (If parting with that much of a 
deductible would bring on tears, it’s too high!)
 
✓ How much premium credit are you receiving for taking the extra risk?
 
It’s been my experience that the average home property claim typically occurs 
once every seven to ten years. My advice is to pick the deductible that has a 
seven- or eight-year payback period. Here’s how to determine the payback 
period:
 
1. Subtract the lower deductible from the higher deductible.
 
2. Subtract the lower premium from the higher premium.
 
3. Divide the number in Step 1 by the number in Step 2.
 
 If the result is 8 or less (meaning that you’ll recoup your added risk in 
eight years less), pick the higher deductible.
Documenting Your Claim
Suppose your house burns to the ground, along with every shred of your 
belongings. Or suppose you come home to an empty house after that cheap 
moving company steals most of your furniture. What do you do?

117
 Chapter 9: Understanding the Basics of Homeowner’s and Renter’s Insurance
“No problem,” you say. “I read Insurance For Dummies, and I bought all the 
right coverages. The replacement cost on building and contents. The home 
replacement guarantee. The special causes-of-loss form. I’m set.” Here’s the 
catch: Without documentation, even great coverage won’t get you an easy — 
or full — claim settlement.
 
Here are some easy ways of documenting your home and its contents:
 
✓ Take photos of the exterior of the house and any detached structures.
 
✓ Take photos of any special structural features in the interior, like stone 
fireplaces, built-in buffets, custom woodwork, and so on.
Reducing your risk
Here is a list of things you can do to reduce risk, 
to reduce the chances of having a claim at all, 
and to reduce the severity of any claim you do 
have. You can save on your insurance premi-
ums by putting some of these tips into effect.
 ✓ Install a UL-approved smoke detector on 
each floor. Replace the batteries yearly. 
(Doing it on your birthday is an easy way to 
remember.)
 ✓ Install a UL-approved dry-chemical fire 
extinguisher in the kitchen for grease fires. 
Check it periodically to make sure it’s fully 
charged.
 ✓ Install dead-bolt locks on all access doors.
 ✓ Install a motion-detector alarm.
 ✓ Install a central burglar-and-fire alarm (the 
premium savings are huge for this one — 
10 percent to 20 percent).
 ✓ Have your fireplace, flues, and chimney 
cleaned regularly to prevent chimney fires 
(and all the horrible interior smoke damage 
that results).
 ✓ If you want a wood stove, buy a UL-approved 
one and have it professionally installed. 
Don’t leave it unattended. Have it profes-
sionally cleaned annually.
 ✓ Change your locks immediately if your purse 
or keys are ever stolen.
 ✓ Install a sump-pump system to prevent 
damage from groundwater, which is 
excluded by virtually every homeowner’s 
policy. (Be sure to buy optional sump-pump 
failure coverage.)
 ✓ Keep trees trimmed so they’re safely away 
from the house.
 ✓ Keep walkways clear and safe.
 ✓ If you have a swimming pool, make sure 
it’s surrounded by an approved fence. Take 
out the diving board (where most injuries 
occur). Add a locking pool cover to prevent 
unauthorized use.
 ✓ Buy your kids membership to a health club 
offering a supervised trampoline instead of 
buying a trampoline yourself, to avoid all the 
potential liability for injuries to the neighbor 
kids.
 ✓ Install a carbon monoxide detector.

118
Part III: Home Sweet Home: Understanding Homeowner’s Insurance 
 
✓ Take a photographic inventory of all your personal property. Take 
pictures of every cupboard and closet with the drawers open. Don’t 
forget storage areas, the basement, and property in garages and other 
structures.
 
✓ Keep your home blueprints, if you have any. They’re wonderful for 
making sure you get exactly the house you had. (It wouldn’t hurt to put 
a copy of your home appraisal and photos with the blueprints.)
 
Having photos, blueprints, and other documentation won’t help at all if they 
burn up in the fire. So be sure to keep them off premises.

A
ll homeowner’s insurance policies provide coverage for personal prop-
erty. Pricing for the coverage has two components:
 
✓ Base premium: The base premium is designed to provide coverage for 
the types of low-hazard property common to everyone — furniture, 
clothing, appliances, electronics, and so on.
 
✓ Supplemental premiums: Supplemental premiums are designed to cover 
higher-hazard property not covered much or at all by the base policy — 
such as jewelry, silver, boats, and business equipment.
The good news is that this dual pricing is fair; people with only low-hazard 
property don’t pay extra to subsidize those with high-hazard property. The 
bad news is that consumers with high-hazard property often naively just 
buy the basic homeowner’s policy, off-the-shelf, without customizing the 
coverage — so their high-hazard property is either poorly insured or com-
pletely uninsured.
In this chapter, I fill you in on the types of personal property not covered well 
by the basic homeowner’s insurance policy. I also show you creative ways of 
getting the best coverage for your money.
 
Most of my advice is based on the coverages and limitations found in the vast 
majority of policies, but there are differences from one company to another. 
Be sure to read your homeowner’s insurance policy and, ideally, discuss it 
with a professional.

120
Part III: Home Sweet Home: Understanding Homeowner’s Insurance 
Exposing the Three Major Coverage Gaps
You have homeowner’s insurance, so all your stuff is covered, right? 
Unfortunately, no. There are three reasons that some of your personal prop-
erty may have little or no homeowner’s coverage:
 
✓ The basic policy sets a dollar limit on that type of property.
 
✓ Certain causes of loss are excluded.
 
✓ The property is unique and difficult to put a value on.
Here’s a personal example that illustrates all three problems: My bride of 30 
years, Judith Marie, owns a top-quality, half-carat, solitaire diamond engage-
ment ring, worth — today — about $4,000. Our basic homeowner’s policy 
(without any customization), has a $1,000 limit on jewelry theft (the dollar 
limit). In addition, the policy has an exclusion for any loss of the stone from 
its setting (the excluded cause of loss). Finally, even if $4,000 of coverage were 
available, the burden of proof rests with my wife and me to prove the qual-
ity and value of the ring in order to be paid that value (making it unique and 
difficult to value). Can you imagine how difficult that would be? Depending 
on quality, a half-carat diamond is worth from $1,000 to $10,000. How would 
you prove to an adjuster your diamond’s quality if the ring or the diamond is 
gone? A photo can’t. A bill of sale can’t.
Dollar limits
In the Coverage C section of your homeowner’s policy — the section cover-
ing personal property — you can find a list of property subject to limitations. 
It should look something like this partial list:
 
✓ Theft of jewelry: $1,000
 
✓ Theft of silver: $2,500
 
✓ Theft of guns: $2,000
 
✓ Damage to or theft of coins: $250
 
✓ Damage to or theft of stamps: $500
 
✓ Damage to or theft of boats, motors, and trailers: $1,000
 
If you don’t want to be a victim of the personal property coverage limitations 
of your homeowner’s policy, reading the list in your policy is imperative. 
Almost all the limitations can be eliminated for an extra premium charge.

121
 Chapter 10: Avoiding Homeowner’s Personal Property Pitfalls
Excluded causes of loss
Damage to or loss of your personal property may not be covered for two 
reasons:
 
✓ The cause is specifically excluded from coverage in the policy lan-
guage. For example, your policy may have a loss-of-stone exclusion for 
jewelry, excluding coverage for a stone that slips from its setting.
 
✓ The cause is not in the list of covered causes of loss, if your policy 
contains a basic or broad cause-of-loss form. Under the basic or broad 
form (see Chapter 9 for more information), any loss not appearing on 
the list won’t be covered. So, for example, if you have a paint spill that 
ruins your valuable Persian rug, and “paint spill” isn’t one of the listed, 
covered causes of loss, it wouldn’t be covered.
 
Read your policy to find out which items of your personal property are not 
covered for certain causes of loss so you can use insurance or non-insurance 
strategies to close the gap.
Valuation problems
Even if no dollar limit exists on an item of personal property, and even if the 
cause of your loss is fully covered, a third obstacle to collecting the full value 
of your property is the difficulty in proving the value of it. Antiques, original 
art, and collectibles are examples of items that have this problem. How do 
you prove to the adjuster that your stolen painting was an original Picasso 
and not a copy? How do you prove its value after it’s gone?
Arming Yourself: Successful Strategies 
for Protecting Your Personal Property
So how do you protect yourself from being burned by one of the personal-
property coverage problems common with homeowner’s insurance? In this 
section, I offer up three insurance strategies and one non-insurance strategy 
to help you.

122
Part III: Home Sweet Home: Understanding Homeowner’s Insurance 
Raising your dollar limit
For some personal property with dollar limits, insurers offer you the option 
(for an additional premium) of increasing that dollar limit to a maximum 
value that better suits your needs. It’s quite common, for example, to be able 
to increase your typical jewelry theft limit from $1,000 to $2,500 or $5,000, or 
to increase sterling silver theft limits from $2,500 to $10,000 or $15,000.
Raising dollar limits is not usually an expensive proposition. A $5,000 jewelry 
theft limit, for example, typically costs $25 a year. A $10,000 sterling silver 
theft limit may cost you $50 a year.
 
If the limit you buy adequately covers what you own, this strategy solves the 
dollar-limit problem. It won’t help with the cause-of-loss or valuation prob-
lems, however.
Scheduling your valuables
 
A strategy that addresses all three problems of dollar limit, cause of loss, and 
valuation is to specifically list (or schedule) certain valuables as an amend-
ment to the basic policy. A value for each item is declared and a premium is 
paid. Here’s how this addresses all three problems:
 
✓ The dollar-limit problem is solved by insuring the scheduled valuable for 
its full value.
 
✓ The causes-of-loss problem is solved because almost any cause of acci-
dental loss, no matter how bizarre, is covered (other than a handful of 
exclusions).
 
✓ The valuation problem at claim time for hard-to-value items (such as 
jewelry and fine art) is solved by providing the insurance company with 
credible appraisals at the time the insurance is arranged.
Because scheduling addresses all three problems so well, it’s usually the best 
strategy for many types of valuables — but not always.
The three advantages of scheduling valuables are
 
✓ Having the broadest possible special (everything-is-covered-but-a-few-
exclusions) causes-of-loss coverage
 
✓ Having no deductible
 
✓ A smoother easier claim settlement.

123
 Chapter 10: Avoiding Homeowner’s Personal Property Pitfalls
The disadvantage of scheduling is that you lose inflation coverage if the item 
increases in value. For example, if the particular style of your scheduled 
antique table becomes quite fashionable, and the table’s value skyrockets, you 
only collect the scheduled amount. To solve the inflation problem, you can get 
your items reappraised every year, if you’re willing to go through the hassle 
and the expense. No one — absolutely no one — does so, and neither will you. 
If you’re dealing with personal property that doesn’t have a dollar limit under 
the policy (such as artwork or antiques), you can get around this inflation 
problem without having to get annual appraisals (see the next section).
Buying special perils coverage
A strategy for partially dealing with the problem of excluded causes of loss 
is to expand the covered causes of loss to approximately the same as the 
covered causes of loss under a schedule by buying an optional coverage 
called special perils contents coverage (see Chapter 9). Special perils coverage 
broadens the coverage on all your personal property so that anything that 
accidentally happens to your belongings, no matter how bizarre, is covered 
unless the cause of the loss is one of those specifically excluded (for exam-
ple, a flood, an earthquake, breakage of fragile items, and a few others).
 
If you have a lot of treasures, I recommend adding special perils for its broader 
coverage and also because it usually adds only about 10 percent to your home-
owner’s insurance bill. See Table 10-1 for some examples of how you could 
benefit at claim time with this better coverage (ignoring the deductible).

As you can see, the special perils endorsement won’t solve all your claims 
problems, such as the dollar limit problem. But it surely puts a dent in them.
In the following sections, I tell you about the many types of personal property 
that either have restricted coverage under a basic homeowner’s policy or 
face unique risks that require special handling. I show you how to use these 
insurance and non-insurance strategies to protect yourself.

125
 Chapter 10: Avoiding Homeowner’s Personal Property Pitfalls
Covering Portable Items
Homeowner’s policies do a pretty good job of protecting stationary personal 
property when it’s contained safely within the walls of your home. The most 
common causes of loss — fire, wind, vandalism, and theft — are covered 
even under the most basic of policies. But the homeowner’s coverage falls 
short when it comes to certain types of belongings that you carry with you, 
such as cameras, jewelry, musical instruments, guns, and furs.
Cameras
Cameras and their accessories are a good example of a type of property that’s 
more vulnerable away from home. Because people take them wherever they 
go, cameras are subject to breakage or loss, water damage, and other unusual 
risks not covered by your basic homeowner’s policy. In addition, there is 
almost no coverage for business use — a problem for those who occasionally 
make money from their gear, by filming weddings, for example. Some good 
news: Homeowner’s policies usually have no dollar limit for camera gear.
 
Here’s my advice for managing the risk of photographic equipment:
 
✓ If your investment is modest, retain (self-insure) the losses. In other 
words, just figure that if something happens to your camera, you’ll pay 
to repair it or get a new one.
 
✓ If you own expensive gear but either no longer use it or wouldn’t 
replace it if it were lost, retain any losses yourself.
 
✓ If you own expensive gear and you do want insurance to replace it if 
it’s lost or damaged, buy better coverage than the primary homeown-
er’s policy offers. You can do one of the following:
 
• Specifically insure the camera gear — this is called scheduling it.
 
• Buy the special perils endorsement, which covers all your personal 
property — not just cameras — for more causes-of-loss than the 
basic homeowner’s coverage.
 
 Both of these strategies cover camera gear for any accidental damage, 
unless the cause of loss is one of just a handful of excluded causes. 
Scheduling offers the advantage of having no deductible on claims (see 
the “Scheduling your valuables” section, earlier in this chapter, for more 
information).
 
 If you do schedule, be sure that the values you declare are replacement 
costs new — not used values. Also be sure to add sales tax to the value 
you declare, if applicable where you live.

126
Part III: Home Sweet Home: Understanding Homeowner’s Insurance 
 
If you use your equipment, even occasionally, to make money, the only way 
to cover it is to schedule it. Make sure that you add an endorsement for 
business use.
Jewelry
Besides being portable, personal jewelry has two other unique problems: 
Items are usually small and easily lost, and jewelry often can only be valued 
under a microscope. Jewelry is also subject to two policy limitations;
 
✓ A dollar limit for theft — usually $1,000 per claim — not a limit per item
 
✓ No coverage for the loss of a stone from its setting (a very common 
claim)
 
For managing the dollar limit on theft problem, the strategy of raising the 
dollar limit on jewelry coverage is available from most insurers, usually to a 
limit of $5,000 to $10,000. Insurers vary, but common pitfalls of this strategy 
include
 
✓ No broader causes of loss being covered.
 
✓ A per-piece limit of $1,000 to $1,500.
 
✓ The burden of having to prove the value of what you lost — very dif-
ficult to do with unique jewelry. If you can’t prove what you lost, you’re 
vulnerable to the insurance company replacing what you lost with a 
lesser-quality item or gem.
 
The insurance company normally replaces your gem with another gem, 
instead of cash. This claims practice significantly reduces the number of 
fraudulent claims for “stolen” jewelry.
 
The strategy of scheduling jewelry items works better because
 
✓ Almost every accidental claim — including the loss of the stone or even 
the loss of the entire piece — is covered.
 
✓ There’s no deductible.
 
✓ An appraisal is required to schedule an item, so there’s no dispute over 
what you lost. You simply take the most recent appraisal to the jeweler 
who is doing the replacing. She uses the appraisal to closely match what 
you lost.
The only negative of scheduling, besides the cost and hassle of getting an 
appraisal, is the danger of being under-insured if the value of your jewelry 
increases. You can protect yourself by updating your appraisals and increasing 

127
 Chapter 10: Avoiding Homeowner’s Personal Property Pitfalls
your coverage limit every three to five years. Out of scores of jewelry claims, 
I’ve only had two clients get paid less than the appraised value; in both cases, 
their appraisals were over ten years old.
 
If you’ve had a piece of jewelry insured by the same insurance company since 
the original appraisal was done, you can call the jeweler who did the appraisal 
and request an updated value. You don’t have to prove you still have the 
piece because it has been continuously insured.
The strategy of buying the special-perils causes-of-loss coverage option is 
only partially effective for jewelry. Though it broadens the kinds of loss cov-
ered, it doesn’t help with the dollar-limit problem.
I find non-insurance strategies — avoid, reduce, or retain — very helpful 
when it comes to personal jewelry risks:
 
✓ Avoid the risk for seldom-worn jewelry that you eventually want to pass 
on to your kids. Pass it on now, while you’re still here to enjoy them 
enjoying it — and the risk now belongs to someone else.
 
✓ Retain (self-insure) smaller jewelry items — especially those you won’t 
bother replacing if anything happens to them.
 
✓ Reduce the risk to your jewelry by putting expensive, seldom-worn 
pieces in a safe-deposit box. Reduce the risk of the loss of stones from 
their settings by regularly having the prongs checked.
There usually is no way to transfer the risk to someone other than through 
insurance.
 
The burglary risk is reduced significantly when you install a central burglar 
alarm. Hide expensive pieces to further reduce the risk — the first place the 
burglar looks is in your jewelry box. (My longtime client Mary — God bless 
her — showed me her favorite hiding place: her freezer! Did she microwave 
her jewelry when she wanted to wear it?) If you hide it, don’t forget where you 
hide it. (I’m guilty of that one!)
 
My recommendations for managing your jewelry risks are:
 
✓ Retain the small stuff — especially items you wouldn’t replace.
 
✓ Schedule items worth $1,000 or more — especially those you would 
replace. Don’t forget to add sales tax to the value of the item.
 
✓ Add up the values of the items under $1,000 that you would replace, 
if you want them insured, and then raise the jewelry dollar-limit high 
enough to cover those items, or to the maximum available from the 
insurance company. When you talk to your agent, impress her with the 
technical name for this: blanket unscheduled coverage.

128
Part III: Home Sweet Home: Understanding Homeowner’s Insurance 
 
 Still get appraisals for the unscheduled jewelry items you’re covering 
under the blanket coverage and store the appraisals off-premises. The 
insurance company won’t require an appraisal from you at the time you 
buy the coverage as they will for scheduled items, but being able to 
prove what you lost will greatly enhance your claim settlement.
 
✓ Store pieces you seldom wear — especially heirlooms — in a safe-
deposit box. Insurance can only pay cash. It won’t begin to replace the 
sentimental value of your treasures.
 
✓ If you have a lot of jewelry, reduce the burglary risk by hiding it and/
or adding a central burglar alarm. Consider installing a safe, but be 
sure it’s part of the building (built into the wall or in the floor, covered 
by a rug).
How jewelry claims work
You’ve done all the right things. You obtained 
a quality appraisal from a certified gemolo-
gist on your diamond wedding ring for $4,200, 
which feels good because you only paid $3,200 
for it. You scheduled it for $4,200. You even 
added the sales tax to the value. Six months 
later, the ring is stolen. You’re very happy you 
bought Insurance For Dummies and followed 
my advice — until, that is, you discover that 
the cost to the insurance company, through its 
wholesale connections, to replace this ring is 
only $2,100. You’re outraged! You insured your 
ring for $4,200 and paid an additional premium. 
You want a $4,200 ring. The insurance company 
refuses. Then you demand $4,200 cash. They 
offer $2,100 cash. More outrage!
What can you do? Nothing. Jewelry is appraised 
at retail and settled at wholesale. That’s how 
the system works. Pricing for scheduled jewelry 
is discounted because of this fact.
A few insurance companies sell agreed-
amount jewelry coverage and would pay you 
the $4,200. But those jewelry policies are much 
more expensive.
I actually like the current system. You benefit 
in three ways:
 ✓ Reduced insurance premiums.
 ✓ Reduced fraud, preventing people from 
profiting from a claim (collecting $4,200 
cash for a ring that cost $3,200 six months 
earlier).
 ✓ Some inflation protection. Your $4,200 
ring will increase in value each year. 
But if you’re like most people, you won’t 
get updated appraisals each year. Your 
appraisal won’t need updating more than 
every five years until the $2,100 wholesale 
price has increased in value to match the 
$4,200 insured amount. (If, five years from 
now, the retail value of the ring is $8,400 
and wholesale value is $4,200, you still have 
enough insurance at $4,200.)
You need to know and understand how the 
system works so you won’t be disappointed at 
claim time. Remember: What’s really important 
is that insurance replaces what you lost — and 
it will, up to the scheduled amount.

129
 Chapter 10: Avoiding Homeowner’s Personal Property Pitfalls
Musical instruments
The good news with musical instruments is that homeowner’s policies neither 
contain any dollar limits nor have any added causes of loss excluded. But if 
you own an expensive instrument, it is subject to two coverage pitfalls:
 
✓ No damage or breakage coverage in the basic homeowner’s policy
 
✓ Limited coverage at home and virtually no coverage away from home if 
the instrument is used even partially for business
You can get damage or breakage coverage by either scheduling the item or 
buying the special perils option for all your belongings. Coverage is similar 
under either choice. Scheduling has the advantage of no deductible, a par-
ticularly popular feature with parents of 8-year-olds.
 
If you use your instrument even occasionally for business, the only way to 
avoid the homeowner’s policy dollar limits on business property is to sched-
ule it and add the business-use endorsement.
 
It’s quite common for parents to rent instruments rather than buy them, 
especially for a child’s first instrument. The rental agency requires you to 
insure the rental and offers you insurance on the $800 violin you’re renting — 
typically $4 to $8 a month added to your rental fee. That’s $48 to $96 a year. 
You can schedule the $800 violin under your homeowner’s policy for $4 to $8 
a year! That’s the way to go — always. Be sure to include the rental agency as 
loss payee on the schedule so its interest is properly covered.
Guns
If all you own is a handgun, a standard shotgun, or a hunting rifle, you can 
probably skip this section. The basic homeowner’s policy usually has a dollar 
limit on theft of guns — typically $2,000 to $3,000 — and no added exclu-
sions. Business-use restrictions exist that won’t be addressed here (for detec-
tives, bounty hunters, and mafia hit men), but you can find out about them in 
Hired-Gun Insurance For Dummies.
You’ve got two reasons to buy better gun coverage:
 
✓ You may need to raise the basic dollar limit for theft.
 
✓ You may need broader coverage, especially for guns used recreation-
ally (for example, if you hunt and lose a gun overboard while sitting in a 
duck boat).

130
Part III: Home Sweet Home: Understanding Homeowner’s Insurance 
If you have both needs, scheduling the gun is the best choice. If you don’t 
need broader coverage, just raise the theft limit. If the insurance company’s 
optional limit isn’t high enough, you need to schedule.
I have 400 clients, with almost no gun schedules, and very few increased gun 
limits. Why? Because gun claims rarely occur. And because preventing the 
loss, with a high-quality gun safe, is so effective. By the way, locking guns 
in a safe not only reduces the risk of theft but, more important, keeps your 
children, grandchildren, or anyone else from accessing the guns and hurting 
themselves or others.
 
Many people have elaborate gun collections, often including vintage guns. If 
you fall into this category, here are my recommendations to help improve 
future claim settlements, whether you schedule the guns or just increase the 
limit in your policy:
 
✓ Take good photos of each piece with the name and serial number listed. 
Store a set off-premises to document what you had at the time of your 
claim.
 
✓ Get appraisals on the collectible guns and also store these appraisals 
off-premises.
Furs
If you have valuable furs, you should know that your policy probably has a 
dollar limit for theft of furs included in the jewelry dollar limit of, usually, 
$1,000. That’s a problem if a burglar takes your jewelry and furs in the same 
burglary.
Because most fur thefts occur away from home, preventing the theft risk 
by keeping the fur with you at all times is probably the best strategy. If 
you do still want insurance, I recommend you schedule the item for its full 
value. Besides the increased dollar limit, you’ll also broaden coverage for 
nearly every accidental loss (including tears, stains, dry cleaner damage, 
and so on).
To schedule a fur, you’ll need a furrier appraisal. If you want your claim 
settled for the cost, new, and have purchased replacement cost coverage on 
contents with your basic policy, make sure that the appraisal is for the new 
(not used) value.

131
 Chapter 10: Avoiding Homeowner’s Personal Property Pitfalls
Covering Artwork and Antiques
Because the value of fine art and antiques is based both on authenticity and 
condition, good documentation is essential. Can you imagine owning an origi-
nal Picasso worth $2 million, having no documentation, and trying to get that 
amount from the insurance adjuster after it’s stolen?
Another problem common to fine art and antiques is valuation. Replacing 
this type of property usually isn’t even possible. What is the replacement 
cost of a Picasso? What’s the replacement cost of your antique, hand-carved 
table? Even if it can be replaced with a new, identical table, doesn’t its histori-
cal value often exceed — sometimes far exceed — the value of a new table?
Because replacement cost coverage just doesn’t apply to these types of items, 
most insurance policies now settle these losses for the market value at the 
time of the loss. That’s good news for you. The bad news is that the burden of 
documenting what you have falls entirely on your shoulders. Yet another dif-
ficulty with insuring this kind of property is that the value can increase while 
your coverage remains static, especially if you schedule the items. With each 
passing year, your coverage becomes more and more inadequate.
So, how can you solve the problems of documenting and valuing your fine 
arts and antiques, and still be protected against under-insurance due to infla-
tion? You can choose between two methods of insurance: scheduling or not 
scheduling.
Scheduling is the strategy used and recommended exclusively by the insur-
ance industry for insuring this type of property. It requires you to document 
what you have at the time you insure it by providing a credible appraisal and, 
often, a photograph. The item is then scheduled for the appraised amount 
and an extra premium is charged.
 
Here are the advantages of scheduling your fine art and antiques:
 
✓ The documentation problem is solved in advance of any claim. Items 
in the schedule are valued at their market value.
 
✓ Most insurers — for fine art only — include agreed amount coverage 
(meaning, they pay you the scheduled amount for a theft or total loss 
with no value argument).
 
✓ You have the option to add breakage of glass and other fragile items 
to the schedule. If breakage is a big concern, scheduling the item with 
breakage coverage is the best course of action.

132
Part III: Home Sweet Home: Understanding Homeowner’s Insurance 
 
Scheduling leaves you vulnerable to the inflation problem, unless you’re will-
ing to incur the time, expense, and hassle of new appraisals almost every year. 
Virtually no one is willing to appraise items yearly — and it completely vio-
lates one of the rules of the road in Chapter 2, to keep it simple.
The second insurance strategy is one I devised for my clients in order to 
solve the inflation problem without the hassle and expense of new appraisals. 
It has three parts and works only if your homeowner’s policy has no dollar 
limits on paintings, collectibles, and antiques. Very few homeowner’s policies 
have a dollar limit on these items, but be sure to check yours just in case.
Here are the three parts:
 
✓ Buy the optional special perils coverage endorsement for your per-
sonal property. It raises your total homeowner’s cost about 10 percent 
to 15 percent and gives you coverage for any accidental loss, except for 
a few exclusions. It covers losses not covered by a basic homeowner’s 
policy, like paint spills on the antique rug or piano, water damage to 
your paintings or antiques from a roof leak, and so on. It has very broad 
coverages — not only on fine arts and antiques, but for all your other 
belongings as well.
 
✓ Increase your total homeowner’s limit for Coverage C — personal 
property — high enough to cover all these valuables as well as all 
your other personal property. Most homeowner’s policies, in a total 
loss, don’t have enough contents coverage to pay for all these treasures 
and all your other belongings.
 
✓ Get photos of everything and appraisals on all items where authentic-
ity is vital to a claim settlement. Store the photos away from home, at 
work or in a safe-deposit box. If you don’t follow through on storing this 
critical documentation off-premises, this strategy will fail you and you’ll 
be extremely disappointed at claim time.
Annual appraisals done easy
I had a client once who, instead of investing in 
real estate or the stock market, invested hun-
dreds of thousands of dollars in original art. 
When I asked him why, he said that art values 
more than keep up with inflation, virtually never 
decline, and, unlike stock certificates, can be 
a source of visual warmth and pleasure every 
day. What a great idea! He scheduled all his 
paintings and also solved the annual appraisal 
problem: He simply bought every single paint-
ing from one art dealer who, as part of the deal, 
annually provided me, with no prompting, an 
entire list of all the paintings including up-to-
date values. If you collect art and can do the 
same thing, scheduling is the perfect strategy!

133
 Chapter 10: Avoiding Homeowner’s Personal Property Pitfalls
With this method, you don’t need to get regular appraisals. When you do 
have a claim and need a current appraisal to document the claim value, you 
bring your original appraisals with the photos to a dealer or appraiser. A 
hidden benefit of this method: The cost of the valuation is completely paid 
for by the insurance company as a claims-adjusting expense!
 
Here are my bottom-line insurance recommendations for insuring artwork, 
collectibles, and antiques:
 
✓ For high-end pieces (for example, expensive paintings), especially if 
you can get your appraiser to agree to send you annual value updates, 
I recommend scheduling. Scheduling fine arts makes for a far easier 
claim settlement, with no arguments about value, as opposed to not 
scheduling, where you must prove the authenticity and value of what 
you lost.
 
✓ For glassware or other highly-fragile items, including antique glass, I 
recommend scheduling if you want breakage coverage. Remember to 
add optional breakage coverage to the policy when you schedule.
 
✓ For most other treasures, I recommend the three-part plan — but 
only if you faithfully keep the necessary documentation away from 
home.
 
If you have any kind of property that’s quite valuable and could be stolen, like 
jewelry or fine paintings, install a central burglar-and-fire alarm. Installation 
costs are often $200 or less. The monthly cost to monitor the alarm is about 
$30. You reduce the risk of losing an irreplaceable treasure, and you receive 
10 percent to 20 percent off your homeowner’s bill.
Creatively managing an inherited art collection
Suppose you inherit such a high-value art 
collection that you don’t want to deal with 
the hassle and expense of protecting it, yet 
you want to maintain ownership for posterity. 
Transferring (see Chapter 3) is an excellent risk-
management technique for this type of situation. 
Here’s how it works: Contact places such as art 
museums, historical societies, and the like. Tell 
them they can display your artwork in exchange 
for assuming the risk for any loss or damage. If 
someplace agrees, get the deal in writing.
If you’re successful, you avoid the insurance 
problem — hundreds of dollars in premiums — 
and the expense of the high-end security you 
would need to properly protect your collection. 
You gain peace of mind by not having all those 
expensive items in your home. You maintain the 
ownership of the items to pass on to future gen-
erations. And, finally, you can still enjoy your art 
by visiting the museum anytime during normal 
business hours. In fact, they may even give you 
a key to the place!

134
Part III: Home Sweet Home: Understanding Homeowner’s Insurance 
Covering Collectibles
Collecting — anything from baseball cards to bottle caps, from coins to 
comic books, from stamps to sterling silver — is all the rage and has been for 
years. But this type of property has insurance pitfalls. In this section, I show 
you how to protect yourself from the pitfalls, case-by-case.
Coins, money, and more
We all want to collect money — the more of it, the merrier! What you need 
to know is that your homeowner’s policy wants nothing to do with your 
money — or almost nothing. The policy has a dollar limit on money, typi-
cally $200. That’s $200 for everything — not just what’s in your wallet. If it 
even looks, tastes, or smells like money, it’s included in the $200 limit — for 
example, banknotes, bullion, gold, silver, platinum, coins (including coin 
collections), and medals.
Yes, you can increase the $200 policy limit, or, in some cases, schedule 
collections — for a fortune in premiums, but I never recommend either 
strategy because proving your loss is nearly impossible. (Imagine losing that 
wonderful coin collection. Now imagine proving to the adjuster the exact 
coins you had, what their condition was, and the current value of each.)
 
If you insist on keeping any money collectibles at home, my suggestion is to 
hide your collection very well. Strongly consider installing a central burglar 
alarm or a home safe. If neither approach is an option for you, put the money 
items in a safe-deposit box, where they aren’t insured but where the theft risk 
is extremely remote.
Stamps and valuable papers
Another item insurers don’t want to cover is anything valuable contained 
on a piece of paper. They’ll cover the blank paper — they just don’t want to 
cover what’s on the paper. So the homeowner’s policy has another dollar 
limit, usually about $1,000 for this type of property. Stamp collections are a 
good example. Some other examples include manuscripts, passports, tickets, 
letters of credit, and deeds.

135
 Chapter 10: Avoiding Homeowner’s Personal Property Pitfalls
Yes, you can raise the dollar limit on this type of property. You can even 
schedule stamps, but I don’t recommend it. Prevention is better. Getting a 
safe-deposit box is a good option. Some of my clients have installed in-home 
fireproof safes to protect their stamps or valuable papers.
 
Make sure your safe can’t be removed from your home. It should be built into 
the wall or floor.
Cards, comics, and other collections
People used to collect just stamps, or coins, or art. These days, anything 
goes: CDs, books, antique toy trains, soldiers, Barbie dolls, baseball cards, 
comic books, miniature Christmas villages, porcelain dolls, teddy bears, and 
Beanie Babies. Some people even collect old insurance policies!
 
The biggest problems with collections are documentation and valuation: prov-
ing what you had and putting a value on it. If you have a claim, every policy 
has a requirement that you make a detailed inventory of what you lost. It’s a 
nightmarish task.
Say a fire destroyed your 2,000-card baseball card collection and you’re 
asked for an inventory from the claims adjuster. You spend days putting 
together your list. Now, how do you value it? The value of each card will fluc-
tuate wildly, depending on condition. Because your collection is destroyed, 
how do you prove to the adjuster that your 1952 Mickey Mantle rookie card 
was the mint one worth $12,500 and not the bent, folded, crinkled one worth 
$75? The burden of proof is on you. If you can’t prove condition, you’ll prob-
ably end up getting paid for average cards when many of yours were mint.
To get what you deserve for your collections at claim time, you need to:
 
✓ Document every item to prove its existence for the claims inventory and 
to prove its condition for the valuation.
 
✓ Authenticate the originality of items whose value depends on their 
originality.
 
✓ Make sure your policy limit on belongings is high enough to cover all 
your collectibles and all other normal personal property.
 
✓ Make sure that the kinds of losses that can damage your collections 
(breakage for porcelain dolls, water damage for baseball cards, and so 
on) are covered.

136
Part III: Home Sweet Home: Understanding Homeowner’s Insurance 
 
Here are suggestions that will allow you to do all of this and still keep it 
simple:
 
✓ Check your homeowner’s policy under Coverage C, personal property. 
Are your collections subject to any dollar limitations that could hurt 
you? If so, either raise the limit or, better yet, switch your insurance to 
an insurer whose policy does not have these dollar limits. Most do not.
 
✓ Don’t schedule collections and spend a lot of money on appraisals if the 
values can change quickly, making your schedule obsolete overnight. 
Here are two exceptions to this rule:
 
• If you need breakage coverage
 
• If the values are high-end and dependent on proof of authenticity.
 
 If you do schedule, insist on the fine arts form so at claim time the 
insurer has to pay out the scheduled amount regardless of current 
value.
 
✓ Take a close-up photographic inventory. A digital or video camera 
works best for extensive collections like books, comic books, or sports 
cards. You can probably film your whole collection in one sitting. (It’s 
also easy — and cheap — to add to as your collection grows.) Then at 
claim time, you can make up your inventory of what you lost from the 
photos. The photos will also document the condition. Be sure to store 
photos away from home!
 
✓ If any or all of your collection’s value depends on proving authentic-
ity or mint condition, get an appraisal just once that does so. Store the 
appraisal off-premises with the photos. A signed statement from a cred-
ible dealer works fine. To enhance the appraisal, consider attaching an 
individual photo.
 
✓ Buy the optional special perils contents coverage for the broadest pos-
sible coverage on your collection (if you don’t schedule).
 
✓ Determine the approximate value of your collection, add it to the esti-
mated value of your belongings, and raise your Coverage C personal 
property limit as needed. (See Chapter 9 for how to estimate the value of 
your contents.)
 
✓ Do whatever you can to reduce the risk of loss to your collections. For 
example:
 
• Don’t store moisture-sensitive collections, like old record collec-
tions, in a damp basement where they can warp (as I’m currently 
doing) or be subject to water damage. Instead, seal them in air-
tight, plastic zipper bags. (This works well for comic books, too.)
 
• Put breakables out of the flow of traffic and, ideally, in protective 
storage — cabinets or trunks.

137
 Chapter 10: Avoiding Homeowner’s Personal Property Pitfalls
If you follow these suggestions, especially the one about having a photo-
graphic inventory, your satisfaction on any claim involving a collection will 
improve substantially. If you do nothing at all, you’ll have a major hassle and 
get paid less than you deserve. Enough said.
The Wares: Silver, Gold, or Pewter
All homeowner’s policies have a dollar limit on theft — usually $2,500 to 
$5,000 — of silverware, gold ware, and pewter ware, including plated ware. 
This dollar limit applies not just to flatware, but also to accessory pieces like 
tea sets. It even applies to trophies.
The policy limit is usually adequate if your pieces are plated. But the limit is 
inadequate if you have solid sterling, solid gold, or solid pewter.
So how do you protect your wares? The most common insurance-industry 
solution for insuring silver, gold, and pewter is to get it appraised and then 
schedule it on the policy as you do with jewelry. The problem I have with 
this solution is that these wares are a commodity, and they go up and down 
in value. If you schedule each of your silver pieces, for example, when silver 
prices go up, you’re immediately under-insured on every piece. And when 
silver prices drop, you’re over-insured.
 
Even if you decide to schedule your silver, gold, or pewter, don’t spend money 
for an appraisal. Just contact a dealer for a current price list, or bring a couple 
of pieces down to the store for a ballpark estimate. Because the values fluctu-
ate daily, an exact price isn’t necessary. These wares have a low chance of 
loss. What can happen to them? Fire and theft. Fire is fully covered, without 
limit, which means theft is your only insurance concern.
 
Silver, gold, and pewter aren’t like jewelry — they don’t need to be examined 
under a microscope. They more closely resemble camera gear. They usually 
have a manufacturer and pattern name, and you can generally look up prices 
in a book.
 
I don’t recommend scheduling your silver, gold, or pewter. You have better 
options:
 
✓ If you don’t use your wares every day, hide them. Hiding works, but if 
you want more security, add a central burglar alarm.
 
✓ If you do use your silver, gold, or pewter regularly, or you just prefer 
to keep it displayed, you probably need to insure it. Check with a dealer 
first to see what it’s worth. Then, because theft is the only cause of loss 
with a dollar limit, raise your theft limit from the basic limit (typically 
$2,500) to the true, current value of your silver. Round up a bit so that 
you’re covered if prices rise.

138
Part III: Home Sweet Home: Understanding Homeowner’s Insurance 
If your silver, gold, or pewter was a gift and you either wouldn’t replace it or 
are comfortable replacing it with silver plate, you can skip the extra insur-
ance and live with the $2,500 policy limit.
 
If you increase the silver limit and don’t schedule your silver, the burden of 
proof, as usual, is on your shoulders at claim time to prove what you had. 
Here’s how to protect yourself:
 
✓ Take photos and write the name of the manufacturer and the pattern on 
the back of the photos.
 
✓ Get appraisals just once for any pieces that don’t have that information, 
not to prove value but to prove that the piece is solid silver, gold, or 
pewter.
 
✓ Store the photos and appraisals off-premises along with a single piece of 
flatware to prove what you had.
 
Failure to maintain documentation will cause you, at the least, claims hassles — 
and probably lead to your claim payment being inadequate.
 
Don’t feel like you have to follow just one strategy. Maybe some silver you’re 
comfortable hiding, some you want to display and would replace if it were 
stolen, and some you display but wouldn’t bother replacing. If so, combine 
these strategies.
Covering Business Property at Home
Homeowner’s policies are designed for residential — not business — risks, 
so it’s no surprise that coverage for business personal property is minimal — 
typically $2,500 at home and $250 away. Also, there is usually a complete exclu-
sion for business data — both on paper and electronic media.
The definition of business in most homeowner’s policies clearly includes your 
regular job. But does it include part-time jobs, home babysitting, or summer 
lawn jobs? Unfortunately, that’s subject to interpretation. Because the poli-
cies are vague, the courts have gotten involved: They’ve defined business, as 
used in homeowner’s policies, to mean an activity that both earns revenue 
and is continuous.
So, a once-a-year garage sale would not be a business. But my friend Bobbie’s 
garage sales, which she’s conducted out of her garage for the whole neigh-
borhood, once a month for 20 years, may be a business, and the $2,500 limit 

139
 Chapter 10: Avoiding Homeowner’s Personal Property Pitfalls
would apply. Similarly, your 12-year-old son’s use of your $600 lawnmower 
to do a few summer lawn jobs probably isn’t a business because it’s not con-
tinuous. But your 18-year-old son’s $10,000 investment in landscaping equip-
ment, pulled on a utility trailer and used year round, may be a business.
If you have an incidental home office (with a desk, filing cabinet, computer, 
fax, and so on) and you telecommute from your regular job, you’re also sub-
ject to the business-property limitations of the policy.
If the business property coverage that comes with your homeowner’s policy 
(typically $2,500) is enough to replace all you own or use at home and you 
never take for-business items off-premises, you’re set. Just remember to read 
your policy and make sure you know what the dollar limit is.
If some of the business property at your home is owned by your employer 
and furnished for your use, see if your employer is covering it already or 
can cover it. You won’t need supplemental insurance if the items are already 
covered.
 
If you own substantially more than $2,500 worth of business property, or take 
more than $250 worth of business property away from home, or if you have a 
lot of business data at risk, here are some things you can do:
 
✓ If you have more than $2,500 at risk at home, increase your business 
property on-premises coverage high enough to cover your exposure.
 
✓ If you take more than $250 worth of business property out of your 
home, try to reduce the risk by taking less. Home insurers seldom 
offer an option to buy a higher limit. If they do, it’s pretty pricey. The 
one exception is laptop computers. If you own a laptop, you can avoid 
the $250 limit by scheduling the laptop — a strategy I recommend for 
every laptop owner. Be sure to include a business-use endorsement and 
get special perils coverage, because computers can be damaged easily 
through a variety of causes. The cost is only about $5 per $1,000 of cov-
erage, with no deductible.
 
✓ If you have business data at risk, the best strategy is to back up your 
data. Sure, you can buy optional data coverage when you schedule a 
computer, but re-creating lost data is such a hassle! You’re better off 
backing up and storing a copy of the backup away from home.
For a more in-depth look at managing risks associated with a full-fledged, 
home-based business you operate from your home, see Chapter 13.

Protecting Yourself from Major 
Homeowner’s Exclusions
In This Chapter
▶ Managing excluded property losses
▶ Protecting yourself from homeowner’s liability exclusions
▶ Making sense of the new mold coverage restrictions
▶ Understanding the National Flood Insurance Program
H
omeowner’s insurance policies are extremely comprehensive in cover-
age. They cover the majority of property and liability claims related to 
residences (see Chapter 9), but they do have limits. Even the broadest home-
owner’s property coverage — special perils coverage — has a handful of 
excluded causes of loss, including:
 
✓ Any kind of earth movement, such as earthquake, tremors, landslides, 
mudflows, and sinking or shifting
 
✓ Water that enters the house at or below ground level, such as a flood, 
runoff from heavy rains, sewer backup, and foundation seepage
 
✓ Ordinance or law requirements that either increase the cost of repairs 
or require demolition
 
✓ War or nuclear risks of any kind
 
✓ Other causes of loss for which no coverage is available, including wear 
and tear, neglect, insects, intentional damage, failure to protect the 
property after a loss (see the nearby sidebar, “Protect your property, 
protect your claims”), and off-premises power failures
 
I address in this chapter only the exclusions that you can actually do some-
thing about or for which optional coverage is available. I don’t address here 
exclusions covered elsewhere in this book like boats, recreational vehicles, 
and trailers (which I cover in Chapter 7).

142
Part III: Home Sweet Home: Understanding Homeowner’s Insurance 
Earth Movement Exclusions: 
Shake, Rattle, and Roll!
 
You have three strategies to choose from to protect yourself from earth move-
ment, a normally uninsured cause-of-loss:
 
✓ Avoid the risk completely. Don’t live near a fault line, don’t live on or 
near an active volcano, and don’t buy or build a home on a steep hill 
vulnerable to mudslides. If you do, you have to be willing to live with the 
consequences. This strategy is my favorite because avoiding a major 
risk is always easier, cheaper, and more failsafe than the other choices.
 
✓ Reduce the risk through preventive construction design. Like California 
residents who build homes that can handle some earth shifting without 
causing major damage, spend what you need to spend so that when 
nature brings its wrath, your house is built to take it. (This is my second-
favorite strategy, but it only works when you’re building a new home.)
Protect your property, protect your claims
An insurance policy is a binding legal contract. 
In order to be a valid contract, both parties 
agree to do certain things for the other. The 
obvious obligations are for you to pay all premi-
ums by the due date and for your insurer to pay 
your covered claims when they occur.
But your obligations don’t end with the pre-
mium payment. You can find your obligations 
(called conditions) in the back of every insur-
ance policy, and you’re required to comply with 
each of them. If you don’t, you jeopardize your 
claim settlement if your noncompliance affects 
the claim.
One condition that most people are unaware 
of is the obligation to protect the property from 
further loss once a claim has occurred. If you 
don’t, any resulting damage may not be cov-
ered. Here are some examples:
 ✓ Not acting to put a tarp over the hole in your 
roof caused by a storm, which leads to an 
additional $20,000 interior water damage
 ✓ Not moving high-value items to a safe place 
after a fire on one side of the house has 
made easy access to the interior possible, 
leading to a theft of six original paintings 
valued at $52,000
 ✓ Not changing the locks on your house 
after someone stole your purse with your 
keys inside, leading to a major burglary of 
$35,000 of stereos, TVs, and other property 
after the burglar entered using the stolen 
keys
Following any kind of property claim, you must 
take immediate, reasonable action to prevent 
further damage to your property, or you likely 
won’t be covered for the additional damage. If 
you incur expenses in the process, the insur-
ance company should always reimburse you, 
as long as you promptly notify them, the costs 
are reasonable, and you get their approval.

143
 Chapter 11: Protecting Yourself from Major Homeowner’s Exclusions
 
✓ Buy earthquake insurance. If you live in a high-risk area, you need to 
buy earthquake insurance. Yes, it’s expensive. But not carrying the 
insurance violates one of the major guiding principles in Chapter 2 — 
don’t risk more than you can afford to lose. Consider taking a large 
deductible on your homeowner’s policy and applying the annual dis-
count toward purchasing earthquake coverage.
Water, Water Everywhere: 
Ground Water Exclusions
Water can enter your home at or below ground level by a true flood — where 
a nearby body of water, usually a river, overflows its banks — heavy surface 
runoff, foundation seepage, or sewer backup.
You can avoid the true-flood risk by living nowhere near a body of water or 
by living on top of a mountain. You can significantly reduce the basement 
water risk from runoff or seepage with landscaping, gutters, and so on. You 
can also use my personal favorite approach: adding a sump-pump system. 
You can reduce the sewer backup risk by installing a one-way valve that 
allows sewage to flow out, but not in.
 
There are only two types of insurance available today to cover ground water 
risks, and neither covers the entire risk. The first is a sump pump failure/
sewer backup endorsement you can add to your homeowner’s policy. The 
other is participating in the National Flood Insurance Program. In the following 
sections, I cover both insurance options, but if you just want the bottom line, 
here are my recommendations:
 
✓ If your home is at risk for serious groundwater damage from flood or 
heavy rains: Buy federal flood insurance, with a policy limit at least high 
enough to cover your maximum probable loss. Then reduce that amount 
by the value of all furnishings, carpet, wall coverings, and so on, below 
ground (if you have no walkout), because those items won’t be covered.
 
 Be sure to buy coverage well in advance of any potential flood, because 
the National Flood Insurance Program policy has a 30-day waiting period.
 
✓ For almost everyone else with any potential risk from rain runoff or 
seepage: Install a sump-pump system with a guarantee from a repu-
table firm with good references. An excellent resource is the National 
Association of Waterproofing Structural Repair Contractors (phone: 
800-245-6292; Web: www.nawsrc.org). Certified contractors are best 
because they’ve undergone extensive additional training. Having a 
sump-pump installed is far less expensive than you’d guess. And it costs 
considerably less than uninsured water damage claims.

144
Part III: Home Sweet Home: Understanding Homeowner’s Insurance 
 
 Also, buy optional sump pump failure homeowner’s coverage for the 
lesser of the maximum probable loss or the maximum coverage available.
 
 Preventing the nightmarish mess of a sump-pump failure is far better 
than the alternative, so look into the cost of a backup battery or even a 
full backup system. I had a backup system installed to my town house 
and I sleep a lot better at night — especially when it’s pouring outside.
 
 If you don’t have or want a sump pump, buy at least some sewer backup 
coverage unless you can prevent a backup with a one-way valve in your 
sewer pipe, or unless the lowest level of your structure is unfinished. 
Buy enough to cover the maximum probable loss or the maximum avail-
able, whichever is less.
Read on for more on sump pump failure and sewer backup endorsements, as 
well as the National Flood Insurance Program.
Protecting yourself with sump pump 
failure and sewer backup endorsements
Sump pump failure/sewer backup coverage varies significantly from one 
insurer to the next, but I can tell you how the coverage typically works. 
These endorsements cover water damage, including cleanup. The sump 
pump coverage applies only if you have a sump pump, and only if the sump 
pump fails to handle the intruding water. It usually even covers failure 
caused by power outages. The sewer backup coverage covers damage and 
cleanup anytime the sewer backs up. The basic limit for these two coverages, 
usually sold together, is $5,000 with limits available to $50,000 or more with 
some insurance companies.
 
These endorsements address the seepage and surface runoff problem. This 
insurance coverage is not intended to apply to true floods. Avoid insurers who 
offer watered-down versions of this coverage. Some of these endorsements 
exclude any failures caused by you (for example, if you accidentally overload 
a circuit, cutting power to the pump) or situations where the unit fails to work 
properly without your knowledge (for example, if the motor burns out and you 
have no way of knowing the pump is fried).
Signing up for the National 
Flood Insurance Program
Homeowner’s policies don’t cover flooding or ground water damage from 
heavy rains. With the private insurance industry unwilling, for a number of 
reasons, to offer flood insurance, Uncle Sam stepped in to offer coverage to 
homeowners, either directly or indirectly through a select list of participating 

145
 Chapter 11: Protecting Yourself from Major Homeowner’s Exclusions
insurance companies who act as the government’s agent. Premiums start as 
low as $119 per year. The only requirement to be eligible is that you must live 
in a community that participates in the National Flood Insurance Program 
(NFIP). Some communities don’t (but, in my opinion, all should).
 
NFIP coverage doesn’t cover just any ground water entering your home. To be 
considered a flood and, thus, be eligible for coverage, the water damage must 
be substantial enough to damage either two adjacent properties, including 
yours, or just your property if your property covers two or more acres. So, 
unless you have two or more acres, if you get flooded from heavy rains but 
none of your adjacent neighbors does, the flood policy you purchase won’t 
cover the damage. (In that case, you probably would not have had damage if 
you had a sump pump.)
The two federal flood programs
The federal government offers two flood insurance programs:
 
✓ Emergency program: The emergency program is for homes in communi-
ties that are applying for participation in the NFIP but have not yet been 
accepted. The emergency program’s sole purpose is to allow homeown-
ers in those waiting communities to at least get some flood coverage 
until the community is officially NFIP-approved.
 
 In the emergency program, prices are higher than they are in the regular 
program, and less coverage is available. The maximum available cover-
age through the emergency program is $35,000 for dwellings and $10,000 
for contents — maximums that may be inadequate. Change your maxi-
mums as soon as your community gets NFIP approval.
 
✓ Regular program: The regular program is for homes in communities 
that are active NFIP participants. The maximum coverage limits in the 
regular program are more reasonable than they are in the emergency 
program: $250,000 for dwellings and $100,000 for contents.
The quirks of flood insurance
Flood insurance differs from homeowner’s insurance in several key ways:
 
✓ There is a 30-day waiting period between the date you apply for flood 
insurance and the effective date of coverage. Be sure to apply early — 
don’t wait to apply until you’re laying sandbags around your house to 
keep out the river that’s about to overflow.
 
✓ A $500 deductible applies separately to building and contents losses 
($1,000 deductible total if you’re covering both).
 
✓ Claims are paid on a depreciated basis, not replacement cost. 
Structural losses can be paid at full replacement cost only if your build-
ing coverage limit is the lesser of the NFIP policy maximum coverage of 
$250,000 or 80 percent or more of your home replacement cost.

146
Part III: Home Sweet Home: Understanding Homeowner’s Insurance 
 
✓ You can buy insurance coverage for the building only (if you’re a 
landlord, for example), contents only (if you’re a tenant), or both the 
building and the contents (if you’re a homeowner).
 
✓ Building and contents limits are bundled together (from a minimum 
of $20,000 on the building and $8,000 on contents to a maximum of 
$250,000 on the building and $100,000 on contents).
 
✓ Coverage for basements is very limited. A basement is defined as 
having all four sides below grade. The NFIP policy covers only basement 
structures, including equipment (such as furnaces, water heaters, and 
air-conditioners). It does not provide coverage for finished walls, floors, 
and ceilings. Belongings in the basement are completely excluded, 
except for large appliances (such as washers, dryers, and freezers).
 
 If your basement is a walkout (the floor of one side is at grade level), 
you’ll be fully covered because the flood insurance policy doesn’t con-
sider your basement a true basement. On the other hand, if you own 
a split-level where a lower level is half in the ground and half above 
ground, the flood policy considers that a basement because the floors of 
all four sides are below grade.
How to buy flood insurance
To buy flood insurance, start by going to www.floodsmart.gov. You can 
input your address and find out immediately if your home is in a low, moder-
ate, or high-risk flood zone. If you’re in the low- to moderate-risk zones, you 
can even get a quote and/or find an agent who sells flood insurance in your 
area.
Don’t overlook flood insurance just because you’re in a low- to moderate-
risk zone. According to the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), 
about 25 percent of flood losses occur in low- to moderate-risk zones!
 
You can and should buy flood insurance from your homeowner’s agent if he’s 
certified by FEMA to sell flood insurance. (Not all agents are certified, and not 
all insurance companies participate in the NFIP.) If your agent doesn’t handle 
flood insurance and you need the coverage, change agents. Because flood is a 
major risk for those people facing it, if your agent is a serious professional, 
he’ll be certified to sell flood insurance.
 
If you are on the fence about your need for flood insurance, here’s a way you 
can get some coverage and keep your costs down: Start by choosing your 
building and contents coverage limits lower than your homeowner’s limits, at 
depreciated values rather than replacement cost. And don’t include in your 
valuations any finished areas below grade on all four sides because there is 
little or no coverage for those areas. Estimate the maximum probable loss for 
structural and contents damage and choose a bundled building and contents 
limit high enough to cover the maximum probable loss for both.

147
 Chapter 11: Protecting Yourself from Major Homeowner’s Exclusions
It’s the Law: Managing Ordinance Risks
All municipalities have building codes, and those codes often change after 
a house is built. So, if your structure is damaged, you may very likely be 
required to upgrade the damaged area to satisfy current codes.
The good news is that the code improvements usually mean a safer, better-
quality home. The bad news is that much of the extra costs are often out of 
your own pocket, because most homeowner’s policies cover the added costs 
of municipally required upgrades only up to 10 percent of your homeowner’s 
coverage limit for your residence. And some insurers completely exclude 
coverage altogether.
 
The picture gets even worse if there is a demolition requirement. A demolition 
ordinance requires that, if more than a specified percentage of the home is 
damaged, the house can’t be repaired — it has to be completely demolished 
and rebuilt. Say you own a home in a city that requires the home to be demol-
ished and rebuilt if 25 percent or more of it is damaged. The replacement 
value of the house is $240,000. You’re unaware of the law in your city, but you 
diligently insure your beautiful home for its full replacement cost. You have a 
kitchen fire that damages one-third of the house. Your insurance company 
happily sends you a check for the $80,000, the cost to repair the damage. It 
adds 10 percent of the building limit for ordinance coverage (or $24,000). So 
Flood insurance vs. disaster assistance: 
Why flood insurance is best
Many people wonder why they should purchase 
flood insurance when the government provides 
disaster assistance through low-interest loans. 
Having flood insurance is a much better idea 
than relying on federal disaster assistance. 
Here’s why:
 ✓ Flood insurance provides immediate help. 
Disaster assistance involves hours of wait-
ing in line, tremendous paperwork, and a 
wait of many months before you see any 
money.
 ✓ Flood insurance provides coverage even for 
local rains or runoffs. Disaster assistance 
requires a presidential decree before it 
goes into effect.
 ✓ You don’t have to pay back flood insurance 
after you get your settlement. Most disaster 
assistance is in the form of a loan that must 
be paid back.
 ✓ Flood insurance coverage limits are much 
higher.
 ✓ Flood insurance is less expensive. The 
usual cost of a flood insurance policy that 
pays you a maximum of $50,000 is $166 per 
year. The cost to repay a $50,000 disaster 
loan is $3,840 per year for over 20 years!

148
Part III: Home Sweet Home: Understanding Homeowner’s Insurance 
you get a total of $104,000 from the insurance company. But the replacement 
cost, including all the mandatory building code improvements, is actually 
$300,000. Add to that the cost to demolish the home and haul it away 
($35,000). So your total expenses are $335,000. That means your out-of-pocket 
loss is $231,000!
The good news is that you can get supplemental coverage from most insur-
ance companies under an ordinance and law endorsement to your home-
owner’s policy. This endorsement usually allows you to raise the automatic 
coverage that comes with your homeowner’s policy from 10 percent of the 
building coverage to 25 percent, 50 percent, 75 percent, or even 100 percent.
So, for example, if you’re insuring your home for $200,000, your automatic 
ordinance and law coverage will be $20,000 (10 percent). If you estimate that 
it will take an extra $50,000 to rebuild your home according to new building 
codes, you’ll need an ordinance and law endorsement of 25 percent (25 per-
cent of $200,000 building coverage equals $50,000.)
 
Estimating the effects of building ordinances on your insurance coverage is 
tricky at best. This is one area where it pays to have an expert insurance agent 
to work with you on your whole program (see Chapter 4).
The home vacancy exclusion
If your home is vacant (devoid of furniture) for 
60 consecutive days, your vandalism and glass 
breakage coverage is suspended, which means 
if someone then breaks into your home, smashes 
all the windows, and trashes the house, you 
have zero coverage under your homeowner’s 
policy. Some of the newer homeowner’s forms 
won’t even cover damage from an ensuing fire 
that’s started by the vandals!
Vacancy is most common in homes that have 
been for sale for a long time. The sellers have 
moved on, taking their furniture with them. It’s 
not uncommon for these homes to be vacant for 
a year or more before they’re sold. Of course, 
the homeowner has had significant coverage 
gaps since the 61st day of vacancy if that’s 
true.
The best solution to this problem is to do every-
thing possible to keep furniture in the home. 
(The courts have held that the amount of furni-
ture has to be adequate for someone to actually 
live there.) I also recommend that you install a 
central burglar and fire alarm so that, if anyone 
does break in, the police will be there in less 
than five minutes.
If the house is in a cold part of the country, 
add a temperature sensor to the central alarm 
service so that, if the temperature dips below 
a certain level, your alarm company will be 
notified. This strategy will greatly reduce the 
chance of pipes freezing and cracking and 
flooding the house, which may not be noticed 
for weeks or months.

 Chapter 11: Protecting Yourself from Major Homeowner’s Exclusions
Liability Exclusions: Making 
Sure You’re Covered
Homeowner’s policies have a variety of liability exclusions, and in this sec-
tion I fill you in on the major exclusions, show you how they can hurt you, 
and give you strategies for minimizing your possibility of being uninsured in 
a personal lawsuit.
 
My advice in this section is based on a typical homeowner’s policy. Every 
insurer differs slightly from this norm. So you need to be sure to read and 
understand your specific homeowner’s policy.
 
Every homeowner’s policy has a few exclusions that I don’t cover here, 
because there’s not much you can do about them — exclusions like war and 
nuclear-related liability, communicable diseases, abuse (sexual, physical, 
mental), and anything related to the buying or selling of illegal drugs. All you 
can do is avoid these activities. Optional liability insurance just isn’t available 
for something like a nuclear blast you set off!
The business exclusion
Homeowner’s policies exclude coverage for injuries or property damage 
you cause in any way related to business — your own business or someone 
else’s. (See Chapter 13 for a more detailed analysis if you actually operate 
your own business from your home.)
The courts have defined business, as used in the homeowner’s policy, as any 
activity for which there is both revenue and continuity. Naturally, anything 
arising from your job or occupation fills that definition. But so can income 
you earn on the side. If you have a single garage sale, it’s not a business. If 
you have one once a month for ten years, it probably is a business. If you 
baby-sit occasionally, it’s not a business. If you’re a nanny for another fam-
ily’s children, it is a business. If you’re part of a babysitting co-op where you 
take turns watching each other’s children and no money is exchanged, it’s 
not a business. But if you decide to quit your job and have a home day care, 
you have a business.
 
The problem with having your activity defined as a business is that, if you’re 
sued for injuries or property damage arising from those activities, your home-
owner’s policy won’t cover you. It won’t even pay for your defense.
That means you would have coverage for none of the following situations:

150
Part III: Home Sweet Home: Understanding Homeowner’s Insurance 
 
✓ You’re working as a nanny or daycare provider, and the children in your 
care are injured.
 
✓ You have a weekly garage sale and someone is electrocuted when using 
an iron she bought from you.
 
✓ You’re sick and working from home, and your boss sends a courier to 
deliver work to you; the courier slips on your icy driveway and is injured.
 
✓ You spill hot coffee on a coworker at work and injure her.
As the last two examples show, this exclusion applies not only to self-
employed people but also to people who cause injuries or damage as some-
one else’s employee, whether at home or at work!
 
Here are some strategies you can take to help prevent the business exclusion 
from hurting you:
 
✓ If you’re an employee and you want coverage for injuries you cause 
to someone while on the job, buy the business pursuits homeowner’s 
endorsement. It costs about $5 a year, and I think every employee 
should buy this.
 
✓ If you telecommute or have an incidental office at home, buy an 
incidental office liability endorsement. It costs only $10 to $25 a year. 
Many of these endorsements include extra coverage on your business 
furniture and equipment.
 
✓ If you host weekly neighborhood garage sales, consider avoiding the 
risk of uninsured injuries by stopping the sales. The money you make 
isn’t worth the potential uninsured lawsuit. You can either give the 
items to a worthy cause and play golf on Saturdays instead, or sell your 
stuff only occasionally, maybe at someone else’s neighborhood garage 
sale. By no longer doing it regularly, it won’t be a business.
 
 If you aren’t willing to give it up, either buy a small business policy (which 
costs at least $300 a year) or have your agent or insurance company state, 
in writing, that they won’t exclude coverage for your garage sales.
 
✓ If you’re caring for other people’s children regularly, either at your 
own home or in their home, you must buy childcare liability insur-
ance. It’s available from one or more of these four sources:
 
✓ An endorsement to your homeowner’s policy. Check here first — if avail-
able, it’s normally the least expensive option.
 
✓ Small business policies from insurance agents.
 
✓ A state office that licenses childcare.
 
✓ An association of childcare providers.

151
 Chapter 11: Protecting Yourself from Major Homeowner’s Exclusions
 
✓ If your children earn money from home doing something that has a 
regular pattern (babysitting, lawn care, and so on), get a written state-
ment from your insurer that your kids’ activities won’t be excluded as 
a business. If your insurer won’t do this, change insurance companies. 
Some insurers have customized and broadened their homeowners poli-
cies so that children’s business activities are not excluded as long as 
their earnings are modest (for example, under $2,000 a year, with no 
employees).
 
Whatever you’re doing that produces income — whether you’re an owner or 
an employee — deal with the business exclusion now, even if it means stop-
ping your activity if you can’t get affordable insurance. The cost of an unin-
sured lawsuit can be ruinous. This is the number one insurance coverage gap I 
see when I review insurance programs.
The exclusion for renting part of your home
The homeowner’s policy excludes coverage for injuries to any roomers or 
boarders when more than two of them live in your single family home. A good 
example is a homeowner who rents the three upstairs bedrooms to college 
kids. If one of the kids gets injured at your home and sues you, you have no 
coverage. If you’re the homeowner, you only have two choices to protect 
yourself:
 
✓ Cancel your homeowner’s policy and get a more expensive, commercial 
policy for rooming houses.
 
✓ Don’t rent to more than two individuals at a time.
Note that the exclusion doesn’t apply if you rent occasionally — for example, 
if you rent out your home for a week during a Super Bowl when hotel rooms 
are scarce. And it doesn’t apply if you rent part of your home as an office, 
school, studio, or garage.
The exclusion for any other 
premises you own or rent
The Homeowners policy covers your primary home but not other locations 
you rent long-term or own, such as vacation homes or rental properties. The 
easy solution is to include liability coverage with the policy you buy on the 
other location. Or you can extend your primary homeowner’s liability cover-
age to the other location with an endorsement costing about $15 a year if you 
occupy the house, or about $25 per year if you’re renting it to others.

152
Part III: Home Sweet Home: Understanding Homeowner’s Insurance 
The loss assessment exclusion
The loss assessment exclusion denies coverage for assessments for injuries 
or property damage made against you by a community of home, town house, 
or condominium owners of which you are a member. If you own a home, 
town house, or condominium that is part of an association, you can buy 
optional loss assessment coverage as an endorsement to your homeowner’s 
policy that covers some but not all of these assessments. (See Chapter 12 for 
more details on how loss assessment coverage actually works.)
 
Because these loss assessments can be quite substantial and because the cost 
of the coverage is minimal (less than $25 per year), I always recommend that 
anyone who is part of a homeowner’s association buy the maximum — usually 
$50,000 worth of coverage
The contracts exclusion
The homeowner’s policy excludes liability coverage for all contracts, oral 
or written, but it also has two nice coverage givebacks. A coverage giveback 
means that the exclusion in your policy is nullified — or the insurance com-
pany’s excuse for not paying you in a given circumstance is taken away. 
These givebacks apply to the following written — not oral — contracts:
 
✓ Contracts that involved the ownership, maintenance, or use of a location 
you have insured, such as your home
 
✓ Contracts in which you assume the liability of others prior to any claim 
(for example, you rent a chainsaw and in the rental agreement you agree 
to protect the hardware store if it’s sued for any injury that occurs while 
you’re using the saw)
I have a wheelchair-bound client, Betty, who owns a beautiful two-story home 
on the Mississippi River. The house has an elevator to help her navigate 
between floors. In her contract with the elevator maintenance company, she 
unknowingly agreed to defend them and pay any judgment against them for 
any lawsuit arising from an elevator injury.
The first coverage giveback for written contracts will do what she contracted 
to do because the contract has to do with the maintenance of her home. So, if 
someone is injured in the elevator when a cable snaps, the homeowner’s lia-
bility coverage will defend and pay any judgment against Betty and, because 
of the elevator contract, it will do the same for the elevator maintenance 
company.

153
 Chapter 11: Protecting Yourself from Major Homeowner’s Exclusions
 
These two coverage givebacks won’t cover all your written contracts. But a 
good personal umbrella policy will cover most of the liability you assume 
when you sign a contract. (See Chapters 16 and 17 to learn more about the 
contractual coverage of umbrella policies for all types of personal contracts.)
The property in your custody exclusion
Homeowner’s policies exclude coverage for damage to the property of others 
in your possession, whether you rent it (for example, when you rent a boat), 
occupy it (when you borrow a friend’s cabin for the weekend), or use it 
(when you borrow your employer’s laptop computer). There is one coverage 
giveback — coverage for fire, smoke, or explosions you cause, such as for a 
kitchen fire you cause in your rented apartment. (See the preceding section 
for more on coverage givebacks.)
 
When you know that this pitfall exists, you can protect yourself, at least par-
tially. Here’s how:
 
✓ Buy a personal umbrella policy that plugs this gap by covering 
damage to property you don’t own that is in your care. (See Chapter 16 
for more information.)
 
✓ When renting equipment, boats, and so on, if the value of what you’re 
renting exceeds what you’re willing to pay for out of pocket, buy cov-
erage from the rental company, if you don’t have an umbrella policy 
that covers it.
Good neighbor property damage coverage
Every homeowner’s policy includes a very 
useful supplemental coverage called damage 
to property of others. It covers up to $1,000 
(depending on the insurance company) for 
damage you or your kids cause to other peo-
ple’s property, including property in your cus-
tody, and there’s no deductible. It even covers 
intentional damage (pranks) by your children if 
they’re under a certain age (the age varies from 
one company to the next). This coverage applies 
if your 10-year-old throws a rock through the 
neighbor’s window, or if you cut down a tree 
limb and it crashes through your neighbor’s 
sunroom, or if your dog chews apart the neigh-
bor’s new couch. If your neighbor does any of 
this damage to your property, remember that he 
has this coverage, too, if he has a homeowner’s 
policy. Just ask him to report the claim — that’s 
all there is to it.

154
Part III: Home Sweet Home: Understanding Homeowner’s Insurance 
 
✓ When using other people’s property on a long-term basis, like a laptop 
computer, you can specifically insure it on your homeowner’s policy 
(called scheduling). Be sure to list the owner as a loss payee on the 
policy to protect the owner’s interest.
The workers’ compensation exclusion
Workers’ compensation is an insurance program of state-mandated benefits 
that employers provide employees, usually covering the employee’s medical 
bills and lost wages from a job-related injury or illness. Workers’ compensa-
tion is no-fault coverage.
To collect benefits, an injured person must only meet two requirements: He 
is your employee, and he has been hurt on the job. If an employer fails to buy 
a workers’ compensation policy, he has to pay, out of his own pocket, the 
same benefits to the injured worker that the policy would have paid.
If you have no employees but you hire contractors or laborers who do not 
have their own workers’ compensation policies, I recommend buying contin-
gent workers’ compensation (CWC) coverage — especially if you’re affluent 
and very suable. A very small number of homeowner’s insurers offer CWC 
coverage as a policy endorsement for a nominal charge. If your homeowner’s 
insurer doesn’t offer CWC coverage, find one that does — or buy a CWC 
policy from your state workers’ compensation insurance pool, if it’s avail-
able. Some companies included CWC for small exposures — another good 
reason to have your agent find the best company for you.
CWC works like this: If any injured contractor ever sues for workers’ com-
pensation benefits, this optional coverage completely defends you and, if you 
lose, pays the state-required benefits.
 
Your state may have a law exempting homeowners from this risk. Check with 
your state insurance department or the Department of Labor if in doubt.
The mold exclusion
Historically, damage caused by mold has never been covered under home-
owner’s insurance but mold cleanup resulting from covered water damage 
has been covered. However, as a result of a couple of high-profile successful 
lawsuits, homes worth hundreds of thousands of dollars were declared total 
losses by the courts because of “hazardous” mold infestation. Insurers were 

155
 Chapter 11: Protecting Yourself from Major Homeowner’s Exclusions
forced to demolish the homes and rebuild at their expense. The courts’ deci-
sion has led to a very strong reaction from the insurance industry, which 
immediately began to also exclude or severely limit claims for mold cleanup 
that are part of a covered water damage claim.
There’s very little consistency in the insurance industry in the way they 
limit or exclude mold claims. Some companies completely exclude property 
claims involving mold; others also exclude liability claims (such as defend-
ing you if you’re sued because a guest staying in your home suffered severe 
lung damage as a result of an asthma attack from breathing in some mold you 
didn’t know existed in your basement).
 
Other companies include a modest amount of mold coverage on the policy, 
most commonly $10,000 on property losses and $50,000 for liability claims. I’m 
especially concerned about the limitation on liability claims because a lawsuit 
involving a serious injury from mold inhalation could easily exceed $50,000.
 
For mold to grow, it needs water. So the key at claim time to avoid getting 
burned by this exclusion/limitation is to make sure that all the water has been 
removed — not just the obvious water on the floor but also hidden water, 
such as replacing the sheet rock that has wicked up water and replacing mold-
ings. If a water damage claim is covered by your homeowner’s policy, even 
though the policy may not cover the cost to remove mold, the insurer is obli-
gated to pay to repair and replace any parts of the home that have been dam-
aged by water. If you’re diligent about getting rid of the water at the time of 
the claim, you shouldn’t have to worry about future mold problems.
A good strategy for protecting yourself against large mold liability claims 
is to buy a personal umbrella policy that will defend and pay any judgment 
against you for any losses that exceed the small coverage limit that you have 
on your homeowner’s policy. I represent companies that have agreed to 
do just that, so I know that step-down umbrella coverage is available in the 
personal umbrella marketplace. (See Chapters 15 and 16 for more on how 
umbrella coverage works.)

Chapter 12
Insuring Your Condominium 
or Town House
In This Chapter
▶ Exposing major coverage gaps
▶ Closing the gaps with customized coverages
▶ Reducing your exposure to unexpected assessments
▶ Managing the special needs of vacation condos and timeshares
T
he single biggest change in the housing market in the past 30 years has 
been the movement away from single-family homes toward town houses 
and condominiums. A new type of homeowner’s policy, often referred to as 
the homeowner’s form 6, has been created to meet the special needs of town 
house or condominium owners.
The good news is that there is a special policy for those who own town 
houses or condos. The bad news is that, unless you have a great agent who 
knows what he’s doing, your policy may have serious coverage gaps. (See 
Chapter 4 for tips on finding a great agent.)
In this chapter, I fill you in on what these coverage gaps are and why they 
exist, and then I tell you how to work around them. I end the chapter with a 
section on vacation properties — condos and timeshares — and the special 
challenges they present. With the information in this chapter at your finger-
tips, you’re sure to get the coverage you need for your condo or town house.
Defining the Problem
First things first: Let me give you a definition of what I mean by town houses 
and condominiums. Town houses and condos are individually owned, resi-
dential units, similar to apartments, that are part of a complex of similar units 
attached together in one or more buildings.

158
Part III: Home Sweet Home: Understanding Homeowner’s Insurance 
The usual distinction between the two is that town houses have their entry 
doors open to the outside, have other adjacent units only on either side but 
not above or below, and are often multilevel. Condominiums, on the other 
hand, are more like apartments: They open to a common hallway, are usually 
one level, and normally have adjacent units on either side, as well as above 
and/or below. From the outside, town houses look like single homes attached 
at the sides; condominiums look like apartments in an apartment building.
The similarities between condos and town houses are that:
 
✓ In addition to the ownership of their individual units, unit owners 
(people who own town houses or condos) also own a proportionate 
interest in common areas like lawns, driveways, weight rooms, club-
houses, swimming pools, and so on.
 
✓ All the unit owners band together to form a homeowner association. A 
board of directors made up of elected unit owners acts on behalf of the 
association.
 
✓ Several documents define the rights, obligations, and operating policies 
of the association (primarily the bylaws and declaration documents).
Identifying the master policy shortcomings
One of the functions of the association is to arrange insurance coverage — 
both property and liability — for the entire complex of buildings; the insurance 
policy is called the master policy. The master policy insures all structures, 
including the majority of the structure owned by each unit owner. Each unit 
owner is responsible for insuring her own belongings, plus any part of her unit 
structure not covered by the association master policy. And that’s where the 
problem arises.
In the vast majority of associations, a significant structural coverage gap 
exists between the association’s master building insurance policy and the 
unit owner’s personal homeowner’s policy. And the truth is, this gap is usu-
ally the result of a misperception on the part of the unit owner.
The unit owner believes — usually mistakenly — that he’s responsible for 
insuring his personal belongings only, and that the association’s master 
policy pays for everything structural in the unit (after a policy deductible of 
typically $5,000 or $10,000).

159
 Chapter 12: Insuring Your Condominium or Town House
Discovering the unit owner policy gap
 
But the reality, most of the time, is that the association master policy covers, 
at a minimum, the bare interior walls of your unit and the bare floors. That 
makes you responsible for some or all of the interior of your unit. If you have a 
basic homeowner’s policy that only covers the contents of the unit and, say, 
$5,000 of building coverage, this could be a big coverage gap — I’ve seen the 
gap be as large as $300,000! Can you imagine discovering such a gap only after 
a fire destroys most of your unit? Sadly, that’s when most people find out.
The gap is not, as you may expect, spelled out in the master policy. Instead, 
you’ll find it in one of your association documents, usually the declaration 
(which defines which part of your unit the association will insure). This 
makes sense given that the board of directors of the association determines 
exactly which part of each unit is insured by the master policy and which 
part is the unit owner’s responsibility. The master policy pays only what the 
association documents require it to pay.
Here are some typical examples of items that you, as the unit owner, may be 
responsible for replacing — things often excluded by the association master 
policy:
 
✓ Everything but bare walls and floor. You’re responsible for drapes, 
carpet, hardwood flooring, bathroom ceramic tile, wall coverings, built-
in appliances, cabinets, countertops, plumbing fixtures (like tubs and 
toilets), lighting fixtures, and more!
 
✓ Any structural improvements you make. Examples include finishing the 
basement, adding a deck or porch, upgrading a kitchen, and so on.
 
✓ Any improvements made by any unit owner since the unit was built. 
This is extremely difficult to determine if the unit is older and especially 
if it’s had several owners before you. Someone on the board of directors 
may be able to tell you what an original unit looked like.
Solving Problems with Proper 
Unit Owner’s Insurance
The homeowner’s policy created specifically to meet the unique property 
and liability risks of town house and condominium owners has six types of 
coverage — I review four of them here because these four coverages are 
most affected by town house or condominium ownership:

160
Part III: Home Sweet Home: Understanding Homeowner’s Insurance 
 
✓ Coverage for damage to the unit structure (Coverage A)
 
✓ Coverage for any detached buildings, like sheds or garages (Coverage B)
 
✓ Coverage for belongings (Coverage C)
 
✓ Coverage for injuries and property damage you cause (Coverage E)
See Chapter 9 for a review of the six coverage parts of homeowner’s insurance 
and the two causes-of-loss forms I recommend — broad form and special form.
Home sweet home: Building coverage
There are two components you must consider when buying building cover-
age (Coverage A) on your unit-owner policy:
 
✓ The amount of building coverage you need to cover the interior of your 
unit that is not covered by the association master policy
 
✓ The kinds of claims, or causes-of-loss, you want covered
Enough is not enough: Picking your Coverage A limit
 
Start by reading your association declaration with the help of your trusted 
insurance agent to see what your obligations are. The next step is estimating 
the dollar amount of your potential obligations. Whether you do it on a com-
puter or using plain old paper and pencil, make two columns: On the left, list 
every structural item you’re responsible for; on the right, list your estimated 
cost to replace each item.
 
Be sure to include the labor to install.
Add up the amounts in the right column, round that number up by about 20 
percent (to cover any errors you made in estimating the cost), and that’s the 
amount of structural coverage you need. See Table 12-1 for an example, but 
keep in mind that this is just an example — you may need more than $4,000 
to replace your carpet, for example.
Table 12-1

In this case, you would buy about $50,000 of Coverage A.
Special coverage is very special
 
The coverage that comes automatically with the majority of unit-owner poli-
cies is the broad causes-of-loss form, covering your claims only if they appear 
on a list of about 15 covered causes of loss. Anything not on the list isn’t cov-
ered. I don’t recommend this as an option for insuring a structure.
 
For insuring a condominium or town house unit structure, request the 
optional special form (also known as special perils) that covers any accidental 
cause of loss if the cause is not on a small list of exclusions (flood, earthquake, 
and so on). The special form is very inexpensive — only about $1 per $1,000 of 
coverage. (See Chapter 9 for more on special perils.)
Special perils building coverage also improves your coverage for both 
deductible assessments and loss assessments.
If you’re exposed to flood or earthquake risks, you can find out how to 
manage those risks in Chapter 11.
Detached structures: From Fido’s 
house to the toolshed
Some garages that you buy with town houses are attached to the first level of 
your unit; many are in a separate or detached structure. To determine your 
insurance responsibility for garages, read the association’s declaration. If 
you’re required to insure the garage, increase your Coverage A (building cov-
erage) if the garage is attached; if the garage is not attached, buy the appro-
priate amount of Coverage B.
 
Be sure to include in the Coverage B limit all other detached structures 
you’re responsible for, like sheds, permanent docks, fancy dog houses, 
fences, and so forth.

162
Part III: Home Sweet Home: Understanding Homeowner’s Insurance 
Getting personal: Insuring your stuff
One thing common to every association’s declaration is the unit owner’s sole 
responsibility for her personal belongings. Here are my bottom-line recom-
mendations for insuring your belongings:
 
✓ Buy a limit high enough to replace what you own.
 
✓ Buy the optional replacement-cost coverage so your claims will be paid 
on a new cost basis rather than a depreciated value.
 
✓ Upgrade the covered causes-of-loss from broad form to special form so 
that any cause of loss (other than a few that are specifically excluded) is 
covered (such as interior water damage from leaky roofs).
Do these three things and you’ll have enough to replace everything you own 
following a major loss. Plus, you’ll have more causes of loss covered.
 
Turn to Chapter 9 for suggestions on measuring the replacement value of your 
personal property. And see Chapter 10 on how to insure items of special value 
that are limited in coverage in all homeowners policies (jewelry cameras, ster-
ling silver, and more).
Liability: You’re liable to need it
 
When it comes to your personal liability for injuries or property damage, be 
consistent. Buy the same limit that you buy for other policies you own. After 
all, you’re protecting the same assets and the same income — yours! You 
wouldn’t want different liability limits on different policies any more than you 
would want different car insurance liability on weekends than what you have 
for the rest of the week.
If $500,000 is the liability insurance limit you buy for your car insurance, buy 
the same $500,000 for homeowner’s liability, too. (See Chapter 9 for tips on 
choosing a liability limit that’s appropriate for you.) And consider an extra 
layer of liability coverage of $1 million or more under a personal umbrella 
policy. (See Chapters 15 and 16 for more on umbrella policies.)
Assessing Your Assessments
Two things that all homeowner’s associations have in common are loss assess-
ments and deductible assessments. They’re as inevitable when you own a 
condo or town house as death and taxes. Loss assessments occur when there is 
not enough money in the association bank account to pay the bills — usually 

163
 Chapter 12: Insuring Your Condominium or Town House
when the bills exceed expectations. And one of the reasons associations have 
unexpected bills is inadequate insurance coverage. Deductible assessments 
occur when the association assesses the payment of the master policy deduct-
ible against one or more unit owners.
Loss assessments
When the association suffers a loss beyond the limits of its property or liabil-
ity insurance coverage, it assesses you, the unit owner, with a bill to help pay 
for that loss. Therefore, the term loss assessment.
Suppose you own a unit and there are 100 units in your association. Table 12-2 
shows examples of how you could be assessed when an insurance claim is 
not fully covered.

The bad news is that this all sounds pretty scary — and it is. The good 
news is that unit owner’s policies offer some coverage inexpensively, and 
you can use one of the ARRT risk management strategies, loss reduction 
(see Chapter 3), to lower the chances of an assessment ever occurring for 
an insurance claim.
 
Two problems can arrive in your mailbox — in the form of a bill — if you 
ignore the risk of loss assessments in your insurance coverage:
 
✓ The typical unit-owner policy has only $5,000 of loss-assessment cover-
age. This means that if the association sends you a big, ugly assessment 
(say, for $50,000), your unit-owner policy will pay only $5,000 of that — 
not much help. In the three examples in Table 12-2, you could have 
needed up to $60,000 of coverage.

164
Part III: Home Sweet Home: Understanding Homeowner’s Insurance 
 
✓ The insurance company only pays that $5,000 if the cause of the loss is 
covered by your unit-owner policy. In the three examples in Table 12-2, 
your policy covers lawsuits and tornadoes but not workers’ compen-
sation claims. Even if you bought extra loss-assessment coverage, it 
wouldn’t cover your assessment for the injured worker.
In the following sections, I cover three strategies you can take to address 
these problems: changing the association’s insurance program, buying 
enough loss-assessment coverage, and getting better building coverage.
Changing your association’s insurance program
The better your association’s coverage is, the better your chances of avoid-
ing an uninsured assessment.
 
What kind of insurance should your association have? Here’s a list of cover-
ages and/or policies that I think every homeowner’s association should have, 
as a minimum:
 
✓ Building insurance for the full replacement cost of all buildings required 
to be insured by the association, including replacement-cost coverage 
(so claims settlements are not depreciated), an agreed-amount coverage 
(which waives any penalties for under-insurance on partial losses), and, 
if available, a building replacement guarantee if rebuilding costs exceed 
the insurance amount.
 
✓ Flood and/or earthquake coverage if there is the danger of either one 
happening where you live.
 
✓ Public liability insurance of $1 million, or whatever limits are required 
for an umbrella policy.
 
✓ An umbrella liability policy with at least $2 million limits.
 
✓ Worker’s compensation insurance, even if there are no association 
employees (to cover claims brought by injured independent contrac-
tors, covering all defense costs and judgments).
 
✓ Non-owned automobile liability coverage (which protects the associa-
tion from lawsuits arising out of car accidents caused by people running 
errands on behalf of the association in their own personal cars).
 
✓ Directors and officers liability coverage, for two reasons:
 
• People nice enough to volunteer their time to serve on the board 
should be given this coverage so they have insurance in case they 
make an honest mistake and are sued for it.
 
• If the director makes an error that could lead to a possible loss 
assessment, this coverage may cover the error and keep the loss 
assessment from being passed to you.

165
 Chapter 12: Insuring Your Condominium or Town House
 
✓ A fidelity bond, to protect the association from the dishonesty of 
anyone handling money, including an outside management company, if 
you use one.
 
Each association is different, so remember that your association may have 
insurance needs in addition to these.
 
As the unit owner, you have every right to ask for proof from the board that it 
has every one of these policies. If the association does not have one or more 
of these, write to the board and express your concerns — you may be able to 
reduce your chances of a possible loss assessment.
Buying loss assessment coverage: Not 
too much, not too little, but just right
 
Loss assessment coverage is cheap. About $20 a year for the maximum most 
insurers offer — $50,000 of coverage — so buy the maximum.
Buying better building coverage
You need to buy the broadest possible unit-owner building coverage — 
special-perils coverage — in order to have the most possible types of claims 
covered by loss-assessment coverage. Your loss-assessment coverage only 
pays for those assessments where the cause of the loss is a cause covered by 
your building coverage (Coverage A).
 
Always add the optional sump pump failure/sewer backup coverage. Not only 
will that cover those types of losses in your own unit, but it will also cover 
assessments for those losses.
 
Even if you add earthquake coverage to your policy (which you should do if 
you live in an earthquake-prone area), you need to add loss-assessments-for-
earthquake coverage to your policy because earthquake assessments are not 
covered by regular loss-assessment coverage. For example, suppose an earth-
quake crumbles the complex and causes $4 million in damages. The associa-
tion failed to buy earthquake coverage. There are 100 unit owners in the 
association: $4 million divided by 100 units equals an assessment of $40,000 to 
you and all other owners. If you’ve purchased the optional earthquake damage 
coverage on your unit-owner policy and at least $40,000 of loss assessment 
from earthquake coverage, your policy pays the full assessment.
Deductible assessments
In the past few years, two trends have emerged when it comes to association 
master-policy deductibles:

166
Part III: Home Sweet Home: Understanding Homeowner’s Insurance 
 
✓ The deductibles have been increasing to save on insurance costs. 
Deductibles of $10,000 are becoming the norm.
 
✓ Individual unit owners are being assessed the entire deductible if the 
claim is confined to their unit (your dishwasher overflows, damaging 
your hardwood floors) or if the unit owner caused the loss (you cause 
a kitchen grease fire).
Say you’re an owner of a beautiful town house. You cause a kitchen fire with 
$50,000 total fire and water damage. Between the association master policy 
and your unit-owner policy, your claim was paid in full, and you’re happy as 
a clam. Then two months later, you’re hit with a bill from your association 
for $10,000 — the entire master policy deductible! You submit the bill to your 
homeowner’s insurer, which declines your claim, leaving you responsible for 
the entire $10,000 assessment.
Here’s why: A basic unit-owner homeowner’s policy limits coverage for loss 
assessments to $1,000 but it only covers assessments made association-wide — 
it doesn’t cover assessments against individual unit owners. Even if you buy 
extra loss-assessment coverage, the policy still requires association-wide 
assessments in order to compensate you. It also limits deductible assessments 
to $1,000.
There is no uniform solution that all insurance companies have agreed to. 
The norm, however, is to offer an optional endorsement called deductible 
assessment coverage (or something similar). There’s no requirement that the 
assessment be association-wide so it does cover individual assessments such 
as the one in this example (as long as you had purchased at least $10,000 of 
coverage).
 
Make sure that you add this coverage to your unit owner’s policy in the 
amount of your association’s master policy deductible. Be sure to check 
with your insurer as to how they handle this risk — it may do things a bit 
differently.
Building Damage Claims: What’s Mine 
Is Mine and What’s Yours Is Yours
Suppose that your association’s declarations require the association to 
insure the majority of your unit and for you to be responsible for insuring 
carpets, drapes, wallcoverings, and improvements you made to the unit. 
Now, suppose that a fire damages both the property that the association is 
responsible for and the property that you’re responsible for. If that sounds 
complicated, it’s because it is.

167
 Chapter 12: Insuring Your Condominium or Town House
 
If you want your claim to go smoothly, you have to be assertive. Because you 
have the strongest personal relationship with your unit-owner insurance com-
pany, ask them to act as the front man on your claim — have them handle 
their own claim as well as act as an agent for you in dealing with the company 
insuring the association. This way, you’ll only have to deal with one insurance 
company — yours. Plus, your insurance company will be responsible for dick-
ering with the association insurance company over any disputed areas — 
they’ll agree to resolve any differences between them, without your having to 
get involved.
You may get some resistance to this request at first, but keep at it. This 
request is perfectly reasonable. You and your association have paid for the 
services of insurance professionals — they’re the experts, and they should 
be willing to do their job.
 
The best way to improve your odds of getting a hassle-free, full settlement is 
to buy the best possible coverage. No matter how nice your insurance com-
pany is, no matter how caring your adjuster is, they will not pay you for cover-
age you don’t have.
 
I see and hear a lot of people criticizing their insurance companies when their 
claim is either denied or underpaid. Trust me: In nearly every instance, the 
coverage is what was lacking — not the insurance company.
Risk Doesn’t Take a Vacation: Covering 
Condominiums and Timeshares
The last thing you want to think about when you’ve just bought a great new 
condo or timeshare in Boca is insurance. Somehow insurance and coconut oil 
go together about as well as oil and water. But risk doesn’t take a vacation, 
and neither can you when it comes to insuring your vacation property.
There are two main types of vacation property: condos and timeshares. I 
cover both of them in the following sections.
Vacation condos
This section applies to homeowner’s of all different types. Maybe you’ve 
bought a seasonal vacation condo on the beach in Maui or at a ski resort in 
Aspen. Someone else manages the property and all the regular maintenance 
is taken care of, so you can have fun when you’re at the condo instead of 
having to do chores!

168
Part III: Home Sweet Home: Understanding Homeowner’s Insurance 
All the risk-management strategies I recommend earlier in this chapter apply 
to vacation condos and timeshares. But there are two exceptions that require 
special handling:
 
✓ You own your condo with friends.
 
✓ You rent your condo to other people when you’re not there.
When you own a condo with your friends
Vacation property costs money, especially because it’s usually located in a 
prime location. To save money, you may have decided to go in on the condo 
with some of your very best friends. Sharing the costs of a vacation condo 
offers lots of advantages, true, but it comes with one major disadvantage: 
The insurance is often set up incorrectly.
Here’s an example from my own files. My clients Desi and Lucy bought 
a Colorado condo with their ski-buff friends, Fred and Ethyl. (Okay, so I 
changed their names to protect their identities.) Desi and Lucy didn’t call 
me at the time, because Fred and Ethyl said that they would take care of all 
the insurance. In my annual review of Desi and Lucy’s insurance program, 
the subject came up. At my urging, they got me a copy of the insurance 
policy from their friends. Here are the pertinent coverages, as arranged by 
Fred and Ethyl:
 
✓ Fred and Ethyl were the only ones named on the policy. As a result, Desi 
and Lucy’s 50 percent ownership in the building and contents were com-
pletely uninsured.
 
✓ The unit-owner building policy coverage limit was only $1,000, with no 
special-perils endorsement.
 
✓ The liability limit was only $100,000 and again, Desi and Lucy were 
uninsured.
 
✓ There was only $1,000 of loss-assessment coverage — far too little. And 
there was no optional deductible assessment coverage.
 
✓ The personal property limit was $45,000. The replacement cost was 
$80,000.
So how much did it cost to plug all five gaps? Would you believe only $100 
per couple per year! As is often the case, a little extra premium to do the job 
well can save potential out-of-pocket losses of hundreds of thousands of dol-
lars. The added premium is peanuts in relation to the risks being protected.

169
 Chapter 12: Insuring Your Condominium or Town House
When you’re renting out your condo
Vacation condos are often rented by the association management when the 
owners aren’t using them. If you allow your unit to be rented, your insurance 
coverage may be suspended due to rental exclusions in the policy.
 
Bottom line: If you’re renting your vacation property even occasionally, check 
with your agent or insurance company and buy the optional rental coverage.
Vacation timeshares
If you have a timeshare, you’ve purchased a period of time (say, a week or 
two) in a vacation condo that you co-own with others. You can use the unit 
during your allotted time, swap your time for another period of time in the 
same complex, swap your time for time in another unit somewhere else in the 
world, or even rent your unit out during your time period.
The condo association manages and insures the whole complex, including 
liability coverage. Most association policies cover your liability for com-
munity injuries (such as a drowning at the swimming pool), but they usually 
don’t cover your liability for injuries or property damage you cause arising 
out of your personal use of your unit (for example, if your guest is burned in 
a kitchen fire).
Your homeowner’s policy won’t cover your personal liability if you own, rent, 
or occupy another location on a regular basis. If you have deeded ownership, 
as most timeshares are, you aren’t insured during your personal occupancy — 
one week or two weeks — by your homeowner’s liability coverage. So how do 
you cover your liability for your time in your timeshare?
 
✓ To cover yourself when you’re using your unit during your allotted 
time, the safest thing to do is to endorse your homeowner’s policy to 
extend your liability coverage to this timeshare unit. This will cost you 
approximately $15 more per year.
 
✓ If you rent the unit to others, endorse your homeowner’s policy to 
cover that rental. This will cost you about $25 per year.
If you swap units with someone else, your use of their unit is covered auto-
matically by your homeowner’s liability coverage.

170
Part III: Home Sweet Home: Understanding Homeowner’s Insurance 
Protecting your property when you’re back home
If you aren’t renting your property and you only 
occasionally use it, you can reduce the chance 
of both burglary and fire by installing a central 
burglar and fire alarm system. After installation, 
this kind of system costs only about $20 a month 
to monitor. You can even add an option for 
temperature monitoring if the condominium is in 
a cold weather climate — the alarm company 
will be alerted if your temperature drops below 
a certain temperature, so that if the furnace has 
failed, your pipes won’t freeze and cause mas-
sive water damage.

I
’ve worked with scores of home business owners over the years, and most 
of them have one thing in common: little or no business insurance. And 
yet these businesses have risks that could cause financial ruin if they were to 
occur.
Home businesses are inadequately insured for two reasons:
 
✓ The homeowner’s policy, even with the optional business endorse-
ments, falls far short of meeting the coverage needs of most home-
business owners.
 
✓ Many home-business owners are unaware of all the risks arising from 
their business and that their homeowner’s policy doesn’t cover many of 
the risks that they do know about.
If you own a home business, or you’re thinking about starting one, this chap-
ter is for you. Here, I fill you in on the many different property and liability 
risks you face and show you how best to protect yourself, using both insur-
ance and non-insurance strategies.
If you don’t own and operate a business from your home, but you do work 
from home (even occasionally) as someone else’s employee, see Chapter 
11 to find out how to avoid the property and liability coverage gaps in your 
homeowner’s policy.

172
Part III: Home Sweet Home: Understanding Homeowner’s Insurance 
Considering the Risks 
of a Home Business
Perhaps the most important part of managing home business risks is know-
ing what those risks are. You can’t manage what you don’t know about.
 
If you currently own, or are even considering owning, a home business, make 
a list as you read through this chapter, identifying the unique risks your busi-
ness faces.
 
The typical homeowner’s policy has the following business limitations:
 
✓ Zero business liability coverage of any kind: No premises liability, no 
products liability, no professional liability, no workers’ compensation, 
and so on.
 
✓ Minimal coverage on business personal property: Typically $2,500 on-
premises and only $250 off-premises.
 
✓ Zero coverage for any detached structures used even in part for busi-
ness purposes, other than garaging cars.
In the next sections, I show you how to manage these risks so that your home 
business — and you! — are protected.
Measuring Your Property Risks
Home businesses almost always involve some property risks — structural (a 
building), personal (stuff), or maybe both. Consultants have offices complete 
with office furniture. Wholesalers and retailers have inventory. Even piano 
teachers have pianos.
To properly cover your home-based business assets, you need to consider 
replacement cost totals for five types of business property:
 
✓ The rebuilding costs of the home office or work area that is located in 
your residence
 
✓ The rebuilding costs of any detached structures used even partially for 
business
 
✓ The cost to replace your business personal property at home

173
 Chapter 13: Running a Home Business without Losing Your Shirt
 
✓ The cost to replace your business personal property away from home
 
✓ The labor costs to reproduce valuable papers, like customer files, maps, 
and so on
 
When determining your business property values in this chapter, use the cur-
rent replacement cost for a new item — you’ll be consistent with how most 
small-business policies value property.
Structural property risks
Sometimes, having a home business requires you to build a place to operate 
from. This place may be part of the residence itself, like a finished office, or it 
may be located in all or part of a separate, detached structure.
If your office is part of your home
If your business space is built into your residence, you just need to make 
sure that your homeowner’s coverage (Coverage A) on your home is high 
enough to rebuild a new house, including the cost to rebuild the business 
environment. You won’t need any special business endorsements.
Why? Because the homeowner’s policy has no restrictions or limitations for 
any part of your primary residence structure used for business purposes. 
There are limitations on business personal property but not on the building 
itself.
If your office is in a detached structure
If your business operates from a detached structure, the entire structure — not 
just the part used for business — is excluded from many insurance companies’ 
homeowner’s coverage. Here’s what you need to do to fix the problem:
 
✓ Buy an endorsement allowing the business use of the structure.
 
✓ Raise your detached structure coverage (Coverage B) high enough to 
rebuild all detached structures on your lot.
Business personal property risks
Many home business owners have offices full of computers and equipment. 
If you operate a franchise out of your home, you may have a garage or base-
ment full of inventory. If you’re an attorney, you have client files that contain 
vital information.

174
Part III: Home Sweet Home: Understanding Homeowner’s Insurance 
What kinds of business property does your business have? Make up an inven-
tory of your equipment as I take you through the following checklist. Next to 
each item, list your best guess as to its current replacement cost, if you had 
to buy it new today.
 
✓ Office furniture and equipment: The majority of home businesses have 
at least some office equipment. Besides the usual desk, chair, and tele-
phone, you may have a filing cabinet, a copy machine, a fax machine, or 
a scanner.
 
✓ Computers: Almost all home businesses have computers. But be sure 
to include on your list not just the computer but also all peripherals — 
mouse, keyboard, printer, modem, wireless router, cables, and other 
hardware. Include software on your list if you don’t keep off-site 
duplicates.
 
✓ Inventory — owned and non-owned: If you keep inventory on your 
premises — either in your house or in a detached structure — you need 
to add it to your list of risks. Set the value on your list at your peak 
inventory limit.
 
 Even if you don’t own the inventory but you’re holding it on consign-
ment, you still may be responsible for it. Check your supplier contract to 
see whose responsibility it is. If it’s yours, add the peak values to your 
list under non-owned inventory.
 
✓ Supplies: Supplies are easy to overlook. They include things like busi-
ness cards, business stationery, staplers, computer paper, and, of 
course, the caffeine tablets you take to help you stay conscious during 
your 80-hour workweek. I recommend setting this value at $2,000 (at a 
minimum).
 
✓ Accounts receivable: This risk represents the estimated lost revenue 
from your inability to collect old receivables when your records are 
destroyed. Put this on your list only if you aren’t willing to store back-
ups, made at least weekly, off-premises.
 
✓ Away from home — in transit, in storage, and shipping: Because hom-
eowner’s policies cover business property away from home for much 
less (typically a $250 limit) than they cover items when the items are at 
your home, having a separate category on your list for property away 
from home is important.
 
 In transit means items you take with you, such as laptop computers, 
attaché cases, or sales samples. In storage means stuff like the old files 
and excess equipment I keep in off-site storage; you may keep inventory 
or other items in storage. Shipping can be incoming, outgoing, or both. 

175
 Chapter 13: Running a Home Business without Losing Your Shirt
If both, have a separate value for each on your list. Even if you’re cur-
rently arranging insurance through the shipper, enter a value here 
anyway. You may be able to reduce your shipping insurance costs by 
arranging the insurance on a bulk basis if you do a lot of shipping.
Assessing Your Liability Risks
 
Don’t risk more than you can afford to lose. (See Chapter 2 for more such guid-
ing principles.)
Most lawsuits cost $40,000 to $100,000 (or more) to defend, and judgments or 
jury awards can add hundreds of thousands of dollars to that amount. Being 
uninsured for any potential business liability is probably risking more than 
you can afford to lose, and puts your personal assets in jeopardy.
 
If you can’t afford to buy the liability insurance your business needs to protect 
itself or find a way to avoid uninsured risks, close the business.
Injuries at home: From employees 
to clients to delivery people
 
If you have a home business, you’re suable for injuries that occur on your 
home premises if they’re business related. “But,” you protest, “I never have 
clients or customers come to my home!” Maybe so. But almost any business 
gets an occasional package delivered. If that delivery person falls and is 
injured, your homeowner’s policy has zero coverage for you or the business.
Regardless of whether you have employees or clients in your home, I recom-
mend you include this risk on your list and buy coverage for it. The cost to 
insure this risk can be as little as $15 a year!
Injuries and property damage 
away from home
If you venture outside your home for business purposes, you could injure 
someone or damage someone’s property. Depending on the nature of your 
business, this risk may be great — for example, if you’re a personal trainer 
who trains clients in their homes, or you sell cosmetics at parties held in 
other people’s homes.

176
Part III: Home Sweet Home: Understanding Homeowner’s Insurance 
If you sell a product or perform 
a service: Products liability
If you sell any kind of product or perform any kind of service (such as the 
building trades, computer or equipment repair, and so on), add this risk to 
your list.
The essence of the risk is that it involves your liability for injuries or property 
damage after the product or completed service is being used by the customer. 
So, for example, a customer’s carpet was ruined by cleaning products that 
you sold him, or an eyeliner you sold caused a client a serious eye injury, or 
a computer starts crashing the day after you performed a tune-up, or a deck 
you built collapses and people are seriously injured. These are all examples in 
which you would be liable, and you need insurance to protect you.
Independent contractors: 
Their mistakes are yours
Whether you like it or not, when you subcontract some of your work to 
others, you’re suable for their mistakes. You can avoid that risk by having 
the customer buy directly from the contractor. If you act as the front person 
with the customer, however, you need to add this risk to your list.
Here’s an example: I’m an insurance agent. If I recommend a roofer to a client 
to fix storm damage and, two months later, the roof leaks, I have no liability — 
just a customer not too happy with the quality of my referrals. If, however, I tell 
the customer that I’ll send someone out to fix the roof and subcontract a roofer 
to do it, the client pays me, and I take a cut and pay the roofer, I’m liable, along 
with the roofer, for the water damage caused by the roofer’s defective work.
Employee risks: From workers’ compensation 
to discrimination and more
If your business requires you to hire one or more employees, you face some 
additional risks, most of which can be insured. These risks include those 
related to state-mandated workers’ compensation benefits. Less-obvious 
employee-related risks include the possibility of being sued for discrimina-
tion when you don’t hire or fire someone. In this section, I cover employee-
related risks and give you my recommendations on handling them.

177
 Chapter 13: Running a Home Business without Losing Your Shirt
 
While you’re at it, make sure that you know the difference between an 
employee and an independent contractor. You can face serious penalties and 
liabilities if you try to get away with treating an employee as an independent 
contractor. (Check out the nearby sidebar for more information.)
Workers’ compensation
In most jurisdictions, if you have an employee, you’re required by law to pro-
vide workers’ compensation insurance to cover medical bills and lost wages 
for your employee if she suffers an occupational injury or certain occupation-
related diseases. If your business has even one employee, add this risk to 
your list.
 
Check with your agent or state department of labor to find out if you can 
exempt yourself, and family members who are employees, from coverage.
Employee benefit liability
The employee benefit liability risk is applicable to you if you employ someone 
and provide her any kind of group benefits — health, disability, or life insur-
ance. It represents your risk arising from errors in administering the group 
insurance program, such as not adding newly hired employees properly to 
the coverage or not notifying terminated employees properly of government-
mandated continuation rights that they have when they leave.
Never the twain shall meet: Independent 
contractors and employees
I see a lot of small-business owners — espe-
cially building-trade contractors and one-per-
son shops — try to reduce their employee costs 
by treating workers who should be employees 
as independent contractors. By employing 
these people as independent contractors, the 
business avoids paying workers’ compensa-
tion premiums, the employer’s share of Social 
Security taxes, unemployment compensation 
taxes, group benefits, retirement plan contri-
butions, and so on. All together, this is a sub-
stantial savings — usually from 25 percent to 50 
percent of the total compensation. That’s a ton 
of money saved for a small-business owner.
But some real downsides to this exist besides 
the ethical issues — primarily with the risk 
you take by not buying workers’ compensation 
insurance and then having to pay workers’ 
compensation benefits out of your own pocket 
if your worker gets injured on the job. The IRS 
has really cracked down on this practice. By 
IRS standards, someone is your employee if he 
works almost exclusively for you, often on the 
business premises; an independent contractor 
earns money from other sources in addition 
to you.

178
Part III: Home Sweet Home: Understanding Homeowner’s Insurance 
If you have a group program covering your employees, add employee benefit 
liability coverage to your risk list and to your business insurance coverage. 
The annual cost is as little as $150 a year!
 
Don’t risk a lot for a little.
Professional errors
If you sell a professional service, add this risk to your list. Some of the profes-
sionals who should be concerned are insurance agents, accountants, lawyers, 
virtually every kind of consultant, architects, engineers, beauty consultants, 
doctors, dentists, veterinarians, real estate agents, real estate appraisers, and 
morticians.
A professional liability policy covers you if a mistake you make on the job 
hurts your client. Here are some examples:
 
✓ A surgeon who leaves the scalpel in her patient
 
✓ An insurance agent who forgets to add a client’s car to an auto policy 
prior to an accident
 
✓ A lawyer who loses a client’s case because he forgot to file the suit 
on time
Buying a separate professional liability policy (also known as errors and 
omissions insurance) is important because, without it, you have no cover-
age elsewhere. Business liability policies almost always exclude coverage for 
professional errors. And homeowner’s policies exclude liability coverage for 
anything business related.
 
When you buy professional liability coverage, be sure that:
 
✓ It covers what you do. I recently had a very successful business client, 
who did management consulting, buy a less expensive errors and omis-
sions policy from another agent. When I reviewed the new policy, it cov-
ered computer consulting but specifically did not cover — you guessed 
it — management consulting!
 
✓ It covers your defense costs and any legal judgment stemming from 
your responsibility for the errors of independent contractors who 
do work for you. Be careful: Many policies do not cover defense costs or 
your liability for errors involving your independent contractors. You want a 
policy that does.

179
 Chapter 13: Running a Home Business without Losing Your Shirt
Vehicle risks
 
Don’t skip this section, even if you have no business vehicles! There are sev-
eral ways you and your business can be at risk regarding vehicles:
 
✓ If the business owns or leases vehicles: The tricky part of this risk is to 
make sure that both you as an individual and your business as owner or 
lessee are both properly protected. Here is the secret to avoiding prob-
lems: If you own or lease the vehicle in your personal name, buy a per-
sonal auto policy. If you own or lease a vehicle in your business name, 
buy a business auto policy. (See the sidebar “Practicing monogamy: 
Why you should only have one insurance agent at a time” for an example 
of someone who did it the wrong way.)
 
✓ If you occasionally borrow or rent vehicles for the benefit of the busi-
ness: If your business is incorporated and occasionally borrows or rents 
vehicles, even if it has no owned or leased vehicles, the business will 
need hired auto liability coverage.
 
✓ If you have employees or independent contractors who even occasion-
ally run an errand for your business with their vehicles: If your business, 
whether incorporated or not, has even one employee or independent 
contractor, you can pretty much count on the fact that the employee will 
at least occasionally run a business errand. And if that’s the case, your 
business will need non-owned auto liability coverage. Both hired and non-
owned coverages are inexpensive — only $60 to $75 each per year.
It’s pretty hard to be in business and not have at least one of those expo-
sures. Add to your list the ones that apply to your business.
Practicing monogamy: Why you should 
only have one insurance agent at a time
I’ve been the business insurance agent for a 
small company for about eight years. I review 
the company’s insurance program every year 
with the company’s owner, Elmer, who has his 
personal insurance through a different agent. 
One year in our review, I discovered that he 
had purchased two company-owned vehicles 
for his and his wife’s use, but he never told me 
because he chose to insure them through his 
personal insurance agent. This decision cre-
ated some serious gaps in his coverage.
The corporation — which, as owner of the vehi-
cles, would be named in every lawsuit involv-
ing the vehicles — had no liability coverage as 
an owner under Elmer’s personal auto policy. 
The corporation, which was the sole owner of 
both cars, had no collision and comprehensive 
coverage. Worse yet, because Elmer had no 
personal ownership interest in either car, his 
personal auto policy would have owed nothing 
at all if either car had been damaged, totaled, or 
stolen! Unbelievable, but true.

Managing Your Human Risks
When I refer to human risks, I’m talking about your life, health, and disability 
risks — all three of which can be substantial. If you worked for someone else, 
things like major medical bills, loss of income from a long-term disability, and 
life insurance for your loved ones would normally be covered. But these risks 
are your responsibility when you own a home business.
 
When you’re working for yourself, make sure that your benefits are at least as 
good as, if not better than, whatever benefits you’d receive as an employee for 
someone else. You should have an equally good retirement plan and vacation 
package, too. If you can’t provide these things for yourself, are you doing 
what’s best for yourself by being self-employed?
You can buy life, health, and disability coverages privately if you qualify med-
ically, or you can buy it under a company group plan if you have employees. 
It doesn’t matter where or how you get these vital coverages. Just get them, 
and add them to your list of risks.
 
If you don’t have employees and you can’t qualify for private health insurance 
because of a preexisting condition, you may be able to get into a group plan 
with an association. (See “Association programs,” later in this chapter, for 
more information.)
See Part V for specific information and recommendations on life, health, and 
disability insurance.
Reducing Your Home-Business 
Risks without Insurance
Avoiding, reducing, retaining, and transferring (ARRT) are the four non-
insurance methods of treating risk. (For more information, see Chapter 3.) 
In this section, I tell you how you can use all four of these non-insurance 
methods in reducing your home-business risks.
Avoiding risk
When it comes to risks related to a home business, you can completely avoid 
the risk in two ways:

181
 Chapter 13: Running a Home Business without Losing Your Shirt
 
✓ By not starting the business or closing your existing business: Odds 
are, you aren’t willing to get out of business just to avoid risk — after all, 
if you’re considering a home business, you’re already not as risk averse 
as most people are, so you’re willing to take some chances to reap the 
rewards.
 
✓ By making prudent business decisions: For example, you may decide, 
if you’re a manufacturer’s representative, to stop offering a line of home 
trampolines because your projected annual profit on the line is $3,000 
and the cost of the product’s liability premium is $10,000.
Reducing risk
 
You can reduce the risk to both yourself and your company in a variety of ways:
 
✓ Reduce the risk of lawsuits threatening your personal assets by incor-
porating your company. Incorporating isn’t for everyone, but I think 
every home business should consider it — with the help of a good small-
business attorney. For more on incorporating, check out Incorporating 
Your Business For Dummies, by The Company Corporation (Wiley).
 
✓ Reduce the inventory you keep on premises. Have the manufacturer 
ship orders directly to your customer.
Retaining risk: Paying for the loss yourself
Retention amounts to paying for the loss yourself. This strategy works well in 
two situations:
 
✓ When you want to reduce your premium by opting for larger deduct-
ibles: For example, you may be able to save 40 percent on your health 
insurance bill by choosing a $2,000 deductible.
 
✓ When you reduce the risk as much as you can and self-insure what 
remains: For example, you may back up your accounts receivable data 
weekly and self-insure any losses that occur between the two backups.
 
There are two other ways to retain losses — neither of which I can recommend:
 
✓ Declining critical insurance: One of my former clients declined long-
term disability on himself. Two years later, he was seriously injured and 
out of work for two years. But with no income and no insurance, he lost 
both his home and his business. Not a good decision.
 
✓ Having a coverage gap without realizing it: Another bad use of reten-
tion is accidental retention, where you have a major uninsured gap in 
your coverage that you don’t know about and a serious loss happens 

182
Part III: Home Sweet Home: Understanding Homeowner’s Insurance 
with no coverage. That’s the worst kind of retention, and it can easily 
occur if you don’t work with an insurance expert. (See Chapter 4 for tips 
on how to find an insurance agent, and turn to the nearby sidebar for 
information on hiring a risk manager.)
 
If your needs are complex, choose an agent who is an insurance expert in the 
area of home-business insurance as well as personal insurance.
Hiring a risk manager: The ultimate strategy
If you want expert help with everything cov-
ered in this chapter — insurance plan design, 
advice on non-insurance strategies, advice on 
business contracts, and even help with insur-
ance you buy elsewhere (such as through pro-
fessional associations) — then this is the very 
best advice I can give you:
 
 Promote the best insurance agent you can 
find to the role of risk manager.
If your state law allows, pay a negotiated annual 
fee — probably ranging from $300 to $600 a 
year — to provide the following value-added 
services to better manage and coordinate your 
business and personal risks. Most of these 
services aren’t paid for by sales commissions 
(hence, the need for an added fee). Your risk 
manager will help you:
 ✓ Place whatever insurance he is able to 
place for you competitively through the 
insurance company or companies he rep-
resents (including your personal insur-
ance; your home-business insurance; and 
your health, life, and disability insurance). 
Why? Because he has more leverage to 
help you get the coverages you need with 
insurers he already has relationships with. 
Also, the insurers send him copies of your 
policies so he can more easily monitor your 
program. And, as an insurance agent, he’s 
empowered to make the changes to your 
insurance program directly, so you won’t 
have to.
 ✓ Come up with creative non-insurance strat-
egies for avoiding, reducing, retaining, and 
transferring risks to help you minimize your 
insurance purchases. Insurance compa-
nies don’t pay agents anything to help you 
lower your insurance costs. The annual fee 
you’re paying him makes it possible for him 
to do this for you.
 ✓ Design coverage specifications for your 
entire personal and business insurance 
program, help oversee the policies you 
buy elsewhere, and coordinate them and 
reduce gaps between them.
 ✓ Help you read your business contracts and 
make recommendations that your attorney 
can use to reduce risks in the language 
before you sign them. Also, modify your 
insurance program as needed to keep your 
insurance coverage in full compliance with 
the insurance recommendations you make.
 ✓ Do a complete review of your entire insur-
ance and non-insurance program about 
once a year and help you implement any 
changes.
I know this is possible because I have been 
acting as a risk manager and insurance agent 
for my small business and personal clients for 
over 20 years. I do all of these things and more 
for them. But I caution you: Even though having 
a risk manager is the ideal solution to managing 
everything that you’re doing, this is an emerging 
field, so finding someone won’t be easy.

183
 Chapter 13: Running a Home Business without Losing Your Shirt
Transferring risk to someone else
Transferring occurs when someone else agrees to pay your claims so you 
don’t have to. The most common way of transferring risk is buying insurance, 
but transferring can also be used in non-insurance ways.
Here’s a good example of a non-insurance use of the transfer strategy: I have 
a client who designed high-end bicycle pedals, sold them on the Internet, 
assembled them himself, and bought an expensive product liability policy. As 
orders grew for the pedals, he subcontracted the production and assembly 
to a local manufacturer, which agreed to do 100 percent of the assembly and 
packaging and, in writing, agreed to add my client as an additional insured 
on its product liability policy. My client thus successfully transferred the risk 
and insurance to a third party (the manufacturer) and significantly reduced 
his insurance costs in the process.
Sources for Home Business Insurance
You can choose from several sources for home-business insurance. Most 
home business owners, at a significant risk to them, mix and match. You 
may be getting your property, liability, and workers’ compensation insur-
ance through your insurance agent. Your professional liability insurance may 
come from an association that you’re a member of. Your product liability 
insurance may come from your franchiser. And your life, health, and disabil-
ity may come from a second insurance agent. I cover the pros and cons of 
each source in this section.
 
Having an expert agent who serves as your personal risk manager is by far and 
away the best choice for you. You’re considerably less likely to get caught in a 
major claim that isn’t covered properly. If that’s not available to you, your 
next best choice is to work with as few agents as possible — again for the 
same reason.
Homeowner’s business endorsements
As a general rule, homeowner’s policy endorsements are inadequate for most 
home businesses — they typically cover only sole proprietorships and often 
can’t cover an incorporated business. They can provide on-premises liability 
coverages, but few provide off-premises liability, products liability, or several 
other kinds of business liability covered in this chapter. Homeowner’s policy 
endorsements can cover business property at home, but most don’t offer 
much coverage away from home.

184
Part III: Home Sweet Home: Understanding Homeowner’s Insurance 
 
In my experience, most homeowner’s home-business endorsements provide 
incomplete coverage, full of gaps.
 
A home-business endorsement is often a great idea for employees of compa-
nies who do a lot of their work at home. If this is your situation, you’ll be glad 
to know that the endorsement typically does a good job of covering your two 
major concerns:
 
✓ Liability coverage for people getting injured on their premises making 
deliveries
 
✓ Personal property coverage on your home office furniture and equipment
See Chapter 11 for more information on how to protect yourself if you’re 
someone else’s employee but you do some work from home.
Business owners’ policies
 
A business owner’s policy is my recommended insurance policy for the major-
ity of home businesses. Business owner’s policies are reasonably priced — 
starting at about $500 per year. (As of this writing, a few policies were even 
available for as little as $300 a year!)
The great thing about business owners’ policies is that they’re designed for 
small businesses. Most of the property and liability coverages you’ll need 
as a home-business owner are either included automatically or available for 
a nominal extra charge. I always prefer business owner’s policies to hom-
eowner’s home-business endorsements — you get far better coverage for not 
much more money.
Not all home businesses, however, qualify for a business owner’s policy. 
Insurance companies differ greatly as to what kinds of home businesses they 
will insure under a business owner’s policy. Some insurers restrict eligibil-
ity to offices and small retail stores; others are willing to insure nearly every 
type of home business, including building contractors, software developers, 
Web site designers, and franchises like Amway or Mary Kay.
 
If you’re told your business won’t qualify for a business owner’s policy, you 
can still get your business insured under a more expensive commercial insur-
ance policy. But before you shell out the extra cash, check around with other 
insurance companies — your business may easily qualify for a business own-
er’s policy somewhere else.

185
 Chapter 13: Running a Home Business without Losing Your Shirt
Insurance from franchisers
If your home business is a franchise — whether you sell cleaning products, 
environmental products, cosmetics, or anything else — you can get some of 
your insurance through the franchiser. Franchisers offer franchisees (that’s 
you!) two major advantages with their insurance programs:
 
✓ A great price for what they offer
 
✓ Access to specialty coverages that would be hard for you to find 
elsewhere
 
But they also have two major disadvantages:
 
✓ The coverage is often not comprehensive for the franchisee. Usually a 
number of holes exist in the coverage. I’ve found large coverage gaps in 
every one of these policies that I’ve reviewed.
 
✓ You don’t get any professional advice to help you set up the right 
coverage for your particular needs. Having expert advice is extremely 
important when buying any insurance, especially business insurance.
Finally, most franchisees buying the coverage believe that if the franchiser 
is offering them the coverage, it must be wonderful — and I’ve never found 
that to be completely true. For the coverages that you’re offered, the price is 
great. But if you work with a good insurance adviser locally who acts as your 
risk manager, you can get the expert help you need to overcome both the dis-
advantages I outline and supplement the franchise insurance program with 
the other insurance coverages you’ll need. You can end up with both a com-
prehensive plan and a very good price, if you have good professional help.
 
If you’re considering getting involved in a franchise, I recommend that you 
first gather all the contracts you will be required to sign, as well as a detailed 
summary of the different insurances available from the franchiser, and take 
them to the insurance professional you’ve chosen to be your risk manager. 
She’ll help you identify the hidden risks of the contracts and the insurance 
gaps in the program the franchiser is offering and help you design strategies 
to avoid both.
Association programs
Professionals in a particular trade often band together to form associations. 
Benefits of belonging include access to information, the chance to net-
work with others in your field, ongoing education, lobbying power, and the 

186
Part III: Home Sweet Home: Understanding Homeowner’s Insurance 
availability of insurance (which is discounted because of mass purchasing 
power). For example, the Freelancers Union (www.freelancersunion.org) 
and Avant Guild (www.mediabistro.com/avantguild) both offer group 
insurance for their members, and many other associations and unions do the 
same thing. Look for one related to your line of work.
Associations are also often a good place to buy professional liability insur-
ance at up to 50 percent off market rates. They’re also a good place to buy 
specialty coverages unique to a particular industry that are unavailable or 
quite expensive in the open market, such as insurance protection against 
unintentional alleged sexual or physical abuse of children (necessary if you 
operate a daycare, for example).
Chambers of commerce
 
If you’re a home-business owner and you don’t have the leverage to get great 
pricing on your own, your local Chamber of Commerce may be a good source 
for small-business group insurance — life, health, and disability products, in 
particular. Often the annual cost of chamber membership is returned many 
times over in premium savings on chamber insurance programs.

Your Homeowner’s Claims

F
ires, tornadoes, hurricanes, hail, burglaries. The only thing harder than 
having a claim for loss or damage to your home or belongings is having 
a claim and having a fight on your hands trying to collect.
In this chapter, I show you what you can expect from your insurance com-
pany when you have a homeowner’s claim and arm you with the tools you 
need to collect everything you’re covered for as smoothly and painlessly as 
possible.
 
Too often, claims are denied or underpaid because you didn’t have the right 
advice or the right coverage in place. Even the best insurance companies 
don’t pay you for something you didn’t have insured. (See Chapters 9 through 
12 for more on how to get the right homeowner’s coverage and Chapter 4 for 
help in choosing a highly skilled agent.)
Structural Damage: Collecting 
What You Deserve
When structural damage is done to your home, your idea of a great insurance 
settlement would go something like this: You close your eyes, turn around 
three times, and open your eyes to a home without damages and with all the 
repairs paid for.

188
Part III: Home Sweet Home: Understanding Homeowner’s Insurance 
Unfortunately, the reality typically goes a bit more like this: The adjuster 
inspects the damage, writes a repair estimate, and sends you the estimate 
and check, minus the deductible. You may be pleased to have the claim 
settled so quickly . . . until you try to find a contractor who will do the work 
for the adjuster’s price — especially difficult after a storm has pushed up 
the costs of labor and materials. You can’t find anyone who will agree to 
do the repairs for the amount of money that your insurance has provided. 
Unfortunately, this problem occurs far too often.
What can you do if you’re in a situation like this, where the adjuster’s esti-
mate and check are well below what a contractor wants for the job? How do 
you get the contractor to bend? How do you get the adjuster to pay more?
Knowing your rights
The “full cost to repair or replace the damage” — that’s what your policy 
says the insurance company has to pay you. Not the amount an insurance 
adjuster thinks the repair should cost. Not what a contractor would like to 
charge. You’re owed the actual repair or replacement cost. The insurance 
adjuster and the contractor who will be doing the repairs need to agree on 
what that price is — these two parties need to meet at the site and hammer 
out a price that they both can agree to.
 
When you settle a home structural damage claim, be sure that your preferred 
contractor agrees, beforehand, to do the repairs for the amount the insurance 
company is offering.
Doing your part to make 
your claim go smoothly
If you just sit back and hope that your insurance company takes care of you, 
you’ll likely be disappointed. Although you have certain rights, you often 
have to fight for them — or at least be assertive enough to make sure that 
you get what you’re paying for.
 
Here are five tips you can follow to ensure a fast and fair settlement, and to 
stay out of disputes on home structural claims:
 
✓ If you don’t already have a contractor you know and trust, get repair 
estimates from at least two contractors who have been recommended 
to you by friends and family. Interview the contractors. You’re not nec-
essarily looking for the lowest bid — you want the best workmanship. 

189
 Chapter 14: Getting What You Deserve for Your Homeowner’s Claims
(You can often tell a lot about the quality of the contractor by the qual-
ity and professionalism of the estimate.)
 
 Use a reputable, local contractor. Watch out for out-of-town journeymen 
who flock to storms in hopes of a good payday. The locals are much 
more likely to be around to stand behind their work if a problem arises 
later.
 
 Check references. Get proof of liability insurance and workers’ compen-
sation insurance. Don’t work with a contractor who doesn’t have both 
coverages. (If a contractor doesn’t show you written proof that he has 
both coverages, you’re more vulnerable to claims brought against you 
for job-site injuries. Plus, if a repair fails and later causes injuries or 
property damage to your home or your family, you can go after the con-
tractor’s liability insurance company.)
 
 Listen to your gut and pick the contractor who feels the most comfort-
able. It doesn’t have to be the contractor with the lowest bid. After all, 
you have to live with the repairs. Most adjusters will work with the con-
tractor you prefer, as long as the prices are reasonable.
 
✓ Don’t allow solo inspections or estimates. Don’t agree to your insur-
ance adjuster inspecting your home alone. Don’t agree to the adjuster 
writing his own estimate. Without an agreed-upon price, the estimate is 
worthless, so don’t allow him to waste his time — or yours.
 
✓ Connect the two parties. Tell the adjuster the name and cellphone 
number of your contractor. Also share the adjuster’s name and cell-
phone number, as well as the claim number, with the contractor. Then 
insist that they call each other to arrange a meeting at your home for the 
purpose of jointly agreeing on the amount of damage and on an accept-
able repair cost.
 
✓ Don’t sweat the dollar amount. Don’t worry if the agreed price is less — 
even significantly less — than the contractor’s initial bid. That’s why 
adjusters have jobs — to make sure that repair costs stay reasonable 
and to keep contractors from writing themselves blank checks.
 
✓ Control additional damage problems upfront. Make sure that when the 
parties meet initially and agree on a price, they also agree to work with 
each other directly if additional damage is discovered — and to keep 
you out of the middle. Then hold them to that commitment. Don’t let 
them suck you in. If your contractor calls needing an okay for additional 
repairs, insist that he work out permission directly with the adjuster.
If you encounter roadblocks or are in danger of pulling your hair out, call on 
your agent for help. Part of your agent’s job is to go to bat for you at claim 
time to help you collect what you deserve.

Jumping over some common pitfalls
Despite your best efforts, you may face one or more common structural 
damage pitfalls. In this section, I help you navigate this sometimes treacher-
ous territory.
But my house is worth more than that! 
Contesting depreciation deductions
 
Most people think their homeowner’s policy pays to rebuild structural 
damage, regardless of the age or condition of the damaged structural parts. 
But the truth is, you only get paid the full replacement cost of partial damage 
to your home if you insure your home for 80 percent or more of its replace-
ment cost. Otherwise, your insurer pays only the depreciated value of the 
damage, up to the insurance limit for your home structure. Essentially, the 
usual homeowner’s policy says, “We’ll pay you in the same manner you 
insure your home. If you insure for the replacement cost, we’ll pay replace-
ment. If you insure based on its used value, we’ll pay for the used value of the 
damage — the value after depreciation.”
Homeowner’s policies allow you to under-insure your home by up to 20 
percent, and they still pay the full replacement cost of the claim for partial 
damage to your structure. If you’re off by more than 20 percent, you risk 
facing depreciation deductions.
What about when you, in good faith, honestly tried to insure for the replace-
ment cost new and the adjuster, at claim time, says that you fell short and 
wants to deduct depreciation from your claim offer? For example, suppose 
your home is damaged by a fire, and the full replacement cost of the damaged 
Getting paid for your sweat
Whether a toilet overflows, a storm damages 
the roof, or a fire destroys the kitchen, you’ll 
personally do some cleanup work — often 
extensive work. In these situations, most hom-
eowners spend personal time doing whatever 
they can to protect their property from further 
damage. In fact, the policy even requires hom-
eowners to protect their property. If you don’t 
do so, the insurance company doesn’t owe 
you for the additional damage you could have 
prevented.
Keep track of your time. The insurance com-
pany owes you fair compensation for it, up to 
the amount it would have had to pay a laborer to 
do the same work. Rarely do adjusters tell hom-
eowners to keep track of the time they spend 
cleaning up after minor incidents or disasters — 
and a lot of homeowners unknowingly lose out 
on justifiable compensation.

191
 Chapter 14: Getting What You Deserve for Your Homeowner’s Claims
area is $100,000. And suppose you had, in good faith, talked to a real estate 
agent or a builder who estimated the cost to rebuild — when you bought the 
house — at $350,000, so you insured it for that amount. Now, suppose that the 
claims adjuster estimates the actual cost to rebuild — at the time of loss — 
at $500,000. Because the difference between the amount for which you’ve 
insured the house and the amount to rebuild it is more than 20 percent, the 
adjuster is offering less than the $100,000 replacement cost of your claim. 
What can you do?
 
You can avoid the penalty in the following ways:
 
✓ Contest the adjuster’s replacement estimate. Adjusters are human — 
they make mistakes. Request a copy of the computation and check it 
for accuracy. Sometimes all that’s needed is a simple correction of the 
data in order to lower the adjuster’s replacement estimate to within the 
acceptable range.
 
✓ If contesting the estimate fails, put together a credible replacement 
cost estimate of your own. Your agent may be able to do one for you, 
or you can pay a credible builder to do one. (You can also do one on 
the Web at sites such as www.building-cost.net. This online esti-
mator is credible because it uses data from the “National Building Cost 
Manual”. I found this site relatively easy to use and probably best of all 
it’s free!)
 
Don’t ever accept a depreciation penalty for under-insuring your home. 
Always contest.
Mismatched mishmash: Coping with the matching 
problem for shingles and siding
In 1998, the Minneapolis/St. Paul area was hit with the worst hail storm ever 
recorded there. In fact, it was the worst storm of any on record for the state 
of Minnesota. It lasted only 15 minutes, but it caused $500 million in damage 
to cars and homes.
The hail typically damaged half a roof, or two of the four walls of a house. 
But, especially for older homes, the new shingles that were available often 
didn’t match an old, discontinued color. And siding from ten years ago wasn’t 
made anymore, so the new, replacement siding didn’t match the color or 
design of the siding on the undamaged walls.
Homeowner’s policies require insurance companies to repair or replace 
only the damaged area. Period. (It’s not an insurance company’s fault that 
a type of roof tile or siding isn’t made anymore — and if they had to pay for 
an entire roof or re-side an entire house every time a few shingles blew off 
or a few siding panels were dented, homeowner’s insurance rates would sky-
rocket.) Most insurance companies didn’t pay for replacing the undamaged 
areas just so it all matched.

192
Part III: Home Sweet Home: Understanding Homeowner’s Insurance 
Insurance policies are supposed to make the customer whole. Having a 
hodgepodge of different roof tiles or two different sets of siding hardly 
restored all those homes to what they were before the storm. There was no 
joy in Mudville.
If you ever have a structural damage claim where the repaired area won’t 
match the rest of the house, here’s how I suggest you proceed.
There is a little-known, seldom-used clause in the back pages of every home-
owner’s policy called the pair and set clause. It’s used primarily to help settle 
personal property claims involving damage to one or more of a set of items 
(one shoe, one stereo speaker, one diamond earring, and so on) where the 
remaining item of the set is worth less because of the loss of the other item. 
The clause recognizes the unfairness of paying for just one shoe or one ear-
ring — the other shoe or other earring loses value, too, without a mate.
The pair and set clause says that if the damaged or lost item cannot be 
replaced exactly, making the set, as a whole, lower in value, the insurance 
company must pay the difference. So, let’s say you have a set of ten collect-
ible dishes worth $6,000. You prominently display just one dish, and keep the 
other nine safely stored away. The dish you display is stolen. The exact dish 
can’t be replaced and, without the dish, the set of nine is now worth only 
$3,000. Applying the pair and set clause, the insurance company owes you 
the $3,000 drop in the total value of the set, even though the lost plate itself 
may have been worth only $600 if you had tried to sell it.
 
Roof shingles are part of a set, as are siding panels. Using the pair and set 
clause, if some pieces of the set of roofing or siding panels are damaged and 
can’t be matched, the insurance company owes more than just replacing the 
damaged area with something that doesn’t match the undamaged area. It 
owes the difference in value, before and after the loss. It’s not any more fair to 
put on mismatched shingles than it is to pay for a new plate that doesn’t 
match the rest of the set.
 
So how do you determine the value of a set of roof shingles before and after a 
loss? The policy doesn’t define that. Here’s my suggestion if you have a roof or 
siding matching problem that you can’t agree on with the adjuster. Using the 
pair and set clause, ask your adjuster to pay the replacement cost of the dam-
aged areas and the depreciated value of the undamaged areas.
 
You don’t have to remember the details of pair and set computations. But do 
remember that a clause in your homeowner’s policy may help you collect 
more than just the replacement cost of your damaged roof or siding if the new 
materials don’t match the old materials.

193
 Chapter 14: Getting What You Deserve for Your Homeowner’s Claims
Collecting for your additional 
living expenses
One of the nice features of homeowner’s insurance is that it pays not only for 
damage to your home and personal property but also for the additional living 
expenses that you have to incur if you can’t live in the house.
The key word here is additional. The additional living expense (ALE) coverage 
pays reasonable costs for temporary living facilities, moving, furniture and 
appliance rentals, and meals out as needed. It can even pay for extra gasoline 
costs. It pays for almost any living expense that truly is additional — it pays 
for any expense that you wouldn’t have had to pay if your home hadn’t been 
damaged. It won’t pay your house payment, because that’s not an expense 
you’ve incurred because of the damage to your home. Any amounts paid are 
offset against living expenses that are lower, such as the heating and cooling 
bill being $75 less a month because the house is empty.
 
ALE pays the difference between your costs that go up and any costs that go 
down. The goal is to keep your bank account the same as it would have been if 
the claim had never occurred.
One of the best things about ALE coverage is the impact it has on an adjuster. 
The adjuster wants to keep ALE expenses low. To do that, she has to get your 
house repaired and livable again, and soon!
Getting Paid for Your Stuff
 
The most important ingredient of a good claims settlement is getting the right 
advice and having the proper coverage. Assuming that your claim is, in fact, 
covered by your homeowner’s policy, here are some tips to help you collect 
the most for your stuff.
Understanding how replacement 
cost coverage works
Most off-the-shelf homeowner’s policies pay for the used or depreciated 
value of your damaged or stolen belongings. But they also offer an addi-
tional cost option called replacement cost coverage, which will pay for the 
cost — new — of all items you actually replace. The thing to know about 

194
Part III: Home Sweet Home: Understanding Homeowner’s Insurance 
replacement cost coverage is that, in order to get a payment based on cost 
new, you have to actually replace the item with something comparable. (You 
can upgrade to a big-screen TV, for example, but you have to pay the cost 
difference yourself — your insurance will only cover the cost of your “little” 
26-inch TV if that’s what was stolen.)
If you opted, wisely, to buy replacement cost coverage, you’ll usually end up 
getting paid two or more times by the insurance company:
 
✓ The first check pays you for the used or depreciated value of your 
property.
 
✓ When you replace what you lost, you get an additional check for the 
difference between the used value and the replacement cost.
 
Don’t let the adjuster forget to add sales tax to all payments in states that 
charge sales tax. It’s easy to overlook, but you’re definitely entitled to it.
Improving the settlement with 
your photographic inventory
If you’ve spent the half-hour it takes to photograph or videotape all your 
belongings and then stored the photos or video away from home, you’ll have 
three major benefits at claim time, especially following a burglary or serious 
fire:
 
✓ You’ll be able to jog your own memory. You don’t get paid for some-
thing you don’t remember to claim. Imagine returning to your home 
after a burglary. Rooms ransacked. Stuff missing. Some you remember 
(the TV, the stereo); some you don’t (the jewelry box, the guitar, the 
baseball card collection, some items of clothing). You’re traumatized 
and not thinking clearly, and then the police and the insurance adjuster 
ask you to list everything that was stolen. I guarantee you that you won’t 
remember everything, and that’s when your photographic record will be 
a huge help.
 
✓ You’ll have a documentation of your loss. Sometimes a property claim 
can be a hassle if the adjuster starts asking for proof of purchase, like 
a receipt or a cancelled check. At best, the experience will be frustrat-
ing. At worst, you won’t get paid for what you lost. Photos help solve 
this problem. Most adjusters accept a photo of the item in your home 
as proof of ownership. Imagine having to prove that you owned a $5,000 
antique cherry desk. Having a picture of the desk in your home, covered 
with your papers, sure would help.

195
 Chapter 14: Getting What You Deserve for Your Homeowner’s Claims
 
✓ You’ll get fully paid for treasures. If your special treasure is destroyed 
or stolen, the burden of proof rests on you to prove what you lost. For 
example, you have to prove that the $20,000 painting that was stolen 
was indeed an original — not just a $1,500 print. (Imagine the poten-
tial fraud if adjusters paid these claims without proof!) Pulling out the 
photos and the original receipt or appraisal enables the adjuster to 
easily pay you the full value. (In fact, when you have the photos and bill 
of sale/appraisal, the adjuster will even pay for a current value appraisal 
and pay you that value.) Documentation is everything at claim time!
See Chapter 9 for tips on making a good photographic inventory.
Collecting faster and better with 
your own inventory form
Here’s how a typical personal property claim goes: The adjuster asks you to 
list what you lost and provide photos, cancelled checks, or receipts. Then 
the adjuster shops around (which can take weeks) and comes back to you 
with an offer. It’s up to you to either accept the offer or contest it. You may 
want to contest the offer if he’s pricing the wrong model of TV, computer, 
or camera; if the clothing prices he uses are from a discount store and you 
bought all your clothes from high-end department stores; or if he’s depreciat-
ing your clothing based on a five-year life, when your high-quality clothes had 
a much longer life.
Most people unhappily take the adjuster’s offer, though possibly getting him 
to bend in a few areas. They don’t know they have rights or how to contest 
the offer. But they do know that after an experienced, knowledgeable adjuster 
has done his homework, it’s difficult to move him from his position. Trust 
me: There’s a better way.
 
Be in charge of your own claim. Do the research yourself. Request the amount 
you want and have solid evidence to support it. Use your own inventory form. 
(The one provided by most insurance companies, if they even provide one, is 
not at all user-friendly, nor is it complete.)
Using either a manual or automated spreadsheet, here are the columns to 
include on your inventory form:
 
✓ Property description
 
✓ Quantity
 
✓ Age (in years)

196
Part III: Home Sweet Home: Understanding Homeowner’s Insurance 
 
✓ Replacement cost source (name of the store or Web site)
 
✓ Telephone number or Web address of store
 
✓ Expected life (in years)
 
✓ Today’s replacement cost (tax included)
 
✓ Depreciation percentage (age ÷ expected life)
 
✓ Depreciation amount (today’s replacement cost × depreciation percentage)
 
✓ Depreciated value (today’s replacement cost – depreciation amount)
 
Making up your own inventory and calculating what is due to you before the 
adjuster does any of his own research is critical. If you’ve already done the 
legwork, he’s less likely to contest your data. All any adjuster needs in order 
to justify paying you what you want for your claim is good documentation 
from you for his file. The adjuster needs documentation so that when his 
supervisor wants to know why he paid you those amounts, he has all the infor-
mation in writing.
The adjuster, upon reviewing your data, will usually do one of two things:
 
✓ Pay what you’re asking.
 
✓ Call you to dicker about a few items. (“You’ve used a 15-year life for 
clothing. We don’t ever allow more than 10 years.”)
There will be some give and take, but no matter how far he moves you from 
your position, it won’t ever be as far as the offer he would have made to you 
if he had done the work himself.

Umbrella Policies 
and More

In this part . . .
M
ost people are way under-insured when it comes 
to lawsuit protection. They buy only $100,000 or 
$300,000 of coverage, which won’t begin to cover the 
value of a serious injury or death they cause. And that’s 
where an umbrella policy comes into play. In this part, I 
explain the three advantages of an umbrella policy, how 
umbrella policies differ dramatically in the scope of their 
coverage, and how to choose an umbrella that covers the 
risks that are unique to your lifestyle.
When there are big changes in your life, your insurance 
should change, too. In this part, I show you what changes 
to make to your insurance program so you stay fully pro-
tected, from the cradle to the grave.

Chapter 15
Introducing the Personal 
Umbrella Policy
In This Chapter
▶ Discovering the three major coverage advantages of an umbrella policy
▶ Understanding how an umbrella policy integrates with your other insurance
▶ Determining how much coverage to buy
You don’t have enough liability insurance. Period. No one does. In over 
2,000 insurance reviews I’ve done for prospective clients, I’ve seen 
that at least 80 percent to 90 percent of them were grossly under-insured for 
injury lawsuits. The most common liability limits on auto and home policies I 
see are either $100,000 per person or $300,000 per accident. That’s not much 
for a human life — not enough to pay for all the medical expenses of the 
person you severely injure, plus a possible lifetime of lost wages and com-
pensation for pain and suffering.
If you don’t have nearly enough protection, what can you do? Here’s some 
really good news: You can buy a second layer of liability coverage, called 
a personal umbrella policy, that sits on top of your other personal liability 
coverages for your car, home, boat, and so on. It defends you and pays legal 
judgments against you when a covered lawsuit exceeds your primary liability 
insurance limits.
Best of all, an umbrella policy is amazingly inexpensive — usually about $150 
to $200 per year for $1 million of coverage. And about $75 to $100 per year for 
each additional $1 million of coverage. Note: This is not a typo. These costs 
are truly per year — not per month!

200
Part IV: Singin’ in the Rain: Umbrella Policies and More 
Buying an umbrella policy is flat-out the best value in the insurance busi-
ness. It includes some of the broadest coverage in the insurance business at 
an incredibly low price. Buying an umbrella policy also satisfies two guiding 
principles from Chapter 2: not risking more than you can afford to lose and 
not risking a lot for a little.
 
Affording an umbrella is easy. You don’t even have to increase your insurance 
bill — just shift dollars away from less important coverages. For example, you 
can save a few hundred dollars by raising the deductible on your car insur-
ance and homeowner’s insurance by $500, or by dropping collision coverage 
on an older car. Use that savings to more than pay for an umbrella policy.
In this chapter, I introduce you to the basics of umbrella policies, fill you in 
on how an umbrella meshes with your other insurance policies, and help you 
determine how much coverage you need.
Discovering the Umbrella Policy’s 
Major Coverage Advantages
If you decide to buy an umbrella policy, you gain more than just higher cover-
age limits for injuries and property damage you cause — although the higher 
limits are a great advantage. You also receive
 
✓ Additional coverage for defense costs when the defense coverage under 
your primary policies runs out
 
✓ Coverage for many types of lawsuits not covered by your other policies 
(those famous coverage gaps everyone complains about)
Additional coverage to defend yourself
What actually happens when you’re sued for a dollar amount greater than 
your primary liability insurance limits? You receive, from your insurance 
company, a piece of mail — probably registered mail — that looks something 
like this:
We Care About You Mutual Insurance Company
Re: Your June 19, 2010 Accident
Dear Mr. Soon-To-Be-Very-Poor:

201
 Chapter 15: Introducing the Personal Umbrella Policy
You are being sued by Mr. James Johnson, the injured party in the above-
referenced accident, for $650,000. Your automobile liability insurance 
limit with us is only $250,000. We will pay your defense costs for the first 
$250,000 of this lawsuit. You will be responsible for your own defense 
costs beyond that amount.
We strongly suggest you hire your own attorney right now to protect you 
for that part of the lawsuit not covered by our policy.
Yours truly,
Grumpy Corporate Attorney
We Care About You Mutual Insurance Company
Why do they send you this letter? Because each of your primary insurance 
policies defends you only for lawsuit amounts up to your liability policy limit. 
If you’re sued for more than your liability limit, you’re personally responsible 
for the amount of any lawsuit that exceeds your primary liability limit, includ-
ing the cost of defense for that difference. Those added defense costs often 
run $75,000 or more. One huge advantage of an umbrella policy is that it pays 
for those added defense costs.
Gap coverage
My client Mike and several of his friends were all turning 50 at about the 
same time, so they decided it would be fun to have a jumbo group 50th birth-
day party. They rented a big barn at an empty local fairground. And they 
decided to make beer and wine available, at no charge, which added a poten-
tial liability for alcohol-related car accidents.
Mike called me because the fairgrounds required the friends to carry $1 mil-
lion of liability insurance for the one-day event that also had to include the 
fairgrounds as an insured party. I asked him if he was signing the rental con-
tract personally. He said no, it was in the name of two of his friends. I advised 
Mike that a one-day, special-event policy would cost about $500. But I also 
advised him that if either of his friends had an umbrella policy, the friend 
might be covered automatically. Neither one of them did. Mike signed the 
contract because he had an umbrella policy that fully covered him for $2 mil-
lion of liability for this type of rental contract. His umbrella also was broad 
enough to automatically protect the fairgrounds, as he had contractually 
agreed to do, and was broad enough to cover the risk of liability for alcohol-
related car accidents.

202
Part IV: Singin’ in the Rain: Umbrella Policies and More 
To briefly explore the insurance issues involved in a little more detail, the 
exposures that Mike faced were
 
✓ Liability for his own actions that caused injuries
 
✓ Liability he assumed in the contract, agreeing to be responsible for the 
actions of everyone else at the event
 
✓ Liability if any partygoer drank too much and caused an auto accident, 
resulting in a lawsuit — a lawsuit that any provider of alcoholic bever-
ages at a social event may face
 
✓ The costs to defend and protect the fairgrounds for any lawsuit brought 
against it
 
✓ Liability for damage caused by anyone to the rented barn, such as a fire 
caused by a guest’s carelessly thrown-away cigarette
Many of these risks were not covered by any other policy, at least not for the 
amount required by the fairgrounds. Mike’s umbrella covered every single 
risk, automatically. His group saved the $500 cost of a one-day policy that 
may not have even covered all five of the risks I just listed. I sent the fair-
grounds proof of insurance, and everybody was happy!
But one little problem remained: On the remote chance that a lawsuit 
exceeded Mike’s $2 million umbrella policy limit, by contract, Mike would 
have been solely responsible for that excess amount. Therefore, each of 
his fellow birthday celebrants separately signed a legal agreement to share 
equally in all losses not covered by the umbrella. By the way, the party was a 
great success!
What’s the point of the story? To illustrate a little-known, major advantage of 
a good umbrella policy. It not only provides a second layer of liability cover-
age on top of your other liability policies, but it also fills a lot of the gaps — 
the gaps between the policies.
A really good umbrella policy covers many of the lawsuits against you that 
aren’t covered by your auto, home, or other personal policies. (See Chapter 16 
for more information on how to determine what your coverage gaps are and 
how to find a good umbrella policy that covers them.)
 
In fact, the only real difference between a poor umbrella policy and a great 
one is how well it covers the cracks.

203
 Chapter 15: Introducing the Personal Umbrella Policy
Coordinating an Umbrella 
with Your Other Insurance
The coverage under an umbrella policy can be triggered when you’re sued 
for more than your primary liability limits. It also can be triggered when 
you’re sued for something covered only by your umbrella and not by your 
primary policies (in other words, the gaps). When the latter happens, the 
umbrella “steps down” and defends and protects you as if it were primary 
coverage, subject only to a modest deductible, called a self-insured retention 
(SIR) — typically, $250 or $500.
In the fairgrounds story (see “Gap coverage,” earlier in this chapter), four of 
the five risks that Mike assumed — the last four risks — were gaps and were 
covered only by the umbrella policy. If any of those four risks occurred, Mike 
would have paid only the $500 umbrella deductible, or SIR.
In this part, I fill you in on how you might need to change your primary insur-
ance to meet umbrella requirements and give you tips for avoiding gaps 
between your primary and umbrella coverage.
One reason that umbrella policies are so inexpensive is that they generally 
don’t cover small lawsuits. An umbrella policy requires that your automo-
bile, homeowner’s, and other personal policy liability limits (also known as 
primary liability limits) meet certain minimum requirements. Depending on 
the insurance company, the minimums vary from about $100,000 to $500,000. 
To get an Umbrella, you must first raise your primary liability limits to these 
minimums and guarantee that you’ll always maintain them. If you violate this 
guarantee and fail to meet these minimum requirements, you’ll be personally 
liable for the difference between what you’ve guaranteed your coverages will 
be and what they actually are.
For example, say that the minimum auto liability coverage needed to obtain 
the umbrella that you have is $500,000, but you’ve allowed your coverage to 
slip to $250,000. If you’re found liable for $700,000 in damages, the umbrella 
policy still kicks in after the first $500,000 has been paid — $250,000 by your 
auto insurance company, and $250,000 by you. (You promised to maintain 
$500,000 of coverage. You broke that promise by carrying only $250,000. You 
owe out of your own pocket the $250,000 shortfall.)
 
Insurance companies offering umbrella policies are not consistent in the 
amount of primary liability coverage that they require. Talk to your agent to be 
sure that your primary coverage always meets your umbrella requirements.

204
Part IV: Singin’ in the Rain: Umbrella Policies and More 
 
Because an umbrella policy requires you to maintain specific primary liability 
insurance limits, you must be aware of very serious dangers:
 
✓ Don’t let any primary policy cancel for nonpayment. If you do and 
you’re sued, you’ll have to pay the loss out of your own pocket, a loss 
that otherwise would have been covered.
 
✓ Pay attention to all notices that come from your umbrella insurer. 
They often require you to raise one or more of your primary coverage 
limits as a condition of keeping the umbrella. If you don’t see or don’t 
read the notice and don’t raise your limits as required, you’ll be person-
ally responsible for the gap.
Determining How Many Millions to Buy
Here’s my bottom-line recommendation (for those of you who read the 
ending of a novel first): Buy $1 million more umbrella coverage than you 
think you need. If you think you don’t need an umbrella at all, buy a policy 
with $1 million of coverage; if $1 million sounds right, buy a $2 million policy; 
and so on.
Most people underestimate the economic value of a serious injury, as deter-
mined by a court of law. Also, an extra million of coverage costs so little — 
around $75 a year. When it comes to catastrophic lawsuits, you’re better off 
erring on the high side. No one ever went bankrupt over a $75 premium.
Reviewing available limits
Personal umbrella policies are sold in million-dollar increments. Most insur-
ers offer a maximum available coverage limit from $2 million to $5 million — 
several up to $10 million. Beyond $10 million, the choices are limited and 
the cost per million escalates because those buying more than $10 million 
of umbrella coverage are generally quite wealthy and highly vulnerable to 
lawsuits.
Assessing how likely you are to be sued
In addition to the seriousness of an injury, there are several factors that influ-
ence not only the likelihood of your being sued for more than the amount 
your policy covers you for, but also the dollar amount of the lawsuit.

205
 Chapter 15: Introducing the Personal Umbrella Policy
Your current financial status factor
The size of your current income and/or current assets, particularly liquid 
assets like investments, affects the probability of your being sued for an 
amount that’s greater than your automobile or homeowner’s liability limits. If 
you have a high income and/or a high net worth, congratulations! You’re very 
suable.
 
I often see people who have only one of the two — a high income or a high net 
worth — overlooking how suable they really are. People like new doctors or 
lawyers in their first year of practice, making almost six figures, but with no 
money in the bank — yet. Or seniors on a modest retirement income but with 
a large, mostly liquid, portfolio. Both types of people are highly suable and 
definitely should have an umbrella policy — probably with limits of $2 million 
or more.
Your future financial status factor
 
If you get a large judgment against you today, for more than your liability 
insurance limits, it sits out there in limbo waiting for your financial situation to 
improve. Most people easily overlook their future suability when they’re 
assessing their need for an umbrella policy. If you’re a medical student, a law 
student, a computer engineer — anyone training for a high-paying career — 
keep this in mind. If you think you may have a lot more money in the future 
than you have today, you need an umbrella policy to cover your liability risks.
The exceptional risk factor
Lawsuits can occur from either activities (such as hunting, fishing, or playing 
sports) or exposures (such as cars, homes, boats, and animals). The excep-
tional risk factor recognizes that one or more of the activities or exposures 
in your life has a greater potential of causing serious injuries or death and, 
thus, more substantial lawsuits. Examples include owning a pit bull, operat-
ing a day-care center, having a swimming pool (especially one with a diving 
board), and having a trampoline in your yard.
If you have these or other exceptional risks in your life that have large 
lawsuit potential, you’re a candidate for an umbrella, even if you’re only of 
modest means.
The legal environment factor
The legal climate in your geographic area is definitely a factor in the size of 
legal judgments and jury awards. In California, where there are a zillion law-
suits for substantial amounts of money, you need a larger umbrella policy 
limit. In rural Arkansas, where the pace is slow, people don’t lock their doors, 
and lawsuits are rare, you may still need an umbrella, but the legal environ-
ment is probably not a factor in how large it needs to be.

206
Part IV: Singin’ in the Rain: Umbrella Policies and More 
Your personal comfort factor
 
Insurance is all about peace of mind. When you decide on an umbrella policy 
limit, do a gut check. If you still feel fearful of possibly not having enough 
insurance, spend an extra $75 and buy another $1 million of coverage.
I’m a good example of this recommendation: I’m your typical middle-class 
American. My income, assets, and other factors suggest that a $1 million 
umbrella policy is about right, but my gut disagrees. I feel a lot better getting 
$2 million of coverage, especially when the extra million only cost me $5 a 
month.
Your moral responsibility factor
Every once is a while, clients remind me of that golden rule about caring 
for your fellow men and women. They’re often of modest means and not 
necessarily very suable. They may not really need an umbrella. I’ll suggest a 
liability limit on their automobile, homeowner’s, and other policies — say, 
$300,000 — and they’ll say, “Oh, no, I want more than that. If I seriously hurt 
someone, I want to make sure he’s fully cared for — that I can provide for 
him by paying all his medical bills, all his lost wages, and pay him something 
extra for all the pain and suffering I put him through. I can’t undo the hurt 
I’ve caused in his life. But at least I can help take care of his financial burden.” 
Such people are rare and wonderful.
Setting your limits: My bottom-line 
recommendations
So you’ve thought long and hard about your own lifestyle, considered all the 
factors that go into deciding to buy an umbrella policy, and now you just 
want a dollar figure. Here are my recommendations for umbrella policies:
 
✓ Buy a personal umbrella policy of at least $1 million.
 
✓ Buy at least $2 million in coverage if you have some affluence.
 
✓ Buy at least $5 to $10 million in coverage, or more, if you’re very affluent.
 
✓ Buy $1 million more than you think you need.
 
✓ Buy a policy that covers the major liability gaps in your primary insur-
ance program (see Chapter 16).

for Your Lifestyle

A
 few years ago, my clients Jon and Mimi did something I’ve often fan-
tasized about: They rented a houseboat with some friends and their 
kids for a ten-day vacation on gigantic Rainy Lake on the Minnesota-Canada 
border. It was a 40-foot floating luxury cabin, propelled by two 125-horse-
power outboard motors, and worth about $300,000.
Jon signed the rental agreement on behalf of the group and was offered insur-
ance for $10 a day from the rental agency, Happy Houseboats. He called me 
to see if his auto or homeowner’s policy covered him. I assured him they 
did not. His auto policy didn’t cover boats (no surprise there). And although 
homeowner’s policies do provide some liability coverage for small, rented 
boats (see Chapter 7), they definitely don’t provide coverage for 40-foot 
houseboats with 250-horsepower motors, nor do they provide coverage for 
damage to the boat itself, regardless of the boat’s size. Jon and Mimi did not 
have a personal umbrella policy at the time.
Jon faxed me a copy of the rental contract and a copy of Happy Houseboats’s 
optional insurance coverage. The risks that Jon and Mimi were facing that 
were completely uninsured anywhere were:
 
✓ Injuries they caused to others (including drownings)
 
✓ Damage they caused to the houseboat itself (up to the $300,000 replace-
ment cost)

208
Part IV: Singin’ in the Rain: Umbrella Policies and More 
 
✓ Damage they caused to all the houseboat furnishings, valued at $50,000 
to $100,000
 
✓ Lost rental income while the damage they caused to the houseboat was 
being repaired
In addition, the contract with Happy Houseboats made them responsible for:
 
✓ Injuries, property damage, damage to the boat, damage to the furnish-
ings, and loss of rental income caused by their friends’ careless driving. 
Scary, isn’t it?
 
✓ All other damage to the houseboat no matter how it was caused, even 
acts of God (meaning that if a tornado tore the boat to shreds, Jon and 
Mimi needed to ante up over $300,000!).
 
As horrible and unfair as this contract is, similar language and obligations are 
found in almost every rental contract you sign. Read your rental agreements 
and make sure you’ve arranged full insurance somehow. Otherwise, avoid the 
risk and don’t rent. Don’t risk more than you can afford to lose (a guiding prin-
ciple from Chapter 2).
Just how good was the Happy Houseboats insurance coverage? The good 
news is that it covered any damage to the boat, no matter how it was caused, 
subject to a $500 deductible. The really bad news is that the most the policy 
would pay was $2,500. (No, that’s not a typo — it was a $2,500 coverage limit 
on a $300,000 boat!) Even the guy behind the counter selling the insurance 
didn’t know it had a $2,500 limit.
Even if the insurance covered damage to the boat without any dollar limit, I 
wouldn’t have advised Jon and Mimi to buy the insurance — because it cov-
ered only the damage to the houseboat. It provided zero coverage for all the 
other liability risks for injuries and property damage to the public. Besides, 
my clients had a far better option — the right personal umbrella policy.
The rotten insurance coverage from Happy Houseboats would have cost Jon 
and Mimi $100 ($10 a day for ten days). I found them a $2 million umbrella 
policy covering all the otherwise uninsured risks for an annual cost of $150. 
Then I did what I recommend you or your agent do in this type of high-risk 
circumstance — I got the interpretation confirmed by the claims department 
of the insurance company. All the risks were indeed covered, subject to a 
$1,000 deductible.
It’s important to know that many umbrellas won’t cover all the risks my cli-
ents assumed in renting the houseboat. Some, in fact, wouldn’t cover any. 
Helping you identify an umbrella policy that covers the special risks in your 
life is the goal of this chapter.

209
 Chapter 16: Choosing the Right Umbrella for Your Lifestyle
Covering the Gaps
A personal umbrella policy has three advantages: higher liability limits, 
extended coverage for defense costs, and gap coverage — coverage for many 
of the lawsuits excluded by primary policies (like the gaps in coverage in the 
houseboat example, earlier in this chapter).
Virtually all umbrella policies are identical in providing higher limits and 
extended defense costs. Where they differ — hugely — is how well they 
cover the gaps in your primary coverage.
The worst umbrella policies don’t cover any gaps. I’ve looked at umbrella poli-
cies from about 30 insurance companies. Two major insurance companies — 
both household names — offer umbrellas that have no gap coverage at all. 
Selling an umbrella without any gap coverage is like selling a car with three 
wheels.
On the flip side, some of the best umbrella policies, with the highest rat-
ings, cover all kinds of gaps but may not cover your unique coverage gap. 
For example, you may have a pilot’s license and occasionally rent planes. 
Because you don’t own a plane, you don’t have aircraft liability coverage. 
This is a big gap. You also have no liability for damage you cause to the 
rented planes. With the price of planes, that is a second huge gap. When you 
select your umbrella policy then, you should be looking for an umbrella that 
covers both of those gaps. Only a few do.
Again, by gaps I mean the liability risks in your life that are not covered by 
your primary insurance policies. Here are just a few possible examples of 
activities you may engage in that aren’t often covered by auto or homeown-
er’s policies.
 
✓ Renting “toys” of all kinds, such as snowmobiles, boats, all-terrain 
vehicles (ATVs)
 
✓ Renting cars outside the United States and Canada
 
✓ Racing sailboats
 
✓ Employing a nurse or nanny
 
✓ Assuming liability when you sign a contract
 
✓ Serving on nonprofit boards of directors
 
✓ Having underground fuel tanks and septic systems
A closer look at these gaps follows, along with the reasons why it’s so impor-
tant to get an umbrella that covers them.

210
Part IV: Singin’ in the Rain: Umbrella Policies and More 
The renting “toys” gap
When you rent “toys” — boats, snowmobiles, ATVs — you’re liable for any 
injuries and property damage you cause to other people and their posses-
sions. You’re also responsible for damage you cause to the rental item, some-
times even when the damage wasn’t caused by you, if the rental contract 
requires it. If you occasionally rent these items, you want to make sure that 
your umbrella policy covers all these risks.
 
Watch out for umbrella coverage on rented boats. Many have length or 
horsepower limitations and don’t cover the type of boat you may rent. For 
example, I occasionally rent sailboats that are up to 30 feet in length. My 
homeowner’s policy covers boats I rent only if they’re under 26 feet, for lia-
bility, and it completely excludes all damage to the boats in my care. So, I 
have an umbrella policy without any length restrictions. If I rent the Queen 
Mary for the afternoon, I’m fully covered — up to my umbrella policy limit, 
that is. (See Chapter 7 for much more on insuring owned, borrowed, or 
rented boats and recreational vehicles.)
The car rental gap
Like rented toys, when you rent a car, you’re liable for injuries and property 
damage you cause to others, and all damage to the rental car, whether you 
caused it or not.
If you rent a car in the United States or Canada, your personal auto policy 
covers you for the first risk — your liability for injuries and damage to the 
public — and sometimes the second risk — damage to the rental car — 
depending on whether you have collision and comprehensive coverage on at 
least one of your cars.
 
If you rent cars even rarely, don’t consider an umbrella that doesn’t cover 
both of these risks (see Chapter 6 for more information on managing car 
rental risks). Most umbrellas do.
When you rent a car in Mexico or abroad, you have the same two liability 
risks as you do in the United States and Canada. The difference is that 99 per-
cent of personal auto policies don’t cover any automobile usage outside the 
United States and Canada. If you’ll ever rent a car outside the United States 
or Canada, make sure that your umbrella policy covers both of these risks 
worldwide.
 
Even if your umbrella covers you, I recommend that, when you’re outside the 
United States or Canada, you buy the optional coverage for damage to the 
rental car from the rental agency and keep your umbrella as a backup. Why? 

211
 Chapter 16: Choosing the Right Umbrella for Your Lifestyle
So you’re not tied up with claim hassles when you return a damaged car. 
Domestic insurance companies are not set up to provide immediate claim ser-
vice in foreign countries.
 
Make sure you have true worldwide coverage. I recently reviewed a “world-
wide” umbrella that excluded lawsuits not filed in the United States! If you 
need worldwide coverage, make sure that’s what your policy gives you.
The contracts gap
Are you aware of how many times you’ve signed a personal contract? Sure, 
car rentals are fairly common, and you may have signed a contract for a vaca-
tion residence. But what about all the others?
For example, when you rent tools and equipment for household projects (like 
the chainsaw you rented to cut up the dead tree in your yard), you sign a 
contract in which you agree not only to be responsible for damage to the tool 
but to pay for an attorney and pay any judgment against the rental company 
for injuries caused while you’re using the tool.
Here’s another example: If you rent facilities for special occasions (like the 
reception hall you rented for your daughter’s wedding), you sign a con-
tract agreeing to be responsible for anything that happens, even injuries or 
damage caused by one of the guests, and you have to defend and pay any 
judgment against the facility owner.
 
I wouldn’t even consider an umbrella that doesn’t cover the liability you take 
on when you sign an equipment or event rental contract.
The nonprofit board gap
Suppose you’re caring enough to serve on the board of directors for your 
child’s youth hockey association. Further suppose that, with the potential for 
head injuries in that sport, the board took on the responsibility of the selec-
tion of the hockey helmet to be worn by the kids. If a child using the helmet 
suffers a head injury because the helmet has a design flaw, everyone would 
be sued — certainly the helmet manufacturer and, most likely, you, person-
ally, and the entire board. Even if you won, you’d be responsible for legal 
fees, which could run into the tens of thousands of dollars. And if you lost, 
you’d also be responsible for your share of the judgment. Your automobile, 
homeowner’s, and other primary liability policies won’t pay a dime. But many 
umbrella policies would completely defend you and, if you lost, pay the full 
judgment against you, subject only to a small deductible.

212
Part IV: Singin’ in the Rain: Umbrella Policies and More 
 
If you serve without compensation on a nonprofit board, one of your criteria 
in selecting a personal umbrella policy should be coverage for your board 
activities. The umbrella coverage isn’t comprehensive — it covers primarily 
injuries or property damage stemming from your activities or decisions. It 
won’t cover other types of lawsuits such as failure to buy the right insurance 
coverage, sexual harassment, wrongful termination, discrimination, and so on. 
But at least you have partial coverage.
 
If you receive any compensation or serve on a for-profit board, the umbrella 
won’t apply. The only way I’d serve on these boards is if the organization had 
in place adequate amounts of directors’ and officers’ (D&O) liability coverage 
and if, in writing, the company agreed to defend me in court and pay any judg-
ment against me for any of my activities stemming from my involvement with 
the board and not covered by the D&O insurance.
The wedding reception contract
My client Kathleen was getting married and 
was busy with the planning. She negotiated 
with a restaurant to host the wedding recep-
tion. After they agreed to the terms, the restau-
rant asked her to sign their standard contract, 
which she faxed to me to see if her home and 
umbrella policies covered her. The contract had 
the usual terms that you can expect: She would 
agree to be responsible for injuries or property 
damage she caused, as well as those caused 
by guests. In addition, she would agree, in the 
event of the restaurant being sued, to protect, 
defend, and pay any judgment against the res-
taurant, no matter what the cause!
In short, by signing the contract, she would be 
agreeing to be responsible for injuries caused 
by the restaurant or its employees. If several 
guests got sick or died, caused entirely by food 
poisoning from the restaurant’s contaminated 
food, she would be agreeing to take the fall for 
the whole thing. Even if her umbrella would 
cover this unjust provision, her $1 million limit 
wouldn’t be enough for that type of multiple-
injury claim.
I advised her to remove that requirement from 
the contract or withdraw from the deal. The res-
taurant’s reaction? It refused to alter the con-
tract. It scoffed and said, “People have been 
signing this same contract for years and no one 
has ever complained before.” (Very scary!) My 
client wisely withdrew from the deal, much to 
the restaurant’s amazement. Two days later, 
the restaurant called her and agreed to add the 
phrase, “except for the negligence of the res-
taurant and its employees,” which solved the 
problem.
This true story has two points:
 ✓ Don’t sign a contract — especially for 
something with as much risk as a wedding 
reception — without reading the contract. 
Preventing the claim is far better than being 
liable for it, even if the claim is covered by 
insurance.
 ✓ Own a personal umbrella policy. Many of 
them cover the numerous obligations you 
take on through the everyday contracts you 
sign.

 Chapter 16: Choosing the Right Umbrella for Your Lifestyle
The company-furnished car gap
 
If your employer furnishes you with a company car, be aware of two possible 
gaps in your liability insurance protection: One has to do with co-workers who 
are injured riding with you; the other has to do with drive-other-cars coverage.
Co-worker injuries
The majority of business auto policies covering your company car exclude 
coverage for you if you injure a co-worker riding with you. The co-worker, 
who was injured on the job, in most cases receives workers’ compensation 
benefits for medical bills and lost wages. But, unless local laws prohibit such 
suits, in addition to the workers’ comp benefits, the co-worker can also sue 
you. The really bad news is that most of the time you have no insurance 
protection. If you have a company car, make sure the umbrella you buy pro-
vides coverage for this serious risk in order to close the gap. (Note: You may 
also need to add extended non-owned coverage to your personal auto policy. 
Check with your agent.)
Drive-other-cars gap
When you’re furnished a company car by your employer, you’re covered to 
drive the car by the employer’s business auto policy. But you’re not covered 
under the business auto policy for cars you borrow or rent personally.
If you have a personal automobile in addition to the company car, skip this 
section. Your personal auto policy already provides coverage when you drive 
borrowed or rented vehicles.
If, however, you have no personal vehicles and, thus, no personal auto 
policy, you’ll have no drive-other-cars coverage. Have your employer add the 
coverage for all family members to her business auto policy, if she’s agree-
able. Most employers will. The small additional cost may be your responsibil-
ity, however.
If your employer won’t add the coverage, the right umbrella policy will cover 
you for two risks you face driving borrowed or rented cars:
 
✓ Your liability for injuries and property damage you cause to the public
 
✓ Your liability for damaging the car itself
 
If you have a company car, make very sure that your umbrella covers both of 
these risks.

214
Part IV: Singin’ in the Rain: Umbrella Policies and More 
The employer’s liability gap
Workers’ compensation insurance pays an employee who is injured on the 
job her medical bills and lost wages in such amounts as required by state 
law, regardless of fault. A second coverage in a workers’ compensation 
policy is employer’s liability coverage, which defends and pays any judgments 
against the employer if the employer is sued for a work-related injury by 
others, such as an employee’s husband who is suing for his loss of his wife’s 
companionship after her on-the-job death.
It isn’t just the wealthy, with their maids and gardeners, who have domestic 
help and need to buy workers’ compensation and employer’s liability insur-
ance. For example, many elderly or disabled people hire personal-care atten-
dants. And it’s not just the wealthy who hire nannies these days.
What if you’re sued as a result of causing an employee’s injury, for more than 
your employer’s liability coverage limit? You’ll want additional coverage from 
an umbrella policy. The majority of umbrella policies do not include addi-
tional employer’s liability coverage. A few, however, do.
 
If you have an employee or if you have a workers’ comp policy for whatever 
reason, employer’s liability coverage should be in the umbrella you choose.
The pollution gap
Most liability policies these days exclude coverage for your liability for pollu-
tion. Two types of pollution can result in a lawsuit against you — immediate, 
accidental pollution (such as your underground fuel tank springing a leak and 
emptying into the surrounding soil), and gradual pollution (such as seepage 
from that tank over months or years).
The consequences of either can be severe — having to pay all cleanup costs, 
which can run into the tens of thousands of dollars, as well as potentially 
massive fines and penalties. So this is a pretty serious risk. (See the sidebar 
“The underground heating oil disappearing act” for an example of how this 
gap may affect you.)
To the best of my knowledge, no umbrella covers the seepage kind of pollu-
tion. The good news is that some do cover pollution that’s both sudden and 
accidental.
 
If you have pollutants stored on your premises, especially underground, add 
pollution coverage to your umbrella shopping list.

215
 Chapter 16: Choosing the Right Umbrella for Your Lifestyle
Creating Your Own Gap Checklist
Before you can go in search of the umbrella policy that best fills the gaps 
in your primary coverage, you need to be able to intelligently communicate 
your needs to an insurance agent or company.
To help you do that, I’ve created a checklist (see Table 16-1). I guarantee you 
that it does not include every conceivable gap in liability insurance coverage. 
But if you use the checklist, it’ll lead you to an umbrella policy that covers all 
or most of the gaps on the list for which you’re currently uninsured.

The underground heating oil disappearing act
My clients Desi and Lucy called one day quite 
upset. They had no heat in their home even 
though, the day before, they had their under-
ground heating oil tank filled to the top. They 
had no way of quickly proving it, but they 
guessed that their tank had sprung a leak and 
150 gallons of heating oil had spilled into the 
ground. Being good citizens, they immediately 
reported it to the local pollution control people 
who, instead of expressing their gratitude for 
Lucy and Desi’s good behavior and immediately 
beginning a cleanup, told them that they were 
financially responsible to pay all cleanup costs, 
which could become massive if the oil reached 
underground waters.
Homeowner’s policies almost universally 
exclude pollution liability. And my clients had 
declined umbrella coverage. Desi and Lucy 
were lucky this time. The oil never reached 
water. But they were out a few thousand dol-
lars in legal fees and excavation and cleanup 
costs. Some umbrella policies would have paid 
all costs, subject to a small deductible.
The moral: If you have a fuel tank on-premises, 
especially underground, get an umbrella with 
pollution spill coverage. And if possible, reduce 
the risk significantly by not putting the tank 
underground. Keep it above ground, where 
leaks and seepage can be noticed and fixed 
immediately.

Considering your coverage: 
Mandatory versus optional
The mandatory portion of Table 16-1 includes exposures that are so common 
that each of them should be covered even in the most basic umbrella policy. 
Some insurance companies argue that coverage for punitive damages — extra 
damages awarded by a jury for gross negligence (like driving drunk even after 
your license has been suspended for drunk driving) — aren’t important if you 
live in a state banning punitive damage awards. I disagree because people 
travel to other states. The state you’re traveling in may allow punitive dam-
ages, so you need that coverage.
Umbrella policies differ the most in the area of optional coverages. For exam-
ple, many provide poor coverage on rented boats, extending coverage to only 
small boats and boats with small motors. In the land of 10,000 lakes, that’s a 
very undesirable restriction. If you live in Minnesota, or any other state with 
a lot of boating, or if you occasionally rent boats no matter where you live, I 
recommend that unrestricted boat liability using non-owned or rental boats 
be a mandatory part of your umbrella coverage.

218
Part IV: Singin’ in the Rain: Umbrella Policies and More 
Another example: Many umbrella policies — and even boat policies 
themselves — exclude coverage for any liability incurred while racing 
a sailboat. If you race or even crew, you need your umbrella to cover 
this risk.
Yet another example: If you take some work home and have a home office, 
your homeowner’s policy should include an incidental office endorsement 
(see Chapter 11 for the reasons why). Your umbrella must also be amended 
to include incidental office liability coverage or you’ll have a gap. “But what 
if I own my business and run it from home?” you ask. A personal umbrella 
won’t help (see Chapter 13 on insuring a home business).
Finally, some companies offer excess uninsured and under-insured motor-
ist coverage (see Chapter 5). This protection covers medical costs that you 
and your passengers incur from a car accident caused by a driver with less 
liability coverage than the economic value of your injury. It’s extra coverage 
that pays only if the value of your injuries exceeds the uninsured and under-
insured motorists coverage on your auto insurance policy. It’s great coverage 
to have if you’re seriously hurt, but give it less priority than your uninsured 
lawsuit gaps. If you can cover all your uninsured gaps in an umbrella, that 
also makes uninsured and under-insured motorist coverage available — and 
if your budget can handle it, I recommend you take it.
Using the checklist
If you’re going to buy an umbrella policy, you want one that covers the 
activities you actually engage in, right? You would never buy an auto policy 
that covered you Monday through Friday and excluded weekends. But 
that’s exactly the type of umbrella policy that most consumers buy and 
agents sell — a policy that may leave you high and dry at claim time.
This chapter is all about getting those weekends covered. Here’s how the 
umbrella checklist can help. Check off any of the optional coverage areas 
(gaps) that apply to you and begin the hunt for the right policy. Be fore-
warned — the insurance marketplace won’t be prepared for you. When you 
hand out your checklist to prospective agents, most will be surprised. No 
one has ever bought an umbrella policy from them in this fashion before. 
All agents, including me, don’t know off the top of their heads how their 
umbrella policies will fill those gaps you’ve checked, so you probably will 
need to leave a copy of the checklist with them. That’s reasonable. This is a 
complex issue to be handled with care.

219
 Chapter 16: Choosing the Right Umbrella for Your Lifestyle
 
By the way, how your agent deals with your request is, in my opinion, one of 
the best tools to help you select a great agent. Pay attention to how knowl-
edgeable prospective agents are in discussing your particular gaps. If an agent 
seems annoyed at the request, appears confused by it, or is clearly not knowl-
edgeable about the gaps, find another agent. (See Chapter 4 for tips on select-
ing a good agent.)
Buying the Policy
Here are the three most common mistakes people make when buying a per-
sonal umbrella policy:
 
✓ They buy their auto and home policies first and then buy the umbrella 
from the same insurance company. In short, the mistake is settling for 
whatever umbrella comes with the auto and home policies, no matter 
how poor it may be. Note: Buying your policies from the same agent is 
usually a good idea, but automatically buying them from the same com-
pany is a bad idea if you want the best umbrella policy (as the next 
bullet points out).
 
✓ They buy their umbrella policy from a different agent than the one 
who sold them auto and home insurance. The damage occurs because 
the two agents don’t communicate, leaving you very vulnerable to gaps 
between your primary and umbrella coverages.
 
✓ They buy their umbrella on price and ignore coverage. This usually 
happens because they think all umbrellas are the same and because 
they don’t realize the importance of gap coverage. They’re unaware that 
they even have gaps.
 
The three antidotes to these mistakes are building your insurance program 
starting with the umbrella policy first, keeping your primary and umbrella cov-
erages with the same agent, and considering price last rather than first. Here’s 
more information on each one of these three.
Buying your umbrella policy first
If your only reason for having an umbrella policy is to get higher liability 
limits on your automobile and homeowner’s policies, and if you don’t have 
any concerns about gap coverage, taking the umbrella that comes from the 
insurer of your auto and home is fine. Taking that umbrella is also fine if it 
covers all the gaps in your umbrella checklist (unlikely but possible).

220
Part IV: Singin’ in the Rain: Umbrella Policies and More 
 
But if you want an umbrella that plugs as many of your liability insurance gaps 
as possible, the best way to build your insurance program is to start at the top 
with the umbrella policy and decide on that policy first, before you buy auto 
or home insurance. Here’s why: Due to the small premiums and increased risk, 
many insurers don’t even offer an umbrella policy unless they insure your 
home and auto, too. If your home and auto insurance is already set up with 
Company A, but that company has an umbrella that doesn’t suit your needs, 
and you discover that Company B and Company C both have umbrella poli-
cies that cover all your gaps but they require your car and home insurance, 
you’ll have to cancel and move your auto and home insurance — a lot of 
unnecessary work to get the umbrella you need.
If, on the other hand, you compare umbrellas first, you’ll logically narrow 
down your choices to either Company B or Company C. You can then com-
pare the prices of each company’s auto and home policies and go with which-
ever of the two has the best total price. You may pay a little more for the 
whole program than you would have paid if you used Company A, but when 
you’re navigating across the ocean of life, how much more will you pay for a 
boat that won’t leak or sink?
Pick an agent, any agent
For the record, there are two types of insurance 
agents:
 ✓ Those who represent one insurance com-
pany only — often referred to as exclusive 
agents, captive agents, or direct-writer 
agents
 ✓ Those who are free to represent more than 
one company — usually referred to as 
independent agents
Exclusive agents include those who repre-
sent insurance companies like State Farm, 
Farmers Insurance Group, or Liberty Mutual. 
Independent-agent insurance companies 
include national insurers like Safeco, Hartford, 
and Chubb, and most regional insurance com-
panies (such as Harleysville, Auto-Owners, and 
Cincinnati).
Which type of agent is better for you? The best 
insurance agent you can find is the one who 
can get you the coverage you need. Whether 
he’s independent or exclusive makes no dif-
ference. The only real difference when trying 
to buy the right umbrella is convenience. If 
the exclusive agent you prefer offers only one 
umbrella choice that excludes coverage for 
a lot of activities you’re exposed to, you’ll be 
forced to buy your umbrella policy elsewhere. 
In contrast, the independent agent, by having 
more than one umbrella option, increases your 
chances that you won’t have to seek another 
agent to get the coverage you want. But even 
the independent agent may not have in his port-
folio the best umbrella policy for your needs.
Great advice. Great coverage. That’s all that 
matters.

221
 Chapter 16: Choosing the Right Umbrella for Your Lifestyle
Buying your insurance from 
the same agent or company
If you buy your primary and umbrella liability coverage from the same 
insurer, your insurance coverage fits together better with less chance of a 
gap (Legos and Legos versus Legos and Tinkertoys) than if you split your 
policies between two or more insurance companies.
If you do buy all your polices from different insurers but at least from the 
same professional agent, whatever gaps could exist between your policies 
can be reduced or prevented with the help of the agent. For example, sup-
pose that you have auto and home insurance through Company A and your 
umbrella through Company B but all your policies are through the same 
agent. Now suppose you add an incidental office at home and add the appro-
priate homeowner’s endorsement to cover injuries to delivery people. Your 
astute agent will know that your umbrella won’t extend to that office without 
a special amendment. She will then add that amendment and, thus, avoid a 
potentially serious gap. If you had the umbrella with a different agent, the 
umbrella agent would never have been notified, and you’d have that gap.
 
To reduce the chance of gaps between policies, keep your auto, home, 
umbrella, and other personal liability policies together — ideally, with the 
same agent and the same insurance company.
Placing coverage and financial 
strength before price
Do not make your umbrella decision on the price of the umbrella alone. You 
could end up comparing a Hyundai to a Hummer.
Start with selecting the umbrella policies that best cover the gaps you 
listed on your checklist (see “Creating Your Own Gap Checklist,” earlier in 
this chapter). Then make sure the insurer is strong financially (see the side-
bar “Measuring insurer strength”). You don’t want them going belly-up in 
the middle of a lawsuit against you. Then and only then look at the umbrella 
pricing — but only as a part of the pricing of the whole insurance program.

222
Part IV: Singin’ in the Rain: Umbrella Policies and More 
Measuring insurer strength
Why is insurer strength so important when 
purchasing a personal umbrella policy? Don’t 
states have an insurance guarantee fund pro-
tecting consumers against insolvency? Yes, 
most states do have such a consumer protec-
tion fund. But few such funds go as high as $1 
million or more. Minnesota’s limit, for example, 
is $300,000. But even if the fund limit were high 
enough, collecting from it is a long, drawn-out 
process — hardly the kind of stress you want in 
the middle of a lawsuit against you.
Several organizations rate insurance compa-
nies. The one with the longest track record — 
and a great reputation — is A. M. Best, which 
assigns insurers a strength rating from A++ 
to C, much like school grades. (See www.
ambest/ratings/definition.html 
for an explanation of the ratings.) If you want 
more information on an insurer you’re con-
sidering, go to www.ambest.com and click 
Ratings & Analysis); there, you can get a wealth 
of information on any company. I don’t recom-
mend buying an umbrella from any insurance 
company with an A. M. Best rating below A 
(in other words, a B+ or worse) unless it’s 
unavoidable.

When Your Life Changes
In This Chapter

W
hen you experience a major life change, you need to change your 
insurance coverage. The insurance plan you had before the change 
often won’t cover some of the new risks you’ve taken on during and after the 
change. Under the standard homeowner’s policy, you have no coverage for 
any of the following incidents:
 
✓ You’re sued for $350,000 for injuries to three guests at a party your son 
hosted in his apartment — the apartment you helped him qualify for by 
cosigning the lease.
 
✓ You’re remodeling your home, and a carpenter is injured when his own 
scaffolding collapses. The accident is no fault of yours, whatsoever. But 
you’re sued for workers’ compensation benefits of $200,000 — $120,000 
for medical bills and $80,000 for lost wages.
 
✓ In the same remodeling job, $25,000 of heating and air-conditioning 
equipment, sitting in your yard and about to be installed, is stolen in the 
middle of the night.
 
✓ You’re sued for $75,000 for damage to the furnishings of the condomin-
ium below your aging mother’s condo, caused by water overflowing from 
a tub she was filling and forgot about. Your mother, on her attorney’s 
advice, had just transferred ownership of her condominium to you.
These scenarios are just a few examples of possible serious, uninsured 
claims, all of which originate as the result of a significant change in your life. 
In this chapter, I show you how to manage the insurance risks of life’s more 
common changes — from the cradle to the grave.

Goin’ to the Chapel: Getting Married
From getting engaged up to the wedding ceremony, you face special risks. In 
this section, I give you some strategies to help you manage them.
Getting engaged
If a valuable ring is involved in the engagement and you want it insured in 
case it’s lost or stolen, you should schedule it as an addendum to a hom-
eowner’s or renter’s policy. A basic homeowner’s policy provides little or no 
jewelry coverage, especially for the loss of a diamond or other gem, so the 
ring must be scheduled. If you already have the wedding rings and if they 
have any value, you may want to schedule them as well. (See Chapter 10 for 
more information on scheduling jewelry.)
Generally, the ring should be insured under the policy of its owner. If the 
owner still lives with her parents, add the ring to her parents’ homeowner’s 
policy. If the owner rents but has no renter’s policy, it’s time to get one (see 
Chapter 9).
Living together before marriage
 
Set up a homeowner’s or renters policy in both names. If you buy the insurance 
under only your name, your partner has no personal liability coverage under 
your policy for activities — such as injuring someone while playing racquet-
ball. Plus, your partner’s personal belongings won’t be covered. Both of your 
names need to be on the policy in order for both of you to be protected.
Move both your car insurance policies to the same insurance company and 
buy the same liability limits on each policy. Why? Because your personal 
auto policy won’t cover you while you’re driving your partner’s car. (It 
excludes coverage on cars you have regular access to.) Being insured with 
the same company assures you that your policy terms will be identical, no 
matter which car you drive — which will also make for a far easier claim 
experience. Buying the same liability limits assures that the same amount of 
money will be available to each of you for lawsuits regardless of which car 
you’re driving. If you buy $300,000 of coverage and your partner has $50,000 
of coverage, when you drive your partner’s car the only coverage you have 
is his $50,000. The only way you can get $300,000 of coverage, when you live 
together, is for him to have the same $300,000 liability coverage as you have. 
If your partner won’t agree to the same coverage, don’t ever drive his car.

225
 Chapter 17: Changing Your Insurance When Your Life Changes
 
Some auto insurance companies offer an optional coverage called extended 
non-owned liability coverage, which extends your coverage to his vehicle, and 
vice versa. If your insurer offers it, add it to both policies. It’s not expensive.
Tying the knot
 
After you get married, set up homeowner’s or renter’s insurance in both 
names (see Chapter 5). Make sure the property limit is high enough to cover 
your belongings as well as your wedding gifts. Also, combine your vehicles on 
one car insurance policy (see Chapter 5 on buying car insurance and Chapter 9 
on buying homeowner’s or renter’s insurance.).
If you’re both working, continue your group health coverage if it’s pro-
vided to you by your employers. If one of you doesn’t have health coverage 
through work, add the uninsured spouse to the insured spouse’s group 
policy. You generally have 30 days from the wedding date to do so without 
having to qualify medically (prove that you’re in good health). After 30 days, 
you can be declined due to poor health. (See Chapter 18 for advice on buying 
individual health insurance.)
Make sure you have enough life insurance to pay for a funeral and other final 
expenses. Most jobs include enough free life insurance to cover these costs. 
If one of you has life insurance through work and the other one doesn’t, add 
the uninsured spouse onto the insured spouse’s group policy. You can also 
buy an individual policy. (See Chapter 23 for tips on estimating your life 
insurance needs.)
 
Be sure to change the beneficiaries on all life insurance policies — individual 
or group — to each other.
Don’t overlook long-term disability insurance, especially if you need two 
incomes to make ends meet (see Chapter 22).
 
Be careful of contracts you’re asked to sign related to the wedding reception. 
Make sure the terms are reasonable. I had one client show me a restaurant 
rental contract where the wedding party had to agree to be responsible not 
only for injuries they caused, but also for injuries the restaurant caused — like 
food poisoning. Sign something like that, and you’ll be in deep trouble — with 
the possibility of no insurance — if a guest is injured at the reception! It’s a 
good idea to have an attorney review contracts like this, before you sign them, 
where there are substantial risks. You’re better off changing the location of 
the reception than paying thousands of dollars to defend and pay judgments 
against the restaurant for its negligence. Check with your agent to make sure 
that your personal liability coverage — home and/or umbrella — will protect 
you if you do get sued for injuries or property damage at the reception.

Measure Twice, Cut Once: Building 
or Remodeling a Home
Whether you’re building your dream home or remodeling your current one, 
you’ve taken on a lot of additional risks, many of which are not automatically 
insured. Enjoy the excitement, but make sure that your insurance is adequate 
for the new risks in your life.
Here’s a list of some of those risks and how I recommend you handle them:
 
✓ Property damage to new construction from fire, wind, vandalism, and 
so on: If you’re building a new home, have a clear understanding with 
the builder, in writing, as to who is responsible for the property insur-
ance. Make it a requirement that the party who buys the insurance also 
names the other party as loss payee. Require that proof of the insurance 
be provided prior to the start of construction. If you, as the homeowner, 
are responsible for the insurance, buy a homeowner’s policy rather than 
a builder’s risk policy. Homeowner’s coverage is much more compre-
hensive and includes, at no extra charge, liability coverage for job-site 
injuries.
 
 If you’re remodeling, increase your homeowner’s building-coverage 
limit, at the time the work starts, to the revised cost to replace your 
home with the improvements.
 
✓ Theft of building materials: Normally materials aren’t covered until 
they’re installed in your home. Either contractually require the contrac-
tor to be responsible for all materials until they’re installed, or add a 
theft of building materials endorsement to your homeowner’s policy and 
delete the endorsement when everything is installed.
 
✓ Lawsuits from job-site injuries: These are usually covered by your 
homeowner’s policy, but this is a good time to reevaluate your personal 
liability limits. Consider adding an umbrella policy if you don’t already 
have one (see Chapter 15). Also, in your construction contract, require 
the contractor to defend you and pay any judgment against you for 
injuries or property damage he or his crew cause. Request proof of the 
contractor’s general liability insurance before work starts. If he doesn’t 
have insurance, you’re much more apt to be sued yourself if someone 
gets hurt.
 
✓ Workers’ compensation claims filed against you for medical bills and 
lost wages from any worker injured on the job: This risk is not covered 
by your homeowner’s policy. Require written proof from your contrac-
tor that he has workers’ compensation insurance covering all workers 

227
 Chapter 17: Changing Your Insurance When Your Life Changes
before any work starts. Run all labor costs — even if you’re paying your 
friends to chip in — through the contractor, so that you’re not at risk for 
anyone’s injuries.
 
 Another option is to buy your own workers’ compensation policy for the 
period of construction, especially if you’re acting as your own general 
contractor.
 
 
 Don’t start new construction without someone — you or the contractor — 
having workers’ compensation insurance in place.
 
✓ Injuries and property damage that happen to you or your home after 
the work is completed: For example, the furnace blows soot through 
the house, a defective fireplace causes a major building fire, or the roof 
leaks from a defective installation. Require in your construction contract 
that the contractor provide you proof of general liability insurance, 
including completed operations coverage, which covers this kind of 
claim. If there are injuries or damages later, you may have a source of 
insurance to collect from.
 
✓ The contractor skipping out and not paying subcontractors, who then 
file liens against your property: Require the contractor to get lien waiv-
ers signed by all subcontractors prior to your paying for the work. Or, if 
he’s not agreeable to that, pay the subcontractors directly.
 
✓ Misunderstandings between you and the contractor, causing significant 
frustration and financial loss: Always work with a contract and a good 
attorney. Incorporate into the contract the issues addressed in this list!
And Baby Makes Three: 
Becoming a New Parent
When you’re expecting the birth of your first child, it’s time to revisit three 
types of insurance that may need to be changed:
 
✓ Health insurance: Under many health plans, newborns cease to be cov-
ered 30 days after birth unless you notify your health insurance company 
within that 30-day period requesting that your child be added to your 
coverage — so call the insurance company. And don’t wait 30 days — call 
immediately. If you’re married, you may have a choice between the moth-
er’s policy and the father’s policy. If you do, compare costs, features, and 
the freedom to choose doctors. (See Chapter 18 for the most important 
elements of a great health insurance plan.)

228
Part IV: Singin’ in the Rain: Umbrella Policies and More 
 
✓ Life insurance: This may surprise you, but insuring your child isn’t the 
most important issue. Instead, when a child is born, you have to buy 
or significantly raise your own life insurance protection to make sure 
that the baby will be protected if you die. Don’t forget to insure the 
homemaker if one of you will be staying home. This is also a good time 
to reassess life insurance beneficiaries and change your contingent ben-
eficiary to “all surviving children” instead of “my brother Ralph.” (See 
Chapter 23 on how to determine life insurance needs.)
 
✓ Disability insurance: If you’ve put off buying this coverage, now is a 
good time to rethink your decision. The loss of a paycheck would be 
a bigger hardship now that you have a new baby. (See Chapter 22 for 
more on disability insurance.)
A Spoonful of Sugar Helps the Medicine 
Go Down: Hiring a Nanny
You’ve recently become proud parents. As soon as you found out you were 
expecting, you probably started considering your child-care options. Do you 
put the baby in daycare, or do you hire a nanny to care for your child in your 
home?
If you go the nanny route, you have a couple options: You can hire a nanny 
through a professional nanny service, which costs quite a bit more but has a 
number of advantages:
 
✓ The agency screens candidates and checks references for you.
 
✓ The agency provides temporary nannies to fill in when your nanny is ill 
or takes a vacation or simply doesn’t show up.
 
✓ The agency carries liability insurance in case one of your children is 
injured in the nanny’s care. (Most self-employed nannies don’t have any 
liability insurance.)
 
✓ The agency carries workers’ compensation insurance covering the 
nanny if she’s injured on the job, regardless of fault. This significantly 
reduces the chance of the nanny suing you for a job-related injury.
 
✓ The agency does all the withholding, pays all the payroll taxes, and 
issues the paychecks to the nanny so you don’t have to.
 
Not all nanny services provide all these benefits, so make sure you understand 
what you’re getting into before you sign on the dotted line.

229
 Chapter 17: Changing Your Insurance When Your Life Changes
A second option is to hire your own nanny. You can hire her as an indepen-
dent contractor, a common approach but one that has liability and potential 
tax consequences that aren’t, in my opinion, worth taking. A better and safer 
choice is to hire your nanny as an employee. Yes, you’ll need to cut her a 
paycheck and do some withholding. And, depending on what state you’re in, 
you may need to buy workers’ compensation insurance for her. (Check with 
your state’s department of labor for information on workers’ compensation 
requirements for domestic employees. Many states exempt you from having 
to provide the coverage for a single employee.)
If you’re required to buy workers’ compensation insurance, you benefit in 
two ways:
 
✓ The nanny is prohibited by law from suing you if she gets hurt on 
the job.
 
✓ The nanny can collect for her medical bills and lost wages from your 
workers’ compensation policy, regardless of how it happened.
 
For more information on household employees and the IRS rules, go to www.
irs.gov/publications/p926/index.html or call 800-829-3676 and 
request Publication 926: Household Employer’s Tax Guide.
If your nanny will be driving your child or picking them up as part of her 
duties, your child could be injured in a car accident caused by the nanny’s 
negligence. Here are some steps you can take to protect yourself and your 
child before you hire the nanny:
 
✓ Get her signed permission to check her driving record. Request her 
driver’s license number and vehicle plate number. Then provide both 
numbers and her signed permission to your auto insurance agent and 
request her driving and accident records. If her record isn’t clear for at 
least three years, look into other candidates.
 
✓ Get proof of her automobile insurance liability coverage if she uses 
her own car. Make sure both her liability coverage and uninsured/
under-insured motorists coverage are at least $300,000. If not, ask her 
to increase them to at least that level. Offer to pay the additional cost if 
need be. The cost for extra liability coverage is very small — $50 to $100 
a year tops.
 
✓ Add her as an occasional operator to your car insurance if she’ll be 
using your car regularly.

2004 with the then–Nanny of the Year, Michelle LaRowe, called “Finding and 
Hiring a Nanny.”

Go West (or East or North or 
South), Young Man! Moving
Moving is nearly always a huge undertaking, full of heavy lifting, hard work, 
and a year’s worth of stress. The last thing you want to think about when 
you’re planning a move is insurance, but if you overlook insurance, your 
move may be even more stressful than it already is. When you move, your 
belongings may be in storage or in transit for some period of time. If your 
new home is ready for move-in right away, your belongings will, at the very 
least, be in transit on the moving truck for however long it takes to get from 
your old home to your new one. And if your new home isn’t ready yet, your 
stuff may be in storage for days, weeks, or even months. If your things are in 
storage, you may have to live in a motel with some of your belongings.
Here’s what I recommend: First, to cover your personal property that’s in 
transit and/or in storage, don’t cancel the homeowner’s or renter’s policy 
insuring your old home. Then, manage your risks as follows:
 
✓ Property being moved while in transit: Basic homeowner’s insurance 
covers only specific losses like collision and theft. It won’t cover all 
losses, such as breakage of furniture and electronics from load shifting. 
So add special perils contents coverage to your homeowner’s policy, 
insuring the contents in the home you’re leaving. This special form 
covers almost any loss outside of a few exclusions such as breakage of 
fragile items (dishes, crystal, and so on). If you want fragile items cov-
ered for breakage, you’ll need to schedule them. (Or pay the movers to 
do the packing and buy breakage coverage from them.)
 
✓ Property in storage: Basic homeowner’s policies do cover, in full, all 
personal property in a locked storage facility up to the contents policy 
limit. But the types of losses covered are limited to fire, wind, vandalism, 
theft, and so on. No coverage exists, for example, for water damage from 
roof leaks or groundwater damage of any kind. To cover yourself, add 
special perils contents coverage, which covers almost all losses, includ-
ing water damage from roof leaks. Although it excludes groundwater 
damage at home, it covers groundwater damage away from home, such 
as for items in storage.
 
✓ Property at your temporary location: Your homeowner’s policy covers 
any property you have with you in a temporary location up to the con-
tents policy limit for up to 30 days. Beyond 30 days, coverage drops to 
10 percent of the policy limit on contents. If you’re going to be in that 
location longer than 30 days, you don’t need to make special insurance 
arrangements to cover your stuff if you’re okay with the 10 percent limit. 

231
 Chapter 17: Changing Your Insurance When Your Life Changes
If you’re not, ask your agent to negotiate an extension for the time you 
need. Or, if that fails, buy renter’s insurance. (If you’re storing most of 
your stuff, the 10 percent limitation is usually plenty for whatever you 
have with you.)
 
✓ Damage to the moving truck, if you decide to move yourself. In the 
rental contract you sign, you’re liable for anything — even storm 
damage. Coverage is available from the rental agency, but it’s expensive. 
My suggestion is to decline coverage from the rental agency, if you have 
both collision and comprehensive coverage on at least one of your cars. 
The coverage you have on your own car will transfer to the truck. If you 
don’t have the coverage, either have your agent add the coverages to 
your car insurance policy or buy the coverage from the rental agency.
 
 Many car insurance policies limit this coverage to trucks with a gross 
vehicle weight rating not exceeding 10,000 pounds. Ask the rental 
agency how much the truck weighs, and if it exceeds 10,000 pounds, call 
your agent to see if your policy has that 10,000-pound limitation. If it 
does, buy the coverage from the rental agency.
 
✓ Liability when operating the rental truck for injuries and property 
damage to the public: As long as you have personal auto insurance, no 
additional coverage is necessary. Personal auto insurance fully covers 
this risk up to your policy limit. (It may be a good time, though, to 
reevaluate your auto liability limits. Should they be increased? Or is it 
time to buy a personal umbrella policy?) If you don’t have personal auto 
insurance, you can usually get the liability insurance from the rental 
agency where you’ll also have to get your collision damage coverage.
 
Whenever you’re between homes and having to make temporary living and 
storage arrangements, you need personal property and liability coverage at 
multiple locations. Do not cancel the homeowner’s or renter’s policy on the 
property you’re moving from until coverage at the new, permanent location 
begins. That way, the contents and liability coverage from the homeowner’s or 
renter’s policy will continue to cover your needs while you’re in transition.
A fairly common twist to the previous moving example occurs when, instead 
of doing all the moving yourself, you hire a moving and storage company to 
move your stuff to their warehouse, store it for you, and then move it again 
to the new home. Aren’t the movers liable for anything that happens, includ-
ing breakage, damage, and even water damage in storage?
It depends. If you don’t make special arrangements, the fine print in your 
moving contract limits the moving company’s liability for damage to your 
stuff to a fraction of its value, typically 50¢ per pound! (For your $2,000 big-
screen TV that weighs 80 pounds, they would owe you only 80 × 0.5 = $40.) 
The contract usually also exempts the movers from damage they didn’t 
cause, such as flood damage to the property in storage.

232
Part IV: Singin’ in the Rain: Umbrella Policies and More 
 
Beware of moving contracts. They are usually very anti-consumer. Read them 
carefully, or have your insurance agent read them, so that you know what 
you’re responsible for before a claim happens. The moving company may 
insure the full value of your property if you pay them a little extra, but still not 
for every kind of loss — many still exclude acts of God or groundwater, and 
they usually won’t cover breakage unless you pay them to do the packing.
 
Before buying the optional insurance from the moving company, fax a copy of 
the coverage to your agent or attorney to make sure that there aren’t any 
nasty surprises. I still prefer adding the special perils contents endorsement 
to your homeowner’s or renter’s policy, if you don’t already have it. It’s less 
expensive than the moving company’s optional insurance and usually is far 
better coverage, except for the fact that it excludes breakage of dishes, china, 
and the like. If you want these items covered, get the mover’s insurance.
Emptying Your Nest: Sending 
a Child to College
When you’re getting ready to send your kid to college, your insurance needs 
may change. Here’s a quick list of the types of insurance you’ll want to look 
at and potentially alter:
 
✓ Health insurance: Most colleges offer optional student health coverage — 
buy it if it’s inexpensive. This coverage enables your college student to 
access convenient care at the student health center. (Let’s face it: The 
more convenient the care is, the more likely he’ll be to get the care he 
needs right away.)
 
 Don’t rely on student health insurance exclusively, though — it’s usually 
not that strong. Continue major medical coverage on your child as well, 
for the big stuff.
 
✓ Car insurance: Most insurance companies give a 10 percent to 25 per-
cent discount for a B average or better, and another 30 percent to 40 
percent (or more) discount if the student is attending college over 100 
miles from home and has no car at school. Ask for the good student and 
distant student discounts.
 
 You can eliminate all charges for your student while she’s at school if 
she surrenders her driver’s license. Just get a receipt and send it to your 
agent. This idea is especially good if your child has recent tickets or 
accidents that are driving your insurance rates sky high. If she comes 
home for the summer, she can then reactivate her license for three 
months. You’ll have saved a bundle on insurance costs in the interim.

233
 Chapter 17: Changing Your Insurance When Your Life Changes
 
✓ Personal property: Most homeowner’s policies extend your hom-
eowner’s contents coverage to your child’s belongings at school. Most 
policies stop coverage after 45 days without occupancy (meaning, your 
kid can’t leave the stuff unattended for the summer and still have it cov-
ered by insurance, but he can leave it over Christmas break). If he isn’t 
spending the summer at school, bring the stuff home or store it.
 
 If your kid has expensive valuables or an expensive laptop computer, 
those items can be scheduled on your homeowner’s policy for the best 
possible insurance — covering everything from breakage to soda spilled 
on the keyboard.
 
✓ Your liability for your kid’s apartment: Many college students, espe-
cially after a year or two, opt for an apartment off-campus rather than 
a dorm.
 
 Do not cosign a lease to help your kid qualify for the apartment. Sign a 
rent guarantee instead, which guarantees that you’ll make the rent pay-
ment if your student doesn’t. Being a cosigner makes you potentially 
suable for everything that goes on in that apartment (like serious inju-
ries at college parties).
 
 If you’ve already made the mistake of cosigning the lease for your college 
student’s apartment, buy some liability coverage for yourself. Adding the 
apartment to your homeowner’s and umbrella liability policies should 
only cost about $20 a year.
It’s Not Me, It’s You: Divorcing
Ending a marriage is tough enough without the additional stress of insurance 
disputes. Here’s my advice to help you minimize problems.
Before the divorce
Because the divorce process takes a long time (sometimes a very long time), 
spouses often live separately while still being legally married. Before your 
divorce is finalized, you need to address a couple insurance issues:
 
✓ As soon as you both agree to start divorce proceedings, separate your 
cars onto separate policies. Still list both names, if the vehicle titles are 
in both names, but your name should be first on your own policy; use 
your address on your own policy, too, so that the bills are mailed to you. 
This strategy gives you the best possible coverage and it keeps you from 
being victimized if your soon-to-be ex (intentionally or unintentionally) 
fails to pay the premium.

234
Part IV: Singin’ in the Rain: Umbrella Policies and More 
 
✓ Cover yourself and your property if you move out of the house. If you 
rented a new place, the primary homeowner’s policy on the house you 
shared with your soon-to-be-ex provides no theft coverage and no liabil-
ity coverage at your new apartment.
 
 At the very least, get liability coverage for injuries and property damage 
at the apartment. The least expensive way to do that is through a policy 
endorsement added to the primary homeowner’s policy (and umbrella 
policy if you have one), at a cost of about $20 a year.
 
 If theft is a concern, buy a renter’s policy covering the apartment — in 
both your name and your spouse’s name until the divorce is final. Costs 
for these policies start at $150 a year and up.
 
 In a separation and pending the divorce, don’t remove the person who 
moved out of the house from the homeowner’s insurance, even if the 
insurance company requests it. Both parties must remain as co-named 
insureds on the face sheet of the policy. Why? Because until the 
divorce is final, both parties still equally own the home, both have an 
interest in the house if it is damaged or destroyed, and both need 
worldwide personal liability coverage.
After the divorce
If you haven’t already split up the car insurance, do so now. Do not remove 
either spouse from the homeowner’s policy until the deed has been changed.
 
Be careful: Many times, following a divorce, the home is put up for sale and 
both parties continue to own it until it’s sold. If that’s the case, don’t remove 
either party’s name from the policy until the sale is finalized.
If either spouse has been covered under the other’s group health insurance 
policy, that spouse will lose health insurance coverage when the divorce is 
final. If you’re the one losing coverage, here are my suggestions:
 
✓ If you have group coverage available on your job, request coverage 
from your employer right away, to start the date your coverage ends 
under your ex’s policy. If you do so within 30 days of the divorce, 
you’re usually guaranteed coverage without having to qualify medically.
 
✓ If you don’t have coverage available through your job, exercise your 
COBRA right to continue coverage under your ex’s group policy (if 
you’re eligible) while applying for your own individual health policy. 
(See Chapter 19 for more information on COBRA and HIPAA rights. See 
Chapter 18 for tips on buying individual health insurance.)

235
 Chapter 17: Changing Your Insurance When Your Life Changes
 
Make sure that you’re the owner of your life insurance policy. Have the billing 
address changed to your address. And change the beneficiaries from your ex 
to your children or another person. Reevaluate your life insurance needs. You 
may need less or, if you’re a single parent, you may need substantially more. 
(See Chapter 23 for tips on estimating your life insurance needs.)
 
If you declined disability insurance coverage in the past because your 
spouse’s income more than covered the bills, buy it now. If your paycheck 
stops because of a disability, you’ll be hurting if you don’t have this vital cov-
erage. (See Chapter 22 for tips on buying long-term-disability insurance.)
Hand Me My Gold Watch: Retiring
When you’re retiring, you need to address some specific and unique insur-
ance issues. To start, change the use of your car to pleasure use — you’ll 
save about 15 percent to 20 percent on your car insurance. Also, make sure 
you’re getting any senior discounts the insurance company offers.
 
Take the approved defensive driver course if your insurance company gives 
you enough credit off your premium. In Minnesota for example, seniors get a 
10 percent credit off their rates for three years. Every state is different, so 
check with your agent.
Rear-ended and blindsided
Cassandra called me one day to report that she 
was in a serious car accident. She was rear-
ended. Her medical bills totaled over $40,000, 
and she ended up being away from work for 
about a year. She had, much to her surprise 
and anger, no car insurance to cover the acci-
dent. Why? About a year earlier, she and her 
husband separated and filed for a divorce. Her 
husband insured only his car and never told her 
that she wasn’t covered, even though he had 
verbally agreed to continue insuring both cars.
Cassandra was unnecessarily victimized. Had 
she followed the advice here and split up the 
insurance as soon as they separated, her own 
personal auto policy would have covered her 
injuries and lost wages. Luckily, her health 
insurance covered her medical bills. But the 
rest of her loss she had to pay for out of her 
own pocket.

236
Part IV: Singin’ in the Rain: Umbrella Policies and More 
What to do about your health insurance depends on your age and whether 
you qualify under the federal COBRA law (turn to Chapter 19 for more on 
COBRA continuation rights):
 
✓ If you (or your spouse) are less than 62 years old or if you’re not eligi-
ble for COBRA, apply for guaranteed individual coverage under federal 
HIPAA laws for you and/or your spouse, and keep it until you’re both 65 
years old and qualify for Medicare. If you’re healthy enough to qualify 
for an individual plan in the open market, and if the rates and/or cover-
age are better than your HIPAA plan, go that route instead.
 
✓ If you’re between 62 and 65 years old and you do qualify for COBRA, 
exercise your right to continue your health insurance through your pre-
vious employer for up to 36 months, or until you qualify for Medicare. 
However, if you’re healthy enough to qualify for an individual plan that 
is less expensive or offers better coverage than your COBRA plan, apply 
for that plan and, if approved, keep the individual plan to age 65 and 
drop the COBRA coverage.
 
✓ If you’re 65 or older, apply for both Part A and Part B of Medicare 
directly from Medicare. Once approved, apply for a good Medicare 
supplement policy to plug the many shortcomings of Medicare. At that 
time, also apply for Medicare Part D (prescription drug coverage). I rec-
ommend that you buy both the supplement and Part D coverage from a 
knowledgeable agent because of their complexity.
 
 If you apply for a Medicare supplement policy and Part D within six 
months of turning 65 or losing your group coverage, whichever is later, 
there are no health questions — coverage is guaranteed. (See Chapter 
20 for my tips on buying a good Medicare supplement and Part D. See 
Chapter 19 for more on your COBRA and HIPAA rights.)
Also, reassess your needs relative to life insurance. With less income, you 
may need less life insurance. If you still need life insurance and your health is 
poor, consider converting the group life insurance you had at work to a per-
manent, personally owned policy. Most group life insurance policies give you 
that option if you apply within 30 days of retirement.
Trust Me: Transferring Property to Trusts
Attorneys are increasingly recommending to their older clients that they 
transfer ownership of their home (and sometimes their personal property 
such as cars and boats) to a trust or to their adult children — usually for tax 
reasons. Although these transfers may save on taxes, they result in some 
serious insurance gaps if changes aren’t made to the insurance program of 
the old and the new owner to cover the ownership change.

237
 Chapter 17: Changing Your Insurance When Your Life Changes
For example, Betty, age 68, follows her attorney’s advice and transfers owner-
ship of her $400,000 home and all its contents to a trust, with a provision that 
gives Betty the right to continue to live in the house for as long as she wants. 
If Betty has a $400,000 homeowner’s policy on the house and a tornado 
destroys it, how much will the policy pay Betty? Not much. She’s no longer 
the owner. And the trust has lost a $400,000 asset because the trust had no 
insurance on the home. Betty’s policy wouldn’t pay the trust because the 
trust isn’t named on the policy.
 
If you transfer ownership of your home to anyone else — to a trust or to one 
or more of your adult children — you no longer can collect under your policy 
as the owner. And the new owners cannot collect under your policy either. 
You must make some changes to your homeowner’s insurance at the moment 
ownership is transferred, covering the new owner’s ownership interest.
 
The former owner of the property should co-name the new owner — the trust 
or the adult children — as co-named insureds on the declarations page (the 
coverage summary page) of the policy. This way, the old and new owners are 
equally protected against damage if they’re both named and, as a bonus, the 
old and new owners are also equally protected for lawsuits. List any trust as a 
co-named insured on the umbrella liability policy as well.
If adult children, rather than a trust, receive the property, I recommend, in 
addition to being a co-named insured on the parent’s policy, that the adult 
children extend their home and umbrella liability policies to the new loca-
tion. This extension should cost about $20 a year.
Coping with the Death of a Loved One, 
and Caring for Your Loved Ones 
after You’re Gone
One of the greatest acts of love is buying more life insurance than your sur-
vivors will need. And make sure they know about it, as well as where you 
keep the policies. One of the saddest things I see survivors go through after 
a loved one dies is the hunt for the life insurance policies. If they can’t be 
found, they’ll never be collected on. Even if they eventually are found, search-
ing for them is an unnecessary and traumatic experience for the survivors.
 
Make a list of every life insurance policy you have, make several copies of 
the list, and give the copies to two or more people. Include on the list the 
following:

238
Part IV: Singin’ in the Rain: Umbrella Policies and More 
 
✓ The insurance company name and address
 
✓ The policy number
 
✓ The effective date
 
✓ The death benefit amount
 
✓ The beneficiary
 
✓ The agent’s name and phone number
 
✓ The location of the original policies
 
Here’s a checklist for the survivors:
 
✓ Gather the original life policies (or the inventory form, if you have one). 
Ask the insurance companies to fax or mail you their claim forms. Have 
certified copies of the death certificate and copies of the newspaper 
obituary to file with each claim form.
 
✓ Don’t take the deceased off any insurance policy, including the per-
sonal umbrella policy, until the deceased’s ownership interests have 
been properly transferred. Otherwise, the estate is exposed, with no 
insurance.
 
✓ If a vehicle is involved, notify the auto insurance company of any new 
drivers.
 
 
 If the deceased is not married, add the executor as a co-named insured 
onto the deceased’s auto policy until the estate is settled. Otherwise, 
the car (for most uses) will be uninsured.
 
✓ If you’ve been covered as a family member under the deceased’s group 
health insurance policy, you may have the right to continue coverage for 
up to 36 months under COBRA. You’re also guaranteed the right, under 
federal HIPAA law, to apply for and receive an individual policy. If you’re 
in good health, apply for an individual health policy.
 
✓ If the deceased had disability insurance, cancel it. There may be a 
refund due you on prepaid premiums.

In this part . . .
S
ometimes it seems as if there could be nothing more 
catastrophic than losing a home or a family heirloom, 
but there is. Keeping yourself and your loved ones safe 
and healthy is the most important thing in the world. Yet 
serious illnesses, injuries, and even death occur to every-
one at some point. The only thing worse than having a 
serious health problem is having it without the proper 
insurance coverage in place. If you suffer an injury and 
you aren’t prepared, your financial health can be 
destroyed in an instant.
In this part, I show you how to avoid suffering such cata-
strophic financial losses. I tell what you need to know to 
make good choices about individual and group health 
insurance. I also fill you in on long-term-disability and 
long-term-care insurance. I tell you about Medicare, 
including prescription drug coverage. Finally, I cover life 
insurance, so that you can still look after your loved ones, 
even when you’re no longer around.

Health Insurance
In This Chapter
▶ Understanding what makes a great insurance plan
▶ Saving money with health savings accounts
▶ Discovering strategies to lower your individual health insurance costs
▶ Getting insurance when you’re uninsurable
M
ost people are able to get the health insurance they need through 
their jobs. Lucky for them! But many people have to buy their own 
health insurance, for a variety of reasons (for example, they’re self-employed, 
they work for a small company that doesn’t provide health insurance, they 
retired before the age of 65, and so on). If you’re in the market for individual 
health insurance, this chapter shows you what you need to know and what 
you need to do.
Chapter 19, on group coverage, contains lots of great information. Even if 
you’re shopping for individual coverage, you may want to take a quick glance 
through it.
Discovering What Makes a Great 
Health Insurance Plan
Facing serious, life-threatening illness is traumatic. I know, I’ve been there. 
Everything else you’re worrying about in life suddenly becomes unimport-
ant. The only thing that could make it worse is fear. Fear about your health 
insurance coverage. Fear that the escalating bills will exhaust your coverage 
limit. Fear that the specialist you want to see for your illness isn’t approved 
by your insurance company. Fear that holes in the coverage will leave you 

242
Part V: Managing Life, Health, and Disability Risks 
personally responsible for huge bills that could wipe out all your savings — 
and even put you in serious debt. That’s why a solid health insurance plan is 
so important.
 
An excellent health insurance plan must include five key ingredients:
 
✓ A coverage limit high enough that it won’t likely ever be exhausted, 
even for the most catastrophic medical expenses.
 
✓ An annual dollar limit you can live with on your out-of-pocket maxi-
mum. (The out-of-pocket maximum is an important feature of health 
insurance policies that limits your annual responsibility for your health 
insurance policy copayments and deductibles.)
 
✓ No dollar limits on types of expenses, such as dollar limits on daily 
room charges or dollar limits for types of surgical procedures.
 
✓ Freedom to see specialists without a referral.
 
✓ Worldwide coverage.
Do most plans meet all five criteria? Nope. I estimate that less than half of the 
individual and group health plans sold in the United States include all five ele-
ments that make a great health insurance plan.
Why do these five elements matter? Because you want a plan that won’t, 
even in the worst case, cause you major financial hardship — and a plan that 
lets you choose the most skilled care provider, especially in serious or life-
threatening situations, such as treating your 6-year-old’s leukemia, surgically 
removing your spouse’s brain tumor, or performing skin grafting operations 
after you’ve been badly burned.
Setting a high enough coverage maximum
When I started selling insurance in the 1970s, health insurance policy limits 
were just $10,000 per claim. Policies were available that provided up to an 
additional $25,000 in coverage. My clients could sleep well with $35,000 in 
total coverage. Today, that same peace of mind requires at least a $3 million 
in coverage limit.
Policy limits come in two varieties:
 
✓ A dollar maximum per claim: The per-claim maximum is the most the 
insurance company will spend for any single illness or injury. If your 
limit is $1 million, for example, your policy will pay up to $1 million 
for your injuries in a recent car accident, and then up to another mil-
lion for next year’s cancer, and another million for the following year’s 
Parkinson’s disease.

243
 Chapter 18: Buying Individual Health Insurance 
 
✓ A dollar maximum per lifetime: Lifetime limits, where every dollar 
spent this year reduces the limit available for future years, are more 
common. If your lifetime limit is $1 million, your $225,000 car accident 
bill reduces your lifetime limit to $775,000. Then your $150,000 cancer 
bill reduces the $775,000 lifetime limit to $625,000, and so on.
 
When buying health insurance, I strongly recommend a maximum policy limit 
of at least $1 million per claim or $3 million per lifetime (or a policy with no 
limits at all, if you can find one).
Capping your out-of-pocket costs
Most health insurance plans require some kind of copayment on your part. 
(A copayment is the dollar amount your policy requires you to pay toward 
your bills.) You may have a copay per visit (such as $25 for each office visit 
or $75 if you go to the emergency room). Perhaps you have a deductible of 
$500 a year before your coverage kicks in (meaning that you pay the first 
$500 of your medical expenses each year). Or maybe your policy pays 80 
percent of all covered medical bills, with you responsible for the other 20 
percent.
Paying the per-visit copays or the deductible usually isn’t a hardship. But 
paying 20 percent of all your major medical bills in one year, without any 
limit on the possible amount of your contribution, can be. If you have a baby 
who’s born three months premature and who needs pediatric intensive care 
for a long time, your bill could run $400,000 — and your 20 percent copay 
would be $80,000! If your baby needs surgeries, your bill could jump to 
$750,000, and your 20 percent copay would be $150,000! That’s too big a risk 
for almost anyone to assume.
Avoiding internal policy limits
A good health insurance policy has only one policy limit — either a limit per 
claim or a limit per lifetime. It contains no other dollar limitations. Many medi-
ocre policies contain internal limits such as $200 a day for room and board, 
$400 a day for intensive care, or dollar limits on specific surgeries ($4,000 for 
an appendectomy, $35,000 for quadruple bypass surgery, and so on).
Even if the limits are adequate today (and most aren’t), in four to five years, 
given the rapid pace of medical cost inflation, you may end up getting only 
half your bill paid.
 
Avoid like the plague any health insurance policy that contains internal policy 
limits on room and board, surgeries, or anything else.

244
Part V: Managing Life, Health, and Disability Risks 
 
If you have a group plan with internal limits from your employer, buy an 
excess major medical policy with a large deductible that has no internal limits, 
to pick up most of the shortcomings of the group plan.
Making sure you don’t have 
to beg to see specialists
Many healthcare plans (such as many HMOs or PPOs) offer lower costs but 
take away your right to decide what kind of treatment you can get and whom 
you can get it from:
 
✓ Usually, you agree to get all your primary care from a small list of 
approved clinics where costs can be controlled more easily.
 
✓ You agree to seeing a specialist only if your primary physician will refer 
you out (which means “referral begging” to you).
 
✓ You agree to give the insurance company the final say on what type of 
procedure or treatment you can have.
That’s a lot to give up for a savings of about 15 percent on your premiums.
 
If your employer-provided group plan doesn’t offer choice, you can buy an 
individual major medical policy with a moderately high deductible. If you 
don’t like your choices under managed care, you go see whomever you want 
and pay just your deductible.
Managed care worth considering
In recent years, a managed care hybrid plan 
has emerged. It’s a two-tiered system. The 
first tier is managed care. When you go to your 
chosen primary doctor, you get almost 100 per-
cent coverage — even if you see a specialist, 
if it’s a referral from your primary doctor. The 
second tier is freedom of choice: You can go to 
almost anyone — any specialist — no referrals 
needed. You just have to chip in on the extra 
cost (for example, a $300 deductible, plus 20 
percent of the bill). When something serious is 
going on, the extra out-of-pocket expenses for 
the freedom of choice are worth every penny.

245
 Chapter 18: Buying Individual Health Insurance 
Ensuring that you’re covered 
away from home
Many managed care plans don’t cover you outside your home territory, 
except for emergencies. Here are two stories from my own client files:
 
✓ Lee just bought a winter vacation condo in Arizona. (Why anyone would 
want to flee Minnesota’s winter wonderland of ice, snow, and subzero 
temperatures is beyond me.) Checking the Medicare supplement policy 
he owned from a local HMO, he discovered that there was no coverage 
for anything but emergency care outside Minnesota — a real problem 
for someone living five months of each year outside the state. Luckily, 
we moved his coverage to another Medicare supplement policy that 
gave him greater freedom of choice before anything serious happened.
 
✓ Jim and Jane’s daughter, Angela, was attending college out east. She 
fell and injured a knee. The emergency care was covered by their HMO 
policy, but follow-up care with physical therapists was not covered at 
all. It turns out that their otherwise excellent insurance has one major 
flaw: For anyone residing out-of-state part of the year, nonemergency 
care isn’t covered!
Should you buy travel medical insurance? 
No way, no how
Travel medical insurance pays medical bills 
you incur through travel, within a certain date 
range and up to a dollar limit (such as $5,000). It’s 
Las Vegas insurance, plain and simple. You’re 
gambling that you’ll get sick while you travel. 
Not a smart gamble — it violates almost all the 
rules for buying insurance that I introduce in 
Chapter 2. Plus, it often duplicates, unnecessar-
ily, your existing health insurance. The only time 
that travel medical insurance may be of value is 
if you have a very large deductible on your health 
plan and you’re buying travel medical insurance 
to cover the deductible while traveling.
If you’re traveling abroad, call your health insur-
ance company before you leave to find out its 
preferred method of handling claims incurred 
abroad. Is there a 24-hour toll-free phone 
number you can call? Are there any coverage 
restrictions abroad?
Warning: Be very careful if you do buy travel 
medical insurance. Read the policy carefully. 
Many are very restricted, so you may as well 
throw money down a rat hole.

246
Part V: Managing Life, Health, and Disability Risks 
 
Make sure that your policy covers you worldwide for nonemergency care. If it 
doesn’t, either replace it or buy a supplemental policy that provides the cov-
erage. Higher copayments for care given out of state are fine, as long as you 
have coverage.
Medical evacuation insurance: 
A potentially good idea
If you travel much, especially if you travel 
abroad, and you get seriously ill, the hospital 
or treatment facility you end up in may not be 
state-of-the-art in terms of doctors, equipment, 
or both. Medical evacuation insurance covers 
the costs of airlifting you from a remote area, in 
a medically equipped and staffed aircraft, to a 
top hospital.
Medical evacuation insurance does not dupli-
cate any other insurance you have. A good 
policy covers the cost (about $35,000 to $75,000) 
of bringing an intensive-care jet, fully staffed 
and medically equipped, to wherever you are 
in the world and flying you to a preferred treat-
ment facility. Coverage is available from travel 
agents, tours, and credit card companies on a 
per-trip basis, and from travel assistance com-
panies who sell the coverage on an annual 
basis for people who travel frequently.
If the coverage and the company are good, 
medical evacuation insurance is a good idea, 
especially if you travel a lot or have a health 
condition (like a heart problem) that places you 
at greater risk for being in a medical emergency 
abroad.
If you buy medical evacuation insurance, try to 
find a policy that:
 ✓ Pays for you to be transported to your home 
hospital or another hospital of your choice — 
not their choice.
 ✓ Lets you (not a doctor, not a plan represen-
tative) make the call to evacuate or not — a 
huge advantage!
 ✓ Has no dollar limits on costs. (The cost 
to evacuate you from China may be 
$100,000!)
 ✓ Covers preexisting conditions. (This is very 
important — many plans do not.)
 ✓ Transports you at your option, regardless of 
medical necessity.
 ✓ Covers you while traveling within your home 
country — not just abroad.
 ✓ Provides a full medical staff.
The best company I’ve encountered is Med 
Jet Assist (phone: 800-963-3538; Web: www.
medjetassist.com). It meets all the crite-
ria I just listed. Plus, the policy is underwritten 
by the highly trusted Lloyds of London, and it’s 
reasonably priced — $225 a year for individu-
als and $350 for families — no matter how often 
you travel.

247
 Chapter 18: Buying Individual Health Insurance 
Saving Money on Individual Coverage
You can cut costs on individual plans in three ways:
 
✓ You can reduce your coverage and the insurance company will give you 
a direct premium credit.
 
✓ You can put money into a health savings account (HSA) combined with 
an approved high-deductible health plan (HDHP). A HDHP is a high-
deductible major medical policy that meets the requirements of the IRS 
for use in conjunction with an HSA. (See “Saving with health savings 
accounts,” later in this chapter, for more information).
 
✓ You can opt for a higher deductible when your health and self-care are 
exceptional but when the insurance company has no way of lowering 
your premiums.
Changing your coverage
You can save money on your insurance by cutting out unneeded coverage. 
For example, if your individual policy currently includes coverage for mater-
nity, and you know you’re not going to need it, you can drop that coverage 
and save money on your insurance premium.
You can also cut back on doctor choice — by switching to an HMO from a 
PPO, for example.
Socking away money in a 
health savings account
An HSA operates like an individual retirement account (IRA) coordinated 
with an IRS-approved high-deductible major medical health insurance plan 
(HDHP). The big advantage of an HSA is that it allows you to pay for your 
major medical deductible as well as elective medical and dental expenses 
with pretax dollars. For most people, that’s equal to a 25 percent to 30 per-
cent savings on their medical and dental bills!

248
Part V: Managing Life, Health, and Disability Risks 
Here’s how an HSA works:
 
✓ As with an IRA, contributions are income tax deductible.
 
✓ Earnings on the account are tax sheltered.
 
✓ The maximum contribution per year is set annually by the govern-
ment. For each person age 55 and older, an additional “catch-up” con-
tribution is allowed. To find out what the current allowable amounts 
are, as well as anything else you want to know about health savings 
accounts, go to www.ustreas.gov and click on the Health Savings 
Account link.
 
✓ In order for the HSA contributions to be tax-deductible, you must also 
have an IRS-approved high-deductible health plan (HDHP). The HDHP 
must include options for a minimum deductible and a maximum deduct-
ible set by the government each year. There usually is a cumulative family 
deductible amount for policies insuring two or more people in the family. 
There is no coverage under the policy until the entire family reaches the 
family deductible in a calendar year. (Be careful when choosing your 
family deductible!) There generally is an option for 80 percent coverage 
as well as 100 percent coverage after the deductible is satisfied.
 
 Choose the 100 percent option. After you’ve satisfied the high deduct-
ible in a calendar year, you’ll have peace of mind knowing that all cov-
ered expenses will be 100 percent paid, for the rest of the year.
 
✓ From the HSA, you can pay your deductibles and most other medical 
and dental expenses that your health plan doesn’t cover (such as laser 
eye surgery, glasses, contact lenses, hearing aids, and dental work). 
Because the HSA money has never been taxed, you’re paying those bills 
with pretax dollars — a huge advantage.
 
✓ If you’ve stayed reasonably healthy, you can leave unused funds on 
deposit and either use them in future years or save them as supple-
mental retirement dollars. If you don’t use them for medical bills, with-
drawals are taxed much like traditional IRAs when you do retire.
You can set up an HSA wherever you can establish an IRA — banks, savings 
and loans, investment houses, insurance companies, and so on. Because 
of the need to write checks to pay doctors and buy prescription drugs, I’ve 
found that banks work best — that way, you can have an account with both 
checks and a debit card.
 
You can make your life a lot easier when using an HSA to pay deductible 
expenses and other expenses by following these simple suggestions:

249
 Chapter 18: Buying Individual Health Insurance 
 
✓ Don’t pay any medical bill or pharmacy charge until your insurance 
company has reduced the cost to its negotiated discount pricing.
 
✓ Fund the account early in the year so you have plenty of cash available if 
medical bills are sizable in the first quarter of the year.
 
✓ Keep all your receipts for all services you’ve paid through your HSA 
(medical bills, pharmaceutical bills, dental bills, and so forth) in a medi-
cal folder in case you ever get audited. For a complete and current list 
of IRS-approved medical and dental expenses, go to www.irs.gov and 
search for Publication 502, or call 800-829-3676 to have it mailed to you.)
Taking care of yourself and opting 
for higher deductibles
The best way to save money on an individual policy, without cutting back on 
coverage, is to quit smoking. Unlike group policies, almost all individual poli-
cies differentiate smokers from nonsmokers — significantly — because the 
claims costs for smokers are much higher.
Insurance companies don’t offer individual health insurance to people who 
are high-risk medically. So, everyone else — from the super-fit and super-
healthy to the average or below-average health risk — pays the same rate 
and shares the losses.
If you’re healthy and take good care of yourself (through exercise, diet, stress 
management, rest, and personal safety), how can you get credit if insurance 
companies don’t offer any? The answer: Opt for higher deductibles.
The difference in cost between a $300 deductible and a $1,000 deductible 
with some insurers is a whopping 45 percent! As the size of your family or 
age increases, that 45 percent can save you a fortune — especially when you 
consider that you’re assuming only $700 more risk per person each year. 
If you’re paying $4,000 a year for just yourself, 45 percent would save you 
$1,800 in premiums!
 
Pricing for each level of deductible is based on average risk. If you’re much 
fitter and healthier than average, you’re paying more than your share, no 
matter what level of coverage you buy. But the higher your deductibles, the 
more you’ll save. Being above average in terms of health, your chances of 
having to spend that higher deductible are much less.

250
Part V: Managing Life, Health, and Disability Risks 
 
When deciding between two deductibles, choose the lower deductible if 
you’re in doubt. You can raise your deductible later, anytime you want. But to 
lower it, the whole family must qualify medically — not likely if you’ve just 
incurred some big medical bills.
Coping with Health Insurance Problems
Throughout your life, you’ll undoubtedly face tough decisions regarding 
health insurance. You’ll be turned down because of a preexisting condition, 
your kid will go off to college and be offered insurance through school, your 
group coverage will end because you’ve lost your job. . . . These are just a 
few of the challenges I cover in this section.
When you can’t get insurance
If you or a family member for whom you’re responsible has a health condi-
tion for which you can’t get insurance (in other words, you’ve been rejected 
for individual coverage), you need to broaden your way of looking at the 
problem. Very few people can’t get health insurance for a medically uninsur-
able condition if they’re willing to make some life changes.
Over the years, I’ve read numerous horror stories about families who have 
suffered financial ruin because of one family member’s medical expenses. 
I remember one story in particular about a family who lost their insurance 
because of a job change. The new job didn’t offer group insurance, and their 
son was uninsurable. He had an ongoing condition that required years of 
treatment and thousands of dollars of expenses. According to the story, this 
family sat helplessly while their life savings dwindled to nothing. You want 
to know the truly sad part? I believe that their financial ruin could have been 
prevented if they had considered some other choices.
Getting paid to work out
How would you like to get paid cold hard cash 
to work out regularly? It would certainly be a 
little easier to crawl out of the sack at 5:30 a.m. 
on those cold winter mornings, wouldn’t it?
Many health insurance companies are start-
ing to give monthly credits of around $20 per 
month toward your health club membership if 
you can document that you work out at least 12 
times a month. Check with your insurance com-
pany and see if it offers this deal, or just check 
with your club to see if your insurance company 
participates.

251
 Chapter 18: Buying Individual Health Insurance 
 
If you’re willing to take one or more of the following actions, you can prevent a 
financial catastrophe from happening to you because of an uninsured family 
member:
 
✓ If your employer doesn’t offer group coverage, talk to them about 
starting to offer a group plan. Enlist the support of your coworkers. 
The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA) 
requires insurance companies to accept all members of a group, regard-
less of health. If your employer adds group health insurance coverage, 
the worst-case scenario is that the condition won’t be covered for the 
first 12 months. (See Chapter 19 for more information on preexisting 
conditions.)
 
✓ Change employers. Get a job with a company that offers group medical 
coverage to its employees and their families.
 
✓ If you’re in a state that has a major medical insurance plan for unin-
surable people, sign up immediately. Call your state insurance depart-
ment to find out.
 
✓ Move to a state that offers catastrophic individual major medical cov-
erage for uninsurable citizens. Minnesota, where I live, has such a plan, 
and so do many other states.
You may balk at the idea of doing something as seemingly drastic as chang-
ing jobs or moving to a different state in order to get health insurance for 
yourself or a sick family member. But from my perspective, those are far 
better alternatives than complete financial ruin.
Dread disease insurance: Just say no
We all have fears of one kind or another, and 
many of our fears have to do with getting sick 
with an awful disease. Some parts of the insur-
ance industry have responded to those fears 
with policies that cover specific diseases — for 
example, policies that cover only cancer.
If you have a high-limit ($3 million to $5 million), 
high-quality major medical policy that already 
covers cancer, buying another $1 million of cov-
erage just for cancer is throwing money out the 
window. However, if you have a poor medical 
policy (such as one with a $250,000 lifetime 
limit), buying an extra $1 million of coverage is a 
good idea — but not coverage just for cancer.
If you’re considering buying a dread disease 
insurance policy (a policy that covers only spe-
cific illnesses) because your health insurance 
isn’t very good, don’t. Save your money and use 
it instead to get a top health insurance policy 
or an excess major medical supplement to the 
policy you have that covers all illnesses and 
injuries — not just the ones you fear.

If this story happened today instead of a few years ago, the new HIPAA law 
would have guaranteed this family — at the time the group coverage at the 
prior job was ending — the right to an individual policy regardless of health. 
And if certain conditions were met, the insurance would have covered their 
son’s preexisting medical condition immediately. (See Chapter 19 for more on 
qualifying for HIPAA.)
When you’re broke
If you’re in a financial crisis — temporary or permanent — and you just don’t 
have enough money available for health insurance, you can still protect your-
self somewhat by managing your medical risks in advance.
 
If you don’t develop a game plan for handling medical costs before you’re 
faced with them, you may end up being personally responsible for the entire 
cost of any emergency care that you need.
Look into various assistance programs in which medical care is provided 
either at no cost or at a nominal cost. In my community, for example, pro-
grams are available through Lutheran Social Services or Catholic Charities. 
In exchange for a very small amount of money per month, all family members 
receive the medical care they need. Participants are limited to designated 
medical facilities, but they get medical care now, without facing a huge debt 
later. Also check in your area for free clinics.
 
If you or a family member is in economic distress, research what’s available in 
your community now and have an emergency plan so that you know where 
you’re going for care if and when you need it. A medical emergency isn’t the 
time to figure out what your options are.
When your kids outgrow your policy
Depending on your particular insurance policy terms, your children are only 
covered under your family plan to a certain age — usually age 19 or, for full-
time students, until 25. Insurance polices are very inconsistent on this.
 
Whether you have group or individual coverage, before your kid turns 18, 
check with your insurance company or agent and find out what your insur-
ance company’s rules are for maintaining coverage for your child. Find out 
how many credits your kid must carry per school semester to stay eligible. 
Will she be eligible in the summer if she hasn’t registered yet for the fall 
semester? What if she drops out of school for a while? Get clear on all this 
beforehand. Claim time is not the time to find out that your child isn’t insured.

253
 Chapter 18: Buying Individual Health Insurance 
When you have a kid in college
Should you buy the optional student health insurance available from your 
kid’s college? If the insurance is provided automatically as part of tuition 
costs, should you drop your kid from your family health policy and rely 
exclusively on the school coverage?
When my clients come to me with these questions, I always ask them to send 
me a full copy of the college’s student insurance policy. What I discover, in 
almost every case, is that the policy has
 
✓ Excellent preventive care — coverage for physicals, eye exams, and so 
on — at the student health center on campus
 
✓ Excellent coverage for other doctor care, if the care is provided at the 
student health center
 
✓ Hospitalization coverage at the university’s hospital, but usually only for 
a limited time (such as 30 days)
 
✓ Poor medical coverage away from school — both hospital and doctor
 
✓ Poor coverage for substantial medical bills
 
✓ Often, no coverage during the summers
 
My advice: Keep your student insured on the family health plan and buy the 
student health coverage, too. The school’s coverage is usually pretty inex-
pensive. Plus, many family heath plans don’t cover expenses incurred at your 
student’s college health center anyway, and the student health insurance 
plans available from colleges always cover these expenses. If your kid can 
just drop by the campus health center, she’s a lot more likely to get the care 
she needs than if she has to trek to the nearest hospital or doctor whom your 
plan covers. So buying the student health plan can help keep your student 
healthier.
School accident insurance: To buy or not to buy?
Most elementary and secondary schools send 
information home with students about insur-
ance for injuries that occur on school grounds 
or at school events. It’s most commonly offered 
to student-athletes.
Here’s what I recommend you do:
 ✓ Assuming there aren’t any exclusions to 
worry about and that it’s reasonably priced, 
buy it if you have a high deductible on your 
health insurance plan.
 ✓ If you have minimal deductibles or copay-
ments, don’t buy it. It just duplicates cover-
age you already have.

254
Part V: Managing Life, Health, and Disability Risks 
 
Never drop your college student from your family health insurance plan, even 
if you buy the student health insurance offered by the college. You’ll need 
your family plan for any serious claims.
When you need temporary 
health insurance
Many states allow health insurance companies to offer the public tempo-
rary health coverage to meet short-term needs (such as covering a person 
who’s between jobs or a college student who isn’t covered by student 
health insurance during the summer). Coverage is usually available in 
increments of 30, 60, 90, 120, and sometimes 180 days, and it’s usually quite 
good — typically, temporary policies have a coverage limit of $1 million or 
more, and they usually include freedom of choice and a maximum amount 
on out-of-pocket expenses.
The revolving-door college student
If you have a kid who can’t seem to make up 
his mind about going to college (he’s in for a 
semester, out for a semester, back in for a 
semester, and so on), and you’re covered by a 
group policy that is eligible for COBRA continu-
ation rights (see Chapter 19 more on COBRA), 
here are my recommendations:
 1. When he drops out, notify your employer 
to exercise the 36-month COBRA continua-
tion option.
 
 This way, your kid stays insured under your 
group insurance. The only difference is that 
you’ll foot 100 percent of his premium costs 
(if you weren’t already) while he’s out of 
school.
 2. When he returns to school (and is taking 
the required number of credits), cancel 
COBRA and add him back onto your cover-
age as a dependent.
 
 Each time he drops out and then returns, 
follow these same steps, until he reaches 
the maximum age for students to be cov-
ered under your policy — usually age 25. 
If he’s still in school when he reaches the 
maximum age for students to be insured on 
your policy, or if he’s without insurance for 
any other reason, exercise his 36- month 
COBRA option until he can arrange cover-
age on his own individual health policy.
If he’s not eligible for COBRA (in other words, if 
you have an individual policy or your employer 
has too few employees to qualify for COBRA), 
set him up with his own individual policy the 
first time he drops out of school. Then just 
keep his individual policy in force during the 
revolving-door period.
Remember: If he were turned down for health 
insurance because of health history issues, 
he would have the guaranteed right to an indi-
vidual policy under HIPAA. (See Chapter 19 for 
more on HIPAA.)

255
 Chapter 18: Buying Individual Health Insurance 
The biggest advantage to a temporary policy is that you can qualify with 
almost no medical questions asked. Coverage can be immediate, if needed.
 
But temporary coverage has several disadvantages:
 
✓ Preexisting conditions aren’t covered. If you’ve ever been treated for 
a condition in the past, you won’t be covered if the condition flares up 
again.
 
✓ The insurance is usually not renewable.
 
✓ When the coverage period you’ve chosen ends, so does the coverage — 
often, even if you’re lying seriously ill in the hospital.
 
✓ Claim payments are often delayed.
 
✓ Coverage outside the country is often excluded.
Because of these major limitations, you generally want to avoid buying tem-
porary insurance unless you have no other option. If you’re between jobs, 
continue your group coverage from your prior employer under COBRA if you 
can. And for summer coverage for college students, keep them continuously 
insured all year round under your family plan.
 
In one situation, temporary coverage makes sense — when you’re applying for 
individual coverage and you currently have no insurance. You complete an 
application and pay a premium to apply for individual coverage. If the insur-
ance company approves you, it’ll generally issue your policy retroactively, if 
you desire, effective on the date you applied. If, while your application was 
pending, you were hospitalized or incurred other medical bills, those bills 
would be covered. But what if the company declines your application? You 
would be uninsured for any bills that you’d accumulated since you applied, 
even if the medical conditions were new.
 
Even after you apply for individual coverage and pay the initial premium, 
you’re not necessarily covered. Only if the company later approves you — a 
process that normally takes 30 to 60 days — will you have been covered since 
the date of your application. That’s a long time to risk being uninsured.
 
Here’s how you can use short-term coverage to protect yourself when you 
have no insurance and while your application for long-term coverage is being 
considered:
 
1. Buy a 60-day short-term policy to be assured of insurance coverage for 
any new medical condition or injury that occurs while your long-term 
application is being considered.
 
2. Apply simultaneously for long-term coverage, requesting an effective 
date, if approved, for 60 days from now to coincide perfectly with the 
expiration of your short-term policy.

256
Part V: Managing Life, Health, and Disability Risks 
 
 Then, if your long-term policy application is rejected, you at least had 
coverage for new conditions while your application was being reviewed. 
Without the short-term coverage, the new medical problems would have 
been totally uninsured.
When you’re getting a divorce
Because about 50 percent of the marriages in the United States end in divorce, 
the problem of continuing health insurance after a divorce is significant. Your 
options depend on which spouse has insurance and through whom:
 
✓ If both spouses are employed full-time and have their own group 
health insurance coverages, health insurance isn’t a problem.
 
✓ If both spouses have group coverage available through their employ-
ers, but one spouse has declined employer-based coverage and opted 
to be covered under the other spouse’s policy, all he needs to do is 
apply for coverage at his own place of work within 30 days of being 
dropped from his ex’s policy, to avoid having to qualify medically.
 
✓ If only one spouse has group coverage available through his employer 
and the other spouse doesn’t have group coverage available at work, 
the one being dropped from the group coverage should obtain an indi-
vidual policy through an agent. Coverage may be guaranteed under fed-
eral HIPAA laws (see Chapter 19 for more on HIPAA rights).
If you have kids, things can get more complicated. When both parents are 
employed and each has coverage at work, the best thing to do is normally to 
continue the children’s coverage through the parent whose coverage is best 
for the children.
But what if one parent is required in the divorce decree to pay for the chil-
dren’s coverage and the children are currently not on that parent’s policy? 
Here’s an example: Sue and Tom divorce. The court orders Tom to pay the 
children’s health insurance costs to age 19. But Sue has them insured under 
her plan. Their options are as follows:
 
✓ Sue can continue having them on her plan with Tom reimbursing her — 
but getting that reimbursement sometimes can be a source of conflict.
 
✓ Tom can move them to his plan, usually without the children having to 
qualify medically if the move is done within 30 days of the divorce. But 
transferring coverage is a problem if Sue doesn’t like Tom’s policy or his 
plan won’t cover the children’s doctors.

257
 Chapter 18: Buying Individual Health Insurance 
 
✓ Sue can set up an individual policy covering just the children, with the 
bills sent to Tom (assuming that the children can qualify medically).
 
I like the option of setting up an individual policy, especially if Tom has the 
premiums paid electronically from his checking account and Sue’s mailing 
address is on the policy. This way, the premiums are always paid on time, so 
the chances of a cancelled policy and a resulting uninsured claim are reduced. 
By having Sue’s mailing address listed on the policy, Sue gets copies of the 
policies and changes, as well as any late premium notices if the electronic pay-
ment isn’t made for whatever reason.
An individual plan also gives the parents more flexibility to determine the 
coverage they want for their children. And the coverage won’t end if Tom or 
Sue’s job ends, which is safer for the children’s welfare and much less stress-
ful for their parents. (See Chapter 19 for information on how the children’s 
application for individual coverage may be guaranteed, regardless of any pre-
existing health problems.)
When you become self-employed
 
If you’re leaving your job to become self-employed, don’t continue your 
COBRA option for the entire 18 months before applying for individual cover-
age. The problem with continuing COBRA this long is that it risks future 
insurability — during those 18 months, your health may go bad, and when 
the 18 months are over, you’ll be stuck with less-than-desirable choices.
 
Here’s a three-point plan I recommend that reduces the risks of coming up 
short on COBRA:
 
1. When you leave your job, continue your group coverage under 
COBRA, if you’re eligible, so that you’ll have uninterrupted health 
insurance coverage.
 
2. Stay with COBRA while you test the self-employment waters.
 
 If you don’t like self-employment, just continue COBRA until you’re back 
working for another company and are covered by its group plan.
 
3. The moment you decide to stay self-employed, apply for a good indi-
vidual health plan, keeping COBRA while your application is being 
evaluated.
 
 If you’re approved, drop COBRA. If you’re declined, keep COBRA until 
you’ve located replacement insurance (see “When you can’t get insur-
ance,” earlier in this chapter).

Chapter 19
Making the Best Group Health 
Insurance Decisions
In This Chapter
▶ Choosing among group health insurance options
▶ Continuing coverage when you leave your job
T
he good news about group health insurance is that somebody else is 
paying part of the premium. The bad news is that your plan choices are 
somewhat restricted, and the coverage stays with the job when you leave. 
In this chapter, I help you make good choices about group health insurance 
while you’re employed and offer my recommendations about continuing your 
coverage after you leave.
Picking the Best Group Health Insurance
Having to make group health insurance decisions can be difficult. There’s no 
agent in your corner who can coach you. The insurance company or your 
employer can answer questions, but they can’t give advice. Without good 
information, it’s easy to make a serious mistake.
These are just a few of the kinds of questions I get from my clients about 
their group health insurance programs:
 
✓ Should I cover my spouse under my group insurance even though she’s 
covered on her own policy at her job?
 
✓ How can I, as a single parent, avoid paying for a nonexistent spouse 
under the group family rate?

260
Part V: Managing Life, Health, and Disability Risks 
 
✓ Should I insure my college daughter on my group plan if she buys the 
school health insurance coverage?
 
✓ I have three different group plans to choose from at work. Which is best 
for me?
The following sections give you some tips on making good decisions on these 
and other issues.
Choosing between two or more plans
 
I often get calls from clients who want help choosing among group insurance 
options offered to them at work. Having multiple options is especially 
common with large employers or the government. If your employer offers 
more than one group health insurance option, I recommend that you do the 
following:
 
✓ Consider price last. The only exception to this rule is if your finances 
are in poor condition. Otherwise, set aside cost for now.
 
✓ Look at the five ingredients of a good health insurance plan (see 
Chapter 18) and see how the insurance options you have to choose 
from compare. With any luck, at least one of the available plans includes 
all five ingredients. If it does, take that one.
 
 If two or more plans include all five ingredients, choose the one that also 
has paperless claims (meaning the doctors and hospitals file the claims 
directly to the insurance company). If two or more plans also offer 
paperless claims, then, and only then, decide on price.
Suppose your employer offers these three choices for group health plans for 
your family of four:
 
✓ Option A is a true freedom-of-choice plan where you can go anywhere 
you want for care. The only drawback is that you have to file your own 
claims. Your monthly cost is $750.
 
✓ Option B is a limited-choice managed-care plan. It meets only one of the 
five key criteria of a good plan — it has a limit on annual out-of-pocket 
expenses. Its only advantage is low cost — $475 per month.
 
✓ Option C is a hybrid of A and B. You can get care anywhere without a 
referral. Its only drawback is that if you go outside the rather substantial 
primary-care network (86 percent of the doctors in the state), you’ll face 
a $300 deductible and probably will have to file your own claim. Your 
cost is $650 per month.

261
 Chapter 19: Making the Best Group Health Insurance Decisions
If these were your choices, you’d choose Option B only if, due to poor 
finances, price was all-important. It meets only one of the five criteria of a 
good plan.
You’d choose Option A if access to any doctor anywhere was worth the extra 
$1,200 a year and you could stand to file your own claims.
Personally, I would choose Option C. (In fact, these were my choices, and I 
did choose C.) It meets all five criteria of a good plan, and claims are paper-
less. I’m comfortable with the doctors who are available to me, and I can 
actually go to any other doctor if I’m okay with higher copays and filing my 
own claims.
 
To help you make a good decision, if you’re still unclear about what choice to 
make, consider spending $100 to $200 to consult with a good insurance agent 
you know who is an expert on health insurance — maybe the agent who 
helped you with your life insurance. Bring in your group insurance options. 
You shouldn’t need to buy more than one hour of the agent’s time.
Covering your spouse and dependents
The following list includes some of the issues I’m asked about regarding how 
best to cover family members, along with my recommendations:
 
✓ Double-covering a spouse: The question of whether to cover a spouse 
under your plan as well as under your spouse’s plan comes up most 
often when each spouse has coverage paid entirely by the employer 
and one of the two employers also pays all or most of the spouse’s and 
dependents’ coverage.
 
 Don’t double-cover yourself or your spouse. When two companies 
insure the same person, you can’t collect twice, so claims are shared or 
fought over. It becomes a claims nightmare. Instead, choose the plan 
that best meets the five criteria of a good health insurance plan.
 
✓ Covering children when both spouses have a group plan: Where 
should you cover the children — under your plan or your spouse’s? In 
this situation, you weigh out-of-pocket costs in premiums, copayments, 
and deductibles against the coverage of each plan. These out-of-pocket 
costs can be dramatically different. But again, choose the plan that best 
covers the five criteria. Price should be the least important part of the 
decision.
 
 When choosing which plan is best, don’t minimize how important the 
ability to choose top specialists will be if one of your precious ones is 
facing a serious illness or injury.

262
Part V: Managing Life, Health, and Disability Risks 
 
✓ Avoiding the single-parent penalty: The most equitable group plans 
charge a price per head. So if you’re a single parent, you don’t pay for a 
nonexistent spouse. Or if you’re childless, you don’t pay for nonexistent 
children. But it doesn’t always work that way. Sometimes group insur-
ance offers only two choices — individual and family. Family includes 
husband, wife, and all children for one price. But family also includes 
single-parent families and childless families. If your family is small, you 
pay the same amount as a person with a very large family.
 
 Here’s how you can avoid paying for nonexistent family members, 
assuming that your dependents are in good health:
 
• Accept the group coverage on yourself because the employer is 
footing at least part of the cost.
 
• Buy a quality individual policy for your dependents.
 
 If even one of your dependents has a health problem that would 
make him ineligible for individual coverage, bite the bullet and pay 
the family rate at work to get your dependent covered.
Continuing Coverage When 
You Leave Your Job
Since 1985, the federal government has taken steps to allow employees and 
dependents to continue their health insurance when they would otherwise 
have lost it due to terminated employment, divorce, or other life events. The 
government’s goal has been to try to make group health insurance portable, 
especially for those whose medical history would not allow them to qualify 
for individual health policies. In this section, I fill you in on two federal laws 
that may give you some insurance continuation rights when you lose your 
group health coverage, and I offer advice on when to exercise those rights.
Understanding COBRA
The Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reduction Act (COBRA) gives employees 
of companies that employ 20 or more people the right to continue group 
medical coverage at their expense when their coverage under an employer’s 
plan ends, for a period of time — usually 18 months or 36 months.
 
Generally, COBRA applies only to employers with 20 or more employees. But 
several states have enacted laws requiring COBRA to apply to smaller employ-
ers, too. Check with your state insurance department or click on your state on 
the National Association of Insurance Commissioners Web site (www.naic.
org/state_web_map.htm) to see what the laws are where you live.

263
 Chapter 19: Making the Best Group Health Insurance Decisions
Discovering what triggers eligibility
You’re eligible for COBRA if any of the following occurs:
 
✓ Your employment ends for any reason other than gross misconduct.
 
✓ You, as a covered spouse, and the covered employee get divorced or 
legally separated.
 
✓ Your hours are reduced below the minimum necessary to qualify for 
group coverage.
 
✓ You become eligible for Medicare.
 
✓ You become totally disabled.
 
✓ You cannot continue your children’s coverage after their age disqualifies 
them from continuing under your group plan — the cutoff age is typi-
cally 19 (or up to 25 for a full-time student).
 
✓ The covered employee dies, if you’re the spouse or child of the 
employee. 
Understanding your rights when a COBRA event is triggered
You’ve lost your job. Your health coverage is ending on the last day of this 
month. Your boss has handed you a form to sign with your decision on 
whether you want to continue your health insurance under the company’s 
group policy. You’re wondering, “Do I have to decide right away? How long 
do I have to make payments if I do elect COBRA?”
Here are some answers to those and other questions:
 
✓ Required notices: Your employer must notify you of your COBRA rights 
in writing when you’re first hired and at the time of a triggering event. 
And when the triggering event happens, you have 60 days from the later 
of the day the notice was sent to you or the day your group health cov-
erage ends to elect your COBRA continuation option.
 
✓ Payment of premiums: You have 45 days from the date you officially 
elect to continue your group coverage to pay the employer the first 
premium. You must pay retroactively back to the date your group cov-
erage ended. So if your group coverage ended on June 30 and you elect 
to continue under COBRA on August 29, you have until approximately 
mid-October before the first premium is due. But if the premium is $700 
a month for your family, you would need to remit $2,800 for July, August, 
September, and October, plus another $700 by October 31!
 
 After you’ve elected the coverage, all future monthly premiums for each 
month are due by the first of that month, although, by law, you can be 
up to 30 days late and not lose your coverage.

264
Part V: Managing Life, Health, and Disability Risks 
 
 The employer is not required to, and generally will not, bill you. So if 
you forget to send a payment within 30 days of the due date, you’re 
uninsured retroactively on the due date and you lose all further COBRA 
continuation rights.
 
 If you know that you’ll need the coverage for only a short time (for 
example, you’re eligible for coverage from your new employer in 120 
days), eliminate the risk of accidentally missing a payment due date. Pay 
your ex-employer the full four months of premium payments in advance.
 
✓ Termination: COBRA continuation coverage ends when:
 
• You voluntary terminate it.
 
• Premiums aren’t paid within 30 days of the monthly due date.
 
• A covered person becomes covered under another plan.
 
• A covered person becomes covered by Medicare.
 
• The employer discontinues offering group health insurance to all 
employees.
 
• The COBRA continuation maximum period has ended.
To find out more about COBRA rights in your state, check with your state 
insurance department.
Making your COBRA election decision
 
If you’re not sure whether to exercise your COBRA rights, here are a few gen-
eral guidelines to help you with your decisions:
 
✓ Don’t go even a day without major medical insurance. Remember the 
rule from Chapter 2: Don’t risk more than you can afford to lose.
 
✓ Don’t use temporary health insurance when you’re between jobs, 
if you qualify for COBRA. Always exercise your COBRA continuation 
option instead. Yes, it’s more costly, but unlike temporary policies, it 
covers preexisting conditions.
 
✓ Do exercise your COBRA continuation options anytime your maxi-
mum possible need for coverage won’t exceed the maximum period of 
your COBRA option. The COBRA option is seamless, and it allows you 
to continue using the same doctors in the transition period.
 
✓ If the maximum possible need for coverage exceeds the length of your 
COBRA options, do continue COBRA for the short term while applying 
for individual coverage. Then drop the COBRA option when the individ-
ual policy is approved and all preexisting conditions are fully covered. 
(See Chapter 18 for your rights to an individual policy under HIPAA.)

265
 Chapter 19: Making the Best Group Health Insurance Decisions
Understanding HIPAA
The goal of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 
(HIPAA) is to make it possible for you to move from one job to another when 
you or family members have health problems that otherwise would keep you 
trapped in your current job because either you would be turned down for 
health insurance at a new job or your preexisting medical problems would be 
excluded. (See the sidebar “Hip-HIPAA-hooray!” for an example of how HIPAA 
makes it possible to change jobs.)
HIPAA rules also entitle a person losing group insurance at an employer, after 
COBRA options expire, to apply for individual coverage with no preexisting 
condition exclusion if they meet certain conditions.
 
A preexisting condition generally means any physical or mental health problem 
diagnosed, cared for, or treated in the six months prior to the enrollment date 
on your new group plan.
The HIPAA law makes it possible for you to change jobs even if you have a 
preexisting medical condition by
 
✓ Requiring that all insurers of groups of two or more employees cannot 
decline coverage on a new applicant for group insurance solely for 
health reasons.
 
✓ Limiting the length of time a preexisting condition can apply to a newly 
hired employee to 12 months (18 months for late entrants).
 
✓ Giving credit for any prior group or individual coverage during the 12 
months prior to the effective date of the new group coverage. (For exam-
ple, if you had coverage for 9 of the past 12 months, you would have 
only a 3-month exclusion on preexisting conditions.)
 
✓ Banning pregnancy and prenatal problems from being considered preex-
isting conditions.
 
Be sure to check for the most current information on HIPAA before acting. 
Laws can and do change.
HIPAA rules apply to any application for group health insurance offered by a 
company that has two or more employees. It also applies to applications for 
individual health insurance plans but only if your prior coverage was group 
coverage.

266
Part V: Managing Life, Health, and Disability Risks 
 
HIPAA rules don’t apply to changes from one individual health policy to 
another individual or group health policy. You can still be declined because of 
preexisting problems or have preexisting health problems excluded from the 
coverage. Therefore, don’t ever drop an existing individual plan for another 
individual plan if you have preexisting conditions that won’t be covered under 
the new plan.
Whenever individual or group health coverage you have is terminated (by 
you or by the employer), HIPAA rules require that the insurer provide you 
with a certificate of credible coverage. Give the certificate to your employer 
when you start your new job, and apply for the new company’s group cov-
erage. Likewise, give the certificate to your health insurer when you apply 
for an individual policy. As long as you’ve had health coverage for at least 
12 months, with no lapse of 63 days or more, you can’t be turned down for 
coverage or be subject to any unique limitations on account of preexisting 
conditions.
Hip-HIPAA-hooray!
Before HIPAA
Bill, a bright 43-year-old engineer, is stuck in a 
dead-end job doing work he loathes. He knows 
about some much better-paying jobs doing work 
he would be perfect for, but he can’t take them. 
He’s stuck. Why? Because he has an 8-year-old 
son with an enlarged heart — a condition that 
has already required two surgeries with at least 
two more scheduled in the next five years. If Bill 
takes a new job, either his son will be turned 
down for coverage or the heart condition will 
be excluded. So Bill’s hands are tied. He can’t 
make the job change he would love to make.
After HIPAA
Bill can take the best job he can find without 
any insurance concerns. Because he’s had 
continuous coverage for more than the past 
12 months, HIPAA guarantees that he can’t be 
turned down, nor can there be a preexisting 
condition applied for his son’s heart condition. 
Bill is a happy camper.
But suppose Bill wanted a break. He takes a 
six-month sabbatical between the old job and 
the new. How can he keep all the protection of 
HIPAA? Simple. He just has to elect to continue 
his prior group coverage, under COBRA, during 
the sabbatical.

f you’re approaching 65 years old, you’re about to enter a new dimension — 
a dimension of time and space unlike any place you’ve ever been. You’re 
about to become eligible for America’s national health insurance program for 
seniors — Medicare.
Remember when you were a kid, going to an amusement park? Remember 
the fun house with all the funny mirrors, barrels, slides, and trap doors that 
surprised you? That, for most people, is the Medicare experience. In fact, 
for many seniors, dealing with Medicare choices is a lot more like a haunted 
house: scary, eerie, overwhelming, full of surprises and bad outcomes. And 
those bad outcomes can be financially disastrous for you.
There is no shortage of Medicare information available to seniors — excellent 
information, in fact. However, the amount of the information — no matter how 
excellent — is overwhelming to most people. Don’t feel bad: Medicare — with 
all its options, enrollment periods, supplements, and more — has been one of 
the most difficult insurance programs I’ve had to learn and keep up with.
I have one goal in this chapter: to empower you to make excellent choices 
regarding your Medicare options in a series of several steps. These are the 
exact recommendations I give to my clients who are becoming eligible for 
Medicare.

Part V: Managing Life, Health, and Disability Risks 
In this chapter, I deviate from the norm by sharing my bottom-line recom-
mendations first. Follow that advice, and you’ll be in good shape — you’ll 
have great coverage and the easiest path. If you want the rest of the story, 
you can read on. If you don’t, skip it!
Cutting to the Chase
As you turn 65, you’re in one of three situations:
 
✓ You’re still being covered by an employer’s group health plan (yours or 
your spouse’s).
 
✓ You’re still covered by an individual plan, which will end when you 
turn 65.
 
✓ You’re completely uninsured.
 
Regardless of your current situation, make sure you find an agent you can 
work with who is an expert on Medicare plans and supplements in your geo-
graphic area. The cost of the expertise is usually zero. You’ll have a better-
designed plan with much less frustration. (See Chapter 4 for more information 
on buying insurance the right way — with professional help.)
 
I refer to Medicare eligibility starting at age 65 but, in fact, it can start for 
anyone on a Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI) claim who has been 
receiving benefits for 24 months. It also can start with anyone who has been 
diagnosed with end-stage rental disease (ESRD). My comments in the rest of 
the chapter apply to all three groups of people.
If you’re covered by a group 
health policy at age 65
If you’re covered by a group health policy either by your employer or a 
spouse’s employer, you’re fortunate. In addition to identifying an expert 
agent you can work with, you have two simple steps to follow:
 
1. Sign up for Medicare Part A hospital coverage only, three months 
before you turn 65.

269
 Chapter 20: Buying Medicare and Supplements
 
2. Decline all other Medicare options and Medicare supplement options 
until three months before you’re losing your group coverage.
 
 Then follow the advice in the next section.
If you aren’t covered by a group 
health policy at age 65
The vast majority of retirees fall into this category. If you’re in this group, 
start by identifying an expert agent to help you with your process. I guaran-
tee you that your path will be so much easier for you if you take this advice.
In this scenario, there are three steps:
 
1. Three months before you turn 65, sign up for Medicare Part A hospi-
talization and Medicare Part B medical coverage.
 
 Ask that your start date be the first day of the month in which you turn 65.
 
2. Prepare a list of all your current medications.
 
3. When you get your Medicare card, showing that you have both Part 
A and Part B coverage, make an appointment with your insurance 
agent to talk about Medicare Part D prescription drug coverage and a 
Medicare supplement policy.
 
 Bring your list of current medications and your Medicare card with you 
to your appointment. Work with your agent to find a Part D plan that 
covers all your current medications.
 
 If you don’t take any medications now and you’re inclined not to buy the 
Part D coverage yet, buy it anyway to avoid late-enrollment penalties 
later. Just buy the cheapest plan you can find — don’t worry about 
choosing the perfect Part D coverage plan. You can change plans 
between November 15 and December 31 every year, to start January 1, 
regardless of your health or the number of medications you take.
 
 With your agent’s help, also buy a good Medicare supplement (also 
known as a Medigap policy) to cover most of what Medicare doesn’t 
cover.
 
 Choose your Medigap policy carefully because you can’t change plans 
later on usually without medically qualifying. (See the “Determining 
what makes a good Medicare supplement” section, later in this chap-
ter, for information on what makes a good Medicare supplement 
policy.)

Part V: Managing Life, Health, and Disability Risks 
Understanding Medicare Basics
Medicare has four components:
 
✓ Part A: Part A covers hospital bills. It’s free to you if you’ve worked at 
least ten years in Medicare-covered employment. And it’s a good thing 
it’s free, because Part A is mandatory. You set it up through Medicare.
 
 Part A has a deductible that you must pay before coverage kicks in. It 
doesn’t offer coverage outside the United States.
 
 In addition to the deductible, Part A has significant copayments, set up 
by Uncle Sam, for each day of hospitalization beyond 60 days. It has a 
maximum of 90 days of hospital coverage per illness, with an additional 
60 days that can be used only once in your lifetime.
 
✓ Part B: Part B covers non-hospital bills (doctor and related bills). Part 
B has an income-adjusted monthly cost. For your Part B costs, call 800-
633-4227 or go to www.medicare.gov. Part B is optional, and you set it 
up through Medicare.
 
 Part B has a deductible that you must pay before coverage kicks in. It 
doesn’t offer coverage outside the United States.
 
 Part B has a front-end deductible when you visit a doctor, have lab tests, 
or incur other medical bills. Then Medicare pays 80 percent of approved 
medical and doctor bills, without limit. You’re responsible for the other 
20 percent of approved bills, plus 100 percent of any excess charges 
beyond what Medicare allows. If you have a $100,000 open-heart surgery 
bill, Medicare may, for example, approve $60,000 and pay $48,000 (80 
percent), leaving you owing $52,000!
 
✓ Part C: Part C, a managed-care option, is called Medicare Advantage. 
Part C is optional. (See “Saving Money on Medicare Costs,” later in this 
chapter, for more information on Part C.)
 
✓ Part D: Part D covers prescription drugs. Part D is optional. You pur-
chase it directly from an insurance company, ideally with the help of an 
expert agent.
Most people sign up for parts A, B, and D right away when they become eligi-
ble — usually at age 65. Some people who are still employed and have group 
coverage at work delay buying parts B and D until they retire or lose their 
coverage — which is a good idea, by the way.
Discovering Medicare’s pitfalls
In the beginning of Chapter 18, I lay out the five crucial components of a good 
health insurance plan. See Table 20-1 for how Medicare stacks up.

271
 Chapter 20: Buying Medicare and Supplements
Table 20-1 
Evaluating Medicare
Health Insurance 
Criteria
How Medicare Measures Up
High coverage 
maximum
Room and board are limited to 90 days maximum per 
illness, plus 60 extra days to be used once in your life.
Cap on out-of-pocket 
expenses
Your 20 percent Part B copay has no cap. And, of 
course, Medicare doesn’t pay for any expenses that 
are unapproved by them.
No internal coverage 
limits
Medicare sets limits on doctor charges at their discretion.
Freedom of choice 
of doctors
There are no restrictions on doctors — unless you opt for 
managed care, which I don’t recommend you do.
Worldwide coverage
Medicare provides coverage in the United States and U.S. 
territories only.
Would you buy Medicare if it were sold in the marketplace? No way! It meets 
only one of the five criteria of a good plan — there are no restrictions on the 
doctors you see. In fact, most states wouldn’t even approve the product to be 
sold. Fortunately, the insurance industry has responded to the shortcomings 
of Medicare with Medicare supplement policies (known as Medigap policies) 
that plug many of Medicare’s coverage gaps.
 
Don’t have original Medicare parts A and B without a good Medicare supple-
ment policy. Period.
Determining what makes a 
good Medicare supplement
 
A good Medicare supplement should:
 
✓ Pay all of Part A hospital costs, for at least one year beyond what 
Medicare pays for (90 to 150 days).
 
✓ Pay all of the 20 percent of Part B doctors’ charges that Medicare allows 
but doesn’t pay, plus at least 80 percent of the charges Medicare disallows.
 
✓ Include immediate medical coverage outside the United States — world-
wide — with either no limit or a very high limit.
 
✓ Include coverage for nonemergency medical care, without penalty, when 
the care is provided in a state other than your home state.
 
✓ Include the freedom to choose doctors and hospitals countrywide.

272
Part V: Managing Life, Health, and Disability Risks 
Note: I intentionally left payment of the Part A and Part B deductibles off the 
list of criteria for a good supplement because even the worst Medicare sup-
plement usually pays those. Plus, neither of the deductibles will cause you 
major financial hardship if you have to pay them yourself.
 
The majority of Medicare supplements fail to meet all the criteria I just listed.
The two most common shortcomings of a poor Medicare supplement are the 
following:
 
✓ It doesn’t provide extra days of hospital coverage.
 
✓ It doesn’t pay anything toward the portion of doctors’ charges that 
Medicare disallows.
Federal law gives you a six-month open enrollment period for a Medigap 
policy of your choice — three months before and three months after the start 
date of your Part B coverage. (If you are still employed and/or are covered by 
group insurance, you should wait to sign up for Part B until your group cover-
age ends.) During the open enrollment period, you can get any Medicare sup-
plement you choose, guaranteed, with no medical questions asked. After that 
six-month period ends, you have to medically qualify to get a supplement.
 
Some new changes to Medicare laws also allow you to get any Medicare sup-
plement, regardless of health, if you move out of state, if your plan is canceled, 
or if your benefits are reduced.
 
Start shopping for a supplement about three months before the month of your 
65th birthday. Apply for a Medigap policy about one month before you turn 65 
so that coverage coincides with your Medicare start date. You’ll need to show 
a Medicare ID card proving that you have both Part A and Part B before you 
can apply.
 
Never, under any circumstances, buy more than one Medicare supplement. If 
you currently have a poor one, don’t buy another poor one to supplement your 
first poor policy. Instead, replace the existing, poor policy with a good one.
A very small percentage of unscrupulous insurance salespeople have, over 
the years, sold seniors — worried that major medical costs could wipe out 
their savings — multiple policies. If you’re one of those seniors, find someone 
to help you choose the best policy to keep, and cancel the rest. You can also 
lodge a complaint with your state insurance department — it may prosecute 
the insurance agent.

273
 Chapter 20: Buying Medicare and Supplements
Choosing your Medigap policy
Comparing Medigap policies used to be a horrendous job. Separating the 
handful of good policies from the scores of mediocre ones was a supreme 
challenge even for an insurance expert. But not anymore. The job of compar-
ing Medigap polices has become much easier. In fact, in every state except 
Minnesota, Wisconsin, and Massachusetts, Medigap policies must be one of 
12 flavors — plans A through L.
 
Plans F, G, I, and J meet all the requirements of a good Medicare supplement. 
They’re the only plans that cover the excess charges that Medicare disallows. 
Plans G, I, and J do provide at-home recovery care as well as meeting all the 
other criteria.
For a comparison of the 12 plans, as well as other information on Medigap 
policies, go to www.medicare.gov/medigap/default.asp and down-
load the excellent booklet “Choosing a Medigap Policy: A Guide to Health 
Insurance for People with Medicare.” (You can also order the booklet by 
calling 800-633-4227.)
Select and save a bundle
Medicare allows insurance companies that 
offer Medicare supplement policies to some-
what limit the network of participating physi-
cians for a significant reduction in cost. These 
plans are called select plans.
Case in point: Minnesota, where I hang my 
shingle, is one of many states that allow insur-
ers to offer the select products. Blue Cross 
of Minnesota does just that under the Senior 
Gold label. The only condition is, for care in 
Minnesota, you must limit your choice to a Blue 
Cross of Minnesota provider network, which 
represents over 90 percent of doctors and spe-
cialists in Minnesota and all the hospitals. Even 
the Mayo Clinic belongs. You can see special-
ists at any time without a referral. Plus, if you’re 
traveling or even move south for the winter, 
you can see any Blue Cross–affiliated doctor 
or hospital, and claims will be paid exactly as 
if you were receiving care in Minnesota. All 
claims are paperless (meaning, you don’t get 
stuck with the paperwork headaches). The 
only catch: If you get nonemergency care from 
a non–Blue Cross provider, that care will not be 
covered by the Medigap policy.
How big are the savings with the Blue Cross 
select plan? A whopping 40 percent to 60 per-
cent off of Blue Cross’s full-access plans. Even 
if you move to another state, you can keep this 
Medicare supplement plan. That’s why, in most 
cases, I recommend Senior Gold for most of my 
clients.
There are several other quality plans in 
Minnesota and elsewhere that are similar. 
Make sure to ask your agent about the select 
plans she has available.

274
Part V: Managing Life, Health, and Disability Risks 
 
Medigap policies are available from private insurance companies, but insur-
ance companies do not have to offer all 12 plans, so you may have to shop 
around to find the plan you want.
Getting prescription drug coverage
Medicare Part D prescription drug coverage is purchased from private insur-
ers (unlike Medicare’s Part A and Part B, which are purchased directly from 
Medicare itself). Private insurers service the Part D coverage and pay claims 
and then are reimbursed by Medicare behind the scenes. Because the gov-
ernment is picking up the majority of the prescription drug costs, the insur-
ance company’s administrative charge typically is very small.
Part D must have been created by a committee — it’s confusing and illogical. 
You pay an annual deductible. Then Part D pays about 75 percent of the 
next couple of thousand dollars of the bill. Then, for some reason, you’re 
completely out of pocket from that point on, until your total out-of-pocket 
expenses in the calendar year exceed $4,000. (These amounts vary over the 
years, but you get the idea.) This uncovered $4,000+ gap is often referred to 
as the “doughnut hole.” When you have hit that out-of-pocket maximum, Part 
D pays approximately 95 percent of the balance of your prescription drugs 
for the rest of the calendar year. The worst part of the plan is that, by law, 
you can’t buy insurance to cover the $4,000+ doughnut hole. (What possibly 
would possess them to make insuring that risk illegal? That’s what I want 
to know.)
 
Here’s what you need to know about your Part D decision:
 
✓ Choose a skilled agent to help you make a good Part D choice.
 
✓ Put together a list of all your medications and pick a Part D plan from 
an insurance company with a good reputation and with a plan that 
covers all the meds you currently take. Not all Part D drug plans cover 
exactly the same medications in the same way.
 
✓ Even if you don’t want prescription drug coverage now because you 
don’t use prescribed drugs currently, choose some plan — the cheap-
est you can find. Otherwise, when you do want the coverage later on, 
there’s a 12 percent penalty added for each year you delayed your 
enrollment — and that penalty lasts as long as you live!
 
✓ Don’t agonize over your choice. Even if you chose poorly, every year 
from November 15 through December 31, you can change plans to 
another plan you want, regardless of your health. The effective date of 
the change will be the following January 1.

275
 Chapter 20: Buying Medicare and Supplements
Saving Money on Medicare Costs
There are two primary ways to purchase Medicare. You can buy Part A 
(hospital), Part B (medical), Part D (prescription drugs), and a Medicare 
supplement. This approach is the one I recommend to most of my clients 
because it gives them the broadest choice of provider care.
But suppose your budget is tight and you’re willing to sacrifice some benefits 
in exchange for much lower costs. In this case, Medicare Part C (also known 
as Medicare Advantage) may be a good option for you. Part C is available in 
several flavors — the most common are
 
✓ Health maintenance organizations (HMOs): HMOs usually require you 
to choose a primary-care clinic where you’ll get most of your care. You 
see a specialist only if your primary-care doctor will refer you to one. 
There usually is no out-of-network coverage except for emergencies. 
Because of all these limitations, I don’t recommend the HMO option.
 
✓ Preferred provider organizations (PPOs): PPOs usually have a broader 
network that includes both primary-care doctors and specialists. You’re 
free to see any one of them without a referral. PPOs also usually let you 
choose an out-of-network provider, too, subject to higher copayments. 
For these reasons, I recommend the PPO option for those who need 
to minimize insurance premium costs. However, whenever you have a 
reduction in premium costs, there are always some trade-offs, such as 
higher deductibles and copayments.
Whatever type of Part C plan you decide on can also include prescription 
drug coverage. Drug coverage and penalties follow the same rules as Part D.
To apply for Medicare Advantage, you must first enroll in Medicare parts A 
and B. As with original Medicare, I recommend applying about three months 
before you turn 65 or otherwise become eligible for Medicare. You must 
reside in the plan area to be eligible. If you move to a different geographic 
area outside the plan area, you’ll have to change Medicare Advantage plans. 
Also, Medicare Advantage plans don’t work well for those who travel exten-
sively or move to a different part of the country.
Here are the advantages that Medicare Advantage (using a PPO) has over 
original Medicare with a good Medicare supplement:
 
✓ You have much lower front-end costs.
 
✓ You can see out-of-network providers (subject to higher copays).
 
✓ You have an annual out-of-pocket maximum for copayments and 
deductibles.

276
Part V: Managing Life, Health, and Disability Risks 
 
✓ You get unlimited hospitalization coverage beyond what Part A 
Medicare covers (90 to 150 days). Drug coverage can be added, giving 
you one source of care and one bill.
 
✓ You don’t need a Medicare supplement policy, because participating 
providers under Medicare Advantage agree to accept whatever Medicare 
allows as payment in full.
 
✓ You can change Medicare Advantage plans once a year regardless of 
your health.
 
✓ Your plan can include medical services not covered by Medicare parts A 
and B (annual physicals, eye exams, dental, and so on).
And here are the disadvantages of Medicare Advantage:
 
✓ You pay higher deductibles and copays out of pocket.
 
✓ You have less choice when it comes to seeing specialists.
 
✓ Travel coverage is limited to only emergency care in network. 
Otherwise, for nonemergency care, travel coverage is considered out of 
network and the copayments are substantially higher.
 
✓ You must change plans if you ever move out of the plan service area. 
You will, however, automatically qualify for a new Medicare Advantage 
PPO plan of your choice in the new location.
 
✓ The plan can change its coverage dramatically or withdraw from the 
market altogether. You’ll qualify for a new Medicare Advantage plan 
regardless of your health if that should happen.
For more information on Medicare Advantage plans, call 800-633-4227 or go 
to www.medicare.gov/Choices/Advantage.asp.
 
Medicare does offer financial help with the cost of Medicare parts B and D for 
those with limited income and assets. To see if you qualify, call Medicare at 
800-633-4227. If you’re already in the system prior to turning 65 (for example, 
because you’re receiving Medicaid benefits), you’ll probably be automatically 
enrolled.

Chapter 21
Evaluating Your Need for 
Long-Term-Care Insurance
In This Chapter
▶ Measuring your need for long-term-care insurance
▶ Qualifying for Medicaid assistance
▶ Understanding what makes a great long-term-care policy
▶ Buying the policy the right way
▶ Understanding how you can benefit from the new Medicaid partnership program
P
eople are living longer than ever before. That’s the good news. The bad 
news is that, at some point in their lives, many of the people who reach 
age 65 will need assistance with activities of daily living — bathing, dressing, 
eating, toileting, transferring from your bed to a wheelchair and back, and so 
on. Many will face what we all fear the most — Alzheimer’s disease or some 
other cognitive impairment. Unless you get help from your family, you’ll have 
to hire outside help and pay for that help by draining your investments. Or 
you could buy long-term-care insurance to pay some or all of your costs.
In this chapter, I show you how to determine whether you need long-term-
care insurance, what to look for in a policy, and how to buy the policy that’s 
right for you.
Determining Your Need for 
Long-Term-Care Insurance
Costs for long-term care vary geographically, but they’re approaching six fig-
ures annually. In 20 years, they’ll likely be close to $250,000 a year! One of the 
guiding principles of this book is: Don’t risk more than you can afford to lose 
(see Chapter 2). Suppose you stay in a care facility six years. At $250,000 a 
year, that’s $1.5 million you have to part with! That qualifies as a major finan-
cial risk for most people.

278
Part V: Managing Life, Health, and Disability Risks 
Another guiding principle is to consider the odds. This principle, in effect, 
says that if the odds are extremely unlikely (think: earthquake in Minnesota), 
this may be a risk worth taking without insurance. So, just what are the odds? 
For those who live to age 65, a whopping 50 percent will need long-term care 
for at least two years. Want to hear something even more startling? Forty-five 
percent of the people who are currently receiving long-term care are between 
the ages of 18 and 64!
Okay, so long-term-care costs can be hugely expensive and the odds of need-
ing care are very high. This is not a risk you can ignore. In this section, I tell 
you who doesn’t need long-term-care insurance and who does need it.
Who doesn’t need long-term-care 
insurance
To answer the question about who does need long-term-care insurance, I 
think it’s good to first look at who doesn’t. There are three groups of people 
who do not need long-term care insurance:
 
✓ People who have substantial assets: People with a ton of money can 
easily pay for long-term care from liquid funds without ever depleting 
them, regardless of how long they need care. And they’re completely 
comfortable using those resources for that care. What qualifies as “a 
ton of money”? Figure at least $3 million in liquid assets (such as cash, 
stocks, and bonds).
 
✓ People who qualify for the federal Medicaid program: Medicaid pays 
long-term care costs for those who are at or near poverty levels. To find 
out what those current qualifications are, call your state Medicaid office.
 
✓ People with moderate assets who are willing to spend down those 
assets on long-term care to near-poverty levels at which point 
Medicaid will pay the balance: If you don’t have any children or heirs, 
you may be willing to spend down all your assets — after all, you can’t 
take it with you, right?
Who needs long-term-care insurance
Basically, if you don’t fall into one of the three categories in the preceding 
section, you need long-term-care insurance. Here are people who fall into the 
need-it category:

279
 Chapter 21: Evaluating Your Need for Long-Term-Care Insurance
 
✓ People with substantial assets who want to pass those assets on to 
their children or favorite charity and don’t want their long-term care 
costs to deplete that inheritance.
 
✓ People with moderate assets who don’t want to drain those assets: 
Maybe you don’t want the cost of that care to impoverish your spouse. Or 
you simply want to be a responsible adult and pay your own way. Or you 
don’t want to overburden the already underfunded Medicaid program.
 
✓ People who want choices as to where they can get care: Maybe you 
want to be cared for at home or in a nice assisted living community. If 
you need to go to a nursing home for care, maybe you want to be able to 
choose among the nicer, better facilities. Medicaid generally only pays 
for nursing home care in a facility of its choice.
 
✓ People who want to give their families permission to get professional 
help right away rather than forcing their family to try to coordinate 
and deliver care themselves.
 
The bottom line is that if you fall into the group that wants or needs long-term-
care insurance, long-term-care costs represent a major risk area that definitely 
needs to be insured. For you, there are six major risk areas for which you need 
to be well-protected:
 
✓ Premature death (see Chapter 23)
 
✓ Long-term disability (see Chapter 22)
 
✓ Major medical bills (see Chapters 18 to 20)
 
✓ Major damage or destruction to your personal residence (see Part III)
 
✓ Large lawsuits (see Chapters 15 and 16)
 
✓ Long-term-care expenses
You have to address this risk. If you don’t, you have a major gap in your 
insurance program.
 
How expensive is long-term-care insurance? Very. Anytime you have a risk 
that has a high probability of happening and for which the costs could be sub-
stantial, the cost of insuring that risk is also high. A good example: major med-
ical insurance. Your own cost depends on numerous variables, including your 
age when you buy it, the amount of coverage you’ll need per month, the 
number of years you want the coverage, and more.

280
Part V: Managing Life, Health, and Disability Risks 
Knowing When to Buy
Make sure all the other five major risk areas — premature death, long-term dis-
ability, major medical bills, major damage to your residence, large lawsuits — 
are all covered adequately and in balance. Those risks are higher priority 
because they have a good probability of happening right now. Your long-term-
care risk — although substantial and very likely — is unlikely to happen this 
very minute.
That said, if you’re going to be buying anyway, it’s less expensive to buy it 
when you’re younger. There are three costs of delaying the purchase of long-
term-care insurance:
 
✓ If you wait and your health goes south, you may not even qualify for a 
policy. I learned this lesson the hard way!
 
✓ The cost of care is escalating faster than the consumer price index. 
What costs $100,000 today may cost $250,000 in 20 years — especially 
with all the Baby Boomers adding to demand for care.
 
✓ Costs increase with age. The cost of waiting is not only expensive 
because you’re older but also expensive because you have to buy con-
siderably more coverage ten years from now.
Introducing the New Medicaid 
Partnership Program
Suppose that you’re in the second group of those needing long-term care: 
You’re not financially independent. And you don’t like your choices: Either 
pay for expensive insurance that’s tough on your budget, or begrudgingly 
spend down your assets to practically nothing and then become eligible for 
Medicaid.
Improving medical technology allowing more people to live longer, combined 
with a large number of people reaching retirement age, each year the number 
of people needing long-term care increases — and it will continue to increase 
greatly for years to come. The already underfunded Medicaid program is 
going to need some additional significant funds somewhere unless something 
changes. Maintaining the status quo won’t be a good thing for our burgeoning 
deficit nor will it be a good thing for those who watch their nest egg get fully 
depleted by their care.

281
 Chapter 21: Evaluating Your Need for Long-Term-Care Insurance
 
In order to reduce the drain on Medicaid, Congress passed the Deficit 
Reduction Act of 2005 — part of which addressed this Medicaid funding prob-
lem. The goal was to motivate consumers to buy private insurance on their 
own and, thus, significantly reduce Medicaid outlays for long-term care. And if 
the consumer’s coverage ran out, they could still get their remaining care from 
Medicaid without having to impoverish themselves.
Here’s how it works: You buy a long-term-care policy on yourself. Assume 
then at some later date you end up needing long-term care. Further assume 
that your policy pays $500,000 for your care and your coverage runs out 
while you still need care. At that point, you try to qualify for Medicaid ben-
efits. The government rewards you for having a policy that has already paid 
$500,000 by ignoring $500,000 of your assets in the Medicaid qualification 
process. This is huge!
This is a win-win situation for both consumers and the government. Someone 
with long-term-care insurance reduces the chance that she’ll need Medicaid 
funding — which is good for Medicaid. If that person eventually runs out of 
insurance, she can then preserve an amount equal to whatever her long-term-
care policy has paid for her family’s benefit. Her ongoing need for care won’t 
completely drain the family’s fortune and create hardship for her loved ones.
You now can protect all or a part of your estate from having to be drained as 
a result of your needing long-term care:
 
✓ If you want to protect all of your current estate, you buy a long-term-
care policy for the full cost of today’s care with lifetime benefits and a 5 
percent compounded annual benefit increase without any correspond-
ing premium increases. Then you’ll never have to deal with Medicaid.
 
✓ If, on the other hand, you’re willing to spend some of your assets 
down but still preserve say $500,000 or $1 million, buy a long-term-
care policy that will pay that much in benefits (a policy paying $250 per 
day equals $7,500 a month, which is $90,000 a year). To shelter $500,000, 
you would need a five-year or six-year benefit period. To shelter $1 mil-
lion, you need a ten-year benefit.
 
Make sure your monthly benefit is high enough to fully cover your costs. 
You’re better off erring on the high side so you don’t have to pay out of 
pocket. It’s better to have $10,000 a month of coverage for three years 
($360,000) than to have $6,000 a month for five years (also $360,000). Why? 
Because any shortfall in monthly coverage will drain your personal assets, 
whereas any excess coverage you don’t need will carry forward.

Buying the Policy
 
Before you buy a long-term-care insurance policy, ask your state insurance 
department to send you information, as well as any comparative studies it has 
done. Be sure to request a copy of the booklet put out by the National 
Association of Insurance Commissioners called “A Shopper’s Guide to Long-
Term Care Insurance.” You can order it at https://external-apps.naic.
org/insprod/Consumer_info.jsp. Also, research the current costs of 
long-term care in your geographic area, such as the cost of a semiprivate 
room in a nice care facility.
In this section, I walk you through buying a policy — from finding an expert 
to setting your coverages to choosing your company.
Working with an expert
Start by finding a skilled long-term-care insurance agent (see Chapter 4). Try 
to find someone with lots of expertise with long-term care. Check with your 
own insurance agent first. If you’re fortunate, the insurance agent you’re 
already working with is also an expert on long-term-care insurance. If your 
My dad’s tale
When my dad, who was of relatively modest 
means, was around 80 years old, he had a 
stroke that took away his speech and the use 
of the right side of his body, confining him to a 
wheelchair and creating the need for constant 
help with bathing, dressing, eating, toileting, 
and so on. He immediately went into a nurs-
ing home for that care. After we sold his home, 
he had about $350,000 to his name. Four years 
of care later, he had spent down the entire 
amount of his care to the point of eligibility for 
Medicaid — namely, $3,000. He was approved 
for Medicaid benefits and he was transferred to 
a Medicaid-approved nursing home, where he 
is living today. There’s a good chance he’ll need 
care several more years. Dad didn’t have long-
term-care insurance, but even if he did, with his 
extended need for care, it probably would’ve 
run out and still drained his assets, benefiting 
Medicaid only and not his family.
If he’d purchased a long-term-care policy under 
the new long-term care partnership provisions 
that paid, for example, $200,000 in benefits, he, 
rather than Medicaid, would have reaped those 
benefits. His eligibility for Medicaid would now 
be $203,000 instead of $3,000. This new law 
would have allowed him to shelter an additional 
$200,000 from the government for the benefit of 
his family.

283
 Chapter 21: Evaluating Your Need for Long-Term-Care Insurance
agent is not an expert with long-term-care coverage, he probably can refer 
you to someone who is. If not, check with other trusted professionals in your 
life — your financial planner, your accountant, and so on. Then meet with 
one or two of the agents who seem the most knowledgeable and have them 
determine your needs first before they quote you any prices. If they quote 
you prices before determining your needs, choose a different agent.
Designing coverage specifications
With the help of your agent, you’re ready to design the coverage specifica-
tions you want. You only have to make a handful of decisions to buy a policy.
Step 1: Monthly benefit
Start by taking the average daily semiprivate room rate in your area. Then 
compare that with the cost of home care (if you’re willing to pay more, if nec-
essary, to get care at home rather than at a nursing home). Select the higher 
of the two numbers as your daily coverage need. Then multiply that result by 
30 to calculate your monthly coverage need.
 
Home-care costs may be higher than nursing-home care — significantly higher 
if you need 24-hour round-the-clock care.
 
Most companies give you the option of buying a daily benefit or monthly bene-
fit. If you have the choice, always choose the monthly benefit. If you receive 
some of your care at home, you may not need help every day. The monthly 
option gives you more flexibility for handling fluctuating daily costs.
Step 2: Waiting period
A waiting period (also known as an elimination period) is the number of 
months that you’re willing to pay for your own care before you need the cov-
erage to kick in. It’s a lot like the deductible on car insurance. Your choices 
usually are 30 days, 60 days, 90 days, 180 days, and sometimes 365 days. 
(The waiting period options for 60 days and beyond usually have to be met 
only once in a lifetime and generally do not have to be consecutive. They can 
be cumulative over time.) Like a deductible, the longer you can wait before 
coverage begins, the less expensive the premium.
Choose a time frame that meets two criteria:
 
✓ You’re comfortable with the length of time.
 
✓ The premium savings are large enough to justify taking extra risk.

284
Part V: Managing Life, Health, and Disability Risks 
 
Usually a 60-day or 90-day wait is the best value. If you’re not sure which, get 
quotes for both options. Ask for quotes with a zero-day waiting period for 
home health care; the price for that option isn’t too high, because, if you don’t 
need daily care, it’s usually less expensive to provide care at home than it is in 
a facility.
If you have a spouse who can provide some of your home health care, you 
may not need care every day. Some insurance companies will give you a full 
seven-days credit toward your facility waiting period for just one day of home 
health care per week!
Step 3: Where you want your care
 
Always choose care anywhere. Don’t limit yourself to care in a facility. You 
have no idea what type of injury or illness will necessitate your needing care. 
Keep your options open. Anything else is gambling.
You have a choice of either 50 percent or 100 percent coverage at home. 
Choose the 100 percent option for the same reason.
Step 4: How many years you want coverage
This choice will depend on why you’re buying long-term-care insurance. If 
you’re wealthy and you’re buying it to protect your children’s inheritance, 
choose the equivalent of ten years, or lifetime if it’s available.
If you’re buying coverage to shelter assets from Medicaid eligibility under the 
new partnership program (see “Introducing the New Medicaid Partnership 
Program,” earlier in this chapter), first determine the dollar amount of assets 
you want to protect and then buy enough coverage to accomplish that.
If you’re married, many insurance companies offer shared-care options. 
Instead of buying two six-year policies, for about the same money, you can 
share ten years. One of you may not need care at all or you may need it for a 
very short time. Whatever is unused at that spouse’s death is available to the 
other spouse.
Step 5: Your inflation option
Obviously, long-term-care costs increase every year and will continue to do 
so ad infinitum. So, if you buy $6,000 per month, and you don’t need care for 
20 years, the costs at that time may be $20,000 to $25,000 per month. Without 
some change in the benefit, your $6,000 wouldn’t put much of a dent in the 
actual costs.
Here are your usual inflation options:

285
 Chapter 21: Evaluating Your Need for Long-Term-Care Insurance
 
✓ Option 1: No built-in inflation benefit: If you want to increase your 
benefits, you’ll need to physically complete an application and qualify 
medically. You also have to buy the additional coverage you need at the 
current rates and at your attained age.
 
✓ Option 2: A guaranteed future purchase option: This guarantees the 
right to buy additional insurance regardless of your health (15 percent 
every three years). The downside is that you still have to pay cur-
rent rates for your current age. At some point, the additional amount 
becomes cost prohibitive.
 
✓ Option 3: A 5 percent simple interest annual adjustment: Here the ben-
efits increase a flat 5 percent per year, again at no increase in premium. 
Not a bad option.
 
✓ Option 4: An automatic increase annually tied to the Consumer Price 
Index (CPI): The good news about this option is that your benefit is 
increasing with no increase in premium. The bad news is that the price 
index for long-term-care costs may be higher than the general CPI 
change. This is a good choice, though, if there is no cap on the percent-
age of increase.
 
✓ Option 5: A 5 percent compound interest annual adjustment: This is 
my personal favorite and the recommendation of most financial experts 
in the field. The good news is that the benefits are increasing on a com-
pound basis, again with no increase in premium. The bad news is that 
this is the most expensive inflation option. The reason that the cost 
is double the price of the no-inflation option is because the premium 
will never increase due to this annual increase in benefit. This is really 
important for seniors on fixed incomes. This option is also available at a 
3 percent compound rate and is correspondingly less expensive.
 
I recommend that you get a price for options 4 and 5. Option 4, especially for 
younger people, is often considerably less expensive than Option 5.
Choosing your insurance company
Because people who buy long-term-care insurance often don’t need the cov-
erage for several years, you have to be more careful about the company that 
you’re going to do business with. Your company should have
 
✓ A very strong financial rating, so they’ll still be around 20 years from 
now when you need them
 
✓ Several years of long-term-care insurance experience so the company is 
committed to the long haul
 
✓ A history of taking only modest rate increases on existing customers

286
Part V: Managing Life, Health, and Disability Risks 
The most well-known source of financial rating for insurance companies is 
A.M. Best (www.ambest.com), which has been rating insurance companies 
for more than a hundred years. Its highest ratings are A+ and A++ — try to 
deal only with companies that have one of those two ratings.
Introducing some new twists
If you’re very affluent and you’re buying long-term-care insurance primarily 
to protect your children’s inheritance, there are a couple of new ideas on the 
market that involve the payment of one single premium.
One concept combines long-term care with permanent life insurance. You 
deposit a lump sum — say, $100,000 — with the insurance company. Your 
loved ones might receive $165,000 of life insurance whenever you die. In addi-
tion, you’ll have $250,000 of long-term-care coverage if you need that first. If 
you decide to drop the policy before you need either one, you can generally 
get almost all your original $100,000 deposit back. Coverage basically costs 
you the interest on your money.
If you’re affluent and you don’t need life insurance, another possibility is a 
tax-sheltered annuity combined with long-term-care insurance. Again, you 
put a lump sum into the policy — say, $100,000. If you need long-term care, 
you’ll receive benefits of, for example, $200,000 and if you die without need-
ing long-term care, your heirs will get your $100,000 back. Again, the cost of 
long-term-care insurance is the interest on your money.
These are not real life examples, just illustrations to show how the concept 
works. If you fall into either one of these categories, ask your long-term-care 
advisor what options might be appropriate for you.

hen you’re building your insurance program, you need to deal with 
five possible causes of a major financial loss through insurance:
 
✓ Lawsuits
 
✓ Destruction of home and personal property
 
✓ Major medical bills
 
✓ Premature death with dependents
 
✓ Long-term disability
Most people carry protection for the first four threats, but they don’t protect 
themselves from long-term loss of income from illness or injury unless their 
employer provides the insurance. Yet, before age 65, a person is three times 
more likely to become disabled for six months or more than to die.
Adding to the seriousness of the situation, the economic loss to disabil-
ity survivors is greater than it is for families after the death of a loved one 
because, not only is the income lost, but the disabled person still needs a 
roof over her head, still has ongoing living expenses (such as groceries, utili-
ties, and mortgage payments), and often needs additional care. Without this 
critical coverage in your insurance program, you’re risking a major financial 
crisis — and it doesn’t have to be this way.

288
Part V: Managing Life, Health, and Disability Risks 
In this chapter, I fill you in on how best to plug this serious gap in protection. 
I start by applying three of the principles from Chapter 2 to your disability 
insurance decision. Then I give you tips on how much disability coverage 
you need, guiding you through buying your own disability insurance, without 
leaving any gaps.
To Buy or not to Buy: 
That Is the Question
In Chapter 2, I introduce you to seven tried-and-true principles to help you 
make good insurance buying decisions. Here are three of them that you can 
apply to the decision as to whether you need long-term disability insurance:
 
✓ Don’t risk more than you can afford to lose. Ask yourself if your pay-
check stopped today, and you didn’t have it for the next five or ten 
years, what would your life be like? How would that impact your making 
the mortgage payment? Putting food on the table? Your family’s peace of 
mind and stress level? If you don’t have another source to replace that 
lost income, you need to have long-term disability insurance.
 
✓ Consider the odds. Just how likely is a long-term disability? Pretty likely 
regardless of your age. Here are some stats:
 
• One out of three people in the workforce today will be disabled 
three months or more before age 65. One out of seven will be dis-
abled for life.
 
• If you’re disabled for as long as one year, your chances of being 
disabled for a long time are staggeringly high. In fact, you have a 40 
percent chance of being disabled more than five years!
 
• If you’re 25 years old and an injury or illness knocks you out of 
work for just three months, you have a one in four chance of 
having that disability last for life. That could be 40 years or more!
 
 Clearly, the odds of a long-term disability causing you severe financial 
hardship are way too high to ignore.
 
✓ Don’t risk a lot for a little. If the risk is great and the insurance cost is 
relatively small in relation to the risk, you should buy the insurance. 
So, just how expensive is long-term disability insurance? On average, 
the cost runs 2 percent to 3 percent of your taxable income. If you don’t 
have long-term disability insurance right now, you’re definitely risking a 
lot for a little.

289
 Chapter 22: Managing the Risk of Long-Term Disability
 
The risk of disability is real. And when it happens, it can last a long time. 
Protecting yourself from this huge financial risk with a good long-term disabil-
ity insurance policy won’t cost you much. Remember: The only thing worse 
than a long-term disability is a long-term disability with no income.
Determining How Much 
Insurance You Need
The goal of a good long-term disability strategy is to provide you with enough 
personal and insurance resources that you won’t have to make major life 
changes (such as selling your home), if a disability occurs. Being disabled is 
traumatic enough without having the added pain and stress of big changes in 
your lifestyle.
Having the right amount of coverage is crucial. Too little coverage may mean 
that you still have to make major life changes in the aftermath of a disabling 
injury. Too much coverage and you’re spending money unnecessarily.
To figure out how much disability insurance you need, you have to determine 
how much money you need every month to pay the bills. You have two ways 
to determine your monthly income need:
 
✓ The hard way: The hard way is to make up a budget of your monthly 
expenses from memory. Not only is that method extremely time con-
suming — leading to such evils as procrastination — but I’ve found, 
through working with scores of clients over the years, that it’s also very 
inaccurate. People tend to underestimate their actual needs by about 20 
percent.
 
✓ The easy way: The easy way is the approach I recommend. The compu-
tation can be accomplished in about 20 minutes and is extremely accu-
rate. Just grab your last three months’ check registers for your personal 
checking account(s). On the top of page one of each statement, you see 
a figure for the total amount of checks written for that month. Add the 
totals for each of the three months and divide by 3 to come up with a 
monthly average income need. If any particular month is extremely dis-
torted — because you took an expensive vacation, for example, or were 
paying for holiday gifts — use a different month. Whatever number you 
come up with, add 10 percent to 20 percent (because expenses normally 
increase during a disability).
 
Insurance companies limit how much coverage you can buy to about 80 per-
cent to 90 percent of your take-home pay. You may not be able to buy as much 
as you’d like to have. If this happens, take their maximum and make sure you 
have a purchase option included so that, as your income grows, your cover-
age can, too.

Part V: Managing Life, Health, and Disability Risks 
Talking the Talk: The Special 
Lingo of Disability Insurance
Elimination period. Own-occupation. Residual. Noncancelable. Disability 
insurance policies have their own unique terminology, using language you 
won’t find in any other insurance policy. You need to understand these and 
other terms to make a good decision on those policy features that are impor-
tant to you. In this section, I fill you in.
Total disability
A person is considered totally disabled if he is unable to perform all the 
principal duties of his job, or any other job for which he’s reasonably suited, 
considering his income, education, and experience. The pitfall to be wary of 
here is that if you can work only a few hours a week, you would have zero 
coverage under a policy covering only total disability.
Residual disability
Residual disability usually means proportionate coverage when you’re unable 
to work full-time (from a back injury or a heart attack, for example) and usu-
ally resulting in an income loss of at least 20 percent. Under policies that 
cover only total disabilities, you would not receive a dime in benefits. But 
with residual coverage, if you work part time and earn 40 percent of your pre-
disability income, you’ll receive 60 percent of your monthly benefit.
 
I strongly recommend this coverage for absolutely everyone! Be sure to add a 
residual disability coverage option to any disability policy you buy. Without it, 
you won’t get paid a disability insurance payment if you can still work even 
one or two days a week.
 
Make sure that the residual benefit period isn’t limited. If your disability cover-
age goes to age 65, so should the residual coverage. (Many benefits last only 
six months!)
Elimination period
The term elimination period is disability lingo for deductible. The elimination 
period or waiting period represents the number of months you’re willing to 
wait, while disabled, before coverage begins. Usually you have a choice of 30, 

291
 Chapter 22: Managing the Risk of Long-Term Disability
60, 90, or 180 days. Your choice will depend on how much money you have in 
the bank as a safety net combined with how long your employer will continue 
your salary or provide sick leave following a disability.
 
The longer you can wait, the lower your premium will be. For example, waiting 
60 days typically gives you about a 30 percent savings compared with a 30-day 
elimination period. Waiting 90 days saves you about another 10 percent. 
Premiums continue to go down as you increase the elimination period beyond 
three months, but by much smaller amounts. Your best bet is usually either a 
60-day or 90-day elimination period.
 
Because there are always delays in getting a claim check, if you’re trying to 
decide between two elimination periods, choose the shorter of the two. For 
example, if you choose a 60-day elimination period, the payment for the next 
30 days of disability comes to you only after you’ve been disabled for 30 days. 
So the first claim check you receive with a 60-day wait will come to you 90 
days after your disability start date.
Benefit period
Benefit period refers to the duration for which you want a disability insur-
ance paycheck — typically two years, five years, to age 65, or for your 
entire lifetime. Coverage to age 65 or lifetime coverage is obviously best if 
you can afford the cost — it costs about 30 percent more than a five-year 
benefit. Because many disabled people recover within five years, the five-
year option is also a reasonable choice if you couldn’t otherwise afford the 
coverage you need.
 
If you have to choose the five-year plan, be prepared to make a major lifestyle 
change if you face a disability that continues beyond five years. The good 
news is that at least you’ll have five years to prepare for it.
 
I don’t recommend the two-year benefit period, because a large percentage of 
disabilities last beyond two years.
Noncancelable versus 
guaranteed renewable
You have two options regarding the renewability of your coverage: noncan-
celable and guaranteed renewable contracts. Both promise to renew coverage 
to age 65. Noncancelable contracts also guarantee never to raise the price up 
to age 65. Guaranteed renewable contracts can raise their overall rates any-
time, but they cannot single you out individually for an increase.

292
Part V: Managing Life, Health, and Disability Risks 
How important is a price guarantee? Disability insurance companies have 
experienced a worse-than-expected claims record over the past several 
years. Several companies have closed doors, and others have merged or 
been sold. The number of insurance companies offering individual disability 
policies has decreased dramatically. Those insurers that are still active have 
taken some large rate increases on their guaranteed renewable contracts.
 
Don’t let a price guarantee be the biggest issue in your selection. Buy all the 
coverage and features you need first. That’s the highest priority. Then, if you 
can afford another 20 percent or so to lock in the price, do so.
Cost of living adjustment rider
If you’re disabled for several years, the monthly disability check you receive 
has diminishing spending power. The cost of living adjustment (COLA) 
option annually increases your benefit while you’re disabled by some prede-
termined percentage (usually from 3 percent to 6 percent).
 
If you’re buying coverage to age 65, COLA is a pretty important option to 
include in your coverage. However, if you’re buying only a five-year benefit or 
if you have a spouse whose projected future income will be rising dramatically, 
you may not need this rider.
Future purchase option
This option guarantees, when you apply and qualify for your first policy, that, 
regardless of your future health, you can increase your coverage every one to 
three years, up to the optional limit you’ve purchased.
 
If you think that you may need more disability coverage later, with increased 
expenses such as a bigger house, more children, or simple cost of living 
increases, I strongly recommend that you pay just a little more now for the 
privilege of being able to increase your benefit in the future regardless of 
health.
 
A rather high percentage of people are declined for disability insurance due to 
back problems, diabetes, high cholesterol, and so on. You may be such a 
person in the future.
The future purchase option eliminates the possibility of your being turned 
down for additional coverage later. And it’s usually quite inexpensive. 
Not only does the option guarantee you the opportunity to buy additional 
insurance regardless of your future health, but it also greatly simplifies the 
purchase of such additional insurance because no applications or physical 
exams are required.

293
 Chapter 22: Managing the Risk of Long-Term Disability
 
The difference between future purchase options and COLA options is that the 
purchase option increases your coverage before you become disabled, and 
COLA increases your benefits while you’re disabled. I recommend them both.
Social insurance rider
A social insurance rider pays you an additional monthly benefit that is 
reduced or eliminated when you qualify for Social Security disability benefits 
or workers’ compensation benefits. How this rider works varies dramatically 
among insurance companies. Just know that it exists and what its purpose is.
 
Because total disability creates such a hardship on a family, in planning I like 
to disregard any possible Social Security benefits — that way, they can be an 
inflation hedge or cushion for unplanned expenses. I recommend you do the 
same. (For more on Social Security, see the nearby sidebar.)
Return of premium rider
The return of premium rider was created for people who want their cake and 
want to eat it, too. After a number of years — typically 20 to 25 — the policy 
refunds you all your premiums, less any paid claims. Sounds great, right? It is 
great — except for one catch: It adds 30 percent to 40 percent a year to your 
costs! For that reason, and because most people may buy less insurance cov-
erage than they need, I rarely recommend it.
Catastrophic disability rider
The catastrophic disability rider provides additional cash benefits over and 
above your loss of income to help pay the costs that come with especially dis-
abling illnesses or injuries. Coverage triggers are usually one of the following:
 
✓ Inability to do two or more activities of daily living (like bathing, dress-
ing, eating, going to the bathroom) without help
 
✓ Cognitive impairments (such as head injuries or Alzheimer’s disease)
 
✓ Loss of sight, hearing, speech, or two or more limbs
 
I strongly recommend including this optional benefit in your program, unless 
you have a long-term care policy, which essentially does the same thing. What 
makes this coverage particularly attractive is its relatively low cost.

294
Part V: Managing Life, Health, and Disability Risks 
Own-occupation protection
Own-occupation refers to the length of time you’ll be paid a full benefit when 
you can’t perform your specific occupation but could do another. In a disabil-
ity policy, the period of occupation protection is found in the policy defini-
tion for total disability.
The most restrictive definition is probably the one the Social Security 
Administration uses: complete inability to engage in any gainful occupation. 
The broadest definition is probably found in the expensive, deluxe policies 
offered to high-income professionals such as physicians and lawyers: the 
inability to perform the duties of your specific occupation.
With the Social Security definition in your policy, you may not be eligible 
for benefits if you can sell pencils or wash dishes. With the deluxe definition 
of own-occupation, if you were a radiologist making $300,000 a year with a 
$200,000 a year disability benefit and could no longer practice your specialty 
of radiology but could practice family medicine or teach radiology at the uni-
versity and earn $200,000, you would still be considered totally disabled. If 
Collecting disability benefits from Uncle Sam
Social Security is not just a retirement benefits 
program — it also offers a basic level of disabil-
ity benefits. If you pay into the Social Security 
system, you get an annual statement from them 
that spells out both your estimated retirement 
benefits and your long-term disability benefits.
Social Security disability benefits are payable 
to normal retirement age. There is a five-month 
waiting period after you’re totally disabled 
before benefits are payable to you. To qualify, 
you must have a medical condition that will dis-
able you for at least a year or result in death. 
Benefits are paid for total disability only, mean-
ing that if you can work at all, you don’t qualify.
Because of the severe limitations and the fact 
that the majority of applicants for benefits are 
declined, I recommend that you ignore Social 
Security benefits in your planning. If you happen 
to receive them, that’s great.
To get a current copy of your Social Security 
statement and an estimate of your disability 
benefits, go to www.socialsecurity.

that explains the program in detail, go to www.

If you do file a disability claim, be prepared 
for rather intensive scrutiny of your claim and 
a delay of months before you start receiving 
any benefits if you do qualify. If they turn down 
your claim, don’t give up. I know several people 
who’ve finally been approved after their second 
or third appeal, so it can pay to be persistent.
On the bright side, after two years of collect-
ing Social Security disability benefits, you then 
automatically qualify for the Medicare program, 
regardless of your age. If you fit this descrip-
tion, see Chapter 20 for what you need to know 
about the Medicare program.

 Chapter 22: Managing the Risk of Long-Term Disability
you’re that radiologist, you could take any other job other than your job as a 
radiologist (for example, you could teach at the university) and get your full 
$200,000 benefit, plus your teacher’s salary. As you might guess, this cover-
age is expensive. I don’t think it’s necessary for most people.
Most disability policies use a definition of total disability that falls somewhere 
between the Social Security definition and the definition found in contracts 
that are sold to wealthy professionals. They pay full benefits if you can’t 
perform your particular occupation for anywhere from two to five years, 
sometimes ten years; then, if you’re still disabled after that period, your 
benefits are cut off only if you can’t perform another occupation for which 
you’re reasonably suited based on your education, training, and experience. 
The longer the period of protection for your specific occupation, the higher 
the premium.
 
Make your decision to add an own-occupation clause based on how many 
years you’ve spent mastering your craft. A brain surgeon or a lawyer would 
probably want the broadest definition possible. Someone with two years of 
college employed as a sales representative would probably be satisfied with 
more limited protection on the occupation.
 
Always buy a disability policy that, if for whatever reason you work in another 
occupation that pays less than your original occupation, will still pay a pro-
portionate/residual benefit for as long as that income difference persists. So if 
your original salary was $100,000 per year, and you can now only do a job that 
pays you, say, $50,000 per year (it decreased by 50 percent), you want disabil-
ity protection that will pay you one-half of your policy benefit.
Buying Disability Insurance
You’ve determined how much coverage you need. You’ve chosen the policy 
features that are most important to you. Your adrenaline is on high. You’re 
primed! You’re ready! The big moment you’ve been waiting for is finally here! 
Tell the truth: Is there anything more fun in life than shopping for insurance?
Knowing where to buy
If you already have a trusted insurance agent for your auto, home, or life 
insurance policies, she may be able to help you find the right disability insur-
ance policy. Many — but not all — agents have disability insurance avail-
able. If your current agent does offer disability policies, make sure that she’s 
knowledgeable about disability. If she isn’t, ask for a referral to a disability 
insurance specialist. (For more on finding an agent, turn to Chapter 4.)

296
Part V: Managing Life, Health, and Disability Risks 
 
A small percentage of insurance agents deal principally with disability insur-
ance products, and they’re often quite knowledgeable about the subject. 
Unfortunately, they often tend to concentrate on the professional market (doc-
tors, lawyers, CPAs, and so on). They also tend to deal in a more elite product 
that offers Cadillac coverage at a stiff price. Still, a disability specialist should 
be able to help you find a quality product at a price you can afford, or know 
someone who can.
Here are a few other sources to explore:
 
✓ Your employer: If you can get group coverage through your employer 
for free or at little cost, doing so is often a good idea. The major advan-
tage of employer-based disability coverage is that you can often get the 
insurance even if your health is poor.
 
 Group coverage has some pitfalls, however:
 
• Benefits are taxable.
 
• You don’t get to pick the features you want (like residual or cost of 
living riders).
 
• If you change jobs, you lose the insurance.
 
✓ Association plans: Policies from associations are often attractively 
priced. They usually have many of the same pitfalls as employer-paid 
group insurance, however, and you usually have to qualify medically. 
You also lose it if you drop your association membership or if the plan is 
discontinued.
Evaluating a credit card insurance offer
If you own a credit card (in other words, if you 
live and breathe), you receive offers all the time 
to buy credit insurance that will pay off the card 
balance if you become disabled. Unless you’re 
medically uninsurable, these offers are usually 
a rip-off. Here’s just one example: I had a client 
who was interested in buying disability insur-
ance from a major national credit card com-
pany solicitation. It was a “special program for 
business owners,” the ad proclaimed. He wisely 
ordered a sample policy and sent it to me for an 
opinion. Just how “special” was it? It only had 
a couple of limitations:
 ✓ Disability must be caused by an accident 
only; no coverage was given for heart 
attacks, cancer, or any other illness.
 ✓ After one year of disability payments, the 
coverage ends unless you are (and I quote) 
“unable to perform FOR THE REST OF 
YOUR LIFE any job for which you are or can 
become qualified.” Any job? Selling pencils 
on the street corner?
Such consumer-friendly language gets me 
goose-bumpy all over! Needless to say, he 
passed on the offer.

297
 Chapter 22: Managing the Risk of Long-Term Disability
 
✓ Creditors: Often sold through lending institutions, insurance from credi-
tors is designed to pay off loans (such as payments on a car, boat, home, 
or credit card balance) in the event of long-term disability.
 
 Avoid this type of insurance unless you can’t qualify for coverage any-
where else because of health problems. No inquiries are made as to your 
medical condition when you apply for some of these policies, so the rates 
tend to be two, three, or more times higher than preferred rates for 
healthy individuals. These policies also have the added disadvantage of 
covering only that part of your monthly living expenses that has a loan 
tied to it, and of expiring or running out when the loan is paid off. But, if 
your health is poor, buy all the coverage you can get your hands on.
Comparing policies
Most agents who work with disability insurance have access to more than 
one company. If you’ve taken the time to choose an agent with plenty of 
expertise on disability insurance, ask her to get more than one quote. 
Comparing policy features and optional coverages of two or more disability 
policies is a challenge to the best agents and next to impossible for the con-
sumer. So it’s okay to ask her to go through the policies feature by feature so 
that you understand their differences.
 
If you have an existing or past medical issue that you or your agent are con-
cerned might affect your chances of being approved (such as an old back 
injury or treatment for depression), do what I recommend to my clients: Apply 
simultaneously to two companies. That way you won’t have to answer “yes” to 
the question on every application “Have you ever had an application for life or 
disability insurance declined, rated up, or otherwise modified?” That happens 
more often than you might think.
 
Don’t buy based on the lowest price. Other factors to consider include the 
agent’s expertise, the insurance company’s financial strength and reputation, 
or special coverage features that are really important to you.
Plugging Holes in Your Group 
Insurance Program
The good news about employer-paid group long-term disability insurance is 
that it’s a no-cost benefit to you. The bad news is that every dime you receive 
is taxed as ordinary income. Plus, unlike privately owned disability insurance, 
group benefits are offset against anything you receive from Social Security or 
workers’ compensation. Here are some other shortcomings of group coverage:

298
Part V: Managing Life, Health, and Disability Risks 
 
✓ Coverage stays with the job. You may have a right to convert the policy 
to an individual policy but usually with watered-down coverage and 
higher pricing.
 
✓ Generally group policies don’t have a cost-of-living adjustment, so 
while you’re out on disability, your benefit will never increase.
 
✓ Many policies cover only total disabilities — no partial or residual 
benefits.
Because group benefits are taxable, the 60 percent of salary they usually 
pay ends up being 40 percent to 45 percent after taxes. Unless you can live 
comfortably on that amount, buy an individual disability policy to cover the 
shortfall.
 
A good supplement should include all the features I recommend in this chap-
ter plus, ideally, an option to purchase additional benefits whenever you lose 
your group benefits for whatever reason, regardless of the condition of your 
health.
 
Take time to select a good agent who can help you identify the holes in your 
group plan and how to best plug them, and who is knowledgeable about sup-
plemental policies.
Getting group benefits tax-free
If you have a good group insurance program 
at work paid for by your employer, see if you 
can pay the premiums yourself or reimburse 
the employer for what they paid. Alternatively, 
see if your employer will add the premium for 
the disability insurance to your W-2 as taxable 
income. If you can somehow manage to pay 
taxes on the premiums or pay the premiums 
yourself, when you finally are disabled, you will 
receive the benefits tax-free! Definitely worth 
checking into.

Buying Life Insurance
In This Chapter
▶ Determining how much life insurance you need
▶ Deciding between term and permanent insurance
▶ Buying life insurance smartly
▶ Debunking myths and avoiding mistakes
W
e buy life insurance because we love. We love spouses, children, and 
others who depend on us financially. We love them enough to face 
the cold reality of death. We love them enough to acknowledge the possibil-
ity that we could die young, leaving them without our income. We love them 
enough to plunk down our hard-earned cash for insurance, so that if we do 
die early, our deaths will not burden them financially — house payments will 
be made, groceries will be on the table, and college dreams can be realized.
In this chapter, I give you all the information you need on buying life insur-
ance. I explain the difference between term life insurance and permanent life 
insurance; help you figure out whether you need insurance and, if so, how 
much you need; tell you where to buy it; and dispel some common myths 
about life insurance. With the information in this chapter, you’ll be able 
to rest easy, knowing that your loved ones will be taken care of even after 
you’re gone.
Assessing whether You 
Need Life Insurance
Life insurance isn’t for everyone. If no one would be hurt financially by your 
death, you wouldn’t buy life insurance any more than you’d buy car insur-
ance if you don’t drive and don’t own a car. In this section, I give you specific 
guidelines on who does and who doesn’t need life insurance.

300
Part V: Managing Life, Health, and Disability Risks 
Who doesn’t need life insurance
Two groups of people do not need life insurance:
 
✓ Those who are financially well off enough that their survivors can 
meet all their financial needs and obligations using existing financial 
resources, without the possibility of depleting those resources: For 
example, if you’re married, you have one teenager, and you’ve managed 
to sock away $1 million and have paid off your house, you may not need 
life insurance. Your existing resources can support your child through 
college and also provide your spouse with a cushion.
 
✓ Those whose death won’t cause a hardship to others: For example, if 
you and your spouse have no children, and you each earn a high enough 
income to easily support yourselves if the other one dies, you don’t 
need life insurance. If you’re a single homeowner with a home mort-
gage and no dependents, you have enough in savings to pay for final 
expenses, and you’re okay with the home being taken over by the mort-
gage company if you die, then you don’t need life insurance.
Who does need life insurance
Two groups of people do need life insurance:
 
✓ Those with one or more people who depend on their income: If your 
family depends on your income (whether or not your spouse works) and 
you don’t have enough savings for them to live off of, your family will 
need the financial help that only life insurance offers. You don’t have 
to be married or have kids to need life insurance, though. For example, 
you may be single but paying the bills for your elderly mother’s assisted-
living apartment — if something were to happen to you, life insurance 
Myth: Life insurance is cheaper when you’re young
Life insurance really is cheaper when you’re 
young. So are dentures, but you don’t buy them 
until you need them, either. This myth started 
because the annual cost of life insurance is 
cheaper per year when you’re young because 
your chances of dying are lower. But the total 
cost that you pay over the life of the policy is not 
cheaper! How could it be?
Suppose that you buy life insurance for $100 a 
year at age 25 and your friend waits until age 35 
and has to pay $110 a year for the same cover-
age. Now you’re both 35 and you pay $10 less 
per year — but how about the $1,000 that you 
paid for the ten years that you didn’t need it? 
Plus interest? Don’t buy life insurance until you 
need it.

301
 Chapter 23: Buying Life Insurance
would make sure that she’s taken care of. Even if you’re very well off 
and your family would be able to survive on your savings, if you have a 
favorite charity that relies on your generous annual gifts, life insurance 
can keep those gifts coming indefinitely.
 
✓ Those who provide services that would need to be hired out in the 
event of their death: If you’re a stay-at-home mom, and you die while 
your children are young, your husband will suffer a financial loss. He’ll 
need, at the very least, money to pay for childcare. If he wants some 
sanity, he may want to hire household help as well. Over a ten-year 
span, childcare and occasional help around the house can cost $250,000 
or more. Life insurance can make that outlay possible.
 
 Plus, the surviving spouse may not want to work the same way after 
the death of a stay-at-home spouse. Maybe your husband would want 
to work fewer hours while your children are growing up. If he has the 
money, he can ask his employer for more flexible hours and less pay to 
be the present parent. Life insurance can make that possible.
 
 Maybe you take care of your parents’ home for them — cutting the lawn, 
painting, and doing all the handyman chores. It may cost your parents 
$500 per month to hire a service to do that if you die. The interest on 
$250,000 of life insurance can make sure that those services are pro-
vided to your parents as long as they stay in the house. And when they 
need additional help, the $250,000 from the insurance policy can help 
pay their nursing home costs.
Determining How Much 
Coverage You Need
If you die early, how much money will your loved ones need? How much 
will it take to pay off debt? How much to replace your income? Is providing 
funds to cover college costs for your children important, and if so, how much 
money will that take? How do you account for inflation?
Financial experts typically recommend that you have at least enough life 
insurance and liquid assets to equal a multiple of five times your annual 
income, ignoring inflation, or seven to eight times your income factoring in 
inflation.
 
If you have children, be safe and err on the side of buying too much life insur-
ance. I recommend that you buy enough life insurance to equal ten times 
your annual income, giving your surviving spouse and children a softer life-
style with more time for each other. Why? Because life insurance is cheap — 
especially for young families, when the need for life insurance is greatest.

302
Part V: Managing Life, Health, and Disability Risks 
 
When buying life insurance, aim high. For the people you love who survive 
you, too much is far better than too little.
What if you’re insuring a stay-at-home parent who doesn’t have an income? 
My advice is to buy enough insurance to give the surviving parent the option 
of paying for a full-time, in-home nanny. Check the prices of an in-home 
nanny service, including cooking, cleaning, and so on, plus driving the kids 
wherever they need to go. Then multiply that cost over the number of years 
needed, and round up for inflation.
 
Here’s my quick and dirty tip for insuring homemakers. Buy $500,000 of life 
insurance — $250,000 to replace services and another $250,000 to give the 
surviving spouse and children a less stressful life and some extra time for 
each other.
 
I don’t recommend using retirement money to cover today’s needs, even in a 
situation as dire as the premature death of a spouse. The survivor will still 
need those funds at retirement. I also don’t usually recommend using home 
equity. Why? Because it’s not very liquid, and the surviving spouse will proba-
bly want to keep the house.
Speaking the Language
Before looking at the different types of life insurance and the best places to 
buy them, here are a few definitions of insurance industry jargon:
 
✓ Beneficiary: The beneficiary is the person or organization to whom the 
life insurance proceeds are payable at the death of the person insured. 
It could be a spouse, children, a sibling, or a favorite charity. Every 
life insurance policy covering you — both those you buy and those at 
work — should name two beneficiaries: a primary beneficiary and a 
contingent beneficiary:
 
• A primary beneficiary is the person or organization to whom the life 
insurance proceeds are paid if that beneficiary is alive or in exis-
tence when you die.
 
• A contingent beneficiary is the person or organization to whom the 
life insurance proceeds are paid if the primary beneficiary is dead 
or no longer in existence. If no contingent beneficiary is named, the 
proceeds are paid to the estate of the primary beneficiary and pos-
sibly subject to delays and additional taxes.
 
✓ Owner: The owner of a life insurance policy may or may not be the 
person whose life is insured. The owner is the person or organization 
who controls the policy, pays the bills, chooses the beneficiary, and so 
on. Here are some examples of when the owner would be different from 
the person insured:

303
 Chapter 23: Buying Life Insurance
 
• A corporation owner insuring the life of a key scientist whose 
talents are vital to the company’s survival
 
• A family trust owner insuring an aging parent in order to pay estate 
taxes due at death
 
• A parent insuring the life of a child to cover final expenses
 
✓ Purchase options: Purchase options are options available with some poli-
cies that give the person insured the right to purchase additional cover-
age every few years, regardless of health. Coverage is guaranteed up to 
a certain amount per option. The options usually cease when the person 
is between ages 40 and 50.
 
 For example, a couple, both 24, are engaged to be married and are plan-
ning to buy a home and have children in two to three years. They’re 
both in good health. They don’t want to spend a lot on life insurance 
that they don’t need right now. They would like to guarantee, while 
they’re still healthy, that they can buy coverage later even if their health 
sours. They may buy starter policies for $50,000 of coverage on each 
and add a purchase option that every three years gives them the right 
to buy an additional $50,000 of coverage regardless of their health, their 
hobbies, or their increased size.
 
✓ Waiver of premium: Waiver of premium is an optional coverage that 
suspends your life insurance premium after you’ve been totally disabled 
for (usually) six months, until you’re no longer disabled. It has two dis-
advantages:
 
• It’s more expensive than personal disability coverage.
 
• It won’t normally pay if you can work part-time.
 
 You may not need it if you have plenty of disability coverage and you’ve 
included your life insurance premium in your estimated coverage needs.
Identifying the Types of Life Insurance
After you’ve determined how much coverage you need, you need to decide 
where to buy it and which type of policy is best suited to your needs.
There are really only two types of life insurance — permanent and term — 
although the two types come in many shapes, sizes, and colors. The biggest 
difference between them is how long the coverage lasts:
 
✓ Permanent life insurance covers you for your entire life. Your death 
is certain. And when you die, it pays the death benefit (the amount of 
money payable at the time of death).

304
Part V: Managing Life, Health, and Disability Risks 
 
✓ Term life insurance covers only a part of your lifetime. When that part, 
or term, ends, so does the coverage. It only pays a death benefit if you 
die within the designated term.
In the following sections, I provide a brief comparison of the two types of 
policies, covering their ideal use, pricing, and agent compensation. (I cover 
both types of insurance in much greater detail later in this chapter.)
Permanent life insurance
Permanent life insurance is ideally suited to permanent needs. For example, 
you may buy permanent life insurance when you’re looking to supplement 
retirement dollars for your surviving spouse, covering estate taxes due upon 
your death, or paying final expenses — burial, legal costs, and so on.
Every life insurance policy has two core parts to its price:
 
✓ Mortality cost: This is determined by your odds of dying at that 
moment. The mortality charge increases each year as you age and your 
risk of dying increases.
 
✓ Policy expense cost: This is your share of insurance company expenses 
(rent, staff, and agent commissions). The expense charge stays relatively 
constant.
Most permanent life insurance policies have level premiums for life. How 
is that possible if the mortality charge increases each year? The insurance 
company averages the increasing mortality changes over your remaining 
expected life. In short, you overpay in the early years so that you can under-
pay in the later years. That overpayment in the early years is set aside in a 
reserve for you, called cash value. If you cancel a permanent policy, by law 
you’re entitled to get back much of those overpayments — that cash value. 
The cash value is minimal in the first couple of years because of heavy first-
year costs — underwriting, medical exams, and agent commissions.
Permanent life insurance is considerably more expensive than term life insur-
ance for the first several years, for the same death benefit, because perma-
nent insurance has a cash value element.
Term life insurance
Term life insurance is ideally suited for covering life insurance needs that 
are not permanent. For example, you may buy term life insurance when you 
want to cover a 20-year mortgage, college costs for children, or family income 
needs while the kids are growing up.

305
 Chapter 23: Buying Life Insurance
Term life insurance costs, unlike permanent life insurance costs, increase regu-
larly as you age. Sometimes the increase is annual, and sometimes it’s every 
five or ten years or more. Term insurance costs can be averaged over 10, 20, 
or 30 years, so the price is level for the entire term. But term insurance doesn’t 
have a cash value element — if you drop a term insurance policy in its early 
years, you get no refund of any overpayment (see the preceding section).
Because term insurance has no cash value element, premiums in the first sev-
eral years are considerably lower than permanent insurance premiums for 
the same death benefit.
Looking At Permanent Life Insurance
All permanent policies have three components: mortality costs, expense 
charges, and cash value. (See “Permanent life insurance,” earlier in this chap-
ter, for more information.) Insurers offering permanent insurance compete in 
three ways: lowering mortality costs, lowering expense charges, and having 
better investment yield on the cash value.
Permanent policies vary by
 
✓ Whether they guarantee mortality and expense costs
 
✓ Whether they guarantee the yield on the cash value
Three types of permanent life insurance are on the market: whole life, univer-
sal life, and variable life. Every life insurance company offers hybrids of these 
three. See Table 23-1 for a quick overview of how they compare.

Part V: Managing Life, Health, and Disability Risks 
Whole life
People who choose whole life insurance want a lifetime policy with zero risk. 
They want the insurance company to guarantee, for life, the monthly cost. If 
an epidemic breaks out, significantly killing off a large part of the population 
and raising mortality costs to the insurance company, this policy cost isn’t 
affected at all. Conversely, if science reduces heart disease rates and cures 
cancer, lowering deaths and mortality costs, the insurance company reaps 
more profits because it continues to receive the higher, guaranteed mortality 
charges of the whole life policy.
The same is true for expense costs. If the insurance company’s expenses 
rise because it buys a new building or pays agents higher commissions, it 
can’t pass on those higher costs to the whole life customers. Similarly, if it 
improves efficiency and cuts costs, only the insurance company reaps the 
benefits.
Life insurance dividends
Several life insurance companies that sell per-
manent life insurance policies offer what they 
call dividends to their policyholders.
Unlike dividends paid on common stock hold-
ings, life insurance dividends are essentially 
a refund of premiums paid. Because, in most 
cases, you’ve paid your premiums with after-tax 
dollars, these premium refunds (the dividends) 
are tax-free to you.
How can some insurers pay dividends and 
others not? Because those that do pay dividends 
charge a little more on the front end — your 
premium. Then if they have a good year — 
their investments do well — they refund some 
or all of that overpayment to you in the form of 
a dividend. Note that dividends are not guaran-
teed, although they are very likely. If the insur-
ance company has a worse than expected year, 
it can choose not to pay a dividend at all.
If you choose a permanent policy that pays divi-
dends, you have four choices as to how they 
are paid to you:
 ✓ You can leave them on deposit to earn 
interest.
 ✓ You can have them paid in cash and 
returned to you.
 ✓ You can apply them to reduce your 
premium.
 ✓ You can buy paid-up additions. Paid-up 
additions are small increases in your life 
insurance coverage that are paid up for your 
lifetime. Your premiums don’t increase, but 
when you die, your beneficiary will get your 
original death benefit, such as $100,000, plus 
the total of all paid-up additions paid for by 
the dividends, such as another $1,500 for a 
total of $101,500 paid to your beneficiary.
For most people with increasing life insurance 
needs, using dividends to buy paid-up additions 
is the wisest of the four dividend options. If your 
needs are not increasing, having the dividends 
applied to reduce the premium is probably 
best.

307
 Chapter 23: Buying Life Insurance
Finally, a whole life policy pays a minimal but guaranteed rate of return — 
usually from 2½ percent to 4 percent for life — so guaranteed, in fact, that 
the policy contains a page showing what the cash value will be for each year 
of the future. Today, 4 percent guaranteed looks good. Twenty years ago, 
when interest rates were in the double digits, it looked horrible.
With whole life, the insurance company takes all the risks. You take none. 
The insurance company bites the bullet when things sour and reaps extra 
profits when things improve.
If you buy a whole life policy that offers dividends, you share a little in good 
years and overpay in bad years. See the sidebar “Life insurance dividends” 
for more information.
Universal life
In the 1980s, interest rates were rising to unexpectedly high levels, approach-
ing 20 percent. Inflation was running rampant. Not only were the fixed rates 
of whole life eliminating most new sales, but existing customers were drop-
ping their old policies in droves as, one by one, insurance companies began 
to offer a more flexible policy called universal life insurance, which has flex-
ible rather than fixed interest rates on the cash value. At that time, a 13 per-
cent to 14 percent return was common. Universal life later proved to be both 
good news and bad news for consumers.
The good news is that universal life is a flexible product. Everything that’s 
fixed and guaranteed in a whole life policy is flexible and non-guaranteed. 
The risks of changes in mortality costs, expense costs, and interest rates are 
mostly passed on to you. If costs decrease or interest rates rise, you reap the 
benefit. If costs rise or interest rates plummet, you’re primarily the one who 
takes the hit. The only risk the insurer takes is that the universal life policy 
has a ceiling on how high the mortality charges can go and a guaranteed min-
imum interest rate on the cash value — usually 2½ percent to 4 percent.
What I like about a universal policy is its flexibility — not only its adaptability 
to changing market conditions, but also its flexibility with the death benefit. 
With whole life, if you want to raise your coverage, you have to take out an 
additional policy. With universal life, you can lower the death benefit at any 
time and keep the same policy. You also can raise the benefit anytime, if you 
can prove good health, without having to buy additional policies.
Another thing I like about a universal policy is the ability to vary premium pay-
ments: to lower them or even temporarily suspend them, such as during hard 
times, or to pay in additional amounts when the rate of return is attractive — 
especially considering that the earnings are tax sheltered (free of income tax until 
withdrawal). With universal life, you have the option at any time of dumping 
large additional sums into the cash value account, subject to federal maximums.

308
Part V: Managing Life, Health, and Disability Risks 
Cash value options: When you 
drop permanent insurance
If, for whatever reason, you decide to cancel 
a permanent policy that has accumulated cash 
value, you have three options (called non-for-
feiture values) as to how that cash can be used 
to your benefit:
 ✓ You can receive the cash value in cash. 
Choose the cash option when your need 
for life insurance has ended (the kids are 
grown, the mortgage is paid, and you’ve 
become financially independent).
 ✓ You can receive prepaid permanent insur-
ance for life for a reduced death benefit. 
Choose the reduced, prepaid permanent 
insurance if your life insurance needs have 
diminished (the kids are grown, the mort-
gage is paid, and so on), but you still have 
life insurance needs such as covering final 
expenses.
 ✓ You can receive term insurance for a cer-
tain length of time for the full death benefit. 
Choose the extended term insurance option 
if you still need the full death benefit and 
either can’t afford or don’t want to pay any 
more premiums. Extended term insurance is 
a great option, especially if the need you’re 
trying to cover with the insurance is going 
to end (for example, college costs and living 
expenses for your children) before the term 
insurance runs out.
Some people choose the cash option during 
hard times. If you’re having financial difficulties 
but you still need life insurance, you still have 
a couple options. If you temporarily can’t make 
the premium payments, the cash value can pay 
them until you’re back on your feet. Or if you just 
need cash, you can borrow against the cash 
value via a policy loan at about a 3 percent to 4 
percent net interest rate.
A good way to access your cash value in a per-
manent insurance policy, especially when you 
need cash but want to continue the insurance, 
is to borrow against it with interest. “But it’s 
my money,” you protest. “Why can’t I just pull 
it out? Why would I ever borrow it? And why 
would I have to pay interest for using my own 
money?”
Some permanent policies do allow you to 
access the cash by pulling it out. But in the first 
ten years or so, some surrender charges exist. 
If you’ve had the policy for a number of years, 
pulling out the cash value may cause some tax 
consequences. Borrowing from the funds has 
neither problem. A policy loan also has the psy-
chological advantage of encouraging repay-
ment, which is a good idea if you plan to keep 
the policy for life.
You do have to pay a modest interest charge — 
usually about 8 percent of the loan. But that is 
only done to cover the handling expenses and 
because, while the money is in your hands, the 
insurance company still credits your policy with 
the policy guaranteed interest rate — usually 
4 ½ percent. So the true cost of the loan to you 
is only about 3 percent to 4 percent.
If you do take a policy loan, your death ben-
efit will be reduced by any unpaid balance. 
Whether to borrow your cash value or with-
draw it outright is not an easy decision. Consult 
with your agent for the pros and cons of both 
options before deciding.

 Chapter 23: Buying Life Insurance
 
Be careful not to dump in additional amounts if any penalties for withdrawal 
exist. If there are penalties, usually it’s best not to make the additional deposit.
 
Now the bad news. Universal life has one pitfall to be wary of, especially when 
interest rates are high. The sales illustration you receive estimates the amount 
of annual premium needing to be paid, assuming the current (high) interest 
rate remains constant, to fund the policy for life. When interest rates are high, 
that estimated premium is low because higher interest earnings will defray 
some of the policy costs. But when interest rates drop significantly, as they 
have in recent years, the original estimated premium will be inadequate to 
fund the costs, and you’ll be required to significantly increase your contribu-
tion or cancel the policy. A nasty surprise.
 
If you want to be fairly safe from unexpected premium increases happening to 
you when you buy a universal life policy, choose a premium payment based 
on a very conservative interest rate. I recommend using the minimum guaran-
teed rate (that is, 3 percent). If you do, you should never have to pay higher 
premiums later.
Variable life
When attached to life insurance, the term variable means that you have half a 
dozen or more investment options with your cash value — including invest-
ing in the stock market. The good news with variable policies is that you 
have the potential to outperform what you would have earned under a non-
variable contract. The bad news, as with any stock market risk, is that you 
can lose part of your principal.
 
If you choose a variable policy, understand upfront that if the cash value prin-
cipal declines, you’ll have to make up the loss and pay increased premiums to 
fund the policy properly.
Considering Term Life Insurance
Term life insurance contracts are differentiated based on the length of the 
coverage term, whether they can be renewed, the length of the price guar-
antee, and whether they can be converted to permanent insurance. Here are 
the three most common types of term life insurance.

310
Part V: Managing Life, Health, and Disability Risks 
Annual renewable term
Annual renewable term (ART) is pay-as-you-go life insurance. Each year, you 
pay for your mortality costs for that 12-month period, plus expenses. On 
each 12-month anniversary, you’re a year older, your mortality costs have 
increased slightly, and your premium increases slightly as well.
You can renew ART policies every year simply by paying the premium. The 
ability to renew them could end, per the policy, in as few as ten years, but 
more typically it’s guaranteed renewable until you’re age 70 or even 100. 
Future prices are projected but normally not guaranteed for more than five 
or ten years. Premiums can increase, but most policies have guaranteed max-
imum prices. If your health deteriorates, your future rates won’t be affected, 
and normally you can convert (that is, exchange) the policy to a permanent 
policy anytime, without medical questions being asked.
Fixed-rate level term
Instead of annual price increases, as with annual renewable term (see the 
preceding section), fixed-rate level term policies allow you to lock in pric-
ing for anywhere from 5 to 30 years in 5-year increments. The most common 
options are 10, 20, and 30 years.
The process of setting up new life insurance policies (administering medical 
exams, ordering doctor reports, and so on) is expensive. The insurance com-
pany can spread these expenses over a longer period by selling level term 
A reentry story
Mark’s $500,000, ten-year reentry term policy 
renews this month. Mark, who has exercised 
and eaten healthy all his life, was diagnosed 
with cancer two years ago. Instead of the $2,000 
renewal bill he would have qualified for if he 
were in good health, the renewal offer came in 
at $14,000 a year for the first year and increased 
about $1,000 a year thereafter.
Fortunately, Mark’s policy includes a conver-
sion option. The cost to convert to a permanent 
policy with cash value is only $8,500 a year. I 
say only because $8,500 is far less than $14,000, 
the premiums won’t increase, and the perma-
nent policy builds cash value. Mark pays $8,500 
a year so that his daughter will get a $500,000 
death benefit — given Mark’s illness, that’s a 
bargain. He couldn’t find a new life insurance 
policy anywhere at any price. Even if he lives for 
ten more years, he’ll pay $85,000 in premiums 
and his daughter’s trust will receive $500,000. 
An easy decision!

311
 Chapter 23: Buying Life Insurance
insurance policies because people keep the policies longer than they keep 
annual term policies. As a result, insurers compete harder and offer more 
competitive prices for level term policies than they do for annual renewable 
term policies.
Most level term policies can be converted to permanent policies anytime, 
regardless of health (although some policies limit the conversion period to 
15 years or so). Also, most can be renewed beyond the first term. Where level 
term policies differ most dramatically is how that renewal happens and what 
happens to the price.
 
Never buy term life insurance that doesn’t have an option to convert to per-
manent insurance, regardless of your health. You never know what the future 
may hold, so keep your options open.
Fixed-rate level term policies are divided into two categories:
 
✓ Traditionally renewable level term: At the end of the first term, tradi-
tionally renewable level term policies renew for another period of the 
same length, without requiring you to requalify medically. The price 
changes on the renewal date, based on your age.
 
 For example, let’s say that when you were 30 years old, you bought a 
ten-year traditional level term policy at preferred rates. On the renewal 
date ten years later, you receive a bill offering to renew for another ten 
years, only now at a preferred 40-year-old rate, without having to qualify 
medically.
 
✓ Reentry renewable level term: Reentry level term works exactly like 
traditional level term in all respects except one: The renewal billing at 
the end of the original term is for your new attained age, but at sky-high 
rates that climb higher each year. Only if you’re still healthy and can 
qualify medically (in other words, if you can reenter) can you reapply for 
the lowest preferred rates for another fixed term.
 
 Because insurance companies aren’t obligated to offer the lowest 
rates on renewal, reentry renewable level term policies are the lowest-
priced term policies in the insurance market. The bad news is that their 
renewal price is the highest in the market if you’re no longer in good 
health.
 
 If you decide to buy this type of policy because of its great front-end 
price, give yourself a cushion. Buy it for a term of five to ten years longer 
than you think you’ll need it to protect yourself (somewhat) from pos-
sible sky-high rates. And definitely don’t use the policy for a permanent 
need.

312
Part V: Managing Life, Health, and Disability Risks 
Decreasing term
Decreasing term policies have coverage that reduces annually, but the pre-
mium stays level for the duration — usually 15 to 30 years. Two types of 
decreasing term policies exist:
 
✓ Level decreasing term coverage reduces coverage a flat amount each 
year. For example, a 25-year level decreasing term policy reduces 4 per-
cent a year.
 
✓ Mortgage decreasing term coverage reduces to match a mortgage 
payoff. Like a mortgage, coverage reduces very slowly in the first few 
years and picks up steam in the later years. The rate of reduction is 
tied to the mortgage interest rate and the length of the mortgage. So if 
Life insurance from your mortgage 
company: Why you shouldn’t bite
If you have a home mortgage, you probably 
receive offers in the mail for mortgage decreas-
ing term insurance from the mortgage company. 
Buying the policy is tempting. You die, and the 
mortgage gets paid. The price looks reason-
able, and they can include the insurance pre-
mium with your house payment. What could be 
sweeter?
Buy it. Buy all that you can. But only if your 
health is bad, you’re obese and a chain smoker, 
or you’ve been given six months to live. And only 
if coverage is automatic (no medical questions 
asked). In short, if you can’t qualify for life insur-
ance in the open market, buy all the mortgage 
decreasing term insurance you can get your 
hands on. If you’re healthy, buy your insurance 
elsewhere. Here’s why:
 ✓ Insurance from the mortgage company is 
almost always more expensive — often 
considerably more — than coverage you 
can buy privately.
 ✓ The coverage ends when you sell your home, 
whereas the same coverage purchased 
privately will not end. That’s important, 
especially if your health has soured.
 ✓ The beneficiary is the mortgage company, 
not your family. Never a good idea. Your 
spouse may not want to pay off the mort-
gage with the money. For example, maybe 
she could earn 4 percent in a money market 
account and the mortgage rate is only 5 
percent. Or maybe something unexpected 
has happened and she desperately needs 
the money for something more important.
Be careful if the price from the mortgage com-
pany appears really attractive. A few years ago, 
one of my employees, Mary Jo, brought me an 
offer for mortgage insurance from her mort-
gage company. The rates were amazing and 
she was thinking of buying it. The nice brochure 
gave several examples of dying: car accidents, 
plane crashes, falling off a roof, and so on. The 
brochure lacked only one thing — it failed to 
mention that it was accident coverage only! 
No coverage for death from natural causes — 
which is, even for young people, the cause of 
the vast majority of deaths.

313
 Chapter 23: Buying Life Insurance
you buy a 10-year, 7 percent mortgage decreasing term policy, like the 
mortgage balance, coverage declines much faster than a 30-year, 9 per-
cent mortgage decreasing term policy. The 10-year, 7 percent policy is 
also far less expensive than the 30-year, 9 percent policy.
The good news about either type of decreasing term policy is that the rates 
usually won’t change for the duration of the term you choose. The bad news 
is that your life insurance coverage is reducing at a time when your living 
expenses are rising — not a good idea. The other bad news is that your life 
insurance normally ends when the term ends — the policies aren’t renew-
able. But in all likelihood, your need for life insurance hasn’t ended. And the 
rates for this type of coverage aren’t nearly as good as level reentry term 
rates for the same coverage period.
 
If you’re thinking of buying a decreasing term policy, don’t. Unless decreasing 
term life insurance coverage is court ordered (covering the mortgage of an ex-
spouse and children) or mandatory as part of a loan, buy reentry level term 
instead of decreasing term. You get coverage that doesn’t decrease and a 
much lower cost.
Making Your Choice
 
Clearly, a potpourri of different types of life insurance are out there. How do 
you choose among them? Here are a few pointers:
 
✓ If you have a permanent need, buy permanent life insurance. If you 
need it but can’t afford it, buy cheap reentry level term that’s convert-
ible to permanent, regardless of your health. A permanent need is a 
need that, no matter how old you are today, will require cash for your 
survivors when you die — paying estate taxes, supporting an adult child 
with Down’s syndrome in a group home, continuing to support a favorite 
charity after your death, or providing supplemental lifetime income to a 
surviving spouse.
 
✓ If you have a nonpermanent need, buy term life insurance. Examples 
of nonpermanent needs include covering living expenses while the chil-
dren are growing up, paying off a mortgage, or paying for the children’s 
college education.
 
✓ Buy annual renewal term insurance if your need is pressing for only a 
year or two, but only if the price is less than that of a ten-year reentry 
level term policy.
 
✓ Buy reentry level term if your need is great and your budget is small, 
such as if you’re a parent with young children. However, make sure that 
you’re clear on when the initial level term period ends. If you still need 
life insurance at that time, you may need to convert what you have into 

314
Part V: Managing Life, Health, and Disability Risks 
a much higher-priced permanent policy if you can’t qualify medically for 
reentry. For that reason, I recommend that you buy reentry term insur-
ance for a period of at least five to ten years longer than you think you 
need it. Also, because you want the company to be around when you 
convert, make sure that the quality of the insurance company is high. I 
suggest an A. M. Best rating of A or better. (See Chapter 4 for information 
on rating insurance companies.)
 
 For a small charge, some reentry term products offer a guarantee that, 
at the end of the first level term period, you can renew for another term 
at the low reentry rate regardless of your health. Unless you’re 100 per-
cent sure that you won’t need coverage beyond the first term, buy this 
option if it’s available.
 
✓ Buy only guaranteed renewable and convertible term products. You 
never know what the future may hold.
 
✓ Buy traditional non-reentry level term coverage anytime you find its 
pricing reasonably close to reentry term costs, or if you’re willing to 
pay extra for the peace of mind of keeping preferred rates for another 
term without ever having to requalify.
 
✓ Unless the price is significantly lower, always buy privately owned 
term life insurance rather than the optional group life insurance 
through employers, associations, or creditors and banks. Coverage 
from the latter sources can end (such as coverage from your employer 
ending when you leave your job).
 
✓ Be very wary about buying decreasing term life insurance. Prices usu-
ally aren’t that competitive, and coverage is normally not renewable. 
Plus, people’s coverage needs rarely decrease.
Evaluating Life Insurance Sources
As you get inundated with life insurance solicitations, do you ever feel that 
the first thing astronauts will encounter when landing on Mars will be a coin-
operated machine selling accidental space-death insurance? There’s certainly 
no shortage of places to buy life insurance out there.
After you’ve determined how much coverage you need and the type of 
policy — term or permanent — that best suits your needs, you can search 
out the best place to buy what you need.

315
 Chapter 23: Buying Life Insurance
Buying with an agent
Permanent insurance is available almost exclusively from insurance agents. 
I recommend that you buy permanent insurance only from a top agent. Keep 
in mind that permanent insurance, due to its complexity and cash value ele-
ment, requires added expertise in choosing among different products.
Buying term insurance is a completely different issue. Unlike almost any 
other kind of insurance, term insurance is close to a commodity. Term poli-
cies are the least complex policies you can buy. The policy boils down to 
one sentence: “If you die, we pay.” Because, unlike most other policies, there 
aren’t a lot of hidden exclusions, limitations, and other dangers, buying it 
direct, without an agent, is less risky than buying any other policy direct.
 
Still, using an agent doesn’t cost that much more (if anything). I recommend 
using one, but separate the wheat from the chaff and pick only a skilled agent. 
Hiring the best won’t cost you a dime more, because all agents get paid about 
the same amount, determined by the premium you pay. (See Chapter 4 for tips 
on choosing an expert.)
A good agent can help you determine the right amount of coverage, deter-
mine the best type of term insurance product to use, set up the policy owner 
and beneficiary properly, and be an advocate for you if you’re having prob-
lems with the insurance company. A top agent can also help you choose a 
financially solid company that will endure. And finally, if your application is 
rejected due to health, weight, or other problems, a good agent can help you 
search for a company that will insure you.
Life insurance is available from career life insurance agents whose primary 
occupation is the sale of life insurance, from the agent who helps you with 
your auto and homeowner’s insurance, and from many financial planners.
Career life insurance agents
The principal advantage of career life insurance agents is that life insurance 
is their specialty. They tend to have a higher level of expertise, especially if 
they have more than five years in the business. Life insurance agents who 
have taken advanced classes and earned professional designations, such as 
the Certified Life Underwriter (CLU), are especially good bets.
 
Be careful of inexperienced agents, especially if you have complex needs. Many 
don’t last. The washout rate for life insurance agents is one of the highest of 
any profession — close to 90 percent in the first two years! As you can guess, 
most new agents also have less expertise than experienced agents. (In many 
states, a person can legally sell life insurance with just a week of schooling!)

316
Part V: Managing Life, Health, and Disability Risks 
 
If you do work with a new agent and you have any concerns about what’s 
being recommended to you, get a second opinion. If you decide to work with 
an agent, you may get a lot of pressure to buy permanent life insurance when 
you’re asking for term life insurance. The dramatically higher commission that 
agents earn by selling permanent insurance compared to term insurance may 
be the reason. If the agent who’s “helping” you insists that permanent insur-
ance is your best option when your need isn’t permanent, walking away from 
that agent may be your only option. Of course, some real pros, who care about 
your welfare, may also believe that permanent insurance is the only way to go. 
After all, permanent insurance is always going to be there for you and your 
loved ones, as long as you pay the premiums.
Multiple policy agents
Many agents who sell auto and home insurance also have life insurance 
licenses. But less than half know much about life insurance or even actively 
sell it. And probably only 20 percent are quite knowledgeable about the 
subject.
If you like your current auto and homeowner’s agent’s skills in those areas, 
but he isn’t an expert on life insurance, ask for a referral to a life insurance 
specialist. If your agent is good at his specialty, chances are excellent that 
the agent he refers you to will also be good.
If your current agent is skilled with life insurance, working with him in that 
area, too, is to your advantage. Having one agent for everything simplifies 
your life. And the washout rate on these multiple policy agents is very small.
Financial planners
Two types of people licensed to sell life insurance fit the broad financial plan-
ner category:
 
✓ Money managers who primarily dispense investment advice but also are 
licensed to sell life insurance
 
✓ Career life agents who also offer investments
The primary difference between the two is that the former more often recom-
mend buying term life insurance with your investments separate, whereas 
the latter often recommend permanent life insurance with its cash value as a 
part of your investment portfolio.
 
If you’re considering buying life insurance from a financial planner, a pretty 
safe bet is that those who recommend term insurance for your nonpermanent 
needs are the better choice. Permanent insurance is not considered a good 
investment product.

317
 Chapter 23: Buying Life Insurance
Buy permanent insurance if it’s the best insurance for your needs, but don’t 
buy it solely as an investment, for three reasons:
 
✓ Permanent life is non-portable. If something better comes along, it’s 
hard to move without penalty.
 
✓ The mortality charges are usually higher than those for term insur-
ance. To get a true reflection of the rate of return on the cash value of 
a permanent policy, you need to deduct the hidden costs of those extra 
mortality and expense charges. How? By shopping for the lowest term 
life policy, requesting that the agent disclose those same charges in the 
permanent policy, and then subtracting the difference between the two 
results from the cash value gain.
 
✓ Permanent life insurance has a heavy front-end cost due to the 
high sales commission, which significantly affects the cash value 
performances.
 
I’m not in the least advising you not to buy permanent life insurance. I’m just 
suggesting that you not buy it as an investment.
Buying without an agent
 
If you’re considering buying term life insurance direct from a toll-free number 
or on the job, first check with your favorite agent to see if she can match the 
price. She probably can — in which case, use an agent. If your agent can’t 
match the quote or come close, consider paying the agent a fee (perhaps 
$200) to review your plans and make sure that you’re not shooting yourself in 
the foot.
All the following sources of term life insurance allow you to buy without an 
agent:
 
✓ The Internet: Several sites are set up to comparison-shop term life 
insurance, but I don’t recommend buying any insurance this way unless 
you yourself are an expert. (See Chapter 4 on buying insurance right.)
 
✓ Creditors: Banks, mortgage companies, and credit card companies 
regularly solicit their customers to buy credit life insurance from them 
to pay off any balance if the customer dies. Look at what they get! If you 
buy the insurance from your mortgage company, for example, it makes 
a nice upfront commission on the sale, and later, if you die, it gets paid 
your outstanding balance. What a good deal (for them)!

318
Part V: Managing Life, Health, and Disability Risks 
 
 But how good is the deal for you? Not very. Life insurance rates from 
creditors are usually much higher than on the open market. And the 
creditor — not your survivors — is the beneficiary. Unless your health 
makes you uninsurable through traditional life insurance sources, avoid 
buying insurance from your creditors.
 
✓ Associations: Many groups and associations offer term life insurance 
as a membership benefit. Sometimes the price is fantastic. Most of the 
time, the price is mediocre. The problem is that if you leave the associa-
tion or the association quits offering the coverage, you lose your life 
insurance.
 
 As a general rule, don’t buy life insurance from an association. However, 
do buy as much as you can if you’re uninsurable and the insurer asks no 
medical questions.
 
✓ Group life: Take all the free life insurance your employer offers you. If 
and only if your health is poor and you can’t qualify for other types of 
life insurance, buy all the supplemental life insurance your employer 
offers on a nonmedical basis. (Sometimes that can be $50,000 or more.) 
If you’re healthy, don’t buy any more than the free coverage paid for by 
your employer through work. Buy it privately. Why? Two reasons: You 
lose group insurance when you leave the job, and the rates are almost 
always higher than on the open market if you’re in good health.
 
✓ Direct mail and telemarketing phone solicitations: Again, unless they 
offer guaranteed coverage and you’re otherwise uninsurable, stay away 
from direct mail and toll-free number sources. Most have a fly-by-night 
feel. Plus, they rarely offer prices that can compete with those you can 
get in the market if you’re healthy.
 
✓ Slot machines: I’m referring to those coin-operated flight insurance dis-
pensers at airports and similar dispensers of “fear insurance.” Unless 
you know ahead of time that the plane is going down, don’t buy this 
stuff. (Better yet, don’t take the flight!) But do listen to your fear. It’s 
telling you that you feel inadequately insured. Act on that fear and raise 
your life insurance coverage to a high enough level that you can com-
fortably walk by these machines (with a smile) the next time you fly.
Avoiding Common Life 
Insurance Mistakes
People make all kinds of mistakes when they buy life insurance. In this sec-
tion, I fill you in on the most common ones so that you can avoid falling into 
any traps.

319
 Chapter 23: Buying Life Insurance
Trading cash value for death 
protection needs
Being under-insured with permanent life insurance may be the biggest single 
mistake that people make in buying life insurance. They get swayed by the 
lure of the investment portion or cash value of the policy but can’t afford to 
have their cake and eat it, too. In other words, they can’t afford to pay for 
all the death protection they need plus the investment, so they buy a cash 
value policy with less death protection than they need in order to have some 
investment — something to show for it in the end when they don’t (unlike the 
rest of us) die. However, when they do die, their family doesn’t have enough 
money to live on, creating a serious financial problem.
 
The most important thing about life insurance is the protection it offers. So 
first things first. Determine how much life insurance you need by using a cred-
ible method. Then buy as much of that protection as you can afford, using 
term insurance, even lower-cost reentry products if necessary. If your budget 
has something left over, only then is it okay to look at permanent life products 
for part of your coverage. Never trade critical protection for less-important 
investment opportunities.
Buying your life insurance in pieces
Buying your life insurance in pieces is a lot more expensive than covering 
all your needs in one policy. Plus, buying in pieces leaves you vulnerable to 
a gap in your coverage. Examples of piecemeal buying are having mortgage 
insurance through your lending institution, credit card insurance through 
your credit card company, credit life insurance with your car loan, supple-
mental group life insurance at work, flight insurance at the airport, and so 
on. With some of these insurances, you don’t have to qualify medically; 
therefore, if you’re in poor health or near death, buy all you can. Otherwise, 
they’re often three or four times the price of what you would pay if you’re in 
good health.
 
When buying life insurance, figure out how much insurance you need to do 
the whole job and buy one policy. It’s smarter — and cheaper! Only one policy 
fee instead of several. Plus you have the advantage of a trusted professional 
agent to help with determining how much coverage you need, the type of 
policy, the proper listing of beneficiaries, and so on.

320
Part V: Managing Life, Health, and Disability Risks 
Buying accidental death/travel 
accident coverage
Both accidental death and travel accident policies are varieties of Las Vegas 
insurance, transferring only the accidental portion of your risk. In other 
words, you have no coverage for death from natural causes. Buying these 
policies is an especially bad move if you buy them in lieu of the full life insur-
ance you really need. My belief about travel accident coverage is that anyone 
who buys it at the airport or from a travel agent is really saying, “I’m not com-
fortable with the amount of life insurance I have.” The bottom line is that if 
you need insurance to cover a flight you’re taking, you also need it for driving 
down the street, potential heart attacks, and the like.
 
When buying life insurance, buy only coverage that pays for any death — 
natural or accidental.
Covering the children in lieu of the parents
When your child is born, you try to be a responsible parent. You’re deluged 
with a lot of solicitations about life insurance because of the birth announce-
ment in the newspaper. You have hopes and dreams for your children, so you 
buy a nice cash value policy on your baby. It’s understandable — you’re so 
proud. But the economic effect on the family of a child’s death is minimal com-
pared to the major impact that one of the baby’s parents dying would have.
 
When a child is born, seriously reevaluate and raise the amount of life insur-
ance coverage that you and your spouse have.
Being unrealistic about how much you 
can afford to pay for life insurance
In the 25-plus years that I’ve been an agent, I can’t tell you how many times 
I’ve seen young people commit more money than they can actually afford to 
a large cash value life insurance policy and then two or three years later have 
to drop it and take a large financial loss — and perhaps even be exposed to 
the risk of a death without insurance. I recommend term insurance for young 
families. It provides the most coverage for the money spent. If you want a 
permanent policy later with more bells and whistles, you can always convert 
your term policy.

Ten Ingredients for a Watertight 
Insurance Program
In This Chapter
▶ Avoiding inconsistencies in life and health insurance
▶ Plugging gaps in property and liability insurance
▶ Selecting the best agent and insurance company
I
’ve looked at the insurance programs of over 2,000 people, and almost 
every one of them had at least one major gap in coverage — and most had 
five to ten coverage gaps. Here’s the good news: Virtually all these gaps can 
be plugged for a minimal amount of money! In this chapter, I offer ten gen-
eral tips that can go a long way toward helping you avoid major gaps in your 
insurance program.
Selecting the Best Insurance Agent
A good agent is the main ingredient in a watertight insurance program. In 
fact, if you hire an expert who is skilled in every area of personal insurance, 
you’ll barely have to worry about the other nine ingredients for a watertight 
program.
An agent, expert in all types of insurance, is a great bargain in at least five 
significant ways:
 
✓ She has the expertise and tools to help you choose adequate coverage 
limits in each major loss area.
 
✓ She helps you keep your coverage in those major loss areas balanced 
and helps you avoid inconsistent coverage.

324
Part VI: The Part of Tens 
 
✓ She takes the time to probe into your life deeply enough to identify 
those risks that your current insurance policies exclude. She then 
applies her expertise to help you properly plug your policies with the 
supplemental coverages you need to fill those gaps. A really great agent 
also helps you change your coverages as the risks in your life change.
 
✓ When you have a claim, she does more than just file a report for you. 
She applies her coverage expertise to coach you on how to properly 
document your claim so you get paid all that you’re owed with the least 
amount of delay or hassle.
 
✓ If your claim is unjustly denied or underpaid, she cares enough (and 
has enough coverage expertise) to get the claims department to 
reverse its position and pay you everything you rightfully deserve.
 
If your agent isn’t as good as the agent I just described, you can and must do 
better. The consequences of having the wrong agent can be severe! Getting 
more talent generally doesn’t cost you a dime. In most states, every insurance 
agent — from the very best to the very worst — gets paid the same commis-
sion. So spend your money wisely!
See Chapter 4 for more information on finding a top agent.
Covering All Your Natural 
Disaster Exposures
Floods. Earthquakes. Mudslides. Tornadoes. Hurricanes. In Minnesota, we 
worry about tornadoes and floods, but few of us lose sleep over a possible 
earthquake. Californians worry about wildfires, earthquakes, and mudslides. 
Floridians sweat bullets about hurricanes. Paying attention to these weather 
risks is an important ingredient in a great insurance program. They have the 
potential to destroy your home and they’re often excluded from homeown-
er’s insurance coverage.
 
If you live in an area where you’re exposed to a weather-related risk and you 
haven’t addressed the issue in your insurance, your insurance program has a 
serious leak.
You can find more information about insuring these natural disasters in 
Chapters 9 and 11.

 Chapter 24: Ten Ingredients for a Watertight Insurance Program
Adding a Home Replacement Guarantee
One of the major losses you want to have well insured is the destruction of 
your home. The big risk when you buy homeowner’s insurance is not buying 
enough structure coverage to rebuild your home if it’s destroyed. You and 
your agent, in good faith, try to establish the replacement value of your 
home, but pinpointing that value is difficult at best — especially if your home 
is older. And you certainly don’t want to grossly over-insure your home and 
pay too much for your insurance. So, what’s the solution?
The insurance industry offers a good solution for this dilemma. It’s called the 
extended replacement cost guarantee (or something similar to that, depend-
ing on the company). If your home is destroyed, this optional coverage 
guarantees that the policy will pay the entire cost to rebuild, even if the cost 
exceeds the amount for which the home was insured. The typical cost for 
this great coverage is only $10 to $50 a year — and, believe me, you can’t 
afford not to buy it!
 
The coverage usually has a cap of 125 percent of your coverage limit, but 
some insurance companies still offer a guarantee with no cap. If your insurer 
offers that, grab it!
 
If you have an older home, avoid insurance companies that don’t offer the 
extended replacement cost guarantee. Many insurance companies willingly 
make the guarantee available to owners of older homes, so you shouldn’t have 
trouble finding a company that gives you what you need.
See Chapter 9 for the three conditions you must meet to qualify for the 
extended replacement cost guarantee.
Standardizing Your Liability Limits
 
When you buy automobile, homeowner’s, boat, snowmobile, or any other 
liability policy, always buy the same liability insurance limit. No exceptions.
People make this mistake a lot, especially when they have their insurance 
coverage split between different agents and/or insurance companies. You 
can reduce the chances of this happening by having as much of your liability 
insurance as possible with the same agent.

326
Part VI: The Part of Tens 
Whenever you cause an injury or property damage, you want the same 
amount of money available to you for legal costs and judgments, no matter 
what the cause of the accident. In the same way that you wouldn’t buy 
more liability insurance for claims that occur on Monday, Tuesday, and 
Wednesday than you would for claims that occur the rest of the week, it 
doesn’t make sense to buy different liability limits for different policies.
 
If you have an umbrella policy, make sure that all the underlying liability insur-
ance limits meet the minimum requirements of the umbrella policy. If they 
don’t, you’ll owe the difference.
Identifying and Plugging Liability Gaps
Plugging liability gaps is an area where having a highly skilled agent pays big 
dividends. You want an agent who can identify risks you’re exposed to that 
basic auto, home, and other personal policies don’t cover — an agent who, 
for example, knows that the following lawsuits are not automatically covered 
but knows how to get them covered (usually very inexpensively):
 
✓ When making a delivery to your home office, a delivery person slips and 
falls on your icy sidewalk and is injured (see Chapter 11).
 
✓ The roofer you hire injures his back falling off a ladder and sues you for 
workers’ compensation benefits (see Chapter 11).
 
✓ You injure a co-worker when you drive the company car through a stop 
sign (see Chapter 6).
 
✓ A guest of yours is injured while vacationing with you at your timeshare 
condominium (see Chapter 12).
 
✓ A person is injured in the boat you rented while on vacation (see 
Chapter 16).
For more information and tips on plugging liability insurance gaps, see Parts 
II, III, and IV of this book.
Choosing the Right Umbrella Policy
 
If you do buy an umbrella policy (and I strongly recommend that you do), 
don’t just automatically buy the policy that comes from the insurance com-
pany that provides your personal auto and homeowner’s insurance. All 
umbrella policies are not created equal. For about the same money as a poor 
policy, you can get a top-of-the-line policy that covers most of the unique lia-
bility risks in your life.

327
 Chapter 24: Ten Ingredients for a Watertight Insurance Program
Here are just a few examples of risks that would be covered by a good 
umbrella and would not be covered by a poor one:
 
✓ Renting a car outside the United States and Canada
 
✓ Renting a barn for a 50th birthday party
 
✓ Serving on the board of directors for your favorite charity
 
✓ Renting a boat on vacation
 
A top agent with expertise in the differences between umbrella policies can 
play a significant role in helping you buy the umbrella policy that best covers 
the unique liability exposures in your life. See Chapter 15 for general informa-
tion on umbrella policies and Chapter 16 for tips on identifying those liability 
risks in your life that are not covered by your auto or homeowner’s policies 
that can be covered by an umbrella policy.
Buying More Life Insurance 
than You Think You Need
This recommendation has two parts. The first is to buy life insurance. The 
second is to buy more than you think you’ll need — in other words, more 
than you think your survivors will need. How much more? A lot — 25 percent 
to 50 percent more than you think your survivors will need, especially if you 
have a young family and/or if you’re buying low-cost term life insurance. (It’s 
cheap stuff — you can afford to be extra generous.)
For tips on how to determine how much life insurance you need, the best type 
of policy to meet your needs, and the best place to buy it, see Chapter 23.
Protecting Yourself from 
Long-Term Disability
By far, the most overlooked and undersold major-loss coverage is long-term 
disability insurance. Almost everyone has some life insurance, but only a 
small percentage of people have long-term disability insurance (unless it’s 
provided by their employer). This is the case in spite of the fact that the 
odds of having a long-term disability are considerably greater than the odds 
of dying before the age of 65, and in spite of the fact that a family’s living 
expenses during a disability are considerably higher than those following 
a death.

328
Part VI: The Part of Tens 
 
Unless you’re one of the few people who have enough outside income to meet 
all your living expenses in the event of an illness or injury that would prevent 
you from working, buy long-term disability insurance. And don’t necessarily 
rely on group disability insurance from your employer — it may be good, or it 
may not be.
For help in determining your need for disability insurance, turn to Chapter 22.
Having Major Medical Insurance 
with a High Lifetime Limit
Buy medical insurance with a limit of at least $3 million to $5 million. And if it 
contains copayment requirements, make sure that there’s an annual out-of-
pocket maximum on the copayments.
 
For a watertight insurance program, if you don’t have health insurance sup-
plied by your employer, you need to buy it yourself.
If you’re age 65 or over, don’t rely exclusively on Medicare. Buy a quality 
Medicare supplement policy.
For tips on what makes a great major medical health insurance policy and/or 
a great Medicare supplement policy, see Chapters 18, 19, and 20.
Choosing a Strong Insurance Company
If you’re working with a top insurance agent, you won’t need to spend a lot 
of time checking out the insurance company or companies he recommends. 
But if you’re buying insurance direct (without an agent), if you have low con-
fidence in your current agent, or if you simply want to be extra careful, check 
out insurance company ratings at www.ambest.com/ratings. A. M. Best is 
an independent organization that has been rating insurance companies for 
over 100 years; it has an excellent reputation. Stay with insurance companies 
rated A or better.

Ten Government Programs 
You Should Know About
In This Chapter
▶ Understanding how your bank deposits are protected
▶ Getting and keeping good health insurance when you have chronic health problems
▶ Discovering how state guaranty funds protect you if your insurance company folds
O
ne of the functions of government is to address citizens’ needs that are 
not being met by the private, for-profit sector. Nowhere is this more 
evident than the insurance industry. Insurers as a whole do a pretty good job 
of meeting the needs of most people with car, home, life, disability, health, 
and long-term-care insurance. But insurers seeking and entitled to a small 
profit don’t have the means to provide insurance to people who either can’t 
afford insurance or who can’t qualify.
In this chapter, I introduce you to ten U.S. government and state government 
programs, along with tips on where you can get more information on them.
The FDIC: Insurance on 
Your Bank Deposits
The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) protects against loss of 
deposits in any FDIC-insured bank or savings association — in other words, if 
you have money in a bank and that bank goes under, you’re protected.
The insurance covers both regular and IRA funds in checking, savings, CDs 
and money-market accounts. The FDIC does not cover other financial prod-
ucts (like stocks, bonds, mutual funds, or insurance annuities). The FDIC 
insures accounts up to $250,000 per owner; $500,000 for joint accounts.

330
Part VI: The Part of Tens 
 
Rules on insurance limits are always subject to change, so if you have any 
doubt at all about which of your accounts are covered and for how much, go 
to www.myfdicinsurance.gov where you can find a nifty little tool, called 
EDIE, to estimate whether your bank funds are protected fully. For more infor-
mation, go to www.fdic.gov or call 877-275-3342.
Since the FDIC was founded in 1933, no one has lost a single penny due to 
bank failures or other causes. Plus, the turnaround time for getting your 
money is only a day or two!
Insurance on Insurance: 
State Guaranty Funds
Most states have a guaranty fund to protect you if an insurance company 
fails and you lose your insurance coverage at the time of a claim. In order to 
pay claims after an insurer is declared insolvent, the fund assesses the other 
insurance companies doing business in the state. In other words, the other 
insurance companies have to pay to cover the claims of the company that 
failed.
To find out more about your particular state’s guaranty fund, go to www.
ncigf.org/public-guarantyfunds.asp and look up your state’s contact 
information. Most states have two guaranty funds — one for property-
casualty companies and the other for life and health companies.
 
Although guaranty funds are important, your best bet is to never need one in 
the first place. Always work with a good insurance agent who can pick quality 
companies for you. Check the financial rating of any insurance company 
you’re considering doing business with by going to www.ambest.com. A. M. 
Best Company has been rating insurance companies for over 100 years. 
Whenever possible, choose a company that has received A. M. Best’s highest 
ratings: A, A+, or A++. (For suggestions on choosing an agent or insurance 
company, see Chapter 4.)
COBRA: For When You Lose Your 
Group Medical Insurance
There are many reasons why you may be losing your group medical insur-
ance coverage: You or your spouse may be quitting your job, you or your 
spouse may be retiring, you may be divorcing your spouse under whose 
insurance you were covered.

331
 Chapter 25: Ten Government Programs You Should Know About
Regardless of the reason that you’re losing your group medical insurance, 
employers with 20 or more employees are required by federal COBRA law 
to offer you the right to continue the group coverage at your expense for up 
to 18 months (29 months if you’re disabled, 36 months if you’re retiring or if 
you’re a child forced to come off a parent’s policy).
 
COBRA stands for the Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act 
of 1985.
For tips on whether to elect COBRA and the deadlines by which you need to 
make the decision, turn to Chapter 19.
Some states have extended COBRA rights to employees of companies with 
fewer than 20 employees. Contact your state insurance department to find 
out specifically how COBRA applies in your state.
HIPAA: For When COBRA Ends
The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) was created 
to give people who are losing their group coverage and who have preexisting 
medical conditions the right to continued health coverage without preexist-
ing-condition exclusions applying to their replacement policy. The intent of 
the law is to prevent “job lock,” where an employee is stuck in a dead-end job 
in order to keep the health coverage, because he or a family member has a 
preexisting medical condition (defined by HIPAA as any condition treated by 
doctors or medication in the last six months). HIPAA makes it possible for an 
employee leave a job and take a new job with group medical coverage, with 
the assurance that the health issues of everyone in the family are immedi-
ately covered under the new group policy. HIPAA also makes it possible for 
an individual to leave the group policy and buy a private policy without pre-
existing-condition limitations or having to qualify medically, providing that 
your COBRA option, if any, has been exercised and the time frame exhausted 
(in other words, you’ve stuck with COBRA as long as it was available to you).
The federal government has left it up to each state to determine exactly what 
type of individual health product is made available. The only condition is that 
there can be no preexisting condition waiting period or exclusion — preexist-
ing conditions have to be covered immediately, provided that everyone being 
covered has had consecutive coverage for the past 12 months with no lapse 
in coverage of more than 63 days.
For more in-depth information on how HIPAA works for you, see Chapter 19. 
To find out the specific HIPAA options in your state, contact your state insur-
ance department.

Part VI: The Part of Tens 
Social Security Long-Term Disability
When you think Social Security, you probably think retirement program. You 
may think survivor benefits for children. But few people realize that Social 
Security also includes disability benefits that start after 5 months of total 
disability if that disability is expected to last 12 months or more or result in 
death. Benefits are payable to your normal retirement age.
If you’ve been paying into the Social Security system, every year you get a 
statement of estimated benefits. That statement includes your estimated 
retirement benefits, as well as your estimated long-term disability benefits.
 
Don’t rely strictly on Social Security to meet your need for income replace-
ment following a disability. In fact, I generally recommend that you ignore 
Social Security so that, if you do qualify for benefits, they’ll be a little extra 
cushion for you.
For more information on the program and how to qualify, go to www.ssa.
gov. For more information on managing your long-term disability risks, turn 
to Chapter 22.
State Health Insurance Pools
Whenever you apply for an individual health policy, there are four possible 
outcomes:
 
✓ Your application is approved.
 
✓ Your application is denied.
 
✓ Your application is approved at higher rates because of preexisting con-
ditions (such as diabetes).
 
✓ Your application is approved, but an exclusionary rider is attached to 
the policy excluding coverage for a preexisting condition (such as a bad 
back, bad knees, and so on).
Many states have created health insurance pools that ensure people with 
preexisting health conditions who can’t get health insurance or can’t get it 
without surcharged pricing or exclusionary riders.
If you or a family member is facing that predicament, check with your state 
insurance department to see if your state has such a pool. Or go online to the 
National Association of State Health Insurance Plans at www.naschip.org.

 Chapter 25: Ten Government Programs You Should Know About
National Flood Insurance
Homeowner’s policies have always excluded coverage for any kind of ground 
or below-ground water entering the house. So, the national flood insurance 
program was created years ago to address this risk.
Most people think that flood insurance is only needed if you live near a 
river or other body of water. But, according to the Federal Emergency 
Management Authority (FEMA), which oversees the national flood insurance 
program, about one-third of all flood losses occur to homes nowhere near 
any body of water. Why? Because flooding from torrential rains can over-
whelm an area with water. Few people realize that the flood policy covers 
that type of loss (in addition to loss from flooded rivers or other bodies 
of water). If your home is not in a high-risk flood area, you can buy a flood 
policy for a little more than $100 a year.
For more on the national flood insurance program, as well as my sugges-
tions for managing ground water risks, turn to Chapter 11. To find out 
whether your home is in a low-, moderate-, or high-risk flood area, go to www.
floodsmart.gov and enter your address. You can also find out what your 
approximate flood insurance premium will cost for different levels of cover-
age. You must buy the coverage from an insurance agent — ideally your hom-
eowner’s agent.
 
The flood policy does not cover any personal property, carpeting, finished 
walls, and so on in any part of your home where the floor is below ground 
level unless one of the four outside walls has a floor at least partially at or 
above ground level (as in a walkout basement). Also, don’t wait to buy a policy 
until sandbags are being filled — there’s a 30-day waiting period for new poli-
cies before coverage starts.
Medicaid
Backed by the federal government and administered by the states, Medicaid 
is a health insurance program that provides medical assistance to those in 
need — people at or near poverty levels. Medicaid also provides long-term 
care for those with little or no assets. It is of particular interest to middle-
class Americans who need long-term care but don’t have insurance cover-
age for that. In that case, they end up spending down all their assets to near 
poverty levels, at which point Medicaid will pick up the costs of any ongoing 
care for the rest of their lives. The tragedy is that, by spending down all your 
assets, little (if anything) is left for your surviving spouse or children.

can shelter assets from Medicaid eligibility under the new partnership pro-
gram with Medicaid. For more on Medicaid eligibility, go to www.cms.hhs.
gov/home/medicaid.asp.
Medicare
Otherwise known as national health insurance for seniors, Medicare provides 
a base level of hospital and medical benefits. In 2003, optional prescrip-
tion drug coverage (known as Part D) was added. Medicare is funded by a 
combination of premium payments from seniors and payroll taxes from non-
seniors. In addition to the three parts of Medicare — Part A (hospital), Part 
B (medical), and Part D (drugs) — most seniors will want a good Medicare 
supplement policy to pay most of what Medicare doesn’t cover or disallow. 
Find out more about Medicare and my specific bottom-line advice for seniors 
in Chapter 20. For more information on Medicare, go to www.medicare.
gov. For more on Part D, check out Medicare Prescription Drug Coverage For 
Dummies, by Patricia Barry (Wiley).
Hurricane Windstorm Pools
There has been a dramatic increase in recent years in coastal hurricanes — 
both in terms of the frequency with which they occur and in terms of the 
financial devastation they cause. This has led to the insurance industry no 
longer insuring homes located in the east and southern coastal areas.
 
In order for insurance to work, enough homes have to not be damaged, and 
those homeowners’ insurance premiums pay the claims of those homes that 
are damaged. This just isn’t true with hurricanes — hence, the insurance com-
panies’ unwillingness to insure homes against hurricane damage.
So, the affected coastal states worked with insurers to allow them to still 
insure coastal homes while excluding storm losses. Each state created its 
own storm insurance pool where coastal property owners can buy storm 
insurance. Then when hurricanes hit, the pool pays the losses. If losses 
exceed the funds available, the pool is empowered to assess insurers writing 
property insurance in that state for the shortfall. The agent who sets up your 
homeowner’s insurance can help you with this insurance as well.

Ten Ways to Save Big Bucks 
on Car Insurance
In This Chapter
▶ Discovering how the vehicle you drive affects the rates you pay
▶ Understanding the impact of traffic tickets
B
ecause car accidents happen so frequently and cost so much — both in 
injuries and property damage — the cost of car insurance is often one 
of the biggest insurance items in your budget. In this chapter, I offer ten tips 
to help keep those costs to a minimum without sacrificing coverage.
Take the Bus or Ride Your Bike to Work
If you drive more than 3 miles to work right now, you’ll probably save 20 per-
cent off your car insurance bill if you quit commuting to and from work.
If taking the bus or riding a bike aren’t practical where you live, consider car-
pooling. Many insurance companies offer good discounts on car insurance if 
you carpool.
 
If you’re the driver of the carpool, be careful. It’s okay for your passengers to 
chip in on your gasoline and other expenses, but don’t charge for the ride or 
your car insurance may be null and void.
Buy Cars Favored by 
Crash-Test Dummies
Every year, the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety conducts crash tests of 
new cars. There is a strong correlation between how well vehicles score on 
crash tests and how much they cost to insure — the better their scores, the 

336
Part VI: The Part of Tens 
lower their insurance costs. Buying a safe vehicle not only protects you and 
your passengers but also helps keep your insurance costs down — and that’s 
a hard combination to beat!
 
You can find crash-test results for both new and used cars at www.iihs.org.
Choose Higher Deductibles
Large lawsuits, without enough insurance, can ruin you financially, so you 
don’t want to try to save money by cutting your coverage. That said, the 
physical-damage coverage on cars typically costs 40 percent of the total 
insurance bill. If you just raise your collision deductible to $1,000 and raise 
your comprehensive deductible to $500, you can save 10 percent to 15 per-
cent on your entire insurance bill without decreasing your major-loss cover-
age in any way.
If your car is older, it may be time to drop the collision and comprehensive 
coverage. You can find more information on how to determine the most cost-
effective deductibles for you in Chapter 5.
Sell All Your Lead Shoes
Don’t speed. Obey traffic laws. Drive defensively. In other words, keep your 
driving record clear of tickets and accidents.
Most insurance companies give people with clear driving records a good-
driver discount of 20 percent to 25 percent. One at-fault accident or two 
moving violations will generally cause you to lose the discount for three 
years. How you choose to drive has a huge impact on how much you pay for 
insurance.
Put Your Teenage Driver Up for Adoption
Parents always want to know how to minimize their insurance costs when 
they’re adding a teenage driver to their insurance. Here’s my crude rule of 
thumb I use with my own clients:
If the teenager will be an occasional driver in the household, the rates on 
the car that the teen will drive will roughly double. If the teen will be the 
principal driver of one of the cars, the rates on that car will roughly triple.

337
 Chapter 26: Ten Ways to Save Big Bucks on Car Insurance
Hence, my recommendation to put the kid up for adoption.
 
Assuming you’re attached to your kid, occasional bad attitude and all, here 
are a few things you can do to keep your costs down:
 
✓ Make him turn off the TV and hit the books. If your teen stays on the B 
honor roll, he’ll earn a good-student discount and save about 15 percent 
on the cost of insurance for the car he drives.
 
✓ Send her to college far, far away. If she goes away to college and 
doesn’t take a car with her, and if the college is 100 miles or more away 
from home, you can qualify for a distant-student discount and save about 
75 percent off the cost of her insurance. She still can drive a car when 
she comes home for holidays or for summer vacation. Plus, she’s cov-
ered when she drives a friend’s car at school.
 
✓ Give him an old car to drive. Making him the driver of an older car that 
doesn’t need collision and comprehensive coverage will save about 30 
percent to 40 percent off his total insurance bill. This represents a sav-
ings of hundreds of dollars a year.
For more tips on saving money and keeping your teenagers safe, turn to 
Chapter 6.
Don’t Drink and Drive
I hope you’re obeying this law because you care about your own safety and 
the safety of those around you. But if you want a financial reason for always 
having a designated driver, note that a driving-under-the-influence (DUI) 
ticket leads to an automatic cancellation of your car insurance. Then, for 
about three years, your rates with a higher-risk insurance company (a com-
pany that specializes in insuring high-risk drivers) will be about three times 
greater than they were before your DUI; and for another two years, they’ll be 
about twice what they were before your DUI. In other words, the price you’ll 
pay for driving drunk (if you’re lucky and don’t hurt yourself or anyone else), 
will be five years of incredibly expensive car insurance.
 
If you have teenage drivers in your house, talk to them about the dangers of 
drinking and driving. Make a promise to your kids that you’ll come pick them 
up, no questions asked, anyplace, anytime — and stick to your word. Students 
Against Destructive Decisions (SADD), formerly known as Students Against 
Driving Drunk, has a great Contract for Life that you and your teens can sign. 
You can find it at www.sadd.org/contract.htm.

338
Part VI: The Part of Tens 
Maintain a High Credit Score
In the past few years, insurance companies have begun offering large dis-
counts of up to 40 percent for people with great credit scores. Statisticians 
apparently have found a strong correlation between a person’s credit rating 
and the probability of that person having accidents: The higher the rating, 
the fewer the accidents.
 
Because your credit score has an equally huge impact on your homeown-
er’s insurance rates, make sure you regularly check your credit reports for 
all three credit bureaus — Equifax, Experian, and TransUnion. You’re enti-
tled to one free credit report per year from each of the three bureaus, and 
you can get yours by going to the government-sponsored site www.annual
creditreport.com.
 
Take the time to read your credit reports closely, and if you find false informa-
tion on any of them, get it corrected — doing so will lower your insurance 
rates on both your car insurance and your homeowner’s insurance. (For more 
information on how to get your credit reports corrected, check out Credit 
Repair Kit For Dummies, 2nd Edition, by Steve Bucci [Wiley]).
Insure Your Cars and Home 
with the Same Company
This strategy benefits you in two ways:
 
✓ It reduces the chance of gaps in coverage.
 
✓ You can usually save 10 percent to 20 percent on both policies, which 
usually means a few hundred dollars a year extra in your pocket.
Many insurance companies also give you additional discounts if you have 
your umbrella policy with them, too.
Don’t Duplicate Your Health Insurance
Don’t buy any more insurance than your state requires for reimbursement of 
medical bills in a car accident.

339
 Chapter 26: Ten Ways to Save Big Bucks on Car Insurance
 
Some states call the coverage medical payments; other states call it personal 
injury protection. The primary difference between the two is that the personal 
injury protection coverage pays both medical bills and lost wages in a car 
accident.
Most states require some minimum level of coverage but then also require 
that higher limits be made available to you. Don’t take the bait. This cover-
age just duplicates coverage you should already have anyway — health 
insurance and long-term disability insurance. If you do decide to buy the 
higher coverage anyway, make sure that your health-insurance company at 
least sends you a thank-you note, because they’re the only one benefiting 
from your better coverage! (See Chapter 5 for more information on this 
recommendation.)
Don’t Submit Small Claims 
for Property Damage
You don’t want to automatically file claims for small property damage that 
you cause — whether it be to your car or to the other guy’s car. Before you 
file a claim, talk to your agent about what kind of impact this claim will have 
on your rates. Do you have other tickets or accidents? If so, this additional 
claim might seriously jack up your premiums. An at-fault claim usually raises 
your rates about 20 percent for three years.
Here’s an example: Suppose you back into a car in a parking lot causing $600 
of damage to the other car and nothing to yours. Also suppose that you’re 
currently paying $2,000 a year to insure two cars for full coverage. If turning 
in this accident will raise your rates 20 percent a year for three years, that’s 
a $1,200 total increase ($2,000 × 0.20 = $400 × 3 years = $1,200). You’re far 
better off paying the other guy $600 out of your own pocket than you are 
submitting a claim.
Do, however, submit all claims for injuries, no matter how small. Otherwise, if 
that apparent minor injury ends up being more substantial than first thought, 
and you end up getting sued later, your insurance company has grounds for 
denying your claim because you violated one of your policy conditions of 
prompt reporting of accidents.
